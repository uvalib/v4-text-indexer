      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I POEMS AND BALLADS TO THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON TO MY FRIEND EDWARD BURNE JONES THESE POEMS ARE AFFECTIONATELY AND ADMIRINGLY DEDICATED A BALLAD OF LIFE I found in dreams a place of wind and flowers, Full of sweet trees and colour of glad grass, In midst whereof there was A lady clothed like summer with sweet hours. Her beauty, fervent as a fiery moon, Made my blood burn and swoon Like a flame rained upon. Sorrow had filled her shaken eyelids' blue, And her mouth's sad red heavy rose all through Seemed sad with glad things gone. She held a little cithern by the strings, Shaped heartwise, strung with subtle-coloured hair Of some dead lute-player That in dead years had done delicious things. The seven strings were named accordingly; The first string charity, The second tenderness, The rest were pleasure, sorrow, sleep, and sin, And loving-kindness, that is pity's kin And is most pitiless. There were three men with her, each garmented With gold and shod with gold upon the feet; And with plucked ears of wheat The first man's hair was wound upon his head: His face was red, and his mouth curled and sad; All his gold garment had Pale stains of dust and rust. A riven hood was pulled across his eyes; The token of him being upon this wise Made for a sign of Lust. The next was Shame, with hollow heavy face Coloured like green wood when flame kindles it. He hath such feeble feet They may not well endure in any place. His face was full of grey old miseries, And all his blood's increase Was even increase of pain. The last was Fear, that is akin to Death; He is Shame's friend, and always as Shame saith Fear answers him again. My soul said in me; This is marvellous, Seeing the air's face is not so delicate Nor the sun's grace so great, If sin and she be kin or amorous. And seeing where maidens served her on their knees, I bade one crave of these To know the cause thereof. Then Fear said: I am Pity that was dead. And Shame said: I am Sorrow comforted. And Lust said: I am Love. Thereat her hands began a lute-playing And her sweet mouth a song in a strange tongue; And all the while she sung There was no sound but long tears following Long tears upon men's faces, waxen white With extreme sad delight. But those three following men Became as men raised up among the dead; Great glad mouths open and fair cheeks made red With child's blood come again. Then I said: Now assuredly I see My lady is perfect, and transfigureth All sin and sorrow and death, Making them fair as her own eyelids be, Or lips wherein my whole soul's life abides; Or as her sweet white sides And bosom carved to kiss. Now therefore, if her pity further me, Doubtless for her sake all my days shall be As righteous as she is. Forth, ballad, and take roses in both arms, Even till the top rose touch thee in the throat Where the least thornprick harms; And girdled in thy golden singing-coat, Come thou before my lady and say this; Borgia, thy gold hair's colour burns in me, Thy mouth makes beat my blood in feverish rhymes; Therefore so many as these roses be, Kiss me so many times. Then it may be, seeing how sweet she is, That she will stoop herself none otherwise Than a blown vine-branch doth, And kiss thee with soft laughter on thine eyes, Ballad, and on thy mouth. A BALLAD OF DEATH Kneel down, fair Love, and fill thyself with tears, Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth Upon the sides of mirth, Cover thy lips and eyelids, let thine ears Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing; Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs Upon the flesh to cleave, Set pains therein and many a grievous thing, And many sorrows after each his wise For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve. O Love's lute heard about the lands of death, Left hanged upon the trees that were therein; O Love and Time and Sin, Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath, Three lovers, each one evil spoken of; O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine Came softer with her praise; Abide a little for our lady's love. The kisses of her mouth were more than wine, And more than peace the passage of her days. O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see. O Time, thou shalt not find in any land Till, cast out of thine hand, The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee, Another woman fashioned like as this. O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in her Was made a goodly thing; Yea, she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss, With her fair kiss, and lips much lovelier Than lips of amorous roses in late spring. By night there stood over against my bed Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black, Both sides drawn fully back From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red, And temples drained of purple and full of death. Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water And the sea's gold in it. Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth. Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her, And pearl and purple and amber on her feet. Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline Were painted all the secret ways of love And covered things thereof, That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine; Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves, And brides that kept within the bride-chamber Their garment of soft shame, And weeping faces of the wearied loves That swoon in sleep and awake wearier, With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame. The tears that through her eyelids fell on me Made mine own bitter where they ran between As blood had fallen therein, She saying; Arise, lift up thine eyes and see If any glad thing be or any good Now the best thing is taken forth of us; Even she to whom all praise Was as one flower in a great multitude, One glorious flower of many and glorious, One day found gracious among many days: Even she whose handmaiden was Love—to whom At kissing times across her stateliest bed Kings bowed themselves and shed Pale wine, and honey with the honeycomb, And spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering; Even she between whose lips the kiss became As fire and frankincense; Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king, Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame, Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence. Then I beheld, and lo on the other side My lady's likeness crowned and robed and dead. Sweet still, but now not red, Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died. And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue shade, The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes. And sweet, but like spoilt gold, The weight of colour in her tresses weighed. And sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes, The body that was clothed with love of old. Ah! that my tears filled all her woven hair And all the hollow bosom of her gown— Ah! that my tears ran down Even to the place where many kisses were, Even where her parted breast-flowers have place, Even where they are cloven apart—who knows not this? Ah! the flowers cleave apart And their sweet fills the tender interspace; Ah! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart. Ah! in the days when God did good to me, Each part about her was a righteous thing; Her mouth an almsgiving, The glory of her garments charity, The beauty of her bosom a good deed, In the good days when God kept sight of us; Love lay upon her eyes, And on that hair whereof the world takes heed; And all her body was more virtuous Than souls of women fashioned otherwise. Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine hands And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves Rain-rotten in rank lands, Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves And grass that fades ere any of it be mown; And when thy bosom is filled full thereof Seek out Death's face ere the light altereth, And say “My master that was thrall to Love Is become thrall to Death.” Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and groan, But make no sojourn in thy outgoing; For haply it may be That when thy feet return at evening Death shall come in with thee. LAUS VENERIS Lors dit en plourant; Hélas trop malheureux homme et mauldict pescheur, oncques ne verrai-je clémence et miséricorde de Dieu. Ores m'en irai-je d'icy et me cacherai dedans le mont Horsel, en requérant de faveur et d'amoureuse merci ma doulce dame Vénus, car pour son amour serai-je bien à tout jamais damné en enfer. Voicy la fin de tous mes faicts d'armes et de toutes mes belles chansons. Hélas, trop belle estoyt la face de ma dame et ses yeulx, et en mauvais jour je vis ces chouses-là. Lors s'en alla tout en gémissant et se retourna chez elle, et là vescut tristement en grand amour près de sa dame. Puis après advint que le pape vit un jour esclater sur son baston force belles fleurs rouges et blanches et maints boutons de feuilles, et ainsi vit-il reverdir toute l'escorce. Ce dont il eut grande crainte et moult s'en esmut, et grande pitié lui prit de ce chevalier qui s'en estoyt départi sans espoir comme un homme misérable et damné. Doncques envoya force messaigers devers luy pour le ramener, disant qu'il aurait de Dieu grace et bonne absolution de son grand pesché d'amour. Mais oncques plus ne le virent; car toujours demeura ce pauvre chevalier auprès de Vénus la haulte et forte déesse ès flancs de la montagne amoureuse. Livre des grandes merveilles d'amour, escript en latin et en françoys par Maistre Antoine Gaget. 1530. Asleep or waking is it? for her neck, Kissed over close, wears yet a purple speck Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out; Soft, and stung softly—fairer for a fleck. But though my lips shut sucking on the place, There is no vein at work upon her face; Her eyelids are so peaceable, no doubt Deep sleep has warmed her blood through all its ways. Lo, this is she that was the world's delight; The old grey years were parcels of her might; The strewings of the ways wherein she trod Were the twain seasons of the day and night. Lo, she was thus when her clear limbs enticed All lips that now grow sad with kissing Christ, Stained with blood fallen from the feet of God, The feet and hands whereat our souls were priced. Alas, Lord, surely thou art great and fair. But lo her wonderfully woven hair! And thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss; But see now, Lord; her mouth is lovelier. She is right fair; what hath she done to thee? Nay, fair Lord Christ, lift up thine eyes and see; Had now thy mother such a lip—like this? Thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me. Inside the Horsel here the air is hot; Right little peace one hath for it, God wot; The scented dusty daylight burns the air, And my heart chokes me till I hear it not. Behold, my Venus, my soul's body, lies With my love laid upon her garment-wise, Feeling my love in all her limbs and hair And shed between her eyelids through her eyes. She holds my heart in her sweet open hands Hanging asleep; hard by her head there stands, Crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire, Love, wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands— Hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume That shift and steam—loose clots of arid fume From the sea's panting mouth of dry desire; There stands he, like one labouring at a loom. The warp holds fast across; and every thread That makes the woof up has dry specks of red; Always the shuttle cleaves clean through, and he Weaves with the hair of many a ruined head. Love is not glad nor sorry, as I deem; Labouring he dreams, and labours in the dream, Till when the spool is finished, lo I see His web, reeled off, curls and goes out like steam. Night falls like fire; the heavy lights run low, And as they drop, my blood and body so Shake as the flame shakes, full of days and hours That sleep not neither weep they as they go. Ah yet would God this flesh of mine might be Where air might wash and long leaves cover me, Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers, Or where the wind's feet shine along the sea. Ah yet would God that stems and roots were bred Out of my weary body and my head, That sleep were sealed upon me with a seal, And I were as the least of all his dead. Would God my blood were dew to feed the grass, Mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass, My body broken as a turning wheel, And my mouth stricken ere it saith Alas! Ah God, that love were as a flower or flame, That life were as the naming of a name, That death were not more pitiful than desire, That these things were not one thing and the same! Behold now, surely somewhere there is death: For each man hath some space of years, he saith, A little space of time ere time expire, A little day, a little way of breath. And lo, between the sundawn and the sun, His day's work and his night's work are undone; And lo, between the nightfall and the light, He is not, and none knoweth of such an one. Ah God, that I were as all souls that be, As any herb or leaf of any tree, As men that toil through hours of labouring night, As bones of men under the deep sharp sea. Outside it must be winter among men; For at the gold bars of the gates again I heard all night and all the hours of it The wind's wet wings and fingers drip with rain. Knights gather, riding sharp for cold; I know The ways and woods are strangled with the snow; And with short song the maidens spin and sit Until Christ's birthnight, lily-like, arow. The scent and shadow shed about me make The very soul in all my senses ache; The hot hard night is fed upon my breath, And sleep beholds me from afar awake. Alas, but surely where the hills grow deep, Or where the wild ways of the sea are steep, Or in strange places somewhere there is death, And on death's face the scattered hair of sleep. There lover-like with lips and limbs that meet They lie, they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat; But me the hot and hungry days devour, And in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet. No fruit of theirs, but fruit of my desire, For her love's sake whose lips through mine respire; Her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower, Mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire. So lie we, not as sleep that lies by death, With heavy kisses and with happy breath; Not as man lies by woman, when the bride Laughs low for love's sake and the words he saith. For she lies, laughing low with love; she lies And turns his kisses on her lips to sighs, To sighing sound of lips unsatisfied, And the sweet tears are tender with her eyes. Ah, not as they, but as the souls that were Slain in the old time, having found her fair; Who, sleeping with her lips upon their eyes, Heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair. Their blood runs round the roots of time like rain: She casts them forth and gathers them again; With nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies Exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain. Her little chambers drip with flower-like red, Her girdles, and the chaplets of her head, Her armlets and her anklets; with her feet She tramples all that winepress of the dead. Her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires, With loves burnt out and unassuaged desires; Between her lips the steam of them is sweet, The languor in her ears of many lyres. Her beds are full of perfume and sad sound, Her doors are made with music, and barred round With sighing and with laughter and with tears, With tears whereby strong souls of men are bound. There is the knight Adonis that was slain; With flesh and blood she chains him for a chain; The body and the spirit in her ears Cry, for her lips divide him vein by vein. Yea, all she slayeth; yea, every man save me; Me, love, thy lover that must cleave to thee Till the ending of the days and ways of earth, The shaking of the sources of the sea. Me, most forsaken of all souls that fell; Me, satiated with things insatiable; Me, for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth, Yea, laughter kindles at the heart of hell. Alas thy beauty! for thy mouth's sweet sake My soul is bitter to me, my limbs quake As water, as the flesh of men that weep, As their heart's vein whose heart goes nigh to break. Ah God, that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips Would crush the fruit of death upon my lips; Ah God, that death would tread the grapes of sleep And wring their juice upon me as it drips. There is no change of cheer for many days, But change of chimes high up in the air, that sways Rung by the running fingers of the wind; And singing sorrows heard on hidden ways. Day smiteth day in twain, night sundereth night, And on mine eyes the dark sits as the light; Yea, Lord, thou knowest I know not, having sinned, If heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight. Yea, as if earth were sprinkled over me, Such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea, Each pore doth yearn, and the dried blood thereof Gasps by sick fits, my heart swims heavily, There is a feverish famine in my veins; Below her bosom, where a crushed grape stains The white and blue, there my lips caught and clove An hour since, and what mark of me remains? I dare not always touch her, lest the kiss Leave my lips charred. Yea, Lord, a little bliss, Brief bitter bliss, one hath for a great sin; Nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is. Sin, is it sin whereby men's souls are thrust Into the pit? yet had I a good trust To save my soul before it slipped therein, Trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust. For if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath, I look between the iron sides of death Into sad hell where all sweet love hath end, All but the pain that never finisheth. There are the naked faces of great kings, The singing folk with all their lute-playings; There when one cometh he shall have to friend The grave that covets and the worm that clings. There sit the knights that were so great of hand, The ladies that were queens of fair green land, Grown grey and black now, brought unto the dust, Soiled, without raiment, clad about with sand. There is one end for all of them; they sit Naked and sad, they drink the dregs of it, Trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust, Trampled and trodden by the fiery feet. I see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell Cities and people whom the gods loved well, Yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold, And for their sakes on her the fire of hell. And softer than the Egyptian lote-leaf is, The queen whose face was worth the world to kiss, Wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold; And large pale lips of strong Semiramis, Curled like a tiger's that curl back to feed; Red only where the last kiss made them bleed; Her hair most thick with many a carven gem, Deep in the mane, great-chested, like a steed. Yea, with red sin the faces of them shine; But in all these there was no sin like mine; No, not in all the strange great sins of them That made the wine-press froth and foam with wine. For I was of Christ's choosing, I God's knight, No blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light; I can well see, for all the dusty days Gone past, the clean great time of goodly fight. I smell the breathing battle sharp with blows, With shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows; The fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways, Sounds and long lights are shed between the rows Of beautiful mailed men; the edged light slips, Most like a snake that takes short breath and dips Sharp from the beautifully bending head, With all its gracious body lithe as lips That curl in touching you; right in this wise My sword doth, seeming fire in mine own eyes, Leaving all colours in them brown and red And flecked with death; then the keen breaths like sighs, The caught-up choked dry laughters following them, When all the fighting face is grown a flame For pleasure, and the pulse that stuns the ears, And the heart's gladness of the goodly game. Let me think yet a little; I do know These things were sweet, but sweet such years ago, Their savour is all turned now into tears; Yea, ten years since, where the blue ripples blow, The blue curled eddies of the blowing Rhine, I felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine Touch my blood too, and sting me with delight Through all this waste and weary body of mine That never feels clear air; right gladly then I rode alone, a great way off my men, And heard the chiming bridle smite and smite, And gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again, Till my song shifted to that iron one; Seeing there rode up between me and the sun Some certain of my foe's men, for his three White wolves across their painted coats did run. The first red-bearded, with square cheeks—alack, I made my knave's blood turn his beard to black; The slaying of him was a joy to see: Perchance too, when at night he came not back, Some woman fell a-weeping, whom this thief Would beat when he had drunken; yet small grief Hath any for the ridding of such knaves; Yea, if one wept, I doubt her teen was brief. This bitter love is sorrow in all lands, Draining of eyelids, wringing of drenched hands, Sighing of hearts and filling up of graves; A sign across the head of the world he stands, An one that hath a plague-mark on his brows; Dust and spilt blood do track him to his house Down under earth; sweet smells of lip and cheek, Like a sweet snake's breath made more poisonous With chewing of some perfumed deadly grass, Are shed all round his passage if he pass, And their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak, Sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was. As one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds Smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds, And tracking ever slotwise the warm smell Is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds, His head far down the hot sweet throat of her— So one tracks love, whose breath is deadlier, And lo, one springe and you are fast in hell, Fast as the gin's grip of a wayfarer. I think now, as the heavy hours decease One after one, and bitter thoughts increase One upon one, of all sweet finished things; The breaking of the battle; the long peace Wherein we sat clothed softly, each man's hair Crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair; The sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings, And noise of singing in the late sweet air. I sang of love too, knowing nought thereof; “Sweeter,” I said, “the little laugh of love Than tears out of the eyes of Magdalen, Or any fallen feather of the Dove. “The broken little laugh that spoils a kiss, The ache of purple pulses, and the bliss Of blinded eyelids that expand again— Love draws them open with those lips of his, “Lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown Of one same fire and colour with their own; Then ere one sleep, appeased with sacrifice, Where his lips wounded, there his lips atone.” I sang these things long since and knew them not; “Lo, here is love, or there is love, God wot, This man and that finds favour in his eyes,” I said, “but I, what guerdon have I got? “The dust of praise that is blown everywhere In all men's faces with the common air; The bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet Before they wind it in a singer's hair.” So that one dawn I rode forth sorrowing; I had no hope but of some evil thing, And so rode slowly past the windy wheat And past the vineyard and the water-spring, Up to the Horsel. A great elder-tree Held back its heaps of flowers to let me see The ripe tall grass, and one that walked therein, Naked, with hair shed over to the knee. She walked between the blossom and the grass; I knew the beauty of her, what she was, The beauty of her body and her sin, And in my flesh the sin of hers, alas! Alas! for sorrow is all the end of this. O sad kissed mouth, how sorrowful it is! O breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings, Red with the bitter blossom of a kiss! Ah, with blind lips I felt for you, and found About my neck your hands and hair enwound, The hands that stifle and the hair that stings, I felt them fasten sharply without sound. Yea, for my sin I had great store of bliss: Rise up, make answer for me, let thy kiss Seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin, Lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is. Yet I waxed faint with fume of barren bowers, And murmuring of the heavy-headed hours; And let the dove's beak fret and peck within My lips in vain, and Love shed fruitless flowers. So that God looked upon me when your hands Were hot about me; yea, God brake my bands To save my soul alive, and I came forth Like a man blind and naked in strange lands That hears men laugh and weep, and knows not whence Nor wherefore, but is broken in his sense; Howbeit I met folk riding from the north Towards Rome, to purge them of their souls' offence, And rode with them, and spake to none; the day Stunned me like lights upon some wizard way, And ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight; So rode I, hearing all these chant and pray, And marvelled; till before us rose and fell White cursed hills, like outer skirts of hell Seen where men's eyes look through the day to night, Like a jagged shell's lips, harsh, untunable, Blown in between by devils' wrangling breath; Nathless we won well past that hell and death, Down to the sweet land where all airs are good, Even unto Rome where God's grace tarrieth. Then came each man and worshipped at his knees Who in the Lord God's likeness bears the keys To bind or loose, and called on Christ's shed blood, And so the sweet-souled father gave him ease. But when I came I fell down at his feet, Saying, “Father, though the Lord's blood be right sweet, The spot it takes not off the panther's skin, Nor shall an Ethiop's stain be bleached with it. “Lo, I have sinned and have spat out at God, Wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod More sharp because of mine exceeding sin, And all his raiment redder than bright blood “Before mine eyes; yea, for my sake I wot The heat of hell is waxen seven times hot Through my great sin.” Then spake he some sweet word, Giving me cheer; which thing availed me not; Yea, scarce I wist if such indeed were said; For when I ceased—lo, as one newly dead Who hears a great cry out of hell, I heard The crying of his voice across my head. “Until this dry shred staff, that hath no whit Of leaf nor bark, bear blossom and smell sweet, Seek thou not any mercy in God's sight, For so long shalt thou be cast out from it.” Yea, what if dried-up stems wax red and green, Shall that thing be which is not nor has been? Yea, what if sapless bark wax green and white, Shall any good fruit grow upon my sin? Nay, though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree, And though men drew sweet waters of the sea, There should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem, This waste wan body and shaken soul of me. Yea, though God search it warily enough, There is not one sound thing in all thereof; Though he search all my veins through, searching them He shall find nothing whole therein but love. For I came home right heavy, with small cheer, And lo my love, mine own soul's heart, more dear Than mine own soul, more beautiful than God, Who hath my being between the hands of her— Fair still, but fair for no man saving me, As when she came out of the naked sea Making the foam as fire whereon she trod, And as the inner flower of fire was she. Yea, she laid hold upon me, and her mouth Clove unto mine as soul to body doth, And, laughing, made her lips luxurious; Her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south, Strange spice and flower, strange savour of crushed fruit, And perfume the swart kings tread underfoot For pleasure when their minds wax amorous, Charred frankincense and grated sandal-root. And I forgot fear and all weary things, All ended prayers and perished thanksgivings, Feeling her face with all her eager hair Cleave to me, clinging as a fire that clings To the body and to the raiment, burning them; As after death I know that such-like flame Shall cleave to me for ever; yea, what care, Albeit I burn then, having felt the same? Ah love, there is no better life than this; To have known love, how bitter a thing it is, And afterward be cast out of God's sight; Yea, these that know not, shall they have such bliss High up in barren heaven before his face As we twain in the heavy-hearted place, Remembering love and all the dead delight, And all that time was sweet with for a space? For till the thunder in the trumpet be, Soul may divide from body, but not we One from another; I hold thee with my hand, I let mine eyes have all their will of thee, I seal myself upon thee with my might, Abiding alway out of all men's sight Until God loosen over sea and land The thunder of the trumpets of the night. EXPLICIT LAUS VENERIS. PHÆDRA HIPPOLYTUS; PHÆDRA; CHORUS OF TRŒZENIAN WOMEN HIPPOLYTUS. Lay not thine hand upon me; let me go; Take off thine eyes that put the gods to shame; What, wilt thou turn my loathing to thy death? PHÆDRA. Nay, I will never loosen hold nor breathe Till thou have slain me; godlike for great brows Thou art, and thewed as gods are, with clear hair: Draw now thy sword and smite me as thou art god, For verily I am smitten of other gods, Why not of thee? CHORUS. O queen, take heed of words; Why wilt thou eat the husk of evil speech? Wear wisdom for that veil about thy head And goodness for the binding of thy brows. PHÆDRA. Nay, but this god hath cause enow to smite; If he will slay me, baring breast and throat, I lean toward the stroke with silent mouth And a great heart. Come, take thy sword and slay; Let me not starve between desire and death, But send me on my way with glad wet lips; For in the vein-drawn ashen-coloured palm Death's hollow hand holds water of sweet draught To dip and slake dried mouths at, as a deer Specked red from thorns laps deep and loses pain. Yea, if mine own blood ran upon my mouth, I would drink that. Nay, but be swift with me; Set thy sword here between the girdle and breast, For I shall grow a poison if I live. Are not my cheeks as grass, my body pale, And my breath like a dying poisoned man's? O whatsoever of godlike names thou be, By thy chief name I charge thee, thou strong god, And bid thee slay me. Strike, up to the gold, Up to the hand-grip of the hilt; strike here; For I am Cretan of my birth; strike now; For I am Theseus' wife; stab up to the rims, I am born daughter to Pasiphae. See thou spare not for greatness of my blood, Nor for the shining letters of my name: Make thy sword sure inside thine hand and smite, For the bright writing of my name is black, And I am sick with hating the sweet sun. HIPPOLYTUS. Let not this woman wail and cleave to me, That am no part of the gods' wrath with her; Loose ye her hands from me lest she take hurt. CHORUS. Lady, this speech and majesty are twain; Pure shame is of one counsel with the gods. HIPPOLYTUS. Man is as beast when shame stands off from him. PHÆDRA. Man, what have I to do with shame or thee? I am not of one counsel with the gods. I am their kin, I have strange blood in me, I am not of their likeness nor of thine: My veins are mixed, and therefore am I mad, Yea therefore chafe and turn on mine own flesh, Half of a woman made with half a god. But thou wast hewn out of an iron womb And fed with molten mother-snow for milk. A sword was nurse of thine; Hippolyta, That had the spear to father, and the axe To bridesman, and wet blood of sword-slain men For wedding-water out of a noble well, Even she did bear thee, thinking of a sword, And thou wast made a man mistakingly. Nay, for I love thee, I will have thy hands, Nay, for I will not loose thee, thou art sweet, Thou art my son, I am thy father's wife, I ache toward thee with a bridal blood, The pulse is heavy in all my married veins, My whole face beats, I will feed full of thee, My body is empty of ease, I will be fed, I am burnt to the bone with love, thou shalt not go, I am heartsick, and mine eyelids prick mine eyes, Thou shalt not sleep nor eat nor say a word Till thou hast slain me. I am not good to live. CHORUS. This is an evil born with all its teeth, When love is cast out of the bound of love. HIPPOLYTUS. There is no hate that is so hateworthy. PHÆDRA. I pray thee turn that hate of thine my way, I hate not it nor anything of thine. Lo, maidens, how he burns about the brow, And draws the chafing sword-strap down his hand. What wilt thou do? wilt thou be worse than death? Be but as sweet as is the bitterest, The most dispiteous out of all the gods, I am well pleased. Lo, do I crave so much? I do but bid thee be unmerciful, Even the one thing thou art. Pity me not: Thou wert not quick to pity. Think of me As of a thing thy hounds are keen upon In the wet woods between the windy ways, And slay me for a spoil. This body of mine Is worth a wild beast's fell or hide of hair, And spotted deeper than a panther's grain. I were but dead if thou wert pure indeed; I pray thee by thy cold green holy crown And by the fillet-leaves of Artemis. Nay, but thou wilt not. Death is not like thee, Albeit men hold him worst of all the gods. For of all gods Death only loves not gifts, Æsch. Fr. Niobe:— ????? ???? ??? ??????? ?? ????? ???, ?.?.?. Nor with burnt-offering nor blood-sacrifice Shalt thou do aught to get thee grace of him; He will have nought of altar and altar-song, And from him only of all the lords in heaven Persuasion turns a sweet averted mouth. But thou art worse: from thee with baffled breath Back on my lips my prayer falls like a blow, And beats upon them, dumb. What shall I say? There is no word I can compel thee with To do me good and slay me. But take heed; I say, be wary; look between thy feet, Lest a snare take them though the ground be good. HIPPOLYTUS. Shame may do most where fear is found most weak; That which for shame's sake yet I have not done, Shall it be done for fear's? Take thine own way; Better the foot slip than the whole soul swerve. PHÆDRA. The man is choice and exquisite of mouth; Yet in the end a curse shall curdle it. CHORUS. He goes with cloak upgathered to the lip, Holding his eye as with some ill in sight. PHÆDRA A bitter ill he hath i' the way thereof, And it shall burn the sight out as with fire. CHORUS. Speak no such word whereto mischance is kin. PHÆDRA Out of my heart and by fate's leave I speak. CHORUS. Set not thy heart to follow after fate. PHÆDRA. O women, O sweet people of this land, O goodly city and pleasant ways thereof, And woods with pasturing grass and great well-heads, And hills with light and night between your leaves, And winds with sound and silence in your lips, And earth and water and all immortal things, I take you to my witness what I am. There is a god about me like as fire, Sprung whence, who knoweth, or who hath heart to say? A god more strong than whom slain beasts can soothe, Or honey, or any spilth of blood-like wine, Nor shall one please him with a whitened brow Nor wheat nor wool nor aught of plaited leaf. For like my mother am I stung and slain, And round my cheeks have such red malady And on my lips such fire and foam as hers. This is that Ate out of Amathus That breeds up death and gives it one for love. She hath slain mercy, and for dead mercy's sake (Being frighted with this sister that was slain) Flees from before her fearful-footed shame, And will not bear the bending of her brows And long soft arrows flown from under them As from bows bent. Desire flows out of her As out of lips doth speech: and over her Shines fire, and round her and beneath her fire. She hath sown pain and plague in all our house, Love loathed of love, and mates unmatchable, Wild wedlock, and the lusts that bleat or low, And marriage-fodder snuffed about of kine. Lo how the heifer runs with leaping flank Sleek under shaggy and speckled lies of hair, And chews a horrible lip, and with harsh tongue Laps alien froth and licks a loathlier mouth. Alas, a foul first steam of trodden tares, And fouler of these late grapes underfoot. A bitter way of waves and clean-cut foam Over the sad road of sonorous sea The high gods gave king Theseus for no love, Nay, but for love, yet to no loving end. Alas the long thwarts and the fervent oars, And blown hard sails that straightened the scant rope! There were no strong pools in the hollow sea To drag at them and suck down side and beak, No wind to catch them in the teeth and hair, No shoal, no shallow among the roaring reefs, No gulf whereout the straining tides throw spars, No surf where white bones twist like whirled white fire. But like to death he came with death, and sought And slew and spoiled and gat him that he would. For death, for marriage, and for child-getting, I set my curse against him as a sword; Yea, and the severed half thereof I leave Pittheus, because he slew not (when that face Was tender, and the life still soft in it) The small swathed child, but bred him for my fate. I would I had been the first that took her death Out from between wet hoofs and reddened teeth, Splashed horns, fierce fetlocks of the brother bull! For now shall I take death a deadlier way, Gathering it up between the feet of love Or off the knees of murder reaching it. THE TRIUMPH OF TIME Before our lives divide for ever, While time is with us and hands are free, (Time, swift to fasten and swift to sever Hand from hand, as we stand by the sea) I will say no word that a man might say Whose whole life's love goes down in a day; For this could never have been; and never, Though the gods and the years relent, shall be. Is it worth a tear, is it worth an hour, To think of things that are well outworn? Of fruitless husk and fugitive flower, The dream foregone and the deed forborne? Though joy be done with and grief be vain, Time shall not sever us wholly in twain; Earth is not spoilt for a single shower; But the rain has ruined the ungrown corn. It will grow not again, this fruit of my heart, Smitten with sunbeams, ruined with rain. The singing seasons divide and depart, Winter and summer depart in twain. It will grow not again, it is ruined at root, The bloodlike blossom, the dull red fruit; Though the heart yet sickens, the lips yet smart, With sullen savour of poisonous pain. I have given no man of my fruit to eat; I trod the grapes, I have drunken the wine. Had you eaten and drunken and found it sweet, This wild new growth of the corn and vine, This wine and bread without lees or leaven, We had grown as gods, as the gods in heaven, Souls fair to look upon, goodly to greet, One splendid spirit, your soul and mine. In the change of years, in the coil of things, In the clamour and rumour of life to be, We, drinking love at the furthest springs, Covered with love as a covering tree, We had grown as gods, as the gods above, Filled from the heart to the lips with love, Held fast in his hands, clothed warm with his wings, O love, my love, had you loved but me! We had stood as the sure stars stand, and moved As the moon moves, loving the world; and seen Grief collapse as a thing disproved, Death consume as a thing unclean. Twain halves of a perfect heart, made fast Soul to soul while the years fell past; Had you loved me once, as you have not loved; Had the chance been with us that has not been. I have put my days and dreams out of mind, Days that are over, dreams that are done. Though we seek life through, we shall surely find There is none of them clear to us now, not one. But clear are these things; the grass and the sand, Where, sure as the eyes reach, ever at hand, With lips wide open and face burnt blind, The strong sea-daisies feast on the sun. The low downs lean to the sea; the stream, One loose thin pulseless tremulous vein, Rapid and vivid and dumb as a dream, Works downward, sick of the sun and the rain; No wind is rough with the rank rare flowers; The sweet sea, mother of loves and hours, Shudders and shines as the grey winds gleam, Turning her smile to a fugitive pain. Mother of loves that are swift to fade, Mother of mutable winds and hours. A barren mother, a mother-maid, Cold and clean as her faint salt flowers. I would we twain were even as she, Lost in the night and the light of the sea, Where faint sounds falter and wan beams wade, Break, and are broken, and shed into showers. The loves and hours of the life of a man, They are swift and sad, being born of the sea. Hours that rejoice and regret for a span, Born with a man's breath, mortal as he; Loves that are lost ere they come to birth, Weeds of the wave, without fruit upon earth. I lose what I long for, save what I can, My love, my love, and no love for me! It is not much that a man can save On the sands of life, in the straits of time, Who swims in sight of the great third wave That never a swimmer shall cross or climb. Some waif washed up with the strays and spars That ebb-tide shows to the shore and the stars; Weed from the water, grass from a grave, A broken blossom, a ruined rhyme. There will no man do for your sake, I think, What I would have done for the least word said. I had wrung life dry for your lips to drink, Broken it up for your daily bread: Body for body and blood for blood, As the flow of the full sea risen to flood That yearns and trembles before it sink, I had given, and lain down for you, glad and dead. Yea, hope at highest and all her fruit, And time at fullest and all his dower, I had given you surely, and life to boot, Were we once made one for a single hour. But now, you are twain, you are cloven apart, Flesh of his flesh, but heart of my heart; And deep in one is the bitter root, And sweet for one is the lifelong flower. To have died if you cared I should die for you, clung To my life if you bade me, played my part As it pleased you—these were the thoughts that stung, The dreams that smote with a keener dart Than shafts of love or arrows of death; These were but as fire is, dust, or breath, Or poisonous foam on the tender tongue Of the little snakes that eat my heart. I wish we were dead together to-day, Lost sight of, hidden away out of sight, Clasped and clothed in the cloven clay, Out of the world's way, out of the light, Out of the ages of worldly weather, Forgotten of all men altogether, As the world's first dead, taken wholly away, Made one with death, filled full of the night. How we should slumber, how we should sleep, Far in the dark with the dreams and the dews! And dreaming, grow to each other, and weep, Laugh low, live softly, murmur and muse; Yea, and it may be, struck through by the dream, Feel the dust quicken and quiver, and seem Alive as of old to the lips, and leap Spirit to spirit as lovers use. Sick dreams and sad of a dull delight; For what shall it profit when men are dead To have dreamed, to have loved with the whole soul's might, To have looked for day when the day was fled? Let come what will, there is one thing worth, To have had fair love in the life upon earth: To have held love safe till the day grew night, While skies had colour and lips were red. Would I lose you now? would I take you then, If I lose you now that my heart has need? And come what may after death to men, What thing worth this will the dead years breed? Lose life, lose all; but at least I know, O sweet life's love, having loved you so, Had I reached you on earth, I should lose not again, In death nor life, nor in dream or deed. Yea, I know this well: were you once sealed mine, Mine in the blood's beat, mine in the breath, Mixed into me as honey in wine, Not time, that sayeth and gainsayeth, Nor all strong things had severed us then; Not wrath of gods, nor wisdom of men, Nor all things earthly, nor all divine, Nor joy nor sorrow, nor life nor death. I had grown pure as the dawn and the dew, You had grown strong as the sun or the sea. But none shall triumph a whole life through: For death is one, and the fates are three. At the door of life, by the gate of breath, There are worse things waiting for men than death; Death could not sever my soul and you, As these have severed your soul from me. You have chosen and clung to the chance they sent you, Life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer. But will it not one day in heaven repent you? Will they solace you wholly, the days that were? Will you lift up your eyes between sadness and bliss, Meet mine, and see where the great love is, And tremble and turn and be changed? Content you; The gate is strait; I shall not be there. But you, had you chosen, had you stretched hand, Had you seen good such a thing were done, I too might have stood with the souls that stand In the sun's sight, clothed with the light of the sun; But who now on earth need care how I live? Have the high gods anything left to give, Save dust and laurels and gold and sand? Which gifts are goodly; but I will none. O all fair lovers about the world, There is none of you, none, that shall comfort me. My thoughts are as dead things, wrecked and whirled Round and round in a gulf of the sea; And still, through the sound and the straining stream, Through the coil and chafe, they gleam in a dream, The bright fine lips so cruelly curled, And strange swift eyes where the soul sits free. Free, without pity, withheld from woe, Ignorant; fair as the eyes are fair. Would I have you change now, change at a blow, Startled and stricken, awake and aware? Yea, if I could, would I have you see My very love of you filling me, And know my soul to the quick, as I know The likeness and look of your throat and hair? I shall not change you. Nay, though I might, Would I change my sweet one love with a word? I had rather your hair should change in a night, Clear now as the plume of a black bright bird; Your face fail suddenly, cease, turn grey, Die as a leaf that dies in a day. I will keep my soul in a place out of sight, Far off, where the pulse of it is not heard. Far off it walks, in a bleak blown space, Full of the sound of the sorrow of years. I have woven a veil for the weeping face, Whose lips have drunken the wine of tears; I have found a way for the failing feet, A place for slumber and sorrow to meet; There is no rumour about the place, Nor light, nor any that sees or hears. I have hidden my soul out of sight, and said “Let none take pity upon thee, none Comfort thy crying: for lo, thou art dead, Lie still now, safe out of sight of the sun. Have I not built thee a grave, and wrought Thy grave-clothes on thee of grievous thought, With soft spun verses and tears unshed, And sweet light visions of things undone? “I have given thee garments and balm and myrrh, And gold, and beautiful burial things. But thou, be at peace now, make no stir; Is not thy grave as a royal king's? Fret not thyself though the end were sore; Sleep, be patient, vex me no more. Sleep; what hast thou to do with her? The eyes that weep, with the mouth that sings?” Where the dead red leaves of the years lie rotten, The cold old crimes and the deeds thrown by, The misconceived and the misbegotten, I would find a sin to do ere I die, Sure to dissolve and destroy me all through, That would set you higher in heaven, serve you And leave you happy, when clean forgotten, As a dead man out of mind, am I. Your lithe hands draw me, your face burns through me, I am swift to follow you, keen to see; But love lacks might to redeem or undo me; As I have been, I know I shall surely be; “What should such fellows as I do?” Nay, My part were worse if I chose to play; For the worst is this after all; if they knew me, Not a soul upon earth would pity me. And I play not for pity of these; but you, If you saw with your soul what man am I, You would praise me at least that my soul all through Clove to you, loathing the lives that lie; The souls and lips that are bought and sold, The smiles of silver and kisses of gold, The lapdog loves that whine as they chew, The little lovers that curse and cry. There are fairer women, I hear; that may be; But I, that I love you and find you fair, Who are more than fair in my eyes if they be, Do the high gods know or the great gods care? Though the swords in my heart for one were seven, Would the iron hollow of doubtful heaven, That knows not itself whether night-time or day be, Reverberate words and a foolish prayer? I will go back to the great sweet mother, Mother and lover of men, the sea. I will go down to her, I and none other, Close with her, kiss her and mix her with me; Cling to her, strive with her, hold her fast: O fair white mother, in days long past Born without sister, born without brother, Set free my soul as thy soul is free. O fair green-girdled mother of mine, Sea, that art clothed with the sun and the rain, Thy sweet hard kisses are strong like wine, Thy large embraces are keen like pain. Save me and hide me with all thy waves, Find me one grave of thy thousand graves, Those pure cold populous graves of thine Wrought without hand in a world without stain. I shall sleep, and move with the moving ships, Change as the winds change, veer in the tide; My lips will feast on the foam of thy lips, I shall rise with thy rising, with thee subside; Sleep, and not know if she be, if she were, Filled full with life to the eyes and hair, As a rose is fulfilled to the roseleaf tips With splendid summer and perfume and pride. This woven raiment of nights and days, Were it once cast off and unwound from me, Naked and glad would I walk in thy ways, Alive and aware of thy ways and thee; Clear of the whole world, hidden at home, Clothed with the green and crowned with the foam, A pulse of the life of thy straits and bays, A vein in the heart of the streams of the sea. Fair mother, fed with the lives of men, Thou art subtle and cruel of heart, men say. Thou hast taken, and shalt not render again; Thou art full of thy dead, and cold as they. But death is the worst that comes of thee; Thou art fed with our dead, O mother, O sea, But when hast thou fed on our hearts? or when, Having given us love, hast thou taken away? O tender-hearted, O perfect lover, Thy lips are bitter, and sweet thine heart. The hopes that hurt and the dreams that hover, Shall they not vanish away and apart? But thou, thou art sure, thou art older than earth; Thou art strong for death and fruitful of birth; Thy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover; From the first thou wert; in the end thou art. And grief shall endure not for ever, I know. As things that are not shall these things be; We shall live through seasons of sun and of snow, And none be grievous as this to me. We shall hear, as one in a trance that hears, The sound of time, the rhyme of the years; Wrecked hope and passionate pain will grow As tender things of a spring-tide sea. Sea-fruit that swings in the waves that hiss, Drowned gold and purple and royal rings. And all time past, was it all for this? Times unforgotten, and treasures of things? Swift years of liking and sweet long laughter, That wist not well of the years thereafter Till love woke, smitten at heart by a kiss, With lips that trembled and trailing wings? There lived a singer in France of old By the tideless dolorous midland sea. In a land of sand and ruin and gold There shone one woman, and none but she. And finding life for her love's sake fail, Being fain to see her, he bade set sail, Touched land, and saw her as life grew cold, And praised God, seeing; and so died he. Died, praising God for his gift and grace: For she bowed down to him weeping, and said “Live;” and her tears were shed on his face Or ever the life in his face was shed. The sharp tears fell through her hair, and stung Once, and her close lips touched him and clung Once, and grew one with his lips for a space; And so drew back, and the man was dead. O brother, the gods were good to you. Sleep, and be glad while the world endures. Be well content as the years wear through; Give thanks for life, and the loves and lures; Give thanks for life, O brother, and death, For the sweet last sound of her feet, her breath, For gifts she gave you, gracious and few, Tears and kisses, that lady of yours. Rest, and be glad of the gods; but I, How shall I praise them, or how take rest? There is not room under all the sky For me that know not of worst or best, Dream or desire of the days before, Sweet things or bitterness, any more. Love will not come to me now though I die, As love came close to you, breast to breast. I shall never be friends again with roses; I shall loathe sweet tunes, where a note grown strong Relents and recoils, and climbs and closes, As a wave of the sea turned back by song. There are sounds where the soul's delight takes fire, Face to face with its own desire; A delight that rebels, a desire that reposes; I shall hate sweet music my whole life long. The pulse of war and passion of wonder, The heavens that murmur, the sounds that shine, The stars that sing and the loves that thunder, The music burning at heart like wine, An armed archangel whose hands raise up All senses mixed in the spirit's cup Till flesh and spirit are molten in sunder— These things are over, and no more mine. These were a part of the playing I heard Once, ere my love and my heart were at strife; Love that sings and hath wings as a bird, Balm of the wound and heft of the knife. Fairer than earth is the sea, and sleep Than overwatching of eyes that weep, Now time has done with his one sweet word, The wine and leaven of lovely life. I shall go my ways, tread out my measure, Fill the days of my daily breath With fugitive things not good to treasure, Do as the world doth, say as it saith; But if we had loved each other—O sweet, Had you felt, lying under the palms of your feet, The heart of my heart, beating harder with pleasure To feel you tread it to dust and death— Ah, had I not taken my life up and given All that life gives and the years let go, The wine and honey, the balm and leaven, The dreams reared high and the hopes brought low? Come life, come death, not a word be said; Should I lose you living, and vex you dead? I never shall tell you on earth; and in heaven, If I cry to you then, will you hear or know? LES NOYADES Whatever a man of the sons of men Shall say to his heart of the lords above, They have shown man verily, once and again, Marvellous mercies and infinite love. In the wild fifth year of the change of things, When France was glorious and blood-red, fair With dust of battle and deaths of kings, A queen of men, with helmeted hair, Carrier came down to the Loire and slew, Till all the ways and the waves waxed red: Bound and drowned, slaying two by two, Maidens and young men, naked and wed. They brought on a day to his judgment-place One rough with labour and red with fight, And a lady noble by name and face, Faultless, a maiden, wonderful, white. She knew not, being for shame's sake blind, If his eyes were hot on her face hard by. And the judge bade strip and ship them, and bind Bosom to bosom, to drown and die. The white girl winced and whitened; but he Caught fire, waxed bright as a great bright flame Seen with thunder far out on the sea, Laughed hard as the glad blood went and came. Twice his lips quailed with delight, then said, “I have but a word to you all, one word; Bear with me; surely I am but dead;” And all they laughed and mocked him and heard. “Judge, when they open the judgment-roll, I will stand upright before God and pray: ‘Lord God, have mercy on one man's soul, For his mercy was great upon earth, I say. “‘Lord, if I loved thee—Lord, if I served— If these who darkened thy fair Son's face I fought with, sparing not one, nor swerved A hand's-breadth, Lord, in the perilous place— “‘I pray thee say to this man, O Lord, Sit thou for him at my feet on a throne. I will face thy wrath, though it bite as a sword, And my soul shall burn for his soul, and atone. “‘For, Lord, thou knowest, O God most wise, How gracious on earth were his deeds towards me. Shall this be a small thing in thine eyes, That is greater in mine than the whole great sea?’ “I have loved this woman my whole life long, And even for love's sake when have I said ‘I love you’? when have I done you wrong, Living? but now I shall have you dead. “Yea, now, do I bid you love me, love? Love me or loathe, we are one not twain. But God be praised in his heaven above For this my pleasure and that my pain! “For never a man, being mean like me, Shall die like me till the whole world dies. I shall drown with her, laughing for love; and she Mix with me, touching me, lips and eyes. “Shall she not know me and see me all through, Me, on whose heart as a worm she trod? You have given me, God requite it you, What man yet never was given of God.” O sweet one love, O my life's delight, Dear, though the days have divided us, Lost beyond hope, taken far out of sight, Not twice in the world shall the gods do thus. Had it been so hard for my love? but I, Though the gods gave all that a god can give, I had chosen rather the gift to die, Cease, and be glad above all that live. For the Loire would have driven us down to the sea, And the sea would have pitched us from shoal to shoal; And I should have held you, and you held me, As flesh holds flesh, and the soul the soul. Could I change you, help you to love me, sweet, Could I give you the love that would sweeten death, We should yield, go down, locked hands and feet, Die, drown together, and breath catch breath; But you would have felt my soul in a kiss, And known that once if I loved you well; And I would have given my soul for this To burn for ever in burning hell. A LEAVE-TAKING Let us go hence, my songs; she will not hear. Let us go hence together without fear; Keep silence now, for singing-time is over, And over all old things and all things dear. She loves not you nor me as all we love her. Yea, though we sang as angels in her ear, She would not hear. Let us rise up and part; she will not know. Let us go seaward as the great winds go, Full of blown sand and foam; what help is here? There is no help, for all these things are so, And all the world is bitter as a tear. And how these things are, though ye strove to show, She would not know. Let us go home and hence; she will not weep. We gave love many dreams and days to keep, Flowers without scent, and fruits that would not grow, Saying ‘If thou wilt, thrust in thy sickle and reap.’ All is reaped now; no grass is left to mow; And we that sowed, though all we fell on sleep, She would not weep. Let us go hence and rest; she will not love. She shall not hear us if we sing hereof, Nor see love's ways, how sore they are and steep. Come hence, let be, lie still; it is enough. Love is a barren sea, bitter and deep; And though she saw all heaven in flower above, She would not love. Let us give up, go down; she will not care. Though all the stars made gold of all the air, And the sea moving saw before it move One moon-flower making all the foam-flowers fair; Though all those waves went over us, and drove Deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair, She would not care. Let us go hence, go hence; she will not see. Sing all once more together; surely she, She too, remembering days and words that were, Will turn a little toward us, sighing; but we, We are hence, we are gone, as though we had not been there. Nay, and though all men seeing had pity on me, She would not see. ITYLUS Swallow, my sister, O sister swallow, How can thine heart be full of the spring? A thousand summers are over and dead. What hast thou found in the spring to follow? What hast thou found in thine heart to sing? What wilt thou do when the summer is shed? O swallow, sister, O fair swift swallow, Why wilt thou fly after spring to the south, The soft south whither thine heart is set? Shall not the grief of the old time follow? Shall not the song thereof cleave to thy mouth? Hast thou forgotten ere I forget? Sister, my sister, O fleet sweet swallow, Thy way is long to the sun and the south; But I, fulfilled of my heart's desire, Shedding my song upon height, upon hollow, From tawny body and sweet small mouth Feed the heart of the night with fire. I the nightingale all spring through, O swallow, sister, O changing swallow, All spring through till the spring be done, Clothed with the light of the night on the dew, Sing, while the hours and the wild birds follow, Take flight and follow and find the sun. Sister, my sister, O soft light swallow, Though all things feast in the spring's guest-chamber, How hast thou heart to be glad thereof yet? For where thou fliest I shall not follow, Till life forget and death remember, Till thou remember and I forget. Swallow, my sister, O singing swallow, I know not how thou hast heart to sing. Hast thou the heart? is it all past over? Thy lord the summer is good to follow, And fair the feet of thy lover the spring: But what wilt thou say to the spring thy lover? O swallow, sister, O fleeting swallow, My heart in me is a molten ember And over my head the waves have met. But thou wouldst tarry or I would follow, Could I forget or thou remember, Couldst thou remember and I forget. O sweet stray sister, O shifting swallow, The heart's division divideth us. Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree; But mine goes forth among sea-gulfs hollow To the place of the slaying of Itylus, The feast of Daulis, the Thracian sea. O swallow, sister, O rapid swallow, I pray thee sing not a little space. Are not the roofs and the lintels wet? The woven web that was plain to follow, The small slain body, the flowerlike face, Can I remember if thou forget? O sister, sister, thy first-begotten! The hands that cling and the feet that follow, The voice of the child's blood crying yet Who hath remembered me? who hath forgotten? Thou hast forgotten, O summer swallow, But the world shall end when I forget. ANACTORIA ????? ?? ?? ?????? ??? ?????????? ????????? Sappho. My life is bitter with thy love; thine eyes Blind me, thy tresses burn me, thy sharp sighs Divide my flesh and spirit with soft sound, And my blood strengthens, and my veins abound. I pray thee sigh not, speak not, draw not breath; Let life burn down, and dream it is not death. I would the sea had hidden us, the fire (Wilt thou fear that, and fear not my desire?) Severed the bones that bleach, the flesh that cleaves, And let our sifted ashes drop like leaves. I feel thy blood against my blood: my pain Pains thee, and lips bruise lips, and vein stings vein. Let fruit be crushed on fruit, let flower on flower, Breast kindle breast, and either burn one hour. Why wilt thou follow lesser loves? are thine Too weak to bear these hands and lips of mine? I charge thee for my life's sake, O too sweet To crush love with thy cruel faultless feet, I charge thee keep thy lips from hers or his, Sweetest, till theirs be sweeter than my kiss: Lest I too lure, a swallow for a dove, Erotion or Erinna to my love. I would my love could kill thee; I am satiated With seeing the live, and fain would have thee dead. I would earth had thy body as fruit to eat, And no mouth but some serpent's found thee sweet. I would find grievous ways to have thee slain, Intense device, and superflux of pain; Vex thee with amorous agonies, and shake Life at thy lips, and leave it there to ache; Strain out thy soul with pangs too soft to kill, Intolerable interludes, and infinite ill; Relapse and reluctation of the breath, Dumb tunes and shuddering semitones of death. I am weary of all thy words and soft strange ways, Of all love's fiery nights and all his days, And all the broken kisses salt as brine That shuddering lips make moist with waterish wine, And eyes the bluer for all those hidden hours That pleasure fills with tears and feeds from flowers, Fierce at the heart with fire that half comes through, But all the flowerlike white stained round with blue; The fervent underlid, and that above Lifted with laughter or abashed with love; Thine amorous girdle, full of thee and fair, And leavings of the lilies in thine hair. Yea, all sweet words of thine and all thy ways, And all the fruit of nights and flower of days, And stinging lips wherein the hot sweet brine That Love was born of burns and foams like wine, And eyes insatiable of amorous hours, Fervent as fire and delicate as flowers, Coloured like night at heart, but cloven through Like night with flame, dyed round like night with blue, Clothed with deep eyelids under and above— Yea, all thy beauty sickens me with love; Thy girdle empty of thee and now not fair, And ruinous lilies in thy languid hair. Ah, take no thought for Love's sake; shall this be, And she who loves thy lover not love thee? Sweet soul, sweet mouth of all that laughs and lives, Mine is she, very mine; and she forgives. For I beheld in sleep the light that is In her high place in Paphos, heard the kiss Of body and soul that mix with eager tears And laughter stinging through the eyes and ears; Saw Love, as burning flame from crown to feet, Imperishable, upon her storied seat; Clear eyelids lifted toward the north and south, A mind of many colours, and a mouth Of many tunes and kisses; and she bowed, With all her subtle face laughing aloud, Bowed down upon me, saying, “Who doth thee wrong, Sappho?” but thou—thy body is the song, Thy mouth the music; thou art more than I, Though my voice die not till the whole world die; Though men that hear it madden; though love weep, Though nature change, though shame be charmed to sleep. Ah, wilt thou slay me lest I kiss thee dead? Yet the queen laughed from her sweet heart and said: “Even she that flies shall follow for thy sake, And she shall give thee gifts that would not take, Shall kiss that would not kiss thee” (yea, kiss me) “When thou wouldst not”—when I would not kiss thee! Ah, more to me than all men as thou art, Shall not my songs assuage her at the heart? Ah, sweet to me as life seems sweet to death, Why should her wrath fill thee with fearful breath? Nay, sweet, for is she God alone? hath she Made earth and all the centuries of the sea, Taught the sun ways to travel, woven most fine The moonbeams, shed the starbeams forth as wine, Bound with her myrtles, beaten with her rods, The young men and the maidens and the gods? Have we not lips to love with, eyes for tears, And summer and flower of women and of years? Stars for the foot of morning, and for noon Sunlight, and exaltation of the moon; Waters that answer waters, fields that wear Lilies, and languor of the Lesbian air? Beyond those flying feet of fluttered doves, Are there not other gods for other loves? Yea, though she scourge thee, sweetest, for my sake, Blossom not thorns and flowers not blood should break. Ah that my lips were tuneless lips, but pressed To the bruised blossom of thy scourged white breast! Ah that my mouth for Muses' milk were fed On the sweet blood thy sweet small wounds had bled! That with my tongue I felt them, and could taste The faint flakes from thy bosom to the waist! That I could drink thy veins as wine, and eat Thy breasts like honey! that from face to feet Thy body were abolished and consumed, And in my flesh thy very flesh entombed! Ah, ah, thy beauty! like a beast it bites, Stings like an adder, like an arrow smites. Ah sweet, and sweet again, and seven times sweet, The paces and the pauses of thy feet! Ah sweeter than all sleep or summer air The fallen fillets fragrant from thine hair! Yea, though their alien kisses do me wrong, Sweeter thy lips than mine with all their song; Thy shoulders whiter than a fleece of white, And flower-sweet fingers, good to bruise or bite As honeycomb of the inmost honey-cells, With almond-shaped and roseleaf-coloured shells And blood like purple blossom at the tips Quivering; and pain made perfect in thy lips For my sake when I hurt thee; O that I Durst crush thee out of life with love, and die, Die of thy pain and my delight, and be Mixed with thy blood and molten into thee! Would I not plague thee dying overmuch? Would I not hurt thee perfectly? not touch Thy pores of sense with torture, and make bright Thine eyes with bloodlike tears and grievous light? Strike pang from pang as note is struck from note, Catch the sob's middle music in thy throat, Take thy limbs living, and new-mould with these A lyre of many faultless agonies? Feed thee with fever and famine and fine drouth, With perfect pangs convulse thy perfect mouth, Make thy life shudder in thee and burn afresh, And wring thy very spirit through the flesh? Cruel? but love makes all that love him well As wise as heaven and crueller than hell. Me hath love made more bitter toward thee Than death toward man; but were I made as he Who hath made all things to break them one by one, If my feet trod upon the stars and sun And souls of men as his have alway trod, God knows I might be crueller than God. For who shall change with prayers or thanksgivings The mystery of the cruelty of things? Or say what God above all gods and years With offering and blood-sacrifice of tears, With lamentation from strange lands, from graves Where the snake pastures, from scarred mouths of slaves, From prison, and from plunging prows of ships Through flamelike foam of the sea's closing lips— With thwartings of strange signs, and wind-blown hair Of comets, desolating the dim air, When darkness is made fast with seals and bars, And fierce reluctance of disastrous stars, Eclipse, and sound of shaken hills, and wings Darkening, and blind inexpiable things— With sorrow of labouring moons, and altering light And travail of the planets of the night, And weeping of the weary Pleiads seven, Feeds the mute melancholy lust of heaven? Is not his incense bitterness, his meat Murder? his hidden face and iron feet Hath not man known, and felt them on their way Threaten and trample all things and every day? Hath he not sent us hunger? who hath cursed Spirit and flesh with longing? filled with thirst Their lips who cried unto him? who bade exceed The fervid will, fall short the feeble deed, Bade sink the spirit and the flesh aspire, Pain animate the dust of dead desire, And life yield up her flower to violent fate? Him would I reach, him smite, him desecrate, Pierce the cold lips of God with human breath, And mix his immortality with death. Why hath he made us? what had all we done That we should live and loathe the sterile sun, And with the moon wax paler as she wanes, And pulse by pulse feel time grow through our veins? Thee too the years shall cover; thou shalt be As the rose born of one same blood with thee, As a song sung, as a word said, and fall Flower-wise, and be not any more at all, Nor any memory of thee anywhere; For never Muse has bound above thine hair The high Pierian flower whose graft outgrows All summer kinship of the mortal rose And colour of deciduous days, nor shed Reflex and flush of heaven about thine head, Nor reddened brows made pale by floral grief With splendid shadow from that lordlier leaf. Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine, Except these kisses of my lips on thine Brand them with immortality; but me— Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea, Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold Cast forth of heaven, with feet of awful gold And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind, Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown, But in the light and laughter, in the moan And music, and in grasp of lip and hand And shudder of water that makes felt on land The immeasurable tremor of all the sea, Memories shall mix and metaphors of me. Like me shall be the shuddering calm of night, When all the winds of the world for pure delight Close lips that quiver and fold up wings that ache; When nightingales are louder for love's sake, And leaves tremble like lute-strings or like fire; Like me the one star swooning with desire Even at the cold lips of the sleepless moon, As I at thine; like me the waste white noon, Burnt through with barren sunlight; and like me The land-stream and the tide-stream in the sea. I am sick with time as these with ebb and flow, And by the yearning in my veins I know The yearning sound of waters; and mine eyes Burn as that beamless fire which fills the skies With troubled stars and travailing things of flame; And in my heart the grief consuming them Labours, and in my veins the thirst of these, And all the summer travail of the trees And all the winter sickness; and the earth, Filled full with deadly works of death and birth, Sore spent with hungry lusts of birth and death, Has pain like mine in her divided breath; Her spring of leaves is barren, and her fruit Ashes; her boughs are burdened, and her root Fibrous and gnarled with poison; underneath Serpents have gnawn it through with tortuous teeth Made sharp upon the bones of all the dead, And wild birds rend her branches overhead. These, woven as raiment for his word and thought, These hath God made, and me as these, and wrought Song, and hath lit it at my lips; and me Earth shall not gather though she feed on thee. As a shed tear shalt thou be shed; but I— Lo, earth may labour, men live long and die, Years change and stars, and the high God devise New things, and old things wane before his eyes Who wields and wrecks them, being more strong than they— But, having made me, me he shall not slay. Nor slay nor satiate, like those herds of his Who laugh and live a little, and their kiss Contents them, and their loves are swift and sweet, And sure death grasps and gains them with slow feet, Love they or hate they, strive or bow their knees— And all these end; he hath his will of these. Yea, but albeit he slay me, hating me— Albeit he hide me in the deep dear sea And cover me with cool wan foam, and ease This soul of mine as any soul of these, And give me water and great sweet waves, and make The very sea's name lordlier for my sake, The whole sea sweeter—albeit I die indeed And hide myself and sleep and no man heed, Of me the high God hath not all his will. Blossom of branches, and on each high hill Clear air and wind, and under in clamorous vales Fierce noises of the fiery nightingales, Buds burning in the sudden spring like fire, The wan washed sand and the waves' vain desire, Sails seen like blown white flowers at sea, and words That bring tears swiftest, and long notes of birds Violently singing till the whole world sings— I Sappho shall be one with all these things, With all high things for ever; and my face Seen once, my songs once heard in a strange place, Cleave to men's lives, and waste the days thereof With gladness and much sadness and long love. Yea, they shall say, earth's womb has borne in vain New things, and never this best thing again; Borne days and men, borne fruits and wars and wine, Seasons and songs, but no song more like mine. And they shall know me as ye who have known me here, Last year when I loved Atthis, and this year When I love thee; and they shall praise me, and say “She hath all time as all we have our day, Shall she not live and have her will”—even I? Yea, though thou diest, I say I shall not die. For these shall give me of their souls, shall give Life, and the days and loves wherewith I live, Shall quicken me with loving, fill with breath, Save me and serve me, strive for me with death. Alas, that neither moon nor snow nor dew Nor all cold things can purge me wholly through, Assuage me nor allay me nor appease, Till supreme sleep shall bring me bloodless ease; Till time wax faint in all his periods; Till fate undo the bondage of the gods, And lay, to slake and satiate me all through, Lotus and Lethe on my lips like dew, And shed around and over and under me Thick darkness and the insuperable sea. HYMN TO PROSERPINE (AFTER THE PROCLAMATION IN ROME OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH) Vicisti, Galilæe. I have lived long enough, having seen one thing, that love hath an end; Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. Thou art more than the day or the morrow, the seasons that laugh or that weep; For these give joy and sorrow; but thou, Proserpina, sleep. Sweet is the treading of wine, and sweet the feet of the dove; But a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love. Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of gold, A bitter God to follow, a beautiful God to behold? I am sick of singing: the bays burn deep and chafe: I am fain To rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain. For the Gods we know not of, who give us our daily breath, We know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as death. O Gods dethroned and deceased, cast forth, wiped out in a day! From your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains, men say. New Gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your rods; They are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate Gods. But for me their new device is barren, the days are bare; Things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were. Time and the Gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst thereof, Draining a little life from the barren breasts of love. I say to you, cease, take rest; yea, I say to you all, be at peace, Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease. Wilt thou yet take all, Galilean? but these thou shalt not take, The laurel, the palms and the pæan, the breasts of the nymphs in the brake; Breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer breath; And all the wings of the Loves, and all the joy before death; All the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre, Dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like fire. More than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these things? Nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings. A little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may? For no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day. And grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his tears: Why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years? Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath; We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death. Laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day; But love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not May. Sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in the end; For the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend. Fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides; But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides. O lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and rods! O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods! Though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees bend, I kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the end. All delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past: Where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote sea-gates, Waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits: Where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as with wings, And impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable things, White-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and serpentine-curled, Rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the world. The depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away; In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey; In its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all men's tears; With light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years: With travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon hour; And bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs that devour: And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be; And its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots of the sea: And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air: And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time is made bare. Will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high sea with rods? Will ye take her to chain her with chains, who is older than all ye Gods? All ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be past; Ye are Gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at last. In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of things, Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for kings. Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod, Though these that were Gods are dead, and thou being dead art a God, Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden her head, Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead shall go down to thee dead. Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around; Thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen she is crowned. Yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say these. Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering seas, Clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair as the foam, And fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of Rome. For thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours, Her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers, White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a flame, Bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with her name. For thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but she Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on the sea. And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless ways, And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays. Ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wist that ye should not fall. Ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye all. But I turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in the end; Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. O daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of birth, I am also, I also, thy brother; I go as I came unto earth. In the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the night where thou art, Where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows from the heart, Where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red rose is white, And the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night, And the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of Gods from afar Grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star, In the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the sun, Let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done and undone. Thou art more than the Gods who number the days of our temporal breath; For these give labour and slumber; but thou, Proserpina, death. Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence. I know I shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep; even so. For the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span; A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man. ???????? ?? ???????? ??????. Epictetus. So long I endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither weep. For there is no God found stronger than death; and death is a sleep. ILICET There is an end of joy and sorrow; Peace all day long, all night, all morrow, But never a time to laugh or weep. The end is come of pleasant places, The end of tender words and faces, The end of all, the poppied sleep. No place for sound within their hearing, No room to hope, no time for fearing, No lips to laugh, no lids for tears. The old years have run out all their measure; No chance of pain, no chance of pleasure, No fragment of the broken years. Outside of all the worlds and ages, There where the fool is as the sage is, There where the slayer is clean of blood, No end, no passage, no beginning, There where the sinner leaves off sinning, There where the good man is not good. There is not one thing with another, But Evil saith to Good: My brother, My brother, I am one with thee: They shall not strive nor cry for ever: No man shall choose between them: never Shall this thing end and that thing be. Wind wherein seas and stars are shaken Shall shake them, and they shall not waken; None that has lain down shall arise; The stones are sealed across their places; One shadow is shed on all their faces, One blindness cast on all their eyes. Sleep, is it sleep perchance that covers Each face, as each face were his lover's? Farewell; as men that sleep fare well. The grave's mouth laughs unto derision Desire and dread and dream and vision, Delight of heaven and sorrow of hell. No soul shall tell nor lip shall number The names and tribes of you that slumber; No memory, no memorial. “Thou knowest”—who shall say thou knowest? There is none highest and none lowest: An end, an end, an end of all. Good night, good sleep, good rest from sorrow To these that shall not have good morrow; The gods be gentle to all these. Nay, if death be not, how shall they be? Nay, is there help in heaven? it may be All things and lords of things shall cease. The stooped urn, filling, dips and flashes; The bronzèd brims are deep in ashes; The pale old lips of death are fed. Shall this dust gather flesh hereafter? Shall one shed tears or fall to laughter, At sight of all these poor old dead? Nay, as thou wilt; these know not of it; Thine eyes' strong weeping shall not profit, Thy laughter shall not give thee ease; Cry aloud, spare not, cease not crying, Sigh, till thou cleave thy sides with sighing, Thou shalt not raise up one of these. Burnt spices flash, and burnt wine hisses, The breathing flame's mouth curls and kisses The small dried rows of frankincense; All round the sad red blossoms smoulder, Flowers coloured like the fire, but colder, In sign of sweet things taken hence; Yea, for their sake and in death's favour Things of sweet shape and of sweet savour We yield them, spice and flower and wine; Yea, costlier things than wine or spices, Whereof none knoweth how great the price is, And fruit that comes not of the vine. From boy's pierced throat and girl's pierced bosom Drips, reddening round the blood-red blossom, The slow delicious bright soft blood, Bathing the spices and the pyre, Bathing the flowers and fallen fire, Bathing the blossom by the bud. Roses whose lips the flame has deadened Drink till the lapping leaves are reddened And warm wet inner petals weep; The flower whereof sick sleep gets leisure, Barren of balm and purple pleasure, Fumes with no native steam of sleep. Why will ye weep? what do ye weeping? For waking folk and people sleeping, And sands that fill and sands that fall, The days rose-red, the poppied hours, Blood, wine, and spice and fire and flowers, There is one end of one and all. Shall such an one lend love or borrow? Shall these be sorry for thy sorrow? Shall these give thanks for words or breath? Their hate is as their loving-kindness; The frontlet of their brows is blindness, The armlet of their arms is death. Lo, for no noise or light of thunder Shall these grave-clothes be rent in sunder; He that hath taken, shall he give? He hath rent them: shall he bind together? He hath bound them: shall he break the tether? He hath slain them: shall he bid them live? A little sorrow, a little pleasure, Fate metes us from the dusty measure That holds the date of all of us; We are born with travail and strong crying, And from the birth-day to the dying The likeness of our life is thus. One girds himself to serve another, Whose father was the dust, whose mother The little dead red worm therein; They find no fruit of things they cherish; The goodness of a man shall perish, It shall be one thing with his sin. In deep wet ways by grey old gardens Fed with sharp spring the sweet fruit hardens; They know not what fruits wane or grow; Red summer burns to the utmost ember; They know not, neither can remember, The old years and flowers they used to know. Ah, for their sakes, so trapped and taken, For theirs, forgotten and forsaken, Watch, sleep not, gird thyself with prayer. Nay, where the heart of wrath is broken, Where long love ends as a thing spoken, How shall thy crying enter there? Though the iron sides of the old world falter, The likeness of them shall not alter For all the rumour of periods, The stars and seasons that come after, The tears of latter men, the laughter Of the old unalterable gods. Far up above the years and nations, The high gods, clothed and crowned with patience, Endure through days of deathlike date; They bear the witness of things hidden; Before their eyes all life stands chidden, As they before the eyes of Fate. Not for their love shall Fate retire, Nor they relent for our desire, Nor the graves open for their call. The end is more than joy and anguish, Than lives that laugh and lives that languish, The poppied sleep, the end of all. HERMAPHRODITUS I Lift up thy lips, turn round, look back for love, Blind love that comes by night and casts out rest; Of all things tired thy lips look weariest, Save the long smile that they are wearied of. Ah sweet, albeit no love be sweet enough, Choose of two loves and cleave unto the best; Two loves at either blossom of thy breast Strive until one be under and one above. Their breath is fire upon the amorous air, Fire in thine eyes and where thy lips suspire: And whosoever hath seen thee, being so fair, Two things turn all his life and blood to fire; A strong desire begot on great despair, A great despair cast out by strong desire. II Where between sleep and life some brief space is, With love like gold bound round about the head, Sex to sweet sex with lips and limbs is wed, Turning the fruitful feud of hers and his To the waste wedlock of a sterile kiss; Yet from them something like as fire is shed That shall not be assuaged till death be dead, Though neither life nor sleep can find out this. Love made himself of flesh that perisheth A pleasure-house for all the loves his kin; But on the one side sat a man like death, And on the other a woman sat like sin. So with veiled eyes and sobs between his breath Love turned himself and would not enter in. III Love, is it love or sleep or shadow or light That lies between thine eyelids and thine eyes? Like a flower laid upon a flower it lies, Or like the night's dew laid upon the night. Love stands upon thy left hand and thy right, Yet by no sunset and by no moonrise Shall make thee man and ease a woman's sighs, Or make thee woman for a man's delight. To what strange end hath some strange god made fair The double blossom of two fruitless flowers? Hid love in all the folds of all thy hair, Fed thee on summers, watered thee with showers, Given all the gold that all the seasons wear To thee that art a thing of barren hours? IV Yea, love, I see; it is not love but fear. Nay, sweet, it is not fear but love, I know; Or wherefore should thy body's blossom blow So sweetly, or thine eyelids leave so clear Thy gracious eyes that never made a tear— Though for their love our tears like blood should flow, Though love and life and death should come and go, So dreadful, so desirable, so dear? Yea, sweet, I know; I saw in what swift wise Beneath the woman's and the water's kiss Thy moist limbs melted into Salmacis, And the large light turned tender in thine eyes, And all thy boy's breath softened into sighs; But Love being blind, how should he know of this? Au Musée du Louvre, Mars 1863. FRAGOLETTA O love! what shall be said of thee? The son of grief begot by joy? Being sightless, wilt thou see? Being sexless, wilt thou be Maiden or boy? I dreamed of strange lips yesterday And cheeks wherein the ambiguous blood Was like a rose's—yea, A rose's when it lay Within the bud. What fields have bred thee, or what groves Concealed thee, O mysterious flower, O double rose of Love's, With leaves that lure the doves From bud to bower? I dare not kiss it, lest my lip Press harder than an indrawn breath, And all the sweet life slip Forth, and the sweet leaves drip, Bloodlike, in death. O sole desire of my delight! O sole delight of my desire! Mine eyelids and eyesight Feed on thee day and night Like lips of fire. Lean back thy throat of carven pearl, Let thy mouth murmur like the dove's; Say, Venus hath no girl, No front of female curl, Among her Loves. Thy sweet low bosom, thy close hair, Thy strait soft flanks and slenderer feet, Thy virginal strange air, Are these not over fair For Love to greet? How should he greet thee? what new name, Fit to move all men's hearts, could move Thee, deaf to love or shame, Love's sister, by the same Mother as Love? Ah sweet, the maiden's mouth is cold, Her breast-blossoms are simply red, Her hair mere brown or gold, Fold over simple fold Binding her head. Thy mouth is made of fire and wine, Thy barren bosom takes my kiss And turns my soul to thine And turns thy lip to mine, And mine it is. Thou hast a serpent in thine hair, In all the curls that close and cling; And ah, thy breast-flower! Ah love, thy mouth too fair To kiss and sting! Cleave to me, love me, kiss mine eyes, Satiate thy lips with loving me; Nay, for thou shalt not rise; Lie still as Love that dies For love of thee. Mine arms are close about thine head, My lips are fervent on thy face, And where my kiss hath fed Thy flower-like blood leaps red To the kissed place. O bitterness of things too sweet! O broken singing of the dove! Love's wings are over fleet, And like the panther's feet The feet of Love. RONDEL [These many years since we began to be] These many years since we began to be, What have the gods done with us? what with me, What with my love? they have shown me fates and fears, Harsh springs, and fountains bitterer than the sea, Grief a fixed star, and joy a vane that veers, These many years. With her, my love, with her have they done well? But who shall answer for her? who shall tell Sweet things or sad, such things as no man hears? May no tears fall, if no tears ever fell, From eyes more dear to me than starriest spheres These many years! But if tears ever touched, for any grief, Those eyelids folded like a white-rose leaf, Deep double shells wherethrough the eye-flower peers, Let them weep once more only, sweet and brief, Brief tears and bright, for one who gave her tears These many years. SATIA TE SANGUINE If you loved me ever so little, I could bear the bonds that gall, I could dream the bonds were brittle; You do not love me at all. O beautiful lips, O bosom More white than the moon's and warm, A sterile, a ruinous blossom Is blown your way in a storm. As the lost white feverish limbs Of the Lesbian Sappho, adrift In foam where the sea-weed swims, Swam loose for the streams to lift, My heart swims blind in a sea That stuns me; swims to and fro, And gathers to windward and lee Lamentation, and mourning, and woe. A broken, an emptied boat, Sea saps it, winds blow apart, Sick and adrift and afloat, The barren waif of a heart. Where, when the gods would be cruel, Do they go for a torture? where Plant thorns, set pain like a jewel? Ah, not in the flesh, not there! The racks of earth and the rods Are weak as foam on the sands; In the heart is the prey for gods, Who crucify hearts, not hands. Mere pangs corrode and consume, Dead when life dies in the brain; In the infinite spirit is room For the pulse of an infinite pain. I wish you were dead, my dear; I would give you, had I to give, Some death too bitter to fear; It is better to die than live. I wish you were stricken of thunder And burnt with a bright flame through, Consumed and cloven in sunder, I dead at your feet like you. If I could but know after all, I might cease to hunger and ache, Though your heart were ever so small, If it were not a stone or a snake. You are crueller, you that we love, Than hatred, hunger, or death; You have eyes and breasts like a dove, And you kill men's hearts with a breath As plague in a poisonous city Insults and exults on her dead, So you, when pallid for pity Comes love, and fawns to be fed. As a tame beast writhes and wheedles, He fawns to be fed with wiles; You carve him a cross of needles, And whet them sharp as your smiles. He is patient of thorn and whip, He is dumb under axe or dart; You suck with a sleepy red lip The wet red wounds in his heart. You thrill as his pulses dwindle, You brighten and warm as he bleeds, With insatiable eyes that kindle And insatiable mouth that feeds. Your hands nailed love to the tree, You stript him, scourged him with rods, And drowned him deep in the sea That hides the dead and their gods. And for all this, die will he not; There is no man sees him but I; You came and went and forgot; I hope he will some day die. A LITANY ?? ?????? ??????? ????? ???? ???? ?????, ???? ??? ?????? ???? ?????? ?????, ?.?.?. Anth. Sac. FIRST ANTIPHONE All the bright lights of heaven I will make dark over thee; One night shall be as seven That its skirts may cover thee; I will send on thy strong men a sword, On thy remnant a rod; Ye shall know that I am the Lord, Saith the Lord God. SECOND ANTIPHONE All the bright lights of heaven Thou hast made dark over us; One night has been as seven That its skirt might cover us; Thou hast sent on our strong men a sword, On our remnant a rod; We know that thou art the Lord, O Lord our God. THIRD ANTIPHONE As the tresses and wings of the wind Are scattered and shaken, I will scatter all them that have sinned, There shall none be taken; As a sower that scattereth seed, So will I scatter them; As one breaketh and shattereth a reed, I will break and shatter them. FOURTH ANTIPHONE As the wings and the locks of the wind Are scattered and shaken, Thou hast scattered all them that have sinned, There was no man taken; As a sower that scattereth seed, So hast thou scattered us; As one breaketh and shattereth a reed, Thou hast broken and shattered us. FIFTH ANTIPHONE From all thy lovers that love thee I God will sunder thee; I will make darkness above thee, And thick darkness under thee; Before me goeth a light, Behind me a sword; Shall a remnant find grace in my sight? I am the Lord. SIXTH ANTIPHONE From all our lovers that love us Thou God didst sunder us; Thou madest darkness above us, And thick darkness under us; Thou hast kindled thy wrath for a light, And made ready thy sword; Let a remnant find grace in thy sight, We beseech thee, O Lord. SEVENTH ANTIPHONE Wilt thou bring fine gold for a payment For sins on this wise? For the glittering of raiment And the shining of eyes, For the painting of faces And the sundering of trust, For the sins of thine high places And delight of thy lust? For your high things ye shall have lowly, Lamentation for song; For, behold, I God am holy, I the Lord am strong; Ye shall seek me and shall not reach me Till the wine-press be trod; In that hour ye shall turn and beseech me, Saith the Lord God. EIGHTH ANTIPHONE Not with fine gold for a payment, But with coin of sighs, But with rending of raiment And with weeping of eyes, But with shame of stricken faces And with strewing of dust, For the sin of stately places And lordship of lust; With voices of men made lowly, Made empty of song, O Lord God most holy, O God most strong, We reach out hands to reach thee Ere the wine-press be trod; We beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee, O Lord our God. NINTH ANTIPHONE In that hour thou shalt say to the night, Come down and cover us; To the cloud on thy left and thy right, Be thou spread over us; A snare shall be as thy mother, And a curse thy bride; Thou shalt put her away, and another Shall lie by thy side. Thou shalt neither rise up by day Nor lie down by night; Would God it were dark! thou shalt say; Would God it were light! And the sight of thine eyes shall be made As the burning of fire; And thy soul shall be sorely afraid For thy soul's desire. Ye whom your lords loved well, Putting silver and gold on you, The inevitable hell Shall surely take hold on you; Your gold shall be for a token, Your staff for a rod; With the breaking of bands ye are broken, Saith the Lord God. TENTH ANTIPHONE In our sorrow we said to the night, Fall down and cover us; To the darkness at left and at right, Be thou shed over us; We had breaking of spirit to mother And cursing to bride; And one was slain, and another Stood up at our side. We could not arise by day, Nor lie down by night; Thy sword was sharp in our way, Thy word in our sight; The delight of our eyelids was made As the burning of fire; And our souls became sorely afraid For our soul's desire. We whom the world loved well, Laying silver and gold on us, The kingdom of death and of hell Riseth up to take hold on us; Our gold is turned to a token, Our staff to a rod; Yet shalt thou bind them up that were broken, O Lord our God. A LAMENTATION I Who hath known the ways of time Or trodden behind his feet? There is no such man among men. For chance overcomes him, or crime Changes; for all things sweet In time wax bitter again. Who shall give sorrow enough, Or who the abundance of tears? Mine eyes are heavy with love And a sword gone thorough mine ears, A sound like a sword and fire, For pity, for great desire; Who shall ensure me thereof, Lest I die, being full of my fears? Who hath known the ways and the wrath, The sleepless spirit, the root And blossom of evil will, The divine device of a god? Who shall behold it or hath? The twice-tongued prophets are mute, The many speakers are still; No foot has travelled or trod, No hand has meted, his path. Man's fate is a blood-red fruit, And the mighty gods have their fill And relax not the rein, or the rod. Ye were mighty in heart from of old, Ye slew with the spear, and are slain. Keen after heat is the cold, Sore after summer is rain, And melteth man to the bone. As water he weareth away, As a flower, as an hour in a day, Fallen from laughter to moan. But my spirit is shaken with fear Lest an evil thing begin, New-born, a spear for a spear, And one for another sin. Or ever our tears began, It was known from of old and said; One law for a living man, And another law for the dead. For these are fearful and sad, Vain, and things without breath; While he lives let a man be glad, For none hath joy of his death. II Who hath known the pain, the old pain of earth, Or all the travail of the sea, The many ways and waves, the birth Fruitless, the labour nothing worth? Who hath known, who knoweth, O gods? not we. There is none shall say he hath seen, There is none he hath known. Though he saith, Lo, a lord have I been, I have reaped and sown; I have seen the desire of mine eyes, The beginning of love, The season of kisses and sighs And the end thereof. I have known the ways of the sea, All the perilous ways, Strange winds have spoken with me, And the tongues of strange days. I have hewn the pine for ships; Where steeds run arow, I have seen from their bridled lips Foam blown as the snow. With snapping of chariot-poles And with straining of oars I have grazed in the race the goals, In the storm the shores; As a greave is cleft with an arrow At the joint of the knee, I have cleft through the sea-straits narrow To the heart of the sea. When air was smitten in sunder I have watched on high The ways of the stars and the thunder In the night of the sky; Where the dark brings forth light as a flower, As from lips that dissever; One abideth the space of an hour, One endureth for ever. Lo, what hath he seen or known, Of the way and the wave Unbeholden, unsailed on, unsown, From the breast to the grave? Or ever the stars were made, or skies, Grief was born, and the kinless night, Mother of gods without form or name. And light is born out of heaven and dies, And one day knows not another's light, But night is one, and her shape the same. But dumb the goddesses underground Wait, and we hear not on earth if their feet Rise, and the night wax loud with their wings; Dumb, without word or shadow of sound; And sift in scales and winnow as wheat Men's souls, and sorrow of manifold things. III Nor less of grief than ours The gods wrought long ago To bruise men one by one; But with the incessant hours Fresh grief and greener woe Spring, as the sudden sun Year after year makes flowers; And these die down and grow, And the next year lacks none. As these men sleep, have slept The old heroes in time fled, No dream-divided sleep; And holier eyes have wept Than ours, when on her dead Gods have seen Thetis weep, With heavenly hair far-swept Back, heavenly hands outspread Round what she could not keep, Could not one day withhold, One night; and like as these White ashes of no weight, Held not his urn the cold Ashes of Heracles? For all things born one gate Opens, no gate of gold; Opens; and no man sees Beyond the gods and fate. ANIMA ANCEPS Till death have broken Sweet life's love-token, Till all be spoken That shall be said, What dost thou praying, O soul, and playing With song and saying, Things flown and fled? For this we know not— That fresh springs flow not And fresh griefs grow not When men are dead; When strange years cover Lover and lover, And joys are over And tears are shed. If one day's sorrow Mar the day's morrow— If man's life borrow And man's death pay— If souls once taken, If lives once shaken, Arise, awaken, By night, by day— Why with strong crying And years of sighing, Living and dying, Fast ye and pray? For all your weeping, Waking and sleeping, Death comes to reaping And takes away. Though time rend after Roof-tree from rafter, A little laughter Is much more worth Than thus to measure The hour, the treasure, The pain, the pleasure, The death, the birth; Grief, when days alter, Like joy shall falter; Song-book and psalter, Mourning and mirth. Live like the swallow; Seek not to follow Where earth is hollow Under the earth. IN THE ORCHARD (PROVENÇAL BURDEN) Leave go my hands, let me catch breath and see; Let the dew-fall drench either side of me; Clear apple-leaves are soft upon that moon Seen sidelong like a blossom in the tree; Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. The grass is thick and cool, it lets us lie. Kissed upon either cheek and either eye, I turn to thee as some green afternoon Turns toward sunset, and is loth to die; Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Lie closer, lean your face upon my side, Feel where the dew fell that has hardly dried, Hear how the blood beats that went nigh to swoon; The pleasure lives there when the sense has died; Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. O my fair lord, I charge you leave me this: Is it not sweeter than a foolish kiss? Nay take it then, my flower, my first in June, My rose, so like a tender mouth it is: Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Love, till dawn sunder night from day with fire, Dividing my delight and my desire, The crescent life and love the plenilune, Love me though dusk begin and dark retire; Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Ah, my heart fails, my blood draws back; I know, When life runs over, life is near to go; And with the slain of love love's ways are strewn, And with their blood, if love will have it so; Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Ah, do thy will now; slay me if thou wilt; There is no building now the walls are built, No quarrying now the corner-stone is hewn, No drinking now the vine's whole blood is spilt; Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Nay, slay me now; nay, for I will be slain; Pluck thy red pleasure from the teeth of pain, Break down thy vine ere yet grape-gatherers prune, Slay me ere day can slay desire again; Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Yea, with thy sweet lips, with thy sweet sword; yea, Take life and all, for I will die, I say; Love, I gave love, is life a better boon? For sweet night's sake I will not live till day; Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Nay, I will sleep then only; nay, but go. Ah sweet, too sweet to me, my sweet, I know Love, sleep, and death go to the sweet same tune; Hold my hair fast, and kiss me through it so. Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. A MATCH If love were what the rose is, And I were like the leaf, Our lives would grow together In sad or singing weather, Blown fields or flowerful closes, Green pleasure or grey grief; If love were what the rose is, And I were like the leaf. If I were what the words are, And love were like the tune, With double sound and single Delight our lips would mingle, With kisses glad as birds are That get sweet rain at noon; If I were what the words are, And love were like the tune. If you were life, my darling, And I your love were death, We'd shine and snow together Ere March made sweet the weather With daffodil and starling And hours of fruitful breath; If you were life, my darling, And I your love were death. If you were thrall to sorrow, And I were page to joy, We'd play for lives and seasons With loving looks and treasons And tears of night and morrow And laughs of maid and boy; If you were thrall to sorrow, And I were page to joy. If you were April's lady, And I were lord in May, We'd throw with leaves for hours And draw for days with flowers, Till day like night were shady And night were bright like day; If you were April's lady, And I were lord in May. If you were queen of pleasure, And I were king of pain, We'd hunt down love together, Pluck out his flying-feather, And teach his feet a measure, And find his mouth a rein; If you were queen of pleasure, And I were king of pain. FAUSTINE Ave Faustina Imperatrix, morituri te salutant. Lean back, and get some minutes' peace; Let your head lean Back to the shoulder with its fleece Of locks, Faustine. The shapely silver shoulder stoops, Weighed over clean With state of splendid hair that droops Each side, Faustine. Let me go over your good gifts That crown you queen; A queen whose kingdom ebbs and shifts Each week, Faustine. Bright heavy brows well gathered up: White gloss and sheen; Carved lips that make my lips a cup To drink, Faustine, Wine and rank poison, milk and blood, Being mixed therein Since first the devil threw dice with God For you, Faustine. Your naked new-born soul, their stake, Stood blind between; God said “let him that wins her take And keep Faustine.” But this time Satan throve, no doubt; Long since, I ween, God's part in you was battered out; Long since, Faustine. The die rang sideways as it fell, Rang cracked and thin, Like a man's laughter heard in hell Far down, Faustine, A shadow of laughter like a sigh, Dead sorrow's kin; So rang, thrown down, the devil's die That won Faustine. A suckling of his breed you were, One hard to wean; But God, who lost you, left you fair, We see, Faustine. You have the face that suits a woman For her soul's screen— The sort of beauty that's called human In hell, Faustine. You could do all things but be good Or chaste of mien; And that you would not if you could, We know, Faustine. Even he who cast seven devils out Of Magdalene Could hardly do as much, I doubt, For you, Faustine. Did Satan make you to spite God? Or did God mean To scourge with scorpions for a rod Our sins, Faustine? I know what queen at first you were, As though I had seen Red gold and black imperious hair Twice crown Faustine. As if your fed sarcophagus Spared flesh and skin, You come back face to face with us, The same Faustine. She loved the games men played with death, Where death must win; As though the slain man's blood and breath Revived Faustine. Nets caught the pike, pikes tore the net; Lithe limbs and lean From drained-out pores dripped thick red sweat To soothe Faustine. She drank the steaming drift and dust Blown off the scene; Blood could not ease the bitter lust That galled Faustine. All round the foul fat furrows reeked, Where blood sank in; The circus splashed and seethed and shrieked All round Faustine. But these are gone now: years entomb The dust and din; Yea, even the bath's fierce reek and fume That slew Faustine. Was life worth living then? and now Is life worth sin? Where are the imperial years? and how Are you Faustine? Your soul forgot her joys, forgot Her times of teen; Yea, this life likewise will you not Forget, Faustine? For in the time we know not of Did fate begin Weaving the web of days that wove Your doom, Faustine. The threads were wet with wine, and all Were smooth to spin; They wove you like a Bacchanal, The first Faustine. And Bacchus cast your mates and you Wild grapes to glean; Your flower-like lips were dashed with dew From his, Faustine. Your drenched loose hands were stretched to hold The vine's wet green, Long ere they coined in Roman gold Your face, Faustine. Then after change of soaring feather And winnowing fin, You woke in weeks of feverish weather, A new Faustine. A star upon your birthday burned, Whose fierce serene Red pulseless planet never yearned In heaven, Faustine. Stray breaths of Sapphic song that blew Through Mitylene Shook the fierce quivering blood in you By night, Faustine. The shameless nameless love that makes Hell's iron gin Shut on you like a trap that breaks The soul, Faustine. And when your veins were void and dead, What ghosts unclean Swarmed round the straitened barren bed That hid Faustine? What sterile growths of sexless root Or epicene? What flower of kisses without fruit Of love, Faustine? What adders came to shed their coats? What coiled obscene Small serpents with soft stretching throats Caressed Faustine? But the time came of famished hours, Maimed loves and mean, This ghastly thin-faced time of ours, To spoil Faustine. You seem a thing that hinges hold, A love-machine With clockwork joints of supple gold— No more, Faustine. Not godless, for you serve one God, The Lampsacene, Who metes the gardens with his rod; Your lord, Faustine. If one should love you with real love (Such things have been, Things your fair face knows nothing of, It seems, Faustine); That clear hair heavily bound back, The lights wherein Shift from dead blue to burnt-up black; Your throat, Faustine, Strong, heavy, throwing out the face And hard bright chin And shameful scornful lips that grace Their shame, Faustine, Curled lips, long since half kissed away, Still sweet and keen; You'd give him—poison shall we say? Or what, Faustine? A CAMEO There was a graven image of Desire Painted with red blood on a ground of gold Passing between the young men and the old, And by him Pain, whose body shone like fire, And Pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire. Of his left wrist, with fingers clenched and cold, The insatiable Satiety kept hold, Walking with feet unshod that pashed the mire. The senses and the sorrows and the sins, And the strange loves that suck the breasts of Hate Till lips and teeth bite in their sharp indenture, Followed like beasts with flap of wings and fins. Death stood aloof behind a gaping grate, Upon whose lock was written Peradventure. SONG BEFORE DEATH 1795 (FROM THE FRENCH) Sweet mother, in a minute's span Death parts thee and my love of thee; Sweet love, that yet art living man, Come back, true love, to comfort me. Back, ah, come back! ah wellaway! But my love comes not any day. As roses, when the warm West blows, Break to full flower and sweeten spring, My soul would break to a glorious rose In such wise at his whispering. In vain I listen; wellaway! My love says nothing any day. You that will weep for pity of love On the low place where I am lain, I pray you, having wept enough, Tell him for whom I bore such pain That he was yet, ah! wellaway! My true love to my dying day. ROCOCO Take hands and part with laughter; Touch lips and part with tears; Once more and no more after, Whatever comes with years. We twain shall not remeasure The ways that left us twain; Nor crush the lees of pleasure From sanguine grapes of pain. We twain once well in sunder, What will the mad gods do For hate with me, I wonder, Or what for love with you? Forget them till November, And dream there's April yet; Forget that I remember, And dream that I forget. Time found our tired love sleeping, And kissed away his breath; But what should we do weeping, Though light love sleep to death? We have drained his lips at leisure, Till there's not left to drain A single sob of pleasure, A single pulse of pain. Dream that the lips once breathless Might quicken if they would; Say that the soul is deathless; Dream that the gods are good; Say March may wed September, And time divorce regret; But not that you remember, And not that I forget. We have heard from hidden places What love scarce lives and hears: We have seen on fervent faces The pallor of strange tears: We have trod the wine-vat's treasure, Whence, ripe to steam and stain, Foams round the feet of pleasure The blood-red must of pain. Remembrance may recover And time bring back to time The name of your first lover, The ring of my first rhyme; But rose-leaves of December The frosts of June shall fret, The day that you remember, The day that I forget. The snake that hides and hisses In heaven we twain have known; The grief of cruel kisses, The joy whose mouth makes moan; The pulse's pause and measure, Where in one furtive vein Throbs through the heart of pleasure The purpler blood of pain. We have done with tears and treasons And love for treason's sake; Room for the swift new seasons, The years that burn and break, Dismantle and dismember Men's days and dreams, Juliette; For love may not remember, But time will not forget. Life treads down love in flying, Time withers him at root; Bring all dead things and dying, Reaped sheaf and ruined fruit, Where, crushed by three days' pressure, Our three days' love lies slain; And earlier leaf of pleasure, And latter flower of pain. Breathe close upon the ashes, It may be flame will leap; Unclose the soft close lashes, Lift up the lids, and weep. Light love's extinguished ember, Let one tear leave it wet For one that you remember And ten that you forget. STAGE LOVE When the game began between them for a jest, He played king and she played queen to match the best; Laughter soft as tears, and tears that turned to laughter, These were things she sought for years and sorrowed after. Pleasure with dry lips, and pain that walks by night; All the sting and all the stain of long delight; These were things she knew not of, that knew not of her, When she played at half a love with half a lover. Time was chorus, gave them cues to laugh or cry; They would kill, befool, amuse him, let him die; Set him webs to weave to-day and break to-morrow, Till he died for good in play, and rose in sorrow. What the years mean; how time dies and is not slain; How love grows and laughs and cries and wanes again; These were things she came to know, and take their measure, When the play was played out so for one man's pleasure. THE LEPER Nothing is better, I well think, Than love; the hidden well-water Is not so delicate to drink: This was well seen of me and her. I served her in a royal house; I served her wine and curious meat. For will to kiss between her brows, I had no heart to sleep or eat. Mere scorn God knows she had of me, A poor scribe, nowise great or fair, Who plucked his clerk's hood back to see Her curled-up lips and amorous hair. I vex my head with thinking this. Yea, though God always hated me, And hates me now that I can kiss Her eyes, plait up her hair to see How she then wore it on the brows, Yet am I glad to have her dead Here in this wretched wattled house Where I can kiss her eyes and head. Nothing is better, I well know, Than love; no amber in cold sea Or gathered berries under snow: That is well seen of her and me. Three thoughts I make my pleasure of: First I take heart and think of this: That knight's gold hair she chose to love, His mouth she had such will to kiss. Then I remember that sundawn I brought him by a privy way Out at her lattice, and thereon What gracious words she found to say. (Cold rushes for such little feet— Both feet could lie into my hand. A marvel was it of my sweet Her upright body could so stand.) “Sweet friend, God give you thank and grace; Now am I clean and whole of shame, Nor shall men burn me in the face For my sweet fault that scandals them.” I tell you over word by word. She, sitting edgewise on her bed, Holding her feet, said thus. The third, A sweeter thing than these, I said. God, that makes time and ruins it And alters not, abiding God, Changed with disease her body sweet, The body of love wherein she abode. Love is more sweet and comelier Than a dove's throat strained out to sing. All they spat out and cursed at her And cast her forth for a base thing. They cursed her, seeing how God had wrought This curse to plague her, a curse of his. Fools were they surely, seeing not How sweeter than all sweet she is. He that had held her by the hair, With kissing lips blinding her eyes, Felt her bright bosom, strained and bare, Sigh under him, with short mad cries Out of her throat and sobbing mouth And body broken up with love, With sweet hot tears his lips were loth Her own should taste the savour of, Yea, he inside whose grasp all night Her fervent body leapt or lay, Stained with sharp kisses red and white, Found her a plague to spurn away. I hid her in this wattled house, I served her water and poor bread. For joy to kiss between her brows Time upon time I was nigh dead. Bread failed; we got but well-water And gathered grass with dropping seed. I had such joy of kissing her, I had small care to sleep or feed. Sometimes when service made me glad The sharp tears leapt between my lids, Falling on her, such joy I had To do the service God forbids. “I pray you let me be at peace, Get hence, make room for me to die.” She said that: her poor lip would cease, Put up to mine, and turn to cry. I said, “Bethink yourself how love Fared in us twain, what either did; Shall I unclothe my soul thereof? That I should do this, God forbid.” Yea, though God hateth us, he knows That hardly in a little thing Love faileth of the work it does Till it grow ripe for gathering. Six months, and now my sweet is dead A trouble takes me; I know not If all were done well, all well said, No word or tender deed forgot. Too sweet, for the least part in her, To have shed life out by fragments; yet, Could the close mouth catch breath and stir, I might see something I forget. Six months, and I sit still and hold In two cold palms her cold two feet. Her hair, half grey half ruined gold, Thrills me and burns me in kissing it. Love bites and stings me through, to see Her keen face made of sunken bones. Her worn-off eyelids madden me, That were shot through with purple once. She said, “Be good with me; I grow So tired for shame's sake, I shall die If you say nothing:” even so. And she is dead now, and shame put by. Yea, and the scorn she had of me In the old time, doubtless vexed her then. I never should have kissed her. See What fools God's anger makes of men! She might have loved me a little too, Had I been humbler for her sake. But that new shame could make love new She saw not—yet her shame did make. I took too much upon my love, Having for such mean service done Her beauty and all the ways thereof, Her face and all the sweet thereon. Yea, all this while I tended her, I know the old love held fast his part: I know the old scorn waxed heavier, Mixed with sad wonder, in her heart. It may be all my love went wrong— A scribe's work writ awry and blurred, Scrawled after the blind evensong— Spoilt music with no perfect word. But surely I would fain have done All things the best I could. Perchance Because I failed, came short of one, She kept at heart that other man's. I am grown blind with all these things: It may be now she hath in sight Some better knowledge; still there clings The old question. Will not God do right? En ce temps-là estoyt dans ce pays grand nombre de ladres et de meseaulx, ce dont le roy eut grand desplaisir, veu que Dieu dust en estre moult griefvement courroucé. Ores il advint qu'une noble damoyselle appelée Yolande de Sallières estant atteincte et touste guastée de ce vilain mal, tous ses amys et ses parens ayant devant leurs yeux la paour de Dieu la firent issir fors de leurs maisons et oncques ne voulurent recepvoir ni reconforter chose mauldicte de Dieu et à tous les hommes puante et abhominable. Ceste dame avoyt esté moult belle et gracieuse de formes, et de son corps elle estoyt large et de vie lascive. Pourtant nul des amans qui l'avoyent souventesfois accollée et baisée moult tendrement ne voulust plus héberger si laide femme et si détestable pescheresse. Ung seul clerc qui feut premièrement son lacquays et son entremetteur en matière d'amour la reçut chez luy et la récéla dans une petite cabane. Là mourut la meschinette de grande misère et de male mort: et après elle décéda ledist clerc qui pour grand amour l'avoyt six mois durant soignée, lavée, habillée et deshabillée tous les jours de ses mains propres. Mesme dist-on que ce meschant homme et mauldict clerc se remémourant de la grande beauté passée et guastée de ceste femme se délectoyt maintesfois à la baiser sur sa bouche orde et lépreuse et l'accoller doulcement de ses mains amoureuses. Aussy est-il mort de ceste mesme maladie abhominable. Cecy advint près Fontainebellant en Gastinois. Et quand ouyt le roy Philippe ceste adventure moult en estoyt esmerveillé. Grandes Chroniques de France, 1505. A BALLAD OF BURDENS The burden of fair women. Vain delight, And love self-slain in some sweet shameful way, And sorrowful old age that comes by night As a thief comes that has no heart by day, And change that finds fair cheeks and leaves them grey, And weariness that keeps awake for hire, And grief that says what pleasure used to say; This is the end of every man's desire. The burden of bought kisses. This is sore, A burden without fruit in childbearing; Between the nightfall and the dawn threescore, Threescore between the dawn and evening. The shuddering in thy lips, the shuddering In thy sad eyelids tremulous like fire, Makes love seem shameful and a wretched thing. This is the end of every man's desire. The burden of sweet speeches. Nay, kneel down, Cover thy head, and weep; for verily These market-men that buy thy white and brown In the last days shall take no thought for thee. In the last days like earth thy face shall be, Yea, like sea-marsh made thick with brine and mire, Sad with sick leavings of the sterile sea. This is the end of every man's desire. The burden of long living. Thou shalt fear Waking, and sleeping mourn upon thy bed; And say at night “Would God the day were here,” And say at dawn “Would God the day were dead.” With weary days thou shalt be clothed and fed, And wear remorse of heart for thine attire, Pain for thy girdle and sorrow upon thine head; This is the end of every man's desire. The burden of bright colours. Thou shalt see Gold tarnished, and the grey above the green; And as the thing thou seest thy face shall be, And no more as the thing beforetime seen. And thou shalt say of mercy “It hath been,” And living, watch the old lips and loves expire, And talking, tears shall take thy breath between; This is the end of every man's desire. The burden of sad sayings. In that day Thou shalt tell all thy days and hours, and tell Thy times and ways and words of love, and say How one was dear and one desirable, And sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell, But now with lights reverse the old hours retire And the last hour is shod with fire from hell; This is the end of every man's desire. The burden of four seasons. Rain in spring, White rain and wind among the tender trees; A summer of green sorrows gathering, Rank autumn in a mist of miseries, With sad face set towards the year, that sees The charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre, And winter wan with many maladies; This is the end of every man's desire. The burden of dead faces. Out of sight And out of love, beyond the reach of hands, Changed in the changing of the dark and light, They walk and weep about the barren lands Where no seed is nor any garner stands, Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire, And time's turned glass lets through the sighing sands; This is the end of every man's desire. The burden of much gladness. Life and lust Forsake thee, and the face of thy delight; And underfoot the heavy hour strews dust, And overhead strange weathers burn and bite; And where the red was, lo the bloodless white, And where truth was, the likeness of a liar, And where day was, the likeness of the night; This is the end of every man's desire. L'ENVOY Princes, and ye whom pleasure quickeneth, Heed well this rhyme before your pleasure tire; For life is sweet, but after life is death. This is the end of every man's desire. RONDEL [Kissing her hair I sat against her feet] Kissing her hair I sat against her feet, Wove and unwove it, wound and found it sweet; Made fast therewith her hands, drew down her eyes, Deep as deep flowers and dreamy like dim skies; With her own tresses bound and found her fair, Kissing her hair. Sleep were no sweeter than her face to me, Sleep of cold sea-bloom under the cold sea; What pain could get between my face and hers? What new sweet thing would love not relish worse? Unless, perhaps, white death had kissed me there, Kissing her hair? BEFORE THE MIRROR (VERSES WRITTEN UNDER A PICTURE) INSCRIBED TO J. A. WHISTLER I White rose in red rose-garden Is not so white; Snowdrops that plead for pardon And pine for fright Because the hard East blows Over their maiden rows Grow not as this face grows from pale to bright. Behind the veil, forbidden, Shut up from sight, Love, is there sorrow hidden, Is there delight? Is joy thy dower or grief, White rose of weary leaf, Late rose whose life is brief, whose loves are light? Soft snows that hard winds harden Till each flake bite Fill all the flowerless garden Whose flowers took flight Long since when summer ceased, And men rose up from feast, And warm west wind grew east, and warm day night. II “Come snow, come wind or thunder High up in air, I watch my face, and wonder At my bright hair; Nought else exalts or grieves The rose at heart, that heaves With love of her own leaves and lips that pair. “She knows not loves that kissed her She knows not where. Art thou the ghost, my sister, White sister there, Am I the ghost, who knows? My hand, a fallen rose, Lies snow-white on white snows, and takes no care. “I cannot see what pleasures Or what pains were; What pale new loves and treasures New years will bear; What beam will fall, what shower, What grief or joy for dower; But one thing knows the flower; the flower is fair.” III Glad, but not flushed with gladness, Since joys go by; Sad, but not bent with sadness, Since sorrows die; Deep in the gleaming glass She sees all past things pass, And all sweet life that was lie down and lie. There glowing ghosts of flowers Draw down, draw nigh; And wings of swift spent hours Take flight and fly; She sees by formless gleams, She hears across cold streams, Dead mouths of many dreams that sing and sigh. Face fallen and white throat lifted, With sleepless eye She sees old loves that drifted, She knew not why, Old loves and faded fears Float down a stream that hears The flowing of all men's tears beneath the sky. EROTION Sweet for a little even to fear, and sweet, O love, to lay down fear at love's fair feet; Shall not some fiery memory of his breath Lie sweet on lips that touch the lips of death? Yet leave me not; yet, if thou wilt, be free; Love me no more, but love my love of thee. Love where thou wilt, and live thy life; and I, One thing I can, and one love cannot—die. Pass from me; yet thine arms, thine eyes, thine hair, Feed my desire and deaden my despair. Yet once more ere time change us, ere my cheek Whiten, ere hope be dumb or sorrow speak, Yet once more ere thou hate me, one full kiss; Keep other hours for others, save me this. Yea, and I will not (if it please thee) weep, Lest thou be sad; I will but sigh, and sleep. Sweet, does death hurt? thou canst not do me wrong: I shall not lack thee, as I loved thee, long. Hast thou not given me above all that live Joy, and a little sorrow shalt not give? What even though fairer fingers of strange girls Pass nestling through thy beautiful boy's curls As mine did, or those curled lithe lips of thine Meet theirs as these, all theirs come after mine; And though I were not, though I be not, best, I have loved and love thee more than all the rest. O love, O lover, loose or hold me fast, I had thee first, whoever have thee last; Fairer or not, what need I know, what care? To thy fair bud my blossom once seemed fair. Why am I fair at all before thee, why At all desired? seeing thou art fair, not I. I shall be glad of thee, O fairest head, Alive, alone, without thee, with thee, dead; I shall remember while the light lives yet, And in the night-time I shall not forget. Though (as thou wilt) thou leave me ere life leave, I will not, for thy love I will not, grieve; Not as they use who love not more than I, Who love not as I love thee though I die; And though thy lips, once mine, be oftener prest To many another brow and balmier breast, And sweeter arms, or sweeter to thy mind, Lull thee or lure, more fond thou wilt not find. IN MEMORY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR Back to the flower-town, side by side, The bright months bring, New-born, the bridegroom and the bride, Freedom and spring. The sweet land laughs from sea to sea, Filled full of sun; All things come back to her, being free; All things but one. In many a tender wheaten plot Flowers that were dead Live, and old suns revive; but not That holier head. By this white wandering waste of sea, Far north, I hear One face shall never turn to me As once this year: Shall never smile and turn and rest On mine as there, Nor one most sacred hand be prest Upon my hair. I came as one whose thoughts half linger, Half run before; The youngest to the oldest singer That England bore. I found him whom I shall not find Till all grief end, In holiest age our mightiest mind, Father and friend. But thou, if anything endure, If hope there be, O spirit that man's life left pure, Man's death set free, Not with disdain of days that were Look earthward now; Let dreams revive the reverend hair, The imperial brow; Come back in sleep, for in the life Where thou art not We find none like thee. Time and strife And the world's lot Move thee no more; but love at least And reverent heart May move thee, royal and released, Soul, as thou art. And thou, his Florence, to thy trust Receive and keep, Keep safe his dedicated dust, His sacred sleep. So shall thy lovers, come from far, Mix with thy name As morning-star with evening-star His faultless fame. A SONG IN TIME OF ORDER. 1852. Push hard across the sand, For the salt wind gathers breath; Shoulder and wrist and hand, Push hard as the push of death. The wind is as iron that rings, The foam-heads loosen and flee; It swells and welters and swings, The pulse of the tide of the sea. And up on the yellow cliff The long corn flickers and shakes; Push, for the wind holds stiff, And the gunwale dips and rakes. Good hap to the fresh fierce weather, The quiver and beat of the sea! While three men hold together, The kingdoms are less by three. Out to the sea with her there, Out with her over the sand; Let the kings keep the earth for their share! We have done with the sharers of land. They have tied the world in a tether, They have bought over God with a fee; While three men hold together, The kingdoms are less by three. We have done with the kisses that sting, The thief's mouth red from the feast, The blood on the hands of the king And the lie at the lips of the priest. Will they tie the winds in a tether, Put a bit in the jaws of the sea? While three men hold together, The kingdoms are less by three. Let our flag run out straight in the wind! The old red shall be floated again When the ranks that are thin shall be thinned, When the names that were twenty are ten; When the devil's riddle is mastered And the galley-bench creaks with a Pope, We shall see Buonaparte the bastard Kick heels with his throat in a rope. While the shepherd sets wolves on his sheep And the emperor halters his kine, While Shame is a watchman asleep And Faith is a keeper of swine, Let the wind shake our flag like a feather, Like the plumes of the foam of the sea! While three men hold together, The kingdoms are less by three. All the world has its burdens to bear, From Cayenne to the Austrian whips; Forth, with the rain in our hair And the salt sweet foam in our lips; In the teeth of the hard glad weather, In the blown wet face of the sea; While three men hold together, The kingdoms are less by three. A SONG IN TIME OF REVOLUTION. 1860. The heart of the rulers is sick, and the high-priest covers his head: For this is the song of the quick that is heard in the ears of the dead. The poor and the halt and the blind are keen and mighty and fleet: Like the noise of the blowing of wind is the sound of the noise of their feet. The wind has the sound of a laugh in the clamour of days and of deeds: The priests are scattered like chaff, and the rulers broken like reeds. The high-priest sick from qualms, with his raiment bloodily dashed; The thief with branded palms, and the liar with cheeks abashed. They are smitten, they tremble greatly, they are pained for their pleasant things: For the house of the priests made stately, and the might in the mouth of the kings. They are grieved and greatly afraid; they are taken, they shall not flee: For the heart of the nations is made as the strength of the springs of the sea. They were fair in the grace of gold, they walked with delicate feet: They were clothed with the cunning of old, and the smell of their garments was sweet. For the breaking of gold in their hair they halt as a man made lame: They are utterly naked and bare; their mouths are bitter with shame. Wilt thou judge thy people now, O king that wast found most wise? Wilt thou lie any more, O thou whose mouth is emptied of lies? Shall God make a pact with thee, till his hook be found in thy sides? Wilt thou put back the time of the sea, or the place of the season of tides? Set a word in thy lips, to stand before God with a word in thy mouth: That “the rain shall return in the land, and the tender dew after drouth.” But the arm of the elders is broken, their strength is unbound and undone: They wait for a sign of a token; they cry, and there cometh none. Their moan is in every place, the cry of them filleth the land: There is shame in the sight of their face, there is fear in the thews of their hand. They are girdled about the reins with a curse for the girdle thereon: For the noise of the rending of chains the face of their colour is gone. For the sound of the shouting of men they are grievously stricken at heart: They are smitten asunder with pain, their bones are smitten apart. There is none of them all that is whole; their lips gape open for breath; They are clothed with sickness of soul, and the shape of the shadow of death. The wind is thwart in their feet; it is full of the shouting of mirth; As one shaketh the sides of a sheet, so it shaketh the ends of the earth. The sword, the sword is made keen; the iron has opened its mouth; The corn is red that was green; it is bound for the sheaves of the south. The sound of a word was shed, the sound of the wind as a breath, In the ears of the souls that were dead, in the dust of the deepness of death; Where the face of the moon is taken, the ways of the stars undone, The light of the whole sky shaken, the light of the face of the sun: Where the waters are emptied and broken, the waves of the waters are stayed; Where God has bound for a token the darkness that maketh afraid; Where the sword was covered and hidden, and dust had grown in its side, A word came forth which was bidden, the crying of one that cried: The sides of the two-edged sword shall be bare, and its mouth shall be red, For the breath of the face of the Lord that is felt in the bones of the dead. TO VICTOR HUGO In the fair days when God By man as godlike trod, And each alike was Greek, alike was free, God's lightning spared, they said, Alone the happier head Whose laurels screened it; fruitless grace for thee, To whom the high gods gave of right Their thunders and their laurels and their light. Sunbeams and bays before Our master's servants wore, For these Apollo left in all men's lands; But far from these ere now And watched with jealous brow Lay the blind lightnings shut between God's hands, And only loosed on slaves and kings The terror of the tempest of their wings. Born in those younger years That shone with storms of spears And shook in the wind blown from a dead world's pyre, When by her back-blown hair Napoleon caught the fair And fierce Republic with her feet of fire, And stayed with iron words and hands Her flight, and freedom in a thousand lands: Thou sawest the tides of things Close over heads of kings, And thine hand felt the thunder, and to thee Laurels and lightnings were As sunbeams and soft air Mixed each in other, or as mist with sea Mixed, or as memory with desire, Or the lute's pulses with the louder lyre. For thee man's spirit stood Disrobed of flesh and blood, And bare the heart of the most secret hours; And to thine hand more tame Than birds in winter came High hopes and unknown flying forms of powers, And from thy table fed, and sang Till with the tune men's ears took fire and rang. Even all men's eyes and ears With fiery sound and tears Waxed hot, and cheeks caught flame and eyelid light, At those high songs of thine That stung the sense like wine, Or fell more soft than dew or snow by night, Or wailed as in some flooded cave Sobs the strong broken spirit of a wave. But we, our master, we Whose hearts, uplift to thee, Ache with the pulse of thy remembered song, We ask not nor await From the clenched hands of fate, As thou, remission of the world's old wrong; Respite we ask not, nor release; Freedom a man may have, he shall not peace. Though thy most fiery hope Storm heaven, to set wide ope The all-sought-for gate whence God or Chance debars All feet of men, all eyes— The old night resumes her skies, Her hollow hiding-place of clouds and stars, Where nought save these is sure in sight; And, paven with death, our days are roofed with night. One thing we can; to be Awhile, as men may, free; But not by hope or pleasure the most stern Goddess, most awful-eyed, Sits, but on either side Sit sorrow and the wrath of hearts that burn, Sad faith that cannot hope or fear, And memory grey with many a flowerless year. Not that in stranger's wise I lift not loving eyes To the fair foster-mother France, that gave Beyond the pale fleet foam Help to my sires and home, Whose great sweet breast could shelter those and save Whom from her nursing breasts and hands Their land cast forth of old on gentler lands. Not without thoughts that ache For theirs and for thy sake, I, born of exiles, hail thy banished head; I whose young song took flight Toward the great heat and light On me a child from thy far splendour shed, From thine high place of soul and song, Which, fallen on eyes yet feeble, made them strong. Ah, not with lessening love For memories born hereof, I look to that sweet mother-land, and see The old fields and fair full streams, And skies, but fled like dreams The feet of freedom and the thought of thee; And all between the skies and graves The mirth of mockers and the shame of slaves. She, killed with noisome air, Even she! and still so fair, Who said “Let there be freedom,” and there was Freedom; and as a lance The fiery eyes of France Touched the world's sleep and as a sleep made pass Forth of men's heavier ears and eyes Smitten with fire and thunder from new skies. Are they men's friends indeed Who watch them weep and bleed? Because thou hast loved us, shall the gods love thee? Thou, first of men and friend, Seest thou, even thou, the end? Thou knowest what hath been, knowest thou what shall be? Evils may pass and hopes endure; But fate is dim, and all the gods obscure. O nursed in airs apart, O poet highest of heart, Hast thou seen time, who hast seen so many things? Are not the years more wise, More sad than keenest eyes, The years with soundless feet and sounding wings? Passing we hear them not, but past The clamour of them thrills us, and their blast. Thou art chief of us, and lord; Thy song is as a sword Keen-edged and scented in the blade from flowers; Thou art lord and king; but we Lift younger eyes, and see Less of high hope, less light on wandering hours; Hours that have borne men down so long, Seen the right fail, and watched uplift the wrong. But thine imperial soul, As years and ruins roll To the same end, and all things and all dreams With the same wreck and roar Drift on the dim same shore, Still in the bitter foam and brackish streams Tracks the fresh water-spring to be And sudden sweeter fountains in the sea. As once the high God bound With many a rivet round Man's saviour, and with iron nailed him through, At the wild end of things, Where even his own bird's wings Flagged, whence the sea shone like a drop of dew, From Caucasus beheld below Past fathoms of unfathomable snow; So the strong God, the chance Central of circumstance, Still shows him exile who will not be slave; All thy great fame and thee Girt by the dim strait sea With multitudinous walls of wandering wave; Shows us our greatest from his throne Fate-stricken, and rejected of his own. Yea, he is strong, thou say'st, A mystery many-faced, The wild beasts know him and the wild birds flee; The blind night sees him, death Shrinks beaten at his breath, And his right hand is heavy on the sea: We know he hath made us, and is king; We know not if he care for anything. Thus much, no more, we know; He bade what is be so, Bade light be and bade night be, one by one; Bade hope and fear, bade ill And good redeem and kill, Till all men be aweary of the sun And his world burn in its own flame And bear no witness longer of his name. Yet though all this be thus, Be those men praised of us Who have loved and wrought and sorrowed and not sinned For fame or fear or gold, Nor waxed for winter cold, Nor changed for changes of the worldly wind; Praised above men of men be these, Till this one world and work we know shall cease. Yea, one thing more than this, We know that one thing is, The splendour of a spirit without blame, That not the labouring years Blind-born, nor any fears, Nor men nor any gods can tire or tame; But purer power with fiery breath Fills, and exalts above the gulfs of death Praised above men be thou, Whose laurel-laden brow, Made for the morning, droops not in the night; Praised and beloved, that none Of all thy great things done Flies higher than thy most equal spirit's flight; Praised, that nor doubt nor hope could bend Earth's loftiest head, found upright to the end. BEFORE DAWN Sweet life, if life were stronger, Earth clear of years that wrong her, Then two things might live longer, Two sweeter things than they; Delight, the rootless flower, And love, the bloomless bower; Delight that lives an hour, And love that lives a day. From evensong to daytime, When April melts in Maytime, Love lengthens out his playtime, Love lessens breath by breath, And kiss by kiss grows older On listless throat or shoulder Turned sideways now, turned colder Than life that dreams of death. This one thing once worth giving Life gave, and seemed worth living; Sin sweet beyond forgiving And brief beyond regret: To laugh and love together And weave with foam and feather And wind and words the tether Our memories play with yet. Ah, one thing worth beginning, One thread in life worth spinning, Ah sweet, one sin worth sinning With all the whole soul's will; To lull you till one stilled you, To kiss you till one killed you, To feed you till one filled you, Sweet lips, if love could fill; To hunt sweet Love and lose him Between white arms and bosom, Between the bud and blossom, Between your throat and chin; To say of shame—what is it? Of virtue—we can miss it, Of sin—we can but kiss it, And it's no longer sin: To feel the strong soul, stricken Through fleshly pulses, quicken Beneath swift sighs that thicken, Soft hands and lips that smite; Lips that no love can tire, With hands that sting like fire, Weaving the web Desire To snare the bird Delight. But love so lightly plighted, Our love with torch unlighted, Paused near us unaffrighted, Who found and left him free; None, seeing us cloven in sunder, Will weep or laugh or wonder; Light love stands clear of thunder, And safe from winds at sea. As, when late larks give warning Of dying lights and dawning, Night murmurs to the morning, “Lie still, O love, lie still;” And half her dark limbs cover The white limbs of her lover, With amorous plumes that hover And fervent lips that chill; As scornful day represses Night's void and vain caresses, And from her cloudier tresses Unwinds the gold of his, With limbs from limbs dividing And breath by breath subsiding; For love has no abiding, But dies before the kiss; So hath it been, so be it; For who shall live and flee it? But look that no man see it Or hear it unaware; Lest all who love and choose him See Love, and so refuse him; For all who find him lose him, But all have found him fair. DOLORES (NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS) Cold eyelids that hide like a jewel Hard eyes that grow soft for an hour; The heavy white limbs, and the cruel Red mouth like a venomous flower; When these are gone by with their glories, What shall rest of thee then, what remain, O mystic and sombre Dolores, Our Lady of Pain? Seven sorrows the priests give their Virgin; But thy sins, which are seventy times seven, Seven ages would fail thee to purge in, And then they would haunt thee in heaven: Fierce midnights and famishing morrows, And the loves that complete and control All the joys of the flesh, all the sorrows That wear out the soul. O garment not golden but gilded, O garden where all men may dwell, O tower not of ivory, but builded By hands that reach heaven from hell; O mystical rose of the mire, O house not of gold but of gain, O house of unquenchable fire, Our Lady of Pain! O lips full of lust and of laughter, Curled snakes that are fed from my breast, Bite hard, lest remembrance come after And press with new lips where you pressed. For my heart too springs up at the pressure, Mine eyelids too moisten and burn; Ah, feed me and fill me with pleasure, Ere pain come in turn. In yesterday's reach and to-morrow's, Out of sight though they lie of to-day, There have been and there yet shall be sorrows That smite not and bite not in play. The life and the love thou despisest, These hurt us indeed, and in vain, O wise among women, and wisest, Our Lady of Pain. Who gave thee thy wisdom? what stories That stung thee, what visions that smote? Wert thou pure and a maiden, Dolores, When desire took thee first by the throat? What bud was the shell of a blossom That all men may smell to and pluck? What milk fed thee first at what bosom? What sins gave thee suck? We shift and bedeck and bedrape us, Thou art noble and nude and antique; Libitina thy mother, Priapus Thy father, a Tuscan and Greek. We play with light loves in the portal, And wince and relent and refrain; Loves die, and we know thee immortal, Our Lady of Pain. Fruits fail and love dies and time ranges; Thou art fed with perpetual breath, And alive after infinite changes, And fresh from the kisses of death; Of languors rekindled and rallied, Of barren delights and unclean, Things monstrous and fruitless, a pallid And poisonous queen. Could you hurt me, sweet lips, though I hurt you? Men touch them, and change in a trice The lilies and languors of virtue For the raptures and roses of vice; Those lie where thy foot on the floor is, These crown and caress thee and chain, O splendid and sterile Dolores, Our Lady of Pain. There are sins it may be to discover, There are deeds it may be to delight. What new work wilt thou find for thy lover, What new passions for daytime or night? What spells that they know not a word of Whose lives are as leaves overblown? What tortures undreamt of, unheard of, Unwritten, unknown? Ah beautiful passionate body That never has ached with a heart! On thy mouth though the kisses are bloody, Though they sting till it shudder and smart, More kind than the love we adore is, They hurt not the heart or the brain, O bitter and tender Dolores, Our Lady of Pain. As our kisses relax and redouble, From the lips and the foam and the fangs Shall no new sin be born for men's trouble, No dream of impossible pangs? With the sweet of the sins of old ages Wilt thou satiate thy soul as of yore? Too sweet is the rind, say the sages, Too bitter the core. Hast thou told all thy secrets the last time, And bared all thy beauties to one? Ah, where shall we go then for pastime, If the worst that can be has been done? But sweet as the rind was the core is; We are fain of thee still, we are fain, O sanguine and subtle Dolores, Our Lady of Pain. By the hunger of change and emotion, By the thirst of unbearable things, By despair, the twin-born of devotion, By the pleasure that winces and stings, The delight that consumes the desire, The desire that outruns the delight, By the cruelty deaf as a fire And blind as the night, By the ravenous teeth that have smitten Through the kisses that blossom and bud, By the lips intertwisted and bitten Till the foam has a savour of blood, By the pulse as it rises and falters, By the hands as they slacken and strain, I adjure thee, respond from thine altars, Our Lady of Pain. Wilt thou smile as a woman disdaining The light fire in the veins of a boy? But he comes to thee sad, without feigning, Who has wearied of sorrow and joy; Less careful of labour and glory Than the elders whose hair has uncurled: And young, but with fancies as hoary And grey as the world. I have passed from the outermost portal To the shrine where a sin is a prayer; What care though the service be mortal? O our Lady of Torture, what care? All thine the last wine that I pour is, The last in the chalice we drain, O fierce and luxurious Dolores, Our Lady of Pain. All thine the new wine of desire, The fruit of four lips as they clung Till the hair and the eyelids took fire, The foam of a serpentine tongue, The froth of the serpents of pleasure, More salt than the foam of the sea, Now felt as a flame, now at leisure As wine shed for me. Ah thy people, thy children, thy chosen, Marked cross from the womb and perverse! They have found out the secret to cozen The gods that constrain us and curse; They alone, they are wise, and none other; Give me place, even me, in their train, O my sister, my spouse, and my mother, Our Lady of Pain. For the crown of our life as it closes Is darkness, the fruit thereof dust; No thorns go as deep as a rose's, And love is more cruel than lust. Time turns the old days to derision, Our loves into corpses or wives; And marriage and death and division Make barren our lives. And pale from the past we draw nigh thee, And satiate with comfortless hours; And we know thee, how all men belie thee, And we gather the fruit of thy flowers; The passion that slays and recovers, The pangs and the kisses that rain On the lips and the limbs of thy lovers, Our Lady of Pain. The desire of thy furious embraces Is more than the wisdom of years, On the blossom though blood lie in traces, Though the foliage be sodden with tears. For the lords in whose keeping the door is That opens on all who draw breath Gave the cypress to love, my Dolores, The myrtle to death. And they laughed, changing hands in the measure, And they mixed and made peace after strife; Pain melted in tears, and was pleasure; Death tingled with blood, and was life. Like lovers they melted and tingled, In the dusk of thine innermost fane; In the darkness they murmured and mingled, Our Lady of Pain. In a twilight where virtues are vices, In thy chapels, unknown of the sun, To a tune that enthralls and entices, They were wed, and the twain were as one. For the tune from thine altar hath sounded Since God bade the world's work begin, And the fume of thine incense abounded, To sweeten the sin. Love listens, and paler than ashes, Through his curls as the crown on them slips, Lifts languid wet eyelids and lashes, And laughs with insatiable lips. Thou shalt hush him with heavy caresses, With music that scares the profane; Thou shalt darken his eyes with thy tresses, Our Lady of Pain. Thou shalt blind his bright eyes though he wrestle, Thou shalt chain his light limbs though he strive; In his lips all thy serpents shall nestle, In his hands all thy cruelties thrive. In the daytime thy voice shall go through him, In his dreams he shall feel thee and ache; Thou shalt kindle by night and subdue him Asleep and awake. Thou shalt touch and make redder his roses With juice not of fruit nor of bud; When the sense in the spirit reposes, Thou shalt quicken the soul through the blood. Thine, thine the one grace we implore is, Who would live and not languish or feign, O sleepless and deadly Dolores, Our Lady of Pain. Dost thou dream, in a respite of slumber, In a lull of the fires of thy life, Of the days without name, without number, When thy will stung the world into strife; When, a goddess, the pulse of thy passion Smote kings as they revelled in Rome; And they hailed thee re-risen, O Thalassian, Foam-white, from the foam? When thy lips had such lovers to flatter; When the city lay red from thy rods, And thine hands were as arrows to scatter The children of change and their gods; When the blood of thy foemen made fervent A sand never moist from the main, As one smote them, their lord and thy servant, Our Lady of Pain. On sands by the storm never shaken, Nor wet from the washing of tides; Nor by foam of the waves overtaken, Nor winds that the thunder bestrides; But red from the print of thy paces, Made smooth for the world and its lords, Ringed round with a flame of fair faces, And splendid with swords. There the gladiator, pale for thy pleasure, Drew bitter and perilous breath; There torments laid hold on the treasure Of limbs too delicious for death; When thy gardens were lit with live torches; When the world was a steed for thy rein; When the nations lay prone in thy porches, Our Lady of Pain. When, with flame all around him aspirant, Stood flushed, as a harp-player stands, The implacable beautiful tyrant, Rose-crowned, having death in his hands; And a sound as the sound of loud water Smote far through the flight of the fires, And mixed with the lightning of slaughter A thunder of lyres. Dost thou dream of what was and no more is, The old kingdoms of earth and the kings? Dost thou hunger for these things, Dolores, For these, in a world of new things? But thy bosom no fasts could emaciate, No hunger compel to complain Those lips that no bloodshed could satiate, Our Lady of Pain. As of old when the world's heart was lighter, Through thy garments the grace of thee glows, The white wealth of thy body made whiter By the blushes of amorous blows, And seamed with sharp lips and fierce fingers, And branded by kisses that bruise; When all shall be gone that now lingers, Ah, what shall we lose? Thou wert fair in the fearless old fashion, And thy limbs are as melodies yet, And move to the music of passion With lithe and lascivious regret. What ailed us, O gods, to desert you For creeds that refuse and restrain? Come down and redeem us from virtue, Our Lady of Pain. All shrines that were Vestal are flameless, But the flame has not fallen from this; Though obscure be the god, and though nameless The eyes and the hair that we kiss; Low fires that love sits by and forges Fresh heads for his arrows and thine; Hair loosened and soiled in mid orgies With kisses and wine. Thy skin changes country and colour, And shrivels or swells to a snake's. Let it brighten and bloat and grow duller, We know it, the flames and the flakes, Red brands on it smitten and bitten, Round skies where a star is a stain, And the leaves with thy litanies written, Our Lady of Pain. On thy bosom though many a kiss be, There are none such as knew it of old. Was it Alciphron once or Arisbe, Male ringlets or feminine gold, That thy lips met with under the statue, Whence a look shot out sharp after thieves From the eyes of the garden-god at you Across the fig-leaves? Then still, through dry seasons and moister, One god had a wreath to his shrine; Then love was the pearl of his oyster, Nam te præcipuè in suis urbibus colit ora Hellespontia, cæteris ostreosior oris. Catull. Carm. xviii. And Venus rose red out of wine. We have all done amiss, choosing rather Such loves as the wise gods disdain; Intercede for us thou with thy father, Our Lady of Pain. In spring he had crowns of his garden, Red corn in the heat of the year, Then hoary green olives that harden When the grape-blossom freezes with fear; And milk-budded myrtles with Venus And vine-leaves with Bacchus he trod; And ye said, “We have seen, he hath seen us, A visible God.” What broke off the garlands that girt you? What sundered you spirit and clay? Weak sins yet alive are as virtue To the strength of the sins of that day. For dried is the blood of thy lover, Ipsithilla, contracted the vein; Cry aloud, “Will he rise and recover, Our Lady of Pain?” Cry aloud; for the old world is broken: Cry out; for the Phrygian is priest, And rears not the bountiful token And spreads not the fatherly feast. From the midmost of Ida, from shady Recesses that murmur at morn, They have brought and baptized her, Our Lady, A goddess new-born. And the chaplets of old are above us, And the oyster-bed teems out of reach; Old poets outsing and outlove us, And Catullus makes mouths at our speech. Who shall kiss, in thy father's own city, With such lips as he sang with, again? Intercede for us all of thy pity, Our Lady of Pain. Out of Dindymus heavily laden Her lions draw bound and unfed A mother, a mortal, a maiden, A queen over death and the dead. She is cold, and her habit is lowly, Her temple of branches and sods; Most fruitful and virginal, holy, A mother of gods. She hath wasted with fire thine high places, She hath hidden and marred and made sad The fair limbs of the Loves, the fair faces Of gods that were goodly and glad. She slays, and her hands are not bloody; She moves as a moon in the wane, White-robed, and thy raiment is ruddy, Our Lady of Pain. They shall pass and their places be taken, The gods and the priests that are pure. They shall pass, and shalt thou not be shaken? They shall perish, and shalt thou endure? Death laughs, breathing close and relentless In the nostrils and eyelids of lust, With a pinch in his fingers of scentless And delicate dust. But the worm shall revive thee with kisses; Thou shalt change and transmute as a god, As the rod to a serpent that hisses, As the serpent again to a rod. Thy life shall not cease though thou doff it; Thou shalt live until evil be slain, And good shall die first, said thy prophet, Our Lady of Pain. Did he lie? did he laugh? does he know it, Now he lies out of reach, out of breath, Thy prophet, thy preacher, thy poet, Sin's child by incestuous Death? Did he find out in fire at his waking, Or discern as his eyelids lost light, When the bands of the body were breaking And all came in sight? Who has known all the evil before us, Or the tyrannous secrets of time? Though we match not the dead men that bore us At a song, at a kiss, at a crime— Though the heathen outface and outlive us, And our lives and our longings are twain— Ah, forgive us our virtues, forgive us, Our Lady of Pain. Who are we that embalm and embrace thee With spices and savours of song? What is time, that his children should face thee? What am I, that my lips do thee wrong? I could hurt thee—but pain would delight thee; Or caress thee—but love would repel; And the lovers whose lips would excite thee Are serpents in hell. Who now shall content thee as they did, Thy lovers, when temples were built And the hair of the sacrifice braided And the blood of the sacrifice spilt, In Lampsacus fervent with faces, In Aphaca red from thy reign, Who embraced thee with awful embraces, Our Lady of Pain? Where are they, Cotytto or Venus, Astarte or Ashtaroth, where? Do their hands as we touch come between us? Is the breath of them hot in thy hair? From their lips have thy lips taken fever, With the blood of their bodies grown red? Hast thou left upon earth a believer If these men are dead? They were purple of raiment and golden, Filled full of thee, fiery with wine, Thy lovers, in haunts unbeholden, In marvellous chambers of thine. They are fled, and their footprints escape us, Who appraise thee, adore, and abstain, O daughter of Death and Priapus, Our Lady of Pain. What ails us to fear overmeasure, To praise thee with timorous breath, O mistress and mother of pleasure, The one thing as certain as death? We shall change as the things that we cherish, Shall fade as they faded before, As foam upon water shall perish, As sand upon shore. We shall know what the darkness discovers, If the grave-pit be shallow or deep; And our fathers of old, and our lovers, We shall know if they sleep not or sleep. We shall see whether hell be not heaven, Find out whether tares be not grain, And the joys of thee seventy times seven, Our Lady of Pain. THE GARDEN OF PROSERPINE Here, where the world is quiet; Here, where all trouble seems Dead winds' and spent waves' riot In doubtful dreams of dreams; I watch the green field growing For reaping folk and sowing, For harvest-time and mowing, A sleepy world of streams. I am tired of tears and laughter, And men that laugh and weep; Of what may come hereafter For men that sow to reap: I am weary of days and hours, Blown buds of barren flowers, Desires and dreams and powers And everything but sleep. Here life has death for neighbour, And far from eye or ear Wan waves and wet winds labour, Weak ships and spirits steer; They drive adrift, and whither They wot not who make thither; But no such winds blow hither, And no such things grow here. No growth of moor or coppice, No heather-flower or vine, But bloomless buds of poppies, Green grapes of Proserpine, Pale beds of blowing rushes Where no leaf blooms or blushes Save this whereout she crushes For dead men deadly wine. Pale, without name or number, In fruitless fields of corn, They bow themselves and slumber All night till light is born; And like a soul belated, In hell and heaven unmated, By cloud and mist abated Comes out of darkness morn. Though one were strong as seven, He too with death shall dwell, Nor wake with wings in heaven, Nor weep for pains in hell; Though one were fair as roses, His beauty clouds and closes; And well though love reposes, In the end it is not well. Pale, beyond porch and portal, Crowned with calm leaves, she stands Who gathers all things mortal With cold immortal hands; Her languid lips are sweeter Than love's who fears to greet her To men that mix and meet her From many times and lands. She waits for each and other, She waits for all men born; Forgets the earth her mother, The life of fruits and corn; And spring and seed and swallow Take wing for her and follow Where summer song rings hollow And flowers are put to scorn. There go the loves that wither, The old loves with wearier wings; And all dead years draw thither, And all disastrous things; Dead dreams of days forsaken, Blind buds that snows have shaken, Wild leaves that winds have taken, Red strays of ruined springs. We are not sure of sorrow, And joy was never sure; To-day will die to-morrow; Time stoops to no man's lure; And love, grown faint and fretful, With lips but half regretful Sighs, and with eyes forgetful Weeps that no loves endure. From too much love of living, From hope and fear set free, We thank with brief thanksgiving Whatever gods may be That no life lives for ever; That dead men rise up never; That even the weariest river Winds somewhere safe to sea. Then star nor sun shall waken, Nor any change of light: Nor sound of waters shaken, Nor any sound or sight: Nor wintry leaves nor vernal, Nor days nor things diurnal; Only the sleep eternal In an eternal night. HESPERIA Out of the golden remote wild west where the sea without shore is, Full of the sunset, and sad, if at all, with the fulness of joy, As a wind sets in with the autumn that blows from the region of stories, Blows with a perfume of songs and of memories beloved from a boy, Blows from the capes of the past oversea to the bays of the present, Filled as with shadow of sound with the pulse of invisible feet, Far out to the shallows and straits of the future, by rough ways or pleasant, Is it thither the wind's wings beat? is it hither to me, O my sweet? For thee, in the stream of the deep tide-wind blowing in with the water, Thee I behold as a bird borne in with the wind from the west, Straight from the sunset, across white waves whence rose as a daughter Venus thy mother, in years when the world was a water at rest. Out of the distance of dreams, as a dream that abides after slumber, Strayed from the fugitive flock of the night, when the moon overhead Wanes in the wan waste heights of the heaven, and stars without number Die without sound, and are spent like lamps that are burnt by the dead, Comes back to me, stays by me, lulls me with touch of forgotten caresses, One warm dream clad about with a fire as of life that endures; The delight of thy face, and the sound of thy feet, and the wind of thy tresses, And all of a man that regrets, and all of a maid that allures. But thy bosom is warm for my face and profound as a manifold flower, Thy silence as music, thy voice as an odour that fades in a flame; Not a dream, not a dream is the kiss of thy mouth, and the bountiful hour That makes me forget what was sin, and would make me forget were it shame. Thine eyes that are quiet, thine hands that are tender, thy lips that are loving, Comfort and cool me as dew in the dawn of a moon like a dream; And my heart yearns baffled and blind, moved vainly toward thee, and moving As the refluent seaweed moves in the languid exuberant stream, Fair as a rose is on earth, as a rose under water in prison, That stretches and swings to the slow passionate pulse of the sea, Closed up from the air and the sun, but alive, as a ghost rearisen, Pale as the love that revives as a ghost rearisen in me. From the bountiful infinite west, from the happy memorial places Full of the stately repose and the lordly delight of the dead, Where the fortunate islands are lit with the light of ineffable faces, And the sound of a sea without wind is about them, and sunset is red, Come back to redeem and release me from love that recalls and represses, That cleaves to my flesh as a flame, till the serpent has eaten his fill; From the bitter delights of the dark, and the feverish, the furtive caresses That murder the youth in a man or ever his heart have its will. Thy lips cannot laugh and thine eyes cannot weep; thou art pale as a rose is, Paler and sweeter than leaves that cover the blush of the bud; And the heart of the flower is compassion, and pity the core it encloses, Pity, not love, that is born of the breath and decays with the blood. As the cross that a wild nun clasps till the edge of it bruises her bosom, So love wounds as we grasp it, and blackens and burns as a flame; I have loved overmuch in my life; when the live bud bursts with the blossom, Bitter as ashes or tears is the fruit, and the wine thereof shame. As a heart that its anguish divides is the green bud cloven asunder; As the blood of a man self-slain is the flush of the leaves that allure; And the perfume as poison and wine to the brain, a delight and a wonder; And the thorns are too sharp for a boy, too slight for a man, to endure. Too soon did I love it, and lost love's rose; and I cared not for glory's: Only the blossoms of sleep and of pleasure were mixed in my hair. Was it myrtle or poppy thy garland was woven with, O my Dolores? Was it pallor of slumber, or blush as of blood, that I found in thee fair? For desire is a respite from love, and the flesh not the heart is her fuel; She was sweet to me once, who am fled and escaped from the rage of her reign; Who behold as of old time at hand as I turn, with her mouth growing cruel, And flushed as with wine with the blood of her lovers, Our Lady of Pain. Low down where the thicket is thicker with thorns than with leaves in the summer, In the brake is a gleaming of eyes and a hissing of tongues that I knew; And the lithe long throats of her snakes reach round her, their mouths overcome her, And her lips grow cool with their foam, made moist as a desert with dew. With the thirst and the hunger of lust though her beautiful lips be so bitter, With the cold foul foam of the snakes they soften and redden and smile; And her fierce mouth sweetens, her eyes wax wide and her eyelashes glitter, And she laughs with a savour of blood in her face, and a savour of guile. She laughs, and her hands reach hither, her hair blows hither and hisses, As a low-lit flame in a wind, back-blown till it shudder and leap; Let her lips not again lay hold on my soul, nor her poisonous kisses, To consume it alive and divide from thy bosom, Our Lady of Sleep. Ah daughter of sunset and slumber, if now it return into prison, Who shall redeem it anew? but we, if thou wilt, let us fly; Let us take to us, now that the white skies thrill with a moon unarisen, Swift horses of fear or of love, take flight and depart and not die. They are swifter than dreams, they are stronger than death; there is none that hath ridden, None that shall ride in the dim strange ways of his life as we ride; By the meadows of memory, the highlands of hope, and the shore that is hidden, Where life breaks loud and unseen, a sonorous invisible tide; By the sands where sorrow has trodden, the salt pools bitter and sterile, By the thundering reef and the low sea-wall and the channel of years, Our wild steeds press on the night, strain hard through pleasure and peril, Labour and listen and pant not or pause for the peril that nears; And the sound of them trampling the way cleaves night as an arrow asunder, And slow by the sand-hill and swift by the down with its glimpses of grass, Sudden and steady the music, as eight hoofs trample and thunder, Rings in the ear of the low blind wind of the night as we pass; Shrill shrieks in our faces the blind bland air that was mute as a maiden, Stung into storm by the speed of our passage, and deaf where we past; And our spirits too burn as we bound, thine holy but mine heavy-laden, As we burn with the fire of our flight; ah love, shall we win at the last? LOVE AT SEA We are in love's land to-day; Where shall we go? Love, shall we start or stay, Or sail or row? There's many a wind and way, And never a May but May; We are in love's hand to-day; Where shall we go? Our landwind is the breath Of sorrows kissed to death And joys that were; Our ballast is a rose; Our way lies where God knows And love knows where. We are in love's hand to-day— Our seamen are fledged Loves, Our masts are bills of doves, Our decks fine gold; Our ropes are dead maids' hair, Our stores are love-shafts fair And manifold. We are in love's land to-day— Where shall we land you, sweet? On fields of strange men's feet, Or fields near home? Or where the fire-flowers blow, Or where the flowers of snow Or flowers of foam? We are in love's hand to-day— Land me, she says, where love Shows but one shaft, one dove, One heart, one hand. —A shore like that, my dear, Lies where no man will steer, No maiden land. Imitated from Théophile Gautier. APRIL 12??? FROM THE FRENCH OF THE VIDAME DE CHARTRES When the fields catch flower And the underwood is green, And from bower unto bower The songs of the birds begin, I sing with sighing between. When I laugh and sing, I am heavy at heart for my sin; I am sad in the spring For my love that I shall not win, For a foolish thing. This profit I have of my woe, That I know, as I sing, I know he will needs have it so Who is master and king, Who is lord of the spirit of spring. I will serve her and will not spare Till her pity awake Who is good, who is pure, who is fair, Even her for whose sake Love hath ta'en me and slain unaware. O my lord, O Love, I have laid my life at thy feet; Have thy will thereof, Do as it please thee with it, For what shall please thee is sweet. I am come unto thee To do thee service, O Love; Yet cannot I see Thou wilt take any pity thereof, Any mercy on me. But the grace I have long time sought Comes never in sight, If in her it abideth not, Through thy mercy and might, Whose heart is the world's delight. Thou hast sworn without fail I shall die, For my heart is set On what hurts me, I wot not why, But cannot forget What I love, what I sing for and sigh. She is worthy of praise, For this grief of her giving is worth All the joy of my days That lie between death's day and birth, All the lordship of things upon earth. Nay, what have I said? I would not be glad if I could; My dream and my dread Are of her, and for her sake I would That my life were fled. Lo, sweet, if I durst not pray to you, Then were I dead; If I sang not a little to say to you, (Could it be said) O my love, how my heart would be fed; Ah sweet who hast hold of my heart, For thy love's sake I live, Do but tell me, ere either depart, What a lover may give For a woman so fair as thou art. The lovers that disbelieve, False rumours shall grieve And evil-speaking shall part. BEFORE PARTING A month or twain to live on honeycomb Is pleasant; but one tires of scented time, Cold sweet recurrence of accepted rhyme, And that strong purple under juice and foam Where the wine's heart has burst; Nor feel the latter kisses like the first. Once yet, this poor one time; I will not pray Even to change the bitterness of it, The bitter taste ensuing on the sweet, To make your tears fall where your soft hair lay All blurred and heavy in some perfumed wise Over my face and eyes. And yet who knows what end the scythèd wheat Makes of its foolish poppies' mouths of red? These were not sown, these are not harvested, They grow a month and are cast under feet And none has care thereof, As none has care of a divided love. I know each shadow of your lips by rote, Each change of love in eyelids and eyebrows; The fashion of fair temples tremulous With tender blood, and colour of your throat; I know not how love is gone out of this, Seeing that all was his. Love's likeness there endures upon all these: But out of these one shall not gather love. Day hath not strength nor the night shade enough To make love whole and fill his lips with ease, As some bee-builded cell Feels at filled lips the heavy honey swell. I know not how this last month leaves your hair Less full of purple colour and hid spice, And that luxurious trouble of closed eyes Is mixed with meaner shadow and waste care; And love, kissed out by pleasure, seems not yet Worth patience to regret. THE SUNDEW A little marsh-plant, yellow green, And pricked at lip with tender red. Tread close, and either way you tread Some faint black water jets between Lest you should bruise the curious head. A live thing maybe; who shall know? The summer knows and suffers it; For the cool moss is thick and sweet Each side, and saves the blossom so That it lives out the long June heat. The deep scent of the heather burns About it; breathless though it be, Bow down and worship; more than we Is the least flower whose life returns, Least weed renascent in the sea. We are vexed and cumbered in earth's sight With wants, with many memories; These see their mother what she is, Glad-growing, till August leave more bright The apple-coloured cranberries. Wind blows and bleaches the strong grass, Blown all one way to shelter it From trample of strayed kine, with feet Felt heavier than the moorhen was, Strayed up past patches of wild wheat. You call it sundew: how it grows, If with its colour it have breath, If life taste sweet to it, if death Pain its soft petal, no man knows: Man has no sight or sense that saith. My sundew, grown of gentle days, In these green miles the spring begun Thy growth ere April had half done With the soft secret of her ways Or June made ready for the sun. O red-lipped mouth of marsh-flower, I have a secret halved with thee. The name that is love's name to me Thou knowest, and the face of her Who is my festival to see. The hard sun, as thy petals knew, Coloured the heavy moss-water: Thou wert not worth green midsummer Nor fit to live to August blue, O sundew, not remembering her. FÉLISE Mais où sont les neiges d'antan? What shall be said between us here Among the downs, between the trees, In fields that knew our feet last year, In sight of quiet sands and seas, This year, Félise? Who knows what word were best to say? For last year's leaves lie dead and red On this sweet day, in this green May, And barren corn makes bitter bread. What shall be said? Here as last year the fields begin, A fire of flowers and glowing grass; The old fields we laughed and lingered in, Seeing each our souls in last year's glass, Félise, alas! Shall we not laugh, shall we not weep, Not we, though this be as it is? For love awake or love asleep Ends in a laugh, a dream, a kiss, A song like this. I that have slept awake, and you Sleep, who last year were well awake. Though love do all that love can do, My heart will never ache or break For your heart's sake. The great sea, faultless as a flower, Throbs, trembling under beam and breeze, And laughs with love of the amorous hour. I found you fairer once, Félise, Than flowers or seas. We played at bondsman and at queen; But as the days change men change too; I find the grey sea's notes of green, The green sea's fervent flakes of blue, More fair than you. Your beauty is not over fair Now in mine eyes, who am grown up wise. The smell of flowers in all your hair Allures not now; no sigh replies If your heart sighs. But you sigh seldom, you sleep sound, You find love's new name good enough. Less sweet I find it than I found The sweetest name that ever love Grew weary of. My snake with bright bland eyes, my snake Grown tame and glad to be caressed, With lips athirst for mine to slake Their tender fever! who had guessed You loved me best? I had died for this last year, to know You loved me. Who shall turn on fate? I care not if love come or go Now, though your love seek mine for mate. It is too late. The dust of many strange desires Lies deep between us; in our eyes Dead smoke of perishable fires Flickers, a fume in air and skies, A steam of sighs. You loved me and you loved me not; A little, much, and overmuch. Will you forget as I forgot? Let all dead things lie dead; none such Are soft to touch. I love you and I do not love, Too much, a little, not at all; Too much, and never yet enough. Birds quick to fledge and fly at call Are quick to fall. And these love longer now than men, And larger loves than ours are these. No diver brings up love again Dropped once, my beautiful Félise, In such cold seas. Gone deeper than all plummets sound, Where in the dim green dayless day The life of such dead things lies bound As the sea feeds on, wreck and stray And castaway. Can I forget? yea, that can I, And that can all men; so will you, Alive, or later, when you die. Ah, but the love you plead was true? Was mine not too? I loved you for that name of yours Long ere we met, and long enough. Now that one thing of all endures— The sweetest name that ever love Waxed weary of. Like colours in the sea, like flowers, Like a cat's splendid circled eyes That wax and wane with love for hours, Green as green flame, blue-grey like skies, And soft like sighs— And all these only like your name, And your name full of all of these. I say it, and it sounds the same— Save that I say it now at ease, Your name, Félise. I said “she must be swift and white, And subtly warm, and half perverse, And sweet like sharp soft fruit to bite, And like a snake's love lithe and fierce.” Men have guessed worse. What was the song I made of you Here where the grass forgets our feet As afternoon forgets the dew? Ah that such sweet things should be fleet, Such fleet things sweet! As afternoon forgets the dew, As time in time forgets all men, As our old place forgets us two, Who might have turned to one thing then But not again. O lips that mine have grown into Like April's kissing May, O fervent eyelids letting through Those eyes the greenest of things blue, The bluest of things grey, If you were I and I were you, How could I love you, say? How could the roseleaf love the rue, The day love nightfall and her dew, Though night may love the day? You loved it may be more than I; We know not; love is hard to seize. And all things are not good to try; And lifelong loves the worst of these For us, Félise. Ah, take the season and have done, Love well the hour and let it go: Two souls may sleep and wake up one, Or dream they wake and find it so, And then—you know. Kiss me once hard as though a flame Lay on my lips and made them fire; The same lips now, and not the same; What breath shall fill and re-inspire A dead desire? The old song sounds hollower in mine ear Than thin keen sounds of dead men's speech— A noise one hears and would not hear; Too strong to die, too weak to reach From wave to beach. We stand on either side the sea, Stretch hands, blow kisses, laugh and lean I toward you, you toward me; But what hears either save the keen Grey sea between? A year divides us, love from love, Though you love now, though I loved then. The gulf is strait, but deep enough; Who shall recross, who among men Shall cross again? Love was a jest last year, you said, And what lives surely, surely dies. Even so; but now that love is dead, Shall love rekindle from wet eyes, From subtle sighs? For many loves are good to see; Mutable loves, and loves perverse; But there is nothing, nor shall be, So sweet, so wicked, but my verse Can dream of worse. For we that sing and you that love Know that which man may, only we. The rest live under us; above, Live the great gods in heaven, and see What things shall be. So this thing is and must be so; For man dies, and love also dies. Though yet love's ghost moves to and fro The sea-green mirrors of your eyes, And laughs, and lies. Eyes coloured like a water-flower, And deeper than the green sea's glass; Eyes that remember one sweet hour— In vain we swore it should not pass; In vain, alas! Ah my Félise, if love or sin, If shame or fear could hold it fast, Should we not hold it? Love wears thin, And they laugh well who laugh the last. Is it not past? The gods, the gods are stronger; time Falls down before them, all men's knees Bow, all men's prayers and sorrows climb Like incense towards them; yea, for these Are gods, Félise. Immortal are they, clothed with powers, Not to be comforted at all; Lords over all the fruitless hours; Too great to appease, too high to appal, Too far to call. For none shall move the most high gods, Who are most sad, being cruel; none Shall break or take away the rods Wherewith they scourge us, not as one That smites a son. By many a name of many a creed We have called upon them, since the sands Fell through time's hour-glass first, a seed Of life; and out of many lands Have we stretched hands. When have they heard us? who hath known Their faces, climbed unto their feet, Felt them and found them? Laugh or groan, Doth heaven remurmur and repeat Sad sounds or sweet? Do the stars answer? in the night Have ye found comfort? or by day Have ye seen gods? What hope, what light, Falls from the farthest starriest way On you that pray? Are the skies wet because we weep, Or fair because of any mirth? Cry out; they are gods; perchance they sleep; Cry; thou shalt know what prayers are worth, Thou dust and earth. O earth, thou art fair; O dust, thou art great; O laughing lips and lips that mourn, Pray, till ye feel the exceeding weight Of God's intolerable scorn, Not to be borne. Behold, there is no grief like this; The barren blossom of thy prayer, Thou shalt find out how sweet it is. O fools and blind, what seek ye there, High up in the air? Ye must have gods, the friends of men, Merciful gods, compassionate, And these shall answer you again. Will ye beat always at the gate, Ye fools of fate? Ye fools and blind; for this is sure, That all ye shall not live, but die. Lo, what thing have ye found endure? Or what thing have ye found on high Past the blind sky? The ghosts of words and dusty dreams, Old memories, faiths infirm and dead. Ye fools; for which among you deems His prayer can alter green to red Or stones to bread? Why should ye bear with hopes and fears Till all these things be drawn in one, The sound of iron-footed years, And all the oppression that is done Under the sun? Ye might end surely, surely pass Out of the multitude of things, Under the dust, beneath the grass, Deep in dim death, where no thought stings, No record clings. No memory more of love or hate, No trouble, nothing that aspires, No sleepless labour thwarting fate, And thwarted; where no travail tires, Where no faith fires. All passes, nought that has been is, Things good and evil have one end. Can anything be otherwise Though all men swear all things would mend With God to friend? Can ye beat off one wave with prayer, Can ye move mountains? bid the flower Take flight and turn to a bird in the air? Can ye hold fast for shine or shower One wingless hour? Ah sweet, and we too, can we bring One sigh back, bid one smile revive? Can God restore one ruined thing, Or he who slays our souls alive Make dead things thrive? Two gifts perforce he has given us yet, Though sad things stay and glad things fly; Two gifts he has given us, to forget All glad and sad things that go by, And then to die. We know not whether death be good, But life at least it will not be: Men will stand saddening as we stood, Watch the same fields and skies as we And the same sea. Let this be said between us here, One love grows green when one turns grey; This year knows nothing of last year; To-morrow has no more to say To yesterday. Live and let live, as I will do, Love and let love, and so will I. But, sweet, for me no more with you: Not while I live, not though I die. Goodnight, goodbye. AN INTERLUDE In the greenest growth of the Maytime, I rode where the woods were wet, Between the dawn and the daytime; The spring was glad that we met. There was something the season wanted, Though the ways and the woods smelt sweet; The breath at your lips that panted, The pulse of the grass at your feet. You came, and the sun came after, And the green grew golden above; And the flag-flowers lightened with laughter, And the meadow-sweet shook with love. Your feet in the full-grown grasses Moved soft as a weak wind blows; You passed me as April passes, With face made out of a rose. By the stream where the stems were slender, Your bright foot paused at the sedge; It might be to watch the tender Light leaves in the springtime hedge, On boughs that the sweet month blanches With flowery frost of May: It might be a bird in the branches, It might be a thorn in the way. I waited to watch you linger With foot drawn back from the dew, Till a sunbeam straight like a finger Struck sharp through the leaves at you. And a bird overhead sang Follow, And a bird to the right sang Here; And the arch of the leaves was hollow, And the meaning of May was clear. I saw where the sun's hand pointed, I knew what the bird's note said; By the dawn and the dewfall anointed, You were queen by the gold on your head. As the glimpse of a burnt-out ember Recalls a regret of the sun, I remember, forget, and remember What Love saw done and undone. I remember the way we parted, The day and the way we met; You hoped we were both broken-hearted, And knew we should both forget. And May with her world in flower Seemed still to murmur and smile As you murmured and smiled for an hour; I saw you turn at the stile. A hand like a white wood-blossom You lifted, and waved, and passed, With head hung down to the bosom, And pale, as it seemed, at last. And the best and the worst of this is That neither is most to blame If you've forgotten my kisses And I've forgotten your name. HENDECASYLLABICS In the month of the long decline of roses I, beholding the summer dead before me, Set my face to the sea and journeyed silent, Gazing eagerly where above the sea-mark Flame as fierce as the fervid eyes of lions Half divided the eyelids of the sunset; Till I heard as it were a noise of waters Moving tremulous under feet of angels Multitudinous, out of all the heavens; Knew the fluttering wind, the fluttered foliage, Shaken fitfully, full of sound and shadow; And saw, trodden upon by noiseless angels, Long mysterious reaches fed with moonlight, Sweet sad straits in a soft subsiding channel, Blown about by the lips of winds I knew not, Winds not born in the north nor any quarter, Winds not warm with the south nor any sunshine; Heard between them a voice of exultation, “Lo, the summer is dead, the sun is faded, Even like as a leaf the year is withered, All the fruits of the day from all her branches Gathered, neither is any left to gather. All the flowers are dead, the tender blossoms, All are taken away; the season wasted, Like an ember among the fallen ashes. Now with light of the winter days, with moonlight, Light of snow, and the bitter light of hoarfrost, We bring flowers that fade not after autumn, Pale white chaplets and crowns of latter seasons, Fair false leaves (but the summer leaves were falser), Woven under the eyes of stars and planets When low light was upon the windy reaches Where the flower of foam was blown, a lily Dropt among the sonorous fruitless furrows And green fields of the sea that make no pasture: Since the winter begins, the weeping winter, All whose flowers are tears, and round his temples Iron blossom of frost is bound for ever.” SAPPHICS All the night sleep came not upon my eyelids, Shed not dew, nor shook nor unclosed a feather, Yet with lips shut close and with eyes of iron Stood and beheld me. Then to me so lying awake a vision Came without sleep over the seas and touched me, Softly touched mine eyelids and lips; and I too, Full of the vision, Saw the white implacable Aphrodite, Saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled Shine as fire of sunset on western waters; Saw the reluctant Feet, the straining plumes of the doves that drew her, Looking always, looking with necks reverted, Back to Lesbos, back to the hills whereunder Shone Mitylene; Heard the flying feet of the Loves behind her Make a sudden thunder upon the waters, As the thunder flung from the strong unclosing Wings of a great wind. So the goddess fled from her place, with awful Sound of feet and thunder of wings around her; While behind a clamour of singing women Severed the twilight. Ah the singing, ah the delight, the passion! All the Loves wept, listening; sick with anguish, Stood the crowned nine Muses about Apollo; Fear was upon them, While the tenth sang wonderful things they knew not. Ah the tenth, the Lesbian! the nine were silent, None endured the sound of her song for weeping; Laurel by laurel, Faded all their crowns; but about her forehead, Round her woven tresses and ashen temples White as dead snow, paler than grass in summer, Ravaged with kisses, Shone a light of fire as a crown for ever. Yea, almost the implacable Aphrodite Paused, and almost wept; such a song was that song. Yea, by her name too Called her, saying, “Turn to me, O my Sappho;” Yet she turned her face from the Loves, she saw not Tears for laughter darken immortal eyelids, Heard not about her Fearful fitful wings of the doves departing, Saw not how the bosom of Aphrodite Shook with weeping, saw not her shaken raiment, Saw not her hands wrung; Saw the Lesbians kissing across their smitten Lutes with lips more sweet than the sound of lute-strings, Mouth to mouth and hand upon hand, her chosen, Fairer than all men; Only saw the beautiful lips and fingers, Full of songs and kisses and little whispers, Full of music; only beheld among them Soar, as a bird soars Newly fledged, her visible song, a marvel, Made of perfect sound and exceeding passion, Sweetly shapen, terrible, full of thunders, Clothed with the wind's wings. Then rejoiced she, laughing with love, and scattered Roses, awful roses of holy blossom; Then the Loves thronged sadly with hidden faces Round Aphrodite, Then the Muses, stricken at heart, were silent; Yea, the gods waxed pale; such a song was that song. All reluctant, all with a fresh repulsion, Fled from before her. All withdrew long since, and the land was barren, Full of fruitless women and music only. Now perchance, when winds are assuaged at sunset, Lulled at the dewfall, By the grey sea-side, unassuaged, unheard of, Unbeloved, unseen in the ebb of twilight, Ghosts of outcast women return lamenting, Purged not in Lethe, Clothed about with flame and with tears, and singing Songs that move the heart of the shaken heaven, Songs that break the heart of the earth with pity, Hearing, to hear them. AT ELEUSIS Men of Eleusis, ye that with long staves Sit in the market-houses, and speak words Made sweet with wisdom as the rare wine is Thickened with honey; and ye sons of these Who in the glad thick streets go up and down For pastime or grave traffic or mere chance; And all fair women having rings of gold On hands or hair; and chiefest over these I name you, daughters of this man the king, Who dipping deep smooth pitchers of pure brass Under the bubbled wells, till each round lip Stooped with loose gurgle of waters incoming, Found me an old sick woman, lamed and lean, Beside a growth of builded olive-boughs Whence multiplied thick song of thick-plumed throats— Also wet tears filled up my hollow hands By reason of my crying into them— And pitied me; for as cold water ran And washed the pitchers full from lip to lip, So washed both eyes full the strong salt of tears. And ye put water to my mouth, made sweet With brown hill-berries; so in time I spoke And gathered my loose knees from under me. Moreover in the broad fair halls this month Have I found space and bountiful abode To please me. I Demeter speak of this, Who am the mother and the mate of things: For as ill men by drugs or singing words Shut the doors inward of the narrowed womb Like a lock bolted with round iron through, Thus I shut up the body and sweet mouth Of all soft pasture and the tender land, So that no seed can enter in by it Though one sow thickly, nor some grain get out Past the hard clods men cleave and bite with steel To widen the sealed lips of them for use. None of you is there in the peopled street But knows how all the dry-drawn furrows ache With no green spot made count of in the black: How the wind finds no comfortable grass Nor is assuaged with bud nor breath of herbs; And in hot autumn when ye house the stacks, All fields are helpless in the sun, all trees Stand as a man stripped out of all but skin. Nevertheless ye sick have help to get By means and stablished ordinance of God; For God is wiser than a good man is. But never shall new grass be sweet in earth Till I get righted of my wound and wrong By changing counsel of ill-minded Zeus. For of all other gods is none save me Clothed with like power to build and break the year. I make the lesser green begin, when spring Touches not earth but with one fearful foot; And as a careful gilder with grave art Soberly colours and completes the face, Mouth, chin and all, of some sweet work in stone, I carve the shapes of grass and tender corn And colour the ripe edges and long spikes With the red increase and the grace of gold. No tradesman in soft wools is cunninger To kill the secret of the fat white fleece With stains of blue and purple wrought in it. Three moons were made and three moons burnt away While I held journey hither out of Crete Comfortless, tended by grave Hecate Whom my wound stung with double iron point; For all my face was like a cloth wrung out With close and weeping wrinkles, and both lids Sodden with salt continuance of tears. For Hades and the sidelong will of Zeus And that lame wisdom that has writhen feet, Cunning, begotten in the bed of Shame, These three took evil will at me, and made Such counsel that when time got wing to fly This Hades out of summer and low fields Forced the bright body of Persephone: Out of pure grass, where she lying down, red flowers Made their sharp little shadows on her sides, Pale heat, pale colour on pale maiden flesh— And chill water slid over her reddening feet, Killing the throbs in their soft blood; and birds, Perched next her elbow and pecking at her hair, Stretched their necks more to see her than even to sing. A sharp thing is it I have need to say; For Hades holding both white wrists of hers Unloosed the girdle and with knot by knot Bound her between his wheels upon the seat, Bound her pure body, holiest yet and dear To me and God as always, clothed about With blossoms loosened as her knees went down, Let fall as she let go of this and this By tens and twenties, tumbled to her feet, White waifs or purple of the pasturage. Therefore with only going up and down My feet were wasted, and the gracious air, To me discomfortable and dun, became As weak smoke blowing in the under world. And finding in the process of ill days What part had Zeus herein, and how as mate He coped with Hades, yokefellow in sin, I set my lips against the meat of gods And drank not neither ate or slept in heaven. Nor in the golden greeting of their mouths Did ear take note of me, nor eye at all Track my feet going in the ways of them. Like a great fire on some strait slip of land Between two washing inlets of wet sea That burns the grass up to each lip of beach And strengthens, waxing in the growth of wind, So burnt my soul in me at heaven and earth, Each way a ruin and a hungry plague, Visible evil; nor could any night Put cool between mine eyelids, nor the sun With competence of gold fill out my want. Yea so my flame burnt up the grass and stones, Shone to the salt-white edges of thin sea, Distempered all the gracious work, and made Sick change, unseasonable increase of days And scant avail of seasons; for by this The fair gods faint in hollow heaven: there comes No taste of burnings of the twofold fat To leave their palates smooth, nor in their lips Soft rings of smoke and weak scent wandering; All cattle waste and rot, and their ill smell Grows alway from the lank unsavoury flesh That no man slays for offering; the sea And waters moved beneath the heath and corn Preserve the people of fin-twinkling fish, And river-flies feed thick upon the smooth; But all earth over is no man or bird (Except the sweet race of the kingfisher) That lacks not and is wearied with much loss. Meantime the purple inward of the house Was softened with all grace of scent and sound In ear and nostril perfecting my praise; Faint grape-flowers and cloven honey-cake And the just grain with dues of the shed salt Made me content: yet my hand loosened not Its gripe upon your harvest all year long. While I, thus woman-muffled in wan flesh And waste externals of a perished face, Preserved the levels of my wrath and love Patiently ruled; and with soft offices Cooled the sharp noons and busied the warm nights In care of this my choice, this child my choice, Triptolemus, the king's selected son: That this fair yearlong body, which hath grown Strong with strange milk upon the mortal lip And nerved with half a god, might so increase Outside the bulk and the bare scope of man: And waxen over large to hold within Base breath of yours and this impoverished air, I might exalt him past the flame of stars, The limit and walled reach of the great world. Therefore my breast made common to his mouth Immortal savours, and the taste whereat Twice their hard life strains out the coloured veins And twice its brain confirms the narrow shell. Also at night, unwinding cloth from cloth As who unhusks an almond to the white And pastures curiously the purer taste, I bared the gracious limbs and the soft feet, Unswaddled the weak hands, and in mid ash Laid the sweet flesh of either feeble side, More tender for impressure of some touch Than wax to any pen; and lit around Fire, and made crawl the white worm-shapen flame, And leap in little angers spark by spark At head at once and feet; and the faint hair Hissed with rare sprinkles in the closer curl, And like scaled oarage of a keen thin fish In sea-water, so in pure fire his feet Struck out, and the flame bit not in his flesh, But like a kiss it curled his lip, and heat Fluttered his eyelids; so each night I blew The hot ash red to purge him to full god. Ill is it when fear hungers in the soul For painful food, and chokes thereon, being fed; And ill slant eyes interpret the straight sun, But in their scope its white is wried to black: By the queen Metaneira mean I this; For with sick wrath upon her lips, and heart Narrowing with fear the spleenful passages, She thought to thread this web's fine ravel out, Nor leave her shuttle split in combing it; Therefore she stole on us, and with hard sight Peered, and stooped close; then with pale open mouth As the fire smote her in the eyes between Cried, and the child's laugh, sharply shortening As fire doth under rain, fell off; the flame Writhed once all through and died, and in thick dark Tears fell from mine on the child's weeping eyes, Eyes dispossessed of strong inheritance And mortal fallen anew. Who not the less From bud of beard to pale-grey flower of hair Shall wax vinewise to a lordly vine, whose grapes Bleed the red heavy blood of swoln soft wine, Subtle with sharp leaves' intricacy, until Full of white years and blossom of hoary days I take him perfected; for whose one sake I am thus gracious to the least who stands Filleted with white wool and girt upon As he whose prayer endures upon the lip And falls not waste: wherefore let sacrifice Burn and run red in all the wider ways; Seeing I have sworn by the pale temples' band And poppied hair of gold Persephone Sad-tressed and pleached low down about her brows, And by the sorrow in her lips, and death Her dumb and mournful-mouthèd minister, My word for you is eased of its harsh weight And doubled with soft promise; and your king Triptolemus, this Celeus dead and swathed Purple and pale for golden burial, Shall be your helper in my services, Dividing earth and reaping fruits thereof In fields where wait, well-girt, well-wreathen, all The heavy-handed seasons all year through; Saving the choice of warm spear-headed grain, And stooping sharp to the slant-sided share All beasts that furrow the remeasured land With their bowed necks of burden equable. AUGUST There were four apples on the bough, Half gold half red, that one might know The blood was ripe inside the core; The colour of the leaves was more Like stems of yellow corn that grow Through all the gold June meadow's floor. The warm smell of the fruit was good To feed on, and the split green wood, With all its bearded lips and stains Of mosses in the cloven veins, Most pleasant, if one lay or stood In sunshine or in happy rains. There were four apples on the tree, Red stained through gold, that all might see The sun went warm from core to rind; The green leaves made the summer blind In that soft place they kept for me With golden apples shut behind. The leaves caught gold across the sun, And where the bluest air begun Thirsted for song to help the heat; As I to feel my lady's feet Draw close before the day were done; Both lips grew dry with dreams of it. In the mute August afternoon They trembled to some undertune Of music in the silver air; Great pleasure was it to be there Till green turned duskier and the moon Coloured the corn-sheaves like gold hair. That August time it was delight To watch the red moons wane to white 'Twixt grey seamed stems of apple-trees; A sense of heavy harmonies Grew on the growth of patient night, More sweet than shapen music is. But some three hours before the moon The air, still eager from the noon, Flagged after heat, not wholly dead; Against the stem I leant my head; The colour soothed me like a tune, Green leaves all round the gold and red. I lay there till the warm smell grew More sharp, when flecks of yellow dew Between the round ripe leaves had blurred The rind with stain and wet; I heard A wind that blew and breathed and blew, Too weak to alter its one word. The wet leaves next the gentle fruit Felt smoother, and the brown tree-root Felt the mould warmer: I too felt (As water feels the slow gold melt Right through it when the day burns mute) The peace of time wherein love dwelt. There were four apples on the tree, Gold stained on red that all might see The sweet blood filled them to the core: The colour of her hair is more Like stems of fair faint gold, that be Mown from the harvest's middle floor. A CHRISTMAS CAROL Suggested by a drawing of Mr. D. G. Rossetti's. Three damsels in the queen's chamber, The queen's mouth was most fair; She spake a word of God's mother As the combs went in her hair. Mary that is of might, Bring us to thy Son's sight. They held the gold combs out from her, A span's length off her head; She sang this song of God's mother And of her bearing-bed. Mary most full of grace, Bring us to thy Son's face. When she sat at Joseph's hand, She looked against her side; And either way from the short silk band Her girdle was all wried. Mary that all good may, Bring us to thy Son's way. Mary had three women for her bed, The twain were maidens clean; The first of them had white and red, The third had riven green. Mary that is so sweet, Bring us to thy Son's feet. She had three women for her hair, Two were gloved soft and shod; The third had feet and fingers bare, She was the likest God. Mary that wieldeth land, Bring us to thy Son's hand. She had three women for her ease, The twain were good women: The first two were the two Maries, The third was Magdalen. Mary that perfect is, Bring us to thy Son's kiss. Joseph had three workmen in his stall, To serve him well upon; The first of them were Peter and Paul, The third of them was John. Mary, God's handmaiden, Bring us to thy Son's ken. “If your child be none other man's, But if it be very mine, The bedstead shall be gold two spans, The bedfoot silver fine.” Mary that made God mirth, Bring us to thy Son's birth. “If the child be some other man's, And if it be none of mine, The manger shall be straw two spans, Betwixen kine and kine.” Mary that made sin cease, Bring us to thy Son's peace. Christ was born upon this wise, It fell on such a night, Neither with sounds of psalteries, Nor with fire for light. Mary that is God's spouse, Bring us to thy Son's house. The star came out upon the east With a great sound and sweet: Kings gave gold to make him feast And myrrh for him to eat. Mary, of thy sweet mood, Bring us to thy Son's good. He had two handmaids at his head, One handmaid at his feet; The twain of them were fair and red, The third one was right sweet. Mary that is most wise, Bring us to thy Son's eyes. Amen. THE MASQUE OF QUEEN BERSABE A MIRACLE-PLAY KING DAVID Knights mine, all that be in hall, I have a counsel to you all, Because of this thing God lets fall Among us for a sign. For some days hence as I did eat From kingly dishes my good meat, There flew a bird between my feet As red as any wine. This bird had a long bill of red And a gold ring above his head; Long time he sat and nothing said, Put softly down his neck and fed From the gilt patens fine: And as I marvelled, at the last He shut his two keen eyën fast And suddenly woxe big and brast Ere one should tell to nine. PRIMUS MILES Sir, note this that I will say; That Lord who maketh corn with hay And morrows each of yesterday, He hath you in his hand. SECUNDUS MILES (Paganus quidam) By Satan I hold no such thing; For if wine swell within a king Whose ears for drink are hot and ring, The same shall dream of wine-bibbing Whilst he can lie or stand. QUEEN BERSABE Peace now, lords, for Godis head, Ye chirk as starlings that be fed And gape as fishes newly dead; The devil put your bones to bed, Lo, this is all to say. SECUNDUS MILES By Mahound, lords, I have good will This devil's bird to wring and spill; For now meseems our game goes ill, Ye have scant hearts to play. TERTIUS MILES Lo, sirs, this word is there said, That Urias the knight is dead Through some ill craft; by Poulis head, I doubt his blood hath made so red This bird that flew from the queen's bed Whereof ye have such fear. KING DAVID Yea, my good knave, and is it said That I can raise men from the dead? By God I think to have his head Who saith words of my lady's bed For any thief to hear. Et percutiat eum in capite. QUEEN BERSABE I wis men shall spit at me, And say, it were but right for thee That one should hang thee on a tree; Ho! it were a fair thing to see The big stones bruise her false body; Fie! who shall see her dead? KING DAVID I rede you have no fear of this, For, as ye wot, the first good kiss I had must be the last of his; Now are ye queen of mine, I wis, And lady of a house that is Full rich of meat and bread. PRIMUS MILES I bid you make good cheer to be So fair a queen as all men see. And hold us for your lieges free; By Peter's soul that hath the key, Ye have good hap of it. SECUNDUS MILES I would that he were hanged and dead Who hath no joy to see your head With gold about it, barred on red; I hold him as a sow of lead That is so scant of wit. Tunc dicat Nathan prophetaO king, I have a word to thee; The child that is in Bersabe Shall wither without light to see; This word is come of God by me For sin that ye have done. Because herein ye did not right, To take the fair one lamb to smite That was of Urias the knight; Ye wist he had but one. Full many sheep I wot ye had, And many women, when ye bade, To do your will and keep you glad, And a good crown about your head With gold to show thereon. This Urias had one poor house With low-barred latoun shot-windows And scant of corn to fill a mouse; And rusty basnets for his brows, To wear them to the bone. Yea the roofs also, as men sain, Were thin to hold against the rain; Therefore what rushes were there lain Grew wet withouten foot of men; The stancheons were all gone in twain As sick man's flesh is gone. Nathless he had great joy to see The long hair of this Bersabe Fall round her lap and round her knee Even to her small soft feet, that be Shod now with crimson royally And covered with clean gold. Likewise great joy he had to kiss Her throat, where now the scarlet is Against her little chin, I wis, That then was but cold. No scarlet then her kirtle had And little gold about it sprad; But her red mouth was always glad To kiss, albeit the eyes were sad With love they had to hold. SECUNDUS MILES How! old thief, thy wits are lame; To clip such it is no shame; I rede you in the devil's name, Ye come not here to make men game; By Termagaunt that maketh grame, I shall to-bete thine head. Hìc Diabolus capiat eum. This knave hath sharp fingers, perfay; Mahound you thank and keep alway, And give you good knees to pray; What man hath no lust to play, The devil wring his ears, I say; There is no more but wellaway, For now am I dead. KING DAVID Certes his mouth is wried and black, Full little pence be in his sack; This devil hath him by the back, It is no boot to lie. NATHAN Sitteth now still and learn of me; A little while and ye shall see The face of God's strength presently. All queens made as this Bersabe, All that were fair and foul ye be, Come hither; it am I. Et hìc omnes cantabunt. HERODIAS I am the queen Herodias. This headband of my temples was King Herod's gold band woven me. This broken dry staff in my hand Was the queen's staff of a great land Betwixen Perse and Samarie. For that one dancing of my feet, The fire is come in my green wheat, From one sea to the other sea. AHOLIBAH I am the queen Aholibah. My lips kissed dumb the word of Ah Sighed on strange lips grown sick thereby. God wrought to me my royal bed; The inner work thereof was red, The outer work was ivory. My mouth's heat was the heat of flame For lust towards the kings that came With horsemen riding royally. CLEOPATRA I am the queen of Ethiope. Love bade my kissing eyelids ope That men beholding might praise love. My hair was wonderful and curled; My lips held fast the mouth o' the world To spoil the strength and speech thereof. The latter triumph in my breath Bowed down the beaten brows of death, Ashamed they had not wrath enough. ABIHAIL I am the queen of Tyrians. My hair was glorious for twelve spans, That dried to loose dust afterward. My stature was a strong man's length: My neck was like a place of strength Built with white walls, even and hard. Like the first noise of rain leaves catch One from another, snatch by snatch, Is my praise, hissed against and marred. AZUBAH I am the queen of Amorites. My face was like a place of lights With multitudes at festival. The glory of my gracious brows Was like God's house made glorious With colours upon either wall. Between my brows and hair there was A white space like a space of glass With golden candles over all. AHOLAH I am the queen of Amalek. There was no tender touch or fleck To spoil my body or bared feet. My words were soft like dulcimers, And the first sweet of grape-flowers Made each side of my bosom sweet. My raiment was as tender fruit Whose rind smells sweet of spice-tree root, Bruised balm-blossom and budded wheat. AHINOAM I am the queen Ahinoam. Like the throat of a soft slain lamb Was my throat, softer veined than his: My lips were as two grapes the sun Lays his whole weight of heat upon Like a mouth heavy with a kiss: My hair's pure purple a wrought fleece, My temples therein as a piece Of a pomegranate's cleaving is. ATARAH I am the queen Sidonian. My face made faint the face of man, And strength was bound between my brows. Spikenard was hidden in my ships, Honey and wheat and myrrh in strips, White wools that shine as colour does, Soft linen dyed upon the fold, Split spice and cores of scented gold, Cedar and broken calamus. SEMIRAMIS I am the queen Semiramis. The whole world and the sea that is In fashion like a chrysopras, The noise of all men labouring, The priest's mouth tired through thanksgiving, The sound of love in the blood's pause, The strength of love in the blood's beat, All these were cast beneath my feet And all found lesser than I was. HESIONE I am the queen Hesione. The seasons that increased in me Made my face fairer than all men's. I had the summer in my hair; And all the pale gold autumn air Was as the habit of my sense. My body was as fire that shone; God's beauty that makes all things one Was one among my handmaidens. CHRYSOTHEMIS I am the queen of Samothrace. God, making roses, made my face As a rose filled up full with red. My prows made sharp the straitened seas From Pontus to that Chersonese Whereon the ebbed Asian stream is shed. My hair was as sweet scent that drips; Love's breath begun about my lips Kindled the lips of people dead. THOMYRIS I am the queen of Scythians. My strength was like no strength of man's, My face like day, my breast like spring. My fame was felt in the extreme land That hath sunshine on the one hand And on the other star-shining. Yea, and the wind there fails of breath; Yea, and there life is waste like death; Yea, and there death is a glad thing. HARHAS I am the queen of Anakim. In the spent years whose speech is dim, Whose raiment is the dust and death, My stately body without stain Shone as the shining race of rain Whose hair a great wind scattereth. Now hath God turned my lips to sighs, Plucked off mine eyelids from mine eyes, And sealed with seals my way of breath. MYRRHA I am the queen Arabian. The tears wherewith mine eyelids ran Smelt like my perfumed eyelids' smell. A harsh thirst made my soft mouth hard, That ached with kisses afterward; My brain rang like a beaten bell. As tears on eyes, as fire on wood, Sin fed upon my breath and blood, Sin made my breasts subside and swell. PASIPHAE I am the queen Pasiphae. Not all the pure clean-coloured sea Could cleanse or cool my yearning veins; Nor any root nor herb that grew, Flag-leaves that let green water through, Nor washing of the dews and rains. From shame's pressed core I wrung the sweet Fruit's savour that was death to eat, Whereof no seed but death remains. SAPPHO I am the queen of Lesbians. My love, that had no part in man's, Was sweeter than all shape of sweet. The intolerable infinite desire Made my face pale like faded fire When the ashen pyre falls through with heat. My blood was hot wan wine of love, And my song's sound the sound thereof, The sound of the delight of it. MESSALINA I am the queen of Italy. These were the signs God set on me; A barren beauty subtle and sleek, Curled carven hair, and cheeks worn wan With fierce false lips of many a man, Large temples where the blood ran weak, A mouth athirst and amorous And hungering as the grave's mouth does That, being an-hungred, cannot speak. AMESTRIS I am the queen of Persians. My breasts were lordlier than bright swans, My body as amber fair and thin. Strange flesh was given my lips for bread, With poisonous hours my days were fed, And my feet shod with adder-skin. In Shushan toward Ecbatane I wrought my joys with tears and pain, My loves with blood and bitter sin. EPHRATH I am the queen of Rephaim. God, that some while refraineth him, Made in the end a spoil of me. My rumour was upon the world As strong sound of swoln water hurled Through porches of the straining sea. My hair was like the flag-flower, And my breasts carven goodlier Than beryl with chalcedony. PASITHEA I am the queen of Cypriotes. Mine oarsmen, labouring with brown throats, Sang of me many a tender thing. My maidens, girdled loose and braced With gold from bosom to white waist, Praised me between their wool-combing. All that praise Venus all night long With lips like speech and lids like song Praised me till song lost heart to sing. ALACIEL I am the queen Alaciel. My mouth was like that moist gold cell Whereout the thickest honey drips. Mine eyes were as a grey-green sea; The amorous blood that smote on me Smote to my feet and finger-tips. My throat was whiter than the dove, Mine eyelids as the seals of love, And as the doors of love my lips. ERIGONE I am the queen Erigone. The wild wine shed as blood on me Made my face brighter than a bride's. My large lips had the old thirst of earth, Mine arms the might of the old sea's girth Bound round the whole world's iron sides. Within mine eyes and in mine ears Were music and the wine of tears, And light, and thunder of the tides. Et hìc exeant, et dicat Bersabe regina; Alas, God, for thy great pity And for the might that is in thee, Behold, I woful Bersabe Cry out with stoopings of my knee And thy wrath laid and bound on me Till I may see thy love. Behold, Lord, this child is grown Within me between bone and bone To make me mother of a son, Made of my body with strong moan; There shall not be another one That shall be made hereof. KING DAVID Lord God, alas, what shall I sain? Lo, thou art as an hundred men Both to break and build again: The wild ways thou makest plain, Thine hands hold the hail and rain, And thy fingers both grape and grain; Of their largess we be all well fain, And of their great pity: The sun thou madest of good gold, Of clean silver the moon cold, All the great stars thou hast told As thy cattle in thy fold Every one by his name of old; Wind and water thou hast in hold, Both the land and the long sea; Both the green sea and the land, Lord God, thou hast in hand, Both white water and grey sand; Upon thy right or thy left hand There is no man that may stand; Lord, thou rue on me. O wise Lord, if thou be keen To note things amiss that been, I am not worth a shell of bean More than an old mare meagre and lean; For all my wrong-doing with my queen, It grew not of our heartès clean, But it began of her body. For it fell in the hot May I stood within a paven way Built of fair bright stone, perfay, That is as fire of night and day And lighteth all my house. Therein be neither stones nor sticks, Neither red nor white bricks, But for cubits five or six There is most goodly sardonyx And amber laid in rows. It goes round about my roofs, (If ye list ye shall have proofs) There is good space for horse and hoofs, Plain and nothing perilous. For the fair green weather's heat, And for the smell of leavès sweet, It is no marvel, well ye weet, A man to waxen amorous. This I say now by my case That spied forth of that royal place; There I saw in no great space Mine own sweet, both body and face, Under the fresh boughs. In a water that was there She wesshe her goodly body bare And dried it with her owen hair: Both her arms and her knees fair, Both bosom and brows; Both shoulders and eke thighs Tho she wesshe upon this wise; Ever she sighed with little sighs, And ever she gave God thank. Yea, God wot I can well see yet Both her breast and her sides all wet And her long hair withouten let Spread sideways like a drawing net; Full dear bought and full far fet Was that sweet thing there y-set; It were a hard thing to forget How both lips and eyen met, Breast and breath sank. So goodly a sight as there she was, Lying looking on her glass By wan water in green grass, Yet saw never man. So soft and great she was and bright With all her body waxen white, I woxe nigh blind to see the light Shed out of it to left and right; This bitter sin from that sweet sight Between us twain began. NATHAN Now, sir, be merry anon, For ye shall have a full wise son, Goodly and great of flesh and bone; There shall no king be such an one, I swear by Godis rood. Therefore, lord, be merry here, And go to meat withouten fear, And hear a mass with goodly cheer; For to all folk ye shall be dear, And all folk of your blood. Et tunc dicant Laudamus. ST. DOROTHY It hath been seen and yet it shall be seen That out of tender mouths God's praise hath been Made perfect, and with wood and simple string He hath played music sweet as shawm-playing To please himself with softness of all sound; And no small thing but hath been sometime found Full sweet of use, and no such humbleness But God hath bruised withal the sentences And evidence of wise men witnessing; No leaf that is so soft a hidden thing It never shall get sight of the great sun; The strength of ten has been the strength of one, And lowliness has waxed imperious. There was in Rome a man Theophilus Of right great blood and gracious ways, that had All noble fashions to make people glad And a soft life of pleasurable days; He was a goodly man for one to praise, Flawless and whole upward from foot to head; His arms were a red hawk that alway fed On a small bird with feathers gnawed upon, Beaten and plucked about the bosom-bone Whereby a small round fleck like fire there was: They called it in their tongue lampadias; This was the banner of the lordly man. In many straits of sea and reaches wan Full of quick wind, and many a shaken firth, It had seen fighting days of either earth, Westward or east of waters Gaditane (This was the place of sea-rocks under Spain Called after the great praise of Hercules) And north beyond the washing Pontic seas, Far windy Russian places fabulous, And salt fierce tides of storm-swoln Bosphorus. Now as this lord came straying in Rome town He saw a little lattice open down And after it a press of maidens' heads That sat upon their cold small quiet beds Talking, and played upon short-stringèd lutes; And other some ground perfume out of roots Gathered by marvellous moons in Asia; Saffron and aloes and wild cassia, Coloured all through and smelling of the sun; And over all these was a certain one Clothed softly, with sweet herbs about her hair And bosom flowerful; her face more fair Than sudden-singing April in soft lands: Eyed like a gracious bird, and in both hands She held a psalter painted green and red. This Theophile laughed at the heart, and said, Now God so help me hither and St. Paul, As by the new time of their festival I have good will to take this maid to wife. And herewith fell to fancies of her life And soft half-thoughts that ended suddenly. This is man's guise to please himself, when he Shall not see one thing of his pleasant things, Nor with outwatch of many travailings Come to be eased of the least pain he hath For all his love and all his foolish wrath And all the heavy manner of his mind. Thus is he like a fisher fallen blind That casts his nets across the boat awry To strike the sea, but lo, he striketh dry And plucks them back all broken for his pain And bites his beard and casts across again And reaching wrong slips over in the sea. So hath this man a strangled neck for fee, For all his cost he chuckles in his throat. This Theophile that little hereof wote Laid wait to hear of her what she might be: Men told him she had name of Dorothy, And was a lady of a worthy house. Thereat this knight grew inly glorious That he should have a love so fair of place. She was a maiden of most quiet face, Tender of speech, and had no hardihood But was nigh feeble of her fearful blood; Her mercy in her was so marvellous From her least years, that seeing her school-fellows That read beside her stricken with a rod, She would cry sore and say some word to God That he would ease her fellow of his pain. There is no touch of sun or fallen rain That ever fell on a more gracious thing. In middle Rome there was in stone-working The church of Venus painted royally. The chapels of it were some two or three, In each of them her tabernacle was And a wide window of six feet in glass Coloured with all her works in red and gold. The altars had bright cloths and cups to hold The wine of Venus for the services, Made out of honey and crushed wood-berries That shed sweet yellow through the thick wet red, That on high days was borne upon the head Of Venus' priest for any man to drink; So that in drinking he should fall to think On some fair face, and in the thought thereof Worship, and such should triumph in his love. For this soft wine that did such grace and good Was new trans-shaped and mixed with Love's own blood, That in the fighting Trojan time was bled; For which came such a woe to Diomed That he was stifled after in hard sea. And some said that this wine-shedding should be Made of the falling of Adonis' blood, That curled upon the thorns and broken wood And round the gold silk shoes on Venus' feet; The taste thereof was as hot honey sweet And in the mouth ran soft and riotous. This was the holiness of Venus' house. It was their worship, that in August days Twelve maidens should go through those Roman ways Naked, and having gold across their brows And their hair twisted in short golden rows, To minister to Venus in this wise: And twelve men chosen in their companies To match these maidens by the altar-stair, All in one habit, crowned upon the hair. Among these men was chosen Theophile. This knight went out and prayed a little while, Holding queen Venus by her hands and knees; I will give thee twelve royal images Cut in glad gold, with marvels of wrought stone For thy sweet priests to lean and pray upon, Jasper and hyacinth and chrysopras, And the strange Asian thalamite that was Hidden twelve ages under heavy sea Among the little sleepy pearls, to be A shrine lit over with soft candle-flame Burning all night red as hot brows of shame, So thou wilt be my lady without sin. Goddess that art all gold outside and in, Help me to serve thee in thy holy way. Thou knowest, Love, that in my bearing day There shone a laughter in the singing stars Round the gold-ceilèd bride-bed wherein Mars Touched thee and had thee in your kissing wise. Now therefore, sweet, kiss thou my maiden's eyes That they may open graciously towards me; And this new fashion of thy shrine shall be As soft with gold as thine own happy head. The goddess, that was painted with face red Between two long green tumbled sides of sea, Stooped her neck sideways, and spake pleasantly: Thou shalt have grace as thou art thrall of mine. And with this came a savour of shed wine And plucked-out petals from a rose's head: And softly with slow laughs of lip she said, Thou shalt have favour all thy days of me. Then came Theophilus to Dorothy, Saying: O sweet, if one should strive or speak Against God's ways, he gets a beaten cheek For all his wage and shame above all men. Therefore I have no will to turn again When God saith “go,” lest a worse thing fall out. Then she, misdoubting lest he went about To catch her wits, made answer somewhat thus: I have no will, my lord Theophilus, To speak against this worthy word of yours; Knowing how God's will in all speech endures, That save by grace there may no thing be said. Then Theophile waxed light from foot to head, And softly fell upon this answering. It is well seen you are a chosen thing To do God service in his gracious way. I will that you make haste and holiday To go next year upon the Venus stair, Covered none else, but crowned upon your hair, And do the service that a maiden doth. She said: but I that am Christ's maid were loth To do this thing that hath such bitter name. Thereat his brows were beaten with sore shame And he came off and said no other word. Then his eyes chanced upon his banner-bird, And he fell fingering at the staff of it And laughed for wrath and stared between his feet, And out of a chafed heart he spake as thus: Lo how she japes at me Theophilus, Feigning herself a fool and hard to love; Yet in good time for all she boasteth of She shall be like a little beaten bird. And while his mouth was open in that word He came upon the house Janiculum, Where some went busily, and other some Talked in the gate called the gate glorious. The emperor, which was one Gabalus, Sat over all and drank chill wine alone. To whom is come Theophilus anon, And said as thus: Beau sire, Dieu vous aide. And afterward sat under him, and said All this thing through as ye have wholly heard. This Gabalus laughed thickly in his beard. Yea, this is righteousness and maiden rule. Truly, he said, a maid is but a fool. And japed at them as one full villainous, In a lewd wise, this heathen Gabalus, And sent his men to bind her as he bade. Thus have they taken Dorothy the maid, And haled her forth as men hale pick-purses: A little need God knows they had of this, To hale her by her maiden gentle hair. Thus went she lowly, making a soft prayer, As one who stays the sweet wine in his mouth, Murmuring with eased lips, and is most loth To have done wholly with the sweet of it. Christ king, fair Christ, that knowest all men's wit And all the feeble fashion of my ways, O perfect God, that from all yesterdays Abidest whole with morrows perfected, I pray thee by thy mother's holy head Thou help me to do right, that I not slip: I have no speech nor strength upon my lip, Except thou help me who art wise and sweet. Do this too for those nails that clove thy feet, Let me die maiden after many pains. Though I be least among thy handmaidens, Doubtless I shall take death more sweetly thus. Now have they brought her to King Gabalus, Who laughed in all his throat some breathing-whiles: By God, he said, if one should leap two miles, He were not pained about the sides so much. This were a soft thing for a man to touch. Shall one so chafe that hath such little bones? And shook his throat with thick and chuckled moans For laughter that she had such holiness. What aileth thee, wilt thou do services? It were good fare to fare as Venus doth. Then said this lady with her maiden mouth, Shamefaced, and something paler in the cheek: Now, sir, albeit my wit and will to speak Give me no grace in sight of worthy men, For all my shame yet know I this again, I may not speak, nor after downlying Rise up to take delight in lute-playing, Nor sing nor sleep, nor sit and fold my hands, But my soul in some measure understands God's grace laid like a garment over me. For this fair God that out of strong sharp sea Lifted the shapely and green-coloured land, And hath the weight of heaven in his hand As one might hold a bird, and under him The heavy golden planets beam by beam Building the feasting-chambers of his house, And the large world he holdeth with his brows, And with the light of them astonisheth All place and time and face of life and death And motion of the north wind and the south, And is the sound within his angel's mouth Of singing words and words of thanksgiving, And is the colour of the latter spring And heat upon the summer and the sun, And is beginning of all things begun And gathers in him all things to their end, And with the fingers of his hand doth bend The stretched-out sides of heaven like a sail, And with his breath he maketh the red pale And fills with blood faint faces of men dead, And with the sound between his lips are fed Iron and fire and the white body of snow, And blossom of all trees in places low, And small bright herbs about the little hills, And fruit pricked softly with birds' tender bills, And flight of foam about green fields of sea, And fourfold strength of the great winds that be Moved always outward from beneath his feet, And growth of grass and growth of sheavèd wheat And all green flower of goodly-growing lands; And all these things he gathers with his hands And covers all their beauty with his wings; The same, even God that governs all these things, Hath set my feet to be upon his ways. Now therefore for no painfulness of days I shall put off this service bound on me. Also, fair sir, ye know this certainly, How God was in his flesh full chaste and meek And gave his face to shame, and either cheek Gave up to smiting of men tyrannous. And here with a great voice this Gabalus Cried out and said: By God's blood and his bones, This were good game betwixen night and nones For one to sit and hearken to such saws: I were as lief fall in some big beast's jaws As hear these women's jaw-teeth clattering; By God a woman is the harder thing, One may not put a hook into her mouth. Now by St. Luke I am so sore adrouth For all these saws I must needs drink again. But I pray God deliver all us men From all such noise of women and their heat. That is a noble scripture, well I weet, That likens women to an empty can; When God said that he was a full wise man. I trow no man may blame him as for that. And herewithal he drank a draught, and spat, And said: Now shall I make an end hereof. Come near all men and hearken for God's love, And ye shall hear a jest or twain, God wot. And spake as thus with mouth full thick and hot; But thou do this thou shalt be shortly slain. Lo, sir, she said, this death and all this pain I take in penance of my bitter sins. Yea now, quoth Gabalus, this game begins. Lo, without sin one shall not live a span. Lo, this is she that would not look on man Between her fingers folded in thwart wise. See how her shame hath smitten in her eyes That was so clean she had not heard of shame. Certes, he said, by Gabalus my name, This two years back I was not so well pleased. This were good mirth for sick men to be eased And rise up whole and laugh at hearing of. I pray thee show us something of thy love, Since thou wast maid thy gown is waxen wide. Yea, maid I am, she said, and somewhat sighed, As one who thought upon the low fair house Where she sat working, with soft bended brows Watching her threads, among the school-maidens. And she thought well now God had brought her thence She should not come to sew her gold again. Then cried King Gabalus upon his men To have her forth and draw her with steel gins. And as a man hag-ridden beats and grins And bends his body sidelong in his bed, So wagged he with his body and knave's head, Gaping at her, and blowing with his breath. And in good time he gat an evil death Out of his lewdness with his cursèd wives: His bones were hewn asunder as with knives For his misliving, certes it is said. But all the evil wrought upon this maid, It were full hard for one to handle it. For her soft blood was shed upon her feet, And all her body's colour bruised and faint. But she, as one abiding God's great saint, Spake not nor wept for all this travail hard. Wherefore the king commanded afterward To slay her presently in all men's sight. And it was now an hour upon the night And winter-time, and a few stars began. The weather was yet feeble and all wan For beating of a weighty wind and snow. And she came walking in soft wise and slow, And many men with faces piteous. Then came this heavy cursing Gabalus, That swore full hard into his drunken beard; And faintly after without any word Came Theophile some paces off the king. And in the middle of this wayfaring Full tenderly beholding her he said: There is no word of comfort with men dead Nor any face and colour of things sweet; But always with lean cheeks and lifted feet These dead men lie all aching to the blood With bitter cold, their brows withouten hood Beating for chill, their bodies swathed full thin: Alas, what hire shall any have herein To give his life and get such bitterness? Also the soul going forth bodiless Is hurt with naked cold, and no man saith If there be house or covering for death To hide the soul that is discomforted. Then she beholding him a little said: Alas, fair lord, ye have no wit of this; For on one side death is full poor of bliss And as ye say full sharp of bone and lean: But on the other side is good and green And hath soft flower of tender-coloured hair Grown on his head, and a red mouth as fair As may be kissed with lips; thereto his face Is as God's face, and in a perfect place Full of all sun and colour of straight boughs And waterheads about a painted house That hath a mile of flowers either way Outward from it, and blossom-grass of May Thickening on many a side for length of heat, Hath God set death upon a noble seat Covered with green and flowered in the fold, In likeness of a great king grown full old And gentle with new temperance of blood; And on his brows a purfled purple hood, They may not carry any golden thing; And plays some tune with subtle fingering On a small cithern, full of tears and sleep And heavy pleasure that is quick to weep And sorrow with the honey in her mouth; And for this might of music that he doth Are all souls drawn toward him with great love And weep for sweetness of the noise thereof And bow to him with worship of their knees; And all the field is thick with companies Of fair-clothed men that play on shawms and lutes And gather honey of the yellow fruits Between the branches waxen soft and wide: And all this peace endures in either side Of the green land, and God beholdeth all. And this is girdled with a round fair wall Made of red stone and cool with heavy leaves Grown out against it, and green blossom cleaves To the green chinks, and lesser wall-weed sweet, Kissing the crannies that are split with heat, And branches where the summer draws to head. And Theophile burnt in the cheek, and said: Yea, could one see it, this were marvellous. I pray you, at your coming to this house, Give me some leaf of all those tree-branches; Seeing how so sharp and white our weather is, There is no green nor gracious red to see. Yea, sir, she said, that shall I certainly. And from her long sweet throat without a fleck Undid the gold, and through her stretched-out neck The cold axe clove, and smote away her head: Out of her throat the tender blood full red Fell suddenly through all her long soft hair. And with good speed for hardness of the air Each man departed to his house again. Lo, as fair colour in the face of men At seed-time of their blood, or in such wise As a thing seen increaseth in men's eyes, Caught first far off by sickly fits of sight, So a word said, if one shall hear aright, Abides against the season of its growth. This Theophile went slowly, as one doth That is not sure for sickness of his feet; And counting the white stonework of the street, Tears fell out of his eyes for wrath and love, Making him weep more for the shame thereof Than for true pain: so went he half a mile. And women mocked him, saying: Theophile, Lo, she is dead; what shall a woman have That loveth such an one? so Christ me save, I were as lief to love a man new-hung. Surely this man has bitten on his tongue, This makes him sad and writhled in his face. And when they came upon the paven place That was called sometime the place amorous There came a child before Theophilus Bearing a basket, and said suddenly: Fair sir, this is my mistress Dorothy That sends you gifts; and with this he was gone. In all this earth there is not such an one For colour and straight stature made so fair. The tender growing gold of his pure hair Was as wheat growing, and his mouth as flame. God called him Holy after his own name; With gold cloth like fire burning he was clad. But for the fair green basket that he had, It was filled up with heavy white and red; Great roses stained still where the first rose bled, Burning at heart for shame their heart withholds: And the sad colour of strong marigolds That have the sun to kiss their lips for love; The flower that Venus' hair is woven of, The colour of fair apples in the sun, Late peaches gathered when the heat was done And the slain air got breath; and after these The fair faint-headed poppies drunk with ease, And heaviness of hollow lilies red. Then cried they all that saw these things, and said It was God's doing, and was marvellous. And in brief while this knight Theophilus Is waxen full of faith, and witnesseth Before the king of God and love and death, For which the king bade hang him presently. A gallows of a goodly piece of tree This Gabalus hath made to hang him on. Forth of this world lo Theophile is gone With a wried neck, God give us better fare Than his that hath a twisted throat to wear; But truly for his love God hath him brought There where his heavy body grieves him nought Nor all the people plucking at his feet; But in his face his lady's face is sweet, And through his lips her kissing lips are gone: God send him peace, and joy of such an one. This is the story of St. Dorothy. I will you of your mercy pray for me Because I wrote these sayings for your grace, That I may one day see her in the face. THE TWO DREAMS (FROM BOCCACCIO) I will that if I say a heavy thing Your tongues forgive me; seeing ye know that spring Has flecks and fits of pain to keep her sweet, And walks somewhile with winter-bitten feet. Moreover it sounds often well to let One string, when ye play music, keep at fret The whole song through; one petal that is dead Confirms the roses, be they white or red; Dead sorrow is not sorrowful to hear As the thick noise that breaks mid weeping were; The sick sound aching in a lifted throat Turns to sharp silver of a perfect note; And though the rain falls often, and with rain Late autumn falls on the old red leaves like pain, I deem that God is not disquieted. Also while men are fed with wine and bread, They shall be fed with sorrow at his hand. There grew a rose-garden in Florence land More fair than many; all red summers through The leaves smelt sweet and sharp of rain, and blew Sideways with tender wind; and therein fell Sweet sound wherewith the green waxed audible, As a bird's will to sing disturbed his throat And set the sharp wings forward like a boat Pushed through soft water, moving his brown side Smooth-shapen as a maid's, and shook with pride His deep warm bosom, till the heavy sun's Set face of heat stopped all the songs at once. The ways were clean to walk and delicate; And when the windy white of March grew late, Before the trees took heart to face the sun With ravelled raiment of lean winter on, The roots were thick and hot with hollow grass. Some roods away a lordly house there was, Cool with broad courts and latticed passage wet From rush-flowers and lilies ripe to set, Sown close among the strewings of the floor; And either wall of the slow corridor Was dim with deep device of gracious things; Some angel's steady mouth and weight of wings Shut to the side; or Peter with straight stole And beard cut black against the aureole That spanned his head from nape to crown; thereby Mary's gold hair, thick to the girdle-tie Wherein was bound a child with tender feet; Or the broad cross with blood nigh brown on it. Within this house a righteous lord abode, Ser Averardo; patient of his mood, And just of judgment; and to child he had A maid so sweet that her mere sight made glad Men sorrowing, and unbound the brows of hate; And where she came, the lips that pain made strait Waxed warm and wide, and from untender grew Tender as those that sleep brings patience to. Such long locks had she, that with knee to chin She might have wrapped and warmed her feet therein. Right seldom fell her face on weeping wise; Gold hair she had, and golden-coloured eyes, Filled with clear light and fire and large repose Like a fair hound's; no man there is but knows Her face was white, and thereto she was tall; In no wise lacked there any praise at all To her most perfect and pure maidenhood; No sin I think there was in all her blood. She, where a gold grate shut the roses in, Dwelt daily through deep summer weeks, through green Flushed hours of rain upon the leaves; and there Love made him room and space to worship her With tender worship of bowed knees, and wrought Such pleasure as the pained sense palates not For weariness, but at one taste undoes The heart of its strong sweet, is ravenous Of all the hidden honey; words and sense Fail through the tune's imperious prevalence. In a poor house this lover kept apart, Long communing with patience next his heart If love of his might move that face at all, Tuned evenwise with colours musical; Then after length of days he said thus: “Love, For love's own sake and for the love thereof Let no harsh words untune your gracious mood; For good it were, if anything be good, To comfort me in this pain's plague of mine; Seeing thus, how neither sleep nor bread nor wine Seems pleasant to me, yea no thing that is Seems pleasant to me; only I know this, Love's ways are sharp for palms of piteous feet To travel, but the end of such is sweet: Now do with me as seemeth you the best.” She mused a little, as one holds his guest By the hand musing, with her face borne down: Then said: “Yea, though such bitter seed be sown, Have no more care of all that you have said; Since if there is no sleep will bind your head, Lo, I am fain to help you certainly; Christ knoweth, sir, if I would have you die; There is no pleasure when a man is dead.” Thereat he kissed her hands and yellow head And clipped her fair long body many times; I have no wit to shape in written rhymes A scanted tithe of this great joy they had. They were too near love's secret to be glad; As whoso deems the core will surely melt From the warm fruit his lips caress, hath felt Some bitter kernel where the teeth shut hard: Or as sweet music sharpens afterward, Being half disrelished both for sharp and sweet; As sea-water, having killed over-heat In a man's body, chills it with faint ache; So their sense, burdened only for love's sake, Failed for pure love; yet so time served their wit, They saved each day some gold reserves of it, Being wiser in love's riddle than such be Whom fragments feed with his chance charity. All things felt sweet were felt sweet overmuch; The rose-thorn's prickle dangerous to touch, And flecks of fire in the thin leaf-shadows; Too keen the breathèd honey of the rose, Its red too harsh a weight on feasted eyes; They were so far gone in love's histories, Beyond all shape and colour and mere breath, Where pleasure has for kinsfolk sleep and death, And strength of soul and body waxen blind For weariness, and flesh entoiled with mind, When the keen edge of sense foretasteth sin. Even this green place the summer caught them in Seemed half deflowered and sick with beaten leaves In their strayed eyes; these gold flower-fumèd eves Burnt out to make the sun's love-offering, The midnoon's prayer, the rose's thanksgiving, The trees' weight burdening the strengthless air, The shape of her stilled eyes, her coloured hair, Her body's balance from the moving feet— All this, found fair, lacked yet one grain of sweet It had some warm weeks back: so perisheth On May's new lip the tender April breath: So those same walks the wind sowed lilies in All April through, and all their latter kin Of languid leaves whereon the Autumn blows— The dead red raiment of the last year's rose— The last year's laurel, and the last year's love, Fade, and grow things that death grows weary of. What man will gather in red summer-time The fruit of some obscure and hoary rhyme Heard last midwinter, taste the heart in it, Mould the smooth semitones afresh, refit The fair limbs ruined, flush the dead blood through With colour, make all broken beauties new For love's new lesson—shall not such find pain When the marred music labouring in his brain Frets him with sweet sharp fragments, and lets slip One word that might leave satisfied his lip— One touch that might put fire in all the chords? This was her pain: to miss from all sweet words Some taste of sound, diverse and delicate— Some speech the old love found out to compensate For seasons of shut lips and drowsiness— Some grace, some word the old love found out to bless Passionless months and undelighted weeks. The flowers had lost their summer-scented cheeks, Their lips were no more sweet than daily breath: The year was plagued with instances of death. So fell it, these were sitting in cool grass With leaves about, and many a bird there was Where the green shadow thickliest impleached Soft fruit and writhen spray and blossom bleached Dry in the sun or washed with rains to white: Her girdle was pure silk, the bosom bright With purple as purple water and gold wrought in. One branch had touched with dusk her lips and chin, Made violet of the throat, abashed with shade The breast's bright plaited work: but nothing frayed The sun's large kiss on the luxurious hair. Her beauty was new colour to the air And music to the silent many birds. Love was an-hungred for some perfect words To praise her with; but only her low name “Andrevuola” came thrice, and thrice put shame In her clear cheek, so fruitful with new red That for pure love straightway shame's self was dead. Then with lids gathered as who late had wept She began saying: “I have so little slept My lids drowse now against the very sun; Yea, the brain aching with a dream begun Beats like a fitful blood; kiss but both brows, And you shall pluck my thoughts grown dangerous Almost away.” He said thus, kissing them: “O sole sweet thing that God is glad to name, My one gold gift, if dreams be sharp and sore Shall not the waking time increase much more With taste and sound, sweet eyesight or sweet scent? Has any heat too hard and insolent Burnt bare the tender married leaves, undone The maiden grass shut under from the sun? Where in this world is room enough for pain?” The feverish finger of love had touched again Her lips with happier blood; the pain lay meek In her fair face, nor altered lip nor cheek With pallor or with pulse; but in her mouth Love thirsted as a man wayfaring doth, Making it humble as weak hunger is. She lay close to him, bade do this and this, Say that, sing thus: then almost weeping-ripe Crouched, then laughed low. As one that fain would wipe The old record out of old things done and dead, She rose, she heaved her hands up, and waxed red For wilful heart and blameless fear of blame; Saying “Though my wits be weak, this is no shame For a poor maid whom love so punisheth With heats of hesitation and stopped breath That with my dreams I live yet heavily For pure sad heart and faith's humility. Now be not wroth and I will show you this. “Methought our lips upon their second kiss Met in this place, and a fair day we had And fair soft leaves that waxed and were not sad With shaken rain or bitten through with drouth; When I, beholding ever how your mouth Waited for mine, the throat being fallen back, Saw crawl thereout a live thing flaked with black Specks of brute slime and leper-coloured scale, A devil's hide with foul flame-writhen grail Fashioned where hell's heat festers loathsomest; And that brief speech may ease me of the rest, Thus were you slain and eaten of the thing. My waked eyes felt the new day shuddering On their low lids, felt the whole east so beat, Pant with close pulse of such a plague-struck heat, As if the palpitating dawn drew breath For horror, breathing between life and death, Till the sun sprang blood-bright and violent.” So finishing, her soft strength wholly spent, She gazed each way, lest some brute-hoovèd thing, The timeless travail of hell's childbearing, Should threat upon the sudden: whereat he, For relish of her tasted misery And tender little thornprick of her pain, Laughed with mere love. What lover among men But hath his sense fed sovereignly 'twixt whiles With tears and covered eyelids and sick smiles And soft disaster of a painèd face? What pain, established in so sweet a place, But the plucked leaf of it smells fragrantly? What colour burning man's wide-open eye But may be pleasurably seen? what sense Keeps in its hot sharp extreme violence No savour of sweet things? The bereaved blood And emptied flesh in their most broken mood Fail not so wholly, famish not when thus Past honey keeps the starved lip covetous. Therefore this speech from a glad mouth began, Breathed in her tender hair and temples wan Like one prolonged kiss while the lips had breath. “Sleep, that abides in vassalage of death And in death's service wears out half his age, Hath his dreams full of deadly vassalage, Shadow and sound of things ungracious; Fair shallow faces, hooded bloodless brows, And mouths past kissing; yea, myself have had As harsh a dream as holds your eyelids sad. “This dream I tell you came three nights ago; In full mid sleep I took a whim to know How sweet things might be; so I turned and thought; But save my dream all sweet availed me not. First came a smell of pounded spice and scent Such as God ripens in some continent Of utmost amber in the Syrian sea; And breaths as though some costly rose could be Spoiled slowly, wasted by some bitter fire To burn the sweet out leaf by leaf, and tire The flower's poor heart with heat and waste, to make Strong magic for some perfumed woman's sake. Then a cool naked sense beneath my feet Of bud and blossom; and sound of veins that beat As if a lute should play of its own heart And fearfully, not smitten of either part; And all my blood it filled with sharp and sweet As gold swoln grain fills out the huskèd wheat; So I rose naked from the bed, and stood Counting the mobile measure in my blood Some pleasant while, and through each limb there came Swift little pleasures pungent as a flame, Felt in the thrilling flesh and veins as much As the outer curls that feel the comb's first touch Thrill to the roots and shiver as from fire; And blind between my dream and my desire I seemed to stand and held my spirit still Lest this should cease. A child whose fingers spill Honey from cells forgotten of the bee Is less afraid to stir the hive and see Some wasp's bright back inside, than I to feel Some finger-touch disturb the flesh like steel. I prayed thus; Let me catch a secret here So sweet, it sharpens the sweet taste of fear And takes the mouth with edge of wine; I would Have here some colour and smooth shape as good As those in heaven whom the chief garden hides With low grape-blossom veiling their white sides And lesser tendrils that so bind and blind Their eyes and feet, that if one come behind To touch their hair they see not, neither fly; This would I see in heaven and not die. So praying, I had nigh cried out and knelt, So wholly my prayer filled me: till I felt In the dumb night's warm weight of glowing gloom Somewhat that altered all my sleeping-room, And made it like a green low place wherein Maids mix to bathe: one sets her small warm chin Against a ripple, that the angry pearl May flow like flame about her: the next curl Dips in some eddy coloured of the sun To wash the dust well out; another one Holds a straight ankle in her hand and swings With lavish body sidelong, so that rings Of sweet fierce water, swollen and splendid, fail All round her fine and floated body pale, Swayed flower-fashion, and her balanced side Swerved edgeways lets the weight of water slide, As taken in some underflow of sea Swerves the banked gold of sea-flowers; but she Pulls down some branch to keep her perfect head Clear of the river: even from wall to bed, I tell you, was my room transfigured so. Sweet, green and warm it was, nor could one know If there were walls or leaves, or if there was No bed's green curtain, but mere gentle grass. There were set also hard against the feet Gold plates with honey and green grapes to eat, With the cool water's noise to hear in rhymes: And a wind warmed me full of furze and limes And all hot sweets the heavy summer fills To the round brim of smooth cup-shapen hills. Next the grave walking of a woman's feet Made my veins hesitate, and gracious heat Made thick the lids and leaden on mine eyes: And I thought ever, surely it were wise Not yet to see her: this may last (who knows?) Five minutes; the poor rose is twice a rose Because it turns a face to her, the wind Sings that way; hath this woman ever sinned, I wonder? as a boy with apple-rind, I played with pleasures, made them to my mind, Changed each ere tasting. When she came indeed, First her hair touched me, then I grew to feed On the sense of her hand; her mouth at last Touched me between the cheek and lip and past Over my face with kisses here and there Sown in and out across the eyes and hair. Still I said nothing; till she set her face More close and harder on the kissing-place, And her mouth caught like a snake's mouth, and stung So faint and tenderly, the fang scarce clung More than a bird's foot: yet a wound it grew, A great one, let this red mark witness you Under the left breast; and the stroke thereof So clove my sense that I woke out of love And knew not what this dream was nor had wit; But now God knows if I have skill of it.” Hereat she laid one palm against her lips To stop their trembling; as when water slips Out of a beak-mouthed vessel with faint noise And chuckles in the narrowed throat and cloys The carven rims with murmuring, so came Words in her lips with no word right of them, A beaten speech thick and disconsolate, Till his smile ceasing waxed compassionate Of her sore fear that grew from anything— The sound of the strong summer thickening In heated leaves of the smooth apple-trees: The day's breath felt about the ash-branches, And noises of the noon whose weight still grew On the hot heavy-headed flowers, and drew Their red mouths open till the rose-heart ached; For eastward all the crowding rose was slaked And soothed with shade: but westward all its growth Seemed to breathe hard with heat as a man doth Who feels his temples newly feverous. And even with such motion in her brows As that man hath in whom sick days begin, She turned her throat and spake, her voice being thin As a sick man's, sudden and tremulous; “Sweet, if this end be come indeed on us, Let us love more;” and held his mouth with hers. As the first sound of flooded hill-waters Is heard by people of the meadow-grass, Or ever a wandering waif of ruin pass With whirling stones and foam of the brown stream Flaked with fierce yellow: so beholding him She felt before tears came her eyelids wet, Saw the face deadly thin where life was yet, Heard his throat's harsh last moan before it clomb: And he, with close mouth passionate and dumb, Burned at her lips: so lay they without speech, Each grasping other, and the eyes of each Fed in the other's face: till suddenly He cried out with a little broken cry This word, “O help me, sweet, I am but dead.” And even so saying, the colour of fair red Was gone out of his face, and his blood's beat Fell, and stark death made sharp his upward feet And pointed hands: and without moan he died. Pain smote her sudden in the brows and side, Strained her lips open and made burn her eyes: For the pure sharpness of her miseries She had no heart's pain, but mere body's wrack; But at the last her beaten blood drew back Slowly upon her face, and her stunned brows Suddenly grown aware and piteous Gathered themselves, her eyes shone, her hard breath Came as though one nigh dead came back from death; Her lips throbbed, and life trembled through her hair. And in brief while she thought to bury there The dead man that her love might lie with him In a sweet bed under the rose-roots dim And soft earth round the branchèd apple-trees, Full of hushed heat and heavy with great ease, And no man entering divide him thence. Wherefore she bade one of her handmaidens To be her help to do upon this wise. And saying so the tears out of her eyes Fell without noise and comforted her heart: Yea, her great pain eased of the sorest part Began to soften in her sense of it. There under all the little branches sweet The place was shapen of his burial; They shed thereon no thing funereal, But coloured leaves of latter rose-blossom, Stems of soft grass, some withered red and some Fair and fresh-blooded; and spoil splendider Of marigold and great spent sunflower. And afterward she came back without word To her own house; two days went, and the third Went, and she showed her father of this thing. And for great grief of her soul's travailing He gave consent she should endure in peace Till her life's end; yea, till her time should cease, She should abide in fellowship of pain. And having lived a holy year or twain She died of pure waste heart and weariness. And for love's honour in her love's distress This word was written over her tomb's head; “Here dead she lieth, for whose sake Love is dead.” AHOLIBAH In the beginning God made thee A woman well to look upon, Thy tender body as a tree Whereon cool wind hath always blown Till the clean branches be well grown. There was none like thee in the land; The girls that were thy bondwomen Did bind thee with a purple band Upon thy forehead, that all men Should know thee for God's handmaiden. Strange raiment clad thee like a bride, With silk to wear on hands and feet And plates of gold on either side: Wine made thee glad, and thou didst eat Honey, and choice of pleasant meat. And fishers in the middle sea Did get thee sea-fish and sea-weeds In colour like the robes on thee; And curious work of plaited reeds, And wools wherein live purple bleeds. And round the edges of thy cup Men wrought thee marvels out of gold, Strong snakes with lean throats lifted up, Large eyes whereon the brows had hold, And scaly things their slime kept cold. For thee they blew soft wind in flutes And ground sweet roots for cunning scent; Made slow because of many lutes, The wind among thy chambers went Wherein no light was violent. God called thy name Aholibah, His tabernacle being in thee, A witness through waste Asia; Thou wert a tent sewn cunningly With gold and colours of the sea. God gave thee gracious ministers And all their work who plait and weave: The cunning of embroiderers That sew the pillow to the sleeve, And likeness of all things that live. Thy garments upon thee were fair With scarlet and with yellow thread; Also the weaving of thine hair Was as fine gold upon thy head, And thy silk shoes were sewn with red. All sweet things he bade sift, and ground As a man grindeth wheat in mills With strong wheels alway going round; He gave thee corn, and grass that fills The cattle on a thousand hills. The wine of many seasons fed Thy mouth, and made it fair and clean; Sweet oil was poured out on thy head And ran down like cool rain between The strait close locks it melted in. The strong men and the captains knew Thy chambers wrought and fashioned With gold and covering of blue, And the blue raiment of thine head Who satest on a stately bed. All these had on their garments wrought The shape of beasts and creeping things, The body that availeth not, Flat backs of worms and veinèd wings, And the lewd bulk that sleeps and stings. Also the chosen of the years, The multitude being at ease, With sackbuts and with dulcimers And noise of shawms and psalteries Made mirth within the ears of these. But as a common woman doth, Thou didst think evil and devise; The sweet smell of thy breast and mouth Thou madest as the harlot's wise, And there was painting on thine eyes. Yea, in the woven guest-chamber And by the painted passages Where the strange gracious paintings were, State upon state of companies, There came on thee the lust of these. Because of shapes on either wall Sea-coloured from some rare blue shell At many a Tyrian interval, Horsemen on horses, girdled well, Delicate and desirable, Thou saidest: I am sick of love: Stay me with flagons, comfort me With apples for my pain thereof Till my hands gather in his tree That fruit wherein my lips would be. Yea, saidest thou, I will go up When there is no more shade than one May cover with a hollow cup, And make my bed against the sun Till my blood's violence be done. Thy mouth was leant upon the wall Against the painted mouth, thy chin Touched the hair's painted curve and fall; Thy deep throat, fallen lax and thin, Worked as the blood's beat worked therein. Therefore, O thou Aholibah, God is not glad because of thee; And thy fine gold shall pass away Like those fair coins of ore that be Washed over by the middle sea. Then will one make thy body bare To strip it of all gracious things, And pluck the cover from thine hair, And break the gift of many kings, Thy wrist-rings and thine ankle-rings. Likewise the man whose body joins To thy smooth body, as was said, Who hath a girdle on his loins And dyed attire upon his head— The same who, seeing, worshipped, Because thy face was like the face Of a clean maiden that smells sweet, Because thy gait was as the pace Of one that opens not her feet And is not heard within the street— Even he, O thou Aholibah, Made separate from thy desire, Shall cut thy nose and ears away And bruise thee for thy body's hire And burn the residue with fire. Then shall the heathen people say, The multitude being at ease; Lo, this is that Aholibah Whose name was blown among strange seas, Grown old with soft adulteries. Also her bed was made of green, Her windows beautiful for glass That she had made her bed between: Yea, for pure lust her body was Made like white summer-coloured grass. Her raiment was a strong man's spoil; Upon a table by a bed She set mine incense and mine oil To be the beauty of her head In chambers walled about with red. Also between the walls she had Fair faces of strong men portrayed; All girded round the loins, and clad With several cloths of woven braid And garments marvellously made. Therefore the wrath of God shall be Set as a watch upon her way; And whoso findeth by the sea Blown dust of bones will hardly say If this were that Aholibah. LOVE AND SLEEP Lying asleep between the strokes of night I saw my love lean over my sad bed, Pale as the duskiest lily's leaf or head, Smooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite, Too wan for blushing and too warm for white, But perfect-coloured without white or red. And her lips opened amorously, and said— I wist not what, saving one word—Delight. And all her face was honey to my mouth, And all her body pasture to mine eyes; The long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire, The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south, The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs And glittering eyelids of my soul's desire. MADONNA MIA Under green apple-boughs That never a storm will rouse, My lady hath her house Between two bowers; In either of the twain Red roses full of rain; She hath for bondwomen All kind of flowers. She hath no handmaid fair To draw her curled gold hair Through rings of gold that bear Her whole hair's weight; She hath no maids to stand Gold-clothed on either hand; In all the great green land None is so great. She hath no more to wear But one white hood of vair Drawn over eyes and hair, Wrought with strange gold, Made for some great queen's head, Some fair great queen since dead; And one strait gown of red Against the cold. Beneath her eyelids deep Love lying seems asleep, Love, swift to wake, to weep, To laugh, to gaze; Her breasts are like white birds, And all her gracious words As water-grass to herds In the June-days. To her all dews that fall And rains are musical; Her flowers are fed from all, Her joy from these; In the deep-feathered firs Their gift of joy is hers, In the least breath that stirs Across the trees. She grows with greenest leaves, Ripens with reddest sheaves, Forgets, remembers, grieves, And is not sad; The quiet lands and skies Leave light upon her eyes; None knows her, weak or wise, Or tired or glad. None knows, none understands, What flowers are like her hands; Though you should search all lands Wherein time grows, What snows are like her feet, Though his eyes burn with heat Through gazing on my sweet, Yet no man knows. Only this thing is said; That white and gold and red, God's three chief words, man's bread And oil and wine, Were given her for dowers, And kingdom of all hours, And grace of goodly flowers And various vine. This is my lady's praise: God after many days Wrought her in unknown ways, In sunset lands; This was my lady's birth; God gave her might and mirth And laid his whole sweet earth Between her hands. Under deep apple-boughs My lady hath her house; She wears upon her brows The flower thereof; All saying but what God saith To her is as vain breath; She is more strong than death, Being strong as love. THE KING'S DAUGHTER We were ten maidens in the green corn, Small red leaves in the mill-water: Fairer maidens never were born, Apples of gold for the king's daughter. We were ten maidens by a well-head, Small white birds in the mill-water: Sweeter maidens never were wed, Rings of red for the king's daughter. The first to spin, the second to sing, Seeds of wheat in the mill-water; The third may was a goodly thing, White bread and brown for the king's daughter. The fourth to sew and the fifth to play, Fair green weed in the mill-water; The sixth may was a goodly may, White wine and red for the king's daughter. The seventh to woo, the eighth to wed, Fair thin reeds in the mill-water; The ninth had gold work on her head, Honey in the comb for the king's daughter. The ninth had gold work round her hair, Fallen flowers in the mill-water; The tenth may was goodly and fair, Golden gloves for the king's daughter. We were ten maidens in a field green, Fallen fruit in the mill-water; Fairer maidens never have been, Golden sleeves for the king's daughter. By there comes the king's young son, A little wind in the mill-water; “Out of ten maidens ye'll grant me one,” A crown of red for the king's daughter. “Out of ten mays ye'll give me the best,” A little rain in the mill-water; A bed of yellow straw for all the rest, A bed of gold for the king's daughter. He's ta'en out the goodliest, Rain that rains in the mill-water; A comb of yellow shell for all the rest, A comb of gold for the king's daughter. He's made her bed to the goodliest, Wind and hail in the mill-water; A grass girdle for all the rest, A girdle of arms for the king's daughter. He's set his heart to the goodliest, Snow that snows in the mill-water; Nine little kisses for all the rest, An hundredfold for the king's daughter. He's ta'en his leave at the goodliest, Broken boats in the mill-water; Golden gifts for all the rest, Sorrow of heart for the king's daughter. “Ye'll make a grave for my fair body,” Running rain in the mill-water; “And ye'll streek my brother at the side of me,” The pains of hell for the king's daughter. AFTER DEATH The four boards of the coffin lid Heard all the dead man did. The first curse was in his mouth, Made of grave's mould and deadly drouth. The next curse was in his head, Made of God's work discomfited. The next curse was in his hands, Made out of two grave-bands. The next curse was in his feet, Made out of a grave-sheet. “I had fair coins red and white, And my name was as great light; I had fair clothes green and red, And strong gold bound round my head. But no meat comes in my mouth, Now I fare as the worm doth; And no gold binds in my hair, Now I fare as the blind fare. My live thews were of great strength, Now am I waxen a span's length; My live sides were full of lust, Now are they dried with dust.” The first board spake and said: “Is it best eating flesh or bread?” The second answered it: “Is wine or honey the more sweet?” The third board spake and said: “Is red gold worth a girl's gold head?” The fourth made answer thus: “All these things are as one with us.” The dead man asked of them: “Is the green land stained brown with flame? Have they hewn my son for beasts to eat, And my wife's body for beasts' meat? Have they boiled my maid in a brass pan, And built a gallows to hang my man?” The boards said to him: “This is a lewd thing that ye deem. Your wife has gotten a golden bed, All the sheets are sewn with red. Your son has gotten a coat of silk, The sleeves are soft as curded milk. Your maid has gotten a kirtle new, All the skirt has braids of blue. Your man has gotten both ring and glove, Wrought well for eyes to love.” The dead man answered thus: “What good gift shall God give us?” The boards answered him anon: “Flesh to feed hell's worm upon.” MAY JANET (BRETON) “Stand up, stand up, thou May Janet, And go to the wars with me.” He's drawn her by both hands With her face against the sea. “He that strews red shall gather white, He that sows white reap red, Before your face and my daughter's Meet in a marriage-bed. “Gold coin shall grow in the yellow field, Green corn in the green sea-water, And red fruit grow of the rose's red, Ere your fruit grow in her.” “But I shall have her by land,” he said, “Or I shall have her by sea, Or I shall have her by strong treason And no grace go with me.” Her father's drawn her by both hands, He's rent her gown from her, He's ta'en the smock round her body, Cast in the sea-water. The captain's drawn her by both sides Out of the fair green sea; “Stand up, stand up, thou May Janet, And come to the war with me.” The first town they came to There was a blue bride-chamber; He clothed her on with silk And belted her with amber. The second town they came to The bridesmen feasted knee to knee; He clothed her on with silver, A stately thing to see. The third town they came to The bridesmaids all had gowns of gold; He clothed her on with purple, A rich thing to behold. The last town they came to He clothed her white and red, With a green flag either side of her And a gold flag overhead. THE BLOODY SON (FINNISH) “O where have ye been the morn sae late, My merry son, come tell me hither? O where have ye been the morn sae late? And I wot I hae not anither.” “By the water-gate, by the water-gate, O dear mither.” “And whatten kin' o' wark had ye there to make, My merry son, come tell me hither? And whatten kin' o' wark had ye there to make? And I wot I hae not anither.” “I watered my steeds with water frae the lake, O dear mither.” “Why is your coat sae fouled the day, My merry son, come tell me hither? Why is your coat sae fouled the day? And I wot I hae not anither.” “The steeds were stamping sair by the weary banks of clay, O dear mither.” “And where gat ye thae sleeves of red, My merry son, come tell me hither? And where gat ye thae sleeves of red? And I wot I hae not anither.” “I have slain my ae brither by the weary water-head, O dear mither.” “And where will ye gang to mak your mend, My merry son, come tell me hither? And where will ye gang to mak your mend? And I wot I hae not anither.” “The warldis way, to the warldis end, O dear mither.” “And what will ye leave your father dear, My merry son, come tell me hither? And what will ye leave your father dear? And I wot I hae not anither.” “The wood to fell and the logs to bear, For he'll never see my body mair, O dear mither.” “And what will ye leave your mither dear, My merry son, come tell me hither? And what will ye leave your mither dear? And I wot I hae not anither.” “The wool to card and the wool to wear, For ye'll never see my body mair, O dear mither.” “And what will ye leave for your wife to take, My merry son, come tell me hither? And what will ye leave for your wife to take? And I wot I hae not anither.” “A goodly gown and a fair new make, For she'll do nae mair for my body's sake, O dear mither.” “And what will ye leave your young son fair, My merry son, come tell me hither? And what will ye leave your young son fair? And I wot ye hae not anither.” “A twiggen school-rod for his body to bear, Though it garred him greet he'll get nae mair, O dear mither.” “And what will ye leave your little daughter sweet, My merry son, come tell me hither? And what will ye leave your little daughter sweet? And I wot ye hae not anither.” “Wild mulberries for her mouth to eat, She'll get nae mair though it garred her greet, O dear mither.” “And when will ye come back frae roamin', My merry son, come tell me hither? And when will ye come back frae roamin'? And I wot I hae not anither.” “When the sunrise out of the north is comen, O dear mither.” “When shall the sunrise on the north side be, My merry son, come tell me hither? When shall the sunrise on the north side be? And I wot I hae not anither.” “When chuckie-stanes shall swim in the sea, O dear mither.” “When shall stanes in the sea swim, My merry son, come tell me hither? When shall stanes in the sea swim? And I wot I hae not anither.” “When birdies' feathers are as lead therein, O dear mither.” “When shall feathers be as lead, My merry son, come tell me hither? When shall feathers be as lead? And I wot I hae not anither.” “When God shall judge between the quick and dead, O dear mither.” THE SEA-SWALLOWS This fell when Christmas lights were done, (Red rose leaves will never make wine) But before the Easter lights begun; The ways are sair fra' the Till to the Tyne. Two lovers sat where the rowan blows And all the grass is heavy and fine, By the gathering-place of the sea-swallows When the wind brings them over Tyne. Blossom of broom will never make bread, Red rose leaves will never make wine; Between her brows she is grown red, That was full white in the fields by Tyne. “O what is this thing ye have on, Show me now, sweet daughter of mine?” “O father, this is my little son That I found hid in the sides of Tyne. “O what will ye give my son to eat, Red rose leaves will never make wine?” “Fen-water and adder's meat.” The ways are sair fra' the Till to the Tyne. “Or what will ye get my son to wear?” (Red rose leaves will never make wine.) “A weed and a web of nettle's hair.” The ways are sair fra' the Till to the Tyne. “Or what will ye take to line his bed?” (Red rose leaves will never make wine.) “Two black stones at the kirkwall's head.” The ways are sair fra' the Till to the Tyne. “Or what will ye give my son for land?” (Red rose leaves will never make wine.) “Three girl's paces of red sand.” The ways are sair fra' the Till to the Tyne. “Or what will ye give me for my son?” (Red rose leaves will never make wine.) “Six times to kiss his young mouth on.” The ways are sair fra' the Till to the Tyne. “But what have ye done with the bearing-bread, And what have ye made of the washing-wine? Or where have ye made your bearing-bed, To bear a son in the sides of Tyne?” “The bearing-bread is soft and new, There is no soil in the straining wine; The bed was made between green and blue, It stands full soft by the sides of Tyne. “The fair grass was my bearing-bread, The well-water my washing-wine; The low leaves were my bearing-bed, And that was best in the sides of Tyne.” “O daughter, if ye have done this thing, I wot the greater grief is mine; This was a bitter child-bearing, When ye were got by the sides of Tyne. “About the time of sea-swallows That fly full thick by six and nine, Ye'll have my body out of the house, To bury me by the sides of Tyne. “Set nine stones by the wall for twain,” (Red rose leaves will never make wine) “For the bed I take will measure ten.” The ways are sair fra' the Till to the Tyne. “Tread twelve girl's paces out for three,” (Red rose leaves will never make wine) “For the pit I made has taken me.” The ways are sair fra' the Till to the Tyne. THE YEAR OF LOVE There were four loves that one by one, Following the seasons and the sun, Passed over without tears, and fell Away without farewell. The first was made of gold and tears, The next of aspen-leaves and fears, The third of rose-boughs and rose-roots, The last love of strange fruits. These were the four loves faded. Hold Some minutes fast the time of gold When our lips each way clung and clove To a face full of love. The tears inside our eyelids met, Wrung forth with kissing, and wept wet The faces cleaving each to each Where the blood served for speech. The second, with low patient brows Bound under aspen-coloured boughs And eyes made strong and grave with sleep And yet too weak to weep— The third, with eager mouth at ease Fed from late autumn honey, lees Of scarce gold left in latter cells With scattered flower-smells— Hair sprinkled over with spoilt sweet Of ruined roses, wrists and feet Slight-swathed, as grassy-girdled sheaves Hold in stray poppy-leaves— The fourth, with lips whereon has bled Some great pale fruit's slow colour, shed From the rank bitter husk whence drips Faint blood between her lips— Made of the heat of whole great Junes Burning the blue dark round their moons (Each like a mown red marigold) So hard the flame keeps hold— These are burnt thoroughly away. Only the first holds out a day Beyond these latter loves that were Made of mere heat and air. And now the time is winterly The first love fades too: none will see, When April warms the world anew, The place wherein love grew. DEDICATION 1865 The sea gives her shells to the shingle, The earth gives her streams to the sea; They are many, but my gift is single, My verses, the firstfruits of me. Let the wind take the green and the grey leaf, Cast forth without fruit upon air; Take rose-leaf and vine-leaf and bay-leaf Blown loose from the hair. The night shakes them round me in legions, Dawn drives them before her like dreams; Time sheds them like snows on strange regions, Swept shoreward on infinite streams; Leaves pallid and sombre and ruddy, Dead fruits of the fugitive years; Some stained as with wine and made bloody, And some as with tears. Some scattered in seven years' traces, As they fell from the boy that was then; Long left among idle green places, Or gathered but now among men; On seas full of wonder and peril, Blown white round the capes of the north; Or in islands where myrtles are sterile And loves bring not forth. O daughters of dreams and of stories That life is not wearied of yet, Faustine, Fragoletta, Dolores, Félise and Yolande and Juliette, Shall I find you not still, shall I miss you, When sleep, that is true or that seems, Comes back to me hopeless to kiss you, O daughters of dreams? They are past as a slumber that passes, As the dew of a dawn of old time; More frail than the shadows on glasses, More fleet than a wave or a rhyme. As the waves after ebb drawing seaward, When their hollows are full of the night, So the birds that flew singing to me-ward Recede out of sight. The songs of dead seasons, that wander On wings of articulate words; Lost leaves that the shore-wind may squander, Light flocks of untameable birds; Some sang to me dreaming in class-time And truant in hand as in tongue; For the youngest were born of boy's pastime, The eldest are young. Is there shelter while life in them lingers, Is there hearing for songs that recede, Tunes touched from a harp with man's fingers Or blown with boy's mouth in a reed? Is there place in the land of your labour, Is there room in your world of delight, Where change has not sorrow for neighbour And day has not night? In their wings though the sea-wind yet quivers, Will you spare not a space for them there Made green with the running of rivers And gracious with temperate air; In the fields and the turreted cities, That cover from sunshine and rain Fair passions and bountiful pities And loves without stain? In a land of clear colours and stories, In a region of shadowless hours, Where earth has a garment of glories And a murmur of musical flowers; In woods where the spring half uncovers The flush of her amorous face, By the waters that listen for lovers, For these is there place? For the song-birds of sorrow, that muffle Their music as clouds do their fire: For the storm-birds of passion, that ruffle Wild wings in a wind of desire; In the stream of the storm as it settles Blown seaward, borne far from the sun, Shaken loose on the darkness like petals Dropt one after one? Though the world of your hands be more gracious And lovelier in lordship of things Clothed round by sweet art with the spacious Warm heaven of her imminent wings, Let them enter, unfledged and nigh fainting, For the love of old loves and lost times; And receive in your palace of painting This revel of rhymes. Though the seasons of man full of losses Make empty the years full of youth, If but one thing be constant in crosses, Change lays not her hand upon truth; Hopes die, and their tombs are for token That the grief as the joy of them ends Ere time that breaks all men has broken The faith between friends. Though the many lights dwindle to one light, There is help if the heaven has one; Though the skies be discrowned of the sunlight And the earth dispossessed of the sun, They have moonlight and sleep for repayment, When, refreshed as a bride and set free, With stars and sea-winds in her raiment, Night sinks on the sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II. SONGS BEFORE SUNRISE AND SONGS OF TWO NATIONS DEDICATION TO JOSEPH MAZZINI Take, since you bade it should bear, These, of the seed of your sowing, Blossom or berry or weed. Sweet though they be not, or fair, That the dew of your word kept growing, Sweet at least was the seed. Men bring you love-offerings of tears, And sorrow the kiss that assuages, And slaves the hate-offering of wrongs, And time the thanksgiving of years, And years the thanksgiving of ages; I bring you my handful of songs. If a perfume be left, if a bloom, Let it live till Italia be risen, To be strewn in the dust of her car When her voice shall awake from the tomb England, and France from her prison, Sisters, a star by a star. I bring you the sword of a song, The sword of my spirit's desire, Feeble; but laid at your feet, That which was weak shall be strong, That which was cold shall take fire, That which was bitter be sweet. It was wrought not with hands to smite, Nor hewn after swordsmiths' fashion, Nor tempered on anvil of steel; But with visions and dreams of the night, But with hope, and the patience of passion, And the signet of love for a seal. Be it witness, till one more strong, Till a loftier lyre, till a rarer Lute praise her better than I, Be it witness before you, my song, That I knew her, the world's banner-bearer, Who shall cry the republican cry. Yea, even she as at first, Yea, she alone and none other, Shall cast down, shall build up, shall bring home; Slake earth's hunger and thirst, Lighten, and lead as a mother; First name of the world's names, Rome. SONGS BEFORE SUNRISE PRELUDE Between the green bud and the red Youth sat and sang by Time, and shed From eyes and tresses flowers and tears, From heart and spirit hopes and fears, Upon the hollow stream whose bed Is channelled by the foamless years; And with the white the gold-haired head Mixed running locks, and in Time's ears Youth's dreams hung singing, and Time's truth Was half not harsh in the ears of Youth. Between the bud and the blown flower Youth talked with joy and grief an hour, With footless joy and wingless grief And twin-born faith and disbelief Who share the seasons to devour; And long ere these made up their sheaf Felt the winds round him shake and shower The rose-red and the blood-red leaf, Delight whose germ grew never grain, And passion dyed in its own pain. Then he stood up, and trod to dust Fear and desire, mistrust and trust, And dreams of bitter sleep and sweet, And bound for sandals on his feet Knowledge and patience of what must And what things may be, in the heat And cold of years that rot and rust And alter; and his spirit's meat Was freedom, and his staff was wrought Of strength, and his cloak woven of thought. For what has he whose will sees clear To do with doubt and faith and fear, Swift hopes and slow despondencies? His heart is equal with the sea's And with the sea-wind's, and his ear Is level to the speech of these, And his soul communes and takes cheer With the actual earth's equalities, Air, light, and night, hills, winds, and streams, And seeks not strength from strengthless dreams. His soul is even with the sun Whose spirit and whose eye are one, Who seeks not stars by day, nor light And heavy heat of day by night. Him can no God cast down, whom none Can lift in hope beyond the height Of fate and nature and things done By the calm rule of might and right That bids men be and bear and do, And die beneath blind skies or blue. To him the lights of even and morn Speak no vain things of love or scorn, Fancies and passions miscreate By man in things dispassionate. Nor holds he fellowship forlorn With souls that pray and hope and hate, And doubt they had better not been born, And fain would lure or scare off fate And charm their doomsman from their doom And make fear dig its own false tomb. He builds not half of doubts and half Of dreams his own soul's cenotaph, Whence hopes and fears with helpless eyes, Wrapt loose in cast-off cerecloths, rise And dance and wring their hands and laugh, And weep thin tears and sigh light sighs, And without living lips would quaff The living spring in man that lies, And drain his soul of faith and strength It might have lived on a life's length. He hath given himself and hath not sold To God for heaven or man for gold, Or grief for comfort that it gives, Or joy for grief's restoratives. He hath given himself to time, whose fold Shuts in the mortal flock that lives On its plain pasture's heat and cold And the equal year's alternatives. Earth, heaven, and time, death, life, and he, Endure while they shall be to be. “Yet between death and life are hours To flush with love and hide in flowers; What profit save in these?” men cry: “Ah, see, between soft earth and sky, What only good things here are ours!” They say, “what better wouldst thou try, What sweeter sing of? or what powers Serve, that will give thee ere thou die More joy to sing and be less sad, More heart to play and grow more glad?” Play then and sing; we too have played, We likewise, in that subtle shade. We too have twisted through our hair Such tendrils as the wild Loves wear, And heard what mirth the Mænads made, Till the wind blew our garlands bare And left their roses disarrayed, And smote the summer with strange air, And disengirdled and discrowned The limbs and locks that vine-wreaths bound. We too have tracked by star-proof trees The tempest of the Thyiades Scare the loud night on hills that hid The blood-feasts of the Bassarid, Heard their song's iron cadences Fright the wolf hungering from the kid, Outroar the lion-throated seas, Outchide the north-wind if it chid, And hush the torrent-tongued ravines With thunders of their tambourines. But the fierce flute whose notes acclaim Dim goddesses of fiery fame, Cymbal and clamorous kettledrum, Timbrels and tabrets, all are dumb That turned the high chill air to flame; The singing tongues of fire are numb That called on Cotys by her name ????? ????? ?? ???? ???????.Æsch. Fr. 54 (??????). Edonian, till they felt her come And maddened, and her mystic face Lightened along the streams of Thrace. For Pleasure slumberless and pale, And Passion with rejected veil, Pass, and the tempest-footed throng Of hours that follow them with song Till their feet flag and voices fail, And lips that were so loud so long Learn silence, or a wearier wail; So keen is change, and time so strong, To weave the robes of life and rend And weave again till life have end. But weak is change, but strengthless time, To take the light from heaven, or climb The hills of heaven with wasting feet. Songs they can stop that earth found meet, But the stars keep their ageless rhyme; Flowers they can slay that spring thought sweet, But the stars keep their spring sublime; Passions and pleasures can defeat, Actions and agonies control, And life and death, but not the soul. Because man's soul is man's God still, What wind soever waft his will Across the waves of day and night To port or shipwreck, left or right, By shores and shoals of good and ill; And still its flame at mainmast height Through the rent air that foam-flakes fill Sustains the indomitable light Whence only man hath strength to steer Or helm to handle without fear. Save his own soul's light overhead, None leads him, and none ever led, Across birth's hidden harbour-bar, Past youth where shoreward shallows are, Through age that drives on toward the red Vast void of sunset hailed from far, To the equal waters of the dead; Save his own soul he hath no star, And sinks, except his own soul guide, Helmless in middle turn of tide. No blast of air or fire of sun Puts out the light whereby we run With girded loins our lamplit race, And each from each takes heart of grace And spirit till his turn be done, And light of face from each man's face In whom the light of trust is one; Since only souls that keep their place By their own light, and watch things roll, And stand, have light for any soul. A little time we gain from time To set our seasons in some chime, For harsh or sweet or loud or low, With seasons played out long ago And souls that in their time and prime Took part with summer or with snow, Lived abject lives out or sublime, And had their chance of seed to sow For service or disservice done To those days dead and this their son. A little time that we may fill Or with such good works or such ill As loose the bonds or make them strong Wherein all manhood suffers wrong. By rose-hung river and light-foot rill There are who rest not; who think long Till they discern as from a hill At the sun's hour of morning song, Known of souls only, and those souls free, The sacred spaces of the sea. THE EVE OF REVOLUTION 1 The trumpets of the four winds of the world From the ends of the earth blow battle; the night heaves, With breasts palpitating and wings refurled, With passion of couched limbs, as one who grieves Sleeping, and in her sleep she sees uncurled Dreams serpent-shapen, such as sickness weaves, Down the wild wind of vision caught and whirled, Dead leaves of sleep, thicker than autumn leaves, Shadows of storm-shaped things, Flights of dim tribes of kings, The reaping men that reap men for their sheaves, And, without grain to yield, Their scythe-swept harvest-field Thronged thick with men pursuing and fugitives, Dead foliage of the tree of sleep, Leaves blood-coloured and golden, blown from deep to deep. 2 I hear the midnight on the mountains cry With many tongues of thunders, and I hear Sound and resound the hollow shield of sky With trumpet-throated winds that charge and cheer, And through the roar of the hours that fighting fly, Through flight and fight and all the fluctuant fear, A sound sublimer than the heavens are high, A voice more instant than the winds are clear, Say to my spirit, “Take Thy trumpet too, and make A rallying music in the void night's ear, Till the storm lose its track, And all the night go back; Till, as through sleep false life knows true life near, Thou know the morning through the night, And through the thunder silence, and through darkness light.” 3 I set the trumpet to my lips and blow. The height of night is shaken, the skies break, The winds and stars and waters come and go By fits of breath and light and sound, that wake As out of sleep, and perish as the show Built up of sleep, when all her strengths forsake The sense-compelling spirit; the depths glow, The heights flash, and the roots and summits shake Of earth in all her mountains, And the inner foamless fountains And wellsprings of her fast-bound forces quake; Yea, the whole air of life Is set on fire of strife, Till change unmake things made and love remake; Reason and love, whose names are one, Seeing reason is the sunlight shed from love the sun. 4 The night is broken eastward; is it day, Or but the watchfires trembling here and there, Like hopes on memory's devastated way, In moonless wastes of planet-stricken air? O many-childed mother great and grey, O multitudinous bosom, and breasts that bare Our fathers' generations, whereat lay The weanling peoples and the tribes that were, Whose new-born mouths long dead Those ninefold nipples fed, Dim face with deathless eyes and withered hair, Fostress of obscure lands, Whose multpilying hands Wove the world's web with divers races fair And cast it waif-wise on the stream, The waters of the centuries, where thou sat'st to dream; 5 O many-minded mother and visionary, Asia, that sawest their westering waters sweep With all the ships and spoils of time to carry And all the fears and hopes of life to keep, Thy vesture wrought of ages legendary Hides usward thine impenetrable sleep, And thy veiled head, night's oldest tributary, We know not if it speak or smile or weep. But where for us began The first live light of man And first-born fire of deeds to burn and leap, The first war fair as peace To shine and lighten Greece, And the first freedom moved upon the deep, God's breath upon the face of time Moving, a present spirit, seen of men sublime; 6 There where our east looks always to thy west, Our mornings to thine evenings, Greece to thee, These lights that catch the mountains crest by crest, Are they of stars or beacons that we see? Taygetus takes here the winds abreast, And there the sun resumes Thermopylæ; The light is Athens where those remnants rest, And Salamis the sea-wall of that sea. The grass men tread upon Is very Marathon, The leaves are of that time-unstricken tree That storm nor sun can fret Nor wind, since she that set Made it her sign to men whose shield was she; Here, as dead time his deathless things, Eurotas and Cephisus keep their sleepless springs. 7 O hills of Crete, are these things dead? O waves, O many-mouthèd streams, are these springs dry? Earth, dost thou feed and hide now none but slaves? Heaven, hast thou heard of men that would not die? Is the land thick with only such men's graves As were ashamed to look upon the sky? Ye dead, whose name outfaces and outbraves Death, is the seed of such as you gone by? Sea, have thy ports not heard Some Marathonian word Rise up to landward and to Godward fly? No thunder, that the skies Sent not upon us, rise With fire and earthquake and a cleaving cry? Nay, light is here, and shall be light, Though all the face of the hour be overborne with night. 8 I set the trumpet to my lips and blow. The night is broken northward; the pale plains And footless fields of sun-forgotten snow Feel through their creviced lips and iron veins Such quick breath labour and such clean blood flow As summer-stricken spring feels in her pains When dying May bears June, too young to know The fruit that waxes from the flower that wanes; Strange tyrannies and vast, Tribes frost-bound to their past, Lands that are loud all through their length with chains, Wastes where the wind's wings break, Displumed by daylong ache And anguish of blind snows and rack-blown rains, And ice that seals the White Sea's lips, Whose monstrous weights crush flat the sides of shrieking ships; 9 Horrible sights and sounds of the unreached pole, And shrill fierce climes of inconsolable air, Shining below the beamless aureole That hangs about the north-wind's hurtling hair, A comet-lighted lamp, sublime and sole Dawn of the dayless heaven where suns despair; Earth, skies, and waters, smitten into soul, Feel the hard veil that iron centuries wear Rent as with hands in sunder, Such hands as make the thunder And clothe with form all substance and strip bare; Shapes, shadows, sounds and lights Of their dead days and nights Take soul of life too keen for death to bear; Life, conscience, forethought, will, desire, Flood men's inanimate eyes and dry-drawn hearts with fire. 10 Light, light, and light! to break and melt in sunder All clouds and chains that in one bondage bind Eyes, hands, and spirits, forged by fear and wonder And sleek fierce fraud with hidden knife behind; There goes no fire from heaven before their thunder, Nor are the links not malleable that wind Round the snared limbs and souls that ache thereunder; The hands are mighty, were the head not blind. Priest is the staff of king, And chains and clouds one thing, And fettered flesh with devastated mind. Open thy soul to see, Slave, and thy feet are free; Thy bonds and thy beliefs are one in kind, And of thy fears thine irons wrought Hang weights upon thee fashioned out of thine own thought. 11 O soul, O God, O glory of liberty, To night and day their lightning and their light! With heat of heart thou kindlest the quick sea, And the dead earth takes spirit from thy sight; The natural body of things is warm with thee, And the world's weakness parcel of thy might; Thou seest us feeble and forceless, fit to be Slaves of the years that drive us left and right, Drowned under hours like waves Wherethrough we row like slaves; But if thy finger touch us, these take flight. If but one sovereign word Of thy live lips be heard, What man shall stop us, and what God shall smite? Do thou but look in our dead eyes, They are stars that light each other till thy sundawn rise. 12 Thou art the eye of this blind body of man, The tongue of this dumb people; shalt thou not See, shalt thou speak not for them? Time is wan And hope is weak with waiting, and swift thought Hath lost the wings at heel wherewith he ran, And on the red pit's edge sits down distraught To talk with death of days republican And dreams and fights long since dreamt out and fought; Of the last hope that drew To that red edge anew The firewhite faith of Poland without spot; Of the blind Russian might, And fire that is not light; Of the green Rhineland where thy spirit wrought; But though time, hope, and memory tire, Canst thou wax dark as they do, thou whose light is fire? 13 I set the trumpet to my lips and blow. The night is broken westward; the wide sea That makes immortal motion to and fro From world's end unto world's end, and shall be When nought now grafted of men's hands shall grow And as the weed in last year's waves are we Or spray the sea-wind shook a year ago From its sharp tresses down the storm to lee, The moving god that hides Time in its timeless tides Wherein time dead seems live eternity, That breaks and makes again Much mightier things than men, Doth it not hear change coming, or not see? Are the deeps deaf and dead and blind, To catch no light or sound from landward of mankind? 14 O thou, clothed round with raiment of white waves, Thy brave brows lightening through the grey wet air, Thou, lulled with sea-sounds of a thousand caves, And lit with sea-shine to thine inland lair, Whose freedom clothed the naked souls of slaves And stripped the muffled souls of tyrants bare, O, by the centuries of thy glorious graves, By the live light of the earth that was thy care, Live, thou must not be dead, Live; let thine armèd head Lift itself up to sunward and the fair Daylight of time and man, Thine head republican, With the same splendour on thine helmless hair That in his eyes kept up a light Who on thy glory gazed away their sacred sight; 15 Who loved and looked their sense to death on thee; Who taught thy lips imperishable things, And in thine ears outsang thy singing sea; Who made thy foot firm on the necks of kings And thy soul somewhile steadfast—woe are we It was but for a while, and all the strings Were broken of thy spirit; yet had he Set to such tunes and clothed it with such wings It seemed for his sole sake Impossible to break, And woundless of the worm that waits and stings, The golden-headed worm Made headless for a term, The king-snake whose life kindles with the spring's, To breathe his soul upon her bloom, And while she marks not turn her temple to her tomb. 16 By those eyes blinded and that heavenly head And the secluded soul adorable, O Milton's land, what ails thee to be dead? Thine ears are yet sonorous with his shell That all the songs of all thy sea-line fed With motive sound of spring-tides at mid swell, And through thine heart his thought as blood is shed, Requickening thee with wisdom to do well; Such sons were of thy womb, England, for love of whom Thy name is not yet writ with theirs that fell, But, till thou quite forget What were thy children, yet On the pale lips of hope is as a spell; And Shelley's heart and Landor's mind Lit thee with latter watch-fires; why wilt thou be blind? 17 Though all were else indifferent, all that live Spiritless shapes of nations; though time wait In vain on hope till these have help to give, And faith and love crawl famished from the gate; Canst thou sit shamed and self-contemplative With soulless eyes on thy secluded fate? Though time forgive them, thee shall he forgive, Whose choice was in thine hand to be so great? Who cast out of thy mind The passion of man's kind, And made thee and thine old name separate? Now when time looks to see New names and old and thee Build up our one Republic state by state, England with France, and France with Spain, And Spain with sovereign Italy strike hands and reign. 18 O known and unknown fountain-heads that fill Our dear life-springs of England! O bright race Of streams and waters that bear witness still To the earth her sons were made of! O fair face Of England, watched of eyes death cannot kill, How should the soul that lit you for a space Fall through sick weakness of a broken will To the dead cold damnation of disgrace? Such wind of memory stirs On all green hills of hers, Such breath of record from so high a place, From years whose tongues of flame Prophesied in her name Her feet should keep truth's bright and burning trace, We needs must have her heart with us, Whose hearts are one with man's; she must be dead or thus. 19 Who is against us? who is on our side? Whose heart of all men's hearts is one with man's? Where art thou that wast prophetess and bride, When truth and thou trod under time and chance? What latter light of what new hope shall guide Out of the snares of hell thy feet, O France? What heel shall bruise these heads that hiss and glide, What wind blow out these fen-born fires that dance Before thee to thy death? No light, no life, no breath, From thy dead eyes and lips shall take the trance, Till on that deadliest crime Reddening the feet of time Who treads through blood and passes, time shall glance Pardon, and Italy forgive, And Rome arise up whom thou slewest, and bid thee live. 20 I set the trumpet to my lips and blow. The night is broken southward; the springs run, The daysprings and the watersprings that flow Forth with one will from where their source was one, Out of the might of morning: high and low, The hungering hills feed full upon the sun, The thirsting valleys drink of him and glow As a heart burns with some divine thing done, Or as blood burns again In the bruised heart of Spain, A rose renewed with red new life begun, Dragged down with thorns and briers, That puts forth buds like fires Till the whole tree take flower in unison, And prince that clogs and priest that clings Be cast as weeds upon the dunghill of dead things. 21 Ah heaven, bow down, be nearer! This is she, Italia, the world's wonder, the world's care, Free in her heart ere quite her hands be free, And lovelier than her loveliest robe of air. The earth hath voice, and speech is in the sea, Sounds of great joy, too beautiful to bear; All things are glad because of her, but we Most glad, who loved her when the worst days were. O sweetest, fairest, first, O flower, when times were worst, Thou hadst no stripe wherein we had no share. Have not our hearts held close, Kept fast the whole world's rose? Have we not worn thee at heart whom none would wear? First love and last love, light of lands, Shall we not touch thee full-blown with our lips and hands? 22 O too much loved, what shall we say of thee? What shall we make of our heart's burning fire, The passion in our lives that fain would be Made each a brand to pile into the pyre That shall burn up thy foemen, and set free The flame whence thy sun-shadowing wings aspire? Love of our life, what more than men are we, That this our breath for thy sake should expire, For whom to joyous death Glad gods might yield their breath, Great gods drop down from heaven to serve for hire? We are but men, are we, And thou art Italy; What shall we do for thee with our desire? What gift shall we deserve to give? How shall we die to do thee service, or how live? 23 The very thought in us how much we love thee Makes the throat sob with love and blinds the eyes. How should love bear thee, to behold above thee His own light burning from reverberate skies? They give thee light, but the light given them of thee Makes faint the wheeling fires that fall and rise. What love, what life, what death of man's should move thee, What face that lingers or what foot that flies? It is not heaven that lights Thee with such days and nights, But thou that heaven is lit from in such wise. O thou her dearest birth, Turn thee to lighten earth, Earth too that bore thee and yearns to thee and cries; Stand up, shine, lighten, become flame, Till as the sun's name through all nations be thy name. 24 I take the trumpet from my lips and sing. O life immeasurable and imminent love, And fear like winter leading hope like spring, Whose flower-bright brows the day-star sits above, Whose hand unweariable and untiring wing Strike music from a world that wailed and strove, Each bright soul born and every glorious thing, From very freedom to man's joy thereof, O time, O change and death, Whose now not hateful breath But gives the music swifter feet to move Through sharp remeasuring tones Of refluent antiphones More tender-tuned than heart or throat of dove, Soul into soul, song into song, Life changing into life, by laws that work not wrong; 25 O natural force in spirit and sense, that art One thing in all things, fruit of thine own fruit, O thought illimitable and infinite heart Whose blood is life in limbs indissolute That still keeps hurtless thine invisible part And inextirpable thy viewless root Whence all sweet shafts of green and each thy dart Of sharpening leaf and bud resundering shoot; Hills that the day-star hails, Heights that the first beam scales, And heights that souls outshining suns salute, Valleys for each mouth born Free now of plenteous corn, Waters and woodlands musical or mute; Free winds that brighten brows as free, And thunder and laughter and lightning of the sovereign sea; 26 Rivers and springs, and storms that seek your prey; With strong wings ravening through the skies by night; Spirits and stars that hold one choral way; O light of heaven, and thou the heavenlier light Aflame above the souls of men that sway All generations of all years with might; O sunrise of the repossessing day, And sunrise of all-renovating right; And thou, whose trackless foot Mocks hope's or fear's pursuit, Swift Revolution, changing depth with height; And thou, whose mouth makes one All songs that seek the sun, Serene Republic of a world made white; Thou, Freedom, whence the soul's springs ran; Praise earth for man's sake living, and for earth's sake man. 27 Make yourselves wings, O tarrying feet of fate, And hidden hour that hast our hope to bear, A child-god, through the morning-coloured gate That lets love in upon the golden air, Dead on whose threshold lies heart-broken hate, Dead discord, dead injustice, dead despair; O love long looked for, wherefore wilt thou wait, And shew not yet the dawn on thy bright hair, Not yet thine hand released Refreshing the faint east, Thine hand reconquering heaven, to seat man there? Come forth, be born and live, Thou that hast help to give And light to make man's day of manhood fair: With flight outflying the spherèd sun, Hasten thine hour and halt not, till thy work be done. A WATCH IN THE NIGHT 1 Watchman, what of the night?— Storm and thunder and rain, Lights that waver and wane, Leaving the watchfires unlit. Only the balefires are bright, And the flash of the lamps now and then From a palace where spoilers sit, Trampling the children of men. 2 Prophet, what of the night?— I stand by the verge of the sea, Banished, uncomforted, free, Hearing the noise of the waves And sudden flashes that smite Some man's tyrannous head, Thundering, heard among graves That hide the hosts of his dead. 3 Mourners, what of the night?— All night through without sleep We weep, and we weep, and we weep. Who shall give us our sons? Beaks of raven and kite, Mouths of wolf and of hound, Give us them back whom the guns Shot for you dead on the ground. 4 Dead men, what of the night?— Cannon and scaffold and sword, Horror of gibbet and cord, Mowed us as sheaves for the grave, Mowed us down for the right. We do not grudge or repent. Freely to freedom we gave Pledges, till life should be spent. 5 Statesman, what of the night?— The night will last me my time. The gold on a crown or a crime Looks well enough yet by the lamps. Have we not fingers to write, Lips to swear at a need? Then, when danger decamps, Bury the word with the deed. 6 Warrior, what of the night?— Whether it be not or be Night, is as one thing to me. I for one, at the least, Ask not of dews if they blight, Ask not of flames if they slay, Ask not of prince or of priest How long ere we put them away. 7 Master, what of the night?— Child, night is not at all Anywhere, fallen or to fall, Save in our star-stricken eyes. Forth of our eyes it takes flight, Look we but once nor before Nor behind us, but straight on the skies; Night is not then any more. 8 Exile, what of the night?— The tides and the hours run out, The seasons of death and of doubt, The night-watches bitter and sore. In the quicksands leftward and right My feet sink down under me; But I know the scents of the shore And the broad blown breaths of the sea. 9 Captives, what of the night?— It rains outside overhead Always, a rain that is red, And our faces are soiled with the rain. Here in the seasons' despite Day-time and night-time are one, Till the curse of the kings and the chain Break, and their toils be undone. 10 Christian, what of the night?— I cannot tell; I am blind. I halt and hearken behind If haply the hours will go back And return to the dear dead light, To the watchfires and stars that of old Shone where the sky now is black, Glowed where the earth now is cold. 11 High priest, what of the night?— The night is horrible here With haggard faces and fear, Blood, and the burning of fire. Mine eyes are emptied of sight, Mine hands are full of the dust. If the God of my faith be a liar, Who is it that I shall trust? 12 Princes, what of the night?— Night with pestilent breath Feeds us, children of death, Clothes us close with her gloom. Rapine and famine and fright Crouch at our feet and are fed. Earth where we pass is a tomb, Life where we triumph is dead. 13 Martyrs, what of the night?— Nay, is it night with you yet? We, for our part, we forget What night was, if it were. The loud red mouths of the fight Are silent and shut where we are. In our eyes the tempestuous air Shines as the face of a star. 14 England, what of the night?— Night is for slumber and sleep, Warm, no season to weep. Let me alone till the day. Sleep would I still if I might, Who have slept for two hundred years. Once I had honour, they say; But slumber is sweeter than tears. 15 France, what of the night?— Night is the prostitute's noon, Kissed and drugged till she swoon, Spat upon, trod upon, whored. With bloodred rose-garlands dight, Round me reels in the dance Death, my saviour, my lord, Crowned; there is no more France. 16 Italy, what of the night?— Ah, child, child, it is long! Moonbeam and starbeam and song Leave it dumb now and dark. Yet I perceive on the height Eastward, not now very far, A song too loud for the lark, A light too strong for a star. 17 Germany, what of the night?— Long has it lulled me with dreams; Now at midwatch, as it seems, Light is brought back to mine eyes, And the mastery of old and the might Lives in the joints of mine hands, Steadies my limbs as they rise, Strengthens my foot as it stands. 18 Europe, what of the night?— Ask of heaven, and the sea, And my babes on the bosom of me, Nations of mine, but ungrown. There is one who shall surely requite All that endure or that err: She can answer alone: Ask not of me, but of her. 19 Liberty, what of the night?— I feel not the red rains fall, Hear not the tempest at all, Nor thunder in heaven any more. All the distance is white With the soundless feet of the sun. Night, with the woes that it wore, Night is over and done. SUPER FLUMINA BABYLONIS By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, Remembering thee, That for ages of agony hast endured, and slept, And wouldst not see. By the waters of Babylon we stood up and sang, Considering thee, That a blast of deliverance in the darkness rang, To set thee free. And with trumpets and thunderings and with morning song Came up the light; And thy spirit uplifted thee to forget thy wrong As day doth night. And thy sons were dejected not any more, as then When thou wast shamed; When thy lovers went heavily without heart, as men Whose life was maimed. In the desolate distances, with a great desire, For thy love's sake, With our hearts going back to thee, they were filled with fire, Were nigh to break. It was said to us: “Verily ye are great of heart, But ye shall bend; Ye are bondmen and bondwomen, to be scourged and smart, To toil and tend.” And with harrows men harrowed us, and subdued with spears, And crushed with shame; And the summer and winter was, and the length of years, And no change came. By the rivers of Italy, by the sacred streams, By town, by tower, There was feasting with revelling, there was sleep with dreams, Until thine hour. And they slept and they rioted on their rose-hung beds, With mouths on flame, And with love-locks vine-chapleted, and with rose-crowned heads And robes of shame. And they knew not their forefathers, nor the hills and streams And words of power, Nor the gods that were good to them, but with songs and dreams Filled up their hour. By the rivers of Italy, by the dry streams' beds, When thy time came, There was casting of crowns from them, from their young men's heads, The crowns of shame. By the horn of Eridanus, by the Tiber mouth, As thy day rose, They arose up and girded them to the north and south, By seas, by snows. As a water in January the frost confines, Thy kings bound thee; As a water in April is, in the new-blown vines, Thy sons made free. And thy lovers that looked for thee, and that mourned from far, For thy sake dead, We rejoiced in the light of thee, in the signal star Above thine head. In thy grief had we followed thee, in thy passion loved, Loved in thy loss; In thy shame we stood fast to thee, with thy pangs were moved, Clung to thy cross. By the hillside of Calvary we beheld thy blood, Thy bloodred tears, As a mother's in bitterness, an unebbing flood, Years upon years. And the north was Gethsemane, without leaf or bloom, A garden sealed; And the south was Aceldama, for a sanguine fume Hid all the field. By the stone of the sepulchre we returned to weep, From far, from prison; And the guards by it keeping it we beheld asleep, But thou wast risen. And an angel's similitude by the unsealed grave, And by the stone: And the voice was angelical, to whose words God gave Strength like his own. “Lo, the graveclothes of Italy that are folded up In the grave's gloom! And the guards as men wrought upon with a charmèd cup, By the open tomb. “And her body most beautiful, and her shining head, These are not here; For your mother, for Italy, is not surely dead: Have ye no fear. “As of old time she spake to you, and you hardly heard, Hardly took heed, So now also she saith to you, yet another word, Who is risen indeed. “By my saying she saith to you, in your ears she saith, Who hear these things, Put no trust in men's royalties, nor in great men's breath, Nor words of kings. “For the life of them vanishes and is no more seen, Nor no more known; Nor shall any remember him if a crown hath been, Or where a throne. “Unto each man his handiwork, unto each his crown, The just Fate gives; Whoso takes the world's life on him and his own lays down, He, dying so, lives. “Whoso bears the whole heaviness of the wronged world's weight And puts it by, It is well with him suffering, though he face man's fate; How should he die? “Seeing death has no part in him any more, no power Upon his head; He has bought his eternity with a little hour, And is not dead. “For an hour, if ye look for him, he is no more found, For one hour's space; Then ye lift up your eyes to him and behold him crowned, A deathless face. “On the mountains of memory, by the world's well-springs, In all men's eyes, Where the light of the life of him is on all past things, Death only dies. “Not the light that was quenched for us, nor the deeds that were, Nor the ancient days, Nor the sorrows not sorrowful, nor the face most fair Of perfect praise.” So the angel of Italy's resurrection said, So yet he saith; So the son of her suffering, that from breasts nigh dead Drew life, not death. That the pavement of Golgotha should be white as snow, Not red, but white; That the waters of Babylon should no longer flow, And men see light. THE HALT BEFORE ROME September 1867 Is it so, that the sword is broken, Our sword, that was halfway drawn? Is it so, that the light was a spark, That the bird we hailed as the lark Sang in her sleep in the dark, And the song we took for a token Bore false witness of dawn? Spread in the sight of the lion, Surely, we said, is the net Spread but in vain, and the snare Vain; for the light is aware, And the common, the chainless air, Of his coming whom all we cry on; Surely in vain is it set. Surely the day is on our side, And heaven, and the sacred sun; Surely the stars, and the bright Immemorial inscrutable night: Yea, the darkness, because of our light, Is no darkness, but blooms as a bower-side When the winter is over and done; Blooms underfoot with young grasses Green, and with leaves overhead, Windflowers white, and the low New-dropped blossoms of snow; And or ever the May winds blow, And or ever the March wind passes, Flames with anemones red. We are here in the world's bower-garden, We that have watched out the snow. Surely the fruitfuller showers, The splendider sunbeams are ours; Shall winter return on the flowers, And the frost after April harden, And the fountains in May not flow? We have in our hands the shining And the fire in our hearts of a star. Who are we that our tongues should palter, Hearts bow down, hands falter, Who are clothed as with flame from the altar, That the kings of the earth, repining, Far off, watch from afar? Woe is ours if we doubt or dissemble, Woe, if our hearts not abide. Are our chiefs not among us, we said, Great chiefs, living and dead, To lead us glad to be led? For whose sake, if a man of us tremble, He shall not be on our side. What matter if these lands tarry, That tarried (we said) not of old? France, made drunken by fate, England, that bore up the weight Once of men's freedom, a freight Holy, but heavy to carry For hands overflowing with gold. Though this be lame, and the other Fleet, but blind from the sun, And the race be no more to these, Alas! nor the palm to seize, Who are weary and hungry of ease, Yet, O Freedom, we said, O our mother, Is there not left to thee one? Is there not left of thy daughters, Is there not one to thine hand? Fairer than these, and of fame Higher from of old by her name; Washed in her tears, and in flame Bathed as in baptism of waters, Unto all men a chosen land. Her hope in her heart was broken, Fire was upon her, and clomb, Hiding her, high as her head; And the world went past her, and said (We heard it say) she was dead; And now, behold, she hath spoken, She that was dead, saying, “Rome.” O mother of all men's nations, Thou knowest if the deaf world heard! Heard not now to her lowest Depths, where the strong blood slowest Beats at her bosom, thou knowest, In her toils, in her dim tribulations, Rejoiced not, hearing the word. The sorrowful, bound unto sorrow, The woe-worn people, and all That of old were discomforted, And men that famish for bread, And men that mourn for their dead, She bade them be glad on the morrow, Who endured in the day of her thrall. The blind, and the people in prison, Souls without hope, without home, How glad were they all that heard! When the winged white flame of the word Passed over men's dust, and stirred Death; for Italia was risen, And risen her light upon Rome. The light of her sword in the gateway Shone, an unquenchable flame, Bloodless, a sword to release, A light from the eyes of peace, To bid grief utterly cease, And the wrong of the old world straightway Pass from the face of her fame: Hers, whom we turn to and cry on, Italy, mother of men: From the light of the face of her glory, At the sound of the storm of her story, That the sanguine shadows and hoary Should flee from the foot of the lion, Lion-like, forth of his den. As the answering of thunder to thunder Is the storm-beaten sound of her past; As the calling of sea unto sea Is the noise of her years yet to be; For this ye knew not is she, Whose bonds are broken in sunder; This is she at the last. So spake we aloud, high-minded, Full of our will; and behold, The speech that was halfway spoken Breaks, as a pledge that is broken, As a king's pledge, leaving in token Grief only for high hopes blinded, New grief grafted on old. We halt by the walls of the city, Within sound of the clash of her chain. Hearing, we know that in there The lioness chafes in her lair, Shakes the storm of her hair, Struggles in hands without pity, Roars to the lion in vain. Whose hand is stretched forth upon her? Whose curb is white with her foam? Clothed with the cloud of his deeds, Swathed in the shroud of his creeds, Who is this that has trapped her and leads, Who turns to despair and dishonour Her name, her name that was Rome? Over fields without harvest or culture, Over hordes without honour or love, Over nations that groan with their kings, As an imminent pestilence flings Swift death from her shadowing wings, So he, who hath claws as a vulture, Plumage and beak as a dove. He saith, “I am pilot and haven, Light and redemption I am Unto souls overlaboured,” he saith; And to all men the blast of his breath Is a savour of death unto death; And the Dove of his worship a raven, And a wolf-cub the life-giving Lamb. He calls his sheep as a shepherd, Calls from the wilderness home, “Come unto me and be fed,” To feed them with ashes for bread And grass from the graves of the dead, Leaps on the fold as a leopard, Slays, and says, “I am Rome.” Rome, having rent her in sunder, With the clasp of an adder he clasps; Swift to shed blood are his feet, And his lips, that have man for their meat, Smoother than oil, and more sweet Than honey, but hidden thereunder Festers the poison of asps. As swords are his tender mercies, His kisses as mortal stings; Under his hallowing hands Life dies down in all lands; Kings pray to him, prone where he stands, And his blessings, as other men's curses, Disanoint where they consecrate kings. With an oil of unclean consecration, With effusion of blood and of tears, With uplifting of cross and of keys, Priest, though thou hallow us these, Yet even as they cling to thy knees Nation awakens by nation, King by king disappears. How shall the spirit be loyal To the shell of a spiritless thing? Erred once, in only a word, The sweet great song that we heard Poured upon Tuscany, erred, Calling a crowned man royal That was no more than a king. Sea-eagle of English feather, A song-bird beautiful-souled, She knew not them that she sang; The golden trumpet that rang From Florence, in vain for them, sprang As a note in the nightingales' weather Far over Fiesole rolled. She saw not—happy, not seeing— Saw not as we with her eyes Aspromonte; she felt Never the heart in her melt As in us when the news was dealt Melted all hope out of being, Dropped all dawn from the skies. In that weary funereal season, In that heart-stricken grief-ridden time, The weight of a king and the worth, With anger and sorrowful mirth, We weighed in the balance of earth, And light was his word as a treason, And heavy his crown as a crime. Banners of kings shall ye follow None, and have thrones on your side None; ye shall gather and grow Silently, row upon row, Chosen of Freedom to go Gladly where darkness may swallow, Gladly where death may divide. Have we not men with us royal, Men the masters of things? In the days when our life is made new, All souls perfect and true Shall adore whom their forefathers slew; And these indeed shall be loyal, And those indeed shall be kings. Yet for a space they abide with us, Yet for a little they stand, Bearing the heat of the day. When their presence is taken away, We shall wonder and worship, and say, “Was not a star on our side with us? Was not a God at our hand?” These, O men, shall ye honour, Liberty only, and these. For thy sake and for all men's and mine, Brother, the crowns of them shine Lighting the way to her shrine, That our eyes may be fastened upon her, That our hands may encompass her knees. In this day is the sign of her shown to you; Choose ye, to live or to die. Now is her harvest in hand; Now is her light in the land; Choose ye, to sink or to stand, For the might of her strength is made known to you Now, and her arm is on high. Serve not for any man's wages, Pleasure nor glory nor gold; Not by her side are they won Who saith unto each of you, “Son, Silver and gold have I none; I give but the love of all ages, And the life of my people of old.” Fear not for any man's terrors; Wait not for any man's word; Patiently, each in his place, Gird up your loins to the race; Following the print of her pace, Purged of desires and of errors, March to the tune ye have heard. March to the tune of the voice of her, Breathing the balm of her breath, Loving the light of her skies. Blessed is he on whose eyes Dawns but her light as he dies; Blessed are ye that make choice of her, Equal to life and to death. Ye that when faith is nigh frozen, Ye that when hope is nigh gone, Still, over wastes, over waves, Still, among wrecks, among graves, Follow the splendour that saves, Happy, her children, her chosen, Loyally led of her on. The sheep of the priests, and the cattle That feed in the penfolds of kings, Sleek is their flock and well-fed; Hardly she giveth you bread, Hardly a rest for the head, Till the day of the blast of the battle And the storm of the wind of her wings. Ye that have joy in your living, Ye that are careful to live, You her thunders go by: Live, let men be, let them lie, Serve your season, and die; Gifts have your masters for giving, Gifts hath not Freedom to give; She, without shelter or station, She, beyond limit or bar, Urges to slumberless speed Armies that famish, that bleed, Sowing their lives for her seed, That their dust may rebuild her a nation, That their souls may relight her a star. Happy are all they that follow her; Them shall no trouble cast down; Though she slay them, yet shall they trust in her, For unsure there is nought nor unjust in her, Blemish is none, neither rust in her; Though it threaten, the night shall not swallow her, Tempest and storm shall not drown. Hither, O strangers, that cry for her, Holding your lives in your hands, Hither, for here is your light, Where Italy is, and her might; Strength shall be given you to fight, Grace shall be given you to die for her, For the flower, for the lady of lands; Turn ye, whose anguish oppressing you Crushes, asleep and awake, For the wrong which is wrought as of yore; That Italia may give of her store, Having these things to give and no more; Only her hands on you, blessing you; Only a pang for her sake; Only her bosom to die on; Only her heart for a home, And a name with her children to be From Calabrian to Adrian sea Famous in cities made free That ring to the roar of the lion Proclaiming republican Rome. MENTANA: FIRST ANNIVERSARY At the time when the stars are grey, And the gold of the molten moon Fades, and the twilight is thinned, And the sun leaps up, and the wind, A light rose, not of the day, A stronger light than of noon. As the light of a face much loved Was the face of the light that clomb; As a mother's whitened with woes Her adorable head that arose; As the sound of a God that is moved, Her voice went forth upon Rome. At her lips it fluttered and failed Twice, and sobbed into song, And sank as a flame sinks under; Then spake, and the speech was thunder, And the cheek as he heard it paled Of the wrongdoer grown grey with the wrong. “Is it time, is it time appointed, Angel of time, is it near? For the spent night aches into day When the kings shall slay not or pray, And the high-priest, accursed and anointed, Sickens to deathward with fear. “For the bones of my slain are stirred, And the seed of my earth in her womb Moves as the heart of a bud Beating with odorous blood To the tune of the loud first bird Burns and yearns into bloom. “I lay my hand on her bosom, My hand on the heart of my earth, And I feel as with shiver and sob The triumphant heart in her throb, The dead petals dilate into blossom, The divine blood beat into birth. “O my earth, are the springs in thee dry? O sweet, is thy body a tomb? Nay, springs out of springs derive, And summers from summers alive, And the living from them that die; No tomb is here, but a womb. “O manifold womb and divine, Give me fruit of my children, give! I have given thee my dew for thy root, Give thou me for my mouth of thy fruit; Thine are the dead that are mine, And mine are thy sons that live. “O goodly children, O strong Italian spirits, that wear My glories as garments about you, Could time or the world misdoubt you, Behold, in disproof of the wrong, The field of the grave-pits there. “And ye that fell upon sleep, We have you too with us yet. Fairer than life or than youth Is this, to die for the truth: No death can sink you so deep As their graves whom their brethren forget. “Were not your pains as my pains? As my name are your names not divine? Was not the light in your eyes Mine, the light of my skies, And the sweet shed blood of your veins, O my beautiful martyrs, mine? “Of mine earth were your dear limbs made, Of mine air was your sweet life's breath; At the breasts of my love ye were fed, O my children, my chosen, my dead, At my breasts where again ye are laid, At the old mother's bosom, in death. “But ye that live, O their brothers, Be ye to me as they were; Give me, my children that live, What these dead grudged not to give, Who alive were sons of your mother's, Whose lips drew breath of your air. “Till darkness by dawn be cloven, Let youth's self mourn and abstain; And love's self find not an hour, And spring's self wear not a flower, And Lycoris, with hair unenwoven, Hail back to the banquet in vain. “So sooner and surer the glory That is not with us shall be, And stronger the hands that smite The heads of the sons of night, And the sound throughout earth of our story Give all men heart to be free.” BLESSED AMONG WOMEN To the Signora Cairoli 1 Blessed was she that bare, Hidden in flesh most fair, For all men's sake the likeness of all love; Holy that virgin's womb, The old record saith, on whom The glory of God alighted as a dove; Blessed, who brought to gracious birth The sweet-souled Saviour of a man-tormented earth. 2 But four times art thou blest, At whose most holy breast Four times a godlike soldier-saviour hung; And thence a fourfold Christ Given to be sacrificed To the same cross as the same bosom clung; Poured the same blood, to leave the same Light on the many-folded mountain-skirts of fame. 3 Shall they and thou not live, The children thou didst give Forth of thine hands, a godlike gift, to death, Through fire of death to pass For her high sake that was Thine and their mother, that gave all you breath? Shall ye not live till time drop dead, O mother, and each her children's consecrated head? 4 Many brought gifts to take For her love's supreme sake, Life and life's love, pleasure and praise and rest, And went forth bare; but thou, So much once richer, and now Poorer than all these, more than these be blest; Poorer so much, by so much given, Than who gives earth for heaven's sake, not for earth's sake heaven. 5 Somewhat could each soul save, What thing soever it gave, But thine, mother, what has thy soul kept back? None of thine all, not one, To serve thee and be thy son, Feed with love all thy days, lest one day lack; All thy whole life's love, thine heart's whole, Thou hast given as who gives gladly, O thou the supreme soul. 6 The heart's pure flesh and blood, The heaven thy motherhood, The live lips, the live eyes, that lived on thee; The hands that clove with sweet Blind clutch to thine, the feet That felt on earth their first way to thy knee; The little laughter of mouths milk-fed, Now open again to feed on dust among the dead; 7 The fair, strong, young men's strength, Light of life-days and length, And glory of earth seen under and stars above, And years that bring to tame Now the wild falcon fame, Now, to stroke smooth, the dove-white breast of love; The life unlived, the unsown seeds, Suns unbeholden, songs unsung, and undone deeds. 8 Therefore shall man's love be As an own son to thee, And the world's worship of thee for a child; All thine own land as one New-born, a nursing son, All thine own people a new birth undefiled; And all the unborn Italian time, And all its glory, and all its works, thy seed sublime. 9 That henceforth no man's breath, Saying, “Italy,” but saith In that most sovereign word thine equal name; Nor can one speak of thee But he saith “Italy,” Seeing in two suns one co-eternal flame; One heat, one heaven, one heart, one fire, One light, one love, one benediction, one desire. 10 Blest above praise and prayer And incense of men's air, Thy place is higher than where such voices rise As in men's temples make Music for some vain sake, This God's or that God's, in one weary wise; Thee the soul silent, the shut heart, The locked lips of the spirit praise thee that thou art. 11 Yea, for man's whole life's length, And with man's whole soul's strength, We praise thee, O holy, and bless thee, O mother of lights; And send forth as on wings The world's heart's thanksgivings, Song-birds to sing thy days through and thy nights; And wrap thee around and arch thee above With the air of benediction and the heaven of love. 12 And toward thee our unbreathed words Fly speechless, winged as birds, As the Indian flock, children of Paradise, The winged things without feet, Fed with God's dew for meat, That live in the air and light of the utter skies; So fleet, so flying a footless flight, With wings for feet love seeks thee, to partake thy sight. 13 Love like a clear sky spread Bends over thy loved head, As a new heaven bends over a new-born earth, When the old night's womb is great With young stars passionate And fair new planets fiery-fresh from birth; And moon-white here, there hot like Mars, Souls that are worlds shine on thee, spirits that are stars. 14 Till the whole sky burns through With heaven's own heart-deep hue, With passion-coloured glories of lit souls; And thine above all names Writ highest with lettering flames Lightens, and all the old starriest aureoles And all the old holiest memories wane, And the old names of love's chosen, found in thy sight vain. 15 And crowned heads are discrowned, And stars sink without sound, And love's self for thy love's sake waxes pale; Seeing from his storied skies In what new reverent wise Thee Rome's most highest, her sovereign daughters, hail; Thee Portia, thee Veturia grey, Thee Arria, thee Cornelia, Roman more than they. 16 Even all these as all we Subdue themselves to thee, Bow their heads haloed, quench their fiery fame; Seen through dim years divine, Their faint lights feminine Sink, then spring up rekindled from thy flame; Fade, then reflower and reillume From thy fresh spring their wintering age with new-blown bloom. 17 To thy much holier head Even theirs, the holy and dead, Bow themselves each one from her heavenward height; Each in her shining turn, All tremble toward thee and yearn To melt in thine their consummated light; Till from day's Capitolian dome One glory of many glories lighten upon Rome. 18 Hush thyself, song, and cease, Close, lips, and hold your peace; What help hast thou, what part have ye herein? But you, with sweet shut eyes, Heart-hidden memories, Dreams and dumb thoughts that keep what things have been Silent, and pure of all words said, Praise without song the living, without dirge the dead. 19 Thou, strengthless in these things, Song, fold thy feebler wings, And as a pilgrim go forth girt and shod, And where the new graves are, And where the sunset star, To the pure spirit of man that men call God, To the high soul of things, that is Made of men's heavenlier hopes and mightier memories; 20 To the elements that make For the soul's living sake This raiment of dead things, of shadow and trance, That give us chance and time Wherein to aspire and climb And set our life's work higher than time or chance; The old sacred elements, that give The breath of life to days that die, to deeds that live; 21 To them, veiled gods and great, There bow thee and dedicate The speechless spirit in these thy weak words hidden; And mix thy reverent breath With holier air of death, At the high feast of sorrow a guest unbidden, Till with divine triumphal tears Thou fill men's eyes who listen with a heart that hears. THE LITANY OF NATIONS ?? ??, ?? ??, ???? ??????? ????????. Æsch. Supp. 890. CHORUS If with voice of words or prayers thy sons may reach thee, We thy latter sons, the men thine after-birth, We the children of thy grey-grown age, O Earth, O our mother everlasting, we beseech thee, By the sealed and secret ages of thy life; By the darkness wherein grew thy sacred forces; By the songs of stars thy sisters in their courses; By thine own song hoarse and hollow and shrill with strife; By thy voice distuned and marred of modulation; By the discord of thy measure's march with theirs; By the beauties of thy bosom, and the cares; By thy glory of growth, and splendour of thy station; By the shame of men thy children, and the pride; By the pale-cheeked hope that sleeps and weeps and passes, As the grey dew from the morning mountain-grasses; By the white-lipped sightless memories that abide; By the silence and the sound of many sorrows; By the joys that leapt up living and fell dead; By the veil that hides thy hands and breasts and head, Wrought of divers-coloured days and nights and morrows; Isis, thou that knowest of God what worlds are worth, Thou the ghost of God, the mother uncreated, Soul for whom the floating forceless ages waited As our forceless fancies wait on thee, O Earth; Thou the body and soul, the father-God and mother, If at all it move thee, knowing of all things done Here where evil things and good things are not one, But their faces are as fire against each other; By thy morning and thine evening, night and day; By the first white light that stirs and strives and hovers As a bird above the brood her bosom covers, By the sweet last star that takes the westward way; By the night whose feet are shod with snow or thunder, Fledged with plumes of storm, or soundless as the dew; By the vesture bound of many-folded blue Round her breathless breasts, and all the woven wonder; By the golden-growing eastern stream of sea; By the sounds of sunrise moving in the mountains; By the forces of the floods and unsealed fountains; Thou that badest man be born, bid man be free. GREECE I am she that made thee lovely with my beauty From north to south: Mine, the fairest lips, took first the fire of duty From thine own mouth. Mine, the fairest eyes, sought first thy laws and knew them Truths undefiled; Mine, the fairest hands, took freedom first into them, A weanling child. By my light, now he lies sleeping, seen above him Where none sees other; By my dead that loved and living men that love him;(Cho.) Hear us, O mother. ITALY I am she that was the light of thee enkindled When Greece grew dim; She whose life grew up with man's free life, and dwindled With wane of him. She that once by sword and once by word imperial Struck bright thy gloom; And a third time, casting off these years funereal, Shall burst thy tomb. By that bond 'twixt thee and me whereat affrighted Thy tyrants fear us; By that hope and this remembrance reunited;(Cho.) O mother, hear us. SPAIN I am she that set my seal upon the nameless West worlds of seas; And my sons as brides took unto them the tameless Hesperides. Till my sins and sons through sinless lands dispersèd, With red flame shod, Made accurst the name of man, and thrice accursèd The name of God. Lest for those past fires the fires of my repentance Hell's fume yet smother, Now my blood would buy remission of my sentence;(Cho.) Hear us, O mother. FRANCE I am she that was thy sign and standard-bearer, Thy voice and cry; She that washed thee with her blood and left thee fairer, The same was I. Were not these the hands that raised thee fallen and fed thee, These hands defiled? Was not I thy tongue that spake, thine eye that led thee, Not I thy child? By the darkness on our dreams, and the dead errors Of dead times near us; By the hopes that hang around thee, and the terrors;(Cho.) O mother, hear us. RUSSIA I am she whose hands are strong and her eyes blinded And lips athirst Till upon the night of nations many-minded One bright day burst: Till the myriad stars be molten into one light, And that light thine; Till the soul of man be parcel of the sunlight, And thine of mine. By the snows that blanch not him nor cleanse from slaughter Who slays his brother; By the stains and by the chains on me thy daughter;(Cho.) Hear us, O mother. SWITZERLAND I am she that shews on mighty limbs and maiden Nor chain nor stain; For what blood can touch these hands with gold unladen, These feet what chain? By the surf of spears one shieldless bosom breasted And was my shield, Till the plume-plucked Austrian vulture-heads twincrested Twice drenched the field; By the snows and souls untrampled and untroubled That shine to cheer us, Light of those to these responsive and redoubled;(Cho.) O mother, hear us. GERMANY I am she beside whose forest-hidden fountains Slept freedom armed, By the magic born to music in my mountains Heart-chained and charmed. By those days the very dream whereof delivers My soul from wrong; By the sounds that make of all my ringing rivers None knows what song; By the many tribes and names of my division One from another; By the single eye of sun-compelling vision;(Cho.) Hear us, O mother. ENGLAND I am she that was and was not of thy chosen, Free, and not free; She that fed thy springs, till now her springs are frozen; Yet I am she. By the sea that clothed and sun that saw me splendid And fame that crowned, By the song-fires and the sword-fires mixed and blended That robed me round; By the star that Milton's soul for Shelley's lighted, Whose rays insphere us; By the beacon-bright Republic far-off sighted;(Cho.) O mother, hear us. CHORUS Turn away from us the cross-blown blasts of error, That drown each other; Turn away the fearful cry, the loud-tongued terror, O Earth, O mother. Turn away their eyes who track, their hearts who follow, The pathless past; Shew the soul of man, as summer shews the swallow, The way at last. By the sloth of men that all too long endure men On man to tread; By the cry of men, the bitter cry of poor men That faint for bread; By the blood-sweat of the people in the garden Inwalled of kings; By his passion interceding for their pardon Who do these things; By the sightless souls and fleshless limbs that labour For not their fruit; By the foodless mouth with foodless heart for neighbour, That, mad, is mute; By the child that famine eats as worms the blossom —Ah God, the child! By the milkless lips that strain the bloodless bosom Till woe runs wild; By the pastures that give grass to feed the lamb in, Where men lack meat; By the cities clad with gold and shame and famine; By field and street; By the people, by the poor man, by the master That men call slave; By the cross-winds of defeat and of disaster, By wreck, by wave; By the helm that keeps us still to sunwards driving, Still eastward bound, Till, as night-watch ends, day burn on eyes reviving, And land be found: We thy children, that arraign not nor impeach thee Though no star steer us, By the waves that wash the morning we beseech thee, O mother, hear us. HERTHA I am that which began; Out of me the years roll; Out of me God and man; I am equal and whole; God changes, and man, and the form of them bodily; I am the soul. Before ever land was, Before ever the sea, Or soft hair of the grass, Or fair limbs of the tree, Or the flesh-coloured fruit of my branches, I was, and thy soul was in me. First life on my sources First drifted and swam; Out of me are the forces That save it or damn; Out of me man and woman, and wild-beast and bird; before God was, I am. Beside or above me Nought is there to go; Love or unlove me, Unknow me or know, I am that which unloves me and loves; I am stricken, and I am the blow. I the mark that is missed And the arrows that miss, I the mouth that is kissed And the breath in the kiss, The search, and the sought, and the seeker, the soul and the body that is. I am that thing which blesses My spirit elate; That which caresses With hands uncreate My limbs unbegotten that measure the length of the measure of fate. But what thing dost thou now, Looking Godward, to cry “I am I, thou art thou, I am low, thou art high”? I am thou, whom thou seekest to find him; find thou but thyself, thou art I. I the grain and the furrow, The plough-cloven clod And the ploughshare drawn thorough, The germ and the sod, The deed and the doer, the seed and the sower, the dust which is God. Hast thou known how I fashioned thee, Child, underground? Fire that impassioned thee, Iron that bound, Dim changes of water, what thing of all these hast thou known of or found? Canst thou say in thine heart Thou hast seen with thine eyes With what cunning of art Thou wast wrought in what wise, By what force of what stuff thou wast shapen, and shown on my breast to the skies? Who hath given, who hath sold it thee, Knowledge of me? Hath the wilderness told it thee? Hast thou learnt of the sea? Hast thou communed in spirit with night? have the winds taken counsel with thee? Have I set such a star To show light on thy brow That thou sawest from afar What I show to thee now? Have ye spoken as brethren together, the sun and the mountains and thou? What is here, dost thou know it? What was, hast thou known? Prophet nor poet Nor tripod nor throne Nor spirit nor flesh can make answer, but only thy mother alone. Mother, not maker, Born, and not made; Though her children forsake her, Allured or afraid, Praying prayers to the God of their fashion, she stirs not for all that have prayed. A creed is a rod, And a crown is of night; But this thing is God, To be man with thy might, To grow straight in the strength of thy spirit, and live out thy life as the light. I am in thee to save thee, As my soul in thee saith; Give thou as I gave thee, Thy life-blood and breath, Green leaves of thy labour, white flowers of thy thought, and red fruit of thy death. Be the ways of thy giving As mine were to thee; The free life of thy living, Be the gift of it free; Not as servant to lord, nor as master to slave, shalt thou give thee to me. O children of banishment, Souls overcast, Were the lights ye see vanish meant Alway to last, Ye would know not the sun overshining the shadows and stars overpast. I that saw where ye trod The dim paths of the night Set the shadow called God In your skies to give light; But the morning of manhood is risen, and the shadow-less soul is in sight. The tree many-rooted That swells to the sky With frondage red-fruited, The life-tree am I; In the buds of your lives is the sap of my leaves: ye shall live and not die. But the Gods of your fashion That take and that give, In their pity and passion That scourge and forgive, They are worms that are bred in the bark that falls off; they shall die and not live. My own blood is what stanches The wounds in my bark; Stars caught in my branches Make day of the dark, And are worshipped as suns till the sunrise shall tread out their fires as a spark. Where dead ages hide under The live roots of the tree, In my darkness the thunder Makes utterance of me; In the clash of my boughs with each other ye hear the waves sound of the sea. That noise is of Time, As his feathers are spread And his feet set to climb Through the boughs overhead, And my foliage rings round him and rustles, and branches are bent with his tread. The storm-winds of ages Blow through me and cease, The war-wind that rages, The spring-wind of peace, Ere the breath of them roughen my tresses, ere one of my blossoms increase. All sounds of all changes, All shadows and lights On the world's mountain-ranges And stream-riven heights, Whose tongue is the wind's tongue and language of storm-clouds on earth-shaking nights; All forms of all faces, All works of all hands In unsearchable places Of time-stricken lands, All death and all life, and all reigns and all ruins, drop through me as sands. Though sore be my burden And more than ye know, And my growth have no guerdon But only to grow, Yet I fail not of growing for lightnings above me or deathworms below. These too have their part in me, As I too in these; Such fire is at heart in me, Such sap is this tree's, Which hath in it all sounds and all secrets of infinite lands and of seas. In the spring-coloured hours When my mind was as May's, There brake forth of me flowers By centuries of days, Strong blossoms with perfume of manhood, shot out from my spirit as rays. And the sound of them springing And smell of their shoots Were as warmth and sweet singing And strength to my roots; And the lives of my children made perfect with freedom of soul were my fruits. I bid you but be; I have need not of prayer; I have need of you free As your mouths of mine air; That my heart may be greater within me, beholding the fruits of me fair. More fair than strange fruit is Of faiths ye espouse; In me only the root is That blooms in your boughs; Behold now your God that ye made you, to feed him with faith of your vows. In the darkening and whitening Abysses adored, With dayspring and lightning For lamp and for sword, God thunders in heaven, and his angels are red with the wrath of the Lord. O my sons, O too dutiful Toward Gods not of me, Was not I enough beautiful? Was it hard to be free? For behold, I am with you, am in you and of you; look forth now and see. Lo, winged with world's wonders, With miracles shod, With the fires of his thunders For raiment and rod, God trembles in heaven, and his angels are white with the terror of God. For his twilight is come on him, His anguish is here; And his spirits gaze dumb on him, Grown grey from his fear; And his hour taketh hold on him stricken, the last of his infinite year. Thought made him and breaks him, Truth slays and forgives; But to you, as time takes him, This new thing it gives, Even love, the beloved Republic, that feeds upon freedom and lives. For truth only is living, Truth only is whole, And the love of his giving Man's polestar and pole; Man, pulse of my centre, and fruit of my body, and seed of my soul. One birth of my bosom; One beam of mine eye; One topmost blossom That scales the sky; Man, equal and one with me, man that is made of me, man that is I. BEFORE A CRUCIFIX Here, down between the dusty trees, At this lank edge of haggard wood, Women with labour-loosened knees, With gaunt backs bowed by servitude, Stop, shift their loads, and pray, and fare Forth with souls easier for the prayer. The suns have branded black, the rains Striped grey this piteous God of theirs; The face is full of prayers and pains, To which they bring their pains and prayers; Lean limbs that shew the labouring bones, And ghastly mouth that gapes and groans. God of this grievous people, wrought After the likeness of their race, By faces like thine own besought, Thine own blind helpless eyeless face, I too, that have nor tongue nor knee For prayer, I have a word to thee. It was for this then, that thy speech Was blown about the world in flame And men's souls shot up out of reach Of fear or lust or thwarting shame— That thy faith over souls should pass As sea-winds burning the grey grass? It was for this, that prayers like these Should spend themselves about thy feet, And with hard overlaboured knees Kneeling, these slaves of men should beat Bosoms too lean to suckle sons And fruitless as their orisons? It was for this, that men should make Thy name a fetter on men's necks, Poor men's made poorer for thy sake, And women's withered out of sex? It was for this, that slaves should be, Thy word was passed to set men free? The nineteenth wave of the ages rolls Now deathward since thy death and birth. Hast thou fed full men's starved-out souls? Hast thou brought freedom upon earth? Or are there less oppressions done In this wild world under the sun? Nay, if indeed thou be not dead, Before thy terrene shrine be shaken, Look down, turn usward, bow thine head; O thou that wast of God forsaken, Look on thine household here, and see These that have not forsaken thee. Thy faith is fire upon their lips, Thy kingdom golden in their hands; They scourge us with thy words for whips, They brand us with thy words for brands; The thirst that made thy dry throat shrink To their moist mouths commends the drink. The toothèd thorns that bit thy brows Lighten the weight of gold on theirs; Thy nakedness enrobes thy spouse With the soft sanguine stuff she wears Whose old limbs use for ointment yet Thine agony and bloody sweat. The blinding buffets on thine head On their crowned heads confirm the crown; Thy scourging dyes their raiment red, And with thy bands they fasten down For burial in the blood-bought field The nations by thy stripes unhealed. With iron for thy linen bands And unclean cloths for winding-sheet They bind the people's nail-pierced hands, They hide the people's nail-pierced feet; And what man or what angel known Shall roll back the sepulchral stone? But these have not the rich man's grave To sleep in when their pain is done. These were not fit for God to save. As naked hell-fire is the sun In their eyes living, and when dead These have not where to lay their head. They have no tomb to dig, and hide; Earth is not theirs, that they should sleep. On all these tombless crucified No lovers' eyes have time to weep. So still, for all man's tears and creeds, The sacred body hangs and bleeds. Through the left hand a nail is driven, Faith, and another through the right, Forged in the fires of hell and heaven, Fear that puts out the eye of light: And the feet soiled and scarred and pale Are pierced with falsehood for a nail. And priests against the mouth divine Push their sponge full of poison yet And bitter blood for myrrh and wine, And on the same reed is it set Wherewith before they buffeted The people's disanointed head. O sacred head, O desecrate, O labour-wounded feet and hands, O blood poured forth in pledge to fate Of nameless lives in divers lands, O slain and spent and sacrificed People, the grey-grown speechless Christ! Is there a gospel in the red Old witness of thy wide-mouthed wounds? From thy blind stricken tongueless head What desolate evangel sounds A hopeless note of hope deferred? What word, if there be any word? O son of man, beneath man's feet Cast down, O common face of man Whereon all blows and buffets meet, O royal, O republican Face of the people bruised and dumb And longing till thy kingdom come! The soldiers and the high priests part Thy vesture: all thy days are priced, And all the nights that eat thine heart. And that one seamless coat of Christ, The freedom of the natural soul, They cast their lots for to keep whole. No fragment of it save the name They leave thee for a crown of scorns Wherewith to mock thy naked shame And forehead bitten through with thorns And, marked with sanguine sweat and tears, The stripes of eighteen hundred years. And we seek yet if God or man Can loosen thee as Lazarus, Bid thee rise up republican And save thyself and all of us; But no disciple's tongue can say When thou shalt take our sins away. And mouldering now and hoar with moss Between us and the sunlight swings The phantom of a Christless cross Shadowing the sheltered heads of kings And making with its moving shade The souls of harmless men afraid. It creaks and rocks to left and right Consumed of rottenness and rust, Worm-eaten of the worms of night, Dead as their spirits who put trust, Round its base muttering as they sit, In the time-cankered name of it. Thou, in the day that breaks thy prison, People, though these men take thy name, And hail and hymn thee rearisen, Who made songs erewhile of thy shame, Give thou not ear; for these are they Whose good day was thine evil day. Set not thine hand unto their cross. Give not thy soul up sacrificed. Change not the gold of faith for dross Of Christian creeds that spit on Christ. Let not thy tree of freedom be Regrafted from that rotting tree. This dead God here against my face Hath help for no man; who hath seen The good works of it, or such grace As thy grace in it, Nazarene, As that from thy live lips which ran For man's sake, O thou son of man? The tree of faith ingraffed by priests Puts its foul foliage out above thee, And round it feed man-eating beasts Because of whom we dare not love thee; Though hearts reach back and memories ache, We cannot praise thee for their sake. O hidden face of man, whereover The years have woven a viewless veil, If thou wast verily man's lover, What did thy love or blood avail? Thy blood the priests make poison of, And in gold shekels coin thy love. So when our souls look back to thee They sicken, seeing against thy side, Too foul to speak of or to see, The leprous likeness of a bride, Whose kissing lips through his lips grown Leave their God rotten to the bone. When we would see thee man, and know What heart thou hadst toward men indeed, Lo, thy blood-blackened altars; lo, The lips of priests that pray and feed While their own hell's worm curls and licks The poison of the crucifix. Thou bad'st let children come to thee; What children now but curses come? What manhood in that God can be Who sees their worship, and is dumb? No soul that lived, loved, wrought, and died, Is this their carrion crucified. Nay, if their God and thou be one, If thou and this thing be the same, Thou shouldst not look upon the sun; The sun grows haggard at thy name. Come down, be done with, cease, give o'er; Hide thyself, strive not, be no more. TENEBRÆ At the chill high tide of the night, At the turn of the fluctuant hours, When the waters of time are at height, In a vision arose on my sight The kingdoms of earth and the powers. In a dream without lightening of eyes I saw them, children of earth, Nations and races arise, Each one after his wise, Signed with the sign of his birth. Sound was none of their feet, Light was none of their faces; In their lips breath was not, or heat, But a subtle murmur and sweet As of water in wan waste places. Pale as from passionate years, Years unassuaged of desire, Sang they soft in mine ears, Crowned with jewels of tears, Girt with girdles of fire. A slow song beaten and broken, As it were from the dust and the dead, As of spirits athirst unsloken, As of things unspeakable spoken, As of tears unendurable shed. In the manifold sound remote, In the molten murmur of song, There was but a sharp sole note Alive on the night and afloat, The cry of the world's heart's wrong. As the sea in the strait sea-caves, The sound came straitened and strange; A noise of the rending of graves, A tidal thunder of waves, The music of death and of change. “We have waited so long,” they say, “For a sound of the God, for a breath, For a ripple of the refluence of day, For the fresh bright wind of the fray, For the light of the sunrise of death. “We have prayed not, we, to be strong, To fulfil the desire of our eyes; —Howbeit they have watched for it long, Watched, and the night did them wrong, Yet they say not of day, shall it rise? “They are fearful and feeble with years, Yet they doubt not of day if it be; Yea, blinded and beaten with tears, Yea, sick with foresight of fears, Yet a little, and hardly, they see. “We pray not, we, for the palm, For the fruit ingraffed of the fight, For the blossom of peace and the balm, And the tender triumph and calm Of crownless and weaponless right. “We pray not, we, to behold The latter august new birth, The young day's purple and gold, And divine, and rerisen as of old, The sun-god Freedom on earth. “Peace, and world's honour, and fame, We have sought after none of these things; The light of a life like flame Passing, the storm of a name Shaking the strongholds of kings: “Nor, fashioned of fire and of air, The splendour that burns on his head Who was chiefest in ages that were, Whose breath blew palaces bare, Whose eye shone tyrannies dead: “All these things in your day Ye shall see, O our sons, and shall hold Surely; but we, in the grey Twilight, for one thing we pray, In that day though our memories be cold: “To feel on our brows as we wait An air of the morning, a breath From the springs of the east, from the gate Whence freedom issues, and fate, Sorrow, and triumph, and death: “From a land whereon time hath not trod, Where the spirit is bondless and bare, And the world's rein breaks, and the rod, And the soul of a man, which is God, He adores without altar or prayer: “For alone of herself and her right She takes, and alone gives grace: And the colours of things lose light, And the forms, in the limitless white Splendour of space without space: “And the blossom of man from his tomb Yearns open, the flower that survives; And the shadows of changes consume In the colourless passionate bloom Of the live light made of our lives: “Seeing each life given is a leaf Of the manifold multiform flower, And the least among these, and the chief, As an ear in the red-ripe sheaf Stored for the harvesting hour. “O spirit of man, most holy, The measure of things and the root, In our summers and winters a lowly Seed, putting forth of them slowly Thy supreme blossom and fruit; “In thy sacred and perfect year, The souls that were parcel of thee In the labour and life of us here Shall be rays of thy sovereign sphere, Springs of thy motion shall be. “There is the fire that was man, The light that was love, and the breath That was hope ere deliverance began, And the wind that was life for a span, And the birth of new things, which is death. “There, whosoever had light, And, having, for men's sake gave; All that warred against night; All that were found in the fight Swift to be slain and to save; “Undisbranched of the storms that disroot us, Of the lures that enthrall unenticed; The names that exalt and transmute us; The blood-bright splendour of Brutus, The snow-bright splendour of Christ. “There all chains are undone; Day there seems but as night; Spirit and sense are as one In the light not of star nor of sun; Liberty there is the light. “She, sole mother and maker, Stronger than sorrow, than strife; Deathless, though death overtake her; Faithful, though faith should forsake her; Spirit, and saviour, and life.” HYMN OF MAN (During the Session in Rome of the Œcumenical Council) In the grey beginning of years, in the twilight of things that began, The word of the earth in the ears of the world, was it God? was it man? The word of the earth to the spheres her sisters, the note of her song, The sound of her speech in the ears of the starry and sisterly throng, Was it praise or passion or prayer, was it love or devotion or dread, When the veils of the shining air first wrapt her jubilant head? When her eyes new-born of the night saw yet no star out of reach; When her maiden mouth was alight with the flame of musical speech; When her virgin feet were set on the terrible heavenly way, And her virginal lids were wet with the dew of the birth of the day: Eyes that had looked not on time, and ears that had heard not of death; Lips that had learnt not the rhyme of change and passionate breath, The rhythmic anguish of growth, and the motion of mutable things, Of love that longs and is loth, and plume-plucked hope without wings, Passions and pains without number, and life that runs and is lame, From slumber again to slumber, the same race set for the same, Where the runners outwear each other, but running with lampless hands No man takes light from his brother till blind at the goal he stands: Ah, did they know, did they dream of it, counting the cost and the worth? The ways of her days, did they seem then good to the new-souled earth? Did her heart rejoice, and the might of her spirit exult in her then, Child yet no child of the night, and motherless mother of men? Was it Love brake forth flower-fashion, a bird with gold on his wings, Ar. Av. 696. Lovely, her firstborn passion, and impulse of firstborn things? Was Love that nestling indeed that under the plumes of the night Was hatched and hidden as seed in the furrow, and brought forth bright? Was it Love lay shut in the shell world-shaped, having over him there Black world-wide wings that impel the might of the night through air? And bursting his shell as a bird, night shook through her sail-stretched vans, And her heart as a water was stirred, and its heat was the firstborn man's. For the waste of the dead void air took form of a world at birth, And the waters and firmaments were, and light, and the life-giving earth. The beautiful bird unbegotten that night brought forth without pain In the fathomless years forgotten whereover the dead gods reign, Was it love, life, godhead, or fate? we say the spirit is one That moved on the dark to create out of darkness the stars and the sun. Before the growth was the grower, and the seed ere the plant was sown; But what was seed of the sower? and the grain of him, whence was it grown? Foot after foot ye go back and travail and make yourselves mad; Blind feet that feel for the track where highway is none to be had. Therefore the God that ye make you is grievous, and gives not aid, Because it is but for your sake that the God of your making is made. Thou and I and he are not gods made men for a span, But God, if a God there be, is the substance of men which is man. Our lives are as pulses or pores of his manifold body and breath; As waves of his sea on the shores where birth is the beacon of death. We men, the multiform features of man, whatsoever we be, Recreate him of whom we are creatures, and all we only are he. Not each man of all men is God, but God is the fruit of the whole; Indivisible spirit and blood, indiscernible body from soul. Not men's but man's is the glory of godhead, the kingdom of time, The mountainous ages made hoary with snows for the spirit to climb. A God with the world inwound whose clay to his footsole clings; A manifold God fast-bound as with iron of adverse things. A soul that labours and lives, an emotion, a strenuous breath, From the flame that its own mouth gives reillumed, and refreshed with death. In the sea whereof centuries are waves the live God plunges and swims; His bed is in all men's graves, but the worm hath not hold on his limbs. Night puts out not his eyes, nor time sheds change on his head; With such fire as the stars of the skies are the roots of his heart are fed. Men are the thoughts passing through it, the veins that fulfil it with blood, With spirit of sense to renew it as springs fulfilling a flood. Men are the heartbeats of man, the plumes that feather his wings, Storm-worn, since being began, with the wind and thunder of things. Things are cruel and blind; their strength detains and deforms: And the wearying wings of the mind still beat up the stream of their storms. Still, as one swimming up stream, they strike out blind in the blast, In thunders of vision and dream, and lightnings of future and past. We are baffled and caught in the current and bruised upon edges of shoals; As weeds or as reeds in the torrent of things are the wind-shaken souls. Spirit by spirit goes under, a foam-bell's bubble of breath, That blows and opens in sunder and blurs not the mirror of death. For a worm or a thorn in his path is a man's soul quenched as a flame; For his lust of an hour or his wrath shall the worm and the man be the same. O God sore stricken of things! they have wrought him a raiment of pain; Can a God shut eyelids and wings at a touch on the nerves of the brain? O shamed and sorrowful God, whose force goes out at a blow! What world shall shake at his nod? at his coming what wilderness glow? What help in the work of his hands? what light in the track of his feet? His days are snowflakes or sands, with cold to consume him and heat. He is servant with Change for lord, and for wages he hath to his hire Folly and force, and a sword that devours, and a ravening fire. From the bed of his birth to his grave he is driven as a wind at their will; Lest Change bow down as his slave, and the storm and the sword be still; Lest earth spread open her wings to the sunward, and sing with the spheres; Lest man be master of things, to prevail on their forces and fears. By the spirit are things overcome; they are stark, and the spirit hath breath; It hath speech, and their forces are dumb; it is living, and things are of death. But they know not the spirit for master, they feel not force from above, While man makes love to disaster, and woos desolation with love. Yea, himself too hath made himself chains, and his own hands plucked out his eyes; For his own soul only constrains him, his own mouth only denies. The herds of kings and their hosts and the flocks of the high priests bow To a master whose face is a ghost's; O thou that wast God, is it thou? Thou madest man in the garden; thou temptedst man, and he fell; Thou gavest him poison and pardon for blood and burnt-offering to sell. Thou hast sealed thine elect to salvation, fast locked with faith for the key; Make now for thyself expiation, and be thine atonement for thee. Ah, thou that darkenest heaven—ah, thou that bringest a sword— By the crimes of thine hands unforgiven they beseech thee to hear them, O Lord. By the balefires of ages that burn for thine incense, by creed and by rood, By the famine and passion that yearn and that hunger to find of thee food, By the children that asked at thy throne of the priests that were fat with thine hire For bread, and thou gavest a stone; for light, and thou madest them fire; By the kiss of thy peace like a snake's kiss, that leaves the soul rotten at root; By the savours of gibbets and stakes thou hast planted to bear to thee fruit; By torture and terror and treason, that make to thee weapons and wings; By thy power upon men for a season, made out of the malice of things; O thou that hast built thee a shrine of the madness of man and his shame, And hast hung in the midst for a sign of his worship the lamp of thy name; That hast shown him for heaven in a vision a void world's shadow and shell, And hast fed thy delight and derision with fire of belief as of hell; That hast fleshed on the souls that believe thee the fang of the death-worm fear, With anguish of dreams to deceive them whose faith cries out in thine ear; By the face of the spirit confounded before thee and humbled in dust, By the dread wherewith life was astounded and shamed out of sense of its trust, By the scourges of doubt and repentance that fell on the soul at thy nod, Thou art judged, O judge, and the sentence is gone forth against thee, O God. Thy slave that slept is awake; thy slave but slept for a span; Yea, man thy slave shall unmake thee, who made thee lord over man. For his face is set to the east, his feet on the past and its dead; The sun rearisen is his priest, and the heat thereof hallows his head. His eyes take part in the morning; his spirit outsounding the sea Asks no more witness or warning from temple or tripod or tree. He hath set the centuries at union; the night is afraid at his name; Equal with life, in communion with death, he hath found them the same. Past the wall unsurmounted that bars out our vision with iron and fire He hath sent forth his soul for the stars to comply with and suns to conspire. His thought takes flight for the centre wherethrough it hath part in the whole; The abysses forbid it not enter: the stars make room for the soul. Space is the soul's to inherit; the night is hers as the day; Lo, saith man, this is my spirit; how shall not the worlds make way? Space is thought's, and the wonders thereof, and the secret of space; Is thought not more than the thunders and lightnings? shall thought give place? Is the body not more than the vesture, the life not more than the meat? The will than the word or the gesture, the heart than the hands or the feet? Is the tongue not more than the speech is? the head not more than the crown? And if higher than is heaven be the reach of the soul, shall not heaven bow down? Time, father of life, and more great than the life it begat and began, Earth's keeper and heaven's and their fate, lives, thinks, and hath substance in man. Time's motion that throbs in his blood is the thought that gives heart to the skies, And the springs of the fire that is food to the sunbeams are light to his eyes. The minutes that beat with his heart are the words to which worlds keep chime, And the thought in his pulses is part of the blood and the spirit of time. He saith to the ages, Give; and his soul foregoes not her share; Who are ye that forbid him to live, and would feed him with heavenlier air? Will ye feed him with poisonous dust, and restore him with hemlock for drink, Till he yield you his soul up in trust, and have heart not to know or to think? He hath stirred him, and found out the flaw in his fetters, and cast them behind; His soul to his soul is a law, and his mind is a light to his mind. The seal of his knowledge is sure, the truth and his spirit are wed; Men perish, but man shall endure; lives die, but the life is not dead. He hath sight of the secrets of season, the roots of the years and the fruits; His soul is at one with the reason of things that is sap to the roots. He can hear in their changes a sound as the conscience of consonant spheres; He can see through the years flowing round him the law lying under the years. Who are ye that would bind him with curses and blind him with vapour of prayer? Your might is as night that disperses when light is alive in the air. The bow of your godhead is broken, the arm of your conquest is stayed; Though ye call down God to bear token, for fear of you none is afraid. Will ye turn back times, and the courses of stars, and the season of souls? Shall God's breath dry up the sources that feed time full as it rolls? Nay, cry on him then till he show you a sign, till he lift up a rod; Hath he made not the nations to know him of old if indeed he be God? Is no heat of him left in the ashes of thousands burnt up for his sake? Can prayer not rekindle the flashes that shone in his face from the stake? Cry aloud; for your God is a God and a Saviour; cry, make yourselves lean; Is he drunk or asleep, that the rod of his wrath is unfelt and unseen? Is the fire of his old loving-kindness gone out, that his pyres are acold? Hath he gazed on himself unto blindness, who made men blind to behold? Cry out, for his kingdom is shaken; cry out, for the people blaspheme; Cry aloud till his godhead awaken; what doth he to sleep and to dream? Cry, cut yourselves, gash you with knives and with scourges, heap on to you dust; Is his life but as other gods' lives? is not this the Lord God of your trust? Is not this the great God of your sires, that with souls and with bodies was fed, And the world was on flame with his fires? O fools, he was God, and is dead. He will hear not again the strong crying of earth in his ears as before, And the fume of his multitudes dying shall flatter his nostrils no more. By the spirit he ruled as his slave is he slain who was mighty to slay, And the stone that is sealed on his grave he shall rise not and roll not away. Yea, weep to him, lift up your hands; be your eyes as a fountain of tears; Where he stood there is nothing that stands; if he call, there is no man that hears. He hath doffed his king's raiment of lies now the wane of his kingdom is come; Ears hath he, and hears not; and eyes, and he sees not; and mouth, and is dumb. His red king's raiment is ripped from him naked, his staff broken down; And the signs of his empire are stripped from him shuddering; and where is his crown? And in vain by the wellsprings refrozen ye cry for the warmth of his sun— O God, the Lord God of thy chosen, thy will in thy kingdom be done. Kingdom and will hath he none in him left him, nor warmth in his breath; Till his corpse be cast out of the sun will ye know not the truth of his death? Surely, ye say, he is strong, though the times be against him and men; Yet a little, ye say, and how long, till he come to show judgment again? Shall God then die as the beasts die? who is it hath broken his rod? O God, Lord God of thy priests, rise up now and show thyself God. They cry out, thine elect, thine aspirants to heavenward, whose faith is as flame; O thou the Lord God of our tyrants, they call thee, their God, by thy name. By thy name that in hell-fire was written, and burned at the point of thy sword, Thou art smitten, thou God, thou art smitten; thy death is upon thee, O Lord. And the love-song of earth as thou diest resounds through the wind of her wings— Glory to Man in the highest! for Man is the master of things. THE PILGRIMS Who is your lady of love, O ye that pass Singing? and is it for sorrow of that which was That ye sing sadly, or dream of what shall be? For gladly at once and sadly it seems ye sing. —Our lady of love by you is unbeholden; For hands she hath none, nor eyes, nor lips, nor golden Treasure of hair, nor face nor form; but we That love, we know her more fair than anything. —Is she a queen, having great gifts to give? —Yea, these; that whoso hath seen her shall not live Except he serve her sorrowing, with strange pain, Travail and bloodshedding and bitterer tears; And when she bids die he shall surely die. And he shall leave all things under the sky And go forth naked under sun and rain And work and wait and watch out all his years. —Hath she on earth no place of habitation? —Age to age calling, nation answering nation, Cries out, Where is she? and there is none to say; For if she be not in the spirit of men, For if in the inward soul she hath no place, In vain they cry unto her, seeking her face, In vain their mouths make much of her; for they Cry with vain tongues, till the heart lives again. —O ye that follow, and have ye no repentance? For on your brows is written a mortal sentence, An hieroglyph of sorrow, a fiery sign, That in your lives ye shall not pause or rest, Nor have the sure sweet common love, nor keep Friends and safe days, nor joy of life nor sleep. —These have we not, who have one thing, the divine Face and clear eyes of faith and fruitful breast. —And ye shall die before your thrones be won. —Yea, and the changed world and the liberal sun Shall move and shine without us, and we lie Dead; but if she too move on earth and live, But if the old world with all the old irons rent Laugh and give thanks, shall we be not content? Nay, we shall rather live, we shall not die, Life being so little and death so good to give. —And these men shall forget you.—Yea, but we Shall be a part of the earth and the ancient sea, And heaven-high air august, and awful fire, And all things good; and no man's heart shall beat But somewhat in it of our blood once shed Shall quiver and quicken, as now in us the dead Blood of men slain and the old same life's desire Plants in their fiery footprints our fresh feet. —But ye that might be clothed with all things pleasant, Ye are foolish that put off the fair soft present, That clothe yourselves with the cold future air; When mother and father and tender sister and brother And the old live love that was shall be as ye, Dust, and no fruit of loving life shall be. —She shall be yet who is more than all these were, Than sister or wife or father unto us or mother. —Is this worth life, is this, to win for wages? Lo, the dead mouths of the awful grey-grown ages, The venerable, in the past that is their prison, In the outer darkness, in the unopening grave, Laugh, knowing how many as ye now say have said, How many, and all are fallen, are fallen and dead: Shall ye dead rise, and these dead have not risen? —Not we but she, who is tender and swift to save —Are ye not weary and faint not by the way, Seeing night by night devoured of day by day, Seeing hour by hour consumed in sleepless fire? Sleepless: and ye too, when shall ye too sleep? —We are weary in heart and head, in hands and feet, And surely more than all things sleep were sweet, Than all things save the inexorable desire Which whoso knoweth shall neither faint nor weep. —Is this so sweet that one were fain to follow? Is this so sure where all men's hopes are hollow. Even this your dream, that by much tribulation Ye shall make whole flawed hearts, and bowed necks straight? —Nay, though our life were blind, our death were fruitless, Not therefore were the whole world's high hope rootless; But man to man, nation would turn to nation, And the old life live, and the old great word be great. —Pass on then and pass by us and let us be, For what light think ye after life to see? And if the world fare better will ye know? And if man triumph who shall seek you and say? —Enough of light is this for one life's span, That all men born are mortal, but not man: And we men bring death lives by night to sow, That man may reap and eat and live by day. ARMAND BARBÈS I Fire out of heaven, a flower of perfect fire, That where the roots of life are had its root And where the fruits of time are brought forth fruit; A faith made flesh, a visible desire, That heard the yet unbreathing years respire And speech break forth of centuries that sit mute Beyond all feebler footprint of pursuit; That touched the highest of hope, and went up higher; A heart love-wounded whereto love was law, A soul reproachless without fear or flaw, A shining spirit without shadow of shame, A memory made of all men's love and awe; Being disembodied, so thou be the same, What need, O soul, to sign thee with thy name? II All woes of all men sat upon thy soul And all their wrongs were heavy on thy head; With all their wounds thy heart was pierced and bled, And in thy spirit as in a mourning scroll The world's huge sorrows were inscribed by roll, All theirs on earth who serve and faint for bread, All banished men's, all theirs in prison dead, Thy love had heart and sword-hand for the whole. “This was my day of glory,” didst thou say, When, by the scaffold thou hadst hope to climb For thy faith's sake, they brought thee respite; “Nay, I shall not die then, I have missed my day.” O hero, O our help, O head sublime, Thy day shall be commensurate with time. QUIA MULTUM AMAVIT Am I not he that hath made thee and begotten thee, I, God, the spirit of man? Wherefore now these eighteen years hast thou forgotten me, From whom thy life began? Thy life-blood and thy life-breath and thy beauty, Thy might of hands and feet, Thy soul made strong for divinity of duty And service which was sweet. Through the red sea brimmed with blood didst thou not follow me, As one that walks in trance? Was the storm strong to break or the sea to swallow thee, When thou wast free and France? I am Freedom, God and man, O France, that plead with thee; How long now shall I plead? Was I not with thee in travail, and in need with thee, Thy sore travail and need? Thou wast fairest and first of my virgin-vested daughters, Fairest and foremost thou; And thy breast was white, though thy hands were red with slaughters, Thy breast, a harlot's now. O foolish virgin and fair among the fallen, A ruin where satyrs dance, A garden wasted for beasts to crawl and brawl in, What hast thou done with France? Where is she who bared her bosom but to thunder, Her brow to storm and flame, And before her face was the red sea cloven in sunder And all its waves made tame? And the surf wherein the broad-based rocks were shaking She saw far off divide, At the blast of the breath of the battle blown and breaking, And weight of wind and tide; And the ravin and the ruin of thronèd nations And every royal race, And the kingdoms and kings from the state of their high stations That fell before her face. Yea, great was the fall of them, all that rose against her, From the earth's old-historied heights; For my hands were fire, and my wings as walls that fenced her, Mine eyes as pilot-lights. Not as guerdons given of kings the gifts I brought her, Not strengths that pass away; But my heart, my breath of life, O France, O daughter, I gave thee in that day. Yea, the heart's blood of a very God I gave thee, Breathed in thy mouth his breath; Was my word as a man's, having no more strength to save thee From this worse thing than death? Didst thou dream of it only, the day that I stood nigh thee, Was all its light a dream? When that iron surf roared backwards and went by thee Unscathed of storm or stream: When thy sons rose up and thy young men stood together, One equal face of fight, And my flag swam high as the swimming sea-foam's feather, Laughing, a lamp of light? Ah the lordly laughter and light of it, that lightened Heaven-high, the heaven's whole length! Ah the hearts of heroes pierced, the bright lips whitened Of strong men in their strength! Ah the banner-poles, the stretch of straightening streamers Straining their full reach out! Ah the men's hands making true the dreams of dreamers, The hopes brought forth in doubt! Ah the noise of horse, the charge and thunder of drumming, And swaying and sweep of swords! Ah the light that led them through of the world's life coming, Clear of its lies and lords! By the lightning of the lips of guns whose flashes Made plain the strayed world's way; By the flame that left her dead old sins in ashes, Swept out of sight of day; By thy children whose bare feet were shod with thunder, Their bare hands mailed with fire; By the faith that went with them, waking fear and wonder, Heart's love and high desire; By the tumult of the waves of nations waking Blind in the loud wide night; By the wind that went on the world's waste waters, making Their marble darkness white, As the flash of the flakes of the foam flared lamplike, leaping From wave to gladdening wave, Making wide the fast-shut eyes of thraldom sleeping The sleep of the unclean grave; By the fire of equality, terrible, devouring, Divine, that brought forth good; By the lands it purged and wasted and left flowering With bloom of brotherhood; By the lips of fraternity that for love's sake uttered Fierce words and fires of death, But the eyes were deep as love's, and the fierce lips fluttered With love's own living breath; By thy weaponed hands, brows helmed, and bare feet spurning The bared head of a king; By the storm of sunrise round thee risen and burning, Why hast thou done this thing? Thou hast mixed thy limbs with the son of a harlot, a stranger, Mouth to mouth, limb to limb, Thou, bride of a God, because of the bridesman Danger, To bring forth seed to him. For thou thoughtest inly, the terrible bridegroom wakes me, When I would sleep, to go; The fire of his mouth consumes, and the red kiss shakes me, More bitter than a blow. Rise up, my beloved, go forth to meet the stranger, Put forth thine arm, he saith; Fear thou not at all though the bridesman should be Danger, The bridesmaid should be Death. I the bridegroom, am I not with thee, O bridal nation, O wedded France, to strive? To destroy the sins of the earth with divine devastation, Till none be left alive? Lo her growths of sons, foliage of men and frondage, Broad boughs of the old-world tree, With iron of shame and with pruning-hooks of bondage They are shorn from sea to sea. Lo, I set wings to thy feet that have been wingless, Till the utter race be run; Till the priestless temples cry to the thrones made kingless, Are we not also undone? Till the immeasurable Republic arise and lighten Above these quick and dead, And her awful robes be changed, and her red robes whiten, Her warring-robes of red. But thou wouldst not, saying, I am weary and faint to follow, Let me lie down and rest; And hast sought out shame to sleep with, mire to wallow, Yea, a much fouler breast: And thine own hast made prostitute, sold and shamed and bared it, Thy bosom which was mine, And the bread of the word I gave thee hast soiled, and shared it Among these snakes and swine. As a harlot thou wast handled and polluted, Thy faith held light as foam, That thou sentest men thy sons, thy sons imbruted, To slay thine elder Rome. Therefore, O harlot, I gave thee to the accurst one, By night to be defiled, To thy second shame, and a fouler than the first one, That got thee first with child. Yet I know thee turning back now to behold me, To bow thee and make thee bare, Not for sin's sake but penitence, by my feet to hold me, And wipe them with thine hair. And sweet ointment of thy grief thou hast brought thy master, And set before thy lord, From a box of flawed and broken alabaster, Thy broken spirit, poured. And love-offerings, tears and perfumes, hast thou given me, To reach my feet and touch; Therefore thy sins, which are many, are forgiven thee, Because thou hast loved much. 18 brumaire, an 78. GENESIS In the outer world that was before this earth, That was before all shape or space was born, Before the blind first hour of time had birth, Before night knew the moonlight or the morn; Yea, before any world had any light, Or anything called God or man drew breath, Slowly the strong sides of the heaving night Moved, and brought forth the strength of life and death. And the sad shapeless horror increate That was all things and one thing, without fruit, Limit, or law; where love was none, nor hate, Where no leaf came to blossom from no root; The very darkness that time knew not of, Nor God laid hand on, nor was man found there, Ceased, and was cloven in several shapes; above Light, and night under, and fire, earth, water, and air. Sunbeams and starbeams, and all coloured things, All forms and all similitudes began; And death, the shadow cast by life's wide wings, And God, the shade cast by the soul of man. Then between shadow and substance, night and light, Then between birth and death, and deeds and days, The illimitable embrace and the amorous fight That of itself begets, bears, rears, and slays, The immortal war of mortal things, that is Labour and life and growth and good and ill, The mild antiphonies that melt and kiss, The violent symphonies that meet and kill, All nature of all things began to be. But chiefliest in the spirit (beast or man, Planet of heaven or blossom of earth or sea) The divine contraries of life began. For the great labour of growth, being many, is one; One thing the white death and the ruddy birth; The invisible air and the all-beholden sun, And barren water and many-childed earth. And these things are made manifest in men From the beginning forth unto this day: Time writes and life records them, and again Death seals them lest the record pass away. For if death were not, then should growth not be, Change, nor the life of good nor evil things; Nor were there night at all nor light to see, Nor water of sweet nor water of bitter springs. For in each man and each year that is born Are sown the twin seeds of the strong twin powers; The white seed of the fruitful helpful morn, The black seed of the barren hurtful hours. And he that of the black seed eateth fruit, To him the savour as honey shall be sweet; And he in whom the white seed hath struck root, He shall have sorrow and trouble and tears for meat. And him whose lips the sweet fruit hath made red In the end men loathe and make his name a rod; And him whose mouth on the unsweet fruit hath fed In the end men follow and know for very God. And of these twain, the black seed and the white, All things come forth, endured of men and done; And still the day is great with child of night, And still the black night labours with the sun. And each man and each year that lives on earth Turns hither or thither, and hence or thence is fed; And as a man before was from his birth, So shall a man be after among the dead. TO WALT WHITMAN IN AMERICA Send but a song oversea for us, Heart of their hearts who are free, Heart of their singer, to be for us More than our singing can be; Ours, in the tempest at error, With no light but the twilight of terror; Send us a song oversea! Sweet-smelling of pine-leaves and grasses, And blown as a tree through and through With the winds of the keen mountain-passes, And tender as sun-smitten dew; Sharp-tongued as the winter that shakes The wastes of your limitless lakes, Wide-eyed as the sea-line's blue. O strong-winged soul with prophetic Lips hot with the bloodbeats of song, With tremor of heartstrings magnetic, With thoughts as thunders in throng, With consonant ardours of chords That pierce men's souls as with swords And hale them hearing along, Make us too music, to be with us As a word from a world's heart warm, To sail the dark as a sea with us, Full-sailed, outsinging the storm, A song to put fire in our ears Whose burning shall burn up tears, Whose sign bid battle reform; A note in the ranks of a clarion, A word in the wind of cheer, To consume as with lightning the carrion That makes time foul for us here; In the air that our dead things infest A blast of the breath of the west, Till east way as west way is clear. Out of the sun beyond sunset, From the evening whence morning shall be, With the rollers in measureless onset, With the van of the storming sea, With the world-wide wind, with the breath That breaks ships driven upon death, With the passion of all things free, With the sea-steeds footless and frantic, White myriads for death to bestride In the charge of the ruining Atlantic Where deaths by regiments ride, With clouds and clamours of waters, With a long note shriller than slaughter's On the furrowless fields world-wide, With terror, with ardour and wonder, With the soul of the season that wakes When the weight of a whole year's thunder In the tidestream of autumn breaks, Let the flight of the wide-winged word Come over, come in and be heard, Take form and fire for our sakes. For a continent bloodless with travail Here toils and brawls as it can, And the web of it who shall unravel Of all that peer on the plan; Would fain grow men, but they grow not, And fain be free, but they know not One name for freedom and man? One name, not twain for division; One thing, not twain, from the birth; Spirit and substance and vision, Worth more than worship is worth; Unbeheld, unadored, undivined, The cause, the centre, the mind, The secret and sense of the earth. Here as a weakling in irons, Here as a weanling in bands, As a prey that the stake-net environs, Our life that we looked for stands; And the man-child naked and dear, Democracy, turns on us here Eyes trembling with tremulous hands. It sees not what season shall bring to it Sweet fruit of its bitter desire; Few voices it hears yet sing to it, Few pulses of hearts reaspire; Foresees not time, nor forehears The noises of imminent years, Earthquake, and thunder, and fire: When crowned and weaponed and curbless It shall walk without helm or shield The bare burnt furrows and herbless Of war's last flame-stricken field, Till godlike, equal with time, It stand in the sun sublime, In the godhead of man revealed. Round your people and over them Light like raiment is drawn, Close as a garment to cover them Wrought not of mail nor of lawn; Here, with hope hardly to wear, Naked nations and bare Swim, sink, strike out for the dawn. Chains are here, and a prison, Kings, and subjects, and shame; If the God upon you be arisen, How should our songs be the same? How, in confusion of change, How shall we sing, in a strange Land, songs praising his name? God is buried and dead to us, Even the spirit of earth, Freedom; so have they said to us, Some with mocking and mirth, Some with heartbreak and tears; And a God without eyes, without ears, Who shall sing of him, dead in the birth? The earth-god Freedom, the lonely Face lightening, the footprint unshod, Not as one man crucified only Nor scourged with but one life's rod; The soul that is substance of nations, Reincarnate with fresh generations; The great god Man, which is God. But in weariest of years and obscurest Doth it live not at heart of all things, The one God and one spirit, a purest Life, fed from unstanchable springs? Within love, within hatred it is, And its seed in the stripe as the kiss, And in slaves is the germ, and in kings. Freedom we call it, for holier Name of the soul's there is none; Surelier it labours, if slowlier, Than the metres of star or of sun; Slowlier than life into breath, Surelier than time into death, It moves till its labour be done. Till the motion be done and the measure Circling through season and clime, Slumber and sorrow and pleasure, Vision of virtue and crime; Till consummate with conquering eyes, A soul disembodied, it rise From the body transfigured of time. Till it rise and remain and take station With the stars of the worlds that rejoice; Till the voice of its heart's exultation Be as theirs an invariable voice; By no discord of evil estranged, By no pause, by no breach in it changed, By no clash in the chord of its choice. It is one with the world's generations, With the spirit, the star, and the sod; With the kingless and king-stricken nations, With the cross, and the chain, and the rod; The most high, the most secret, most lonely, The earth-soul Freedom, that only Lives, and that only is God. CHRISTMAS ANTIPHONES I IN CHURCH Thou whose birth on earth Angels sang to men, While thy stars made mirth, Saviour, at thy birth, This day born again; As this night was bright With thy cradle-ray, Very light of light, Turn the wild world's night To thy perfect day. God whose feet made sweet Those wild ways they trod, From thy fragrant feet Staining field and street With the blood of God; God whose breast is rest In the time of strife, In thy secret breast Sheltering souls opprest From the heat of life; God whose eyes are skies Love-lit as with spheres By the lights that rise To thy watching eyes, Orbèd lights of tears; God whose heart hath part In all grief that is, Was not man's the dart That went through thine heart, And the wound not his? Where the pale souls wail, Held in bonds of death, Where all spirits quail, Came thy Godhead pale Still from human breath— Pale from life and strife, Wan with manhood, came Forth of mortal life, Pierced as with a knife, Scarred as with a flame. Thou the Word and Lord In all time and space Heard, beheld, adored, With all ages poured Forth before thy face, Lord, what worth in earth Drew thee down to die? What therein was worth, Lord, thy death and birth? What beneath thy sky? Light above all love By thy love was lit, And brought down the Dove Feathered from above With the wings of it. From the height of night, Was not thine the star That led forth with might By no worldly light Wise men from afar? Yet the wise men's eyes Saw thee not more clear Than they saw thee rise Who in shepherd's guise Drew as poor men near. Yet thy poor endure, And are with us yet; Be thy name a sure Refuge for thy poor Whom men's eyes forget. Thou whose ways we praise, Clear alike and dark, Keep our works and ways This and all thy days Safe inside thine ark. Who shall keep thy sheep, Lord, and lose not one? Who save one shall keep, Lest the shepherds sleep? Who beside the Son? From the grave-deep wave, From the sword and flame, Thou, even thou, shalt save Souls of king and slave Only by thy Name. Light not born with morn Or her fires above, Jesus virgin-born, Held of men in scorn, Turn their scorn to love. Thou whose face gives grace As the sun's doth heat, Let thy sunbright face Lighten time and space Here beneath thy feet. Bid our peace increase, Thou that madest morn; Bid oppressions cease; Bid the night be peace; Bid the day be born. II OUTSIDE CHURCH We whose days and ways All the night makes dark, What day shall we praise Of these weary days That our life-drops mark? We whose mind is blind, Fed with hope of nought; Wastes of worn mankind, Without heart or mind, Without meat or thought; We with strife of life Worn till all life cease, Want, a whetted knife, Sharpening strife on strife, How should we love peace? Ye whose meat is sweet And your wine-cup red, Us beneath your feet Hunger grinds as wheat, Grinds to make you bread. Ye whose night is bright With soft rest and heat, Clothed like day with light, Us the naked night Slays from street to street. Hath your God no rod, That ye tread so light? Man on us as God, God as man hath trod, Trod us down with might. We that one by one Bleed from either's rod, What for us hath done Man beneath the sun, What for us hath God? We whose blood is food Given your wealth to feed, From the Christless rood Red with no God's blood, But with man's indeed; How shall we that see Nightlong overhead Life, the flowerless tree, Nailed whereon as we Were our fathers dead— We whose ear can hear, Not whose tongue can name, Famine, ignorance, fear, Bleeding tear by tear Year by year of shame, Till the dry life die Out of bloodless breast, Out of beamless eye, Out of mouths that cry Till death feed with rest— How shall we as ye, Though ye bid us, pray? Though ye call, can we Hear you call, or see, Though ye show us day? We whose name is shame, We whose souls walk bare, Shall we call the same God as ye by name, Teach our lips your prayer? God, forgive and give, For His sake who died? Nay, for ours who live, How shall we forgive Thee, then, on our side? We whose right to light Heaven's high noon denies, Whom the blind beams smite That for you shine bright, And but burn our eyes, With what dreams of beams Shall we build up day, At what sourceless streams Seek to drink in dreams Ere they pass away? In what street shall meet, At what market-place, Your feet and our feet, With one goal to greet, Having run one race? What one hope shall ope For us all as one One same horoscope, Where the soul sees hope That outburns the sun? At what shrine what wine, At what board what bread, Salt as blood or brine, Shall we share in sign How we poor were fed? In what hour what power Shall we pray for morn, If your perfect hour, When all day bears flower, Not for us is born? III BEYOND CHURCH Ye that weep in sleep, Souls and bodies bound, Ye that all night keep Watch for change, and weep That no change is found; Ye that cry and die, And the world goes on Without ear or eye, And the days go by Till all days are gone; Man shall do for you, Men the sons of man, What no God would do That they sought unto While the blind years ran. Brotherhood of good, Equal laws and rights, Freedom, whose sweet food Feeds the multitude All their days and nights With the bread full-fed Of her body blest And the soul's wine shed From her table spread Where the world is guest, Mingling me and thee, When like light of eyes Flashed through thee and me Truth shall make us free, Liberty make wise; These are they whom day Follows and gives light Whence they see to slay Night, and burn away All the seed of night. What of thine and mine, What of want and wealth, When one faith is wine For my heart and thine And one draught is health? For no sect elect Is the soul's wine poured And her table decked; Whom should man reject From man's common board? Gods refuse and choose, Grudge and sell and spare; None shall man refuse, None of all men lose, None leave out of care. No man's might of sight Knows that hour before; No man's hand hath might To put back that light For one hour the more. Not though all men call, Kneeling with void hands, Shall they see light fall Till it come for all Tribes of men and lands. No desire brings fire Down from heaven by prayer, Though man's vain desire Hang faith's wind-struck lyre Out in tuneless air. One hath breath and saith What the tune shall be— Time, who puts his breath Into life and death, Into earth and sea. To and fro years flow, Fill their tides and ebb, As his fingers go Weaving to and fro One unfinished web. All the range of change Hath its bounds therein, All the lives that range All the byways strange Named of death or sin. Star from far to star Speaks, and white moons wake, Watchful from afar What the night's ways are For the morning's sake. Many names and flames Pass and flash and fall, Night-begotten names, And the night reclaims, As she bare them, all. But the sun is one, And the sun's name Right; And when light is none Saving of the sun, All men shall have light. All shall see and be Parcel of the morn; Ay, though blind were we, None shall choose but see When that day is born. A NEW YEAR'S MESSAGE To Joseph Mazzini Send the stars light, but send not love to me. Shelley. 1 Out of the dawning heavens that hear Young wings and feet of the new year Move through their twilight, and shed round Soft showers of sound, Soothing the season with sweet rain, If greeting come to make me fain, What is it I can send again? 2 I know not if the year shall send Tidings to usward as a friend, And salutation, and such things Bear on his wings As the soul turns and thirsts unto With hungering eyes and lips that sue For that sweet food which makes all new. 3 I know not if his light shall be Darkness, or else light verily: I know but that it will not part Heart's faith from heart, Truth from the trust in truth, nor hope From sight of days unscaled that ope Beyond one poor year's horoscope. 4 That faith in love which love's self gives, O master of my spirit, lives, Having in presence unremoved Thine head beloved, The shadow of thee, the semitone Of thy voice heard at heart and known, The light of thee not set nor flown. 5 Seas, lands, and hours, can these divide Love from love's service, side from side, Though no sound pass nor breath be heard Of one good word? To send back words of trust to thee Were to send wings to love, when he With his own strong wings covers me. 6 Who shall teach singing to the spheres, Or motion to the flight of years? Let soul with soul keep hand in hand And understand, As in one same abiding-place We keep one watch for one same face To rise in some short sacred space. 7 And all space midway is but nought To keep true heart from faithful thought, As under twilight stars we wait By Time's shut gate Till the slow soundless hinges turn, And through the depth of years that yearn The face of the Republic burn. 1870. MATER DOLOROSA Citoyen, lui dit Enjolras, ma mère, c'est la République. Les Misérables. Who is this that sits by the way, by the wild wayside, In a rent stained raiment, the robe of a cast-off bride, In the dust, in the rainfall sitting, with soiled feet bare, With the night for a garment upon her, with torn wet hair? She is fairer of face than the daughters of men, and her eyes, Worn through with her tears, are deep as the depth of skies. This is she for whose sake being fallen, for whose abject sake, Earth groans in the blackness of darkness, and men's hearts break. This is she for whose love, having seen her, the men that were Poured life out as water, and shed their souls upon air. This is she for whose glory their years were counted as foam; Whose face was a light upon Greece, was a fire upon Rome. Is it now not surely a vain thing, a foolish and vain, To sit down by her, mourn to her, serve her, partake in the pain? She is grey with the dust of time on his manifold ways, Where her faint feet stumble and falter through year-long days. Shall she help us at all, O fools, give fruit or give fame, Who herself is a name despised, a rejected name? We have not served her for guerdon. If any do so, That his mouth may be sweet with such honey, we care not to know. We have drunk from a wine-unsweetened, a perilous cup, A draught very bitter. The kings of the earth stood up, And the rulers took counsel together, to smite her and slay; And the blood of her wounds is given us to drink today. Can these bones live? or the leaves that are dead leaves bud? Or the dead blood drawn from her veins be in your veins blood? Will ye gather up water again that was drawn and shed? In the blood is the life of the veins, and her veins are dead. For the lives that are over are over, and past things past; She had her day, and it is not; was first, and is last. Is it nothing unto you then, all ye that pass by, If her breath be left in her lips, if she live now or die? Behold now, O people, and say if she be not fair, Whom your fathers followed to find her, with praise and prayer, And rejoiced, having found her, though roof they had none nor bread; But ye care not; what is it to you if her day be dead? It was well with our fathers; their sound was in all men's lands; There was fire in their hearts, and the hunger of fight in their hands. Naked and strong they went forth in her strength like flame, For her love's and her name's sake of old, her republican name. But their children, by kings made quiet, by priests made wise, Love better the heat of their hearths than the light of her eyes. Are they children of these thy children indeed, who have sold, O golden goddess, the light of thy face for gold? Are they sons indeed of the sons of thy dayspring of hope, Whose lives are in fief of an emperor, whose souls of a Pope? Hide then thine head, O belovèd; thy time is done; Thy kingdom is broken in heaven, and blind thy sun. What sleep is upon you, to dream she indeed shall rise, When the hopes are dead in her heart as the tears in her eyes? If ye sing of her dead, will she stir? if ye weep for her, weep? Come away now, leave her; what hath she to do but sleep? But ye that mourn are alive, and have years to be; And life is good, and the world is wiser than we. Yea, wise is the world and mighty, with years to give, And years to promise; but how long now shall it live? And foolish and poor is faith, and her ways are bare, Till she find the way of the sun, and the morning air. In that hour shall this dead face shine as the face of the sun, And the soul of man and her soul and the world's be one. MATER TRIUMPHALIS Mother of man's time-travelling generations, Breath of his nostrils, heartblood of his heart, God above all Gods worshipped of all nations, Light above light, law beyond law, thou art. Thy face is as a sword smiting in sunder Shadows and chains and dreams and iron things; The sea is dumb before thy face, the thunder Silent, the skies are narrower than thy wings. Angels and Gods, spirit and sense, thou takest In thy right hand as drops of dust or dew; The temples and the towers of time thou breakest, His thoughts and words and works, to make them new. All we have wandered from thy ways, have hidden Eyes from thy glory and ears from calls they heard; Called of thy trumpets vainly, called and chidden, Scourged of thy speech and wounded of thy word. We have known thee and have not known thee; stood beside thee, Felt thy lips breathe, set foot where thy feet trod, Loved and renounced and worshipped and denied thee, As though thou wert but as another God. “One hour for sleep,” we said, “and yet one other; All day we served her, and who shall serve by night?” Not knowing of thee, thy face not knowing, O mother, O light wherethrough the darkness is as light. Men that forsook thee hast thou not forsaken, Races of men that knew not hast thou known; Nations that slept thou hast doubted not to waken, Worshippers of strange Gods to make thine own. All old grey histories hiding thy clear features, O secret spirit and sovereign, all men's tales, Creeds woven of men thy children and thy creatures, They have woven for vestures of thee and for veils. Thine hands, without election or exemption, Feed all men fainting from false peace or strife, O thou, the resurrection and redemption, The godhead and the manhood and the life. Thy wings shadow the waters; thine eyes lighten The horror of the hollows of the night; The depths of the earth and the dark places brighten Under thy feet, whiter than fire is white. Death is subdued to thee, and hell's bands broken; Where thou art only is heaven; who hears not thee, Time shall not hear him; when men's names are spoken, A nameless sign of death shall his name be. Deathless shall be the death, the name be nameless; Sterile of stars his twilight time of breath; With fire of hell shall shame consume him shameless, And dying, all the night darken his death. The years are as thy garments, the world's ages As sandals bound and loosed from thy swift feet; Time serves before thee, as one that hath for wages Praise or shame only, bitter words or sweet. Thou sayest “Well done,” and all a century kindles; Again thou sayest “Depart from sight of me,” And all the light of face of all men dwindles, And the age is as the broken glass of thee. The night is as a seal set on men's faces, On faces fallen of men that take no light, Nor give light in the deeps of the dark places, Blind things, incorporate with the body of night. Their souls are serpents winterbound and frozen, Their shame is as a tame beast, at their feet Couched; their cold lips deride thee and thy chosen, Their lying lips made grey with dust for meat. Then when their time is full and days run over, The splendour of thy sudden brow made bare Darkens the morning; thy bared hands uncover The veils of light and night and the awful air. And the world naked as a new-born maiden Stands virginal and splendid as at birth, With all thine heaven of all its light unladen, Of all its love unburdened all thine earth. For the utter earth and the utter air of heaven And the extreme depth is thine and the extreme height; Shadows of things and veils of ages riven Are as men's kings unkingdomed in thy sight. Through the iron years, the centuries brazen-gated, By the ages' barred impenetrable doors, From the evening to the morning have we waited, Should thy foot haply sound on the awful floors. The floors untrodden of the sun's feet glimmer, The star-unstricken pavements of the night; Do the lights burn inside? the lights wax dimmer On festal faces withering out of sight. The crowned heads lose the light on them; it may be Dawn is at hand to smite the loud feast dumb; To blind the torch-lit centuries till the day be, The feasting kingdoms till thy kingdom come. Shall it not come? deny they or dissemble, Is it not even as lightning from on high Now? and though many a soul close eyes and tremble, How should they tremble at all who love thee as I? I am thine harp between thine hands, O mother! All my strong chords are strained with love of thee. We grapple in love and wrestle, as each with other Wrestle the wind and the unreluctant sea. I am no courtier of thee sober-suited, Who loves a little for a little pay. Me not thy winds and storms nor thrones disrooted Nor molten crowns nor thine own sins dismay. Sinned hast thou sometime, therefore art thou sinless; Stained hast thou been, who art therefore without stain; Even as man's soul is kin to thee, but kinless Thou, in whose womb Time sows the all-various grain. I do not bid thee spare me, O dreadful mother! I pray thee that thou spare not, of thy grace. How were it with me then, if ever another Should come to stand before thee in this my place? I am the trumpet at thy lips, thy clarion Full of thy cry, sonorous with thy breath; The graves of souls born worms and creeds grown carrion Thy blast of judgment fills with fires of death. Thou art the player whose organ-keys are thunders, And I beneath thy foot the pedal prest; Thou art the ray whereat the rent night sunders, And I the cloudlet borne upon thy breast. I shall burn up before thee, pass and perish, As haze in sunrise on the red sea-line; But thou from dawn to sunsetting shalt cherish The thoughts that led and souls that lighted mine. Reared between night and noon and truth and error, Each twilight-travelling bird that trills and screams Sickens at midday, nor can face for terror The imperious heaven's inevitable extremes. I have no spirit of skill with equal fingers At sign to sharpen or to slacken strings; I keep no time of song with gold-perched singers And chirp of linnets on the wrists of kings. I am thy storm-thrush of the days that darken, Thy petrel in the foam that bears thy bark To port through night and tempest; if thou hearken, My voice is in thy heaven before the lark. My song is in the mist that hides thy morning, My cry is up before the day for thee; I have heard thee and beheld thee and give warning, Before thy wheels divide the sky and sea. Birds shall wake with thee voiced and feathered fairer, To see in summer what I see in spring; I have eyes and heart to endure thee, O thunder-bearer, And they shall be who shall have tongues to sing. I have love at least, and have not fear, and part not From thine unnavigable and wingless way; Thou tarriest, and I have not said thou art not, Nor all thy night long have denied thy day. Darkness to daylight shall lift up thy pæan, Hill to hill thunder, vale cry back to vale, With wind-notes as of eagles Æschylean, And Sappho singing in the nightingale. Sung to by mighty sons of dawn and daughters, Of this night's songs thine ear shall keep but one; That supreme song which shook the channelled waters, And called thee skyward as God calls the sun. Come, though all heaven again be fire above thee; Though death before thee come to clear thy sky; Let us but see in his thy face who love thee; Yea, though thou slay us, arise and let us die. A MARCHING SONG We mix from many lands, We march for very far; In hearts and lips and hands Our staffs and weapons are; The light we walk in darkens sun and moon and star. It doth not flame and wane With years and spheres that roll, Storm cannot shake nor stain The strength that makes it whole, The fire that moulds and moves it of the sovereign soul. We are they that have to cope With time till time retire; We live on hopeless hope, We feed on tears and fire; Time, foot by foot, gives back before our sheer desire. From the edge of harsh derision, From discord and defeat, From doubt and lame division, We pluck the fruit and eat; And the mouth finds it bitter, and the spirit sweet. We strive with time at wrestling Till time be on our side And hope, our plumeless nestling, A full-fledged eaglet ride Down the loud length of storm its windward wings divide. We are girt with our belief, Clothed with our will and crowned; Hope, fear, delight, and grief, Before our will give ground; Their calls are in our ears as shadows of dead sound. All but the heart forsakes us, All fails us but the will; Keen treason tracks and takes us In pits for blood to fill; Friend falls from friend, and faith for faith lays wait to kill. Out under moon and stars And shafts of the urgent sun Whose face on prison-bars And mountain-heads is one, Our march is everlasting till time's march be done. Whither we know, and whence, And dare not care wherethrough. Desires that urge the sense, Fears changing old with new, Perils and pains beset the ways we press into; Earth gives us thorns to tread, And all her thorns are trod; Through lands burnt black and red We pass with feet unshod; Whence we would be man shall not keep us, nor man's God. Through the great desert beasts Howl at our backs by night, And thunder-forging priests Blow their dead bale-fires bright, And on their broken anvils beat out bolts for fight. Inside their sacred smithies Though hot the hammer rings, Their steel links snap like withies, Their chains like twisted strings, Their surest fetters are as plighted words of kings. O nations undivided, O single people and free, We dreamers, we derided, We mad blind men that see, We bear you witness ere ye come that ye shall be. Ye sitting among tombs, Ye standing round the gate, Whom fire-mouthed war consumes, Or cold-lipped peace bids wait, All tombs and bars shall open, every grave and grate. The locks shall burst in sunder, The hinges shrieking spin, When time, whose hand is thunder, Lays hand upon the pin, And shoots the bolts reluctant, bidding all men in. These eyeless times and earless, Shall these not see and hear, And all their hearts burn fearless That were afrost for fear? Is day not hard upon us, yea, not our day near? France! from its grey dejection Make manifest the red Tempestuous resurrection Of thy most sacred head! Break thou the covering cerecloths; rise up from the dead. And thou, whom sea-walls sever From lands unwalled with seas, Wilt thou endure for ever, O Milton's England, these? Thou that wast his Republic, wilt thou clasp their knees? These royalties rust-eaten, These worm-corroded lies, That keep thine head storm-beaten And sunlike strength of eyes From the open heaven and air of intercepted skies; These princelings with gauze winglets That buzz in the air unfurled, These summer-swarming kinglets, These thin worms crowned and curled, That bask and blink and warm themselves about the world; These fanged meridian vermin, Shrill gnats that crowd the dusk, Night-moths whose nestling ermine Smells foul of mould and musk, Blind flesh-flies hatched by dark and hampered in their husk; These honours without honour, These ghost-like gods of gold, This earth that wears upon her To keep her heart from cold No memory more of men that brought it fire of old; These limbs, supine, unbuckled, In rottenness of rest, These sleepy lips blood-suckled And satiate of thy breast, These dull wide mouths that drain thee dry and call thee blest; These masters of thee mindless That wear thee out of mind, These children of thee kindless That use thee out of kind, Whose hands strew gold before thee and contempt behind; Who have turned thy name to laughter, Thy sea-like sounded name That now none hearkens after For faith in its free fame, Who have robbed thee of thy trust and given thee of their shame; These hours that mock each other, These years that kill and die, Are these thy gains, our mother, For all thy gains thrown by? Is this that end whose promise made thine heart so high? With empire and with treason The first right hand made fast, But in man's nobler season To put forth help the last, Love turns from thee, and memory disavows thy past. Lest thine own sea disclaim thee, Lest thine own sons despise, Lest lips shoot out that name thee And seeing thee men shut eyes, Take thought with all thy people, turn thine head and rise. Turn thee, lift up thy face; What ails thee to be dead? Ask of thyself for grace, Seek of thyself for bread, And who shall starve or shame thee, blind or bruise thine head? The same sun in thy sight, The same sea in thine ears, That saw thine hour at height, That sang thy song of years, Behold and hearken for thee, knowing thy hopes and fears. O people, O perfect nation, O England that shall be, How long till thou take station? How long till thralls live free? How long till all thy soul be one with all thy sea? Ye that from south to north, Ye that from east to west, Stretch hands of longing forth And keep your eyes from rest, Lo, when ye will, we bring you gifts of what is best. From the awful northland pines That skirt their wan dim seas To the ardent Apennines And sun-struck Pyrenees, One frost on all their frondage bites the blossoming trees. The leaves look up for light, For heat of helpful air; The trees of oldest height And thin storm-shaken hair Seek with gaunt hands up heavenward if the sun be there. The woods where souls walk lonely, The forests girt with night, Desire the day-star only And firstlings of the light Not seen of slaves nor shining in their masters' sight. We have the morning star, O foolish people, O kings! With us the day-springs are, Even all the fresh day-springs; For us, and with us, all the multitudes of things. O sorrowing hearts of slaves, We heard you beat from far! We bring the light that saves, We bring the morning star; Freedom's good things we bring you, whence all good things are. With us the winds and fountains And lightnings live in tune; The morning-coloured mountains That burn into the noon, The mist's mild veil on valleys muffled from the moon: The thunder-darkened highlands And lowlands hot with fruit, Sea-bays and shoals and islands, And cliffs that foil man's foot, And all the flower of large-limbed life and all the root: The clangour of sea-eagles That teach the morning mirth With baying of heaven's beagles That seek their prey on earth, By sounding strait and channel, gulf and reach and firth. With us the fields and rivers, The grass that summer thrills, The haze where morning quivers, The peace at heart of hills, The sense that kindles nature, and the soul that fills. With us all natural sights, All notes of natural scale; With us the starry lights; With us the nightingale; With us the heart and secret of the worldly tale. The strife of things and beauty, The fire and light adored, Truth, and life-lightening duty, Love without crown or sword, That by his might and godhead makes man god and lord. These have we, these are ours, That no priests give nor kings; The honey of all these flowers, The heart of all these springs; Ours, for where freedom lives not, there live no good things. Rise, ere the dawn be risen; Come, and be all souls fed; From field and street and prison Come, for the feast is spread; Live, for the truth is living; wake, for night is dead. SIENA Inside this northern summer's fold The fields are full of naked gold, Broadcast from heaven on lands it loves; The green veiled air is full of doves; Soft leaves that sift the sunbeams let Light on the small warm grasses wet Fall in short broken kisses sweet, And break again like waves that beat Round the sun's feet. But I, for all this English mirth Of golden-shod and dancing days, And the old green-girt sweet-hearted earth, Desire what here no spells can raise. Far hence, with holier heavens above, The lovely city of my love Bathes deep in the sun-satiate air That flows round no fair thing more fair Her beauty bare. There the utter sky is holier, there More pure the intense white height of air, More clear men's eyes that mine would meet, And the sweet springs of things more sweet. There for this one warm note of doves A clamour of a thousand loves Storms the night's ear, the day's assails, From the tempestuous nightingales, And fills, and fails. O gracious city well-beloved, Italian, and a maiden crowned, Siena, my feet are no more moved Toward thy strange-shapen mountain-bound: But my heart in me turns and moves, O lady loveliest of my loves, Toward thee, to lie before thy feet And gaze from thy fair fountain-seat Up the sheer street; And the house midway hanging see That saw Saint Catherine bodily, Her pilgrimage to Avignon to recall the Pope into Italy as its redeemer from the distractions of the time is of course the central act of St. Catherine's life, the great abiding sign of the greatness of spirit and genius of heroism which distinguished this daughter of the people, and should yet keep her name fresh above the holy horde of saints, in other records than the calendar; but there is no less significance in the story which tells how she succeeded in humanizing a criminal under sentence of death, and given over by the priests as a soul doomed and desperate; how the man thus raised and melted out of his fierce and brutal despair besought her to sustain him to the last by her presence; how, having accompanied him with comfort and support to the very scaffold, and seen his head fall, she took it up, and turning to the spectators who stood doubtful whether the poor wretch could be “saved,” kissed it in sign of her faith that his sins were forgiven him. The high and fixed passion of her heroic temperament gives her a right to remembrance and honour of which the miracle-mongers have done their best to deprive her. Cleared of all the refuse rubbish of thaumaturgy, her life would deserve a chronicler who should do justice at once to the ardour of her religious imagination and to a thing far rarer and more precious—the strength and breadth of patriotic thought and devotion which sent this girl across the Alps to seek the living symbol of Italian hope and unity, and bring it back by force of simple appeal in the name of God and of the country. By the light of those solid and actual qualities which ensure to her no ignoble place on the noble roll of Italian women who have deserved well of Italy, the record of her visions and ecstasies may be read without contemptuous intolerance of hysterical disease. The rapturous visionary and passionate ascetic was in plain matters of this earth as pure and practical a heroine as Joan of Arc. Felt on its floors her sweet feet move, And the live light of fiery love Burn from her beautiful strange face, As in the sanguine sacred place Where in pure hands she took the head Severed, and with pure lips still red Kissed the lips dead. For years through, sweetest of the saints, In quiet without cease she wrought, Till cries of men and fierce complaints From outward moved her maiden thought; And prayers she heard and sighs toward France, “God, send us back deliverance, Send back thy servant, lest we die!” With an exceeding bitter cry They smote the sky. Then in her sacred saving hands She took the sorrows of the lands, With maiden palms she lifted up The sick time's blood-embittered cup, And in her virgin garment furled The faint limbs of a wounded world. Clothed with calm love and clear desire, She went forth in her soul's attire, A missive fire. Across the might of men that strove It shone, and over heads of kings; And molten in red flames of love Were swords and many monstrous things; And shields were lowered, and snapt were spears, And sweeter-tuned the clamorous years; And faith came back, and peace, that were Fled; for she bade, saying, “Thou, God's heir, Hast thou no care? “Lo, men lay waste thine heritage Still, and much heathen people rage Against thee, and devise vain things. What comfort in the face of kings, What counsel is there? Turn thine eyes And thine heart from them in like wise; Turn thee unto thine holy place To help us that of God for grace Require thy face. “For who shall hear us if not thou In a strange land? what doest thou there? Thy sheep are spoiled, and the ploughers plough Upon us; why hast thou no care For all this, and beyond strange hills Liest unregardful what snow chills Thy foldless flock, or what rains beat? Lo, in thine ears, before thy feet, Thy lost sheep bleat. “And strange men feed on faultless lives, And there is blood, and men put knives, Shepherd, unto the young lamb's throat; And one hath eaten, and one smote, And one had hunger and is fed Full of the flesh of these, and red With blood of these as who drinks wine. And God knoweth, who hath sent thee a sign, If these were thine.” But the Pope's heart within him burned, So that he rose up, seeing the sign, And came among them; but she turned Back to her daily way divine, And fed her faith with silent things, And lived her life with curbed white wings, And mixed herself with heaven and died: And now on the sheer city-side Smiles like a bride. You see her in the fresh clear gloom, Where walls shut out the flame and bloom Of full-breathed summer, and the roof Keeps the keen ardent air aloof And sweet weight of the violent sky: There bodily beheld on high, She seems as one hearing in tune Heaven within heaven, at heaven's full noon, In sacred swoon: A solemn swoon of sense that aches With imminent blind heat of heaven, While all the wide-eyed spirit wakes, Vigilant of the supreme Seven, Whose choral flames in God's sight move, Made unendurable with love, That without wind or blast of breath Compels all things through life and death Whither God saith. There on the dim side-chapel wall In the church of San Domenico. Thy mighty touch memorial, Razzi, raised up, for ages dead, And fixed for us her heavenly head: And, rent with plaited thorn and rod, Bared the live likeness of her God To men's eyes turning from strange lands, Where, pale from thine immortal hands, Christ wounded stands; And the blood blots his holy hair And white brows over hungering eyes That plead against us, and the fair Mute lips forlorn of words or sighs In the great torment that bends down His bruised head with the bloomless crown, White as the unfruitful thorn-flower, A God beheld in dreams that were Beheld of her. In vain on all these sins and years Falls the sad blood, fall the slow tears; In vain poured forth as watersprings, Priests, on your altars, and ye, kings, About your seats of sanguine gold; Still your God, spat upon and sold, Bleeds at your hands; but now is gone All his flock from him saving one; Judas alone. Surely your race it was that he, O men signed backward with his name, Beholding in Gethsemane Bled the red bitter sweat of shame, Knowing how the word of Christian should Mean to men evil and not good, Seem to men shameful for your sake, Whose lips, for all the prayers they make, Man's blood must slake. But blood nor tears ye love not, you In the Sienese Academy the two things notable to me were the detached wall-painting by Sodoma of the tortures of Christ bound to the pillar, and the divine though mutilated group of the Graces in the centre of the main hall. The glory and beauty of ancient sculpture refresh and satisfy beyond expression a sense wholly wearied and well-nigh nauseated with contemplation of endless sanctities and agonies attempted by mediæval art, while yet as handless as accident or barbarism has left the sculptured goddesses. That my love leads my longing to, Fair as the world's old faith of flowers, O golden goddesses of ours! From what Idalian rose-pleasance Hath Aphrodite bidden glance The lovelier lightnings of your feet? From what sweet Paphian sward or seat Led you more sweet? O white three sisters, three as one, With flowerlike arms for flowery bands Your linked limbs glitter like the sun, And time lies beaten at your hands. Time and wild years and wars and men Pass, and ye care not whence or when; With calm lips over sweet for scorn, Ye watch night pass, O children born Of the old-world morn. Ah, in this strange and shrineless place, What doth a goddess, what a Grace, Where no Greek worships her shrined limbs With wreaths and Cytherean hymns? Where no lute makes luxurious The adoring airs in Amathus, Till the maid, knowing her mother near, Sobs with love, aching with sweet fear? What do ye here? For the outer land is sad, and wears A raiment of a flaming fire; And the fierce fruitless mountain stairs Climb, yet seem wroth and loth to aspire, Climb, and break, and are broken down, And through their clefts and crests the town Looks west and sees the dead sun lie, In sanguine death that stains the sky With angry dye. And from the war-worn wastes without In twilight, in the time of doubt, One sound comes of one whisper, where Moved with low motions of slow air The great trees nigh the castle swing In the sad coloured evening; “Ricorditi di me, che son La Pia”—that small sweet word alone Is not yet gone. “Ricorditi di me”—the sound Sole out of deep dumb days remote Across the fiery and fatal ground Comes tender as a hurt bird's note To where, a ghost with empty hands, A woe-worn ghost, her palace stands In the mid city, where the strong Bells turn the sunset air to song, And the towers throng. With other face, with speech the same, A mightier maiden's likeness came Late among mourning men that slept, A sacred ghost that went and wept, White as the passion-wounded Lamb, Saying, “Ah, remember me, that am Italia.” (From deep sea to sea Earth heard, earth knew her, that this was she.) “Ricorditi. “Love made me of all things fairest thing, And Hate unmade me; this knows he Who with God's sacerdotal ring Enringed mine hand, espousing me.” Yea, in thy myriad-mooded woe, Yea, Mother, hast thou not said so? Have not our hearts within us stirred, O thou most holiest, at thy word? Have we not heard? As this dead tragic land that she Found deadly, such was time to thee; Years passed thee withering in the red Maremma, years that deemed thee dead, Ages that sorrowed or that scorned; And all this while though all they mourned Thou sawest the end of things unclean, And the unborn that should see thee a queen. Have we not seen? The weary poet, thy sad son, Upon thy soil, under thy skies, Saw all Italian things save one— I nostri padri antichi.LEOPARDI. Italia; this thing missed his eyes; The old mother-might, the breast, the face, That reared, that lit the Roman race; This not Leopardi saw; but we, What is it, Mother, that we see, What if not thee? Look thou from Siena southward home, Where the priest's pall hangs rent on Rome, And through the red rent swaddling-bands Towards thine she strains her labouring hands. Look thou and listen, and let be All the dead quick, all the bond free; In the blind eyes let there be sight; In the eighteen centuries of the night Let there be light. Bow down the beauty of thine head, Sweet, and with lips of living breath Kiss thy sons sleeping and thy dead, That there be no more sleep or death. Give us thy light, thy might, thy love, Whom thy face seen afar above Drew to thy feet; and when, being free, Thou hast blest thy children born to thee, Bless also me. Me that when others played or slept Sat still under thy cross and wept; Me who so early and unaware Felt fall on bent bared brows and hair (Thin drops of the overflowing flood!) The bitter blessing of thy blood; The sacred shadow of thy pain, Thine, the true maiden-mother, slain And raised again. Me consecrated, if I might, To praise thee, or to love at least, O mother of all men's dear delight, Thou madest a choral-souled boy-priest, Before my lips had leave to sing, Or my hands hardly strength to cling About the intolerable tree Whereto they had nailed my heart and thee And said, “Let be.” For to thee too the high Fates gave Grace to be sacrificed and save, That being arisen, in the equal sun, God and the People should be one; By those red roads thy footprints trod, Man more divine, more human God, Saviour; that where no light was known But darkness, and a daytime flown, Light should be shown. Let there be light, O Italy! For our feet falter in the night. O lamp of living years to be, O light of God, let there be light! Fill with a love keener than flame Men sealed in spirit with thy name, The cities and the Roman skies, Where men with other than man's eyes Saw thy sun rise. For theirs thou wast and thine were they Whose names outshine thy very day; For they are thine and theirs thou art Whose blood beats living in man's heart, Remembering ages fled and dead Wherein for thy sake these men bled; They that saw Trebia, they that see Mentana, they in years to be That shall see thee. For thine are all of us, and ours Thou; till the seasons bring to birth A perfect people, and all the powers Be with them that bear fruit on earth; Till the inner heart of man be one With freedom, and the sovereign sun; And Time, in likeness of a guide, Lead the Republic as a bride Up to God's side. COR CORDIUM O heart of hearts, the chalice of love's fire, Hid round with flowers and all the bounty of bloom; O wonderful and perfect heart, for whom The lyrist liberty made life a lyre; O heavenly heart, at whose most dear desire Dead love, living and singing, cleft his tomb, And with him risen and regent in death's room All day thy choral pulses rang full choir; O heart whose beating blood was running song, O sole thing sweeter than thine own songs were, Help us for thy free love's sake to be free, True for thy truth's sake, for thy strength's sake strong, Till very liberty make clean and fair The nursing earth as the sepulchral sea. IN SAN LORENZO Is thine hour come to wake, O slumbering Night? Hath not the Dawn a message in thine ear? Though thou be stone and sleep, yet shalt thou hear When the word falls from heaven—Let there be light. Thou knowest we would not do thee the despite To wake thee while the old sorrow and shame were near; We spake not loud for thy sake, and for fear Lest thou shouldst lose the rest that was thy right, The blessing given thee that was thine alone, The happiness to sleep and to be stone: Nay, we kept silence of thee for thy sake Albeit we knew thee alive, and left with thee The great good gift to feel not nor to see; But will not yet thine Angel bid thee wake? TIRESIAS PART I It is an hour before the hour of dawn. Set in mine hand my staff and leave me here Outside the hollow house that blind men fear, More blind than I who live on life withdrawn And feel on eyes that see not but foresee The shadow of death which clothes Antigone. Here lay her living body that here lies Dead, if man living know what thing is death, If life be all made up of blood and breath, And no sense be save as of ears and eyes. But heart there is not, tongue there is not found, To think or sing what verge hath life or bound. In the beginning when the powers that made The young child man a little loved him, seeing His joy of life and fair face of his being, And bland and laughing with the man-child played, As friends they saw on our divine one day King Cadmus take to queen Harmonia. The strength of soul that builds up as with hands Walls spiritual and towers and towns of thought Which only fate, not force, can bring to nought, Took then to wife the light of all men's lands, War's child and love's, most sweet and wise and strong, Order of things and rule and guiding song. It was long since: yea, even the sun that saw Remembers hardly what was, nor how long. And now the wise heart of the worldly song Is perished, and the holy hand of law Can set no tune on time, nor help again The power of thought to build up life for men. Yea, surely are they now transformed or dead, And sleep below this world, where no sun warms, Or move about it now in formless forms Incognizable, and all their lordship fled; And where they stood up singing crawl and hiss, With fangs that kill behind their lips that kiss. Yet though her marriage-garment, seeming fair, Was dyed in sin and woven of jealousy To turn their seed to poison, time shall see The gods reissue from them, and repair Their broken stamp of godhead, and again Thought and wise love sing words of law to men. I, Tiresias the prophet, seeing in Thebes Much evil, and the misery of men's hands Who sow with fruitless wheat the stones and sands, With fruitful thorns the fallows and warm glebes, Bade their hands hold lest worse hap came to pass; But which of you had heed of Tiresias? I am as Time's self in mine own wearied mind, Whom the strong heavy-footed years have led From night to night and dead men unto dead, And from the blind hope to the memory blind; For each man's life is woven, as Time's life is, Of blind young hopes and old blind memories. I am a soul outside of death and birth. I see before me and afterward I see, O child, O corpse, the live dead face of thee, Whose life and death are one thing upon earth Where day kills night and night again kills day And dies; but where is that Harmonia? O all-beholden light not seen of me, Air, and warm winds that under the sun's eye Stretch your strong wings at morning; and thou, sky, Whose hollow circle engirdling earth and sea All night the set stars limit, and all day The moving sun remeasures; ye, I say, Ye heights of hills, and thou Dircean spring Inviolable, and ye towers that saw cast down Seven kings keen-sighted toward your seven-faced town And quenched the red seed of one sightless king; And thou, for death less dreadful than for birth, Whose wild leaves hide the horror of the earth, O mountain whereon gods made chase of kings, Cithæron, thou that sawest on Pentheus dead Fangs of a mother fasten and wax red And satiate with a son thy swollen springs, And heardst her cry fright all thine eyries' nests Who gave death suck at sanguine-suckling breasts; Yea, and a grief more grievous, without name, A curse too grievous for the name of grief, Thou sawest, and heardst the rumour scare belief Even unto death and madness, when the flame Was lit whose ashes dropped about the pyre That of two brethren made one sundering fire; O bitter nurse, that on thine hard bare knees Rear'dst for his fate the bloody-footed child Whose hands should be more bloodily defiled And the old blind feet walk wearier ways than these, Whose seed, brought forth in darkness unto doom, Should break as fire out of his mother's womb; I bear you witness as ye bear to me, Time, day, night, sun, stars, life, death, air, sea, earth, And ye that round the human house of birth Watch with veiled heads and weaponed hands, and see Good things and evil, strengthless yet and dumb, Sit in the clouds with cloudlike hours to come; Ye forces without form and viewless powers That have the keys of all our years in hold, That prophesy too late with tongues of gold, In a strange speech whose words are perished hours, I witness to you what good things ye give As ye to me what evil while I live. What should I do to blame you, what to praise, For floral hours and hours funereal? What should I do to curse or bless at all For winter-woven or summer-coloured days? Curse he that will and bless you whoso can, I have no common part in you with man. I hear a springing water, whose quick sound Makes softer the soft sunless patient air, And the wind's hand is laid on my thin hair Light as a lover's, and the grasses round Have odours in them of green bloom and rain Sweet as the kiss wherewith sleep kisses pain. I hear the low sound of the spring of time Still beating as the low live throb of blood, And where its waters gather head and flood I hear change moving on them, and the chime Across them of reverberate wings of hours Sounding, and feel the future air of flowers. The wind of change is soft as snow, and sweet The sense thereof as roses in the sun, The faint wind springing with the springs that run, The dim sweet smell of flowering hopes, and heat Of unbeholden sunrise; yet how long I know not, till the morning put forth song. I prophesy of life, who live with death; Of joy, being sad; of sunlight, who am blind; Of man, whose ways are alien from mankind And his lips are not parted with man's breath; I am a word out of the speechless years, The tongue of time, that no man sleeps who hears. I stand a shadow across the door of doom, Athwart the lintel of death's house, and wait; Nor quick nor dead, nor flexible by fate, Nor quite of earth nor wholly of the tomb; A voice, a vision, light as fire or air, Driven between days that shall be and that were. I prophesy, with feet upon a grave, Of death cast out and life devouring death As flame doth wood and stubble with a breath; Of freedom, though all manhood were one slave; Of truth, though all the world were liar; of love, That time nor hate can raze the witness of. Life that was given for love's sake and his law's Their powers have no more power on; they divide Spoils wrung from lust or wrath of man or pride, And keen oblivion without pity or pause Sets them on fire and scatters them on air Like ashes shaken from a suppliant's hair. But life they lay no hand on; life once given No force of theirs hath competence to take; Life that was given for some divine thing's sake, To mix the bitterness of earth with heaven, Light with man's night, and music with his breath, Dies not, but makes its living food of death. I have seen this, who live where men are not, In the high starless air of fruitful night On that serenest and obscurest height Where dead and unborn things are one in thought And whence the live unconquerable springs Feed full of force the torrents of new things. I have seen this, who saw long since, being man, As now I know not if indeed I be, The fair bare body of Wisdom, good to see And evil, whence my light and night began; Light on the goal and darkness on the way, Light all through night and darkness all through day. Mother, that by that Pegasean spring Call. Lav. Pall. 105–112. Didst fold round in thine arms thy blinded son, Weeping “O holiest, what thing hast thou done, What, to my child? woe's me that see the thing! Is this thy love to me-ward, and hereof Must I take sample how the gods can love? “O child, thou hast seen indeed, poor child of mine, The breasts and flanks of Pallas bare in sight, But never shalt see more the dear sun's light; O Helicon, how great a pay is thine For some poor antelopes and wild-deer dead, My child's eyes hast thou taken in their stead—” Mother, thou knewest not what she had to give, Thy goddess, though then angered, for mine eyes; Fame and foreknowledge, and to be most wise, And centuries of high-thoughted life to live, And in mine hand this guiding staff to be As eyesight to the feet of men that see. Perchance I shall not die at all, nor pass The general door and lintel of men dead; Yet even the very tongue of wisdom said What grace should come with death to Tiresias, What special honour that God's hand accord Who gathers all men's nations as their lord. And sometimes when the secret eye of thought Is changed with obscuration, and the sense Aches with long pain of hollow prescience, And fiery foresight with foresuffering bought Seems even to infect my spirit and consume, Hunger and thirst come on me for the tomb. I could be fain to drink my death and sleep, And no more wrapped about with bitter dreams Talk with the stars and with the winds and streams And with the inevitable years, and weep; For how should he who communes with the years Be sometime not a living spring of tears? O child, that guided of thine only will Didst set thy maiden foot against the gate To strike it open ere thine hour of fate, Antigone, men say not thou didst ill, For love's sake and the reverence of his awe Divinely dying, slain by mortal law; For love is awful as immortal death. And through thee surely hath thy brother won Rest, out of sight of our world-weary sun, And in the dead land where ye ghosts draw breath A royal place and honour; so wast thou Happy, though earth have hold of thee too now. So hast thou life and name inviolable And joy it may be, sacred and severe, Joy secret-souled beyond all hope or fear, A monumental joy wherein to dwell Secluse and silent, a selected state, Serene possession of thy proper fate. Thou art not dead as these are dead who live Full of blind years, a sorrow-shaken kind, Nor as these are am I the prophet blind; They have not life that have not heart to give Life, nor have eyesight who lack heart to see When to be not is better than to be. O ye whom time but bears with for a span, How long will ye be blind and dead, how long Make your own souls part of your own soul's wrong? Son of the word of the most high gods, man, Why wilt thou make thine hour of light and breath Emptier of all but shame than very death? Fool, wilt thou live for ever? though thou care With all thine heart for life to keep it fast, Shall not thine hand forego it at the last? Lo, thy sure hour shall take thee by the hair Sleeping, or when thou knowest not, or wouldst fly; And as men died much mightier shalt thou die. Yea, they are dead, men much more worth than thou; The savour of heroic lives that were, Is it not mixed into thy common air? The sense of them is shed about thee now: Feel not thy brows a wind blowing from far? Aches not thy forehead with a future star? The light that thou may'st make out of thy name Is in the wind of this same hour that drives, Blown within reach but once of all men's lives; And he that puts forth hand upon the flame Shall have it for a garland on his head To sign him for a king among the dead. But these men that the lessening years behold, Who sit the most part without flame or crown, And brawl and sleep and wear their life-days down With joys and griefs ignobler than of old, And care not if the better day shall be— Are these or art thou dead, Antigone? PART II As when one wakes out of a waning dream And sees with instant eyes the naked thought Whereof the vision as a web was wrought, I saw beneath a heaven of cloud and gleam, Ere yet the heart of the young sun waxed brave, One like a prophet standing by a grave. In the hoar heaven was hardly beam or breath, And all the coloured hills and fields were grey, And the wind wandered seeking for the day, And wailed as though he had found her done to death And this grey hour had built to bury her The hollow twilight for a sepulchre. But in my soul I saw as in a glass A pale and living body full of grace There lying, and over it the prophet's face Fixed; and the face was not of Tiresias, For such a starry fire was in his eyes As though their light it was that made the skies. Such eyes should God's have been when very love Looked forth of them and set the sun aflame, And such his lips that called the light by name And bade the morning forth at sound thereof; His face was sad and masterful as fate, And like a star's his look compassionate. Like a star's gazed on of sad eyes so long It seems to yearn with pity, and all its fire As a man's heart to tremble with desire And heave as though the light would bring forth song; Yet from his face flashed lightning on the land, And like the thunder-bearer's was his hand. The steepness of strange stairs had tired his feet, And his lips yet seemed sick of that salt bread Wherewith the lips of banishment are fed; But nothing was there in the world so sweet As the most bitter love, like God's own grace, Wherewith he gazed on that fair buried face. Grief and glad pride and passion and sharp shame, Wrath and remembrance, faith and hope and hate And pitiless pity of days degenerate, Were in his eyes as an incorporate flame That burned about her, and the heart thereof And central flower was very fire of love. But all about her grave wherein she slept Were noises of the wild wind-footed years Whose footprints flying were full of blood and tears, Shrieks as of Mænads on their hills that leapt And yelled as beasts of ravin, and their meat Was the rent flesh of their own sons to eat: And fiery shadows passing with strange cries, And Sphinx-like shapes about the ruined lands, And the red reek of parricidal hands And intermixture of incestuous eyes, And light as of that self-divided flame Which made an end of the Cadmean name. And I beheld again, and lo the grave, And the bright body laid therein as dead, And the same shadow across another head That bowed down silent on that sleeping slave Who was the lady of empire from her birth And light of all the kingdoms of the earth. Within the compass of the watcher's hand All strengths of other men and divers powers Were held at ease and gathered up as flowers; His heart was as the heart of his whole land, And at his feet as natural servants lay Twilight and dawn and night and labouring day. He was most awful of the sons of God. Even now men seeing seemed at his lips to see The trumpet of the judgment that should be, And in his right hand terror for a rod, And in the breath that made the mountains bow The horned fire of Moses on his brow. The strong wind of the coming of the Lord Had blown as flame upon him, and brought down On his bare head from heaven fire for a crown, And fire was girt upon him as a sword To smite and lighten, and on what ways he trod There fell from him the shadow of a God. Pale, with the whole world's judgment in his eyes, He stood and saw the grief and shame endure That he, though highest of angels, might not cure, And the same sins done under the same skies, And the same slaves to the same tyrants thrown, And fain he would have slept, and fain been stone. But with unslumbering eyes he watched the sleep That sealed her sense whose eyes were suns of old; And the night shut and opened, and behold, The same grave where those prophets came to weep, But she that lay therein had moved and stirred, And where those twain had watched her stood a third. The tripled rhyme that closed in Paradise With Love's name sealing up its starry speech— The tripled might of hand that found in reach All crowns beheld far off of all men's eyes, Song, colour, carven wonders of live stone— These were not, but the very soul alone. The living spirit, the good gift of grace, The faith which takes of its own blood to give That the dead veins of buried hope may live, Came on her sleeping, face to naked face, And from a soul more sweet than all the south Breathed love upon her sealed and breathless mouth. Between her lips the breath was blown as fire, And through her flushed veins leapt the liquid life, And with sore passion and ambiguous strife The new birth rent her and the new desire, The will to live, the competence to be, The sense to hearken and the soul to see. And the third prophet standing by her grave Stretched forth his hand and touched her, and her eyes Opened as sudden suns in heaven might rise, And her soul caught from his the faith to save; Faith above creeds, faith beyond records, born Of the pure, naked, fruitful, awful morn. For in the daybreak now that night was dead The light, the shadow, the delight, the pain, The purpose and the passion of those twain, Seemed gathered on that third prophetic head, And all their crowns were as one crown, and one His face with her face in the living sun. For even with that communion of their eyes His whole soul passed into her and made her strong; And all the sounds and shows of shame and wrong, The hand that slays, the lip that mocks and lies, Temples and thrones that yet men seem to see— Are these dead or art thou dead, Italy? THE SONG OF THE STANDARD Maiden most beautiful, mother most bountiful, lady of lands, Queen and republican, crowned of the centuries whose years are thy sands, See for thy sake what we bring to thee, Italy, here in our hands. This is the banner thy gonfalon, fair in the front of thy fight, Red from the hearts that were pierced for thee, white as thy mountains are white, Green as the spring of thy soul everlasting, whose life-blood is light. Take to thy bosom thy banner, a fair bird fit for the nest, Feathered for flight into sunrise or sunset, for eastward or west, Fledged for the flight everlasting, but held yet warm to thy breast. Gather it close to thee, song-bird or storm-bearer, eagle or dove, Lift it to sunward, a beacon beneath to the beacon above, Green as our hope in it, white as our faith in it, red as our love. Thunder and splendour of lightning are hid in the folds of it furled; Who shall unroll it but thou, as thy bolt to be handled and hurled, Out of whose lips is the honey, whose bosom the milk of the world? Out of thine hands hast thou fed us with pasture of colour and song; Glory and beauty by birthright to thee as thy garments belong; Out of thine hands thou shalt give us as surely deliverance from wrong. Out of thine eyes thou hast shed on us love as a lamp in our night, Wisdom a lodestar to ships, and remembrance a flame-coloured light; Out of thine eyes thou shalt shew us as surely the sundawn of right. Turn to us, speak to us, Italy, mother, but once and a word, None shall not follow thee, none shall not serve thee, not one that has heard; Twice hast thou spoken a message, and time is athirst for the third. Kingdom and empire of peoples thou hadst, and thy lordship made one North sea and south sea and east men and west men that look on the sun; Spirit was in thee and counsel, when soul in the nations was none. Banner and beacon thou wast to the centuries of storm-wind and foam, Ages that clashed in the dark with each other, and years without home; Empress and prophetess wast thou, and what wilt thou now be, O Rome? Ah, by the faith and the hope and the love that have need of thee now, Shines not thy face with the forethought of freedom, and burns not thy brow? Who is against her but all men? and who is beside her but thou? Art thou not better than all men? and where shall she turn but to thee? Lo, not a breath, not a beam, not a beacon from midland to sea; Freedom cries out for a sign among nations, and none will be free. England in doubt of her, France in despair of her, all without heart— Stand on her side in the vanward of ages, and strike on her part! Strike but one stroke for the love of her love of thee, sweet that thou art! Take in thy right hand thy banner, a strong staff fit for thine hand; Forth at the light of it lifted shall foul things flock from the land; Faster than stars from the sun shall they fly, being lighter than sand. Green thing to green in the summer makes answer, and rose-tree to rose; Lily by lily the year becomes perfect; and none of us knows What thing is fairest of all things on earth as it brightens and blows. This thing is fairest in all time of all things, in all time is best— Freedom, that made thee, our mother, and suckled her sons at thy breast; Take to thy bosom the nations, and there shall the world come to rest. ON THE DOWNS A faint sea without wind or sun; A sky like flameless vapour dun; A valley like an unsealed grave That no man cares to weep upon, Bare, without boon to crave, Or flower to save. And on the lip's edge of the down, Here where the bent-grass burns to brown In the dry sea-wind, and the heath Crawls to the cliff-side and looks down, I watch, and hear beneath The low tide breathe. Along the long lines of the cliff, Down the flat sea-line without skiff Or sail or back-blown fume for mark, Through wind-worn heads of heath and stiff Stems blossomless and stark With dry sprays dark, I send mine eyes out as for news Of comfort that all these refuse, Tidings of light or living air From windward where the low clouds muse And the sea blind and bare Seems full of care. So is it now as it was then, And as men have been such are men. There as I stood I seem to stand, Here sitting chambered, and again Feel spread on either hand Sky, sea, and land. As a queen taken and stripped and bound Sat earth, discoloured and discrowned; As a king's palace empty and dead The sky was, without light or sound; And on the summer's head Were ashes shed. Scarce wind enough was on the sea, Scarce hope enough there moved in me, To sow with live blown flowers of white The green plain's sad serenity, Or with stray thoughts of light Touch my soul's sight. By footless ways and sterile went My thought unsatisfied, and bent With blank unspeculative eyes On the untracked sands of discontent Where, watched of helpless skies, Life hopeless lies. East and west went my soul to find Light, and the world was bare and blind And the soil herbless where she trod And saw men laughing scourge mankind, Unsmitten by the rod Of any God. Out of time's blind old eyes were shed Tears that were mortal, and left dead The heart and spirit of the years, And on man's fallen and helmless head Time's disanointing tears Fell cold as fears. Hope flowering had but strength to bear The fruitless fruitage of despair; Grief trod the grapes of joy for wine, Whereof love drinking unaware Died as one undivine And made no sign. And soul and body dwelt apart; And weary wisdom without heart Stared on the dead round heaven and sighed, “Is death too hollow as thou art, Or as man's living pride?” And saying so died. And my soul heard the songs and groans That are about and under thrones, And felt through all time's murmur thrill Fate's old imperious semitones That made of good and ill One same tune still. Then “Where is God? and where is aid? Or what good end of these?” she said; “Is there no God or end at all, Nor reason with unreason weighed, Nor force to disenthral Weak feet that fall? “No light to lighten and no rod To chasten men? Is there no God?” So girt with anguish, iron-zoned, Went my soul weeping as she trod Between the men enthroned And men that groaned. O fool, that for brute cries of wrong Heard not the grey glad mother's song Ring response from the hills and waves, But heard harsh noises all day long Of spirits that were slaves And dwelt in graves. The wise word of the secret earth Who knows what life and death are worth, And how no help and no control Can speed or stay things come to birth, Nor all worlds' wheels that roll Crush one born soul. With all her tongues of life and death, With all her bloom and blood and breath, From all years dead and all things done, In the ear of man the mother saith, “There is no God, O son, If thou be none.” So my soul sick with watching heard That day the wonder of that word, And as one springs out of a dream Sprang, and the stagnant wells were stirred Whence flows through gloom and gleam Thought's soundless stream. Out of pale cliff and sunburnt heath, Out of the low sea curled beneath In the land's bending arm embayed, Out of all lives that thought hears breathe Life within life inlaid, Was answer made. A multitudinous monotone Of dust and flower and seed and stone, In the deep sea-rock's mid-sea sloth, In the live water's trembling zone, In all men love and loathe, One God at growth. One forceful nature uncreate That feeds itself with death and fate, Evil and good, and change and time, That within all men lies at wait Till the hour shall bid them climb And live sublime. For all things come by fate to flower At their unconquerable hour, And time brings truth, and truth makes free, And freedom fills time's veins with power, As, brooding on that sea, My thought filled me. And the sun smote the clouds and slew, And from the sun the sea's breath blew, And white waves laughed and turned and fled The long green heaving sea-field through, And on them overhead The sky burnt red. Like a furled flag that wind sets free, On the swift summer-coloured sea Shook out the red lines of the light, The live sun's standard, blown to lee Across the live sea's white And green delight. And with divine triumphant awe My spirit moved within me saw, With burning passion of stretched eyes, Clear as the light's own firstborn law, In windless wastes of skies Time's deep dawn rise. MESSIDOR Put in the sickles and reap; For the morning of harvest is red, And the long large ranks of the corn Coloured and clothed as the morn Stand thick in the fields and deep For them that faint to be fed. Let all that hunger and weep Come hither, and who would have bread Put in the sickles and reap. Coloured and clothed as the morn, The grain grows ruddier than gold, And the good strong sun is alight In the mists of the day-dawn white, And the crescent, a faint sharp horn, In the fear of his face turns cold As the snakes of the night-time that creep From the flag of our faith unrolled. Put in the sickles and reap. In the mists of the day-dawn white That roll round the morning star, The large flame lightens and grows Till the red-gold harvest-rows, Full-grown, are full of the light As the spirits of strong men are, Crying, Who shall slumber or sleep? Who put back morning or mar? Put in the sickles and reap. Till the red-gold harvest-rows For miles through shudder and shine In the wind's breath, fed with the sun, A thousand spear-heads as one Bowed as for battle to close Line in rank against line With place and station to keep Till all men's hands at a sign Put in the sickles and reap. A thousand spear-heads as one Wave as with swing of the sea When the mid tide sways at its height; For the hour is for harvest or fight In face of the just calm sun, As the signal in season may be And the lot in the helm may leap When chance shall shake it; but ye, Put in the sickles and reap. For the hour is for harvest or fight To clothe with raiment of red; O men sore stricken of hours, Lo, this one, is not it ours To glean, to gather, to smite? Let none make risk of his head Within reach of the clean scythe-sweep, When the people that lay as the dead Put in the sickles and reap. Lo, this one, is not it ours, Now the ruins of dead things rattle As dead men's bones in the pit, Now the kings wax lean as they sit Girt round with memories of powers, With musters counted as cattle And armies folded as sheep Till the red blind husbandman battle Put in the sickles and reap? Now the kings wax lean as they sit, The people grow strong to stand; The men they trod on and spat, The dumb dread people that sat As corpses cast in a pit, Rise up with God at their hand, And thrones are hurled on a heap, And strong men, sons of the land, Put in the sickles and reap. The dumb dread people that sat All night without screen for the night, All day without food for the day, They shall give not their harvest away, They shall eat of its fruit and wax fat: They shall see the desire of their sight, Though the ways of the seasons be steep, They shall climb with face to the light, Put in the sickles and reap. ODE ON THE INSURRECTION IN CANDIA Str. 1 I laid my laurel-leaf At the white feet of grief, Seeing how with covered face and plumeless wings, With unreverted head Veiled, as who mourns his dead, Lay Freedom couched between the thrones of kings, A wearied lion without lair, And bleeding from base wounds, and vexed with alien air. Str. 2 Who was it, who, put poison to thy mouth, Who lulled with craft or chant thy vigilant eyes, O light of all men, lamp to north and south, Eastward and westward, under all men's skies? For if thou sleep, we perish, and thy name Dies with the dying of our ephemeral breath; And if the dust of death o'ergrows thy flame, Heaven also is darkened with the dust of death. If thou be mortal, if thou change or cease, If thine hand fail, or thine eyes turn from Greece, Thy firstborn, and the firstfruits of thy fame, God is no God, and man is moulded out of shame. Str. 3 Is there change in the secret skies, In the sacred places that see The divine beginning of things, The weft of the web of the world? Is Freedom a worm that dies, And God no God of the free? Is heaven like as earth with her kings And time as a serpent curled Round life as a tree? From the steel-bound snows of the north, From the mystic mother, the east, From the sands of the fiery south, From the low-lit clouds of the west, A sound of a cry is gone forth; Arise, stand up from the feast, Let wine be far from the mouth, Let no man sleep or take rest, Till the plague hath ceased. Let none rejoice or make mirth Till the evil thing be stayed, Nor grief be lulled in the lute, Nor hope be loud on the lyre; Let none be glad upon earth. O music of young man and maid, O songs of the bride, be mute. For the light of her eyes, her desire, Is the soul dismayed. It is not a land new-born That is scourged of a stranger's hand, That is rent and consumed with flame. We have known it of old, this face, With the cheeks and the tresses torn, With shame on the brow as a brand. We have named it of old by name, The land of the royallest race, The most holy land. Str. 4 Had I words of fire, Whose words are weak as snow; Were my heart a lyre Whence all its love might flow In the mighty modulations of desire, In the notes wherewith man's passion worships woe; Could my song release The thought weak words confine, And my grief, O Greece, Prove how it worships thine; It would move with pulse of war the limbs of peace Till she flushed and trembled and became divine. (Once she held for true This truth of sacred strain; Though blood drip like dew And life run down like rain, It is better that war spare but one or two Than that many live, and liberty be slain.) Then with fierce increase And bitter mother's mirth, From the womb of peace, A womb that yearns for birth, As a man-child should deliverance come to Greece, As a saviour should the child be born on earth. Str. 5 O that these my days had been Ere white peace and shame were wed Without torch or dancers' din Round the unsacred marriage-bed! For of old the sweet-tongued law, Freedom, clothed with all men's love, Girt about with all men's awe, With the wild war-eagle mated The white breast of peace the dove, And his ravenous heart abated And his windy wings were furled In an eyrie consecrated Where the snakes of strife uncurled, And her soul was soothed and sated With the welfare of the world. Ant. 1 But now, close-clad with peace, While war lays hand on Greece, The kingdoms and their kings stand by to see; “Aha, we are strong,” they say, “We are sure, we are well,” even they; “And if we serve, what ails ye to be free? We are warm, clothed round with peace and shame; But ye lie dead and naked, dying for a name.” Ant. 2 O kings and queens and nations miserable, O fools and blind, and full of sins and fears, With these it is, with you it is not well; Ye have one hour, but these the immortal years. These for a pang, a breath, a pulse of pain, Have honour, while that honour on earth shall be; Ye for a little sleep and sloth shall gain Scorn, while one man of all men born is free. Even as the depth more deep than night or day, The sovereign heaven that keeps its eldest way, So without chance or change, so without stain, The heaven of their high memories shall nor wax nor wane. Ant. 3 As the soul on the lips of the dead Stands poising her wings for flight, A bird scarce quit of her prison, But fair without form or flesh, So stands over each man's head A splendour of imminent light, A glory of fame rearisen, Of day rearisen afresh From the hells of night. In the hundred cities of Crete Such glory was not of old, Though her name was great upon earth And her face was fair on the sea. The words of her lips were sweet, Her days were woven with gold, Her fruits came timely to birth; So fair she was, being free, Who is bought and sold. So fair, who is fairer now With her children dead at her side, Unsceptred, unconsecrated, Unapparelled, unhelped, unpitied, With blood for gold on her brow, Where the towery tresses divide; The goodly, the golden-gated, Many-crowned, many-named, many-citied, Made like as a bride. And these are the bridegroom's gifts; Anguish that straitens the breath, Shame, and the weeping of mothers, And the suckling dead at the breast, White breast that a long sob lifts; And the dumb dead mouth, which saith, “How long, and how long, my brothers?” And wrath which endures not rest, And the pains of death. Ant. 4 Ah, but would that men, With eyelids purged by tears, Saw, and heard again With consecrated ears, All the clamour, all the splendour, all the slain, All the lights and sounds of war, the fates and fears; Saw far off aspire, With crash of mine and gate, From a single pyre The myriad flames of fate, Soul by soul transfigured in funereal fire, Hate made weak by love, and love made strong by hate. Children without speech, And many a nursing breast; Old men in the breach, Where death sat down a guest; With triumphant lamentation made for each, Let the world salute their ruin and their rest. In one iron hour The crescent flared and waned, As from tower to tower, Fire-scathed and sanguine-stained, Death, with flame in hand, an open bloodred flower, Passed, and where it bloomed no bloom of life remained. Ant. 5 Hear, thou earth, the heavy-hearted Weary nurse of waning races; From the dust of years departed, From obscure funereal places, Raise again thy sacred head, Lift the light up of thine eyes; Where are they of all thy dead That did more than these men dying In their godlike Grecian wise? Not with garments rent and sighing, Neither gifts of myrrh and gold, Shall their sons lament them lying, Lest the fame of them wax cold; But with lives to lives replying, And a worship from of old. Epode O sombre heart of earth and swoln with grief, That in thy time wast as a bird for mirth, Dim womb of life and many a seed and sheaf, And full of changes, ancient heart of earth, From grain and flower, from grass and every leaf, Thy mysteries and thy multitudes of birth, From hollow and hill, from vales and all thy springs, From all shapes born and breath of all lips made, From thunders, and the sound of winds and wings, From light, and from the solemn sleep of shade, From the full fountains of all living things, Speak, that this plague be stayed. Bear witness all the ways of death and life If thou be with us in the world's old strife, If thou be mother indeed, And from these wounds that bleed Gather in thy great breast the dews that fall, And on thy sacred knees Lull with mute melodies, Mother, thy sleeping sons in death's dim hall. For these thy sons, behold, Sons of thy sons of old, Bear witness if these be not as they were; If that high name of Greece Depart, dissolve, decease From mouths of men and memories like as air. By the last milk that drips Dead on the child's dead lips, By old men's white unviolated hair, By sweet unburied faces That fill those red high places Where death and freedom found one lion's lair, By all the bloodred tears That fill the chaliced years, The vessels of the sacrament of time, Wherewith, O thou most holy, O Freedom, sure and slowly Thy ministrant white hands cleanse earth of crime; Though we stand off afar Where slaves and slaveries are, Among the chains and crowns of poisonous peace; Though not the beams that shone From rent Arcadion Can melt her mists and bid her snows decrease; Do thou with sudden wings Darken the face of kings, But turn again the beauty of thy brows on Greece; Thy white and woundless brows, Whereto her great heart bows; Give her the glories of thine eyes to see; Turn thee, O holiest head, Toward all thy quick and dead, For love's sake of the souls that cry for thee; O love, O light, O flame, By thine own Grecian name, We call thee and we charge thee that all these be free. Jan. 1867. “NON DOLET” It does not hurt. She looked along the knife Smiling, and watched the thick drops mix and run Down the sheer blade; not that which had been done Could hurt the sweet sense of the Roman wife, But that which was to do yet ere the strife Could end for each for ever, and the sun: Nor was the palm yet nor was peace yet won While pain had power upon her husband's life. It does not hurt, Italia. Thou art more Than bride to bridegroom; how shalt thou not take The gift love's blood has reddened for thy sake? Was not thy lifeblood given for us before? And if love's heartblood can avail thy need, And thou not die, how should it hurt indeed? EURYDICE TO VICTOR HUGO Orpheus, the night is full of tears and cries, And hardly for the storm and ruin shed Can even thine eyes be certain of her head Who never passed out of thy spirit's eyes, But stood and shone before them in such wise As when with love her lips and hands were fed, And with mute mouth out of the dusty dead Strove to make answer when thou bad'st her rise. Yet viper-stricken must her lifeblood feel The fang that stung her sleeping, the foul germ Even when she wakes of hell's most poisonous worm, Though now it writhe beneath her wounded heel. Turn yet, she will not fade nor fly from thee; Wait, and see hell yield up Eurydice. AN APPEAL I Art thou indeed among these, Thou of the tyrannous crew, The kingdoms fed upon blood, O queen from of old of the seas, England, art thou of them too That drink of the poisonous flood, That hide under poisonous trees? II Nay, thy name from of old, Mother, was pure, or we dreamed Purer we held thee than this, Purer fain would we hold; So goodly a glory it seemed, A fame so bounteous of bliss, So more precious than gold. III A praise so sweet in our ears, That thou in the tempest of things As a rock for a refuge shouldst stand, In the bloodred river of tears Poured forth for the triumph of kings; A safeguard, a sheltering land, In the thunder and torrent of years. IV Strangers came gladly to thee, Exiles, chosen of men, Safe for thy sake in thy shade, Sat down at thy feet and were free. So men spake of thee then; Now shall their speaking be stayed? Ah, so let it not be! V Not for revenge or affright, Pride, or a tyrannous lust, Cast from thee the crown of thy praise. Mercy was thine in thy might; Strong when thou wert, thou wert just; Now, in the wrong-doing days, Cleave thou, thou at least, to the right. VI How should one charge thee, how sway, Save by the memories that were? Not thy gold nor the strength of thy ships, Nor the might of thine armies at bay, Made thee, mother, most fair; But a word from republican lips Said in thy name in thy day. VII Hast thou said it, and hast thou forgot? Is thy praise in thine ears as a scoff? Blood of men guiltless was shed, Children, and souls without spot, Shed, but in places far off; Let slaughter no more be, said Milton; and slaughter was not. VIII Was it not said of thee too, Now, but now, by thy foes, By the slaves that had slain their France, And thee would slay as they slew— “Down with her walls that enclose Freemen that eye us askance, Fugitives, men that are true!” IX This was thy praise or thy blame From bondsman or freeman—to be Pure from pollution of slaves, Clean of their sins, and thy name Bloodless, innocent, free; Now if thou be not, thy waves Wash not from off thee thy shame. X Freeman he is not, but slave, Whoso in fear for the State Cries for surety of blood, Help of gibbet and grave; Neither is any land great Whom, in her fear-stricken mood, These things only can save. XI Lo, how fair from afar, Taintless of tyranny, stands Thy mighty daughter, for years Who trod the winepress of war; Shines with immaculate hands; Slays not a foe, neither fears; Stains not peace with a scar. XII Be not as tyrant or slave, England; be not as these, Thou that wert other than they. Stretch out thine hand, but to save; Put forth thy strength, and release; Lest there arise, if thou slay, Thy shame as a ghost from the grave. November 20, 1867. PERINDE AC CADAVER In a vision Liberty stood By the childless charm-stricken bed Where, barren of glory and good, Knowing nought if she would not or would, England slept with her dead. Her face that the foam had whitened, Her hands that were strong to strive, Her eyes whence battle had lightened, Over all was a drawn shroud tightened To bind her asleep and alive. She turned and laughed in her dream With grey lips arid and cold; She saw not the face as a beam Burn on her, but only a gleam Through her sleep as of new-stamped gold. But the goddess, with terrible tears In the light of her down-drawn eyes, Spake fire in the dull sealed ears; “Thou, sick with slumbers and fears, Wilt thou sleep now indeed or arise? “With dreams and with words and with light Memories and empty desires Thou hast wrapped thyself round all night; Thou hast shut up thine heart from the right, And warmed thee at burnt-out fires. “Yet once if I smote at thy gate, Thy sons would sleep not, but heard; O thou that wast found so great, Art thou smitten with folly or fate That thy sons have forgotten my word? “O Cromwell's mother, O breast That suckled Milton! thy name That was beautiful then, that was blest, Is it wholly discrowned and deprest, Trodden under by sloth into shame? “Why wilt thou hate me and die? For none can hate me and live. What ill have I done to thee? why Wilt thou turn from me fighting, and fly, Who would follow thy feet and forgive? “Thou hast seen me stricken, and said, What is it to me? I am strong: Thou hast seen me bowed down on my dead And laughed and lifted thine head, And washed thine hands of my wrong. “Thou hast put out the soul of thy sight; Thou hast sought to my foemen as friend, To my traitors that kiss me and smite, To the kingdoms and empires of night That begin with the darkness, and end. “Turn thee, awaken, arise, With the light that is risen on the lands, With the change of the fresh-coloured skies; Set thine eyes on mine eyes, Lay thy hands in my hands.” She moved and mourned as she heard, Sighed and shifted her place, As the wells of her slumber were stirred By the music and wind of the word, Then turned and covered her face. “Ah,” she said in her sleep, “Is my work not done with and done? Is there corn for my sickle to reap? And strange is the pathway, and steep, And sharp overhead is the sun. “I have done thee service enough, Loved thee enough in my day; Now nor hatred nor love Nor hardly remembrance thereof Lives in me to lighten my way. “And is it not well with us here? Is change as good as is rest? What hope should move me, or fear, That eye should open or ear, Who have long since won what is best? “Where among us are such things As turn men's hearts into hell? Have we not queens without stings, Scotched princes, and fangless kings? Yea,” she said, “we are well. “We have filed the teeth of the snake Monarchy, how should it bite? Should the slippery slow thing wake, It will not sting for my sake; Yea,” she said, “I do right.” So spake she, drunken with dreams, Mad; but again in her ears A voice as of storm-swelled streams Spake; “No brave shame then redeems Thy lusts of sloth and thy fears? “Thy poor lie slain of thine hands, Their starved limbs rot in thy sight; As a shadow the ghost of thee stands Among men living and lands, And stirs not leftward or right. “Freeman he is not, but slave, Who stands not out on my side; His own hand hollows his grave, Nor strength is in me to save Where strength is none to abide. “Time shall tread on his name That was written for honour of old, Who hath taken in change for fame Dust, and silver, and shame, Ashes, and iron, and gold.” MONOTONES Because there is but one truth; Because there is but one banner; Because there is but one light; Because we have with us our youth Once, and one chance and one manner Of service, and then the night; Because we have found not yet Any way for the world to follow Save only that ancient way; Whosoever forsake or forget, Whose faith soever be hollow, Whose hope soever grow grey; Because of the watchwords of kings That are many and strange and unwritten, Diverse, and our watchword is one; Therefore, though seven be the strings, One string, if the harp be smitten, Sole sounds, till the tune be done; Sounds without cadence or change In a weary monotonous burden, Be the keynote of mourning or mirth; Free, but free not to range; Taking for crown and for guerdon No man's praise upon earth; Saying one sole word evermore, In the ears of the charmed world saying, Charmed by spells to its death; One that chanted of yore To a tune of the sword-sweep's playing In the lips of the dead blew breath; Therefore I set not mine hand To the shifting of changed modulations, To the smiting of manifold strings; While the thrones of the throned men stand, One song for the morning of nations, One for the twilight of kings. One chord, one word, and one way, One hope as our law, one heaven, Till slain be the great one wrong; Till the people it could not slay, Risen up, have for one star seven, For a single, a sevenfold song. THE OBLATION Ask nothing more of me, sweet; All I can give you I give. Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your feet: Love that should help you to live, Song that should spur you to soar. All things were nothing to give Once to have sense of you more, Touch you and taste of you sweet, Think you and breathe you and live, Swept of your wings as they soar, Trodden by chance of your feet. I that have love and no more Give you but love of you, sweet: He that hath more, let him give; He that hath wings, let him soar; Mine is the heart at your feet Here, that must love you to live. A YEAR'S BURDEN 1870 Fire and wild light of hope and doubt and fear, Wind of swift change, and clouds and hours that veer As the storm shifts of the tempestuous year; Cry wellaway, but well befall the right. Hope sits yet hiding her war-wearied eyes, Doubt sets her forehead earthward and denies, But fear brought hand to hand with danger dies, Dies and is burnt up in the fire of fight. Hearts bruised with loss and eaten through with shame Turn at the time's touch to devouring flame; Grief stands as one that knows not her own name, Nor if the star she sees bring day or night. No song breaks with it on the violent air, But shrieks of shame, defeat, and brute despair; Yet something at the star's heart far up there Burns as a beacon in our shipwrecked sight. O strange fierce light of presage, unknown star, Whose tongue shall tell us what thy secrets are, What message trembles in thee from so far? Cry wellaway, but well befall the right. From shores laid waste across an iron sea Where the waifs drift of hopes that were to be, Aross the red rolled foam we look for thee, Across the fire we look up for the light. From days laid waste across disastrous years, From hopes cut down across a world of fears, We gaze with eyes too passionate for tears, Where faith abides though hope be put to flight. Old hope is dead, the grey-haired hope grown blind That talked with us of old things out of mind, Dreams, deeds and men the world has left behind; Yet, though hope die, faith lives in hope's despite. Ay, with hearts fixed on death and hopeless hands We stand about our banner while it stands Above but one field of the ruined lands; Cry wellaway, but well befall the right. Though France were given for prey to bird and beast, Though Rome were rent in twain of king and priest, The soul of man, the soul is safe at least That gives death life and dead men hands to smite. Are ye so strong, O kings, O strong men? Nay, Waste all ye will and gather all ye may, Yet one thing is there that ye shall not slay, Even thought, that fire nor iron can affright. The woundless and invisible thought that goes Free throughout time as north or south wind blows, Far throughout space as east or west sea flows, And all dark things before it are made bright. Thy thought, thy word, O soul republican, O spirit of life, O God whose name is man: What sea of sorrows but thy sight shall span? Cry wellaway, but well befall the right. With all its coils crushed, all its rings uncurled, The one most poisonous worm that soiled the world Is wrenched from off the throat of man, and hurled Into deep hell from empire's helpless height. Time takes no more infection of it now; Like a dead snake divided of the plough, The rotten thing lies cut in twain; but thou, Thy fires shall heal us of the serpent's bite. Ay, with red cautery and a burning brand Purge thou the leprous leaven of the land; Take to thee fire, and iron in thine hand, Till blood and tears have washed the soiled limbs white. We have sinned against thee in dreams and wicked sleep; Smite, we will shrink not; strike, we will not weep; Let the heart feel thee; let thy wound go deep; Cry wellaway, but well befall the right. Wound us with love, pierce us with longing, make Our souls thy sacrifices; turn and take Our hearts for our sin-offerings lest they break, And mould them with thine hands and give them might. Then, when the cup of ills is drained indeed, Will we come to thee with our wounds that bleed, With famished mouths and hearts that thou shalt feed, And see thee worshipped as the world's delight. There shall be no more wars nor kingdoms won, But in thy sight whose eyes are as the sun All names shall be one name, all nations one, All souls of men in man's one soul unite. O sea whereon men labour, O great sea That heaven seems one with, shall these things not be? O earth, our earth, shall time not make us free? Cry wellaway, but well befall the right. EPILOGUE [Between the wave-ridge and the strand] Between the wave-ridge and the strand I let you forth in sight of land, Songs that with storm-crossed wings and eyes Strain eastward till the darkness dies; Let signs and beacons fall or stand, And stars and balefires set and rise; Ye, till some lordlier lyric hand Weave the beloved brows their crown, At the beloved feet lie down. O, whatsoever of life or light Love hath to give you, what of might Or heart or hope is yours to live, I charge you take in trust to give For very love's sake, in whose sight, Through poise of hours alternative And seasons plumed with light or night, Ye live and move and have your breath To sing with on the ridge of death. I charge you faint not all night through For love's sake that was breathed on you To be to you as wings and feet For travel, and as blood to heat And sense of spirit to renew And bloom of fragrance to keep sweet And fire of purpose to keep true The life, if life in such things be, That I would give you forth of me. Out where the breath of war may bear, Out in the rank moist reddened air That sounds and smells of death, and hath No light but death's upon its path Seen through the black wind's tangled hair, I send you past the wild time's wrath To find his face who bade you bear Fruit of his seed to faith and love, That he may take the heart thereof. By day or night, by sea or street, Fly till ye find and clasp his feet And kiss as worshippers who bring Too much love on their lips to sing, But with hushed heads accept and greet The presence of some heavenlier thing In the near air; so may ye meet His eyes, and droop not utterly For shame's sake at the light you see. Not utterly struck spiritless For shame's sake and unworthiness Of these poor forceless hands that come Empty, these lips that should be dumb, This love whose seal can but impress These weak word-offerings wearisome Whose blessings have not strength to bless Nor lightnings fire to burn up aught Nor smite with thunders of their thought. One thought they have, even love; one light, Truth, that keeps clear the sun by night; One chord, of faith as of a lyre; One heat, of hope as of a fire; One heart, one music, and one might, One flame, one altar, and one choir; And one man's living head in sight Who said, when all time's sea was foam, “Let there be Rome”—and there was Rome. As a star set in space for token Like a live word of God's mouth spoken, Visible sound, light audible, In the great darkness thick as hell A stanchless flame of love unsloken, A sign to conquer and compel, A law to stand in heaven unbroken Whereby the sun shines, and wherethrough Time's eldest empires are made new; So rose up on our generations That light of the most ancient nations, Law, life, and light, on the world's way, The very God of very day, The sun-god; from their star-like stations Far down the night in disarray Fled, crowned with fires of tribulations, The suns of sunless years, whose light And life and law were of the night. The naked kingdoms quenched and stark Drave with their dead things down the dark, Helmless; their whole world, throne by throne, Fell, and its whole heart turned to stone, Hopeless; their hands that touched our ark Withered; and lo, aloft, alone, On time's white waters man's one bark, Where the red sundawn's open eye Lit the soft gulf of low green sky. So for a season piloted It sailed the sunlight, and struck red With fire of dawn reverberate The wan face of incumbent fate That paused half pitying overhead And almost had foregone the freight Of those dark hours the next day bred For shame, and almost had forsworn Service of night for love of morn. Then broke the whole night in one blow, Thundering; then all hell with one throe Heaved, and brought forth beneath the stroke Death; and all dead things moved and woke That the dawn's arrows had brought low, At the great sound of night that broke Thundering, and all the old world-wide woe; And under night's loud-sounding dome Men sought her, and she was not Rome. Still with blind hands and robes blood-wet Night hangs on heaven, reluctant yet, With black blood dripping from her eyes ??? ??????? ????????? ???? ????????. Æsch. Cho. 1058. On the soiled lintels of the skies, With brows and lips that thirst and threat, Heart-sick with fear lest the sun rise, And aching with her fires that set, And shuddering ere dawn bursts her bars, Burns out with all her beaten stars. In this black wind of war they fly Now, ere that hour be in the sky That brings back hope, and memory back, And light and law to lands that lack; That spiritual sweet hour whereby The bloody-handed night and black Shall be cast out of heaven to die; Kingdom by kingdom, crown by crown, The fires of darkness are blown down. Yet heavy, grievous yet the weight Sits on us of imperfect fate. From wounds of other days and deeds Still this day's breathing body bleeds; Still kings for fear and slaves for hate Sow lives of men on earth like seeds In the red soil they saturate; And we, with faces eastward set, Stand sightless of the morning yet. And many for pure sorrow's sake Look back and stretch back hands to take Gifts of night's giving, ease and sleep, Flowers of night's grafting, strong to steep The soul in dreams it will not break, Songs of soft hours that sigh and sweep Its lifted eyelids nigh to wake With subtle plumes and lulling breath That soothe its weariness to death. And many, called of hope and pride, Fall ere the sunrise from our side. Fresh lights and rumours of fresh fames That shift and veer by night like flames, Shouts and blown trumpets, ghosts that glide Calling, and hail them by dead names, Fears, angers, memories, dreams divide Spirit from spirit, and wear out Strong hearts of men with hope and doubt. Till time beget and sorrow bear The soul-sick eyeless child despair, That comes among us, mad and blind, With counsels of a broken mind, Tales of times dead and woes that were, And, prophesying against mankind, Shakes out the horror of her hair To take the sunlight with its coils And hold the living soul in toils. By many ways of death and moods Souls pass into their servitudes. Their young wings weaken, plume by plume Drops, and their eyelids gather gloom And close against man's frauds and feuds, And their tongues call they know not whom To help in their vicissitudes; For many slaveries are, but one Liberty, single as the sun. One light, one law, that burns up strife, And one sufficiency of life. Self-stablished, the sufficing soul Hears the loud wheels of changes roll, Sees against man man bare the knife, Sees the world severed, and is whole; Sees force take dowerless fraud to wife, And fear from fraud's incestuous bed Crawl forth and smite his father dead: Sees death made drunk with war, sees time Weave many-coloured crime with crime, State overthrown on ruining state, And dares not be disconsolate. Only the soul hath feet to climb, Only the soul hath room to wait, Hath brows and eyes to hold sublime Above all evil and all good, All strength and all decrepitude. She only, she since earth began, The many-minded soul of man, From one incognizable root That bears such divers-coloured fruit, Hath ruled for blessing or for ban The flight of seasons and pursuit; She regent, she republican, With wide and equal eyes and wings Broods on things born and dying things. Even now for love or doubt of us The hour intense and hazardous Hangs high with pinions vibrating Whereto the light and darkness cling, Dividing the dim season thus, And shakes from one ambiguous wing Shadow, and one is luminous, And day falls from it; so the past Torments the future to the last. And we that cannot hear or see The sounds and lights of liberty, The witness of the naked God That treads on burning hours unshod With instant feet unwounded; we That can trace only where he trod By fire in heaven or storm at sea, Not know the very present whole And naked nature of the soul; We that see wars and woes and kings, And portents of enormous things, Empires, and agonies, and slaves, And whole flame of town-swallowing graves; That hear the harsh hours clap sharp wings Above the roar of ranks like waves, From wreck to wreck as the world swings; Know but that men there are who see And hear things other far than we. By the light sitting on their brows, The fire wherewith their presence glows, The music falling with their feet, The sweet sense of a spirit sweet That with their speech or motion grows And breathes and burns men's hearts with heat; By these signs there is none but knows Men who have life and grace to give, Men who have seen the soul and live. By the strength sleeping in their eyes, The lips whereon their sorrow lies Smiling, the lines of tears unshed, The large divine look of one dead That speaks out of the breathless skies In silence, when the light is shed Upon man's soul of memories; The supreme look that sets love free, The look of stars and of the sea; By the strong patient godhead seen Implicit in their mortal mien, The conscience of a God held still And thunders ruled by their own will And fast-bound fires that might burn clean This worldly air that foul things fill, And the afterglow of what has been, That, passing, shows us without word What they have seen, what they have heard; By all these keen and burning signs The spirit knows them and divines. In bonds, in banishment, in grief, Scoffed at and scourged with unbelief, Foiled with false trusts and thwart designs, Stripped of green days and hopes in leaf, Their mere bare body of glory shines Higher, and man gazing surelier sees What light, what comfort is of these. So I now gazing; till the sense Being set on fire of confidence Strains itself sunward, feels out far Beyond the bright and morning star, Beyond the extreme wave's refluence, To where the fierce first sunbeams are Whose fire intolerant and intense As birthpangs whence day burns to be Parts breathless heaven from breathing sea. I see not, know not, and am blest, Master, who know that thou knowest, Dear lord and leader, at whose hand The first days and the last days stand, With scars and crowns on head and breast, That fought for love of the sweet land Or shall fight in her latter quest; All the days armed and girt and crowned Whose glories ring thy glory round. Thou sawest, when all the world was blind, The light that should be of mankind, The very day that was to be; And how shalt thou not sometime see Thy city perfect to thy mind Stand face to living face with thee, And no miscrowned man's head behind; The hearth of man, the human home, The central flame that shall be Rome? As one that ere a June day rise Makes seaward for the dawn, and tries The water with delighted limbs That taste the sweet dark sea, and swims Right eastward under strengthening skies, And sees the gradual rippling rims Of waves whence day breaks blossom-wise Take fire ere light peer well above, And laughs from all his heart with love; And softlier swimming with raised head Feels the full flower of morning shed And fluent sunrise round him rolled That laps and laves his body bold With fluctuant heaven in water's stead, And urgent through the growing gold Strikes, and sees all the spray flash red, And his soul takes the sun, and yearns For joy wherewith the sea's heart burns; So the soul seeking through the dark Heavenward, a dove without an ark, Transcends the unnavigable sea Of years that wear out memory; So calls, a sunward-singing lark, In the ear of souls that should be free; So points them toward the sun for mark Who steer not for the stress of waves, And seek strange helmsmen, and are slaves. For if the swimmer's eastward eye Must see no sunrise—must put by The hope that lifted him and led Once, to have light about his head, To see beneath the clear low sky The green foam-whitened wave wax red And all the morning's banner fly— Then, as earth's helpless hopes go down, Let earth's self in the dark tides drown. Yea, if no morning must behold Man, other than were they now cold, And other deeds than past deeds done, Nor any near or far-off sun Salute him risen and sunlike-souled, Free, boundless, fearless, perfect, one, Let man's world die like worlds of old, And here in heaven's sight only be The sole sun on the worldless sea. SONGS OF TWO NATIONS [I saw the double-featured statue stand] I saw the double-featured statue stand Of Memnon or of Janus, half with night Veiled, and fast bound with iron; half with light Crowned, holding all men's future in his hand. And all the old westward face of time grown grey Was writ with cursing and inscribed for death; But on the face that met the morning's breath Fear died of hope as darkness dies of day. A SONG OF ITALY INSCRIBED WITH ALL DEVOTION AND REVERENCE TO JOSEPH MAZZINI 1867 Upon a windy night of stars that fell At the wind's spoken spell, Swept with sharp strokes of agonizing light From the clear gulf of night, Between the fixed and fallen glories one Against my vision shone, More fair and fearful and divine than they That measure night and day, And worthier worship; and within mine eyes The formless folded skies Took shape and were unfolded like as flowers. And I beheld the hours As maidens, and the days as labouring men, And the soft nights again As wearied women to their own souls wed, And ages as the dead. And over these living, and them that died, From one to the other side A lordlier light than comes of earth or air Made the world's future fair. A woman like to love in face, but not A thing of transient lot— And like to hope, but having hold on truth— And like to joy or youth, Save that upon the rock her feet were set— And like what men forget, Faith, innocence, high thought, laborious peace— And yet like none of these, Being not as these are mortal, but with eyes That sounded the deep skies And clove like wings or arrows their clear way Through night and dawn and day— So fair a presence over star and sun Stood, making these as one. For in the shadow of her shape were all Darkened and held in thrall, So mightier rose she past them; and I felt Whose form, whose likeness knelt With covered hair and face and clasped her knees; And knew the first of these Was Freedom, and the second Italy. And what sad words said she For mine own grief I knew not, nor had heart Therewith to bear my part And set my songs to sorrow; nor to hear How tear by sacred tear Fell from her eyes as flowers or notes that fall In some slain feaster's hall Where in mid music and melodious breath Men singing have seen death. So fair, so lost, so sweet she knelt; or so In our lost eyes below Seemed to us sorrowing; and her speech being said, Fell, as one who falls dead. And for a little she too wept, who stood Above the dust and blood And thrones and troubles of the world; then spake, As who bids dead men wake. “Because the years were heavy on thy head; Because dead things are dead; Because thy chosen on hill-side, city and plain Are shed as drops of rain; Because all earth was black, all heaven was blind, And we cast out of mind; Because men wept, saying Freedom, knowing of thee, Child, that thou wast not free; Because wherever blood was not shame was Where thy pure foot did pass; Because on Promethean rocks distent Thee fouler eagles rent; Because a serpent stains with slime and foam This that is not thy Rome; Child of my womb, whose limbs were made in me, Have I forgotten thee? In all thy dreams through all these years on wing, Hast thou dreamed such a thing? The mortal mother-bird outsoars her nest, The child outgrows the breast; But suns as stars shall fall from heaven and cease, Ere we twain be as these; Yea, utmost skies forget their utmost sun, Ere we twain be not one. My lesser jewels sewn on skirt and hem, I have no heed of them Obscured and flawed by sloth or craft or power; But thou, that wast my flower, The blossom bound between my brows and worn In sight of even and morn From the last ember of the flameless west To the dawn's baring breast— I were not Freedom if thou wert not free, Nor thou wert Italy. O mystic rose ingrained with blood, impearled With tears of all the world! The torpor of their blind brute-ridden trance Kills England and chills France; And Spain sobs hard through strangling blood; and snows Hide the huge eastern woes. But thou, twin-born with morning, nursed of noon, And blessed of star and moon! What shall avail to assail thee any more, From sacred shore to shore? Have Time and Love not knelt down at thy feet, Thy sore, thy soiled, thy sweet, Fresh from the flints and mire of murderous ways And dust of travelling days? Hath Time not kissed them, Love not washed them fair, And wiped with tears and hair? Though God forget thee, I will not forget; Though heaven and earth be set Against thee, O unconquerable child, Abused, abased, reviled, Lift thou not less from no funereal bed Thine undishonoured head; Love thou not less, by lips of thine once prest, This my now barren breast; Seek thou not less, being well assured thereof, O child, my latest love. For now the barren bosom shall bear fruit, Songs leap from lips long mute, And with my milk the mouths of nations fed Again be glad and red That were worn white with hunger and sorrow and thirst; And thou, most fair and first, Thou whose warm hands and sweet live lips I feel Upon me for a seal, Thou whose least looks, whose smiles and little sighs, Whose passionate pure eyes, Whose dear fair limbs that neither bonds could bruise Nor hate of men misuse, Whose flower-like breath and bosom, O my child, O mine and undefiled, Fill with such tears as burn like bitter wine These mother's eyes of mine, Thrill with huge passions and primeval pains The fullness of my veins, O sweetest head seen higher than any stands, I touch thee with mine hands, I lay my lips upon thee, O thou most sweet, To lift thee on thy feet And with the fire of mine to fill thine eyes; I say unto thee, Arise.” She ceased, and heaven was full of flame and sound, And earth's old limbs unbound Shone and waxed warm with fiery dew and seed Shed through her at this her need: And highest in heaven, a mother and full of grace, With no more covered face, With no more lifted hands and bended knees, Rose, as from sacred seas Love, when old time was full of plenteous springs, That fairest-born of things, The land that holds the rest in tender thrall For love's sake in them all, That binds with words and holds with eyes and hands All hearts in all men's lands. So died the dream whence rose the live desire That here takes form and fire, A spirit from the splendid grave of sleep Risen, that ye should not weep, Should not weep more nor ever, O ye that hear And ever have held her dear, Seeing now indeed she weeps not who wept sore, And sleeps not any more. Hearken ye towards her, O people, exalt your eyes; Is this a thing that dies? Italia! by the passion of the pain That bent and rent thy chain; Italia! by the breaking of the bands, The shaking of the lands; Beloved, O men's mother, O men's queen, Arise, appear, be seen! Arise, array thyself in manifold Queen's raiment of wrought gold; With girdles of green freedom, and with red Roses, and white snow shed Above the flush and frondage of the hills That all thy deep dawn fills And all thy clear night veils and warms with wings Spread till the morning sings; The rose of resurrection, and the bright Breast lavish of the light, The lady lily like the snowy sky Ere the stars wholly die; As red as blood, and whiter than a wave, Flowers grown as from thy grave, From the green fruitful grass in Maytime hot, Thy grave, where thou art not. Gather the grass and weave, in sacred sign Of the ancient earth divine, The holy heart of things, the seed of birth, The mystical warm earth. O thou her flower of flowers, with treble braid Be thy sweet head arrayed, In witness of her mighty motherhood Who bore thee and found thee good, Her fairest-born of children, on whose head Her green and white and red Are hope and light and life, inviolate Of any latter fate. Fly, O our flag, through deep Italian air, Above the flags that were, The dusty shreds of shameful battle-flags Trampled and rent in rags, As withering woods in autumn's bitterest breath Yellow, and black as death; Black as crushed worms that sicken in the sense, And yellow as pestilence. Fly, green as summer and red as dawn and white As the live heart of light, The blind bright womb of colour unborn, that brings Forth all fair forms of things, As freedom all fair forms of nations dyed In divers-coloured pride. Fly fleet as wind on every wind that blows Between her seas and snows, From Alpine white, from Tuscan green, and where Vesuvius reddens air. Fly! and let all men see it, and all kings wail, And priests wax faint and pale, And the cold hordes that moan in misty places And the funereal races And the sick serfs of lands that wait and wane See thee and hate thee in vain. In the clear laughter of all winds and waves, In the blown grass of graves, In the long sound of fluctuant boughs of trees, In the broad breath of seas, Bid the sound of thy flying folds be heard; And as a spoken word Full of that fair god and that merciless Who rends the Pythoness, So be the sound and so the fire that saith She feels her ancient breath And the old blood move in her immortal veins. Strange travail and strong pains, Our mother, hast thou borne these many years While thy pure blood and tears Mixed with the Tyrrhene and the Adrian sea; Light things were said of thee, As of one buried deep among the dead; Yea, she hath been, they said, She was when time was younger, and is not; The very cerecloths rot That flutter in the dusty wind of death, Not moving with her breath; Far seasons and forgotten years enfold Her dead corpse old and cold With many windy winters and pale springs: She is none of this world's things. Though her dead head like a live garland wear The golden-growing hair That flows over her breast down to her feet, Dead queens, whose life was sweet In sight of all men living, have been found So cold, so clad, so crowned, With all things faded and with one thing fair, Their old immortal hair, When flesh and bone turned dust at touch of day: And she is dead as they. So men said sadly, mocking; so the slave, Whose life was his soul's grave; So, pale or red with change of fast and feast, The sanguine-sandalled priest; So the Austrian, when his fortune came to flood, And the warm wave was blood; With wings that widened and with beak that smote, So shrieked through either throat From the hot horror of its northern nest That double-headed pest; So, triple-crowned with fear and fraud and shame, He of whom treason came, The herdsman of the Gadarean swine; So all his ravening kine, Made fat with poisonous pasture; so not we, Mother, beholding thee. Make answer, O the crown of all our slain, Ye that were one, being twain, Twain brethren, twin-born to the second birth, Chosen out of all our earth To be the prophesying stars that say How hard is night on day, Stars in serene and sudden heaven rerisen Before the sun break prison And ere the moon be wasted; fair first flowers In that red wreath of ours Woven with the lives of all whose lives were shed To crown their mother's head With leaves of civic cypress and thick yew, Till the olive bind it too, Olive and laurel and all loftier leaves That victory wears or weaves At her fair feet for her beloved brow; Hear, for she too hears now, O Pisacane, from Calabrian sands; O all heroic hands Close on the sword-hilt, hands of all her dead; O many a holy head, Bowed for her sake even to her reddening dust; O chosen, O pure and just, Who counted for a small thing life's estate, And died, and made it great; Ye whose names mix with all her memories; ye Who rather chose to see Death, than our more intolerable things; Thou whose name withers kings, Agesilao; thou too, O chiefliest thou, The slayer of splendid brow, Laid where the lying lips of fear deride The foiled tyrannicide, Foiled, fallen, slain, scorned, and happy; being in fame, Felice, like thy name, Not like thy fortune; father of the fight, Having in hand our light. Ah, happy! for that sudden-swerving hand Flung light on all thy land, Yea, lit blind France with compulsory ray, Driven down a righteous way; Ah, happiest! for from thee the wars began, From thee the fresh springs ran; From thee the lady land that queens the earth Gat as she gave new birth. O sweet mute mouths, O all fair dead of ours, Fair in her eyes as flowers, Fair without feature, vocal without voice, Strong without strength, rejoice! Hear it with ears that hear not, and on eyes That see not let it rise, Rise as a sundawn; be it as dew that drips On dumb and dusty lips; Eyes have ye not, and see it; neither ears, And there is none but hears. This is the same for whom ye bled and wept; She was not dead, but slept. This is that very Italy which was And is and shall not pass. But thou, though all were not well done, O chief, Must thou take shame or grief? Because one man is not as thou or ten, Must thou take shame for men? Because the supreme sunrise is not yet, Is the young dew not wet? Wilt thou not yet abide a little while, Soul without fear or guile, Mazzini,—O our prophet, O our priest, A little while at least? A little hour of doubt and of control, Sustain thy sacred soul; Withhold thine heart, our father, but an hour; Is it not here, the flower, Is it not blown and fragrant from the root, And shall not be the fruit? Thy children, even thy people thou hast made, Thine, with thy words arrayed, Clothed with thy thoughts and girt with thy desires, Yearn up toward thee as fires. Art thou not father, O father, of all these? From thine own Genoese To where of nights the lower extreme lagune Feels its Venetian moon, Nor suckling's mouth nor mother's breast set free But hath that grace through thee. The milk of life on death's unnatural brink Thou gavest them to drink, The natural milk of freedom; and again They drank, and they were men. The wine and honey of freedom and of faith They drank, and cast off death. Bear with them now; thou art holier: yet endure, Till they as thou be pure. Their swords at least that stemmed half Austria's tide Bade all its bulk divide; Else, though fate bade them for a breath's space fall, She had not fallen at all. Not by their hands they made time's promise true; Not by their hands, but through. Nor on Custoza ran their blood to waste, Nor fell their fame defaced Whom stormiest Adria with tumultuous tides Whirls undersea and hides. Not his, who from the sudden-settling deck Looked over death and wreck To where the mother's bosom shone, who smiled As he, so dying, her child; For he smiled surely, dying, to mix his death With her memorial breath; Smiled, being most sure of her, that in no wise, Die whoso will, she dies: And she smiled surely, fair and far above, Wept not, but smiled for love. Thou too, O splendour of the sudden sword That drove the crews abhorred From Naples and the siren-footed strand, Flash from thy master's hand, Shine from the middle summer of the seas To the old Æolides, Outshine their fiery fumes of burning night, Sword, with thy midday light; Flame as a beacon from the Tyrrhene foam To the rent heart of Rome, From the island of her lover and thy lord, Her saviour and her sword. In the fierce year of failure and of fame, Art thou not yet the same That wast as lightning swifter than all wings In the blind face of kings? When priests took counsel to devise despair, And princes to forswear, She clasped thee, O her sword and flag-bearer And staff and shield to her, O Garibaldi; need was hers and grief, Of thee and of the chief, And of another girt in arms to stand As good of hope and hand, As high of soul and happy, albeit indeed The heart should burn and bleed, So but the spirit shake not nor the breast Swerve, but abide its rest. As theirs did and as thine, though ruin clomb The highest wall of Rome, Though treason stained and spilt her lustral water, And slaves led slaves to slaughter, And priests, praying and slaying, watched them pass From a strange France, alas, That was not freedom; yet when these were past Thy sword and thou stood fast, Till new men seeing thee where Sicilian waves Hear now no sound of slaves, And where thy sacred blood is fragrant still Upon the Bitter Hill, Seeing by that blood one country saved and stained, Less loved thee crowned than chained, And less now only than the chief: for he, Father of Italy, Upbore in holy hands the babe new-born Through loss and sorrow and scorn, Of no man led, of many men reviled; Till lo, the new-born child Gone from between his hands, and in its place, Lo, the fair mother's face. Blessed is he of all men, being in one As father to her and son, Blessed of all men living, that he found Her weak limbs bared and bound, And in his arms and in his bosom bore, And as a garment wore Her weight of want, and as a royal dress Put on her weariness. As in faith's hoariest histories men read, The strong man bore at need Through roaring rapids when all heaven was wild The likeness of a child That still waxed greater and heavier as he trod, And altered, and was God. Praise him, O winds that move the molten air, O light of days that were, And light of days that shall be; land and sea, And heaven and Italy: Praise him, O storm and summer, shore and wave, O skies and every grave; O weeping hopes, O memories beyond tears, O many and murmuring years, O sounds far off in time and visions far, O sorrow with thy star, And joy with all thy beacons; ye that mourn, And ye whose light is born; O fallen faces, and O souls arisen, Praise him from tomb and prison, Praise him from heaven and sunlight; and ye floods, And windy waves of woods; Ye valleys and wild vineyards, ye lit lakes And happier hillside brakes, Untrampled by the accursed feet that trod Fields golden from their god, Fields of their god forsaken, whereof none Sees his face in the sun, Hears his voice from the floweriest wildernesses; And, barren of his tresses, Ye bays unplucked and laurels unentwined, That no men break or bind, And myrtles long forgetful of the sword, And olives unadored, Wisdom and love, white hands that save and slay, Praise him; and ye as they, Praise him, O gracious might of dews and rains That feed the purple plains, O sacred sunbeams bright as bare steel drawn, O cloud and fire and dawn; Red hills of flame, white Alps, green Apennines, Banners of blowing pines, Standards of stormy snows, flags of light leaves, Three wherewith Freedom weaves One ensign that once woven and once unfurled Makes day of all a world, Makes blind their eyes who knew not, and outbraves The waste of iron waves; Ye fields of yellow fullness, ye fresh fountains, And mists of many mountains; Ye moons and seasons, and ye days and nights; Ye starry-headed heights, And gorges melting sunward from the snow, And all strong streams that flow, Tender as tears, and fair as faith, and pure As hearts made sad and sure At once by many sufferings and one love; O mystic deathless dove Held to the heart of earth and in her hands Cherished, O lily of lands, White rose of time, dear dream of praises past— For such as these thou wast, That art as eagles setting to the sun, As fawns that leap and run, As a sword carven with keen floral gold, Sword for an armed god's hold, Flower for a crowned god's forehead—O our land, Reach forth thine holiest hand, O mother of many sons and memories, Stretch out thine hand to his That raised and gave thee life to run and leap When thou wast full of sleep, That touched and stung thee with young blood and breath When thou wast hard on death. Praise him, O all her cities and her crowns, Her towers and thrones of towns; O noblest Brescia, scarred from foot to head And breast-deep in thy dead, Praise him from all the glories of thy graves That yellow Mela laves With gentle and golden water, whose fair flood Ran wider with thy blood: Praise him, O born of that heroic breast, O nursed thereat and blest, Verona, fairer than thy mother fair, But not more brave to bear: Praise him, O Milan, whose imperial tread Bruised once the German head; Whose might, by northern swords left desolate, Set foot on fear and fate: Praise him, O long mute mouth of melodies, Mantua, with louder keys, With mightier chords of music even than rolled From the large harps of old, When thy sweet singer of golden throat and tongue, Praising his tyrant, sung; Though now thou sing not as of other days, Learn late a better praise. Not with the sick sweet lips of slaves that sing, Praise thou no priest or king, No brow-bound laurel of discoloured leaf, But him, the crownless chief. Praise him, O star of sun-forgotten times, Among their creeds and crimes That wast a fire of witness in the night, Padua, the wise men's light: Praise him, O sacred Venice, and the sea That now exults through thee, Full of the mighty morning and the sun, Free of things dead and done; Praise him from all the years of thy great grief, That shook thee like a leaf With winds and snows of torment, rain that fell Red as the rains of hell, Storms of black thunder and of yellow flame, And all ill things but shame; Praise him with all thy holy heart and strength; Through thy walls' breadth and length Praise him with all thy people, that their voice Bid the strong soul rejoice, The fair clear supreme spirit beyond stain, Pure as the depth of pain, High as the head of suffering, and secure As all things that endure. More than thy blind lord of an hundred years Whose name our memory hears, Home-bound from harbours of the Byzantine Made tributary of thine, Praise him who gave no gifts from oversea, But gave thyself to thee. O mother Genoa, through all years that run, More than that other son, Who first beyond the seals of sunset prest Even to the unfooted west, Whose back-blown flag scared from their sheltering seas The unknown Atlantides, And as flame climbs through cloud and vapour clomb Through streams of storm and foam, Till half in sight they saw land heave and swim— More than this man praise him. One found a world new-born from virgin sea; And one found Italy. O heavenliest Florence, from the mouths of flowers Fed by melodious hours, From each sweet mouth that kisses light and air, Thou whom thy fate made fair, As a bound vine or any flowering tree, Praise him who made thee free. For no grape-gatherers trampling out the wine Tread thee, the fairest vine; For no man binds thee, no man bruises, none Does with thee as these have done. From where spring hears loud through her long lit vales Triumphant nightingales, In many a fold of fiery foliage hidden, Withheld as things forbidden, But clamorous with innumerable delight In May's red, green, and white, In the far-floated standard of the spring, That bids men also sing, Our flower of flags, our witness that we are free, Our lamp for land and sea; From where Majano feels through corn and vine Spring move and melt as wine, And Fiesole's embracing arms enclose The immeasurable rose; From hill-sides plumed with pine, and heights wind-worn That feel the refluent morn, Or where the moon's face warm and passionate Burns, and men's hearts grow great, And the swoln eyelids labour with sweet tears, And in their burning ears Sound throbs like flame, and in their eyes new light Kindles the trembling night; From faint illumined fields and starry valleys Wherefrom the hill-wind sallies, From Vallombrosa, from Valdarno raise One Tuscan tune of praise. O lordly city of the field of death, Praise him with equal breath, From sleeping streets and gardens, and the stream That threads them as a dream Threads without light the untravelled ways of sleep With eyes that smile or weep; From the sweet sombre beauty of wave and wall That fades and does not fall; From coloured domes and cloisters fair with fame, Praise thou and thine his name. Thou too, O little laurelled town of towers, Clothed with the flame of flowers, From windy ramparts girdled with young gold, From thy sweet hillside fold Of wallflowers and the acacia's belted bloom And every blowing plume, Halls that saw Dante speaking, chapels fair As the outer hills and air, Praise him who feeds the fire that Dante fed, Our highest heroic head, Whose eyes behold through floated cloud and flame The maiden face of fame Like April's in Valdelsa; fair as flowers, And patient as the hours; Sad with slow sense of time, and bright with faith That levels life and death; The final fame, that with a foot sublime Treads down reluctant time; The fame that waits and watches and is wise, A virgin with chaste eyes, A goddess who takes hands with great men's grief; Praise her, and him, our chief. Praise him, O Siena, and thou her deep green spring, O Fonte Branda, sing: Shout from the red clefts of thy fiery crags, Shake out thy flying flags In the long wind that streams from hill to hill; Bid thy full music fill The desolate red waste of sunset air And fields the old time saw fair, But now the hours ring void through ruined lands, Wild work of mortal hands; Yet through thy dead Maremma let his name Take flight and pass in flame, And the red ruin of disastrous hours Shall quicken into flowers. Praise him, O fiery child of sun and sea, Naples, who bade thee be; For till he sent the swords that scourge and save, Thou wast not, but thy grave. But more than all these praise him and give thanks, Thou, from thy Tiber's banks, From all thine hills and from thy supreme dome, Praise him, O risen Rome. Let all thy children cities at thy knee Lift up their voice with thee, Saying ‘for thy love's sake and our perished grief We laud thee, O our chief;’ Saying ‘for thine hand and help when hope was dead We thank thee, O our head;’ Saying ‘for thy voice and face within our sight We bless thee, O our light; For waters cleansing us from days defiled We praise thee, O our child.’ So with an hundred cities' mouths in one Praising thy supreme son, Son of thy sorrow, O mother, O maid and mother, Our queen, who serve none other, Our lady of pity and mercy, and full of grace, Turn otherwhere thy face, Turn for a little and look what things are these Now fallen before thy knees; Turn upon them thine eyes who hated thee, Behold what things they be, Italia: these are stubble that were steel, Dust, or a turning wheel; As leaves, as snow, as sand, that were so strong; And howl, for all their song, And wail, for all their wisdom; they that were So great, they are all stript bare, They are all made empty of beauty, and all abhorred; They are shivered, and their sword; They are slain who slew, they are heartless who were wise; Yea, turn on these thine eyes, O thou, soliciting with soul sublime The obscure soul of time, Thou, with the wounds thy holy body bears From broken swords of theirs, Thou, with the sweet swoln eyelids that have bled Tears for thy thousands dead, And upon these, whose swords drank up like dew The sons of thine they slew, These, whose each gun blasted with murdering mouth Live flowers of thy fair south, These, whose least evil told in alien ears Turned men's whole blood to tears, These, whose least sin remembered for pure shame Turned all those tears to flame, Even upon these, when breaks the extreme blow And all the world cries woe, When heaven reluctant rains long-suffering fire On these and their desire, When his wind shakes them and his waters whelm Who rent thy robe and realm, When they that poured thy dear blood forth as wine Pour forth their own for thine, On these, on these have mercy: not in hate, But full of sacred fate, Strong from the shrine and splendid from the god, Smite, with no second rod. Because they spared not, do thou rather spare: Be not one thing they were. Let not one tongue of theirs who hate thee say That thou wast even as they. Because their hands were bloody, be thine white; Show light where they shed night: Because they are foul, be thou the rather pure; Because they are feeble, endure; Because they had no pity, have thou pity. And thou, O supreme city, O priestless Rome that shalt be, take in trust Their names, their deeds, their dust, Who held life less than thou wert; be the least To thee indeed a priest, Priest and burnt-offering and blood-sacrifice Given without prayer or price, A holier immolation than men wist, A costlier eucharist, A sacrament more saving; bend thine head Above these many dead Once, and salute with thine eternal eyes Their lowest head that lies. Speak from thy lips of immemorial speech If but one word for each. Kiss but one kiss on each thy dead son's mouth Fallen dumb or north or south. And laying but once thine hand on brow and breast, Bless them, through whom thou art blest. And saying in ears of these thy dead, “Well done,” Shall they not hear “O son”? And bowing thy face to theirs made pale for thee, Shall the shut eyes not see? Yea, through the hollow-hearted world of death, As light, as blood, as breath, Shall there not flash and flow the fiery sense, The pulse of prescience? Shall not these know as in times overpast Thee loftiest to the last? For times and wars shall change, kingdoms and creeds, And dreams of men, and deeds; Earth shall grow grey with all her golden things, Pale peoples and hoar kings; But though her thrones and towers of nations fall, Death has no part in all; In the air, nor in the imperishable sea, Nor heaven, nor truth, nor thee. Yea, let all sceptre-stricken nations lie, But live thou though they die; Let their flags fade as flowers that storm can mar, But thine be like a star; Let England's, if it float not for men free, Fall, and forget the sea; Let France's, if it shadow a hateful head, Drop as a leaf drops dead; Thine let what storm soever smite the rest Smite as it seems him best; Thine let the wind that can, by sea or land, Wrest from thy banner-hand. Die they in whom dies freedom, die and cease, Though the world weep for these; Live thou and love and lift when these lie dead The green and white and red. O our Republic that shalt bind in bands The kingdomless far lands And link the chainless ages; thou that wast With England ere she past Among the faded nations, and shalt be Again, when sea to sea Calls through the wind and light of morning time, And throneless clime to clime Makes antiphonal answer; thou that art Where one man's perfect heart Burns, one man's brow is brightened for thy sake, Thine, strong to make or break; O fair Republic hallowing with stretched hands The limitless free lands, When all men's heads for love, not fear, bow down To thy sole royal crown, As thou to freedom; when man's life smells sweet, And at thy bright swift feet A bloodless and a bondless world is laid; Then, when thy men are made, Let these indeed as we in dreams behold One chosen of all thy fold, One of all fair things fairest, one exalt Above all fear or fault, One unforgetful of unhappier men And us who loved her then; With eyes that outlook suns and dream on graves; With voice like quiring waves; With heart the holier for their memories' sake Who slept that she might wake; With breast the sweeter for that sweet blood lost, And all the milkless cost; Lady of earth, whose large equality Bends but to her and thee; Equal with heaven, and infinite of years, And splendid from quenched tears; Strong with old strength of great things fallen and fled, Diviner for her dead; Chaste of all stains and perfect from all scars, Above all storms and stars, All winds that blow through time, all waves that foam, Our Capitolian Rome. 1867. ODE ON THE PROCLAMATION OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC September 4th, 1870 À VICTOR HUGO ??????? ??????? ????, ?? ?? ?? ??????. Strophe 1 With songs and crying and sounds of acclamations, Lo, the flame risen, the fire that falls in showers! Hark; for the word is out among the nations: Look; for the light is up upon the hours: O fears, O shames, O many tribulations, Yours were all yesterdays, but this day ours. Strong were your bonds linked fast with lamentations, With groans and tears built into walls and towers; Strong were your works and wonders of high stations, Your forts blood-based, and rampires of your powers: Lo now the last of divers desolations, The hand of time, that gathers hosts like flowers; Time, that fills up and pours out generations; Time, at whose breath confounded empire cowers. Str. 2 What are these moving in the dawn's red gloom? What is she waited on by dread and doom, Ill ministers of morning, bondmen born of night? If that head veiled and bowed be morning's head, If she come walking between doom and dread, Who shall rise up with song and dance before her sight? Are not the night's dead heaped about her feet? Is not death swollen, and slaughter full of meat? What, is their feast a bride-feast, where men sing and dance? A bitter, a bitter bride-song and a shrill Should the house raise that such bride-followers fill, Wherein defeat weds ruin, and takes for bride-bed France. For nineteen years deep shame and sore desire Fed from men's hearts with hungering fangs of fire, And hope fell sick with famine for the food of change. Now is change come, but bringing funeral urns; Now is day nigh, but the dawn blinds and burns; Now time long dumb hath language, but the tongue is strange. We that have seen her not our whole lives long, We to whose ears her dirge was cradle-song, The dirge men sang who laid in earth her living head, Is it by such light that we live to see Rise, with rent hair and raiment, Liberty? Does her grave open only to restore her dead? Ah, was it this we looked for, looked and prayed, This hour that treads upon the prayers we made, This ravening hour that breaks down good and ill alike? Ah, was it thus we thought to see her and hear, The one love indivisible and dear? Is it her head that hands which strike down wrong must strike? Str. 3 Where is hope, and promise where, in all these things, Shocks of strength with strength, and jar of hurtling kings? Who of all men, who will show us any good? Shall these lightnings of blind battles give men light? Where is freedom? who will bring us in her sight, That have hardly seen her footprint where she stood? Str. 4 Who is this that rises red with wounds and splendid, All her breast and brow made beautiful with scars, Burning bare as naked daylight, undefended, In her hands for spoils her splintered prison-bars, In her eyes the light and fire of long pain ended, In her lips a song as of the morning stars? Str. 5 O torn out of thy trance, O deathless, O my France, O many-wounded mother, O redeemed to reign! O rarely sweet and bitter The bright brief tears that glitter On thine unclosing eyelids, proud of their own pain; The beautiful brief tears That wash the stains of years White as the names immortal of thy chosen and slain. O loved so much so long, O smitten with such wrong, O purged at last and perfect without spot or stain, Light of the light of man, Reborn republican, At last, O first Republic, hailed in heaven again! Out of the obscene eclipse Rerisen, with burning lips To witness for us if we looked for thee in vain. Str. 6 Thou wast the light whereby men saw Light, thou the trumpet of the law Proclaiming manhood to mankind; And what if all these years were blind And shameful? Hath the sun a flaw Because one hour hath power to draw Mist round him wreathed as links to bind? And what if now keen anguish drains The very wellspring of thy veins And very spirit of thy breath? The life outlives them and disdains; The sense which makes the soul remains, And blood of thought which travaileth To bring forth hope with procreant pains. O thou that satest bound in chains Between thine hills and pleasant plains As whom his own soul vanquisheth, Held in the bonds of his own thought, Whence very death can take off nought, Nor sleep, with bitterer dreams than death, What though thy thousands at thy knees Lie thick as grave-worms feed on these, Though thy green fields and joyous places Are populous with blood-blackening faces And wan limbs eaten by the sun? Better an end of all men's races, Better the world's whole work were done, And life wiped out of all our traces, And there were left to time not one, Than such as these that fill thy graves Should sow in slaves the seed of slaves. Antistrophe 1 Not of thy sons, O mother many-wounded, Not of thy sons are slaves ingraffed and grown. Was it not thine, the fire whence light rebounded From kingdom on rekindling kingdom thrown, From hearts confirmed on tyrannies confounded, From earth on heaven, fire mightier than his own? Not thine the breath wherewith time's clarion sounded, And all the terror in the trumpet blown? The voice whereat the thunders stood astounded As at a new sound of a God unknown? And all the seas and shores within them bounded Shook at the strange speech of thy lips alone, And all the hills of heaven, the storm-surrounded, Trembled, and all the night sent forth a groan. Ant. 2 What hast thou done that such an hour should be More than another clothed with blood to thee? Thou hast seen many a bloodred hour before this one. What art thou that thy lovers should misdoubt? What is this hour that it should cast hope out? If hope turn back and fall from thee, what hast thou done? Thou hast done ill against thine own soul; yea, Thine own soul hast thou slain and burnt away, Dissolving it with poison into foul thin fume. Thine own life and creation of thy fate Thou hast set thine hand to unmake and discreate; And now thy slain soul rises between dread and doom. Yea, this is she that comes between them led; That veiled head is thine own soul's buried head, The head that was as morning's in the whole world's sight. These wounds are deadly on thee, but deadlier Those wounds the ravenous poison left on her; How shall her weak hands hold thy weak hands up to fight? Ah, but her fiery eyes, her eyes are these That, gazing, make thee shiver to the knees And the blood leap within thee, and the strong joy rise. What, doth her sight yet make thine heart to dance? O France, O freedom, O the soul of France, Are ye then quickened, gazing in each other's eyes? Ah, in her words, the words wherewith she sought thee Sorrowing, and bare in hand the robe she wrought thee To wear when soul and body were again made one, And fairest among women, and a bride, Sweet-voiced to sing the bridegroom to her side, The spirit of man, the bridegroom brighter than the sun! Ant. 3 Who shall help me? who shall take me by the hand? Who shall teach mine eyes to see, my feet to stand, Now my foes have stripped and wounded me by night? Who shall heal me? who shall come to take my part? Who shall set me as a seal upon his heart, As a seal upon his arm made bare for fight? Ant. 4 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, If thou see not where the signs of him abide, Lift thine eyes up to the light that stars grow dim in, To the morning whence he comes to take thy side. None but he can bear the light that love wraps him in, When he comes on earth to take himself a bride. Ant. 5 Light of light, name of names, Whose shadows are live flames, The soul that moves the wings of worlds upon their way; Life, spirit, blood and breath In time and change and death Substant through strength and weakness, ardour and decay; Lord of the lives of lands, Spirit of man, whose hands Weave the web through wherein man's centuries fall as prey; That art within our will Power to make, save, and kill, Knowledge and choice, to take extremities and weigh; In the soul's hand to smite Strength, in the soul's eye sight; That to the soul art even as is the soul to clay; Now to this people be Love; come, to set them free, With feet that tread the night, with eyes that sound the day. Ant. 6 Thou that wast on their fathers dead As effluent God effused and shed, Heaven to be handled, hope made flesh, Break for them now time's iron mesh; Give them thyself for hand and head, Thy breath for life, thy love for bread, Thy thought for spirit to refresh, Thy bitterness to pierce and sting, Thy sweetness for a healing spring. Be to them knowledge, strength, life, light, Thou to whose feet the centuries cling And in the wide warmth of thy wing Seek room and rest as birds by night, O thou the kingless people's king, To whom the lips of silence sing, Called by thy name of thanksgiving Freedom, and by thy name of might Justice, and by thy secret name Love; the same need is on the same Men, be the same God in their sight! From this their hour of bloody tears Their praise goes up into thine ears, Their bruised lips clothe thy name with praises, The song of thee their crushed voice raises, Their grief seeks joy for psalms to borrow, With tired feet seeks her through time's mazes Where each day's blood leaves pale the morrow, And from their eyes in thine there gazes A spirit other far than sorrow— A soul triumphal, white and whole And single, that salutes thy soul. Epode All the lights of the sweet heaven that sing together; All the years of the green earth that bare man free; Rays and lightnings of the fierce or tender weather, Heights and lowlands, wastes and headlands of the sea, Dawns and sunsets, hours that hold the world in tether, Be our witnesses and seals of things to be. Lo the mother, the Republic universal, Hands that hold time fast, hands feeding men with might, Lips that sing the song of the earth, that make rehearsal Of all seasons, and the sway of day with night, Eyes that see as from a mountain the dispersal, The huge ruin of things evil, and the flight; Large exulting limbs, and bosom godlike moulded Where the man-child hangs, and womb wherein he lay; Very life that could it die would leave the soul dead, Face whereat all fears and forces flee away, Breath that moves the world as winds a flower-bell folded, Feet that trampling the gross darkness beat out day. In the hour of pain and pity, Sore spent, a wounded city, Her foster-child seeks to her, stately where she stands; In the utter hour of woes, Wind-shaken, blind with blows, Paris lays hold upon her, grasps her with child's hands; Face kindles face with fire, Hearts take and give desire, Strange joy breaks red as tempest on tormented lands. Day to day, man to man, Plights love republican, And faith and memory burn with passion toward each other; Hope, with fresh heavens to track, Looks for a breath's space back, Where the divine past years reach hands to this their brother; And souls of men whose death Was light to her and breath Send word of love yet living to the living mother. They call her, and she hears; O France, thy marvellous years, The years of the strong travail, the triumphant time, Days terrible with love, Red-shod with flames thereof, Call to this hour that breaks in pieces crown and crime; The hour with feet to spurn, Hands to crush, fires to burn The state whereto no latter foot of man shall climb. Yea, come what grief now may By ruinous night or day, One grief there cannot, one the first and last grief, shame. Come force to break thee and bow Down, shame can come not now, Nor, though hands wound thee, tongues make mockery of thy name: Come swords and scar thy brow, No brand there burns it now, No spot but of thy blood marks thy white-fronted fame. Now, though the mad blind morrow With shafts of iron sorrow Should split thine heart, and whelm thine head with sanguine waves; Though all that draw thy breath Bled from all veins to death, And thy dead body were the grave of all their graves, And thine unchilded womb For all their tombs a tomb, At least within thee as on thee room were none for slaves. This power thou hast, to be, Come death or come not, free; That in all tongues of time's this praise be chanted of thee, That in thy wild worst hour This power put in thee power, And moved as hope around and hung as heaven above thee, And while earth sat in sadness In only thee put gladness, Put strength and love, to make all hearts of ages love thee. That in death's face thy chant Arose up jubilant, And thy great heart with thy great peril grew more great: And sweet for bitter tears Put out the fires of fears, And love made lovely for thee loveless hell and hate; And they that house with error, Cold shame and burning terror, Fled from truth risen and thee made mightier than thy fate. This shall all years remember; For this thing shall September Have only name of honour, only sign of white. And this year's fearful name, France, in thine house of fame Above all names of all thy triumphs shalt thou write, When, seeing thy freedom stand Even at despair's right hand, The cry thou gavest at heart was only of delight. DIRÆ Guai a voi, anime prave. Dante. Soyez maudits, d'abord d'être ce que vous êtes, Et puis soyez maudits d'obséder les poëtes! Victor Hugo. I A DEAD KING [Ferdinand II. entered Malebolge May 22nd, 1859.] Go down to hell. This end is good to see; The breath is lightened and the sense at ease Because thou art not; sense nor breath there is In what thy body was, whose soul shall be Chief nerve of hell's pained heart eternally. Thou art abolished from the midst of these That are what thou wast: Pius from his knees Blows off the dust that flecked them, bowed for thee. Yea, now the long-tongued slack-lipped litanies Fail, and the priest has no more prayer to sell— Now the last Jesuit found about thee is The beast that made thy fouler flesh his cell— Time lays his finger on thee, saying, “Cease; Here is no room for thee; go down to hell.” II A YEAR AFTER If blood throbs yet in this that was thy face, O thou whose soul was full of devil's faith, If in thy flesh the worm's bite slackeneth In some acute red pause of iron days, Arise now, gird thee, get thee on thy ways, Breathe off the worm that crawls and fears not breath; King, it may be thou shalt prevail on death; King, it may be thy soul shall find out grace. O spirit that hast eased the place of Cain, Weep now and howl, yea weep now sore; for this That was thy kingdom hath spat out its king. Wilt thou plead now with God? behold again, Thy prayer for thy son's sake is turned to a hiss, Thy mouth to a snake's whose slime outlives the sting. III PETER'S PENCE FROM PERUGIA Iscariot, thou grey-grown beast of blood, Stand forth to plead; stand, while red drops run here And there down fingers shaken with foul fear, Down the sick shivering chin that stooped and sued, Bowed to the bosom, for a little food At Herod's hand, who smites thee cheek and ear. Cry out, Iscariot; haply he will hear; Cry, till he turn again to do thee good. Gather thy gold up, Judas, all thy gold, And buy thee death; no Christ is here to sell, But the dead earth of poor men bought and sold, While year heaps year above thee safe in hell, To grime thy grey dishonourable head With dusty shame, when thou art damned and dead. IV PAPAL ALLOCUTION “Popule mi, quid tibi feci?” What hast thou done? Hark, till thine ears wax hot, Judas; for these and these things hast thou done. Thou hast made earth faint, and sickened the sweet sun, With fume of blood that reeks from limbs that rot; Thou hast washed thine hands and mouth, saying, “Am I not Clean?” and thy lips were bloody, and there was none To speak for man against thee, no, not one; This hast thou done to us, Iscariot. Therefore, though thou be deaf and heaven be dumb, A cry shall be from under to proclaim In the ears of all who shed men's blood or sell Pius the Ninth, Judas the Second, come Where Boniface out of the filth and flame Barks for his advent in the clefts of hell. Dante, “Inferno,” xix. 53. THE BURDEN OF AUSTRIA 1866 O daughter of pride, wasted with misery, With all the glory that thy shame put on Stripped off thy shame, O daughter of Babylon, Yea, whoso be it, yea, happy shall he be That as thou hast served us hath rewarded thee. Blessed, who throweth against war's boundary stone Thy warrior brood, and breaketh bone by bone Misrule thy son, thy daughter Tyranny. That landmark shalt thou not remove for shame, But sitting down there in a widow's weed Wail; for what fruit is now of thy red fame? Have thy sons too and daughters learnt indeed What thing it is to weep, what thing to bleed? Is it not thou that now art but a name? “A geographical expression.” —Metternich of Italy. VI LOCUSTA Come close and see her and hearken. This is she. Stop the ways fast against the stench that nips Your nostril as it nears her. Lo, the lips That between prayer and prayer find time to be Poisonous, the hands holding a cup and key, Key of deep hell, cup whence blood reeks and drips; The loose lewd limbs, the reeling hingeless hips, The scurf that is not skin but leprosy. This haggard harlot grey of face and green With the old hand's cunning mixes her new priest The cup she mixed her Nero, stirred and spiced. She lisps of Mary and Jesus Nazarene With a tongue tuned, and head that bends to the east, Praying. There are who say she is bride of Christ. VII CELÆNO The blind king hides his weeping eyeless head, Sick with the helpless hate and shame and awe, Till food have choked the glutted hell-bird's craw And the foul cropful creature lie as dead And soil itself with sleep and too much bread: So the man's life serves under the beast's law, And things whose spirit lives in mouth and maw Share shrieking the soul's board and soil her bed, Till man's blind spirit, their sick slave, resign Its kingdom to the priests whose souls are swine, And the scourged serf lie reddening from their rod, Discrowned, disrobed, dismantled, with lost eyes Seeking where lurks in what conjectural skies That triple-headed hound of hell their God. VIII A CHOICE Faith is the spirit that makes man's body and blood Sacred, to crown when life and death have ceased His heavenward head for high fame's holy feast; But as one swordstroke swift as wizard's rod Made Cæsar carrion and made Brutus God, Faith false or true, born patriot or born priest, Smites into semblance or of man or beast The soul that feeds on clean or unclean food. Lo here the faith that lives on its own light, Visible music; and lo there, the foul Shape without shape, the harpy throat and howl. Sword of the spirit of man! arise and smite, And sheer through throat and claw and maw and tongue Kill the beast faith that lives on its own dung. IX THE AUGURS Lay the corpse out on the altar; bid the elect Slaves clear the ways of service spiritual, Sweep clean the stalled soul's serviceable stall, Ere the chief priest's dismantling hands detect The ulcerous flesh of faith all scaled and specked Beneath the bandages that hid it all, And with sharp edgetools œcumenical The leprous carcases of creeds dissect. As on the night ere Brutus grew divine The sick-souled augurs found their ox or swine Heartless; so now too by their after art In the same Rome, at an uncleaner shrine, Limb from rank limb, and putrid part from part, They carve the corpse—a beast without a heart. X A COUNSEL O strong Republic of the nobler years Whose white feet shine beside time's fairer flood That shall flow on the clearer for our blood Now shed, and the less brackish for our tears; When time and truth have put out hopes and fears With certitude, and love has burst the bud, If these whose powers then down the wind shall scud Still live to feel thee smite their eyes and ears, When thy foot's tread hath crushed their crowns and creeds, Care thou not then to crush the beast that bleeds, The snake whose belly cleaveth to the sod, Nor set thine heel on men as on their deeds; But let the worm Napoleon crawl untrod, Nor grant Mastai the gallows of his God. 1869. XI THE MODERATES Virtutem videant intabescantque relictâ She stood before her traitors bound and bare, Clothed with her wounds and with her naked shame As with a weed of fiery tears and flame, Their mother-land, their common weal and care, And they turned from her and denied, and sware They did not know this woman nor her name. And they took truce with tyrants and grew tame, And gathered up cast crowns and creeds to wear, And rags and shards regilded. Then she took In her bruised hands their broken pledge, and eyed These men so late so loud upon her side With one inevitable and tearless look, That they might see her face whom they forsook; And they beheld what they had left, and died. February 1870. XII INTERCESSION Ave Cæsar Imperator, moriturum te saluto. I O Death, a little more, and then the worm; A little longer, O Death, a little yet, Before the grave gape and the grave-worm fret; Before the sanguine-spotted hand infirm Be rottenness, and that foul brain, the germ Of all ill things and thoughts, be stopped and set; A little while, O Death, ere he forget, A small space more of life, a little term; A little longer ere he and thou be met, Ere in that hand that fed thee to thy mind The poison-cup of life be overset; A little respite of disastrous breath, Till the soul lift up her lost eyes, and find Nor God nor help nor hope, but thee, O Death. II Shall a man die before his dying day, Death? and for him though the utter day be nigh, Not yet, not yet we give him leave to die; We give him grace not yet that men should say He is dead, wiped out, perished and past away. Till the last bitterness of life go by, Thou shalt not slay him; till those last dregs run dry, O thou last lord of life! thou shalt not slay. Let the lips live a little while and lie, The hand a little, and falter, and fail of strength, And the soul shudder and sicken at the sky; Yea, let him live, though God nor man would let Save for the curse' sake; then at bitter length, Lord, will we yield him to thee, but not yet. III Hath he not deeds to do and days to see Yet ere the day that is to see him dead? Beats there no brain yet in the poisonous head, Throbs there no treason? if no such thing there be, If no such thought, surely this is not he. Look to the hands then; are the hands not red? What are the shadows about this man's bed? Death, was not this the cupbearer to thee? Nay, let him live then, till in this life's stead Even he shall pray for that thou hast to give; Till seeing his hopes and not his memories fled Even he shall cry upon thee a bitter cry, That life is worse than death; then let him live, Till death seem worse than life; then let him die. IV O watcher at the guardless gate of kings, O doorkeeper that serving at their feast Hast in thine hand their doomsday drink, and seest With eyeless sight the soul of unseen things; Thou in whose ear the dumb time coming sings, Death, priest and king that makest of king and priest A name, a dream, a less thing than the least, Hover awhile above him with closed wings, Till the coiled soul, an evil snake-shaped beast, Eat its base bodily lair of flesh away; If haply, or ever its cursed life have ceased, Or ever thy cold hands cover his head From sight of France and freedom and broad day, He may see these and wither and be dead. Paris: September 1869. XIII THE SAVIOUR OF SOCIETY I O son of man, but of what man who knows? That broughtest healing on thy leathern wings To priests, and under them didst gather kings, And madest friends to thee of all man's foes; Before thine incarnation, the tale goes, Thy virgin mother, pure of sensual stings, Communed by night with angels of chaste things, And, full of grace, untimely felt the throes Of motherhood upon her, and believed The obscure annunciation made when late A raven-feathered raven-throated dove Croaked salutation to the mother of love Whose misconception was immaculate, And when her time was come she misconceived. II Thine incarnation was upon this wise, Saviour; and out of east and west were led To thy foul cradle by thy planet red Shepherds of souls that feed their sheep with lies Till the utter soul die as the body dies, And the wise men that ask but to be fed Though the hot shambles be their board and bed And sleep on any dunghill shut their eyes, So they lie warm and fatten in the mire: And the high priest enthroned yet in thy name, Judas, baptised thee with men's blood for hire; And now thou hangest nailed to thine own shame In sight of all time, but while heaven has flame Shalt find no resurrection from hell-fire. December 1869. XIV MENTANA: SECOND ANNIVERSARY Est-ce qu'il n'est pas temps que la foudre se prouve, Cieux profonds, en broyant ce chien, fils de la louve? La Légende des Siècles:—Ratbert. I By the dead body of Hope, the spotless lamb Thou threwest into the high priest's slaughtering-room, And by the child Despair born red therefrom As, thank the secret sire picked out to cram With spurious spawn thy misconceiving dam, Thou, like a worm from a town's common tomb, Didst creep from forth the kennel of her womb, Born to break down with catapult and ram Man's builded towers of promise, and with breath And tongue to track and hunt his hopes to death: O, by that sweet dead body abused and slain, And by that child mismothered,—dog, by all Thy curses thou hast cursed mankind withal, With what curse shall man curse thee back again? II By the brute soul that made man's soul its food; By time grown poisonous with it; by the hate And horror of all souls not miscreate; By the hour of power that evil hath on good; And by the incognizable fatherhood Which made a whorish womb the shameful gate That opening let out loose to fawn on fate A hound half-blooded ravening for man's blood; (What prayer but this for thee should any say, Thou dog of hell, but this that Shakespeare said?) By night deflowered and desecrated day, That fall as one curse on one cursed head, “Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray, That I may live to say, The dog is dead!” 1869. XV MENTANA: THIRD ANNIVERSARY I Such prayers last year were put up for thy sake; What shall this year do that hath lived to see The piteous and unpitied end of thee? What moan, what cry, what clamour shall it make, Seeing as a reed breaks all thine empire break, And all thy great strength as a rotten tree, Whose branches made broad night from sea to sea, And the world shuddered when a leaf would shake? From the unknown deep wherein those prayers were heard, From the dark height of time there sounds a word, Crying, Comfort; though death ride on this red hour, Hope waits with eyes that make the morning dim, Till liberty, reclothed with love and power, Shall pass and know not if she tread on him. II The hour for which men hungered and had thirst, And dying were loth to die before it came, Is it indeed upon thee? and the lame Late foot of vengeance on thy trace accurst For years insepulchred and crimes inhearsed, For days marked red or black with blood or shame, Hath it outrun thee to tread out thy name? This scourge, this hour, is this indeed the worst? O clothed and crowned with curses, canst thou tell? Have thy dead whispered to thee what they see Whose eyes are open in the dark on thee Ere spotted soul and body take farewell Or what of life beyond the worm's may be Satiate the immitigable hours in hell? 1870. XVI THE DESCENT INTO HELL January 9th, 1873 I O night and death, to whom we grudged him then, When in man's sight he stood not yet undone, Your king, your priest, your saviour, and your son, We grudge not now, who know that not again Shall this curse come upon the sins of men, Nor this face look upon the living sun That shall behold not so abhorred an one In all the days whereof his eye takes ken. The bond is cancelled, and the prayer is heard That seemed so long but weak and wasted breath; Take him, for he is yours, O night and death. Hell yawns on him whose life was as a word Uttered by death in hate of heaven and light, A curse now dumb upon the lips of night. II What shapes are these and shadows without end That fill the night full as a storm of rain With myriads of dead men and women slain, Old with young, child with mother, friend with friend, That on the deep mid wintering air impend, Pale yet with mortal wrath and human pain, Who died that this man dead now too might reign, Toward whom their hands point and their faces bend? The ruining flood would redden earth and air If for each soul whose guiltless blood was shed There fell but one drop on this one man's head Whose soul to-night stands bodiless and bare, For whom our hearts give thanks who put up prayer, That we have lived to say, The dog is dead. XVII APOLOGIA If wrath embitter the sweet mouth of song, And make the sunlight fire before those eye That would drink draughts of peace from the unsoiled skies, The wrongdoing is not ours, but ours the wrong, Who hear too loud on earth and see too long The grief that dies not with the groan that dies, Till the strong bitterness of pity cries Within us, that our anger should be strong. For chill is known by heat and heat by chill, And the desire that hope makes love to still By the fear flying beside it or above, A falcon fledged to follow a fledgeling dove, And by the fume and flame of hate of ill The exuberant light and burning bloom of love.</field>

BURTON IN REDEMPTION OF AN OLD PLEDGE AND IN RECOGNITION OF A FRIENDSHIP WHICH I MUST ALWAYS COUNT AMONG THE HIGHEST HONOURS OF MY LIFE THE LAST ORACLE (A.D. 361) ?????? ?? ???????, ????? ???? ???????? ????? ?????? ?????? ???? ???????, ?? ??????? ??????, ?? ????? ????????? ? ???????? ??? ????? ????. Years have risen and fallen in darkness or in twilight, Ages waxed and waned that knew not thee nor thine, While the world sought light by night and sought not thy light, Since the sad last pilgrim left thy dark mid shrine. Dark the shrine and dumb the fount of song thence welling, Save for words more sad than tears of blood, that said: Tell the king, on earth has fallen the glorious dwelling, And the watersprings that spake are quenched and dead. Not a cell is left the God, no roof, no cover In his hand the prophet laurel flowers no more. And the great king's high sad heart, thy true last lover, Felt thine answer pierce and cleave it to the core. And he bowed down his hopeless head In the drift of the wild world's tide, And dying, Thou hast conquered, he said, Galilean; he said it, and died. And the world that was thine and was ours When the Graces took hands with the Hours Grew cold as a winter wave In the wind from a wide-mouthed grave, As a gulf wide open to swallow The light that the world held dear. O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo, Destroyer and healer, hear! Age on age thy mouth was mute, thy face was hidden, And the lips and eyes that loved thee blind and dumb; Song forsook their tongues that held thy name forbidden, Light their eyes that saw the strange God's kingdom come. Fire for light and hell for heaven and psalms for pæans Filled the clearest eyes and lips most sweet of song, When for chant of Greeks the wail of Galileans Made the whole world moan with hymns of wrath and wrong. Yea, not yet we see thee, father, as they saw thee, They that worshipped when the world was theirs and thine, They whose words had power by thine own power to draw thee Down from heaven till earth seemed more than heaven divine. For the shades are about us that hover When darkness is half withdrawn And the skirts of the dead night cover The face of the live new dawn. For the past is not utterly past Though the word on its lips be the last, And the time be gone by with its creed When men were as beasts that bleed, As sheep or as swine that wallow, In the shambles of faith and of fear. O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo, Destroyer and healer, hear! Yet it may be, lord and father, could we know it, We that love thee for our darkness shall have light More than ever prophet hailed of old or poet Standing crowned and robed and sovereign in thy sight. To the likeness of one God their dreams enthralled thee, Who wast greater than all Gods that waned and grew; Son of God the shining son of Time they called thee, Who wast older, O our father, than they knew. For no thought of man made Gods to love or honour Ere the song within the silent soul began, Nor might earth in dream or deed take heaven upon her Till the word was clothed with speech by lips of man. And the word and the life wast thou, The spirit of man and the breath; And before thee the Gods that bow Take life at thine hands and death. For these are as ghosts that wane, That are gone in an age or twain; Harsh, merciful, passionate, pure, They perish, but thou shalt endure; Be their flight with the swan or the swallow, They pass as the flight of a year. O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo, Destroyer and healer, hear! Thou the word, the light, the life, the breath, the glory, Strong to help and heal, to lighten and to slay, Thine is all the song of man, the world's whole story; Not of morning and of evening is thy day. Old and younger Gods are buried or begotten From uprising to downsetting of thy sun, Risen from eastward, fallen to westward and forgotten, And their springs are many, but their end is one. Divers births of godheads find one death appointed, As the soul whence each was born makes room for each; God by God goes out, discrowned and disanointed, But the soul stands fast that gave them shape and speech. Is the sun yet cast out of heaven? Is the song yet cast out of man? Life that had song for its leaven To quicken the blood that ran Through the veins of the songless years More bitter and cold than tears, Heaven that had thee for its one Light, life, word, witness, O sun, Are they soundless and sightless and hollow, Without eye, without speech, without ear? O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo, Destroyer and healer, hear! Time arose and smote thee silent at his warning, Change and darkness fell on men that fell from thee; Dark thou satest, veiled with light, behind the morning, Till the soul of man should lift up eyes and see. Till the blind mute soul get speech again and eyesight, Man may worship not the light of life within; In his sight the stars whose fires grow dark in thy sight Shine as sunbeams on the night of death and sin. Time again is risen with mightier word of warning, Change hath blown again a blast of louder breath; Clothed with clouds and stars and dreams that melt in morning, Lo, the Gods that ruled by grace of sin and death! They are conquered, they break, they are stricken, Whose might made the whole world pale; They are dust that shall rise not or quicken Though the world for their death's sake wail. As a hound on a wild beast's trace, So time has their godhead in chase; As wolves when the hunt makes head, They are scattered, they fly, they are fled; They are fled beyond hail, beyond hollo, And the cry of the chase, and the cheer. O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo, Destroyer and healer, hear! Day by day thy shadow shines in heaven beholden, Even the sun, the shining shadow of thy face: King, the ways of heaven before thy feet grow golden; God, the soul of earth is kindled with thy grace. In thy lips the speech of man whence Gods were fashioned, In thy soul the thought that makes them and unmakes; By thy light and heat incarnate and impassioned, Soul to soul of man gives light for light and takes. As they knew thy name of old time could we know it, Healer called of sickness, slayer invoked of wrong, Light of eyes that saw thy light, God, king, priest, poet, Song should bring thee back to heal us with thy song. For thy kingdom is past not away, Nor thy power from the place thereof hurled; Out of heaven they shall cast not the day, They shall cast not out song from the world. By the song and the light they give We know thy works that they live; With the gift thou hast given us of speech We praise, we adore, we beseech, We arise at thy bidding and follow, We cry to thee, answer, appear, O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo, Destroyer and healer, hear! IN THE BAY I Beyond the hollow sunset, ere a star Take heart in heaven from eastward, while the west, Fulfilled of watery resonance and rest, Is as a port with clouds for harbour bar To fold the fleet in of the winds from far That stir no plume now of the bland sea's breast: II Above the soft sweep of the breathless bay Southwestward, far past flight of night and day, Lower than the sunken sunset sinks, and higher Than dawn can freak the front of heaven with fire, My thought with eyes and wings made wide makes way To find the place of souls that I desire. III If any place for any soul there be, Disrobed and disentrammelled; if the might, The fire and force that filled with ardent light The souls whose shadow is half the light we see, Survive and be suppressed not of the night; This hour should show what all day hid from me. IV Night knows not, neither is it shown to day, By sunlight nor by starlight is it shown, Nor to the full moon's eye nor footfall known, Their world's untrodden and unkindled way. Nor is the breath nor music of it blown With sounds of winter or with winds of May. V But here, where light and darkness reconciled Hold earth between them as a weanling child Between the balanced hands of death and birth, Even as they held the new-born shape of earth When first life trembled in her limbs and smiled, Here hope might think to find what hope were worth. VI Past Hades, past Elysium, past the long Slow smooth strong lapse of Lethe—past the toil Wherein all souls are taken as a spoil, The Stygian web of waters—if your song Be quenched not, O our brethren, but be strong As ere ye too shook off our temporal coil; VII If yet these twain survive your worldly breath, Joy trampling sorrow, life devouring death, If perfect life possess your life all through And like your words your souls be deathless too, To-night, of all whom night encompasseth, My soul would commune with one soul of you. VIII Above the sunset might I see thine eyes That were above the sundawn in our skies, Son of the songs of morning,—thine that were First lights to lighten that rekindling air Wherethrough men saw the front of England rise And heard thine loudest of the lyre-notes there— IX If yet thy fire have not one spark the less, O Titan, born of her a Titaness, Across the sunrise and the sunset's mark Send of thy lyre one sound, thy fire one spark, To change this face of our unworthiness, Across this hour dividing light from dark. X To change this face of our chill time, that hears No song like thine of all that crowd its ears, Of all its lights that lighten all day long Sees none like thy most fleet and fiery sphere's Outlightening Sirius—in its twilight throng No thunder and no sunrise like thy song. XI Hath not the sea-wind swept the sea-line bare To pave with stainless fire through stainless air A passage for thine heavenlier feet to tread Ungrieved of earthly floor-work? hath it spread No covering splendid as the sun-god's hair To veil or to reveal thy lordlier head? XII Hath not the sunset strewn across the sea A way majestical enough for thee? What hour save this should be thine hour—and mine, If thou have care of any less divine Than thine own soul; if thou take thought of me, Marlowe, as all my soul takes thought of thine? XIII Before the moon's face as before the sun The morning star and evening star are one For all men's lands as England. O, if night Hang hard upon us,—ere our day take flight, Shed thou some comfort from thy day long done On us pale children of the latter light! XIV For surely, brother and master and lord and king, Where'er thy footfall and thy face make spring In all souls' eyes that meet thee wheresoe'er, And have thy soul for sunshine and sweet air— Some late love of thine old live land should cling, Some living love of England, round thee there. XV Here from her shore across her sunniest sea My soul makes question of the sun for thee, And waves and beams make answer. When thy feet Made her ways flowerier and their flowers more sweet With childlike passage of a god to be, Like spray these waves cast off her foemen's fleet. XVI Like foam they flung it from her, and like weed Its wrecks were washed from scornful shoal to shoal, From rock to rock reverberate; and the whole Sea laughed and lightened with a deathless deed That sowed our enemies in her field for seed And made her shores fit harbourage for thy soul. XVII Then in her green south fields, a poor man's child, Thou hadst thy short sweet fill of half-blown joy, That ripens all of us for time to cloy With full-blown pain and passion; ere the wild World caught thee by the fiery heart, and smiled To make so swift end of the godlike boy. XVIII For thou, if ever godlike foot there trod These fields of ours, wert surely like a god. Who knows what splendour of strange dreams was shed With sacred shadow and glimmer of gold and red From hallowed windows, over stone and sod, On thine unbowed bright insubmissive head? XIX The shadow stayed not, but the splendour stays, Our brother, till the last of English days. No day nor night on English earth shall be For ever, spring nor summer, Junes nor Mays, But somewhat as a sound or gleam of thee Shall come on us like morning from the sea. XX Like sunrise never wholly risen, nor yet Quenched; or like sunset never wholly set, A light to lighten as from living eyes The cold unlit close lids of one that lies Dead, or a ray returned from death's far skies To fire us living lest our lives forget. XXI For in that heaven what light of lights may be, What splendour of what stars, what spheres of flame Sounding, that none may number nor may name, We know not, even thy brethren; yea, not we Whose eyes desire the light that lightened thee, Whose ways and thine are one way and the same. XXII But if the riddles that in sleep we read, And trust them not, be flattering truth indeed, As he that rose our mightiest called them,—he, Much higher than thou as thou much higher than we— There, might we say, all flower of all our seed, All singing souls are as one sounding sea. XXIII All those that here were of thy kind and kin, Beside thee and below thee, full of love, Full-souled for song,—and one alone above Whose only light folds all your glories in— With all birds' notes from nightingale to dove Fill the world whither we too fain would win. XXIV The world that sees in heaven the sovereign light Of sunlike Shakespeare, and the fiery night Whose stars were watched of Webster; and beneath, The twin-souled brethren of the single wreath, Grown in kings' gardens, plucked from pastoral heath, Wrought with all flowers for all men's heart's delight. XXV And that fixed fervour, iron-red like Mars, In the mid moving tide of tenderer stars, That burned on loves and deeds the darkest done, Athwart the incestuous prisoner's bride-house bars; And thine, most highest of all their fires but one, Our morning star, sole risen before the sun. XXVI And one light risen since theirs to run such race Thou hast seen, O Phosphor, from thy pride of place. Thou hast seen Shelley, him that was to thee As light to fire or dawn to lightning; me, Me likewise, O our brother, shalt thou see, And I behold thee, face to glorious face? XXVII You twain the same swift year of manhood swept Down the steep darkness, and our father wept. And from the gleam of Apollonian tears A holier aureole rounds your memories, kept Most fervent-fresh of all the singing spheres, And April-coloured through all months and years. XXVIII You twain fate spared not half your fiery span; The longer date fulfils the lesser man. Ye from beyond the dark dividing date Stand smiling, crowned as gods with foot on fate. For stronger was your blessing than his ban, And earliest whom he struck, he struck too late. XXIX Yet love and loathing, faith and unfaith yet Bind less to greater souls in unison, And one desire that makes three spirits as one Takes great and small as in one spiritual net Woven out of hope toward what shall yet be done Ere hate or love remember or forget. XXX Woven out of faith and hope and love too great To bear the bonds of life and death and fate: Woven out of love and hope and faith too dear To take the print of doubt and change and fear: And interwoven with lines of wrath and hate Blood-red with soils of many a sanguine year. XXXI Who cannot hate, can love not; if he grieve, His tears are barren as the unfruitful rain That rears no harvest from the green sea's plain, And as thorns crackling this man's laugh is vain. Nor can belief touch, kindle, smite, reprieve His heart who has not heart to disbelieve. XXXII But you, most perfect in your hate and love, Our great twin-spirited brethren; you that stand Head by head glittering, hand made fast in hand, And underfoot the fang-drawn worm that strove To wound you living; from so far above, Look love, not scorn, on ours that was your land. XXXIII For love we lack, and help and heat and light To clothe us and to comfort us with might. What help is ours to take or give? but ye— O, more than sunrise to the blind cold sea, That wailed aloud with all her waves all night, Much more, being much more glorious, should you be. XXXIV As fire to frost, as ease to toil, as dew To flowerless fields, as sleep to slackening pain, As hope to souls long weaned from hope again Returning, or as blood revived anew To dry-drawn limbs and every pulseless vein, Even so toward us should no man be but you. XXXV One rose before the sunrise was, and one Before the sunset, lovelier than the sun. And now the heaven is dark and bright and loud With wind and starry drift and moon and cloud, And night's cry rings in straining sheet and shroud, What help is ours if hope like yours be none? XXXVI O well-beloved, our brethren, if ye be, Then are we not forsaken. This kind earth Made fragrant once for all time with your birth, And bright for all men with your love, and worth The clasp and kiss and wedlock of the sea, Were not your mother if not your brethren we. XXXVII Because the days were dark with gods and kings And in time's hand the old hours of time as rods, When force and fear set hope and faith at odds, Ye failed not nor abased your plume-plucked wings; And we that front not more disastrous things, How should we fail in face of kings and gods? XXXVIII For now the deep dense plumes of night are thinned Surely with winnowing of the glimmering wind Whose feet are fledged with morning; and the breath Begins in heaven that sings the dark to death. And all the night wherein men groaned and sinned Sickens at heart to hear what sundawn saith. XXXIX O first-born sons of hope and fairest, ye Whose prows first clove the thought-unsounded sea Whence all the dark dead centuries rose to bar The spirit of man lest truth should make him free, The sunrise and the sunset, seeing one star, Take heart as we to know you that ye are. XL Ye rise not and ye set not; we that say Ye rise and set like hopes that set and rise Look yet but seaward from a land-locked bay; But where at last the sea's line is the sky's And truth and hope one sunlight in your eyes, No sunrise and no sunset marks their day. A FORSAKEN GARDEN In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland, At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee, Walled round with rocks as an inland island, The ghost of a garden fronts the sea. A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses The steep square slope of the blossomless bed Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses Now lie dead. The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken, To the low last edge of the long lone land. If a step should sound or a word be spoken, Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand? So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless, Through branches and briars if a man make way, He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless Night and day. The dense hard passage is blind and stifled That crawls by a track none turn to climb To the strait waste place that the years have rifled Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time. The thorns he spares when the rose is taken; The rocks are left when he wastes the plain. The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken, These remain. Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not; As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry; From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not, Could she call, there were never a rose to reply. Over the meadows that blossom and wither Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song; Only the sun and the rain come hither All year long. The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath. Only the wind here hovers and revels In a round where life seems barren as death. Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping, Haply, of lovers none ever will know, Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping Years ago. Heart handfast in heart as they stood, “Look thither,” Did he whisper? “look forth from the flowers to the sea; For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither, And men that love lightly may die—but we?” And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened, And or ever the garden's last petals were shed, In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened, Love was dead. Or they loved their life through, and then went whither? And were one to the end—but what end who knows? Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither, As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose. Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them? What love was ever as deep as a grave? They are loveless now as the grass above them Or the wave. All are at one now, roses and lovers, Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea. Not a breath of the time that has been hovers In the air now soft with a summer to be. Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep, When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter We shall sleep. Here death may deal not again for ever; Here change may come not till all change end. From the graves they have made they shall rise up never, Who have left nought living to ravage and rend. Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing, While the sun and the rain live, these shall be; Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing Roll the sea. Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble, Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink, Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink, Here now in his triumph where all things falter, Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread, As a god self-slain on his own strange altar, Death lies dead. RELICS This flower that smells of honey and the sea, White laurustine, seems in my hand to be A white star made of memory long ago Lit in the heaven of dear times dead to me. A star out of the skies love used to know Here held in hand, a stray left yet to show What flowers my heart was full of in the days That are long since gone down dead memory's flow. Dead memory that revives on doubtful ways, Half hearkening what the buried season says Out of the world of the unapparent dead Where the lost Aprils are, and the lost Mays. Flower, once I knew thy star-white brethren bred Nigh where the last of all the land made head Against the sea, a keen-faced promontory, Flowers on salt wind and sprinkled sea-dews fed. Their hearts were glad of the free place's glory; The wind that sang them all his stormy story Had talked all winter to the sleepless spray, And as the sea's their hues were hard and hoary. Like things born of the sea and the bright day, They laughed out at the years that could not slay, Live sons and joyous of unquiet hours, And stronger than all storms that range for prey. And in the close indomitable flowers A keen-edged odour of the sun and showers Was as the smell of the fresh honeycomb Made sweet for mouths of none but paramours. Out of the hard green wall of leaves that clomb They showed like windfalls of the snow-soft foam, Or feathers from the weary south-wind's wing, Fair as the spray that it came shoreward from. And thou, as white, what word hast thou to bring? If my heart hearken, whereof wilt thou sing? For some sign surely thou too hast to bear, Some word far south was taught thee of the spring. White like a white rose, not like these that were Taught of the wind's mouth and the winter air, Poor tender thing of soft Italian bloom, Where once thou grewest, what else for me grew there? Born in what spring and on what city's tomb, By whose hand wast thou reached, and plucked for whom? There hangs about thee, could the soul's sense tell, An odour as of love and of love's doom. Of days more sweet than thou wast sweet to smell, Of flower-soft thoughts that came to flower and fell, Of loves that lived a lily's life and died, Of dreams now dwelling where dead roses dwell. O white birth of the golden mountain-side That for the sun's love makes its bosom wide At sunrise, and with all its woods and flowers Takes in the morning to its heart of pride! Thou hast a word of that one land of ours, And of the fair town called of the Fair Towers, A word for me of my San Gimignan, A word of April's greenest-girdled hours. Of the old breached walls whereon the wallflowers ran Called of Saint Fina, breachless now of man, Though time with soft feet break them stone by stone, Who breaks down hour by hour his own reign's span. Of the old cliff overcome and overgrown That all that flowerage clothed as flesh clothes bone, That garment of acacias made for May, Whereof here lies one witness overblown. The fair brave trees with all their flowers at play, How king-like they stood up into the day! How sweet the day was with them, and the night! Such words of message have dead flowers to say. This that the winter and the wind made bright, And this that lived upon Italian light, Before I throw them and these words away, Who knows but I what memories too take flight? AT A MONTH'S END The night last night was strange and shaken: More strange the change of you and me. Once more, for the old love's love forsaken, We went out once more toward the sea. For the old love's love-sake dead and buried, One last time, one more and no more, We watched the waves set in, the serried Spears of the tide storming the shore. Hardly we saw the high moon hanging, Heard hardly through the windy night Far waters ringing, low reefs clanging, Under wan skies and waste white light. With chafe and change of surges chiming, The clashing channels rocked and rang Large music, wave to wild wave timing, And all the choral water sang. Faint lights fell this way, that way floated, Quick sparks of sea-fire keen like eyes From the rolled surf that flashed, and noted Shores and faint cliffs and bays and skies. The ghost of sea that shrank up sighing At the sand's edge, a short sad breath Trembling to touch the goal, and dying With weak heart heaved up once in death— The rustling sand and shingle shaken With light sweet touches and small sound— These could not move us, could not waken Hearts to look forth, eyes to look round. Silent we went an hour together, Under grey skies by waters white. Our hearts were full of windy weather, Clouds and blown stars and broken light. Full of cold clouds and moonbeams drifted And streaming storms and straying fires, Our souls in us were stirred and shifted By doubts and dreams and foiled desires. Across, aslant, a scudding sea-mew Swam, dipped, and dropped, and grazed the sea: And one with me I could not dream you; And one with you I could not be. As the white wing the white wave's fringes Touched and slid over and flashed past— As a pale cloud a pale flame tinges From the moon's lowest light and last— As a star feels the sun and falters, Touched to death by diviner eyes— As on the old gods' untended altars The old fire of withered worship dies— (Once only, once the shrine relighted Sees the last fiery shadow shine, Last shadow of flame and faith benighted, Sees falter and flutter and fail the shrine) So once with fiery breath and flying Your winged heart touched mine and went, And the swift spirits kissed, and sighing, Sundered and smiled and were content. That only touch, that feeling only, Enough we found, we found too much; For the unlit shrine is hardly lonely As one the old fire forgets to touch. Slight as the sea's sight of the sea-mew, Slight as the sun's sight of the star: Enough to show one must not deem you For love's sake other than you are. Who snares and tames with fear and danger A bright beast of a fiery kin, Only to mar, only to change her Sleek supple soul and splendid skin? Easy with blows to mar and maim her, Easy with bonds to bind and bruise; What profit, if she yield her tamer The limbs to mar, the soul to lose? Best leave or take the perfect creature, Take all she is or leave complete; Transmute you will not form or feature, Change feet for wings or wings for feet. Strange eyes, new limbs, can no man give her; Sweet is the sweet thing as it is. No soul she hath, we see, to outlive her; Hath she for that no lips to kiss? So may one read his weird, and reason, And with vain drugs assuage no pain. For each man in his loving season Fools and is fooled of these in vain. Charms that allay not any longing, Spells that appease not any grief, Time brings us all by handfuls, wronging All hurts with nothing of relief. Ah, too soon shot, the fool's bolt misses! What help? the world is full of loves; Night after night of running kisses, Chirp after chirp of changing doves. Should Love disown or disesteem you For loving one man more or less? You could not tame your light white sea-mew, Nor I my sleek black pantheress. For a new soul let whoso please pray, We are what life made us, and shall be. For you the jungle and me the sea-spray, And south for you and north for me. But this one broken foam-white feather I throw you off the hither wing, Splashed stiff with sea-scurf and salt weather, This song for sleep to learn and sing— Sing in your ear when, daytime over, You, couched at long length on hot sand With some sleek sun-discoloured lover, Wince from his breath as from a brand: Till the acrid hour aches out and ceases, And the sheathed eyeball sleepier swims, The deep flank smoothes its dimpling creases, And passion loosens all the limbs: Till dreams of sharp grey north-sea weather Fall faint upon your fiery sleep, As on strange sands a strayed bird's feather The wind may choose to lose or keep. But I, who leave my queen of panthers, As a tired honey-heavy bee Gilt with sweet dust from gold-grained anthers Leaves the rose-chalice, what for me? From the ardours of the chaliced centre, From the amorous anthers' golden grime, That scorch and smutch all wings that enter, I fly forth hot from honey-time. But as to a bee's gilt thighs and winglets The flower-dust with the flower-smell clings; As a snake's mobile rampant ringlets Leave the sand marked with print of rings; So to my soul in surer fashion Your savage stamp and savour hangs; The print and perfume of old passion, The wild-beast mark of panther's fangs. SESTINA I saw my soul at rest upon a day As a bird sleeping in the nest of night, Among soft leaves that give the starlight way To touch its wings but not its eyes with light; So that it knew as one in visions may, And knew not as men waking, of delight. This was the measure of my soul's delight; It had no power of joy to fly by day, Nor part in the large lordship of the light; But in a secret moon-beholden way Had all its will of dreams and pleasant night, And all the love and life that sleepers may. But such life's triumph as men waking may It might not have to feed its faint delight Between the stars by night and sun by day, Shut up with green leaves and a little light; Because its way was as a lost star's way, A world's not wholly known of day or night. All loves and dreams and sounds and gleams of night Made it all music that such minstrels may, And all they had they gave it of delight; But in the full face of the fire of day What place shall be for any starry light, What part of heaven in all the wide sun's way? Yet the soul woke not, sleeping by the way, Watched as a nursling of the large-eyed night, And sought no strength nor knowledge of the day, Nor closer touch conclusive of delight, Nor mightier joy nor truer than dreamers may, Nor more of song than they, nor more of light. For who sleeps once and sees the secret light Whereby sleep shows the soul a fairer way Between the rise and rest of day and night, Shall care no more to fare as all men may, But be his place of pain or of delight, There shall he dwell, beholding night as day. Song, have thy day and take thy fill of light Before the night be fallen across thy way; Sing while he may, man hath no long delight. THE YEAR OF THE ROSE From the depths of the green garden-closes Where the summer in darkness dozes Till autumn pluck from his hand An hour-glass that holds not a sand; From the maze that a flower-belt encloses To the stones and sea-grass on the strand How red was the reign of the roses Over the rose-crowned land! The year of the rose is brief; From the first blade blown to the sheaf, From the thin green leaf to the gold, It has time to be sweet and grow old, To triumph and leave not a leaf For witness in winter's sight How lovers once in the light Would mix their breath with its breath, And its spirit was quenched not of night, As love is subdued not of death. In the red-rose land not a mile Of the meadows from stile to stile, Of the valleys from stream to stream, But the air was a long sweet dream And the earth was a sweet wide smile Red-mouthed of a goddess, returned From the sea which had borne her and burned, That with one swift smile of her mouth Looked full on the north as it yearned, And the north was more than the south. For the north, when winter was long, In his heart had made him a song, And clothed it with wings of desire, And shod it with shoon as of fire, To carry the tale of his wrong To the south-west wind by the sea, That none might bear it but he To the ear of the goddess unknown Who waits till her time shall be To take the world for a throne. In the earth beneath, and above In the heaven where her name is love, She warms with light from her eyes The seasons of life as they rise, And her eyes are as eyes of a dove, But the wings that lift her and bear As an eagle's, and all her hair As fire by the wind's breath curled, And her passage is song through the air, And her presence is spring through the world. So turned she northward and came, And the white-thorn land was aflame With the fires that were shed from her feet, That the north, by her love made sweet, Should be called by a rose-red name; And a murmur was heard as of doves, And a music beginning of loves In the light that the roses made, Such light as the music loves, The music of man with maid. But the days drop one upon one, And a chill soft wind is begun In the heart of the rose-red maze That weeps for the roseleaf days And the reign of the rose undone That ruled so long in the light, And by spirit, and not by sight, Through the darkness thrilled with its breath, Still ruled in the viewless night, As love might rule over death. The time of lovers is brief; From the fair first joy to the grief That tells when love is grown old, From the warm wild kiss to the cold, From the red to the white-rose leaf, They have but a season to seem As roseleaves lost on a stream That part not and pass not apart As a spirit from dream to dream, As a sorrow from heart to heart. From the bloom and the gloom that encloses The death-bed of Love where he dozes Till a relic be left not of sand To the hour-glass that breaks in his hand; From the change in the grey garden-closes To the last stray grass of the strand, A rain and ruin of roses Over the red-rose land. A WASTED VIGIL I Couldst thou not watch with me one hour? Behold, Dawn skims the sea with flying feet of gold, With sudden feet that graze the gradual sea; Couldst thou not watch with me? II What, not one hour? for star by star the night Falls, and her thousands world by world take flight; They die, and day survives, and what of thee? Couldst thou not watch with me? III Lo, far in heaven the web of night undone, And on the sudden sea the gradual sun; Wave to wave answers, tree responds to tree; Couldst thou not watch with me? IV Sunbeam by sunbeam creeps from line to line, Foam by foam quickens on the brightening brine; Sail by sail passes, flower by flower gets free; Couldst thou not watch with me? V Last year, a brief while since, an age ago, A whole year past, with bud and bloom and snow, O moon that wast in heaven, what friends were we! Couldst thou not watch with me? VI Old moons, and last year's flowers, and last year's snows! Who now saith to thee, moon? or who saith, rose? O dust and ashes, once found fair to see! Couldst thou not watch with me? VII O dust and ashes, once thought sweet to smell! With me it is not, is it with thee well? O sea-drift blown from windward back to lee! Couldst thou not watch with me? VIII The old year's dead hands are full of their dead flowers, The old days are full of dead old loves of ours, Born as a rose, and briefer born than she; Couldst thou not watch with me? IX Could two days live again of that dead year, One would say, seeking us and passing here, Where is she? and one answering, Where is he? Couldst thou not watch with me? X Nay, those two lovers are not anywhere; If we were they, none knows us what we were, Nor aught of all their barren grief and glee. Couldst thou not watch with me? XI Half false, half fair, all feeble, be my verse Upon thee not for blessing nor for curse; For some must stand, and some must fall or flee; Couldst thou not watch with me? XII As a new moon above spent stars thou wast; But stars endure after the moon is past. Couldst thou not watch one hour, though I watch three? Couldst thou not watch with me? XIII What of the night? The night is full, the tide Storms inland, the most ancient rocks divide; Yet some endure, and bow nor head nor knee; Couldst thou not watch with me? XIV Since thou art not as these are, go thy ways; Thou hast no part in all my nights and days. Lie still, sleep on, be glad—as such things be; Thou couldst not watch with me. THE COMPLAINT OF LISA Decameron, x. 7 (Double Sestina) There is no woman living that draws breath So sad as I, though all things sadden her. There is not one upon life's weariest way Who is weary as I am weary of all but death. Toward whom I look as looks the sunflower All day with all his whole soul toward the sun; While in the sun's sight I make moan all day, And all night on my sleepless maiden bed Weep and call out on death, O Love, and thee, That thou or he would take me to the dead, And know not what thing evil I have done That life should lay such heavy hand on me. Alas, Love, what is this thou wouldst with me? What honour shalt thou have to quench my breath, Or what shall my heart broken profit thee? O Love, O great god Love, what have I done, That thou shouldst hunger so after my death? My heart is harmless as my life's first day: Seek out some false fair woman, and plague her Till her tears even as my tears fill her bed: I am the least flower in thy flowery way, But till my time be come that I be dead Let me live out my flower-time in the sun Though my leaves shut before the sunflower. O Love, Love, Love, the kingly sunflower! Shall he the sun hath looked on look on me, That live down here in shade, out of the sun, Here living in the sorrow and shadow of death? Shall he that feeds his heart full of the day Care to give mine eyes light, or my lips breath? Because she loves him shall my lord love her Who is as a worm in my lord's kingly way? I shall not see him or know him alive or dead; But thou, I know thee, O Love, and pray to thee That in brief while my brief life-days be done, And the worm quickly make my marriage-bed. For underground there is no sleepless bed: But here since I beheld my sunflower These eyes have slept not, seeing all night and day His sunlike eyes, and face fronting the sun. Wherefore if anywhere be any death, I would fain find and fold him fast to me, That I may sleep with the world's eldest dead, With her that died seven centuries since, and her That went last night down the night-wandering way. For this is sleep indeed, when labour is done, Without love, without dreams, and without breath, And without thought, O name unnamed! of thee. Ah, but, forgetting all things, shall I thee? Wilt thou not be as now about my bed There underground as here before the sun? Shall not thy vision vex me alive and dead, Thy moving vision without form or breath? I read long since the bitter tale of her Who read the tale of Launcelot on a day, And died, and had no quiet after death, But was moved ever along a weary way, Lost with her love in the underworld; ah me, O my king, O my lordly sunflower, Would God to me too such a thing were done! But if such sweet and bitter things be done, Then, flying from life, I shall not fly from thee. For in that living world without a sun Thy vision will lay hold upon me dead, And meet and mock me, and mar my peace in death. Yet if being wroth God had such pity on her, Who was a sinner and foolish in her day, That even in hell they twain should breathe one breath, Why should he not in some wise pity me? So if I sleep not in my soft strait bed I may look up and see my sunflower As he the sun, in some divine strange way. O poor my heart, well knowest thou in what way This sore sweet evil unto us was done. For on a holy and a heavy day I was arisen out of my still small bed To see the knights tilt, and one said to me “The king,” and seeing him, somewhat stopped my breath, And if the girl spake more, I heard not her, For only I saw what I shall see when dead, A kingly flower of knights, a sunflower, That shone against the sunlight like the sun, And like a fire, O heart, consuming thee, The fire of love that lights the pyre of death. Howbeit I shall not die an evil death Who have loved in such a sad and sinless way, That this my love, lord, was no shame to thee. So when mine eyes are shut against the sun, O my soul's sun, O the world's sunflower, Thou nor no man will quite despise me dead. And dying I pray with all my low last breath That thy whole life may be as was that day, That feast-day that made trothplight death and me, Giving the world light of thy great deeds done; And that fair face brightening thy bridal bed, That God be good as God hath been to her. That all things goodly and glad remain with her, All things that make glad life and goodly death; That as a bee sucks from a sunflower Honey, when summer draws delighted breath, Her soul may drink of thy soul in like way, And love make life a fruitful marriage-bed Where day may bring forth fruits of joy to day And night to night till days and nights be dead. And as she gives light of her love to thee, Give thou to her the old glory of days long done; And either give some heat of light to me, To warm me where I sleep without the sun. O sunflower made drunken with the sun, O knight whose lady's heart draws thine to her, Great king, glad lover, I have a word to thee. There is a weed lives out of the sun's way, Hid from the heat deep in the meadow's bed, That swoons and whitens at the wind's least breath, A flower star-shaped, that all a summer day Will gaze her soul out on the sunflower For very love till twilight finds her dead. But the great sunflower heeds not her poor death, Knows not when all her loving life is done; And so much knows my lord the king of me. Aye, all day long he has no eye for me; With golden eye following the golden sun From rose-coloured to purple-pillowed bed, From birthplace to the flame-lit place of death, From eastern end to western of his way. So mine eye follows thee, my sunflower, So the white star-flower turns and yearns to thee, The sick weak weed, not well alive or dead, Trod underfoot if any pass by her, Pale, without colour of summer or summer breath In the shrunk shuddering petals, that have done No work but love, and die before the day. But thou, to-day, to-morrow, and every day, Be glad and great, O love whose love slays me. Thy fervent flower made fruitful from the sun Shall drop its golden seed in the world's way, That all men thereof nourished shall praise thee For grain and flower and fruit of works well done; Till thy shed seed, O shining sunflower, Bring forth such growth of the world's garden-bed As like the sun shall outlive age and death. And yet I would thine heart had heed of her Who loves thee alive; but not till she be dead. Come, Love, then, quickly, and take her utmost breath. Song, speak for me who am dumb as are the dead; From my sad bed of tears I send forth thee, To fly all day from sun's birth to sun's death Down the sun's way after the flying sun, For love of her that gave thee wings and breath, Ere day be done, to seek the sunflower. FOR THE FEAST OF GIORDANO BRUNO, PHILOSOPHER AND MARTYR I Son of the lightning and the light that glows Beyond the lightning's or the morning's light, Soul splendid with all-righteous love of right, In whose keen fire all hopes and fears and woes Were clean consumed, and from their ashes rose Transfigured, and intolerable to sight Save of purged eyes whose lids had cast off night, In love's and wisdom's likeness when they close, Embracing, and between them truth stands fast, Embraced of either; thou whose feet were set On English earth while this was England yet, Our friend that art, our Sidney's friend that wast, Heart hardier found and higher than all men's past, Shall we not praise thee though thine own forget? II Lift up thy light on us and on thine own, O soul whose spirit on earth was as a rod To scourge off priests, a sword to pierce their God, A staff for man's free thought to walk alone, A lamp to lead him far from shrine and throne On ways untrodden where his fathers trod Ere earth's heart withered at a high priest's nod And all men's mouths that made not prayer made moan. From bonds and torments and the ravening flame Surely thy spirit of sense rose up to greet Lucretius, where such only spirits meet, And walk with him apart till Shelley came To make the heaven of heavens more heavenly sweet And mix with yours a third incorporate name. AVE ATQUE VALE IN MEMORY OF CHARLES BAUDELAIRE Nous devrions pourtant lui porter quelques fleurs; Les morts, les pauvres morts, ont de grandes douleurs, Et quand Octobre souffle, émondeur des vieux arbres, Son vent mélancolique à l'entour de leurs marbres, Certe, ils doivent trouver les vivants bien ingrats. Les Fleurs du Mal. I Shall I strew on thee rose or rue or laurel, Brother, on this that was the veil of thee? Or quiet sea-flower moulded by the sea, Or simplest growth of meadow-sweet or sorrel, Such as the summer-sleepy Dryads weave, Waked up by snow-soft sudden rains at eve? Or wilt thou rather, as on earth before, Half-faded fiery blossoms, pale with heat And full of bitter summer, but more sweet To thee than gleanings of a northern shore Trod by no tropic feet? II For always thee the fervid languid glories Allured of heavier suns in mightier skies; Thine ears knew all the wandering watery sighs Where the sea sobs round Lesbian promontories, The barren kiss of piteous wave to wave That knows not where is that Leucadian grave Which hides too deep the supreme head of song. Ah, salt and sterile as her kisses were, The wild sea winds her and the green gulfs bear Hither and thither, and vex and work her wrong, Blind gods that cannot spare. III Thou sawest, in thine old singing season, brother, Secrets and sorrows unbeheld of us: Fierce loves, and lovely leaf-buds poisonous, Bare to thy subtler eye, but for none other Blowing by night in some unbreathed-in clime; The hidden harvest of luxurious time, Sin without shape, and pleasure without speech; And where strange dreams in a tumultuous sleep Make the shut eyes of stricken spirits weep; And with each face thou sawest the shadow on each, Seeing as men sow men reap. IV O sleepless heart and sombre soul unsleeping, That were athirst for sleep and no more life And no more love, for peace and no more strife! Now the dim gods of death have in their keeping Spirit and body and all the springs of song, Is it well now where love can do no wrong, Where stingless pleasure has no foam or fang Behind the unopening closure of her lips? Is it not well where soul from body slips And flesh from bone divides without a pang As dew from flower-bell drips? V It is enough; the end and the beginning Are one thing to thee, who art past the end. O hand unclasped of unbeholden friend, For thee no fruits to pluck, no palms for winning, No triumph and no labour and no lust, Only dead yew-leaves and a little dust. O quiet eyes wherein the light saith nought, Whereto the day is dumb, nor any night With obscure finger silences your sight, Nor in your speech the sudden soul speaks thought, Sleep, and have sleep for light. VI Now all strange hours and all strange loves are over, Dreams and desires and sombre songs and sweet, Hast thou found place at the great knees and feet Of some pale Titan-woman like a lover, Such as thy vision here solicited, Under the shadow of her fair vast head, The deep division of prodigious breasts, The solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep, The weight of awful tresses that still keep The savour and shade of old-world pine-forests Where the wet hill-winds weep? VII Hast thou found any likeness for thy vision? O gardener of strange flowers, what bud, what bloom, Hast thou found sown, what gathered in the gloom? What of despair, of rapture, of derision, What of life is there, what of ill or good? Are the fruits grey like dust or bright like blood? Does the dim ground grow any seed of ours, The faint fields quicken any terrene root, In low lands where the sun and moon are mute And all the stars keep silence? Are there flowers At all, or any fruit? VIII Alas, but though my flying song flies after, O sweet strange elder singer, thy more fleet Singing, and footprints of thy fleeter feet, Some dim derision of mysterious laughter From the blind tongueless warders of the dead, Some gainless glimpse of Proserpine's veiled head, Some little sound of unregarded tears Wept by effaced unprofitable eyes, And from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs— These only, these the hearkening spirit hears, Sees only such things rise. IX Thou art far too far for wings of words to follow, Far too far off for thought or any prayer. What ails us with thee, who art wind and air? What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow? Yet with some fancy, yet with some desire, Dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire, Our dreams pursue our dead and do not find. Still, and more swift than they, the thin flame flies, The low light fails us in elusive skies, Still the foiled earnest ear is deaf, and blind Are still the eluded eyes. X Not thee, O never thee, in all time's changes, Not thee, but this the sound of thy sad soul, The shadow of thy swift spirit, this shut scroll I lay my hand on, and not death estranges My spirit from communion of thy song— These memories and these melodies that throng Veiled porches of a Muse funereal— These I salute, these touch, these clasp and fold As though a hand were in my hand to hold, Or through mine ears a mourning musical Of many mourners rolled. XI I among these, I also, in such station As when the pyre was charred, and piled the sods, And offering to the dead made, and their gods, The old mourners had, standing to make libation, I stand, and to the gods and to the dead Do reverence without prayer or praise, and shed Offering to these unknown, the gods of gloom, And what of honey and spice my seedlands bear, And what I may of fruits in this chilled air, And lay, Orestes-like, across the tomb A curl of severed hair. XII But by no hand nor any treason stricken, Not like the low-lying head of Him, the King, The flame that made of Troy a ruinous thing, Thou liest, and on this dust no tears could quicken There fall no tears like theirs that all men hear Fall tear by sweet imperishable tear Down the opening leaves of holy poets' pages. Thee not Orestes, not Electra mourns; But bending us-ward with memorial urns The most high Muses that fulfil all ages Weep, and our God's heart yearns. XIII For, sparing of his sacred strength, not often Among us darkling here the lord of light Makes manifest his music and his might In hearts that open and in lips that soften With the soft flame and heat of songs that shine. Thy lips indeed he touched with bitter wine, And nourished them indeed with bitter bread; Yet surely from his hand thy soul's food came, The fire that scarred thy spirit at his flame Was lighted, and thine hungering heart he fed Who feeds our hearts with fame. XIV Therefore he too now at thy soul's sunsetting, God of all suns and songs, he too bends down To mix his laurel with thy cypress crown, And save thy dust from blame and from forgetting. Therefore he too, seeing all thou wert and art, Compassionate, with sad and sacred heart, Mourns thee of many his children the last dead, And hallows with strange tears and alien sighs Thine unmelodious mouth and sunless eyes, And over thine irrevocable head Sheds light from the under skies. XV And one weeps with him in the ways Lethean, And stains with tears her changing bosom chill: That obscure Venus of the hollow hill, That thing transformed which was the Cytherean, With lips that lost their Grecian laugh divine Long since, and face no more called Erycine; A ghost, a bitter and luxurious god. Thee also with fair flesh and singing spell Did she, a sad and second prey, compel Into the footless places once more trod, And shadows hot from hell. XVI And now no sacred staff shall break in blossom, No choral salutation lure to light A spirit sick with perfume and sweet night And love's tired eyes and hands and barren bosom. There is no help for these things; none to mend And none to mar; not all our songs, O friend, Will make death clear or make life durable. Howbeit with rose and ivy and wild vine And with wild notes about this dust of thine At least I fill the place where white dreams dwell And wreathe an unseen shrine. XVII Sleep; and if life was bitter to thee, pardon, If sweet, give thanks; thou hast no more to live; And to give thanks is good, and to forgive. Out of the mystic and the mournful garden Where all day through thine hands in barren braid Wove the sick flowers of secrecy and shade, Green buds of sorrow and sin, and remnants grey, Sweet-smelling, pale with poison, sanguine-hearted, Passions that sprang from sleep and thoughts that started, Shall death not bring us all as thee one day Among the days departed? XVIII For thee, O now a silent soul, my brother, Take at my hands this garland, and farewell. Thin is the leaf, and chill the wintry smell, And chill the solemn earth, a fatal mother, With sadder than the Niobean womb, And in the hollow of her breasts a tomb. Content thee, howsoe'er, whose days are done; There lies not any troublous thing before, Nor sight nor sound to war against thee more, For whom all winds are quiet as the sun, All waters as the shore. MEMORIAL VERSES ON THE DEATH OF THÉOPHILE GAUTIER Death, what hast thou to do with me? So saith Love, with eyes set against the face of Death; What have I done, O thou strong Death, to thee, That mine own lips should wither from thy breath? Though thou be blind as fire or as the sea, Why should thy waves and storms make war on me? Is it for hate thou hast to find me fair, Or for desire to kiss, if it might be, My very mouth of song, and kill me there? So with keen rains vexing his crownless hair, With bright feet bruised from no delightful way, Through darkness and the disenchanted air, Lost Love went weeping half a winter's day. And the armèd wind that smote him seemed to say, How shall the dew live when the dawn is fled, Or wherefore should the Mayflower outlast May? Then Death took Love by the right hand and said, Smiling: Come now and look upon thy dead. But Love cast down the glories of his eyes, And bowed down like a flower his flowerless head. And Death spake, saying: What ails thee in such wise, Being god, to shut thy sight up from the skies? If thou canst see not, hast thou ears to hear? Or is thy soul too as a leaf that dies? Even as he spake with fleshless lips of fear, But soft as sleep sings in a tired man's ear, Behold, the winter was not, and its might Fell, and fruits broke forth of the barren year. And upon earth was largess of great light, And moving music winged for worldwide flight, And shapes and sounds of gods beheld and heard, And day's foot set upon the neck of night. And with such song the hollow ways were stirred As of a god's heart hidden in a bird, Or as the whole soul of the sun in spring Should find full utterance in one flower-soft word, And all the season should break forth and sing From one flower's lips, in one rose triumphing; Such breath and light of song as of a flame Made ears and spirits of them that heard it ring. And Love beholding knew not for the same The shape that led him, nor in face nor name, For he was bright and great of thews and fair, And in Love's eyes he was not Death, but Fame. Not that grey ghost whose life is empty and bare And his limbs moulded out of mortal air, A cloud of change that shifts into a shower And dies and leaves no light for time to wear: But a god clothed with his own joy and power, A god re-risen out of his mortal hour Immortal, king and lord of time and space, With eyes that look on them as from a tower. And where he stood the pale sepulchral place Bloomed, as new life might in a bloodless face, And where men sorrowing came to seek a tomb With funeral flowers and tears for grief and grace, They saw with light as of a world in bloom The portal of the House of Fame illume The ways of life wherein we toiling tread, And watched the darkness as a brand consume. And through the gates where rule the deathless dead The sound of a new singer's soul was shed That sang among his kinsfolk, and a beam Shot from the star on a new ruler's head. A new star lighting the Lethean stream, A new song mixed into the song supreme Made of all souls of singers and their might, That makes of life and time and death a dream. Thy star, thy song, O soul that in our sight Wast as a sun that made for man's delight Flowers and all fruits in season, being so near The sun-god's face, our god that gives us light. To him of all gods that we love or fear Thou amongst all men by thy name wast dear, Dear to the god that gives us spirit of song To bind and burn all hearts of men that hear. The god that makes men's words too sweet and strong For life or time or death to do them wrong, Who sealed with his thy spirit for a sign And filled it with his breath thy whole life long. Who made thy moist lips fiery with new wine Pressed from the grapes of song, the sovereign vine, And with all love of all things loveliest Gave thy soul power to make them more divine. That thou might'st breathe upon the breathless rest Of marble, till the brows and lips and breast Felt fall from off them as a cancelled curse That speechless sleep wherewith they lived opprest. Who gave thee strength and heat of spirit to pierce All clouds of form and colour that disperse, And leave the spirit of beauty to remould In types of clean chryselephantine verse. Who gave thee words more golden than fine gold To carve in shapes more glorious than of old, And build thy songs up in the sight of time As statues set in godhead manifold: In sight and scorn of temporal change and clime That meet the sun re-risen with refluent rhyme —As god to god might answer face to face— From lips whereon the morning strikes sublime. Dear to the god, our god who gave thee place Among the chosen of days, the royal race, The lords of light, whose eyes of old and ears Saw even on earth and heard him for a space. There are the souls of those once mortal years That wrought with fire of joy and light of tears In words divine as deeds that grew thereof Such music as he swoons with love who hears. There are the lives that lighten from above Our under lives, the spheral souls that move Through the ancient heaven of song-illumined air Whence we that hear them singing die with love. There all the crowned Hellenic heads, and there The old gods who made men godlike as they were, The lyric lips wherefrom all songs take fire, Live eyes, and light of Apollonian hair. There, round the sovereign passion of that lyre Which the stars hear and tremble with desire, The ninefold light Pierian is made one That here we see divided, and aspire, Seeing, after this or that crown to be won; But where they hear the singing of the sun, All form, all sound, all colour, and all thought Are as one body and soul in unison. There the song sung shines as a picture wrought, The painted mouths sing that on earth say nought, The carven limbs have sense of blood and growth And large-eyed life that seeks nor lacks not aught. There all the music of thy living mouth Lives, and all loves wrought of thine hand in youth And bound about the breasts and brows with gold And coloured pale or dusk from north or south. Fair living things made to thy will of old, Born of thy lips, no births of mortal mould, That in the world of song about thee wait Where thought and truth are one and manifold. Within the graven lintels of the gate That here divides our vision and our fate, The dreams we walk in and the truths of sleep, All sense and spirit have life inseparate. There what one thinks, is his to grasp and keep; There are no dreams, but very joys to reap, No foiled desires that die before delight, No fears to see across our joys and weep. There hast thou all thy will of thought and sight, All hope for harvest, and all heaven for flight; The sunrise of whose golden-mouthed glad head To paler songless ghosts was heat and light. Here where the sunset of our year is red Men think of thee as of the summer dead, Gone forth before the snows, before thy day, With unshod feet, with brows unchapleted. Couldst thou not wait till age had wound, they say, Round those wreathed brows his soft white blossoms? Nay, Why shouldst thou vex thy soul with this harsh air, Thy bright-winged soul, once free to take its way? Nor for men's reverence hadst thou need to wear The holy flower of grey time-hallowed hair; Nor were it fit that aught of thee grew old, Fair lover all thy days of all things fair. And hear we not thy words of molten gold Singing? or is their light and heat acold Whereat men warmed their spirits? Nay, for all These yet are with us, ours to hear and hold. The lovely laughter, the clear tears, the call Of love to love on ways where shadows fall, Through doors of dim division and disguise, And music made of doubts unmusical; The love that caught strange light from death's own eyes, La Morte Amoureuse. And filled death's lips with fiery words and sighs, And half asleep let feed from veins of his Her close red warm snake's mouth, Egyptian-wise: And that great night of love more strange than this, Une Nuit de Cléopâtre. When she that made the whole world's bale and bliss Made king of all the world's desire a slave, And killed him in mid kingdom with a kiss; Veiled loves that shifted shapes and shafts, and gave, Mademoiselle de Maupin. Laughing, strange gifts to hands that durst not crave, Flowers double-blossomed, fruits of scent and hue Sweet as the bride-bed, stranger than the grave; All joys and wonders of old lives and new That ever in love's shine or shadow grew, And all the grief whereof he dreams and grieves, And all sweet roots fed on his light and dew; All these through thee our spirit of sense perceives, As threads in the unseen woof thy music weaves, Birds caught and snared that fill our ears with thee, Bay-blossoms in thy wreath of brow-bound leaves. Mixed with the masque of death's old comedy Though thou too pass, have here our flowers, that we For all the flowers thou gav'st upon thee shed, And pass not crownless to Persephone. Blue lotus-blooms and white and rosy-red We wind with poppies for thy silent head, And on this margin of the sundering sea Leave thy sweet light to rise upon the dead. SONNET (WITH A COPY OF Mademoiselle de Maupin) This is the golden book of spirit and sense, The holy writ of beauty; he that wrought Made it with dreams and faultless words and thought That seeks and finds and loses in the dense Dim air of life that beauty's excellence Wherewith love makes one hour of life distraught And all hours after follow and find not aught. Here is that height of all love's eminence Where man may breathe but for a breathing-space And feel his soul burn as an altar-fire To the unknown God of unachieved desire, And from the middle mystery of the place Watch lights that break, hear sounds as of a quire, But see not twice unveiled the veiled God's face. AGE AND SONG (TO BARRY CORNWALL) I In vain men tell us time can alter Old loves or make old memories falter, That with the old year the old year's life closes. The old dew still falls on the old sweet flowers, The old sun revives the new-fledged hours, The old summer rears the new-born roses. II Much more a Muse that bears upon her Raiment and wreath and flower of honour, Gathered long since and long since woven, Fades not or falls as fall the vernal Blossoms that bear no fruit eternal, By summer or winter charred or cloven. III No time casts down, no time upraises, Such loves, such memories, and such praises, As need no grace of sun or shower, No saving screen from frost or thunder To tend and house around and under The imperishable and fearless flower. IV Old thanks, old thoughts, old aspirations, Outlive men's lives and lives of nations, Dead, but for one thing which survives— The inalienable and unpriced treasure, The old joy of power, the old pride of pleasure, That lives in light above men's lives. IN MEMORY OF BARRY CORNWALL (October 4, 1874) I In the garden of death, where the singers whose names are deathless One with another make music unheard of men, Where the dead sweet roses fade not of lips long breathless, And the fair eyes shine that shall weep not or change again, Who comes now crowned with the blossom of snow-white years? What music is this that the world of the dead men hears? II Beloved of men, whose words on our lips were honey, Whose name in our ears and our fathers' ears was sweet, Like summer gone forth of the land his songs made sunny, To the beautiful veiled bright world where the glad ghosts meet, Child, father, bridegroom and bride, and anguish and rest, No soul shall pass of a singer than this more blest. III Blest for the years' sweet sake that were filled and brightened, As a forest with birds, with the fruit and the flower of his song; For the souls' sake blest that heard, and their cares were lightened, For the hearts' sake blest that have fostered his name so long; By the living and dead lips blest that have loved his name, And clothed with their praise and crowned with their love for fame. IV Ah, fair and fragrant his fame as flowers that close not, That shrink not by day for heat or for cold by night, As a thought in the heart shall increase when the heart's self knows not, Shall endure in our ears as a sound, in our eyes as a light; Shall wax with the years that wane and the seasons' chime, As a white rose thornless that grows in the garden of time. V The same year calls, and one goes hence with another, And men sit sad that were glad for their sweet song's sake; The same year beckons, and elder with younger brother Takes mutely the cup from his hand that we all shall take. Sydney Dobell died August 22, 1874. They pass ere the leaves be past or the snows be come; And the birds are loud, but the lips that outsang them dumb. VI Time takes them home that we loved, fair names and famous, To the soft long sleep, to the broad sweet bosom of death; But the flower of their souls he shall take not away to shame us, Nor the lips lack song for ever that now lack breath. For with us shall the music and perfume that die not dwell, Though the dead to our dead bid welcome, and we farewell. EPICEDE (James Lorimer Graham died at Florence, April 30, 1876) Life may give for love to death Little; what are life's gifts worth To the dead wrapt round with earth? Yet from lips of living breath Sighs or words we are fain to give, All that yet, while yet we live, Life may give for love to death. Dead so long before his day, Passed out of the Italian sun To the dark where all is done, Fallen upon the verge of May; Here at life's and April's end How should song salute my friend Dead so long before his day? Not a kindlier life or sweeter Time, that lights and quenches men, Now may quench or light again, Mingling with the mystic metre Woven of all men's lives with his Not a clearer note than this, Not a kindlier life or sweeter. In this heavenliest part of earth He that living loved the light, Light and song, may rest aright, One in death, if strange in birth, With the deathless dead that make Life the lovelier for their sake In this heavenliest part of earth. Light, and song, and sleep at last— Struggling hands and suppliant knees Get no goodlier gift than these. Song that holds remembrance fast, Light that lightens death, attend Round their graves who have to friend Light, and song, and sleep at last. TO VICTOR HUGO He had no children, who for love of men, Being God, endured of Gods such things as thou, Father; nor on his thunder-beaten brow Fell such a woe as bows thine head again, Twice bowed before, though godlike, in man's ken, And seen too high for any stroke to bow Save this of some strange God's that bends it now The third time with such weight as bruised it then. Fain would grief speak, fain utter for love's sake Some word; but comfort who might bid thee take? What God in your own tongue shall talk with thee, Showing how all souls that look upon the sun Shall be for thee one spirit and thy son And thy soul's child the soul of man to be? January 3, 1876. INFERIAE Spring, and the light and sound of things on earth Requickening, all within our green sea's girth; A time of passage or a time of birth Fourscore years since as this year, first and last. The sun is all about the world we see, The breath and strength of very spring; and we Live, love, and feed on our own hearts; but he Whose heart fed mine has passed into the past. Past, all things born with sense and blood and breath; The flesh hears nought that now the spirit saith. If death be like as birth and birth as death, The first was fair—more fair should be the last. Fourscore years since, and come but one month more The count were perfect of his mortal score Whose sail went seaward yesterday from shore To cross the last of many an unsailed sea. Light, love and labour up to life's last height, These three were stars unsetting in his sight; Even as the sun is life and heat and light And sets not nor is dark when dark are we. The life, the spirit, and the work were one That here—ah, who shall say, that here are done? Not I, that know not; father, not thy son, For all the darkness of the night and sea. March 5, 1877 A BIRTH-SONG (For Olivia Frances Madox Rossetti, born September 20, 1875) Out of the dark sweet sleep Where no dreams laugh or weep Borne through bright gates of birth Into the dim sweet light Where day still dreams of night While heaven takes form on earth, White rose of spirit and flesh, red lily of love, What note of song have we Fit for the birds and thee, Fair nestling couched beneath the mother-dove? Nay, in some more divine Small speechless song of thine Some news too good for words, Heart-hushed and smiling, we Might hope to have of thee, The youngest of God's birds, If thy sweet sense might mix itself with ours, If ours might understand The language of thy land, Ere thine become the tongue of mortal hours: Ere thy lips learn too soon Their soft first human tune, Sweet, but less sweet than now, And thy raised eyes to read Glad and good things indeed, But none so sweet as thou: Ere thought lift up their flower-soft lids to see What life and love on earth Bring thee for gifts at birth, But none so good as thine who hast given us thee: Now, ere thy sense forget The heaven that fills it yet, Now, sleeping or awake, If thou couldst tell, or we Ask and be heard of thee, For love's undying sake, From thy dumb lips divine and bright mute speech Such news might touch our ear That then would burn to hear Too high a message now for man's to reach. Ere the gold hair of corn Had withered wast thou born, To make the good time glad; The time that but last year Fell colder than a tear On hearts and hopes turned sad, High hopes and hearts requickening in thy dawn, Even theirs whose life-springs, child, Filled thine with life and smiled, But then wept blood for half their own withdrawn. Oliver Madox Brown died November 5, 1874, in his twentieth year. If death and birth be one, And set with rise of sun, And truth with dreams divine, Some word might come with thee From over the still sea Deep hid in shade or shine, Crossed by the crossing sails of death and birth, Word of some sweet new thing Fit for such lips to bring, Some word of love, some afterthought of earth. If love be strong as death, By what so natural breath As thine could this be said? By what so lovely way Could love send word to say He lives and is not dead? Such word alone were fit for only thee, If his and thine have met Where spirits rise and set, His whom we see not, thine whom scarce we see: His there new-born, as thou New-born among us now; His, here so fruitful-souled, Now veiled and silent here, Now dumb as thou last year, A ghost of one year old: If lights that change their sphere in changing meet, Some ray might his not give To thine who wast to live, And make thy present with his past life sweet? Let dreams that laugh or weep, All glad and sad dreams, sleep; Truth more than dreams is dear. Let thoughts that change and fly, Sweet thoughts and swift, go by; More than all thought is here. More than all hope can forge or memory feign The life that in our eyes, Made out of love's life, lies, And flower-like fed with love for sun and rain. Twice royal in its root The sweet small olive-shoot Here set in sacred earth; Twice dowered with glorious grace From either heaven-born race First blended in its birth; Fair God or Genius of so fair an hour, For love of either name Twice crowned, with love and fame, Guard and be gracious to the fair-named flower. October 19, 1875. EX-VOTO When their last hour shall rise Pale on these mortal eyes, Herself like one that dies, And kiss me dying The cold last kiss, and fold Close round my limbs her cold Soft shade as raiment rolled And leave them lying, If aught my soul would say Might move to hear me pray The birth-god of my day That he might hearken, This grace my heart should crave, To find no landward grave That worldly springs make brave, World's winters darken, Nor grow through gradual hours The cold blind seed of flowers Made by new beams and showers From limbs that moulder, Nor take my part with earth, But find for death's new birth A bed of larger girth, More chaste and colder. Not earth's for spring and fall, Not earth's at heart, not all Earth's making, though men call Earth only mother, Not hers at heart she bare Me, but thy child, O fair Sea, and thy brother's care, The wind thy brother. Yours was I born, and ye, The sea-wind and the sea, Made all my soul in me A song for ever, A harp to string and smite For love's sake of the bright Wind and the sea's delight, To fail them never: Not while on this side death I hear what either saith And drink of either's breath With heart's thanksgiving That in my veins like wine Some sharp salt blood of thine, Some springtide pulse of brine, Yet leaps up living. When thy salt lips wellnigh Sucked in my mouth's last sigh, Grudged I so much to die This death as others? Was it no ease to think The chalice from whose brink Fate gave me death to drink Was thine—my mother's? Thee too, the all-fostering earth, Fair as thy fairest birth, More than thy worthiest worth, We call, we know thee, More sweet and just and dread Than live men highest of head Or even thy holiest dead Laid low below thee. The sunbeam on the sheaf, The dewfall on the leaf, All joy, all grace, all grief, Are thine for giving; Of thee our loves are born, Our lives and loves, that mourn And triumph; tares with corn, Dead seed with living: All good and ill things done In eyeshot of the sun At last in thee made one Rest well contented; All words of all man's breath And works he doth or saith, All wholly done to death, None long lamented. A slave to sons of thee, Thou, seeming, yet art free: But who shall make the sea Serve even in seeming? What plough shall bid it bear Seed to the sun and the air, Fruit for thy strong sons' fare, Fresh wine's foam streaming? What oldworld son of thine, Made drunk with death as wine, Hath drunk the bright sea's brine With lips of laughter? Thy blood they drink; but he Who hath drunken of the sea Once deeplier than of thee Shall drink not after. Of thee thy sons of men Drink deep, and thirst again; For wine in feasts, and then In fields for slaughter; But thirst shall touch not him Who hath felt with sense grown dim Rise, covering lip and limb, The wan sea's water. All fire of thirst that aches The salt sea cools and slakes More than all springs or lakes, Freshets or shallows; Wells where no beam can burn Through frondage of the fern That hides from hart and hern The haunt it hallows. Peace with all graves on earth For death or sleep or birth Be alway, one in worth One with another; But when my time shall be, O mother, O my sea, Alive or dead, take me, Me too, my mother. A BALLAD OF DREAMLAND I hid my heart in a nest of roses, Out of the sun's way, hidden apart; In a softer bed than the soft white snow's is, Under the roses I hid my heart. Why would it sleep not? why should it start, When never a leaf of the rose-tree stirred? What made sleep flutter his wings and part? Only the song of a secret bird. Lie still, I said, for the wind's wing closes, And mild leaves muffle the keen sun's dart; Lie still, for the wind on the warm sea dozes, And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art. Does a thought in thee still as a thorn's wound smart? Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred? What bids the lids of thy sleep dispart? Only the song of a secret bird. The green land's name that a charm encloses, It never was writ in the traveller's chart, And sweet on its trees as the fruit that grows is, It never was sold in the merchant's mart. The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart, And sleep's are the tunes in its tree-tops heard; No hound's note wakens the wildwood hart, Only the song of a secret bird. ENVOI In the world of dreams I have chosen my part, To sleep for a season and hear no word Of true love's truth or of light love's art, Only the song of a secret bird. CYRIL TOURNEUR A sea that heaves with horror of the night, As maddened by the moon that hangs aghast With strain and torment of the ravening blast, Haggard as hell, a bleak blind bloody light; No shore but one red reef of rock in sight, Whereon the waifs of many a wreck were cast And shattered in the fierce nights overpast Wherein more souls toward hell than heaven took flight; And 'twixt the shark-toothed rocks and swallowing shoals A cry as out of hell from all these souls Sent through the sheer gorge of the slaughtering sea, Whose thousand throats, full-fed with life by death, Fill the black air with foam and furious breath; And over all these one star—Chastity. A BALLAD OF FRANÇOIS VILLON PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS Bird of the bitter bright grey golden morn Scarce risen upon the dusk of dolorous years, First of us all and sweetest singer born Whose far shrill note the world of new men hears Cleave the cold shuddering shade as twilight clears; When song new-born put off the old world's attire And felt its tune on her changed lips expire, Writ foremost on the roll of them that came Fresh girt for service of the latter lyre, Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name! Alas the joy, the sorrow, and the scorn, That clothed thy life with hopes and sins and fears, And gave thee stones for bread and tares for corn And plume-plucked gaol-birds for thy starveling peers Till death clipt close their flight with shameful shears; Till shifts came short and loves were hard to hire, When lilt of song nor twitch of twangling wire Could buy thee bread or kisses; when light fame Spurned like a ball and haled through brake and briar, Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name! Poor splendid wings so frayed and soiled and torn! Poor kind wild eyes so dashed with light quick tears! Poor perfect voice, most blithe when most forlorn, That rings athwart the sea whence no man steers Like joy-bells crossed with death-bells in our ears! What far delight has cooled the fierce desire That like some ravenous bird was strong to tire On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame, But left more sweet than roses to respire, Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name? ENVOI Prince of sweet songs made out of tears and fire, A harlot was thy nurse, a God thy sire; Shame soiled thy song, and song assoiled thy shame. But from thy feet now death has washed the mire, Love reads out first at head of all our quire, Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name. PASTICHE [Now the days are all gone over] Now the days are all gone over Of our singing, love by lover, Days of summer-coloured seas Blown adrift through beam and breeze. Now the nights are all past over Of our dreaming, dreams that hover In a mist of fair false things, Nights afloat on wide wan wings. Now the loves with faith for mother, Now the fears with hope for brother, Scarce are with us as strange words, Notes from songs of last year's birds. Now all good that comes or goes is As the smell of last year's roses, As the radiance in our eyes Shot from summer's ere he dies. Now the morning faintlier risen Seems no God come forth of prison, But a bird of plume-plucked wing, Pale with thoughts of evening. Now hath hope, outraced in running, Given the torch up of his cunning And the palm he thought to wear Even to his own strong child—despair. BEFORE SUNSET In the lower lands of day On the hither side of night, There is nothing that will stay, There are all things soft to sight; Lighted shade and shadowy light In the wayside and the way, Hours the sun has spared to smite, Flowers the rain has left to play. Shall these hours run down and say No good thing of thee and me? Time that made us and will slay Laughs at love in me and thee; But if here the flowers may see One whole hour of amorous breath, Time shall die, and love shall be Lord as time was over death. SONG [Love laid his sleepless head] Love laid his sleepless head On a thorny rosy bed; And his eyes with tears were red, And pale his lips as the dead. And fear and sorrow and scorn Kept watch by his head forlorn, Till the night was overworn And the world was merry with morn. And Joy came up with the day And kissed Love's lips as he lay, And the watchers ghostly and grey Sped from his pillow away. And his eyes as the dawn grew bright, And his lips waxed ruddy as light: Sorrow may reign for a night, But day shall bring back delight. A VISION OF SPRING IN WINTER I O tender time that love thinks long to see, Sweet foot of spring that with her footfall sows Late snowlike flowery leavings of the snows, Be not too long irresolute to be; O mother-month, where have they hidden thee? Out of the pale time of the flowerless rose I reach my heart out toward the springtime lands, I stretch my spirit forth to the fair hours, The purplest of the prime; I lean my soul down over them, with hands Made wide to take the ghostly growths of flowers; I send my love back to the lovely time. II Where has the greenwood hid thy gracious head? Veiled with what visions while the grey world grieves, Or muffled with what shadows of green leaves, What warm intangible green shadows spread To sweeten the sweet twilight for thy bed? What sleep enchants thee? what delight deceives? Where the deep dreamlike dew before the dawn Feels not the fingers of the sunlight yet Its silver web unweave, Thy footless ghost on some unfooted lawn Whose air the unrisen sunbeams fear to fret Lives a ghost's life of daylong dawn and eve. III Sunrise it sees not, neither set of star, Large nightfall, nor imperial plenilune, Nor strong sweet shape of the full-breasted noon; But where the silver-sandalled shadows are, Too soft for arrows of the sun to mar, Moves with the mild gait of an ungrown moon: Hard overhead the half-lit crescent swims, The tender-coloured night draws hardly breath, The light is listening; They watch the dawn of slender-shapen limbs, Virginal, born again of doubtful death, Chill foster-father of the weanling spring. IV As sweet desire of day before the day, As dreams of love before the true love born, From the outer edge of winter overworn The ghost arisen of May before the May Takes through dim air her unawakened way, The gracious ghost of morning risen ere morn. With little unblown breasts and child-eyed looks Following, the very maid, the girl-child spring, Lifts windward her bright brows, Dips her light feet in warm and moving brooks, And kindles with her own mouth's colouring The fearful firstlings of the plumeless boughs. V I seek thee sleeping, and awhile I see, Fair face that art not, how thy maiden breath Shall put at last the deadly days to death And fill the fields and fire the woods with thee And seaward hollows where my feet would be When heaven shall hear the word that April saith To change the cold heart of the weary time, To stir and soften all the time to tears, Tears joyfuller than mirth; As even to May's clear height the young days climb With feet not swifter than those fair first years Whose flowers revive not with thy flowers on earth. VI I would not bid thee, though I might, give back One good thing youth has given and borne away; I crave not any comfort of the day That is not, nor on time's retrodden track Would turn to meet the white-robed hours or black That long since left me on their mortal way; Nor light nor love that has been, nor the breath That comes with morning from the sun to be And sets light hope on fire; No fruit, no flower thought once too fair for death, No flower nor hour once fallen from life's green tree, No leaf once plucked or once fulfilled desire. VII The morning song beneath the stars that fled With twilight through the moonless mountain air, While youth with burning lips and wreathless hair Sang toward the sun that was to crown his head, Rising; the hopes that triumphed and fell dead, The sweet swift eyes and songs of hours that were; These may'st thou not give back for ever; these, As at the sea's heart all her wrecks lie waste, Lie deeper than the sea; But flowers thou may'st, and winds, and hours of ease, And all its April to the world thou may'st Give back, and half my April back to me. CHORIAMBICS Love, what ailed thee to leave life that was made lovely, we thought, with love? What sweet visions of sleep lured thee away, down from the light above? What strange faces of dreams, voices that called, hands that were raised to wave, Lured or led thee, alas, out of the sun, down to the sunless grave? Ah, thy luminous eyes! once was their light fed with the fire of day; Now their shadowy lids cover them close, hush them and hide away. Ah, thy snow-coloured hands! once were they chains, mighty to bind me fast; Now no blood in them burns, mindless of love, senseless of passion past. Ah, thy beautiful hair! so was it once braided for me, for me; Now for death is it crowned, only for death, lover and lord of thee. Sweet, the kisses of death set on thy lips, colder are they than mine; Colder surely than past kisses that love poured for thy lips as wine. Lov'st thou death? is his face fairer than love's, brighter to look upon? Seest thou light in his eyes, light by which love's pales and is overshone? Lo the roses of death, grey as the dust, chiller of leaf than snow! Why let fall from thy hand love's that were thine, roses that loved thee so? Large red lilies of love, sceptral and tall, lovely for eyes to see; Thornless blossom of love, full of the sun, fruits that were reared for thee. Now death's poppies alone circle thy hair, girdle thy breasts as white; Bloodless blossoms of death, leaves that have sprung never against the light. Nay then, sleep if thou wilt; love is content; what should he do to weep? Sweet was love to thee once; now in thine eyes sweeter than love is sleep. AT PARTING For a day and a night Love sang to us, played with us, Folded us round from the dark and the light; And our hearts were fulfilled of the music he made with us, Made with our hearts and our lips while he stayed with us, Stayed in mid passage his pinions from flight For a day and a night. From his foes that kept watch with his wings had he hidden us, Covered us close from the eyes that would smite, From the feet that had tracked and the tongues that had chidden us Sheltering in shade of the myrtles forbidden us Spirit and flesh growing one with delight For a day and a night. But his wings will not rest and his feet will not stay for us: Morning is here in the joy of its might; With his breath has he sweetened a night and a day for us; Now let him pass, and the myrtles make way for us; Love can but last in us here at his height For a day and a night. A SONG IN SEASON I Thou whose beauty Knows no duty Due to love that moves thee never; Thou whose mercies Are men's curses, And thy smile a scourge for ever; II Thou that givest Death and livest On the death of thy sweet giving; Thou that sparest Not nor carest Though thy scorn leave no love living; III Thou whose rootless Flower is fruitless As the pride its heart encloses, But thine eyes are As May skies are, And thy words like spoken roses; IV Thou whose grace is In men's faces Fierce and wayward as thy will is; Thou whose peerless Eyes are tearless, And thy thoughts as cold sweet lilies; V Thou that takest Hearts and makest Wrecks of loves to strew behind thee, Whom the swallow Sure should follow, Finding summer where we find thee; VI Thou that wakest Hearts and breakest, And thy broken hearts forgive thee, That wilt make no Pause and take no Gift that love for love might give thee; VII Thou that bindest Eyes and blindest, Serving worst who served thee longest; Thou that speakest, And the weakest Heart is his that was the strongest; VIII Take in season Thought with reason; Think what gifts are ours for giving; Hear what beauty Owes of duty To the love that keeps it living. IX Dust that covers Long dead lovers Song blows off with breath that brightens; At its flashes Their white ashes Burst in bloom that lives and lightens. X Had they bent not Head or lent not Ear to love and amorous duties, Song had never Saved for ever, Love, the least of all their beauties. XI All the golden Names of olden Women yet by men's love cherished, All our dearest Thoughts hold nearest, Had they loved not, all had perished. XII If no fruit is Of thy beauties, Tell me yet, since none may win them, What and wherefore Love should care for Of all good things hidden in them? XIII Pain for profit Comes but of it, If the lips that lure their lover's Hold no treasure Past the measure Of the lightest hour that hovers. XIV If they give not Or forgive not Gifts or thefts for grace or guerdon, Love that misses Fruit of kisses Long will bear no thankless burden. XV If they care not Though love were not, If no breath of his burn through then, Joy must borrow Song from sorrow, Fear teach hope the way to woo them. XVI Grief has measures Soft as pleasure's, Fear has moods that hope lies deep in, Songs to sing him, Dreams to bring him, And a red-rose bed to sleep in. XVII Hope with fearless Looks and tearless Lies and laughs too near the thunder; Fear hath sweeter Speech and meeter For heart's love to hide him under. XVIII Joy by daytime Fills his playtime Full of songs loud mirth takes pride in; Night and morrow Weave round sorrow Thoughts as soft as sleep to hide in. XIX Graceless faces, Loveless graces, Are but motes in light that quicken, Sands that run down Ere the sundown, Roseleaves dead ere autumn sicken. XX Fair and fruitless Charms are bootless Spells to ward off age's peril; Lips that give not Love shall live not, Eyes that meet not eyes are sterile. XXI But the beauty Bound in duty Fast to love that falls off never Love shall cherish Lest it perish, And its root bears fruit for ever. TWO LEADERS ???? ?????, ??????? ????????? ?????? ?????? ???????, ??? ??????? ?????. I O great and wise, clear-souled and high of heart, One the last flower of Catholic love, that grows Amid bare thorns their only thornless rose, From the fierce juggling of the priests' loud mart Yet alien, yet unspotted and apart From the blind hard foul rout whose shameless shows Mock the sweet heaven whose secret no man knows With prayers and curses and the soothsayer's art; One like a storm-god of the northern foam Strong, wrought of rock that breasts and breaks the sea And thunders back its thunder, rhyme for rhyme Answering, as though to outroar the tides of time And bid the world's wave back—what song should be Theirs that with praise would bring and sing you home? II With all our hearts we praise you whom ye hate, High souls that hate us; for our hopes are higher, And higher than yours the goal of our desire, Though high your ends be as your hearts are great. Your world of Gods and kings, of shrine and state, Was of the night when hope and fear stood nigher, Wherein men walked by light of stars and fire Till man by day stood equal with his fate. Honour not hate we give you, love not fear, Last prophets of past kind, who fill the dome Of great dead Gods with wrath and wail, nor hear Time's word and man's: “Go honoured hence, go home, Night's childless children; here your hour is done; Pass with the stars, and leave us with the sun.” VICTOR HUGO IN 1877 “Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?” Above the spring-tide sundawn of the year, A sunlike star, not born of day or night, Filled the fair heaven of spring with heavenlier light, Made of all ages orbed in one sole sphere Whose light was as a Titan's smile or tear; Then rose a ray more flowerlike, starry white, Like a child's eye grown lovelier with delight, Sweet as a child's heart-lightening laugh to hear; And last a fire from heaven, a fiery rain As of God's wrath on the unclean cities, fell And lit the shuddering shades of half-seen hell That shrank before it and were cloven in twain; A beacon fired by lightning, whence all time Sees red the bare black ruins of a crime. CHILD'S SONG What is gold worth, say, Worth for work or play, Worth to keep or pay, Hide or throw away, Hope about or fear? What is love worth, pray? Worth a tear? Golden on the mould Lie the dead leaves rolled Of the wet woods old, Yellow leaves and cold, Woods without a dove; Gold is worth but gold; Love's worth love. TRIADS I I The word of the sun to the sky, The word of the wind to the sea, The word of the moon to the night, What may it be? II The sense to the flower of the fly, The sense of the bird to the tree, The sense to the cloud of the light, Who can tell me? III The song of the fields to the kye, The song of the lime to the bee, The song of the depth to the height, Who knows all three? II I The message of April to May That May sends on into June And June gives out to July For birthday boon; II The delight of the dawn in the day, The delight of the day in the noon, The delight of a song in a sigh That breaks the tune; III The secret of passing away, The cost of the change of the moon, None knows it with ear or with eye, But all will soon. III I The live wave's love for the shore, The shore's for the wave as it dies, The love of the thunder-fire That sears the skies, II We shall know not though life wax hoar, Till all life, spent into sighs, Burn out as consumed with desire Of death's strange eyes; III Till the secret be secret no more In the light of one hour as it flies, Be the hour as of suns that expire Or suns that rise. FOUR SONGS OF FOUR SEASONS I WINTER IN NORTHUMBERLAND I Outside the garden The wet skies harden; The gates are barred on The summer side: “Shut out the flower-time, Sunbeam and shower-time; Make way for our time,” Wild winds have cried. Green once and cheery, The woods, worn weary, Sigh as the dreary Weak sun goes home: A great wind grapples The wave, and dapples The dead green floor of the sea with foam. II Through fell and moorland, And salt-sea foreland, Our noisy norland Resounds and rings; Waste waves thereunder Are blown in sunder, And winds make thunder With cloudwide wings; Sea-drift makes dimmer The beacon's glimmer; Nor sail nor swimmer Can try the tides; And snowdrifts thicken Where, when leaves quicken, Under the heather the sundew hides. III Green land and red land, Moorside and headland, Are white as dead land, Are all as one; Nor honied heather, Nor bells to gather, Fair with fair weather And faithful sun: Fierce frost has eaten All flowers that sweeten The fells rain-beaten; And winds their foes Have made the snow's bed Down in the rose-bed; Deep in the snow's bed bury the rose. IV Bury her deeper Than any sleeper; Sweet dreams will keep her All day, all night; Though sleep benumb her And time o'ercome her, She dreams of summer, And takes delight, Dreaming and sleeping In love's good keeping, While rain is weeping And no leaves cling; Winds will come bringing her Comfort, and singing her Stories and songs and good news of the spring. V Draw the white curtain Close, and be certain She takes no hurt in Her soft low bed; She feels no colder, And grows not older, Though snows enfold her From foot to head; She turns not chilly Like weed and lily In marsh or hilly High watershed, Or green soft island In lakes of highland; She sleeps awhile, and she is not dead. VI For all the hours, Come sun, come showers, Are friends of flowers, And fairies all; When frost entrapped her, They came and lapped her In leaves, and wrapped her With shroud and pall; In red leaves wound her, With dead leaves bound her Dead brows, and round her A death-knell rang; Rang the death-bell for her, Sang, “is it well for her, Well, is it well with you, rose?” they sang. VII O what and where is The rose now, fairies, So shrill the air is, So wild the sky? Poor last of roses, Her worst of woes is The noise she knows is The winter's cry; His hunting hollo Has scared the swallow; Fain would she follow And fain would fly: But wind unsettles Her poor last petals; Had she but wings, and she would not die. VIII Come, as you love her, Come close and cover Her white face over, And forth again Ere sunset glances On foam that dances, Through lowering lances Of bright white rain; And make your playtime Of winter's daytime, As if the Maytime Were here to sing; As if the snowballs Were soft like blowballs, Blown in a mist from the stalk in the spring. IX Each reed that grows in Our stream is frozen, The fields it flows in Are hard and black; The water-fairy Waits wise and wary Till time shall vary And thaws come back. “O sister, water,” The wind besought her, “O twin-born, daughter Of spring with me, Stay with me, play with me, Take the warm way with me, Straight for the summer and oversea.” X But winds will vary, And wise and wary The patient fairy Of water waits; All shrunk and wizen, In iron prison, Till spring re-risen Unbar the gates; Till, as with clamour Of axe and hammer, Chained streams that stammer And struggle in straits Burst bonds that shiver, And thaws deliver The roaring river in stormy spates. XI In fierce March weather White waves break tether, And whirled together At either hand, Like weeds uplifted, The tree-trunks rifted In spars are drifted, Like foam or sand, Past swamp and sallow And reed-beds callow, Through pool and shallow, To wind and lee, Till, no more tongue-tied, Full flood and young tide Roar down the rapids and storm the sea. XII As men's cheeks faded On shores invaded, When shorewards waded The lords of fight; When churl and craven Saw hard on haven The wide-winged raven At mainmast height; When monks affrighted To windward sighted The birds full-flighted Of swift sea-kings; So earth turns paler When Storm the sailor Steers in with a roar in the race of his wings. XIII O strong sea-sailor, Whose cheek turns paler For wind or hail or For fear of thee? O far sea-farer, O thunder-bearer, Thy songs are rarer Than soft songs be. O fleet-foot stranger, O north-sea ranger Through days of danger And ways of fear, Blow thy horn here for us, Blow the sky clear for us, Send us the song of the sea to hear. XIV Roll the strong stream of it Up, till the scream of it Wake from a dream of it Children that sleep, Seamen that fare for them Forth, with a prayer for them; Shall not God care for them, Angels not keep? Spare not the surges Thy stormy scourges; Spare us the dirges Of wives that weep. Turn back the waves for us: Dig no fresh graves for us, Wind, in the manifold gulfs of the deep. XV O stout north-easter, Sea-king, land-waster, For all thine haste, or Thy stormy skill, Yet hadst thou never, For all endeavour, Strength to dissever Or strength to spill, Save of his giving Who gave our living, Whose hands are weaving What ours fulfil; Whose feet tread under The storms and thunder; Who made our wonder to work his will. XVI His years and hours, His world's blind powers, His stars and flowers, His nights and days, Sea-tide and river, And waves that shiver, Praise God, the giver Of tongues to praise. Winds in their blowing, And fruits in growing; Time in its going, While time shall be; In death and living, With one thanksgiving, Praise him whose hand is the strength of the sea. II SPRING IN TUSCANY Rose-red lilies that bloom on the banner; Rose-cheeked gardens that revel in spring; Rose-mouthed acacias that laugh as they climb, Like plumes for a queen's hand fashioned to fan her With wind more soft than a wild dove's wing, What do they sing in the spring of their time? If this be the rose that the world hears singing, Soft in the soft night, loud in the day, Songs for the fire-flies to dance as they hear; If that be the song of the nightingale, springing Forth in the form of a rose in May, What do they say of the way of the year? What of the way of the world gone Maying, What of the work of the buds in the bowers, What of the will of the wind on the wall, Fluttering the wall-flowers, sighing and playing, Shrinking again as a bird that cowers, Thinking of hours when the flowers have to fall? Out of the throats of the loud birds showering, Out of the folds where the flag-lilies leap, Out of the mouths of the roses stirred, Out of the herbs on the walls reflowering, Out of the heights where the sheer snows sleep, Out of the deep and the steep, one word. One from the lips of the lily-flames leaping, The glad red lilies that burn in our sight, The great live lilies for standard and crown; One from the steeps where the pines stand sleeping, One from the deep land, one from the height, One from the light and the might of the town. The lowlands laugh with delight of the highlands, Whence May winds feed them with balm and breath From hills that beheld in the years behind A shape as of one from the blest souls' islands, Made fair by a soul too fair for death, With eyes on the light that should smite them blind. Vallombrosa remotely remembers, Perchance, what still to us seems so near That time not darkens it, change not mars, The foot that she knew when her leaves were September's, The face lift up to the star-blind seer, That saw from his prison arisen his stars. And Pisa broods on her dead, not mourning, For love of her loveliness given them in fee; And Prato gleams with the glad monk's gift Whose hand was there as the hand of morning; And Siena, set in the sand's red sea, Lifts loftier her head than the red sand's drift. And far to the fair south-westward lightens, Girdled and sandalled and plumed with flowers, At sunset over the love-lit lands, The hill-side's crown where the wild hill brightens, Saint Fina's town of the Beautiful Towers, Hailing the sun with a hundred hands. Land of us all that have loved thee dearliest, Mother of men that were lords of man, Whose name in the world's heart works as a spell, My last song's light, and the star of mine earliest, As we turn from thee, sweet, who wast ours for a span, Fare well we may not who say farewell. III SUMMER IN AUVERGNE The sundawn fills the land Full as a feaster's hand Fills full with bloom of bland Bright wine his cup; Flows full to flood that fills From the arch of air it thrills Those rust-red iron hills With morning up. Dawn, as a panther springs, With fierce and fire-fledged wings Leaps on the land that rings From her bright feet Through all its lava-black Cones that cast answer back And cliffs of footless track Where thunders meet. The light speaks wide and loud From deeps blown clean of cloud As though day's heart were proud And heaven's were glad; The towers brown-striped and grey Take fire from heaven of day As though the prayers they pray Their answers had. Higher in these high first hours Wax all the keen church towers, And higher all hearts of ours Than the old hills' crown, Higher than the pillared height Of that strange cliff-side bright With basalt towers whose might Strong time bows down. And the old fierce ruin there Of the old wild princes' lair Whose blood in mine hath share Gapes gaunt and great Toward heaven that long ago Watched all the wan land's woe Whereon the wind would blow Of their bleak hate. Dead are those deeds; but yet Their memory seems to fret Lands that might else forget That old world's brand; Dead all their sins and days; Yet in this red clime's rays Some fiery memory stays That sears their land. IV AUTUMN IN CORNWALL The year lies fallen and faded On cliffs by clouds invaded, With tongues of storms upbraided, With wrath of waves bedinned; And inland, wild with warning, As in deaf ears or scorning, The clarion even and morning Rings of the south-west wind. The wild bents wane and wither In blasts whose breath bows hither Their grey-grown heads and thither, Unblest of rain or sun; The pale fierce heavens are crowded With shapes like dreams beclouded, As though the old year enshrouded Lay, long ere life were done. Full-charged with oldworld wonders, From dusk Tintagel thunders A note that smites and sunders The hard frore fields of air; A trumpet stormier-sounded Than once from lists rebounded When strong men sense-confounded Fell thick in tourney there. From scarce a duskier dwelling Such notes of wail rose welling Through the outer darkness, telling In the awful singer's ears What souls the darkness covers, What love-lost souls of lovers, Whose cry still hangs and hovers In each man's born that hears. For there by Hector's brother And yet some thousand other He that had grief to mother Passed pale from Dante's sight; With one fast linked as fearless, Perchance, there only tearless; Iseult and Tristram, peerless And perfect queen and knight. A shrill-winged sound comes flying North, as of wild souls crying The cry of things undying, That know what life must be; Or as the old year's heart, stricken Too sore for hope to quicken By thoughts like thorns that thicken, Broke, breaking with the sea. THE WHITE CZAR [In an English magazine of 1877 there appeared a version of some insolent lines addressed by “A Russian Poet to the Empress of India.” To these the first of the two following sonnets was designed to serve by way of counterblast. The writer will scarcely be suspected of royalism or imperialism; but it seemed to him that an insult levelled by Muscovite lips at the ruler of England might perhaps be less unfitly than unofficially resented by an Englishman who was also a republican.] I Gehazi by the hue that chills thy cheek And Pilate by the hue that sears thine hand Whence all earth's waters cannot wash the brand That signs thy soul a manslayer's though thou speak All Christ, with lips most murderous and most meek— Thou set thy foot where England's used to stand! Thou reach thy rod forth over Indian land! Slave of the slaves that call thee lord, and weak As their foul tongues who praise thee! son of them Whose presence put the snows and stars to shame In centuries dead and damned that reek below Curse-consecrated, crowned with crime and flame, To them that bare thee like them shalt thou go Forth of man's life—a leper white as snow. II Call for clear water, wash thine hands, be clean, Cry, What is truth? O Pilate; thou shalt know Haply too soon, and gnash thy teeth for woe Ere the outer darkness take thee round unseen That hides the red ghosts of thy race obscene Bound nine times round with hell's most dolorous flow, And in its pools thy crownless head lie low By his of Spain who dared an English queen With half a world to hearten him for fight, Till the wind gave his warriors and their might To shipwreck and the corpse-encumbered sea. But thou, take heed, ere yet thy lips wax white, Lest as it was with Philip so it be, O white of name and red of hand, with thee. RIZPAH How many sons, how many generations, For how long years hast thou bewept, and known Nor end of torment nor surcease of moan, Rachel or Rizpah, wofullest of nations, Crowned with the crowning sign of desolations, And couldst not even scare off with hand or groan Those carrion birds devouring bone by bone The children of thy thousand tribulations? Thou wast our warrior once; thy sons long dead Against a foe less foul than this made head, Poland, in years that sound and shine afar; Ere the east beheld in thy bright sword-blade's stead The rotten corpse-light of the Russian star That lights towards hell his bondslaves and their Czar. TO LOUIS KOSSUTH 1877 Light of our fathers' eyes, and in our own Star of the unsetting sunset! for thy name, That on the front of noon was as a flame In the great year nigh thirty years agone When all the heavens of Europe shook and shone With stormy wind and lightning, keeps its fame And bears its witness all day through the same; Not for past days and great deeds past alone, Kossuth, we praise thee as our Landor praised, But that now too we know thy voice upraised, Thy voice, the trumpet of the truth of God, Thine hand, the thunder-bearer's, raised to smite As with heaven's lightning for a sword and rod Men's heads abased before the Muscovite. TRANSLATIONS FROM THE FRENCH OF VILLON THE COMPLAINT OF THE FAIR ARMOURESS I Meseemeth I heard cry and groan That sweet who was the armourer's maid; For her young years she made sore moan, And right upon this wise she said; “Ah fierce old age with foul bald head, To spoil fair things thou art over fain; Who holdeth me? who? would God I were dead! Would God I were well dead and slain! II “Lo, thou hast broken the sweet yoke That my high beauty held above All priests and clerks and merchant-folk; There was not one but for my love Would give me gold and gold enough, Though sorrow his very heart had riven, To win from me such wage thereof As now no thief would take if given. III “I was right chary of the same, God wot it was my great folly, For love of one sly knave of them, Good store of that same sweet had he; For all my subtle wiles, perdie, God wot I loved him well enow; Right evilly he handled me, But he loved well my gold, I trow. IV “Though I gat bruises green and black, I loved him never the less a jot; Though he bound burdens on my back, If he said ‘Kiss me and heed it not’ Right little pain I felt, God wot, When that foul thief's mouth, found so sweet, Kissed me—Much good thereof I got! I keep the sin and the shame of it. V “And he died thirty year agone. I am old now, no sweet thing to see; By God, though, when I think thereon, And of that good glad time, woe's me, And stare upon my changed body Stark naked, that has been so sweet, Lean, wizen, like a small dry tree, I am nigh mad with the pain of it. VI “Where is my faultless forehead's white, The lifted eyebrows, soft gold hair, Eyes wide apart and keen of sight, With subtle skill in the amorous air; The straight nose, great nor small, but fair, The small carved ears of shapeliest growth, Chin dimpling, colour good to wear, And sweet red splendid kissing mouth? VII “The shapely slender shoulders small, Long arms, hands wrought in glorious wise, Round little breasts, the hips withal High, full of flesh, not scant of size, Fit for all amorous masteries; ??? ????? ?????, ??? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ??????? ????? ?? ???? ????? ?????? ?? ? ????? ?????? ?? ???? ?????? VIII “A writhled forehead, hair gone grey, Fallen eyebrows, eyes gone blind and red, Their laughs and looks all fled away, Yea, all that smote men's hearts are fled; The bowed nose, fallen from goodlihead; Foul flapping ears like water-flags; Peaked chin, and cheeks all waste and dead, And lips that are two skinny rags: IX “Thus endeth all the beauty of us. The arms made short, the hands made lean, The shoulders bowed and ruinous, The breasts, alack! all fallen in; The flanks too, like the breasts, grown thin; ?? ??? ??? ????? ?????, ??? ?? ??! For the lank thighs, no thighs but skin, They are specked with spots like sausage-meat. X “So we make moan for the old sweet days, Poor old light women, two or three Squatting above the straw-fire's blaze, The bosom crushed against the knee, Like faggots on a heap we be, Round fires soon lit, soon quenched and done; And we were once so sweet, even we! Thus fareth many and many an one.” A DOUBLE BALLAD OF GOOD COUNSEL Now take your fill of love and glee, And after balls and banquets hie; In the end ye'll get no good for fee, But just heads broken by and by; Light loves make beasts of men that sigh; They changed the faith of Solomon, And left not Samson lights to spy; Good luck has he that deals with none! Sweet Orpheus, lord of minstrelsy, For this with flute and pipe came nigh The danger of the dog's heads three That ravening at hell's door doth lie; Fain was Narcissus, fair and shy, For love's love lightly lost and won, In a deep well to drown and die; Good luck has he that deals with none! Sardana, flower of chivalry, Who conquered Crete with horn and cry, For this was fain a maid to be And learn with girls the thread to ply; King David, wise in prophecy, Forgot the fear of God for one Seen washing either shapely thigh; Good luck has he that deals with none! For this did Amnon, craftily Feigning to eat of cakes of rye, Deflower his sister fair to see, Which was foul incest; and hereby Was Herod moved, it is no lie, To lop the head of Baptist John For dance and jig and psaltery; Good luck has he that deals with none! Next of myself I tell, poor me, How thrashed like clothes at wash was I Stark naked, I must needs agree; Who made me eat so sour a pie But Katherine of Vaucelles? thereby, Noé took third part of that fun; Such wedding-gloves are ill to buy; Good luck has he that deals with none! But for that young man fair and free To pass those young maids lightly by, Nay, would you burn him quick, not he; Like broom-horsed witches though he fry, They are sweet as civet in his eye; But trust them, and you're fooled anon; For white or brown, and low or high, Good luck has he that deals with none! FRAGMENT ON DEATH And Paris be it or Helen dying, Who dies soever, dies with pain. He that lacks breath and wind for sighing, His gall bursts on his heart; and then He sweats, God knows what sweat!—again, No man may ease him of his grief; Child, brother, sister, none were fain To bail him thence for his relief. Death makes him shudder, swoon, wax pale, Nose bend, veins stretch, and breath surrender, Neck swell, flesh soften, joints that fail Crack their strained nerves and arteries slender. O woman's body found so tender, Smooth, sweet, so precious in men's eyes, Must thou too bear such count to render? Yes; or pass quick into the skies. [In the original here follows Villon's masterpiece, the matchless Ballad of the Ladies of Old Time, so incomparably rendered in the marvellous version of D. G. Rossetti; followed in its turn by the succeeding poem, as inferior to its companion as is my attempt at translation of it to his triumph in that higher and harder field.— A. C. S.] BALLAD OF THE LORDS OF OLD TIME (AFTER THE FORMER ARGUMENT) What more? Where is the third Calixt, Last of that name now dead and gone, Who held four years the Papalist? Alphonso king of Aragon, The gracious lord, duke of Bourbon, And Arthur, duke of old Britaine? And Charles the Seventh, that worthy one? Even with the good knight Charlemain. The Scot too, king of mount and mist, With half his face vermilion, Men tell us, like an amethyst From brow to chin that blazed and shone; The Cypriote king of old renown, Alas! and that good king of Spain, Whose name I cannot think upon? Even with the good knight Charlemain. No more to say of them I list; 'Tis all but vain, all dead and done: For death may no man born resist, Nor make appeal when death comes on. I make yet one more question; Where's Lancelot, king of far Bohain? Where's he whose grandson called him son? Even with the good knight Charlemain. Where is Guesclin, the good Breton? The lord of the eastern mountain-chain, And the good late duke of Alençon? Even with the good knight Charlemain. BALLAD OF THE WOMEN OF PARIS Albeit the Venice girls get praise For their sweet speech and tender air, And though the old women have wise ways Of chaffering for amorous ware, Yet at my peril dare I swear, Search Rome, where God's grace mainly tarries, Florence and Savoy, everywhere, There's no good girl's lip out of Paris. The Naples women, as folk prattle, Are sweetly spoken and subtle enough: German girls are good at tattle, And Prussians make their boast thereof; Take Egypt for the next remove, Or that waste land the Tartar harries, Spain or Greece, for the matter of love, There's no good girl's lip out of Paris. Breton and Swiss know nought of the matter, Gascony girls or girls of Toulouse; Two fishwives here with a half-hour's chatter Would shut them up by threes and twos; Calais, Lorraine, and all their crews, (Names enow the mad song marries) England and Picardy, search them and choose, There's no good girl's lip out of Paris. Prince, give praise to our French ladies For the sweet sound their speaking carries; 'Twixt Rome and Cadiz many a maid is, But no good girl's lip out of Paris. BALLAD WRITTEN FOR A BRIDEGROOM WHICH VILLON GAVE TO A GENTLEMAN NEWLY MARRIED TO SEND TO HIS WIFE WHOM HE HAD WON WITH THE SWORD At daybreak, when the falcon claps his wings, No whit for grief, but noble heart and high, With loud glad noise he stirs himself and springs, And takes his meat and toward his lure draws nigh; Such good I wish you! Yea, and heartily I am fired with hope of true love's meed to get; Know that Love writes it in his book; for why, This is the end for which we twain are met. Mine own heart's lady with no gainsayings You shall be always wholly till I die; And in my right against all bitter things Sweet laurel with fresh rose its force shall try; Seeing reason wills not that I cast love by (Nor here with reason shall I chide or fret) Nor cease to serve, but serve more constantly; This is the end for which we twain are met. And, which is more, when grief about me clings Through Fortune's fit or fume of jealousy, Your sweet kind eye beats down her threatenings As wind doth smoke; such power sits in your eye. Thus in your field my seed of harvestry Thrives, for the fruit is like me that I set; God bids me tend it with good husbandry; This is the end for which we twain are met. Princess, give ear to this my summary; That heart of mine your heart's love should forget Shall never be: like trust in you put I: This is the end for which we twain are met. BALLAD AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF FRANCE May he fall in with beasts that scatter fire, Like Jason, when he sought the fleece of gold, Or change from man to beast three years entire, As King Nebuchadnezzar did of old; Or else have times as shameful and as bad As Trojan folk for ravished Helen had; Or gulfed with Proserpine and Tantalus Let hell's deep fen devour him dolorous, With worse to bear than Job's worst sufferance, Bound in his prison-maze with Dædalus, Who could wish evil to the state of France! May he four months, like bitterns in the mire, Howl with head downmost in the lake-springs cold, Or to bear harness like strong bulls for hire To the Great Turk for money down be sold; Or thirty years like Magdalen live sad, With neither wool nor web of linen clad; Drown like Narciss', or swing down pendulous Like Absalom with locks luxurious, Or liker Judas fallen to reprobance; Or find such death as Simon sorcerous, Who could wish evil to the state of France! May the old times come of fierce Octavian's ire, And in his belly molten coin be told; May he like Victor in the mill expire, Crushed between moving millstones on him rolled, Or in deep sea drenched breathless, more adrad Than in the whale's bulk Jonas, when God bade: From Phœbus' light, from Juno's treasure-house Driven, and from joys of Venus amorous, And cursed of God most high to the utterance, As was the Syrian king Antiochus, Who could wish evil to the state of France! Prince, may the bright-winged brood of Æolus To sea-king Glaucus' wild wood cavernous Bear him bereft of peace and hope's least glance, For worthless is he to get good of us, Who could wish evil to the state of France. THE DISPUTE OF THE HEART AND BODY OF FRANÇOIS VILLON Who is this I hear?—Lo, this is I, thine heart, That holds on merely now by a slender string. Strength fails me, shape and sense are rent apart, The blood in me is turned to a bitter thing, Seeing thee skulk here like a dog shivering.— Yea, and for what?—For that thy sense found sweet.— What irks it thee?—I feel the sting of it.— Leave me at peace.—Why?—Nay now, leave me at peace; I will repent when I grow ripe in wit.— I say no more.—I care not though thou cease.— What art thou, trow?—A man worth praise, perfay.— This is thy thirtieth year of wayfaring.— 'Tis a mule's age.—Art thou a boy still?—Nay.— Is it hot lust that spurs thee with its sting, Grasping thy throat? Know'st thou not anything?— Yea, black and white, when milk is specked with flies, I can make out.—No more?—Nay, in no wise. Shall I begin again the count of these?— Thou art undone.—I will make shift to rise.— I say no more.—I care not though thou cease.— I have the sorrow of it, and thou the smart. Wert thou a poor mad fool or weak of wit, Then might'st thou plead this pretext with thine heart; But if thou know not good from evil a whit, Either thy head is hard as stone to hit, Or shame, not honour, gives thee most content. What canst thou answer to this argument?— When I am dead I shall be well at ease.— God! what good hope!—Thou art over eloquent.— I say no more.—I care not though thou cease.— Whence is this ill?—From sorrow and not from sin. When Saturn packed my wallet up for me I well believe he put these ills therein.— Fool, wilt thou make thy servant lord of thee? Hear now the wise king's counsel; thus saith he: All power upon the stars a wise man hath; There is no planet that shall do him scathe.— Nay, as they made me I grow and I decrease.— What say'st thou?—Truly this is all my faith.— I say no more.—I care not though thou cease.— Wouldst thou live still?—God help me that I may!— Then thou must—What? turn penitent and pray?— Read always—What?—Grave words and good to say; Leave off the ways of fools, lest they displease.— Good; I will do it.—Wilt thou remember?—Yea.— Abide not till there come an evil day. I say no more.—I care not though thou cease. EPISTLE IN FORM OF A BALLAD TO HIS FRIENDS Have pity, pity, friends, have pity on me, Thus much at least, may it please you, of your grace! I lie not under hazel or hawthorn—tree Down in this dungeon ditch, mine exile's place By leave of God and fortune's foul disgrace. Girls, lovers, glad young folk and newly wed, Jumpers and jugglers, tumbling heel o'er head, Swift as a dart, and sharp as needle-ware, Throats clear as bells that ring the kine to shed, Your poor old friend, what, will you leave him there? Singers that sing at pleasure, lawlessly, Light, laughing, gay of word and deed, that race And run like folk light-witted as ye be And have in hand nor current coin nor base, Ye wait too long, for now he's dying apace. Rhymers of lays and roundels sung and read, Ye'll brew him broth too late when he lies dead. Nor wind nor lightning, sunbeam nor fresh air, May pierce the thick wall's bound where lies his bed; Your poor old friend, what, will you leave him there? O noble folk from tithes and taxes free, Come and behold him in this piteous case, Ye that nor king nor emperor holds in fee, But only God in heaven; behold his face Who needs must fast, Sundays and holidays, Which makes his teeth like rakes; and when he hath fed With never a cake for banquet but dry bread, Must drench his bowels with much cold watery fare, With board nor stool, but low on earth instead; Your poor old friend, what, will you leave him there? Princes afore-named, old and young foresaid, Get me the king's seal and my pardon sped, And hoist me in some basket up with care: So swine will help each other ill bested, For where one squeaks they run in heaps ahead. Your poor old friend, what, will you leave him there? THE EPITAPH IN FORM OF A BALLAD WHICH VILLON MADE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS COMRADES, EXPECTING TO BE HANGED ALONG WITH THEM Men, brother men, that after us yet live, Let not your hearts too hard against us be; For if some pity of us poor men ye give, The sooner God shall take of you pity. Here are we five or six strung up, you see, And here the flesh that all too well we fed Bit by bit eaten and rotten, rent and shred, And we the bones grow dust and ash withal; Let no man laugh at us discomforted, But pray to God that he forgive us all. If we call on you, brothers, to forgive, Ye should not hold our prayer in scorn, though we Were slain by law; ye know that all alive Have not wit alway to walk righteously; Make therefore intercession heartily With him that of a virgin's womb was bred, That his grace be not as a dry well-head For us, nor let hell's thunder on us fall; We are dead, let no man harry or vex us dead, But pray to God that he forgive us all. The rain has washed and laundered us all five, And the sun dried and blackened; yea, perdie, Ravens and pies with beaks that rend and rive Have dug our eyes out, and plucked off for fee Our beards and eyebrows; never are we free, Not once, to rest; but here and there still sped, Drive at its wild will by the wind's change led, More pecked of birds than fruits on garden-wall; Men, for God's love, let no gibe here be said, But pray to God that he forgive us all. Prince Jesus, that of all art lord and head, Keep us, that hell be not our bitter bed; We have nought to do in such a master's hall. Be not ye therefore of our fellowhead, But pray to God that he forgive us all. FROM VICTOR HUGO Take heed of this small child of earth; He is great: he hath in him God most high. Children before their fleshly birth Are lights alive in the blue sky. In our light bitter world of wrong They come; God gives us them awhile. His speech is in their stammering tongue, And his forgiveness in their smile. Their sweet light rests upon our eyes. Alas! their right to joy is plain. If they are hungry, Paradise Weeps, and, if cold, Heaven thrills with pain. The want that saps their sinless flower Speaks judgment on sin's ministers. Man holds an angel in his power. Ah! deep in Heaven what thunder stirs, When God seeks out these tender things Whom in the shadow where we sleep He sends us clothed about with wings, And finds them ragged babes that weep! DEDICATION 1878 Some nine years gone, as we dwelt together In the sweet hushed heat of the south French weather Ere autumn fell on the vine-tressed hills Or the season had shed one rose-red feather, Friend, whose fame is a flame that fills All eyes it lightens and hearts it thrills With joy to be born of the blood which bred From a land that the grey sea girds and chills The heart and spirit and hand and head Whose might is as light on a dark day shed, On a day now dark as a land's decline Where all the peers of your praise are dead, In a land and season of corn and vine I pledged you a health from a beaker of mine But halfway filled to the lip's edge yet With hope for honey and song for wine. Nine years have risen and eight years set Since there by the wellspring our hands on it met: And the pledge of my songs that were then to be, I could wonder not, friend, though a friend should forget. For life's helm rocks to the windward and lee, And time is as wind, and as waves are we; And song is as foam that the sea-winds fret, Though the thought at its heart should be deep as the sea. POEMS AND BALLADS THIRD SERIES TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT POET AND PAINTER I DEDICATE THESE POEMS IN MEMORY OF MANY YEARS MARCH: AN ODE 1887 I Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour of winter had passed out of sight, The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that fulfil us in sleep with delight; The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and swayed Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it fade That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night than the day, nor the day than the night, Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had the madness and might in thee made, March, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that enkindle the season they smite. II And now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and ravin and spoil of the snow, And the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low, How should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the year that exults to be born So strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn? Thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy forehead is molten: thy lips are aglow As a lover's that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment and tresses yet wasted and torn, Takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel through her spirit the sense of thee flow. III Fain, fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the sun have dispelled and consumed, Those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous burden the branches implumed Hung heavily, curved as a half-bent bow, and fledged not as birds are, but petalled as flowers, Each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved, or a fountain that shines as it showers, But fixed as a fountain is fixed not, and wrought not to last till by time or by tempest entombed, As a pinnacle carven and gilded of men: for the date of its doom is no more than an hour's, One hour of the sun's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the snow-flowers that froze as they bloomed. IV As the sunshine quenches the snowshine; as April subdues thee, and yields up his kingdom to May; So time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes in passion away, And leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with tears or thanksgivings; but thou, Bright god that art gone from us, maddest and gladdest of months, to what goal hast thou gone from us now? For somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens, the beat of thy wings that play, Must flame as a fire through the world, and the heavens that we know not rejoice in thee: surely thy brow Hath lost not its radiance of empire, thy spirit the joy that impelled it on quest as for prey. V Are thy feet on the ways of the limitless waters, thy wings on the winds of the waste north sea? Are the fires of the false north dawn over heavens where summer is stormful and strong like thee Now bright in the sight of thine eyes? are the bastions of icebergs assailed by the blast of thy breath? Is it March with the wild north world when April is waning? the word that the changed year saith, Is it echoed to northward with rapture of passion reiterate from spirits triumphant as we Whose hearts were uplift at the blast of thy clarions as men's rearisen from a sleep that was death And kindled to life that was one with the world's and with thine? hast thou set not the whole world free? VI For the breath of thy lips is freedom, and freedom's the sense of thy spirit, the sound of thy song, Glad god of the north-east wind, whose heart is as high as the hands of thy kingdom are strong, Thy kingdom whose empire is terror and joy, twin-featured and fruitful of births divine, Days lit with the flame of the lamps of the flowers, and nights that are drunken with dew for wine, And sleep not for joy of the stars that deepen and quicken, a denser and fierier throng, And the world that thy breath bade whiten and tremble rejoices at heart as they strengthen and shine, And earth gives thanks for the glory bequeathed her, and knows of thy reign that it wrought not wrong. VII Thy spirit is quenched not, albeit we behold not thy face in the crown of the steep sky's arch, And the bold first buds of the whin wax golden, and witness arise of the thorn and the larch: Wild April, enkindled to laughter and storm by the kiss of the wildest of winds that blow, Calls loud on his brother for witness; his hands that were laden with blossom are sprinkled with snow, And his lips breathe winter, and laugh, and relent; and the live woods feel not the frost's flame parch; For the flame of the spring that consumes not but quickens is felt at the heart of the forest aglow, And the sparks that enkindled and fed it were strewn from the hands of the gods of the winds of March. THE COMMONWEAL 1887 I Eight hundred years and twenty-one Have shone and sunken since the land Whose name is freedom bore such brand As marks a captive, and the sun Beheld her fettered hand. II But ere dark time had shed as rain Or sown on sterile earth as seed That bears no fruit save tare and weed An age and half an age again, She rose on Runnymede. III Out of the shadow, starlike still, She rose up radiant in her right, And spake, and put to fear and flight The lawless rule of awless will That pleads no right save might. IV Nor since hath England ever borne The burden laid on subject lands, The rule that curbs and binds all hands Save one, and marks for servile scorn The heads it bows and brands. V A commonweal arrayed and crowned With gold and purple, girt with steel At need, that foes must fear or feel, We find her, as our fathers found, Earth's lordliest commonweal. VI And now that fifty years are flown Since in a maiden's hand the sign Of empire that no seas confine First as a star to seaward shone, We see their record shine. VII A troubled record, foul and fair, A simple record and serene, Inscribes for praise a blameless queen, For praise and blame an age of care And change and ends unseen. VIII Hope, wide of eye and wild of wing, Rose with the sundawn of a reign Whose grace should make the rough ways plain, And fill the worn old world with spring, And heal its heart of pain. IX Peace was to be on earth; men's hope Was holier than their fathers had, Their wisdom not more wise than glad: They saw the gates of promise ope, And heard what love's lips bade. X Love armed with knowledge, winged and wise, Should hush the wind of war, and see, They said, the sun of days to be Bring round beneath serener skies A stormless jubilee. XI Time, in the darkness unbeholden That hides him from the sight of fear And lets but dreaming hope draw near, Smiled and was sad to hear such golden Strains hail the all-golden year. XII Strange clouds have risen between, and wild Red stars of storm that lit the abyss Wherein fierce fraud and violence kiss And mock such promise as beguiled The fiftieth year from this. XIII War upon war, change after change, Hath shaken thrones and towers to dust, And hopes austere and faiths august Have watched in patience stern and strange Men's works unjust and just. XIV As from some Alpine watch-tower's portal Night, living yet, looks forth for dawn, So from time's mistier mountain lawn The spirit of man, in trust immortal, Yearns toward a hope withdrawn. XV The morning comes not, yet the night Wanes, and men's eyes win strength to see Where twilight is, where light shall be When conquered wrong and conquering right Acclaim a world set free. XVI Calm as our mother-land, the mother Of faith and freedom, pure and wise, Keeps watch beneath unchangeful skies, When hath she watched the woes of other Strange lands with alien eyes? XVII Calm as she stands alone, what nation Hath lacked an alms from English hands? What exiles from what stricken lands Have lacked the shelter of the station Where higher than all she stands? XVIII Though time discrown and change dismantle The pride of thrones and towers that frown, How should they bring her glories down— The sea cast round her like a mantle, The sea-cloud like a crown? XIX The sea, divine as heaven and deathless, Is hers, and none but only she Hath learnt the sea's word, none but we Her children hear in heart the breathless Bright watchword of the sea. XX Heard not of others, or misheard Of many a land for many a year, The watchword Freedom fails not here Of hearts that witness if the word Find faith in England's ear. XXI She, first to love the light, and daughter Incarnate of the northern dawn, She, round whose feet the wild waves fawn When all their wrath of warring water Sounds like a babe's breath drawn, XXII How should not she best know, love best, And best of all souls understand The very soul of freedom, scanned Far off, sought out in darkling quest By men at heart unmanned? XXIII They climb and fall, ensnared, enshrouded, By mists of words and toils they set To take themselves, till fierce regret Grows mad with shame, and all their clouded Red skies hang sunless yet. XXIV But us the sun, not wholly risen Nor equal now for all, illumes With more of light than cloud that looms; Of light that leads forth souls from prison And breaks the seals of tombs. XXV Did not her breasts who reared us rear Him who took heaven in hand, and weighed Bright world with world in balance laid? What Newton's might could make not clear Hath Darwin's might not made? XXVI The forces of the dark dissolve, The doorways of the dark are broken: The word that casts out night is spoken, And whence the springs of things evolve Light born of night bears token. XXVII She, loving light for light's sake only, And truth for only truth's, and song For song's sake and the sea's, how long Hath she not borne the world her lonely Witness of right and wrong? XXVIII From light to light her eyes imperial Turn, and require the further light, More perfect than the sun's in sight, Till star and sun seem all funereal Lamps of the vaulted night. XXIX She gazes till the strenuous soul Within the rapture of her eyes Creates or bids awake, arise, The light she looks for, pure and whole And worshipped of the wise. XXX Such sons are hers, such radiant hands Have borne abroad her lamp of old, Such mouths of honey-dropping gold Have sent across all seas and lands Her fame as music rolled. XXXI As music made of rolling thunder That hurls through heaven its heart sublime, Its heart of joy, in charging chime, So ring the songs that round and under Her temple surge and climb. XXXII A temple not by men's hands builded, But moulded of the spirit, and wrought Of passion and imperious thought; With light beyond all sunlight gilded, Whereby the sun seems nought. XXXIII Thy shrine, our mother, seen for fairer Than even thy natural face, made fair With kisses of thine April air Even now, when spring thy banner-bearer Took up thy sign to bear; XXXIV Thine annual sign from heaven's own arch Given of the sun's hand into thine, To rear and cheer each wildwood shrine But now laid waste by wild-winged March, March, mad with wind like wine. XXXV From all thy brightening downs whereon The windy seaward whin-flower shows Blossom whose pride strikes pale the rose Forth is the golden watchword gone Whereat the world's face glows. XXXVI Thy quickening woods rejoice and ring Till earth seems glorious as the sea: With yearning love too glad for glee The world's heart quivers toward the spring As all our hearts toward thee. XXXVII Thee, mother, thee, our queen, who givest Assurance to the heavens most high And earth whereon her bondsmen sigh That by the sea's grace while thou livest Hope shall not wholly die. XXXVIII That while thy free folk hold the van Of all men, and the sea-spray shed As dew more heavenly on thy head Keeps bright thy face in sight of man, Man's pride shall drop not dead. XXXIX A pride more pure than humblest prayer, More wise than wisdom born of doubt, Girds for thy sake men's hearts about With trust and triumph that despair And fear may cast not out. XL Despair may wring men's hearts, and fear Bow down their heads to kiss the dust, Where patriot memories rot and rust, And change makes faint a nation's cheer, And faith yields up her trust. XLI Not here this year have true men known, Not here this year may true men know, That brand of shame-compelling woe Which bids but brave men shrink or groan And lays but honour low. XLII The strong spring wind blows notes of praise, And hallowing pride of heart, and cheer Unchanging, toward all true men here Who hold the trust of ancient days High as of old this year. XLIII The days that made thee great are dead; The days that now must keep thee great Lie not in keeping of thy fate; In thine they lie, whose heart and head Sustain thy charge of state. XLIV No state so proud, no pride so just, The sun, through clouds at sunrise curled Or clouds across the sunset whirled, Hath sight of, nor has man such trust As thine in all the world. XLV Each hour that sees the sunset's crest Make bright thy shores ere day decline Sees dawn the sun on shores of thine, Sees west as east and east as west On thee their sovereign shine. XLVI The sea's own heart must needs wax proud To have borne the world a child like thee. What birth of earth might ever be Thy sister? Time, a wandering cloud, Is sunshine on thy sea. XLVII Change mars not her; and thee, our mother, What change that irks or moves thee mars? What shock that shakes? what chance that jars? Time gave thee, as he gave none other, A station like a star's. XLVIII The storm that shrieks, the wind that wages War with the wings of hopes that climb Too high toward heaven in doubt sublime, Assail not thee, approved of ages The towering crown of time. XLIX Toward thee this year thy children turning With souls uplift of changeless cheer Salute with love that casts out fear, With hearts for beacons round thee burning, The token of this year. L With just and sacred jubilation Let earth sound answer to the sea For witness, blown on winds as free, How England, how her crowning nation, Acclaims this jubilee. THE ARMADA 1588: 1888 I I England, mother born of seamen, daughter fostered of the sea, Mother more beloved than all who bear not all their children free, Reared and nursed and crowned and cherished by the sea-wind and the sun, Sweetest land and strongest, face most fair and mightiest heart in one, Stands not higher than when the centuries known of earth were less by three, When the strength that struck the whole world pale fell back from hers undone. II At her feet were the heads of her foes bowed down, and the strengths of the storm of them stayed, And the hearts that were touched not with mercy with terror were touched and amazed and affrayed: Yea, hearts that had never been molten with pity were molten with fear as with flame, And the priests of the Godhead whose temple is hell, and his heart is of iron and fire, And the swordsmen that served and the seamen that sped them, whom peril could tame not or tire, Were as foam on the winds of the waters of England which tempest can tire not or tame. III They were girded about with thunder, and lightning came forth of the rage of their strength, And the measure that measures the wings of the storm was the breadth of their force and the length: And the name of their might was Invincible, covered and clothed with the terror of God; With his wrath were they winged, with his love were they fired, with the speed of his winds were they shod; With his soul were they filled, in his trust were they comforted: grace was upon them as night, And faith as the blackness of darkness: the fume of their balefires was fair in his sight, The reek of them sweet as a savour of myrrh in his nostrils: the world that he made, Theirs was it by gift of his servants: the wind, if they spake in his name, was afraid, And the sun was a shadow before it, the stars were astonished with fear of it: fire Went up to them, fed with men living, and lit of men's hands for a shrine or a pyre; And the east and the west wind scattered their ashes abroad, that his name should be blest Of the tribes of the chosen whose blessings are curses from uttermost east unto west. II I Hell for Spain, and heaven for England,—God to God, and man to man,— Met confronted, light with darkness, life with death: since time began, Never earth nor sea beheld so great a stake before them set, Save when Athens hurled back Asia from the lists wherein they met; Never since the sands of ages through the glass of history ran Saw the sun in heaven a lordlier day than this that lights us yet. II For the light that abides upon England, the glory that rests on her godlike name, The pride that is love and the love that is faith, a perfume dissolved in flame, Took fire from the dawn of the fierce July when fleets were scattered as foam And squadrons as flakes of spray; when galleon and galliass that shadowed the sea Were swept from her waves like shadows that pass with the clouds they fell from, and she Laughed loud to the wind as it gave to her keeping the glories of Spain and Rome. III Three hundred summers have fallen as leaves by the storms in their season thinned, Since northward the war-ships of Spain came sheer up the way of the south-west wind: Where the citadel cliffs of England are flanked with bastions of serpentine, Far off to the windward loomed their hulls, an hundred and twenty-nine, All filled full of the war, full-fraught with battle and charged with bale; Then store-ships weighted with cannon; and all were an hundred and fifty sail. The measureless menace of darkness anhungered with hope to prevail upon light, The shadow of death made substance, the present and visible spirit of night, Came, shaped as a waxing or waning moon that rose with the fall of day, To the channel where couches the Lion in guard of the gate of the lustrous bay. Fair England, sweet as the sea that shields her, and pure as the sea from stain, Smiled, hearing hardly for scorn that stirred her the menace of saintly Spain. III I “They that ride over ocean wide with hempen bridle and horse of tree,” How shall they in the darkening day of wrath and anguish and fear go free? How shall these that have curbed the seas not fell his bridle who made the sea? God shall bow them and break them now: for what is man in the Lord God's sight? Fear shall shake them, and shame shall break, and all the noon of their pride be night: These that sinned shall the ravening wind of doom bring under, and judgment smite. England broke from her neck the yoke, and rent the fetter, and mocked the rod: Shrines of old that she decked with gold she turned to dust, to the dust she trod: What is she, that the wind and sea should fight beside her, and war with God? Lo, the cloud of his ships that crowd her channel's inlet with storm sublime, Darker far than the tempests are that sweep the skies of her northmost clime; Huge and dense as the walls that fence the secret darkness of unknown time. Mast on mast as a tower goes past, and sail by sail as a cloud's wing spread; Fleet by fleet, as the throngs whose feet keep time with death in his dance of dread; Galleons dark as the helmsman's bark of old that ferried to hell the dead. Squadrons proud as their lords, and loud with tramp of soldiers and chant of priests; Slaves there told by the thousandfold, made fast in bondage as herded beasts; Lords and slaves that the sweet free waves shall feed on, satiate with funeral feasts. Nay, not so shall it be, they know; their priests have said it; can priesthood lie? God shall keep them, their God shall sleep not: peril and evil shall pass them by: Nay, for these are his children; seas and winds shall bid not his children die. II So they boast them, the monstrous host whose menace mocks at the dawn: and here They that wait at the wild sea's gate, and watch the darkness of doom draw near, How shall they in their evil day sustain the strength of their hearts for fear? Full July in the fervent sky sets forth her twentieth of changing morns: Winds fall mild that of late waxed wild: no presage whispers or wails or warns: Far to west on the bland sea's breast a sailing crescent uprears her horns. Seven wide miles the serene sea smiles between them stretching from rim to rim: Soft they shine, but a darker sign should bid not hope or belief wax dim: God's are these men, and not the sea's: their trust is set not on her but him. God's? but who is the God whereto the prayers and incense of these men rise? What is he, that the wind and sea should fear him, quelled by his sunbright eyes? What, that men should return again, and hail him Lord of the servile skies? Hell's own flame at his heavenly name leaps higher and laughs, and its gulfs rejoice: Plague and death from his baneful breath take life and lighten, and praise his choice: Chosen are they to devour for prey the tribes that hear not and fear his voice. Ay, but we that the wind and sea gird round with shelter of storms and waves Know not him that ye worship, grim as dreams that quicken from dead men's graves: God is one with the sea, the sun, the land that nursed us, the love that saves. Love whose heart is in ours, and part of all things noble and all things fair; Sweet and free as the circling sea, sublime and kind as the fostering air; Pure of shame as is England's name, whose crowns to come are as crowns that were. IV I But the Lord of darkness, the God whose love is a flaming fire, The master whose mercy fulfils wide hell till its torturers tire, He shall surely have heed of his servants who serve him for love, not hire. They shall fetter the wing of the wind whose pinions are plumed with foam: For now shall thy horn be exalted, and now shall thy bolt strike home; Yea, now shall thy kingdom come, Lord God of the priests of Rome. They shall cast thy curb on the waters, and bridle the waves of the sea: They shall say to her, Peace, be still: and stillness and peace shall be: And the winds and the storms shall hear them, and tremble, and worship thee. Thy breath shall darken the morning, and wither the mounting sun; And the daysprings, frozen and fettered, shall know thee, and cease to run; The heart of the world shall feel thee, and die, and thy will be done. The spirit of man that would sound thee, and search out causes of things, Shall shrink and subside and praise thee: and wisdom, with plume-plucked wings, Shall cower at thy feet and confess thee, that none may fathom thy springs. The fountains of song that await but the wind of an April to be To burst the bonds of the winter, and speak with the sound of a sea, The blast of thy mouth shall quench them: and song shall be only of thee. The days that are dead shall quicken, the seasons that were shall return; And the streets and the pastures of England, the woods that burgeon and yearn, Shall be whitened with ashes of women and children and men that burn. For the mother shall burn with the babe sprung forth of her womb in fire, And bride with bridegroom, and brother with sister, and son with sire; And the noise of the flames shall be sweet in thine ears as the sound of a lyre. Yea, so shall thy kingdom be stablished, and so shall the signs of it be: And the world shall know, and the wind shall speak, and the sun shall see, That these are the works of thy servants, whose works bear witness to thee. II But the dusk of the day falls fruitless, whose light should have lit them on: Sails flash through the gloom to shoreward, eclipsed as the sun that shone: And the west wind wakes with dawn, and the hope that was here is gone. Around they wheel and around, two knots to the Spaniard's one, The wind-swift warriors of England, who shoot as with shafts of the sun, With fourfold shots for the Spaniard's, that spare not till day be done. And the wind with the sundown sharpens, and hurtles the ships to the lee, And Spaniard on Spaniard smites, and shatters, and yields; and we, Ere battle begin, stand lords of the battle, acclaimed of the sea. And the day sweeps round to the nightward; and heavy and hard the waves Roll in on the herd of the hurtling galleons; and masters and slaves Reel blind in the grasp of the dark strong wind that shall dig their graves. For the sepulchres hollowed and shaped of the wind in the swerve of the seas, The graves that gape for their pasture, and laugh, thrilled through by the breeze, The sweet soft merciless waters, await and are fain of these. As the hiss of a Python heaving in menace of doom to be They hear through the clear night round them, whose hours are as clouds that flee, The whisper of tempest sleeping, the heave and the hiss of the sea. But faith is theirs, and with faith are they girded and helmed and shod: Invincible are they, almighty, elect for a sword and a rod; Invincible even as their God is omnipotent, infinite, God. In him is their strength, who have sworn that his glory shall wax not dim: In his name are their war-ships hallowed as mightiest of all that swim: The men that shall cope with these, and conquer, shall cast out him. In him is the trust of their hearts; the desire of their eyes is he; The light of their ways, made lightning for men that would fain be free: Earth's hosts are with them, and with them is heaven: but with us is the sea. V I And a day and a night pass over; And the heart of their chief swells high; For England, the warrior, the rover, Whose banners on all winds fly, Soul-stricken, he saith, by the shadow of death, holds off him, and draws not nigh. And the wind and the dawn together Make in from the gleaming east: And fain of the wild glad weather As famine is fain of feast, And fain of the fight, forth sweeps in its might the host of the Lord's high priest. And lightly before the breeze The ships of his foes take wing: Are they scattered, the lords of the seas? Are they broken, the foes of the king? And ever now higher as a mounting fire the hopes of the Spaniard spring. And a windless night comes down: And a breezeless morning, bright With promise of praise to crown The close of the crowning fight, Leaps up as the foe's heart leaps, and glows with lustrous rapture of light. And stinted of gear for battle The ships of the sea's folk lie, Unwarlike, herded as cattle, Six miles from the foeman's eye That fastens as flame on the sight of them tame and offenceless, and ranged as to die. Surely the souls in them quail, They are stricken and withered at heart, When in on them, sail by sail, Fierce marvels of monstrous art, Tower darkening on tower till the sea-winds cower crowds down as to hurl them apart. And the windless weather is kindly, And comforts the host in these; And their hearts are uplift in them blindly, And blindly they boast at ease That the next day's fight shall exalt them, and smite with destruction the lords of the seas. II And lightly the proud hearts prattle, And lightly the dawn draws nigh, The dawn of the doom of the battle When these shall falter and fly; No day more great in the roll of fate filled ever with fire the sky. To fightward they go as to feastward, And the tempest of ships that drive Sets eastward ever and eastward, Till closer they strain and strive; And the shots that rain on the hulls of Spain are as thunders afire and alive. And about them the blithe sea smiles And flashes to windward and lee Round capes and headlands and isles That heed not if war there be; Round Sark, round Wight, green jewels of light in the ring of the golden sea. But the men that within them abide Are stout of spirit and stark As rocks that repel the tide, As day that repels the dark; And the light bequeathed from their swords unsheathed shines lineal on Wight and on Sark. And eastward the storm sets ever, The storm of the sails that strain And follow and close and sever And lose and return and gain; And English thunder divides in sunder the holds of the ships of Spain. Southward to Calais, appalled And astonished, the vast fleet veers; And the skies are shrouded and palled, But the moonless midnight hears And sees how swift on them drive and drift strange flames that the darkness fears. They fly through the night from shoreward, Heart-stricken till morning break, And ever to scourge them forward Drives down on them England's Drake, And hurls them in as they hurtle and spin and stagger, with storm to wake. VI I And now is their time come on them. For eastward they drift and reel, With the shallows of Flanders ahead, with destruction and havoc at heel, With God for their comfort only, the God whom they serve; and here Their Lord, of his great loving-kindness, may revel and make good cheer; Though ever his lips wax thirstier with drinking, and hotter the lusts in him swell; For he feeds the thirst that consumes him with blood, and his winepress fumes with the reek of hell. II Fierce noon beats hard on the battle; the galleons that loom to the lee Bow down, heel over, uplifting their shelterless hulls from the sea: From scuppers aspirt with blood, from guns dismounted and dumb, The signs of the doom they looked for, the loud mute witnesses come. They press with sunset to seaward for comfort: and shall not they find it there? O servants of God most high, shall his winds not pass you by, and his waves not spare? III The wings of the south-west wind are widened; the breath of his fervent lips, More keen than a sword's edge, fiercer than fire, falls full on the plunging ships. The pilot is he of their northward flight, their stay and their steersman he; A helmsman clothed with the tempest, and girdled with strength to constrain the sea. And the host of them trembles and quails, caught fast in his hand as a bird in the toils; For the wrath and the joy that fulfil him are mightier than man's, whom he slays and spoils. And vainly, with heart divided in sunder, and labour of wavering will, The lord of their host takes counsel with hope if haply their star shine still, If haply some light be left them of chance to renew and redeem the fray; But the will of the black south-wester is lord of the councils of war to-day. One only spirit it quells not, a splendour undarkened of chance or time; Be the praise of his foes with Oquendo for ever, a name as a star sublime. But here what aid in a hero's heart, what help in his hand may be? For ever the dark wind whitens and blackens the hollows and heights of the sea, And galley by galley, divided and desolate, founders; and none takes heed, Nor foe nor friend, if they perish; forlorn, cast off in their uttermost need, They sink in the whelm of the waters, as pebbles by children from shoreward hurled, In the North Sea's waters that end not, nor know they a bourn but the bourn of the world. Past many a secure unavailable harbour, and many a loud stream's mouth, Past Humber and Tees and Tyne and Tweed, they fly, scourged on from the south, And torn by the scourge of the storm-wind that smites as a harper smites on a lyre, And consumed of the storm as the sacrifice loved of their God is consumed with fire, And devoured of the darkness as men that are slain in the fires of his love are devoured, And deflowered of their lives by the storms, as by priests is the spirit of life deflowered. For the wind, of its godlike mercy, relents not, and hounds them ahead to the north, With English hunters at heel, till now is the herd of them past the Forth, All huddled and hurtled seaward; and now need none wage war upon these, Nor huntsmen follow the quarry whose fall is the pastime sought of the seas. Day upon day upon day confounds them, with measureless mists that swell, With drift of rains everlasting and dense as the fumes of ascending hell. The visions of priest and of prophet beholding his enemies bruised of his rod Beheld but the likeness of this that is fallen on the faithful, the friends of God. Northward, and northward, and northward they stagger and shudder and swerve and flit, Dismantled of masts and of yards, with sails by the fangs of the storm-wind split. But north of the headland whose name is Wrath, by the wrath or the ruth of the sea, They are swept or sustained to the westward, and drive through the rollers aloof to the lee. Some strive yet northward for Iceland, and perish: but some through the strom-hewn straits That sunder the Shetlands and Orkneys are borne of the breath which is God's or fate's: And some, by the dawn of September, at last give thanks as for stars that smile, For the winds have swept them to shelter and sight of the cliffs of a Catholic isle. Though many the fierce rocks feed on, and many the merciless heretic slays, Yet some that have laboured to land with their treasure are trustful, and give God praise. And the kernes of murderous Ireland, athirst with a greed everlasting of blood, Unslakable ever with slaughter and spoil, rage down as a ravening flood, To slay and to flay of their shining apparel their brethren whom shipwreck spares; Such faith and such mercy, such love and such manhood, such hands and such hearts are theirs. Short shrift to her foes gives England, but shorter doth Ireland to friends; and worse Fare they that came with a blessing on treason than they that come with a curse. Hacked, harried, and mangled of axes and skenes, three thousand naked and dead Bear witness of Catholic Ireland, what sons of what sires at her breasts are bred. Winds are pitiful, waves are merciful, tempest and storm are kind: The waters that smite may spare, and the thunder is deaf, and the lightning is blind: Of these perchance at his need may a man, though they know it not, yet find grace; But grace, if another be hardened against him, he gets not at this man's face. For his ear that hears and his eye that sees the wreck and the wail of men, And his heart that relents not within him, but hungers, are like as the wolf's in his den. Worthy are these to worship their master, the murderous Lord of lies, Who hath given to the pontiff his servant the keys of the pit and the keys of the skies. Wild famine and red-shod rapine are cruel, and bitter with blood are their feasts; But fiercer than famine and redder than rapine the hands and the hearts of priests. God, God bade these to the battle; and here, on a land by his servants trod, They perish, a lordly blood-offering, subdued by the hands of the servants of God. These also were fed of his priests with faith, with the milk of his word and the wine; These too are fulfilled with the spirit of darkness that guided their quest divine. And here, cast up from the ravening sea on the mild land's merciful breast, This comfort they find of their fellows in worship; this guerdon is theirs of their quest. Death was captain, and doom was pilot, and darkness the chart of their way; Night and hell had in charge and in keeping the host of the foes of day. Invincible, vanquished, impregnable, shattered, a sign to her foes of fear, A sign to the world and the stars of laughter, the fleet of the Lord lies here. Nay, for none may declare the place of the ruin wherein she lies; Nay, for none hath beholden the grave whence never a ghost shall rise. The fleet of the foemen of England hath found not one but a thousand graves; And he that shall number and name them shall number by name and by tale the waves. VII I Sixtus, Pope of the Church whose hope takes flight for heaven to dethrone the sun, Philip, king that wouldst turn our spring to winter, blasted, appalled, undone, Prince and priest, let a mourner's feast give thanks to God for your conquest won. England's heel is upon you: kneel, O priest, O prince, in the dust, and cry, “Lord, why thus? art thou wroth with us whose faith was great in thee, God most high? Whence is this, that the serpent's hiss derides us? Lord, can thy pledged word lie? “God of hell, are its flames that swell quenched now for ever, extinct and dead? Who shall fear thee? or who shall hear the word thy servants who feared thee said? Lord, art thou as the dead gods now, whose arm is shortened, whose rede is read? “Yet we thought it was not for nought thy word was given us, to guard and guide: Yet we deemed that they had not dreamed who put their trust in thee. Hast thou lied? God our Lord, was the sacred sword we drew not drawn on thy Church's side? “England hates thee as hell's own gates; and England triumphs, and Rome bows down: England mocks at thee; England's rocks cast off thy servants to drive and drown: England loathes thee; and fame betroths and plights with England her faith for crown. “Spain clings fast to thee; Spain, aghast with anguish, cries to thee; where art thou? Spain puts trust in thee; lo, the dust that soils and darkens her prostrate brow! Spain is true to thy service; who shall raise up Spain for thy service now? “Who shall praise thee, if none may raise thy servants up, nor affright thy foes? Winter wanes, and the woods and plains forget the likeness of storms and snows: So shall fear of thee fade even here: and what shall follow thee no man knows.” Lords of night, who would breathe your blight on April's morning and August's noon, God your Lord, the condemned, the abhorred, sinks hellward, smitten with deathlike swoon: Death's own dart in his hateful heart now thrills, and night shall receive him soon. God the Devil, thy reign of revel is here for ever eclipsed and fled: God the Liar, everlasting fire lays hold at last on thee, hand and head: God the Accurst, the consuming thirst that burns thee never shall here be fed. II England, queen of the waves whose green inviolate girdle enrings thee round, Mother fair as the morning, where is now the place of thy foemen found? Still the sea that salutes us free proclaims them stricken, acclaims thee crowned. Times may change, and the skies grow strange with signs of treason and fraud and fear: Foes in union of strange communion may rise against thee from far and near: Sloth and greed on thy strength may feed as cankers waxing from year to year. Yet, though treason and fierce unreason should league and lie and defame and smite, We that know thee, how far below thee the hatred burns of the sons of night, We that love thee, behold above thee the witness written of life in light. Life that shines from thee shows forth signs that none may read not but eyeless foes: Hate, born blind, in his abject mind grows hopeful now but as madness grows: Love, born wise, with exultant eyes adores thy glory, beholds and glows. Truth is in thee, and none may win thee to lie, forsaking the face of truth: Freedom lives by the grace she gives thee, born again from thy deathless youth: Faith should fail, and the world turn pale, wert thou the prey of the serpent's tooth. Greed and fraud, unabashed, unawed, may strive to sting thee at heel in vain: Craft and fear and mistrust may leer and mourn and murmur and plead and plain: Thou art thou: and thy sunbright brow is hers that blasted the strength of Spain. Mother, mother beloved, none other could claim in place of thee England's place: Earth bears none that beholds the sun so pure of record, so clothed with grace: Dear our mother, nor son nor brother is thine, as strong or as fair of face. How shalt thou be abased? or how shall fear take hold of thy heart? of thine, England, maiden immortal, laden with charge of life and with hopes divine? Earth shall wither, when eyes turned hither behold not light in her darkness shine. England, none that is born thy son, and lives, by grace of thy glory, free, Lives and yearns not at heart and burns with hope to serve as he worships thee; None may sing thee: the sea-wind's wing beats down our songs as it hails the sea. TO A SEAMEW When I had wings, my brother, Such wings were mine as thine: Such life my heart remembers In all as wild Septembers As this when life seems other, Though sweet, than once was mine; When I had wings, my brother, Such wings were mine as thine. Such life as thrills and quickens The silence of thy flight, Or fills thy note's elation With lordlier exultation Than man's, whose faint heart sickens With hopes and fears that blight Such life as thrills and quickens The silence of thy flight. Thy cry from windward clanging Makes all the cliffs rejoice; Though storm clothe seas with sorrow, Thy call salutes the morrow; While shades of pain seem hanging Round earth's most rapturous voice, Thy cry from windward clanging Makes all the cliffs rejoice. We, sons and sires of seamen, Whose home is all the sea, What place man may, we claim it; But thine—whose thought may name it? Free birds live higher than freemen, And gladlier ye than we— We, sons and sires of seamen, Whose home is all the sea. For you the storm sounds only More notes of more delight Than earth's in sunniest weather: When heaven and sea together Join strengths against the lonely Lost bark borne down by night, For you the storm sounds only More notes of more delight. With wider wing, and louder Long clarion-call of joy, Thy tribe salutes the terror Of darkness, wild as error, But sure as truth, and prouder Than waves with man for toy; With wider wing, and louder Long clarion-call of joy. The wave's wing spreads and flutters, The wave's heart swells and breaks; One moment's passion thrills it, One pulse of power fulfils it And ends the pride it utters When, loud with life that quakes, The wave's wing spreads and flutters, The wave's heart swells and breaks. But thine and thou, my brother, Keep heart and wing more high Than aught may scare or sunder; The waves whose throats are thunder Fall hurtling each on other, And triumph as they die; But thine and thou, my brother, Keep heart and wing more high. More high than wrath or anguish, More strong than pride or fear, The sense or soul half hidden In thee, for us forbidden, Bids thee nor change nor languish, But live thy life as here, More high than wrath or anguish, More strong than pride or fear. We are fallen, even we, whose passion On earth is nearest thine; Who sing, and cease from flying; Who live, and dream of dying: Grey time, in time's grey fashion, Bids wingless creatures pine: We are fallen, even we, whose passion On earth is nearest thine. The lark knows no such rapture, Such joy no nightingale, As sways the songless measure Wherein thy wings take pleasure: Thy love may no man capture, Thy pride may no man quail; The lark knows no such rapture, Such joy no nightingale. And we, whom dreams embolden, We can but creep and sing And watch through heaven's waste hollow The flight no sight may follow To the utter bourne beholden Of none that lack thy wing: And we, whom dreams embolden, We can but creep and sing. Our dreams have wings that falter, Our hearts bear hopes that die; For thee no dream could better A life no fears may fetter, A pride no care can alter, That wots not whence or why Our dreams have wings that falter, Our hearts bear hopes that die. With joy more fierce and sweeter Than joys we deem divine Their lives, by time untarnished, Are girt about and garnished, Who match the wave's full metre And drink the wind's wild wine With joy more fierce and sweeter Than joys we deem divine. Ah, well were I for ever, Wouldst thou change lives with me, And take my song's wild honey, And give me back thy sunny Wide eyes that weary never, And wings that search the sea; Ah, well were I for ever, Wouldst thou change lives with me. Beachy Head: September 1886. PAN AND THALASSIUS A LYRICAL IDYL THALASSIUS Pan! PAN O sea-stray, seed of Apollo, What word wouldst thou have with me? My ways thou wast fain to follow Or ever the years hailed thee Man. Now If August brood on the valleys, If satyrs laugh on the lawns, What part in the wildwood alleys Hast thou with the fleet-foot fauns— Thou? See! Thy feet are a man's—not cloven Like these, not light as a boy's: The tresses and tendrils inwoven That lure us, the lure of them cloys Thee. Us The joy of the wild woods never Leaves free of the thirst it slakes: The wild love throbs in us ever That burns in the dense hot brakes Thus. Life, Eternal, passionate, awless, Insatiable, mutable, dear, Makes all men's law for us lawless: We strive not: how should we fear Strife? We, The birds and the bright winds know not Such joys as are ours in the mild Warm woodland; joys such as grow not In waste green fields of the wild Sea. No; Long since, in the world's wind veering, Thy heart was estranged from me: Sweet Echo shall yield thee not hearing: What have we to do with thee? Go. THALASSIUS Ay! Such wrath on thy nostril quivers As once in Sicilian heat Bade herdsmen quail, and the rivers Shrank, leaving a path for thy feet Dry? Nay, Low down in the hot soft hollow Too snakelike hisses thy spleen: “O sea-stray, seed of Apollo!” What ill hast thou heard or seen? Say. Man Knows well, if he hears beside him The snarl of thy wrath at noon, What evil may soon betide him, Or late, if thou smite not soon, Pan. Me The sound of thy flute, that flatters The woods as they smile and sigh, Charmed fast as it charms thy satyrs, Can charm no faster than I Thee. Fast Thy music may charm the splendid Wide woodland silence to sleep With sounds and dreams of thee blended And whispers of waters that creep Past. Here The spell of thee breathes and passes And bids the heart in me pause, Hushed soft as the leaves and the grasses Are hushed if the storm's foot draws Near. Yet The panic that strikes down strangers Transgressing thy ways unaware Affrights not me nor endangers Through dread of thy secret snare Set. PAN Whence May man find heart to deride me? Who made his face as a star To shine as a God's beside me? Nay, get thee away from us, far Hence. THALASSIUS Then Shall no man's heart, as he raises A hymn to thy secret head, Wax great with the godhead he praises: Thou, God, shalt be like unto dead Men. PAN Grace I take not of men's thanksgiving, I crave not of lips that live; They die, and behold, I am living, While they and their dead Gods give Place. THALASSIUS Yea: Too lightly the words were spoken That mourned or mocked at thee dead: But whose was the word, the token, The song that answered and said Nay? PAN Whose But mine, in the midnight hidden, Clothed round with the strength of night And mysteries of things forbidden For all but the one most bright Muse? THALASSIUS Hers Or thine, O Pan, was the token That gave back empire to thee When power in thy hands lay broken As reeds that quake if a bee Stirs? PAN Whom Have I in my wide woods need of? Urania's limitless eyes Behold not mine end, though they read of A word that shall speak to the skies Doom. THALASSIUS She Gave back to thee kingdom and glory, And grace that was thine of yore, And life to thy leaves, late hoary As weeds cast up from the hoar Sea. Song Can bid faith shine as the morning Though light in the world be none: Death shrinks if her tongue sound warning, Night quails, and beholds the sun Strong. PAN Night Bare rule over men for ages Whose worship wist not of me And gat but sorrows for wages, And hardly for tears could see Light. Call No more on the starry presence Whose light through the long dark swam: Hold fast to the green world's pleasance: For I that am lord of it am All. THALASSIUS God, God Pan, from the glad wood's portal The breaths of thy song blow sweet: But woods may be walked in of mortal Man's thought, where never thy feet Trod. Thine All secrets of growth and of birth are, All glories of flower and of tree, Wheresoever the wonders of earth are; The words of the spell of the sea Mine. A BALLAD OF BATH Like queen enchanted who may not laugh or weep, Glad at heart and guarded from change and care like ours, Girt about with beauty by days and nights that creep Soft as breathless ripples that softly shoreward sweep, Lies the lovely city whose grace no grief deflowers. Age and grey forgetfulness, time that shifts and veers, Touch not thee, our fairest, whose charm no rival nears, Hailed as England's Florence of one whose praise gives grace, Landor, once thy lover, a name that love reveres: Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face. Dawn whereof we know not, and noon whose fruit we reap, Garnered up in record of years that fell like flowers, Sunset liker sunrise along the shining steep Whence thy fair face lightens, and where thy soft springs leap, Crown at once and gird thee with grace of guardian powers. Loved of men beloved of us, souls that fame inspheres, All thine air hath music for him who dreams and hears; Voices mixed of multitudes, feet of friends that pace, Witness why for ever, if heaven's face clouds or clears, Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face. Peace hath here found harbourage mild as very sleep: Not the hills and waters, the fields and wildwood bowers, Smile or speak more tenderly, clothed with peace more deep, Here than memory whispers of days our memories keep Fast with love and laughter and dreams of withered hours. Bright were these as blossom of old, and thought endears Still the fair soft phantoms that pass with smiles or tears, Sweet as roseleaves hoarded and dried wherein we trace Still the soul and spirit of sense that lives and cheers: Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face. City lulled asleep by the chime of passing years, Sweeter smiles thy rest than the radiance round thy peers; Only love and lovely remembrance here have place. Time on thee lies lighter than music on men's ears; Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face. IN A GARDEN Baby, see the flowers! —Baby sees Fairer things than these, Fairer though they be than dreams of ours. Baby, hear the birds! —Baby knows Better songs than those, Sweeter though they sound than sweetest words. Baby, see the moon! —Baby's eyes Laugh to watch it rise, Answering light with love and night with noon. Baby, hear the sea! —Baby's face Takes a graver grace, Touched with wonder what the sound may be. Baby, see the star! —Baby's hand Opens, warm and bland, Calm in claim of all things fair that are. Baby, hear the bells! —Baby's head Bows, as ripe for bed, Now the flowers curl round and close their cells. Baby, flower of light, Sleep, and see Brighter dreams than we, Till good day shall smile away good night. A RHYME [Babe, if rhyme be none] Babe, if rhyme be none For that sweet small word Babe, the sweetest one Ever heard, Right it is and meet Rhyme should keep not true Time with such a sweet Thing as you. Meet it is that rhyme Should not gain such grace: What is April's prime To your face? What to yours is May's Rosiest smile? what sound Like your laughter sways All hearts round? None can tell in metre Fit for ears on earth What sweet star grew sweeter At your birth. Wisdom doubts what may be: Hope, with smile sublime, Trusts: but neither, baby, Knows the rhyme. Wisdom lies down lonely; Hope keeps watch from far; None but one seer only Sees the star. Love alone, with yearning Heart for astrolabe, Takes the star's height, burning O'er the babe. BABY-BIRD Baby-bird, baby-bird, Ne'er a song on earth May be heard, may be heard, Rich as yours in mirth. All your flickering fingers, All your twinkling toes, Play like light that lingers Till the clear song close. Baby-bird, baby-bird, Your grave majestic eyes Like a bird's warbled words Speak, and sorrow dies. Sorrow dies for love's sake, Love grows one with mirth, Even for one white dove's sake, Born a babe on earth. Baby-bird, baby-bird, Chirping loud and long, Other birds hush their words, Hearkening toward your song. Sweet as spring though it ring, Full of love's own lures, Weak and wrong sounds their song, Singing after yours. Baby-bird, baby-bird, The happy heart that hears Seems to win back within Heaven, and cast out fears. Earth and sun seem as one Sweet light and one sweet word Known of none here but one, Known of one sweet bird. OLIVE I Who may praise her? Eyes where midnight shames the sun, Hair of night and sunshine spun, Woven of dawn's or twilight's loom, Radiant darkness, lustrous gloom, Godlike childhood's flowerlike bloom, None may praise aright, nor sing Half the grace wherewith like spring Love arrays her. II Love untold Sings in silence, speaks in light Shed from each fair feature, bright Still from heaven, whence toward us, now Nine years since, she deigned to bow Down the brightness of her brow, Deigned to pass through mortal birth: Reverence calls her, here on earth, Nine years old. III Love's deep duty, Even when love transfigured grows Worship, all too surely knows How, though love may cast out fear, Yet the debt divine and dear Due to childhood's godhead here May by love of man be paid Never; never song be made Worth its beauty. IV Nought is all Sung or said or dreamed or thought Ever, set beside it; nought All the love that man may give— Love whose prayer should be, “Forgive!” Heaven, we see, on earth may live; Earth can thank not heaven, we know, Save with songs that ebb and flow, Rise and fall. V No man living, No man dead, save haply one Now gone homeward past the sun, Ever found such grace as might Tune his tongue to praise aright Children, flowers of love and light, Whom our praise dispraises: we Sing, in sooth, but not as he Sang thanksgiving. VI Hope that smiled, Seeing her new-born beauty, made Out of heaven's own light and shade, Smiled not half so sweetly: love, Seeing the sun, afar above, Warm the nest that rears the dove, Sees, more bright than moon or sun, All the heaven of heavens in one Little child. VII Who may sing her? Wings of angels when they stir Make no music worthy her: Sweeter sound her shy soft words Here than songs of God's own birds Whom the fire of rapture girds Round with light from love's face lit; Hands of angels find no fit Gifts to bring her. VIII Babes at birth Wear as raiment round them cast, Keep as witness toward their past, Tokens left of heaven; and each, Ere its lips learn mortal speech, Ere sweet heaven pass on pass reach, Bears in undiverted eyes Proof of unforgotten skies Here on earth. IX Quenched as embers Quenched with flakes of rain or snow Till the last faint flame burns low, All those lustrous memories lie Dead with babyhood gone by: Yet in her they dare not die: Others, fair as heaven is, yet, Now they share not heaven, forget: She remembers. A WORD WITH THE WIND Lord of days and nights that hear thy word of wintry warning, Wind, whose feet are set on ways that none may tread, Change the nest wherein thy wings are fledged for flight by morning, Change the harbour whence at dawn thy sails are spread. Not the dawn, ere yet the imprisoning night has half released her, More desires the sun's full face of cheer, than we, Well as yet we love the strength of the iron-tongued north-easter, Yearn for wind to meet us as we front the sea. All thy ways are good, O wind, and all the world should fester, Were thy fourfold godhead quenched, or stilled thy strife: Yet the waves and we desire too long the deep south-wester, Whence the waters quicken shoreward, clothed with life. Yet the field not made for ploughing save of keels nor harrowing Save of storm-winds lies unbrightened by thy breath: Banded broad with ruddy samphire glow the sea-banks narrowing Westward, while the sea gleams chill and still as death. Sharp and strange from inland sounds thy bitter note of battle, Blown between grim skies and waters sullen-souled, Till the baffled seas bear back, rocks roar and shingles rattle, Vexed and angered and anhungered and acold. Change thy note, and give the waves their will, and all the measure, Full and perfect, of the music of their might, Let it fill the bays with thunderous notes and throbs of pleasure, Shake the shores with passion, sound at once and smite. Sweet are even the mild low notes of wind and sea, but sweeter Sounds the song whose choral wrath of raging rhyme Bids the shelving shoals keep tune with storm's imperious metre, Bids the rocks and reefs respond in rapturous chime. Sweet the lisp and lulling whisper and luxurious laughter, Soft as love or sleep, of waves whereon the sun Dreams, and dreams not of the darkling hours before nor after, Winged with cloud whose wrath shall bid love's day be done. Yet shall darkness bring the awakening sea a lordlier lover, Clothed with strength more amorous and more strenuous will, Whence her heart of hearts shall kindle and her soul recover Sense of love too keen to lie for love's sake still. Let thy strong south-western music sound, and bid the billows Brighten, proud and glad to feel thy scourge and kiss Sting and soothe and sway them, bowed as aspens bend or willows, Yet resurgent still in breathless rage of bliss. All to-day the slow sleek ripples hardly bear up shore-ward, Charged with sighs more light than laughter, faint and fair, Like a woodland lake's weak wavelets lightly lingering forward, Soft and listless as the slumber-stricken air. Be the sunshine bared or veiled, the sky superb or shrouded, Still the waters, lax and languid, chafed and foiled, Keen and thwarted, pale and patient, clothed with fire or clouded, Vex their heart in vain, or sleep like serpents coiled. Thee they look for, blind and baffled, wan with wrath and weary, Blown for ever back by winds that rock the bird: Winds that seamews breast subdue the sea, and bid the dreary Waves be weak as hearts made sick with hope deferred. Let thy clarion sound from westward, let the south bear token How the glories of thy godhead sound and shine: Bid the land rejoice to see the land-wind's broad wings broken, Bid the sea take comfort, bid the world be thine. Half the world abhors thee beating back the sea, and blackening Heaven with fierce and woful change of fluctuant form: All the world acclaims thee shifting sail again, and slackening Cloud by cloud the close-reefed cordage of the storm. Sweeter fields and brighter woods and lordlier hills than waken Here at sunrise never hailed the sun and thee: Turn thee then, and give them comfort, shed like rain and shaken Far as foam that laughs and leaps along the sea. NEAP-TIDE Far off is the sea, and the land is afar: The low banks reach at the sky, Seen hence, and are heavenward high; Though light for the leap of a boy they are, And the far sea late was nigh. The fair wild fields and the circling downs, The bright sweet marshes and meads All glorious with flowerlike weeds, The great grey churches, the sea-washed towns, Recede as a dream recedes. The world draws back, and the world's light wanes, As a dream dies down and is dead; And the clouds and the gleams overhead Change, and change; and the sea remains, A shadow of dreamlike dread. Wild, and woful, and pale, and grey, A shadow of sleepless fear, A corpse with the night for bier, The fairest thing that beholds the day Lies haggard and hopeless here. And the wind's wings, broken and spent, subside; And the dumb waste world is hoar, And strange as the sea the shore; And shadows of shapeless dreams abide Where life may abide no more. A sail to seaward, a sound from shoreward, And the spell were broken that seems To reign in a world of dreams Where vainly the dreamer's feet make forward And vainly the low sky gleams. The sea-forsaken forlorn deep-wrinkled Salt slanting stretches of sand That slope to the seaward hand, Were they fain of the ripples that flashed and twinkled And laughed as they struck the strand? As bells on the reins of the fairies ring The ripples that kissed them rang, The light from the sundawn sprang, And the sweetest of songs that the world may sing Was theirs when the full sea sang. Now no light is in heaven; and now Not a note of the sea-wind's tune Rings hither: the bleak sky's boon Grants hardly sight of a grey sun's brow— A sun more sad than the moon. More sad than a moon that clouds beleaguer And storm is a scourge to smite, The sick sun's shadowlike light Grows faint as the clouds and the waves wax eager, And withers away from sight. The day's heart cowers, and the night's heart quickens: Full fain would the day be dead And the stark night reign in his stead: The sea falls dumb as the sea-fog thickens And the sunset dies for dread. Outside of the range of time, whose breath Is keen as the manslayer's knife And his peace but a truce for strife, Who knows if haply the shadow of death May be not the light of life? For the storm and the rain and the darkness borrow But an hour from the suns to be, But a strange swift passage, that we May rejoice, who have mourned not to-day, to-morrow, In the sun and the wind and the sea. BY THE WAYSIDE Summer's face was rosiest, skies and woods were mellow, Earth had heaven to friend, and heaven had earth to fellow, When we met where wooded hills and meadows meet. Autumn's face is pale, and all her late leaves yellow, Now that here again we greet. Wan with years whereof this eightieth nears December, Fair and bright with love, the kind old face I know Shines above the sweet small twain whose eyes remember Heaven, and fill with April's light this pale November, Though the dark year's glass run low. Like a rose whose joy of life her silence utters When the birds are loud, and low the lulled wind mutters, Grave and silent shines the boy nigh three years old. Wise and sweet his smile, that falters not nor flutters, Glows, and turns the gloom to gold. Like the new-born sun's that strikes the dark and slays it, So that even for love of light it smiles and dies, Laughs the boy's blithe face whose fair fourth year arrays it All with light of life and mirth that stirs and sways it And fulfils the deep wide eyes. Wide and warm with glowing laughter's exultation, Full of welcome, full of sunbright jubilation, Flash my taller friend's quick eyebeams, charged with glee; But with softer still and sweeter salutation Shine my smaller friend's on me. Little arms flung round my bending neck, that yoke it Fast in tender bondage, draw my face down too Toward the flower-soft face whose dumb deep smiles invoke it; Dumb, but love can read the radiant eyes that woke it, Blue as June's mid heaven is blue. How may men find refuge, how should hearts be shielded, From the weapons thus by little children wielded, When they lift such eyes as light this lustrous face— Eyes that woke love sleeping unwares, and yielded Love for love, a gift of grace, Grace beyond man's merit, love that laughs, forgiving Even the sin of being no more a child, nor worth Trust and love that lavish gifts above man's giving, Touch or glance of eyes and lips the sweetest living, Fair as heaven and kind as earth? NIGHT I FROM THE ITALIAN OF GIOVANNI STROZZI Night, whom in shape so sweet thou here may'st see Sleeping, was by an Angel sculptured thus In marble, and since she sleeps hath life like us: Thou doubt'st? Awake her: she will speak to thee. II FROM THE ITALIAN OF MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI Sleep likes me well, and better yet to know I am but stone. While shame and grief must be, Good hap is mine, to feel not, nor to see: Take heed, then, lest thou wake me: ah, speak low. IN TIME OF MOURNING “Return,” we dare not as we fain Would cry from hearts that yearn: Love dares not bid our dead again Return. O hearts that strain and burn As fires fast fettered burn and strain! Bow down, lie still, and learn. The heart that healed all hearts of pain No funeral rites inurn: Its echoes, while the stars remain, Return. May 1885. THE INTERPRETERS I Days dawn on us that make amends for many Sometimes, When heaven and earth seem sweeter even than any Man's rhymes. Light had not all been quenched in France, or quelled In Greece, Had Homer sung not, or had Hugo held His peace. Had Sappho's self not left her word thus long For token, The sea round Lesbos yet in waves of song Had spoken. II And yet these days of subtler air and finer Delight, When lovelier looks the darkness, and diviner The light— The gift they give of all these golden hours, Whose urn Pours forth reverberate rays or shadowing showers In turn— Clouds, beams, and winds that make the live day's track Seem living— What were they did no spirit give them back Thanksgiving? III Dead air, dead fire, dead shapes and shadows, telling Time nought; Man gives them sense and soul by song, and dwelling In thought. In human thought their being endures, their power Abides: Else were their life a thing that each light hour Derides. The years live, work, sigh, smile, and die, with all They cherish; The soul endures, though dreams that fed it fall And perish. IV In human thought have all things habitation; Our days Laugh, lower, and lighten past, and find no station That stays. But thought and faith are mightier things than time Can wrong, Made splendid once with speech, or made sublime By song. Remembrance, though the tide of change that rolls Wax hoary, Gives earth and heaven, for song's sake and the soul's, Their glory. July 16, 1885. THE RECALL Return, they cry, ere yet your day Set, and the sky grow stern: Return, strayed souls, while yet ye may Return. But heavens beyond us yearn; Yea, heights of heaven above the sway Of stars that eyes discern. The soul whose wings from shoreward stray Makes toward her viewless bourne Though trustless faith and unfaith say, Return. BY TWILIGHT If we dream that desire of the distance above us Should be fettered by fear of the shadows that seem, If we wake, to be nought, but to hate or to love us If we dream, Night sinks on the soul, and the stars as they gleam Speak menace or mourning, with tongues to reprove us That we deemed of them better than terror may deem. But if hope may not lure us, if fear may not move us, Thought lightens the darkness wherein the supreme Pure presence of death shall assure us, and prove us If we dream. A BABY'S EPITAPH April made me: winter laid me here away asleep. Bright as Maytime was my daytime; night is soft and deep: Though the morrow bring forth sorrow, well are ye that weep. Ye that held me dear beheld me not a twelvemonth long: All the while ye saw me smile, ye knew not whence the song Came that made me smile, and laid me here, and wrought you wrong. Angels, calling from your brawling world one undefiled, Homeward bade me, and forbade me here to rest beguiled: Here I sleep not: pass, and weep not here upon your child. ON THE DEATH OF SIR HENRY TAYLOR Fourscore and five times has the gradual year Risen and fulfilled its days of youth and eld Since first the child's eyes opening first beheld Light, who now leaves behind to help us here Light shed from song as starlight from a sphere Serene as summer; song whose charm compelled The sovereign soul made flesh in Artevelde To stand august before us and austere, Half sad with mortal knowledge, all sublime With trust that takes no taint from change or time, Trust in man's might of manhood. Strong and sage, Clothed round with reverence of remembering hearts, He, twin-born with our nigh departing age, Into the light of peace and fame departs. IN MEMORY OF JOHN WILLIAM INCHBOLD Farewell: how should not such as thou fare well, Though we fare ill that love thee, and that live, And know, whate'er the days wherein we dwell May give us, thee again they will not give? Peace, rest, and sleep are all we know of death, And all we dream of comfort: yet for thee, Whose breath of life was bright and strenuous breath, We think the change is other than we see. The seal of sleep set on thine eyes to-day Surely can seal not up the keen swift light That lit them once for ever. Night can slay None save the children of the womb of night. The fire that burns up dawn to bring forth noon Was father of thy spirit: how shouldst thou Die as they die for whom the sun and moon Are silent? Thee the darkness holds not now: Them, while they looked upon the light, and deemed That life was theirs for living in the sun, The darkness held in bondage: and they dreamed, Who knew not that such life as theirs was none. To thee the sun spake, and the morning sang Notes deep and clear as life or heaven: the sea That sounds for them but wild waste music rang Notes that were lost not when they rang for thee. The mountains clothed with light and night and change, The lakes alive with wind and cloud and sun, Made answer, by constraint sublime and strange, To the ardent hand that bade thy will be done. We may not bid the mountains mourn, the sea That lived and lightened from thine hand again Moan, as of old would men that mourned as we A man beloved, a man elect of men, A man that loved them. Vain, divine and vain, The dream that touched with thoughts or tears of ours The spirit of sense that lives in sun and rain, Sings out in birds, and breathes and fades in flowers. Not for our joy they live, and for our grief They die not. Though thine eye be closed, thine hand Powerless as mine to paint them, not a leaf In English woods or glades of Switzerland Falls earlier now, fades faster. All our love Moves not our mother's changeless heart, who gives A little light to eyes and stars above, A little life to each man's heart that lives. A little life to heaven and earth and sea, To stars and souls revealed of night and day, And change, the one thing changeless: yet shall she Cease too, perchance, and perish. Who shall say? Our mother Nature, dark and sweet as sleep, And strange as life and strong as death, holds fast, Even as she holds our hearts alive, the deep Dumb secret of her first-born births and last. But this, we know, shall cease not till the strife Of nights and days and fears and hopes find end; This, through the brief eternities of life, Endures, and calls from death a living friend; The love made strong with knowledge, whence confirmed The whole soul takes assurance, and the past (So by time's measure, not by memory's, termed) Lives present life, and mingles first with last. I, now long since thy guest of many days, Who found thy hearth a brother's, and with thee Tracked in and out the lines of rolling bays And banks and gulfs and reaches of the sea— Deep dens wherein the wrestling water sobs And pants with restless pain of refluent breath Till all the sunless hollow sounds and throbs With ebb and flow of eddies dark as death— I know not what more glorious world, what waves More bright with life,—if brighter aught may live Than those that filled and fled their tidal caves— May now give back the love thou hast to give. Tintagel, and the long Trebarwith sand, Lone Camelford, and Boscastle divine With dower of southern blossom, bright and bland Above the roar of granite-baffled brine, Shall hear no more by joyous night or day From downs or causeways good to rove and ride Or feet of ours or horse-hoofs urge their way That sped us here and there by tower and tide. The headlands and the hollows and the waves, For all our love, forget us: where I am Thou art not: deeper sleeps the shadow on graves Than in the sunless gulf that once we swam. Thou hast swum too soon the sea of death: for us Too soon, but if truth bless love's blind belief Faith, born of hope and memory, says not thus: And joy for thee for me should mean not grief. And joy for thee, if ever soul of man Found joy in change and life of ampler birth Than here pens in the spirit for a span, Must be the life that doubt calls death on earth. For if, beyond the shadow and the sleep, A place there be for souls without a stain, Where peace is perfect, and delight more deep Than seas or skies that change and shine again, There none of all unsullied souls that live May hold a surer station: none may lend More light to hope's or memory's lamp, nor give More joy than thine to those that called thee friend. Yea, joy from sorrow's barren womb is born When faith begets on grief the godlike child: As midnight yearns with starry sense of morn In Arctic summers, though the sea wax wild, So love, whose name is memory, thrills at heart, Remembering and rejoicing in thee, now Alive where love may dream not what thou art But knows that higher than hope or love art thou. “Whatever heaven, if heaven at all may be, Await the sacred souls of good men dead, There, now we mourn who loved him here, is he.” So, sweet and stern of speech, the Roman said, Erect in grief, in trust erect, and gave His deathless dead a deathless life even here Where day bears down on day as wave on wave And not man's smile fades faster than his tear. Albeit this gift be given not me to give, Nor power be mine to break time's silent spell, Not less shall love that dies not while I live Bid thee, beloved in life and death, farewell. NEW YEAR'S DAY New Year, be good to England. Bid her name Shine sunlike as of old on all the sea: Make strong her soul: set all her spirit free: Bind fast her homeborn foes with links of shame More strong than iron and more keen than flame: Seal up their lips for shame's sake: so shall she Who was the light that lightened freedom be, For all false tongues, in all men's eyes the same. O last-born child of Time, earth's eldest lord, God undiscrowned of godhead, who for man Begets all good and evil things that live, Do thou, his new-begotten son, implored Of hearts that hope and fear not, make thy span Bright with such light as history bids thee give. Jan. 1, 1889. TO SIR RICHARD F. BURTON (ON HIS TRANSLATION OF “THE ARABIAN NIGHTS”) Westward the sun sinks, grave and glad; but far Eastward, with laughter and tempestuous tears, Cloud, rain, and splendour as of orient spears, Keen as the sea's thrill toward a kindling star, The sundawn breaks the barren twilight's bar And fires the mist and slays it. Years on years Vanish, but he that hearkens eastward hears Bright music from the world where shadows are. Where shadows are not shadows. Hand in hand A man's word bids them rise and smile and stand And triumph. All that glorious orient glows Defiant of the dusk. Our twilight land Trembles; but all the heaven is all one rose, Whence laughing love dissolves her frosts and snows. NELL GWYN Sweet heart, that no taint of the throne or the stage Could touch with unclean transformation, or alter To the likeness of courtiers whose consciences falter At the smile or the frown, at the mirth or the rage, Of a master whom chance could inflame or assuage, Our Lady of Laughter, invoked in no psalter, Adored of no faithful that cringe and that palter, Praise be with thee yet from a hag-ridden age. Our Lady of Pity thou wast: and to thee All England, whose sons are the sons of the sea, Gives thanks, and will hear not if history snarls When the name of the friend of her sailors is spoken; And thy lover she cannot but love—by the token That thy name was the last on the lips of King Charles. CALIBAN ON ARIEL “His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract” The tongue is loosed of that most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness. Listen: “Lo, The real god of song, Lord Stephano, That's a brave god, if ever god were brave, And bears celestial liquor: but,” the knave (A most ridiculous monster) howls, “we know From Ariel's lips what springs of poison flow, The chicken-heart blasphemer! Hear him rave!” Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam, the witch whose name Is darkness, and the sun her eyes' offence, Though hell's hot sewerage breed no loathlier elf, Men cry not shame upon thee, seeing thy shame So perfect: they but bid thee—“Hag-seed, hence!” THE WEARY WEDDING O daughter, why do ye laugh and weep, One with another? For woe to wake and for will to sleep, Mother, my mother. But weep ye winna the day ye wed, One with another. For tears are dry when the springs are dead, Mother, my mother.

And what shall be sung for your wedding song? One with another. A weary word of a weary wrong, Mother, my mother. The world's way with me runs back, One with another, Wedded in white and buried in black, Mother, my mother. The world's day and the world's night, One with another, Wedded in black and buried in white, Mother, my mother. The world's bliss and the world's teen, One with another, It's red for white and it's black for green, Mother, my mother. The world's will and the world's way, One with another, It's sighing for night and crying for day, Mother, my mother. The world's good and the world's worth, One with another, It's earth to flesh and it's flesh to earth, Mother, my mother. When she came out at the kirkyard gate, (One with another) The bridegroom's mother was there in wait. (Mother, my mother.) O mother, where is my great green bed, (One with another) Silk at the foot and gold at the head, Mother, my mother? Yea, it is ready, the silk and the gold, One with another. But line it well that I lie not cold, Mother, my mother. She laid her cheek to the velvet and vair, One with another; She laid her arms up under her hair. (Mother, my mother.) Her gold hair fell through her arms fu' low, One with another: Lord God, bring me out of woe! (Mother, my mother.) Her gold hair fell in the gay reeds green, One with another: Lord God, bring me out of teen! (Mother, my mother.) O mother, where is my lady gone? (One with another.) In the bride-chamber she makes sore moan: (Mother, my mother.) Her hair falls over the velvet and vair, (One with another) Her great soft tears fall over her hair. (Mother, my mother.) When he came into the bride's chamber, (One with another) Her hands were like pale yellow amber. (Mother, my mother.) Her tears made specks in the velvet and vair, (One with another) The seeds of the reeds made specks in her hair. (Mother, my mother.) He kissed her under the gold on her head; (One with another) The lids of her eyes were like cold lead. (Mother, my mother.) He kissed her under the fall of her chin; (One with another) There was right little blood therein. (Mother, my mother.) He kissed her under her shoulder sweet; (One with another) Her throat was weak, with little heat. (Mother, my mother.) He kissed her down by her breast-flowers red, One with another; They were like river-flowers dead. (Mother, my mother.) What ails you now o' your weeping, wife? (One with another.) It ails me sair o' my very life. (Mother, my mother.) What ails you now o' your weary ways? (One with another.) It ails me sair o' my long life-days. (Mother, my mother.) Nay, ye are young, ye are over fair. (One with another.) Though I be young, what needs ye care? (Mother, my mother.) Nay, ye are fair, ye are over sweet. (One with another.) Though I be fair, what needs ye greet? (Mother, my mother.) Nay, ye are mine while I hold my life. (One with another.) O fool, will ye marry the worm for a wife? (Mother, my mother.) Nay, ye are mine while I have my breath. (One with another.) O fool, will ye marry the dust of death? (Mother, my mother.) Yea, ye are mine, we are handfast wed, One with another. Nay, I am no man's; nay, I am dead, Mother, my mother. THE WINDS O weary fa' the east wind, And weary fa' the west: And gin I were under the wan waves wide I wot weel wad I rest. O weary fa' the north wind, And weary fa' the south: The sea went ower my good lord's head Or ever he kissed my mouth. Weary fa' the windward rocks, And weary fa' the lee: They might hae sunken sevenscore ships, And let my love's gang free. And weary fa' ye, mariners a', And weary fa' the sea: It might hae taken an hundred men, And let my ae love be. A LYKE-WAKE SONG Fair of face, full of pride, Sit ye down by a dead man's side. Ye sang songs a' the day: Sit down at night in the red worm's way. Proud ye were a' day long: Ye'll be but lean at evensong. Ye had gowd kells on your hair: Nae man kens what ye were. Ye set scorn by the silken stuff: Now the grave is clean enough. Ye set scorn by the rubis ring: Now the worm is a saft sweet thing. Fine gold and blithe fair face, Ye are come to a grimly place. Gold hair and glad grey een, Nae man kens if ye have been. A REIVER'S NECK-VERSE Some die singing, and some die swinging, And weel mot a' they be: Some die playing, and some die praying, And I wot sae winna we, my dear, And I wot sae winna we. Some die sailing, and some die wailing, And some die fair and free: Some die flyting, and some die fighting, But I for a fause love's fee, my dear, But I for a fause love's fee. Some die laughing, and some die quaffing, And some die high on tree: Some die spinning, and some die sinning, But faggot and fire for ye, my dear, Faggot and fire for ye. Some die weeping, and some die sleeping, And some die under sea: Some die ganging, and some die hanging, And a twine of a tow for me, my dear, A twine of a tow for me. THE WITCH-MOTHER “O where will ye gang to and where will ye sleep, Against the night begins?” “My bed is made wi' cauld sorrows, My sheets are lined wi' sins. “And a sair grief sitting at my foot, And a sair grief at my head; And dule to lay me my laigh pillows, And teen till I be dead. “And the rain is sair upon my face, And sair upon my hair; And the wind upon my weary mouth, That never may man kiss mair. “And the snow upon my heavy lips, That never shall drink nor eat; And shame to cledding, and woe to wedding, And pain to drink and meat. “But woe be to my bairns' father, And ever ill fare he: He has tane a braw bride hame to him, Cast out my bairns and me.” “And what shall they have to their marriage meat This day they twain are wed?” “Meat of strong crying, salt of sad sighing, And God restore the dead.” “And what shall they have to their wedding wine This day they twain are wed?” “Wine of weeping, and draughts of sleeping, And God raise up the dead.” She's tane her to the wild woodside, Between the flood and fell: She's sought a rede against her need Of the fiend that bides in hell. She's tane her to the wan burnside, She's wrought wi' sang and spell: She's plighted her soul for doom and dole To the fiend that bides in hell. She's set her young son to her breast, Her auld son to her knee: Says, “Weel for you the night, bairnies, And weel the morn for me.” She looked fu' lang in their een, sighing, And sair and sair grat she: She has slain her young son at her breast, Her auld son at her knee. She's sodden their flesh wi' saft water, She's mixed their blood with wine: She's tane her to the braw bride-house, Where a' were boun' to dine. She poured the red wine in his cup, And his een grew fain to greet: She set the baked meats at his hand, And bade him drink and eat. Says, “Eat your fill of your flesh, my lord, And drink your fill of your wine; For a' thing's yours and only yours That has been yours and mine.” Says, “Drink your fill of your wine, my lord, And eat your fill of your bread: I would they were quick in my body again, Or I that bare them dead.” He struck her head frae her fair body, And dead for grief he fell: And there were twae mair sangs in heaven, And twae mair sauls in hell. THE BRIDE'S TRAGEDY “The wind wears roun', the day wears doun, The moon is grisly grey; There's nae man rides by the mirk muirsides, Nor down the dark Tyne's way.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “And winna ye watch the night wi' me, And winna ye wake the morn? Foul shame it were that your ae mither Should brook her ae son's scorn.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “O mither, I may not sleep nor stay, My weird is ill to dree; For a fause faint lord of the south seaboard Wad win my bride of me.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “The winds are strang, and the nights are lang, And the ways are sair to ride: And I maun gang to wreak my wrang, And ye maun bide and bide.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “Gin I maun bide and bide, Willie, I wot my weird is sair: Weel may ye get ye a light love yet, But never a mither mair.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “O gin the morrow be great wi' sorrow, The wyte be yours of a': But though ye slay me that haud and stay me, The weird ye will maun fa'.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. When cocks were crawing and day was dawing, He's boun' him forth to ride: And the ae first may he's met that day Was fause Earl Robert's bride. In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. O blithe and braw were the bride-folk a', But sad and saft rade she; And sad as doom was her fause bridegroom, But fair and fain was he. In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “And winna ye bide, sae saft ye ride, And winna ye speak wi' me? For mony's the word and the kindly word I have spoken aft wi' thee.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “My lamp was lit yestreen, Willie, My window-gate was wide: But ye camena nigh me till day came by me And made me not your bride.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. He's set his hand to her bridle-rein, He's turned her horse away: And the cry was sair, and the wrath was mair, And fast and fain rode they. In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. But when they came by Chollerford, I wot the ways were fell; For broad and brown the spate swang down, And the lift was mirk as hell. In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “And will ye ride yon fell water, Or will ye bide for fear? Nae scathe ye'll win o' your father s kin, Though they should slay me here.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “I had liefer ride yon fell water, Though strange it be to ride, Than I wad stand on the fair green strand And thou be slain beside.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “I had liefer swim yon wild water, Though sair it be to bide, Than I wad stand at a strange man's hand, To be a strange man's bride.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. “I had liefer drink yon dark water, Wi' the stanes to make my bed, And the faem to hide me, and thou beside me, Than I wad see thee dead.” In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. He's kissed her twice, he's kissed her thrice, On cheek and lip and chin: He's wound her rein to his hand again, And lightly they leapt in. In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. Their hearts were high to live or die, Their steeds were stark of limb: But the stream was starker, the spate was darker, Than man might live and swim. In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. The first ae step they strode therein, It smote them foot and knee: But ere they wan to the mid water The spate was as the sea. In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. But when they wan to the mid water, It smote them hand and head: And nae man knows but the wave that flows Where they lie drowned and dead. In, in, out and in, Blaws the wind and whirls the whin. A JACOBITE'S FAREWELL 1716 There's nae mair lands to tyne, my dear, And nae mair lives to gie: Though a man think sair to live nae mair, There's but one day to die. For a' things come and a' days gane, What needs ye rend your hair? But kiss me till the morn's morrow, Then I'll kiss ye nae mair. O lands are lost and life's losing, And what were they to gie? Fu' mony a man gives all he can, But nae man else gives ye. Our king wons ower the sea's water, And I in prison sair: But I'll win out the morn's morrow, And ye'll see me nae mair. A JACOBITE'S EXILE 1746 The weary day rins down and dies, The weary night wears through: And never an hour is fair wi' flower, And never a flower wi' dew. I would the day were night for me, I would the night were day: For then would I stand in my ain fair land, As now in dreams I may. O lordly flow the Loire and Seine, And loud the dark Durance: But bonnier shine the braes of Tyne Than a' the fields of France; And the waves of Till that speak sae still Gleam goodlier where they glance. O weel were they that fell fighting On dark Drumossie's day: They keep their hame ayont the faem, And we die far away. O sound they sleep, and saft, and deep, But night and day wake we; And ever between the sea-banks green Sounds loud the sundering sea. And ill we sleep, sae sair we weep, But sweet and fast sleep they; And the mool that haps them roun' and laps them Is e'en their country's clay; But the land we tread that are not dead Is strange as night by day. Strange as night in a strange man's sight, Though fair as dawn it be: For what is here that a stranger's cheer Should yet wax blithe to see? The hills stand steep, the dells lie deep, The fields are green and gold: The hill-streams sing, and the hill-sides ring, As ours at home of old. But hills and flowers are nane of ours, And ours are oversea: And the kind strange land whereon we stand, It wotsna what were we Or ever we came, wi' scathe and shame, To try what end might be. Scathe, and shame, and a waefu' name, And a weary time and strange, Have they that seeing a weird for dreeing Can die, and cannot change. Shame and scorn may we thole that mourn, Though sair be they to dree: But ill may we bide the thoughts we hide, Mair keen than wind and sea. Ill may we thole the night's watches, And ill the weary day: And the dreams that keep the gates of sleep, A waefu' gift gie they; For the sangs they sing us, the sights they bring us, The morn blaws all away. On Aikenshaw the sun blinks braw, The burn rins blithe and fain: There's nought wi' me I wadna gie To look thereon again. On Keilder-side the wind blaws wide; There sounds nae hunting-horn That rings sae sweet as the winds that beat Round banks where Tyne is born. The Wansbeck sings with all her springs, The bents and braes give ear; But the wood that rings wi' the sang she sings I may not see nor hear; For far and far thae blithe burns are, And strange is a' thing near. The light there lightens, the day there brightens, The loud wind there lives free: Nae light comes nigh me or wind blaws by me That I wad hear or see. But O gin I were there again, Afar ayont the faem, Cauld and dead in the sweet saft bed That haps my sires at hame! We'll see nae mair the sea-banks fair, And the sweet grey gleaming sky, And the lordly strand of Northumberland, And the goodly towers thereby: And none shall know but the winds that blow The graves wherein we lie. THE TYNESIDE WIDOW There's mony a man loves land and life, Loves life and land and fee; And mony a man loves fair women, But never a man loves me, my love, But never a man loves me. O weel and weel for a' lovers, I wot weel may they be; And weel and weel for a' fair maidens, But aye mair woe for me, my love, But aye mair woe for me. O weel be wi' you, ye sma' flowers, Ye flowers and every tree; And weel be wi' you, a' birdies, But teen and tears wi' me, my love, But teen and tears wi' me. O weel be yours, my three brethren, And ever weel be ye; Wi' deeds for doing and loves for wooing, But never a love for me, my love, But never a love for me. And weel be yours, my seven sisters, And good love-days to see, And long life-days and true lovers, But never a day for me, my love, But never a day for me. Good times wi' you, ye bauld riders, By the hieland and the lee; And by the leeland and by the hieland It's weary times wi' me, my love, It's weary times wi' me. Good days wi' you, ye good sailors, Sail in and out the sea; And by the beaches and by the reaches It's heavy days wi' me, my love, It's heavy days wi' me. I had his kiss upon my mouth, His bairn upon my knee; I would my soul and body were twain, And the bairn and the kiss wi' me, my love, And the bairn and the kiss wi' me. The bairn down in the mools, my dear, O saft and saft lies she; I would the mools were ower my head, And the young bairn fast wi' me, my love, And the young bairn fast wi' me. The father under the faem, my dear, O sound and sound sleeps he; I would the faem were ower my face, And the father lay by me, my love, And the father lay by me. I would the faem were ower my face, Or the mools on my ee-bree; And waking-time with a' lovers, But sleeping-time wi' me, my love, But sleeping-time wi' me. I would the mools were meat in my mouth, The saut faem in my ee; And the land-worm and the water-worm To feed fu' sweet on me, my love, To feed fu' sweet on me. My life is sealed with a seal of love, And locked with love for a key; And I lie wrang and I wake lang, But ye tak' nae thought for me, my love, But ye tak' nae thought for me. We were weel fain of love, my dear, O fain and fain were we; It was weel with a' the weary world, But O, sae weel wi' me, my love, But O, sae weel wi' me. We were nane ower mony to sleep, my dear, I wot we were but three; And never a bed in the weary world For my bairn and my dear and me, my love, For my bairn and my dear and me. DEDICATION [The years are many, the changes more] The years are many, the changes more, Since wind and sun on the wild sweet shore Where Joyous Gard stands stark by the sea With face as bright as in years of yore Shone, swept, and sounded, and laughed for glee More deep than a man's or a child's may be, On a day when summer was wild and glad, And the guests of the wind and the sun were we. The light that lightens from seasons clad With darkness now, is it glad or sad? Not sad but glad should it shine, meseems, On eyes yet fain of the joy they had. For joy was there with us; joy that gleams And murmurs yet in the world of dreams Where thought holds fast, as a constant warder, The days when I rode by moors and streams, Reining my rhymes into buoyant order Through honied leagues of the northland border. Though thought or memory fade, and prove A faithless keeper, a thriftless hoarder, One landmark never can change remove, One sign can the years efface not. Love, More strong than death or than doubt may be, Treads down their strengths, and abides above. Yea, change and death are his servants: we, Whom love of the dead links fast, though free, May smile as they that beheld the dove Bear home her signal across the sea. SONGS OF THE SPRINGTIDES DEDICATION TO EDWARD JOHN TRELAWNY A sea-mew on a sea-king's wrist alighting, As the north sea-wind caught and strained and curled The raven-figured flag that led men fighting From field to green field of the water-world, Might find such brief high favour at his hand For wings imbrued with brine, with foam impearled, As these my songs require at yours on land, That durst not save for love's free sake require, Being lightly born between the foam and sand, But reared by hope and memory and desire Of lives that were and life that is to be, Even such as filled his heavenlier song with fire Whose very voice, that sang to set man free, Was in your ears as ever in ours his lyre, Once, ere the flame received him from the sea. THALASSIUS Upon the flowery forefront of the year, One wandering by the grey-green April sea Found on a reach of shingle and shallower sand Inlaid with starrier glimmering jewellery Left for the sun's love and the light wind's cheer Along the foam-flowered strand Breeze-brightened, something nearer sea than land Though the last shoreward blossom-fringe was near, A babe asleep with flower-soft face that gleamed To sun and seaward as it laughed and dreamed, Too sure of either love for either's fear, Albeit so birdlike slight and light, it seemed Nor man nor mortal child of man, but fair As even its twin-born tenderer spray-flowers were, That the wind scatters like an Oread's hair. For when July strewed fire on earth and sea The last time ere that year, Out of the flame of morn Cymothoe Beheld one brighter than the sunbright sphere Move toward her from its fieriest heart, whence trod The live sun's very God, Across the foam-bright water-ways that are As heavenlier heavens with star for answering star, And on her eyes and hair and maiden mouth Felt a kiss falling fierier than the South And heard above afar A noise of songs and wind-enamoured wings And lutes and lyres of milder and mightier strings, And round the resonant radiance of his car Where depth is one with height, Light heard as music, music seen as light. And with that second moondawn of the spring's That fosters the first rose, A sun-child whiter than the sunlit snows Was born out of the world of sunless things That round the round earth flows and ebbs and flows. But he that found the sea-flower by the sea And took to foster like a graft of earth Was born of man's most highest and heavenliest birth, Free-born as winds and stars and waves are free; A warrior grey with glories more than years, Though more of years than change the quick to dead Had rained their light and darkness on his head; A singer that in time's and memory's ears Should leave such words to sing as all his peers Might praise with hallowing heat of rapturous tears Till all the days of human flight were fled. And at his knees his fosterling was fed Not with man's wine and bread Nor mortal mother-milk of hopes and fears, But food of deep memorial days long sped; For bread with wisdom and with song for wine Clear as the full calm's emerald hyaline. And from his grave glad lips the boy would gather Fine honey of song-notes goldener than gold, More sweet than bees make of the breathing heather, That he, as glad and bold, Might drink as they, and keep his spirit from cold. And the boy loved his laurel-laden hair As his own father's risen on the eastern air, And that less white brow-binding bayleaf bloom More than all flowers his father's eyes relume; And those high songs he heard, More than all notes of any landward bird, More than all sounds less free Than the wind's quiring to the choral sea. High things the high song taught him; how the breath Too frail for life may be more strong than death; And this poor flash of sense in life, that gleams As a ghost's glory in dreams, More stabile than the world's own heart's root seems, By that strong faith of lordliest love which gives To death's own sightless-seeming eyes a light Clearer, to death's bare bones a verier might, Than shines or strikes from any man that lives. How he that loves life overmuch shall die The dog's death, utterly: And he that much less loves it than he hates All wrongdoing that is done Anywhere always underneath the sun Shall live a mightier life than time's or fate's. One fairer thing he shewed him, and in might More strong than day and night Whose strengths build up time's towering period: Yea, one thing stronger and more high than God, Which if man had not, then should God not be: And that was Liberty. And gladly should man die to gain, he said, Freedom; and gladlier, having lost, lie dead. For man's earth was not, nor the sweet sea-waves His, nor his own land, nor its very graves, Except they bred not, bore not, hid not slaves; But all of all that is, Were one man free in body and soul, were his. And the song softened, even as heaven by night Softens, from sunnier down to starrier light, And with its moonbright breath Blessed life for death's sake, and for life's sake death. Till as the moon's own beam and breath confuse In one clear hueless haze of glimmering hues The sea's line and the land's line and the sky's, And light for love of darkness almost dies, As darkness only lives for light's dear love, Whose hands the web of night is woven of, So in that heaven of wondrous words were life And death brought out of strife; Yea, by that strong spell of serene increase Brought out of strife to peace. And the song lightened, as the wind at morn Flashes, and even with lightning of the wind Night's thick-spun web is thinned And all its weft unwoven and overworn Shrinks, as might love from scorn. And as when wind and light on water and land Leap as twin gods from heavenward hand in hand, And with the sound and splendour of their leap Strike darkness dead, and daunt the spirit of sleep, And burn it up with fire; So with the light that lightened from the lyre Was all the bright heat in the child's heart stirred And blown with blasts of music into flame Till even his sense became Fire, as the sense that fires the singing bird Whose song calls night by name. And in the soul within the sense began The manlike passion of a godlike man, And in the sense within the soul again Thoughts that make men of gods and gods of men. For love the high song taught him: love that turns God's heart toward man as man's to Godward; love That life and death and life are fashioned of, From the first breath that burns Half kindled on the flowerlike yeanling's lip, So light and faint that life seems like to slip, To that yet weaklier drawn When sunset dies of night's devouring dawn. But the man dying not wholly as all men dies If aught be left of his in live men's eyes Out of the dawnless dark of death to rise; If aught of deed or word Be seen for all time or of all time heard. Love, that though body and soul were overthrown Should live for love's sake of itself alone, Though spirit and flesh were one thing doomed and dead, Not wholly annihilated. Seeing even the hoariest ash-flake that the pyre Drops, and forgets the thing was once afire And gave its heart to feed the pile's full flame Till its own heart its own heat overcame, Outlives its own life, though by scarce a span, As such men dying outlive themselves in man, Outlive themselves for ever; if the heat Outburn the heart that kindled it, the sweet Outlast the flower whose soul it was, and flit Forth of the body of it Into some new shape of a strange perfume More potent than its light live spirit of bloom, How shall not something of that soul relive, That only soul that had such gifts to give As lighten something even of all men's doom Even from the labouring womb Even to the seal set on the unopening tomb? And these the loving light of song and love Shall wrap and lap round and impend above, Imperishable; and all springs born illume Their sleep with brighter thoughts than wake the dove To music, when the hillside winds resume The marriage-song of heather-flower and broom And all the joy thereof. And hate the song too taught him: hate of all That brings or holds in thrall Of spirit or flesh, free-born ere God began, The holy body and sacred soul of man. And wheresoever a curse was or a chain, A throne for torment or a crown for bane Rose, moulded out of poor men's molten pain, There, said he, should man's heaviest hate be set Inexorably, to faint not or forget Till the last warmth bled forth of the last vein In flesh that none should call a king's again, Seeing wolves and dogs and birds that plague-strike air Leave the last bone of all the carrion bare. And hope the high song taught him: hope whose eyes Can sound the seas unsoundable, the skies Inaccessible of eyesight; that can see What earth beholds not, hear what wind and sea Hear not, and speak what all these crying in one Can speak not to the sun. For in her sovereign eyelight all things are Clear as the closest seen and kindlier star That marries morn and even and winter and spring With one love's golden ring. For she can see the days of man, the birth Of good and death of evil things on earth Inevitable and infinite, and sure As present pain is, or herself is pure. Yea, she can hear and see, beyond all things That lighten from before Time's thunderous wings Through the awful circle of wheel-winged periods, The tempest of the twilight of all Gods: And higher than all the circling course they ran The sundawn of the spirit that was man. And fear the song too taught him; fear to be Worthless the dear love of the wind and sea That bred him fearless, like a sea-mew reared In rocks of man's foot feared, Where nought of wingless life may sing or shine. Fear to wax worthless of that heaven he had When all the life in all his limbs was glad And all the drops in all his veins were wine And all the pulses music; when his heart, Singing, bade heaven and wind and sea bear part In one live song's reiterance, and they bore: Fear to go crownless of the flower he wore When the winds loved him and the waters knew, The blithest life that clove their blithe life through With living limbs exultant, or held strife More amorous than all dalliance aye anew With the bright breath and strength of their large life, With all strong wrath of all sheer winds that blew, All glories of all storms of the air that fell Prone, ineluctable, With roar from heaven of revel, and with hue As of a heaven turned hell. For when the red blast of their breath had made All heaven aflush with light more dire than shade, He felt it in his blood and eyes and hair Burn as if all the fires of the earth and air Had laid strong hold upon his flesh, and stung The soul behind it as with serpent's tongue, Forked like the loveliest lightnings: nor could bear But hardly, half distraught with strong delight, The joy that like a garment wrapped him round And lapped him over and under With raiment of great light And rapture of great sound At every loud leap earthward of the thunder From heaven's most furthest bound: So seemed all heaven in hearing and in sight, Alive and mad with glory and angry joy, That something of its marvellous mirth and might Moved even to madness, fledged as even for flight, The blood and spirit of one but mortal boy. So, clothed with love and fear that love makes great, And armed with hope and hate, He set first foot upon the spring-flowered ways That all feet pass and praise. And one dim dawn between the winter and spring, In the sharp harsh wind harrying heaven and earth To put back April that had borne his birth From sunward on her sunniest shower-struck wing, With tears and laughter for the dew-dropt thing, Slight as indeed a dew-drop, by the sea One met him lovelier than all men may be, God-featured, with god's eyes; and in their might Somewhat that drew men's own to mar their sight, Even of all eyes drawn toward him: and his mouth Was as the very rose of all men's youth, One rose of all the rose-beds in the world: But round his brows the curls were snakes that curled, And like his tongue a serpent's; and his voice Speaks death, and bids rejoice. Yet then he spake no word, seeming as dumb, A dumb thing mild and hurtless; nor at first From his bowed eyes seemed any light to come, Nor his meek lips for blood or tears to thirst: But as one blind and mute in mild sweet wise Pleading for pity of piteous lips and eyes, He strayed with faint bare lily-lovely feet Helpless, and flowerlike sweet: Nor might man see, not having word hereof, That this of all gods was the great god Love. And seeing him lovely and like a little child That wellnigh wept for wonder that it smiled And was so feeble and fearful, with soft speech The youth bespake him softly; but there fell From the sweet lips no sweet word audible That ear or thought might reach: No sound to make the dim cold silence glad, No breath to thaw the hard harsh air with heat; Only the saddest smile of all things sweet, Only the sweetest smile of all things sad. And so they went together one green way Till April dying made free the world for May; And on his guide suddenly Love's face turned, And in his blind eyes burned Hard light and heat of laughter; and like flame That opens in a mountain's ravening mouth To blear and sear the sunlight from the south, His mute mouth opened, and his first word came: ‘Knowest thou me now by name?’ And all his stature waxed immeasurable, As of one shadowing heaven and lightening hell; And statelier stood he than a tower that stands And darkens with its darkness far-off sands Whereon the sky leans red; And with a voice that stilled the winds he said: ‘I am he that was thy lord before thy birth, I am he that is thy lord till thou turn earth: I make the night more dark, and all the morrow Dark as the night whose darkness was my breath: O fool, my name is sorrow; Thou fool, my name is death.’ And he that heard spake not, and looked right on Again, and Love was gone. Through many a night toward many a wearier day His spirit bore his body down its way. Through many a day toward many a wearier night His soul sustained his sorrows in her sight. And earth was bitter, and heaven, and even the sea Sorrowful even as he. And the wind helped not, and the sun was dumb; And with too long strong stress of grief to be His heart grew sere and numb. And one bright eve ere summer in autumn sank At stardawn standing on a grey sea-bank He felt the wind fitfully shift and heave As toward a stormier eve; And all the wan wide sea shuddered; and earth Shook underfoot as toward some timeless birth, Intolerable and inevitable; and all Heaven, darkling, trembled like a stricken thrall. And far out of the quivering east, and far From past the moonrise and its guiding star, Began a noise of tempest and a light That was not of the lightning; and a sound Rang with it round and round That was not of the thunder; and a flight As of blown clouds by night, That was not of them; and with songs and cries That sang and shrieked their soul out at the skies A shapeless earthly storm of shapes began From all ways round to move in on the man, Clamorous against him silent; and their feet Were as the wind's are fleet, And their shrill songs were as wild birds' are sweet. And as when all the world of earth was wronged And all the host of all men driven afoam By the red hand of Rome, Round some fierce amphitheatre overthronged With fair clear faces full of bloodier lust Than swells and stings the tiger when his mood Is fieriest after blood And drunk with trampling of the murderous must That soaks and stains the tortuous close-coiled wood Made monstrous with its myriad-mustering brood, Face by fair face panted and gleamed and pressed, And breast by passionate breast Heaved hot with ravenous rapture, as they quaffed The red ripe full fume of the deep live draught, The sharp quick reek of keen fresh bloodshed, blown Through the dense deep drift up to the emperor's throne From the under steaming sands With clamour of all-applausive throats and hands, Mingling in mirthful time With shrill blithe mockeries of the lithe-limbed mime: So from somewhence far forth of the unbeholden, Dreadfully driven from over and after and under, Fierce, blown through fifes of brazen blast and golden, With sound of chiming waves that drown the thunder Or thunder that strikes dumb the sea's own chimes, Began the bellowing of the bull-voiced mimes, Terrible; firs bowed down as briars or palms Even at the breathless blast as of a breeze Fulfilled with clamour and clangour and storms of psalms; Red hands rent up the roots of old-world trees, Thick flames of torches tossed as tumbling seas Made mad the moonless and infuriate air That, ravening, revelled in the riotous hair And raiment of the furred Bassarides. So came all those in on him; and his heart, As out of sleep suddenly struck astart, Danced, and his flesh took fire of theirs, and grief Was as a last year's leaf Blown dead far down the wind's way; and he set His pale mouth to the brightest mouth it met That laughed for love against his lips, and bade Follow; and in following all his blood grew glad And as again a sea-bird's; for the wind Took him to bathe him deep round breast and brow Not as it takes a dead leaf drained and thinned, But as the brightest bay-flower blown on bough, Set springing toward it singing: and they rode By many a vine-leafed, many a rose-hung road, Exalt with exultation; many a night Set all its stars upon them as for spies On many a moon-bewildering mountain-height Where he rode only by the fierier light Of his dread lady's hot sweet hungering eyes. For the moon wandered witless of her way, Spell-stricken by strong magic in such wise As wizards use to set the stars astray. And in his ears the music that makes mad Beat always; and what way the music bade, That alway rode he; nor was any sleep His, nor from height nor deep. But heaven was as red iron, slumberless, And had no heart to bless; And earth lay sere and darkling as distraught, And help in her was nought. Then many a midnight, many a morn and even, His mother, passing forth of her fair heaven, With goodlier gifts than all save gods can give From earth or from the heaven where sea-things live, With shine of sea-flowers through the bay-leaf braid Woven for a crown her foam-white hands had made To crown him with land's laurel and sea-dew, Sought the sea-bird that was her boy: but he Sat panther-throned beside Erigone, Riding the red ways of the revel through Midmost of pale-mouthed passion's crownless crew. Till on some winter's dawn of some dim year He let the vine-bit on the panther's lip Slide, and the green rein slip, And set his eyes to seaward, nor gave ear If sound from landward hailed him, dire or dear; And passing forth of all those fair fierce ranks Back to the grey sea-banks, Against a sea-rock lying, aslant the steep, Fell after many sleepless dreams on sleep. And in his sleep the dun green light was shed Heavily round his head That through the veil of sea falls fathom-deep, Blurred like a lamp's that when the night drops dead Dies; and his eyes gat grace of sleep to see The deep divine dark dayshine of the sea, Dense water-walls and clear dusk water-ways, Broad-based, or branching as a sea-flower sprays That side or this dividing; and anew The glory of all her glories that he knew. And in sharp rapture of recovering tears He woke on fire with yearnings of old years, Pure as one purged of pain that passion bore, Ill child of bitter mother; for his own Looked laughing toward him from her midsea throne, Up toward him there ashore. Thence in his heart the great same joy began, Of child that made him man: And turned again from all hearts else on quest, He communed with his own heart, and had rest. And like sea-winds upon loud waters ran His days and dreams together, till the joy Burned in him of the boy. Till the earth's great comfort and the sweet sea's breath Breathed and blew life in where was heartless death, Death spirit-stricken of soul-sick days, where strife Of thought and flesh made mock of death and life. And grace returned upon him of his birth Where heaven was mixed with heavenlike sea and earth; And song shot forth strong wings that took the sun From inward, fledged with might of sorrow and mirth And father's fire made mortal in his son. Nor was not spirit of strength in blast and breeze To exalt again the sun's child and the sea's; For as wild mares in Thessaly grow great With child of ravishing winds, that violate Their leaping length of limb with manes like fire And eyes outburning heaven's With fires more violent than the lightning levin's And breath drained out and desperate of desire, Even so the spirit in him, when winds grew strong, Grew great with child of song. Nor less than when his veins first leapt for joy To draw delight in such as burns a boy, Now too the soul of all his senses felt The passionate pride of deep sea-pulses dealt Through nerve and jubilant vein As from the love and largess of old time, And with his heart again The tidal throb of all the tides keep rhyme And charm him from his own soul's separate sense With infinite and invasive influence That made strength sweet in him and sweetness strong, Being now no more a singer, but a song. Till one clear day when brighter sea-wind blew And louder sea-shine lightened, for the waves Were full of godhead and the light that saves, His father's, and their spirit had pierced him through, He felt strange breath and light all round him shed That bowed him down with rapture; and he knew His father's hand, hallowing his humbled head, And the old great voice of the old good time, that said: “Child of my sunlight and the sea, from birth A fosterling and fugitive on earth; Sleepless of soul as wind or wave or fire, A manchild with an ungrown God's desire; Because thou hast loved nought mortal more than me, Thy father, and thy mother-hearted sea; Because thou hast set thine heart to sing, and sold Life and life's love for song, God's living gold; Because thou hast given thy flower and fire of youth To feed men's hearts with visions, truer than truth; Because thou hast kept in those world-wandering eyes The light that makes me music of the skies; Because thou hast heard with world-unwearied ears The music that puts light into the spheres; Have therefore in thine heart and in thy mouth The sound of song that mingles north and south, The song of all the winds that sing of me, And in thy soul the sense of all the sea.” ON THE CLIFFS ?????????? ?????. Sappho. Between the moondawn and the sundown here The twilight hangs half starless; half the sea Still quivers as for love or pain or fear Or pleasure mightier than these all may be A man's live heart might beat Wherein a God's with mortal blood should meet And fill its pulse too full to bear the strain With fear or love or pleasure's twin-born, pain. Fiercely the gaunt woods to the grim soil cling That bears for all fair fruits Wan wild sparse flowers of windy and wintry spring Between the tortive serpent-shapen roots Wherethrough their dim growth hardly strikes and shoots And shews one gracious thing Hardly, to speak for summer one sweet word Of summer's self scarce heard. But higher the steep green sterile fields, thick-set With flowerless hawthorn even to the upward verge Whence the woods gathering watch new cliffs emerge Higher than their highest of crowns that sea-winds fret, Hold fast, for all that night or wind can say, Some pale pure colour yet, Too dim for green and luminous for grey. Between the climbing inland cliffs above And these beneath that breast and break the bay, A barren peace too soft for hate or love Broods on an hour too dim for night or day. O wind, O wingless wind that walk'st the sea, Weak wind, wing-broken, wearier wind than we, Who are yet not spirit-broken, maimed like thee, Who wail not in our inward night as thou In the outer darkness now, What word has the old sea given thee for mine ear From thy faint lips to hear? For some word would she send me, knowing not how. Nay, what far other word Than ever of her was spoken, or of me Or all my winged white kinsfolk of the sea Between fresh wave and wave was ever heard, Cleaves the clear dark enwinding tree with tree Too close for stars to separate and to see Enmeshed in multitudinous unity? What voice of what strong God hath stormed and stirred The fortressed rock of silence, rent apart Even to the core Night's all-maternal heart? What voice of God grown heavenlier in a bird, Made keener of edge to smite Than lightning—yea, thou knowest, O mother Night, Keen as that cry from thy strange children sent Wherewith the Athenian judgment-shrine was rent, For wrath that all their wrath was vainly spent, Their wrath for wrong made right By justice in her own divine despite That bade pass forth unblamed The sinless matricide and unashamed? Yea, what new cry is this, what note more bright Than their song's wing of words was dark of flight, What word is this thou hast heard, Thine and not thine or theirs, O Night, what word More keen than lightning and more sweet than light? As all men's hearts grew godlike in one bird And all those hearts cried on thee, crying with might, Hear us, O mother Night. Dumb is the mouth of darkness as of death: Light, sound and life are one In the eyes and lips of dawn that draw the sun To hear what first child's word with glimmering breath Their weak wan weanling child the twilight saith; But night makes answer none. God, if thou be God,—bird, if bird thou be,— Do thou then answer me. For but one word, what wind soever blow, Is blown up usward ever from the sea. In fruitless years of youth dead long ago And deep beneath their own dead leaves and snow Buried, I heard with bitter heart and sere The same sea's word unchangeable, nor knew But that mine own life-days were changeless too And sharp and salt with unshed tear on tear And cold and fierce and barren; and my soul, Sickening, swam weakly with bated breath In a deep sea like death, And felt the wind buffet her face with brine Hard, and harsh thought on thought in long bleak roll Blown by keen gusts of memory sad as thine Heap the weight up of pain, and break, and leave Strength scarce enough to grieve In the sick heavy spirit, unmanned with strife Of waves that beat at the tired lips of life. Nay, sad may be man's memory, sad may be The dream he weaves him as for shadow of thee, But scarce one breathing-space, one heartbeat long, Wilt thou take shadow of sadness on thy song. Not thou, being more than man or man's desire, Being bird and God in one, With throat of gold and spirit of the sun; The sun whom all our souls and songs call sire, Whose godhead gave thee, chosen of all our quire, Thee only of all that serve, of all that sing Before our sire and king, Borne up some space on time's world-wandering wing, This gift, this doom, to bear till time's wing tire— Life everlasting of eternal life. Thee only of all; yet can no memory say How many a night and day My heart has been as thy heart, and my life As thy life is, a sleepless hidden thing, Full of the thirst and hunger of winter and spring, That seeks its food not in such love or strife As fill men's hearts with passionate hours and rest. From no loved lips and on no loving breast Have I sought ever for such gifts as bring Comfort, to stay the secret soul with sleep. The joys, the loves, the labours, whence men reap Rathe fruit of hopes and fears, I have made not mine; the best of all my days Have been as those fair fruitless summer strays, Those water-waifs that but the sea-wind steers, Flakes of glad foam or flowers on footless ways That take the wind in season and the sun, And when the wind wills is their season done. For all my days as all thy days from birth My heart as thy heart was in me as thee, Fire; and not all the fountains of the sea Have waves enough to quench it, nor on earth Is fuel enough to feed, While day sows night and night sows day for seed. We were not marked for sorrow, thou nor I, For joy nor sorrow, sister, were we made, To take delight and grief to live and die, Assuaged by pleasures or by pains affrayed That melt men's hearts and alter; we retain A memory mastering pleasure and all pain, A spirit within the sense of ear and eye, A soul behind the soul, that seeks and sings And makes our life move only with its wings And feed but from its lips, that in return Feed of our hearts wherein the old fires that burn Have strength not to consume Nor glory enough to exalt us past our doom. Ah, ah, the doom (thou knowest whence rang that wail) Of the shrill nightingale! (From whose wild lips, thou knowest, that wail was thrown) For round about her have the great gods cast A wing-borne body, and clothed her close and fast With a sweet life that hath no part in moan. But me, for me (how hadst thou heart to hear?) Remains a sundering with the two-edged spear. Ah, for her doom! so cried in presage then The bodeful bondslave of the king of men, And might not win her will. Too close the entangling dragnet woven of crime, The snare of ill new-born of elder ill, The curse of new time for an elder time, Had caught, and held her yet, Enmeshed intolerably in the intolerant net, Who thought with craft to mock the God most high, And win by wiles his crown of prophecy From the Sun's hand sublime, As God were man, to spare or to forget. But thou,—the gods have given thee and forgiven thee More than our master gave That strange-eyed spirit-wounded strange-tongued slave There questing houndlike where the roofs red-wet Reeked as a wet red grave. Life everlasting has their strange grace given thee, Even hers whom thou wast wont to sing and serve With eyes, but not with song, too swift to swerve; Yet might not even thine eyes estranged estrange her, Who seeing thee too, but inly, burn and bleed Like that pale princess-priest of Priam's seed, For stranger service gave thee guerdon stranger; If this indeed be guerdon, this indeed Her mercy, this thy meed— That thou, being more than all we born, being higher Than all heads crowned of him that only gives The light whereby man lives, The bay that bids man moved of God's desire Lay hand on lute or lyre, Set lip to trumpet or deflowered green reed— If this were given thee for a grace indeed, That thou, being first of all these, thou alone Shouldst have the grace to die not, but to live And lose nor change one pulse of song, one tone Of all that were thy lady's and thine own, Thy lady's whom thou criedst on to forgive, Thou, priest and sacrifice on the altar-stone Where none may worship not of all that live, Love's priestess, errant on dark ways diverse; If this were grace indeed for Love to give, If this indeed were blessing and no curse. Love's priestess, mad with pain and joy of song, Song's priestess, mad with joy and pain of love, Name above all names that are lights above, We have loved, praised, pitied, crowned and done thee wrong, O thou past praise and pity; thou the sole Utterly deathless, perfect only and whole Immortal, body and soul. For over all whom time hath overpast The shadow of sleep inexorable is cast, The implacable sweet shadow of perfect sleep That gives not back what life gives death to keep; Yea, all that lived and loved and sang and sinned Are all borne down death's cold sweet soundless wind That blows all night and knows not whom its breath, Darkling, may touch to death: But one that wind hath touched and changed not,—one Whose body and soul are parcel of the sun; One that earth's fire could burn not, nor the sea Quench; nor might human doom take hold on thee; All praise, all pity, all dreams have done thee wrong, All love, with eyes love-blinded from above; Song's priestess, mad with joy and pain of love, Love's priestess, mad with pain and joy of song. Hast thou none other answer then for me Than the air may have of thee, Or the earth's warm woodlands girdling with green girth Thy secret sleepless burning life on earth, Or even the sea that once, being woman crowned And girt with fire and glory of anguish round, Thou wert so fain to seek to, fain to crave If she would hear thee and save And give thee comfort of thy great green grave? Because I have known thee always who thou art, Thou knowest, have known thee to thy heart's own heart, Nor ever have given light ear to storied song That did thy sweet name sweet unwitting wrong, Nor ever have called thee nor would call for shame, Thou knowest, but inly by thine only name, Sappho—because I have known thee and loved, hast thou None other answer now? As brother and sister were we, child and bird, Since thy first Lesbian word Flamed on me, and I knew not whence I knew This was the song that struck my whole soul through, Pierced my keen spirit of sense with edge more keen, Even when I knew not,—even ere sooth was seen,— When thou wast but the tawny sweet winged thing Whose cry was but of spring. And yet even so thine ear should hear me—yea, Hear me this nightfall by this northland bay, Even for their sake whose loud good word I had, Singing of thee in the all-beloved clime Once, where the windy wine of spring makes mad Our sisters of Majano, who kept time Clear to my choral rhyme. Yet was the song acclaimed of these aloud Whose praise had made mute humbleness misproud, The song with answering song applauded thus, But of that Daulian dream of Itylus. So but for love's love haply was it—nay, How else?—that even their song took my song's part, For love of love and sweetness of sweet heart, Or god-given glorious madness of mid May And heat of heart and hunger and thirst to sing, Full of the new wine of the wind of spring. Or if this were not, and it be not sin To hold myself in spirit of thy sweet kin, In heart and spirit of song; If this my great love do thy grace no wrong, Thy grace that gave me grace to dwell therein; If thy gods thus be my gods, and their will Made my song part of thy song—even such part As man's hath of God's heart— And my life like as thy life to fulfil; What have our gods then given us? Ah, to thee, Sister, much more, much happier than to me, Much happier things they have given, and more of grace Than falls to man's light race; For lighter are we, all our love and pain Lighter than thine, who knowest of time or place Thus much, that place nor time Can heal or hurt or lull or change again The singing soul that makes his soul sublime Who hears the far fall of its fire-fledged rhyme Fill darkness as with bright and burning rain Till all the live gloom inly glows, and light Seems with the sound to cleave the core of night. The singing soul that moves thee, and that moved When thou wast woman, and their songs divine Who mixed for Grecian mouths heaven's lyric wine Fell dumb, fell down reproved Before one sovereign Lesbian song of thine. That soul, though love and life had fain held fast, Wind-winged with fiery music, rose and past Through the indrawn hollow of earth and heaven and hell, As through some strait sea-shell The wide sea's immemorial song,—the sea That sings and breathes in strange men's ears of thee How in her barren bride-bed, void and vast, Even thy soul sang itself to sleep at last. To sleep? Ah, then, what song is this, that here Makes all the night one ear, One ear fulfilled and mad with music, one Heart kindling as the heart of heaven, to hear A song more fiery than the awakening sun Sings, when his song sets fire To the air and clouds that build the dead night's pyre? O thou of divers-coloured mind, O thou Deathless, God's daughter subtle-souled—lo, now, Now too the song above all songs, in flight Higher than the day-star's height, And sweet as sound the moving wings of night! Thou of the divers-coloured seat—behold, Her very song of old!— O deathless, O God's daughter subtle-souled! That same cry through this boskage overhead Rings round reiterated, Palpitates as the last palpitated, The last that panted through her lips and died Not down this grey north sea's half sapped cliff-side That crumbles toward the coastline, year by year More near the sands and near; The last loud lyric fiery cry she cried, Heard once on heights Leucadian,—heard not here. Not here; for this that fires our northland night, This is the song that made Love fearful, even the heart of love afraid, With the great anguish of its great delight. No swan-song, no far-fluttering half-drawn breath, No word that love of love's sweet nature saith, No dirge that lulls the narrowing lids of death, No healing hymn of peace-prevented strife,— This is her song of life. I love thee,—hark, one tenderer note than all— Atthis, of old time, once—one low long fall, Sighing—one long low lovely loveless call, Dying—one pause in song so flamelike fast— Atthis, long since in old time overpast— One soft first pause and last. One,—then the old rage of rapture's fieriest rain Storms all the music-maddened night again. Child of God, close craftswoman, I beseech thee, Bid not ache nor agony break nor master, Lady, my spirit— O thou her mistress, might her cry not reach thee? Our Lady of all men's loves, could Love go past her, Pass, and not hear it? She hears not as she heard not; hears not me, O treble-natured mystery,—how should she Hear, or give ear?—who heard and heard not thee; Heard, and went past, and heard not; but all time Hears all that all the ravin of his years Hath cast not wholly out of all men's ears And dulled to death with deep dense funeral chime Of their reiterate rhyme. And now of all songs uttering all her praise, All hers who had thy praise and did thee wrong, Abides one song yet of her lyric days, Thine only, this thy song. O soul triune, woman and god and bird, Man, man at least has heard. All ages call thee conqueror, and thy cry The mightiest as the least beneath the sky Whose heart was ever set to song, or stirred With wind of mounting music blown more high Than wildest wing may fly, Hath heard or hears,—even Æschylus as I. But when thy name was woman, and thy word Human,—then haply, surely then meseems This thy bird's note was heard on earth of none, Of none save only in dreams. In all the world then surely was but one Song; as in heaven at highest one sceptred sun Regent, on earth here surely without fail One only, one imperious nightingale. Dumb was the field, the woodland mute, the lawn Silent; the hill was tongueless as the vale Even when the last fair waif of cloud that felt Its heart beneath the colouring moonrays melt, At high midnoon of midnight half withdrawn, Bared all the sudden deep divine moondawn. Then, unsaluted by her twin-born tune, That latter timeless morning of the moon Rose past its hour of moonrise; clouds gave way To the old reconquering ray, But no song answering made it more than day; No cry of song by night Shot fire into the cloud-constraining light. One only, one Æolian island heard Thrill, but through no bird's throat, In one strange manlike maiden's godlike note, The song of all these as a single bird. Till the sea's portal was as funeral gate For that sole singer in all time's ageless date Singled and signed for so triumphal fate, All nightingales but one in all the world All her sweet life were silent; only then, When her life's wing of womanhood was furled, Their cry, this cry of thine was heard again, As of me now, of any born of men. Through sleepless clear spring nights filled full of thee, Rekindled here, thy ruling song has thrilled The deep dark air and subtle tender sea And breathless hearts with one bright sound fulfilled. Or at midnoon to me Swimming, and birds about my happier head Skimming, one smooth soft way by water and air, To these my bright born brethren and to me Hath not the clear wind borne or seemed to bear A song wherein all earth and heaven and sea Were molten in one music made of thee To enforce us, O our sister of the shore, Look once in heart back landward and adore? For songless were we sea-mews, yet had we More joy than all things joyful of thee—more, Haply, than all things happiest; nay, save thee, In thy strong rapture of imperious joy Too high for heart of sea-borne bird or boy, What living things were happiest if not we? But knowing not love nor change nor wrath nor wrong, No more we knew of song. Song, and the secrets of it, and their might, What blessings curse it and what curses bless, I know them since my spirit had first in sight, Clear as thy song's words or the live sun's light, The small dark body's Lesbian loveliness That held the fire eternal; eye and ear Were as a god's to see, a god's to hear, Through all his hours of daily and nightly chime, The sundering of the two-edged spear of time: The spear that pierces even the sevenfold shields Of mightiest Memory, mother of all songs made, And wastes all songs as roseleaves kissed and frayed As here the harvest of the foam-flowered fields; But thine the spear may waste not that he wields Since first the God whose soul is man's live breath, The sun whose face hath our sun's face for shade, Put all the light of life and love and death Too strong for life, but not for love too strong, Where pain makes peace with pleasure in thy song, And in thine heart, where love and song make strife, Fire everlasting of eternal life. THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE Sea, and bright wind, and heaven of ardent air, More dear than all things earth-born; O to me Mother more dear than love's own longing, sea, More than love's eyes are, fair, Be with my spirit of song as wings to bear, As fire to feel and breathe and brighten; be A spirit of sense more deep of deity, A light of love, if love may be, more strong In me than very song. For song I have loved with second love, but thee, Thee first, thee, mother; ere my songs had breath, That love of loves, whose bondage makes man free, Was in me strong as death. And seeing no slave may love thee, no, not one That loves not freedom more, And more for thy sake loves her, and for hers Thee; or that hates not, on whate'er thy shore Or what thy wave soever, all things done Of man beneath the sun In his despite and thine, to cross and curse Your light and song that as with lamp and verse Guide safe the strength of our sphered universe, Thy breath it was, thou knowest, and none but thine, That taught me love of one thing more divine. [Str. 1. Ah, yet my youth was old Its first years dead and cold As last year's autumn's gold, And all my spirit of singing sick and sad and sere, Or ever I might behold The fairest of thy fold Engirt, enringed, enrolled, In all thy flower-sweet flock of islands dear and near. [Str. 2. Yet in my heart I deemed The fairest things, meseemed, Truth, dreaming, ever dreamed, Had made mine eyes already like a god's to see: Of all sea-things that were Clothed on with water and air, That none could live more fair Than thy sweet love long since had shown for love to me. [Ant. 1 I knew not, mother of mine, That one birth more divine Than all births else of thine That hang like flowers or jewels on thy deep soft breast Was left for me to shine Above thy girdling line Of bright and breathing brine, To take mine eyes with rapture and my sense with rest. [Ant. 2. That this was left for me, Mother, to have of thee, To touch, to taste, to see, To feel as fire fulfilling all my blood and breath, As wine of living fire Keen as the heart's desire That makes the heart its pyre And on its burning visions burns itself to death. For here of all thy waters, here of all Thy windy ways the wildest, and beset As some beleaguered city's war-breached wall With deaths enmeshed all round it in deep net, Thick sown with rocks deadlier than steel, and fierce With loud cross-countering currents, where the ship Flags, flickering like a wind-bewildered leaf, The densest weft of waves that prow may pierce Coils round the sharpest warp of shoals that dip Suddenly, scarce well under for one brief Keen breathing-space between the streams adverse, Scarce showing the fanged edge of one hungering lip Or one tooth lipless of the ravening reef; And midmost of the murderous water's web All round it stretched and spun, Laughs, reckless of rough tide and raging ebb, The loveliest thing that shines against the sun. [Str. 3. O flower of all wind-flowers and sea-flowers, Made lovelier by love of the sea Than thy golden own field-flowers, or tree-flowers Like foam of the sea-facing tree! No foot but the seamew's there settles On the spikes of thine anthers like horns, With snow-coloured spray for thy petals, Black rocks for thy thorns. [Ant. 3. Was it here, in the waste of his waters, That the lordly north wind, when his love On the fairest of many king's daughters Bore down for a spoil from above, Chose forth of all farthest far islands As a haven to harbour her head, Of all lowlands on earth and all highlands, His bride-worthy bed? [Str. 4. Or haply, my sea-flower, he found thee Made fast as with anchors to land, And broke, that his waves might be round thee, Thy fetters like rivets of sand? And afar by the blast of him drifted Thy blossom of beauty was borne, As a lark by the heart in her lifted To mix with the morn? [Ant. 4. By what rapture of rage, by what vision Of a heavenlier heaven than above, Was he moved to devise thy division From the land as a rest for his love? As a nest when his wings would remeasure The ways where of old they would be, As a bride-bed upbuilt for his pleasure By sea-rock and sea? For in no deeps of midmost inland May More flowerbright flowers the hawthorn, or more sweet Swells the wild gold of the earth for wandering feet; For on no northland way Crowds the close whin-bloom closer, set like thee With thorns about for fangs of sea-rock shown Through blithe lips of the bitter brine to lee; Nor blithelier landward comes the sea-wind blown, Nor blithelier leaps the land-wind back to sea: Nor louder springs the living song of birds To shame our sweetest words. And in the narrowest of thine hollowest hold For joy thine aspens quiver as though for cold, And many a self-lit flower-illumined tree Outlaughs with snowbright or with rosebright glee The laughter of the fields whose laugh is gold. Yea, even from depth to height, Even thine own beauty with its own delight Fulfils thine heart in thee an hundredfold Beyond the larger hearts of islands bright With less intense contraction of desire Self-satiate, centred in its own deep fire; Of shores not self-enchanted and entranced By heavenly severance from all shadow of mirth Or mourning upon earth: As thou, by no similitude enhanced, By no fair foil made fairer, but alone Fair as could be no beauty save thine own, And wondrous as no world-beholden wonder: Throned, with the world's most perilous sea for throne, And praised from all its choral throats of thunder. [Str. 5. Yet one praise hast thou, holier Than praise of theirs may be, To exalt thee, wert thou lowlier Than all that take the sea With shores whence waves ebb slowlier Than these fall off from thee: [Ant. 5. That One, whose name gives glory, One man whose life makes light, One crowned and throned in story Above all empire's height, Came, where thy straits run hoary, To hold thee fast in sight; [Str. 6. With hallowing eyes to hold thee, With rapturous heart to read, To encompass and enfold thee With love whence all men feed, To brighten and behold thee, Who is mightiest of man's seed: [Ant. 6. More strong than strong disaster, For fate and fear too strong; Earth's friend, whose eyes look past her, Whose hands would purge of wrong; Our lord, our light, our master, Whose word sums up all song. [Str. 7. Be it April or September That plays his perfect part, Burn June or blow December, Thou canst not in thine heart But rapturously remember, All heavenlike as thou art, [Ant. 7. Whose footfall made thee fairer, Whose passage more divine, Whose hand, our thunder-bearer, Held fire that bade thee shine With subtler glory and rarer Than thrills the sun's own shrine. Who knows how then his godlike banished gaze Turned haply from its goal of natural days And homeward hunger for the clear French clime, Toward English earth, whereunder now the Accursed Rots, in the hate of all men's hearts inhearsed, A carrion ranker to the sense of time For that sepulchral gift of stone and lime By royal grace laid on it, less of weight Than the load laid by fate, Fate, misbegotten child of his own crime, Son of as foul a bastard-bearing birth As even his own on earth; Less heavy than the load of cursing piled By loyal grace of all souls undefiled On one man's head, whose reeking soul made rotten The loathed live corpse on earth once misbegotten? But when our Master's homeless feet were here France yet was foul with joy more foul than fear, And slavery chosen, more vile by choice of chance Than dull damnation of inheritance From Russian year to year Alas fair mother of men, alas my France, What ailed thee so to fall, that wert so dear For all men's sake to all men, in such trance, Plague-stricken? Had the very Gods, that saw Thy glory lighten on us for a law, Thy gospel go before us for a guide, Had these waxed envious of our love and awe, Or was it less their envy than thy pride That bared thy breast for the obscene vulture-claw, High priestess, by whose mouth Love prophesied That fate should yet mean freedom? Howsoever, That hour, the helper of men's hearts, we praise, Which blots out of man's book of after days The name above all names abhorred for ever. And His name shall we praise not, whom these flowers, These rocks and ravening waters bound for girth Round this wild starry spanlong plot of earth, Beheld, the mightier for those heavier hours That bowed his heart not down Nor marred one crowning blossom of his crown? For surely, might we say, Even from the dark deep sea-gate that makes way Through channelled darkness for the darkling day Hardly to let men's faltering footfall win The sunless passage in, Where breaks a world aflower against the sun, A small sweet world of wave-encompassed wonder Kept from the wearier landward world asunder With violence of wild waters, and with thunder Of many winds as one, To where the keen sea-current grinds and frets The black bright sheer twin flameless Altarlets That lack no live blood-sacrifice they crave Of shipwreck and the shrine-subservient wave, Having for priest the storm-wind, and for choir Lightnings and clouds whose prayer and praise are fire, All the isle acclaimed him coming; she, the least Of all things loveliest that the sea's love hides From strange men's insult, walled about with tides That bid strange guests back from her flower-strewn feast, Set all her fields aflower, her flowers aflame, To applaud him that he came. Nor surely flashed not something of delight Through that steep strait of rock whose twin-cliffed height Links crag with crag reiterate, land with land, By one sheer thread of narrowing precipice Bifront, that binds and sunders Abyss from hollower imminent abyss And wilder isle with island, blind for bliss Of sea that lightens and of wind that thunders; Nor pealed not surely back from deep to steep Reverberate acclamation, steep to deep Inveterately reclaiming and replying Praise, and response applausive; nor the sea, For all the sea-wind's crying, Knew not the song her sister, even as she Thundering, or like her confluent spring-tides brightening, And like her darkness lightening; The song that moved about him silent, now Both soundless wings refolded and refurled On that Promethean brow, Then quivering as for flight that wakes the world. [Str. 8. From the roots of the rocks underlying the gulfs that engird it around Was the isle not enkindled with light of him landing, or thrilled not with sound? Yea, surely the sea like a harper laid hand on the shore as a lyre, As the lyre in his own for a birthright of old that was given of his sire, And the hand of the child was put forth on the chords yet alive and aflame From the hand of the God that had wrought it in heaven; and the hand was the same. And the tongue of the child spake, singing; and never a note that he sang, But the strings made answer unstricken, as though for the God they rang. And the eyes of the child shone, lightening; and touched as by life at his nod, They shuddered with music, and quickened as though from the glance of the God. So trembled the heart of the hills and the rocks to receive him, and yearned With desirous delight of his presence and love that beholding him burned. Yea, down through the mighty twin hollows where never the sunlight shall be, Deep sunk under imminent earth, and subdued to the stress of the sea, That feel when the dim week changes by change of their tides in the dark, As the wave sinks under within them, reluctant, removed from its mark, Even there in the terror of twilight in bloom with its blossoms ablush, Did a sense of him touch not the gleam of their flowers with a fierier flush? Though the sun they behold not for ever, yet knew they not over them One Whose soul was the soul of the morning, whose song was the song of the sun? But the secrets inviolate of sunlight in hollows untrodden of day, Shall he dream what are these who beholds not? or he that hath seen, shall he say? For the path is for passage of sea-mews; and he that hath glided and leapt Over sea-grass and sea-rock, alighting as one from a citadel crept That his foemen beleaguer, descending by darkness and stealth, at the last Peers under, and all is as hollow to hellward, agape and aghast. [Ant. 8. But afloat and afar in the darkness a tremulous colour subsides From the crimson high crest of the purple-peaked roof to the soft-coloured sides That brighten as ever they widen till downward the level is won Of the soundless and colourless water that knows not the sense of the sun: From the crown of the culminant arch to the floor of the lakelet abloom, One infinite blossom of blossoms innumerable aflush through the gloom. All under the deeps of the darkness are glimmering; all over impends An immeasurable infinite flower of the dark that dilates and descends, That exults and expands in its breathless and blind efflorescence of heart As it broadens and bows to the wave-ward, and breathes not, and hearkens apart. As a beaker inverse at a feast on Olympus, exhausted of wine, But inlaid as with rose from the lips of Dione that left it divine: From the lips everliving of laughter and love everlasting, that leave In the cleft of his heart who shall kiss them a snake to corrode it and cleave. So glimmers the gloom into glory, the glory recoils into gloom, That the eye of the sun could not kindle, the lip not of Love could relume. So darkens reverted the cup that the kiss of her mouth set on fire: So blackens a brand in his eyeshot asmoulder awhile from the pyre. For the beam from beneath and without it refrangent again from the wave Strikes up through the portal a ghostly reverse on the dome of the cave, On the depth of the dome ever darkling and dim to the crown of its arc: That the sun-coloured tapestry, sunless for ever, may soften the dark. But within through the side-seen archway a glimmer again from the right Is the seal of the sea's tide set on the mouth of the mystery of night. And the seal on the seventh day breaks but a little, that man by its mean May behold what the sun hath not looked on, the stars of the night have not seen. Even like that hollow-bosomed rose, inverse And infinite, the heaven of thy vast verse, Our Master, over all our souls impends, Imminent; we, with heart-enkindled eyes Upwondering, search the music-moulded skies Sphere by sweet sphere, concordant as it blends Light of bright sound, sound of clear light, in one, As all the stars found utterance through the sun. And all that heaven is like a rose in bloom, Flower-coloured, where its own sun's fires illume As from one central and imperious heart The whole sky's every part: But lightening still and darkling downward, lo The light and darkness of it, The leaping of the lamping levin afar Between the full moon and the sunset star, The war-song of the sounding skies aglow, That have the herald thunder for their prophet: From north to south the lyric lights that leap, The tragic sundawns reddening east and west As with bright blood from one Promethean breast, The peace of noon that strikes the sea to sleep, The wail over the world of all that weep, The peace of night when death brings life on rest. Goddess who gatherest all the herded waves Into thy great sweet pastureless green fold, Even for our love of old, I pray thee by thy power that slays and saves, Take thou my song of this thy flower to keep Who hast my heart in hold; And from thine high place of thy garden-steep, Where one sheer terrace oversees thy deep From the utmost rock-reared height Down even to thy dear depths of night and light, Take my song's salutation; and on me Breathe back the benediction of thy sea. [Between two seas the sea-bird's wing makes halt] Between two seas the sea-bird's wing makes halt, Wind-weary; while with lifting head he waits For breath to reinspire him from the gates That open still toward sunrise on the vault High-domed of morning, and in flight's default With spreading sense of spirit anticipates What new sea now may lure beyond the straits His wings exulting that her winds exalt And fill them full as sails to seaward spread, Fulfilled with fair speed's promise. Pass, my song, Forth to the haven of thy desire and dread, The presence of our lord, long loved and long Far off above beholden, who to thee Was as light kindling all a windy sea. BIRTHDAY ODE FOR THE ANNIVERSARY FESTIVAL OF VICTOR HUGO, FEBRUARY 26, 1880 [Strophe 1. Spring, born in heaven ere many a springtime flown, Dead spring that sawest on earth A babe of deathless birth, A flower of rosier flowerage than thine own, A glory of goodlier godhead; even this day, That floods the mist of February with May, And strikes death dead with sunlight, and the breath Whereby the deadly doers are done to death, They that in day's despite Would crown the imperial night, And in deep hate of insubmissive spring Rethrone the royal winter for a king, This day that casts the days of darkness down Low as a broken crown, We call thee from the gulf of deeds and days, Deathless and dead, to hear us whom we praise. [Antistrophe 1. A light of many lights about thine head, Lights manifold and one, Stars molten in a sun, A sun of divers beams incorporated, Compact of confluent aureoles, each more fair Than man, save only at highest of man, may wear, So didst thou rise, when this our grey-grown age Had trod two paces of his pilgrimage, Two paces through the gloom From his fierce father's tomb, Led by cross lights of lightnings, and the flame That burned in darkness round one darkling name; So didst thou rise, nor knewest thy glory, O thou Re-risen upon us now, The glory given thee for a grace to give, And take the praise of all men's hearts that live. [Epode 1. First in the dewy ray Odes et Ballades, 1822–1824. Ere dawn be slain of day The fresh crowned lilies of discrowned kings' prime Sprang splendid as of old With moonlight-coloured gold And rays refract from the oldworld heaven of time; Pale with proud light of stars decreased In westward wane reluctant from the conquering east. [Str. 2. But even between their golden olden bloom Strange flowers of wildwood glory, With frost and moonshine hoary, Thrust up the new growths of their green-leaved gloom, Red buds of ballad blossom, where the dew Blushed as with bloodlike passion, and its hue Was as the life and love of hearts on flame, And fire from forth of each live chalice came: Young sprays of elder song, Stem straight and petal strong, Bright foliage with dark frondage overlaid, And light the lovelier for its lordlier shade; And morn and even made loud in woodland lone With cheer of clarions blown, And through the tournay's clash and clarion's cheer Laugh to laugh echoing, tear washed off by tear. [Ant. 2. Then eastward far past northland lea and lawn Les Orientales, 1829. Beneath a heavier light Of stormier day and night Began the music of the heaven of dawn; Bright sound of battle along the Grecian waves, Loud light of thunder above the Median graves, New strife, new song on Æschylean seas, Canaris risen above Themistocles; Old glory of warrior ghosts Shed fresh on filial hosts, With dewfall redder than the dews of day, And earth-born lightnings out of bloodbright spray; Then through the flushed grey gloom on shadowy sheaves Les Feuilles d'Automne, 1831. Low flights of falling leaves; And choirs of birds transfiguring as they throng Les Chants du Crépuscule, 1835. All the world's twilight and the soul's to song. [Ep. 2. Voices more dimly deep Les Voix Intérieures, 1837. Than the inmost heart of sleep, And tenderer than the rose-mouthed morning's lips; And midmost of them heard The viewless water's word, The sea's breath in the wind's wing and the ship's, That bids one swell and sound and smite And rend that other in sunder as with fangs by night. [Str. 3. But ah! the glory of shadow and mingling ray, Les Rayons et les Ombres, 1840. The story of morn and even Whose tale was writ in heaven And had for scroll the night, for scribe the day! For scribe the prophet of the morning, far Exalted over twilight and her star; For scroll beneath his Apollonian hand The dim twin wastes of sea and glimmering land. Hark, on the hill-wind, clear For all men's hearts to hear Sound like a stream at nightfall from the steep That all time's depths might answer, deep to deep, With trumpet-measures of triumphal wail From windy vale to vale, The crying of one for love that strayed and sinned Whose brain took madness of the mountain wind. [Ant. 3. Between the birds of brighter and duskier wing, What mightier-moulded forms Girt with red clouds and storms Mix their strong hearts with theirs that soar and sing? Before the storm-blast blown of death's dark horn Hernani, 1830. The marriage moonlight withers, that the morn For two made one may find three made by death One ruin at the blasting of its breath: Clothed with heart's flame renewed Marion de Lorme, 1831. And strange new maidenhood, Faith lightens on the lips that bloomed for hire Pure as the lightning of love's first-born fire: Wide-eyed and patient ever, till the curse Le Roi s'amuse, 1832. Find where to fall and pierce, Keen expiation whets with edge more dread A father's wrong to smite a father's head. [Ep. 3. Borgia, supreme from birth Lucrèce Borgia, 1833. As loveliest born on earth Since earth bore ever women that were fair; Scarce known of her own house If daughter or sister or spouse; Who holds men's hearts yet helpless with her hair; The direst of divine things made, Bows down her amorous aureole half suffused with shade. [Str. 4. As red the fire-scathed royal northland bloom, Marie Tudor, 1835. That left our story a name Dyed through with blood and flame Ere her life shrivelled from a fierier doom Than theirs her priests bade pass from earth in fire To slake the thirst of God their Lord's desire: As keen the blast of love-enkindled fate Angelo, Tyran de Padoue, 1835. That burst the Paduan tyrant's guarded gate: As sad the softer moan La Esmeralda, 1836. Made one with music's own For one whose feet made music as they fell On ways by loveless love made hot from hell: But higher than these and all the song thereof Ruy Blas, 1838. The perfect heart of love, The heart by fraud and hate once crucified, That, dying, gave thanks, and in thanksgiving died. [Ant. 4. Above the windy walls that rule the Rhine Les Burgraves, 1842. A noise of eagles' wings And wintry war-time rings, With roar of ravage trampling corn and vine And storm of wrathful wassail dashed with song, And under these the watch of wreakless wrong, With fire of eyes anhungered; and above These, the light of the stricken eyes of love, The faint sweet eyes that follow The wind-outwinging swallow, And face athirst with young wan yearning mouth Turned after toward the unseen all-golden south, Hopeless to see the birds back ere life wane, Or the leaves born again; And still the might and music mastering fate Of life more strong than death and love than hate. [Ep. 4. In spectral strength biform Cromwell, 1827: Étude sur Mirabeau, 1834 (Littérature et Philosophie mêlées, 1819–1834). Stand the twin sons of storm Transfigured by transmission of one hand That gives the new-born time Their semblance more sublime Than once it lightened over each man's land; There Freedom's winged and wide-mouthed hound, And here our high Dictator, in his son discrowned. [Str. 5. What strong-limbed shapes of kindred throng round these Before, between, behind, Sons born of one man's mind, Fed at his hands and fostered round his knees? Fear takes the spirit in thraldom at his nod, And pity makes it as the spirit of God, As his own soul that from her throne above Sheds on all souls of men her showers of love, On all earth's evil and pain Pours mercy forth as rain And comfort as the dewfall on dry land; And feeds with pity from a faultless hand All by their own fault stricken, all cast out By all men's scorn or doubt, Or with their own hands wounded, or by fate Brought into bondage of men's fear or hate. [Ant. 5. In violence of strange visions north and south Han d' Islande, 1823. Bug-Jargal, 1826. Confronted, east and west, With frozen or fiery breast, Eyes fixed or fevered, pale or bloodred mouth, Kept watch about his dawn-enkindled dreams; But ere high noon a light of nearer beams Le Dernier Jour d'un Condamné, 1829: Claude Gueux, 1834. Made his young heaven of manhood more benign, And love made soft his lips with spiritual wine, And left them fired, and fed With sacramental bread, And sweet with honey of tenderer words than tears To feed men's hopes and fortify men's fears, And strong to silence with benignant breath The lips that doom to death, And swift with speech like fire in fiery lands To melt the steel's edge in the headsman's hands. [Ep. 5. Higher than they rose of old, Notre-Dame de Paris, 1831. New builded now, behold, The live great likeness of Our Lady's towers; And round them like a dove Wounded, and sick with love, One fair ghost moving, crowned with fateful flowers, Watched yet with eyes of bloodred lust And eyes of love's heart broken and unbroken trust. [Str. 6. But sadder always under shadowier skies, More pale and sad and clear Waxed always, drawn more near, The face of Duty lit with Love's own eyes; Till the awful hands that culled in rosier hours Le Rhin, 1845. From fairy-footed fields of wild old flowers And sorcerous woods of Rhineland, green and hoary, Young children's chaplets of enchanted story, The great kind hands that showed Exile its homeward road, And, as man's helper made his foeman God, Of pity and mercy wrought themselves a rod, And opened for Napoleon's wandering kin France, and bade enter in, And threw for all the doors of refuge wide, Took to them lightning in the thunder-tide. Napoléon le Petit, 1852. Châtiments, 1853. Histoire d'un Crime, 1877. In this place I must take occasion to relieve my conscience from a sense of duty unfulfilled so long as I for one have not uttered my own poor private protest—worthless and weightless though it may seem, if cast as a grain into the scale of public opinion—against a projected insult at once to contemporary France and to the present only less than to past generations of Englishmen. [Ant. 6. For storm on earth above had risen from under, Out of the hollow of hell, Such storm as never fell From darkest deeps of heaven distract with thunder; A cloud of cursing, past all shape of thought, More foul than foulest dreams, and overfraught With all obscene things and obscure of birth That ever made infection of man's earth; Having all hell for cloak Wrapped round it as a smoke And in its womb such offspring so defiled As earth bare never for her loathliest child, Rose, brooded, reddened, broke, and with its breath Put France to poisonous death; Yea, far as heaven's red labouring eye could glance, France was not, save in men cast forth of France. [Ep. 6. Then,—while the plague-sore grew Two darkling decades through, And rankled in the festering flesh of time,— Where darkness binds and frees The wildest of wild seas In fierce mutations of the unslumbering clime, There, sleepless too, o'er shuddering wrong One hand appointed shook the reddening scourge of song. [Str. 7. And through the lightnings of the apparent word Dividing shame's dense night Sounds lovelier than the light And light more sweet than song from night's own bird Mixed each their hearts with other, till the gloom Was glorious as with all the stars in bloom, Sonorous as with all the spheres in chime Heard far through flowering heaven: the sea, sublime Once only with its own Old winds' and waters' tone, Sad only or glad with its own glory, and crowned With its own light, and thrilled with its own sound, Learnt now their song, more sweet than heaven's may be, Who pass away by sea; The song that takes of old love's land farewell, With pulse of plangent water like a knell. [Ant. 7. And louder ever and louder and yet more loud Till night be shamed of morn Rings the Black Huntsman's horn Through darkening deeps beneath the covering cloud, Till all the wild beasts of the darkness hear; Till the Czar quake, till Austria cower for fear, Till the king breathe not, till the priest wax pale, Till spies and slayers on seats of judgment quail, Till mitre and cowl bow down And crumble as a crown, Till Cæsar driven to lair and hounded Pope Reel breathless and drop heartless out of hope, And one the uncleanest kinless beast of all Lower than his fortune fall; The wolfish waif of casual empire, born To turn all hate and horror cold with scorn. [Ep. 7. Yea, even at night's full noon Light's birth-song brake in tune, Spake, witnessing that with us one must be, God; naming so by name That priests have brought to shame The strength whose scourge sounds on the smitten sea; The mystery manifold of might Which bids the wind give back to night the things of night. [Str. 8. Even God, the unknown of all time; force or thought, Nature or fate or will, Clothed round with good and ill, Veiled and revealed of all things and of nought, Hooded and helmed with mystery, girt and shod With light and darkness, unapparent God. Him the high prophet o'er his wild work bent Found indivisible ever and immanent At hidden heart of truth, In forms of age and youth Transformed and transient ever; masked and crowned, From all bonds loosened and with all bonds bound, Diverse and one with all things; love and hate, Earth, and the starry state Of heaven immeasurable, and years that flee As clouds and winds and rays across the sea. [Ant. 8. But higher than stars and deeper than the waves Of day and night and morrow That roll for all time, sorrow Keeps ageless watch over perpetual graves. From dawn to morning of the soul in flower, Through toils and dreams and visions, to that hour When all the deeps were opened, and one doom Took two sweet lives to embrace them and entomb, The strong song plies its wing That makes the darkness ring And the deep light reverberate sound as deep; Song soft as flowers or grass more soft than sleep, Song bright as heaven above the mounting bird, Song like a God's tears heard Falling, fulfilled of life and death and light, And all the stars and all the shadow of night. [Ep. 8. Till, when its flight hath past Time's loftiest mark and last, The goal where good kills evil with a kiss, And Darkness in God's sight Grows as his brother Light, And heaven and hell one heart whence all the abyss Throbs with love's music; from his trance Love waking leads it home to her who stayed in France. [Str. 9. But now from all the world-old winds of the air One blast of record rings As from time's hidden springs With roar of rushing wings and fires that bear Toward north and south sonorous, east and west, Forth of the dark wherein its records rest, The story told of the ages, writ nor sung By man's hand ever nor by mortal tongue Till, godlike with desire, One tongue of man took fire, One hand laid hold upon the lightning, one Rose up to bear time witness what the sun Had seen, and what the moon and stars of night Beholding lost not light: From dawn to dusk what ways man wandering trod Even through the twilight of the gods to God. [Ant. 9. From dawn of man and woman twain and one When the earliest dews impearled The front of all the world Ringed with aurorean aureole of the sun, To days that saw Christ's tears and hallowing breath Put life for love's sake in the lips of death, And years as waves whose brine was fire, whose foam Blood, and the ravage of Neronian Rome; And the eastern crescent's horn Mightier awhile than morn; And knights whose lives were flights of eagles' wings, And lives like snakes' lives of engendering kings; And all the ravin of all the swords that reap Lives cast as sheaves on heap From all the billowing harvest-fields of fight; And sounds of love-songs lovelier than the light. [Ep. 9. The grim dim thrones of the east Set for death's riotous feast Round the bright board where darkling centuries wait, And servile slaughter, mute, Feeds power with fresh red fruit, Glitter and groan with mortal food of fate; And throne and cup and lamp's bright breath Bear witness to their lord of only night and death. [Str. 10. Dead freedom by live empire lies defiled, And murder at his feet Plies lust with wine and meat, With offering of an old man and a child, With holy body and blood, inexpiable Communion in the sacrament of hell, Till, reeking from their monstrous eucharist, The lips wax cold that murdered where they kissed, And empire in mid feast Fall as a slaughtered beast Headless, and ease men's hungering hearts of fear Lest God were none in heaven, to see nor hear, And purge his own pollution with the flood Poured of his black base blood So first found healing, poisonous as it poured; And on the clouds the archangel cleanse his sword. [Ant. 10. As at the word unutterable that made Of day and night division, From vision on to vision, From dream to dream, from darkness into shade, From sunshine into sunlight, moves and lives The steersman's eye, the helming hand that gives Life to the wheels and wings that whirl along The immeasurable impulse of the sphere of song Through all the eternal years, Beyond all stars and spheres, Beyond the washing of the waves of time, Beyond all heights where no thought else may climb, Beyond the darkling dust of suns that were, Past height and depth of air; And in the abyss whence all things move that are Finds only living Love, the sovereign star. [Ep. 10. Nor less the weight and worth Found even of love on earth To wash all stain of tears and sins away, On dying lips alit That living knew not it, In the winged shape of song with death to play: To warm young children with its wings, And try with fire the heart elect for godlike things. [Str. 11. For all worst wants of all most miserable With divine hands to deal All balms and herbs that heal, Among all woes whereunder poor men dwell Our Master sent his servant Love, to be On earth his witness; but the strange deep sea, Mother of life and death inextricate, What work should Love do there, to war with fate? Yet there must Love too keep At heart of the eyeless deep Watch, and wage war wide-eyed with all its wonders, Lower than the lightnings of its waves, and thunders Of seas less monstrous than the births they bred; Keep high there heart and head, And conquer: then for prize of all toils past Feel the sea close them in again at last. [Ant. 11. A day of direr doom arisen thereafter With cloud and fire in strife Lightens and darkens life Round one by man's hand masked with living laughter, A man by men bemonstered, but by love, Watched with blind eyes as of a wakeful dove, And wooed by lust, that in her rosy den As fire on flesh feeds on the souls of men, To take the intense impure Burnt-offering of her lure, Divine and dark and bright and naked, strange With ravenous thirst of life reversed and change, As though the very heaven should shrivel and swell With hunger after hell, Run mad for dear damnation, and desire To feel its light thrilled through with stings of fire. [Ep. 11. Above a windier sea, The glory of Ninety-three Fills heaven with blood-red and with rose-red beams That earth beholding grows Herself one burning rose Flagrant and fragrant with strange deeds and dreams, Dreams dyed as love's own flower, and deeds Stained as with love's own life-blood, that for love's sake bleeds. [Str. 12. And deeper than all deeps of seas and skies Wherein the shadows are Called sun and moon and star That rapt conjecture metes with mounting eyes, Loud with strange waves and lustrous with new spheres, Shines, masked at once and manifest of years, Shakespeare, a heaven of heavenly eyes beholden; And forward years as backward years grow golden With light of deeds and words And flight of God's fleet birds, Angels of wrath and love and truth and pity; And higher on exiled eyes their natural city Dawns down the depths of vision, more sublime Than all truths born of time; And eyes that wept above two dear sons dead Grow saving stars to guard one hopeless head. [Ant. 12. Bright round the brows of banished age had shone In vision flushed with truth The rosy glory of youth On streets and woodlands where in days long gone Sweet love sang light and loud and deep and dear: And far the trumpets of the dreadful year Had pealed and wailed in darkness: last arose The song of children, kindling as a rose At breath of sunrise, born Of the red flower of morn Whose face perfumes deep heaven with odorous light And thrills all through the wings of souls in flight Close as the press of children at His knee Whom if the high priest see, Dreaming, as homeless on dark earth he trod, The lips that praise him shall not know for God. [Ep. 12. O sovereign spirit, above All offering but man's love, All praise and prayer and incense undefiled! The one thing stronger found Than towers with iron bound; The one thing lovelier than a little child, And deeper than the seas are deep, And tenderer than such tears of love as angels weep. [Str. 13. Dante, the seer of all things evil and good, Beheld two ladies, Beauty And high life-hallowing Duty, That strove for sway upon his mind and mood And held him in alternating accord Fast bound at feet of either: but our lord, The seer and singer of righteousness and wrong Who stands now master of all the keys of song, Sees both as dewdrops run Together in the sun, For him not twain but one thing twice divine; Even as his speech and song are bread and wine For all souls hungering and all hearts athirst At best of days and worst, And both one sacrament of Love's great giving To feed the spirit and sense of all souls living. [Ant. 13. The seventh day in the wind's month, ten years gone Since heaven-espousing earth Gave the Republic birth, The mightiest soul put mortal raiment on That came forth singing ever in man's ears Of all souls with us, and through all these years Rings yet the lordliest, waxen yet more strong, That on our souls hath shed itself in song, Poured forth itself like rain On souls like springing grain That with its procreant beams and showers were fed For living wine and sacramental bread; Given all itself as air gives life and light, Utterly, as of right; The goodliest gift our age hath given, to be Ours, while the sun gives glory to the sea. [Ep. 13. Our Father and Master and Lord, Who hast thy song for sword, For staff thy spirit, and our hearts for throne: As in past years of wrong, Take now my subject song, To no crowned head made humble but thine own; That on thy day of worldly birth Gives thanks for all thou hast given past thanks of all on earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME IV TRISTRAM OF LYONESSE. THE TALE OF BALEN. ATALANTA IN CALYDON. ERECHTHEUS TRISTRAM OF LYONESSE TO MY BEST FRIEND THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON Spring speaks again, and all our woods are stirred, And all our wide glad wastes aflower around, That twice have heard keen April's clarion sound Since here we first together saw and heard Spring's light reverberate and reiterate word Shine forth and speak in season. Life stands crowned Here with the best one thing it ever found, As of my soul's best birthdays dawns the third. There is a friend that as the wise man saith Cleaves closer than a brother: nor to me Hath time not shown, through days like waves at strife, This truth more sure than all things else but death, This pearl most perfect found in all the sea That washes toward your feet these waifs of life. The Pines: April 1882 TRISTRAM AND ISEULT PRELUDE Love, that is first and last of all things made, The light that has the living world for shade, The spirit that for temporal veil has on The souls of all men woven in unison, One fiery raiment with all lives inwrought And lights of sunny and starry deed and thought, And alway through new act and passion new Shines the divine same body and beauty through, The body spiritual of fire and light That is to worldly noon as noon to night; Love, that is flesh upon the spirit of man And spirit within the flesh whence breath began; Love, that keeps all the choir of lives in chime; Love, that is blood within the veins of time; That wrought the whole world without stroke of hand, Shaping the breadth of sea, the length of land, And with the pulse and motion of his breath Through the great heart of the earth strikes life and death, The sweet twain chords that make the sweet tune live Through day and night of things alternative, Through silence and through sound of stress and strife, And ebb and flow of dying death and life; Love, that sounds loud or light in all men's ears, Whence all men's eyes take fire from sparks of tears, That binds on all men's feet or chains or wings; Love, that is root and fruit of terrene things; Love, that the whole world's waters shall not drown, The whole world's fiery forces not burn down; Love, that what time his own hands guard his head The whole world's wrath and strength shall not strike dead; Love, that if once his own hands make his grave The whole world's pity and sorrow shall not save; Love, that for very life shall not be sold, Nor bought nor bound with iron nor with gold; So strong that heaven, could love bid heaven farewell, Would turn to fruitless and unflowering hell; So sweet that hell, to hell could love be given, Would turn to splendid and sonorous heaven; Love that is fire within thee and light above, And lives by grace of nothing but of love; Through many and lovely thoughts and much desire Led these twain to the life of tears and fire; Through many and lovely days and much delight Led these twain to the lifeless life of night. Yea, but what then? albeit all this were thus, And soul smote soul and left it ruinous, And love led love as eyeless men lead men, Through chance by chance to deathward—Ah, what then? Hath love not likewise led them further yet, Out through the years where memories rise and set, Some large as suns, some moon-like warm and pale, Some starry-sighted, some through clouds that sail Seen as red flame through spectral float of fume, Each with the blush of its own special bloom On the fair face of its own coloured light, Distinguishable in all the host of night, Divisible from all the radiant rest And separable in splendour? Hath the best Light of love's all, of all that burn and move, A better heaven than heaven is? Hath not love Made for all these their sweet particular air To shine in, their own beams and names to bear, Their ways to wander and their wards to keep, Till story and song and glory and all things sleep? Hath he not plucked from death of lovers dead Their musical soft memories, and kept red The rose of their remembrance in men's eyes, The sunsets of their stories in his skies, The blush of their dead blood in lips that speak Of their dead lives, and in the listener's cheek That trembles with the kindling pity lit In gracious hearts for some sweet fever-fit, A fiery pity enkindled of pure thought By tales that make their honey out of nought, The faithless faith that lives without belief Its light life through, the griefless ghost of grief? Yea, as warm night refashions the sere blood In storm-struck petal or in sun-struck bud, With tender hours and tempering dew to cure The hunger and thirst of day's distemperature And ravin of the dry discolouring hours, Hath he not bid relume their flameless flowers With summer fire and heat of lamping song, And bid the short-lived things, long dead, live long, And thought remake their wan funereal fames, And the sweet shining signs of women's names That mark the months out and the weeks anew He moves in changeless change of seasons through To fill the days up of his dateless year Flame from Queen Helen to Queen Guenevere? For first of all the sphery signs whereby Love severs light from darkness, and most high, In the white front of January there glows The rose-red sign of Helen like a rose: And gold-eyed as the shore-flower shelterless Whereon the sharp-breathed sea blows bitterness, A storm-star that the seafarers of love Strain their wind-wearied eyes for glimpses of, Shoots keen through February's grey frost and damp The lamplike star of Hero for a lamp; The star that Marlowe sang into our skies With mouth of gold, and morning in his eyes; And in clear March across the rough blue sea The signal sapphire of Alcyone Makes bright the blown brows of the wind-foot year; And shining like a sunbeam-smitten tear Full ere it fall, the fair next sign in sight Burns opal-wise with April-coloured light When air is quick with song and rain and flame, My birth-month star that in love's heaven hath name Iseult, a light of blossom and beam and shower, My singing sign that makes the song-tree flower; Next like a pale and burning pearl beyond The rose-white sphere of flower-named Rosamond Signs the sweet head of Maytime; and for June Flares like an angered and storm-reddening moon Her signal sphere, whose Carthaginian pyre Shadowed her traitor's flying sail with fire; Next, glittering as the wine-bright jacinth-stone, A star south-risen that first to music shone, The keen girl-star of golden Juliet bears Light northward to the month whose forehead wears Her name for flower upon it, and his trees Mix their deep English song with Veronese; And like an awful sovereign chrysolite Burning, the supreme fire that blinds the night, The hot gold head of Venus kissed by Mars, A sun-flower among small sphered flowers of stars, The light of Cleopatra fills and burns The hollow of heaven whence ardent August yearns; And fixed and shining as the sister-shed Sweet tears for Phaethon disorbed and dead, The pale bright autumn's amber-coloured sphere, That through September sees the saddening year As love sees change through sorrow, hath to name Francesca's; and the star that watches flame The embers of the harvest overgone Is Thisbe's, slain of love in Babylon, Set in the golden girdle of sweet signs A blood-bright ruby; last save one light shines An eastern wonder of sphery chrysopras, The star that made men mad, Angelica's; And latest named and lordliest, with a sound Of swords and harps in heaven that ring it round, Last love-light and last love-song of the year's, Gleams like a glorious emerald Guenevere's. These are the signs wherethrough the year sees move, Full of the sun, the sun-god which is love, A fiery body blood-red from the heart Outward, with fire-white wings made wide apart, That close not and unclose not, but upright Steered without wind by their own light and might Sweep through the flameless fire of air that rings From heaven to heaven with thunder of wheels and wings And antiphones of motion-moulded rhyme Through spaces out of space and timeless time. So shine above dead chance and conquered change The spherèd signs, and leave without their range Doubt and desire, and hope with fear for wife, Pale pains, and pleasures long worn out of life. Yea, even the shadows of them spiritless, Through the dim door of sleep that seem to press, Forms without form, a piteous people and blind, Men and no men, whose lamentable kind The shadow of death and shadow of life compel Through semblances of heaven and false-faced hell, Through dreams of light and dreams of darkness tost On waves innavigable, are these so lost? Shapes that wax pale and shift in swift strange wise, Void faces with unspeculative eyes, Dim things that gaze and glare, dead mouths that move, Featureless heads discrowned of hate and love, Mockeries and masks of motion and mute breath, Leavings of life, the superflux of death— If these things and no more than these things be Left when man ends or changes, who can see? Or who can say with what more subtle sense Their subtler natures taste in air less dense A life less thick and palpable than ours, Warmed with faint fires and sweetened with dead flowers And measured by low music? how time fares In that wan time-forgotten world of theirs, Their pale poor world too deep for sun or star To live in, where the eyes of Helen are, And hers who made as God's own eyes to shine The eyes that met them of the Florentine, Wherein the godhead thence transfigured lit All time for all men with the shadow of it? Ah, and these too felt on them as God's grace The pity and glory of this man's breathing face; For these too, these my lovers, these my twain, Saw Dante, saw God visible by pain, With lips that thundered and with feet that trod Before men's eyes incognisable God; Saw love and wrath and light and night and fire Live with one life and at one mouth respire, And in one golden sound their whole soul heard Sounding, one sweet immitigable word. They have the night, who had like us the day; We, whom day binds, shall have the night as they. We, from the fetters of the light unbound, Healed of our wound of living, shall sleep sound. All gifts but one the jealous God may keep From our soul's longing, one he cannot—sleep. This, though he grudge all other grace to prayer, This grace his closed hand cannot choose but spare. This, though his ear be sealed to all that live, Be it lightly given or lothly, God must give. We, as the men whose name on earth is none, We too shall surely pass out of the sun; Out of the sound and eyeless light of things, Wide as the stretch of life's time-wandering wings, Wide as the naked world and shadowless, And long-lived as the world's own weariness. Us too, when all the fires of time are cold, The heights shall hide us and the depths shall hold. Us too, when all the tears of time are dry, The night shall lighten from her tearless eye. Blind is the day and eyeless all its light, But the large unbewildered eye of night Hath sense and speculation; and the sheer Limitless length of lifeless life and clear, The timeless space wherein the brief worlds move Clothed with light life and fruitful with light love, With hopes that threaten, and with fears that cease, Past fear and hope, hath in it only peace. Yet of these lives inlaid with hopes and fears, Spun fine as fire and jewelled thick with tears, These lives made out of loves that long since were, Lives wrought as ours of earth and burning air, Fugitive flame, and water of secret springs, And clothed with joys and sorrows as with wings, Some yet are good, if aught be good, to save Some while from washing wreck and wrecking wave. Was such not theirs, the twain I take, and give Out of my life to make their dead life live Some days of mine, and blow my living breath Between dead lips forgotten even of death? So many and many of old have given my twain Love and live song and honey-hearted pain, Whose root is sweetness and whose fruit is sweet, So many and with such joy have tracked their feet, What should I do to follow? yet I too, I have the heart to follow, many or few Be the feet gone before me; for the way, Rose-red with remnant roses of the day Westward, and eastward white with stars that break, Between the green and foam is fair to take For any sail the sea-wind steers for me From morning into morning, sea to sea. I THE SAILING OF THE SWALLOW About the middle music of the spring Came from the castled shore of Ireland's king A fair ship stoutly sailing, eastward bound And south by Wales and all its wonders round To the loud rocks and ringing reaches home That take the wild wrath of the Cornish foam, Past Lyonesse unswallowed of the tides And high Carlion that now the steep sea hides To the wind-hollowed heights and gusty bays Of sheer Tintagel, fair with famous days. Above the stem a gilded swallow shone, Wrought with straight wings and eyes of glittering stone As flying sunward oversea, to bear Green summer with it through the singing air. And on the deck between the rowers at dawn, As the bright sail with brightening wind was drawn, Sat with full face against the strengthening light Iseult, more fair than foam or dawn was white. Her gaze was glad past love's own singing of, And her face lovely past desire of love. Past thought and speech her maiden motions were, And a more golden sunrise was her hair. The very veil of her bright flesh was made As of light woven and moonbeam-coloured shade More fine than moonbeams; white her eyelids shone As snow sun-stricken that endures the sun, And through their curled and coloured clouds of deep Luminous lashes thick as dreams in sleep Shone as the sea's depth swallowing up the sky's The springs of unimaginable eyes. As the wave's subtler emerald is pierced through With the utmost heaven's inextricable blue, And both are woven and molten in one sleight Of amorous colour and implicated light Under the golden guard and gaze of noon, So glowed their awless amorous plenilune, Azure and gold and ardent grey, made strange With fiery difference and deep interchange Inexplicable of glories multiform; Now as the sullen sapphire swells toward storm Foamless, their bitter beauty grew acold, And now afire with ardour of fine gold. Her flower-soft lips were meek and passionate, For love upon them like a shadow sate Patient, a foreseen vision of sweet things, A dream with eyes fast shut and plumeless wings That knew not what man's love or life should be, Nor had it sight nor heart to hope or see What thing should come, but childlike satisfied Watched out its virgin vigil in soft pride And unkissed expectation; and the glad Clear cheeks and throat and tender temples had Such maiden heat as if a rose's blood Beat in the live heart of a lily-bud. Between the small round breasts a white way led Heavenward, and from slight foot to slender head The whole fair body flower-like swayed and shone Moving, and what her light hand leant upon Grew blossom-scented: her warm arms began To round and ripen for delight of man That they should clasp and circle: her fresh hands, Like regent lilies of reflowering lands Whose vassal firstlings, crown and star and plume, Bow down to the empire of that sovereign bloom, Shone sceptreless, and from her face there went A silent light as of a God content; Save when, more swift and keen than love or shame, Some flash of blood, light as the laugh of flame, Broke it with sudden beam and shining speech, As dream by dream shot through her eyes, and each Outshone the last that lightened, and not one Showed her such things as should be borne and done. Though hard against her shone the sunlike face That in all change and wreck of time and place Should be the star of her sweet living soul. Nor had love made it as his written scroll For evil will and good to read in yet; But smooth and mighty, without scar or fret, Fresh and high-lifted was the helmless brow As the oak-tree flower that tops the topmost bough, Ere it drop off before the perfect leaf; And nothing save his name he had of grief, The name his mother, dying as he was born, Made out of sorrow in very sorrow's scorn, And set it on him smiling in her sight, Tristram; who now, clothed with sweet youth and might, As a glad witness wore that bitter name, The second symbol of the world for fame. Famous and full of fortune was his youth Ere the beard's bloom had left his cheek unsmooth, And in his face a lordship of strong joy And height of heart no chance could curb or cloy Lightened, and all that warmed them at his eyes Loved them as larks that kindle as they rise Toward light they turn to music love the blue strong skies. So like the morning through the morning moved Tristram, a light to look on and be loved. Song sprang between his lips and hands, and shone Singing, and strengthened and sank down thereon As a bird settles to the second flight, Then from beneath his harping hands with might Leapt, and made way and had its fill and died, And all whose hearts were fed upon it sighed Silent, and in them all the fire of tears Burned as wine drunken not with lips but ears. And gazing on his fervent hands that made The might of music all their souls obeyed With trembling strong subservience of delight, Full many a maid that had him once in sight Thought in the secret rapture of her heart In how dark onset had these hands borne part How oft, and were so young and sweet of skill; And those red lips whereon the song burned still, What words and cries of battle had they flung Athwart the swing and shriek of swords, so young; And eyes as glad as summer, what strange youth Fed them so full of happy heart and truth, That had seen sway from side to sundering side The steel flow of that terrible springtide That the moon rules not, but the fire and light Of men's hearts mixed in the mid mirth of fight. Therefore the joy and love of him they had Made thought more amorous in them and more glad For his fame's sake remembered, and his youth Gave his fame flowerlike fragrance and soft growth As of a rose requickening, when he stood Fair in their eye, a flower of faultless blood. And that sad queen to whom his life was death, A rose plucked forth of summer in mid breath, A star fall'n out of season in mid throe Of that life's joy that makes the star's life glow, Made their love sadder toward him and more strong. And in mid change of time and fight and song Chance cast him westward on the low sweet strand Where songs are sung of the old green Irish land, And the sky loves it, and the sea loves best, And as a bird is taken to man's breast The sweet-souled land where sorrow sweetest sings Is wrapt round with them as with hands and wings And taken to the sea's heart as a flower. There in the luck and light of his good hour Came to the king's court like a noteless man Tristram, and while some half a season ran Abode before him harping in his hall, And taught sweet craft of new things musical To the dear maiden mouth and innocent hands That for his sake are famous in all lands. Yet was not love between them, for their fate Lay wrapt in its appointed hour at wait, And had no flower to show yet, and no sting. But once being vexed with some past wound the king Bade give him comfort of sweet baths, and then Should Iseult watch him as his handmaiden, For his more honour in men's sight, and ease The hurts he had with holy remedies Made by her mother's magic in strange hours Out of live roots and life-compelling flowers. And finding by the wound's shape in his side This was the knight by whom their strength had died And all their might in one man overthrown Had left their shame in sight of all men shown, She would have slain him swordless with his sword; Yet seemed he to her so great and fair a lord She heaved up hand and smote not; then said he, Laughing—‘What comfort shall this dead man be, Damsel? what hurt is for my blood to heal? But set your hand not near the toothèd steel Lest the fang strike it.’—‘Yea, the fang,’ she said, ‘Should it not sting the very serpent dead That stung mine uncle? for his slayer art thou, And half my mother's heart is bloodless now Through thee, that mad'st the veins of all her kin Bleed in his wounds whose veins through thee ran thin.’ Yet thought she how their hot chief's violent heart Had flung the fierce word forth upon their part Which bade to battle the best knight that stood On Arthur's, and so dying of his wild mood Had set upon his conqueror's flesh the seal Of his mishallowed and anointed steel, Whereof the venom and enchanted might Made the sign burn here branded in her sight. These things she stood recasting, and her soul Subsiding till its wound of wrath were whole Grew smooth again, as thought still softening stole Through all its tempered passion; nor might hate Keep high the fire against him lit of late; But softly from his smiling sight she passed. And peace thereafter made between them fast Made peace between two kingdoms, when he went Home with hands reconciled and heart content, To bring fair truce 'twixt Cornwall's wild bright strand And the long wrangling wars of that loud land. And when full peace was struck betwixt them twain Forth must he fare by those green straits again, And bring back Iseult for a plighted bride And set to reign at Mark his uncle's side. So now with feast made and all triumphs done They sailed between the moonfall and the sun Under the spent stars eastward; but the queen Out of wise heart and subtle love had seen Such things as might be, dark as in a glass, And lest some doom of these should come to pass Bethought her with her secret soul alone To work some charm for marriage unison And strike the heart of Iseult to her lord With power compulsive more than stroke of sword. Therefore with marvellous herbs and spells she wrought To win the very wonder of her thought, And brewed it with her secret hands and blest And drew and gave out of her secret breast To one her chosen and Iseult's handmaiden, Brangwain, and bade her hide from sight of men This marvel covered in a golden cup, So covering in her heart the counsel up As in the gold the wondrous wine lay close; And when the last shout with the last cup rose About the bride and bridegroom bound to bed, Then should this one word of her will be said To her new-married maiden child, that she Should drink with Mark this draught in unity, And no lip touch it for her sake but theirs: For with long love and consecrating prayers The wine was hallowed for their mouths to pledge; And if a drop fell from the beaker's edge That drop should Iseult hold as dear as blood Shed from her mother's heart to do her good. And having drunk they twain should be one heart Who were one flesh till fleshly death should part— Death, who parts all. So Brangwain swore, and kept The hid thing by her while she waked or slept. And now they sat to see the sun again Whose light of eye had looked on no such twain Since Galahault in the rose-time of the year Brought Launcelot first to sight of Guenevere. And Tristram caught her changing eyes and said: “As this day raises daylight from the dead Might not this face the life of a dead man?” And Iseult, gazing where the sea was wan Out of the sun's way, said: “I pray you not Praise me, but tell me there in Camelot, Saving the queen, who hath most name of fair? I would I were a man and dwelling there, That I might win me better praise than yours, Even such as you have; for your praise endures, That with great deeds ye wring from mouths of men, But ours—for shame, where is it? Tell me then, Since woman may not wear a better here, Who of this praise hath most save Guenevere?” And Tristram, lightening with a laugh held in— “Surely a little praise is this to win, A poor praise and a little! but of these Hapless, whom love serves only with bowed knees, Of such poor women fairer face hath none That lifts her eyes alive against the sun Than Arthur's sister, whom the north seas call Mistress of isles; so yet majestical Above the crowns on younger heads she moves, Outlightening with her eyes our late-born loves.” “Ah,” said Iseult, “is she more tall than I? Look, I am tall;” and struck the mast hard by, With utmost upward reach of her bright hand; “And look, fair lord, now, when I rise and stand, How high with feet unlifted I can touch Standing straight up; could this queen do thus much? Nay, over tall she must be then, like me; Less fair than lesser women. May this be, That still she stands the second stateliest there, So more than many so much younger fair, She, born when yet the king your lord was not, And has the third knight after Launcelot And after you to serve her? nay, sir, then God made her for a godlike sign to men.” “Ay,” Tristram answered, “for a sign, a sign— Would God it were not! for no planets shine With half such fearful forecast of men's fate As a fair face so more unfortunate.” Then with a smile that lit not on her brows But moved upon her red mouth tremulous Light as a sea-bird's motion oversea, “Yea,” quoth Iseult, “the happier hap for me, With no such face to bring men no such fate. Yet her might all we women born too late Praise for good hap, who so enskied above Not more in age excels us than man's love.” There came a glooming light on Tristram's face Answering: “God keep you better in his grace Than to sit down beside her in men's sight. For if men be not blind whom God gives light And lie not in whose lips he bids truth live, Great grief shall she be given, and greater give. For Merlin witnessed of her years ago That she should work woe and should suffer woe Beyond the race of women: and in truth Her face, a spell that knows nor age nor youth, Like youth being soft, and subtler-eyed than age, With lips that mock the doom her eyes presage, Hath on it such a light of cloud and fire, With charm and change of keen or dim desire, And over all a fearless look of fear Hung like a veil across its changing cheer, Made up of fierce foreknowledge and sharp scorn, That it were better she had not been born. For not love's self can help a face which hath Such insubmissive anguish of wan wrath, Blind prescience and self-contemptuous hate Of her own soul and heavy-footed fate, Writ broad upon its beauty: none the less Its fire of bright and burning bitterness Takes with as quick a flame the sense of men As any sunbeam, nor is quenched again With any drop of dewfall; yea, I think No herb of force or blood-compelling drink Would heal a heart that ever it made hot. Ay, and men too that greatly love her not, Seeing the great love of her and Lamoracke, Make no great marvel, nor look strangely back When with his gaze about her she goes by Pale as a breathless and star-quickening sky Between moonrise and sunset, and moves out Clothed with the passion of his eyes about As night with all her stars, yet night is black; And she, clothed warm with love of Lamoracke, Girt with his worship as with girdling gold, Seems all at heart anhungered and acold, Seems sad at heart and loveless of the light, As night, star-clothed or naked, is but night.” And with her sweet eyes sunken, and the mirth Dead in their look as earth lies dead in earth That reigned on earth and triumphed, Iseult said: “Is it her shame of something done and dead Or fear of something to be born and done That so in her soul's eye puts out the sun?” And Tristram answered: “Surely, as I think, This gives her soul such bitterness to drink, The sin born blind, the sightless sin unknown, Wrought when the summer in her blood was blown But scarce aflower, and spring first flushed her will With bloom of dreams no fruitage should fulfil, When out of vision and desire was wrought The sudden sin that from the living thought Leaps a live deed and dies not: then there came On that blind sin swift eyesight like a flame Touching the dark to death, and made her mad With helpless knowledge that too late forbade What was before the bidding: and she knew How sore a life dead love should lead her through To what sure end how fearful; and though yet Nor with her blood nor tears her way be wet And she look bravely with set face on fate, Yet she knows well the serpent hour at wait Somewhere to sting and spare not; ay, and he, Arthur”— “The king,” quoth Iseult suddenly, “Doth the king too live so in sight of fear? They say sin touches not a man so near As shame a woman; yet he too should be Part of the penance, being more deep than she Set in the sin.” “Nay,” Tristram said, “for thus It fell by wicked hap and hazardous, That wittingly he sinned no more than youth May sin and be assoiled of God and truth, Repenting; since in his first year of reign As he stood splendid with his foemen slain And light of new-blown battles, flushed and hot With hope and life, came greeting from King Lot Out of his wind-worn islands oversea, And homage to my king and fealty Of those north seas wherein the strange shapes swim, As from his man; and Arthur greeted him As his good lord and courteously, and bade To his high feast; who coming with him had This Queen Morgause of Orkney, his fair wife, In the green middle Maytime of her life, And scarce in April was our king's as then, And goodliest was he of all flowering men, And of what graft as yet himself knew not; But cold as rains in autumn was King Lot And grey-grown out of season: so there sprang Swift love between them, and all spring through sang Light in their joyous hearing; for none knew The bitter bond of blood between them two, Twain fathers but one mother, till too late The sacred mouth of Merlin set forth fate And brake the secret seal on Arthur's birth, And showed his ruin and his rule on earth Inextricable, and light on lives to be. For surely, though time slay us, yet shall we Have such high name and lordship of good days As shall sustain us living, and men's praise Shall burn a beacon lit above us dead. And of the king how shall not this be said When any of us from any mouth has praise, That such were men in only this king's days, In Arthur's? yea, come shine or shade, no less His name shall be one name with knightliness, His fame one light with sunlight. Yet in sooth His age shall bear the burdens of his youth And bleed from his own bloodshed; for indeed Blind to him blind his sister brought forth seed, And of the child between them shall be born Destruction: so shall God not suffer scorn, Nor in men's souls and lives his law lie dead.” And as one moved and marvelling Iseult said: “Great pity it is and strange it seems to me God could not do them so much right as we, Who slay not men for witless evil done; And these the noblest under God's glad sun For sin they knew not he that knew shall slay, And smite blind men for stumbling in fair day. What good is it to God that such should die? Shall the sun's light grow sunnier in the sky Because their light of spirit is clean put out?” And sighing, she looked from wave to cloud about, And even with that the full-grown feet of day Sprang upright on the quivering water-way, And his face burned against her meeting face Most like a lover's thrilled with great love's grace Whose glance takes fire and gives; the quick sea shone And shivered like spread wings of angels blown By the sun's breath before him; and a low Sweet gale shook all the foam-flowers of thin snow As into rainfall of sea-roses shed Leaf by wild leaf on that green garden-bed Which tempests till and sea-winds turn and plough: For rosy and fiery round the running prow Fluttered the flakes and feathers of the spray, And bloomed like blossoms cast by God away To waste on the ardent water; swift the moon Withered to westward as a face in swoon Death-stricken by glad tidings: and the height Throbbed and the centre quivered with delight And the depth quailed with passion as of love, Till like the heart of some new-mated dove Air, light, and wave seemed full of burning rest, With motion as of one God's beating breast. And her heart sprang in Iseult, and she drew With all her spirit and life the sunrise through, And through her lips the keen triumphant air Sea-scented, sweeter than land-roses were, And through her eyes the whole rejoicing east Sun-satisfied, and all the heaven at feast Spread for the morning; and the imperious mirth Of wind and light that moved upon the earth, Making the spring, and all the fruitful might And strong regeneration of delight That swells the seedling leaf and sapling man, Since the first life in the first world began To burn and burgeon through void limbs and veins, And the first love with sharp sweet procreant pains To pierce and bring forth roses; yea, she felt Through her own soul the sovereign morning melt, And all the sacred passion of the sun; And as the young clouds flamed and were undone About him coming, touched and burnt away In rosy ruin and yellow spoil of day, The sweet veil of her body and corporal sense Felt the dawn also cleave it, and incense With light from inward and with effluent heat The kindling soul through fleshly hands and feet. And as the august great blossom of the dawn Burst, and the full sun scarce from sea withdrawn Seemed on the fiery water a flower afloat, So as a fire the mighty morning smote Throughout her, and incensed with the influent hour Her whole soul's one great mystical red flower Burst, and the bud of her sweet spirit broke Rose-fashion, and the strong spring at a stroke Thrilled, and was cloven, and from the full sheath came The whole rose of the woman red as flame: And all her Mayday blood as from a swoon Flushed, and May rose up in her and was June. So for a space her heart as heavenward burned: Then with half summer in her eyes she turned, And on her lips was April yet, and smiled, As though the spirit and sense unreconciled Shrank laughing back, and would not ere its hour Let life put forth the irrevocable flower. And the soft speech between them grew again With questionings and records of what men Rose mightiest, and what names for love or fight Shone starriest overhead of queen or knight. There Tristram spake of many a noble thing, High feast and storm of tournay round the king, Strange quest by perilous lands of marsh and brake And circling woods branch-knotted like a snake And places pale with sins that they had seen, Where was no life of red fruit or of green But all was as a dead face wan and dun; And bowers of evil builders whence the sun Turns silent, and the moon holds hardly light Above them through the sick and star-crossed night; And of their hands through whom such holds lay waste, And all their strengths dishevelled and defaced Fell ruinous, and were not from north to south: And of the might of Merlin's ancient mouth, The son of no man's loins, begot by doom In speechless sleep out of a spotless womb; For sleeping among graves where none had rest And ominous houses of dead bones unblest Among the grey grass rough as old rent hair And wicked herbage whitening like despair And blown upon with blasts of dolorous breath From gaunt rare gaps and hollow doors of death, A maid unspotted, senseless of the spell, Felt not about her breathe some thing of hell Whose child and hers was Merlin; and to him Great light from God gave sight of all things dim And wisdom of all wondrous things, to say What root should bear what fruit of night or day, And sovereign speech and counsel higher than man; Wherefore his youth like age was wise and wan, And his age sorrowful and fain to sleep; Yet should sleep never, neither laugh nor weep, Till in some depth of deep sweet land or sea The heavenly hands of holier Nimue, That was the nurse of Launcelot, and most sweet Of all that move with magical soft feet Among us, being of lovelier blood and breath, Should shut him in with sleep as kind as death: For she could pass between the quick and dead: And of her love toward Pelleas, for whose head Love-wounded and world-wearied she had won A place beyond all pain in Avalon; And of the fire that wasted afterward The loveless eyes and bosom of Ettarde, In whose false love his faultless heart had burned; And now being rapt from her, her lost heart yearned To seek him, and passed hungering out of life: And after all the thunder-hours of strife That roared between King Claudas and King Ban How Nimue's mighty nursling waxed to man, And how from his first field such grace he got That all men's hearts bowed down to Launcelot, And how the high prince Galahault held him dear And led him even to love of Guenevere And to that kiss which made break forth as fire The laugh that was the flower of his desire, The laugh that lightened at her lips for bliss To win from Love so great a lover's kiss: And of the toil of Balen all his days To reap but thorns for fruit and tears for praise, Whose hap was evil as his heart was good, And all his works and ways by wold and wood Led through much pain to one last labouring day When blood for tears washed grief with life away: And of the kin of Arthur, and their might; The misborn head of Mordred, sad as night, With cold waste cheeks and eyes as keen as pain, And the close angry lips of Agravaine; And gracious Gawain, scattering words as flowers, The kindliest head of worldly paramours; And the fair hand of Gareth, found in fight Strong as a sea-beast's tushes and as white; And of the king's self, glorious yet and glad For all the toil and doubt of doom he had, Clothed with men's loves and full of kingly days. Then Iseult said: “Let each knight have his praise And each good man good witness of his worth; But when men laud the second name on earth, Whom would they praise to have no worldly peer Save him whose love makes glorious Guenevere?” “Nay,” Tristram said, “such man as he is none.” “What,” said she, “there is none such under sun Of all the large earth's living? yet I deemed Men spake of one—but maybe men that dreamed, Fools and tongue-stricken, witless, babbler's breed— That for all high things was his peer indeed Save this one highest, to be so loved and love.” And Tristram: “Little wit had these thereof; For there is none such in the world as this.” “Ay, upon land,” quoth Iseult, “none such is, I doubt not, nor where fighting folk may be; But were there none such between sky and sea, The world's whole worth were poorer than I wist.” And Tristram took her flower-white hand and kissed, Laughing; and through his fair face as in shame The light blood lightened. “Hear they no such name?” She said; and he, “If there be such a word, I wot the queen's poor harper hath not heard.” Then, as the fuller-feathered hours grew long, He holp to speed their warm slow feet with song. “Love, is it morning risen or night deceased That makes the mirth of this triumphant east? Is it bliss given or bitterness put by That makes most glad men's hearts at love's high feast? Grief smiles, joy weeps, that day should live and die. “Is it with soul's thirst or with body's drouth That summer yearns out sunward to the south, With all the flowers that when thy birth drew nigh Were molten in one rose to make thy mouth? O love, what care though day should live and die? “Is the sun glad of all the love on earth, The spirit and sense and work of things and worth? Is the moon sad because the month must fly And bring her death that can but bring back birth? For all these things as day must live and die. “Love, is it day that makes thee thy delight Or thou that seest day made out of thy light? Love, as the sun and sea are thou and I, Sea without sun dark, sun without sea bright; The sun is one though day should live and die. “O which is elder, night or light, who knows? And life or love, which first of these twain grows? For life is born of love to wail and cry, And love is born of life to heal his woes, And light of night, that day should live and die. “O sun of heaven above the worldly sea, O very love, what light is this of thee! My sea of soul is deep as thou art high, But all thy light is shed through all of me, As love's through love, while day shall live and die. “Nay,” said Iseult, “your song is hard to read.” “Ay?” said he: “or too light a song to heed, Too slight to follow, it may be? Who shall sing Of love but as a churl before a king If by love's worth men rate his worthiness? Yet as the poor churl's worth to sing is less, Surely the more shall be the great king's grace To show for churlish love a kindlier face.” “No churl,” she said, “but one in soothsayer's wise Who tells but truths that help no more than lies. I have heard men sing of love a simpler way Than these wrought riddles made of night and day, Like jewelled reins whereon the rhyme-bells hang.” And Tristram smiled and changed his song and sang. “The breath between my lips of lips not mine, Like spirit in sense that makes pure sense divine, Is as life in them from the living sky That entering fills my heart with blood of thine And thee with me, while day shall live and die. “Thy soul is shed into me with thy breath, And in my heart each heartbeat of thee saith How in thy life the lifesprings of me lie, Even one life to be gathered of one death In me and thee, though day may live and die. “Ah, who knows now if in my veins it be My blood that feels life sweet, or blood of thee, And this thine eyesight kindled in mine eye That shows me in thy flesh the soul of me, For thine made mine, while day may live and die? “Ah, who knows yet if one be twain or one, And sunlight separable again from sun, And I from thee with all my lifesprings dry, And thou from me with all thine heartbeats done, Dead separate souls while day shall live and die? “I see my soul within thine eyes, and hear My spirit in all thy pulses thrill with fear, And in my lips the passion of thee sigh, And music of me made in mine own ear; Am I not thou while day shall live and die? “Art thou not I as I thy love am thou? So let all things pass from us; we are now, For all that was and will be, who knows why? And all that is and is not, who knows how? Who knows? God knows why day should live and die.” And Iseult mused and spake no word, but sought Through all the hushed ways of her tongueless thought What face or covered likeness of a face In what veiled hour or dream-determined place She seeing might take for love's face, and believe This was the spirit to whom all spirits cleave. For that sweet wonder of the twain made one And each one twain, incorporate sun with sun, Star with star molten, soul with soul imbued, And all the soul's works, all their multitude, Made one thought and one vision and one song, Love—this thing, this, laid hand on her so strong She could not choose but yearn till she should see. So went she musing down her thoughts; but he, Sweet-hearted as a bird that takes the sun With clear strong eyes and feels the glad god run Bright through his blood and wide rejoicing wings, And opens all himself to heaven and sings, Made her mind light and full of noble mirth With words and songs the gladdest grown on earth, Till she was blithe and high of heart as he. So swam the Swallow through the springing sea. And while they sat at speech as at a feast, Came a light wind fast hardening forth of the east And blackening till its might had marred the skies; And the sea thrilled as with heart-sundering sighs One after one drawn, with each breath it drew, And the green hardened into iron blue, And the soft light went out of all its face. Then Tristram girt him for an oarsman's place And took his oar and smote, and toiled with might In the east wind's full face and the strong sea's spite Labouring; and all the rowers rowed hard, but he More mightily than any wearier three. And Iseult watched him rowing with sinless eyes That loved him but in holy girlish wise For noble joy in his fair manliness And trust and tender wonder; none the less She thought if God had given her grace to be Man, and make war on danger of earth and sea, Even such a man she would be; for his stroke Was mightiest as the mightier water broke, And in sheer measure like strong music drave Clean through the wet weight of the wallowing wave; And as a tune before a great king played For triumph was the tune their strong strokes made, And sped the ship through with smooth strife of oars Over the mid sea's grey foam-paven floors, For all the loud breach of the waves at will. So for an hour they fought the storm out still, And the shorn foam spun from the blades, and high The keel sprang from the wave-ridge, and the sky Glared at them for a breath's space through the rain; Then the bows with a sharp shock plunged again Down, and the sea clashed on them, and so rose The bright stem like one panting from swift blows, And as a swimmer's joyous beaten head Rears itself laughing, so in that sharp stead The light ship lifted her long quivering bows As might the man his buffeted strong brows Out of the wave-breach; for with one stroke yet Went all men's oars together, strongly set As to loud music, and with hearts uplift They smote their strong way through the drench and drift: Till the keen hour had chafed itself to death And the east wind fell fitfully, breath by breath, Tired; and across the thin and slackening rain Sprang the face southward of the sun again. Then all they rested and were eased at heart; And Iseult rose up where she sat apart, And with her sweet soul deepening her deep eyes Cast the furs from her and subtle embroideries That wrapped her from the storming rain and spray, And shining like all April in one day, Hair, face, and throat dashed with the straying showers, She stood the first of all the whole world's flowers, And laughed on Tristram with her eyes, and said, “I too have heart then, I was not afraid.” And answering some light courteous word of grace He saw her clear face lighten on his face Unwittingly, with unenamoured eyes, For the last time. A live man in such wise Looks in the deadly face of his fixed hour And laughs with lips wherein he hath no power To keep the life yet some five minutes' space. So Tristram looked on Iseult face to face And knew not, and she knew not. The last time— The last that should be told in any rhyme Heard anywhere on mouths of singing men That ever should sing praise of them again; The last hour of their hurtless hearts at rest, The last that peace should touch them, breast to breast, The last that sorrow far from them should sit, This last was with them, and they knew not it. For Tristram being athirst with toil now spake, Saying, “Iseult, for all dear love's labour's sake Give me to drink, and give me for a pledge The touch of four lips on the beaker's edge.” And Iseult sought and would not wake Brangwain Who slept as one half dead with fear and pain, Being tender-natured; so with hushed light feet Went Iseult round her, with soft looks and sweet Pitying her pain; so sweet a spirited thing She was, and daughter of a kindly king. And spying what strange bright secret charge was kept Fast in that maid's white bosom while she slept, She sought and drew the gold cup forth and smiled Marvelling, with such light wonder as a child That hears of glad sad life in magic lands; And bare it back to Tristram with pure hands Holding the love-draught that should be for flame To burn out of them fear and faith and shame, And lighten all their life up in men's sight, And make them sad for ever. Then the knight Bowed toward her and craved whence had she this strange thing That might be spoil of some dim Asian king, By starlight stolen from some waste place of sands, And a maid bore it here in harmless hands. And Iseult, laughing—“Other lords that be Feast, and their men feast after them; but we, Our men must keep the best wine back to feast Till they be full and we of all men least Feed after them and fain to fare so well: So with mine handmaid and your squire it fell That hid this bright thing from us in a wile:” And with light lips yet full of their swift smile, And hands that wist not though they dug a grave, Undid the hasps of gold, and drank, and gave, And he drank after, a deep glad kingly draught: And all their life changed in them, for they quaffed Death; if it be death so to drink, and fare As men who change and are what these twain were. And shuddering with eyes full of fear and fire And heart-stung with a serpentine desire He turned and saw the terror in her eyes That yearned upon him shining in such wise As a star midway in the midnight fixed. Their Galahault was the cup, and she that mixed; Nor other hand there needed, nor sweet speech To lure their lips together; each on each Hung with strange eyes and hovered as a bird Wounded, and each mouth trembled for a word; Their heads neared, and their hands were drawn in one, And they saw dark, though still the unsunken sun Far through fine rain shot fire into the south; And their four lips became one burning mouth. II THE QUEEN'S PLEASANCE Out of the night arose the second day, And saw the ship's bows break the shoreward spray. As the sun's boat of gold and fire began To sail the sea of heaven unsailed of man, And the soft waves of sacred air to break Round the prow launched into the morning's lake, They saw the sign of their sea-travel done. Ah, was not something seen of yester-sun, When the sweet light that lightened all the skies Saw nothing fairer than one maiden's eyes, That whatsoever in all time's years may be To-day's sun nor to-morrow's sun shall see? Not while she lives, not when she comes to die, Shall she look sunward with that sinless eye. Yet fairer now than song may show them stand Tristram and Iseult, hand in amorous hand, Soul-satisfied, their eyes made great and bright With all the love of all the livelong night; With all its hours yet singing in their ears No mortal music made of thoughts and tears, But such a song, past conscience of man's thought, As hearing he grows god and knows it not. Nought else they saw nor heard but what the night Had left for seal upon their sense and sight, Sound of past pulses beating, fire of amorous light. Enough, and overmuch, and never yet Enough, though love still hungering feed and fret, To fill the cup of night which dawn must overset. For still their eyes were dimmer than with tears And dizzier from diviner sounds their ears Than though from choral thunders of the quiring spheres. They heard not how the landward waters rang, Nor saw where high into the morning sprang, Riven from the shore and bastioned with the sea, Toward summits where the north wind's nest might be, A wave-walled palace with its eastern gate Full of the sunrise now and wide at wait, And on the mighty-moulded stairs that clomb Sheer from the fierce lip of the lapping foam The knights of Mark that stood before the wall. So with loud joy and storm of festival They brought the bride in up the towery way That rose against the rising front of day, Stair based on stair, between the rocks unhewn, To those strange halls wherethrough the tidal tune Rang loud or lower from soft or strengthening sea, Tower shouldering tower, to windward and to lee, With change of floors and stories, flight on flight, That clomb and curled up to the crowning height Whence men might see wide east and west in one And on one sea waned moon and mounting sun. And severed from the sea-rock's base, where stand Some worn walls yet they saw the broken strand, The beachless cliff that in the sheer sea dips, The sleepless shore inexorable to ships, And the straight causeway's bare gaunt spine between The sea-spanned walls and naked mainland's green. On the mid stairs, between the light and dark, Before the main tower's portal stood King Mark, Crowned: and his face was as the face of one Long time athirst and hungering for the sun In barren thrall of bitter bonds, who now Thinks here to feel its blessing on his brow. A swart lean man, but kinglike, still of guise, With black streaked beard and cold unquiet eyes, Close-mouthed, gaunt-cheeked, wan as a morning moon, Though hardly time on his worn hair had strewn The thin first ashes from a sparing hand: Yet little fire there burnt upon the brand, And way-worn seemed he with life's wayfaring. So between shade and sunlight stood the king, And his face changed nor yearned not toward his bride; But fixed between mild hope and patient pride Abode what gift of rare or lesser worth This day might bring to all his days on earth. But at the glory of her when she came His heart endured not: very fear and shame Smote him, to take her by the hand and kiss, Till both were molten in the burning bliss, And with a thin flame flushing his cold face He led her silent to the bridal place. There were they wed and hallowed of the priest; And all the loud time of the marriage feast One thought within three hearts was as a fire, Where craft and faith took counsel with desire. For when the feast had made a glorious end They gave the new queen for her maids to tend At dawn of bride-night, and thereafter bring With marriage music to the bridegroom king. Then by device of craft between them laid To him went Brangwain delicately, and prayed That this thing even for love's sake might not be, But without sound or light or eye to see She might come in to bride-bed: and he laughed, As one that wist not well of wise love's craft, And bade all bridal things be as she would. Yet of his gentleness he gat not good; For clothed and covered with the nuptial dark Soft like a bride came Brangwain to King Mark, And to the queen came Tristram; and the night Fled, and ere danger of detective light From the king sleeping Brangwain slid away, And where had lain her handmaid Iseult lay. And the king waking saw beside his head That face yet passion-coloured, amorous red From lips not his, and all that strange hair shed Across the tissued pillows, fold on fold, Innumerable, incomparable, all gold, To fire men's eyes with wonder, and with love Men's hearts; so shone its flowering crown above The brows enwound with that imperial wreath, And framed with fragrant radiance round the face beneath. And the king marvelled, seeing with sudden start Her very glory, and said out of his heart; “What have I done of good for God to bless That all this he should give me, tress on tress, All this great wealth and wondrous? Was it this That in mine arms I had all night to kiss, And mix with me this beauty? this that seems More fair than heaven doth in some tired saint's dreams, Being part of that same heaven? yea, more, for he, Though loved of God so, yet but seems to see, But to me sinful such great grace is given That in mine hands I hold this part of heaven, Not to mine eyes lent merely. Doth God make Such things so godlike for man's mortal sake? Have I not sinned, that in this fleshly life Have made of her a mere man's very wife?” So the king mused and murmured; and she heard The faint sound trembling of each breathless word, And laughed into the covering of her hair. And many a day for many a month as fair Slid over them like music; and as bright Burned with love's offerings many a secret night. And many a dawn to many a fiery noon Blew prelude, when the horn's heart-kindling tune Lit the live woods with sovereign sound of mirth Before the mightiest huntsman hailed on earth Lord of its lordliest pleasure, where he rode Hard by her rein whose peerless presence glowed Not as that white queen's of the virgin hunt Once, whose crown-crescent braves the night-wind's brunt, But with the sun for frontlet of a queenlier front. For where the flashing of her face was turned As lightning was the fiery light that burned From eyes and brows enkindled more with speed And rapture of the rushing of her steed Than once with only beauty; and her mouth Was as a rose athirst that pants for drouth Even while it laughs for pleasure of desire, And all her heart was as a leaping fire. Yet once more joy they took of woodland ways Than came of all those flushed and fiery days When the loud air was mad with life and sound, Through many a dense green mile, of horn and hound Before the king's hunt going along the wind, And ere the timely leaves were changed or thinned, Even in mid maze of summer. For the knight Forth was once ridden toward some frontier fight Against the lewd folk of the Christless lands That warred with wild and intermittent hands Against the king's north border; and there came A knight unchristened yet of unknown name, Swart Palamede, upon a secret quest, To high Tintagel, and abode as guest In likeness of a minstrel with the king. Nor was there man could sound so sweet a string, Save Tristram only, of all held best on earth. And one loud eve, being full of wine and mirth, Ere sunset left the walls and waters dark, To that strange minstrel strongly swore King Mark, By all that makes a knight's faith firm and strong, That he for guerdon of his harp and song Might crave and have his liking. Straight there came Up the swart cheek a flash of swarthier flame, And the deep eyes fulfilled of glittering night Laughed out in lightnings of triumphant light As the grim harper spake: “O king, I crave No gift of man that king may give to slave, But this thy crowned queen only, this thy wife, Whom yet unseen I loved, and set my life On this poor chance to compass, even as here, Being fairer famed than all save Guenevere.” Then as the noise of seaward storm that mocks With roaring laughter from reverberate rocks The cry from ships near shipwreck, harsh and high Rose all the wrath and wonder in one cry Through all the long roof's hollow depth and length That hearts of strong men kindled in their strength May speak in laughter lion-like, and cease, Being wearied: only two men held their peace And each glared hard on other: but King Mark Spake first of these: “Man, though thy craft be dark And thy mind evil that begat this thing, Yet stands the word once plighted of a king Fast: and albeit less evil it were for me To give my life up than my wife, or be A landless man crowned only with a curse, Yet this in God's and all men's sight were worse, To live soul-shamed, a man of broken troth, Abhorred of men as I abhor mine oath Which yet I may forswear not.” And he bowed His head, and wept: and all men wept aloud, Save one, that heard him weeping: but the queen Wept not: and statelier yet than eyes had seen That ever looked upon her queenly state She rose, and in her eyes her heart was great And full of wrath seen manifest and scorn More strong than anguish to go thence forlorn Of all men's comfort and her natural right. And they went forth into the dawn of night. Long by wild ways and clouded light they rode, Silent; and fear less keen at heart abode With Iseult than with Palamede: for awe Constrained him, and the might of love's high law, That can make lewd men loyal; and his heart Yearned on her, if perchance with amorous art And soothfast skill of very love he might For courtesy find favour in her sight And comfort of her mercies: for he wist More grace might come of that sweet mouth unkissed Than joy for violence done it, that should make His name abhorred for shame's disloyal sake. And in the stormy starlight clouds were thinned And thickened by short gusts of changing wind That panted like a sick man's fitful breath: And like a moan of lions hurt to death Came the sea's hollow noise along the night. But ere its gloom from aught but foam had light They halted, being aweary: and the knight As reverently forbore her where she lay As one that watched his sister's sleep till day. Nor durst he kiss or touch her hand or hair For love and shamefast pity, seeing how fair She slept, and fenceless from the fitful air. And shame at heart stung nigh to death desire, But grief at heart burned in him like a fire For hers and his own sorrowing sake, that had Such grace for guerdon as makes glad men sad, To have their will and want it. And the day Sprang: and afar along the wild waste way They heard the pulse and press of hurrying horse-hoofs play: And like the rushing of a ravenous flame Whose wings make tempest of the darkness, came Upon them headlong as in thunder borne Forth of the darkness of the labouring morn Tristram: and up forthright upon his steed Leapt, as one blithe of battle, Palamede, And mightily with shock of horse and man They lashed together: and fair that fight began As fair came up that sunrise: to and fro, With knees nigh staggered and stout heads bent low From each quick shock of spears on either side, Reeled the strong steeds heavily, haggard-eyed And heartened high with passion of their pride As sheer the stout spears shocked again, and flew Sharp-splintering: then, his sword as each knight drew, They flashed and foined full royally, so long That but to see so fair a strife and strong A man might well have given out of his life One year's void space forlorn of love or strife. As when a bright north-easter, great of heart, Scattering the strengths of squadrons, hurls apart Ship from ship labouring violently, in such toil As earns but ruin—with even so strong recoil Back were the steeds hurled from the spear-shock, fain And foiled of triumph: then with tightened rein And stroke of spur, inveterate, either knight Bore in again upon his foe with might, Heart-hungry for the hot-mouthed feast of fight And all athirst of mastery: but full soon The jarring notes of that tempestuous tune Fell, and its mighty music made of hands Contending, clamorous through the loud waste lands, Broke at once off; and shattered from his steed Fell, as a mainmast ruining, Palamede, Stunned: and those lovers left him where he lay, And lightly through green lawns they rode away. There was a bower beyond man's eye more fair Than ever summer dews and sunniest air Fed full with rest and radiance till the boughs Had wrought a roof as for a holier house Than aught save love might breathe in; fairer far Than keeps the sweet light back of moon and star From high kings' chambers: there might love and sleep Divide for joy the darkling hours, and keep With amorous alternation of sweet strife The soft and secret ways of death and life Made smooth for pleasure's feet to rest and run Even from the moondawn to the kindling sun, Made bright for passion's feet to run and rest Between the midnight's and the morning's breast, Where hardly though her happy head lie down It may forget the hour that wove its crown; Where hardly though her joyous limbs be laid They may forget the mirth that midnight made. And thither, ere sweet night had slain sweet day, Iseult and Tristram took their wandering way, And rested, and refreshed their hearts with cheer In hunters' fashion of the woods; and here More sweet it seemed, while this might be, to dwell And take of all world's weariness farewell Than reign of all world's lordship queen and king. Nor here would time for three moons' changes bring Sorrow nor thought of sorrow; but sweet earth Fostered them like her babes of eldest birth, Reared warm in pathless woods and cherished well. And the sun sprang above the sea and fell, And the stars rose and sank upon the sea; And outlaw-like, in forest wise and free, The rising and the setting of their lights Found those twain dwelling all those days and nights. And under change of sun and star and moon Flourished and fell the chaplets woven of June, And fair through fervours of the deepening sky Panted and passed the hours that lit July, And each day blessed them out of heaven above, And each night crowned them with the crown of love. Nor till the might of August overhead Weighed on the world was yet one roseleaf shed Of all their joy's warm coronal, nor aught Touched them in passing ever with a thought That ever this might end on any day Or any night not love them where they lay; But like a babbling tale of barren breath Seemed all report and rumour held of death, And a false bruit the legend tear-impearled That such a thing as change was in the world. And each bright song upon his lips that came, Mocking the powers of change and death by name, Blasphemed their bitter godhead, and defied Time, though clothed round with ruin as kings with pride, To blot the glad life out of love: and she Drank lightly deep of his philosophy In that warm wine of amorous words which is Sweet with all truths of all philosophies. For well he wist all subtle ways of song, And in his soul the secret eye was strong That burns in meditation, till bright words Break flamelike forth as notes from fledgeling birds That feel the soul speak through them of the spring. So fared they night and day as queen and king Crowned of a kingdom wide as day and night. Nor ever cloudlet swept or swam in sight Across the darkling depths of their delight Whose stars no skill might number, nor man's art Sound the deep stories of its heavenly heart. Till, even for wonder that such life should live, Desires and dreams of what death's self might give Would touch with tears and laughter and wild speech The lips and eyes of passion, fain to reach, Beyond all bourne of time or trembling sense, The verge of love's last possible eminence. Out of the heaven that storm nor shadow mars, Deep from the starry depth beyond the stars, A yearning ardour without scope or name Fell on them, and the bright night's breath of flame Shot fire into their kisses; and like fire The lit dews lightened on the leaves, as higher Night's heart beat on toward midnight. Far and fain Somewhiles the soft rush of rejoicing rain Solaced the darkness, and from steep to steep Of heaven they saw the sweet sheet lightning leap And laugh its heart out in a thousand smiles, When the clear sea for miles on glimmering miles Burned as though dawn were strewn abroad astray, Or, showering out of heaven, all heaven's array Had paven instead the waters: fain and far Somewhiles the burning love of star for star Spake words that love might wellnigh seem to hear In such deep hours as turn delight to fear Sweet as delight's self ever. So they lay Tranced once, nor watched along the fiery bay The shine of summer darkness palpitate and play. She had nor sight nor voice; her swooning eyes Knew not if night or light were in the skies; Across her beauty sheer the moondawn shed Its light as on a thing as white and dead; Only with stress of soft fierce hands she prest Between the throbbing blossoms of her breast His ardent face, and through his hair her breath Went quivering as when life is hard on death; And with strong trembling fingers she strained fast His head into her bosom; till at last, Satiate with sweetness of that burning bed, His eyes afire with tears, he raised his head And laughed into her lips; and all his heart Filled hers; then face from face fell, and apart Each hung on each with panting lips, and felt Sense into sense and spirit in spirit melt. “Hast thou no sword? I would not live till day; O love, this night and we must pass away, It must die soon, and let not us die late.” “Take then my sword and slay me; nay, but wait Till day be risen; what, wouldst thou think to die Before the light take hold upon the sky?” “Yea, love; for how shall we have twice, being twain, This very night of love's most rapturous reign? Live thou and have thy day, and year by year Be great, but what shall I be? Slay me here; Let me die not when love lies dead, but now Strike through my heart: nay, sweet, what heart hast thou? Is it so much I ask thee, and spend my breath In asking? nay, thou knowest it is but death. Hadst thou true heart to love me, thou wouldst give This: but for hate's sake thou wilt let me live.” Here he caught up her lips with his, and made The wild prayer silent in her heart that prayed, And strained her to him till all her faint breath sank And her bright light limbs palpitated and shrank And rose and fluctuated as flowers in rain That bends them and they tremble and rise again And heave and straighten and quiver all through with bliss And turn afresh their mouths up for a kiss, Amorous, athirst of that sweet influent love; So, hungering towards his hovering lips above, Her red-rose mouth yearned silent, and her eyes Closed, and flashed after, as through June's darkest skies The divine heartbeats of the deep live light Make open and shut the gates of the outer night. Long lay they still, subdued with love, nor knew If cloud or light changed colour as it grew, If star or moon beheld them; if above The heaven of night waxed fiery with their love, Or earth beneath were moved at heart and root To burn as they, to burn and bring forth fruit Unseasonable for love's sake; if tall trees Bowed, and close flowers yearned open, and the breeze Failed and fell silent as a flame that fails: And all that hour unheard the nightingales Clamoured, and all the woodland soul was stirred, And depth and height were one great song unheard, As though the world caught music and took fire From the instant heart alone of their desire. So sped their night of nights between them: so, For all fears past and shadows, shine and snow, That one pure hour all-golden where they lay Made their life perfect and their darkness day. And warmer waved its harvest yet to reap, Till in the lovely fight of love and sleep At length had sleep the mastery; and the dark Was lit with soft live gleams they might not mark, Fleet butterflies, each like a dead flower's ghost, White, blue, and sere leaf-coloured; but the most White as the sparkle of snow-flowers in the sun Ere with his breath they lie at noon undone Whose kiss devours their tender beauty, and leaves But raindrops on the grass and sere thin leaves That were engraven with traceries of the snow Flowerwise ere any flower of earth's would blow; So swift they sprang and sank, so sweet and light They swam the deep dim breathless air of night. Now on her rose-white amorous breast half bare, Now on her slumberous love-dishevelled hair, The white wings lit and vanished, and afresh Lit soft as snow lights on her snow-soft flesh, On hand or throat or shoulder; and she stirred Sleeping, and spake some tremulous bright word, And laughed upon some dream too sweet for truth, Yet not so sweet as very love and youth That there had charmed her eyes to sleep at last. Nor woke they till the perfect night was past, And the soft sea thrilled with blind hope of light. But ere the dusk had well the sun in sight He turned and kissed her eyes awake and said, Seeing earth and water neither quick nor dead And twilight hungering toward the day to be, “As the dawn loves the sunlight I love thee.” And even as rays with cloudlets in the skies Confused in brief love's bright contentious wise, Sleep strove with sense rekindling in her eyes; And as the flush of birth scarce overcame The pale pure pearl of unborn light with flame Soft as may touch the rose's heart with shame To break not all reluctant out of bud, Stole up her sleeping cheek her waking blood; And with the lovely laugh of love that takes The whole soul prisoner ere the whole sense wakes, Her lips for love's sake bade love's will be done. And all the sea lay subject to the sun. III TRISTRAM IN BRITTANY “‘As the dawn loves the sunlight I love thee;’ As men that shall be swallowed of the sea Love the sea's lovely beauty; as the night That wanes before it loves the young sweet light, And dies of loving; as the worn-out noon Loves twilight, and as twilight loves the moon That on its grave a silver seal shall set— We have loved and slain each other, and love yet. Slain; for we live not surely, being in twain: In her I lived, and in me she is slain, Who loved me that I brought her to her doom, Who loved her that her love might be my tomb. As all the streams on earth and all fresh springs And sweetest waters, every brook that sings, Each fountain where the young year dips its wings First, and the first-fledged branches of it wave, Even with one heart's love seek one bitter grave. From hills that first see bared the morning's breast And heights the sun last yearns to from the west, All tend but toward the sea, all born most high Strive downward, passing all things joyous by, Seek to it and cast their lives in it and die. So strive all lives for death which all lives win; So sought her soul to my soul, and therein Was poured and perished: O my love, and mine Sought to thee and died of thee and died as thine. As the dawn loves the sunlight that must cease Ere dawn again may rise and pass in peace; Must die that she being dead may live again, To be by his new rising nearly slain. So rolls the great wheel of the great world round, And no change in it and no fault is found, And no true life of perdurable breath, And surely no irrevocable death. Day after day night comes that day may break, And day comes back for night's reiterate sake. Each into each dies, each of each is born: Day past is night, shall night past not be morn? Out of this moonless and faint-hearted night That love yet lives in, shall there not be light? Light strong as love, that love may live in yet? Alas, but how shall foolish hope forget How all these loving things that kill and die Meet not but for a breath's space and pass by? Night is kissed once of dawn and dies, and day But touches twilight and is rapt away. So may my love and her love meet once more, And meeting be divided as of yore. Yea, surely as the day-star loves the sun And when he hath risen is utterly undone, So is my love of her and hers of me— And its most sweetness bitter as the sea. Would God yet dawn might see the sun and die!” Three years had looked on earth and passed it by Since Tristram looked on Iseult, when he stood So communing with dreams of evil and good, And let all sad thoughts through his spirit sweep As leaves through air or tears through eyes that weep Or snowflakes through dark weather: and his soul, That had seen all those sightless seasons roll One after one, wave over weary wave, Was in him as a corpse is in its grave. Yet, for his heart was mighty, and his might Through all the world as a great sound and light, The mood was rare upon him; save that here In the low sundawn of the lightening year With all last year's toil and its triumph done He could not choose but yearn for that set sun Which at this season saw the firstborn kiss That made his lady's mouth one fire with his. Yet his great heart being greater than his grief Kept all the summer of his strength in leaf And all the rose of his sweet spirit in flower; Still his soul fed upon the sovereign hour That had been or that should be; and once more He looked through drifted sea and drifting shore That crumbled in the wave-breach, and again Spake sad and deep within himself: “What pain Should make a man's soul wholly break and die, Sapped as weak sand by water? How shall I Be less than all less things are that endure And strive and yield when time is? Nay, full sure All these and we are parts of one same end; And if through fire or water we twain tend To that sure life where both must be made one, If one we be, what matter? Thou, O sun, The face of God, if God thou be not—nay, What but God should I think thee, what should say, Seeing thee rerisen, but very God?—should I, I fool, rebuke thee sovereign in thy sky, The clouds dead round thee and the air alive, The winds that lighten and the waves that strive Toward this shore as to that beneath thy breath, Because in me my thoughts bear all towards death? O sun, that when we are dead wilt rise as bright, Air deepening up toward heaven, and nameless light, And heaven immeasurable, and faint clouds blown Between us and the lowest aerial zone And each least skirt of their imperial state— Forgive us that we held ourselves so great! What should I do to curse you? I indeed Am a thing meaner than this least wild weed That my foot bruises and I know not—yet Would not be mean enough for worms to fret Before their time and mine was. “Ah, and ye Light washing weeds, blind waifs of dull blind sea, Do ye so thirst and hunger and aspire, Are ye so moved with such long strong desire In the ebb and flow of your sad life, and strive Still toward some end ye shall not see alive— But at high noon ye know it by light and heat Some half-hour, till ye feel the fresh tide beat Up round you, and at night's most bitter noon The ripples leave you naked to the moon? And this dim dusty heather that I tread, These half-born blossoms, born at once and dead, Sere brown as funeral cloths, and purple as pall, What if some life and grief be in them all? “Ay, what of these? but, O strong sun! O sea! I bid not you, divine things! comfort me, I stand not up to match you in your sight— Who hath said ye have mercy toward us, ye who have might? And though ye had mercy, I think I would not pray That ye should change your counsel or your way To make our life less bitter: if such power Be given the stars on one deciduous hour, And such might be in planets to destroy Grief and rebuild, and break and build up joy, What man would stretch forth hand on them to make Fate mutable, God foolish, for his sake? For if in life or death be aught of trust, And if some unseen just God or unjust Put soul into the body of natural things And in time's pauseless feet and worldwide wings Some spirit of impulse and some sense of will That steers them through the seas of good and ill To some incognizable and actual end, Be it just or unjust, foe to man or friend, How should we make the stable spirit to swerve, How teach the strong soul of the world to serve, The imperious will in time and sense in space That gives man life turn back to give man place— The conscious law lose conscience of its way, The rule and reason fail from night and day, The streams flow back toward whence the springs began, That less of thirst might sear the lips of man? Let that which is be, and sure strengths stand sure, And evil or good and death or life endure, Not alterable and rootless, but indeed A very stem born of a very seed That brings forth fruit in season: how should this Die that was sown, and that not be which is, And the old fruit change that came of the ancient root, And he that planted bid it not bear fruit, And he that watered smite his vine with drouth Because its grapes are bitter in our mouth, And he that kindled quench the sun with night Because its beams are fire against our sight, And he that tuned untune the sounding spheres Because their song is thunder in our ears? How should the skies change and the stars, and time Break the large concord of the years that chime, Answering, as wave to wave beneath the moon That draws them shoreward, mar the whole tide's tune For the instant foam's sake on one turning wave— For man's sake that is grass upon a grave? How should the law that knows not soon or late, For whom no time nor space is—how should fate, That is not good nor evil, wise nor mad, Nor just nor unjust, neither glad nor sad— How should the one thing that hath being, the one That moves not as the stars move or the sun Or any shadow or shape that lives or dies In likeness of dead earth or living skies, But its own darkness and its proper light Clothe it with other names than day or night, And its own soul of strength and spirit of breath Feed it with other powers than life or death— How should it turn from its great way to give Man that must die a clearer space to live? Why should the waters of the sea be cleft, The hills be molten to his right and left, That he from deep to deep might pass dry-shod, Or look between the viewless heights on God? Hath he such eyes as, when the shadows flee, The sun looks out with to salute the sea? Is his hand bounteous as the morning's hand? Or where the night stands hath he feet to stand? Will the storm cry not when he bids it cease? Is it his voice that saith to the east wind, Peace? Is his breath mightier than the west wind's breath? Doth his heart know the things of life and death? Can his face bring forth sunshine and give rain, Or his weak will that dies and lives again Make one thing certain or bind one thing fast, That as he willed it shall be at the last? How should the storms of heaven and kindled lights And all the depths of things and topless heights And air and earth and fire and water change Their likeness, and the natural world grow strange, And all the limits of their life undone Lose count of time and conscience of the sun, And that fall under which was fixed above, That man might have a larger hour for love?” So musing with close lips and lifted eyes That smiled with self-contempt to live so wise, With silent heart so hungry now so long, So late grown clear, so miserably made strong, About the wolds a banished man he went, The brown wolds bare and sad as banishment, By wastes of fruitless flowerage, and grey downs That felt the sea-wind shake their wild-flower crowns As though fierce hands would pluck from some grey head The spoils of majesty despised and dead, And fill with crying and comfortless strange sound Their hollow sides and heights of herbless ground. Yet as he went fresh courage on him came, Till dawn rose too within him as a flame; The heart of the ancient hills and his were one; The winds took counsel with him, and the sun Spake comfort; in his ears the shout of birds Was as the sound of clear sweet-spirited words, The noise of streams as laughter from above Of the old wild lands, and as a cry of love Spring's trumpet-blast blown over moor and lea: The skies were red as love is, and the sea Was as the floor of heaven for love to tread. So went he as with light about his head, And in the joyous travail of the year Grew April-hearted; since nor grief nor fear Can master so a young man's blood so long That it shall move not to the mounting song Of that sweet hour when earth replumes her wings And with fair face and heart set heavenward sings As an awakened angel unaware That feels his sleep fall from him, and his hair By some new breath of wind and music stirred, Till like the sole song of one heavenly bird Sounds all the singing of the host of heaven, And all the glories of the sovereign Seven Are as one face of one incorporate light. And as that host of singers in God's sight Might draw toward one that slumbered, and arouse The lips requickened and rekindling brows, So seemed the earthly host of all things born In sight of spring and eyeshot of the morn, All births of land or waifs of wind and sea, To draw toward him that sorrowed, and set free From presage and remembrance of all pains The life that leapt and lightened in his veins. So with no sense abashed nor sunless look, But with exalted eyes and heart, he took His part of sun or storm-wind, and was glad, For all things lost, of these good things he had. And the spring loved him surely, being from birth One made out of the better part of earth, A man born as at sunrise; one that saw Not without reverence and sweet sense of awe But wholly without fear of fitful breath The face of life watched by the face of death; And living took his fill of rest and strife, Of love and change, and fruit and seed of life, And when his time to live in light was done With unbent head would pass out of the sun: A spirit as morning, fair and clear and strong, Whose thought and work were as one harp and song Heard through the world as in a strange king's hall Some great guest's voice that sings of festival. So seemed all things to love him, and his heart In all their joy of life to take such part, That with the live earth and the living sea He was as one that communed mutually With naked heart to heart of friend to friend: And the star deepening at the sunset's end, And the moon fallen before the gate of day As one sore wearied with vain length of way, And the winds wandering, and the streams and skies, As faces of his fellows in his eyes. Nor lacked there love where he was evermore Of man and woman, friend of sea or shore, Not measurable with weight of graven gold, Free as the sun's gift of the world to hold Given each day back to man's reconquering sight That loses but its lordship for a night. And now that after many a season spent In barren ways and works of banishment, Toil of strange fights and many a fruitless field, Ventures of quest and vigils under shield, He came back to the strait of sundering sea That parts green Cornwall from grey Brittany, Where dwelt the high king's daughter of the lands, Iseult, named alway from her fair white hands, She looked on him and loved him; but being young Made shamefastness a seal upon her tongue, And on her heart, that none might hear its cry, Set the sweet signet of humility. Yet when he came a stranger in her sight, A banished man and weary, no such knight As when the Swallow dipped her bows in foam Steered singing that imperial Iseult home, This maiden with her sinless sixteen years Full of sweet thoughts and hopes that played at fears Cast her eyes on him but in courteous wise, And lo, the man's face burned upon her eyes As though she had turned them on the naked sun: And through her limbs she felt sweet passion run As fire that flowed down from her face, and beat Soft through stirred veins on even to her hands and feet As all her body were one heart on flame, Athrob with love and wonder and sweet shame. And when he spake there sounded in her ears As 'twere a song out of the graves of years Heard, and again forgotten, and again Remembered with a rapturous pulse of pain. But as the maiden mountain snow sublime Takes the first sense of April's trembling time Soft on a brow that burns not though it blush To feel the sunrise hardly half aflush, So took her soul the sense of change, nor thought That more than maiden love was more than nought. Her eyes went hardly after him, her cheek Grew scarce a goodlier flower to hear him speak, Her bright mouth no more trembled than a rose May for the least wind's breathless sake that blows Too soft to sue save for a sister's kiss, And if she sighed in sleep she knew not this. Yet in her heart hovered the thoughts of things Past, that with lighter or with heavier wings Beat round about her memory, till it burned With grief that brightened and with hope that yearned, Seeing him so great and sad, nor knowing what fate Had bowed and crowned a head so sad and great. Nor might she guess but little, first or last, Though all her heart so hung upon his past, Of what so bowed him for what sorrow's sake: For scarce of aught at any time he spake That from his own land oversea had sent His lordly life to barren banishment. Yet still or soft or keen remembrance clung Close round her of the least word from his tongue That fell by chance of courtesy, to greet With grace of tender thanks her pity, sweet As running streams to men's way-wearied feet. And when between strange words her name would fall, Suddenly straightway to that lure's recall Back would his heart bound as the falconer's bird, And tremble and bow down before the word. ‘Iseult”—and all the cloudlike world grew flame, And all his heart flashed lightning at her name; “Iseult”—and all the wan waste weary skies Shone as his queen's own love-enkindled eyes. And seeing the bright blood in his face leap up As red wine mantling in a royal cup To hear the sudden sweetness of the sound Ring, but ere well his heart had time to bound His cheek would change, and grief bow down his head, “Haply,” the girl's heart, though she spake not, said, “This name of mine was worn of one long dead, Some sister that he loved:” and therewithal Would pity bring her heart more deep in thrall. But once, when winds about the world made mirth, And March held revel hard on April's birth Till air and sea were jubilant as earth, Delight and doubt in sense and soul began, And yearning of the maiden toward the man, Harping on high before her: for his word Was fire that kindled in her heart that heard, And alway through the rhymes reverberate came The virginal soft burden of her name. And ere the full song failed upon her ear Joy strove within her till it cast out fear, And all her heart was as his harp, and rang Swift music, made of hope whose birthnote sprang Bright in the blood that kindled as he sang. “Stars know not how we call them, nor may flowers Know by what happy name the hovering hours Baptize their new-born heads with dew and flame: And Love, adored of all time as of ours, Iseult, knew nought for ages of his name. “With many tongues men called on him, but he Wist not which word of all might worthiest be To sound for ever in his ear the same, Till heart of man might hear and soul might see, Iseult, the radiance ringing from thy name. “By many names men called him, as the night By many a name calls many a starry light, Her several sovereigns of dividual fame; But day by one name only calls aright, Iseult, the sun that bids men praise his name. “In many a name of man his name soared high And song shone round it soaring, till the sky Rang rapture, and the world's fast-founded frame Trembled with sense of triumph, even as I, Iseult, with sense of worship at thy name. “In many a name of woman smiled his power Incarnate, as all summer in a flower, Till winter bring forgetfulness or shame: But thine, the keystone of his topless tower, Iseult, is one with Love's own lordliest name. “Iseult my love, Iseult my queen twice crowned, In thee my death, in thee my life lies bound: Names are there yet that all men's hearts acclaim, But Love's own heart rings answer to the sound, Iseult, that bids it bow before thy name.” There ceased his voice yearning upon the word, Struck with strong passion dumb: but she that heard Quailed to the heart, and trembled ere her eyes Durst let the loving light within them rise, And yearn on his for answer: yet at last, Albeit not all her fear was overpast, Hope, kindling even the frost of fear apace With sweet fleet bloom and breath of gradual grace, Flushed in the changing roses of her face. And ere the strife took truce of white with red, Or joy for soft shame's sake durst lift up head, Something she would and would not fain have said, And wist not what the fluttering word would be, But rose and reached forth to him her hand: and he, Heart-stricken, bowed his head and dropped his knee, And on her fragrant hand his lips were fire; And their two hearts were as one trembling lyre Touched by the keen wind's kiss with brief desire And music shuddering at its own delight. So dawned the moonrise of their marriage night. IV THE MAIDEN MARRIAGE Spring watched her last moon burn and fade with May While the days deepened toward a bridal day. And on her snowbright hand the ring was set While in the maiden's ear the song's word yet Hovered, that hailed as love's own queen by name Iseult: and in her heart the word was flame; A pulse of light, a breath of tender fire, Too dear for doubt, too driftless for desire. Between her father's hand and brother's led From hall to shrine, from shrine to marriage-bed, She saw not how by hap at home-coming Fell from her new lord's hand a royal ring, Whereon he looked, and felt the pulse astart Speak passion in his faith-forsaken heart. For this was given him of the hand wherein That heart's pledge lay for ever: so the sin That should be done if truly he should take This maid to wife for strange love's faithless sake Struck all his mounting spirit abashed, and fear Fell cold for shame's sake on his changing cheer. Yea, shame's own fire that burned upon his brow To bear the brand there of a broken vow Was frozen again for very fear thereof That wrung his heart with keener pangs than love. And all things rose upon him, all things past Ere last they parted, cloven in twain at last, Iseult from Tristram, Tristram from the queen; And how men found them in the wild woods green Sleeping, but sundered by the sword between, Dividing breast from amorous breast a span, But scarce in heart the woman from the man As far as hope from joy or sleep from truth, And Mark that saw them held for sacred sooth These were no fleshly lovers, by that sign That severed them, still slumbering; so divine He deemed it: how at waking they beheld The king's folk round the king, and uncompelled Were fain to follow and fare among them home Back to the towers washed round with rolling foam And storied halls wherethrough sea-music rang: And how report thereafter swelled and sprang, A full-mouthed serpent, hissing in men's ears Word of their loves: and one of all his peers That most he trusted, being his kinsman born, A man base-moulded for the stamp of scorn, Whose heart with hate was keen and cold and dark, Gave note by midnight whisper to King Mark Where he might take them sleeping; how ere day Had seen the grim next morning all away Fast bound they brought him down a weary way With forty knights about him, and their chief That traitor who for trust had given him grief, To the old hoar chapel, like a strait stone tomb Sheer on the sea-rocks, there to take his doom: How, seeing he needs must die, he bade them yet Bethink them if they durst for shame forget What deeds for Cornwall had he done, and wrought For all their sake what rescue, when he fought Against the fierce foul Irish foe that came To take of them for tribute in their shame Three hundred heads of children; whom in fight His hand redeeming slew Moraunt the knight That none durst lift his eyes against, not one Had heart but he, who now had help of none, To take the battle; whence great shame it were To knighthood, yea, foul shame on all men there, To see him die so shamefully: nor durst One man look up, nor one make answer first, Save even the very traitor, who defied And would have slain him naked in his pride, But he, that saw the sword plucked forth to slay, Looked on his hands, and wrenched their bonds away, Haling those twain that he went bound between Suddenly to him, and kindling in his mien Shone lion-fashion forth with eyes alight, And lion-wise leapt on that kinsman knight And wrung forth of his felon hands with might The sword that should have slain him weaponless, And smote him sheer down: then came all the press All raging in upon him; but he wrought So well for his deliverance as they fought That ten strong knights rejoicingly he slew, And took no wound, nor wearied: then the crew Waxed greater, and their cry on him; but he Had won the chapel now above the sea That chafed right under: then the heart in him Sprang, seeing the low cliff clear to leap, and swim Right out by the old blithe way the sea-mew takes Across the bounding billow-belt that breaks For ever, but the loud bright chain it makes To bind the bridal bosom of the land Time shall unlink not ever, till his hand Fall by its own last blow dead: thence again Might he win forth into the green great main Far on beyond, and there yield up his breath At least, with God's will, by no shameful death, Or haply save himself, and come anew Some long day later, ere sweet life were through. And as the sea-gull hovers high, and turns With eyes wherein the keen heart glittering yearns Down toward the sweet green sea whereon the broad noon burns, And suddenly, soul-stricken with delight, Drops, and the glad wave gladdens, and the light Sees wing and wave confuse their fluttering white, So Tristram one brief breathing-space apart Hung, and gazed down; then with exulting heart Plunged: and the fleet foam round a joyous head Flashed, that shot under, and ere a shaft had sped Rose again radiant, a rejoicing star, And high along the water-ways afar Triumphed: and all they deemed he needs must die; But Gouvernayle his squire, that watched hard by, Sought where perchance a man might win ashore, Striving, with strong limbs labouring long and sore, And there abode an hour: till as from fight Crowned with hard conquest won by mastering might, Hardly, but happier for the imperious toil, Swam the knight in forth of the close waves' coil, Sea-satiate, bruised with buffets of the brine, Laughing, and flushed as one afire with wine: All this came hard upon him in a breath; And how he marvelled in his heart that death Should be no bitterer than it seemed to be There, in the strenuous impulse of the sea Borne as to battle deathward: and at last How all his after seasons overpast Had brought him darkling to this dark sweet hour, Where his foot faltered nigh the bridal bower. And harder seemed the passage now to pass, Though smoother-seeming than the still sea's glass, More fit for very manhood's heart to fear, Than all straits past of peril. Hardly here Might aught of all things hearten him save one, Faith: and as men's eyes quail before the sun So quailed his heart before the star whose light Put out the torches of his bridal night, So quailed and shrank with sense of faith's keen star That burned as fire beheld by night afar Deep in the darkness of his dreams; for all The bride-house now seemed hung with heavier pall Than clothes the house of mourning. Yet at last, Soul-sick with trembling at the heart, he passed Into the sweet light of the maiden bower Where lay the lonely lily-featured flower That, lying within his hand to gather, yet Might not be gathered of it. Fierce regret And bitter loyalty strove hard at strife With amorous pity toward the tender wife That wife indeed might never be, to wear The very crown of wedlock; never bear Children, to watch and worship her white hair When time should change, with hand more soft than snow, The fashion of its glory; never know The loveliness of laughing love that lives On little lips of children: all that gives Glory and grace and reverence and delight To wedded woman by her bridal right, All praise and pride that flowers too fair to fall, Love that should give had stripped her of them all And left her bare for ever. So his thought Consumed him, as a fire within that wrought Visibly, ravening till its wrath were spent: So pale he stood, so bowed and passion-rent, Before the blithe-faced bride-folk, ere he went Within the chamber, heavy-eyed: and there Gleamed the white hands and glowed the glimmering hair That might but move his memory more of one more fair, More fair than all this beauty: but in sooth So fair she too shone in her flower of youth That scarcely might man's heart hold fast its truth, Though strong, who gazed upon her: for her eyes Were emerald-soft as evening-coloured skies, And a smile in them like the light therein Slept, or shone out in joy that knew not sin, Clear as a child's own laughter: and her mouth, Albeit no rose full-hearted from the south And passion-coloured for the perfect kiss That signs the soul for love and stamps it his, Was soft and bright as any bud new-blown; And through her cheek the gentler lifebloom shone Of mild wild roses nigh the northward sea. So in her bride-bed lay the bride: and he Drew nigh, and all the high sad heart in him Yearned on her, seeing the twilight meek and dim Through all the soft alcove tremblingly lit With hovering silver, as a heart in it Beating, that burned from one deep lamp above, Fainter than fire of torches, as the love Within him fainter than a bridegroom's fire, No marriage-torch red with the heart's desire, But silver-soft, a flameless light that glowed Starlike along night's dark and starry road Wherein his soul was traveller. And he sighed, Seeing, and with eyes set sadly toward his bride Laid him down by her, and spake not: but within His heart spake, saying how sore should be the sin To break toward her, that of all womankind Was faithfullest, faith plighted, or unbind The bond first linked between them when they drank The love-draught: and his quick blood sprang and sank, Remembering in the pulse of all his veins That red swift rapture, all its fiery pains And all its fierier pleasures: and he spake Aloud, one burning word for love's keen sake— “Iseult;” and full of love and lovelier fear A virgin voice gave answer—“I am here.” And a pang rent his heart at root: but still, For spirit and flesh were vassals to his will, Strong faith held mastery on them: and the breath Felt on his face did not his will to death, Nor glance nor lute-like voice nor flower-soft touch Might so prevail upon it overmuch That constancy might less prevail than they, For all he looked and loved her as she lay Smiling; and soft as bird alights on bough He kissed her maiden mouth and blameless brow, Once, and again his heart within him sighed: But all his young blood's yearning toward his bride, How hard soe'er it held his life awake For passion, and sweet nature's unforbidden sake, And will that strove unwillingly with will it might not break, Fell silent as a wind abashed, whose breath Dies out of heaven, suddenly done to death, When in between them on the dumb dusk air Floated the bright shade of a face more fair Than hers that hard beside him shrank and smiled And wist of all no more than might a child. So had she all her heart's will, all she would, For love's sake that sufficed her, glad and good, All night safe sleeping in her maidenhood. V ISEULT AT TINTAGEL But that same night in Cornwall oversea Couched at Queen Iseult's hand, against her knee, With keen kind eyes that read her whole heart's pain Fast at wide watch lay Tristram's hound Hodain, The goodliest and the mightiest born on earth, That many a forest day of fiery mirth Had plied his craft before them; and the queen Cherished him, even for those dim years between, More than of old in those bright months far flown When ere a blast of Tristram's horn was blown Each morning as the woods rekindled, ere Day gat full empire of the glimmering air, Delight of dawn would quicken him, and fire Spring and pant in his breath with bright desire To be among the dewy ways on quest: But now perforce at restless-hearted rest He chafed through days more barren than the sand, Soothed hardly but soothed only with her hand, Though fain to fawn thereon and follow, still With all his heart and all his loving will Desiring one divided from his sight, For whose lost sake dawn was as dawn of night And noon as night's noon in his eyes was dark. But in the halls far under sat King Mark, Feasting, and full of cheer, with heart uplift, As on the night that harper gat his gift: And music revelled on the fitful air, And songs came floated up the festal stair, And muffled roar of wassail, where the king Took heart from wine-cups and the quiring string Till all his cold thin veins rejoiced and ran Strong as with lifeblood of a kinglier man. But the queen shut from sound her wearied ears, Shut her sad eyes from sense of aught save tears, And wrung her hair with soft fierce hands, and prayed: “O God, God born of woman, of a maid, Christ, once in flesh of thine own fashion clad; O very love, so glad in heaven and sad On earth for earth's sake alway; since thou art Pure only, I only impure of spirit and heart, Since thou for sin's sake and the bitter doom Didst as a veil put on a virgin's womb, I that am none, and cannot hear or see Or shadow or likeness or a sound of thee Far off, albeit with man's own speech and face Thou shine yet and thou speak yet, showing forth grace— Ah me! grace only shed on souls that are Lit and led forth of shadow by thy star— Alas! to these men only grace, to these, Lord, whom thy love draws Godward, to thy knees— I, can I draw thee me-ward, can I seek, Who love thee not, to love me? seeing how weak, Lord, all this little love I bear thee is, And how much is my strong love more than this, My love that I love man with, that I bear Him sinning through me sinning? wilt thou care, God, for this love, if love be any, alas, In me to give thee, though long since there was, How long, when I too, Lord, was clean, even I, That now am unclean till the day I die— Haply by burning, harlot-fashion, made A horror in all hearts of wife and maid, Hateful, not knowing if ever in these mine eyes Shone any light of thine in any wise Or this were love at all that I bore thee?” And the night spake, and thundered on the sea, Ravening aloud for ruin of lives: and all The bastions of the main cliff's northward wall Rang response out from all their deepening length, As the east wind girded up his godlike strength And hurled in hard against that high-towered hold The fleeces of the flock that knows no fold, The rent white shreds of shattering storm: but she Heard not nor heeded wind or storming sea, Knew not if night were mild or mad with wind. “Yea, though deep lips and tender hair be thinned, Though cheek wither, brow fade, and bosom wane, Shall I change also from this heart again To maidenhood of heart and holiness? Shall I more love thee, Lord, or love him less— Ah miserable! though spirit and heart be rent, Shall I repent, Lord God? shall I repent? Nay, though thou slay me! for herein I am blest, That as I loved him yet I love him best— More than mine own soul or thy love or thee, Though thy love save and my love save not me. Blest am I beyond women even herein, That beyond all born women is my sin, And perfect my transgression: that above All offerings of all others is my love, Who have chosen it only, and put away for this Thee, and my soul's hope, Saviour, of the kiss Wherewith thy lips make welcome all thine own When in them life and death are overthrown; The sinless lips that seal the death of sin, The kiss wherewith their dumb lips touched begin Singing in heaven. “Where we shall never, love, Never stand up nor sing! for God above Knows us, how too much more than God to me Thy sweet love is, my poor love is to thee! Dear, dost thou see now, dost thou hear to-night, Sleeping, my waste wild speech, my face worn white, —Speech once heard soft by thee, face once kissed red!— In such a dream as when men see their dead And know not if they know if dead these be? Ah love, are thy days my days, and to thee Are all nights like as my nights? does the sun Grieve thee? art thou soul-sick till day be done, And weary till day rises? is thine heart Full of dead things as mine is? Nay, thou art Man, with man's strength and praise and pride of life, No bondwoman, no queen, no loveless wife That would be shamed albeit she had not sinned.” And swordlike was the sound of the iron wind, And as a breaking battle was the sea. “Nay, Lord, I pray thee let him love not me, Love me not any more, nor like me die, And be no more than such a thing as I. Turn his heart from me, lest my love too lose Thee as I lose thee, and his fair soul refuse For my sake thy fair heaven, and as I fell Fall, and be mixed with my soul and with hell. Let me die rather, and only; let me be Hated of him so he be loved of thee, Lord: for I would not have him with me there Out of thy light and love in the unlit air, Out of thy sight in the unseen hell where I Go gladly, going alone, so thou on high Lift up his soul and love him—Ah, Lord, Lord, Shalt thou love as I love him? she that poured From the alabaster broken at thy feet An ointment very precious, not so sweet As that poured likewise forth before thee then From the rehallowed heart of Magdalen, From a heart broken, yearning like the dove, An ointment very precious which is love— Couldst thou being holy and God, and sinful she, Love her indeed as surely she loved thee? Nay, but if not, then as we sinners can Let us love still in the old sad wise of man. For with less love than my love, having had Mine, though God love him he shall not be glad. And with such love as my love, I wot well, He shall not lie disconsolate in hell: Sad only as souls for utter love's sake be Here, and a little sad, perchance, for me— Me happy, me more glad than God above, In the utmost hell whose fires consume not love! For in the waste ways emptied of the sun He would say—‘Dear, thy place is void, and one Weeps among angels for thee, with his face Veiled, saying, O sister, how thy chosen place Stands desolate, that God made fair for thee! Is heaven not sweeter, and we thy brethren, we Fairer than love on earth and life in hell?’ And I—with me were all things then not well? Should I not answer—‘O love, be well content; Look on me, and behold if I repent.’ This were more to me than an angel's wings. Yea, many men pray God for many things, But I pray that this only thing may be.” And as a full field charging was the sea, And as the cry of slain men was the wind. “Yea, since I surely loved him, and he sinned Surely, though not as my sin his be black, God, give him to me—God, God, give him back! For now how should we live in twain or die? I am he indeed, thou knowest, and he is I. Not man and woman several as we were, But one thing with one life and death to bear. How should one love his own soul overmuch? And time is long since last I felt the touch, The sweet touch of my lover, hand and breath, In such delight as puts delight to death, Burn my soul through, till spirit and soul and sense, In the sharp grasp of the hour, with violence Died, and again through pangs of violent birth Lived, and laughed out with refluent might of mirth; Laughed each on other and shuddered into one, As a cloud shuddering dies into the sun. Ah, sense is that or spirit, soul or flesh, That only love lulls or awakes afresh? Ah, sweet is that or bitter, evil or good, That very love allays not as he would? Nay, truth is this or vanity, that gives No love assurance when love dies or lives? This that my spirit is wrung withal, and yet No surelier knows if haply thine forget, Thou that my spirit is wrung for, nor can say Love is not in thee dead as yesterday? Dost thou feel, thou, this heartbeat whence my heart Would send thee word what life is mine apart, And know by keen response what life is thine? Dost thou not hear one cry of all of mine? O Tristram's heart, have I no part in thee?” And all her soul was as the breaking sea, And all her heart anhungered as the wind. “Dost thou repent thee of the sin we sinned? Dost thou repent thee of the days and nights That kindled and that quenched for us their lights, The months that feasted us with all their hours, The ways that breathed of us in all their flowers, The dells that sang of us with all their doves? Dost thou repent thee of the wildwood loves? Is thine heart changed, and hallowed? art thou grown God's, and not mine? Yet, though my heart make moan, Fain would my soul give thanks for thine, if thou Be saved—yea, fain praise God, and knows not how. How should it know thanksgiving? nay, or learn Aught of the love wherewith thine own should burn, God's, that should cast out as an evil thing Mine? yea, what hand of prayer have I to cling, What heart to prophesy, what spirit of sight To strain insensual eyes toward increate light, Who look but back on life wherein I sinned?” And all their past came wailing in the wind, And all their future thundered in the sea. “But if my soul might touch the time to be, If hand might handle now or eye behold My life and death ordained me from of old, Life palpable, compact of blood and breath, Visible, present, naked, very death, Should I desire to know before the day These that I know not, nor is man that may? For haply, seeing, my heart would break for fear, And my soul timeless cast its load off here, Its load of life too bitter, love too sweet, And fall down shamed and naked at thy feet, God, who wouldst take no pity of it, nor give One hour back, one of all its hours to live Clothed with my mortal body, that once more, Once, on this reach of barren beaten shore, This stormy strand of life, ere sail were set, Had haply felt love's arms about it yet— Yea, ere death's bark put off to seaward, might With many a grief have bought me one delight That then should know me never. Ah, what years Would I endure not, filled up full with tears, Bitter like blood and dark as dread of death, To win one amorous hour of mingling breath, One fire-eyed hour and sunnier than the sun, For all these nights and days like nights but one? One hour of heaven born once, a stormless birth, For all these windy weary hours of earth? One, but one hour from birth of joy to death, For all these hungering hours of feverish breath? And I should lose this, having died and sinned.” And as man's anguish clamouring cried the wind, And as God's anger answering rang the sea. “And yet what life—Lord God, what life for me Has thy strong wrath made ready? Dost thou think How lips whose thirst hath only tears to drink Grow grey for grief untimely? Dost thou know, O happy God, how men wax weary of woe— Yea, for their wrong's sake that thine hand hath done Come even to hate thy semblance in the sun? Turn back from dawn and noon and all thy light To make their souls one with the soul of night? Christ, if thou hear yet or have eyes to see, Thou that hadst pity, and hast no pity on me, Know'st thou no more, as in this life's sharp span, What pain thou hadst on earth, what pain hath man? Hast thou no care, that all we suffer yet? What help is ours of thee if thou forget? What profit have we though thy blood were given, If we that sin bleed and be not forgiven? Not love but hate, thou bitter God and strange, Whose heart as man's heart hath grown cold with change, Not love but hate thou showest us that have sinned.” And like a world's cry shuddering was the wind, And like a God's voice threatening was the sea. “Nay, Lord, for thou wast gracious; nay, in thee No change can come with time or varying fate, No tongue bid thine be less compassionate, No sterner eye rebuke for mercy thine, No sin put out thy pity—no, not mine. Thou knowest us, Lord, thou knowest us, all we are, He, and the soul that hath his soul for star: Thou knowest as I know, Lord, how much more worth Than all souls clad and clasped about with earth, But most of all, God, how much more than I, Is this man's soul that surely shall not die. What righteousness, what judgment, Lord most high, Were this, to bend a brow of doom as grim As threats me, me the adulterous wife, on him? There lies none other nightly by his side: He hath not sought, he shall not seek a bride. Far as God sunders earth from heaven above, So far was my love born beneath his love. I loved him as the sea-wind loves the sea, To rend and ruin it only and waste: but he, As the sea loves a sea-bird loved he me, To foster and uphold my tired life's wing, And bounteously beneath me spread forth spring, A springtide space whereon to float or fly, A world of happy water, whence the sky Glowed goodlier, lightening from so glad a glass, Than with its own light only. Now, alas! Cloud hath come down and clothed it round with storm, And gusts and fits of eddying winds deform The feature of its glory. Yet be thou, God, merciful: nay, show but justice now, And let the sin in him that scarce was his Stand expiated with exile: and be this The price for him, the atonement this, that I With all the sin upon me live, and die With all thy wrath on me that most have sinned.” And like man's heart relenting sighed the wind, And as God's wrath subsiding sank the sea. “But if such grace be possible—if it be Not sin more strange than all sins past, and worse Evil, that cries upon thee for a curse, To pray such prayers from such a heart, do thou Hear, and make wide thine hearing toward me now; Let not my soul and his for ever dwell Sundered: though doom keep always heaven and hell Irreconcilable, infinitely apart, Keep not in twain for ever heart and heart That once, albeit by not thy law, were one; Let this be not thy will, that this be done. Let all else, all thou wilt of evil, be, But no doom, none, dividing him and me.” By this was heaven stirred eastward, and there came Up the rough ripple a labouring light like flame; And dawn, sore trembling still and grey with fear, Looked hardly forth, a face of heavier cheer Than one which grief or dread yet half enshrouds, Wild-eyed and wan, across the cleaving clouds. And Iseult, worn with watch long held on pain, Turned, and her eye lit on the hound Hodain, And all her heart went out in tears: and he Laid his kind head along her bended knee, Till round his neck her arms went hard, and all The night past from her as a chain might fall: But yet the heart within her, half undone, Wailed, and was loth to let her see the sun. And ere full day brought heaven and earth to flower, Far thence, a maiden in a marriage bower, That moment, hard by Tristram, oversea, Woke with glad eyes Iseult of Brittany. VI JOYOUS GARD A little time, O Love, a little light, A little hour for ease before the night. Sweet Love, that art so bitter; foolish Love, Whom wise men know for wiser, and thy dove More subtle than the serpent; for thy sake These pray thee for a little beam to break, A little grace to help them, lest men think Thy servants have but hours like tears to drink. O Love, a little comfort, lest they fear To serve as these have served thee who stand here. For these are thine, thy servants these, that stand Here nigh the limit of the wild north land, At margin of the grey great eastern sea, Dense-islanded with peaks and reefs, that see No life but of the fleet wings fair and free Which cleave the mist and sunlight all day long With sleepless flight and cries more glad than song. Strange ways of life have led them hither, here To win fleet respite from desire and fear With armistice from sorrow; strange and sweet Ways trodden by forlorn and casual feet Till kindlier chance woke toward them kindly will In happier hearts of lovers, and their ill Found rest, as healing surely might it not, By gift and kingly grace of Launcelot At gracious bidding given of Guenevere. For in the trembling twilight of this year Ere April sprang from hope to certitude Two hearts of friends fast linked had fallen at feud As they rode forth on hawking, by the sign Which gave his new bride's brother Ganhardine To know the truth of Tristram's dealing, how Faith kept of him against his marriage vow Kept virginal his bride-bed night and morn; Whereat, as wroth his blood should suffer scorn, Came Ganhardine to Tristram, saying, “Behold, We have loved thee, and for love we have shown of old Scorn hast thou shown us: wherefore is thy bride Not thine indeed, a stranger at thy side, Contemned? what evil hath she done, to be Mocked with mouth-marriage and despised of thee, Shamed, set at nought, rejected?” But there came On Tristram's brow and eye the shadow and flame Confused of wrath and wonder, ere he spake, Saying, “Hath she bid thee for thy sister's sake Plead with me, who believed of her in heart More nobly than to deem such piteous part Should find so fair a player? or whence hast thou Of us this knowledge?” “Nay,” said he, “but now, Riding beneath these whitethorns overhead, There fell a flower into her girdlestead Which laughing she shook out, and smiling said— ‘Lo, what large leave the wind hath given this stray, To lie more near my heart than till this day Aught ever since my mother lulled me lay Or even my lord came ever;’ whence I wot We are all thy scorn, a race regarded not Nor held as worth communion of thine own, Except in her be found some fault alone To blemish our alliance.” Then replied Tristram, “Nor blame nor scorn may touch my bride, Albeit unknown of love she live, and be Worth a man worthier than her love thought me. Faith only, faith withheld me, faith forbade The blameless grace wherewith love's grace makes glad All lives linked else in wedlock; not that less I loved the sweet light of her loveliness, But that my love toward faith was more: and thou, Albeit thine heart be keen against me now, Couldst thou behold my very lady, then No more of thee than of all other men Should this my faith be held a faithless fault.” And ere that day their hawking came to halt, Being sore of him entreated for a sign, He sware to bring his brother Ganhardine To sight of that strange Iseult: and thereon Forth soon for Cornwall are these brethren gone, Even to that royal pleasance where the hunt Rang ever of old with Tristram's horn in front Blithe as the queen's horse bounded at his side: And first of all her dames forth pranced in pride That day before them, with a ringing rein All golden-glad, the king's false bride Brangwain, The queen's true handmaid ever: and on her Glancing, “Be called for all time truth-teller, O Tristram, of all true men's tongues alive,” Quoth Ganhardine; “for may my soul so thrive As yet mine eye drank never sight like this.” “Ay?” Tristram said, “and she thou look'st on is So great in grace of goodliness, that thou Hast less thought left of wrath against me now, Seeing but my lady's handmaid? Nay, behold; See'st thou no light more golden than of gold Shine where she moves in midst of all, above All, past all price or praise or prayer of love? Lo, this is she.” But as one mazed with wine Stood, stunned in spirit and stricken, Ganhardine, And gazed out hard against them: and his heart As with a sword was cloven, and rent apart As with strong fangs of fire; and scarce he spake, Saying how his life for even a handmaid's sake Was made a flame within him. And the knight Bade him, being known of none that stood in sight, Bear to Brangwain his ring, that she unseen Might give in token privily to the queen And send swift word where under moon or sun They twain might yet be no more twain but one. And that same night, under the stars that rolled Over their warm deep wildwood nights of old Whose hours for grains of sand shed sparks of fire, Such way was made anew for their desire By secret wile of sickness feigned, to keep The king far off her vigils or her sleep, That in the queen's pavilion midway set By glimmering moondawn were those lovers met, And Ganhardine of Brangwain gat him grace. And in some passionate soft interspace Between two swells of passion, when their lips Breathed, and made room for such brief speech as slips From tongues athirst with draughts of amorous wine That leaves them thirstier than the salt sea's brine, Was counsel taken how to fly, and where Find covert from the wild world's ravening air That hunts with storm the feet of nights and days Through strange thwart lines of life and flowerless ways. Then said Iseult: “Lo, now the chance is here Foreshown me late by word of Guenevere, To give me comfort of thy rumoured wrong, My traitor Tristram, when report was strong Of me forsaken and thine heart estranged: Nor should her sweet soul toward me yet be changed Nor all her love lie barren, if mine hand Crave harvest of it from the flowering land. See therefore if this counsel please thee not, That we take horse in haste for Camelot And seek that friendship of her plighted troth Which love shall be full fain to lend, nor loth Shall my love be to take it.” So next night The multitudinous stars laughed round their flight, Fulfilling far with laughter made of light The encircling deeps of heaven: and in brief space At Camelot their long love gat them grace Of those fair twain whose heads men's praise impearled As love's two lordliest lovers in the world: And thence as guests for harbourage past they forth To win this noblest hold of all the north. Far by wild ways and many days they rode, Till clear across June's kingliest sunset glowed The great round girth of goodly wall that showed Where for one clear sweet season's length should be Their place of strength to rest in, fain and free, By the utmost margin of the loud lone sea. And now, O Love, what comfort? God most high, Whose life is as a flower's to live and die, Whose light is everlasting: Lord, whose breath Speaks music through the deathless lips of death Whereto time's heart rings answer: Bard, whom time Hears, and is vanquished with a wandering rhyme That once thy lips made fragrant: Seer, whose sooth Joy knows not well, but sorrow knows for truth, Being priestess of thy soothsayings: Love, what grace Shall these twain find at last before thy face? This many a year they have served thee, and deserved, If ever man might yet of all that served, Since the first heartbeat bade the first man's knee Bend, and his mouth take music, praising thee, Some comfort; and some honey indeed of thine Thou hast mixed for these with life's most bitter wine, Commending to their passionate lips a draught No deadlier than thy chosen of old have quaffed And blessed thine hand, their cupbearer's: for not On all men comes the grace that seals their lot As holier in thy sight, for all these feuds That rend it, than the light-souled multitude's, Nor thwarted of thine hand nor blessed; but these Shall see no twilight, Love, nor fade at ease, Grey-grown and careless of desired delight, But lie down tired and sleep before the night. These shall not live till time or change may chill Or doubt divide or shame subdue their will, Or fear or slow repentance work them wrong, Or love die first: these shall not live so long. Death shall not take them drained of dear true life Already, sick or stagnant from the strife, Quenched: not with dry-drawn veins and lingering breath Shall these through crumbling hours crouch down to death. Swift, with one strong clean leap, ere life's pulse tire, Most like the leap of lions or of fire, Sheer death shall bound upon them: one pang past, The first keen sense of him shall be their last, Their last shall be no sense of any fear, More than their life had sense of anguish here. Weeks and light months had fled at swallow's speed Since here their first hour sowed for them the seed Of many sweet as rest or hope could be; Since on the blown beach of a glad new sea Wherein strange rocks like fighting men stand scarred They saw the strength and help of Joyous Gard. Within the full deep glorious tower that stands Between the wild sea and the broad wild lands Love led and gave them quiet: and they drew Life like a God's life in each wind that blew, And took their rest, and triumphed. Day by day The mighty moorlands and the sea-walls grey, The brown bright waters of green fells that sing One song to rocks and flowers and birds on wing, Beheld the joy and glory that they had, Passing, and how the whole world made them glad, And their great love was mixed with all things great, As life being lovely, and yet being strong like fate. For when the sun sprang on the sudden sea Their eyes sprang eastward, and the day to be Was lit in them untimely: such delight They took yet of the clear cold breath and light That goes before the morning, and such grace Was deathless in them through their whole life's space As dies in many with their dawn that dies And leaves in pulseless hearts and flameless eyes No light to lighten and no tear to weep For youth's high joy that time has cast on sleep. Yea, this old grace and height of joy they had, To lose no jot of all that made them glad And filled their springs of spirit with such fire That all delight fed in them all desire; And no whit less than in their first keen prime The spring's breath blew through all their summer time, And in their skies would sunlike Love confuse Clear April colours with hot August hues, And in their hearts one light of sun and moon Reigned, and the morning died not of the noon: Such might of life was in them, and so high Their heart of love rose higher than fate could fly. And many a large delight of hawk and hound The great glad land that knows no bourne or bound, Save the wind's own and the outer sea-bank's, gave Their days for comfort; many a long blithe wave Buoyed their blithe bark between the bare bald rocks, Deep, steep, and still, save for the swift free flocks Unshepherded, uncompassed, unconfined, That when blown foam keeps all the loud air blind Mix with the wind's their triumph, and partake The joy of blasts that ravin, waves that break, All round and all below their mustering wings, A clanging cloud that round the cliff's edge clings On each bleak bluff breaking the strenuous tides That rings reverberate mirth when storm bestrides The subject night in thunder: many a noon They took the moorland's or the bright sea's boon With all their hearts into their spirit of sense, Rejoicing, where the sudden dells grew dense With sharp thick flight of hillside birds, or where On some strait rock's ledge in the intense mute air Erect against the cliff's sheer sunlit white Blue as the clear north heaven, clothed warm with light, Stood neck to bended neck and wing to wing With heads fast hidden under, close as cling Flowers on one flowering almond-branch in spring, Three herons deep asleep against the sun, Each with one bright foot downward poised, and one Wing-hidden hard by the bright head, and all Still as fair shapes fixed on some wondrous wall Of minster-aisle or cloister-close or hall To take even time's eye prisoner with delight. Or, satisfied with joy of sound and sight, They sat and communed of things past: what state King Arthur, yet unwarred upon by fate, Held high in hall at Camelot, like one Whose lordly life was as the mounting sun That climbs and pauses on the point of noon, Sovereign: how royal rang the tourney's tune Through Tristram's three days' triumph, spear to spear, When Iseult shone enthroned by Guenevere, Rose against rose, the highest adored on earth, Imperial: yet with subtle notes of mirth Would she bemock her praises, and bemoan Her glory by that splendour overthrown Which lightened from her sister's eyes elate; Saying how by night a little light seems great, But less than least of all things, very nought, When dawn undoes the web that darkness wrought; How like a tower of ivory well designed By subtlest hand subserving subtlest mind, Ivory with flower of rose incarnadined And kindling with some God therein revealed, A light for grief to look on and be healed, Stood Guenevere: and all beholding her Were heartstruck even as earth at midsummer With burning wonder, hardly to be borne. So was that amorous glorious lady born, A fiery memory for all storied years: Nor might men call her sisters crowned her peers, Her sister queens, put all by her to scorn: She had such eyes as are not made to mourn; But in her own a gleaming ghost of tears Shone, and their glance was slower than Guenevere's, And fitfuller with fancies grown of grief; Shamed as a Mayflower shames an autumn leaf Full well she wist it could not choose but be If in that other's eyeshot standing she Should lift her looks up ever: wherewithal Like fires whose light fills heaven with festival Flamed her eyes full on Tristram's; and he laughed Answering, “What wile of sweet child-hearted craft That children forge for children, to beguile Eyes known of them not witless of the wile But fain to seem for sport's sake self-deceived, Wilt thou find out now not to be believed? Or how shall I trust more than ouphe or elf Thy truth to me-ward, who beliest thyself?” “Nor elf nor ouphe or aught of airier kind,” Quoth she, “though made of moonbeams moist and blind, Is light if weighed with man's winged weightless mind. Though thou keep somewise troth with me, God wot, When thou didst wed, I doubt, thou thoughtest not So charily to keep it.” “Nay,” said he, “Yet am not I rebukable by thee As Launcelot, erring, held me ere he wist No mouth save thine of mine was ever kissed Save as a sister's only, since we twain Drank first the draught assigned our lips to drain That Fate and Love with darkling hands commixt Poured, and no power to part them came betwixt, But either's will, howbeit they seem at strife, Was toward us one, as death itself and life Are one sole doom toward all men, nor may one Behold not darkness, who beholds the sun.” “Ah, then,” she said, “what word is this men hear Of Merlin, how some doom too strange to fear Was cast but late about him oversea, Sweet recreant, in thy bridal Brittany? Is not his life sealed fast on him with sleep, By witchcraft of his own and love's, to keep Till earth be fire and ashes?” “Surely,” said Her lover, “not as one alive or dead The great good wizard, well beloved and well Predestinate of heaven that casts out hell For guerdon gentler far than all men's fate, Exempt alone of all predestinate, Takes his strange rest at heart of slumberland, More deep asleep in green Broceliande Than shipwrecked sleepers in the soft green sea Beneath the weight of wandering waves: but he Hath for those roofing waters overhead Above him always all the summer spread Or all the winter wailing: or the sweet Late leaves marked red with autumn's burning feet, Or withered with his weeping, round the seer Rain, and he sees not, nor may heed or hear The witness of the winter: but in spring He hears above him all the winds on wing Through the blue dawn between the brightening boughs, And on shut eyes and slumber-smitten brows Feels ambient change in the air and strengthening sun, And knows the soul that was his soul at one With the ardent world's, and in the spirit of earth His spirit of life reborn to mightier birth And mixed with things of elder life than ours; With cries of birds, and kindling lamps of flowers, And sweep and song of winds, and fruitful light Of sunbeams, and the far faint breath of night, And waves and woods at morning: and in all, Soft as at noon the slow sea's rise and fall, He hears in spirit a song that none but he Hears from the mystic mouth of Nimue Shed like a consecration; and his heart, Hearing, is made for love's sake as a part Of that far singing, and the life thereof Part of that life that feeds the world with love: Yea, heart in heart is molten, hers and his, Into the world's heart and the soul that is Beyond or sense or vision; and their breath Stirs the soft springs of deathless life and death, Death that bears life, and change that brings forth seed Of life to death and death to life indeed, As blood recircling through the unsounded veins Of earth and heaven with all their joys and pains. Ah, that when love shall laugh no more nor weep We too, we too might hear that song and sleep!” “Yea,” said Iseult, “some joy it were to be Lost in the sun's light and the all-girdling sea, Mixed with the winds and woodlands, and to bear Part in the large life of the quickening air, And the sweet earth's, our mother: yet to pass More fleet than mirrored faces from the glass Out of all pain and all delight, so far That love should seem but as the furthest star Sunk deep in trembling heaven, scarce seen or known, As a dead moon forgotten, once that shone Where now the sun shines—nay, not all things yet, Not all things always, dying, would I forget.” And Tristram answered amorously, and said: “O heart that here art mine, O heavenliest head That ever took men's worship here, which art Mine, how shall death put out the fire at heart, Quench in men's eyes the head's remembered light, That time shall set but higher in more men's sight? Think thou not much to die one earthly day, Being made not in their mould who pass away Nor who shall pass for ever.” “Ah,” she said, “What shall it profit me, being praised and dead? What profit have the flowers of all men's praise? What pleasure of our pleasure have the days That pour on us delight of life and mirth? What fruit of all our joy on earth has earth? Nor am I—nay, my lover, am I one To take such part in heaven's enkindling sun And in the inviolate air and sacred sea As clothes with grace that wondrous Nimue? For all her works are bounties, all her deeds Blessings; her days are scrolls wherein love reads The record of his mercies; heaven above Hath not more heavenly holiness of love Than earth beneath, wherever pass or pause Her feet that move not save by love's own laws, In gentleness of godlike wayfaring To heal men's hearts as earth is healed by spring Of all such woes as winter: what am I, Love, that have strength but to desire and die, That have but grace to love and do thee wrong, What am I that my name should live so long, Save as the star that crossed thy star-struck lot, With hers whose light was life to Launcelot? Life gave she him, and strength, and fame to be For ever: I, what gift can I give thee? Peril and sleepless watches, fearful breath Of dread more bitter for my sake than death When death came nigh to call me by my name, Exile, rebuke, remorse, and—O, not shame. Shame only, this I gave thee not, whom none May give that worst thing ever—no, not one. Of all that hate, all hateful hearts that see Darkness for light and hate where love should be, None for my shame's sake may speak shame of thee.” And Tristram answering ere he kissed her smiled: “O very woman, god at once and child, What ails thee to desire of me once more The assurance that thou hadst in heart before? For all this wild sweet waste of sweet vain breath, Thou knowest I know thou hast given me life, not death. The shadow of death, informed with shows of strife, Was ere I won thee all I had of life. Light war, light love, light living, dreams in sleep, Joy slight and light, not glad enough to weep, Filled up my foolish days with sound and shine, Vision and gleam from strange men's cast on mine, Reverberate light from eyes presaging thine That shed but shadowy moonlight where thy face Now sheds forth sunshine in the deep same place, The deep live heart half dead and shallower then Than summer fords which thwart not wandering men. For how should I, signed sorrow's from my birth, Kiss dumb the loud red laughing lips of mirth? Or how, sealed thine to be, love less than heaven on earth? My heart in me was held at restless rest, Presageful of some prize beyond its quest, Prophetic still with promise, fain to find the best. For one was fond and one was blithe and one Fairer than all save twain whose peers are none; For third on earth is none that heaven hath seen To stand with Guenevere beside my queen. Not Nimue, girt with blessing as a guard: Not the soft lures and laughters of Ettarde: Not she, that splendour girdled round with gloom, Crowned as with iron darkness of the tomb, And clothed with clouding conscience of a monstrous doom, Whose blind incestuous love brought forth a fire To burn her ere it burn its darkling sire, Her mother's son, King Arthur: yet but late We saw pass by that fair live shadow of fate, The queen Morgause of Orkney, like a dream That scares the night when moon and starry beam Sicken and swoon before some sorcerer's eyes Whose wordless charms defile the saintly skies, Bright still with fire and pulse of blood and breath, Whom her own sons have doomed for shame to death.” “Death—yea,” quoth she, “there is not said or heard So oft aloud on earth so sure a word. Death, and again death, and for each that saith Ten tongues chime answer to the sound of death. Good end God send us ever—so men pray. But I—this end God send me, would I say, To die not of division and a heart Rent or with sword of severance cloven apart, But only when thou diest and only where thou art, O thou my soul and spirit and breath to me, O light, life, love! yea, let this only be, That dying I may praise God who gave me thee, Let hap what will thereafter.” So that day They communed, even till even was worn away, Nor aught they said seemed strange or sad to say, But sweet as night's dim dawn to weariness. Nor loved they life or love for death's sake less, Nor feared they death for love's or life's sake more And on the sounding soft funereal shore They, watching till the day should wholly die, Saw the far sea sweep to the far grey sky, Saw the long sands sweep to the long grey sea. And night made one sweet mist of moor and lea, And only far off shore the foam gave light. And life in them sank silent as the night. VII THE WIFE'S VIGIL But all that year in Brittany forlorn, More sick at heart with wrath than fear of scorn And less in love with love than grief, and less With grief than pride of spirit and bitterness, Till all the sweet life of her blood was changed And all her soul from all her past estranged And all her will with all itself at strife And all her mind at war with all her life, Dwelt the white-handed Iseult, maid and wife, A mourner that for mourning robes had on Anger and doubt and hate of things foregone. For that sweet spirit of old which made her sweet Was parched with blasts of thought as flowers with heat And withered as with wind of evil will; Though slower than frosts or fires consume or kill That bleak black wind vexed all her spirit still. As ripples reddening in the roughening breath Of the eager east when dawn does night to death, So rose and stirred and kindled in her thought Fierce barren fluctuant fires that lit not aught, But scorched her soul with yearning keen as hate And dreams that left her wrath disconsolate. When change came first on that first heaven where all Life's hours were flowers that dawn's light hand let fall, The sun that smote her dewy cloud of days Wrought from its showery folds his rainbow's rays, For love the red, for hope the gentle green, But yellow jealousy glared pale between. Ere yet the sky grew heavier, and her head Bent flowerwise, chill with change and fancies fled, She saw but love arch all her heaven across with red, A burning bloom that seemed to breathe and beat And waver only as flame with rapturous heat Wavers; and all the world therewith smelt sweet, As incense kindling from the rose-red flame: And when that full flush waned, and love became Scarce fainter, though his fading horoscope From certitude of sight receded, hope Held yet her April-coloured light aloft As though to lure back love, a lamp sublime and soft. But soon that light paled as a leaf grows pale And fluttered leaf-like in the gathering gale And melted even as dew-flakes, whose brief sheen The sun that gave despoils of glittering green; Till harder shone 'twixt hope and love grown cold A sallow light like withering autumn's gold, The pale strong flame of jealous thought, that glows More deep than hope's green bloom or love's enkindled rose: As though the sunflower's faint fierce disk absorbed The spirit and heart of starrier flowers disorbed. That same full hour of twilight's doors unbarred To let bright night behold in Joyous Gard The glad grave eyes of lovers far away Watch with sweet thoughts of death the death of day Saw lonelier by the narrower opening sea Sit fixed at watch Iseult of Brittany. As darkness from deep valleys void and bleak Climbs till it clothe with night the sunniest peak Where only of all a mystic mountain-land Day seems to cling yet with a trembling hand And yielding heart reluctant to recede, So, till her soul was clothed with night indeed, Rose the slow cloud of envious will within And hardening hate that held itself no sin, Veiled heads of vision, eyes of evil gleam, Dim thought on thought, and darkling dream on dream. Far off she saw in spirit, and seeing abhorred, The likeness wrought on darkness of her lord Shine, and the imperial semblance at his side Whose shadow from her seat cast down the bride, Whose power and ghostly presence thrust her forth: Beside that unknown other sea far north She saw them, clearer than in present sight Rose on her eyes the starry shadow of night; And on her heart that heaved with gathering fate Rose red with storm the starless shadow of hate; And eyes and heart made one saw surge and swell The fires of sunset like the fires of hell. As though God's wrath would burn up sin with shame, The incensed red gold of deepening heaven grew flame: The sweet green spaces of the soft low sky Faded, as fields that withering wind leaves dry: The sea's was like a doomsman's blasting breath From lips afoam with ravenous lust of death. A night like desolation, sombre-starred, Above the great walled girth of Joyous Gard Spread forth its wide sad strength of shadow and gloom Wherein those twain were compassed round with doom: Hell from beneath called on them, and she heard Reverberate judgment in the wild wind's word Cry, till the sole sound of their names that rang Clove all the sea-mist with a clarion's clang, And clouds to clouds and flames to clustering flames Beat back the dark noise of the direful names. Fear and strong exultation caught her breath, And triumph like the bitterness of death, And rapture like the rage of hate allayed With ruin and ravin that its might hath made; And her heart swelled and strained itself to hear What may be heard of no man's hungering ear, And as a soil that cleaves in twain for drouth Thirsted for judgment given of God's own mouth Against them, till the strength of dark desire Was in her as a flame of hell's own fire. Nor seemed the wrath which held her spirit in stress Aught else or worse than passionate holiness, Nor the ardent hate which called on judgment's rod More hateful than the righteousness of God. “How long, till thou do justice, and my wrong Stand expiate? O long-suffering judge, how long? Shalt thou not put him in mine hand one day Whom I so loved, to spare not but to slay? Shalt thou not cast her down for me to tread, Me, on the pale pride of her humbled head? Do I not well, being angry? doth not hell Require them? yea, thou knowest that I do well. Is not thy seal there set of bloodred light For witness on the brows of day and night? Who shall unseal it? what shall melt away Thy signet from the doors of night and day? No man, nor strength of any spirit above, Nor prayer, nor ardours of adulterous love. Thou art God, the strong lord over body and soul: Hast thou not in the terrors of thy scroll All names of all men written as with fire? Thine only breath bids time and space respire: And are not all things evil in them done More clear in thine eyes than in ours the sun? Hast thou not sight stretched wide enough to see These that offend it, these at once and me? Is thine arm shortened or thine hand struck down As palsied? have thy brows not strength to frown? Are thine eyes blind with film of withering age? Burns not thine heart with righteousness of rage Yet, and the royal rancour toward thy foes Retributive of ruin? Time should close, Thou said'st, and earth fade as a leaf grows grey, Ere one word said of thine should pass away. Was this then not thy word, thou God most high, That sin shall surely bring forth death and die, Seeing how these twain live and have joy of life, His harlot and the man that made me wife? For is it I, perchance, I that have sinned? Me, peradventure, should thy wasting wind Smite, and thy sun blast, and thy storms devour Me with keen fangs of lightning? should thy power Put forth on me the weight of its awakening hour? Shall I that bear this burden bear that weight Of judgment? is my sin against thee great, If all my heart against them burn with all its hate? Thine, and not mine, should hate be? nay, but me They have spoiled and scoffed at, who can touch not thee. Me, me, the fullness of their joy drains dry, Their fruitfulness makes barren: thou, not I, Lord, is it, whom their wrongdoing clothes with shame, That all who speak shoot tongues out at thy name As all who hear mock mine? Make me thy sword At least, if even thou too be wronged, O Lord, At all of these that wrong me: make mine hand As lightning, or my tongue a fiery brand, To burn or smite them with thy wrath: behold, I have nought on earth save thee for hope or hold, Fail me not thou: I have nought but this to crave, Make me thy mean to give them to the grave, Thy sign that all men seeing may speak thee just, Thy word which turns the strengths of sin to dust, Thy blast which burns up towers and thrones with fire. Lord, is this gift, this grace that I require, So great a gift, Lord, for thy grace to give And bid me bear thy part retributive? That I whom scorn makes mouths at, I might be Thy witness if loud sin may mock at thee? For lo, my life is as a barren ear Plucked from the sheaf: dark days drive past me here Downtrodden, while joy's reapers pile their sheaves, A thing more vile than autumn's weariest leaves, For these the sun filled once with sap of life. O thou my lord that hadst me to thy wife, Dost thou not fear at all, remembering me, The love that bowed my whole soul down to thee? Is this so wholly nought for man to dread, Man, whose life walks between the quick and dead, Naked, and warred about with wind and sea, That one should love and hate as I do thee? That one should live in all the world his foe So mortal as the hate that loves him so? Nought, is it nought, O husband, O my knight, O strong man and indomitable in fight, That one more weak than foam-bells on the sea Should have in heart such thoughts as I of thee? Thou art bound about with stately strengths for bands: What strength shall keep thee from my strengthless hands? Thou art girt about with goodly guards and great: What fosse may fence thee round as deep as hate? Thou art wise: will wisdom teach thee fear of me? Thou art great of heart: shall this deliver thee? What wall so massive, or what tower so high, Shall be thy surety that thou shouldst not die, If that which comes against thee be but I? Who shall rise up of power to take thy part, What skill find strength to save, what strength find art, If that which wars against thee be my heart? Not iron, nor the might of force afield, Nor edge of sword, nor sheltering weight of shield, Nor all thy fame since all thy praise began, Nor all the love and laud thou hast of man, Nor, though his noiseless hours with wool be shod, Shall God's love keep thee from the wrath of God. O son of sorrows, hast thou said at heart, Haply, God loves thee, God shall take thy part, Who hath all these years endured thee, since thy birth From sorrow's womb bade sin be born on earth? So long he hath cast his buckler over thee, Shall he not surely guard thee even from me? Yea, but if yet he give thee while I live Into mine hands as he shall surely give, Ere death at last bring darkness on thy face, Call then on him, call not on me for grace, Cast not away one prayer, one suppliant breath, On me that commune all this while with death. For I that was not and that was thy wife Desire not but one hour of all thy life Wherein to triumph till that hour be past; But this mine hour I look for is thy last.” So mused she till the fire in sea and sky Sank, and the northwest wind spake harsh on high, And like the sea's heart waxed her heart that heard, Strong, dark, and bitter, till the keen wind's word Seemed of her own soul spoken, and the breath All round her not of darkness, but of death. VIII THE LAST PILGRIMAGE Enough of ease, O Love, enough of light, Enough of rest before the shadow of night. Strong Love, whom death finds feebler; kingly Love, Whom time discrowns in season, seeing thy dove Spell-stricken by the serpent; for thy sake These that saw light see night's dawn only break, Night's cup filled up with slumber, whence men think The draught more dread than thine was dire to drink. O Love, thy day sets darkling: hope and fear Fall from thee standing stern as death stands here. For what have these to do with fear or hope On whom the gates of outer darkness ope, On whom the door of life's desire is barred? Past like a cloud, their days in Joyous Gard Gleam like a cloud the westering sun stains red Till all the blood of day's blithe heart be bled And all night's heart requickened; in their eyes So flame and fade those far memorial skies, So shines the moorland, so revives the sea, Whereon they gazing mused of things to be And wist not more of them than waters know What wind with next day's change of tide shall blow. Dark roll the deepening days whose waves divide Unseasonably, with storm-struck change of tide, Tristram from Iseult: nor may sorrow say If better wind shall blow than yesterday With next day risen or any day to come. For ere the songs of summer's death fell dumb, And autumn bade the imperial moorlands change Their purples, and the bracken's bloom grow strange As hope's green blossom touched with time's harsh rust, Was all their joy of life shaken to dust, And all its fire made ashes: by the strand Where late they strayed and communed hand from hand For the last time fell separate, eyes of eyes Took for the last time leave, and saw the skies Dark with their deep division. The last time— The last that ever love's rekindling rhyme Should keep for them life's days and nights in tune With refluence of the morning and the moon Alternative in music, and make one The secrets of the stardawn and the sun For these twain souls ere darkness held them fast; The last before the labour marked for last And toil of utmost knighthood, till the wage Of rest might crown his crowning pilgrimage Whereon forth faring must he take farewell, With spear for staff and sword for scallop-shell And scrip wherein close memory hoarded yet Things holier held than death might well forget; The last time ere the travel were begun Whose goal is unbeholden of the sun, The last wherewith love's eyes might yet be lit, Came, and they could but dream they knew not it. For Tristram parting from her wist at heart How well she wist they might not choose but part, And he pass forth a pilgrim, when there came A sound of summons in the high king's name For succour toward his vassal Triamour, King in wild Wales, now spoiled of all his power, As Tristram's father ere his fair son's birth, By one the strongest of the sons of earth, Urgan, an iron bulk of giant mould: And Iseult in Tintagel as of old Sat crowned with state and sorrow: for her lord At Arthur's hand required her back restored, And willingly compelled against her will She yielded, saying within her own soul still Some season yet of soft or stormier breath Should haply give her life again or death: For now nor quick nor dead nor bright nor dark Were all her nights and days wherein King Mark Held haggard watch upon her, and his eyes Were cloudier than the gradual wintering skies That closed about the wan wild land and sea. And bitter toward him waxed her heart: but he Was rent in twain betwixt harsh love and hate With pain and passion half compassionate That yearned and laboured to be quit of shame, And could not: and his life grew smouldering flame. And hers a cloud full-charged with storm and shower, Though touched with trembling gleams of fire's bright flower That flashed and faded on its fitful verge, As hope would strive with darkness and emerge And sink, a swimmer strangled by the swallowing surge. But Tristram by dense hills and deepening vales Rode through the wild glad wastes of glorious Wales, High-hearted with desire of happy fight And strong in soul with merrier sense of might Than since the fair first years that hailed him knight: For all his will was toward the war, so long Had love repressed and wrought his glory wrong, So far the triumph and so fair the praise Seemed now that kindled all his April days. And here in bright blown autumn, while his life Was summer's yet for strength toward love or strife, Blithe waxed his hope toward battle, and high desire To pluck once more as out of circling fire Fame, the broad flower whose breath makes death more sweet Than roses crushed by love's receding feet. But all the lovely land wherein he went The blast of ruin and ravenous war had rent; And black with fire the fields where homesteads were, And foul with festering dead the high soft air, And loud with wail of women many a stream Whose own live song was like love's deepening dream, Spake all against the spoiler: wherefore still Wrath waxed with pity, quickening all his will, In Tristram's heart for every league he rode Through the aching land so broad a curse bestrode With so supreme a shadow: till one dawn Above the green bloom of a gleaming lawn, High on the strait steep windy bridge that spanned A glen's deep mouth, he saw that shadow stand Visible, sword on thigh and mace in hand Vast as the mid bulk of a roof-tree's beam. So, sheer above the wild wolf-haunted stream, Dire as the face disfeatured of a dream, Rose Urgan: and his eyes were night and flame; But like the fiery dawn were his that came Against him, lit with more sublime desire Than lifts toward heaven the leaping heart of fire: And strong in vantage of his perilous place The huge high presence, red as earth's first race, Reared like a reed the might up of his mace, And smote: but lightly Tristram swerved, and drove Right in on him, whose void stroke only clove Air, and fell wide, thundering athwart: and he Sent forth a stormier cry than wind or sea When midnight takes the tempest for her lord; And all the glen's throat seemed as hell's that roared; But high like heaven's light over hell shone Tristram's sword, Falling, and bright as storm shows God's bare brand Flashed as it shore sheer off the huge right hand Whose strength was as the shadow of death on all that land. And like the trunk of some grim tree sawn through Reeled Urgan, as his left hand grasped and drew A steel by sorcerers tempered: and anew Raged the red wind of fluctuant fight, till all The cliffs were thrilled as by the clangorous call Of storm's blown trumpets from the core of night, Charging: and even as with the storm-wind's might On Tristram's helm that sword crashed: and the knight Fell, and his arms clashed, and a wide cry brake From those far off that heard it, for his sake Soul-stricken: and that bulk of monstrous birth Sent forth again a cry more dire for mirth: But ere the sunbright arms were soiled of earth They flashed again, re-risen: and swift and loud Rang the strokes out as from a circling cloud, So dense the dust wrought over them its drifted shroud. Strong strokes, within the mist their battle made, Each hailed on other through the shifting shade That clung about them hurtling as the swift fight swayed: And each between the jointed corslet saw Break forth his foe's bright blood at each grim flaw Steel made in hammered iron: till again The fiend put forth his might more strong for pain And cleft the great knight's glittering shield in twain, Laughing for very wrath and thirst to kill, A beast's broad laugh of blind and wolfish will, And smote again ere Tristram's lips drew breath Panting, and swept as by the sense of death, That surely should have touched and sealed them fast Save that the sheer stroke shrilled aside, and passed Frustrate: but answering Tristram smote anew, And thrust the brute breast as with lightning through Clean with one cleaving stroke of perfect might: And violently the vast bulk leapt upright, And plunged over the bridge, and fell: and all The cliffs reverberate from his monstrous fall Rang: and the land by Tristram's grace was free. So with high laud and honour thence went he, And southward set his sail again, and passed The lone land's ending, first beheld and last Of eyes that look on England from the sea: And his heart mourned within him, knowing how she Whose heart with his was fatefully made fast Sat now fast bound, as though some charm were cast About her, such a brief space eastward thence, And yet might soul not break the bonds of sense And bring her to him in very life and breath More than had this been even the sea of death That washed between them, and its wide sweet light The dim strait's darkness of the narrowing night That shuts about men dying whose souls put forth To pierce its passage through: but south and north Alike for him were other than they were: For all the northward coast shone smooth and fair, And off its iron cliffs the keen-edged air Blew summer, kindling from her mute bright mouth; But winter breathed out of the murmuring south, Where, pale with wrathful watch on passing ships, The lone wife lay in wait with wan dumb lips. Yet, sailing where the shoreward ripple curled Of the most wild sweet waves in all the world, His soul took comfort even for joy to see The strong deep joy of living sun and sea, The large deep love of living sea and land, As past the lonely lion-guarded strand Where the huge warder lifts his couchant sides, Asleep, above the sleepless lapse of tides, The light sail swept, and past the unsounded caves Unsearchable, wherein the pulse of waves Throbs through perpetual darkness to and fro, And the blind night swims heavily below While heavily the strong noon broods above, Even to the very bay whence very Love, Strong daughter of the giant gods who wrought Sun, earth, and sea out of their procreant thought, Most meetly might have risen, and most divine Beheld and heard things round her sound and shine From floors of foam and gold to walls of serpentine. For splendid as the limbs of that supreme Incarnate beauty through men's visions gleam, Whereof all fairest things are even but shadow or dream, And lovely like as Love's own heavenliest face, Gleams there and glows the presence and the grace Even of the mother of all, in perfect pride of place. For otherwhere beneath our world-wide sky There may not be beheld of men that die Aught else like this that dies not, nor may stress Of ages that bow down men's works make less The exultant awe that clothes with power its loveliness. For who sets eye thereon soever knows How since these rocks and waves first rolled and rose The marvel of their many-coloured might Hath borne this record sensible to sight, The witness and the symbol of their own delight, The gospel graven of life's most heavenly law, Joy, brooding on its own still soul with awe, A sense of godlike rest in godlike strife, The sovereign conscience of the spirit of life. Nor otherwhere on strand or mountain tower Hath such fair beauty shining forth in flower Put on the imperial robe of such imperious power. For all the radiant rocks from depth to height Burn with vast bloom of glories blossom-bright As though the sun's own hand had thrilled them through with light And stained them through with splendour: yet from thence Such awe strikes rapture through the spirit of sense From all the inaccessible sea-wall's girth, That exultation, bright at heart as mirth, Bows deeper down before the beauty of earth Than fear may bow down ever: nor shall one Who meets at Alpine dawn the mounting sun On heights too high for many a wing to climb Be touched with sense of aught seen more sublime Than here smiles high and sweet in face of heaven and time. For here the flower of fire, the soft hoar bloom Of springtide olive-woods, the warm green gloom Of clouded seas that swell and sound with dawn of doom, The keen thwart lightning and the wan grey light Of stormy sunrise crossed and vexed with night, Flash, loom, and laugh with divers hues in one From all the curved cliff's face, till day be done, Against the sea's face and the gazing sun. And whensoever a strong wave, high in hope, Sweeps up some smooth slant breadth of stone aslope, That glowed with duskier fire of hues less bright, Swift as it sweeps back springs to sudden sight The splendour of the moist rock's fervent light, Fresh as from dew of birth when time was born Out of the world-conceiving womb of morn. All its quenched flames and darkling hues divine Leap into lustrous life and laugh and shine And darken into swift and dim decline For one brief breath's space till the next wave run Right up, and ripple down again, undone, And leave it to be kissed and kindled of the sun. And all these things, bright as they shone before Man first set foot on earth or sail from shore, Rose not less radiant than the sun sees now When the autumn sea was cloven of Tristram's prow, And strong in sorrow and hope and woful will That hope might move not nor might sorrow kill He held his way back toward the wild sad shore Whence he should come to look on these no more, Nor ever, save with sunless eyes shut fast, Sail home to sleep in home-born earth at last. And all these things fled fleet as light or breath Past, and his heart waxed cold and dull as death, Or swelled but as the tides of sorrow swell, To sink with sullen sense of slow farewell. So surely seemed the silence even to sigh Assurance of inveterate prophecy, “Thou shalt not come again home hither ere thou die.” And the wind mourned and triumphed, and the sea Wailed and took heart and trembled; nor might he Hear more of comfort in their speech, or see More certitude in all the waste world's range Than the only certitude of death and change. And as the sense and semblance fluctuated Of all things heard and seen alive or dead That smote far off upon his ears or eyes Or memory mixed with forecasts fain to rise And fancies faint as ghostliest prophecies, So seemed his own soul, changefully forlorn, To shrink and triumph and mount up and mourn; Yet all its fitful waters, clothed with night, Lost heart not wholly, lacked not wholly light, Seeing over life and death one star in sight Where evening's gates as fair as morning's ope, Whose name was memory, but whose flame was hope. For all the tides of thought that rose and sank Felt its fair strength wherefrom strong sorrow shrank A mightier trust than time could change or cloy, More strong than sorrow, more secure than joy. So came he, nor content nor all unblest, Back to the grey old land of Merlin's rest. But ere six paces forth on shore he trod Before him stood a knight with feet unshod, And kneeling called upon him, as on God Might sick men call for pity, praying aloud With hands held up and head made bare and bowed; “Tristram, for God's love and thine own dear fame, I Tristram that am one with thee in name And one in heart with all that praise thee—I, Most woful man of all that may not die For heartbreak and the heavier scourge of shame, By all thy glory done our woful name Beseech thee, called of all men gentlest knight, Be now not slow to do my sorrows right. I charge thee for thy fame's sake through this land, I pray thee by thine own wife's fair white hand, Have pity of me whose love is borne away By one that makes of poor men's lives his prey, A felon masked with knighthood: at his side Seven brethren hath he night or day to ride With seven knights more that wait on all his will: And here at hand, ere yet one day fulfil Its flight through light and darkness, shall they fare Forth, and my bride among them, whom they bear Through these wild lands his prisoner; and if now I lose her, and my prayer be vain, and thou Less fain to serve love's servants than of yore, Then surely shall I see her face no more. But if thou wilt, for love's sake of the bride Who lay most loved of women at thy side, Strike with me, straight then hence behoves us ride And rest between the moorside and the sea Where we may smite them passing: but for me, Poor stranger, me not worthy scarce to touch Thy kind strong hand, how shouldst thou do so much? For now lone left this long time waits thy wife And lacks her lord and light of wedded life Whilst thou far off art famous: yet thy fame, If thou take pity on me that bear thy name Unworthily, but by that name implore Thy grace, how shall not even thy fame grow more? But be thy will as God's among us done, Who art far in fame above us as the sun: Yet only of him have all men help and grace.” And all the lordly light of Tristram's face Was softened as the sun's in kindly spring. “Nay, then may God send me as evil a thing When I give ear not to such prayers,” he said, “And make my place among the nameless dead When I put back one hour the time to smite And do the unrighteous griefs of good men right. Behold, I will not enter in nor rest Here in mine own halls till this piteous quest Find end ere noon to-morrow: but do thou, Whose sister's face I may not look on now, Go, Ganhardine, with tiding of the vow That bids me turn aside for one day's strife Or live dishonoured all my days of life, And greet for me in brother's wise my wife, And crave her pardon that for knighthood's sake And womanhood's, whose bands may no man break And keep the bands of bounden honour fast, I seek not her till two nights yet be past And this my quest accomplished, so God please By me to give this young man's anguish ease And on his wrongdoer's head his wrong requite.” And Tristram with that woful thankful knight Rode by the seaside moorland wastes away Between the quickening night and darkening day Ere half the gathering stars had heart to shine. And lightly toward his sister Ganhardine Sped, where she sat and gazed alone afar Above the grey sea for the sunset star, And lightly kissed her hand and lightly spake His tiding of that quest for knighthood's sake. And the white-handed Iseult, bowing her head, Gleamed on him with a glance athwart, and said, “As God's on earth and far above the sun, So toward his handmaid be my lord's will done.” And doubts too dim to question or divine Touched as with shade the spirit of Ganhardine, Hearing; and scarce for half a doubtful breath His bright light heart held half a thought of death And knew not whence this darkling thought might be, But surely not his sister's work: for she Was ever sweet and good as summer air, And soft as dew when all the night is fair, And gracious as the golden maiden moon When darkness craves her blessing: so full soon His mind was light again as leaping waves, Nor dreamed that hers was like a field of graves Where no man's foot dares swerve to left or right, Nor ear dares hearken, nor dares eye take sight Of aught that moves and murmurs there at night. But by the sea-banks where at morn their foes Might find them, lay those knightly name-fellows, One sick with grief of heart and sleepless, one With heart of hope triumphant as the sun Dreaming asleep of love and fame and fight: But sleep at last wrapped warm the wan young knight; And Tristram with the first pale windy light Woke ere the sun spake summons, and his ear Caught the sea's call that fired his heart to hear, A noise of waking waters: for till dawn The sea was silent as a mountain lawn When the wind speaks not, and the pines are dumb, And summer takes her fill ere autumn come Of life more soft than slumber: but ere day Rose, and the first beam smote the bounding bay, Up sprang the strength of the dark East, and took With its wide wings the waters as they shook, And hurled them huddling on aheap, and cast The full sea shoreward with a great glad blast, Blown from the heart of morning: and with joy Full-souled and perfect passion, as a boy That leaps up light to wrestle with the sea For pure heart's gladness and large ecstasy, Up sprang the might of Tristram; and his soul Yearned for delight within him, and waxed whole As a young child's with rapture of the hour That brought his spirit and all the world to flower, And all the bright blood in his veins beat time To the wind's clarion and the water's chime That called him and he followed it and stood On the sand's verge before the grey great flood Where the white hurtling heads of waves that met Rose unsaluted of the sunrise yet. And from his heart's root outward shot the sweet Strong joy that thrilled him to the hands and feet, Filling his limbs with pleasure and glad might, And his soul drank the immeasurable delight That earth drinks in with morning, and the free Limitless love that lifts the stirring sea When on her bare bright bosom as a bride She takes the young sun, perfect in his pride, Home to his place with passion: and the heart Trembled for joy within the man whose part Was here not least in living; and his mind Was rapt abroad beyond man's meaner kind And pierced with love of all things and with mirth Moved to make one with heaven and heavenlike earth And with the light live water. So awhile He watched the dim sea with a deepening smile, And felt the sound and savour and swift flight Of waves that fled beneath the fading night And died before the darkness, like a song With harps between and trumpets blown along Through the loud air of some triumphant day, Sink through his spirit and purge all sense away Save of the glorious gladness of his hour And all the world about to break in flower Before the sovereign laughter of the sun; And he, ere night's wide work lay all undone, As earth from her bright body casts off night, Cast off his raiment for a rapturous fight And stood between the sea's edge and the sea Naked, and godlike of his mould as he Whose swift foot's sound shook all the towers of Troy; So clothed with might, so girt upon with joy As, ere the knife had shorn to feed the fire His glorious hair before the unkindled pyre Whereon the half of his great heart was laid, Stood, in the light of his live limbs arrayed, Child of heroic earth and heavenly sea, The flower of all men: scarce less bright than he, If any of all men latter-born might stand, Stood Tristram, silent, on the glimmering strand. Not long: but with a cry of love that rang As from a trumpet golden-mouthed, he sprang, As toward a mother's where his head might rest Her child rejoicing, toward the strong sea's breast That none may gird nor measure: and his heart Sent forth a shout that bade his lips not part, But triumphed in him silent: no man's voice, No song, no sound of clarions that rejoice, Can set that glory forth which fills with fire The body and soul that have their whole desire Silent, and freer than birds or dreams are free Take all their will of all the encountering sea. And toward the foam he bent and forward smote, Laughing, and launched his body like a boat Full to the sea-breach, and against the tide Struck strongly forth with amorous arms made wide To take the bright breast of the wave to his And on his lips the sharp sweet minute's kiss Given of the wave's lip for a breath's space curled And pure as at the daydawn of the world. And round him all the bright rough shuddering sea Kindled, as though the world were even as he, Heart-stung with exultation of desire: And all the life that moved him seemed to aspire, As all the sea's life toward the sun: and still Delight within him waxed with quickening will More smooth and strong and perfect as a flame That springs and spreads, till each glad limb became A note of rapture in the tune of life, Live music mild and keen as sleep and strife: Till the sweet change that bids the sense grow sure Of deeper depth and purity more pure Wrapped him and lapped him round with clearer cold, And all the rippling green grew royal gold Between him and the far sun's rising rim. And like the sun his heart rejoiced in him, And brightened with a broadening flame of mirth: And hardly seemed its life a part of earth, But the life kindled of a fiery birth And passion of a new-begotten son Between the live sea and the living sun. And mightier grew the joy to meet full-faced Each wave, and mount with upward plunge, and taste The rapture of its rolling strength, and cross Its flickering crown of snows that flash and toss Like plumes in battle's blithest charge, and thence To match the next with yet more strenuous sense; Till on his eyes the light beat hard and bade His face turn west and shoreward through the glad Swift revel of the waters golden-clad, And back with light reluctant heart he bore Across the broad-backed rollers in to shore; Strong-spirited for the chance and cheer of fight, And donned his arms again, and felt the might In all his limbs rejoice for strength, and praised God for such life as that whereon he gazed, And wist not surely its joy was even as fleet As that which laughed and lapsed against his feet, The bright thin grey foam-blossom, glad and hoar, That flings its flower along the flowerless shore On sand or shingle, and still with sweet strange snows, As where one great white storm-dishevelled rose May rain her wild leaves on a windy land, Strews for long leagues the sounding slope of strand, And flower on flower falls flashing, and anew A fresh light leaps up whence the last flash flew, And casts its brief glad gleam of life away To fade not flowerwise but as drops the day Storm-smitten, when at once the dark devours Heaven and the sea and earth with all their flowers; No star in heaven, on earth no rose to see, But the white blown brief blossoms of the sea, That make her green gloom starrier than the sky, Dance yet before the tempest's tune, and die. And all these things he glanced upon, and knew How fair they shone, from earth's least flake of dew To stretch of seas and imminence of skies, Unwittingly, with unpresageful eyes, For the last time. The world's half heavenly face, The music of the silence of the place, The confluence and the refluence of the sea, The wind's note ringing over wold and lea, Smote once more through him keen as fire that smote, Rang once more through him one reverberate note, That faded as he turned again and went, Fulfilled by strenuous joy with strong content, To take his last delight of labour done That yet should be beholden of the sun Or ever give man comfort of his hand. Beside a wood's edge in the broken land An hour at wait the twain together stood, Till swift between the moorside and the wood Flashed the spears forward of the coming train; And seeing beside the strong chief spoiler's rein His wan love riding prisoner in the crew, Forth with a cry the young man leapt, and flew Right on that felon sudden as a flame; And hard at hand the mightier Tristram came, Bright as the sun and terrible as fire: And there had sword and spear their soul's desire, And blood that quenched the spear's thirst as it poured Slaked royally the hunger of the sword, Till the fierce heart of steel could scarce fulfil Its greed and ravin of insatiate will. For three the fiery spear of Tristram drove Down ere a point of theirs his harness clove Or its own sheer mid shaft splintered in twain; And his heart bounded in him, and was fain As fire or wind that takes its fill by night Of tempest and of triumph: so the knight Rejoiced and ranged among them, great of hand, Till seven lay slain upon the heathery sand Or in the dense breadth of the woodside fern. Nor did his heart not mightier in him burn Seeing at his hand that young knight fallen, and high The red sword reared again that bade him die. But on the slayer exulting like the flame Whose foot foreshines the thunder Tristram came Raging, for piteous wrath had made him fire; And as a lion's look his face was dire That flashed against his foeman ere the sword Lightened, and wrought the heart's will of its lord, And clove through casque and crown the wrongdoer's head. And right and left about their dark chief dead Hurtled and hurled those felons to and fro, Till as a storm-wind scatters leaves and snow His right hand ravening scattered them; but one That fled with sidelong glance athwart the sun Shot, and the shaft flew sure, and smote aright, Full in the wound's print of his great first fight When at his young strength's peril he made free Cornwall, and slew beside its bordering sea The fair land's foe, who yielding up his breath Yet left him wounded nigh to dark slow death. And hardly with long toil thence he won home Between the grey moor and the glimmering foam, And halting fared through his own gate, and fell, Thirsting: for as the sleepless fire of hell The fire within him of his wound again Burned, and his face was dark as death for pain, And blind the blithe light of his eyes: but they Within that watched and wist not of the fray Came forth and cried aloud on him for woe. And scarce aloud his thanks fell faint and slow As men reared up the strong man fallen and bore Down the deep hall that looked along the shore, And laid him soft abed, and sought in vain If herb or hand of leech might heal his pain. And the white-handed Iseult hearkening heard All, and drew nigh, and spake no wifely word, But gazed upon him doubtfully, with eyes Clouded; and he in kindly knightly wise Spake with scant breath, and smiling: “Surely this Is penance for discourteous lips to kiss And feel the brand burn through them, here to lie And lack the strength here to do more than sigh And hope not hence for pardon.” Then she bowed Her head, still silent as a stooping cloud, And laid her lips against his face; and he Felt sink a shadow across him as the sea Might feel a cloud stoop toward it: and his heart Darkened as one that wastes by sorcerous art And knows not whence it withers: and he turned Back from her emerald eyes his own, and yearned All night for eyes all golden: and the dark Hung sleepless round him till the loud first lark Rang record forth once more of darkness done, And all things born took comfort from the sun. IX THE SAILING OF THE SWAN Fate, that was born ere spirit and flesh were made, The fire that fills man's life with light and shade; The power beyond all godhead which puts on All forms of multitudinous unison, A raiment of eternal change inwrought With shapes and hues more subtly spun than thought, Where all things old bear fruit of all things new And one deep chord throbs all the music through, The chord of change unchanging, shadow and light Inseparable as reverberate day from night; Fate, that of all things save the soul of man Is lord and God since body and soul began; Fate, that keeps all the tune of things in chime; Fate, that breathes power upon the lips of time; That smites and soothes with heavy and healing hand All joys and sorrows born in life's dim land, Till joy be found a shadow and sorrow a breath And life no discord in the tune with death, But all things fain alike to die and live In pulse and lapse of tides alternative, Through silence and through sound of peace and strife, Till birth and death be one in sight of life; Fate, heard and seen of no man's eyes or ears, To no man shown through light of smiles or tears, And moved of no man's prayer to fold its wings; Fate, that is night and light on worldly things; Fate, that is fire to burn and sea to drown, Strength to build up and thunder to cast down; Fate, shield and screen for each man's lifelong head, And sword at last or dart that strikes it dead; Fate, higher than heaven and deeper than the grave, That saves and spares not, spares and doth not save; Fate, that in gods' wise is not bought and sold For prayer or price of penitence or gold; Whose law shall live when life bids earth farewell, Whose justice hath for shadows heaven and hell; Whose judgment into no god's hand is given, Nor is its doom not more than hell or heaven: Fate, that is pure of love and clean of hate, Being equal-eyed as nought may be but fate; Through many and weary days of foiled desire Leads life to rest where tears no more take fire; Through many and weary dreams of quenched delight Leads life through death past sense of day and night. Nor shall they feel or fear, whose date is done, Aught that made once more dark the living sun And bitterer in their breathing lips the breath Than the dark dawn and bitter dust of death. For all the light, with fragrance as of flowers, That clothes the lithe live limbs of separate hours, More sweet to savour and more clear to sight Dawns on the soul death's undivided night. No vigils has that perfect night to keep, No fever-fits of vision shake that sleep. Nor if they wake, and any place there be Wherein the soul may feel her wings beat free Through air too clear and still for sound or strife If life were haply death, and death be life; If love with yet some lovelier laugh revive, And song relume the light it bore alive, And friendship, found of all earth's gifts most good, Stand perfect in perpetual brotherhood; If aught indeed at all of all this be, Though none might say nor any man might see, Might he that sees the shade thereof not say This dream were trustier than the truth of day. Nor haply may not hope, with heart more clear, Burn deathward, and the doubtful soul take cheer, Seeing through the channelled darkness yearn a star Whose eyebeams are not as the morning's are, Transient, and subjugate of lordlier light, But all unconquerable by noon or night, Being kindled only of life's own inmost fire, Truth, stablished and made sure by strong desire, Fountain of all things living, source and seed, Force that perforce transfigures dream to deed, God that begets on time, the body of death, Eternity: nor may man's darkening breath, Albeit it stain, disfigure or destroy The glass wherein the soul sees life and joy Only, with strength renewed and spirit of youth, And brighter than the sun's the body of Truth Eternal, unimaginable of man, Whose very face not Thought's own eyes may scan, But see far off his radiant feet at least, Trampling the head of Fear, the false high priest, Whose broken chalice foams with blood no more, And prostrate on that high priest's chancel floor, Bruised, overthrown, blind, maimed, with bloodless rod, The miscreation of his miscreant God. That sovereign shadow cast of souls that dwell In darkness and the prison-house of hell Whose walls are built of deadly dread, and bound The gates thereof with dreams as iron round, And all the bars therein and stanchions wrought Of shadow forged like steel and tempered thought And words like swords and thunder-clouded creeds And faiths more dire than sin's most direful deeds: That shade accursed and worshipped, which hath made The soul of man that brought it forth a shade Black as the womb of darkness, void and vain, A throne for fear, a pasturage for pain, Impotent, abject, clothed upon with lies, A foul blind fume of words and prayers that rise, Aghast and harsh, abhorrent and abhorred, Fierce as its God, blood-saturate as its Lord; With loves and mercies on its lips that hiss Comfort, and kill compassion with a kiss, And strike the world black with their blasting breath; That ghost whose core of life is very death And all its light of heaven a shadow of hell, Fades, falls, wanes, withers by none other spell But theirs whose eyes and ears have seen and heard Not the face naked, not the perfect word, But the bright sound and feature felt from far Of life which feeds the spirit and the star, Thrills the live light of all the suns that roll, And stirs the still sealed springs of every soul. Three dim days through, three slumberless nights long, Perplexed at dawn, oppressed at evensong, The strong man's soul now sealed indeed with pain, And all its springs half dried with drought, had lain Prisoner within the fleshly dungeon-dress Sore chafed and wasted with its weariness. And fain it would have found the star, and fain Made this funereal prison-house of pain A watch-tower whence its eyes might sweep, and see If any place for any hope might be Beyond the hells and heavens of sleep and strife, Or any light at all of any life Beyond the dense false darkness woven above, And could not, lacking grace to look on love, And in the third night's dying hour he spake, Seeing scarce the seals that bound the dayspring break And scarce the daystar burn above the sea: “O Ganhardine, my brother true to me, I charge thee by those nights and days we knew No great while since in England, by the dew That bathed those nights with blessing, and the fire That thrilled those days as music thrills a lyre, Do now for me perchance the last good deed That ever love may crave or life may need Ere love lay life in ashes: take to thee My ship that shows aloft against the sea Carved on her stem the semblance of a swan, And ere the waves at even again wax wan Pass, if it may be, to my lady's land, And give this ring into her secret hand, And bid her think how hard on death I lie, And fain would look upon her face and die. But as a merchant's laden be the bark With royal ware for fraughtage, that King Mark May take for toll thereof some costly thing; And when this gift finds grace before the king, Choose forth a cup, and put therein my ring Where sureliest only of one it may be seen, And bid her handmaid bear it to the queen For earnest of thine homage: then shall she Fear, and take counsel privily with thee, To know what errand there is thine from me And what my need in secret of her sight. But make thee two sails, one like sea-foam white To spread for signal if thou bring her back, And if she come not see the sail be black, That I may know or ever thou take land If these my lips may die upon her hand Or hers may never more be mixed with mine.” And his heart quailed for grief in Ganhardine, Hearing; and all his brother bade he swore Surely to do, and straight fare forth from shore. But the white-handed Iseult hearkening heard All, and her heart waxed hot, and every word Thereon seemed graven and printed in her thought As lines with fire and molten iron wrought. And hard within her heavy heart she cursed Both, and her life was turned to fiery thirst, And all her soul was hunger, and its breath Of hope and life a blast of raging death. For only in hope of evil was her life. So bitter burned within the unchilded wife A virgin lust for vengeance, and such hate Wrought in her now the fervent work of fate. Then with a south-west wind the Swan set forth, And over wintering waters bore to north, And round the wild land's windy westward end Up the blown channel bade her bright way bend East on toward high Tintagel: where at dark Landing, fair welcome found they of King Mark, And Ganhardine with Brangwain as of old Spake, and she took the cup of chiselled gold Wherein lay secret Tristram's trothplight ring, And bare it unbeholden of the king Even to her lady's hand, which hardly took A gift whereon a queen's eyes well might look, With grace forlorn of weary gentleness. But, seeing, her life leapt in her, keen to guess The secret of the symbol: and her face Flashed bright with blood whence all its grief-worn grace Took fire and kindled to the quivering hair. And in the dark soft hour of starriest air Thrilled through with sense of midnight, when the world Feels the wide wings of sleep about it furled, Down stole the queen, deep-muffled to her wan Mute restless lips, and came where yet the Swan Swung fast at anchor: whence by starlight she Hoised snowbright sails, and took the glimmering sea. But all the long night long more keen and sore His wound's grief waxed in Tristram evermore, And heavier always hung his heart asway Between dim fear and clouded hope of day. And still with face and heart at silent strife Beside him watched the maiden called his wife, Patient, and spake not save when scarce he spake, Murmuring with sense distraught and spirit awake Speech bitterer than the words thereof were sweet: And hatred thrilled her to the hands and feet, Listening: for alway back reiterate came The passionate faint burden of her name. Nor ever through the labouring lips astir Came any word of any thought of her. But the soul wandering struggled and clung hard Only to dreams of joy in Joyous Gard Or wildwood nights beside the Cornish strand, Or Merlin's holier sleep here hard at hand Wrapped round with deep soft spells in dim Broceliande. And with such thirst as joy's drained wine-cup leaves When fear to hope as hope to memory cleaves His soul desired the dewy sense of leaves, The soft green smell of thickets drenched with dawn. The faint slot kindling on the fiery lawn As day's first hour made keen the spirit again That lured and spurred on quest his hound Hodain, The breeze, the bloom, the splendour and the sound, That stung like fire the hunter and the hound, The pulse of wind, the passion of the sea, The rapture of the woodland: then would he Sigh, and as one that fain would all be dead Heavily turn his heavy-laden head Back, and close eyes for comfort, finding none. And fain he would have died or seen the sun, Being sick at heart of darkness: yet afresh Began the long strong strife of spirit and flesh And branching pangs of thought whose branches bear The bloodred fruit whose core is black, despair. And the wind slackened and again grew great, Palpitant as men's pulses palpitate Between the flowing and ebbing tides of fate That wash their lifelong waifs of weal and woe Through night and light and twilight to and fro. Now as a pulse of hope its heartbeat throbbed, Now like one stricken shrank and sank and sobbed, Then, yearning as with child of death, put forth A wail that filled the night up south and north With woful sound of waters: and he said, “So might the wind wail if the world were dead And its wings wandered over nought but sea. I would I knew she would not come to me, For surely she will come not: then should I, Once knowing I shall not look upon her, die. I knew not life could so long breathe such breath As I do. Nay, what grief were this, if death, The sole sure friend of whom the whole world saith He lies not, nor hath ever this been said, That death would heal not grief—if death were dead And all ways closed whence grief might pass with life!” Then softly spake his watching virgin wife Out of her heart, deep down below her breath: “Fear not but death shall come—and after death Judgment.” And he that heard not answered her, Saying—“Ah, but one there was, if truth not err, For true men's trustful tongues have said it—one Whom these mine eyes knew living while the sun Looked yet upon him, and mine own ears heard The deep sweet sound once of his godlike word— Who sleeps and dies not, but with soft live breath Takes always all the deep delight of death, Through love's gift of a woman: but for me Love's hand is not the hand of Nimue, Love's word no still smooth murmur of the dove, No kiss of peace for me the kiss of love. Nor, whatsoe'er thy life's love ever give, Dear, shall it ever bid me sleep or live; Nor from thy brows and lips and living breast As his from Nimue's shall my soul take rest; Not rest but unrest hath our long love given— Unrest on earth that wins not rest in heaven. What rest may we take ever? what have we Had ever more of peace than has the sea? Has not our life been as a wind that blows Through lonelier lands than rear the wild white rose That each year sees requickened, but for us Time once and twice hath here or there done thus And left the next year following empty and bare? What rose hath our last year's rose left for heir, What wine our last year's vintage? and to me More were one fleet forbidden sense of thee, One perfume of thy present grace, one thought Made truth one hour, ere all mine hours be nought, One very word, breath, look, sign, touch of hand, Than all the green leaves in Broceliande Full of sweet sound, full of sweet wind and sun; O God, thou knowest I would no more but one, I would no more but once more ere I die Find thus much mercy. Nay, but then were I Happier than he whom there thy grace hath found, For thine it must be, this that wraps him round, Thine only, albeit a fiend's force gave him birth, Thine that has given him heritage on earth Of slumber-sweet eternity to keep Fast in soft hold of everliving sleep. Happier were I, more sinful man, than he, Whom one love-worthier then than Nimue Should with a breath make blest among the dead.” And the wan wedded maiden answering said, Soft as hate speaks within itself apart: “Surely ye shall not, ye that rent mine heart, Being one in sin, in punishment be twain.” And the great knight that heard not spake again And sighed, but sweet thought of sweet things gone by Kindled with fire of joy the very sigh And touched it through with rapture: “Ay, this were How much more than the sun and sunbright air, How much more than the springtide, how much more Than sweet strong sea-wind quickening wave and shore With one divine pulse of continuous breath, If she might kiss me with the kiss of death, And make the light of life by death's look dim!” And the white wedded virgin answered him, Inwardly, wan with hurt no herb makes whole: “Yea surely, ye whose sin hath slain my soul, Surely your own souls shall have peace in death And pass with benediction in their breath And blessing given of mine their sin hath slain.” And Tristram with sore yearning spake again, Saying: “Yea, might this thing once be, how should I, With all my soul made one thanksgiving, die, And pass before what judgment-seat may be, And cry, ‘Lord, now do all thou wilt with me, Take all thy fill of justice, work thy will; Though all thy heart of wrath have all its fill, My heart of suffering shall endure, and say, For that thou gavest me living yesterday I bless thee though thou curse me.’ Ay, and well Might one cast down into the gulf of hell, Remembering this, take heart and thank his fate— That God, whose doom now scourges him with hate Once, in the wild and whirling world above, Bade mercy kiss his dying lips with love. But if this come not, then he doth me wrong. For what hath love done, all this long life long That death should trample down his poor last prayer Who prays not for forgiveness? Though love were Sin dark as hate, have we not here that sinned Suffered? has that been less than wintry wind Wherewith our love lies blasted? O mine own, O mine and no man's yet save mine alone, Iseult! what ails thee that I lack so long All of thee, all things thine for which I long? For more than watersprings to shadeless sands, More to me were the comfort of her hands Touched once, and more than rays that set and rise The glittering arrows of her glorious eyes, More to my sense than fire to dead cold air The wind and light and odour of her hair, More to my soul than summer's to the south The mute clear music of her amorous mouth, And to my heart's heart more than heaven's great rest The fullness of the fragrance of her breast. Iseult, Iseult, what grace hath life to give More than we twain have had of life, and live? Iseult, Iseult, what grace may death not keep As sweet for us to win of death, and sleep? Come therefore, let us twain pass hence and try If it be better not to live but die, With love for lamp to light us out of life.” And on that word his wedded maiden wife, Pale as the moon in star-forsaken skies Ere the sun fill them, rose with set strange eyes And gazed on him that saw not: and her heart Heaved as a man's death-smitten with a dart That smites him sleeping, warm and full of life: So toward her lord that was not looked his wife, His wife that was not: and her heart within Burnt bitter like an aftertaste of sin To one whose memory drinks and loathes the lee Of shame or sorrow deeper than the sea: And no fear touched him of her eyes above And ears that hoarded each poor word whence love Made sweet the broken music of his breath. “Iseult, my life that wast and art my death, My life in life that hast been, and that art Death in my death, sole wound that cleaves mine heart, Mine heart that else, how spent soe'er, were whole, Breath of my spirit and anguish of my soul, How can this be that hence thou canst not hear, Being but by space divided? One is here, But one of twain I looked at once to see; Shall death keep time and thou not keep with me?” And the white married maiden laughed at heart, Hearing, and scarce with lips at all apart Spake, and as fire between them was her breath; “Yea, now thou liest not: yea, for I am death.” By this might eyes that watched without behold Deep in the gulfs of aching air acold The roses of the dawning heaven that strew The low soft sun's way ere his power shine through And burn them up with fire: but far to west Had sunk the dead moon on the live sea's breast, Slain as with bitter fear to see the sun: And eastward was a strong bright wind begun Between the clouds and waters: and he said, Seeing hardly through dark dawn her doubtful head, “Iseult?” and like a death-bell faint and clear The virgin voice rang answer—“I am here.” And his heart sprang, and sank again: and she Spake, saying, “What would my knightly lord with me?” And Tristram: “Hath my lady watched all night Beside me, and I knew not? God requite Her love for comfort shown a man nigh dead.” “Yea, God shall surely guerdon it,” she said, “Who hath kept me all my days through to this hour.” And Tristram: “God alone hath grace and power To pay such grace toward one unworthier shown Than ever durst, save only of God alone, Crave pardon yet and comfort, as I would Crave now for charity if my heart were good, But as a coward's it fails me, even for shame.” Then seemed her face a pale funereal flame That burns down slow by midnight, as she said: “Speak, and albeit thy bidding spake me dead, God's love renounce me if it were not done.” And Tristram: “When the sea-line takes the sun That now should be not far off sight from far, Look if there come not with the morning star My ship bound hither from the northward back, And if the sail be white thereof or black.” And knowing the soothfast sense of his desire So sore the heart within her raged like fire She could not wring forth of her lips a word, But bowing made sign how humbly had she heard. And the sign given made light his heart; and she Set her face hard against the yearning sea Now all athirst with trembling trust of hope To see the sudden gates of sunrise ope; But thirstier yearned the heart whose fiery gate Lay wide that vengeance might come in to hate. And Tristram lay at thankful rest, and thought Now surely life nor death could grieve him aught, Since past was now life's anguish as a breath, And surely past the bitterness of death. For seeing he had found at these her hands this grace, It could not be but yet some breathing-space Might leave him life to look again on love's own face. “Since if for death's sake,” in his heart he said, “Even she take pity upon me quick or dead, How shall not even from God's hand be compassion shed? For night bears dawn, how weak soe'er and wan, And sweet ere death, men fable, sings the swan. So seems the Swan my signal from the sea To sound a song that sweetens death to me Clasped round about with radiance from above Of dawn, and closer clasped on earth by love. Shall all things brighten, and this my sign be dark?” And high from heaven suddenly rang the lark, Triumphant; and the far first refluent ray Filled all the hollow darkness full with day. And on the deep sky's verge a fluctuant light Gleamed, grew, shone, strengthened into perfect sight, As bowed and dipped and rose again the sail's clear white. And swift and steadfast as a sea-mew's wing It neared before the wind, as fain to bring Comfort, and shorten yet its narrowing track. And she that saw looked hardly toward him back, Saying, “Ay, the ship comes surely; but her sail is black.” And fain he would have sprung upright, and seen, And spoken: but strong death struck sheer between, And darkness closed as iron round his head: And smitten through the heart lay Tristram dead. And scarce the word had flown abroad, and wail Risen, ere to shoreward came the snowbright sail, And lightly forth leapt Ganhardine on land, And led from ship with swift and reverent hand Iseult: and round them up from all the crowd Broke the great wail for Tristram out aloud. And ere her ear might hear her heart had heard, Nor sought she sign for witness of the word; But came and stood above him newly dead, And felt his death upon her: and her head Bowed, as to reach the spring that slakes all drouth; And their four lips became one silent mouth. So came their hour on them that were in life Tristram and Iseult: so from love and strife The stroke of love's own hand felt last and best Gave them deliverance to perpetual rest. So, crownless of the wreaths that life had wound, They slept, with flower of tenderer comfort crowned; From bondage and the fear of time set free, And all the yoke of space on earth and sea Cast as a curb for ever: nor might now Fear and desire bid soar their souls or bow, Lift up their hearts or break them: doubt nor grief More now might move them, dread nor disbelief Touch them with shadowy cold or fiery sting, Nor sleepless languor with its weary wing, Nor harsh estrangement, born of time's vain breath, Nor change, a darkness deeper far than death. And round the sleep that fell around them then Earth lies not wrapped, nor records wrought of men Rise up for timeless token: but their sleep Hath round it like a raiment all the deep; No change or gleam or gloom of sun and rain, But all time long the might of all the main Spread round them as round earth soft heaven is spread, And peace more strong than death round all the dead. For death is of an hour, and after death Peace: nor for aught that fear or fancy saith, Nor even for very love's own sake, shall strife Perplex again that perfect peace with life. And if, as men that mourn may deem or dream, Rest haply here than there might sweeter seem, And sleep, that lays one hand on all, more good By some sweet grave's grace given of wold or wood Or clear high glen or sunbright wind-worn down Than where life thunders through the trampling town With daylong feet and nightlong overhead, What grave may cast such grace round any dead, What so sublime sweet sepulchre may be For all that life leaves mortal, as the sea? And these, rapt forth perforce from earthly ground, These twain the deep sea guards, and girdles round Their sleep more deep than any sea's gulf lies, Though changeless with the change in shifting skies, Nor mutable with seasons: for the grave That held them once, being weaker than a wave, The waves long since have buried: though their tomb Was royal that by ruth's relenting doom Men gave them in Tintagel: for the word Took wing which thrilled all piteous hearts that heard The word wherethrough their lifelong lot stood shown, And when the long sealed springs of fate were known, The blind bright innocence of lips that quaffed Love, and the marvel of the mastering draught, And all the fraughtage of the fateful bark, Loud like a child upon them wept King Mark, Seeing round the sword's hilt which long since had fought For Cornwall's love a scroll of writing wrought, A scripture writ of Tristram's hand, wherein Lay bare the sinless source of all their sin, No choice of will, but chance and sorcerous art, With prayer of him for pardon: and his heart Was molten in him, wailing as he kissed Each with the kiss of kinship—“Had I wist, Ye had never sinned nor died thus, nor had I Borne in this doom that bade you sin and die So sore a part of sorrow.” And the king Built for their tomb a chapel bright like spring With flower-soft wealth of branching tracery made Fair as the frondage each fleet year sees fade, That should not fall till many a year were done. There slept they wedded under moon and sun And change of stars: and through the casements came Midnight and noon girt round with shadow and flame To illume their grave or veil it: till at last On these things too was doom as darkness cast: For the strong sea hath swallowed wall and tower, And where their limbs were laid in woful hour For many a fathom gleams and moves and moans The tide that sweeps above their coffined bones In the wrecked chancel by the shivered shrine: Nor where they sleep shall moon or sunlight shine Nor man look down for ever: none shall say, Here once, or here, Tristram and Iseult lay: But peace they have that none may gain who live, And rest about them that no love can give, And over them, while death and life shall be, The light and sound and darkness of the sea. THE TALE OF BALEN DEDICATION TO MY MOTHER Love that holds life and death in fee, Deep as the clear unsounded sea And sweet as life or death can be, Lays here my hope, my heart, and me Before you, silent, in a song. Since the old wild tale, made new, found grace, When half sung through, before your face, It needs must live a springtide space, While April suns grow strong. March 24, 1896. I In hawthorn-time the heart grows light, The world is sweet in sound and sight, Glad thoughts and birds take flower and flight, The heather kindles toward the light, The whin is frankincense and flame. And be it for strife or be it for love The falcon quickens as the dove When earth is touched from heaven above With joy that knows no name. And glad in spirit and sad in soul With dream and doubt of days that roll As waves that race and find no goal Rode on by bush and brake and bole A northern child of earth and sea. The pride of life before him lay Radiant: the heavens of night and day Shone less than shone before his way His ways and days to be. And all his life of blood and breath Sang out within him: time and death Were even as words a dreamer saith When sleep within him slackeneth, And light and life and spring were one. The steed between his knees that sprang, The moors and woods that shone and sang, The hours wherethrough the spring's breath rang, Seemed ageless as the sun. But alway through the bounteous bloom That earth gives thanks if heaven illume His soul forefelt a shadow of doom, His heart foreknew a gloomier gloom Than closes all men's equal ways. Albeit the spirit of life's light spring With pride of heart upheld him, king And lord of hours like snakes that sting And nights that darken days. And as the strong spring round him grew Stronger, and all blithe winds that blew Blither, and flowers that flowered anew More glad of sun and air and dew, The shadow lightened on his soul And brightened into death and died Like winter, as the bloom waxed wide From woodside on to riverside And southward goal to goal. Along the wandering ways of Tyne, By beech and birch and thorn that shine And laugh when life's requickening wine Makes night and noon and dawn divine And stirs in all the veins of spring, And past the brightening banks of Tees, He rode as one that breathes and sees A sun more blithe, a merrier breeze, A life that hails him king. And down the softening south that knows No more how glad the heather glows, Nor how, when winter's clarion blows Across the bright Northumbrian snows, Sea-mists from east and westward meet, Past Avon senseless yet of song And Thames that bore but swans in throng He rode elate in heart and strong In trust of days as sweet. So came he through to Camelot, Glad, though for shame his heart waxed hot, For hope within it withered not To see the shaft it dreamed of shot Fair toward the glimmering goal of fame. And all King Arthur's knightliest there Approved him knightly, swift to dare And keen to bid their records bear Sir Balen's northern name. Sir Balen of Northumberland Gat grace before the king to stand High as his heart was, and his hand Wrought honour toward the strange north strand That sent him south so goodly a knight. And envy, sick with sense of sin, Began as poisonous herbs begin To work in base men's blood, akin To men's of nobler might. And even so fell it that his doom, For all his bright life's kindling bloom And light that took no thought for gloom, Fell as a breath from the opening tomb Full on him ere he wist or thought. For once a churl of royal seed, King Arthur's kinsman, faint in deed And loud in word that knew not heed, Spake shame where shame was nought. “What doth one here in Camelot Whose birth was northward? Wot we not As all his brethren borderers wot How blind of heart, how keen and hot, The wild north lives and hates the south? Men of the narrowing march that knows Nought save the strength of storms and snows, What would these carles where knighthood blows A trump of kinglike mouth?” Swift from his place leapt Balen, smote The liar across his face, and wrote His wrath in blood upon the bloat Brute cheek that challenged shame for note How vile a king-born knave might be. Forth sprang their swords, and Balen slew The knave ere well one witness knew Of all that round them stood or drew What sight was there to see. Then spake the great king's wrathful will A doom for six dark months to fill Wherein close prison held him, still And steadfast-souled for good or ill. But when those weary days lay dead His lordliest knights and barons spake Before the king for Balen's sake Good speech and wise, of force to break The bonds that bowed his head. II In linden-time the heart is high For pride of summer passing by With lordly laughter in her eye; A heavy splendour in the sky Uplifts and bows it down again. The spring had waned from wood and wold Since Balen left his prison hold And lowlier-hearted than of old Beheld it wax and wane. Though humble heart and poor array Kept not from spirit and sense away Their noble nature, nor could slay The pride they bade but pause and stay Till time should bring its trust to flower, Yet even for noble shame's sake, born Of hope that smiled on hate and scorn, He held him still as earth ere morn Ring forth her rapturous hour. But even as earth when dawn takes flight And beats her wings of dewy light Full in the faltering face of night, His soul awoke to claim by right The life and death of deed and doom, When once before the king there came A maiden clad with grief and shame And anguish burning her like flame That feeds on flowers in bloom. Beneath a royal mantle, fair With goodly work of lustrous vair, Girt fast against her side she bare A sword whose weight bade all men there Quail to behold her face again. Save of a passing perfect knight Not great alone in force and fight It might not be for any might Drawn forth, and end her pain. So said she: then King Arthur spake: “Albeit indeed I dare not take Such praise on me, for knighthood's sake And love of ladies will I make Assay if better none may be.” By girdle and by sheath he caught The sheathed and girded sword, and wrought With strength whose force availed him nought To save and set her free. Again she spake: “No need to set The might that man has matched not yet Against it; he whose hand shall get Grace to release the bonds that fret My bosom and my girdlestead With little strain of strength or strife Shall bring me as from death to life And win to sister or to wife Fame that outlives men dead.” Then bade the king his knights assay This mystery that before him lay And mocked his might of manhood. “Nay,” Quoth she, “the man that takes away This burden laid on me must be A knight of record clean and fair As sunlight and the flowerful air, By sire and mother born to bear A name to shame not me.” Then forth strode Launcelot, and laid The mighty-moulded hand that made Strong knights reel back like birds affrayed By storm that smote them as they strayed Against the hilt that yielded not. Then Tristram, bright and sad and kind As one that bore in noble mind Love that made light as darkness blind, Fared even as Launcelot. Then Lamoracke, with hardier cheer, As one that held all hope and fear Wherethrough the spirit of man may steer In life and death less dark or dear, Laid hand thereon, and fared as they. With half a smile his hand he drew Back from the spell-bound thing, and threw With half a glance his heart anew Toward no such blameless may. Between Iseult and Guenevere Sat one of name as high to hear, But darklier doomed than they whose cheer Foreshowed not yet the deadlier year That bids the queenliest head bow down, The queen Morgause of Orkney: they With scarce a flash of the eye could say The very word of dawn, when day Gives earth and heaven their crown. But bright and dark as night or noon And lowering as a storm-flushed moon When clouds and thwarting winds distune The music of the midnight, soon To die from darkening star to star And leave a silence in the skies That yearns till dawn find voice and rise, Shone strange as fate Morgause, with eyes That dwelt on days afar. A glance that shot on Lamoracke As from a storm-cloud bright and black Fire swift and blind as death's own track Turned fleet as flame on Arthur back From him whose hand forsook the hilt: And one in blood and one in sin Their hearts caught fire of pain within And knew no goal for them to win But death that guerdons guilt. Then Gawain, sweet of soul and gay As April ere he dreams of May, Strove, and prevailed not; then Sir Kay, The snake-souled envier, vile as they That fawn and foam and lurk and lie, Sire of the bastard band whose brood Was alway found at servile feud With honour, faint and false and lewd, Scarce grasped and put it by. Then wept for woe the damsel bound With iron and with anguish round, That none to help her grief was found Or loose the inextricably inwound Grim curse that girt her life with grief And made a burden of her breath, Harsh as the bitterness of death. Then spake the king as one that saith Words bitterer even than brief. “Methought the wide round world could bring Before the face of queen or king No knights more fit for fame to sing Than fill this full Round Table's ring With honour higher than pride of place: But now my heart is wrung to know, Damsel, that none whom fame can show Finds grace to heal or help thy woe: God gives them not the grace.” Then from the lowliest place thereby, With heart-enkindled cheek and eye Most like the star and kindling sky That say the sundawn's hour is high When rapture trembles through the sea, Strode Balen in his poor array Forth, and took heart of grace to pray The damsel suffer even him to assay His power to set her free. Nay, how should he avail, she said, Averse with scorn-averted head, Where these availed not? none had sped Of all these mightier men that led The lists wherein he might not ride, And how should less men speed? But he, With lordlier pride of courtesy, Put forth his hand and set her free From pain and humbled pride. But on the sword he gazed elate With hope set higher than fear or fate, Or doubt of darkling days in wait; And when her thankful praise waxed great And craved of him the sword again, He would not give it. “Nay, for mine It is till force may make it thine.” A smile that shone as death may shine Spake toward him bale and bane. Strange lightning flickered from her eyes. “Gentle and good in knightliest guise And meet for quest of strange emprise Thou hast here approved thee: yet not wise To keep the sword from me, I wis. For with it thou shalt surely slay Of all that look upon the day The man best loved of thee, and lay Thine own life down for his.” “What chance God sends, that chance I take,” He said. Then soft and still she spake; “I would but for thine only sake Have back the sword of thee, and break The links of doom that bind thee round. But seeing thou wilt not have it so, My heart for thine is wrung with woe.” “God's will,” quoth he, “it is, we know, Wherewith our lives are bound.” “Repent it must thou soon,” she said, “Who wouldst not hear the rede I read For thine and not for my sake, sped In vain as waters heavenward shed From springs that falter and depart Earthward. God bids not thee believe Truth, and the web thy life must weave For even this sword to close and cleave Hangs heavy round my heart.” So passed she mourning forth. But he, With heart of springing hope set free As birds that breast and brave the sea, Bade horse and arms and armour be Made straightway ready toward the fray. Nor even might Arthur's royal prayer Withhold him, but with frank and fair Thanksgiving and leave-taking there He turned him thence away. III As the east wind, when the morning's breast Gleams like a bird's that leaves the nest, A fledgeling halcyon's bound on quest, Drives wave on wave on wave to west Till all the sea be life and light, So time's mute breath, that brings to bloom All flowers that strew the dead spring's tomb, Drives day on day on day to doom Till all man's day be night. Brief as the breaking of a wave That hurls on man his thunderous grave Ere fear find breath to cry or crave Life that no chance may spare or save, The light of joy and glory shone Even as in dreams where death seems dead Round Balen's hope-exalted head, Shone, passed, and lightened as it fled The shadow of doom thereon. For as he bound him thence to fare, Before the stately presence there A lady like a windflower fair, Girt on with raiment strange and rare That rippled whispering round her, came. Her clear cold eyes, all glassy grey, Seemed lit not with the light of day But touched with gleams that waned away Of quelled and fading flame. Before the king she bowed and spake: “King, for thine old faith's plighted sake To me the lady of the lake, I come in trust of thee to take The guerdon of the gift I gave, Thy sword Excalibur.” And he Made answer: “Be it whate'er it be, If mine to give, I give it thee, Nor need is thine to crave.” As when a gleam of wicked light Turns half a low-lying water bright That moans beneath the shivering night With sense of evil sound and sight And whispering witchcraft's bated breath, Her wan face quickened as she said: “This knight that won the sword—his head I crave or hers that brought it. Dead, Let these be one in death.” “Not with mine honour this may be; Ask all save this thou wilt,” quoth he, “And have thy full desire.” But she Made answer: “Nought will I of thee, Nought if not this.” Then Balen turned, And saw the sorceress hard beside By whose fell craft his mother died: Three years he had sought her, and here espied His heart against her yearned. “Ill be thou met,” he said, “whose ire Would slake with blood thy soul's desire: By thee my mother died in fire; Die thou by me a death less dire.” Sharp flashed his sword forth, fleet as flame, And shore away her sorcerous head. “Alas for shame,” the high king said, “That one found once my friend lies dead; Alas for all our shame! “Thou shouldst have here forborne her; yea, Were all the wrongs that bid men slay Thine, heaped too high for wrath to weigh, Not here before my face to-day Was thine the right to wreak thy wrong.” Still stood he then as one that found His rose of hope by storm discrowned, And all the joy that girt him round Brief as a broken song. Yet ere he passed he turned and spake: “King, only for thy nobler sake Than aught of power man's power may take Or pride of place that pride may break I bid the lordlier man in thee, That lives within the king, give ear. This justice done before thee here On one that hell's own heart holds dear, Needs might not this but be. “Albeit, for all that pride would prove, My heart be wrung to lose thy love, It yet repents me not hereof: So many an eagle and many a dove, So many a knight, so many a may, This water-snake of poisonous tongue To death by words and wiles hath stung, That her their slayer, from hell's lake sprung, I did not ill to slay.” “Yea,” said the king, “too high of heart To stand before a king thou art; Yet irks it me to bid thee part And take thy penance for thy part, That God may put upon thy pride.” Then Balen took the severed head And toward his hostry turned and sped As one that knew not quick from dead Nor good from evil tide. He bade his squire before him stand And take that sanguine spoil in hand And bear it far by shore and strand Till all in glad Northumberland That loved him, seeing it, all might know His deadliest foe was dead, and hear How free from prison as from fear He dwelt in trust of the answering year To bring him weal for woe. “And tell them, now I take my way To meet in battle, if I may, King Ryons of North Wales, and slay That king of kernes whose fiery sway Doth all the marches dire despite That serve King Arthur: so shall he Again be gracious lord to me, And I that leave thee meet with thee Once more in Arthur's sight.” So spake he ere they parted, nor Took shame or fear to counsellor, As one whom none laid ambush for; And wist not how Sir Launceor, The wild king's son of Ireland, hot And high in wrath to know that one Stood higher in fame before the sun, Even Balen, since the sword was won, Drew nigh from Camelot. For thence, in heat of hate and pride, As one that man might bid not bide, He craved the high king's grace to ride On quest of Balen far and wide And wreak the wrong his wrath had wrought. “Yea,” Arthur said, “for such despite Was done me never in my sight As this thine hand shall now requite If trust avail us aught.” But ere he passed, in eager mood To feed his hate with bitter food, Before the king's face Merlin stood And heard his tale of ill and good, Of Balen, and the sword achieved, And whence it smote as heaven's red ire That direful dame of doom as dire; And how the king's wrath turned to fire The grief wherewith he grieved. And darkening as he gave it ear, The still face of the sacred seer Waxed wan with wrath and not with fear, And ever changed its cloudier cheer Till all his face was very night. “This damosel that brought the sword,” He said, “before the king my lord, And all these knights about his board, Hath done them all despite. “The falsest damosel she is That works men ill on earth, I wis, And all her mind is toward but this, To kill as with a lying kiss Truth, and the life of noble trust. A brother hath she,—see but now The flame of shame that brands her brow!— A true man, pure as faith's own vow, Whose honour knows not rust. “This good knight found within her bower A felon and her paramour, And slew him in his shameful hour, As right gave might and righteous power To hands that wreaked so foul a wrong. Then, for the hate her heart put on, She sought by ways where death had gone The lady Lyle of Avalon, Whose crafts are strange and strong. “The sorceress, one with her in thought, Gave her that sword of magic, wrought By charms whereof sweet heaven sees nought, That hither girt on her she brought To be by doom her brother's bane. And grief it is to think how he That won it, being of heart so free And perfect found in chivalry, Shall by that sword lie slain. “Great pity it is and strange despite That one whose eyes are stars to light Honour, and shine as heaven's own height, Should perish, being the goodliest knight That even the all-glorious north has borne. Nor shall my lord the king behold A lordlier friend of mightier mould Than Balen, though his tale be told Ere noon fulfil his morn.” IV As morning hears before it run The music of the mounting sun, And laughs to watch his trophies won From darkness, and her hosts undone, And all the night become a breath, Nor dreams that fear should hear and flee The summer menace of the sea, So hears our hope what life may be, And knows it not for death. Each day that slays its hours and dies Weeps, laughs, and lightens on our eyes, And sees and hears not: smiles and sighs As flowers ephemeral fall and rise About its birth, about its way, And pass as love and sorrow pass, As shadows flashing down a glass, As dew-flowers blowing in flowerless grass, As hope from yesterday. The blossom of the sunny dew That now the stronger sun strikes through Fades off the blade whereon it blew No fleetlier than the flowers that grew On hope's green stem in life's fierce light. Nor might the glory soon to sit Awhile on Balen's crest alit Outshine the shadow of doom on it Or stay death's wings from flight. Dawn on a golden moorland side By holt and heath saw Balen ride And Launceor after, pricked with pride And stung with spurring envy: wide And far he had ridden athwart strange lands And sought amiss the man he found And cried on, till the stormy sound Rang as a rallying trumpet round That fires men's hearts and hands. Abide he bade him: nor was need To bid when Balen wheeled his steed Fiercely, less fain by word than deed To bid his envier evil speed, And cried, “What wilt thou with me?” Loud Rang Launceor's vehement answer: “Knight, To avenge on thee the dire despite Thou hast done us all in Arthur's sight I stand toward Arthur vowed.” “Ay?” Balen said: “albeit I see I needs must deal in strife with thee, Light is the wyte thou layest on me; For her I slew and sinned not, she Was dire in all men's eyes as death, Or none were lother found than I By me to bid a woman die: As lief were loyal men to lie, Or scorn what honour saith.” As the arched wave's weight against the reef Hurls, and is hurled back like a leaf Storm-shrivelled, and its rage of grief Speaks all the loud broad sea in brief, And quells the hearkening hearts of men, Or as the crash of overfalls Down under blue smooth water brawls Like jarring steel on ruining walls, So rang their meeting then. As wave on wave shocks, and confounds The bounding bulk whereon it bounds And breaks and shattering seaward sounds As crying of the old sea's wolves and hounds That moan and ravin and rage and wail, So steed on steed encountering sheer Shocked, and the strength of Launceor's spear Shivered on Balen's shield, and fear Bade hope within him quail. But Balen's spear through Launceor's shield Clove as a ploughshare cleaves the field And pierced the hauberk triple-steeled, That horse with horseman stricken reeled, And as a storm-breached rock falls, fell, And Balen turned his horse again And wist not yet his foe lay slain, And saw him dead that sought his bane And wrought and fared not well. Suddenly, while he gazed and stood, And mused in many-minded mood If life or death were evil or good, Forth of a covert of a wood That skirted half the moorland lea Fast rode a maiden flower-like white Full toward that fair wild place of fight, Anhungered of the woful sight God gave her there to see. And seeing the man there fallen and dead, She cried against the sun that shed Light on the living world, and said, “O Balen, slayer whose hand is red, Two bodies and one heart thou hast slain, Two hearts within one body: aye, Two souls thou hast lost; by thee they die, Cast out of sight of earth and sky And all that made them fain.” And from the dead his sword she caught, And fell in trance that wist of nought, Swooning: but softly Balen sought To win from her the sword she thought To die on, dying by Launceor's side. Again her wakening wail outbroke As wildly, sword in hand, she woke And struck one swift and bitter stroke That healed her, and she died. And sorrowing for their strange love's sake Rode Balen forth by lawn and lake, By moor and moss and briar and brake, And in his heart their sorrow spake Whose lips were dumb as death, and said Mute words of presage blind and vain As rain-stars blurred and marred by rain To wanderers on a moonless main Where night and day seem dead. Then toward a sunbright wildwood side He looked and saw beneath it ride A knight whose arms afar espied By note of name and proof of pride Bare witness of his brother born, His brother Balan, hard at hand, Twin flower of bright Northumberland, Twin sea-bird of their loud sea-strand, Twin song-bird of their morn. Ah then from Balen passed away All dread of night, all doubt of day, All care what life or death might say, All thought of all worse months than May: Only the might of joy in love Brake forth within him as a fire, And deep delight in deep desire Of far-flown days whose full-souled quire Rang round from the air above. From choral earth and quiring air Rang memories winged like songs that bear Sweet gifts for spirit and sense to share: For no man's life knows love more fair And fruitful of memorial things Than this the deep dear love that breaks With sense of life on life, and makes The sundawn sunnier as it wakes Where morning round it rings. “O brother, O my brother!” cried Each upon each, and cast aside Their helms unbraced that might not hide From sight of memory single-eyed The likeness graven of face and face, And kissed and wept upon each other For joy and pity of either brother, And love engraffed by sire and mother, God's natural gift of grace. And each with each took counsel meet For comfort, making sorrow sweet, And grief a goodly thing to greet: And word from word leapt light and fleet Till all the venturous tale was told, And how in Balen's hope it lay To meet the wild Welsh king and slay, And win from Arthur back for pay The grace he gave of old. “And thither wilt not thou with me And win as great a grace for thee?” “That will I well,” quoth Balan: “we Will cleave together, bound and free, As brethren should, being twain and one.” But ere they parted thence there came A creature withered as with flame, A dwarf mismade in nature's shame, Between them and the sun. And riding fleet as fire may glide He found the dead lie side by side, And wailed and rent his hair and cried, “Who hath done this deed?” And Balen eyed The strange thing loathfully, and said, “The knight I slew, who found him fain And keen to slay me: seeing him slain, The maid I sought to save in vain, Self-stricken, here lies dead. “Sore grief was mine to see her die, And for her true faith's sake shall I Love, and with love of heart more high, All women better till I die.” “Alas,” the dwarf said, “ill for thee In evil hour this deed was done: For now the quest shall be begun Against thee, from the dawning sun Even to the sunset sea. “From shore to mountain, dawn to night, The kinsfolk of this great dead knight Will chase thee to thy death.” A light Of swift blithe scorn flashed answer bright As fire from Balen's eye. “For that, Small fear shall fret my heart,” quoth he: “But that my lord the king should be For this dead man's sake wroth with me, Weep might it well thereat.” Then murmuring passed the dwarf away, And toward the knights in fair array Came riding eastward up the way From where the flower-soft lowlands lay A king whose name the sweet south-west Held high in honour, and the land That bowed beneath his gentle hand Wore on its wild bright northern strand Tintagel for a crest. And Balen hailed with homage due King Mark of Cornwall, when he knew The pennon that before him flew: And for those lovers dead and true The king made moan to hear their doom; And for their sorrow's sake he sware To seek in all the marches there The church that man might find most fair And build therein their tomb. V As thought from thought takes wing and flies, As month on month with sunlit eyes Tramples and triumphs in its rise, As wave smites wave to death and dies, So chance on hurtling chance like steel Strikes, flashes, and is quenched, ere fear Can whisper hope, or hope can hear, If sorrow or joy be far or near For time to hurt or heal. Swift as a shadow and strange as light That cleaves in twain the shadow of night Before the wide-winged word takes flight That thunder speaks to depth and height And quells the quiet hour with sound, There came before King Mark and stood Between the moorside and the wood The man whose word God's will made good, Nor guile was in it found. And Merlin said to Balen: “Lo, Thou hast wrought thyself a grievous woe To let this lady die, and know Thou mightst have stayed her deadly blow.” And Balen answered him and said, “Nay, by my truth to faith, not I, So fiercely fain she was to die; Ere well her sword had flashed on high, Self-slain she lay there dead.” Again and sadly Merlin spake: “My heart is wrung for this deed's sake, To know thee therefore doomed to take Upon thine hand a curse, and make Three kingdoms pine through twelve years' change, In want and woe: for thou shalt smite The man most noble and truest knight That looks upon the live world's light A dolorous stroke and strange. “And not till years shall round their goal May this man's wound thou hast given be whole.” And Balen, stricken through the soul By dark-winged words of doom and dole, Made answer: “If I wist it were No lie but sooth thou sayest of me, Then even to make a liar of thee Would I too slay myself, and see How death bids dead men fare.” And Merlin took his leave and passed And was not: and the shadow as fast Went with him that his word had cast, Too fleet for thought thereof to last: And there those brethren bade King Mark Farewell: but fain would Mark have known The strong knight's name who had overthrown The pride of Launceor, when it shone Bright as it now lay dark. And Balan for his brother spake, Saying: “Sir, albeit him list not break The seal of secret time, nor shake Night off him ere his morning wake, By these two swords he is girt withal May men that praise him, knights and lords, Call him the knight that bears two swords, And all the praise his fame accords Make answer when they call.” So parted they toward eventide; And tender twilight, heavy-eyed, Saw deep down glimmering woodlands ride Balen and Balan side by side, Till where the leaves grew dense and dim Again they spied from far draw near The presence of the sacred seer, But so disguised and strange of cheer That seeing they knew not him. “Now whither ride ye,” Merlin said, “Through shadows that the sun strikes red, Ere night be born or day be dead?” But they, for doubt half touched with dread, Would say not where their goal might lie. “And thou,” said Balen, “what art thou, To walk with shrouded eye and brow?” He said: “Me lists not show thee now By name what man am I.” “Ill seen is this of thee,” said they, “That thou art true in word and way Nor fain to fear the face of day, Who wilt not as a true man say The name it shames not him to bear.” He answered: “Be it or be it not so, Yet why ye ride this way I know, To meet King Ryons as a foe, And how your hope shall fare. “Well, if ye hearken toward my rede, Ill, if ye hear not, shall ye speed.” “Ah, now,” they cried, “thou art ours at need: What Merlin saith we are fain to heed.” “Great worship shall ye win,” said he, “And look that ye do knightly now, For great shall be your need, I trow.” And Balen smiled: “By knighthood's vow, The best we may will we.” Then Merlin bade them turn and take Rest, for their good steeds' weary sake, Between the highway and the brake, Till starry midnight bade them wake: Then “Rise,” he said, “the king is nigh, Who hath stolen from all his host away With threescore horse in armed array, The goodliest knights that bear his sway And hold his kingdom high. “And twenty ride of them before To bear his errand, ere the door Turn of the night, sealed fast no more, And sundawn bid the stars wax hoar; For by the starshine of to-night He seeks a leman where she waits His coming, dark and swift as fate's, And hearkens toward the unopening gates That yield not him to sight.” Then through the glimmering gloom around A shadowy sense of light and sound Made, ere the proof thereof were found, The brave blithe hearts within them bound, And “Where,” quoth Balen, “rides the king?” But softer spake the seer: “Abide, Till hither toward your spears he ride, Where all the narrowing woodland side Grows dense with boughs that cling.” There in that straitening way they met The wild Welsh host against them set, And smote their strong king down, ere yet His hurrying horde of spears might get Fierce vantage of them. Then the fight Grew great and joyous as it grew, For left and right those brethren slew, Till all the lawn waxed red with dew More deep than dews of night. And ere the full fierce tale was read Full forty lay before them dead, And fast the hurtling remnant fled And wist not whither fear had led: And toward the king they went again, And would have slain him: but he bowed Before them, crying in fear aloud For grace they gave him, seeing the proud Wild king brought lowest of men. And ere the wildwood leaves were stirred With song or wing of wakening bird, In Camelot was Merlin's word With joy in joyous wonder heard That told of Arthur's bitterest foe Diskingdomed and discomfited. “By whom?” the high king smiled and said. He answered: “Ere the dawn wax red, To-morrow bids you know. “Two knights whose heart and hope are one And fain to win your grace have done This work whereby if grace be won Their hearts shall hail the enkindling sun With joy more keen and deep than day.” And ere the sundawn drank the dew Those brethren with their prisoner drew To the outer guard they gave him to And passed again away. And Arthur came as toward his guest To greet his foe, and bade him rest As one returned from nobler quest And welcome from the stormbright west, But by what chance he fain would hear. “The chance was hard and strange, sir king,” Quoth Ryons, bowed in thanksgiving. “Who won you?” Arthur said: “the thing Is worth a warrior's ear.” The wild king flushed with pride and shame, Answering: “I know not either name Of those that there against us came And withered all our strength like flame: The knight that bears two swords is one, And one his brother: not on earth May men meet men of knightlier worth Nor mightier born of mortal birth That hail the sovereign sun.” And Arthur said: “I know them not; But much am I for this, God wot, Beholden to them: Launcelot Nor Tristram, when the war waxed hot Along the marches east and west, Wrought ever nobler work than this.” “Ah,” Merlin said, “sore pity it is And strange mischance of doom, I wis, That death should mar their quest. “Balen, the perfect knight that won The sword whose name is malison, And made his deed his doom, is one: Nor hath his brother Balan done Less royal service: not on earth Lives there a nobler knight, more strong Of soul to win men's praise in song, Albeit the light abide not long That lightened round his birth. “Yea, and of all sad things I know The heaviest and the highest in woe Is this, the doom whose date brings low Too soon in timeless overthrow A head so high, a hope so sure. The greatest moan for any knight That ever won fair fame in fight Shall be for Balen, seeing his might Must now not long endure.” “Alas,” King Arthur said, “he hath shown Such love to me-ward that the moan Made of him should be mine alone Above all other, knowing it known I have ill deserved it of him.” “Nay,” Said Merlin, “he shall do for you Much more, when time shall be anew, Than time hath given him chance to do Or hope may think to say. “But now must be your powers purveyed To meet, ere noon of morn be made To-morrow, all the host arrayed Of this wild foe's wild brother, laid Around against you: see to it well, For now I part from you.” And soon, When sundawn slew the withering moon, Two hosts were met to win the boon Whose tale is death's to tell. A lordly tale of knights and lords For death to tell by count of swords When war's wild harp in all its chords Rang royal triumph, and the hordes Of hurtling foemen rocked and reeled As waves wind-thwarted on the sea, Was told of all that there might be, Till scarce might battle hear or see The fortune of the field. And many a knight won fame that day When even the serpent soul of Kay Was kindled toward the fiery play As might a lion's be for prey, And won him fame that might not die With passing of his rancorous breath But clung about his life and death As fire that speaks in cloud, and saith What strong men hear and fly. And glorious works were Arthur's there, That lit the battle-darkened air: But when they saw before them fare Like stars of storm the knight that bare Two swords about him girt for fray, Balen, and Balan with him, then Strong wonder smote the souls of men If heaven's own host or hell's deep den Had sent them forth to slay. So keen they rode across the fight, So sharp they smote to left and right, And made of hurtling darkness light With lightning of their swords, till flight And fear before them flew like flame, That Arthur's self had never known, He said, since first his blast was blown, Such lords of war as these alone That whence he knew not came. But while the fire of war waxed hot The wild king hearkened, hearing not, Through storm of spears and arrow-shot, For succour toward him from King Lot And all his host of sea-born men, Strong as the strong storm-baffling bird Whose cry round Orkney's headlands heard Is as the sea's own sovereign word That mocks our mortal ken. For Merlin's craft of prophecy, Who wist that one of twain must die, Put might in him to say thereby Which head should lose its crown, and lie Stricken, though loth he were to know That either life should wane and fail; Yet most might Arthur's love avail, And still with subtly tempered tale His wile held fast the foe. With woven words of magic might Wherein the subtle shadow and light Changed hope and fear till fear took flight, He stayed King Lot's fierce lust of fight Till all the wild Welsh war was driven As foam before the wind that wakes With the all-awakening sun, and breaks Strong ships that rue the mirth it makes When grace to slay is given. And ever hotter lit and higher, As fire that meets encountering fire, Waxed in King Lot his keen desire To bid revenge within him tire On Arthur's ravaged fame and life: Across the waves of war between Floated and flashed, unseen and seen, The lustrous likeness of the queen Whom shame had sealed his wife. But when the woful word was brought That while he tarried, doubting nought, The hope was lost whose goal he sought And all the fight he yearned for fought, His heart was rent for grief and shame, And half his hope was set on flight Till word was given him of a knight Who said: “They are weary and worn with fight, And we more fresh than flame.” And bright and dark as night and day Ere either find the unopening way Clear, and forego the unaltering sway, The sad king's face shone, frowning: “Yea, I would that every knight of mine Would do his part as I shall do,” He said, “till death or life anew Shall judge between us as is due With wiser doom than thine.” Then thundered all the awakening field With crash of hosts that clashed and reeled, Banner to banner, shield to shield, And spear to splintering spear-shaft, steeled As heart against high heart of man, As hope against high hope of knight To pluck the crest and crown of fight From war's clenched hand by storm's wild light, For blessing given or ban. All hearts of hearkening men that heard The ban twin-born with blessing, stirred Like springtide waters, knew the word Whereby the steeds of storm are spurred With ravenous rapture to destroy, And laughed for love of battle, pierced With passion of tempestuous thirst And hungering hope to assuage it first With draughts of stormy joy. But sheer ahead of the iron tide That rocked and roared from side to side Rode as the lightning's lord might ride King Lot, whose heart was set to abide All peril of the raging hour, And all his host of warriors born Where lands by warring seas are worn Was only by his hands upborne Who gave them pride and power. But as the sea's hand smites the shore And shatters all the strengths that bore The ravage earth may bear no more, So smote the hand of Pellinore Charging, a knight of Arthur's chief, And clove his strong steed's neck in twain, And smote him sheer through brow and brain, Falling: and there King Lot lay slain, And knew not wrath or grief. And all the host of Orkney fled, And many a mother's son lay dead: But when they raised the stricken head Whence pride and power and shame were fled And rage and anguish now cast out, And bore it toward a kingly tomb, The wife whose love had wrought his doom Came thither, fair as morning's bloom And dark as twilight's doubt. And there her four strong sons and his, Gawain and Gareth, Gaherys And Agravain, whose sword's sharp kiss With sound of hell's own serpent's hiss Should one day turn her life to death, Stood mourning with her: but by these Seeing Mordred as a seer that sees, Anguish of terror bent her knees And caught her shuddering breath. The splendour of her sovereign eyes Flashed darkness deeper than the skies Feel or fear when the sunset dies On his that felt as midnight rise Their doom upon them, there undone By faith in fear ere thought could yield A shadowy sense of days revealed, The ravin of the final field, The terror of their son. For Arthur's, as they caught the light That sought and durst not seek his sight, Darkened, and all his spirit's might Withered within him even as night Withers when sunrise thrills the sea. But Mordred's lightened as with fire That smote his mother and his sire With darkling doom and deep desire That bade its darkness be. And heavier on their hearts the weight Sank of the fear that brings forth fate, The bitter doubt whose womb is great With all the grief and love and hate That turn to fire men's days on earth. And glorious was the funeral made, And dark the deepening dread that swayed Their darkening souls whose light grew shade With sense of death in birth. VI In autumn, when the wind and sea Rejoice to live and laugh to be, And scarce the blast that curbs the tree And bids before it quail and flee The fiery foliage, where its brand Is radiant as the seal of spring, Sounds less delight, and waves a wing Less lustrous, life's loud thanksgiving Puts life in sea and land. High hope in Balen's heart alight Laughed, as from all that clamorous fight He passed and sought not Arthur's sight, Who fain had found his kingliest knight And made amend for Balen's wrong. But Merlin gave his soul to see Fate, rising as a shoreward sea, And all the sorrow that should be Ere hope or fear thought long. “O where are they whose hands upbore My battle,” Arthur said, “before The wild Welsh host's wide rage and roar? Balen and Balan, Pellinore, Where are they?” Merlin answered him: “Balen shall be not long away From sight of you, but night nor day Shall bring his brother back to say If life burn bright or dim.” “Now, by my faith,” said Arthur then, “Two marvellous knights are they, whose ken Toward battle makes the twain as ten, And Balen most of all born men Passeth of prowess all I know Or ever found or sought to see: Would God he would abide with me To face the times foretold of thee And all the latter woe.” For there had Merlin shown the king The doom that songs unborn should sing, The gifts that time should rise and bring Of blithe and bitter days to spring As weeds and flowers against the sun. And on the king for fear's sake fell Sickness, and sorrow deep as hell, Nor even might sleep bid fear farewell If grace to sleep were won. Down in a meadow green and still He bade the folk that wrought his will Pitch his pavilion, where the chill Soft night would let not rest fulfil His heart wherein dark fears lay deep. And sharp against his hearing cast Came a sound as of horsehoofs fast Passing, that ere their sound were past Aroused him as from sleep. And forth he looked along the grass And saw before his portal pass A knight that wailed aloud, “Alas That life should find this dolorous pass And find no shield from doom and dole!” And hearing all his moan, “Abide, Fair sir,” the king arose and cried, “And say what sorrow bids you ride So sorrowful of soul.” “My hurt may no man heal, God wot, And help of man may speed me not,” The sad knight said, “nor change my lot.” And toward the castle of Melyot Whose towers arose a league away He passed forth sorrowing: and anon, Ere well the woful sight were gone, Came Balen down the meads that shone, Strong, bright, and brave as day. And seeing the king there stand, the knight Drew rein before his face to alight In reverence made for love's sake bright With joy that set his face alight As theirs who see, alive, above, The sovereign of their souls, whose name To them is even as love's own flame To enkindle hope that heeds not fame And knows no lord but love. And Arthur smiled on him, and said, “Right welcome be thou: by my head, I would not wish me better sped. For even but now there came and fled Before me like a cloud that flies A knight that made most heavy cheer, I know not wherefore; nor may fear Or pity give my heart to hear Or lighten on mine eyes. “But even for fear's and pity's sake Fain were I thou shouldst overtake And fetch again this knight that spake No word of answering grace to make Reply to mine that hailed him: thou, By force or by goodwill, shalt bring His face before me.” “Yea, my king,” Quoth Balen, “and a greater thing Were less than is my vow. “I would the task required and heard Were heavier than your sovereign word Hath laid on me:” and thence he spurred Elate at heart as youth, and stirred With hope as blithe as fires a boy: And many a mile he rode, and found Far in a forest's glimmering bound The man he sought afar around And seeing took fire for joy. And with him went a maiden, fair As flowers aflush with April air. And Balen bade him turn him there To tell the king what woes they were That bowed him down so sore: and he Made woful answer: “This should do Great scathe to me, with nought for you Of help that hope might hearken to For boot that may not be.” And Balen answered: “I were loth To fight as one perforce made wroth With one that owes by knighthood's oath One love, one service, and one troth With me to him whose gracious hand Holds fast the helm of knighthood here Whereby man's hope and heart may steer: I pray you let not sorrow or fear Against his bidding stand.” The strange knight gazed on him, and spake: “Will you, for Arthur's royal sake, Be warrant for me that I take No scathe from strife that man may make? Then will I go with you.” And he Made joyous answer: “Yea, for I Will be your warrant or will die.” And thence they rode with hearts as high As men's that search the sea. And as by noon's large light the twain Before the tented hall drew rein, Suddenly fell the strange knight, slain By one that came and went again And none might see him; but his spear Clove through the body, swift as fire, The man whose doom, forefelt as dire, Had darkened all his life's desire, As one that death held dear. And dying he turned his face and said, “Lo now thy warrant that my head Should fall not, following forth where led A knight whose pledge hath left me dead. This darkling manslayer hath to name Garlon: take thou my goodlier steed, Seeing thine is less of strength and speed, And ride, if thou be knight indeed, Even thither whence we came. “And as the maiden's fair behest Shall bid you follow on my quest, Follow: and when God's will sees best, Revenge my death, and let me rest As one that lived and died a knight, Unstained of shame alive or dead.” And Balen, wrung with sorrow, said, “That shall I do: my hand and head I pledge to do you right.” And thence with sorrowing heart and cheer He rode, in grief that cast out fear Lest death in darkness yet were near, And bore the truncheon of the spear Wherewith the woful knight lay slain To her with whom he rode, and she Still bare it with her, fain to see What righteous doom of God's might be The darkling manslayer's bane. And down a dim deep woodland way They rode between the boughs asway With flickering winds whose flash and play Made sunlight sunnier where the day Laughed, leapt, and fluttered like a bird Caught in a light loose leafy net That earth for amorous heaven had set To hold and see the sundawn yet And hear what morning heard. There in the sweet soft shifting light Across their passage rode a knight Flushed hot from hunting as from fight, And seeing the sorrow-stricken sight Made question of them why they rode As mourners sick at heart and sad, When all alive about them bade Sweet earth for heaven's sweet sake be glad As heaven for earth's love glowed. “Me lists not tell you,” Balen said. The strange knight's face grew keen and red; “Now, might my hand but keep my head, Even here should one of twain lie dead Were he no better armed than I.” And Balen spake with smiling speed, Where scorn and courtesy kept heed Of either: “That should little need: Not here shall either die.” And all the cause he told him through As one that feared not though he knew All: and the strange knight spake anew, Saying: “I will part no more from you While life shall last me.” So they went Where he might arm himself to ride, And rode across wild ways and wide To where against a churchyard side A hermit's harbour leant. And there against them riding came Fleet as the lightning's laugh and flame The invisible evil, even the same They sought and might not curse by name As hell's foul child on earth set free, And smote the strange knight through, and fled, And left the mourners by the dead. “Alas, again,” Sir Balen said, “This wrong he hath done to me.” And there they laid their dead to sleep Royally, lying where wild winds keep Keen watch and wail more soft and deep Than where men's choirs bid music weep And song like incense heave and swell. And forth again they rode, and found Before them, dire in sight and sound, A castle girt about and bound With sorrow like a spell. Above it seemed the sun at noon Sad as a wintry withering moon That shudders while the waste wind's tune Craves ever none may guess what boon, But all may know the boon for dire. And evening on its darkness fell More dark than very death's farewell, And night about it hung like hell, Whose fume the dawn made fire. And Balen lighted down and passed Within the gateway, whence no blast Rang as the sheer portcullis, cast Suddenly down, fell, and made fast The gate behind him, whence he spied A sudden rage of men without And ravin of a murderous rout That girt the maiden hard about With death on either side. And seeing that shame and peril, fear Bade wrath and grief awake and hear What shame should say in fame's wide ear If she, by sorrow sealed more dear Than joy might make her, so should die: And up the tower's curled stair he sprang As one that flies death's deadliest fang, And leapt right out amid their gang As fire from heaven on high. And they thereunder seeing the knight Unhurt among their press alight And bare his sword for chance of fight Stood from him, loth to strive or smite, And bade him hear their woful word, That not the maiden's death they sought; But there through years too dire for thought Had lain their lady stricken, and nought Might heal her: and he heard. For there a maiden clean and whole In virgin body and virgin soul, Whose name was writ on royal roll, That would but stain a silver bowl With offering of her stainless blood, Therewith might heal her: so they stayed For hope's sad sake each blameless maid There journeying in that dolorous shade Whose bloom was bright in bud. No hurt nor harm to her it were If she should yield a sister there Some tribute of her blood, and fare Forth with this joy at heart to bear, That all unhurt and unafraid This grace she had here by God's grace wrought. And kindling all with kindly thought And love that saw save love's self nought, Shone, smiled, and spake the maid. “Good knight of mine, good will have I To help this healing though I die.” “Nay,” Balen said, “but love may try What help in living love may lie. —I will not lose the life of her While my life lasteth.” So she gave The tribute love was fain to crave, But might not heal though fain to save, Were God's grace helpfuller. Another maid in later Mays Won with her life that woful praise, And died. But they, when surging day's Deep tide fulfilled the dawn's wide ways, Rode forth, and found by day or night No chance to cross their wayfaring Till when they saw the fourth day spring A knight's hall gave them harbouring Rich as a king's house might. And while they sat at meat and spake Words bright and kind as grace might make Sweet for true knighthood's kindly sake, They heard a cry beside them break The still-souled joy of blameless rest. “What noise is this?” quoth Balen. “Nay,” His knightly host made answer, “may Our grief not grieve you though I say How here I dwell unblest. “Not many a day has lived and died Since at a tournay late I tried My strength to smite and turn and ride Against a knight of kinglike pride, King Pellam's brother: twice I smote The splendour of his strength to dust: And he, fulfilled of hate's fierce lust, Swore vengeance, pledged for hell to trust, And keen as hell's wide throat. “Invisible as the spirit of night That heaven and earth in depth and height May see not by the mild moon's light Nor even when stars would grant them sight, He walks and slays as plague's blind breath Slays: and my son, whose anguish here Makes moan perforce that mars our cheer, He wounded, even ere love might fear That hate were strong as death. “Nor may my son be whole till he Whose stroke through him hath stricken me Shall give again his blood to be Our healing: yet may no man see This felon, clothed with darkness round And keen as lightning's life.” Thereon Spake Balen, and his presence shone Even as the sun's when stars are gone That hear dawn's trumpet sound. “That knight I know: two knights of mine, Two comrades, sealed by faith's bright sign, Whose eyes as ours that live should shine, And drink the golden sunlight's wine With joy's thanksgiving that they live, He hath slain in even the same blind wise: Were all wide wealth beneath the skies Mine, might I meet him, eyes on eyes, All would I laugh to give.” His host made answer, and his gaze Grew bright with trust as dawn's moist maze With fire: “Within these twenty days, King Pellam, lord of Lystenayse, Holds feast through all this country cried, And there before the knightly king May no knight come except he bring For witness of his wayfaring His paramour or bride. “And there that day, so soon to shine, This knight, your felon foe and mine, Shall show, full-flushed with bloodred wine, The fierce false face whereon we pine To wreak the wrong he hath wrought us, bare As shame should see and brand it.” “Then,” Said Balen, “shall he give again His blood to heal your son, and men Shall see death blind him there.” “Forth will we fare to-morrow,” said His host: and forth, as sunrise led, They rode; and fifteen days were fled Ere toward their goal their steeds had sped. And there alighting might they find For Balen's host no place to rest, Who came without a gentler guest Beside him: and that household's hest Bade leave his sword behind. “Nay,” Balen said, “that do I not: My country's custom stands, God wot, That none whose lot is knighthood's lot, To ride where chance as fire is hot With hope or promise given of fight, Shall fail to keep, for knighthood's part, His weapon with him as his heart; And as I came will I depart, Or hold herein my right.” Then gat he leave to wear his sword Beside the strange king's festal board Where feasted many a knight and lord In seemliness of fair accord: And Balen asked of one beside, “Is there not in this court, if fame Keep faith, a knight that hath to name Garlon?” and saying that word of shame, He scanned that place of pride. “Yonder he goeth against the light, He with the face as swart as night,” Quoth the other: “but he rides to fight Hid round by charms from all men's sight, And many a noble knight he hath slain, Being wrapt in darkness deep as hell And silence dark as shame.” “Ah, well,” Said Balen, “is that he? the spell May be the sorcerer's bane.” Then Balen gazed upon him long, And thought, “If here I wreak my wrong, Alive I may not scape, so strong The felon's friends about him throng; And if I leave him here alive, This chance perchance may life not give Again: much evil, if he live, He needs must do, should fear forgive When wrongs bid strike and strive.” And Garlon, seeing how Balen's eye Dwelt on him as his heart waxed high With joy in wrath to see him nigh, Rose wolf-like with a wolfish cry And crossed and smote him on the face, Saying, “Knight, what wouldst thou with me? Eat, For shame, and gaze not: eat thy meat: Do that thou art come for: stands thy seat Next ours of royal race?” “Well hast thou said: thy rede rings true; That which I came for will I do,” Quoth Balen: forth his fleet sword flew, And clove the head of Garlon through Clean to the shoulders. Then he cried Loud to his lady, “Give me here The truncheon of the shameful spear Wherewith he slew your knight, when fear Bade hate in darkness ride.” And gladly, bright with grief made glad, She gave the truncheon as he bade, For still she bare it with her, sad And strong in hopeless hope she had, Through all dark days of thwarting fear, To see if doom should fall aright And as God's fire-fraught thunder smite That head, clothed round with hell-faced night, Bare now before her here. And Balen smote therewith the dead Dark felon's body through, and said Aloud, “With even this truncheon, red With baser blood than brave men bled Whom in thy shameful hand it slew, Thou hast slain a nobler knight, and now It clings and cleaves thy body: thou Shalt cleave again no brave man's brow, Though hell would aid anew.” And toward his host he turned and spake; “Now for your son's long-suffering sake Blood ye may fetch enough, and take Wherewith to heal his hurt, and make Death warm as life.” Then rose a cry Loud as the wind's when stormy spring Makes all the woodland rage and ring: “Thou hast slain my brother,” said the king, “And here with him shalt die.” “Ay?” Balen laughed him answer. “Well, Do it then thyself.” And the answer fell Fierce as a blast of hate from hell, “No man of mine that with me dwell Shall strike at thee but I their lord For love of this my brother slain.” And Pellam caught and grasped amain A grim great weapon, fierce and fain To feed his hungering sword. And eagerly he smote, and sped Not well: for Balen's blade, yet red With lifeblood of the murderous dead, Between the swordstroke and his head Shone, and the strength of the eager stroke Shore it in sunder: then the knight, Naked and weaponless for fight, Ran seeking him a sword to smite As hope within him woke. And so their flight for deathward fast From chamber forth to chamber passed Where lay no weapon, till the last Whose doors made way for Balen cast Upon him as a sudden spell Wonder that even as lightning leapt Across his heart and eyes, and swept As storm across his soul that kept Wild watch, and watched not well. For there the deed he did, being near Death's danger, breathless as the deer Driven hard to bay, but void of fear, Brought sorrow down for many a year On many a man in many a land. All glorious shone that chamber, bright As burns at sunrise heaven's own height: With cloth of gold the bed was dight, That flamed on either hand. And one he saw within it lie: A table of all clear gold thereby Stood stately, fair as morning's eye, With four strong silver pillars, high And firm as faith and hope may be: And on it shone the gift he sought, A spear most marvellously wrought, That when his eye and handgrip caught Small fear at heart had he. Right on King Pellam then, as fire Turns when the thwarting winds wax higher, He turned, and smote him down. So dire The stroke was, when his heart's desire Struck, and had all its fill of hate, That as the king fell swooning down Fell the walls, rent from base to crown, Prone as prone seas that break and drown Ships fraught with doom for freight. And there for three days' silent space Balen and Pellam face to face Lay dead or deathlike, and the place Was death's blind kingdom, till the grace That God had given the sacred seer For counsel or for comfort led His Merlin thither, and he said, Standing between the quick and dead, “Rise up, and rest not here.” And Balen rose and set his eyes Against the seer's as one that tries His heart against the sea's and sky's And fears not if he lives or dies, Saying, “I would have my damosel, Ere I fare forth, to fare with me.” And sadly Merlin answered, “See Where now she lies; death knows if she Shall now fare ill or well. “And in this world we meet no more, Balen.” And Balen, sorrowing sore, Though fearless yet the heart he bore Beat toward the life that lay before, Rode forth through many a wild waste land Where men cried out against him, mad With grievous faith in fear that bade Their wrath make moan for doubt they had Lest hell had armed his hand. For in that chamber's wondrous shrine Was part of Christ's own blood, the wine Shed of the true triumphal vine Whose growth bids earth's deep darkness shine As heaven's deep light through the air and sea; That mystery toward our northern shore Arimathean Joseph bore For healing of our sins of yore, That grace even there might be. And with that spear there shrined apart Was Christ's side smitten to the heart. And fiercer than the lightning's dart The stroke was, and the deathlike smart Wherewith, night drained of blood and breath, The king lay stricken as one long dead: And Joseph's was the blood there shed, For near akin was he that bled, Near even as life to death. And therefore fell on all that land Sorrow: for still on either hand, As Balen rode alone and scanned Bright fields and cities built to stand Till time should break them, dead men lay; And loud and long from all their folk Living, one cry that cursed him broke; Three countries had his dolorous stroke Slain, or should surely slay. VII In winter, when the year burns low As fire wherein no firebrands glow, And winds dishevel as they blow The lovely stormy wings of snow, The hearts of northern men burn bright With joy that mocks the joy of spring To hear all heaven's keen clarions ring Music that bids the spirit sing And day give thanks for night. Aloud and dark as hell or hate Round Balen's head the wind of fate Blew storm and cloud from death's wide gate: But joy as grief in him was great To face God's doom and live or die, Sorrowing for ill wrought unaware, Rejoicing in desire to dare All ill that innocence might bear With changeless heart and eye. Yet passing fain he was when past Those lands and woes at length and last. Eight times, as thence he fared forth fast, Dawn rose and even was overcast With starry darkness dear as day, Before his venturous quest might meet Adventure, seeing within a sweet Green low-lying forest, hushed in heat, A tower that barred his way. Strong summer, dumb with rapture, bound With golden calm the woodlands round Wherethrough the knight forth faring found A knight that on the greenwood ground Sat mourning: fair he was to see, And moulded as for love or fight A maiden's dreams might frame her knight; But sad in joy's far-flowering sight As grief's blind thrall might be. “God save you,” Balen softly said, “What grief bows down your heart and head Thus, as one sorrowing for his dead? Tell me, if haply I may stead In aught your sorrow, that I may.” “Sir knight,” that other said, “thy word Makes my grief heavier that I heard.” And pity and wonder inly stirred Drew Balen thence away. And so withdrawn with silent speed He saw the sad knight's stately steed, A war-horse meet for warrior's need, That none who passed might choose but heed, So strong he stood, so great, so fair, With eyes afire for flight or fight, A joy to look on, mild in might, And swift and keen and kind as light, And all as clear of care. And Balen, gazing on him, heard Again his master's woful word Sound sorrow through the calm unstirred By fluttering wind or flickering bird, Thus: “Ah, fair lady and faithless, why Break thy pledged faith to meet me? soon An hour beyond thy trothplight noon Shall strike my death-bell, and thy boon Is this, that here I die. “My curse for all thy gifts may be Heavier than death or night on thee; For now this sword thou gavest me Shall set me from thy bondage free.” And there the man had died self-slain, But Balen leapt on him and caught The blind fierce hand that fain had wrought Self-murder, stung with fire of thought, As rage makes anguish fain. Then, mad for thwarted grief, “Let go My hand,” the fool of wrath and woe Cried, “or I slay thee.” Scarce the glow In Balen's cheek and eye might show, As dawn shows day while seas lie chill, He heard, though pity took not heed, But smiled and spake, “That shall not need: What man may do to bid you speed I, so God speed me, will.” And the other craved his name, beguiled By hope that made his madness mild. Again Sir Balen spake and smiled: “My name is Balen, called the Wild By knights whom kings and courts make tame, Because I ride alone afar And follow but my soul for star.” “Ah, sir, I know the knight you are And all your fiery fame. “The knight that bears two swords I know, Most praised of all men, friend and foe, For prowess of your hands, that show Dark war the way where balefires glow And kindle glory like the dawn's.” So spake the sorrowing knight, and stood As one whose heart fresh hope made good: And forth they rode by wold and wood And down the glimmering lawns. And Balen craved his name who rode Beside him, where the wild wood glowed With joy to feel how noontide flowed Through glade and glen and rough green road Till earth grew joyful as the sea. “My name is Garnysshe of the Mount, A poor man's son of none account,” He said, “where springs of loftier fount Laugh loud with pride to be. “But strength in weakness lives and stands As rocks that rise through shifting sands; And for the prowess of my hands One made me knight and gave me lands, Duke Hermel, lord from far to near, Our prince; and she that loved me—she I love, and deemed she loved but me, His daughter, pledged her faith to be Ere now beside me here.” And Balen, brief of speech as light Whose word, beheld of depth and height, Strikes silence through the stars of night, Spake, and his face as dawn's grew bright, For hope to help a happier man, “How far then lies she hence?” “By this,” Her lover sighed and said, “I wis, Not six fleet miles the passage is, And straight as thought could span.” So rode they swift and sure, and found A castle walled and dyked around: And Balen, as a warrior bound On search where hope might fear to sound The darkness of the deeps of doubt, Made entrance through the guardless gate As life, while hope in life grows great, Makes way between the doors of fate That death may pass thereout. Through many a glorious chamber, wrought For all delight that love's own thought Might dream or dwell in, Balen sought And found of all he looked for nought, For like a shining shell her bed Shone void and vacant of her: thence Through devious wonders bright and dense He passed and saw with shame-struck sense Where shame and faith lay dead. Down in a sweet small garden, fair With flowerful joy in the ardent air, He saw, and raged with loathing, where She lay with love-dishevelled hair Beneath a broad bright laurel tree And clasped in amorous arms a knight, The unloveliest that his scornful sight Had dwelt on yet; a shame the bright Broad noon might shrink to see. And thence in wrathful hope he turned, Hot as the heart within him burned, To meet the knight whose love, so spurned And spat on and made nought of, yearned And dreamed and hoped and lived in vain, And said, “I have found her sleeping fast,” And led him where the shadows cast From leaves wherethrough light winds ran past Screened her from sun and rain. But Garnysshe, seeing, reeled as he stood Like a tree, kingliest of the wood, Half hewn through: and the burning blood Through lips and nostrils burst aflood: And gathering back his rage and might As broken breakers rally and roar The loud wind down that drives off shore, He smote their heads off: there no more Their life might shame the light. Then turned he back toward Balen, mad With grief, and said, “The grief I had Was nought: ere this my life was glad: Thou hast done this deed: I was but sad And fearful how my hope might fare: I had lived my sorrow down, hadst thou Not shown me what I saw but now.” The sorrow and scorn on Balen's brow Bade silence curb him there. And Balen answered: “What I did I did to hearten thee and bid Thy courage know that shame should rid A man's high heart of love that hid Blind shame within its core: God knows, I did, to set a bondman free, But as I would thou hadst done by me, That seeing what love must die to see Love's end might well be woe's.” “Alas,” the woful weakling said, “I have slain what most I loved: I have shed The blood most near my heart: the head Lies cold as earth, defiled and dead, That all my life was lighted by, That all my soul bowed down before, And now may bear with life no more: For now my sorrow that I bore Is twofold, and I die.” Then with his red wet sword he rove His breast in sunder, where it clove Life, and no pulse against it strove, So sure and strong the deep stroke drove Deathward: and Balen, seeing him dead, Rode thence, lest folk would say he had slain Those three: and ere three days again Had seen the sun's might wax and wane, Far forth he had spurred and sped. And riding past a cross whereon Broad golden letters written shone, Saying, “No knight born may ride alone Forth toward this castle,” and all the stone Glowed in the sun's glare even as though Blood stained it from the crucified Dead burden of one that there had died, An old hoar man he saw beside Whose face was wan as woe. “Balen the Wild,” he said, “this way Thy way lies not: thou hast passed to-day Thy bands: but turn again, and stay Thy passage, while thy soul hath sway Within thee, and through God's good power It will avail thee:” and anon His likeness as a cloud was gone, And Balen's heart within him shone Clear as the cloudless hour. Nor fate nor fear might overcast The soul now near its peace at last. Suddenly, thence as forth he past, A mighty and a deadly blast Blown of a hunting-horn he heard, As when the chase hath nobly sped. “That blast is blown for me,” he said, “The prize am I who am yet not dead,” And smiled upon the word. As toward a royal hart's death rang That note, whence all the loud wood sang With winged and living sound that sprang Like fire, and keen as fire's own fang Pierced the sweet silence that it slew. But nought like death or strife was here: Fair semblance and most goodly cheer They made him, they whose troop drew near As death among them drew. A hundred ladies well arrayed And many a knight well weaponed made That kindly show of cheer: the glade Shone round them till its very shade Lightened and laughed from grove to lawn To hear and see them: so they brought Within a castle fair as thought Could dream that wizard hands had wrought The guest among them drawn. All manner of glorious joy was there: Harping and dancing, loud and fair, And minstrelsy that made of air Fire, so like fire its raptures were. Then the chief lady spake on high: “Knight with the two swords, one of two Must help you here or fall from you: For needs you now must have ado And joust with one hereby. “A good knight guards an island here Against all swords that chance brings near, And there with stroke of sword and spear Must all for whom these halls make cheer Fight, and redeem or yield up life.” “An evil custom,” Balen said, “Is this, that none whom chance hath led Hither, if knighthood crown his head, May pass unstirred to strife.” “You shall not have ado to fight Here save against one only knight,” She said, and all her face grew bright As hell-fire, lit with hungry light That wicked laughter touched with flame. “Well, since I shall thereto,” said he, “I am ready at heart as death for me: Fain would I be where death should be And life should lose its name. “But travelling men whose goal afar Shines as a cloud-constraining star Are often weary, and wearier are Their steeds that feel each fret and jar Wherewith the wild ways wound them: yet, Albeit my horse be weary, still My heart is nowise weary; will Sustains it even till death fulfil My trust upon him set.” “Sir,” said a knight thereby that stood, “Meseems your shield is now not good But worn with warrior work, nor could Sustain in strife the strokes it would: A larger will I lend you.” “Ay, Thereof I thank you,” Balen said, Being single of heart as one that read No face aright whence faith had fled, Nor dreamed that faith could fly. And so he took that shield unknown And left for treason's touch his own, And toward that island rode alone, Nor heard the blast against him blown Sound in the wind's and water's sound, But hearkening toward the stream's edge heard Nought save the soft stream's rippling word, Glad with the gladness of a bird, That sang to the air around. And there against the water-side He saw, fast moored to rock and ride, A fair great boat anear abide Like one that waits the turning tide, Wherein embarked his horse and he Passed over toward no kindly strand: And where they stood again on land There stood a maiden hard at hand Who seeing them wept to see. And “O knight Balen,” was her cry, “Why have ye left your own shield? why Come hither out of time to die? For had ye kept your shield, thereby Ye had yet been known, and died not here. Great pity it is of you this day As ever was of knight, or may Be ever, seeing in war's bright way Praise knows not Balen's peer.” And Balen said, “Thou hast heard my name Right: it repenteth me, though shame May tax me not with base men's blame, That ever, hap what will, I came Within this country; yet, being come, For shame I may not turn again Now, that myself and nobler men May scorn me: now is more than then, And faith bids fear be dumb. “Be it life or death, my chance I take, Be it life's to build or death's to break: And fall what may, me lists not make Moan for sad life's or death's sad sake.” Then looked he on his armour, glad And high of heart, and found it strong: And all his soul became a song And soared in prayer that soared not long, For all the hope it had. Then saw he whence against him came A steed whose trappings shone like flame, And he that rode him showed the same Fierce colour, bright as fire or fame, But dark the visors were as night That hid from Balen Balan's face, And his from Balan: God's own grace Forsook them for a shadowy space Where darkness cast out light. The two swords girt that Balen bare Gave Balan for a breath's while there Pause, wondering if indeed it were Balen his brother, bound to dare The chance of that unhappy quest: But seeing not as he thought to see His shield, he deemed it was not he, And so, as fate bade sorrow be, They laid their spears in rest. So mighty was the course they ran With spear to spear so great of span, Each fell back stricken, man by man, Horse by horse, borne down: so the ban That wrought by doom against them wrought: But Balen by his falling steed Was bruised the sorer, being indeed Way-weary, like a rain-bruised reed, With travel ere he fought. And Balen rose again from swoon First, and went toward him: all too soon He too then rose, and the evil boon Of strength came back, and the evil tune Of battle unnatural made again Mad music as for death's wide ear Listening and hungering toward the near Last sigh that life or death might hear At last from dying men. Balan smote Balen first, and clove His lifted shield that rose and strove In vain against the stroke that drove Down: as the web that morning wove Of glimmering pearl from spray to spray Dies when the strong sun strikes it, so Shrank the steel, tempered thrice to show Strength, as the mad might of the blow Shore Balen's helm away. Then turning as a turning wave Against the land-wind, blind and brave In hope that dreams despair may save, With even the unhappy sword that gave The gifts of fame and fate in one He smote his brother, and there had nigh Felled him: and while they breathed, his eye Glanced up, and saw beneath the sky Sights fairer than the sun. The towers of all the castle there Stood full of ladies, blithe and fair As the earth beneath and the amorous air About them and above them were: So toward the blind and fateful fight Again those brethren went, and sore Were all the strokes they smote and bore, And breathed again, and fell once more To battle in their sight. With blood that either spilt and bled Was all the ground they fought on red, And each knight's hauberk hewn and shred Left each unmailed and naked, shed From off them even as mantles cast: And oft they breathed, and drew but breath Brief as the word strong sorrow saith, And poured and drank the draught of death, Till fate was full at last. And Balan, younger born than he Whom darkness bade him slay, and be Slain, as in mist where none may see If aught abide or fall or flee, Drew back a little and laid him down, Dying: but Balen stood, and said, As one between the quick and dead Might stand and speak, “What good knight's head Hath won this mortal crown? “What knight art thou? for never I Who now beside thee dead shall die Found yet the knight afar or nigh That matched me.” Then his brother's eye Flashed pride and love; he spake and smiled And felt in death life's quickening flame, And answered: “Balan is my name, The good knight Balen's brother; fame Calls and miscalls him wild.” The cry from Balen's lips that sprang Sprang sharper than his sword's stroke rang. More keen than death's or memory's fang, Through sense and soul the shuddering pang Shivered: and scarce he had cried, “Alas That ever I should see this day,” When sorrow swooned from him away As blindly back he fell, and lay Where sleep lets anguish pass. But Balan rose on hands and knees And crawled by childlike dim degrees Up toward his brother, as a breeze Creeps wingless over sluggard seas When all the wind's heart fails it: so Beneath their mother's eyes had he, A babe that laughed with joy to be, Made toward him standing by her knee For love's sake long ago. Then, gathering strength up for a space, From off his brother's dying face With dying hands that wrought apace While death and life would grant them grace He loosed his helm and knew not him, So scored with blood it was, and hewn Athwart with darkening wounds: but soon Life strove and shuddered through the swoon Wherein its light lay dim. And sorrow set these chained words free: “O Balan, O my brother! me Thou hast slain, and I, my brother, thee: And now far hence, on shore and sea, Shall all the wide world speak of us.” “Alas,” said Balan, “that I might Not know you, seeing two swords were dight About you; now the unanswering sight Hath here found answer thus. “Because you bore another shield Than yours, that even ere youth could wield Like arms with manhood's tried and steeled Shone as my star of battle-field, I deemed it surely might not be My brother.” Then his brother spake Fiercely: “Would God, for thy sole sake, I had my life again, to take Revenge for only thee! “For all this deadly work was wrought Of one false knight's false word and thought, Whose mortal craft and counsel caught And snared my faith who doubted nought, And made me put my shield away. Ah, might I live, I would destroy That castle for its customs: joy There makes of grief a deadly toy, And death makes night of day.” “Well done were that, if aught were done Well ever here beneath the sun,” Said Balan: “better work were none: For hither since I came and won A woful honour born of death, When here my hap it was to slay A knight who kept this island way, I might not pass by night or day Hence, as this token saith. “No more shouldst thou, for all the might Of heart and hand that seals thee knight Most noble of all that see the light, Brother, hadst thou but slain in fight Me, and arisen unscathed and whole, As would to God thou hadst risen! though here Light is as darkness, hope as fear, And love as hate: and none draws near Save toward a mortal goal.” Then, fair as any poison-flower Whose blossom blights the withering bower Whereon its blasting breath has power, Forth fared the lady of the tower With many a lady and many a knight, And came across the water-way Even where on death's dim border lay Those brethren sent of her to slay And die in kindless fight. And all those hard light hearts were swayed With pity passing like a shade That stays not, and may be not stayed, To hear the mutual moan they made, Each to behold his brother die, Saying, “Both we came out of one tomb, One star-crossed mother's woful womb, And so within one grave-pit's gloom Untimely shall we lie.” And Balan prayed, as God should bless That lady for her gentleness, That where the battle's mortal stress Had made for them perforce to press The bed whence never man may rise They twain, free now from hopes and fears, Might sleep; and she, as one that hears, Bowed her bright head: and very tears Fell from her cold fierce eyes. Then Balen prayed her send a priest To housel them, that ere they ceased The hansel of the heavenly feast That fills with light from the answering east The sunset of the life of man Might bless them, and their lips be kissed With death's requickening eucharist, And death's and life's dim sunlit mist Pass as a stream that ran. And so their dying rites were done: And Balen, seeing the death-struck sun Sink, spake as he whose goal is won: “Now, when our trophied tomb is one, And over us our tale is writ, How two that loved each other, two Born and begotten brethren, slew Each other, none that reads anew Shall choose but weep for it. “And no good knight and no good man Whose eye shall ever come to scan The record of the imperious ban That made our life so sad a span Shall read or hear, who shall not pray For us for ever.” Then anon Died Balan; but the sun was gone, And deep the stars of midnight shone, Ere Balen passed away. And there low lying, as hour on hour Fled, all his life in all its flower Came back as in a sunlit shower Of dreams, when sweet-souled sleep has power On life less sweet and glad to be. He drank the draught of life's first wine Again: he saw the moorland shine, The rioting rapids of the Tyne, The woods, the cliffs, the sea. The joy that lives at heart and home, The joy to rest, the joy to roam, The joy of crags and scaurs he clomb, The rapture of the encountering foam Embraced and breasted of the boy, The first good steed his knees bestrode, The first wild sound of songs that flowed Through ears that thrilled and heart that glowed, Fulfilled his death with joy. So, dying not as a coward that dies And dares not look in death's dim eyes Straight as the stars on seas and skies Whence moon and sun recoil and rise, He looked on life and death, and slept. And there with morning Merlin came, And on the tomb that told their fame He wrote by Balan's Balen's name, And gazed thereon, and wept. For all his heart within him yearned With pity like as fire that burned. The fate his fateful eye discerned Far off now dimmed it, ere he turned His face toward Camelot, to tell Arthur of all the storms that woke Round Balen, and the dolorous stroke, And how that last blind battle broke The consummated spell. “Alas,” King Arthur said, “this day I have heard the worst that woe might say: For in this world that wanes away I know not two such knights as they.” This is the tale that memory writes Of men whose names like stars shall stand, Balen and Balan, sure of hand, Two brethren of Northumberland, In life and death good knights.

THE ARGUMENT Althæa, daughter of Thestius and Eurythemis, queen of Calydon, being with child of Meleager her first-born son, dreamed that she brought forth a brand burning; and upon his birth came the three Fates and prophesied of him three things, namely these; that he should have great strength of his hands, and good fortune in this life, and that he should live no longer when the brand then in the fire were consumed: wherefore his mother plucked it forth and kept it by her. And the child being a man grown sailed with Jason after the fleece of gold, and won himself great praise of all men living; and when the tribes of the north and west made war upon Ætolia, he fought against their army and scattered it. But Artemis, having at the first stirred up these tribes to war against Œneus king of Calydon, because he had offered sacrifice to all the gods saving her alone, but her he had forgotten to honour, was yet more wroth because of the destruction of this army, and sent upon the land of Calydon a wild boar which slew many and wasted all their increase, but him could none slay, and many went against him and perished. Then were all the chief men of Greece gathered together, and among them Atalanta daughter of Iasius the Arcadian, a virgin; for whose sake Artemis let slay the boar, seeing she favoured the maiden greatly; and Meleager having despatched it gave the spoil thereof to Atalanta, as one beyond measure enamoured of her; but the brethren of Althæa his mother, Toxeus and Plexippus, with such others as misliked that she only should bear off the praise whereas many had borne the labour, laid wait for her to take away her spoil; but Meleager fought against them and slew them: whom when Althæa their sister beheld and knew to be slain of her son, she waxed for wrath and sorrow like as one mad, and taking the brand whereby the measure of her son's life was meted to him, she cast it upon a fire; and with the wasting thereof his life likewise wasted away, that being brought back to his father's house he died in a brief space; and his mother also endured not long after for very sorrow; and this was his end, and the end of that hunting. ???? ?? ????? ??? ????????? ????????? ?????, ??? ? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?????? ???? ????????, ?????????? ?????? ???????? ????? ?????, ???? ????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ?? ???? ???? ???????????? ?? ????.

THE PERSONS CHIEF HUNTSMAN CHORUS ALTHÆA MELEAGER ŒNEUS ATALANTA TOXEUS PLEXIPPUS HERALD MESSENGER SECOND MESSENGER CHIEF HUNTSMAN Maiden, and mistress of the months and stars Now folded in the flowerless fields of heaven, Goddess whom all gods love with threefold heart, Being treble in thy divided deity, A light for dead men and dark hours, a foot Swift on the hills as morning, and a hand To all things fierce and fleet that roar and range Mortal, with gentler shafts than snow or sleep; Hear now and help and lift no violent hand, But favourable and fair as thine eye's beam Hidden and shown in heaven; for I all night Amid the king's hounds and the hunting men Have wrought and worshipped toward thee; nor shall man See goodlier hounds or deadlier edge of spears; But for the end, that lies unreached at yet Between the hands and on the knees of gods. O fair-faced sun, killing the stars and dews And dreams and desolation of the night! Rise up, shine, stretch thine hand out, with thy bow Touch the most dimmest height of trembling heaven, And burn and break the dark about thy ways, Shot through and through with arrows; let thine hair Lighten as flame above that flameless shell Which was the moon, and thine eyes fill the world And thy lips kindle with swift beams; let earth Laugh, and the long sea fiery from thy feet Through all the roar and ripple of streaming springs And foam in reddening flakes and flying flowers Shaken from hands and blown from lips of nymphs Whose hair or breast divides the wandering wave With salt close tresses cleaving lock to lock, All gold, or shuddering and unfurrowed snow; And all the winds about thee with their wings, And fountain-heads of all the watered world; Each horn of Acheloüs, and the green Euenus, wedded with the straitening sea. For in fair time thou comest; come also thou, Twin-born with him, and virgin, Artemis, And give our spears their spoil, the wild boar's hide, Sent in thine anger against us for sin done And bloodless altars without wine or fire. Him now consume thou; for thy sacrifice With sanguine-shining steam divides the dawn, And one, the maiden rose of all thy maids, Arcadian Atalanta, snowy-souled, Fair as the snow and footed as the wind, From Ladon and well-wooded Mænalus Over the firm hills and the fleeting sea Hast thou drawn hither, and many an armed king, Heroes, the crown of men, like gods in fight. Moreover out of all the Ætolian land, From the full-flowered Lelantian pasturage To what of fruitful field the son of Zeus Won from the roaring river and labouring sea When the wild god shrank in his horn and fled And foamed and lessened through his wrathful fords Leaving clear lands that steamed with sudden sun, These virgins with the lightening of the day Bring thee fresh wreaths and their own sweeter hair, Luxurious locks and flower-like mixed with flowers, Clean offering, and chaste hymns; but me the time Divides from these things; whom do thou not less Help and give honour, and to mine hounds good speed, And edge to spears, and luck to each man's hand. CHORUS When the hounds of spring are on winter's traces, The mother of months in meadow or plain Fills the shadows and windy places With lisp of leaves and ripple of rain; And the brown bright nightingale amorous Is half assuaged for Itylus, For the Thracian ships and the foreign faces, The tongueless vigil, and all the pain. Come with bows bent and with emptying of quivers, Maiden most perfect, lady of light, With a noise of winds and many rivers, With a clamour of waters, and with might; Bind on thy sandals, O thou most fleet, Over the splendour and speed of thy feet; For the faint east quickens, the wan west shivers, Round the feet of the day and the feet of the night. Where shall we find her, how shall we sing to her, Fold our hands round her knees, and cling? O that man's heart were as fire and could spring to her, Fire, or the strength of the streams that spring! For the stars and the winds are unto her As raiment, as songs of the harp-player; For the risen stars and the fallen cling to her, And the southwest-wind and the west-wind sing. For winter's rains and ruins are over, And all the season of snows and sins; The days dividing lover and lover, The light that loses, the night that wins; And time remembered is grief forgotten, And frosts are slain and flowers begotten, And in green underwood and cover Blossom by blossom the spring begins. The full streams feed on flower of rushes, Ripe grasses trammel a travelling foot, The faint fresh flame of the young year flushes From leaf to flower and flower to fruit; And fruit and leaf are as gold and fire, And the oat is heard above the lyre, And the hoofèd heel of a satyr crushes The chestnut-husk at the chestnut-root. And Pan by noon and Bacchus by night, Fleeter of foot than the fleet-foot kid, Follows with dancing and fills with delight The Mænad and the Bassarid; And soft as lips that laugh and hide The laughing leaves of the trees divide, And screen from seeing and leave in sight The god pursuing, the maiden hid. The ivy falls with the Bacchanal's hair Over her eyebrows hiding her eyes; The wild vine slipping down leaves bare Her bright breast shortening into sighs; The wild vine slips with the weight of its leaves, But the berried ivy catches and cleaves To the limbs that glitter, the feet that scare The wolf that follows, the fawn that flies. ALTHÆA What do ye singing? what is this ye sing? CHORUS Flowers bring we, and pure lips that please the gods, And raiment meet for service: lest the day Turn sharp with all its honey in our lips. ALTHÆA Night, a black hound, follows the white fawn day, Swifter than dreams the white flown feet of sleep; Will ye pray back the night with any prayers? And though the spring put back a little while Winter, and snows that plague all men for sin, And the iron time of cursing, yet I know Spring shall be ruined with the rain, and storm Eat up like fire the ashen autumn days. I marvel what men do with prayers awake Who dream and die with dreaming; any god, Yea the least god of all things called divine, Is more than sleep and waking; yet we say, Perchance by praying a man shall match his god. For if sleep have no mercy, and man's dreams Bite to the blood and burn into the bone, What shall this man do waking? By the gods, He shall not pray to dream sweet things to-night, Having dreamt once more bitter things than death. CHORUS Queen, but what is it that hath burnt thine heart? For thy speech flickers like a blown-out flame. ALTHÆA Look, ye say well, and know not what ye say; For all my sleep is turned into a fire, And all my dreams to stuff that kindles it. CHORUS Yet one doth well being patient of the gods. ALTHÆA Yea, lest they smite us with some four-foot plague. CHORUS But when time spreads find out some herb for it. ALTHÆA And with their healing herbs infect our blood. CHORUS What ails thee to be jealous of their ways? ALTHÆA What if they give us poisonous drinks for wine? CHORUS They have their will; much talking mends it not. ALTHÆA And gall for milk, and cursing for a prayer? CHORUS Have they not given life, and the end of life? ALTHÆA Lo, where they heal, they help not; thus they do, They mock us with a little piteousness, And we say prayers, and weep; but at the last, Sparing awhile, they smite and spare no whit. CHORUS Small praise man gets dispraising the high gods: What have they done that thou dishonourest them? ALTHÆA First Artemis for all this harried land I praise not, and for wasting of the boar That mars with tooth and tusk and fiery feet Green pasturage and the grace of standing corn And meadow and marsh with springs and unblown leaves, Flocks and swift herds and all that bite sweet grass, I praise her not; what things are these to praise? CHORUS But when the king did sacrifice, and gave Each god fair dues of wheat and blood and wine, Her not with bloodshed nor burnt-offering Revered he, nor with salt or cloven cake; Wherefore being wroth she plagued the land; but now Takes off from us fate and her heavy things. Which deed of these twain were not good to praise? For a just deed looks always either way With blameless eyes, and mercy is no fault. ALTHÆA Yea, but a curse she hath sent above all these To hurt us where she healed us; and hath lit Fire where the old fire went out, and where the wind Slackened, hath blown on us with deadlier air. CHORUS What storm is this that tightens all our sail? ALTHÆA Love, a thwart sea-wind full of rain and foam. CHORUS Whence blown, and born under what stormier star? ALTHÆA Southward across Euenus from the sea. CHORUS Thy speech turns toward Arcadia like blown wind. ALTHÆA Sharp as the north sets when the snows are out. CHORUS Nay, for this maiden hath no touch of love. ALTHÆA I would she had sought in some cold gulf of sea Love, or in dens where strange beasts lurk, or fire, Or snows on the extreme hills, or iron land Where no spring is; I would she had sought therein And found, or ever love had found her here. CHORUS She is holier than all holy days or things, The sprinkled water or fume of perfect fire; Chaste, dedicated to pure prayers, and filled With higher thoughts than heaven; a maiden clean, Pure iron, fashioned for a sword; and man She loves not; what should one such do with love? ALTHÆA Look you, I speak not as one light of wit, But as a queen speaks, being heart-vexed; for oft I hear my brothers wrangling in mid hall, And am not moved; and my son chiding them, And these things nowise move me, but I know Foolish and wise men must be to the end, And feed myself with patience; but this most, This moves me, that for wise men as for fools Love is one thing, an evil thing, and turns Choice words and wisdom into fire and air. And in the end shall no joy come, but grief, Sharp words and soul's division and fresh tears Flower-wise upon the old root of tears brought forth, Fruit-wise upon the old flower of tears sprung up, Pitiful sighs, and much regrafted pain. These things are in my presage, and myself Am part of them and know not; but in dreams The gods are heavy on me, and all the fates Shed fire across my eyelids mixed with night, And burn me blind, and disilluminate My sense of seeing, and my perspicuous soul Darken with vision; seeing I see not, hear And hearing am not holpen, but mine eyes Stain many tender broideries in the bed Drawn up about my face that I may weep And the king wake not; and my brows and lips Tremble and sob in sleeping, like swift flames That tremble, or water when it sobs with heat Kindled from under; and my tears fill my breast And speck the fair dyed pillows round the king With barren showers and salter than the sea, Such dreams divide me dreaming; for long since I dreamed that out of this my womb had sprung Fire and a firebrand; this was ere my son, Meleager, a goodly flower in fields of fight, Felt the light touch him coming forth, and wailed Childlike; but yet he was not; and in time I bare him, and my heart was great; for yet So royally was never strong man born, Nor queen so nobly bore as noble a thing As this my son was: such a birth God sent And such a grace to bear it. Then came in Three weaving women, and span each a thread, Saying This for strength and That for luck, and one Saying Till the brand upon the hearth burn down, So long shall this man see good days and live. And I with gathered raiment from the bed Sprang, and drew forth the brand, and cast on it Water, and trod the flame bare-foot, and crushed With naked hand spark beaten out of spark And blew against and quenched it; for I said, These are the most high Fates that dwell with us, And we find favour a little in their sight, A little, and more we miss of, and much time Foils us; howbeit they have pitied me, O son, And thee most piteous, thee a tenderer thing Than any flower of fleshly seed alive. Wherefore I kissed and hid him with my hands, And covered under arms and hair, and wept, And feared to touch him with my tears, and laughed; So light a thing was this man, grown so great Men cast their heads back, seeing against the sun Blaze the armed man carven on his shield, and hear The laughter of little bells along the brace Ring, as birds singing or flutes blown, and watch, High up, the cloven shadow of either plume Divide the bright light of the brass, and make His helmet as a windy and wintering moon Seen through blown cloud and plume-like drift, when ships Drive, and men strive with all the sea, and oars Break, and the beaks dip under, drinking death; Yet was he then but a span long, and moaned With inarticulate mouth inseparate words, And with blind lips and fingers wrung my breast Hard, and thrust out with foolish hands and feet, Murmuring; but those grey women with bound hair Who fright the gods frighted not him; he laughed Seeing them, and pushed out hands to feel and haul Distaff and thread, intangible; but they Passed, and I hid the brand, and in my heart Laughed likewise, having all my will of heaven. But now I know not if to left or right The gods have drawn us hither; for again I dreamt, and saw the black brand burst on fire As a branch bursts in flower, and saw the flame Fade flower-wise, and Death came and with dry lips Blew the charred ash into my breast; and Love Trampled the ember and crushed it with swift feet. This I have also at heart; that not for me, Not for me only or son of mine, O girls, The gods have wrought life, and desire of life, Heart's love and heart's division; but for all There shines one sun and one wind blows till night. And when night comes the wind sinks and the sun, And there is no light after, and no storm, But sleep and much forgetfulness of things. In such wise I gat knowledge of the gods Years hence, and heard high sayings of one most wise, Eurythemis my mother, who beheld With eyes alive and spake with lips of these As one on earth disfleshed and disallied From breath or blood corruptible; such gifts Time gave her, and an equal soul to these And equal face to all things; thus she said. But whatsoever intolerable or glad The swift hours weave and unweave, I go hence Full of mine own soul, perfect of myself, Toward mine and me sufficient; and what chance The gods cast lots for and shake out on us, That shall we take, and that much bear withal. And now, before these gather to the hunt, I will go arm my son and bring him forth, Lest love or some man's anger work him harm. CHORUS Before the beginning of years There came to the making of man Time, with a gift of tears; Grief, with a glass that ran; Pleasure, with pain for leaven; Summer, with flowers that fell; Remembrance fallen from heaven, And madness risen from hell; Strength without hands to smite; Love that endures for a breath: Night, the shadow of light, And life, the shadow of death. And the high gods took in hand Fire, and the falling of tears, And a measure of sliding sand From under the feet of the years; And froth and drift of the sea; And dust of the labouring earth; And bodies of things to be In the houses of death and of birth; And wrought with weeping and laughter, And fashioned with loathing and love, With life before and after And death beneath and above, For a day and a night and a morrow, That his strength might endure for a span With travail and heavy sorrow, The holy spirit of man. From the winds of the north and the south They gathered as unto strife; They breathed upon his mouth, They filled his body with life; Eyesight and speech they wrought For the veils of the soul therein, A time for labour and thought, A time to serve and to sin; They gave him light in his ways, And love, and a space for delight, And beauty and length of days, And night, and sleep in the night. His speech is a burning fire; With his lips he travaileth; In his heart is a blind desire, In his eyes foreknowledge of death; He weaves, and is clothed with derision; Sows, and he shall not reap; His life is a watch or a vision Between a sleep and a sleep. MELEAGER O sweet new heaven and air without a star, Fair day, be fair and welcome, as to men With deeds to do and praise to pluck from thee. Come forth a child, born with clear sound and light, With laughter and swift limbs and prosperous looks; That this great hunt with heroes for the hounds May leave thee memorable and us well sped. ALTHÆA Son, first I praise thy prayer, then bid thee speed; But the gods hear men's hands before their lips, And heed beyond all crying and sacrifice Light of things done and noise of labouring men. But thou, being armed and perfect for the deed, Abide; for like rain-flakes in a wind they grow, The men thy fellows, and the choice of the world, Bound to root out the tuskèd plague, and leave Thanks and safe days and peace in Calydon. MELEAGER For the whole city and all the low-lying land Flames, and the soft air sounds with them that come; The gods give all these fruit of all their works. ALTHÆA Set thine eye thither and fix thy spirit and say Whom there thou knowest; for sharp mixed shadow and wind Blown up between the morning and the mist, With steam of steeds and flash of bridle or wheel, And fire, and parcels of the broken dawn, And dust divided by hard light, and spears That shine and shift as the edge of wild beasts' eyes, Smite upon mine; so fiery their blind edge Burns, and bright points break up and baffle day. MELEAGER The first, for many I know not, being far off, Peleus the Larissæan, couched with whom Sleeps the white sea-bred wife and silver-shod, Fair as fled foam, a goddess; and their son Most swift and splendid of men's children born, Most like a god, full of the future fame. ALTHÆA Who are these shining like one sundered star? MELEAGER Thy sister's sons, a double flower of men. ALTHÆA O sweetest kin to me in all the world, O twin-born blood of Leda, gracious heads Like kindled lights in untempestuous heaven, Fair flower-like stars on the iron foam of fight, With what glad heart and kindliness of soul, Even to the staining of both eyes with tears And kindling of warm eyelids with desire, A great way off I greet you, and rejoice Seeing you so fair, and moulded like as gods. Far off ye come, and least in years of these, But lordliest, but worth love to look upon. MELEAGER Even such (for sailing hither I saw far hence, And where Eurotas hollows his moist rock Nigh Sparta with a strenuous-hearted stream) Even such I saw their sisters; one swan-white, The little Helen, and less fair than she Fair Clytæmnestra, grave as pasturing fawns Who feed and fear some arrow; but at whiles, As one smitten with love or wrung with joy, She laughs and lightens with her eyes, and then Weeps; whereat Helen, having laughed, weeps too, And the other chides her, and she being chid speaks nought, But cheeks and lips and eyelids kisses her, Laughing; so fare they, as in their bloomless bud And full of unblown life, the blood of gods. ALTHÆA Sweet days befall them and good loves and lords, And tender and temperate honours of the hearth, Peace, and a perfect life and blameless bed. But who shows next an eagle wrought in gold, That flames and beats broad wings against the sun And with void mouth gapes after emptier prey? MELEAGER Know by that sign the reign of Telamon Between the fierce mouths of the encountering brine On the strait reefs of twice-washed Salamis. ALTHÆA For like one great of hand he bears himself, Vine-chapleted, with savours of the sea, Glittering as wine and moving as a wave. But who girt round there roughly follows him? MELEAGER Ancæus, great of hand, an iron bulk, Two-edged for fight as the axe against his arm, Who drives against the surge of stormy spears Full-sailed; him Cepheus follows, his twin-born, Chief name next his of all Arcadian men. ALTHÆA Praise be with men abroad; chaste lives with us, Home-keeping days and household reverences. MELEAGER Next by the left unsandalled foot know thou The sail and oar of this Ætolian land, Thy brethren, Toxeus and the violent-souled Plexippus, over-swift with hand and tongue; For hands are fruitful, but the ignorant mouth Blows and corrupts their work with barren breath. ALTHÆA Speech too bears fruit, being worthy; and air blows down Things poisonous, and high-seated violences, And with charmed words and songs have men put out Wild evil, and the fire of tyrannies. MELEAGER Yea, all things have they, save the gods and love. ALTHÆA Love thou the law and cleave to things ordained. MELEAGER Law lives upon their lips whom these applaud. ALTHÆA How sayest thou these? what god applauds new things? MELEAGER Zeus, who hath fear and custom under foot. ALTHÆA But loves not laws thrown down and lives awry. MELEAGER Yet is not less himself than his own law. ALTHÆA Nor shifts and shuffles old things up and down. MELEAGER But what he will remoulds and discreates. ALTHÆA Much, but not this, that each thing live its life. MELEAGER Nor only live, but lighten and lift up higher. ALTHÆA Pride breaks itself, and too much gained is gone. MELEAGER Things gained are gone, but great things done endure. ALTHÆA Child, if a man serve law through all his life And with his whole heart worship, him all gods Praise; but who loves it only with his lips, And not in heart and deed desiring it Hides a perverse will with obsequious words, Him heaven infatuates and his twin-born fate Tracks, and gains on him, scenting sins far off, And the swift hounds of violent death devour. Be man at one with equal-minded gods, So shall he prosper; not through laws torn up, Violated rule and a new face of things. A woman armed makes war upon herself, Unwomanlike, and treads down use and wont And the sweet common honour that she hath, Love, and the cry of children, and the hand Trothplight and mutual mouth of marriages. This doth she, being unloved; whom if one love, Not fire nor iron and the wide-mouthed wars Are deadlier than her lips or braided hair. For of the one comes poison, and a curse Falls from the other and burns the lives of men. But thou, son, be not filled with evil dreams, Nor with desire of these things; for with time Blind love burns out; but if one feed it full Till some discolouring stain dyes all his life, He shall keep nothing praiseworthy, nor die The sweet wise death of old men honourable, Who have lived out all the length of all their years Blameless, and seen well-pleased the face of gods, And without shame and without fear have wrought Things memorable, and while their days held out In sight of all men and the sun's great light Have gat them glory and given of their own praise To the earth that bare them and the day that bred, Home friends and far-off hospitalities, And filled with gracious and memorial fame Lands loved of summer or washed by violent seas, Towns populous and many unfooted ways, And alien lips and native with their own. But when white age and venerable death Mow down the strength and life within their limbs, Drain out the blood and darken their clear eyes, Immortal honour is on them, having past Through splendid life and death desirable To the clear seat and remote throne of souls, Lands indiscoverable in the unheard-of west, Round which the strong stream of a sacred sea Rolls without wind for ever, and the snow There shows not her white wings and windy feet, Nor thunder nor swift rain saith anything, Nor the sun burns, but all things rest and thrive; And these, filled full of days, divine and dead, Sages and singers fiery from the god, And such as loved their land and all things good And, best beloved of best men, liberty, Free lives and lips, free hands of men free-born, And whatsoever on earth was honourable And whosoever of all the ephemeral seed, Live there a life no liker to the gods But nearer than their life of terrene days. Love thou such life and look for such a death. But from the light and fiery dreams of love Spring heavy sorrows and a sleepless life, Visions not dreams, whose lids no charm shall close Nor song assuage them waking; and swift death Crushes with sterile feet the unripening ear, Treads out the timeless vintage; whom do thou Eschewing embrace the luck of this thy life, Not without honour; and it shall bear to thee Such fruit as men reap from spent hours and wear, Few men, but happy; of whom be thou, O son, Happiest, if thou submit thy soul to fate, And set thine eyes and heart on hopes high-born And divine deeds and abstinence divine. So shalt thou be toward all men all thy days As light and might communicable, and burn From heaven among the stars above the hours, And break not as a man breaks nor burn down: For to whom other of all heroic names Have the gods given his life in hand as thine? And gloriously hast thou lived, and made thy life To me that bare thee and to all men born Thankworthy, a praise for ever; and hast won fame When wild wars broke all round thy father's house, And the mad people of windy mountain ways Laid spears against us like a sea, and all Ætolia thundered with Thessalian hoofs; Yet these, as wind baffles the foam, and beats Straight back the relaxed ripple, didst thou break And loosen all their lances, till undone And man from man they fell; for ye twain stood God against god, Ares and Artemis, And thou the mightier; wherefore she unleashed A sharp-toothed curse thou too shalt overcome; For in the greener blossom of thy life Ere the full blade caught flower, and when time gave Respite, thou didst not slacken soul nor sleep, But with great hand and heart seek praise of men Out of sharp straits and many a grievous thing, Seeing the strange foam of undivided seas On channels never sailed in, and by shores Where the old winds cease not blowing, and all the night Thunders, and day is no delight to men. CHORUS Meleager, a noble wisdom and fair words The gods have given this woman; hear thou these. MELEAGER O mother, I am not fain to strive in speech Nor set my mouth against thee, who art wise Even as they say and full of sacred words. But one thing I know surely, and cleave to this; That though I be not subtle of wit as thou Nor womanlike to weave sweet words, and melt Mutable minds of wise men as with fire, I too, doing justly and reverencing the gods, Shall not want wit to see what things be right. For whom they love and whom reject, being gods, There is no man but seeth, and in good time Submits himself, refraining all his heart. And I too as thou sayest have seen great things; Seen otherwhere, but chiefly when the sail First caught between stretched ropes the roaring west, And all our oars smote eastward, and the wind First flung round faces of seafaring men White splendid snow-flakes of the sundering foam, And the first furrow in virginal green sea Followed the plunging ploughshare of hewn pine, And closed, as when deep sleep subdues man's breath Lips close and heart subsides; and closing, shone Sunlike with many a Nereid's hair, and moved Round many a trembling mouth of doubtful gods, Risen out of sunless and sonorous gulfs Through waning water and into shallow light, That watched us; and when flying the dove was snared As with men's hands, but we shot after and sped Clear through the irremeable Symplegades; And chiefliest when hoar beach and herbless cliff Stood out ahead from Colchis, and we heard Clefts hoarse with wind, and saw through narrowing reefs The lightning of the intolerable wave Flash, and the white wet flame of breakers burn Far under a kindling south-wind, as a lamp Burns and bends all its blowing flame one way; Wild heights untravelled of the wind, and vales Cloven seaward by their violent streams, and white With bitter flowers and bright salt scurf of brine; Heard sweep their sharp swift gales, and bowing birdwise Shriek with birds' voices, and with furious feet Tread loose the long skirts of a storm; and saw The whole white Euxine clash together and fall Full-mouthed, and thunderous from a thousand throats: Yet we drew thither and won the fleece and won Medea, deadlier than the sea; but there Seeing many a wonder and fearful things to men I saw not one thing like this one seen here, Most fair and fearful, feminine, a god, Faultless; whom I that love not, being unlike, Fear, and give honour, and choose from all the gods. ŒNEUS Lady, the daughter of Thestius, and thou, son, Not ignorant of your strife nor light of wit, Scared with vain dreams and fluttering like spent fire, I come to judge between you, but a king Full of past days and wise from years endured. Nor thee I praise, who art fain to undo things done: Nor thee, who art swift to esteem them overmuch. For what the hours have given is given, and this Changeless; howbeit these change, and in good time Devise new things and good, not one thing still. Us have they sent now at our need for help Among men armed a woman, foreign born, Virgin, not like the natural flower of things That grows and bears and brings forth fruit and dies; Unlovable, no light for a husband's house, Espoused; a glory among unwedded girls, And chosen of gods who reverence maidenhood. These too we honour in honouring her; but thou, Abstain thy feet from following, and thine eyes From amorous touch; nor set toward hers thine heart, Son, lest hate bear no deadlier fruit than love. ALTHÆA O king, thou art wise, but wisdom halts; and just, But the gods love not justice more than fate, And smite the righteous and the violent mouth, And mix with insolent blood the reverent man's, And bruise the holier as the lying lips. Enough; for wise words fail me, and my heart Takes fire and trembles flamewise, O my son, O child, for thine head's sake; mine eyes wax thick, Turning toward thee, so goodly a weaponed man, So glorious; and for love of thine own eyes They are darkened, and tears burn them, fierce as fire, And my lips pause and my soul sinks with love. But by thine hand, by thy sweet life and eyes, By thy great heart and these clasped knees, O son, I pray thee that thou slay me not with thee. For there was never a mother woman-born Loved her sons better; and never a queen of men More perfect in her heart toward whom she loved. For what lies light on many and they forget, Small things and transitory as a wind o' the sea, I forget never; I have seen thee all thine years A man in arms, strong and a joy to men Seeing thine head glitter and thine hand burn its way Through a heavy and iron furrow of sundering spears; But always also a flower of three suns old, The small one thing that lying drew down my life To lie with thee and feed thee; a child and weak, Mine, a delight to no man, sweet to me. Who then sought to thee? who gat help? who knew If thou wert goodly? nay, no man at all. Or what sea saw thee, or sounded with thine oar, Child? or what strange land shone with war through thee? But fair for me thou wert, O little life, Fruitless, the fruit of mine own flesh, and blind, More than much gold, ungrown, a foolish flower. For silver nor bright snow nor feather of foam Was whiter, and no gold yellower than thine hair, O child, my child; and now thou art lordlier grown, Not lovelier, nor a new thing in mine eyes, I charge thee by thy soul and this my breast, Fear thou the gods and me and thine own heart, Lest all these turn against thee; for who knows What wind upon what wave of altering time Shall speak a storm and blow calamity? And there is nothing stabile in the world But the gods break it; yet not less, fair son, If but one thing be stronger, if one endure, Surely the bitter and the rooted love That burns between us, going from me to thee, Shall more endure than all things. What dost thou, Following strange loves? why wilt thou kill mine heart? Lo, I talk wild and windy words, and fall From my clear wits, and seem of mine own self Dethroned, dispraised, disseated; and my mind, That was my crown, breaks, and mine heart is gone, And I am naked of my soul, and stand Ashamed, as a mean woman; take thou thought: Live if thou wilt, and if thou wilt not, look, The gods have given thee life to lose or keep, Thou shalt not die as men die, but thine end Fallen upon thee shall break me unaware. MELEAGER Queen, my whole heart is molten with thy tears, And my limbs yearn with pity of thee, and love Compels with grief mine eyes and labouring breath; For what thou art I know thee, and this thy breast And thy fair eyes I worship, and am bound Toward thee in spirit and love thee in all my soul. For there is nothing terribler to men Than the sweet face of mothers, and the might. But what shall be let be; for us the day Once only lives a little, and is not found. Time and the fruitful hour are more than we, And these lay hold upon us; but thou, God, Zeus, the sole steersman of the helm of things, Father, be swift to see us, and as thou wilt Help: or if adverse, as thou wilt, refrain. CHORUS We have seen thee, O Love, thou art fair; thou art goodly, O Love; Thy wings make light in the air as the wings of a dove. Thy feet are as winds that divide the stream of the sea; Earth is thy covering to hide thee, the garment of thee. Thou art swift and subtle and blind as a flame of fire; Before thee the laughter, behind thee the tears of desire; And twain go forth beside thee, a man with a maid; Her eyes are the eyes of a bride whom delight makes afraid; As the breath in the buds that stir is her bridal breath: But Fate is the name of her; and his name is Death. For an evil blossom was born Of sea-foam and the frothing of blood, Blood-red and bitter of fruit, And the seed of it laughter and tears, And the leaves of it madness and scorn; A bitter flower from the bud, Sprung of the sea without root, Sprung without graft from the years. The weft of the world was untorn That is woven of the day on the night, The hair of the hours was not white Nor the raiment of time overworn, When a wonder, a world's delight, A perilous goddess was born; And the waves of the sea as she came Clove, and the foam at her feet, Fawning, rejoiced to bring forth A fleshly blossom, a flame Filling the heavens with heat To the cold white ends of the north. And in air the clamorous birds, And men upon earth that hear Sweet articulate words Sweetly divided apart, And in shallow and channel and mere The rapid and footless herds, Rejoiced, being foolish of heart. For all they said upon earth, She is fair, she is white like a dove, And the life of the world in her breath Breathes, and is born at her birth; For they knew thee for mother of love, And knew thee not mother of death. What hadst thou to do being born, Mother, when winds were at ease, As a flower of the springtime of corn, A flower of the foam of the seas? For bitter thou wast from thy birth, Aphrodite, a mother of strife; For before thee some rest was on earth, A little respite from tears; A little pleasure of life; For life was not then as thou art, But as one that waxeth in years Sweet-spoken, a fruitful wife; Earth had no thorn, and desire No sting, neither death any dart; What hadst thou to do amongst these, Thou, clothed with a burning fire, Thou, girt with sorrow of heart, Thou, sprung of the seed of the seas As an ear from a seed of corn, As a brand plucked forth of a pyre, As a ray shed forth of the morn, For division of soul and disease, For a dart and a sting and a thorn? What ailed thee then to be born? Was there not evil enough, Mother, and anguish on earth Born with a man at his birth, Wastes underfoot, and above Storm out of heaven, and dearth Shaken down from the shining thereof, Wrecks from afar overseas And peril of shallow and firth, And tears that spring and increase In the barren places of mirth, That thou, having wings as a dove, Being girt with desire for a girth, That thou must come after these, That thou must lay on him love? Thou shouldst not so have been born: But death should have risen with thee, Mother, and visible fear, Grief, and the wringing of hands, And noise of many that mourn; The smitten bosom, the knee Bowed, and in each man's ear A cry as of perishing lands, A moan as of people in prison, A tumult of infinite griefs; And thunder of storm on the sands, And wailing of wives on the shore; And under thee newly arisen Loud shoals and shipwrecking reefs, Fierce air and violent light; Sail rent and sundering oar, Darkness, and noises of night; Clashing of streams in the sea, Wave against wave as a sword, Clamour of currents, and foam; Rains making ruin on earth, Winds that wax ravenous and roam As wolves in a wolfish horde; Fruits growing faint in the tree, And blind things dead in their birth; Famine, and blighting of corn, When thy time was come to be born. All these we know of; but thee Who shall discern or declare? In the uttermost ends of the sea The light of thine eyelids and hair, The light of thy bosom as fire Between the wheel of the sun And the flying flames of the air? Wilt thou turn thee not yet nor have pity, But abide with despair and desire And the crying of armies undone, Lamentation of one with another And breaking of city by city; The dividing of friend against friend, The severing of brother and brother; Wilt thou utterly bring to an end? Have mercy, mother! For against all men from of old Thou hast set thine hand as a curse, And cast out gods from their places. These things are spoken of thee. Strong kings and goodly with gold Thou hast found out arrows to pierce, And made their kingdoms and races As dust and surf of the sea. All these, overburdened with woes And with length of their days waxen weak, Thou slewest; and sentest moreover Upon Tyro an evil thing, Rent hair and a fetter and blows Making bloody the flower of the cheek, Though she lay by a god as a lover, Though fair, and the seed of a king. For of old, being full of thy fire, She endured not longer to wear On her bosom a saffron vest, On her shoulder an ashwood quiver; Being mixed and made one through desire With Enipeus, and all her hair Made moist with his mouth, and her breast Filled full of the foam of the river. ATALANTA Sun, and clear light among green hills, and day Late risen and long sought after, and you just gods Whose hands divide anguish and recompense, But first the sun's white sister, a maid in heaven, On earth of all maids worshipped—hail, and hear, And witness with me if not without sign sent, Not without rule and reverence, I a maid Hallowed, and huntress holy as whom I serve, Here in your sight and eyeshot of these men Stand, girt as they toward hunting, and my shafts Drawn; wherefore all ye stand up on my side, If I be pure and all ye righteous gods, Lest one revile me, a woman, yet no wife, That bear a spear for spindle, and this bow strung For a web woven; and with pure lips salute Heaven, and the face of all the gods, and dawn Filling with maiden flames and maiden flowers The starless fold o' the stars, and making sweet The warm wan heights of the air, moon-trodden ways And breathless gates and extreme hills of heaven. Whom, having offered water and bloodless gifts, Flowers, and a golden circlet of pure hair, Next Artemis I bid be favourable And make this day all golden, hers and ours, Gracious and good and white to the unblamed end. But thou, O well-beloved, of all my days Bid it be fruitful, and a crown for all, To bring forth leaves and bind round all my hair With perfect chaplets woven for thine of thee. For not without the word of thy chaste mouth, For not without law given and clean command, Across the white straits of the running sea From Elis even to the Acheloïan horn, I with clear winds came hither and gentle gods, Far off my father's house, and left uncheered Iasius, and uncheered the Arcadian hills And all their green-haired waters, and all woods Disconsolate, to hear no horn of mine Blown, and behold no flash of swift white feet. MELEAGER For thy name's sake and awe toward thy chaste head, O holiest Atalanta, no man dares Praise thee, though fairer than whom all men praise, And godlike for thy grace of hallowed hair And holy habit of thine eyes, and feet That make the blown foam neither swift nor white Though the wind winnow and whirl it; yet we praise Gods, found because of thee adorable And for thy sake praiseworthiest from all men: Thee therefore we praise also, thee as these, Pure, and a light lit at the hands of gods. TOXEUS How long will ye whet spears with eloquence, Fight, and kill beasts dry-handed with sweet words? Cease, or talk still and slay thy boars at home. PLEXIPPUS Why, if she ride among us for a man, Sit thou for her and spin; a man grown girl Is worth a woman weaponed; sit thou here. MELEAGER Peace, and be wise; no gods love idle speech. PLEXIPPUS Nor any man a man's mouth woman-tongued. MELEAGER For my lips bite not sharper than mine hands. PLEXIPPUS Nay, both bite soft, but no whit softly mine. MELEAGER Keep thine hands clean; they have time enough to stain. PLEXIPPUS For thine shall rest and wax not red to-day. MELEAGER Have all thy will of words; talk out thine heart. ALTHÆA Refrain your lips, O brethren, and my son, Lest words turn snakes and bite you uttering them. TOXEUS Except she give her blood before the gods, What profit shall a maid be among men? PLEXIPPUS Let her come crowned and stretch her throat for a knife, Bleat out her spirit and die, and so shall men Through her too prosper and through prosperous gods, But nowise through her living; shall she live A flower-bud of the flower-bed, or sweet fruit For kisses and the honey-making mouth, And play the shield for strong men and the spear? Then shall the heifer and her mate lock horns, And the bride overbear the groom, and men Gods; for no less division sunders these; Since all things made are seasonable in time, But if one alter unseasonable are all. But thou, O Zeus, hear me that I may slay This beast before thee and no man halve with me Nor woman, lest these mock thee, though a god, Who hast made men strong, and thou being wise be held Foolish; for wise is that thing which endures. ATALANTA Men, and the chosen of all this people, and thou, King, I beseech you a little bear with me. For if my life be shameful that I live, Let the gods witness and their wrath; but these Cast no such word against me. Thou, O mine, O holy, O happy goddess, if I sin Changing the words of women and the works For spears and strange men's faces, hast not thou One shaft of all thy sudden seven that pierced Seven through the bosom or shining throat or side, All couched about one mother's loosening knees, All holy born, engraffed of Tantalus? But if toward any of you I am overbold That take thus much upon me, let him think How I, for all my forest holiness, Fame, and this armed and iron maidenhood, Pay thus much also; I shall have no man's love For ever, and no face of children born Or feeding lips upon me or fastening eyes For ever, nor being dead shall kings my sons Mourn me and bury, and tears on daughters' cheeks Burn; but a cold and sacred life, but strange, But far from dances and the back-blowing torch, Far off from flowers or any bed of man, Shall my life be for ever: me the snows That face the first o' the morning, and cold hills Full of the land-wind and sea-travelling storms And many a wandering wing of noisy nights That know the thunder and hear the thickening wolves— Me the utmost pine and footless frost of woods That talk with many winds and gods, the hours Re-risen, and white divisions of the dawn, Springs thousand-tongued with the intermitting reed And streams that murmur of the mother snow— Me these allure, and know me; but no man Knows, and my goddess only. Lo now, see If one of all you these things vex at all. Would God that any of you had all the praise And I no manner of memory when I die, So might I show before her perfect eyes Pure, whom I follow, a maiden to my death. But for the rest let all have all they will; For is it a grief to you that I have part, Being woman merely, in your male might and deeds Done by main strength? yet in my body is throned As great a heart, and in my spirit, O men, I have not less of godlike. Evil it were That one a coward should mix with you, one hand Fearful, one eye abase itself; and these Well might ye hate and well revile, not me. For not the difference of the several flesh Being vile or noble or beautiful or base Makes praiseworthy, but purer spirit and heart Higher than these meaner mouths and limbs, that feed, Rise, rest, and are and are not; and for me, What should I say? but by the gods of the world And this my maiden body, by all oaths That bind the tongue of men and the evil will, I am not mighty-minded, nor desire Crowns, nor the spoil of slain things nor the fame; Feed ye on these, eat and wax fat; cry out, Laugh, having eaten, and leap without a lyre, Sing, mix the wind with clamour, smite and shake Sonorous timbrels and tumultuous hair, And fill the dance up with tempestuous feet, For I will none; but having prayed my prayers And made thank-offering for prosperities, I shall go hence and no man see me more. What thing is this for you to shout me down, What, for a man to grudge me this my life As it were envious of all yours, and I A thief of reputations? nay, for now, If there be any highest in heaven, a god Above all thrones and thunders of the gods Throned, and the wheel of the world roll under him, Judge he between me and all of you, and see If I transgress at all: but ye, refrain Transgressing hands and reinless mouths, and keep Silence, lest by much foam of violent words And proper poison of your lips ye die. ŒNEUS O flower of Tegea, maiden, fleetest foot And holiest head of women, have good cheer Of thy good words: but ye, depart with her In peace and reverence, each with blameless eye Following his fate; exalt your hands and hearts, Strike, cease not, arrow on arrow and wound on wound, And go with gods and with the gods return. CHORUS Who hath given man speech? or who hath set therein A thorn for peril and a snare for sin? For in the word his life is and his breath, And in the word his death, That madness and the infatuate heart may breed From the word's womb the deed And life bring one thing forth ere all pass by, Even one thing which is ours yet cannot die— Death. Hast thou seen him ever anywhere, Time's twin-born brother, imperishable as he Is perishable and plaintive, clothed with care And mutable as sand, But death is strong and full of blood and fair And perdurable and like a lord of land? Nay, time thou seest not, death thou wilt not see Till life's right hand be loosened from thine hand And thy life-days from thee. For the gods very subtly fashion Madness with sadness upon earth: Not knowing in any wise compassion, Nor holding pity of any worth; And many things they have given and taken, And wrought and ruined many things; The firm land have they loosed and shaken, And sealed the sea with all her springs; They have wearied time with heavy burdens And vexed the lips of life with breath: Set men to labour and given them guerdons, Death, and great darkness after death: Put moans into the bridal measure And on the bridal wools a stain; And circled pain about with pleasure, And girdled pleasure about with pain; And strewed one marriage-bed with tears and fire For extreme loathing and supreme desire. What shall be done with all these tears of ours? Shall they make watersprings in the fair heaven To bathe the brows of morning? or like flowers Be shed and shine before the starriest hours, Or made the raiment of the weeping Seven? Or rather, O our masters, shall they be Food for the famine of the grievous sea, A great well-head of lamentation Satiating the sad gods? or fall and flow Among the years and seasons to and fro, And wash their feet with tribulation And fill them full with grieving ere they go? Alas, our lords, and yet alas again, Seeing all your iron heaven is gilt as gold But all we smite thereat in vain; Smite the gates barred with groanings manifold, But all the floors are paven with our pain. Yea, and with weariness of lips and eyes, With breaking of the bosom, and with sighs, We labour, and are clad and fed with grief And filled with days we would not fain behold And nights we would not hear of; we wax old, All we wax old and wither like a leaf. We are outcast, strayed between bright sun and moon; Our light and darkness are as leaves of flowers, Black flowers and white, that perish; and the noon As midnight, and the night as daylight hours. A little fruit a little while is ours, And the worm finds it soon. But up in heaven the high gods one by one Lay hands upon the draught that quickeneth, Fulfilled with all tears shed and all things done, And stir with soft imperishable breath The bubbling bitterness of life and death, And hold it to our lips and laugh; but they Preserve their lips from tasting night or day, Lest they too change and sleep, the fates that spun, The lips that made us and the hands that slay; Lest all these change, and heaven bow down to none, Change and be subject to the secular sway And terrene revolution of the sun. Therefore they thrust it from them, putting time away. I would the wine of time, made sharp and sweet With multitudinous days and nights and tears And many mixing savours of strange years, Were no more trodden of them under feet, Cast out and spilt about their holy places: That life were given them as a fruit to eat And death to drink as water; that the light Might ebb, drawn backward from their eyes, and night Hide for one hour the imperishable faces. That they might rise up sad in heaven, and know Sorrow and sleep, one paler than young snow, One cold as blight of dew and ruinous rain; Rise up and rest and suffer a little, and be Awhile as all things born with us and we, And grieve as men, and like slain men be slain. For now we know not of them; but one saith The gods are gracious, praising God; and one, When hast thou seen? or hast thou felt his breath Touch, nor consume thine eyelids as the sun, Nor fill thee to the lips with fiery death? None hath beheld him, none Seen above other gods and shapes of things, Swift without feet and flying without wings, Intolerable, not clad with death or life, Insatiable, not known of night or day, The lord of love and loathing and of strife Who gives a star and takes a sun away; Who shapes the soul, and makes her a barren wife To the earthly body and grievous growth of clay; Who turns the large limbs to a little flame And binds the great sea with a little sand; Who makes desire, and slays desire with shame; Who shakes the heaven as ashes in his hand; Who, seeing the light and shadow for the same, Bids day waste night as fire devours a brand, Smites without sword, and scourges without rod; The supreme evil, God. Yea, with thine hate, O God, thou hast covered us, One saith, and hidden our eyes away from sight, And made us transitory and hazardous, Light things and slight; Yet have men praised thee, saying, He hath made man thus, And he doeth right. Thou hast kissed us, and hast smitten; thou hast laid Upon us with thy left hand life, and said, Live: and again thou hast said, Yield up your breath, And with thy right hand laid upon us death. Thou hast sent us sleep, and stricken sleep with dreams, Saying, Joy is not, but love of joy shall be; Thou hast made sweet springs for all the pleasant streams, In the end thou hast made them bitter with the sea. Thou hast fed one rose with dust of many men; Thou hast marred one face with fire of many tears; Thou hast taken love, and given us sorrow again; With pain thou hast filled us full to the eyes and ears. Therefore because thou art strong, our father, and we Feeble; and thou art against us, and thine hand Constrains us in the shallows of the sea And breaks us at the limits of the land; Because thou hast bent thy lightnings as a bow, And loosed the hours like arrows; and let fall Sins and wild words and many a wingèd woe And wars among us, and one end of all; Because thou hast made the thunder, and thy feet Are as a rushing water when the skies Break, but thy face as an exceeding heat And flames of fire the eyelids of thine eyes; Because thou art over all who are over us; Because thy name is life and our name death; Because thou art cruel and men are piteous, And our hands labour and thine hand scattereth; Lo, with hearts rent and knees made tremulous, Lo, with ephemeral lips and casual breath, At least we witness of thee ere we die That these things are not otherwise, but thus; That each man in his heart sigheth, and saith, That all men even as I, All we are against thee, against thee, O God most high. But ye, keep ye on earth Your lips from over-speech, Loud words and longing are so little worth; And the end is hard to reach. For silence after grievous things is good, And reverence, and the fear that makes men whole, And shame, and righteous governance of blood, And lordship of the soul. But from sharp words and wits men pluck no fruit, And gathering thorns they shake the tree at root; For words divide and rend; But silence is most noble till the end. ALTHÆA I heard within the house a cry of news And came forth eastward hither, where the dawn Cheers first these warder gods that face the sun And next our eyes unrisen; for unaware Came clashes of swift hoofs and trampling feet And through the windy pillared corridor Light sharper than the frequent flames of day That daily fill it from the fiery dawn; Gleams, and a thunder of people that cried out, And dust and hurrying horsemen; lo their chief, That rode with Œneus rein by rein, returned. What cheer, O herald of my lord the king? HERALD Lady, good cheer and great; the boar is slain. CHORUS Praised be all gods that look toward Calydon. ALTHÆA Good news and brief; but by whose happier hand? HERALD A maiden's and a prophet's and thy son's. ALTHÆA Well fare the spear that severed him and life. HERALD Thine own, and not an alien, hast thou blest. ALTHÆA Twice be thou too for my sake blest and his. HERALD At the king's word I rode afoam for thine. ALTHÆA Thou sayest he tarrieth till they bring the spoil? HERALD Hard by the quarry, where they breathe, O queen. ALTHÆA Speak thou their chance; but some bring flowers and crown These gods and all the lintel, and shed wine, Fetch sacrifice and slay; for heaven is good. HERALD Some furlongs northward where the brakes begin West of that narrowing range of warrior hills Whose brooks have bled with battle when thy son Smote Acarnania, there all they made halt, And with keen eye took note of spear and hound, Royally ranked; Laertes island-born, The young Gerenian Nestor, Panopeus, And Cepheus and Ancæus, mightiest thewed, Arcadians; next, and evil-eyed of these, Arcadian Atalanta, with twain hounds Lengthening the leash, and under nose and brow Glittering with lipless tooth and fire-swift eye; But from her white braced shoulder the plumed shafts Rang, and the bow shone from her side; next her Meleager, like a sun in spring that strikes Branch into leaf and bloom into the world, A glory among men meaner; Iphicles, And following him that slew the biform bull Pirithous, and divine Eurytion, And, bride-bound to the gods, Æacides. Then Telamon his brother, and Argive-born The seer and sayer of visions and of truth, Amphiaraus; and a four-fold strength, Thine, even thy mother's and thy sister's sons. And recent from the roar of foreign foam Jason, and Dryas twin-begot with war, A blossom of bright battle, sword and man Shining; and Idas, and the keenest eye Of Lynceus, and Admetus twice-espoused, And Hippasus and Hyleus, great in heart. These having halted bade blow horns, and rode Through woods and waste lands cleft by stormy streams, Past yew-trees and the heavy hair of pines, And where the dew is thickest under oaks, This way and that; but questing up and down They saw no trail nor scented; and one said, Plexippus, Help, or help not, Artemis, And we will flay thy boarskin with male hands; But saying, he ceased and said not that he would, Seeing where the green ooze of a sun-struck marsh Shook with a thousand reeds untunable, And in their moist and multitudinous flower Slept no soft sleep, with violent visions fed, The blind bulk of the immeasurable beast. And seeing, he shuddered with sharp lust of praise Through all his limbs, and launched a double dart. And missed; for much desire divided him, Too hot of spirit and feebler than his will, That his hand failed, though fervent; and the shaft, Sundering the rushes, in a tamarisk stem Shook, and stuck fast; then all abode save one, The Arcadian Atalanta; from her side Sprang her hounds, labouring at the leash, and slipped, And plashed ear-deep with plunging feet; but she Saying, Speed it as I send it for thy sake, Goddess, drew bow and loosed; the sudden string Rang, and sprang inward, and the waterish air Hissed, and the moist plumes of the songless reeds Moved as a wave which the wind moves no more. But the boar heaved half out of ooze and slime His tense flank trembling round the barbèd wound, Hateful; and fiery with invasive eyes And bristling with intolerable hair Plunged, and the hounds clung, and green flowers and white Reddened and broke all round them where they came. And charging with sheer tusk he drove, and smote Hyleus; and sharp death caught his sudden soul, And violent sleep shed night upon his eyes. Then Peleus, with strong strain of hand and heart, Shot; but the sidelong arrow slid, and slew His comrade born and loving countryman, Under the left arm smitten, as he no less Poised a like arrow; and bright blood brake afoam, And falling, and weighed back by clamorous arms, Sharp rang the dead limbs of Eurytion. Then one shot happier, the Cadmean seer, Amphiaraus; for his sacred shaft Pierced the red circlet of one ravening eye Beneath the brute brows of the sanguine boar, Now bloodier from one slain; but he so galled Sprang straight, and rearing cried no lesser cry Than thunder and the roar of wintering streams That mix their own foam with the yellower sea; And as a tower that falls by fire in fight With ruin of walls and all its archery, And breaks the iron flower of war beneath, Crushing charred limbs and molten arms of men; So through crushed branches and the reddening brake Clamoured and crashed the fervour of his feet, And trampled, springing sideways from the tusk, Too tardy a moving mould of heavy strength, Ancæus; and as flakes of weak-winged snow Break, all the hard thews of his heaving limbs Broke, and rent flesh fell every way, and blood Flew, and fierce fragments of no more a man. Then all the heroes drew sharp breath, and gazed, And smote not; but Meleager, but thy son, Right in the wild way of the coming curse Rock-rooted, fair with fierce and fastened lips, Clear eyes, and springing muscle and shortening limb— With chin aslant indrawn to a tightening throat, Grave, and with gathered sinews, like a god,— Aimed on the left side his well-handled spear Grasped where the ash was knottiest hewn, and smote, And with no missile wound, the monstrous boar Right in the hairiest hollow of his hide Under the last rib, sheer through bulk and bone, Deep in; and deeply smitten, and to death, The heavy horror with his hanging shafts Leapt, and fell furiously, and from raging lips Foamed out the latest wrath of all his life. And all they praised the gods with mightier heart, Zeus and all gods, but chiefliest Artemis, Seeing; but Meleager bade whet knives and flay, Strip and stretch out the splendour of the spoil; And hot and horrid from the work all these Sat, and drew breath and drank and made great cheer And washed the hard sweat off their calmer brows. For much sweet grass grew higher than grew the reed, And good for slumber, and every holier herb, Narcissus, and the low-lying melilote, And all of goodliest blade and bloom that springs Where, hid by heavier hyacinth, violet buds Blossom and burn; and fire of yellower flowers And light of crescent lilies, and such leaves As fear the Faun's and know the Dryad's foot; Olive and ivy and poplar dedicate, And many a well-spring overwatched of these. There now they rest; but me the king bade bear Good tidings to rejoice this town and thee. Wherefore be glad, and all ye give much thanks, For fallen is all the trouble of Calydon. ALTHÆA Laud ye the gods; for this they have given is good, And what shall be they hide until their time. Much good and somewhat grievous hast thou said, And either well; but let all sad things be, Till all have made before the prosperous gods Burnt-offering, and poured out the floral wine. Look fair, O gods, and favourable; for we Praise you with no false heart or flattering mouth, Being merciful, but with pure souls and prayer. HERALD Thou hast prayed well; for whoso fears not these, But once being prosperous waxes huge of heart, Him shall some new thing unaware destroy. CHORUS O that I now, I too were By deep wells and water-floods, Streams of ancient hills, and where All the wan green places bear Blossoms cleaving to the sod, Fruitless fruit, and grasses fair, Or such darkest ivy-buds As divide thy yellow hair, Bacchus, and their leaves that nod Round thy fawnskin brush the bare Snow-soft shoulders of a god; There the year is sweet, and there Earth is full of secret springs, And the fervent rose-cheeked hours, Those that marry dawn and noon, There are sunless, there look pale In dim leaves and hidden air, Pale as grass or latter flowers Or the wild vine's wan wet rings Full of dew beneath the moon, And all day the nightingale Sleeps, and all night sings; There in cold remote recesses That nor alien eyes assail, Feet, nor imminence of wings, Nor a wind nor any tune, Thou, O queen and holiest, Flower the whitest of all things, With reluctant lengthening tresses And with sudden splendid breast Save of maidens unbeholden, There art wont to enter, there Thy divine swift limbs and golden Maiden growth of unbound hair, Bathed in waters white, Shine, and many a maid's by thee In moist woodland or the hilly Flowerless brakes where wells abound Out of all men's sight; Or in lower pools that see All their marges clothed all round With the innumerable lily, Whence the golden-girdled bee Flits through flowering rush to fret White or duskier violet, Fair as those that in far years With their buds left luminous And their little leaves made wet, From the warmer dew of tears, Mother's tears in extreme need, Hid the limbs of Iamus, Of thy brother's seed; For his heart was piteous Toward him, even as thine heart now Pitiful toward us; Thine, O goddess, turning hither A benignant blameless brow; Seeing enough of evil done And lives withered as leaves wither In the blasting of the sun; Seeing enough of hunters dead, Ruin enough of all our year, Herds and harvests slain and shed, Herdsmen stricken many an one, Fruits and flocks consumed together, And great length of deadly days. Yet with reverent lips and fear Turn we toward thee, turn and praise For this lightening of clear weather And prosperities begun. For not seldom, when all air As bright water without breath Shines, and when men fear not, fate Without thunder unaware Breaks, and brings down death. Joy with grief ye great gods give, Good with bad, and overbear All the pride of us that live, All the high estate, As ye long since overbore, As in old time long before, Many a strong man and a great, All that were. But do thou, sweet, otherwise, Having heed of all our prayer, Taking note of all our sighs; We beseech thee by thy light, By thy bow, and thy sweet eyes, And the kingdom of the night, Be thou favourable and fair; By thine arrows and thy might And Orion overthrown; By the maiden thy delight, By the indissoluble zone And the sacred hair. MESSENGER Maidens, if ye will sing now, shift your song, Bow down, cry, wail for pity; is this a time For singing? nay, for strewing of dust and ash, Rent raiment, and for bruising of the breast. CHORUS What new thing wolf-like lurks behind thy words? What snake's tongue in thy lips? what fire in the eyes? MESSENGER Bring me before the queen and I will speak. CHORUS Lo, she comes forth as from thank-offering made. MESSENGER A barren offering for a bitter gift. ALTHÆA What are these borne on branches, and the face Covered? no mean men living, but now slain Such honour have they, if any dwell with death. MESSENGER Queen, thy twain brethren and thy mother's sons. ALTHÆA Lay down your dead till I behold their blood If it be mine indeed, and I will weep. MESSENGER Weep if thou wilt, for these men shall no more. ALTHÆA O brethren, O my father's sons, of me Well loved and well reputed, I should weep Tears dearer than the dear blood drawn from you But that I know you not uncomforted, Sleeping no shameful sleep, however slain, For my son surely hath avenged you dead. MESSENGER Nay, should thine own seed slay himself, O queen? ALTHÆA Thy double word brings forth a double death. MESSENGER Know this then singly, by one hand they fell. ALTHÆA What mutterest thou with thine ambiguous mouth? MESSENGER Slain by thy son's hand; is that saying so hard? ALTHÆA Our time is come upon us: it is here. CHORUS O miserable, and spoiled at thine own hand. ALTHÆA Wert thou not called Meleager from this womb? CHORUS A grievous huntsman hath it bred to thee. ALTHÆA Wert thou born fire, and shalt thou not devour? CHORUS The fire thou madest, will it consume even thee? ALTHÆA My dreams are fallen upon me; burn thou too. CHORUS Not without God are visions born and die. ALTHÆA The gods are many about me; I am one. CHORUS She groans as men wrestling with heavier gods. ALTHÆA They rend me, they divide me, they destroy. CHORUS Or one labouring in travail of strange births. ALTHÆA They are strong, they are strong; I am broken, and these prevail. CHORUS The god is great against her; she will die. ALTHÆA Yea, but not now; for my heart too is great. I would I were not here in sight of the sun. But thou, speak all thou sawest, and I will die. MESSENGER O queen, for queenlike hast thou borne thyself, A little word may hold so great mischance. For in division of the sanguine spoil These men thy brethren wrangling bade yield up The boar's head and the horror of the hide That this might stand a wonder in Calydon, Hallowed; and some drew toward them; but thy son With great hands grasping all that weight of hair Cast down the dead heap clanging and collapsed At female feet, saying This thy spoil not mine, Maiden, thine own hand for thyself hath reaped, And all this praise God gives thee: she thereat Laughed, as when dawn touches the sacred night The sky sees laugh and redden and divide Dim lips and eyelids virgin of the sun, Hers, and the warm slow breasts of morning heave, Fruitful, and flushed with flame from lamp-lit hours, And maiden undulation of clear hair Colour the clouds; so laughed she from pure heart, Lit with a low blush to the braided hair, And rose-coloured and cold like very dawn, Golden and godlike, chastely with chaste lips, A faint grave laugh; and all they held their peace, And she passed by them. Then one cried Lo now, Shall not the Arcadian shoot out lips at us, Saying all we were despoiled by this one girl? And all they rode against her violently And cast the fresh crown from her hair, and now They had rent her spoil away, dishonouring her, Save that Meleager, as a tame lion chafed, Bore on them, broke them, and as fire cleaves wood So clove and drove them, smitten in twain; but she Smote not nor heaved up hand; and this man first, Plexippus, crying out This for love's sake, sweet, Drove at Meleager, who with spear straightening Pierced his cheek through; then Toxeus made for him, Dumb, but his spear spake; vain and violent words. Fruitless; for him too stricken through both sides The earth felt falling, and his horse's foam Blanched thy son's face, his slayer; and these being slain, None moved nor spake; but Œneus bade bear hence These made of heaven infatuate in their deaths, Foolish; for these would baffle fate, and fell. And they passed on, and all men honoured her, Being honourable, as one revered of heaven. ALTHÆA What say you, women? is all this not well done? CHORUS No man doth well but God hath part in him. ALTHÆA But no part here; for these my brethren born Ye have no part in, these ye know not of As I that was their sister, a sacrifice Slain in their slaying. I would I had died for these; For this man dead walked with me, child by child, And made a weak staff for my feebler feet With his own tender wrist and hand, and held And led me softly and shewed me gold and steel And shining shapes of mirror and bright crown And all things fair; and threw light spears, and brought Young hounds to huddle at my feet and thrust Tame heads against my little maiden breasts And please me with great eyes; and those days went And these are bitter and I a barren queen And sister miserable, a grievous thing And mother of many curses; and she too, My sister Leda, sitting overseas With fair fruits round her, and her faultless lord, Shall curse me, saying A sorrow and not a son, Sister, thou barest, even a burning fire, A brand consuming thine own soul and me. But ye now, sons of Thestius, make good cheer, For ye shall have such wood to funeral fire As no king hath; and flame that once burnt down Oil shall not quicken or breath relume or wine Refresh again; much costlier than fine gold, And more than many lives of wandering men. CHORUS O queen, thou hast yet with thee love-worthy things, Thine husband, and the great strength of thy son. ALTHÆA Who shall get brothers for me while I live? Who bear them? who bring forth in lieu of these? Are not our fathers and our brethren one, And no man like them? are not mine here slain? Have we not hung together, he and I, Flowerwise feeding as the feeding bees, With mother-milk for honey? and this man too, Dead, with my son's spear thrust between his sides, Hath he not seen us, later born than he, Laugh with lips filled, and laughed again for love? There were no sons then in the world, nor spears, Nor deadly births of women; but the gods Allowed us, and our days were clear of these. I would I had died unwedded, and brought forth No swords to vex the world; for these that spake Sweet words long since and loved me will not speak Nor love nor look upon me; and all my life I shall not hear nor see them living men. But I too living, how shall I now live? What life shall this be with my son, to know What hath been and desire what will not be, Look for dead eyes and listen for dead lips, And kill mine own heart with remembering them, And with those eyes that see their slayer alive Weep, and wring hands that clasp him by the hand? How shall I bear my dreams of them, to hear False voices, feel the kisses of false mouths And footless sound of perished feet, and then Wake and hear only it may be their own hounds Whine masterless in miserable sleep, And see their boar-spears and their beds and seats And all the gear and housings of their lives And not the men? shall hounds and horses mourn, Pine with strange eyes, and prick up hungry ears, Famish and fail at heart for their dear lords, And I not heed at all? and those blind things Fall off from life for love's sake, and I live? Surely some death is better than some life, Better one death for him and these and me For if the gods had slain them it may be I had endured it; if they had fallen by war Or by the nets and knives of privy death And by hired hands while sleeping, this thing too I had set my soul to suffer; or this hunt, Had this despatched them under tusk or tooth Torn, sanguine, trodden, broken; for all deaths Or honourable or with facile feet avenged And hands of swift gods following, all save this, Are bearable; but not for their sweet land Fighting, but not a sacrifice, lo these Dead; for I had not then shed all mine heart Out at mine eyes: then either with good speed, Being just, I had slain their slayer atoningly, Or strewn with flowers their fire and on their tombs Hung crowns, and over them a song, and seen Their praise outflame their ashes: for all men, All maidens, had come thither, and from pure lips Shed songs upon them, from heroic eyes Tears; and their death had been a deathless life; But now, by no man hired nor alien sword, By their own kindred are they fallen, in peace, After much peril, friendless among friends, By hateful hands they loved; and how shall mine Touch these returning red and not from war, These fatal from the vintage of men's veins, Dead men my brethren? how shall these wash off No festal stains of undelightful wine, How mix the blood, my blood on them, with me, Holding mine hand? or how shall I say, son, That am no sister? but by night and day Shall we not sit and hate each other, and think Things hate-worthy? not live with shamefast eyes, Brow-beaten, treading soft with fearful feet, Each unupbraided, each without rebuke Convicted, and without a word reviled Each of another? and I shall let thee live And see thee strong and hear men for thy sake Praise me, but these thou wouldest not let live No man shall praise for ever? these shall lie Dead, unbeloved, unholpen, all through thee? Sweet were they toward me living, and mine heart Desired them, but was then well satisfied, That now is as men hungered; and these dead I shall want always to the day I die. For all things else and all men may renew; Yea, son for son the gods may give and take, But never a brother or sister any more. CHORUS Nay, for the son lies close about thine heart, Full of thy milk, warm from thy womb, and drains Life and the blood of life and all thy fruit, Eats thee and drinks thee as who breaks bread and eats, Treads wine and drinks, thyself, a sect of thee; And if he feed not, shall not thy flesh faint? Or drink not, are not thy lips dead for thirst? This thing moves more than all things, even thy son, That thou cleave to him; and he shall honour thee, Thy womb that bare him and the breasts he knew, Reverencing most for thy sake all his gods. ALTHÆA But these the gods too gave me, and these my son, Not reverencing his gods nor mine own heart Nor the old sweet years nor all venerable things, But cruel, and in his ravin like a beast, Hath taken away to slay them: yea, and she She the strange woman, she the flower, the sword, Red from spilt blood, a mortal flower to men, Adorable, detestable—even she Saw with strange eyes and with strange lips rejoiced, Seeing these mine own slain of mine own, and me Made miserable above all miseries made, A grief among all women in the world, A name to be washed out with all men's tears. CHORUS Strengthen thy spirit; is this not also a god, Chance, and the wheel of all necessities? Hard things have fallen upon us from harsh gods, Whom lest worse hap rebuke we not for these. ALTHÆA My spirit is strong against itself, and I For these things' sake cry out on mine own soul That it endures outrage, and dolorous days, And life, and this inexpiable impotence. Weak am I, weak and shameful; my breath drawn Shames me, and monstrous things and violent gods. What shall atone? what heal me? what bring back Strength to the foot, light to the face? what herb Assuage me? what restore me? what release? What strange thing eaten or drunken, O great gods, Make me as you or as the beasts that feed, Slay and divide and cherish their own hearts? For these ye show us; and we less than these Have not wherewith to live as all these things Which all their lives fare after their own kind As who doth well rejoicing; but we ill, Weeping or laughing, we whom eyesight fails, Knowledge and light of face and perfect heart, And hands we lack, and wit; and all our days Sin, and have hunger, and die infatuated. For madness have ye given us and not health, And sins whereof we know not; and for these Death, and sudden destruction unaware. What shall we say now? what thing comes of us? CHORUS Alas, for all this all men undergo. ALTHÆA Wherefore I will not that these twain, O gods, Die as a dog dies, eaten of creeping things, Abominable, a loathing; but though dead Shall they have honour and such funereal flame As strews men's ashes in their enemies' face And blinds their eyes who hate them: lest men say, “Lo how they lie, and living had great kin, And none of these hath pity of them, and none Regards them lying, and none is wrung at heart, None moved in spirit for them, naked and slain, Abhorred, abased, and no tears comfort them:” And in the dark this grieve Eurythemis, Hearing how these her sons come down to her Unburied, unavenged, as kinless men, And had a queen their sister. That were shame Worse than this grief. Yet how to atone at all I know not; seeing the love of my born son, A new-made mother's new-born love, that grows From the soft child to the strong man, now soft Now strong as either, and still one sole same love, Strives with me, no light thing to strive withal; This love is deep, and natural to man's blood, And ineffaceable with many tears. Yet shall not these rebuke me though I die, Nor she in that waste world with all her dead, My mother, among the pale flocks fallen as leaves, Folds of dead people, and alien from the sun; Nor lack some bitter comfort, some poor praise, Being queen, to have borne her daughter like a queen, Righteous; and though mine own fire burn me too, She shall have honour and these her sons, though dead. But all the gods will, all they do, and we Not all we would, yet somewhat; and one choice We have, to live and do just deeds and die. CHORUS Terrible words she communes with, and turns Swift fiery eyes in doubt against herself, And murmurs as who talks in dreams with death. ALTHÆA For the unjust also dieth, and him all men Hate, and himself abhors the unrighteousness, And seeth his own dishonour intolerable. But I being just, doing right upon myself, Slay mine own soul, and no man born shames me. For none constrains nor shall rebuke, being done, What none compelled me doing; thus these things fare. Ah, ah, that such things should so fare; ah me, That I am found to do them and endure, Chosen and constrained to choose, and bear myself Mine own wound through mine own flesh to the heart Violently stricken, a spoiler and a spoil, A ruin ruinous, fallen on mine own son. Ah, ah, for me too as for these; alas, For that is done that shall be, and mine hand Full of the deed, and full of blood mine eyes, That shall see never nor touch anything Save blood unstanched and fire unquenchable. CHORUS What wilt thou do? what ails thee? for the house Shakes ruinously; wilt thou bring fire for it? ALTHÆA Fire in the roofs, and on the lintels fire. Lo ye, who stand and weave, between the doors, There; and blood drips from hand and thread, and stains Threshold and raiment and me passing in Flecked with the sudden sanguine drops of death. CHORUS Alas that time is stronger than strong men, Fate than all gods: and these are fallen on us. ALTHÆA A little since and I was glad; and now I never shall be glad or sad again. CHORUS Between two joys a grief grows unaware. ALTHÆA A little while and I shall laugh; and then I shall weep never and laugh not any more. CHORUS What shall be said? for words are thorns to grief. Withhold thyself a little and fear the gods. ALTHÆA Fear died when these were slain; and I am as dead, And fear is of the living; these fear none. CHORUS Have pity upon all people for their sake. ALTHÆA It is done now; shall I put back my day? CHORUS An end is come, an end; this is of God. ALTHÆA I am fire, and burn myself; keep clear of fire. CHORUS The house is broken, is broken; it shall not stand. ALTHÆA Woe, woe for him that breaketh; and a rod Smote it of old, and now the axe is here. CHORUS Not as with sundering of the earth Nor as with cleaving of the sea Nor fierce foreshadowings of a birth Nor flying dreams of death to be Nor loosening of the large world's girth And quickening of the body of night, And sound of thunder in men's ears And fire of lightning in men's sight, Fate, mother of desires and fears, Bore unto men the law of tears; But sudden, an unfathered flame, And broken out of night, she shone, She, without body, without name, In days forgotten and foregone; And heaven rang round her as she came Like smitten cymbals, and lay bare; Clouds and great stars, thunders and snows, The blue sad fields and folds of air, The life that breathes, the life that grows, All wind, all fire, that burns or blows, Even all these knew her: for she is great; The daughter of doom, the mother of death, The sister of sorrow; a lifelong weight That no man's finger lighteneth, Nor any god can lighten fate; A landmark seen across the way Where one race treads as the other trod; An evil sceptre, an evil stay, Wrought for a staff, wrought for a rod, The bitter jealousy of God. For death is deep as the sea, And fate as the waves thereof. Shall the waves take pity on thee Or the southwind offer thee love? Wilt thou take the night for thy day Or the darkness for light on thy way, Till thou say in thine heart Enough? Behold, thou art over fair, thou art over wise; The sweetness of spring in thine hair, and the light in thine eyes. The light of the spring in thine eyes, and the sound in thine ears; Yet thine heart shall wax heavy with sighs and thine eyelids with tears. Wilt thou cover thine hair with gold, and with silver thy feet? Hast thou taken the purple to fold thee, and made thy mouth sweet? Behold, when thy face is made bare, he that loved thee shall hate; Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate. For thy life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain; And the veil of thine head shall be grief; and the crown shall be pain. ALTHÆA Ho, ye that wail, and ye that sing, make way Till I be come among you. Hide your tears, Ye little weepers, and your laughing lips, Ye laughers for a little; lo mine eyes That outweep heaven at rainiest, and my mouth That laughs as gods laugh at us. Fate's are we, Yet fate is ours a breathing-space; yea, mine, Fate is made mine for ever; he is my son, My bedfellow, my brother. You strong gods, Give place unto me; I am as any of you, To give life and to take life. Thou, old earth, That hast made man and unmade; thou whose mouth Looks red from the eaten fruits of thine own womb; Behold me with what lips upon what food I feed and fill my body; even with flesh Made of my body. Lo, the fire I lit I burn with fire to quench it; yea, with flame I burn up even the dust and ash thereof. CHORUS Woman, what fire is this thou burnest with? ALTHÆA Yea to the bone, yea to the blood and all. CHORUS For this thy face and hair are as one fire. ALTHÆA A tongue that licks and beats upon the dust. CHORUS And in thine eyes are hollow light and heat. ALTHÆA Of flame not fed with hand or frankincense. CHORUS I fear thee for the trembling of thine eyes. ALTHÆA Neither with love they tremble nor for fear. CHORUS And thy mouth shuddering like a shot bird. ALTHÆA Not as the bride's mouth when man kisses it. CHORUS Nay, but what thing is this thing thou hast done? ALTHÆA Look, I am silent, speak your eyes for me. CHORUS I see a faint fire lightening from the hall. ALTHÆA Gaze, stretch your eyes, strain till the lids drop off. CHORUS Flushed pillars down the flickering vestibule. ALTHÆA Stretch with your necks like birds: cry, chirp as they. CHORUS And a long brand that blackens: and white dust. ALTHÆA O children, what is this ye see? your eyes Are blinder than night's face at fall of moon. That is my son, my flesh, my fruit of life, My travail, and the year's weight of my womb, Meleager, a fire enkindled of mine hands And of mine hands extinguished; this is he. CHORUS O gods, what word has flown out at thy mouth? ALTHÆA I did this and I say this and I die. CHORUS Death stands upon the doorway of thy lips, And in thy mouth has death set up his house. ALTHÆA O death, a little, a little while, sweet death, Until I see the brand burnt down and die. CHORUS She reels as any reed under the wind, And cleaves unto the ground with staggering feet. ALTHÆA Girls, one thing will I say and hold my peace. I that did this will weep not nor cry out, Cry ye and weep: I will not call on gods, Call ye on them; I will not pity man, Shew ye your pity. I know not if I live; Save that I feel the fire upon my face And on my cheek the burning of a brand. Yea the smoke bites me, yea I drink the steam With nostril and with eyelid and with lip Insatiate and intolerant; and mine hands Burn, and fire feeds upon mine eyes; I reel As one made drunk with living, whence he draws Drunken delight; yet I, though mad for joy, Loathe my long living and am waxen red As with the shadow of shed blood; behold, I am kindled with the flames that fade in him, I am swollen with subsiding of his veins, I am flooded with his ebbing; my lit eyes Flame with the falling fire that leaves his lids Bloodless; my cheek is luminous with blood Because his face is ashen. Yet, O child, Son, first-born, fairest—O sweet mouth, sweet eyes, That drew my life out through my suckling breast, That shone and clove mine heart through—O soft knees Clinging, O tender treadings of soft feet, Cheeks warm with little kissings—O child, child, What have we made each other? Lo, I felt Thy weight cleave to me, a burden of beauty, O son, Thy cradled brows and loveliest loving lips, The floral hair, the little lightening eyes, And all thy goodly glory; with mine hands Delicately I fed thee, with my tongue Tenderly spake, saying, Verily in God's time, For all the little likeness of thy limbs, Son, I shall make thee a kingly man to fight, A lordly leader; and hear before I die, “She bore the goodliest sword of all the world.” Oh! oh! For all my life turns round on me; I am severed from myself, my name is gone, My name that was a healing, it is changed, My name is a consuming. From this time, Though mine eyes reach to the end of all these things, My lips shall not unfasten till I die. SEMICHORUS She has filled with sighing the city, And the ways thereof with tears; She arose, she girdled her sides, She set her face as a bride's; She wept, and she had no pity; Trembled, and felt no fears. SEMICHORUS Her eyes were clear as the sun, Her brows were fresh as the day; She girdled herself with gold, Her robes were manifold; But the days of her worship are done, Her praise is taken away. SEMICHORUS For she set her hand to the fire, With her mouth she kindled the same; As the mouth of a flute-player, So was the mouth of her; With the might of her strong desire She blew the breath of the flame. SEMICHORUS She set her hand to the wood, She took the fire in her hand; As one who is nigh to death, She panted with strange breath; She opened her lips unto blood, She breathed and kindled the brand. SEMICHORUS As a wood-dove newly shot, She sobbed and lifted her breast; She sighed and covered her eyes, Filling her lips with sighs; She sighed, she withdrew herself not, She refrained not, taking not rest; SEMICHORUS But as the wind which is drouth, And as the air which is death, As storm that severeth ships, Her breath severing her lips, The breath came forth of her mouth And the fire came forth of her breath. SECOND MESSENGER Queen, and you maidens, there is come on us A thing more deadly than the face of death; Meleager the good lord is as one slain. SEMICHORUS Without sword, without sword is he stricken; Slain, and slain without hand. SECOND MESSENGER For as keen ice divided of the sun His limbs divide, and as thawed snow the flesh Thaws from off all his body to the hair. SEMICHORUS He wastes as the embers quicken; With the brand he fades as a brand. SECOND MESSENGER Even while they sang and all drew hither and he Lifted both hands to crown the Arcadian's hair And fix the looser leaves, both hands fell down. SEMICHORUS With rending of cheek and of hair Lament ye, mourn for him, weep. SECOND MESSENGER Straightway the crown slid off and smote on earth, First fallen; and he, grasping his own hair, groaned And cast his raiment round his face and fell. SEMICHORUS Alas for visions that were, And soothsayings spoken in sleep. SECOND MESSENGER But the king twitched his reins in and leapt down And caught him, crying out twice “O child” and thrice, So that men's eyelids thickened with their tears. SEMICHORUS Lament with a long lamentation, Cry, for an end is at hand. SECOND MESSENGER O son, he said, son, lift thine eyes, draw breath, Pity me; but Meleager with sharp lips Gasped, and his face waxed like as sunburnt grass. SEMICHORUS Cry aloud, O thou kingdom, O nation, O stricken, a ruinous land. SECOND MESSENGER Whereat king Œneus, straightening feeble knees, With feeble hands heaved up a lessening weight, And laid him sadly in strange hands, and wept. SEMICHORUS Thou art smitten, her lord, her desire, Thy dear blood wasted as rain. SECOND MESSENGER And they with tears and rendings of the beard Bear hither a breathing body, wept upon And lightening at each footfall, sick to death. SEMICHORUS Thou madest thy sword as a fire, With fire for a sword thou art slain. SECOND MESSENGER And lo, the feast turned funeral, and the crowns Fallen; and the huntress and the hunter trapped; And weeping and changed faces and veiled hair. MELEAGER Let your hands meet Round the weight of my head; Lift ye my feet As the feet of the dead; For the flesh of my body is molten, the limbs of it molten as lead. CHORUS O thy luminous face, Thine imperious eyes! O the grief, O the grace, As of day when it dies! Who is this bending over thee, lord, with tears and suppression of sighs? MELEAGER Is a bride so fair? Is a maid so meek? With unchapleted hair, With unfilleted cheek, Atalanta, the pure among women, whose name is as blessing to speak. ATALANTA I would that with feet Unsandalled, unshod, Overbold, overfleet, I had swum not nor trod From Arcadia to Calydon northward, a blast of the envy of God. MELEAGER Unto each man his fate; Unto each as he saith In whose fingers the weight Of the world is as breath; Yet I would that in clamour of battle mine hands had laid hold upon death. CHORUS Not with cleaving of shields And their clash in thine ear, When the lord of fought fields Breaketh spearshaft from spear, Thou art broken, our lord, thou art broken, with travail and labour and fear. MELEAGER Would God he had found me Beneath fresh boughs! Would God he had bound me Unawares in mine house, With light in mine eyes, and songs in my lips, and a crown on my brows! CHORUS Whence art thou sent from us? Whither thy goal? How art thou rent from us, Thou that wert whole, As with severing of eyelids and eyes, as with sundering of body and soul! MELEAGER My heart is within me As an ash in the fire; Whosoever hath seen me, Without lute, without lyre, Shall sing of me grievous things, even things that were ill to desire. CHORUS Who shall raise thee From the house of the dead? Or what man praise thee That thy praise may be said? Alas thy beauty! alas thy body! alas thine head! MELEAGER But thou, O mother, The dreamer of dreams, Wilt thou bring forth another To feel the sun's beams When I move among shadows a shadow, and wail by impassable streams? ŒNEUS What thing wilt thou leave me Now this thing is done? A man wilt thou give me, A son for my son, For the light of mine eyes, the desire of my life, the desirable one? CHORUS Thou wert glad above others, Yea, fair beyond word; Thou wert glad among mothers; For each man that heard Of thee, praise there was added unto thee, as wings to the feet of a bird. ŒNEUS Who shall give back Thy face of old years With travail made black, Grown grey among fears, Mother of sorrow, mother of cursing, mother of tears? MELEAGER Though thou art as fire Fed with fuel in vain, My delight, my desire, Is more chaste than the rain, More pure than the dewfall, more holy than stars are that live without stain. ATALANTA I would that as water My life's blood had thawn, Or as winter's wan daughter Leaves lowland and lawn Spring-stricken, or ever mine eyes had beheld thee made dark in thy dawn. CHORUS When thou dravest the men Of the chosen of Thrace, None turned him again Nor endured he thy face Clothed round with the blush of the battle, with light from a terrible place. ŒNEUS Thou shouldst die as he dies For whom none sheddeth tears; Filling thine eyes And fulfilling thine ears With the brilliance of battle, the bloom and the beauty, the splendour of spears. CHORUS In the ears of the world It is sung, it is told, And the light thereof hurled And the noise thereof rolled From the Acroceraunian snow to the ford of the fleece of gold. MELEAGER Would God ye could carry me Forth of all these; Heap sand and bury me By the Chersonese Where the thundering Bosphorus answers the thunder of Pontic seas. ŒNEUS Dost thou mock at our praise And the singing begun And the men of strange days Praising my son In the folds of the hills of home, high places of Calydon? MELEAGER For the dead man no home is; Ah, better to be What the flower of the foam is In fields of the sea, That the sea-waves might be as my raiment, the gulf-stream a garment for me. CHORUS Who shall seek thee and bring And restore thee thy day, When the dove dipt her wing And the oars won their way Where the narrowing Symplegades whitened the straits of Propontis with spray? MELEAGER Will ye crown me my tomb Or exalt me my name, Now my spirits consume, Now my flesh is a flame? Let the sea slake it once, and men speak of me sleeping to praise me or shame. CHORUS Turn back now, turn thee, As who turns him to wake; Though the life in thee burn thee, Couldst thou bathe it and slake Where the sea-ridge of Helle hangs heavier, and east upon west waters break? MELEAGER Would the winds blow me back Or the waves hurl me home? Ah, to touch in the track Where the pine learnt to roam Cold girdles and crowns of the sea-gods, cool blossoms of water and foam! CHORUS The gods may release That they made fast; Thy soul shall have ease In thy limbs at the last; But what shall they give thee for life, sweet life that is overpast? MELEAGER Not the life of men's veins, Not of flesh that conceives; But the grace that remains, The fair beauty that cleaves To the life of the rains in the grasses, the life of the dews on the leaves. CHORUS Thou wert helmsman and chief; Wilt thou turn in an hour, Thy limbs to the leaf, Thy face to the flower, Thy blood to the water, thy soul to the gods who divide and devour? MELEAGER The years are hungry, They wail all their days; The gods wax angry And weary of praise; And who shall bridle their lips? and who shall straiten their ways? CHORUS The gods guard over us With sword and with rod; Weaving shadow to cover us, Heaping the sod, That law may fulfil herself wholly, to darken man's face before God. MELEAGER O holy head of Œneus, lo thy son Guiltless, yet red from alien guilt, yet foul With kinship of contaminated lives, Lo, for their blood I die; and mine own blood For bloodshedding of mine is mixed therewith, That death may not discern me from my kin. Yet with clean heart I die and faultless hand, Not shamefully; thou therefore of thy love Salute me, and bid fare among the dead Well, as the dead fare; for the best man dead Fares sadly; nathless I now faring well Pass without fear where nothing is to fear Having thy love about me and thy goodwill, O father, among dark places and men dead. ŒNEUS Child, I salute thee with sad heart and tears, And bid thee comfort, being a perfect man In fight, and honourable in the house of peace. The gods give thee fair wage and dues of death, And me brief days and ways to come at thee. MELEAGER Pray thou thy days be long before thy death, And full of ease and kingdom; seeing in death There is no comfort and none aftergrowth, Nor shall one thence look up and see day's dawn Nor light upon the land whither I go. Live thou and take thy fill of days and die When thy day comes; and make not much of death Lest ere thy day thou reap an evil thing. Thou too, the bitter mother and mother-plague Of this my weary body—thou too, queen, The source and end, the sower and the scythe, The rain that ripens and the drought that slays, The sand that swallows and the spring that feeds, To make me and unmake me—thou, I say, Althæa, since my father's ploughshare, drawn Through fatal seedland of a female field, Furrowed thy body, whence a wheaten ear Strong from the sun and fragrant from the rains I sprang and cleft the closure of thy womb, Mother, I dying with unforgetful tongue Hail thee as holy and worship thee as just Who art unjust and unholy; and with my knees Would worship, but thy fire and subtlety, Dissundering them, devour me; for these limbs Are as light dust and crumblings from mine urn Before the fire has touched them; and my face As a dead leaf or dead foot's mark on snow, And all this body a broken barren tree That was so strong, and all this flower of life Disbranched and desecrated miserably, And minished all that god-like muscle and might And lesser than a man's: for all my veins Fail me, and all mine ashen life burns down. I would thou hadst let me live; but gods averse, But fortune, and the fiery feet of change, And time, these would not, these tread out my life, These and not thou; me too thou hast loved, and I Thee; but this death was mixed with all my life, Mine end with my beginning: and this law, This only, slays me, and not my mother at all. And let no brother or sister grieve too sore, Nor melt their hearts out on me with their tears, Since extreme love and sorrowing overmuch Vex the great gods, and overloving men Slay and are slain for love's sake; and this house Shall bear much better children; why should these Weep? but in patience let them live their lives And mine pass by forgotten: thou alone, Mother, thou sole and only, thou not these, Keep me in mind a little when I die Because I was thy first-born; let thy soul Pity me, pity even me gone hence and dead, Though thou wert wroth, and though thou bear again Much happier sons, and all men later born Exceedingly excel me; yet do thou Forget not, nor think shame; I was thy son. Time was I did not shame thee; and time was I thought to live and make thee honourable With deeds as great as these men's; but they live, These, and I die; and what thing should have been Surely I know not; yet I charge thee, seeing I am dead already, love me not the less, Me, O my mother; I charge thee by these gods, My father's, and that holier breast of thine, By these that see me dying, and that which nursed, Love me not less, thy first-born: though grief come, Grief only, of me, and of all these great joy, And shall come always to thee; for thou knowest, O mother, O breasts that bare me, for ye know, O sweet head of my mother, sacred eyes, Ye know my soul albeit I sinned, ye know Albeit I kneel not neither touch thy knees, But with my lips I kneel, and with my heart I fall about thy feet and worship thee. And ye farewell now, all my friends; and ye, Kinsmen, much younger and glorious more than I, Sons of my mother's sister; and all farewell That were in Colchis with me, and bare down The waves and wars that met us: and though times Change, and though now I be not anything, Forget not me among you, what I did In my good time; for even by all those days, Those days and this, and your own living souls, And by the light and luck of you that live, And by this miserable spoil, and me Dying, I beseech you, let my name not die. But thou, dear, touch me with thy rose-like hands, And fasten up mine eyelids with thy mouth, A bitter kiss; and grasp me with thine arms, Printing with heavy lips my light waste flesh, Made light and thin by heavy-handed fate, And with thine holy maiden eyes drop dew, Drop tears for dew upon me who am dead, Me who have loved thee; seeing without sin done I am gone down to the empty weary house Where no flesh is nor beauty nor swift eyes Nor sound of mouth nor might of hands and feet. But thou, dear, hide my body with thy veil, And with thy raiment cover foot and head, And stretch thyself upon me and touch hands With hands and lips with lips: be pitiful As thou art maiden perfect; let no man Defile me to despise me, saying, This man Died woman-wise, a woman's offering, slain Through female fingers in his woof of life, Dishonourable; for thou hast honoured me. And now for God's sake kiss me once and twice And let me go; for the night gathers me, And in the night shall no man gather fruit. ATALANTA Hail thou: but I with heavy face and feet Turn homeward and am gone out of thine eyes. CHORUS Who shall contend with his lords Or cross them or do them wrong? Who shall bind them as with cords? Who shall tame them as with song? Who shall smite them as with swords? For the hands of their kingdom are strong.

HERALD OF EUMOLPUS. MESSENGER. ATHENIAN HERALD. ATHENA. ERECHTHEUS Mother of life and death and all men's days, Earth, whom I chief of all men born would bless, And call thee with more loving lips than theirs Mother, for of this very body of thine And living blood I have my breath and live, Behold me, even thy son, me crowned of men, Me made thy child by that strong cunning God Who fashions fire and iron, who begat Me for a sword and beacon-fire on thee, Me fosterling of Pallas, in her shade Reared, that I first might pay the nursing debt, Hallowing her fame with flower of third-year feasts, And first bow down the bridled strength of steeds To lose the wild wont of their birth, and bear Clasp of man's knees and steerage of his hand, Or fourfold service of his fire-swift wheels That whirl the four-yoked chariot; me the king Who stand before thee naked now, and cry, O holy and general mother of all men born, But mother most and motherliest of mine, Earth, for I ask thee rather of all the Gods, What have we done? what word mistimed or work Hath winged the wild feet of this timeless curse To fall as fire upon us? Lo, I stand Here on this brow's crown of the city's head That crowns its lovely body, till death's hour Waste it; but now the dew of dawn and birth Is fresh upon it from thy womb, and we Behold it born how beauteous; one day more I see the world's wheel of the circling sun Roll up rejoicing to regard on earth This one thing goodliest, fair as heaven or he, Worth a God's gaze or strife of Gods; but now Would this day's ebb of their spent wave of strife Sweep it to sea, wash it on wreck, and leave A costless thing contemned; and in our stead, Where these walls were and sounding streets of men, Make wide a waste for tongueless water-herds And spoil of ravening fishes; that no more Should men say, Here was Athens. This shalt thou Sustain not, nor thy son endure to see, Nor thou to live and look on; for the womb Bare me not base that bare me miserable, To hear this loud brood of the Thracian foam Break its broad strength of billowy-beating war Here, and upon it as a blast of death Blowing, the keen wrath of a fire-souled king, A strange growth grafted on our natural soil, A root of Thrace in Eleusinian earth Set for no comfort to the kindly land, Son of the sea's lord and our first-born foe, Eumolpus; nothing sweet in ears of thine The music of his making, nor a song Toward hopes of ours auspicious; for the note Rings as for death oracular to thy sons That goes before him on the sea-wind blown Full of this charge laid on me, to put out The brief light kindled of mine own child's life, Or with this helmsman hand that steers the state Run right on the under shoal and ridge of death The populous ship with all its fraughtage gone And sails that were to take the wind of time Rent, and the tackling that should hold out fast In confluent surge of loud calamities Broken, with spars of rudders and lost oars That were to row toward harbour and find rest In some most glorious haven of all the world And else may never near it: such a song The Gods have set his lips on fire withal Who threatens now in all their names to bring Ruin; but none of these, thou knowest, have I Chid with my tongue or cursed at heart for grief, Knowing how the soul runs reinless on sheer death Whose grief or joy takes part against the Gods. And what they will is more than our desire, And their desire is more than what we will. For no man's will and no desire of man's Shall stand as doth a God's will. Yet, O fair Mother, that seest me how I cast no word Against them, plead no reason, crave no cause, Boast me not blameless, nor beweep me wronged, By this fair wreath of towers we have decked thee with, This chaplet that we give thee woven of walls, This girdle of gate and temple and citadel Drawn round beneath thy bosom, and fast linked As to thine heart's root—this dear crown of thine, This present light, this city—be not thou Slow to take heed nor slack to strengthen her, Fare we so short-lived howsoe'er, and pay What price we may to ransom thee thy town, Not me my life; but thou that diest not, thou, Though all our house die for this people's sake, Keep thou for ours thy crown our city, guard And give it life the lovelier that we died. CHORUS. Sun, that hast lightened and loosed by thy might Ocean and Earth from the lordship of night, Quickening with vision his eye that was veiled, Freshening the force in her heart that had failed, That sister fettered and blinded brother Should have sight by thy grace and delight of each other, Behold now and see What profit is given them of thee; What wrath has enkindled with madness of mind Her limbs that were bounden, his face that was blind, To be locked as in wrestle together, and lighten With fire that shall darken thy fire in the sky, Body to body and eye against eye In a war against kind, Till the bloom of her fields and her high hills whiten With the foam of his waves more high. For the sea-marks set to divide of old The kingdoms to Ocean and Earth assigned, The hoar sea-fields from the cornfields' gold, His wine-bright waves from her vineyards' fold, Frail forces we find To bridle the spirit of Gods or bind Till the heat of their hearts wax cold. But the peace that was stablished between them to stand Is rent now in twain by the strength of his hand Who stirs up the storm of his sons overbold To pluck from fight what he lost of right, By council and judgment of Gods that spake And gave great Pallas the strife's fair stake, The lordship and love of the lovely land, The grace of the town that hath on it for crown But a headband to wear Of violets one-hued with her hair: For the vales and the green high places of earth Hold nothing so fair, And the depths of the sea bear no such birth Of the manifold births they bear. Too well, too well was the great stake worth A strife divine for the Gods to judge, A crowned God's triumph, a foiled God's grudge, Though the loser be strong and the victress wise Who played long since for so large a prize, The fruitful immortal anointed adored Dear city of men without master or lord, Fair fortress and fostress of sons born free, Who stand in her sight and in thine, O sun, Slaves of no man, subjects of none; A wonder enthroned on the hills and sea, A maiden crowned with a fourfold glory That none from the pride of her head may rend, Violet and olive-leaf purple and hoary, Song-wreath and story the fairest of fame, Flowers that the winter can blast not or bend; A light upon earth as the sun's own flame, A name as his name, Athens, a praise without end. [Str. 1. A noise is arisen against us of waters, A sound as of battle come up from the sea. Strange hunters are hard on us, hearts without pity; They have staked their nets round the fair young city, That the sons of her strength and her virgin daughters Should find not whither alive to flee. [Ant. 1. And we know not yet of the word unwritten, The doom of the Pythian we have not heard; From the navel of earth and the veiled mid altar We wait for a token with hopes that falter, With fears that hang on our hearts thought-smitten Lest her tongue be kindled with no good word. [Str. 2. O thou not born of the womb, nor bred In the bride-night's warmth of a changed God's bed, But thy life as a lightning was flashed from the light of thy father's head, O chief God's child by a motherless birth, If aught in thy sight we indeed be worth, Keep death from us thou, that art none of the Gods of the dead under earth. [Ant. 2. Thou that hast power on us, save, if thou wilt; Let the blind wave breach not thy wall scarce built; But bless us not so as by bloodshed, impute not for grace to us guilt, Nor by price of pollution of blood set us free; Let the hands be taintless that clasp thy knee, Nor a maiden be slain to redeem for a maiden her shrine from the sea. [Str. 3. O earth, O sun, turn back Full on his deadly track Death, that would smite you black and mar your creatures, And with one hand disroot All tender flower and fruit, With one strike blind and mute the heaven's fair features, Pluck out the eyes of morn, and make Silence in the east and blackness whence the bright songs break. [Ant. 3. Help, earth, help, heaven, that hear The song-notes of our fear, Shrewd notes and shrill, not clear or joyful-sounding; Hear, highest of Gods, and stay Death on his hunter's way, Full on his forceless prey his beagles hounding; Break thou his bow, make short his hand, Maim his fleet foot whose passage kills the living land. [Str. 4. Let a third wave smite not us, father, Long since sore smitten of twain, Lest the house of thy son's son perish And his name be barren on earth. Whose race wilt thou comfort rather If none to thy son remain? Whose seed wilt thou choose to cherish If his be cut off in the birth? [Ant. 4. For the first fair graft of his graffing Was rent from its maiden root By the strong swift hand of a lover Who fills the night with his breath; On the lip of the stream low-laughing Her green soft virginal shoot Was plucked from the stream-side cover By the grasp of a love like death. [Str. 5. For a God's was the mouth that kissed her Who speaks, and the leaves lie dead, When winter awakes as at warning To the sound of his foot from Thrace. Nor happier the bed of her sister Though Love's self laid her abed By a bridegroom beloved of the morning And fair as the dawn's own face. [Ant. 5. For Procris, ensnared and ensnaring By the fraud of a twofold wile, With the point of her own spear stricken By the gift of her own hand fell. Oversubtle in doubts, overdaring In deeds and devices of guile, And strong to quench as to quicken, O Love, have we named thee well? [Str. 6. By thee was the spear's edge whetted That laid her dead in the dew, In the moist green glens of the midland By her dear lord slain and thee. And him at the cliff's end fretted By the grey keen waves, him too, Thine hand from the white-browed headland Flung down for a spoil to the sea. [Ant. 6. But enough now of griefs grey-growing Have darkened the house divine, Have flowered on its boughs and faded, And green is the brave stock yet. O father all seeing and all knowing, Let the last fruit fall not of thine From the tree with whose boughs we are shaded, From the stock that thy son's hand set. ERECHTHEUS O daughter of Cephisus, from all time Wise have I found thee, wife and queen, of heart Perfect; nor in the days that knew not wind Nor days when storm blew death upon our peace Was thine heart swoln with seed of pride, or bowed With blasts of bitter fear that break men's souls Who lift too high their minds toward heaven, in thought Too godlike grown for worship; but of mood Equal, in good time reverent of time bad, And glad in ill days of the good that were. Nor now too would I fear thee, now misdoubt Lest fate should find thee lesser than thy doom, Chosen if thou be to bear and to be great Haply beyond all women; and the word Speaks thee divine, dear queen, that speaks thee dead, Dead being alive, or quick and dead in one Shall not men call thee living? yet I fear To slay thee timeless with my proper tongue, With lips, thou knowest, that love thee; and such work Was never laid of Gods on men, such word No mouth of man learnt ever, as from mine Most loth to speak thine ear most loth shall take And hold it hateful as the grave to hear. PRAXITHEA That word there is not in all speech of man, King, that being spoken of the Gods and thee I have not heart to honour, or dare hold More than I hold thee or the Gods in hate Hearing; but if my heart abhor it heard Being insubmissive, hold me not thy wife But use me like a stranger, whom thine hand Hath fed by chance and finding thence no thanks Flung off for shame's sake to forgetfulness. ERECHTHEUS O, of what breath shall such a word be made, Or from what heart find utterance? Would my tongue Were rent forth rather from the quivering root Than made as fire or poison thus for thee. PRAXITHEA But if thou speak of blood, and I that hear Be chosen of all for this land's love to die And save to thee thy city, know this well, Happiest I hold me of her seed alive. ERECHTHEUS O sun that seest, what saying was this of thine, God, that thy power has breathed into my lips? For from no sunlit shrine darkling it came. PRAXITHEA What portent from the mid oracular place Hath smitten thee so like a curse that flies Wingless, to waste men with its plagues? yet speak. ERECHTHEUS Thy blood the Gods require not; take this first. PRAXITHEA To me than thee more grievous this should sound. ERECHTHEUS That word rang truer and bitterer than it knew. PRAXITHEA This is not then thy grief, to see me die? ERECHTHEUS Die shalt thou not, yet give thy blood to death. PRAXITHEA If this ring worse I know not; strange it rang. ERECHTHEUS Alas, thou knowest not; woe is me that know. PRAXITHEA And woe shall mine be, knowing; yet halt not here. ERECHTHEUS Guiltless of blood this state may stand no more. PRAXITHEA Firm let it stand whatever bleed or fall. ERECHTHEUS O Gods, that I should say it shall and weep. PRAXITHEA Weep, and say this? no tears should bathe such words. ERECHTHEUS Woe's me that I must weep upon them, woe. PRAXITHEA What stain is on them for thy tears to cleanse? ERECHTHEUS A stain of blood unpurgeable with tears. PRAXITHEA Whence? for thou sayest it is and is not mine. ERECHTHEUS Hear then and know why only of all men I That bring such news as mine is, I alone Must wash good words with weeping; I and thou, Woman, must wail to hear men sing, must groan To see their joy who love us; all our friends Save only we, and all save we that love This holiness of Athens, in our sight Shall lift their hearts up, in our hearing praise Gods whom we may not; for to these they give Life of their children, flower of all their seed, For all their travail fruit, for all their hopes Harvest; but we for all our good things, we Have at their hands which fill all these folk full Death, barrenness, child-slaughter, curses, cares, Sea-leaguer and land-shipwreck; which of these, Which wilt thou first give thanks for? all are thine. PRAXITHEA What first they give who give this city good, For that first given to save it I give thanks First, and thanks heartier from a happier tongue, More than for any my peculiar grace Shown me and not my country; next for this, That none of all these but for all these I Must bear my burden, and no eye but mine Weep of all women's in this broad land born Who see their land's deliverance; but much more, But most for this I thank them most of all, That this their edge of doom is chosen to pierce My heart and not my country's; for the sword Drawn to smite there and sharpened for such stroke Should wound more deep than any turned on me. CHORUS Well fares the land that bears such fruit, and well The spirit that breeds such thought and speech in man. ERECHTHEUS O woman, thou hast shamed my heart with thine, To show so strong a patience; take then all; For all shall break not nor bring down thy soul. The word that journeying to the bright God's shrine Who speaks askance and darkling, but his name Hath in it slaying and ruin broad writ out, I heard, hear thou: thus saith he; There shall die One soul for all this people; from thy womb Came forth the seed that here on dry bare ground Death's hand must sow untimely, to bring forth Nor blade nor shoot in season, being by name To the under Gods made holy, who require For this land's life her death and maiden blood To save a maiden city. Thus I heard, And thus with all said leave thee; for save this No word is left us, and no hope alive. CHORUS [Str. He hath uttered too surely his wrath not obscurely, nor wrapt as in mists of his breath, The master that lightens not hearts he enlightens, but gives them foreknowledge of death. As a bolt from the cloud hath he sent it aloud and proclaimed it afar, From the darkness and height of the horror of night hath he shown us a star. Star may I name it and err not, or flame shall I say, Born of the womb that was born for the tomb of the day? [Ant. O Night, whom other but thee for mother, and Death for the father, Night, Shall we dream to discover, save thee and thy lover, to bring such a sorrow to sight? From the slumberless bed for thy bedfellow spread and his bride under earth Hast thou brought forth a wild and insatiable child, an unbearable birth. Fierce are the fangs of his wrath, and the pangs that they give; None is there, none that may bear them, not one that would live. CHTHONIA Forth of the fine-spun folds of veils that hide My virgin chamber toward the full-faced sun I set my foot not moved of mine own will, Unmaidenlike, nor with unprompted speed Turn eyes too broad or doglike unabashed On reverend heads of men and thence on thine, Mother, now covered from the light and bowed As hers who mourns her brethren; but what grief Bends thy blind head thus earthward, holds thus mute, I know not till thy will be to lift up Toward mine thy sorrow-muffled eyes and speak; And till thy will be would I know this not. PRAXITHEA Old men and childless, or if sons ye have seen And daughters, elder-born were these than mine, Look on this child, how young of years, how sweet, How scant of time and green of age her life Puts forth its flower of girlhood; and her gait How virginal, how soft her speech, her eyes How seemly smiling; wise should all ye be, All honourable and kindly men of age; Now give me counsel and one word to say That I may bear to speak, and hold my peace Henceforth for all time even as all ye now. Dumb are ye all, bowed eyes and tongueless mouths, Unprofitable; if this were wind that speaks, As much its breath might move you. Thou then, child, Set thy sweet eyes on mine; look through them well; Take note of all the writing of my face As of a tablet or a tomb inscribed That bears me record; lifeless now, my life Thereon that was think written; brief to read, Yet shall the scripture sear thine eyes as fire And leave them dark as dead men's. Nay, dear child, Thou hast no skill, my maiden, and no sense To take such knowledge; sweet is all thy lore, And all this bitter; yet I charge thee learn And love and lay this up within thine heart, Even this my word; less ill it were to die Than live and look upon thy mother dead, Thy mother-land that bare thee; no man slain But him who hath seen it shall men count unblest, None blest as him who hath died and seen it not. CHTHONIA That sight some God keep from me though I die. PRAXITHEA A God from thee shall keep it; fear not this. CHTHONIA Thanks all my life long shall he gain of mine. PRAXITHEA Short gain of all yet shall he get of thee. CHTHONIA Brief be my life, yet so long live my thanks. PRAXITHEA So long? so little; how long shall they live? CHTHONIA Even while I see the sunlight and thine eyes. PRAXITHEA Would mine might shut ere thine upon the sun. CHTHONIA For me thou prayest unkindly; change that prayer. PRAXITHEA Not well for me thou sayest, and ill for thee. CHTHONIA Nay, for me well, if thou shalt live, not I. PRAXITHEA How live, and lose these loving looks of thine? CHTHONIA It seems I too, thus praying, then, love thee not. PRAXITHEA Lov'st thou not life? what wouldst thou do to die? CHTHONIA Well, but not more than all things, love I life. PRAXITHEA And fain wouldst keep it as thine age allows? CHTHONIA Fain would I live, and fain not fear to die. PRAXITHEA That I might bid thee die not! Peace; no more. CHORUS A godlike race of grief the Gods have set For these to run matched equal, heart with heart. PRAXITHEA Child of the chief of Gods, and maiden crowned, Queen of these towers and fostress of their king, Pallas, and thou my father's holiest head, A living well of life nor stanched nor stained, O God Cephisus, thee too charge I next, Be to me judge and witness; nor thine ear Shall now my tongue invoke not, thou to me Most hateful of things holy, mournfullest Of all old sacred streams that wash the world, Ilissus, on whose marge at flowery play A whirlwind-footed bridegroom found my child And rapt her northward where mine elder-born Keeps now the Thracian bride-bed of a God Intolerable to seamen, but this land Finds him in hope for her sake favourable, A gracious son by wedlock; hear me then Thou likewise, if with no faint heart or false The word I say be said, the gift be given, Which might I choose I had rather die than give Or speak and die not. Ere thy limbs were made Or thine eyes lightened, strife, thou knowest, my child, 'Twixt God and God had risen, which heavenlier name Should here stand hallowed, whose more liberal grace Should win this city's worship, and our land To which of these do reverence; first the lord Whose wheels make lightnings of the foam-flowered sea Here on this rock, whose height brow-bound with dawn Is head and heart of Athens, one sheer blow Struck, and beneath the triple wound that shook The stony sinews and stark roots of the earth Sprang toward the sun a sharp salt fount, and sank Where lying it lights the heart up of the hill, A well of bright strange brine; but she that reared Thy father with her same chaste fostering hand Set for a sign against it in our guard The holy bloom of the olive, whose hoar leaf High in the shadowy shrine of Pandrosus Hath honour of us all; and of this strife The twelve most high Gods judging with one mouth Acclaimed her victress; wroth whereat, as wronged That she should hold from him such prize and place, The strong king of the tempest-rifted sea Loosed reinless on the low Thriasian plain The thunders of his chariots, swallowing stunned Earth, beasts, and men, the whole blind foundering world That was the sun's at morning, and ere noon Death's; nor this only prey fulfilled his mind; For with strange crook-toothed prows of Carian folk Who snatch a sanguine life out of the sea, Thieves keen to pluck their bloody fruit of spoil From the grey fruitless waters, has their God Furrowed our shores to waste them, as the fields Were landward harried from the north with swords Aonian, sickles of man-slaughtering edge Ground for no hopeful harvest of live grain Against us in Bœotia; these being spent, Now this third time his wind of wrath has blown Right on this people a mightier wave of war, Three times more huge a ruin; such its ridge Foam-rimmed and hollow like the womb of heaven, But black for shining, and with death for life Big now to birth and ripe with child, full-blown With fear and fruit of havoc, takes the sun Out of our eyes, darkening the day, and blinds The fair sky's face unseasonably with change, A cloud in one and billow of battle, a surge High reared as heaven with monstrous surf of spears That shake on us their shadow, till men's heads Bend, and their hearts even with its forward wind Wither, so blasts all seed in them of hope Its breath and blight of presage; yea, even now The winter of this wind out of the deeps Makes cold our trust in comfort of the Gods And blind our eye toward outlook; yet not here, Here never shall the Thracian plant on high For ours his father's symbol, nor with wreaths A strange folk wreathe it upright set and crowned Here where our natural people born behold The golden Gorgon of the shield's defence That screens their flowering olive, nor strange Gods Be graced, and Pallas here have praise no more. And if this be not I must give my child, Thee, mine own very blood and spirit of mine, Thee to be slain. Turn from me, turn thine eyes A little from me; I can bear not yet To see if still they smile on mine or no, If fear make faint the light in them, or faith Fix them as stars of safety. Need have we, Sore need of stars that set not in mid storm, Lights that outlast the lightnings; yet my heart Endures not to make proof of thine or these, Not yet to know thee whom I made, and bare What manner of woman; had I borne thee man, I had made no question of thine eyes or heart, Nor spared to read the scriptures in them writ, Wert thou my son; yet couldst thou then but die Fallen in sheer fight by chance and charge of spears And have no more of memory, fill no tomb More famous than thy fellows in fair field, Where many share the grave, many the praise; But one crown shall one only girl my child Wear, dead for this dear city, and give back life To him that gave her and to me that bare, And save two sisters living; and all this, Is this not all good? I shall give thee, child, Thee but by fleshly nature mine, to bleed For dear land's love; but if the city fall What part is left me in my children then? But if it stand and thou for it lie dead, Then hast thou in it a better part than we, A holier portion than we all; for each Hath but the length of his own life to live, And this most glorious mother-land on earth To worship till that life have end; but thine Hath end no more than hers; thou, dead, shalt live Till Athens live not; for the days and nights Given of thy bare brief dark dividual life, Shall she give thee half all her agelong own And all its glory; for thou givest her these; But with one hand she takes and gives again More than I gave or she requires of thee. Come therefore, I will make thee fit for death, I that could give thee, dear, no gift at birth Save of light life that breathes and bleeds, even I Will help thee to this better gift than mine And lead thee by this little living hand That death shall make so strong, to that great end Whence it shall lighten like a God's, and strike Dead the strong heart of battle that would break Athens; but ye, pray for this land, old men, That it may bring forth never child on earth To love it less, for none may more, than we. CHORUS [Str. 1. Out of the north wind grief came forth, And the shining of a sword out of the sea. Yea, of old the first-blown blast blew the prelude of this last, The blast of his trumpet upon Rhodope. Out of the north skies full of his cloud, With the clamour of his storms as of a crowd At the wheels of a great king crying aloud, At the axle of a strong king's car That has girded on the girdle of war— With hands that lightened the skies in sunder And feet whose fall was followed of thunder, A God, a great God strange of name, With horse-yoke fleeter-hoofed than flame, To the mountain bed of a maiden came, Oreithyia, the bride mismated, Wofully wed in a snow-strewn bed With a bridegroom that kisses the bride's mouth dead; Without garland, without glory, without song, As a fawn by night on the hills belated, Given over for a spoil unto the strong. [Ant. 1. From lips how pale so keen a wail At the grasp of a God's hand on her she gave, When his breath that darkens air made a havoc of her hair, It rang from the mountain even to the wave; Rang with a cry, Woe's me, woe is me! From the darkness upon Hæmus to the sea: And with hands that clung to her new lord's knee, As a virgin overborne with shame, She besought him by her spouseless fame, By the blameless breasts of a maid unmarried, And locks unmaidenly rent and harried, And all her flower of body, born To match the maidenhood of morn, With the might of the wind's wrath wrenched and torn. Vain, all vain as a dead man's vision Falling by night in his old friends' sight, To be scattered with slumber and slain ere light; Such a breath of such a bridegroom in that hour Of her prayers made mock, of her fears derision, And a ravage of her youth as of a flower. [Str. 2. With a leap of his limbs as a lion's, a cry from his lips as of thunder, In a storm of amorous godhead filled with fire, From the height of the heaven that was rent with the roar of his coming in sunder, Sprang the strong God on the spoil of his desire. And the pines of the hills were as green reeds shattered, And their branches as buds of the soft spring scattered, And the west wind and east, and the sound of the south, Fell dumb at the blast of the north wind's mouth, At the cry of his coming out of heaven. And the wild beasts quailed in the rifts and hollows Where hound nor clarion of huntsman follows, And the depths of the sea were aghast, and whitened, And the crowns of their waves were as flame that lightened, And the heart of the floods thereof was riven. [Ant. 2. But she knew not him coming for terror, she felt not her wrong that he wrought her, When her locks as leaves were shed before his breath, And she heard not for terror his prayer, though the cry was a God's that besought her, Blown from lips that strew the world-wide seas with death. For the heart was molten within her to hear, And her knees beneath her were loosened for fear, And her blood fast bound as a frost-bound water, And the soft new bloom of the green earth's daughter Wind-wasted as blossom of a tree; As the wild God rapt her from earth's breast lifted, On the strength of the stream of his dark breath drifted, From the bosom of earth as a bride from the mother, With storm for bridesman and wreck for brother, As a cloud that he sheds upon the sea. [Epode. Of this hoary-headed woe Song made memory long ago; Now a younger grief to mourn Needs a new song younger born. Who shall teach our tongues to reach What strange height of saddest speech, For the new bride's sake that is given to be A stay to fetter the foot of the sea, Lest it quite spurn down and trample the town, Ere the violets be dead that were plucked for its crown, Or its olive-leaf whiten and wither? Who shall say of the wind's way That he journeyed yesterday, Or the track of the storm that shall sound to-morrow, If the new be more than the grey-grown sorrow? For the wind of the green first season was keen, And the blast shall be sharper than blew between That the breath of the sea blows hither. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS Old men, grey borderers on the march of death, Tongue-fighters, tough of talk and sinewy speech, Else nerveless, from no crew of such faint folk Whose tongues are stouter than their hands come I To bid not you to battle; let them strike Whose swords are sharper than your keen-tongued wail, And ye, sit fast and sorrow; but what man Of all this land-folk and earth-labouring herd For heart or hand seems foremost, him I call If heart be his to hearken, him bid forth To try if one be in the sun's sight born Of all that grope and grovel on dry ground That may join hands in battle-grip for death With them whose seed and strength is of the sea. CHORUS Know thou this much for all thy loud blast blown, We lack not hands to speak with, swords to plead, For proof of peril, not of boisterous breath, Sea-wind and storm of barren mouths that foam And rough rock's edge of menace; and short space May lesson thy large ignorance and inform This insolence with knowledge if there live Men earth-begotten of no tenderer thews Than knit the great joints of the grim sea's brood With hasps of steel together; heaven to help, One man shall break, even on their own flood's verge, That iron bulk of battle; but thine eye That sees it now swell higher than sand or shore Haply shall see not when thine host shall shrink. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS Not haply, nay, but surely, shall not thine. CHORUS That lot shall no God give who fights for thee. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS Shall Gods bear bit and bridle, fool, of men? CHORUS Nor them forbid we nor shalt thou constrain. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS Yet say'st thou none shall make the good lot mine? CHORUS Of thy side none, nor moved for fear of thee. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS Gods hast thou then to baffle Gods of ours? CHORUS Nor thine nor mine, but equal-souled are they. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS Toward good and ill, then, equal-eyed of soul? CHORUS Nay, but swift-eyed to note where ill thoughts breed. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS Thy shaft word-feathered flies yet far of me. CHORUS Pride knows not, wounded, till the heart be cleft. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS No shaft wounds deep whose wing is plumed with words. CHORUS Lay that to heart, and bid thy tongue learn grace. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS Grace shall thine own crave soon too late of mine. CHORUS Boast thou till then, but I wage words no more. ERECHTHEUS Man, what shrill wind of speech and wrangling air Blows in our ears a summons from thy lips Winged with what message, or what gift or grace Requiring? none but what his hand may take Here may the foe think hence to reap, nor this Except some doom from Godward yield it him. HERALD OF EUMOLPUS King of this land-folk, by my mouth to thee Thus saith the son of him that shakes thine earth, Eumolpus; now the stakes of war are set, For land or sea to win by throw and wear; Choose therefore or to quit thy side and give The palm unfought for to his bloodless hand, Or by that father's sceptre, and the foot Whose tramp far off makes tremble for pure fear Thy soul-struck mother, piercing like a sword The immortal womb that bare thee; by the waves That no man bridles and that bound thy world, And by the winds and storms of all the sea, He swears to raze from eyeshot of the sun This city named not of his father's name, And wash to deathward down one flood of doom This whole fresh brood of earth yeaned naturally, Green yet and faint in its first blade, unblown With yellow hope of harvest; so do thou, Seeing whom thy time is come to meet, for fear Yield, or gird up thy force to fight and die. ERECHTHEUS To fight then be it; for if to die or live, No man but only a God knows this much yet Seeing us fare forth, who bear but in our hands The weapons not the fortunes of our fight; For these now rest as lots that yet undrawn Lie in the lap of the unknown hour; but this I know, not thou, whose hollow mouth of storm Is but a warlike wind, a sharp salt breath That bites and wounds not; death nor life of mine Shall give to death or lordship of strange kings The soul of this live city, nor their heel Bruise her dear brow discrowned, nor snaffle or goad Wound her free mouth or stain her sanguine side Yet masterless of man; so bid thy lord Learn ere he weep to learn it, and too late Gnash teeth that could not fasten on her flesh, And foam his life out in dark froth of blood Vain as a wind's waif of the loud-mouthed sea Torn from the wave's edge whitening. Tell him this; Though thrice his might were mustered for our scathe And thicker set with fence of thorn-edged spears Than sands are whirled about the wintering beach When storms have swoln the rivers, and their blasts Have breached the broad sea-banks with stress of sea, That waves of inland and the main make war As men that mix and grapple; though his ranks Were more to number than all wildwood leaves The wind waves on the hills of all the world, Yet should the heart not faint, the head not fall, The breath not fail of Athens. Say, the Gods From lips that have no more on earth to say Have told thee this the last good news or ill That I shall speak in sight of earth and sun Or he shall hear and see them: for the next That ear of his from tongue of mine may take Must be the first word spoken underground From dead to dead in darkness. Hence; make haste, Lest war's fleet foot be swifter than thy tongue And I that part not to return again On him that comes not to depart away Be fallen before thee; for the time is full, And with such mortal hope as knows not fear I go this high last way to the end of all. CHORUS [Str. 1. Who shall put a bridle in the mourner's lips to chasten them, Or seal up the fountains of his tears for shame? Song nor prayer nor prophecy shall slacken tears nor hasten them, Till grief be within him as a burnt-out flame; Till the passion be broken in his breast And the might thereof molten into rest, And the rain of eyes that weep be dry, And the breath be stilled of lips that sigh. [Ant. 1. Death at last for all men is a harbour; yet they flee from it, Set sails to the storm-wind and again to sea; Yet for all their labour no whit further shall they be from it, Nor longer but wearier shall their life's work be. And with anguish of travail until night Shall they steer into shipwreck out of sight, And with oars that break and shrouds that strain Shall they drive whence no ship steers again. [Str. 2. Bitter and strange is the word of the God most high, And steep the strait of his way. Through a pass rock-rimmed and narrow the light that gleams On the faces of men falls faint as the dawn of dreams, The dayspring of death as a star in an under sky Where night is the dead men's day. [Ant. 2. As darkness and storm is his will that on earth is done, As a cloud is the face of his strength. King of kings, holiest of holies, and mightiest of might, Lord of the lords of thine heaven that are humble in thy sight, Hast thou set not an end for the path of the fires of the sun, To appoint him a rest at length? [Str. 3. Hast thou told not by measure the waves of the waste wide sea, And the ways of the wind their master and thrall to thee? Hast thou filled not the furrows with fruit for the world's increase? Has thine ear not heard from of old or thine eye not read The thought and the deed of us living, the doom of us dead? Hast thou made not war upon earth, and again made peace? [Ant. 3. Therefore, O father, that seest us whose lives are a breath, Take off us thy burden, and give us not wholly to death. For lovely is life, and the law wherein all things live, And gracious the season of each, and the hour of its kind, And precious the seed of his life in a wise man's mind; But all save life for his life will a base man give. [Str. 4. But a life that is given for the life of the whole live land, From a heart unspotted a gift of a spotless hand, Of pure will perfect and free, for the land's life's sake, What man shall fear not to put forth his hand and take? [Ant. 4. For the fruit of a sweet life plucked in its pure green prime On his hand who plucks is as blood, on his soul as crime. With cursing ye buy not blessing, nor peace with strife, And the hand is hateful that chaffers with death for life. [Str. 5. Hast thou heard, O my heart, and endurest The word that is said, What a garland by sentence found surest Is wrought for what head? With what blossomless flowerage of sea-foam and blood-coloured foliage inwound It shall crown as a heifer's for slaughter the forehead for marriage uncrowned? [Ant. 5. How the veils and the wreaths that should cover The brows of the bride Shall be shed by the breath of what lover And scattered aside? With a blast of the mouth of what bridegroom the crowns shall be cast from her hair, And her head by what altar made humble be left of them naked and bare? [Str. 6. At a shrine unbeloved of a God unbeholden a gift shall be given for the land, That its ramparts though shaken with clamour and horror of manifold waters may stand: That the crests of its citadels crowned and its turrets that thrust up their heads to the sun May behold him unblinded with darkness of waves overmastering their bulwarks begun. [Ant. 6. As a bride shall they bring her, a prey for the bridegroom, a flower for the couch of her lord; They shall muffle her mouth that she cry not or curse them, and cover her eyes from the sword. They shall fasten her lips as with bit and with bridle, and darken the light of her face, That the soul of the slayer may not falter, his heart be not molten, his hand give not grace. [Str. 7. If she weep then, yet may none that hear take pity; If she cry not, none should hearken though she cried. Shall a virgin shield thine head for love, O city, With a virgin's blood anointed as for pride? [Ant. 7. Yet we held thee dear and hallowed of her favour, Dear of all men held thy people to her heart; Nought she loves the breath of blood, the sanguine savour, Who hath built with us her throne and chosen her part. [Epode. Bloodless are her works, and sweet All the ways that feel her feet; From the empire of her eyes Light takes life and darkness flies; From the harvest of her hands Wealth strikes root in prosperous lands; Wisdom of her word is made; At her strength is strength afraid; From the beam of her bright spear War's fleet foot goes back for fear; In her shrine she reared the birth Fire-begotten on live earth; Glory from her helm was shed On his olive-shadowed head; By no hand but his shall she Scourge the storms back of the sea, To no fame but his shall give Grace, being dead, with hers to live, And in double name divine Half the godhead of their shrine. But now with what word, with what woe may we meet The timeless passage of piteous feet, Hither that bend to the last way's end They shall walk upon earth? What song be rolled for a bride black-stoled And the mother whose hand of her hand hath hold? For anguish of heart is my soul's strength broken And the tongue sealed fast that would fain have spoken, To behold thee, O child of so bitter a birth That we counted so sweet, What way thy steps to what bride-feast tend, What gift he must give that shall wed thee for token If the bridegroom be goodly to greet. CHTHONIA People, old men of my city, lordly wise and hoar of head, I a spouseless bride and crownless but with garlands of the dead From the fruitful light turn silent to my dark unchilded bed. CHORUS Wise of word was he too surely, but with deadlier wisdom wise, First who gave thee name from under earth, no breath from upper skies, When, foredoomed to this day's darkness, their first daylight filled thine eyes. PRAXITHEA Child, my child that wast and art but death's and now no more of mine, Half my heart is cloven with anguish by the sword made sharp for thine, Half exalts its wing for triumph, that I bare thee thus divine. CHTHONIA Though for me the sword's edge thirst that sets no point against thy breast, Mother, O my mother, where I drank of life and fell on rest. Thine, not mine, is all the grief that marks this hour accurst and blest. CHORUS Sweet thy sleep and sweet the bosom was that gave thee sleep and birth; Harder now the breast, and girded with no marriage-band for girth, Where thine head shall sleep, the namechild of the lords of under earth. PRAXITHEA Dark the name and dark the gifts they gave thee, child, in childbirth were, Sprung from him that rent the womb of earth, a bitter seed to bear, Born with groanings of the ground that gave him way toward heaven's dear air. CHTHONIA Day to day makes answer, first to last, and life to death; but I, Born for death's sake, die for life's sake, if indeed this be to die, This my doom that seals me deathless till the springs of time run dry. CHORUS Children shalt thou bear to memory, that to man shalt bring forth none; Yea, the lordliest that lift eyes and hearts and songs to meet the sun, Names to fire men's ears like music till the round world's race be run. PRAXITHEA I thy mother, named of Gods that wreak revenge and brand with blame, Now for thy love shall be loved as thou, and famous with thy fame, While this city's name on earth shall be for earth her mightiest name. CHTHONIA That I may give this poor girl's blood of mine Scarce yet sun-warmed with summer, this thin life Still green with flowerless growth of seedling days, To build again my city; that no drop Fallen of these innocent veins on the cold ground But shall help knit the joints of her firm walls To knead the stones together, and make sure The band about her maiden girdlestead Once fastened, and of all men's violent hands Inviolable for ever; these to me Were no such gifts as crave no thanksgiving, If with one blow dividing the sheer life I might make end, and one pang wind up all And seal mine eyes from sorrow; for such end The Gods give none they love not; but my heart, That leaps up lightened of all sloth or fear To take the sword's point, yet with one thought's load Flags, and falls back, broken of wing, that halts Maimed in mid flight for thy sake and borne down, Mother, that in the places where I played An arm's length from thy bosom and no more Shalt find me never, nor thine eye wax glad To mix with mine its eyesight and for love Laugh without word, filled with sweet light, and speak Divine dumb things of the inward spirit and heart, Moved silently; nor hand or lip again Touch hand or lip of either, but for mine Shall thine meet only shadows of swift night, Dreams and dead thoughts of dead things; and the bed Thou strewedst, a sterile place for all time, strewn For my sleep only, with its void sad sheets Shall vex thee, and the unfruitful coverlid For empty days reproach me dead, that leave No profit of my body, but am gone As one not worth being born to bear no seed, A sapless stock and branchless; yet thy womb Shall want not honour of me, that brought forth For all this people freedom, and for earth From the unborn city born out of my blood To light the face of all men evermore Glory; but lay thou this to thy great heart Whereunder in the dark of birth conceived Mine unlit life lay girdled with the zone That bound thy bridal bosom; set this thought Against all edge of evil as a sword To beat back sorrow, that for all the world Thou brought'st me forth a saviour, who shall save Athens; for none but I from none but thee Shall take this death for garland; and the men Mine unknown children of unsounded years, My sons unrisen shall rise up at thine hand, Sown of thy seed to bring forth seed to thee, And call thee most of all most fruitful found Blessed; but me too for my barren womb More than my sisters for their children born Shall these give honour, yea in scorn's own place Shall men set love and bring for mockery praise And thanks for curses; for the dry wild vine Scoffed at and cursed of all men that was I Shall shed them wine to make the world's heart warm, That all eyes seeing may lighten, and all ears Hear and be kindled; such a draught to drink Shall be the blood that bids this dust bring forth, The chaliced life here spilt on this mine earth, Mine, my great father's mother; whom I pray Take me now gently, tenderly take home, And softly lay in his my cold chaste hand Who is called of men by my name, being of Gods Charged only and chosen to bring men under earth, And now must lead and stay me with his staff A silent soul led of a silent God, Toward sightless things led sightless; and on earth I see now but the shadow of mine end, And this last light of all for me in heaven. PRAXITHEA Farewell I bid thee; so bid thou not me, Lest the Gods hear and mock us; yet on these I lay the weight not of this grief, nor cast Ill words for ill deeds back; for if one say They have done men wrong, what hurt have they to hear, Or he what help to have said it? surely, child, If one among men born might say it and live Blameless, none more than I may, who being vexed Hold yet my peace; for now through tears enough Mine eyes have seen the sun that from this day Thine shall see never more; and in the night Enough has blown of evil, and mine ears With wail enough the winds have filled, and brought Too much of cloud from over the sharp sea To mar for me the morning; such a blast Rent from these wide void arms and helpless breast Long since one graft of me disbranched, and bore Beyond the wild ways of the unwandered world And loud wastes of the thunder-throated sea, Springs of the night and openings of the heaven, The old garden of the Sun; whence never more From west or east shall winds bring back that blow From folds of opening heaven or founts of night The flower of mine once ravished, born my child To bear strange children; nor on wings of theirs Shall comfort come back to me, nor their sire Breathe help upon my peril, nor his strength Raise up my weakness; but of Gods and men I drift unsteered on ruin, and the wave Darkens my head with imminent height, and hangs Dumb, filled too full with thunder that shall leave These ears death-deafened when the tide finds tongue And all its wrath bears on them; thee, O child, I help not, nor am holpen; fain, ah fain, More than was ever mother born of man, Were I to help thee; fain beyond all prayer, Beyond all thought fain to redeem thee, torn More timeless from me sorrowing than the dream That was thy sister; so shalt thou be too, Thou but a vision, shadow-shaped of sleep, By grief made out of nothing; now but once I touch, but once more hold thee, one more kiss This last time and none other ever more Leave on thy lips and leave them. Go; thou wast My heart, my heart's blood, life-blood of my life, My child, my nursling: now this breast once thine Shall rear again no children; never now Shall any mortal blossom born like thee Lie there, nor ever with small silent mouth Draw the sweet springs dry for an hour that feed The blind blithe life that knows not; never head Rest here to make these cold veins warm, nor eye Laugh itself open with the lips that reach Lovingly toward a fount more loving; these Death makes as all good lesser things now dead, And all the latter hopes that flowered from these And fall as these fell fruitless; no joy more Shall man take of thy maidenhood, no tongue Praise it; no good shall eyes get more of thee That lightened for thy love's sake. Now, take note, Give ear, O all ye people, that my word May pierce your hearts through, and the stroke that cleaves Be fruitful to them; so shall all that hear Grow great at heart with child of thought most high And bring forth seed in season; this my child, This flower of this my body, this sweet life, This fair live youth I give you, to be slain, Spent, shed, poured out, and perish; take my gift And give it death and the under Gods who crave So much for that they give; for this is more, Much more is this than all we; for they give Freedom, and for a blast, an air of breath, A little soul that is not, they give back Light for all eyes, cheer for all hearts, and life That fills the world's width full of fame and praise And mightier love than children's. This they give, The grace to make thy country great, and wrest From time and death power to take hold on her And strength to scathe for ever; and this gift, Is this no more than man's love is or mine, Mine and all mothers'? nay, where that seems more, Where one loves life of child, wife, father, friend, Son, husband, mother, more than this, even there Are all these lives worth nothing, all loves else With this love slain and buried, and their tomb A thing for shame to spit on; for what love Hath a slave left to love with? or the heart Base-born and bound in bondage fast to fear, What should it do to love thee? what hath he, The man that hath no country? Gods nor men Have such to friend, yoked beast-like to base life, Vile, fruitless, grovelling at the foot of death, Landless and kinless thralls of no man's blood, Unchilded and unmothered, abject limbs That breed things abject; but who loves on earth Not friend, wife, husband, father, mother, child, Nor loves his own life for his own land's sake, But only this thing most, more this than all, He loves all well and well of all is loved, And this love lives for ever. See now, friends, My countrymen, my brothers, with what heart I give you this that of your hands again The Gods require for Athens; as I give So give ye to them what their hearts would have Who shall give back things better; yea, and these I take for me to witness, all these Gods, Were their great will more grievous than it is, Not one but three, for this one thin-spun thread A threefold band of children would I give For this land's love's sake; for whose love to-day I bid thee, child, fare deathward and farewell. CHORUS O wofullest of women, yet of all Happiest, thy word be hallowed; in all time Thy name shall blossom, and from strange new tongues High things be spoken of thee; for such grace The Gods have dealt to no man, that on none Have laid so heavy sorrow. From this day Live thou assured of godhead in thy blood, And in thy fate no lowlier than a God In all good things and evil; such a name Shall be thy child this city's, and thine own Next hers that called it Athens. Go now forth Blest, and grace with thee to the doors of death. CHTHONIA O city, O glory of Athens, O crown of my father's land, farewell. CHORUS For welfare is given her of thee. CHTHONIA O Goddess, be good to thy people, that in them dominion and freedom may dwell. CHORUS Turn from us the strengths of the sea. CHTHONIA Let glory's and theirs be one name in the mouths of all nations made glad with the sun. CHORUS For the cloud is blown back with thy breath. CHTHONIA With the long last love of mine eyes I salute thee, O land where my days now are done. CHORUS But her life shall be born of thy death. CHTHONIA I put on me the darkness thy shadow, my mother, and symbol, O Earth, of my name. CHORUS For thine was her witness from birth. CHTHONIA In thy likeness I come to thee darkling, a daughter whose dawn and her even are the same. CHORUS Be thine heart to her gracious, O Earth. CHTHONIA To thine own kind be kindly, for thy son's name's sake. CHORUS That sons unborn may praise thee and thy first-born son. CHTHONIA Give me thy sleep, who give thee all my life awake. CHORUS Too swift a sleep, ere half the web of day be spun. CHTHONIA Death brings the shears or ever life wind up the weft. CHORUS Their edge is ground and sharpened; who shall stay his hand? CHTHONIA The woof is thin, a small short life, with no thread left. CHORUS Yet hath it strength, stretched out, to shelter all the land. CHTHONIA Too frail a tent for covering, and a screen too strait. CHORUS Yet broad enough for buckler shall thy sweet life be. CHTHONIA A little bolt to bar off battle from the gate. CHORUS A wide sea-wall, that shatters the besieging sea. CHTHONIA [Str. I lift up mine eyes from the skirts of the shadow, From the border of death to the limits of light; O streams and rivers of mountain and meadow That hallow the last of my sight, O father that wast of my mother Cephisus, O thou too his brother From the bloom of whose banks as a prey Winds harried my sister away, O crown on the world's head lying Too high for its waters to drown, Take yet this one word of me dying, O city, O crown. [Ant. Though land-wind and sea-wind with mouths that blow slaughter Should gird them to battle against thee again, New-born of the blood of a maiden thy daughter, The rage of their breath shall be vain. For their strength shall be quenched and made idle, And the foam of their mouths find a bridle, And the height of their heads bow down At the foot of the towers of the town. Be blest and beloved as I love thee Of all that shall draw from thee breath; Be thy life as the sun's is above thee; I go to my death. CHORUS [Str. 1. Many loves of many a mood and many a kind Fill the life of man, and mould the secret mind; Many days bring many dooms, to loose and bind; Sweet is each in season, good the gift it brings, Sweet as change of night and day with altering wings, Night that lulls world-weary day, day that comforts night, Night that fills our eyes with sleep, day that fills with light. [Ant. 1. None of all is lovelier, loftier love is none, Less is bride's for bridegroom, mother's less for son, Child, than this that crowns and binds up all in one; Love of thy sweet light, thy fostering breast and hand, Mother Earth, and city chosen, and natural land; Hills that bring the strong streams forth, heights of heavenlier air, Fields aflower with winds and suns, woods with shadowing hair. [Str. 2. But none of the nations of men shall they liken to thee, Whose children true-born and the fruit of thy body are we. The rest are thy sons but in figure, in word are thy seed; We only the flower of thy travail, thy children indeed. Of thy soil hast thou fashioned our limbs, of thy waters their blood, And the life of thy springs everlasting is fount of our flood. No wind oversea blew us hither adrift on thy shore, None sowed us by land in thy womb that conceived us and bore. But the stroke of the shaft of the sunlight that brought us to birth Pierced only and quickened thy furrows to bear us, O Earth. With the beams of his love wast thou cloven as with iron or fire, And the life in thee yearned for his life, and grew great with desire. And the hunger and thirst to be wounded and healed with his dart Made fruitful the love in thy veins and the depth of thine heart. And the showers out of heaven overflowing and liquid with love Fulfilled thee with child of his godhead as rain from above. [Ant. 2. Such desire had ye twain of each other, till molten in one Ye might bear and beget of your bodies the fruits of the sun. And the trees in their season brought forth and were kindled anew By the warmth of the moisture of marriage, the child-bearing dew. And the firstlings were fair of the wedlock of heaven and of earth; All countries were bounteous with blossom and burgeon of birth. Green pastures of grass for all cattle, and life-giving corn; But here of thy bosom, here only, the man-child was born. All races but one are as aliens engrafted or sown, Strange children and changelings; but we, O our mother, thine own. Thy nurslings are others, and seedlings they know not of whom; For these hast thou fostered, but us thou hast borne in thy womb. Who is he of us all, O beloved, that owe thee for birth, Who would give not his blood for his birth's sake, O mother, O Earth? What landsman is he that was fostered and reared of thine hand Who may vaunt him as we may in death though he died for the land? [Epode. Well doth she therefore who gives thee in guerdon The bloom of the life of thy giving; And thy body was bowed by no fruitless burden, That bore such fruit of thee living. For her face was not darkened for fear, For her eyelids conceived not a tear, Nor a cry from her lips craved pity; But her mouth was a fountain of song, And her heart as a citadel strong That guards the heart of the city. MESSENGER High things of strong-souled men that loved their land On brass and stone are written, and their deeds On high days chanted; but none graven or sung That ever set men's eyes or spirits on fire, Athenians, has the sun's height seen, or earth Heard in her depth reverberate as from heaven, More worth men's praise and good report of Gods Than here I bring for record in your ears. For now being come to the altar, where as priest Death ministering should meet her, and his hand Seal her sweet eyes asleep, the maiden stood, With light in all her face as of a bride Smiling, or shine of festal flame by night Far flung from towers of triumph; and her lips Trembled with pride in pleasure, that no fear Blanched them nor death before his time drank dry The blood whose bloom fulfilled them; for her cheeks Lightened, and brighter than a bridal veil Her hair enrobed her bosom and enrolled From face to feet the body's whole soft length As with a cloud sun-saturate; then she spake With maiden tongue words manlike, but her eyes Lit mildly like a maiden's: Countrymen, With more goodwill and height of happier heart I give me to you than my mother bare, And go more gladly this great way to death Than young men bound to battle. Then with face Turned to the shadowiest part of all the shrine And eyes fast set upon the further shade, Take me, dear Gods; and as some form had shone From the deep hollow shadow, some God's tongue Answered, I bless you that your guardian grace Gives me to guard this country, takes my blood, Your child's by name, to heal it. Then the priest Set to the flower-sweet snow of her soft throat The sheer knife's edge that severed it, and loosed From the fair bondage of so spotless flesh So strong a spirit; and all that girt them round Gazing, with souls that hung on that sad stroke, Groaned, and kept silence after while a man Might count how far the fresh blood crept, and bathed How deep the dark robe and the bright shrine's base Red-rounded with a running ring that grew More large and duskier as the wells that fed Were drained of that pure effluence: but the queen Groaned not nor spake nor wept, but as a dream Floats out of eyes awakening so past forth Ghost-like, a shadow of sorrow, from all sight To the inner court and chamber where she sits Dumb, till word reach her of this whole day's end. CHORUS [Str. More hapless born by far Beneath some wintrier star, One sits in stone among high Lydian snows, The tomb of her own woes: Yet happiest was once of the daughters of Gods, and divine by her sire and her lord, Ere her tongue was a shaft for the hearts of her sons, for the heart of her husband a sword. [Ant. For she, too great of mind, Grown through her good things blind, With godless lips and fire of her own breath Spake all her house to death; But thou, no mother unmothered, nor kindled in spirit with pride of thy seed, Thou hast hallowed thy child for a blameless blood-offering, and ransomed thy race by thy deed. MESSENGER As flower is graffed on flower, so grief on grief Engraffed brings forth new blossoms of strange tears, Fresh buds and green fruits of an alien pain; For now flies rumour on a dark wide wing, Murmuring of woes more than ye knew, most like Hers whom ye hailed most wretched; for the twain Last left of all this house that wore last night A threefold crown of maidens, and to-day Should let but one fall dead out of the wreath, If mad with grief we know not and sore love For this their sister, or with shame soul-stung To outlive her dead or doubt lest their lives too The Gods require to seal their country safe And bring the oracular doom to perfect end, Have slain themselves, and fallen at the altar-foot Lie by their own hands done to death; and fear Shakes all the city as winds a wintering tree, And as dead leaves are men's hearts blown about And shrunken with ill thoughts, and flowerless hopes Parched up with presage, lest the piteous blood Shed of these maidens guiltless fall and fix On this land's forehead like a curse that cleaves To the unclean soul's inexpiate hunted head Whom his own crime tracks hotlier than a hound To life's veiled end unsleeping; and this hour Now blackens toward the battle that must close All gates of hope and fear on all their hearts Who tremble toward its issue, knowing not yet If blood may buy them surety, cleanse or soil The helpless hands men raise and reach no stay. CHORUS [Str. 1. Ill thoughts breed fear, and fear ill words; but these The Gods turn from us that have kept their law. Let us lift up the strength of our hearts in song, And our souls to the height of the darkling day. If the wind in our eyes blow blood for spray, Be the spirit that breathes in us life more strong, Though the prow reel round and the helm point wrong, And sharp reefs whiten the shoreward way. [Ant. 1. For the steersman time sits hidden astern, With dark hand plying the rudder of doom, And the surf-smoke under it flies like fume As the blast shears off and the oar-blades churn The foam of our lives that to death return, Blown back as they break to the gulfing gloom. [Str. 2. What cloud upon heaven is arisen, what shadow, what sound, From the world beyond earth, from the night underground, That scatters from wings unbeholden the weight of its darkness around? [Ant. 2. For the sense of my spirit is broken, and blinded its eye, As the soul of a sick man ready to die, With fear of the hour that is on me, with dread if an end be not nigh. [Str. 3. O Earth, O Gods of the land, have ye heart now to see and to hear What slays with terror mine eyesight and seals mine ear? O fountains of streams everlasting, are all ye not shrunk up and withered for fear? [Ant. 3. Lo, night is arisen on the noon, and her hounds are in quest by day, And the world is fulfilled of the noise of them crying for their prey, And the sun's self stricken in heaven, and cast out of his course as a blind man astray. [Str. 4. From east to west of the south sea-line Glitters the lightning of spears that shine; As a storm-cloud swoln that comes up from the skirts of the sea By the wind for helmsman to shoreward ferried, So black behind them the live storm serried Shakes earth with the tramp of its foot, and the terror to be. [Ant. 4. Shall the sea give death whom the land gave birth? O Earth, fair mother, O sweet live Earth, Hide us again in thy womb from the waves of it, help us or hide. As a sword is the heart of the God thy brother, But thine as the heart of a new-made mother, To deliver thy sons from his ravin, and rage of his tide. [Str. 5. O strong north wind, the pilot of cloud and rain, For the gift we gave thee what gift hast thou given us again? O God dark-winged, deep-throated, a terror to forth-faring ships by night, What bride-song is this that is blown on the blast of thy breath? A gift but of grief to thy kinsmen, a song but of death, For the bride's folk weeping, and woe for her father, who finds thee against him in fight. [Ant. 5. Turn back from us, turn thy battle, take heed of our cry; Let thy dread breath sound, and the waters of war be dry; Let thy strong wrath shatter the strength of our foemen, the sword of their strength and the shield; As vapours in heaven, or as waves or the wrecks of ships, So break thou the ranks of their spears with the breath of thy lips, Till their corpses have covered and clothed as with raiment the face of the sword-ploughed field. [Str. 6. O son of the rose-red morning, O God twin-born with the day, O wind with the young sun waking, and winged for the same wide way, Give up not the house of thy kin to the host thou hast marshalled from northward for prey. [Ant. 6. From the cold of thy cradle in Thrace, from the mists of the fountains of night, From the bride-bed of dawn whence day leaps laughing, on fire for his flight, Come down with their doom in thine hand on the ships thou hast brought up against us to fight. [Str. 7. For now not in word but in deed is the harvest of spears begun, And its clamour outbellows the thunder, its lightning outlightens the sun. From the springs of the morning it thunders and lightens across and afar To the wave where the moonset ends and the fall of the last low star. With a trampling of drenched red hoofs and an earth quake of men that meet, Strong war sets hand to the scythe, and the furrows take fire from his feet. Earth groans from her great rent heart, and the hollows of rocks are afraid, And the mountains are moved, and the valleys as waves in a storm-wind swayed. From the roots of the hills to the plain's dim verge and the dark loud shore, Air shudders with shrill spears crossing, and hurtling of wheels that roar. As the grinding of teeth in the jaws of a lion that foam as they gnash Is the shriek of the axles that loosen, the shock of the poles that crash. The dense manes darken and glitter, the mouths of the mad steeds champ, Their heads flash blind through the battle, and death's foot rings in their tramp. For a fourfold host upon earth and in heaven is arrayed for the fight, Clouds ruining in thunder and armies encountering as clouds in the night. Mine ears are amazed with the terror of trumpets, with darkness mine eyes, At the sound of the sea's host charging that deafens the roar of the sky's. White frontlet is dashed upon frontlet, and horse against horse reels hurled, And the gorge of the gulfs of the battle is wide for the spoil of the world. [Ant. 7. And the meadows are cumbered with shipwreck of chariots that founder on land, And the horsemen are broken with breach as of breakers, and scattered as sand. Through the roar and recoil of the charges that mingle their cries and confound, Like fire are the notes of the trumpets that flash through the darkness of sound. As the swing of the sea churned yellow that sways with the wind as it swells Is the lift and relapse of the wave of the chargers that clash with their bells; And the clang of the sharp shrill brass through the burst of the wave as it shocks Rings clean as the clear wind's cry through the roar of the surge on the rocks: And the heads of the steeds in their headgear of war, and their corsleted breasts, Gleam broad as the brows of the billows that brighten the storm with their crests, Gleam dread as their bosoms that heave to the shipwrecking wind as they rise, Filled full of the terror and thunder of water, that slays as it dies. So dire is the glare of their foreheads, so fearful the fire of their breath, And the light of their eyeballs enkindled so bright with the lightnings of death; And the foam of their mouths as the sea's when the jaws of its gulf are as graves, And the ridge of their necks as the wind-shaken mane on the ridges of waves: And their fetlocks afire as they rear drip thick with a dewfall of blood As the lips of the rearing breaker with froth of the manslaying flood. And the whole plain reels and resounds as the fields of the sea by night When the stroke of the wind falls darkling, and death is the seafarer's light. [Epode. But thou, fair beauty of heaven, dear face of the day nigh dead, What horror hath hidden thy glory, what hand hath muffled thine head? O sun, with what song shall we call thee, or ward off thy wrath by what name, With what prayer shall we seek to thee, soothe with what incense, assuage with what gift, If thy light be such only as lightens to deathward the seaman adrift With the fire of his house for a beacon, that foemen have wasted with flame? Arise now, lift up thy light; give ear to us, put forth thine hand, Reach toward us thy torch of deliverance, a lamp for the night of the land. Thine eye is the light of the living, no lamp for the dead; O, lift up the light of thine eye on the dark of our dread. Who hath blinded thee? who hath prevailed on thee? who hath ensnared? Who hath broken thy bow, and the shafts for thy battle prepared? Have they found out a fetter to bind thee, a chain for thine arm that was bared? Be the name of thy conqueror set forth, and the might of thy master declared. O God, fair God of the morning, O glory of day, What ails thee to cast from thy forehead its garland away? To pluck from thy temples their chaplet enwreathed of the light, And bind on the brows of thy godhead a frontlet of night? Thou hast loosened the necks of thine horses, and goaded their flanks with affright, To the race of a course that we know not on ways that are hid from our sight. As a wind through the darkness the wheels of their chariot are whirled, And the light of its passage is night on the face of the world. And there falls from the wings of thy glory no help from on high, But a shadow that smites us with fear and desire of thine eye. For our hearts are as reeds that a wind on the water bows down and goes by, To behold not thy comfort in heaven that hath left us untimely to die. But what light is it now leaps forth on the land Enkindling the waters and ways of the air From thy forehead made bare, From the gleam of thy bow-bearing hand? Hast thou set not thy right hand again to the string, With the back-bowed horns bent sharp for a spring And the barbed shaft drawn, Till the shrill steel sing and the tense nerve ring That pierces the heart of the dark with dawn, O huntsman, O king, When the flame of thy face hath twilight in chase As a hound hath a blood-mottled fawn? He has glanced into golden the grey sea-strands, And the clouds are shot through with the fires of his hands, And the height of the hollow of heaven that he fills As the heart of a strong man is quickened and thrills; High over the folds of the low-lying lands, On the shadowless hills As a guard on his watchtower he stands. All earth and all ocean, all depth and all height, At the flash of an eyebeam are filled with his might: The sea roars backward, the storm drops dumb, And silence as dew on the fire of the fight Falls kind in our ears as his face in our sight With presage of peace to come. Fresh hope in my heart from the ashes of dread Leaps clear as a flame from the pyres of the dead, That joy out of woe May arise as the spring out of tempest and snow, With the flower-feasted month in her hands rose-red Borne soft as a babe from the bearing-bed. Yet it knows not indeed if a God be friend, If rescue may be from the rage of the sea, Or the wrath of its lord have end. For the season is full now of death or of birth, To bring forth life, or an end of all; And we know not if anything stand or fall That is girdled about with the round sea's girth As a town with its wall; But thou that art highest of the Gods most high, That art lord if we live, that art lord though we die, Have heed of the tongues of our terror that cry For a grace to the children of Earth. ATHENIAN HERALD Sons of Athens, heavy-laden with the holy weight of years, Be your hearts as young men's lightened of their loathlier load of fears; For the wave is sunk whose thunder shoreward shook the shuddering lands, And unbreached of warring waters Athens like a sea-rock stands. CHORUS Well thy word has cheered us, well thy face and glittering eyes, that spake Ere thy tongue spake words of comfort: yet no pause behoves it make Till the whole good hap find utterance that the Gods have given at length. ATHENIAN HERALD All is this, that yet the city stands unforced by stranger strength. CHORUS Sweeter sound might no mouth utter in man's ear than this thy word. ATHENIAN HERALD Feed thy soul then full of sweetness till some bitterer note be heard. CHORUS None, if this ring sure, can mar the music fallen from heaven as rain. ATHENIAN HERALD If no fire of sun or star untimely sear the tender grain. CHORUS Fresh the dewfall of thy tidings on our hopes reflowering lies. ATHENIAN HERALD Till a joyless shower and fruitless blight them, raining from thine eyes. CHORUS Bitter springs have barren issues; these bedew grief's arid sands. ATHENIAN HERALD Such thank-offerings ask such altars as expect thy suppliant hands. CHORUS Tears for triumph, wail for welfare, what strange godhead's shrine requires? ATHENIAN HERALD Death's or victory's be it, a funeral torch feeds all its festal fires. CHORUS Like a star should burn the beacon flaming from our city's head. ATHENIAN HERALD Like a balefire should the flame go up that says the king is dead. CHORUS Out of heaven, a wild-haired meteor, shoots this new sign, scattering fear. ATHENIAN HERALD Yea, the word has wings of fire that hovered, loth to burn thine ear. CHORUS From thy lips it leapt forth loosened on a shrill and shadowy wing. ATHENIAN HERALD Long they faltered, fain to hide it deep as death that hides the king. CHORUS Dead with him blind hope lies blasted by the lightning of one sword. ATHENIAN HERALD On thy tongue truth wars with error; no man's edge hath touched thy lord. CHORUS False was thine then, jangling menace like a war-steed's brow-bound bell? ATHENIAN HERALD False it rang not joy nor sorrow; but by no man's hand he fell. CHORUS Vainly then good news and evil through so faint a trumpet spake. ATHENIAN HERALD All too long thy soul yet labours, as who sleeping fain would wake, Waking, fain would fall on sleep again; the woe thou knowest not yet, When thou knowest, shall make thy memory thirst and hunger to forget. CHORUS Long my heart has hearkened, hanging on thy clamorous ominous cry, Fain yet fearful of the knowledge whence it looks to live or die; Now to take the perfect presage of thy dark and sidelong flight Comes a surer soothsayer sorrowing, sable-stoled as birds of night. PRAXITHEA Man, what thy mother bare thee born to say Speak; for no word yet wavering on thy lip Can wound me worse than thought forestalls or fear. ATHENIAN HERALD I have no will to weave too fine or far, O queen, the weft of sweet with bitter speech, Bright words with darkling; but the brief truth shown Shall plead my pardon for a lingering tongue, Loth yet to strike hope through the heart and slay. The sun's light still was lordly housed in heaven When the twain fronts of war encountering smote First fire out of the battle; but not long Had the fresh wave of windy fight begun Heaving, and all the surge of swords to sway, When timeless night laid hold of heaven, and took With its great gorge the noon as in a gulf, Strangled; and thicker than the shrill-winged shafts Flew the fleet lightnings, held in chase through heaven By headlong heat of thunders on their trail Loosed as on quest of quarry; that our host Smit with sick presage of some wrathful God Quailed, but the foe as from one iron throat With one great sheer sole thousand-throated cry Shook earth, heart-staggered from their shout, and clove The eyeless hollow of heaven; and breached therewith As with an onset of strength-shattering sound The rent vault of the roaring noon of night From her throned seat of usurpation rang Reverberate answer; such response there pealed As though the tide's charge of a storming sea Had burst the sky's wall, and made broad a breach In the ambient girth and bastion flanked with stars Guarding the fortress of the Gods, and all Crashed now together on ruin; and through that cry And higher above it ceasing one man's note Tore its way like a trumpet: Charge, make end, Charge, halt not, strike, rend up their strength by the roots, Strike, break them, make your birthright's promise sure, Show your hearts hardier than the fenced land breeds And souls breathed in you from no spirit of earth, Sons of the sea's waves; and all ears that heard Rang with that fiery cry, that the fine air Thereat was fired, and kindling filled the plain Full of that fierce and trumpet-quenching breath That spake the clarions silent; no glad song For folk to hear that wist how dire a God Begat this peril to them, what strong race Fathered the sea-born tongue that sang them death, Threatening; so raged through the red foam of fight Poseidon's son Eumolpus; and the war Quailed round him coming, and our side bore back, As a stream thwarted by the wind and sea That meet it midway mouth to mouth, and beat The flood back of its issue; but the king Shouted against them, crying, O Father-God, Source of the God my father, from thine hand Send me what end seems good now in thy sight, But death from mine to this man; and the word Quick on his lips yet like a blast of fire Blew them together; and round its lords that met Paused all the reeling battle; two main waves Meeting, one hurled sheer from the sea-wall back That shocks it sideways, one right in from sea Charging, that full in face takes at one blow That whole recoil and ruin, with less fear Startle men's eyes late shipwrecked; for a breath, Crest fronting crest hung, wave to wave rose poised, Then clashed, breaker to breaker; cloud with cloud In heaven, chariot with chariot closed on earth, One fourfold flash and thunder; yet a breath, And with the king's spear through his red heart's root Driven, like a rock split from its hill-side, fell Hurled under his own horsehoofs dead on earth The sea-beast that made war on earth from sea, Dumb, with no shrill note left of storming song, Eumolpus; and his whole host with one stroke Spear-stricken through its dense deep iron heart Fell hurtling from us, and in fierce recoil Drew seaward as with one wide wail of waves, Resorbed with reluctation; such a groan Rose from the fluctuant refluence of its ranks, Sucked sullen back and strengthless; but scarce yet The steeds had sprung and wheels had bruised their lord Fallen, when from highest height of the sundering heaven The Father for his brother's son's sake slain Sent a sheer shaft of lightning writhen and smote Right on his son's son's forehead, that unhelmed Shone like the star that shines down storm, and gave Light to men's eyes that saw thy lord their king Stand and take breath from battle; then too soon Saw sink down as a sunset in sea-mist The high bright head that here in van of the earth Rose like a headland, and through storm and night Took all the sea's wrath on it; and now dead They bring thee back by war-forsaken ways The strength called once thy husband, the great guard That was of all men, stay of all men's lives, They bear him slain of no man but a God, Godlike; and toward him dead the city's gates Fling their arms open mother-like, through him Saved; and the whole clear land is purged of war What wilt thou say now of this weal and woe? PRAXITHEA I praise the Gods for Athens. O sweet Earth, Mother, what joy thy soul has of thy son, Thy life of my dead lord, mine own soul knows That knows thee godlike; and what grief should mine, What sorrow should my heart have, who behold Thee made so heavenlike happy? This alone I only of all these blessed, all thy kind, Crave this for blessing to me, that in theirs Have but a part thus bitter; give me too Death, and the sight of eyes that meet not mine. And thee too from no godless heart or tongue Reproachful, thee too by thy living name, Father divine, merciful God, I call, Spring of my life-springs, fountain of my stream, Pure and poured forth to one great end with thine, Sweet head sublime of triumph and these tears, Cephisus, if thou seest as gladly shed Thy blood in mine as thine own waves are given To do this great land good, to give for love The same lips drink and comfort the same hearts, Do thou then, O my father, white-souled God, To thy most pure earth-hallowing heart eterne Take what thou gavest to be given for these, Take thy child to thee; for her time is full, For all she hath borne she hath given, seen all she had Flow from her, from her eyes and breasts and hands Flow forth to feed this people; but be thou, Dear God and gracious to all souls alive, Good to thine own seed also; let me sleep, Father; my sleepless darkling day is done, My day of life like night, but slumberless: For all my fresh fair springs, and his that ran In one stream's bed with mine, are all run out Into the deep of death. The Gods have saved Athens; my blood has bought her at their hand, And ye sit safe; be glorious and be glad As now for all time always, countrymen, And love my dead for ever; but me, me, What shall man give for these so good as death? CHORUS [Str. 1. From the cup of my heart I pour through my lips along The mingled wine of a joyful and sorrowful song; Wine sweeter than honey and bitterer than blood that is poured From the chalice of gold, from the point of the two-edged sword. For the city redeemed should joy flow forth as a flood, And a dirge make moan for the city polluted with blood. [Ant. 1. Great praise should the Gods have surely, my country, of thee, Were thy brow but as white as of old for thy sons to see, Were thy hands as bloodless, as blameless thy cheek divine; But a stain on it stands of the life-blood offered for thine. What thanks shall we give that are mixed not and marred with dread For the price that has ransomed thine own with thine own child's head? [Str. 2. For a taint there cleaves to the people redeemed with blood, And a plague to the blood-red hand. The rain shall not cleanse it, the dew nor the sacred flood That blesses the glad live land. [Ant. 2. In the darkness of earth beneath, in the world without sun, The shadows of past things reign; And a cry goes up from the ghost of an ill deed done, And a curse for a virgin slain. ATHENA Hear, men that mourn, and woman without mate, Hearken; ye sick of soul with fear, and thou Dumb-stricken for thy children; hear ye too, Earth, and the glory of heaven, and winds of the air, And the most holy heart of the deep sea, Late wrath, now full of quiet; hear thou, sun, Rolled round with the upper fire of rolling heaven And all the stars returning; hills and streams, Springs and fresh fountains, day that seest these deeds, Night that shalt hide not; and thou child of mine, Child of a maiden, by a maid redeemed, Blood-guiltless, though bought back with innocent blood, City mine own; I Pallas bring thee word, I virgin daughter of the most high God Give all you charge and lay command on all The word I bring be wasted not; for this The Gods have stablished and his soul hath sworn, That time nor earth nor changing sons of man Nor waves of generations, nor the winds Of ages risen and fallen that steer their tides Through light and dark of birth and lovelier death From storm toward haven inviolable, shall see So great a light alive beneath the sun As the awless eye of Athens; all fame else Shall be to her fame as a shadow in sleep To this wide noon at waking; men most praised In lands most happy for their children found Shall hold as highest of honours given of God To be but likened to the least of thine, Thy least of all, my city; thine shall be The crown of all songs sung, of all deeds done Thine the full flower for all time; in thine hand Shall time be like a sceptre and thine head Wear worship for a garland; nor one leaf Shall change or winter cast out of thy crown Till all flowers wither in the world; thine eyes Shall first in man's flash lightning liberty, Thy tongue shall first say freedom; thy first hand Shall loose the thunder terror as a hound To hunt from sunset to the springs of the sun Kings that rose up out of the populous east To make their quarry of thee, and shall strew With multitudinous limbs of myriad herds The foodless pastures of the sea, and make With wrecks immeasurable and unsummed defeat One ruin of all their many-folded flocks Ill shepherded from Asia; by thy side Shall fight thy son the north wind, and the sea That was thine enemy shall be sworn thy friend And hand be struck in hand of his and thine To hold faith fast for aye; with thee, though each Make war on other, wind and sea shall keep Peace, and take truce as brethren for thy sake Leagued with one spirit and single-hearted strength To break thy foes in pieces, who shall meet The wind's whole soul and might of the main sea Full in their face of battle, and become A laughter to thee; like a shower of leaves Shall their long galleys rank by staggering rank Be dashed adrift on ruin, and in thy sight The sea deride them, and that lord of the air Who took by violent hand thy child to wife With his loud lips bemock them, by his breath Swept out of sight of being; so great a grace Shall this day give thee, that makes one in heart With mine the deep sea's godhead, and his son With him that was thine helmsman, king with king, Dead man with dead; such only names as these Shalt thou call royal, take none else or less To hold of men in honour; but with me Shall these be worshipped as one God, and mix With mine the might of their mysterious names In one same shrine served singly, thence to keep Perpetual guard on Athens; time and change, Masters and lords of all men, shall be made To thee that knowest no master and no lord Servants; the days that lighten heaven and nights That darken shall be ministers of thine To attend upon thy glory, the great years As light-engraven letters of thy name Writ by the sun's hand on the front of the earth For world-beholden witness; such a gift For one fair chaplet of three lives enwreathed To hang for ever from thy storied shrine, And this thy steersman fallen with tiller in hand To stand for ever at thy ship's helm seen, Shall he that bade their threefold flower be shorn And laid him low that planted, give thee back In sign of sweet land reconciled with sea And heavenlike earth with heaven; such promise-pledge I daughter without mother born of God To the most woful mother born of man Plight for continual comfort. Hail, and live Beyond all human hap of mortal doom Happy; for so my sire hath sworn and I. PRAXITHEA O queen Athena, from a heart made whole Take as thou givest us blessing; never tear Shall stain for shame nor groan untune the song That as a bird shall spread and fold its wings Here in thy praise for ever, and fulfil The whole world's crowning city crowned with thee As the sun's eye fulfils and crowns with sight The circling crown of heaven. There is no grief Great as the joy to be made one in will With him that is the heart and rule of life And thee, God born of God; thy name is ours, And thy large grace more great than our desire. CHORUS From the depth of the springs of my spirit a fountain is poured of thanksgiving, My country, my mother, for thee, That thy dead for their death shall have life in thy sight and a name everliving At heart of thy people to be. In the darkness of change on the waters of time they shall turn from afar To the beam of this dawn for a beacon, the light of these pyres for a star. They shall see thee who love and take comfort, who hate thee shall see and take warning, Our mother that makest us free; And the sons of thine earth shall have help of the waves that made war on their morning, And friendship and fame of the sea.</field>

Landor. DEDICATION TO MRS. LYNN LINTON Daughter in spirit elect and consecrate By love and reverence of the Olympian sire Whom I too loved and worshipped, seeing so great, And found so gracious toward my long desire To bid that love in song before his gate Sound, and my lute be loyal to his lyre, To none save one it now may dedicate Song's new burnt-offering on a century's pyre. And though the gift be light As ashes in men's sight, Left by the flame of no ethereal fire, Yet, for his worthier sake Than words are worthless, take This wreath of words ere yet their hour expire: So, haply, from some heaven above, He, seeing, may set next yours my sacrifice of love. May 24, 1880. 1 Five years beyond an hundred years have seen Their winters, white as faith's and age's hue, Melt, smiling through brief tears that broke between, And hope's young conquering colours reared anew, Since, on the day whose edge for kings made keen Smote sharper once than ever storm-wind blew, A head predestined for the girdling green That laughs at lightning all the seasons through, Nor frost or change can sunder Its crown untouched of thunder, Leaf from least leaf of all its leaves that grew Alone for brows too bold For storm to sear of old, Elect to shine in time's eternal view, Rose on the verge of radiant life Between the winds and sunbeams mingling love with strife. 2 The darkling day that gave its bloodred birth To Milton's white republic undefiled That might endure so few fleet years on earth Bore in him likewise as divine a child; But born not less for crowns of love and mirth, Of palm and myrtle passionate and mild, The leaf that girds about with gentler girth The brow steel-bound in battle, and the wild Soft spray that flowers above The flower-soft hair of love; And the white lips of wayworn winter smiled And grew serene as spring's When with stretched clouds like wings Or wings like drift of snow-clouds massed and piled The godlike giant, softening, spread A shadow of stormy shelter round the new-born head. 3 And o'er it brightening bowed the wild-haired hour, And touched his tongue with honey and with fire, And breathed between his lips the note of power That makes of all the winds of heaven a lyre Whose strings are stretched from topmost peaks that tower To softest springs of waters that suspire, With sounds too dim to shake the lowliest flower Breathless with hope and dauntless with desire: And bright before his face That Hour became a Grace, As in the light of their Athenian quire When the Hours before the sun And Graces were made one, Called by sweet Love down from the aerial gyre By one dear name of natural joy, To bear on her bright breast from heaven a heaven-born boy. 4 Ere light could kiss the little lids in sunder Or love could lift them for the sun to smite, His fiery birth-star as a sign of wonder Had risen, perplexing the presageful night With shadow and glory around her sphere and under And portents prophesying by sound and sight; And half the sound was song and half was thunder, And half his life of lightning, half of light: And in the soft clenched hand Shone like a burning brand A shadowy sword for swordless fields of fight, Wrought only for such lord As so may wield the sword That all things ill be put to fear and flight Even at the flash and sweep and gleam Of one swift stroke beheld but in a shuddering dream. 5 Like the sun's rays that blind the night's wild beasts The sword of song shines as the swordsman sings; From the west wind's verge even to the arduous east's The splendour of the shadow that it flings Makes fire and storm in heaven above the feasts Of men fulfilled with food of evil things; Strikes dumb the lying and hungering lips of priests, Smites dead the slaying and ravening hands of kings; Turns dark the lamp's hot light, And turns the darkness bright As with the shadow of dawn's reverberate wings; And far before its way Heaven, yearning toward the day, Shines with its thunder and round its lightning rings; And never hand yet earlier played With that keen sword whose hilt is cloud, and fire its blade. 6 See note to the Imaginary Conversation of Leofric and Godiva for the exquisite first verses extant from the hand of Landor. As dropping flakes of honey-heavy dew More soft than slumber's, fell the first note's sound From strings the swift young hand strayed lightlier through Than leaves through calm air wheeling toward the ground Stray down the drifting wind when skies are blue Nor yet the wings of latter winds unbound, Ere winter loosen all the Æolian crew With storm unleashed behind them like a hound. As lightly rose and sank Beside a green-flowered bank The clear first notes his burning boyhood found To sing her sacred praise Who rode her city's ways Clothed with bright hair and with high purpose crowned; A song of soft presageful breath, Prefiguring all his love and faith in life and death; 7 Who should love two things only and only praise More than all else for ever: even the glory Of goodly beauty in women, whence all days Take light whereby death's self seems transitory; And loftier love than loveliest eyes can raise, Love that wipes off the miry stains and gory From Time's worn feet, besmirched on bloodred ways, And lightens with his light the night of story; Love that lifts up from dust Life, and makes darkness just, And purges as with fire of purgatory The dense disastrous air, To burn old falsehood bare And give the wind its ashes heaped and hoary; Love, that with eyes of ageless youth Sees on the breast of Freedom borne her nursling Truth. 8 For at his birth the sistering stars were one That flamed upon it as one fiery star; Freedom, whose light makes pale the mounting sun, And Song, whose fires are quenched when Freedom's are. Of all that love not liberty let none Love her that fills our lips with fire from far To mix with winds and seas in unison And sound athwart life's tideless harbour-bar Out where our songs fly free Across time's bounded sea, A boundless flight beyond the dim sun's car, Till all the spheres of night Chime concord round their flight Too loud for blasts of warring change to mar, From stars that sang for Homer's birth To these that gave our Landor welcome back from earth. 9 Shine, as above his cradle, on his grave, Stars of our worship, lights of our desire! For never man that heard the world's wind rave To you was truer in trust of heart and lyre: Nor Greece nor England on a brow more brave Beheld your flame against the wind burn higher: Nor all the gusts that blanch life's worldly wave With surf and surge could quench its flawless fire: No blast of all that blow Might bid the torch burn low That lightens on us yet as o'er his pyre, Indomitable of storm, That now no flaws deform Nor thwart winds baffle ere it all aspire, One light of godlike breath and flame, To write on heaven with man's most glorious names his name. 10 The Poems of Walter Savage Landor: 1795. Moral Epistle, respectfully dedicated to Earl Stanhope: 1795. Gebir. The very dawn was dashed with stormy dew And freaked with fire as when God's hand would mar Palaces reared of tyrants, and the blue Deep heaven was kindled round her thunderous car, That saw how swift a gathering glory grew About him risen, ere clouds could blind or bar A splendour strong to burn and burst them through And mix in one sheer light things near and far. First flew before his path Light shafts of love and wrath, But winged and edged as elder warriors' are; Then rose a light that showed Across the midsea road From radiant Calpe to revealed Masar The way of war and love and fate Between the goals of fear and fortune, hope and hate. 11 Mine own twice banished fathers' harbour-land, Their nursing-mother France, the well-beloved, By the arduous blast of sanguine sunrise fanned, Flamed on him, and his burning lips were moved As that live statue's throned on Lybian sand When morning moves it, ere her light faith roved From promise, and her tyrant's poisonous hand Fed hope with Corsic honey till she proved More deadly than despair And falser even than fair, Though fairer than all elder hopes removed As landmarks by the crime Of inundating time; Light faith by grief too loud too long reproved: For even as in some darkling dance Wronged love changed hands with hate, and turned his heart from France. 12 But past the snows and summits Pyrenean Love stronger-winged held more prevailing flight That o'er Tyrrhene, Iberian, and Ægean Shores lightened with one storm of sound and light. From earliest even to hoariest years one pæan Rang rapture through the fluctuant roar of fight, From Nestor's tongue in accents Achillean On death's blind verge dominant over night. For voice as hand and hand As voice for one fair land Rose radiant, smote sonorous, past the height Where darkling pines enrobe The steel-cold Lake of Gaube, Deep as dark death and keen as death to smite, To where on peak or moor or plain His heart and song and sword were one to strike for Spain. 13 Count Julian: Ines de Castro: Ippolito di Este. Resurgent at his lifted voice and hand Pale in the light of war or treacherous fate Song bade before him all their shadows stand For whom his will unbarred their funeral grate. The father by whose wrong revenged his land Was given for sword and fire to desolate Rose fire-encircled as a burning brand, Great as the woes he wrought and bore were great. Fair as she smiled and died, Death's crowned and breathless bride Smiled as one living even on craft and hate: And pity, a star unrisen, Scarce lit Ferrante's prison Ere night unnatural closed the natural gate That gave their life and love and light To those fair eyes despoiled by fratricide of sight. 14 Poems “on the Dead.” Tears bright and sweet as fire and incense fell In perfect notes of music-measured pain On veiled sweet heads that heard not love's farewell Sob through the song that bade them rise again; Rise in the light of living song, to dwell With memories crowned of memory: so the strain Made soft as heaven the stream that girdles hell And sweet the darkness of the breathless plain, And with Elysian flowers Recrowned the wreathless hours That mused and mourned upon their works in vain; For all their works of death Song filled with light and breath, And listening grief relaxed her lightening chain; For sweet as all the wide sweet south She found the song like honey from the lion's mouth. 15 Poems “on the Dead.” High from his throne in heaven Simonides, Crowned with mild aureole of memorial tears That the everlasting sun of all time sees All golden, molten from the forge of years, Smiled, as the gift was laid upon his knees Of songs that hang like pearls in mourners' ears Mild as the murmuring of Hymettian bees And honied as their harvest, that endears The toil of flowery days; And smiling perfect praise Hailed his one brother mateless else of peers: Whom we that hear not him For length of date grown dim Hear, and the heart grows glad of grief that hears; And harshest heights of sorrowing hours, Like snows of Alpine April, melt from tears to flowers. 16 Imaginary Conversations: Lord Brooke and Sir Philip Sidney. Therefore to him the shadow of death was none, The darkness was not, nor the temporal tomb: And multitudinous time for him was one, Who bade before his equal seat of doom Rise and stand up for judgment in the sun The weavers of the world's large-historied loom, By their own works of light or darkness done Clothed round with light or girt about with gloom. In speech of purer gold Than even they spake of old He bade the breath of Sidney's lips relume The fire of thought and love That made his bright life move Through fair brief seasons of benignant bloom To blameless music ever, strong As death and sweet as death-annihilating song. 17 Idyllia Nova Quinque Heroum atque Heroidum (1815): Corythus; Dryope; Pan et Pitys; Coresus et Callirrhoë; Helena ad Pudoris Aram. Thought gave his wings the width of time to roam, Love gave his thought strength equal to release From bonds of old forgetful years, like foam Vanished, the fame of memories that decrease; So strongly faith had fledged for flight from home The soul's large pinions till her strife should cease: And through the trumpet of a child of Rome Rang the pure music of the flutes of Greece. As though some northern hand Reft from the Latin land A spoil more costly than the Colchian fleece To clothe with golden sound Of old joy newly found And rapture as of penetrating peace The naked north-wind's cloudiest clime, And give its darkness light of the old Sicilian time. 18 Idyllia Nova Quinque Heroum atque Heroidum (1815): Corythus; Dryope; Pan et Pitys; Coresus et Callirrhoë; Helena ad Pudoris Aram. He saw the brand that fired the towers of Troy Fade, and the darkness at Œnone's prayer Close upon her that closed upon her boy, For all the curse of godhead that she bare; And the Apollonian serpent gleam and toy With scathless maiden limbs and shuddering hair; And his love smitten in their dawn of joy Leave Pan the pine-leaf of her change to wear; And one in flowery coils Caught as in fiery toils Smite Calydon with mourning unaware; And where her low turf shrine Showed Modesty divine The fairest mother's daughter far more fair Hide on her breast the heavenly shame That kindled once with love should kindle Troy with flame. 19 Imaginary Conversations: Oliver Cromwell and Walter Noble; Æschines and Phocion; Kosciusko and Poniatowski; Milton and Marvell; Roger Ascham and Lady Jane Grey; Tiberius and Vipsania. Nor less the light of story than of song With graver glories girt his godlike head, Reverted alway from the temporal throng Of lives that live not toward the living dead. The shadows and the splendours of their throng Made bright and dark about his board and bed The lines of life and vision, sweet or strong With sound of lutes or trumpets blown, that led Forth of the ghostly gate Opening in spite of fate Shapes of majestic or tumultuous tread, Divine and direful things, These foul as priests or kings, Those fair as heaven or love or freedom, red With blood and green with palms and white With raiment woven of deeds divine and words of light. 20 Imaginary Conversations: Oliver Cromwell and Walter Noble; Æschines and Phocion; Kosciusko and Poniatowski; Milton and Marvell; Roger Ascham and Lady Jane Grey; Tiberius and Vipsania. The thunder-fire of Cromwell, and the ray That keeps the place of Phocion's name serene And clears the cloud from Kosciusko's day, Alternate as dark hours with bright between, Met in the heaven of his high thought, which lay For all stars open that all eyes had seen Rise on the night or twilight of the way Where feet of human hopes and fears had been. Again the sovereign word On Milton's lips was heard Living: again the tender three days' queen Drew bright and gentle breath On the sharp edge of death: And, staged again to show of mortal scene, Tiberius, ere his name grew dire, Wept, stainless yet of empire, tears of blood and fire. 21 Hellenics: To Corinth. Most ardent and most awful and most fond, The fervour of his Apollonian eye Yearned upon Hellas, yet enthralled in bond Of time whose years beheld her and past by Silent and shameful, till she rose and donned The casque again of Pallas; for her cry Forth of the past and future, depths beyond This where the present and its tyrants lie, As one great voice of twain For him had pealed again, Heard but of hearts high as her own was high, High as her own and his And pure as love's heart is, That lives though hope at once and memory die: And with her breath his clarion's blast Was filled as cloud with fire or future souls with past. 22 Hellenics: To Corinth. As a wave only obsequious to the wind Leaps to the lifting breeze that bids it leap, Large-hearted, and its thickening mane be thinned By the strong god's breath moving on the deep From utmost Atlas even to extremest Ind That shakes the plain where no men sow nor reap, So, moved with wrath toward men that ruled and sinned And pity toward all tears he saw men weep, Arose to take man's part His loving lion heart, Kind as the sun's that has in charge to keep Earth and the seed thereof Safe in his lordly love, Strong as sheer truth and soft as very sleep; The mightiest heart since Milton's leapt, The gentlest since the gentlest heart of Shakespeare slept. 23 Hellenics: To Corinth. Like the wind's own on her divided sea His song arose on Corinth, and aloud Recalled her Isthmian song and strife when she Was thronged with glories as with gods in crowd And as the wind's own spirit her breath was free And as the heaven's own heart her soul was proud, But freer and prouder stood no son than he Of all she bare before her heart was bowed; None higher than he who heard Medea's keen last word Transpierce her traitor, and like a rushing cloud That sundering shows a star Saw pass her thunderous car And a face whiter and deadlier than a shroud That lightened from it, and the brand Of tender blood that falling seared his suppliant hand. 24 Hellenics: Regeneration. More fair than all things born and slain of fate, More glorious than all births of days and nights, He bade the spirit of man regenerate, Rekindling, rise and reassume the rights That in high seasons of his old estate Clothed him and armed with majesties and mights Heroic, when the times and hearts were great And in the depths of ages rose the heights Radiant of high deeds done And souls that matched the sun For splendour with the lightnings of their lights Whence even their uttered names Burn like the strong twin flames Of song that shakes a throne and steel that smites; As on Thermopylæ when shone Leonidas, on Syracuse Timoleon. 25 The Hamadryad; Acon and Rhodope. Or, sweeter than the breathless buds when spring With smiles and tears and kisses bids them breathe, Fell with its music from his quiring string Fragrance of pine-leaves and odorous heath Twined round the lute whereto he sighed to sing Of the oak that screened and showed its maid beneath, Who seeing her bee crawl back with broken wing Faded, a fairer flower than all her wreath, And paler, though her oak Stood scathless of the stroke More sharp than edge of axe or wolfish teeth, That mixed with mortals dead Her own half heavenly head And life incorporate with a sylvan sheath, And left the wild rose and the dove A secret place and sacred from all guests but Love. 26 The Shades of Agamemnon and Iphigeneia. But in the sweet clear fields beyond the river Dividing pain from peace and man from shade He saw the wings that there no longer quiver Sink of the hours whose parting footfalls fade On ears which hear the rustling amaranth shiver With sweeter sound of wind than ever made Music on earth: departing, they deliver The soul that shame or wrath or sorrow swayed; And round the king of men Clash the clear arms again, Clear of all soil and bright as laurel braid, That rang less high for joy Through the gates fallen of Troy Than here to hail the sacrificial maid, Iphigeneia, when the ford Fast-flowing of sorrows brought her father and their lord. 27 Enallos and Cymodameia. And in the clear gulf of the hollow sea He saw light glimmering through the grave green gloom That hardly gave the sun's eye leave to see Cymodameia; but nor tower nor tomb, No tower on earth, no tomb of waves may be, That may not sometime by diviner doom Be plain and pervious to the poet; he Bids time stand back from him and fate make room For passage of his feet, Strong as their own are fleet, And yield the prey no years may reassume Through all their clamorous track, Nor night nor day win back Nor give to darkness what his eyes illume And his lips bless for ever: he Knows what earth knows not, sings truth sung not of the sea. 28 The Children of Venus. Before the sentence of a curule chair More sacred than the Roman, rose and stood To take their several doom the imperial pair Diversely born of Venus, and in mood Diverse as their one mother, and as fair, Though like two stars contrasted, and as good, Though different as dark eyes from golden hair; One as that iron planet red like blood That bears among the stars Fierce witness of her Mars In bitter fire by her sweet light subdued; One in the gentler skies Sweet as her amorous eyes: One proud of worlds and seas and darkness rude Composed and conquered; one content With lightnings from loved eyes of lovers lightly sent. 29 Cupid and Pan. And where Alpheus and where Ladon ran Radiant, by many a rushy and rippling cove More known to glance of god than wandering man, He sang the strife of strengths divine that strove, Unequal, one with other, for a span, Who should be friends for ever in heaven above And here on pastoral earth: Arcadian Pan, And the awless lord of kings and shepherds, Love: All the sweet strife and strange With fervid counterchange Till one fierce wail through many a glade and grove Rang, and its breath made shiver The reeds of many a river, And the warm airs waxed wintry that it clove, Keen-edged as ice-retempered brand; Nor might god's hurt find healing save of godlike hand. 30 The Death of Clytemnestra; The Madness of Orestes; The Prayer of Orestes. As when the jarring gates of thunder ope Like earthquake felt in heaven, so dire a cry, So fearful and so fierce—“Give the sword scope!”— Rang from a daughter's lips, darkening the sky To the extreme azure of all its cloudless cope With starless horror: nor the God's own eye Whose doom bade smite, whose ordinance bade hope, Might well endure to see the adulteress die, The husband-slayer fordone By swordstroke of her son, Unutterable, unimaginable on high, On earth abhorrent, fell Beyond all scourge of hell, Yet righteous as redemption: Love stood nigh, Mute, sister-like, and closer clung Than all fierce forms of threatening coil and maddening tongue. 31 All these things heard and seen and sung of old, He heard and saw and sang them. Once again Might foot of man tread, eye of man behold Things unbeholden save of ancient men, Ways save by gods untrodden. In his hold The staff that stayed through some Ætnean glen The steps of the most highest, most awful-souled And mightiest-mouthed of singers, even as then Became a prophet's rod, A lyre on fire of God, Being still the staff of exile: yea, as when The voice poured forth on us Was even of Æschylus, And his one word great as the crying of ten, Crying in men's ears of wrath toward wrong, Of love toward right immortal, sanctified with song. 32 The Last of Ulysses. Him too whom none save one before him ever Beheld, nor since hath man again beholden, Whom Dante seeing him saw not, nor the giver Of all gifts back to man by time withholden, Shakespeare—him too, whom sea-like ages sever, As waves divide men's eyes from lights upholden To landward, from our songs that find him never, Seeking, though memory fire and hope embolden— Him too this one song found, And raised at its sole sound Up from the dust of darkling dreams and olden Legends forlorn of breath, Up from the deeps of death, Ulysses: him whose name turns all songs golden, The wise divine strong soul, whom fate Could make no less than change and chance beheld him great. 33 Imaginary Conversations: Lady Lisle and Elizabeth Gaunt. Nor stands the seer who raised him less august Before us, nor in judgment frail and rathe, Less constant or less loving or less just, But fruitful-ripe and full of tender faith, Holding all high and gentle names in trust Of time for honour; so his quickening breath Called from the darkness of their martyred dust Our sweet Saints Alice and Elizabeth, Revived and reinspired With speech from heavenward fired By love to say what Love the Archangel saith Only, nor may such word Save by such ears be heard As hear the tongues of angels after death Descending on them like a dove Has taken all earthly sense of thought away but love. 34 All sweet, all sacred, all heroic things, All generous names and loyal, and all wise, With all his heart in all its wayfarings He sought, and worshipped, seeing them with his eyes In very present glory, clothed with wings Of words and deeds and dreams immortal, rise Visible more than living slaves and kings, Audible more than actual vows and lies: These, with scorn's fieriest rod, These and the Lord their God, The Lord their likeness, tyrant of the skies As they Lord Gods of earth, These with a rage of mirth He mocked and scourged and spat on, in such wise That none might stand before his rod, And these being slain the Spirit alone be lord or God. 35 Pro monumento super milites regio jussu interemptos. For of all souls for all time glorious none Loved Freedom better, of all who have loved her best, Than he who wrote that scripture of the sun Writ as with fire and light on heaven's own crest, Of all words heard on earth the noblest one That ever spake for souls and left them blest: Gladly we should rest ever, had we won Freedom: we have lost, and very gladly rest. O poet hero, lord And father, we record Deep in the burning tablets of the breast Thankfully those divine And living words of thine For faith and comfort in our hearts imprest With strokes engraven past hurt of years And lines inured with fire of immemorial tears. 36 The Citation and Examination of William Shakespeare. But who being less than thou shall sing of thee Words worthy of more than pity or less than scorn? Who sing the golden garland woven of three, Thy daughters, Graces mightier than the morn, More godlike than the graven gods men see Made all but all immortal, human born And heavenly natured? With the first came He, Led by the living hand, who left forlorn Life by his death, and time More by his life sublime Than by the lives of all whom all men mourn, And even for mourning praise Heaven, as for all those days These dead men's lives clothed round with glories worn By memory till all time lie dead, And higher than all behold the bay round Shakespeare's head. 37 Pericles and Aspasia. Then, fairer than the fairest Grace of ours, Came girt with Grecian gold the second Grace, And verier daughter of his most perfect hours Than any of latter time or alien place Named, or with hair inwoven of English flowers Only, nor wearing on her statelier face The lordlier light of Athens. All the Powers That graced and guarded round that holiest race, That heavenliest and most high Time hath seen live and die, Poured all their power upon him to retrace The erased immortal roll Of Love's most sovereign scroll And Wisdom's warm from Freedom's wide embrace, The scroll that on Aspasia's knees Laid once made manifest the Olympian Pericles. 38 The Pentameron. Clothed on with tenderest weft of Tuscan air, Came laughing like Etrurian spring the third, With green Valdelsa's hill-flowers in her hair Deep-drenched with May-dews, in her voice the bird Whose voice hath night and morning in it; fair As the ambient gold of wall-flowers that engird The walls engirdling with a circling stair My sweet San Gimignano: nor a word Fell from her flowerlike mouth Not sweet with all the south; As though the dust shrined in Certaldo stirred And spake, as o'er it shone That bright Pentameron, And his own vines again and chestnuts heard Boccaccio: nor swift Elsa's chime Mixed not her golden babble with Petrarca's rhyme. 39 Imaginary Conversations: Epicurus, Leontion, and Ternissa. No lovelier laughed the garden which receives Yet, and yet hides not from our following eyes With soft rose-laurels and low strawberry-leaves, Ternissa, sweet as April-coloured skies, Bowed like a flowering reed when May's wind heaves The reed-bed that the stream kisses and sighs, In love that shrinks and murmurs and believes What yet the wisest of the starriest wise Whom Greece might ever hear Speaks in the gentlest ear That ever heard love's lips philosophize With such deep-reasoning words As blossoms use and birds, Nor heeds Leontion lingering till they rise Far off, in no wise over far, Beneath a heaven all amorous of its first-born star. 40 Marcellus and Hannibal: P. Scipio Æmilianus, Polybius, and Panætius. What sound, what storm and splendour of what fire, Darkening the light of heaven, lightening the night, Rings, rages, flashes round what ravening pyre That makes time's face pale with its reflex light And leaves on earth, who seeing might scarce respire, A shadow of red remembrance? Right nor might Alternating wore ever shapes more dire Nor manifest in all men's awful sight In form and face that wore Heaven's light and likeness more Than these, or held suspense mens hearts at height More fearful, since man first Slaked with man's blood his thirst, Than when Rome clashed with Hannibal in fight, Till tower on ruining tower was hurled Where Scipio stood, and Carthage was not in the world. 41 Alexander and Priest of Ammon: Bonaparte and the President of the Senate. Nor lacked there power of purpose in his hand Who carved their several praise in words of gold To bare the brows of conquerors and to brand, Made shelterless of laurels bought and sold For price of blood or incense, dust or sand, Triumph or terror. He that sought of old His father Ammon in a stranger's land, And shrank before the serpentining fold, Stood in our seer's wide eye No higher than man most high, And lowest in heart when highest in hope to hold Fast as a scripture furled The scroll of all the world Sealed with his signet: nor the blind and bold First thief of empire, round whose head Swarmed carrion flies for bees, on flesh for violets fed. Time, in his children's blood who takes delight.From the Greek of Landor. 42 The Empress Catherine and Princess Dashkoff. As fire that kisses, killing with a kiss, He saw the light of death, riotous and red, Flame round the bent brows of Semiramis Re-risen, and mightier, from the Assyrian dead, Kindling, as dawn a frost-bound precipice, The steely snows of Russia, for the tread Of feet that felt before them crawl and hiss The snaky lines of blood violently shed Like living creeping things That writhe but have no stings To scare adulterers from the imperial bed Bowed with its load of lust, Or chill the ravenous gust That made her body a fire from heel to head; Or change her high bright spirit and clear, For all its mortal stains, from taint of fraud or fear. 43 Vittoria Colonna and Michel-Angelo Buonarroti. As light that blesses, hallowing with a look, He saw the godhead in Vittoria's face Shine soft on Buonarroti's, till he took, Albeit himself God, a more godlike grace, A strength more heavenly to confront and brook All ill things coiled about his worldly race, From the bright scripture of that present book Wherein his tired grand eyes got power to trace Comfort more sweet than youth, And hope whose child was truth, And love that brought forth sorrow for a space, Only that she might bear Joy: these things, written there, Made even his soul's high heaven a heavenlier place, Perused with eyes whose glory and glow Had in their fires the spirit of Michael Angelo. 44 Andrea of Hungary, Giovanna of Naples, Fra Rupert; a Trilogy: Five Scenes (Beatrice Cenci). With balms and dews of blessing he consoled The fair fame wounded by the black priest's fang, Giovanna's, and washed off her blithe and bold Boy-bridegroom's blood, that seemed so long to hang On her fair hand, even till the stain of old Was cleansed with healing song, that after sang Sharp truth by sweetest singers' lips untold Of pale Beatrice, though her death-note rang From other strings divine Ere his rekindling line With yet more piteous and intolerant pang Pierced all men's hearts anew That heard her passion through Till fierce from throes of fiery pity sprang Wrath, armed for chase of monstrous beasts, Strong to lay waste the kingdom of the seed of priests. 45 Luther's Parents: The Death of Hofer: (Imaginary Conversations) Andrew Hofer, Count Metternich, and the Emperor Francis; Judge Wolfgang and Henry of Melchthal: The Coronation: Tyrannicide (The Last Fruit off an Old Tree): Walter Tyrrel and William Rufus: Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn. He knew the high-souled humbleness, the mirth And majesty of meanest men born free, That made with Luther's or with Hofer's birth The whole world worthier of the sun to see: The wealth of spirit among the snows, the dearth Wherein souls festered by the servile sea That saw the lowest of even crowned heads on earth Thronged round with worship in Parthenope. His hand bade Justice guide Her child Tyrannicide, Light winged by fire that brings the dawn to be; And pierced with Tyrrel's dart Again the riotous heart That mocked at mercy's tongue and manhood's knee: And oped the cell where kinglike death Hung o'er her brows discrowned who bare Elizabeth. 46 Essex and Spenser (Imaginary Conversations): Essex and Bacon: Antony and Octavius (Scenes for the Study). Toward Spenser or toward Bacon proud or kind He bared the heart of Essex, twain and one, For the base heart that soiled the starry mind Stern, for the father in his child undone Soft as his own toward children, stamped and signed With their sweet image visibly set on As by God's hand, clear as his own designed The likeness radiant out of ages gone That none may now destroy Of that high Roman boy Whom Julius and Cleopatra saw their son True-born of sovereign seed, Foredoomed even thence to bleed, The stately grace of bright Cæsarion, The head unbent, the heart unbowed, That not the shadow of death could make less clear and proud. 47 Critical Essays on Theocritus and Catullus. With gracious gods he communed, honouring thus At once by service and similitude, Service devout and worship emulous Of the same golden Muses once they wooed, The names and shades adored of all of us, The nurslings of the brave world's earlier brood, Grown gods for us themselves: Theocritus First, and more dear Catullus, names bedewed With blessings bright like tears From the old memorial years, And loves and lovely laughters, every mood Sweet as the drops that fell Of their own œnomel From living lips to cheer the multitude That feeds on words divine, and grows More worthy, seeing their world reblossom like a rose. 48 Heroic Idyls: Homer, Laertes, and Agatha. “J'en passe, et des meilleurs.” But who can enumerate all or half our obligations to the illimitable and inexhaustible genius of the great man whose life and whose labour lasted even from the generation of our fathers' fathers to our own? Hardly any reader can feel, I think, so deeply as I feel the inadequacy of my poor praise and too imperfect gratitude to the majestic subject of their attempted expression; but “such as I had have I given him.” Peace, the soft seal of long life's closing story, The silent music that no strange note jars, Crowned not with gentler hand the years that glory Crowned, but could hide not all the spiritual scars Time writes on the inward strengths of warriors hoary With much long warfare, and with gradual bars Blindly pent in: but these, being transitory, Broke, and the power came back that passion mars: And at the lovely last Above all anguish past Before his own the sightless eyes like stars Arose that watched arise Like stars in other skies Above the strife of ships and hurtling cars The Dioscurian songs divine That lighten all the world with lightning of their line. 49 Heroic Idyls: Homer, Laertes, and Agatha. “J'en passe, et des meilleurs.” But who can enumerate all or half our obligations to the illimitable and inexhaustible genius of the great man whose life and whose labour lasted even from the generation of our fathers' fathers to our own? Hardly any reader can feel, I think, so deeply as I feel the inadequacy of my poor praise and too imperfect gratitude to the majestic subject of their attempted expression; but “such as I had have I given him.” He sang the last of Homer, having sung The last of his Ulysses. Bright and wide For him time's dark strait ways, like clouds that clung About the day-star, doubtful to divide, Waxed in his spiritual eyeshot, and his tongue Spake as his soul bore witness, that descried, Like those twin towering lights in darkness hung, Homer, and grey Laertes at his side Kingly as kings are none Beneath a later sun, And the sweet maiden ministering in pride To sovereign and to sage In their more sweet old age: These things he sang, himself as old, and died. And if death be not, if life be, As Homer and as Milton are in heaven is he. 50 Poet whose large-eyed loyalty of love Was pure toward all high poets, all their kind And all bright words and all sweet works thereof; Strong like the sun, and like the sunlight kind; Heart that no fear but every grief might move Wherewith men's hearts were bound of powers that bind; The purest soul that ever proof could prove From taint of tortuous or of envious mind; Whose eyes elate and clear Nor shame nor ever fear But only pity or glorious wrath could blind; Name set for love apart, Held lifelong in my heart, Face like a father's toward my face inclined; No gifts like thine are mine to give, Who by thine own words only bid thee hail, and live. GRAND CHORUS OF BIRDS FROM ARISTOPHANES THE BIRDS (685–723) Attempted in English verse after the original metre I was allured into the audacity of this experiment by consideration of a fact which hitherto does not seem to have been taken into consideration by any translator of the half divine humourist in whose incomparable genius the highest qualities of Rabelais were fused and harmonized with the supremest gifts of Shelley: namely, that his marvellous metrical invention of the anapæstic heptameter was almost exactly reproducible in a language to which all variations and combinations of anapæstic, iambic, or trochaic metre are as natural and pliable as all dactylic and spondaic forms of verse are unnatural and abhorrent. As it happens, this highest central interlude of a most adorable masterpiece is as easy to detach from its dramatic setting, and even from its lyrical context, as it was easy to give line for line of it in English. In two metrical points only does my version vary from the verbal pattern of the original. I have of course added rhymes, and double rhymes, as necessary makeweights for the imperfection of an otherwise inadequate language; and equally of course I have not attempted the impossible and undesirable task of reproducing the rare exceptional effect of a line overcharged on purpose with a preponderance of heavy-footed spondees: and this for the obvious reason that even if such a line—which I doubt—could be exactly represented, foot by foot and pause for pause, in English, this English line would no more be a verse in any proper sense of the word than is the line I am writing at this moment. And my main intention, or at least my main desire, in the undertaking of this brief adventure, was to renew as far as possible for English ears the music of this resonant and triumphant metre, which goes ringing at full gallop as of horses who “dance as 'twere to the music Their own hoofs make.” I would not seem over curious in search of an apt or inapt quotation: but nothing can be fitter than a verse of Shakespeare's to praise at once and to describe the most typical verse of Aristophanes. Come on then, ye dwellers by nature in darkness, and like to the leaves' generations, That are little of might, that are moulded of mire, unenduring and shadowlike nations, Poor plumeless ephemerals, comfortless mortals, as visions of creatures fast fleeing, Lift up your mind unto us that are deathless, and dateless the date of our being: Us, children of heaven, us, ageless for aye, us, all of whose thoughts are eternal; That ye may from henceforth, having heard of us all things aright as to matters supernal, Of the being of birds and beginning of gods, and of streams, and the dark beyond reaching, Truthfully knowing aright, in my name bid Prodicus pack with his preaching. It was Chaos and Night at the first, and the blackness of darkness, and hell's broad border, Earth was not, nor air, neither heaven; when in depths of the womb of the dark without order First thing first-born of the black-plumed Night was a wind-egg hatched in her bosom, Whence timely with seasons revolving again sweet Love burst out as a blossom, Gold wings glittering forth of his back, like whirlwinds gustily turning. He, after his wedlock with Chaos, whose wings are of darkness, in hell broad-burning, For his nestlings begat him the race of us first, and upraised us to light new-lighted. And before this was not the race of the gods, until all things by Love were united; And of kind united with kind in communion of nature the sky and the sea are Brought forth, and the earth, and the race of the gods everlasting and blest. So that we are Far away the most ancient of all things blest. And that we are of Love's generation There are manifest manifold signs. We have wings, and with us have the Loves habitation; And manifold fair young folk that forswore love once, ere the bloom of them ended, Have the men that pursued and desired them subdued, by the help of us only befriended, With such baits as a quail, a flamingo, a goose, or a cock's comb staring and splendid. All best good things that befall men come from us birds, as is plain to all reason: For first we proclaim and make known to them spring, and the winter and autumn in season; Bid sow, when the crane starts clanging for Afric, in shrill-voiced emigrant number, And calls to the pilot to hang up his rudder again for the season, and slumber; And then weave cloak for Orestes the thief, lest he strip men of theirs if it freezes. And again thereafter the kite reappearing announces a change in the breezes, And that here is the season for shearing your sheep of their spring wool. Then does the swallow Give you notice to sell your greatcoat, and provide something light for the heat that's to follow. Thus are we as Ammon or Delphi unto you, Dodona, nay, Phœbus Apollo. For, as first ye come all to get auguries of birds, even such is in all things your carriage, Be the matter a matter of trade, or of earning your bread, or of any one's marriage. And all things ye lay to the charge of a bird that belong to discerning prediction: Winged fame is a bird, as you reckon: you sneeze, and the sign's as a bird for conviction: All tokens are “birds” with you—sounds too, and lackeys, and donkeys. Then must it not follow That we are to you all as the manifest godhead that speaks in prophetic Apollo? October 19, 1880. OFF SHORE When the might of the summer Is most on the sea; When the days overcome her With joy but to be, With rapture of royal enchantment, and sorcery that sets her not free, But for hours upon hours As a thrall she remains Spell-bound as with flowers And content in their chains, And her loud steeds fret not, and lift not a lock of their deep white manes; Then only, far under In the depths of her hold, Some gleam of its wonder Man's eye may behold, Its wild-weed forests of crimson and russet and olive and gold. Still deeper and dimmer And goodlier they glow For the eyes of the swimmer Who scans them below As he crosses the zone of their flowerage that knows not of sunshine and snow. Soft blossomless frondage And foliage that gleams As to prisoners in bondage The light of their dreams, The desire of a dawn unbeholden, with hope on the wings of its beams. Not as prisoners entombed Waxen haggard and wizen, But consoled and illumed In the depths of their prison With delight of the light everlasting and vision of dawn on them risen, From the banks and the beds Of the waters divine They lift up their heads And the flowers of them shine Through the splendour of darkness that clothes them of water that glimmers like wine. Bright bank over bank Making glorious the gloom, Soft rank upon rank, Strange bloom after bloom, They kindle the liquid low twilight, the dusk of the dim sea's womb. Through the subtle and tangible Gloom without form, Their branches, infrangible Ever of storm, Spread softer their sprays than the shoots of the woodland when April is warm. As the flight of the thunder, full Charged with its word, Dividing the wonderful Depths like a bird, Speaks wrath and delight to the heart of the night that exults to have heard, So swiftly, though soundless In silence's ear, Light, winged from the boundless Blue depths full of cheer, Speaks joy to the heart of the waters that part not before him, but hear. Light, perfect and visible Godhead of God, God indivisible, Lifts but his rod, And the shadows are scattered in sunder, and darkness is light at his nod. At the touch of his wand, At the nod of his head From the spaces beyond Where the dawn hath her bed, Earth, water, and air are transfigured, and rise as one risen from the dead. He puts forth his hand, And the mountains are thrilled To the heart as they stand In his presence, fulfilled With his glory that utters his grace upon earth, and her sorrows are stilled. The moan of her travail That groans for the light Till dayspring unravel The weft of the night, At the sound of the strings of the music of morning, falls dumb with delight. He gives forth his word, And the word that he saith, Ere well it be heard, Strikes darkness to death; For the thought of his heart is the sunrise, and dawn as the sound of his breath. And the strength of its pulses That passion makes proud Confounds and convulses The depths of the cloud Of the darkness that heaven was engirt with, divided and rent as a shroud, As the veil of the shrine Of the temple of old When darkness divine Over noonday was rolled; So the heart of the night by the pulse of the light is convulsed and controlled. And the sea's heart, groaning For glories withdrawn, And the waves' mouths, moaning All night for the dawn, Are uplift as the hearts and the mouths of the singers on leaside and lawn. And the sound of the quiring Of all these as one, Desired and desiring Till dawn's will be done, Fills full with delight of them heaven till it burns as the heart of the sun. Till the waves too inherit And waters take part In the sense of the spirit That breathes from his heart, And are kindled with music as fire when the lips of the morning part, With music unheard In the light of her lips, In the life-giving word Of the dewfall that drips On the grasses of earth, and the wind that enkindles the wings of the ships. White glories of wings As of seafaring birds That flock from the springs Of the sunrise in herds With the wind for a herdsman, and hasten or halt at the change of his words. At the watchword's change When the wind's note shifts, And the skies grow strange, And the white squall drifts Up sharp from the sea-line, vexing the sea till the low cloud lifts. At the charge of his word Bidding pause, bidding haste, When the ranks are stirred And the lines displaced, They scatter as wild swans parting adrift on the wan green waste. At the hush of his word In a pause of his breath When the waters have heard His will that he saith, They stand as a flock penned close in its fold for division of death. As a flock by division Of death to be thinned, As the shades in a vision Of spirits that sinned; So glimmer their shrouds and their sheetings as clouds on the stream of the wind. But the sun stands fast, And the sea burns bright, And the flight of them past Is no more than the flight Of the snow-soft swarm of serene wings poised and afloat in the light. Like flowers upon flowers In a festival way When hours after hours Shed grace on the day, White blossomlike butterflies hover and gleam through the snows of the spray. Like snow-coloured petals Of blossoms that flee From storm that unsettles The flower as the tree They flutter, a legion of flowers on the wing, through the field of the sea. Through the furrowless field Where the foam-blossoms blow And the secrets are sealed Of their harvest below They float in the path of the sunbeams, as flakes or as blossoms of snow. Till the sea's ways darken, And the God, withdrawn, Give ear not or hearken If prayer on him fawn, And the sun's self seem but a shadow, the noon as a ghost of the dawn. No shadow, but rather God, father of song, Show grace to me, Father God, loved of me long, That I lose not the light of thy face, that my trust in thee work me not wrong. While yet I make forward With face toward thee Not turned yet in shoreward, Be thine upon me; Be thy light on my forehead or ever I turn it again from the sea. As a kiss on my brow Be the light of thy grace, Be thy glance on me now From the pride of thy place: As the sign of a sire to a son be the light on my face of thy face. Thou wast father of olden Times hailed and adored, And the sense of thy golden Great harp's monochord Was the joy in the soul of the singers that hailed thee for master and lord. Fair father of all In thy ways that have trod, That have risen at thy call, That have thrilled at thy nod, Arise, shine, lighten upon me, O sun that we see to be God. As my soul has been dutiful Only to thee, O God most beautiful, Lighten thou me, As I swim through the dim long rollers, with eyelids uplift from the sea. Be praised and adored of us All in accord, Father and lord of us Alway adored, The slayer and the stayer and the harper, the light of us all and our lord. At the sound of thy lyre, At the touch of thy rod, Air quickens to fire By the foot of thee trod, The saviour and healer and singer, the living and visible God. The years are before thee As shadows of thee, As men that adore thee, As cloudlets that flee: But thou art the God, and thy kingdom is heaven, and thy shrine is the sea. AFTER NINE YEARS TO JOSEPH MAZZINI Primâ dicte mihi, summâ dicende Camenâ 1 The shadows fallen of years are nine Since heaven grew seven times more divine With thy soul entering, and the dearth Of souls on earth Grew sevenfold sadder, wanting One Whose light of life, quenched here and done, Burns there eternal as the sun. 2 Beyond all word, beyond all deed, Beyond all thought beloved, what need Has death or love that speech should be, Hast thou of me? I had no word, no prayer, no cry, To praise or hail or mourn thee by, As when thou too wast man as I. 3 Nay, never, nor as any born Save one whose name priests turn to scorn, Who haply, though we know not now, Was man as thou, A wanderer branded with men's blame, Loved past man's utterance: yea, the same, Perchance, and as his name thy name. 4 Thou wast as very Christ—not he Degraded into Deity, And priest-polluted by such prayer As poisons air, Tongue-worship of the tongue that slays, False faith and parricidal praise: But the man crowned with suffering days. 5 God only, being of all mankind Most manlike, of most equal mind And heart most perfect, more than can Be heart of man Once in ten ages, born to be As haply Christ was, and as we Knew surely, seeing, and worshipped thee. 6 To know thee—this at least was ours, God, clothed upon with human hours, O face beloved, O spirit adored, Saviour and lord! That wast not only for thine own Redeemer—not of these alone But all to whom thy word was known. 7 Ten years have wrought their will with me Since last my words took wing for thee Who then wast even as now above Me, and my love. As then thou knewest not scorn, so now With that beloved benignant brow Take these of him whose light wast thou. FOR A PORTRAIT OF FELICE ORSINI Steadfast as sorrow, fiery sad, and sweet With underthoughts of love and faith, more strong Than doubt and hate and all ill thoughts which throng, Haply, round hope's or fear's world-wandering feet That find no rest from wandering till they meet Death, bearing palms in hand and crowns of song; His face, who thought to vanquish wrong with wrong, Erring, and make rage and redemption greet, Havoc and freedom; weaving in one weft Good with his right hand, evil with his left; But all a hero lived and erred and died; Looked thus upon the living world he left So bravely that with pity less than pride Men hail him Patriot and Tyrannicide. EVENING ON THE BROADS Over two shadowless waters, adrift as a pinnace in peril, Hangs as in heavy suspense, charged with irresolute light, Softly the soul of the sunset upholden awhile on the sterile Waves and wastes of the land, half repossessed by the night. Inland glimmer the shallows asleep and afar in the breathless Twilight: yonder the depths darken afar and asleep. Slowly the semblance of death out of heaven descends on the deathless Waters: hardly the light lives on the face of the deep— Hardly, but here for awhile. All over the grey soft shallow Hover the colours and clouds of the twilight, void of a star. As a bird unfledged is the broad-winged night, whose winglets are callow Yet, but soon with their plumes will she cover her brood from afar, Cover the brood of her worlds that cumber the skies with their blossom Thick as the darkness of leaf-shadowed spring is encumbered with flowers. World upon world is enwound in the bountiful girth of her bosom, Warm and lustrous with life lovely to look on as ours. Still is the sunset adrift as a spirit in doubt that dissembles Still with itself, being sick of division and dimmed by dismay— Nay, not so; but with love and delight beyond passion it trembles, Fearful and fain of the night, lovely with love of the day: Fain and fearful of rest that is like unto death, and begotten Out of the womb of the tomb, born of the seed of the grave: Lovely with shadows of loves that are only not wholly forgotten, Only not wholly suppressed by the dark as a wreck by the wave. Still there linger the loves of the morning and noon, in a vision Blindly beheld, but in vain: ghosts that are tired, and would rest. But the glories beloved of the night rise all too dense for division, Deep in the depth of her breast sheltered as doves in a nest. Fainter the beams of the loves of the daylight season enkindled Wane, and the memories of hours that were fair with the love of them fade: Loftier, aloft of the lights of the sunset stricken and dwindled, Gather the signs of the love at the heart of the night new-made. New-made night, new-born of the sunset, immeasurable, endless, Opens the secret of love hid from of old in her heart, In the deep sweet heart full-charged with faultless love of the friendless Spirits of men that are eased when the wheels of the sun depart. Still is the sunset afloat as a ship on the waters upholden Full-sailed, wide-winged, poised softly for ever asway— Nay, not so, but at least for a little, awhile at the golden Limit of arching air fain for an hour to delay. Here on the bar of the sand-bank, steep yet aslope to the gleaming Waste of the water without, waste of the water within, Lights overhead and lights underneath seem doubtfully dreaming Whether the day be done, whether the night may begin. Far and afar and farther again they falter and hover, Warm on the water and deep in the sky and pale on the cloud: Colder again and slowly remoter, afraid to recover Breath, yet fain to revive, as it seems, from the skirt of the shroud. Faintly the heartbeats shorten and pause of the light in the westward Heaven, as eastward quicken the paces of star upon star Hurried and eager of life as a child that strains to the breast-ward Eagerly, yearning forth of the deeps where the ways of them are, Glad of the glory of the gift of their life and the wealth of its wonder, Fain of the night and the sea and the sweet wan face of the earth. Over them air grows deeper, intense with delight in them: under Things are thrilled in their sleep as with sense of a sure new birth. But here by the sand-bank watching, with eyes on the sea-line, stranger Grows to me also the weight of the sea-ridge gazed on of me, Heavily heaped up, changefully changeless, void though of danger Void not of menace, but full of the might of the dense dull sea. Like as the wave is before me, behind is the bank deep-drifted; Yellow and thick as the bank is behind me in front is the wave. As the wall of a prison imprisoning the mere is the girth of it lifted: But the rampire of water in front is erect as the wall of a grave. And the crests of it crumble and topple and change, but the wall is not broken: Standing still dry-shod, I see it as higher than my head, Moving inland alway again, reared up as in token Still of impending wrath still in the foam of it shed. And even in the pauses between them, dividing the rollers in sunder, High overhead seems ever the sea-line fixed as a mark, And the shore where I stand as a valley beholden of hills whence thunder Cloud and torrent and storm, darkening the depths of the dark. Up to the sea, not upon it or over it, upward from under Seems he to gaze, whose eyes yearn after it here from the shore: A wall of turbid water, aslope to the wide sky's wonder Of colour and cloud, it climbs, or spreads as a slanted floor. And the large lights change on the face of the mere like things that were living, Winged and wonderful, beams like as birds are that pass and are free: But the light is dense as darkness, a gift withheld in the giving, That lies as dead on the fierce dull face of the landward sea. Stained and stifled and soiled, made earthier than earth is and duller, Grimly she puts back light as rejected, a thing put away: No transparent rapture, a molten music of colour; No translucent love taken and given of the day. Fettered and marred and begrimed is the light's live self on her falling, As the light of a man's life lighted the fume of a dungeon mars: Only she knows of the wind, when her wrath gives ear to him calling; The delight of the light she knows not, nor answers the sun or the stars. Love she hath none to return for the luminous love of their giving: None to reflect from the bitter and shallow response of her heart. Yearly she feeds on her dead, yet herself seems dead and not living, Or confused as a soul heavy-laden with trouble that will not depart. In the sound of her speech to the darkness the moan of her evil remorse is, Haply, for strong ships gnawed by the dog-toothed sea-bank's fang And trampled to death by the rage of the feet of her foam-lipped horses Whose manes are yellow as plague, and as ensigns of pestilence hang, That wave in the foul faint air of the breath of a death-stricken city; So menacing heaves she the manes of her rollers knotted with sand, Discoloured, opaque, suspended in sign as of strength without pity, That shake with flameless thunder the low long length of the strand. Here, far off in the farther extreme of the shore as it lengthens Northward, lonely for miles, ere ever a village begin, On the lapsing land that recedes as the growth of the strong sea strengthens Shoreward, thrusting further and further its outworks in, Here in Shakespeare's vision, a flower of her kin forsaken, Lay in her golden raiment alone on the wild wave's edge, Surely by no shore else, but here on the bank storm-shaken, Perdita, bright as a dew-drop engilt of the sun on the sedge. Here on a shore unbeheld of his eyes in a dream he beheld her Outcast, fair as a fairy, the child of a far-off king: And over the babe-flower gently the head of a pastoral elder Bowed, compassionate, hoar as the hawthorn-blossom in spring, And kind as harvest in autumn: a shelter of shade on the lonely Shelterless unknown shore scourged of implacable waves: Here, where the wind walks royal, alone in his kingdom, and only Sounds to the sedges a wail as of triumph that conquers and craves. All these waters and wastes are his empire of old, and awaken From barren and stagnant slumber at only the sound of his breath: Yet the hunger is eased not that aches in his heart, nor the goal overtaken That his wide wings yearn for and labour as hearts that yearn after death. All the solitude sighs and expects with a blind expectation Somewhat unknown of its own sad heart, grown heartsick of strife: Till sometime its wild heart maddens, and moans, and the vast ululation Takes wing with the clouds on the waters, and wails to be quit of its life. For the spirit and soul of the waste is the wind, and his wings with their waving Darken and lighten the darkness and light of it thickened or thinned; But the heart that impels them is even as a conqueror's insatiably craving That victory can fill not, as power cannot satiate the want of the wind. All these moorlands and marshes are full of his might, and oppose not Aught of defence nor of barrier, of forest or precipice piled: But the will of the wind works ever as his that desires what he knows not, And the wail of his want unfulfilled is as one making moan for her child. And the cry of his triumph is even as the crying of hunger that maddens The heart of a strong man aching in vain as the wind's heart aches And the sadness itself of the land for its infinite solitude saddens More for the sound than the silence athirst for the sound that slakes. And the sunset at last and the twilight are dead: and the darkness is breathless With fear of the wind's breath rising that seems and seems not to sleep: But a sense of the sound of it alway, a spirit unsleeping and deathless, Ghost or God, evermore moves on the face of the deep. THE EMPEROR'S PROGRESS A STUDY IN THREE STAGES (On the Busts of Nero in the Uffizj.) I A child of brighter than the morning's birth And lovelier than all smiles that may be smiled Save only of little children undefiled, Sweet, perfect, witless of their own dear worth, Live rose of love, mute melody of mirth, Glad as a bird is when the woods are mild, Adorable as is nothing save a child, Hails with wide eyes and lips his life on earth, His lovely life with all its heaven to be. And whoso reads the name inscribed or hears Feels his own heart a frozen well of tears, Child, for deep dread and fearful pity of thee Whom God would not let rather die than see The incumbent horror of impending years. II Man, that wast godlike being a child, and now, No less than kinglike, art no more in sooth For all thy grace and lordliness of youth, The crown that bids men's branded foreheads bow Much more has branded and bowed down thy brow And gnawn upon it as with fire or tooth Of steel or snake so sorely, that the truth Seems here to bear false witness. Is it thou, Child? and is all the summer of all thy spring This? are the smiles that drew men's kisses down All faded and transfigured to the frown That grieves thy face? Art thou this weary thing? Then is no slave's load heavier than a crown And such a thrall no bondman as a king. III Misery, beyond all men's most miserable, Absolute, whole, defiant of defence, Inevitable, inexplacable, intense, More vast than heaven is high, more deep than hell, Past cure or charm of solace or of spell, Possesses and pervades the spirit and sense Whereto the expanse of the earth pays tribute; whence Breeds evil only, and broods on fumes that swell Rank from the blood of brother and mother and wife. “Misery of miseries, all is misery,” saith The heavy fair-faced hateful head, at strife With its own lusts that burn with feverous breath Lips which the loathsome bitterness of life Leaves fearful of the bitterness of death. THE RESURRECTION OF ALCILIA (Gratefully inscribed to Dr. A. B. Grosart.) Sweet song-flower of the Mayspring of our song, Be welcome to us, with loving thanks and praise To his good hand who travelling on strange ways Found thee forlorn and fragrant, lain along Beneath dead leaves that many a winter's wrong Had rained and heaped through nigh three centuries' maze Above thy Maybloom, hiding from our gaze The life that in thy leaves lay sweet and strong. For thine have life, while many above thine head Piled by the wind lie blossomless and dead. So now disburdened of such load above That lay as death's own dust upon thee shed By days too deaf to hear thee like a dove Murmuring, we hear thee, bird and flower of love. THE FOURTEENTH OF JULY (On the refusal by the French Senate of the plenary amnesty demanded by Victor Hugo, in his speech of July 3rd, for the surviving exiles of the Commune.) Thou shouldst have risen as never dawn yet rose, Day of the sunrise of the soul of France, Dawn of the whole world's morning, when the trance Of all the world had end, and all its woes Respite, prophetic of their perfect close. Light of all tribes of men, all names and clans, Dawn of the whole world's morning and of man's, Flower of the heart of morning's mystic rose, Dawn of the very dawn of very day, When the sun brighter breaks night's ruinous prison, Thou shouldst have risen as yet no dawn has risen, Evoked of him whose word puts night away, Our father, at the music of whose word Exile had ended, and the world had heard. July 5, 1880. THE LAUNCH OF THE LIVADIA Malâ soluta navis exit alite. Hor. Rigged with curses dark. Milton. I Gold, and fair marbles, and again more gold, And space of halls afloat that glance and gleam Like the green heights of sunset heaven, or seem The golden steeps of sunrise red and cold On deserts where dark exile keeps the fold Fast of the flocks of torment, where no beam Falls of kind light or comfort save in dream, These we far off behold not, who behold The cordage woven of curses, and the decks With mortal hate and mortal peril paven; From stem to stern the lines of doom engraven That mark for sure inevitable wrecks Those sails predestinate, though no storm vex, To miss on earth and find in hell their haven. II All curses be about her, and all ill Go with her; heaven be dark above her way, The gulf beneath her glad and sure of prey, And, wheresoe'er her prow be pointed, still The winds of heaven have all one evil will Conspirant even as hearts of kings to slay With mouths of kings to lie and smile and pray, And chiefliest his whose wintrier breath makes chill With more than winter's and more poisonous cold The horror of his kingdom toward the north, The deserts of his kingdom toward the east. And though death hide not in her direful hold Be all stars adverse toward her that come forth Nightly, by day all hours till all have ceased: III Till all have ceased for ever, and the sum Be summed of all the sumless curses told Out on his head by all dark seasons rolled Over its cursed and crowned existence, dumb And blind and stark as though the snows made numb All sense within it, and all conscience cold, That hangs round hearts of less imperial mould Like a snake feeding till their doomsday come. O heart fast bound of frozen poison, be All nature's as all true men's hearts to thee, A two-edged sword of judgment; hope be far And fear at hand for pilot oversea With death for compass and despair for star, And the white foam a shroud for the White Czar. September 30, 1880. SIX YEARS OLD To H. W. M. Between the springs of six and seven, Two fresh years' fountains, clear Of all but golden sand for leaven, Child, midway passing here, As earth for love's sake dares bless heaven, So dare I bless you, dear. Between two bright well-heads, that brighten With every breath that blows Too loud to lull, too low to frighten, But fain to rock, the rose, Your feet stand fast, your lit smiles lighten, That might rear flowers from snows. You came when winds unleashed were snarling Behind the frost-bound hours, A snow-bird sturdier than the starling, A storm-bird fledged for showers, That spring might smile to find you, darling, First born of all the flowers. Could love make worthy things of worthless, My song were worth an ear: Its note should make the days most mirthless The merriest of the year, And wake to birth all buds yet birthless To keep your birthday, dear. But where your birthday brightens heaven No need has earth, God knows, Of light or warmth to melt or leaven The frost or fog that glows With sevenfold heavenly lights of seven Sweet springs that cleave the snows. Could love make worthy music of you, And match my Master's powers, Had even my love less heart to love you, A better song were ours; With all the rhymes like stars above you, And all the words like flowers. September 30, 1880. A PARTING SONG (To a friend leaving England for a year's residence in Australia.) These winds and suns of spring That warm with breath and wing The trembling sleep of earth, till half awake She laughs and blushes ere her slumber break, For all good gifts they bring Require one better thing, For all the loans of joy they lend us, borrow One sharper dole of sorrow, To sunder soon by half a world of sea Her son from England and my friend from me. Nor hope nor love nor fear May speed or stay one year, Nor song nor prayer may bid, as mine would fain, The seasons perish and be born again, Restoring all we lend, Reluctant, of a friend, The voice, the hand, the presence and the sight That lend their life and light To present gladness and heart-strengthening cheer, Now lent again for one reluctant year. So much we lend indeed, Perforce, by force of need, So much we must; even these things and no more The far sea sundering and the sundered shore, A world apart from ours, So much the imperious hours, Exact, and spare not; but no more than these All earth and all her seas From thought and faith of trust and truth can borrow, Not memory from desire, nor hope from sorrow. Through bright and dark and bright Returns of day and night I bid the swift year speed and change and give His breath of life to make the next year live With sunnier suns for us A life more prosperous, And laugh with flowers more fragrant, that shall see A merrier March for me, A rosier-girdled race of night with day, A goodlier April and a tenderer May. For him the inverted year Shall mark our seasons here With alien alternation, and revive This withered winter, slaying the spring alive With darts more sharply drawn As nearer draws the dawn In heaven transfigured over earth transformed And with our winters warmed And wasted with our summers, till the beams Rise on his face that rose on Dante's dreams. Till fourfold morning rise Of starshine on his eyes, Dawn of the spheres that brand steep heaven across At height of night with semblance of a cross Whose grace and ghostly glory Poured heaven on purgatory, Seeing with their flamelets risen all heaven grow glad For love thereof it had And lovely joy of loving; so may these Make bright with welcome now their southern seas. O happy stars, whose mirth The saddest soul on earth That ever soared and sang found strong to bless, Lightening his life's harsh load of heaviness With comfort sown like seed In dream though not in deed On sprinkled wastes of darkling thought divine, Let all your lights now shine With all as glorious gladness on his eyes For whom indeed and not in dream they rise. As those great twins of air Hailed once with oldworld prayer Of all folk alway faring forth by sea, So now may these for grace and guidance be, To guard his sail and bring Again to brighten spring The face we look for and the hand we lack Still, till they light him back, As welcome as to first discovering eyes Their light rose ever, soon on his to rise. As parting now he goes From snow-time back to snows, So back to spring from summer may next year Restore him, and our hearts receive him here, The best good gift that spring Had ever grace to bring At fortune's happiest hour of star-blest birth Back to love's homebright earth, To eyes with eyes that commune, hand with hand, And the old warm bosom of all our mother-land. Earth and sea-wind and sea And stars and sunlight be Alike all prosperous for him, and all hours Have all one heart, and all that heart as ours. All things as good as strange Crown all the seasons' change With changing flower and compensating fruit From one year's ripening root; Till next year bring us, roused at spring's recall, A heartier flower and goodlier fruit than all. March 26, 1880. BY THE NORTH SEA TO WALTER THEODORE WATTS “We are what suns and winds and waters make us.” —Landor. Sea, wind, and sun, with light and sound and breath The spirit of man fulfilling—these create That joy wherewith man's life grown passionate Gains heart to hear and sense to read and faith To know the secret word our Mother saith In silence, and to see, though doubt wax great, Death as the shadow cast by life on fate, Passing, whose shade we call the shadow of death. Brother, to whom our Mother as to me Is dearer than all dreams of days undone, This song I give you of the sovereign three That are as life and sleep and death are, one: A song the sea-wind gave me from the sea, Where nought of man's endures before the sun. I 1 A land that is lonelier than ruin; A sea that is stranger than death: Far fields that a rose never blew in, Wan waste where the winds lack breath; Waste endless and boundless and flowerless But of marsh-blossoms fruitless as free: Where earth lies exhausted, as powerless To strive with the sea. 2 Far flickers the flight of the swallows, Far flutters the weft of the grass Spun dense over desolate hollows More pale than the clouds as they pass: Thick woven as the weft of a witch is Round the heart of a thrall that hath sinned, Whose youth and the wrecks of its riches Are waifs on the wind. 3 The pastures are herdless and sheepless, No pasture or shelter for herds: The wind is relentless and sleepless, And restless and songless the birds; Their cries from afar fall breathless, Their wings are as lightnings that flee; For the land has two lords that are deathless: Death's self, and the sea. 4 These twain, as a king with his fellow, Hold converse of desolate speech: And her waters are haggard and yellow And crass with the scurf of the beach: And his garments are grey as the hoary Wan sky where the day lies dim; And his power is to her, and his glory, As hers unto him. 5 In the pride of his power she rejoices, In her glory he glows and is glad: In her darkness the sound of his voice is, With his breath she dilates and is mad: “If thou slay me, O death, and outlive me, Yet thy love hath fulfilled me of thee.” “Shall I give thee not back if thou give me, O sister, O sea?” 6 And year upon year dawns living, And age upon age drops dead: And his hand is not weary of giving, And the thirst of her heart is not fed: And the hunger that moans in her passion, And the rage in her hunger that roars, As a wolf's that the winter lays lash on, Still calls and implores. 7 Her walls have no granite for girder, No fortalice fronting her stands: But reefs the bloodguiltiest of murder Are less than the banks of her sands: These number their slain by the thousand; For the ship hath no surety to be, When the bank is abreast of her bows and Aflush with the sea. 8 No surety to stand, and no shelter To dawn out of darkness but one, Out of waters that hurtle and welter No succour to dawn with the sun, But a rest from the wind as it passes, Where, hardly redeemed from the waves, Lie thick as the blades of the grasses The dead in their graves. 9 A multitude noteless of numbers, As wild weeds cast on an heap: And sounder than sleep are their slumbers, And softer than song is their sleep; And sweeter than all things and stranger The sense, if perchance it may be, That the wind is divested of danger And scatheless the sea. 10 That the roar of the banks they breasted Is hurtless as bellowing of herds, And the strength of his wings that invested The wind, as the strength of a bird's; As the sea-mew's might or the swallow's That cry to him back if he cries, As over the graves and their hollows Days darken and rise. 11 As the souls of the dead men disburdened And clean of the sins that they sinned, With a lovelier than man's life guerdoned And delight as a wave's in the wind, And delight as the wind's in the billow, Birds pass, and deride with their glee The flesh that has dust for its pillow As wrecks have the sea. 12 When the ways of the sun wax dimmer, Wings flash through the dusk like beams; As the clouds in the lit sky glimmer, The bird in the graveyard gleams; As the cloud at its wing's edge whitens When the clarions of sunrise are heard, The graves that the bird's note brightens Grow bright for the bird. 13 As the waves of the numberless waters That the wind cannot number who guides Are the sons of the shore and the daughters Here lulled by the chime of the tides: And here in the press of them standing We know not if these or if we Live truliest, or anchored to landing Or drifted to sea. 14 In the valley he named of decision No denser were multitudes met When the soul of the seer in her vision Saw nations for doom of them set; Saw darkness in dawn, and the splendour Of judgment, the sword and the rod; But the doom here of death is more tender And gentler the god. 15 And gentler the wind from the dreary Sea-banks by the waves overlapped, Being weary, speaks peace to the weary From slopes that the tide-stream hath sapped; And sweeter than all that we call so The seal of their slumber shall be Till the graves that embosom them also Be sapped of the sea. II 1 For the heart of the waters is cruel, And the kisses are dire of their lips, And their waves are as fire is to fuel To the strength of the sea-faring ships, Though the sea's eye gleam as a jewel To the sun's eye back as he dips. 2 Though the sun's eye flash to the sea's Live light of delight and of laughter, And her lips breathe back to the breeze The kiss that the wind's lips waft her From the sun that subsides, and sees No gleam of the storm's dawn after. 3 And the wastes of the wild sea-marches Where the borderers are matched in their might— Bleak fens that the sun's weight parches, Dense waves that reject his light— Change under the change-coloured arches Of changeless morning and night. 4 The waves are as ranks enrolled Too close for the storm to sever: The fens lie naked and cold, But their heart fails utterly never: The lists are set from of old, And the warfare endureth for ever. III 1 Miles, and miles, and miles of desolation! Leagues on leagues on leagues without a change! Sign or token of some eldest nation Here would make the strange land not so strange. Time-forgotten, yea since time's creation, Seem these borders where the sea-birds range. 2 Slowly, gladly, full of peace and wonder Grows his heart who journeys here alone. Earth and all its thoughts of earth sink under Deep as deep in water sinks a stone. Hardly knows it if the rollers thunder, Hardly whence the lonely wind is blown. 3 Tall the plumage of the rush-flower tosses, Sharp and soft in many a curve and line Gleam and glow the sea-coloured marsh-mosses Salt and splendid from the circling brine. Streak on streak of glimmering seashine crosses All the land sea-saturate as with wine. 4 Far, and far between, in divers orders, Clear grey steeples cleave the low grey sky; Fast and firm as time-unshaken warders, Hearts made sure by faith, by hope made high. These alone in all the wild sea-borders Fear no blast of days and nights that die. 5 All the land is like as one man's face is, Pale and troubled still with change of cares. Doubt and death pervade her clouded spaces: Strength and length of life and peace are theirs; Theirs alone amid these weary places, Seeing not how the wild world frets and fares. 6 Firm and fast where all is cloud that changes Cloud-clogged sunlight, cloud by sunlight thinned, Stern and sweet, above the sand-hill ranges Watch the towers and tombs of men that sinned Once, now calm as earth whose only change is Wind, and light, and wind, and cloud, and wind. 7 Out and in and out the sharp straits wander, In and out and in the wild way strives, Starred and paved and lined with flowers that squander Gold as golden as the gold of hives, Salt and moist and multiform: but yonder See, what sign of life or death survives? 8 Seen then only when the songs of olden Harps were young whose echoes yet endure, Hymned of Homer when his years were golden, Known of only when the world was pure, Here is Hades, manifest, beholden, Surely, surely here, if aught be sure! 9 Where the border-line was crossed, that, sundering Death from life, keeps weariness from rest, None can tell, who fares here forward wondering; None may doubt but here might end his quest. Here life's lightning joys and woes once thundering Sea-like round him cease like storm suppressed. 10 Here the wise wave-wandering steadfast-hearted Guest of many a lord of many a land Saw the shape or shade of years departed, Saw the semblance risen and hard at hand, Saw the mother long from love's reach parted, Anticleia, like a statue stand. 11 Statue? nay, nor tissued image woven Fair on hangings in his father's hall; Nay, too fast her faith of heart was proven, Far too firm her loveliest love of all; Love wherethrough the loving heart was cloven, Love that hears not when the loud Fates call. 12 Love that lives and stands up re-created Then when life has ebbed and anguish fled; Love more strong than death or all things fated, Child's and mother's, lit by love and led; Love that found what life so long awaited Here, when life came down among the dead. 13 Here, where never came alive another, Came her son across the sundering tide Crossed before by many a warrior brother Once that warred on Ilion at his side; Here spread forth vain hands to clasp the mother Dead, that sorrowing for his love's sake died. 14 Parted, though by narrowest of divisions, Clasp he might not, only might implore, Sundered yet by bitterest of derisions, Son, and mother from the son she bore— Here? But all dispeopled here of visions Lies, forlorn of shadows even, the shore. 15 All too sweet such men's Hellenic speech is, All too fain they lived of light to see, Once to see the darkness of these beaches, Once to sing this Hades found of me Ghostless, all its gulfs and creeks and reaches, Sky, and shore, and cloud, and waste, and sea. IV 1 But aloft and afront of me faring Far forward as folk in a dream That strive, between doubting and daring, Right on till the goal for them gleam, Full forth till their goal on them lighten, The harbour where fain they would be, What headlands there darken and brighten? What change in the sea? 2 What houses and woodlands that nestle Safe inland to lee of the hill As it slopes from the headlands that wrestle And succumb to the strong sea's will? Truce is not, nor respite, nor pity, For the battle is waged not of hands Where over the grave of a city The ghost of it stands. 3 Where the wings of the sea-wind slacken, Green lawns to the landward thrive, Fields brighten and pine-woods blacken, And the heat in their heart is alive; They blossom and warble and murmur, For the sense of their spirit is free: But harder to shoreward and firmer The grasp of the sea. 4 Like ashes the low cliffs crumble, The banks drop down into dust, The heights of the hills are made humble, As a reed's is the strength of their trust: As a city's that armies environ, The strength of their stay is of sand: But the grasp of the sea is as iron, Laid hard on the land. 5 A land that is thirstier than ruin; A sea that is hungrier than death; Heaped hills that a tree never grew in; Wide sands where the wave draws breath; All solace is here for the spirit That ever for ever may be For the soul of thy son to inherit, My mother, my sea. 6 O delight of the headlands and beaches! O desire of the wind on the wold, More glad than a man's when it reaches That end which it sought from of old And the palm of possession is dreary To the sense that in search of it sinned; But nor satisfied ever nor weary Is ever the wind. 7 The delight that he takes but in living Is more than of all things that live: For the world that has all things for giving Has nothing so goodly to give: But more than delight his desire is, For the goal where his pinions would be Is immortal as air or as fire is, Immense as the sea. 8 Though hence come the moan that he borrows From darkness and depth of the night, Though hence be the spring of his sorrows, Hence too is the joy of his might; The delight that his doom is for ever To seek and desire and rejoice, And the sense that eternity never Shall silence his voice. 9 That satiety never may stifle Nor weariness ever estrange Nor time be so strong as to rifle Nor change be so great as to change His gift that renews in the giving, The joy that exalts him to be Alone of all elements living The lord of the sea. 10 What is fire, that its flame should consume her? More fierce than all fires are her waves: What is earth, that its gulfs should entomb her? More deep are her own than their graves. Life shrinks from his pinions that cover The darkness by thunders bedinned: But she knows him, her lord and her lover The godhead of wind. 11 For a season his wings are about her, His breath on her lips for a space; Such rapture he wins not without her In the width of his worldwide race. Though the forests bow down, and the mountains Wax dark, and the tribes of them flee, His delight is more deep in the fountains And springs of the sea. 12 There are those too of mortals that love him, There are souls that desire and require, Be the glories of midnight above him Or beneath him the daysprings of fire: And their hearts are as harps that approve him And praise him as chords of a lyre That were fain with their music to move him To meet their desire 13 To descend through the darkness to grace them, Till darkness were lovelier than light: To encompass and grasp and embrace them, Till their weakness were one with his might: With the strength of his wings to caress them, With the blast of his breath to set free; With the mouths of his thunders to bless them For sons of the sea. 14 For these have the toil and the guerdon That the wind has eternally: these Have part in the boon and the burden Of the sleepless unsatisfied breeze, That finds not, but seeking rejoices That possession can work him no wrong: And the voice at the heart of their voice is The sense of his song. 15 For the wind's is their doom and their blessing; To desire, and have always above A possession beyond their possessing, A love beyond reach of their love. Green earth has her sons and her daughters, And these have their guerdons; but we Are the wind's and the sun's and the water's, Elect of the sea. V 1 For the sea too seeks and rejoices, Gains and loses and gains, And the joy of her heart's own choice is As ours, and as ours are her pains: As the thoughts of our hearts are her voices, And as hers is the pulse of our veins. 2 Her fields that know not of dearth Nor lie for their fruit's sake fallow Laugh large in the depth of their mirth: But inshore here in the shallow, Embroiled with encumbrance of earth, Their skirts are turbid and yellow. 3 The grime of her greed is upon her, The sign of her deed is her soil; As the earth's is her own dishonour, And corruption the crown of her toil: She hath spoiled and devoured, and her honour Is this, to be shamed by her spoil. 4 But afar where pollution is none, Nor ensign of strife nor endeavour, Where her heart and the sun's are one, And the soil of her sin comes never, She is pure as the wind and the sun, And her sweetness endureth for ever. VI 1 Death, and change, and darkness everlasting, Deaf, that hears not what the daystar saith, Blind, past all remembrance and forecasting, Dead, past memory that it once drew breath; These, above the washing tides and wasting, Reign, and rule this land of utter death. 2 Change of change, darkness of darkness, hidden, Very death of very death, begun When none knows,—the knowledge is forbidden— Self-begotten, self-proceeding, one, Born, not made—abhorred, unchained, unchidden, Night stands here defiant of the sun. 3 Change of change, and death of death begotten, Darkness born of darkness, one and three, Ghostly godhead of a world forgotten, Crowned with heaven, enthroned on land and sea, Here, where earth with dead men's bones is rotten, God of Time, thy likeness worships thee. 4 Lo, thy likeness of thy desolation, Shape and figure of thy might, O Lord, Formless form, incarnate miscreation, Served of all things living and abhorred; Earth herself is here thine incarnation, Time, of all things born on earth adored. 5 All that worship thee are fearful of thee; No man may not worship thee for fear: Prayers nor curses prove not nor disprove thee, Move nor change thee with our change of cheer: All at last, though all abhorred thee, love thee, God, the sceptre of whose throne is here. 6 Here thy throne and sceptre of thy station, Here the palace paven for thy feet; Here thy sign from nation unto nation Passed as watchword for thy guards to greet, Guards that go before thine exaltation, Ages, clothed with bitter years and sweet. 7 Here, where sharp the sea-bird shrills his ditty, Flickering flame-wise through the clear live calm, Rose triumphal, crowning all a city, Roofs exalted once with prayer and psalm, Built of holy hands for holy pity, Frank and fruitful as a sheltering palm. 8 Church and hospice wrought in faultless fashion, Hall and chancel bounteous and sublime, Wide and sweet and glorious as compassion, Filled and thrilled with force of choral chime, Filled with spirit of prayer and thrilled with passion, Hailed a God more merciful than Time. 9 Ah, less mighty, less than Time prevailing, Shrunk, expelled, made nothing at his nod, Less than clouds across the sea-line sailing, Lies he, stricken by his master's rod. “Where is man?” the cloister murmurs wailing; Back the mute shrine thunders—“Where is God?” 10 Here is all the end of all his glory— Dust, and grass, and barren silent stones. Dead, like him, one hollow tower and hoary Naked in the sea-wind stands and moans, Filled and thrilled with its perpetual story: Here, where earth is dense with dead men's bones. 11 Low and loud and long, a voice for ever, Sounds the wind's clear story like a song. Tomb from tomb the waves devouring sever, Dust from dust as years relapse along; Graves where men made sure to rest, and never Lie dismantled by the seasons' wrong. 12 Now displaced, devoured and desecrated, Now by Time's hands darkly disinterred, These poor dead that sleeping here awaited Long the archangel's re-creating word, Closed about with roofs and walls high-gated Till the blast of judgment should be heard, 13 Naked, shamed, cast out of consecration, Corpse and coffin, yea the very graves, Scoffed at, scattered, shaken from their station, Spurned and scourged of wind and sea like slaves, Desolate beyond man's desolation, Shrink and sink into the waste of waves. 14 Tombs, with bare white piteous bones protruded, Shroudless, down the loose collapsing banks, Crumble, from their constant place detruded, That the sea devours and gives not thanks. Graves where hope and prayer and sorrow brooded Gape and slide and perish, ranks on ranks. 15 Rows on rows and line by line they crumble, They that thought for all time through to be. Scarce a stone whereon a child might stumble Breaks the grim field paced alone of me. Earth, and man, and all their gods wax humble Here, where Time brings pasture to the sea. VII 1 But afar on the headland exalted, But beyond in the curl of the bay, From the depth of his dome deep-vaulted Our father is lord of the day. Our father and lord that we follow, For deathless and ageless is he; And his robe is the whole sky's hollow, His sandal the sea. 2 Where the horn of the headland is sharper, And her green floor glitters with fire, The sea has the sun for a harper, The sun has the sea for a lyre. The waves are a pavement of amber, By the feet of the sea-winds trod To receive in a god's presence-chamber Our father, the God. 3 Time, haggard and changeful and hoary, Is master and God of the land: But the air is fulfilled of the glory That is shed from our lord's right hand. O father of all of us ever, All glory be only to thee From heaven, that is void of thee never, And earth, and the sea. 4 O Sun, whereof all is beholden, Behold now the shadow of this death, This place of the sepulchres, olden And emptied and vain as a breath. The bloom of the bountiful heather Laughs broadly beyond in thy light As dawn, with her glories to gather, At darkness and night. 5 Though the Gods of the night lie rotten And their honour be taken away And the noise of their names forgotten, Thou, Lord, art God of the day. Thou art father and saviour and spirit, O Sun, of the soul that is free And hath grace of thy grace to inherit Thine earth and thy sea. 6 The hills and the sands and the beaches, The waters adrift and afar, The banks and the creeks and the reaches, How glad of thee all these are! The flowers, overflowing, overcrowded, Are drunk with the mad wind's mirth: The delight of thy coming unclouded Makes music of earth. 7 I, last least voice of her voices, Give thanks that were mute in me long To the soul in my soul that rejoices For the song that is over my song. Time gives what he gains for the giving Or takes for his tribute of me; My dreams to the wind everliving, My song to the sea. A CENTURY OF ROUNDELS DEDICATION TO CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI Songs light as these may sound, though deep and strong The heart spake through them, scarce should hope to please Ears tuned to strains of loftier thoughts than throng Songs light as these. Yet grace may set their sometime doubt at ease, Nor need their too rash reverence fear to wrong The shrine it serves at and the hope it sees. For childlike loves and laughters thence prolong Notes that bid enter, fearless as the breeze, Even to the shrine of holiest-hearted song, Songs light as these. IN HARBOUR I Goodnight and goodbye to the life whose signs denote us As mourners clothed with regret for the life gone by; To the waters of gloom whence winds of the day-spring float us Goodnight and goodbye. A time is for mourning, a season for grief to sigh; But were we not fools and blind, by day to devote us As thralls to the darkness, unseen of the sundawn's eye? We have drunken of Lethe at length, we have eaten of lotus; What hurts it us here that sorrows are born and die? We have said to the dream that caressed and the dread that smote us Goodnight and goodbye. II Outside of the port ye are moored in, lying Close from the wind and at ease from the tide, What sounds come swelling, what notes fall dying Outside? They will not cease, they will not abide: Voices of presage in darkness crying Pass and return and relapse aside. Ye see not, but hear ye not wild wings flying To the future that wakes from the past that died? Is grief still sleeping, is joy not sighing Outside? THE WAY OF THE WIND The wind's way in the deep sky's hollow None may measure, as none can say How the heart in her shows the swallow The wind's way. Hope nor fear can avail to stay Waves that whiten on wrecks that wallow, Times and seasons that wane and slay. Life and love, till the strong night swallow Thought and hope and the red last ray, Swim the waters of years that follow The wind's way. “HAD I WIST” Had I wist, when life was like a warm wind playing Light and loud through sundawn and the dew's bright mist, How the time should come for hearts to sigh in saying “Had I wist”— Surely not the roses, laughing as they kissed, Not the lovelier laugh of seas in sunshine swaying, Should have lured my soul to look thereon and list. Now the wind is like a soul cast out and praying Vainly, prayers that pierce not ears when hearts resist: Now mine own soul sighs, adrift as wind and straying, “Had I wist.” RECOLLECTIONS I Years upon years, as a course of clouds that thicken, Thronging the ways of the wind that shifts and veers, Pass, and the flames of remembered fires requicken Years upon years. Surely the thought in a man's heart hopes or fears Now that forgetfulness needs must here have stricken Anguish, and sweetened the sealed-up springs of tears. Ah, but the strength of regrets that strain and sicken, Yearning for love that the veil of death endears, Slackens not wing for the wings of years that quicken— Years upon years. II Years upon years, and the flame of love's high altar Trembles and sinks, and the sense of listening ears Heeds not the sound that it heard of love's blithe psalter Years upon years. Only the sense of a heart that hearkens hears, Louder than dreams that assail and doubts that palter, Sorrow that slept and that wakes ere sundawn peers. Wakes, that the heart may behold, and yet not falter, Faces of children as stars unknown of, spheres Seen but of love, that endures though all things alter, Years upon years. III Years upon years, as a watch by night that passes, Pass, and the light of their eyes is fire that sears Slowly the hopes of the fruit that life amasses Years upon years. Pale as the glimmer of stars on moorland meres Lighten the shadows reverberate from the glasses Held in their hands as they pass among their peers. Lights that are shadows, as ghosts on graveyard grasses, Moving on paths that the moon of memory cheers, Show but as mists over cloudy mountain passes Years upon years. TIME AND LIFE I Time, thy name is sorrow, says the stricken Heart of life, laid waste with wasting flame Ere the change of things and thoughts requicken, Time, thy name. Girt about with shadow, blind and lame, Ghosts of things that smite and thoughts that sicken Hunt and hound thee down to death and shame. Eyes of hours whose paces halt or quicken Read in bloodred lines of loss and blame, Writ where cloud and darkness round it thicken, Time, thy name. II Nay, but rest is born of me for healing, —So might haply time, with voice represt, Speak: is grief the last gift of my dealing? Nay, but rest. All the world is wearied, east and west, Tired with toil to watch the slow sun wheeling, Twelve loud hours of life's laborious quest. Eyes forspent with vigil, faint and reeling, Find at last my comfort, and are blest, Not with rapturous light of life's revealing— Nay, but rest. A DIALOGUE I Death, if thou wilt, fain would I plead with thee: Canst thou not spare, of all our hopes have built, One shelter where our spirits fain would be, Death, if thou wilt? No dome with suns and dews impearled and gilt, Imperial: but some roof of wildwood tree, Too mean for sceptre's heft or swordblade's hilt. Some low sweet roof where love might live, set free From change and fear and dreams of grief or guilt; Canst thou not leave life even thus much to see, Death, if thou wilt? II Man, what art thou to speak and plead with me? What knowest thou of my workings, where and how What things I fashion? Nay, behold and see, Man, what art thou? Thy fruits of life, and blossoms of thy bough, What are they but my seedlings? Earth and sea Bear nought but when I breathe on it must bow. Bow thou too down before me: though thou be Great, all the pride shall fade from off thy brow, When Time and strong Oblivion ask of thee, Man, what art thou? III Death, if thou be or be not, as was said, Immortal; if thou make us nought, or we Survive: thy power is made but of our dread, Death, if thou be. Thy might is made out of our fear of thee: Who fears thee not, hath plucked from off thine head The crown of cloud that darkens earth and sea. Earth, sea, and sky, as rain or vapour shed, Shall vanish; all the shows of them shall flee: Then shall we know full surely, quick or dead, Death, if thou be. PLUS ULTRA Far beyond the sunrise and the sunset rises Heaven, with worlds on worlds that lighten and respond: Thought can see not thence the goal of hope's surmises Far beyond. Night and day have made an everlasting bond Each with each to hide in yet more deep disguises Truth, till souls of men that thirst for truth despond. All that man in pride of spirit slights or prizes, All the dreams that make him fearful, fain, or fond, Fade at forethought's touch of life's unknown surprises Far beyond. A DEAD FRIEND I Gone, O gentle heart and true, Friend of hopes foregone, Hopes and hopeful days with you Gone? Days of old that shone Saw what none shall see anew, When we gazed thereon. Soul as clear as sunlit dew, Why so soon pass on, Forth from all we loved and knew Gone? II Friend of many a season fled, What may sorrow send Toward thee now from lips that said “Friend”? Sighs and songs to blend Praise with pain uncomforted Though the praise ascend? Darkness hides no dearer head: Why should darkness end Day so soon, O dear and dead Friend? III Dear in death, thou hast thy part Yet in life, to cheer Hearts that held thy gentle heart Dear. Time and chance may sear Hope with grief, and death may part Hand from hand's clasp here: Memory, blind with tears that start, Sees through every tear All that made thee, as thou art, Dear. IV True and tender, single-souled, What should memory do Weeping o'er the trust we hold True? Known and loved of few, But of these, though small their fold, Loved how well were you! Change, that makes of new things old, Leaves one old thing new; Love which promised truth, and told True. V Kind as heaven, while earth's control Still had leave to bind Thee, thy heart was toward man's whole Kind. Thee no shadows blind Now: the change of hours that roll Leaves thy sleep behind. Love, that hears thy death-bell toll Yet, may call to mind Scarce a soul as thy sweet soul Kind. VI How should life, O friend, forget Death, whose guest art thou? Faith responds to love's regret, How? Still, for us that bow Sorrowing, still, though life be set, Shines thy bright mild brow. Yea, though death and thou be met, Love may find thee now Still, albeit we know not yet How. VII Past as music fades, that shone While its life might last; As a song-bird's shadow flown Past! Death's reverberate blast Now for music's lord has blown Whom thy love held fast. Dead thy king, and void his throne: Yet for grief at last Love makes music of his own Past. PAST DAYS I Dead and gone, the days we had together, Shadow-stricken all the lights that shone Round them, flown as flies the blown foam's feather, Dead and gone. Where we went, we twain, in time foregone, Forth by land and sea, and cared not whether, If I go again, I go alone. Bound am I with time as with a tether; Thee perchance death leads enfranchised on, Far from deathlike life and changeful weather, Dead and gone. II Above the sea and sea-washed town we dwelt, We twain together, two brief summers, free From heed of hours as light as clouds that melt Above the sea. Free from all heed of aught at all were we, Save chance of change that clouds or sunbeams dealt And gleam of heaven to windward or to lee. The Norman downs with bright grey waves for belt Were more for us than inland ways might be; A clearer sense of nearer heaven was felt Above the sea. III Cliffs and downs and headlands which the forward-hasting Flight of dawn and eve empurples and embrowns, Wings of wild sea-winds and stormy seasons wasting Cliffs and downs, These, or ever man was, were: the same sky frowns, Laughs, and lightens, as before his soul, forecasting Times to be, conceived such hopes as time discrowns. These we loved of old: but now for me the blasting Breath of death makes dull the bright small seaward towns, Clothes with human change these all but everlasting Cliffs and downs. AUTUMN AND WINTER I Three months bade wane and wax the wintering moon Between two dates of death, while men were fain Yet of the living light that all too soon Three months bade wane. Cold autumn, wan with wrath of wind and rain, Saw pass a soul sweet as the sovereign tune That death smote silent when he smote again. First went my friend, in life's mid light of noon, Who loved the lord of music: then the strain Whence earth was kindled like as heaven in June Three months bade wane. II A herald soul before its master's flying Touched by some few moons first the darkling goal Where shades rose up to greet the shade, espying A herald soul; Shades of dead lords of music, who control Men living by the might of men undying, With strength of strains that make delight of dole. The deep dense dust on death's dim threshold lying Trembled with sense of kindling sound that stole Through darkness, and the night gave ear, descrying A herald soul. III One went before, one after, but so fast They seem gone hence together, from the shore Whence we now gaze: yet ere the mightier passed One went before; One whose whole heart of love, being set of yore On that high joy which music lends us, cast Light round him forth of music's radiant store. Then went, while earth on winter glared aghast, The mortal god he worshipped, through the door Wherethrough so late, his lover to the last, One went before. IV A star had set an hour before the sun Sank from the skies wherethrough his heart's pulse yet Thrills audibly: but few took heed, or none, A star had set. All heaven rings back, sonorous with regret, The deep dirge of the sunset: how should one Soft star be missed in all the concourse met? But, O sweet single heart whose work is done, Whose songs are silent, how should I forget That ere the sunset's fiery goal was won A star had set? THE DEATH OF RICHARD WAGNER I Mourning on earth, as when dark hours descend, Wide-winged with plagues, from heaven; when hope and mirth Wane, and no lips rebuke or reprehend Mourning on earth. The soul wherein her songs of death and birth, Darkness and light, were wont to sound and blend, Now silent, leaves the whole world less in worth. Winds that make moan and triumph, skies that bend, Thunders, and sound of tides in gulf and firth, Spake through his spirit of speech, whose death should send Mourning on earth. II The world's great heart, whence all things strange and rare Take form and sound, that each inseparate part May bear its burden in all tuned thoughts that share The world's great heart— The fountain forces, whence like steeds that start Leap forth the powers of earth and fire and air, Seas that revolve and rivers that depart— Spake, and were turned to song: yea, all they were, With all their works, found in his mastering art Speech as of powers whose uttered word laid bare The world's great heart. III From the depths of the sea, from the wellsprings of earth, from the wastes of the midmost night, From the fountains of darkness and tempest and thunder, from heights where the soul would be, The spell of the mage of music evoked their sense, as an unknown light From the depths of the sea. As a vision of heaven from the hollows of ocean, that none but a god might see, Rose out of the silence of things unknown of a presence, a form, a might, And we heard as a prophet that hears God's message against him, and may not flee. Eye might not endure it, but ear and heart with a rapture of dark delight, With a terror and wonder whose core was joy, and a passion of thought set free, Felt inly the rising of doom divine as a sundawn risen to sight From the depths of the sea. TWO PRELUDES I LOHENGRIN Love, out of the depth of things, As a dewfall felt from above, From the heaven whence only springs Love, Love, heard from the heights thereof, The clouds and the watersprings, Draws close as the clouds remove. And the soul in it speaks and sings, A swan sweet-souled as a dove, An echo that only rings Love. II TRISTAN UND ISOLDE Fate, out of the deep sea's gloom, When a man's heart's pride grows great, And nought seems now to foredoom Fate, Fate, laden with fears in wait, Draws close through the clouds that loom, Till the soul see, all too late, More dark than a dead world's tomb, More high than the sheer dawn's gate, More deep than the wide sea's womb, Fate. THE LUTE AND THE LYRE Deep desire, that pierces heart and spirit to the root, Finds reluctant voice in verse that yearns like soaring fire, Takes exultant voice when music holds in high pursuit Deep desire. Keen as burns the passion of the rose whose buds respire, Strong as grows the yearning of the blossom toward the fruit, Sounds the secret half unspoken ere the deep tones tire. Slow subsides the rapture that possessed love's flower-soft lute, Slow the palpitation of the triumph of the lyre: Still the soul feels burn, a flame unslaked though these be mute, Deep desire. PLUS INTRA Soul within sense, immeasurable, obscure, Insepulchred and deathless, through the dense Deep elements may scarce be felt as pure Soul within sense. From depth and height by measurers left immense, Through sound and shape and colour, comes the unsure Vague utterance, fitful with supreme suspense. All that may pass, and all that must endure, Song speaks not, painting shows not: more intense And keen than these, art wakes with music's lure Soul within sense. CHANGE But now life's face beholden Seemed bright as heaven's bare brow With hope of gifts withholden But now. From time's full-flowering bough Each bud spake bloom to embolden Love's heart, and seal his vow. Joy's eyes grew deep with olden Dreams, born he wist not how; Thought's meanest garb was golden; But now! A BABY'S DEATH I A little soul scarce fledged for earth Takes wing with heaven again for goal Even while we hailed as fresh from birth A little soul. Our thoughts ring sad as bells that toll, Not knowing beyond this blind world's girth What things are writ in heaven's full scroll. Our fruitfulness is there but dearth, And all things held in time's control Seem there, perchance, ill dreams, not worth A little soul. II The little feet that never trod Earth, never strayed in field or street, What hand leads upward back to God The little feet? A rose in June's most honied heat, When life makes keen the kindling sod, Was not so soft and warm and sweet. Their pilgrimage's period A few swift moons have seen complete Since mother's hands first clasped and shod The little feet. III The little hands that never sought Earth's prizes, worthless all as sands, What gift has death, God's servant, brought The little hands? We ask: but love's self silent stands, Love, that lends eyes and wings to thought To search where death's dim heaven expands. Ere this, perchance, though love know nought, Flowers fill them, grown in lovelier lands, Where hands of guiding angels caught The little hands. IV The little eyes that never knew Light other than of dawning skies, What new life now lights up anew The little eyes? Who knows but on their sleep may rise Such light as never heaven let through To lighten earth from Paradise? No storm, we know, may change the blue Soft heaven that haply death descries; No tears, like these in ours, bedew The little eyes. V Was life so strange, so sad the sky, So strait the wide world's range, He would not stay to wonder why Was life so strange? Was earth's fair house a joyless grange Beside that house on high Whence Time that bore him failed to estrange? That here at once his soul put by All gifts of time and change, And left us heavier hearts to sigh “Was life so strange?” VI Angel by name love called him, seeing so fair The sweet small frame; Meet to be called, if ever man's child were, Angel by name. Rose-bright and warm from heaven's own heart he came, And might not bear The cloud that covers earth's wan face with shame. His little light of life was all too rare And soft a flame: Heaven yearned for him till angels hailed him there Angel by name. VII The song that smiled upon his birthday here Weeps on the grave that holds him undefiled Whose loss makes bitterer than a soundless tear The song that smiled. His name crowned once the mightiest ever styled Sovereign of arts, and angel: fate and fear Knew then their master, and were reconciled. But we saw born beneath some tenderer sphere Michael, an angel and a little child, Whose loss bows down to weep upon his bier The song that smiled. ONE OF TWAIN I One of twain, twin-born with flowers that waken, Now hath passed from sense of sun and rain: Wind from off the flower-crowned branch hath shaken One of twain. One twin flower must pass, and one remain: One, the word said soothly, shall be taken, And another left: can death refrain? Two years since was love's light song mistaken, Blessing then both blossoms, half in vain? Night outspeeding light hath overtaken One of twain. II Night and light? O thou of heart unwary, Love, what knowest thou here at all aright, Lured, abused, misled as men by fairy Night and light? Haply, where thine eyes behold but night, Soft as o'er her babe the smile of Mary Light breaks flowerwise into new-born sight. What though night of light to thee be chary? What though stars of hope like flowers take flight? Seest thou all things here, where all see vary Night and light? DEATH AND BIRTH Death and birth should dwell not near together: Wealth keeps house not, even for shame, with dearth: Fate doth ill to link in one brief tether Death and birth. Harsh the yoke that binds them, strange the girth Seems that girds them each with each: yet whether Death be best, who knows, or life on earth? Ill the rose-red and the sable feather Blend in one crown's plume, as grief with mirth: Ill met still are warm and wintry weather, Death and birth. BIRTH AND DEATH Birth and death, twin-sister and twin-brother, Night and day, on all things that draw breath, Reign, while time keeps friends with one another Birth and death. Each brow-bound with flowers diverse of wreath, Heaven they hail as father, earth as mother, Faithful found above them and beneath. Smiles may lighten tears, and tears may smother Smiles, for all that joy or sorrow saith: Joy nor sorrow knows not from each other Birth and death. BENEDICTION Blest in death and life beyond man's guessing Little children live and die, possest Still of grace that keeps them past expressing Blest. Each least chirp that rings from every nest, Each least touch of flower-soft fingers pressing Aught that yearns and trembles to be prest, Each least glance, gives gift of grace, redressing Grief's worst wrongs: each mother's nurturing breast Feeds a flower of bliss, beyond all blessing Blest. ÉTUDE RÉALISTE I A baby's feet, like sea-shells pink, Might tempt, should heaven see meet, An angel's lips to kiss, we think, A baby's feet. Like rose-hued sea-flowers toward the heat They stretch and spread and wink Their ten soft buds that part and meet. No flower-bells that expand and shrink Gleam half so heavenly sweet As shine on life's untrodden brink A baby's feet. II A baby's hands, like rosebuds furled Whence yet no leaf expands, Ope if you touch, though close upcurled, A baby's hands. Then, fast as warriors grip their brands When battle's bolt is hurled, They close, clenched hard like tightening bands. No rosebuds yet by dawn impearled Match, even in loveliest lands, The sweetest flowers in all the world— A baby's hands. III A baby's eyes, ere speech begin, Ere lips learn words or sighs, Bless all things bright enough to win A baby's eyes. Love, while the sweet thing laughs and lies, And sleep flows out and in, Sees perfect in them Paradise. Their glance might cast out pain and sin, Their speech make dumb the wise, By mute glad godhead felt within A baby's eyes. BABYHOOD I A baby shines as bright If winter or if May be On eyes that keep in sight A baby. Though dark the skies or grey be, It fills our eyes with light, If midnight or midday be. Love hails it, day and night, The sweetest thing that may be, Yet cannot praise aright A baby. II All heaven, in every baby born, All absolute of earthly leaven, Reveals itself, though man may scorn All heaven. Yet man might feel all sin forgiven, All grief appeased, all pain outworn, By this one revelation given. Soul, now forget thy burdens borne: Heart, be thy joys now seven times seven: Love shows in light more bright than morn All heaven. III What likeness may define, and stray not From truth's exactest way, A baby's beauty? Love can say not What likeness may. The Mayflower loveliest held in May Of all that shine and stay not Laughs not in rosier disarray. Sleek satin, swansdown, buds that play not As yet with winds that play, Would fain be matched with this, and may not: What likeness may? IV Rose, round whose bed Dawn's cloudlets close, Earth's brightest-bred Rose! No song, love knows, May praise the head Your curtain shows. Ere sleep has fled, The whole child glows One sweet live red Rose. FIRST FOOTSTEPS A little way, more soft and sweet Than fields aflower with May, A babe's feet, venturing, scarce complete A little way. Eyes full of dawning day Look up for mother's eyes to meet, Too blithe for song to say. Glad as the golden spring to greet Its first live leaflet's play, Love, laughing, leads the little feet A little way. A NINTH BIRTHDAY February 4, 1883. I Three times thrice hath winter's rough white wing Crossed and curdled wells and streams with ice Since his birth whose praises love would sing Three times thrice. Earth nor sea bears flower nor pearl of price Fit to crown the forehead of my king, Honey meet to please him, balm, nor spice. Love can think of nought but love to bring Fit to serve or do him sacrifice Ere his eyes have looked upon the spring Three times thrice. II Three times thrice the world has fallen on slumber, Shone and waned and withered in a trice, Frost has fettered Thames and Tyne and Humber Three times thrice, Fogs have swoln too thick for steel to slice, Cloud and mud have soiled with grime and umber Earth and heaven, defaced as souls with vice, Winds have risen to wreck, snows fallen to cumber, Ships and chariots, trapped like rats or mice, Since my king first smiled, whose years now number Three times thrice. III Three times thrice, in wine of song full-flowing, Pledge, my heart, the child whose eyes suffice, Once beheld, to set thy joy-bells going Three times thrice. Not the lands of palm and date and rice Glow more bright when summer leaves them glowing, Laugh more light when suns and winds entice. Noon and eve and midnight and cock-crowing, Child whose love makes life as paradise, Love should sound your praise with clarions blowing Three times thrice. NOT A CHILD I “Not a child: I call myself a boy,” Says my king, with accent stern yet mild, Now nine years have brought him change of joy; “Not a child.” How could reason be so far beguiled, Err so far from sense's safe employ, Stray so wide of truth, or run so wild? Seeing his face bent over book or toy, Child I called him, smiling: but he smiled Back, as one too high for vain annoy— Not a child. II Not a child? alack the year! What should ail an undefiled Heart, that he would fain appear Not a child? Men, with years and memories piled Each on other, far and near, Fain again would so be styled: Fain would cast off hope and fear, Rest, forget, be reconciled: Why would you so fain be, dear, Not a child? III Child or boy, my darling, which you will, Still your praise finds heart and song employ, Heart and song both yearning toward you still, Child or boy. All joys else might sooner pall or cloy Love than this which inly takes its fill, Dear, of sight of your more perfect joy. Nay, be aught you please, let all fulfil All your pleasure; be your world your toy: Mild or wild we love you, loud or still, Child or boy. TO DORA DORIAN Child of two strong nations, heir Born of high-souled hope that smiled, Seeing for each brought forth a fair Child, By thy gracious brows, and wild Golden-clouded heaven of hair, By thine eyes elate and mild, Hope would fain take heart to swear Men should yet be reconciled, Seeing the sign she bids thee bear, Child. THE ROUNDEL A roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere, With craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought, That the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear A roundel is wrought. Its jewel of music is carven of all or of aught— Love, laughter, or mourning—remembrance of rapture or fear— That fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought. As a bird's quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear Pause answer to pause, and again the same strain caught, So moves the device whence, round as a pearl or tear, A roundel is wrought. AT SEA “Farewell and adieu” was the burden prevailing Long since in the chant of a home-faring crew; And the heart in us echoes, with laughing or wailing, Farewell and adieu. Each year that we live shall we sing it anew, With a water untravelled before us for sailing And a water behind us that wrecks may bestrew. The stars of the past and the beacons are paling, The heavens and the waters are hoarier of hue: But the heart in us chants not an all unavailing Farewell and adieu. WASTED LOVE What shall be done for sorrow With love whose race is run? Where help is none to borrow, What shall be done? In vain his hands have spun The web, or drawn the furrow: No rest their toil hath won. His task is all gone thorough And fruit thereof is none: And who dare say to-morrow What shall be done? BEFORE SUNSET Love's twilight wanes in heaven above, On earth ere twilight reigns: Ere fear may feel the chill thereof, Love's twilight wanes. Ere yet the insatiate heart complains “Too much, and scarce enough,” The lip so late athirst refrains. Soft on the neck of either dove Love's hands let slip the reins: And while we look for light of love Love's twilight wanes. A SINGING LESSON Far-fetched and dear-bought, as the proverb rehearses, Is good, or was held so, for ladies: but nought In a song can be good if the turn of the verse is Far-fetched and dear-bought. As the turn of a wave should it sound, and the thought Ring smooth, and as light as the spray that disperses Be the gleam of the words for the garb thereof wrought. Let the soul in it shine through the sound as it pierces Men's hearts with possession of music unsought; For the bounties of song are no jealous god's mercies, Far-fetched and dear-bought. FLOWER-PIECES I LOVE LIES BLEEDING Love lies bleeding in the bed whereover Roses lean with smiling mouths or pleading: Earth lies laughing where the sun's dart clove her: Love lies bleeding. Stately shine his purple plumes, exceeding Pride of princes: nor shall maid or lover Find on earth a fairer sign worth heeding. Yet may love, sore wounded, scarce recover Strength and spirit again, with life receding: Hope and joy, wind-winged, about him hover: Love lies bleeding. II LOVE IN A MIST Light love in a mist, by the midsummer moon misguided, Scarce seen in the twilight garden if gloom insist, Seems vainly to seek for a star whose gleam has derided Light love in a mist. All day in the sun, when the breezes do all they list, His soft blue raiment of cloudlike blossom abided Unrent and unwithered of winds and of rays that kissed. Blithe-hearted or sad, as the cloud or the sun subsided, Love smiled in the flower with a meaning whereof none wist Save two that beheld, as a gleam that before them glided, Light love in a mist. THREE FACES I VENTIMIGLIA The sky and sea glared hard and bright and blank: Down the one steep street, with slow steps firm and free, A tall girl paced, with eyes too proud to thank The sky and sea. One dead flat sapphire, void of wrath or glee, Through bay on bay shone blind from bank to bank The weary Mediterranean, drear to see. More deep, more living, shone her eyes that drank The breathless light and shed again on me, Till pale before their splendour waned and shrank The sky and sea. II GENOA Again the same strange might of eyes, that saw In heaven and earth nought fairer, overcame My sight with rapture of reiterate awe, Again the same. The self-same pulse of wonder shook like flame The spirit of sense within me: what strange law Had bid this be, for blessing or for blame? To what veiled end that fate or chance foresaw Came forth this second sister face, that came Absolute, perfect, fair without a flaw, Again the same? III VENICE Out of the dark pure twilight, where the stream Flows glimmering, streaked by many a birdlike bark That skims the gloom whence towers and bridges gleam Out of the dark, Once more a face no glance might choose but mark Shone pale and bright, with eyes whose deep slow beam Made quick the twilight, lifeless else and stark. The same it seemed, or mystery made it seem, As those before beholden; but St. Mark Ruled here the ways that showed it like a dream Out of the dark. EROS I Eros, from rest in isles far-famed, With rising Anthesterion rose, And all Hellenic heights acclaimed Eros. The sea one pearl, the shore one rose, All round him all the flower-month flamed And lightened, laughing off repose. Earth's heart, sublime and unashamed, Knew, even perchance as man's heart knows, The thirst of all men's nature named Eros. II Eros, a fire of heart untamed, A light of spirit in sense that glows, Flamed heavenward still ere earth defamed Eros. Nor fear nor shame durst curb or close His golden godhead, marred and maimed, Fast round with bonds that burnt and froze. Ere evil faith struck blind and lamed Love, pure as fire or flowers or snows, Earth hailed as blameless and unblamed Eros. III Eros, with shafts by thousands aimed At laughing lovers round in rows, Fades from their sight whose tongues proclaimed Eros. But higher than transient shapes or shows The light of love in life inflamed Springs, toward no goal that these disclose. Above those heavens which passion claimed Shines, veiled by change that ebbs and flows, The soul in all things born or framed, Eros. SORROW Sorrow, on wing through the world for ever, Here and there for awhile would borrow Rest, if rest might haply deliver Sorrow. One thought lies close in her heart gnawn thorough With pain, a weed in a dried-up river, A rust-red share in an empty furrow. Hearts that strain at her chain would sever The link where yesterday frets to-morrow: All things pass in the world, but never Sorrow. SLEEP Sleep, when a soul that her own clouds cover Wails that sorrow should always keep Watch, nor see in the gloom above her Sleep, Down, through darkness naked and steep, Sinks, and the gifts of his grace recover Soon the soul, though her wound be deep. God beloved of us, all men's lover, All most weary that smile or weep Feel thee afar or anear them hover, Sleep. ON AN OLD ROUNDEL Translated by D. G. Rossetti from the French of Villon. I Death, from thy rigour a voice appealed, And men still hear what the sweet cry saith, Crying aloud in thine ears fast sealed, Death. As a voice in a vision that vanisheth, Through the grave's gate barred and the portal steeled The sound of the wail of it travelleth. Wailing aloud from a heart unhealed, It woke response of melodious breath From lips now too by thy kiss congealed, Death. II Ages ago, from the lips of a sad glad poet Whose soul was a wild dove lost in the whirling snow, The soft keen plaint of his pain took voice to show it Ages ago. So clear, so deep, the divine drear accents flow, No soul that listens may choose but thrill to know it, Pierced and wrung by the passionate music's throe. For us there murmurs a nearer voice below it, Known once of ears that never again shall know, Now mute as the mouth which felt death's wave o'erflow it Ages ago. A LANDSCAPE BY COURBET Low lies the mere beneath the moorside, still And glad of silence: down the wood sweeps clear To the utmost verge where fed with many a rill Low lies the mere. The wind speaks only summer: eye nor ear Sees aught at all of dark, hears aught of shrill, From sound or shadow felt or fancied here. Strange, as we praise the dead man's might and skill, Strange that harsh thoughts should make such heavy cheer, While, clothed with peace by heaven's most gentle will, Low lies the mere. A FLOWER-PIECE BY FANTIN Heart's ease or pansy, pleasure or thought, Which would the picture give us of these? Surely the heart that conceived it sought Heart's ease. Surely by glad and divine degrees The heart impelling the hand that wrought Wrought comfort here for a soul's disease. Deep flowers, with lustre and darkness fraught, From glass that gleams as the chill still seas Lean and lend for a heart distraught Heart's ease. A NIGHT-PIECE BY MILLET Wind and sea and cloud and cloud-forsaking Mirth of moonlight where the storm leaves free Heaven awhile, for all the wrath of waking Wind and sea. Bright with glad mad rapture, fierce with glee, Laughs the moon, borne on past cloud's o'ertaking Fast, it seems, as wind or sail can flee. One blown sail beneath her, hardly making Forth, wild-winged for harbourage yet to be, Strives and leaps and pants beneath the breaking Wind and sea. “MARZO PAZZO” Mad March, with the wind in his wings wide-spread, Leaps from heaven, and the deep dawn's arch Hails re-risen again from the dead Mad March. Soft small flames on rowan and larch Break forth as laughter on lips that said Nought till the pulse in them beat love's march. But the heartbeat now in the lips rose-red Speaks life to the world, and the winds that parch Bring April forth as a bride to wed Mad March. DEAD LOVE Dead love, by treason slain, lies stark, White as a dead stark-stricken dove: None that pass by him pause to mark Dead love. His heart, that strained and yearned and strove As toward the sundawn strives the lark, Is cold as all the old joy thereof. Dead men, re-risen from dust, may hark When rings the trumpet blown above: It will not raise from out the dark Dead love. DISCORD Unreconciled by life's fleet years, that fled With changeful clang of pinions wide and wild, Though two great spirits had lived, and hence had sped Unreconciled; Though time and change, harsh time's imperious child, That wed strange hands together, might not wed High hearts by hope's misprision once beguiled; Faith, by the light from either's memory shed, Sees, radiant as their ends were undefiled, One goal for each—not twain among the dead Unreconciled. CONCORD Reconciled by death's mild hand, that giving Peace gives wisdom, not more strong than mild, Love beholds them, each without misgiving Reconciled. Each on earth alike of earth reviled, Hated, feared, derided, and forgiving, Each alike had heaven at heart, and smiled. Both bright names, clothed round with man's thanksgiving, Shine, twin stars above the storm-drifts piled, Dead and deathless, whom we saw not living Reconciled. MOURNING Alas my brother! the cry of the mourners of old That cried on each other, All crying aloud on the dead as the death-note rolled, Alas my brother! As flashes of dawn that mists from an east wind smother With fold upon fold, The past years gleam that linked us one with another. Time sunders hearts as of brethren whose eyes behold No more their mother: But a cry sounds yet from the shrine whose fires wax cold, Alas my brother! ???????? ???? Strong as death, and cruel as the grave, Clothed with cloud and tempest's blackening breath, Known of death's dread self, whom none outbrave, Strong as death, Love, brow-bound with anguish for a wreath, Fierce with pain, a tyrant-hearted slave, Burns above a world that groans beneath. Hath not pity power on thee to save, Love? hath power no pity? Nought he saith, Answering: blind he walks as wind or wave, Strong as death. TO CATULLUS My brother, my Valerius, dearest head Of all whose crowning bay-leaves crown their mother Rome, in the notes first heard of thine I read My brother. No dust that death or time can strew may smother Love and the sense of kinship inly bred From loves and hates at one with one another. To thee was Cæsar's self nor dear nor dread, Song and the sea were sweeter each than other: How should I living fear to call thee dead, My brother? “INSULARUM OCELLE” Sark, fairer than aught in the world that the lit skies cover, Laughs inly behind her cliffs, and the seafarers mark As a shrine where the sunlight serves, though the blown clouds hover, Sark. We mourn, for love of a song that outsang the lark, That nought so lovely beholden of Sirmio's lover Made glad in Propontis the flight of his Pontic bark. Here earth lies lordly, triumphal as heaven is above her, And splendid and strange as the sea that upbears as an ark, As a sign for the rapture of storm-spent eyes to discover, Sark. IN SARK Abreast and ahead of the sea is a crag's front cloven asunder With strong sea-breach and with wasting of winds whence terror is shed As a shadow of death from the wings of the darkness on waters that thunder Abreast and ahead. At its edge is a sepulchre hollowed and hewn for a lone man's bed, Propped open with rock and agape on the sky and the sea thereunder, But roofed and walled in well from the wrath of them slept its dead. Here might not a man drink rapture of rest, or delight above wonder, Beholding, a soul disembodied, the days and the nights that fled, With splendour and sound of the tempest around and above him and under, Abreast and ahead? IN GUERNSEY TO THEODORE WATTS I The heavenly bay, ringed round with cliffs and moors, Storm-stained ravines, and crags that lawns inlay, Soothes as with love the rocks whose guard secures The heavenly bay. O friend, shall time take ever this away, This blessing given of beauty that endures, This glory shown us, not to pass but stay? Though sight be changed for memory, love ensures What memory, changed by love to sight, would say— The word that seals for ever mine and yours The heavenly bay. II My mother sea, my fostress, what new strand, What new delight of waters, may this be, The fairest found since time's first breezes fanned My mother sea? Once more I give me body and soul to thee, Who hast my soul for ever: cliff and sand Recede, and heart to heart once more are we. My heart springs first and plunges, ere my hand Strike out from shore: more close it brings to me, More near and dear than seems my fatherland, My mother sea. III Across and along, as the bay's breadth opens, and o'er us Wild autumn exults in the wind, swift rapture and strong Impels us, and broader the wide waves brighten before us Across and along. The whole world's heart is uplifted, and knows not wrong; The whole world's life is a chant to the sea-tide's chorus; Are we not as waves of the water, as notes of the song? Like children unworn of the passions and toils that wore us, We breast for a season the breadth of the seas that throng, Rejoicing as they, to be borne as of old they bore us Across and along. IV On Dante's track by some funereal spell Drawn down through desperate ways that lead not back We seem to move, bound forth past flood and fell On Dante's track. The grey path ends: the gaunt rocks gape: the black Deep hollow tortuous night, a soundless shell, Glares darkness: are the fires of old grown slack? Nay, then, what flames are these that leap and swell As 'twere to show, where earth's foundations crack, The secrets of the sepulchres of hell On Dante's track? V By mere men's hands the flame was lit, we know, From heaps of dry waste whin and casual brands: Yet, knowing, we scarce believe it kindled so By mere men's hands. Above, around, high-vaulted hell expands, Steep, dense, a labyrinth walled and roofed with woe, Whose mysteries even itself not understands. The scorn in Farinata's eyes aglow Seems visible in this flame: there Geryon stands: No stage of earth's is here, set forth to show By mere men's hands. VI Night, in utmost noon forlorn and strong, with heart athirst and fasting, Hungers here, barred up for ever, whence as one whom dreams affright Day recoils before the low-browed lintel threatening doom and casting Night. All the reefs and islands, all the lawns and highlands, clothed with light, Laugh for love's sake in their sleep outside: but here the night speaks, blasting Day with silent speech and scorn of all things known from depth to height. Lower than dive the thoughts of spirit-stricken fear in souls forecasting Hell, the deep void seems to yawn beyond fear's reach, and higher than sight Rise the walls and roofs that compass it about with everlasting Night. VII The house accurst, with cursing sealed and signed, Heeds not what storms about it burn and burst: No fear more fearful than its own may find The house accurst. Barren as crime, anhungered and athirst, Blank miles of moor sweep inland, sere and blind, Where summer's best rebukes not winter's worst. The low bleak tower with nought save wastes behind Stares down the abyss whereon chance reared and nursed This type and likeness of the accurst man's mind, The house accurst. VIII Beloved and blest, lit warm with love and fame, The house that had the light of the earth for guest Hears for his name's sake all men hail its name Beloved and blest. This eyrie was the homeless eagle's nest When storm laid waste his eyrie: hence he came Again, when storm smote sore his mother's breast. Bow down men bade us, or be clothed with blame And mocked for madness: worst, they sware, was best: But grief shone here, while joy was one with shame, Beloved and blest. ENVOI Fly, white butterflies, out to sea, Frail pale wings for the winds to try, Small white wings that we scarce can see Fly. Here and there may a chance-caught eye Note in a score of you twain or three Brighter or darker of tinge or dye. Some fly light as a laugh of glee, Some fly soft as a low long sigh: All to the haven where each would be Fly. ATHENS: AN ODE [Str. 1. Ere from under earth again like fire the violet kindle, Ere the holy buds and hoar on olive-branches bloom, Ere the crescent of the last pale month of winter dwindle, Shrink, and fall as falls a dead leaf on the dead month's tomb, Round the hills whose heights the first-born olive-blossom brightened, Round the city brow-bound once with violets like a bride, Up from under earth again a light that long since lightened Breaks, whence all the world took comfort as all time takes pride. Pride have all men in their fathers that were free before them, In the warriors that begat us free-born pride have we: But the fathers of their spirits, how may men adore them, With what rapture may we praise, who bade our souls be free? Sons of Athens born in spirit and truth are all born free men; Most of all, we, nurtured where the north wind holds his reign: Children all we sea-folk of the Salaminian seamen, Sons of them that beat back Persia they that beat back Spain. Since the songs of Greece fell silent, none like ours have risen; Since the sails of Greece fell slack, no ships have sailed like ours; How should we lament not, if her spirit sit in prison? How should we rejoice not, if her wreaths renew their flowers? All the world is sweeter, if the Athenian violet quicken: All the world is brighter, if the Athenian sun return: All things foul on earth wax fainter, by that sun's light stricken: All ill growths are withered, where those fragrant flower-lights burn. All the wandering waves of seas with all their warring waters Roll the record on for ever of the sea-fight there, When the capes were battle's lists, and all the straits were slaughter's, And the myriad Medes as foam-flakes on the scattering air. Ours the lightning was that cleared the north and lit the nations, But the light that gave the whole world light of old was she: Ours an age or twain, but hers are endless generations: All the world is hers at heart, and most of all are we. [Ant. 1. Ye that bear the name about you of her glory, Men that wear the sign of Greeks upon you sealed, Yours is yet the choice to write yourselves in story Sons of them that fought the Marathonian field. Slaves of no man were ye, said your warrior poet, Neither subject unto man as underlings: Yours is now the season here wherein to show it, If the seed ye be of them that knew not kings. If ye be not, swords nor words alike found brittle From the dust of death to raise you shall prevail: Subject swords and dead men's words may stead you little, If their old king-hating heart within you fail. If your spirit of old, and not your bonds, be broken, If the kingless heart be molten in your breasts, By what signs and wonders, by what word or token, Shall ye drive the vultures from your eagles' nests? All the gains of tyrants Freedom counts for losses; Nought of all the work done holds she worth the work, When the slaves whose faith is set on crowns and crosses Drive the Cossack bear against the tiger Turk. Neither cross nor crown nor crescent shall ye bow to, Nought of Araby nor Jewry, priest nor king: As your watchword was of old, so be it now too: As from lips long stilled, from yours let healing spring. Through the fights of old, your battle-cry was healing, And the Saviour that ye called on was the Sun: Dawn by dawn behold in heaven your God, revealing Light from darkness as when Marathon was won. Gods were yours yet strange to Turk or Galilean, Light and Wisdom only then as gods adored: Pallas was your shield, your comforter was Pæan, From your bright world's navel spake the Sun your Lord. [Ep. 1. Though the names be lost, and changed the signs of Light and Wisdom be, By these only shall men conquer, by these only be set free: When the whole world's eye was Athens, these were yours, and theirs were ye. Light was given you of your wisdom, light ye gave the world again: As the sun whose godhead lightened on her soul was Hellas then: Yea, the least of all her children as the chosen of other men. Change your hearts not with your garments, nor your faith with creeds that change: Truth was yours, the truth which time and chance transform not nor estrange: Purer truth nor higher abides not in the reach of time's whole range. Gods are they in all men's memories and for all time's periods, They that hurled the host back seaward which had scourged the sea with rods: Gods for us are all your fathers, even the least of these as gods. In the dark of days the thought of them is with us, strong to save, They that had no lord, and made the Great King lesser than a slave; They that rolled all Asia back on Asia, broken like a wave. No man's men were they, no master's and no God's but these their own: Gods not loved in vain nor served amiss, nor all yet overthrown: Love of country, Freedom, Wisdom, Light, and none save these alone. King by king came up against them, sire and son, and turned to flee: Host on host roared westward, mightier each than each, if more might be: Field to field made answer, clamorous like as wave to wave at sea. Strife to strife responded, loud as rocks to clangorous rocks respond Where the deep rings wreck to seamen held in tempest's thrall and bond, Till when war's bright work was perfect peace as radiant rose beyond: Peace made bright with fruit of battle, stronger made for storm gone down, With the flower of song held heavenward for the violet of her crown Woven about the fragrant forehead of the fostress maiden's town. Gods arose alive on earth from under stroke of human hands: As the hands that wrought them, these are dead, and mixed with time's dead sands: But the godhead of supernal song, though these now stand not, stands. Pallas is not, Phœbus breathes no more in breathing brass or gold: Clytæmnestra towers, Cassandra wails, for ever: Time is bold, But nor heart nor hand hath he to unwrite the scriptures writ of old. Dead the great chryselephantine God, as dew last evening shed: Dust of earth or foam of ocean is the symbol of his head: Earth and ocean shall be shadows when Prometheus shall be dead. [Str. 2. Fame around her warriors living rang through Greece and lightened, Moving equal with their stature, stately with their strength: Thebes and Lacedæmon at their breathing presence brightened, Sense or sound of them filled all the live land's breadth and length. All the lesser tribes put on the pure Athenian fashion, One Hellenic heart was from the mountains to the sea: Sparta's bitter self grew sweet with high half-human passion, And her dry thorns flushed aflower in strait Thermopylæ. Fruitless yet the flowers had fallen, and all the deeds died fruitless, Save that tongues of after men, the children of her peace, Took the tale up of her glories, transient else and rootless, And in ears and hearts of all men left the praise of Greece. Fair the war-time was when still, as beacon answering beacon, Sea to land flashed fight, and thundered note of wrath or cheer; But the strength of noonday night hath power to waste and weaken, Nor may light be passed from hand to hand of year to year If the dying deed be saved not, ere it die for ever, By the hands and lips of men more wise than years are strong; If the soul of man take heed not that the deed die never, Clothed about with purple and gold of story, crowned with song. Still the burning heart of boy and man alike rejoices, Hearing words which made it seem of old for all who sang That their heaven of heavens waxed happier when from free men's voices Well-beloved Harmodius and Aristogeiton rang. Never fell such fragrance from the flower-month's rose-red kirtle As from chaplets on the bright friends' brows who slew their lord: Greener grew the leaf and balmier blew the flower of myrtle When its blossom sheathed the sheer tyrannicidal sword. None so glorious garland crowned the feast Panathenæan As this wreath too frail to fetter fast the Cyprian dove: None so fiery song sprang sunwards annual as the pæan Praising perfect love of friends and perfect country's love. [Ant. 2. Higher than highest of all those heavens wherefrom the starry Song of Homer shone above the rolling fight, Gleams like spring's green bloom on boughs all gaunt and gnarry Soft live splendour as of flowers of foam in flight, Glows a glory of mild-winged maidens upward mounting Sheer through air made shrill with strokes of smooth swift wings Round the rocks beyond foot's reach, past eyesight's counting, Up the cleft where iron wind of winter rings Round a God fast clenched in iron jaws of fetters, Him who culled for man the fruitful flower of fire, Bared the darkling scriptures writ in dazzling letters, Taught the truth of dreams deceiving men's desire, Gave their water-wandering chariot-seats of ocean Wings, and bade the rage of war-steeds champ the rein, Showed the symbols of the wild birds' wheeling motion, Waged for man's sake war with God and all his train. Earth, whose name was also Righteousness, a mother Many-named and single-natured, gave him breath Whence God's wrath could wring but this word and none other— He may smite me, yet he shall not do to death. Him the tongue that sang triumphant while tormented Sang as loud the sevenfold storm that roared erewhile Round the towers of Thebes till wrath might rest contented: Sang the flight from smooth soft-sanded banks of Nile, When like mateless doves that fly from snare or tether Came the suppliants landwards trembling as they trod, And the prayer took wing from all their tongues together— King of kings, most holy of holies, blessed God. But what mouth may chant again, what heart may know it, All the rapture that all hearts of men put on When of Salamis the time-transcending poet Sang, whose hand had chased the Mede at Marathon? [Ep. 2. Darker dawned the song with stormier wings above the watch-fire spread Whence from Ida toward the hill of Hermes leapt the light that said Troy was fallen, a torch funereal for the king's triumphal head. Dire indeed the birth of Leda's womb that had God's self to sire Bloomed, a flower of love that stung the soul with fangs that gnaw like fire: But the twin-born human-fathered sister-flower bore fruit more dire. Scarce the cry that called on airy heaven and all swift winds on wing, Wells of river-heads, and countless laugh of waves past reckoning, Earth which brought forth all, and the orbèd sun that looks on everything, Scarce that cry fills yet men's hearts more full of heart-devouring dread Than the murderous word said mocking, how the child whose blood he shed Might clasp fast and kiss her father where the dead salute the dead. But the latter note of anguish from the lips that mocked her lord, When her son's hand bared against the breast that suckled him his sword, How might man endure, O Æschylus, to hear it and record? How might man endure, being mortal yet, O thou most highest, to hear? How record, being born of woman? Surely not thy Furies near, Surely this beheld, this only, blasted hearts to death with fear. Not the hissing hair, nor flakes of blood that oozed from eyes of fire, Nor the snort of savage sleep that snuffed the hungering heart's desire Where the hunted prey found hardly space and harbour to respire; She whose likeness called them—“Sleep ye, ho? what need of you that sleep?” (Ah, what need indeed, where she was, of all shapes that night may keep Hidden dark as death and deeper than men's dreams of hell are deep?) She the murderess of her husband, she the huntress of her son, More than ye was she, the shadow that no God withstands but one, Wisdom equal-eyed and stronger and more splendid than the sun. Yea, no God may stand betwixt us and the shadows of our deeds, Nor the light of dreams that lighten darkness, nor the prayer that pleads, But the wisdom equal-souled with heaven, the light alone that leads. Light whose law bids home those childless children of eternal night, Soothed and reconciled and mastered and transmuted in men's sight Who behold their own souls, clothed with darkness once, now clothed with light. King of kings and father crowned of all our fathers crowned of yore, Lord of all the lords of song, whose head all heads bow down before, Glory be to thee from all thy sons in all tongues evermore. [Str. 3. Rose and vine and olive and deep ivy-bloom entwining Close the goodliest grave that e'er they closeliest might entwine Keep the wind from wasting and the sun from too strong shining Where the sound and light of sweetest songs still float and shine. Here the music seems to illume the shade, the light to whisper Song, the flowers to put not odours only forth, but words Sweeter far than fragrance: here the wandering wreaths twine crisper Far, and louder far exults the note of all wild birds. Thoughts that change us, joys that crown and sorrows that enthrone us, Passions that enrobe us with a clearer air than ours, Move and breathe as living things beheld round white Colonus, Audibler than melodies and visibler than flowers. Love, in fight unconquered, Love, with spoils of great men laden, Never sang so sweet from throat of woman or of dove: Love, whose bed by night is in the soft cheeks of a maiden, And his march is over seas, and low roofs lack not Love; Nor may one of all that live, ephemeral or eternal, Fly nor hide from Love; but whoso clasps him fast goes mad. Never since the first-born year with flowers first-born grew vernal Such a song made listening hearts of lovers glad or sad. Never sounded note so radiant at the rayless portal Opening wide on the all-concealing lowland of the dead As the music mingling, when her doomsday marked her mortal, From her own and old men's voices round the bride's way shed, Round the grave her bride-house, hewn for endless habitation, Where, shut out from sunshine, with no bridegroom by, she slept; But beloved of all her dark and fateful generation, But with all time's tears and praise besprinkled and bewept: Well-beloved of outcast father and self-slaughtered mother, Born, yet unpolluted, of their blind incestuous bed; Best-beloved of him for whose dead sake she died, her brother, Hallowing by her own life's gift her own born brother's head; [Ant. 3. Not with wine or oil nor any less libation Hallowed, nor made sweet with humbler perfume's breath; Not with only these redeemed from desecration, But with blood and spirit of life poured forth to death; Blood unspotted, spirit unsullied, life devoted, Sister too supreme to make the bride's hope good, Daughter too divine as woman to be noted, Spouse of only death in mateless maidenhood. Yea, in her was all the prayer fulfilled, the saying All accomplished—Would that fate would let me wear Hallowed innocence of words and all deeds, weighing Well the laws thereof, begot on holier air, Far on high sublimely stablished, whereof only Heaven is father; nor did birth of mortal mould Bring them forth, nor shall oblivion lull to lonely Slumber. Great in these is God, and grows not old. Therefore even that inner darkness where she perished Surely seems as holy and lovely, seen aright, As desirable and as dearly to be cherished, As the haunt closed in with laurels from the light, Deep inwound with olive and wild vine inwoven, Where a godhead known and unknown makes men pale, But the darkness of the twilight noon is cloven Still with shrill sweet moan of many a nightingale. Closer clustering there they make sweet noise together, Where the fearful gods look gentler than our fear, And the grove thronged through with birds of holiest feather Grows nor pale nor dumb with sense of dark things near. There her father, called upon with signs of wonder, Passed with tenderest words away by ways unknown, Not by sea-storm stricken down, nor touched of thunder, To the dark benign deep underworld, alone. [Ep. 3. Third of three that ruled in Athens, kings with sceptral song for staff, Gladdest heart that God gave ever milk and wine of thought to quaff, Clearest eye that lightened ever to the broad lip's lordliest laugh, Praise be thine as theirs whose tragic brows the loftier leaf engirds For the live and lyric lightning of thy honey-hearted words, Soft like sunny dewy wings of clouds and bright as crying of birds; Full of all sweet rays and notes that make of earth and air and sea One great light and sound of laughter from one great God's heart, to be Sign and semblance of the gladness of man's life where men breathe free. With no Loxian sound obscure God uttered once, and all time heard, All the soul of Athens, all the soul of England, in that word: Rome arose the second child of freedom: northward rose the third. Ere her Boreal dawn came kindling seas afoam and fields of snow, Yet again, while Europe groaned and grovelled, shone like suns aglow Doria splendid over Genoa, Venice bright with Dandolo. Dead was Hellas, but Ausonia by the light of dead men's deeds Rose and walked awhile alive, though mocked as whom the fen-fire leads By the creed-wrought faith of faithless souls that mock their doubts with creeds. Dead are these, and man is risen again: and haply now the three Yet coequal and triune may stand in story, marked as free By the token of the washing of the waters of the sea. Athens first of all earth's kindred many-tongued and many-kinned Had the sea to friend and comfort, and for kinsman had the wind: She that bare Columbus next: then she that made her spoil of Ind. She that hears not what man's rage but only what the sea-wind saith: She that turned Spain's ships to cloud-wrack at the blasting of her breath, By her strengths of strong-souled children and of strong winds done to death. North and south the Great King's galleons went in Persian wise: and here She, with Æschylean music on her lips that laughed back fear, In the face of Time's grey godhead shook the splendour of her spear. Fair as Athens then with foot upon her foeman's front, and strong Even as Athens for redemption of the world from sovereign wrong, Like as Athens crowned she stood before the sun with crowning song. All the world is theirs with whom is freedom: first of all the free, Blest are they whom song has crowned and clothed with blessing: these as we, These alone have part in spirit with the sun that crowns the sea. April 1881. THE STATUE OF VICTOR HUGO 1 Since in Athens God stood plain for adoration, Since the sun beheld his likeness reared in stone, Since the bronze or gold of human consecration Gave to Greece her guardian's form and feature shown, Never hand of sculptor, never heart of nation, Found so glorious aim in all these ages flown As is theirs who rear for all time's acclamation Here the likeness of our mightiest and their own. 2 Theirs and ours and all men's living who behold him Crowned with garlands multiform and manifold; Praise and thanksgiving of all mankind enfold him Who for all men casts abroad his gifts of gold. With the gods of song have all men's tongues enrolled him, With the helpful gods have all men's hearts enrolled: Ours he is who love him, ours whose hearts' hearts hold him Fast as his the trust that hearts like his may hold. 3 He, the heart most high, the spirit on earth most blameless, Takes in charge all spirits, holds all hearts in trust: As the sea-wind's on the sea his ways are tameless, As the laws that steer the world his works are just. All most noble feel him nobler, all most shameless Feel his wrath and scorn make pale their pride and lust: All most poor and lowliest, all whose wrongs were nameless, Feel his word of comfort raise them from the dust. 4 Pride of place and lust of empire bloody-fruited Knew the blasting of his breath on leaf and fruit: Now the hand that smote the death-tree now disrooted Plants the refuge-tree that has man's hope for root. Ah, but we by whom his darkness was saluted, How shall now all we that see his day salute? How should love not seem by love's own speech confuted, Song before the sovereign singer not be mute? 5 With what worship, by what blessing, in what measure, May we sing of him, salute him, or adore, With what hymn for praise, what thanksgiving for pleasure, Who had given us more than heaven, and gives us more? Heaven's whole treasury, filled up full with night's whole treasure, Holds not so divine or deep a starry store As the soul supreme that deals forth worlds at leisure Clothed with light and darkness, dense with flower and ore. 6 Song had touched the bourn: fresh verses overflow it, Loud and radiant, waves on waves on waves that throng; Still the tide grows, and the sea-mark still below it Sinks and shifts and rises, changed and swept along. Rose it like a rock? the waters overthrow it, And another stands beyond them sheer and strong: Goal by goal pays down its prize, and yields its poet Tribute claimed of triumph, palm achieved of song. 7 Since his hand that holds the keys of fear and wonder Opened on the high priest's dreaming eyes a door Whence the lights of heaven and hell above and under Shone, and smote the face that men bow down before, Thrice again one singer's note had cloven in sunder Night, who blows again not one blast now but four, And the fourfold heaven is kindled with his thunder, And the stars about his forehead are fourscore. 8 From the deep soul's depths where alway love abounded First had risen a song with healing on its wings Whence the dews of mercy raining balms unbounded Shed their last compassion even on sceptred things. La Pitié Suprême. 1879. Even on heads that like a curse the crown surrounded Fell his crowning pity, soft as cleansing springs; And the sweet last note his wrath relenting sounded Bade men's hearts be melted not for slaves but kings. 9 Next, that faith might strengthen fear and love embolden, On the creeds of priests a scourge of sunbeams fell: And its flash made bare the deeps of heaven, beholden Not of men that cry, Lord, Lord, from church or cell. Religions et Religion. 1880. Hope as young as dawn from night obscure and olden Rose again, such power abides in truth's one spell: Night, if dawn it be that touches her, grows golden; Tears, if such as angels weep, extinguish hell. 10 Through the blind loud mills of barren blear-eyed learning Where in dust and darkness children's foreheads bow, While men's labour, vain as wind or water turning Wheels and sails of dreams, makes life a leafless bough, Fell the light of scorn and pity touched with yearning, Next, from words that shone as heaven's own kindling brow.

Le Livre épique. 1881. 11 Now the voice that faints not till all wrongs be wroken Sounds as might the sun's song from the morning's breast, All the seals of silence sealed of night are broken, All the winds that bear the fourfold word are blest. All the keen fierce east flames forth one fiery token; All the north is loud with life that knows not rest, All the south with song as though the stars had spoken; All the judgment-fire of sunset scathes the west. 12 Sound of pæan, roll of chanted panegyric, Though by Pindar's mouth song's trumpet spake forth praise, March of warrior songs in Pythian mood or Pyrrhic, Though the blast were blown by lips of ancient days, Ring not clearer than the clarion of satiric Song whose breath sweeps bare the plague-infected ways Till the world be pure as heaven is for the lyric Sun to rise up clothed with radiant sounds as rays. 13 Clear across the cloud-rack fluctuant and erratic As the strong star smiles that lets no mourner mourn, Hymned alike from lips of Lesbian choirs or Attic Once at evensong and morning newly born, Clear and sure above the changes of dramatic Tide and current, soft with love and keen with scorn, Smiles the strong sweet soul of maidenhood, ecstatic And inviolate as the red glad mouth of morn. 14 Pure and passionate as dawn, whose apparition Thrills with fire from heaven the wheels of hours that whirl, Rose and passed her radiance in serene transition From his eyes who sought a grain and found a pearl. But the food by cunning hope for vain fruition Lightly stolen away from keeping of a churl Left the bitterness of death and hope's perdition On the lip that scorn was wont for shame to curl. Les Deux Trouvailles de Gallus. I. Margarita, comédie. II. Esca, drame. 15 Over waves that darken round the wave-worn rover Rang his clarion higher than winds cried round the ship, Rose a pageant of set suns and storms blown over, Hands that held life's guerdons fast or let them slip. But no tongue may tell, no thanksgiving discover, Half the heaven of blessing, soft with clouds that drip, Keen with beams that kindle, dear as love to lover, Opening by the spell's strength on his lyric lip. 16 By that spell the soul transfigured and dilated Puts forth wings that widen, breathes a brightening air, Feeds on light and drinks of music, whence elated All her sense grows godlike, seeing all depths made bare, All the mists wherein before she sat belated Shrink, till now the sunlight knows not if they were; All this earth transformed is Eden recreated, With the breath of heaven remurmuring in her hair. 17 Sweeter far than aught of sweet that April nurses Deep in dew-dropt woodland folded fast and furled Breathes the fragrant song whose burning dawn disperses Darkness, like the surge of armies backward hurled, Even as though the touch of spring's own hand, that pierces Earth with life's delight, had hidden in the impearled Golden bells and buds and petals of his verses All the breath of all the flowers in all the world. 18 But the soul therein, the light that our souls follow, Fires and fills the song with more of prophet's pride, More of life than all the gulfs of death may swallow, More of flame than all the might of night may hide. Though the whole dark age were loud and void and hollow, Strength of trust were here, and help for all souls tried, And a token from the flight of that strange swallow Je suis une hirondelle étrange, car j'émigre Du côté de l'hiver. Le Livre Lyrique, liii. Whose migration still is toward the wintry side 19 Never came such token for divine solution From the oraculous live darkness whence of yore Ancient faith sought word of help and retribution, Truth to lighten doubt, a sign to go before. Never so baptismal waters of ablution Bathed the brows of exile on so stern a shore, Where the lightnings of the sea of revolution Flashed across them ere its thunders yet might roar. 20 By the lightning's light of present revelation Shown, with epic thunder as from skies that frown, Clothed in darkness as of darkling expiation, Rose a vision of dead stars and suns gone down, Whence of old fierce fire devoured the star-struck nation, Till its wrath and woe lit red the raging town, Now made glorious with his statue's crowning station, Where may never gleam again a viler crown. 21 King, with time for throne and all the years for pages, He shall reign though all thrones else be overhurled, Served of souls that have his living words for wages, Crowned of heaven each dawn that leaves his brows impearled; Girt about with robes unrent of storm that rages, Robes not wrought with hands, from no loom's weft unfurled; All the praise of all earth's tongues in all earth's ages, All the love of all men's hearts in all the world. 22 Yet what hand shall carve the soul or cast the spirit, Mould the face of fame, bid glory's feature glow? Who bequeath for eyes of ages hence to inherit Him, the Master, whom love knows not if it know? Scarcely perfect praise of men man's work might merit, Scarcely bid such aim to perfect stature grow, Were his hand the hand of Phidias who shall rear it, And his soul the very soul of Angelo. 23 Michael, awful angel of the world's last session, Once on earth, like him, with fire of suffering tried, Thine it were, if man's it were, without transgression, Thine alone, to take this toil upon thy pride. Thine, whose heart was great against the world's oppression, Even as his whose word is lamp and staff and guide: Advocate for man, untired of intercession, Pleads his voice for slaves whose lords his voice defied. 24 Earth, with all the kings and thralls on earth, below it, Heaven alone, with all the worlds in heaven, above, Let his likeness rise for suns and stars to know it, High for men to worship, plain for men to love: Brow that braved the tides which fain would overflow it, Lip that gave the challenge, hand that flung the glove; Comforter and prophet, Paraclete and poet, Soul whose emblems are an eagle and a dove. 25 Sun, that hast not seen a loftier head wax hoary, Earth, which hast not shown the sun a nobler birth, Time, that hast not on thy scroll defiled and gory One man's name writ brighter in its whole wide girth, Witness, till the final years fulfil their story, Till the stars break off the music of their mirth, What among the sons of men was this man's glory, What the vesture of his soul revealed on earth. SONNETS HOPE AND FEAR Beneath the shadow of dawn's aerial cope, With eyes enkindled as the sun's own sphere, Hope from the front of youth in godlike cheer Looks Godward, past the shades where blind men grope Round the dark door that prayers nor dreams can ope, And makes for joy the very darkness dear That gives her wide wings play; nor dreams that fear At noon may rise and pierce the heart of hope. Then, when the soul leaves off to dream and yearn, May truth first purge her eyesight to discern What once being known leaves time no power to appal; Till youth at last, ere yet youth be not, learn The kind wise word that falls from years that fall— “Hope thou not much, and fear thou not at all.” AFTER SUNSET “Si quis piorum Manibus locus.” I Straight from the sun's grave in the deep clear west A sweet strong wind blows, glad of life: and I, Under the soft keen stardawn whence the sky Takes life renewed, and all night's godlike breast Palpitates, gradually revealed at rest By growth and change of ardours felt on high, Make onward, till the last flame fall and die And all the world by night's broad hand lie blest. Haply, meseems, as from that edge of death, Whereon the day lies dark, a brightening breath Blows more of benediction than the morn, So from the graves whereon grief gazing saith That half our heart of life there lies forlorn May light or breath at least of hope be born. II The wind was soft before the sunset fled: Now, while the cloud-enshrouded corpse of day Is lowered along a red funereal way Down to the dark that knows not white from red, A clear sheer breeze against the night makes head, Serene, but sure of life as ere a ray Springs, or the dusk of dawn knows red from grey, Being as a soul that knows not quick from dead. From far beyond the sunset, far above, Full toward the starry soundless east it blows Bright as a child's breath breathing on a rose, Smooth to the sense as plume of any dove; Till more and more as darkness grows and glows Silence and night seem likest life and love. III If light of life outlive the set of sun That men call death and end of all things, then How should not that which life held best for men And proved most precious, though it seem undone By force of death and woful victory won, Be first and surest of revival, when Death shall bow down to life arisen again? So shall the soul seen be the self-same one That looked and spake with even such lips and eyes As love shall doubt not then to recognise, And all bright thoughts and smiles of all time past Revive, transfigured, but in spirit and sense None other than we knew, for evidence That love's last mortal word was not his last. A STUDY FROM MEMORY If that be yet a living soul which here Seemed brighter for the growth of numbered springs And clothed by Time and Pain with goodlier things Each year it saw fulfilled a fresh fleet year, Death can have changed not aught that made it dear; Half humorous goodness, grave-eyed mirth on wings Bright-balanced, blither-voiced than quiring strings; Most radiant patience, crowned with conquering cheer; A spirit inviolable that smiled and sang By might of nature and heroic need More sweet and strong than loftiest dream or deed; A song that shone, a light whence music rang High as the sunniest heights of kindliest thought; All these must be, or all she was be nought. TO DR. JOHN BROWN Beyond the north wind lay the land of old Where men dwelt blithe and blameless, clothed and fed With joy's bright raiment and with love's sweet bread, The whitest flock of earth's maternal fold. None there might wear about his brows enrolled A light of lovelier fame than rings your head, Whose lovesome love of children and the dead All men give thanks for: I far off behold A dear dead hand that links us, and a light The blithest and benignest of the night, The night of death's sweet sleep, wherein may be A star to show your spirit in present sight Some happier island in the Elysian sea Where Rab may lick the hand of Marjorie. March 1882. TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT The larks are loud above our leagues of whin Now the sun's perfume fills their glorious gold With odour like the colour: all the wold Is only light and song and wind wherein These twain are blent in one with shining din. And now your gift, a giver's kingly-souled, Dear old fast friend whose honours grow not old, Bids memory's note as loud and sweet begin. Though all but we from life be now gone forth Of that bright household in our joyous north Where I, scarce clear of boyhood just at end, First met your hand; yet under life's clear dome, Now seventy strenuous years have crowned my friend, Shines no less bright his full-sheaved harvest-home. April 20, 1882. A DEATH ON EASTER DAY The strong spring sun rejoicingly may rise, Rise and make revel, as of old men said, Like dancing hearts of lovers newly wed: A light more bright than ever bathed the skies Departs for all time out of all men's eyes. The crowns that girt last night a living head Shine only now, though deathless, on the dead: Art that mocks death, and Song that never dies. Albeit the bright sweet mothlike wings be furled, Hope sees, past all division and defection, And higher than swims the mist of human breath, The soul most radiant once in all the world Requickened to regenerate resurrection Out of the likeness of the shadow of death. April 1882. ON THE DEATHS OF THOMAS CARLYLE AND GEORGE ELIOT Two souls diverse out of our human sight Pass, followed one with love and each with wonder: The stormy sophist with his mouth of thunder, Clothed with loud words and mantled in the might Of darkness and magnificence of night; And one whose eye could smite the night in sunder, Searching if light or no light were thereunder, And found in love of loving-kindness light. Duty divine and Thought with eyes of fire Still following Righteousness with deep desire Shone sole and stern before her and above, Sure stars and sole to steer by; but more sweet Shone lower the loveliest lamp for earthly feet, The light of little children, and their love. AFTER LOOKING INTO CARLYLE'S REMINISCENCES I Three men lived yet when this dead man was young Whose names and words endure for ever: one Whose eyes grew dim with straining toward the sun, And his wings weakened, and his angel's tongue Lost half the sweetest song was ever sung, But like the strain half uttered earth hears none, Nor shall man hear till all men's songs are done: One whose clear spirit like an eagle hung Between the mountains hallowed by his love And the sky stainless as his soul above: And one the sweetest heart that ever spake The brightest words wherein sweet wisdom smiled. These deathless names by this dead snake defiled Bid memory spit upon him for their sake. II Sweet heart, forgive me for thine own sweet sake, Whose kind blithe soul such seas of sorrow swam, And for my love's sake, powerless as I am For love to praise thee, or like thee to make Music of mirth where hearts less pure would break, Less pure than thine, our life-unspotted Lamb. Things hatefullest thou hadst not heart to damn, Nor wouldst have set thine heel on this dead snake. Let worms consume its memory with its tongue, The fang that stabbed fair Truth, the lip that stung Men's memories uncorroded with its breath. Forgive me, that with bitter words like his I mix the gentlest English name that is, The tenderest held of all that know not death. A LAST LOOK Sick of self-love, Malvolio, like an owl That hoots the sun rerisen where starlight sank, With German garters crossed athwart thy frank Stout Scottish legs, men watched thee snarl and scowl, And boys responsive with reverberate howl Shrilled, hearing how to thee the springtime stank And as thine own soul all the world smelt rank And as thine own thoughts Liberty seemed foul. Now, for all ill thoughts nursed and ill words given Not all condemned, not utterly forgiven, Son of the storm and darkness, pass in peace. Peace upon earth thou knewest not: now, being dead, Rest, with nor curse nor blessing on thine head, Where high-strung hate and strenuous envy cease. DICKENS Chief in thy generation born of men Whom English praise acclaimed as English-born, With eyes that matched the worldwide eyes of morn For gleam of tears or laughter, tenderest then When thoughts of children warmed their light, or when Reverence of age with love and labour worn, Or godlike pity fired with godlike scorn, Shot through them flame that winged thy swift live pen: Where stars and suns that we behold not burn, Higher even than here, though highest was here thy place, Love sees thy spirit laugh and speak and shine With Shakespeare and the soft bright soul of Sterne And Fielding's kindliest might and Goldsmith's grace; Scarce one more loved or worthier love than thine. ON LAMB'S SPECIMENS OF DRAMATIC POETS I If all the flowers of all the fields on earth By wonder-working summer were made one, Its fragrance were not sweeter in the sun, Its treasure-house of leaves were not more worth Than those wherefrom thy light of musing mirth Shone, till each leaf whereon thy pen would run Breathed life, and all its breath was benison. Beloved beyond all names of English birth, More dear than mightier memories; gentlest name That ever clothed itself with flower-sweet fame, Or linked itself with loftiest names of old By right and might of loving; I, that am Less than the least of those within thy fold, Give only thanks for them to thee, Charles Lamb. II So many a year had borne its own bright bees And slain them since thy honey-bees were hived, John Day, in cells of flower-sweet verse contrived So well with craft of moulding melodies, Thy soul perchance in amaranth fields at ease Thought not to hear the sound on earth revived Of summer music from the spring derived When thy song sucked the flower of flowering trees. But thine was not the chance of every day: Time, after many a darkling hour, grew sunny, And light between the clouds ere sunset swam, Laughing, and kissed their darkness all away, When, touched and tasted and approved, thy honey Took subtler sweetness from the lips of Lamb. TO JOHN NICHOL I Friend of the dead, and friend of all my days Even since they cast off boyhood, I salute The song saluting friends whose songs are mute With full burnt-offerings of clear-spirited praise. That since our old young years our several ways Have led through fields diverse of flower and fruit, Yet no cross wind has once relaxed the root We set long since beneath the sundawn's rays, The root of trust whence towered the trusty tree, Friendship—this only and duly might impel My song to salutation of your own; More even than praise of one unseen of me And loved—the starry spirit of Dobell, To mine by light and music only known. II But more than this what moves me most of all To leave not all unworded and unsped The whole heart's greeting of my thanks unsaid Scarce needs this sign, that from my tongue should fall His name whom sorrow and reverent love recall, The sign to friends on earth of that dear head Alive, which now long since untimely dead The wan grey waters covered for a pall. Their trustless reaches dense with tangling stems Took never life more taintless of rebuke, More pure and perfect, more serene and kind, Than when those clear eyes closed beneath the Thames, And made the now more hallowed name of Luke Memorial to us of morning left behind. May 1881. DYSTHANATOS Ad generem Cereris sine cœde et vulnere pauci Descendunt reges, aut siccâ morte tyranni. By no dry death another king goes down The way of kings. Yet may no free man's voice, For stern compassion and deep awe, rejoice That one sign more is given against the crown, That one more head those dark red waters drown Which rise round thrones whose trembling equipoise Is propped on sand and bloodshed and such toys As human hearts that shrink at human frown. The name writ red on Polish earth, the star That was to outshine our England's in the far East heaven of empire—where is one that saith Proud words now, prophesying of this White Czar? “In bloodless pangs few kings yield up their breath, Few tyrants perish by no violent death.” March 14, 1881. EUONYMOS ?? ??? ? ????? ?????? ????????? ???? ?? ????? ????? ???? ????? ???? ???? ???????. A year ago red wrath and keen despair Spake, and the sole word from their darkness sent Laid low the lord not all omnipotent Who stood most like a god of all that were As gods for pride of power, till fire and air Made earth of all his godhead. Lightning rent The heart of empire's lurid firmament, And laid the mortal core of manhood bare. But when the calm crowned head that all revere For valour higher than that which casts out fear, Since fear came near it never, comes near death, Blind murder cowers before it, knowing that here No braver soul drew bright and queenly breath Since England wept upon Elizabeth. March 8, 1882. ON THE RUSSIAN PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS O son of man, by lying tongues adored, By slaughterous hands of slaves with feet red-shod In carnage deep as ever Christian trod Profaned with prayer and sacrifice abhorred And incense from the trembling tyrant's horde, Brute worshippers or wielders of the rod, Most murderous even of all that call thee God, Most treacherous even that ever called thee Lord; Face loved of little children long ago, Head hated of the priests and rulers then, If thou see this, or hear these hounds of thine Run ravening as the Gadarean swine, Say, was not this thy Passion, to foreknow In death's worst hour the works of Christian men? January 23, 1882. BISMARCK AT CANOSSA Not all disgraced, in that Italian town, The imperial German cowered beneath thine hand, Alone indeed imperial Hildebrand, And felt thy foot and Rome's, and felt her frown And thine, more strong and sovereign than his crown, Though iron forged its blood-encrusted band. But now the princely wielder of his land, For hatred's sake toward freedom, so bows down, No strength is in the foot to spurn: its tread Can bruise not now the proud submitted head: But how much more abased, much lower brought low, And more intolerably humiliated, The neck submissive of the prosperous foe, Than his whom scorn saw shuddering in the snow! December 31, 1881. QUIA NOMINOR LEO I What part is left thee, lion? Ravenous beast, Which hadst the world for pasture, and for scope And compass of thine homicidal hope The kingdom of the spirit of man, the feast Of souls subdued from west to sunless east, From blackening north to bloodred south aslope, All servile; earth for footcloth of the pope, And heaven for chancel-ceiling of the priest; Thou that hadst earth by right of rack and rod, Thou that hadst Rome because thy name was God, And by thy creed's gift heaven wherein to dwell; Heaven laughs with all his light and might above That earth has cast thee out of faith and love; Thy part is but the hollow dream of hell. II The light of life has faded from thy cause, High priest of heaven and hell and purgatory: Thy lips are loud with strains of oldworld story, But the red prey was rent out of thy paws Long since: and they that dying brake down thy laws Have with the fires of death-enkindled glory Put out the flame that faltered on thy hoary High altars, waning with the world's applause. This Italy was Dante's: Bruno died Here: Campanella, too sublime for pride, Endured thy God's worst here, and hence went home. And what art thou, that time's full tide should shrink For thy sake downward? What art thou, to think Thy God shall give thee back for birthright Rome? January 1882. THE CHANNEL TUNNEL Not for less love, all glorious France, to thee, “Sweet enemy” called in days long since at end, Now found and hailed of England sweeter friend, Bright sister of our freedom now, being free; Not for less love or faith in friendship we Whose love burnt ever toward thee reprehend The vile vain greed whose pursy dreams portend Between our shores suppression of the sea. Not by dull toil of blind mechanic art Shall these be linked for no man's force to part Nor length of years and changes to divide, But union only of trust and loving heart And perfect faith in freedom strong to abide And spirit at one with spirit on either side. April 3, 1882. SIR WILLIAM GOMM I At threescore years and five aroused anew To rule in India, forth a soldier went On whose bright-fronted youth fierce war had spent Its iron stress of storm, till glory grew Full as the red sun waned on Waterloo. Landing, he met the word from England sent Which bade him yield up rule: and he, content, Resigned it, as a mightier warrior's due; And wrote as one rejoicing to record That “from the first” his royal heart was lord Of its own pride or pain; that thought was none Therein save this, that in her perilous strait England, whose womb brings forth her sons so great, Should choose to serve her first her mightiest son. II Glory beyond all flight of warlike fame Go with the warrior's memory who preferred To praise of men whereby men's hearts are stirred, And acclamation of his own proud name With blare of trumpet-blasts and sound and flame Of pageant honour, and the titular word That only wins men worship of the herd, His country's sovereign good; who overcame Pride, wrath, and hope of all high chance on earth, For this land's love that gave his great heart birth. O nursling of the sea-winds and the sea, Immortal England, goddess ocean-born, What shall thy children fear, what strengths not scorn, While children of such mould are born to thee? EUTHANATOS In memory of Mrs. Thellusson Forth of our ways and woes, Forth of the winds and snows, A white soul soaring goes, Winged like a dove: So sweet, so pure, so clear, So heavenly tempered here, Love need not hope or fear her changed above: Ere dawned her day to die, So heavenly, that on high Change could not glorify Nor death refine her: Pure gold of perfect love, On earth like heaven's own dove, She cannot wear, above, a smile diviner. Her voice in heaven's own quire Can sound no heavenlier lyre Than here: no purer fire Her soul can soar: No sweeter stars her eyes In unimagined skies Beyond our sight can rise than here before. Hardly long years had shed Their shadows on her head: Hardly we think her dead, Who hardly thought her Old: hardly can believe The grief our hearts receive And wonder while they grieve, as wrong were wrought her. But though strong grief be strong No word or thought of wrong May stain the trembling song, Wring the bruised heart, That sounds or sighs its faint Low note of love, nor taint Grief for so sweet a saint, when such depart. A saint whose perfect soul, With perfect love for goal, Faith hardly might control, Creeds might not harden: A flower more splendid far Than the most radiant star Seen here of all that are in God's own garden. Surely the stars we see Rise and relapse as we, And change and set, may be But shadows too: But spirits that man's lot Could neither mar nor spot Like these false lights are not, being heavenly true. Not like these dying lights Of worlds whose glory smites The passage of the nights Through heaven's blind prison: Not like their souls who see, If thought fly far and free, No heavenlier heaven to be for souls rerisen. A soul wherein love shone Even like the sun, alone, With fervour of its own And splendour fed, Made by no creeds less kind Toward souls by none confined, Could Death's self quench or blind, Love's self were dead. February 4, 1881. FIRST AND LAST Upon the borderlands of being, Where life draws hardly breath Between the lights and shadows fleeing Fast as a word one saith, Two flowers rejoice our eyesight, seeing The dawns of birth and death. Behind the babe his dawn is lying Half risen with notes of mirth From all the winds about it flying Through new-born heaven and earth: Before bright age his day for dying Dawns equal-eyed with birth. Equal the dews of even and dawn, Equal the sun's eye seen A hand's breadth risen and half withdrawn: But no bright hour between Brings aught so bright by stream or lawn To noonday growths of green. Which flower of life may smell the sweeter To love's insensual sense, Which fragrance move with offering meeter His soothed omnipotence, Being chosen as fairer or as fleeter, Borne hither or borne hence, Love's foiled omniscience knows not: this Were more than all he knows With all his lore of bale and bliss, The choice of rose and rose, One red as lips that touch with his, One white as moonlit snows. No hope is half so sweet and good, No dream of saint or sage So fair as these are: no dark mood But these might best assuage; The sweet red rose of babyhood, The white sweet rose of age. LINES ON THE DEATH OF EDWARD JOHN TRELAWNY Last high star of the years whose thunder Still men's listening remembrance hears, Last light left of our fathers' years, Watched with honour and hailed with wonder Thee too then have the years borne under, Thou too then hast regained thy peers. Wings that warred with the winds of morning, Storm-winds rocking the red great dawn, Close at last, and a film is drawn Over the eyes of the storm-bird, scorning Now no longer the loud wind's warning, Waves that threaten or waves that fawn. Peers were none of thee left us living, Peers of theirs we shall see no more. Eight years over the full fourscore Knew thee: now shalt thou sleep, forgiving All griefs past of the wild world's giving, Moored at last on the stormless shore. Worldwide liberty's lifelong lover, Lover no less of the strength of song, Sea-king, swordsman, hater of wrong, Over thy dust that the dust shall cover Comes my song as a bird to hover, Borne of its will as of wings along. Cherished of thee were this brief song's brothers Now that follows them, cherishing thee. Over the tides and the tideless sea Soft as a smile of the earth our mother's Flies it faster than all those others, First of the troop at thy tomb to be. Memories of Greece and the mountain's hollow Guarded alone of thy loyal sword Hold thy name for our hearts in ward: Yet more fain are our hearts to follow One way now with the southward swallow Back to the grave of the man their lord. Heart of hearts, art thou moved not, hearing Surely, if hearts of the dead may hear, Whose true heart it is now draws near? Surely the sense of it thrills thee, cheering Darkness and death with the news now nearing— Shelley, Trelawny rejoins thee here. ADIEUX À MARIE STUART I Queen, for whose house my fathers fought, With hopes that rose and fell, Red star of boyhood's fiery thought, Farewell. They gave their lives, and I, my queen, Have given you of my life, Seeing your brave star burn high between Men's strife. The strife that lightened round their spears Long since fell still: so long Hardly may hope to last in years My song. But still through strife of time and thought Your light on me too fell: Queen, in whose name we sang or fought, Farewell. II There beats no heart on either border Wherethrough the north blasts blow But keeps your memory as a warder His beacon-fire aglow. Long since it fired with love and wonder Mine, for whose April age Blithe midsummer made banquet under The shade of Hermitage. Soft sang the burn's blithe notes, that gather Strength to ring true: And air and trees and sun and heather Remembered you. Old border ghosts of fight or fairy Or love or teen, These they forgot, remembering Mary The Queen. III Queen once of Scots and ever of ours Whose sires brought forth for you Their lives to strew your way like flowers, Adieu. Dead is full many a dead man's name Who died for you this long Time past: shall this too fare the same, My song? But surely, though it die or live, Your face was worth All that a man may think to give On earth. No darkness cast of years between Can darken you: Man's love will never bid my queen Adieu. IV Love hangs like light about your name As music round the shell: No heart can take of you a tame Farewell. Yet, when your very face was seen, Ill gifts were yours for giving: Love gat strange guerdons of my queen When living. O diamond heart unflawed and clear, The whole world's crowning jewel! Was ever heart so deadly dear So cruel? Yet none for you of all that bled Grudged once one drop that fell: Not one to life reluctant said Farewell. V Strange love they have given you, love disloyal, Who mock with praise your name, To leave a head so rare and royal Too low for praise or blame. You could not love nor hate, they tell us, You had nor sense nor sting: In God's name, then, what plague befell us To fight for such a thing? “Some faults the gods will give,” to fetter Man's highest intent: But surely you were something better Than innocent! No maid that strays with steps unwary Through snares unseen, But one to live and die for; Mary, The Queen. VI Forgive them all their praise, who blot Your fame with praise of you: Then love may say, and falter not, Adieu. Yet some you hardly would forgive Who did you much less wrong Once: but resentment should not live Too long. They never saw your lip's bright bow, Your swordbright eyes, The bluest of heavenly things below The skies. Clear eyes that love's self finds most like A swordblade's blue, A swordblade's ever keen to strike, Adieu. VII Though all things breathe or sound of fight That yet make up your spell, To bid you were to bid the light Farewell. Farewell the song says only, being A star whose race is run: Farewell the soul says never, seeing The sun. Yet, wellnigh as with flash of tears, The song must say but so That took your praise up twenty years Ago. More bright than stars or moons that vary, Sun kindling heaven and hell, Here, after all these years, Queen Mary, Farewell. HERSE When grace is given us ever to behold A child some sweet months old, Love, laying across our lips his finger, saith, Smiling, with bated breath, Hush! for the holiest thing that lives is here, And heaven's own heart how near! How dare we, that may gaze not on the sun, Gaze on this verier one? Heart, hold thy peace; eyes, be cast down for shame; Lips, breathe not yet its name. In heaven they know what name to call it; we, How should we know? For, see! The adorable sweet living marvellous Strange light that lightens us Who gaze, desertless of such glorious grace, Full in a babe's warm face! All roses that the morning rears are nought, All stars not worth a thought, Set this one star against them, or suppose As rival this one rose. What price could pay with earth's whole weight of gold One least flushed roseleaf's fold Of all this dimpling store of smiles that shine From each warm curve and line, Each charm of flower-sweet flesh, to reillume The dappled rose-red bloom Of all its dainty body, honey-sweet Clenched hands and curled-up feet, That on the roses of the dawn have trod As they came down from God, And keep the flush and colour that the sky Takes when the sun comes nigh, And keep the likeness of the smile their grace Evoked on God's own face When, seeing this work of his most heavenly mood, He saw that it was good? For all its warm sweet body seems one smile, And mere men's love too vile To meet it, or with eyes that worship dims Read o'er the little limbs, Read all the book of all their beauties o'er, Rejoice, revere, adore, Bow down and worship each delight in turn, Laugh, wonder, yield, and yearn. But when our trembling kisses dare, yet dread, Even to draw nigh its head, And touch, and scarce with touch or breath surprise Its mild miraculous eyes Out of their viewless vision—O, what then, What may be said of men? What speech may name a new-born child? what word Earth ever spake or heard? The best men's tongue that ever glory knew Called that a drop of dew Which from the breathing creature's kindly womb Came forth in blameless bloom. We have no word, as had those men most high, To call a baby by. Rose, ruby, lily, pearl of stormless seas— A better word than these, A better sign it was than flower or gem That love revealed to them: They knew that whence comes light or quickening flame, Thence only this thing came, And only might be likened of our love To somewhat born above, Not even to sweetest things dropped else on earth, Only to dew's own birth. Nor doubt we but their sense was heavenly true, Babe, when we gaze on you, A dew-drop out of heaven whose colours are More bright than sun or star, As now, ere watching love dare fear or hope, Lips, hands, and eyelids ope, And all your life is mixed with earthly leaven. O child, what news from heaven? TWINS Affectionately inscribed to W. M. R. and L. R. April, on whose wings Ride all gracious things, Like the star that brings All things good to man, Ere his light, that yet Makes the month shine, set, And fair May forget Whence her birth began, Brings, as heart would choose, Sound of golden news, Bright as kindling dews When the dawn begins; Tidings clear as mirth, Sweet as air and earth Now that hail the birth, Twice thus blest, of twins. In the lovely land Where with hand in hand Lovers wedded stand Other joys before Made your mixed life sweet: Now, as Time sees meet, Three glad blossoms greet Two glad blossoms more. Fed with sun and dew, While your joys were new, First arose and grew One bright olive-shoot: Then a fair and fine Slip of warm-haired pine Felt the sweet sun shine On its leaf and fruit. And it wore for mark Graven on the dark Beauty of its bark That the noblest name Worn in song of old By the king whose bold Hand had fast in hold All the flower of fame. Then, with southern skies Flattered in her eyes, Which, in lovelier wise Yet, reflect their blue Brightened more, being bright Here with life's delight, And with love's live light Glorified anew, Came, as fair as came One who bore her name (She that broke as flame From the swan-shell white), Crowned with tender hair Only, but more fair Than all queens that were Themes of oldworld fight, Of your flowers the third Bud, or new-fledged bird In your hearts' nest heard Murmuring like a dove Bright as those that drew Over waves where blew No loud wind the blue Heaven-hued car of love. Not the glorious grace Even of that one face Potent to displace All the towers of Troy Surely shone more clear Once with childlike cheer Than this child's face here Now with living joy. After these again Here in April's train Breaks the bloom of twain Blossoms in one birth For a crown of May On the front of day When he takes his way Over heaven and earth. Half a heavenly thing Given from heaven to Spring By the sun her king, Half a tender toy, Seems a child of curl Yet too soft to twirl; Seems the flower-sweet girl By the flower-bright boy. All the kind gods' grace, All their love, embrace Ever either face, Ever brood above them: All soft wings of hours Screen them as with flowers From all beams and showers: All life's seasons love them. When the dews of sleep Falling lightliest keep Eyes too close to peep Forth and laugh off rest, Joy from face to feet Fill them, as is meet: Life to them be sweet As their mother's breast. When those dews are dry, And in day's bright eye Looking full they lie Bright as rose and pearl, All returns of joy Pure of time's alloy Bless the rose-red boy, Guard the rose-white girl Postscript Friends, if I could take Half a note from Blake Or but one verse make Of the Conqueror's mine, Better than my best Song above your nest I would sing: the quest Now seems too divine. April 28, 1881. THE SALT OF THE EARTH If childhood were not in the world, But only men and women grown; No baby-locks in tendrils curled, No baby-blossoms blown; Though men were stronger, women fairer, And nearer all delights in reach, And verse and music uttered rarer Tones of more godlike speech; Though the utmost life of life's best hours Found, as it cannot now find, words; Though desert sands were sweet as flower And flowers could sing like birds, But children never heard them, never They felt a child's foot leap and run This were a drearier star than ever Yet looked upon the sun. SEVEN YEARS OLD I Seven white roses on one tree, Seven white loaves of blameless leaven, Seven white sails on one soft sea, Seven white swans on one lake's lee, Seven white flowerlike stars in heaven, All are types unmeet to be For a birthday's crown of seven. II Not the radiance of the roses, Not the blessing of the bread, Not the breeze that ere day grows is Fresh for sails and swans, and closes Wings above the sun's grave spread, When the starshine on the snows is Sweet as sleep on sorrow shed, III Nothing sweetest, nothing best, Holds so good and sweet a treasure As the love wherewith once blest Joy grows holy, grief takes rest, Life, half tired with hours to measure, Fills his eyes and lips and breast With most light and breath of pleasure; IV As the rapture unpolluted, As the passion undefiled, By whose force all pains heart-rooted Are transfigured and transmuted, Recompensed and reconciled, Through the imperial, undisputed, Present godhead of a child. V Brown bright eyes and fair bright head, Worth a worthier crown than this is, Worth a worthier song instead, Sweet grave wise round mouth, full fed With the joy of love, whose bliss is More than mortal wine and bread, Lips whose words are sweet as kisses, VI Little hands so glad of giving, Little heart so glad of love, Little soul so glad of living, While the strong swift hours are weaving Light with darkness woven above, Time for mirth and time for grieving, Plume of raven and plume of dove, VII I can give you but a word Warm with love therein for leaven, But a song that falls unheard Yet on ears of sense unstirred Yet by song so far from heaven, Whence you came the brightest bird, Seven years since, of seven times seven. EIGHT YEARS OLD I Sun, whom the faltering snow-cloud fears, Rise, let the time of year be May, Speak now the word that April hears, Let March have all his royal way; Bid all spring raise in winter's ears All tunes her children hear or play, Because the crown of eight glad years On one bright head is set to-day. II What matters cloud or sun to-day To him who wears the wreath of years So many, and all like flowers at play With wind and sunshine, while his ears Hear only song on every way? More sweet than spring triumphant hears Ring through the revel-rout of May Are these, the notes that winter fears. III Strong-hearted winter knows and fears The music made of love at play, Or haply loves the tune he hears From hearts fulfilled with flowering May, Whose molten music thaws his ears Late frozen, deaf but yesterday To sounds of dying and dawning years, Now quickened on his deathward way. IV For deathward now lies winter's way Down the green vestibule of years That each year brightens day by day With flower and shower till hope scarce fears And fear grows wholly hope of May. But we—the music in our ears Made of love's pulses as they play The heart alone that makes it hears. V The heart it is that plays and hears High salutation of to-day. Tongue falters, hand shrinks back, song fears Its own unworthiness to play Fit music for those eight sweet years, Or sing their blithe accomplished way. No song quite worth a young child's ears Broke ever even from birds in May. VI There beats not in the heart of May, When summer hopes and springtide fears, There falls not from the height of day, When sunlight speaks and silence hears, So sweet a psalm as children play And sing, each hour of all their years, Each moment of their lovely way, And know not how it thrills our ears. VII Ah child, what are we, that our ears Should hear you singing on your way, Should have this happiness? The years Whose hurrying wings about us play Are not like yours, whose flower-time fears Nought worse than sunlit showers in May, Being sinless as the spring, that hears Her own heart praise her every day. VIII Yet we too triumph in the day That bare, to entrance our eyes and ears, To lighten daylight, and to play Such notes as darkness knows and fears, The child whose face illumes our way, Whose voice lifts up the heart that hears, Whose hand is as the hand of May To bring us flowers from eight full years. February 4, 1882. COMPARISONS Child, when they say that others Have been or are like you, Babes fit to be your brothers, Sweet human drops of dew, Bright fruit of mortal mothers, What should one say or do? We know the thought is treason, We feel the dream absurd; A claim rebuked of reason, That withers at a word: For never shone the season That bore so blithe a bird. Some smiles may seem as merry, Some glances gleam as wise, From lips as like a cherry And scarce less gracious eyes; Eyes browner than a berry, Lips red as morning's rise. But never yet rang laughter So sweet in gladdened ears Through wall and floor and rafter As all this household hears And rings response thereafter Till cloudiest weather clears. When those your chosen of all men, Whose honey never cloys, Two lights whose smiles enthrall men, Were called at your age boys, Those mighty men, while small men, Could make no merrier noise. Our Shakespeare, surely, daffed not More lightly pain aside From radiant lips that quaffed not Of forethought's tragic tide: Our Dickens, doubtless, laughed not More loud with life's first pride. The dawn were not more cheerless With neither light nor dew Than we without the fearless Clear laugh that thrills us through: If ever child stood peerless, Love knows that child is you. WHAT IS DEATH? Looking on a page where stood Graven of old on old-world wood Death, and by the grave's edge grim, Pale, the young man facing him, Asked my well-beloved of me Once what strange thing this might be, Gaunt and great of limb. Death, I told him: and, surprise Deepening more his wildwood eyes (Like some sweet fleet thing's whose breath Speaks all spring though nought it saith), Up he turned his rosebright face Glorious with its seven years' grace, Asking—What is death? A CHILD'S PITY No sweeter thing than children's ways and wiles, Surely, we say, can gladden eyes and ears: Yet sometime sweeter than their words or smiles Are even their tears. To one for once a piteous tale was read, How, when the murderous mother crocodile Was slain, her fierce brood famished, and lay dead, Starved, by the Nile. In vast green reed-beds on the vast grey slime Those monsters motherless and helpless lay, Perishing only for the parent's crime Whose seed were they. Hours after, toward the dusk, our blithe small bird Of Paradise, who has our hearts in keeping, Was heard or seen, but hardly seen or heard, For pity weeping. He was so sorry, sitting still apart, For the poor little crocodiles, he said. Six years had given him, for an angel's heart, A child's instead. Feigned tears the false beasts shed for murderous ends, We know from travellers' tales of crocodiles: But these tears wept upon them of my friend's Outshine his smiles. What heavenliest angels of what heavenly city Could match the heavenly heart in children here? The heart that hallowing all things with its pity Casts out all fear? So lovely, so divine, so dear their laughter Seems to us, we know not what could be more dear: But lovelier yet we see the sign thereafter Of such a tear. With sense of love half laughing and half weeping We met your tears, our small sweet-spirited friend: Let your love have us in its heavenly keeping To life's last end. A CHILD'S LAUGHTER All the bells of heaven may ring, All the birds of heaven may sing, All the wells on earth may spring, All the winds on earth may bring All sweet sounds together; Sweeter far than all things heard, Hand of harper, tone of bird, Sound of woods at sundawn stirred, Welling water's winsome word, Wind in warm wan weather, One thing yet there is, that none Hearing ere its chime be done Knows not well the sweetest one Heard of man beneath the sun, Hoped in heaven hereafter; Soft and strong and loud and light, Very sound of very light Heard from morning's rosiest height, When the soul of all delight Fills a child's clear laughter. Golden bells of welcome rolled Never forth such notes, nor told Hours so blithe in tones so bold, As the radiant mouth of gold Here that rings forth heaven. If the golden-crested wren Were a nightingale—why, then, Something seen and heard of men Might be half as sweet as when Laughs a child of seven. A CHILD'S THANKS How low soe'er men rank us, How high soe'er we win, The children far above us Dwell, and they deign to love us, With lovelier love than ours, And smiles more sweet than flowers; As though the sun should thank us For letting light come in. With too divine complaisance, Whose grace misleads them thus, Being gods, in heavenly blindness They call our worship kindness, Our pebble-gift a gem: They think us good to them, Whose glance, whose breath, whose presence, Are gifts too good for us. The poet high and hoary Of meres that mountains bind Felt his great heart more often Yearn, and its proud strength soften From stern to tenderer mood, At thought of gratitude Shown than of song or story He heard of hearts unkind. But with what words for token And what adoring tears Of reverence risen to passion, In what glad prostrate fashion Of spirit and soul subdued, May man show gratitude For thanks of children spoken That hover in his ears? The angels laugh, your brothers, Child, hearing you thank me, With eyes whence night grows sunny, And touch of lips like honey, And words like honey-dew: But how shall I thank you? For gifts above all others What guerdon-gift may be? What wealth of words caressing, What choice of songs found best, Would seem not as derision, Found vain beside the vision And glory from above Shown in a child's heart's love? His part in life is blessing; Ours, only to be blest. A CHILD'S BATTLES ??? ?????? ?????. —Pindar. Praise of the knights of old May sleep: their tale is told, And no man cares: The praise which fires our lips is A knight's whose fame eclipses All of theirs. The ruddiest light in heaven Blazed as his birth-star seven Long years ago: All glory crown that old year Which brought our stout small soldier With the snow! Each baby born has one Star, for his friends a sun, The first of stars: And we, the more we scan it, The more grow sure your planet, Child, was Mars. For each one flower, perchance, Blooms as his cognizance: The snowdrop chill, The violet unbeholden, For some: for you the golden Daffodil. Erect, a fighting flower, It breasts the breeziest hour That ever blew, And bent or broke things brittle Or frail, unlike a little Knight like you. Its flower is firm and fresh And stout like sturdiest flesh Of children: all The strenuous blast that parches Spring hurts it not till March is Near his fall. If winds that prate and fret Remark, rebuke, regret, Lament, or blame The brave plant's martial passion, It keeps its own free fashion All the same. We that would fain seem wise Assume grave mouths and eyes Whose looks reprove Too much delight in battle: But your great heart our prattle Cannot move. We say, small children should Be placid, mildly good And blandly meek: Whereat the broad smile rushes Full on your lips, and flushes All your cheek. If all the stars that are Laughed out, and every star Could here be heard, Such peals of golden laughter We should not hear, as after Such a word. For all the storm saith, still, Stout stands the daffodil: For all we say, Howe'er he look demurely, Our martialist will surely Have his way. We may not bind with bands Those large and liberal hands, Nor stay from fight, Nor hold them back from giving: No lean mean laws of living Bind a knight. And always here of old Such gentle hearts and bold Our land has bred: How durst her eye rest else on The glory shed from Nelson Quick and dead? Shame were it, if but one Such once were born her son, That one to have borne, And brought him ne'er a brother: His praise should bring his mother Shame and scorn. A child high-souled as he Whose manhood shook the sea Smiles haply here: His face, where love lies basking, With bright shut mouth seems asking, What is fear? The sunshine-coloured fists Beyond his dimpling wrists Were never closed For saving or for sparing— For only deeds of daring Predisposed. Unclenched, the gracious hands Let slip their gifts like sands Made rich with ore That tongues of beggars ravish From small stout hands so lavish Of their store. Sweet hardy kindly hands Like these were his that stands With heel on gorge Seen trampling down the dragon On sign or flask or flagon, Sweet Saint George. Some tournament, perchance, Of hands that couch no lance, Might mark this spot Your lists, if here some pleasant Small Guenevere were present, Launcelot. My brave bright flower, you need No foolish song, nor heed It more than spring The sighs of winter stricken Dead when your haunts requicken Here, my king. Yet O, how hardly may The wheels of singing stay That whirl along Bright paths whence echo raises The phantom of your praises, Child, my song! Beyond all other things That give my words fleet wings, Fleet wings and strong, You set their jesses ringing Till hardly can I, singing, Stint my song. But all things better, friend, And worse must find an end: And, right or wrong, 'Tis time, lest rhyme should baffle, I doubt, to put a snaffle On my song. And never may your ear Aught harsher hear or fear, Nor wolfish night Nor dog-toothed winter snarling Behind your steps, my darling My delight! For all the gifts you give Me, dear, each day you live, Of thanks above All thanks that could be spoken Take not my song in token, Take my love. A CHILD'S FUTURE What will it please you, my darling, hereafter to be? Fame upon land will you look for, or glory by sea? Gallant your life will be always, and all of it free. Free as the wind when the heart of the twilight is stirred Eastward, and sounds from the springs of the sunrise are heard: Free—and we know not another as infinite word. Darkness or twilight or sunlight may compass us round, Hate may arise up against us, or hope may confound; Love may forsake us; yet may not the spirit be bound. Free in oppression of grief as in ardour of joy Still may the soul be, and each to her strength as a toy: Free in the glance of the man as the smile of the boy. Freedom alone is the salt and the spirit that gives Life, and without her is nothing that verily lives: Death cannot slay her: she laughs upon death and forgives. Brightest and hardiest of roses anear and afar Glitters the blithe little face of you, round as a star: Liberty bless you and keep you to be as you are. England and liberty bless you and keep you to be Worthy the name of their child and the sight of their sea: Fear not at all; for a slave, if he fears not, is free. SONNETS ON ENGLISH DRAMATIC POETS (1590–1650) I CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE Crowned, girdled, garbed and shod with light and fire, Son first-born of the morning, sovereign star! Soul nearest ours of all, that wert most far, Most far off in the abysm of time, thy lyre Hung highest above the dawn-enkindled quire Where all ye sang together, all that are, And all the starry songs behind thy car Rang sequence, all our souls acclaim thee sire. “If all the pens that ever poets held Had fed the feeling of their masters' thoughts,” And as with rush of hurtling chariots The flight of all their spirits were impelled Toward one great end, thy glory—nay, not then, Not yet might'st thou be praised enough of men. II WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE Not if men's tongues and angels' all in one Spake, might the word be said that might speak Thee. Streams, winds, woods, flowers, fields, mountains, yea, the sea, What power is in them all to praise the sun? His praise is this,—he can be praised of none. Man, woman, child, praise God for him; but he Exults not to be worshipped, but to be. He is; and, being, beholds his work well done. All joy, all glory, all sorrow, all strength, all mirth, Are his: without him, day were night on earth. Time knows not his from time's own period. All lutes, all harps, all viols, all flutes, all lyres, Fall dumb before him ere one string suspires. All stars are angels; but the sun is God. III BEN JONSON Broad-based, broad-fronted, bounteous, multiform, With many a valley impleached with ivy and vine, Wherein the springs of all the streams run wine, And many a crag full-faced against the storm, The mountain where thy Muse's feet made warm Those lawns that revelled with her dance divine Shines yet with fire as it was wont to shine From tossing torches round the dance aswarm. Nor less, high-stationed on the grey grave heights, High-thoughted seers with heaven's heart-kindling lights Hold converse: and the herd of meaner things Knows or by fiery scourge or fiery shaft When wrath on thy broad brows has risen, and laughed Darkening thy soul with shadow of thunderous wings. IV BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER An hour ere sudden sunset fired the west, Arose two stars upon the pale deep east. The hall of heaven was clear for night's high feast, Yet was not yet day's fiery heart at rest. Love leapt up from his mother's burning breast To see those warm twin lights, as day decreased, Wax wider, till when all the sun had ceased As suns they shone from evening's kindled crest. Across them and between, a quickening fire, Flamed Venus, laughing with appeased desire. Their dawn, scarce lovelier for the gleam of tears, Filled half the hollow shell 'twixt heaven and earth With sound like moonlight, mingling moan and mirth, Which rings and glitters down the darkling years. V PHILIP MASSINGER Clouds here and there arisen an hour past noon Chequered our English heaven with lengthening bars And shadow and sound of wheel-winged thunder-cars Assembling strength to put forth tempest soon, When the clear still warm concord of thy tune Rose under skies unscared by reddening Mars Yet, like a sound of silver speech of stars, With full mild flame as of the mellowing moon. Grave and great-hearted Massinger, thy face High melancholy lights with loftier grace Than gilds the brows of revel: sad and wise, The spirit of thought that moved thy deeper song, Sorrow serene in soft calm scorn of wrong, Speaks patience yet from thy majestic eyes. VI JOHN FORD Hew hard the marble from the mountain's heart Where hardest night holds fast in iron gloom Gems brighter than an April dawn in bloom, That his Memnonian likeness thence may start Revealed, whose hand with high funereal art Carved night, and chiselled shadow: be the tomb That speaks him famous graven with signs of doom Intrenched inevitably in lines athwart, As on some thunder-blasted Titan's brow His record of rebellion. Not the day Shall strike forth music from so stern a chord, Touching this marble: darkness, none knows how, And stars impenetrable of midnight, may. So looms the likeness of thy soul, John Ford. VII JOHN WEBSTER Thunder: the flesh quails, and the soul bows down. Night: east, west, south, and northward, very night. Star upon struggling star strives into sight, Star after shuddering star the deep storms drown. The very throne of night, her very crown, A man lays hand on, and usurps her right. Song from the highest of heaven's imperious height Shoots, as a fire to smite some towering town. Rage, anguish, harrowing fear, heart-crazing crime, Make monstrous all the murderous face of Time Shown in the spheral orbit of a glass Revolving. Earth cries out from all her graves. Frail, on frail rafts, across wide-wallowing waves, Shapes here and there of child and mother pass. VIII THOMAS DECKER Out of the depths of darkling life where sin Laughs piteously that sorrow should not know Her own ill name, nor woe be counted woe; Where hate and craft and lust make drearier din Than sounds through dreams that grief holds revel in; What charm of joy-bells ringing, streams that flow, Winds that blow healing in each note they blow, Is this that the outer darkness hears begin? O sweetest heart of all thy time save one, Star seen for love's sake nearest to the sun, Hung lamplike o'er a dense and doleful city, Not Shakespeare's very spirit, howe'er more great, Than thine toward man was more compassionate, Nor gave Christ praise from lips more sweet with pity. IX THOMAS MIDDLETON A wild moon riding high from cloud to cloud, That sees and sees not, glimmering far beneath, Hell's children revel along the shuddering heath With dirge-like mirth and raiment like a shroud: A worse fair face than witchcraft's, passion-proud, With brows blood-flecked behind their bridal wreath And lips that bade the assassin's sword find sheath Deep in the heart whereto love's heart was vowed: A game of close contentious crafts and creeds Played till white England bring black Spain to shame: A son's bright sword and brighter soul, whose deeds High conscience lights for mother's love and fame: Pure gipsy flowers, and poisonous courtly weeds: Such tokens and such trophies crown thy name. X THOMAS HEYWOOD Tom, if they loved thee best who called thee Tom, What else may all men call thee, seeing thus bright Even yet the laughing and the weeping light That still thy kind old eyes are kindled from? Small care was thine to assail and overcome Time and his child Oblivion: yet of right Thy name has part with names of lordlier might For English love and homely sense of home, Whose fragrance keeps thy small sweet bayleaf young And gives it place aloft among thy peers Whence many a wreath once higher strong Time has hurled: And this thy praise is sweet on Shakespeare's tongue— “O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world!” XI GEORGE CHAPMAN High priest of Homer, not elect in vain, Deep trumpets blow before thee, shawms behind Mix music with the rolling wheels that wind Slow through the labouring triumph of thy train: Fierce history, molten in thy forging brain, Takes form and fire and fashion from thy mind, Tormented and transmuted out of kind: But howsoe'er thou shift thy strenuous strain, Like Tailor Author of The Hog hath lost his Pearl. smooth, like Fisher Author of Fuimus Troes, or the True Trojans. swollen, and now Grim Yarrington Author of Two Tragedies in One. scarce bloodier marked than thou, Then bluff as Mayne's Author of The City Match. or broad-mouthed Barry's Author of Ram-Alley, or Merry Tricks. glee; Proud still with hoar predominance of brow And beard like foam swept off the broad blown sea, Where'er thou go, men's reverence goes with thee. XII JOHN MARSTON The bitterness of death and bitterer scorn Breathes from the broad-leafed aloe-plant whence thou Wast fain to gather for thy bended brow A chaplet by no gentler forehead worn. Grief deep as hell, wrath hardly to be borne, Ploughed up thy soul till round the furrowing plough The strange black soil foamed, as a black beaked prow Bids night-black waves foam where its track has torn. Too faint the phrase for thee that only saith Scorn bitterer than the bitterness of death Pervades the sullen splendour of thy soul, Where hate and pain make war on force and fraud And all the strengths of tyrants; whence unflawed It keeps this noble heart of hatred whole. XIII JOHN DAY Day was a full-blown flower in heaven, alive With murmuring joy of bees and birds aswarm, When in the skies of song yet flushed and warm With music where all passion seems to strive For utterance, all things bright and fierce to drive Struggling along the splendour of the storm, Day for an hour put off his fiery form, And golden murmurs from a golden hive Across the strong bright summer wind were heard, And laughter soft as smiles from girls at play And loud from lips of boys brow-bound with May Our mightiest age let fall its gentlest word, When Song, in semblance of a sweet small bird, Lit fluttering on the light swift hand of Day. XIV JAMES SHIRLEY The dusk of day's decline was hard on dark When evening trembled round thy glowworm lamp That shone across her shades and dewy damp A small clear beacon whose benignant spark Was gracious yet for loiterers' eyes to mark, Though changed the watchword of our English camp Since the outposts rang round Marlowe's lion ramp, When thy steed's pace went ambling round Hyde Park. And in the thickening twilight under thee Walks Davenant, pensive in the paths where he, The blithest throat that ever carolled love In music made of morning's merriest heart, Glad Suckling, stumbled from his seat above And reeled on slippery roads of alien art. XV THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN Sons born of many a loyal Muse to Ben, All true-begotten, warm with wine or ale, Bright from the broad light of its presence, hail! Prince Randolph, nighest his throne of all his men, Being highest in spirit and heart who hailed him then King, nor might other spread so blithe a sail: Cartwright, a soul pent in with narrower pale, Praised of thy sire for manful might of pen: Marmion, whose verse keeps alway keen and fine The perfume of their Apollonian wine Who shared with that stout sire of all and thee The exuberant chalice of his echoing shrine: Is not your praise writ broad in gold which he Inscribed, that all who praise his name should see? XVI ANONYMOUS PLAYS: “ARDEN OF FEVERSHAM” Mother whose womb brought forth our man of men, Mother of Shakespeare, whom all time acclaims Queen therefore, sovereign queen of English dames, Throned higher than sat thy sonless empress then, Was it thy son's young passion-guided pen Which drew, reflected from encircling flames, A figure marked by the earlier of thy names Wife, and from all her wedded kinswomen Marked by the sign of murderess? Pale and great, Great in her grief and sin, but in her death And anguish of her penitential breath Greater than all her sin or sin-born fate, She stands, the holocaust of dark desire, Clothed round with song for ever as with fire. XVII ANONYMOUS PLAYS Ye too, dim watchfires of some darkling hour, Whose fame forlorn time saves not nor proclaims For ever, but forgetfulness defames And darkness and the shadow of death devour, Lift up ye too your light, put forth your power, Let the far twilight feel your soft small flames And smile, albeit night name not even their names, Ghost by ghost passing, flower blown down on flower: That sweet-tongued shadow, like a star's that passed Singing, and light was from its darkness cast To paint the face of Painting fair with praise: Doctor Dodypol. And that wherein forefigured smiles the pure Fraternal face of Wordsworth's Elidure Between two child-faced masks of merrier days. Nobody and Somebody. XVIII ANONYMOUS PLAYS More yet and more, and yet we mark not all: The Warning fain to bid fair women heed Its hard brief note of deadly doom and deed; A Warning for Fair Women. The verse that strewed too thick with flowers the hall Whence Nero watched his fiery festival; The Tragedy of Nero. That iron page wherein men's eyes who read See, bruised and marred between two babes that bleed, A mad red-handed husband's martyr fall; A Yorkshire Tragedy. The scene which crossed and streaked with mirth the strife Of Henry with his sons and witchlike wife; Look about you. And that sweet pageant of the kindly fiend, Who, seeing three friends in spirit and heart made one, Crowned with good hap the true-love wiles he screened In the pleached lanes of pleasant Edmonton. The Merry Devil of Edmonton. XIX THE MANY I Greene, garlanded with February's few flowers, Ere March came in with Marlowe's rapturous rage: Peele, from whose hand the sweet white locks of age Took the mild chaplet woven of honoured hours: Nash, laughing hard: Lodge, flushed from lyric bowers: And Lilly, a goldfinch in a twisted cage Fed by some gay great lady's pettish page Till short sweet songs gush clear like short spring showers: Kid, whose grim sport still gambolled over graves: And Chettle, in whose fresh funereal verse Weeps Marian yet on Robin's wildwood hearse: Cooke, whose light boat of song one soft breath saves, Sighed from a maiden's amorous mouth averse: Live likewise ye: Time takes not you for slaves. XX THE MANY II Haughton, whose mirth gave woman all her will: Field, bright and loud with laughing flower and bird And keen alternate notes of laud and gird: Barnes, darkening once with Borgia's deeds the quill Which tuned the passion of Parthenophil: Blithe burly Porter, broad and bold of word: Wilkins, a voice with strenuous pity stirred: Turk Mason: Brewer, whose tongue drops honey still: Rough Rowley, handling song with Esau's hand: Light Nabbes: lean Sharpham, rank and raw by turns, But fragrant with a forethought once of Burns: Soft Davenport, sad-robed, but blithe and bland: Brome, gipsy-led across the woodland ferns: Praise be with all, and place among our band. XXI EPILOGUE Our mother, which wast twice, as history saith, Found first among the nations: once, when she Who bore thine ensign saw the God in thee Smite Spain, and bring forth Shakespeare: once, when death Shrank, and Rome's bloodhounds cowered, at Milton's breath: More than thy place, then first among the free More than that sovereign lordship of the sea Bequeathed to Cromwell from Elizabeth, More than thy fiery guiding-star, which Drake Hailed, and the deep saw lit again for Blake, More than all deeds wrought of thy strong right hand, This praise keeps most thy fame's memorial strong, That thou wast head of all these streams of song, And time bows down to thee as Shakespeare's land. A DARK MONTH “La maison sans enfants!” —Victor Hugo. I A month without sight of the sun Rising or reigning or setting Through days without use of the day, Who calls it the month of May? The sense of the name is undone And the sound of it fit for forgetting. We shall not feel if the sun rise, We shall not care when it sets: If a nightingale make night's air As noontide, why should we care? Till a light of delight that is done rise, Extinguishing grey regrets; Till a child's face lighten again On the twilight of older faces; Till a child's voice fall as the dew On furrows with heat parched through And all but hopeless of grain, Refreshing the desolate places— Fall clear on the ears of us hearkening And hungering for food of the sound And thirsting for joy of his voice: Till the hearts in us hear and rejoice, And the thoughts of them doubting and darkening Rejoice with a glad thing found. When the heart of our gladness is gone, What comfort is left with us after? When the light of our eyes is away, What glory remains upon May, What blessing of song is thereon If we drink not the light of his laughter? No small sweet face with the daytime To welcome, warmer than noon! No sweet small voice as a bird's To bring us the day's first words! Mid May for us here is not Maytime: No summer begins with June. A whole dead month in the dark, A dawn in the mists that o'ercome her Stifled and smothered and sad— Swift speed to it, barren and bad! And return to us, voice of the lark, And remain with us, sunlight of summer II Alas, what right has the dawn to glimmer, What right has the wind to do aught but moan? All the day should be dimmer Because we are left alone. Yestermorn like a sunbeam present Hither and thither a light step smiled, And made each place for us pleasant With the sense or the sight of a child. But the leaves persist as before, and after Our parting the dull day still bears flowers; And songs less bright than his laughter Deride us from birds in the bowers. Birds, and blossoms, and sunlight only, As though such folly sufficed for spring! As though the house were not lonely For want of the child its king! III Asleep and afar to-night my darling Lies, and heeds not the night, If winds be stirring or storms be snarling; For his sleep is its own sweet light. I sit where he sat beside me quaffing The wine of story and song Poured forth of immortal cups, and laughing When mirth in the draught grew strong. I broke the gold of the words, to melt it For hands but seven years old, And they caught the tale as a bird, and felt it More bright than visible gold. And he drank down deep, with his eyes broad beaming, Here in this room where I am, The golden vintage of Shakespeare, gleaming In the silver vessels of Lamb. Here by my hearth where he was I listen For the shade of the sound of a word, Athirst for the birdlike eyes to glisten, For the tongue to chirp like a bird. At the blast of battle, how broad they brightened, Like fire in the spheres of stars, And clung to the pictured page, and lightened As keen as the heart of Mars! At the touch of laughter, how swift it twittered The shrillest music on earth; How the lithe limbs laughed and the whole child glittered With radiant riot of mirth! Our Shakespeare now, as a man dumb-stricken, Stands silent there on the shelf: And my thoughts, that had song in the heart of them, sicken, And relish not Shakespeare's self. And my mood grows moodier than Hamlet's even, And man delights not me, But only the face that morn and even My heart leapt only to see. That my heart made merry within me seeing, And sang as his laugh kept time: But song finds now no pleasure in being, And love no reason in rhyme. IV Mild May-blossom and proud sweet bay-flower, What, for shame, would you have with us here? It is not the month of the May-flower This, but the fall of the year. Flowers open only their lips in derision, Leaves are as fingers that point in scorn: The shows we see are a vision; Spring is not verily born. Yet boughs turn supple and buds grow sappy, As though the sun were indeed the sun: And all our woods are happy With all their birds save one. But spring is over, but summer is over, But autumn is over, and winter stands With his feet sunk deep in the clover And cowslips cold in his hands. His hoar grim head has a hawthorn bonnet, His gnarled gaunt hand has a gay green staff With new-blown rose-blossom on it: But his laugh is a dead man's laugh. The laugh of spring that the heart seeks after, The hand that the whole world yearns to kiss, It rings not here in his laughter, The sign of it is not this. There is not strength in it left to splinter Tall oaks, nor frost in his breath to sting: Yet it is but a breath as of winter, And it is not the hand of spring. V Thirty-one pale maidens, clad All in mourning dresses, Pass, with lips and eyes more sad That it seems they should be glad, Heads discrowned of crowns they had, Grey for golden tresses. Grey their girdles too for green, And their veils dishevelled: None would say, to see their mien, That the least of these had been Born no baser than a queen, Reared where flower-fays revelled. Dreams that strive to seem awake, Ghosts that walk by daytime, Weary winds the way they take, Since, for one child's absent sake, May knows well, whate'er things make Sport, it is not Maytime. VI A hand at the door taps light As the hand of my heart's delight: It is but a full-grown hand, Yet the stroke of it seems to start Hope like a bird in my heart, Too feeble to soar or to stand. To start light hope from her cover Is to raise but a kite for a plover If her wings be not fledged to soar. Desire, but in dreams, cannot ope The door that was shut upon hope When love went out at the door. Well were it if vision could keep The lids of desire as in sleep Fast locked, and over his eyes A dream with the dark soft key In her hand might hover, and be Their keeper till morning rise; The morning that brings after many Days fled with no light upon any The small face back which is gone; When the loved little hands once more Shall struggle and strain at the door They beat their summons upon. VII If a soul for but seven days were cast out of heaven and its mirth, They would seem to her fears like as seventy years upon earth. Even and morrow should seem to her sorrow as long As the passage of numberless ages in slumberless song. Dawn, roused by the lark, would be surely as dark in her sight As her measureless measure of shadowless pleasure was bright. Noon, gilt but with glory of gold, would be hoary and grey In her eyes that had gazed on the depths, unamazed with the day. Night hardly would seem to make darker her dream never done, When it could but withhold what a man may behold of the sun. For dreams would perplex, were the days that should vex her but seven, The sight of her vision, made dark with division from heaven. Till the light on my lonely way lighten that only now gleams, I too am divided from heaven and derided of dreams. VIII A twilight fire-fly may suggest How flames the fire that feeds the sun: “A crooked figure may attest In little space a million.” But this faint-figured verse, that dresses With flowers the bones of one bare month, Of all it would say scarce expresses In crooked ways a millionth. A fire-fly tenders to the father Of fires a tribute something worth: My verse, a shard-borne beetle rather, Drones over scarce-illumined earth. Some inches round me though it brighten With light of music-making thought, The dark indeed it may not lighten, The silence moves not, hearing nought. Only my heart is eased with hearing, Only mine eyes are soothed with seeing, A face brought nigh, a footfall nearing, Till hopes take form and dreams have being. IX As a poor man hungering stands with insatiate eyes and hands Void of bread Right in sight of men that feast while his famine with no least Crumb is fed, Here across the garden-wall can I hear strange children call, Watch them play, From the windowed seat above, whence the goodlier child I love Is away. Here the sights we saw together moved his fancy like a feather To and fro, Now to wonder, and thereafter to the sunny storm of laughter Loud and low— Sights engraven on storied pages where man's tale of seven swift ages All was told— Seen of eyes yet bright from heaven—for the lips that laughed were seven Sweet years old. X Why should May remember March, if March forget The days that began with December The nights that a frost could fret? All their griefs are done with Now the bright months bless Fit souls to rejoice in the sun with, Fit heads for the wind's caress; Souls of children quickening With the whole world's mirth, Heads closelier than field-flowers thickening That crowd and illuminate earth, Now that May's call musters Files of baby bands To marshal in joyfuller clusters Than the flowers that encumber their hands. Yet morose November Found them no less gay, With nought to forget or remember Less bright than a branch of may. All the seasons moving Move their minds alike Applauding, acclaiming, approving All hours of the year that strike. So my heart may fret not, Wondering if my friend Remember me not or forget not Or ever the month find end. Not that love sows lighter Seed in children sown, But that life being lit in them brighter Moves fleeter than even our own. May nor yet September Binds their hearts, that yet Remember, forget, and remember, Forget, and recall, and forget. XI As light on a lake's face moving Between a cloud and a cloud Till night reclaim it, reproving The heart that exults too loud, The heart that watching rejoices When soft it swims into sight Applauded of all the voices And stars of the windy night, So brief and unsure, but sweeter Than ever a moondawn smiled, Moves, measured of no tune's metre, The song in the soul of a child; The song that the sweet soul singing Half listens, and hardly hears, Though sweeter than joy-bells ringing And brighter than joy's own tears; The song that remembrance of pleasure Begins, and forgetfulness ends With a soft swift change in the measure That rings in remembrance of friends As the moon on the lake's face flashes, So haply may gleam at whiles A dream through the dear deep lashes Whereunder a child's eye smiles, And the least of us all that love him May take for a moment part With angels around and above him, And I find place in his heart. XII Child, were you kinless and lonely— Dear, were you kin to me— My love were compassionate only Or such as it needs would be. But eyes of father and mother Like sunlight shed on you shine: What need you have heed of another Such new strange love as is mine? It is not meet if unruly Hands take of the children's bread And cast it to dogs; but truly The dogs after all would be fed. On crumbs from the children's table That crumble, dropped from above, My heart feeds, fed with unstable Loose waifs of a child's light love. Though love in your heart were brittle As glass that breaks with a touch, You haply would lend him a little Who surely would give you much. XIII Here is a rough Rude sketch of my friend, Faint-coloured enough And unworthily penned. Fearlessly fair And triumphant he stands, And holds unaware Friends' hearts in his hands; Stalwart and straight As an oak that should bring Forth gallant and great Fresh roses in spring. On the paths of his pleasure All graces that wait What metre shall measure What rhyme shall relate Each action, each motion, Each feature, each limb, Demands a devotion In honour of him: Head that the hand Of a god might have blest, Laid lustrous and bland On the curve of its crest: Mouth sweeter than cherries, Keen eyes as of Mars, Browner than berries And brighter than stars. Nor colour nor wordy Weak song can declare The stature how sturdy, How stalwart his air. As a king in his bright Presence-chamber may be, So seems he in height— Twice higher than your knee. As a warrior sedate With reserve of his power, So seems he in state— As tall as a flower: As a rose overtowering The ranks of the rest That beneath it lie cowering, Less bright than their best. And his hands are as sunny As ruddy ripe corn Or the browner-hued honey From heather-bells borne. When summer sits proudest, Fulfilled with its mirth, And rapture is loudest In air and on earth, The suns of all hours That have ripened the roots Bring forth not such flowers And beget not such fruits. And well though I know it, As fain would I write, Child, never a poet Could praise you aright. I bless you? the blessing Were less than a jest Too poor for expressing; I come to be blest, With humble and dutiful Heart, from above: Bless me, O my beautiful Innocent love! This rhyme in your praise With a smile was begun; But the goal of his ways Is uncovered to none, Nor pervious till after The limit impend; It is not in laughter These rhymes of you end. XIV Spring, and fall, and summer, and winter, Which may Earth love least of them all, Whose arms embrace as their signs imprint her, Summer, or winter, or spring, or fall? The clear-eyed spring with the wood-birds mating, The rose-red summer with eyes aglow, The yellow fall with serene eyes waiting, The wild-eyed winter with hair all snow? Spring's eyes are soft, but if frosts benumb her As winter's own will her shrewd breath sting: Storms may rend the raiment of summer, And fall grow bitter as harsh-lipped spring. One sign for summer and winter guides me, One for spring, and the like for fall: Whichever from sight of my friend divides me, That is the worst ill season of all. XV Worse than winter is spring If I come not to sight of my king: But then what a spring will it be When my king takes homage of me! I send his grace from afar Homage, as though to a star; As a shepherd whose flock takes flight May worship a star by night. As a flock that a wolf is upon My songs take flight and are gone: No heart is in any to sing Aught but the praise of my king. Fain would I once and again Sing deeds and passions of men: But ever a child's head gleams Between my work and my dreams. Between my hand and my eyes The lines of a small face rise, And the lines I trace and retrace Are none but those of the face. XVI Till the tale of all this flock of days alike All be done, Weary days of waiting till the month's hand strike Thirty-one, Till the clock's hand of the month break off, and end With the clock, Till the last and whitest sheep at last be penned Of the flock, I their shepherd keep the count of night and day With my song, Though my song be, like this month which once was May, All too long. XVII The incarnate sun, a tall strong youth, On old Greek eyes in sculpture smiled: But trulier had it given the truth To shape him like a child. No face full-grown of all our dearest So lightens all our darkness, none Most loved of all our hearts hold nearest To far outshines the sun, As when with sly shy smiles that feign Doubt if the hour be clear, the time Fit to break off my work again Or sport of prose or rhyme, My friend peers in on me with merry Wise face, and though the sky stay dim The very light of day, the very Sun's self comes in with him. XVIII Out of sight, Out of mind! Could the light Prove unkind? Can the sun Quite forget What was done Ere he set? Does the moon When she wanes Leave no tune That remains In the void Shell of night Overcloyed With her light? Must the shore At low tide Feel no more Hope or pride, No intense Joy to be, In the sense Of the sea— In the pulses Of her shocks It repulses, When its rocks Thrill and ring As with glee? Has my king Cast off me, Whom no bird Flying south Brings one word From his mouth? Not the ghost Of a word Riding post Have I heard, Since the day When my king Took away With him spring, And the cup Of each flower Shrivelled up That same hour, With no light Left behind. Out of sight, Out of mind! XIX Because I adore you And fall On the knees of my spirit before you— After all, You need not insult, My king, With neglect, though your spirit exult In the spring, Even me, though not worth, God knows, One word of you sent me in mirth, Or one rose Out of all in your garden That grow Where the frost and the wind never harden Flakes of snow, Nor ever is rain At all, But the roses rejoice to remain Fair and tall— The roses of love, More sweet Than blossoms that rain from above Round our feet, When under high bowers We pass, Where the west wind freckles with flowers All the grass. But a child's thoughts bear More bright Sweet visions by day, and more fair Dreams by night, Than summer's whole treasure Can be: What am I that his thought should take pleasure, Then, in me? I am only my love's True lover, With a nestful of songs, like doves Under cover, That I bring in my cap Fresh caught, To be laid on my small king's lap— Worth just nought. Yet it haply may hap That he, When the mirth in his veins is as sap In a tree, Will remember me too Some day Ere the transit be thoroughly through Of this May— Or perchance, if such grace May be, Some night when I dream of his face, Dream of me. Or if this be too high A hope For me to prefigure in my Horoscope, He may dream of the place Where we Basked once in the light of his face, Who now see Nought brighter, not one Thing bright, Than the stars and the moon and the sun, Day nor night. XX Day by darkling day, Overpassing, bears away Somewhat of the burden of this weary May. Night by numbered night, Waning, brings more near in sight Hope that grows to vision of my heart's delight. Nearer seems to burn In the dawn's rekindling urn Flame of fragrant incense, hailing his return. Louder seems each bird In the brightening branches heard Still to speak some ever more delightful word. All the mists that swim Round the dawns that grow less dim Still wax brighter and more bright with hope of him. All the suns that rise Bring that day more near our eyes When the sight of him shall clear our clouded skies. All the winds that roam Fruitful fields or fruitless foam Blow the bright hour near that brings his bright face home. XXI I hear of two far hence In a garden met, And the fragrance blown from thence Fades not yet. The one is seven years old, And my friend is he: But the years of the other have told Eighty-three. To hear these twain converse Or to see them greet Were sweeter than softest verse May be sweet. The hoar old gardener there With an eye more mild Perchance than his mild white hair Meets the child. I had rather hear the words That the twain exchange Than the songs of all the birds There that range, Call, chirp, and twitter there Through the garden-beds Where the sun alike sees fair Those two heads, And which may holier be Held in heaven of those Or more worth heart's thanks to see No man knows. XXII Of such is the kingdom of heaven. No glory that ever was shed From the crowning star of the seven That crown the north world's head, No word that ever was spoken Of human or godlike tongue, Gave ever such godlike token Since human harps were strung. No sign that ever was given To faithful or faithless eyes Showed ever beyond clouds riven So clear a Paradise. Earth's creeds may be seventy times seven And blood have defiled each creed: If of such be the kingdom of heaven, It must be heaven indeed. XXIII The wind on the downs is bright As though from the sea: And morning and night Take comfort again with me. He is nearer to-day, Each night to each morning saith, Whose return shall revive dead May With the balm of his breath. The sunset says to the moon, He is nearer to-night Whose coming in June Is looked for more than the light. Bird answers to bird, Hour passes the sign on to hour, And for joy of the bright news heard Flower murmurs to flower. The ways that were glad of his feet In the woods that he knew Grow softer to meet The sense of his footfall anew. He is near now as day, Says hope to the new-born light: He is near now as June is to May, Says love to the night. XXIV Good things I keep to console me For lack of the best of all, A child to command and control me, Bid come and remain at his call. Sun, wind, and woodland and highland, Give all that ever they gave: But my world is a cultureless island, My spirit a masterless slave. And friends are about me, and better At summons of no man stand: But I pine for the touch of a fetter, The curb of a strong king's hand. Each hour of the day in her season Is mine to be served as I will: And for no more exquisite reason Are all served idly and ill. By slavery my sense is corrupted, My soul not fit to be free: I would fain be controlled, interrupted, Compelled as a thrall may be. For fault of spur and of bridle I tire of my stall to death: My sail flaps joyless and idle For want of a small child's breath. XXV Whiter and whiter The dark lines grow, And broader opens and brighter The sense of the text below. Nightfall and morrow Bring nigher the boy Whom wanting we want not sorrow, Whom having we want no joy. Clearer and clearer The sweet sense grows Of the word which hath summer for hearer, The word on the lips of the rose. Duskily dwindles Each deathlike day, Till June rearising rekindles The depth of the darkness of May. XXVI “In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.” Stars in heaven are many, Suns in heaven but one: Nor for man may any Star supplant the sun. Many a child as joyous As our far-off king Meets as though to annoy us In the paths of spring. Sure as spring gives warning, All things dance in tune: Sun on Easter morning, Cloud and windy moon, Stars between the tossing Boughs of tuneful trees, Sails of ships recrossing Leagues of dancing seas; Best, in all this playtime, Best of all in tune, Girls more glad than Maytime, Boys more bright than June; Mixed with all those dances, Far through field and street Sing their silent glances, Ring their radiant feet. Flowers wherewith May crowned us Fall ere June be crowned: Children blossom round us All the whole year round. Is the garland worthless For one rose the less, And the feast made mirthless? Love, at least, says yes. Strange it were, with many Stars enkindling air, Should but one find any Welcome: strange it were, Had one star alone won Praise for light from far: Nay, love needs his own one Bright particular star. Hope and recollection Only lead him right In its bright reflection And collateral light. Find as yet we may not Comfort in its sphere: Yet these days will weigh not When it warms us here; When full-orbed it rises, Now divined afar: None in all the skies is Half so good a star; None that seers importune Till a sign be won: Star of our good fortune, Rise and reign, our sun! XXVII I pass by the small room now forlorn Where once each night as I passed I knew A child's bright sleep from even to morn Made sweet the whole night through. As a soundless shell, as a songless nest, Seems now the room that was radiant then And fragrant with his happier rest Than that of slumbering men. The day therein is less than the day, The night is indeed night now therein: Heavier the dark seems there to weigh, And slower the dawns begin. As a nest fulfilled with birds, as a shell Fulfilled with breath of a god's own hymn, Again shall be this bare blank cell, Made sweet again with him. XXVIII Spring darkens before us, A flame going down, With chant from the chorus Of days without crown— Cloud, rain, and sonorous Soft wind on the down. She is wearier not of us Than we of the dream That spring was to love us And joy was to gleam Through the shadows above us That shift as they stream. Half dark and half hoary, Float far on the loud Mild wind, as a glory Half pale and half proud From the twilight of story, Her tresses of cloud; Like phantoms that glimmer Of glories of old With ever yet dimmer Pale circlets of gold As darkness grows grimmer And memory more cold. Like hope growing clearer With wane of the moon, Shines toward us the nearer Gold frontlet of June, And a face with it dearer Than midsummer noon. XXIX You send me your love in a letter, I send you my love in a song: Ah child, your gift is the better, Mine does you but wrong. No fame, were the best less brittle, No praise, were it wide as earth, Is worth so much as a little Child's love may be worth. We see the children above us As they might angels above: Come back to us, child, if you love us, And bring us your love. XXX No time for books or for letters: What time should there be? No room for tasks and their fetters: Full room to be free. The wind and the sun and the Maytime Had never a guest More worthy the most that his playtime Could give of its best. If rain should come on, peradventure, (But sunshine forbid!) Vain hope in us haply might venture To dream as it did. But never may come, of all comers Least welcome, the rain, To mix with his servant the summer's Rose-garlanded train! He would write, but his hours are as busy As bees in the sun, And the jubilant whirl of their dizzy Dance never is done. The message is more than a letter, Let love understand, And the thought of his joys even better Than sight of his hand. XXXI Wind, high-souled, full-hearted South-west wind of the spring! Ere April and earth had parted, Skies, bright with thy forward wing, Grew dark in an hour with the shadow behind it, that bade not a bird dare sing. Wind whose feet are sunny, Wind whose wings are cloud, With lips more sweet than honey Still, speak they low or loud, Rejoice now again in the strength of thine heart: let the depth of thy soul wax proud. We hear thee singing or sighing, Just not given to sight, All but visibly flying Between the clouds and the light, And the light in our hearts is enkindled, the shadow therein of the clouds put to flight. From the gift of thine hands we gather The core of the flowers therein, Keen glad heart of heather, Hot sweet heart of whin, Twin breaths in thy godlike breath close blended of wild spring's wildest of kin. All but visibly beating We feel thy wings in the far Clear waste, and the plumes of them fleeting, Soft as swan's plumes are, And strong as a wild swan's pinions, and swift as the flash of the flight of a star. As the flight of a planet enkindled Seems thy far soft flight Now May's reign has dwindled And the crescent of June takes light And the presence of summer is here, and the hope of a welcomer presence in sight. Wind, sweet-souled, great-hearted Southwest wind on the wold! From us is a glory departed That now shall return as of old, Borne back on thy wings as an eagle's expanding, and crowned with the sundawn's gold. There is not a flower but rejoices, There is not a leaf but has heard: All the fields find voices, All the woods are stirred: There is not a nest but is brighter because of the coming of one bright bird. Out of dawn and morning, Noon and afternoon, The sun to the world gives warning Of news that brightens the moon; And the stars all night exult with us, hearing of joy that shall come with June. SUNRISE If the wind and the sunlight of April and August had mingled the past and hereafter In a single adorable season whose life were a rapture of love and of laughter, And the blithest of singers were back with a song; if again from his tomb as from prison, If again from the night or the twilight of ages Aristophanes had arisen, With the gold-feathered wings of a bird that were also a god upon earth at his shoulders, And the gold-flowing laugh of the manhood of old at his lips, for a joy to beholders, He alone unrebuked of presumption were able to set to some adequate measure The delight of our eyes in the dawn that restores them the sun of their sense and the pleasure. For the days of the darkness of spirit are over for all of us here, and the season When desire was a longing, and absence a thorn, and rejoicing a word without reason. For the roof overhead of the pines is astir with delight as of jubilant voices, And the floor underfoot of the bracken and heather alive as a heart that rejoices. For the house that was childless awhile, and the light of it darkened, the pulse of it dwindled, Rings radiant again with a child's bright feet, with the light of his face is rekindled. And the ways of the meadows that knew him, the sweep of the down that the sky's belt closes, Grow gladder at heart than the soft wind made them whose feet were but fragrant with roses, Though the fall of the year be upon us, who trusted in June and by June were defrauded, And the summer that brought us not back the desire of our eyes be gone hence unapplauded. For July came joyless among us, and August went out from us arid and sterile, And the hope of our hearts, as it seemed, was no more than a flower that the seasons imperil, And the joy of our hearts, as it seemed, than a thought which regret had not heart to remember, Till four dark months overpast were atoned for, and summer began in September. Hark, April again as a bird in the house with a child's voice hither and thither: See, May in the garden again with a child's face cheering the woods ere they wither. June laughs in the light of his eyes, and July on the sunbright cheeks of him slumbers, And August glows in a smile more sweet than the cadence of gold-mouthed numbers. In the morning the sight of him brightens the sun, and the noon with delight in him flushes, And the silence of nightfall is music about him as soft as the sleep that it hushes. We awake with a sense of a sunrise that is not a gift of the sundawn's giving, And a voice that salutes us is sweeter than all sounds else in the world of the living, And a presence that warms us is brighter than all in the world of our visions beholden, Though the dreams of our sleep were as those that the light of a world without grief makes golden. For the best that the best of us ever devised as a likeness of heaven and its glory, What was it of old, or what is it and will be for ever, in song or in story, Or in shape or in colour of carven or painted resemblance, adored of all ages, But a vision recorded of children alive in the pictures of old or the pages? Where children are not, heaven is not, and heaven if they come not again shall be never: But the face and the voice of a child are assurance of heaven and its promise for ever. THE HEPTALOGIA OR THE SEVEN AGAINST SENSE: A CAP WITH SEVEN BELLS SPECIMENS OF MODERN POETS THE HIGHER PANTHEISM IN A NUTSHELL One, who is not, we see: but one, whom we see not, is: Surely this is not that: but that is assuredly this. What, and wherefore, and whence? for under is over and under: If thunder could be without lightning, lightning could be without thunder. Doubt is faith in the main: but faith, on the whole, is doubt: We cannot believe by proof: but could we believe without? Why, and whither, and how? for barley and rye are not clover: Neither are straight lines curves: yet over is under and over. Two and two may be four: but four and four are not eight: Fate and God may be twain: but God is the same thing as fate. Ask a man what he thinks, and get from a man what he feels: God, once caught in the fact, shows you a fair pair of heels. Body and spirit are twins: God only knows which is which: The soul squats down in the flesh, like a tinker drunk in a ditch. More is the whole than a part: but half is more than the whole: Clearly, the soul is the body: but is not the body the soul? One and two are not one: but one and nothing is two: Truth can hardly be false, if falsehood cannot be true. Once the mastodon was: pterodactyls were common as cocks: Then the mammoth was God: now is He a prize ox. Parallels all things are: yet many of these are askew: You are certainly I: but certainly I am not you. Springs the rock from the plain, shoots the stream from the rock: Cocks exist for the hen: but hens exist for the cock. God, whom we see not, is: and God, who is not, we see: Fiddle, we know, is diddle: and diddle, we take it, is dee. JOHN JONES'S WIFE I AT THE PIANO I Love me and leave me; what love bids retrieve me? can June's fist grasp May? Leave me and love me; hopes eyed once above me like spring's sprouts decay; Fall as the snow falls, when summer leaves grow false—cards packed for storm's play! II Nay, say Decay's self be but last May's elf, wing shifted, eye sheathed— Changeling in April's crib rocked, who lets 'scape rills locked fast since frost breathed— Skin cast (think!) adder-like, now bloom bursts bladder-like,—bloom frost bequeathed? III Ah, how can fear sit and hear as love hears it grief's heart's cracked grate's screech? Chance lets the gate sway that opens on hate's way and shews on shame's beach Crouched like an imp sly change watch sweet love's shrimps lie, a toothful in each. IV Time feels his tooth slip on husks wet from Truth's lip, which drops them and grins— Shells where no throb stirs of life left in lobsters since joy thrilled their fins— Hues of the prawn's tail or comb that makes dawn stale, so red for our sins! V Years blind and deaf use the soul's joys as refuse, heart's peace as manure, Reared whence, next June's rose shall bloom where our moons rose last year, just as pure: Moons' ends match roses' ends: men by beasts' noses' ends mete sin's stink's cure. VI Leaves love last year smelt now feel dead love's tears melt—flies caught in time's mesh! Salt are the dews in which new time breeds new sin, brews blood and stews flesh; Next year may see dead more germs than this weeded and reared them afresh. VII Old times left perish, there's new time to cherish; life just shifts its tune; As, when the day dies, earth, half afraid, eyes the growth of the moon; Love me and save me, take me or waive me; death takes one so soon! II BY THE CLIFF I Is it daytime (guess), You that feed my soul To excess With that light in those eyes And those curls drawn like a scroll In that round grave guise? No or yes? II Oh, the end, I'd say! Such a foolish thing (Pure girls' play!) As a mere mute heart, Was it worth a kiss, a ring, This? for two must part— Not to-day. III Look, the whole sand crawls, Hums, a heaving hive, Scrapes and scrawls— Such a buzz and burst! Here just one thing's not alive, One that was at first— But life palls. IV Yes, my heart, I know, Just my heart's stone dead— Yes, just so. Sick with heat, those worms Drop down scorched and overfed— No more need of germs! Let them go. V Yes, but you now, look, You, the rouged stage female With a crook, Chalked Arcadian sham, You that made my soul's sleep's dream ail— Your soul fit to damn? Shut the book. III ON THE SANDS I There was nothing at all in the case (conceive) But love; being love, it was not (understand) Such a thing as the years let fall (believe) Like the rope's coil dropt from a fisherman's hand When the boat's hauled up—“by your leave!” II So—well! How that crab writhes—leg after leg Drawn, as a worm draws ring upon ring Gradually, not gladly! Chicken or egg, Is it more than the ransom (say) of a king (Take my meaning at least) that I beg? III Not so! You were ready to learn, I think, What the world said! “He loves you too well (suppose) For such leanings! These poets, their love's mere ink— Like a flower, their flame flashes—a rosebud, blows— Then it all drops down at a wink! IV “Ah, the instance! A curl of a blossomless vine The vinedresser passing it sickens to see And mutters ‘Much hope (under God) of His wine From the branch and the bark of a barren tree Spring reared not, and winter lets pine— V “‘His wine that should glorify (saith He) the cup That a man beholding (not tasting) might say “Pour out life at a draught, drain it dry, drink it up, Give this one thing, and huddle the rest away— Save the bitch, and be hanged to the pup!” VI “‘Let it rot then!’ which saying, he leaves it—we'll guess, Feels (if the sap move at all) thus much— Yearns, and would blossom, would quicken no less, Bud at an eye's glance, flower at a touch— ‘Die, perhaps, would you not, for her?’—‘Yes!’ VII “Note the hitch there! That's piteous—so much being done, (He'll think some day, your lover) so little to do! Such infinite days to wear out, once begun! Since the hand its glove holds, and the footsole its shoe— Overhead too there's always the sun!” VIII Oh, no doubt they had said so, your friends—been profuse Of good counsel, wise hints—“where the trap lurks, walk warily— Squeeze the fruit to the core ere you count on the juice! For the graft may fail, shift, wax, change colour, wane, vary, lie—” You were cautious, God knows—to what use? IX This crab's wiser, it strikes me—no twist but implies life— Not a curl but's so fit you could find none fitter— For the brute from its brutehood looks up thus and eyes life— Stoop your soul down and listen, you'll hear it twitter, Laughing lightly,—my crab's life's the wise life! X Those who've read S. T. Coleridge remember how Sammy sighs To his pensive (I think he says) Sara—“most soothing-sweet”— Crab's bulk's less (look!) than man's—yet (quoth Cancer) I am my size, And my bulk's girth contents me! Man's maw (see?) craves two things—wheat And flesh likewise—man's gluttonous—damn his eyes! XI Crab's content with crab's provender: crab's love, if soothing, Is no sweeter than pincers are soft—and a new sickle Cuts no sharper than crab's claws nip, keen as boar's toothing! Yet crab's love's no less fervent than bard's, if less musical— 'Tis a new thing I'd lilt—but a true thing. XII Old songs tell us, of all drinks for Englishmen fighting, ale's Out and out best: salt water contents crab, it seems to me, Though pugnacious as sailors, and skilled to steer right in gales That craze pilots, if slow to sing—“Sleep'st thou? thou dream'st o' me!” In such love-strains as mine—or a nightingale's. XIII Ah, now, look you—tail foremost, the beast sets seaward— The sea draws it, sand sucks it—he's wise, my crab! From the napkin out jumps his one talent—good steward, Just judge! So a man shirks the smile or the stab, And sets his sail duly to leeward! XIV Trust me? Hardly! I bid you not lean (remark) On my spirit, your spirit—my flesh, your flesh— Hold my hand, and tread safe through the horrible dark— Quench my soul as with sprinklings of snow, then refresh With some blast of new bellows the spark! XV By no means! This were easy (men tell me) to say— “Give her all, throw your chance up, fall back on her heart!” (Say my friends) “she must change! after night follows day—” No such fool! I am safe set in hell, for my part— So let heaven do the worst now he may! XVI What they bid me? Well, this, nothing more—“Tell her this— ‘You are mine, I yours, though the whole world fail— Though things are not, I know there is one thing which is— Though the oars break, there's hope for us yet—hoist the sail! Oh, your heart! what's the heart? but your kiss!’ XVII “Then she breaks, she drops down, she lies flat at your feet— Take her then!” Well, I knew it—what fools are men! Take the bee by her horns, will your honey prove sweet? Sweet is grass—will you pasture your cows in a fen? Oh, if contraries could but once meet! XVIII Love you call it? Some twitch in the moon's face (observe), Wet blink of her eyelid, tear dropt about dewfall, Cheek flushed or obscured—does it make the sky swerve? Fetch the test, work the question to rags, bring to proof all— Find what souls want and bodies deserve! XIX Ah, we know you! Your soul works to infinite ends, Frets, uses life up for death's sake, takes pains, Flings down love's self—“but you, bear me witness, my friends! Have I lost spring? count up (see) the winter's fresh gains! Is the shrub spoilt? the pine's hair impends!” XX What, you'd say—“Mark how God works! Years crowd, time wears thin, Earth keeps good yet, the sun goes on, stars hold their own, And you'll change, climb past sight of the world, shift your skin, Never heeding how life moans—‘more flesh now, less bone!’ For that cheek's worn waste outline (death's grin) XXI “Pleads with time still—‘what good if I lose this? but see—’” (There's the crab gone!)“‘I said, “Though earth sinks,”’” (you perceive? Ah, true, back there!) your soul now—“‘“yet some vein might be (Could one find it alive in the heart's core's pulse, cleave Through the life-springs where “you” melts in “me”)— XXII “‘“Some true vein of the absolute soul, which survives All that flesh runs to waste through”—and lo, this fails! Here's death close on us! One life? a million of lives! Why choose one sail to watch of these infinite sails? Time's a tennis-play? thank you, no, fives! XXIII “‘Stop life's ball then!’ Such folly! melt earth down for that, Till the pure ore eludes you and leaves you raw scoriæ? Pish, the vein's wrong!” But you, friends—come, what were you at When God spat you out suddenly? what was the story He Cut short thus, the growth He laid flat? XXIV Wait! the crab's twice alive, mark! Oh, worthy, your soul, Of strange ends, great results, novel labours! Take note, I reject this for one! (ay, now, straight to the hole! Safe in sand there—your skirts smooth out all as they float!) I, shirk drinking through flaws in the bowl? XXV Or suppose now that rock's cleft—grim, scored to the quick, As a man's face kept fighting all life through gets scored, Mossed and marked with grey purulent leprosies, sick, Flat and foul as man's life here (be swift with your sword— Cut the soul out, stuck fast where thorns prick!) XXVI —Say it let the rock's heart out, its meaning, the thing All was made for, devised, ruled out gradually, planned— Ah, that sea-shell, perhaps—since it lies, such a ring Of pure colour, a cup full of sunbeams, to stand (Say, in Lent) at the priest's hand—(no king!) XXVII Blame the cleft then? Praise rather! So—just a chance gone! Had you said—“Save the seed and secure souls in flower”— Ah, how time laughs, years palpitate, pro grapples con, Till one day you shrug shoulders—“Well, gone, the good hour!” Till one night—“Is God off now? or on?” IV UP THE SPOUT I Hi! Just you drop that! Stop, I say! Shirk work, think slink off, twist friend's wrist? Where that spined sand's lined band's the bay— Lined blind with true sea's blue, as due— Promising—not to pay? II For the sea's debt leaves wet the sand; Burst worst fate's weights in one burst gun? A man's own yacht, blown—What? off land? Tack back, or veer round here, then—queer! Reef points, though—understand? III I'm blest if I do. Sigh? be blowed! Love's doves make break life's ropes, eh? Tropes! Faith's brig, baulked, sides caulked, rides at road; Hope's gropes befogged, storm-dogged and bogged— Clogged, water-logged, her load! IV Stowed, by Jove, right and tight, away! No show now how best plough sea's brow, Wrinkling—breeze quick, tease thick, ere day, Clear sheer wave's sheen of green, I mean, With twinkling wrinkles—eh? V Sea sprinkles winkles, tinkles light Shell's bells—boy's joys that hap to snap! It's just sea's fun, breeze done, to spite God's rods that scourge her surge, I'd urge— Not proper, is it—quite? VI See, fore and aft, life's craft undone! Crank plank, split spritsail—mark, sea's lark! That grey cold sea's old sprees, begun When men lay dark i' the ark, no spark, All water—just God's fun! VII Not bright, at best, his jest to these Seemed—screamed, shrieked, wreaked on kin for sin! When for mirth's yell earth's knell seemed please Some dumb new grim great whim in him Made Jews take chalk for cheese. VIII Could God's rods bruise God's Jews? Their jowls Bobbed, sobbed, gaped, aped the plaice in face: None heard, 'tis odds, his—God's—folk's howls. Now, how must I apply, to try This hookiest-beaked of owls? IX Well, I suppose God knows—I don't. Time's crimes mark dark men's types, in stripes Broad as fen's lands men's hands were wont Leave grieve unploughed, though proud and loud With birds' words—No! he won't! X One never should think good impossible. Eh? say I'd hide this Jew's oil's cruse— His shop might hold bright gold, engrossible By spy—spring's air takes there no care To wave the heath-flower's glossy bell! XI But gold bells chime in time there, coined— Gold! Old Sphinx winks there—“Read my screed!” Doctrine Jews learn, use, burn for, joined (Through new craft's stealth) with health and wealth— At once all three purloined! XII I rose with dawn, to pawn, no doubt, (Miss this chance, glance untried aside?) John's shirt, my—no! Ay, so—the lout! Let yet the door gape, store on floor And not a soul about? XIII Such men lay traps, perhaps—and I'm Weak—meek—mild—child of woe, you know! But theft, I doubt, my lout calls crime. Shrink? Think! Love's dawn in pawn—you spawn Of Jewry! Just in time! V OFF THE PIER I One last glance at these sands and stones! Time goes past men, and lives to his liking, Steals, and ruins, and sometimes atones. Why should he be king, though, and why not I king? There now, that wind, like a swarm of sick drones! II Is it heaven or mere earth (come!) that moves so and moans? Oh, I knew, when you loved me, my soul was in flowerage— Now the frost comes; from prime, though, I watched through to nones, Read love's litanies over—his age was not our age! No more flutes in this world for me now, dear! trombones. III All that youth once denied and made mouths at, age owns. Facts put fangs out and bite us; life stings and grows viperous; And time's fugues are a hubbub of meaningless tones. Once we followed the piper; now why not the piper us? Love, grown grey, plays mere solos; we want antiphones. IV And we sharpen our wits up with passions for hones, Melt down loadstars for magnets, use women for whetstones, Learn to bear with dead calms by remembering cyclones, Snap strings short with sharp thumbnails, till silence begets tones, Burn our souls out, shift spirits, turn skins and change zones; V Then the heart, when all's done with, wakes, whimpers, intones Some lost fragment of tune it thought sweet ere it grew sick; (Is it life that disclaims this, or death that disowns?) Mere dead metal, scrawled bars—ah, one touch, you make music! Love's worth saving, youth doubts, but experience depones. VI In the darkness (right Dickens) of Tom-All-Alone's Or the Morgue out in Paris, where tragedy centuples Life's effects by Death's algebra, Shakespeare (Malone's) Might have said sleep was murdered—new scholiasts have sent you pills To purge text of him! Bread? give me—Scotticè—scones! VII Think, what use, when youth's saddle galls bay's back or roan's, To seek chords on love's keys to strike, other than his chords? There's an error joy winks at and grief half condones, Or life's counterpoint grates the C major of discords— 'Tis man's choice 'twixt sluts rose-crowned and queens age dethrones. VIII I for instance might groan as a bag-pipe groans, Give the flesh of my heart for sharp sorrows to flagellate, Grief might grind my cheeks down, age make sticks of my bones, (Though a queen drowned in tears must be worth more than Madge elate) First edition:— And my face bear his brand—mine, that once bore Love's badge elate! Rose might turn burdock, and pine-apples cones; IX My skin might change to a pitiful crone's, My lips to a lizard's, my hair to weed, My features, in fact, to a series of loans; Thus much is conceded; now, you, concede You would hardly salute me by choice, John Jones? THE POET AND THE WOODLOUSE Said a poet to a woodlouse—“Thou art certainly my brother; I discern in thee the markings of the fingers of the Whole; And I recognize, in spite of all the terrene smut and smother, In the colours shaded off thee, the suggestions of a soul. “Yea,” the poet said, “I smell thee by some passive divination, I am satisfied with insight of the measure of thine house; What had happened I conjecture, in a blank and rhythmic passion, Had the æons thought of making thee a man, and me a louse. “The broad lives of upper planets, their absorption and digestion, Food and famine, health and sickness, I can scrutinize and test; Through a shiver of the senses comes a resonance of question, And by proof of balanced answer I decide that I am best. “Man, the fleshly marvel, alway feels a certain kind of awe stick To the skirts of contemplation, cramped with nympholeptic weight: Feels his faint sense charred and branded by the touch of solar caustic, On the forehead of his spirit feels the footprint of a Fate.” “Notwithstanding which, O poet,” spake the woodlouse, very blandly, “I am likewise the created,—I the equipoise of thee; I the particle, the atom, I behold on either hand lie The inane of measured ages that were embryos of me. “I am fed with intimations, I am clothed with consequences, And the air I breathe is coloured with apocalyptic blush: Ripest-budded odours blossom out of dim chaotic stenches, And the Soul plants spirit-lilies in sick leagues of human slush. “I am thrilled half cosmically through by cryptophantic surgings, Till the rhythmic hills roar silent through a spongious kind of blee: And earth's soul yawns disembowelled of her pancreatic organs, Like a madrepore if mesmerized, in rapt catalepsy. “And I sacrifice, a Levite—and I palpitate, a poet;— Can I close dead ears against the rush and resonance of things? Symbols in me breathe and flicker up the heights of the heroic; Earth's worst spawn, you said, and cursed me? look! approve me! I have wings. “Ah, men's poets! men's conventions crust you round and swathe you mist-like, And the world's wheels grind your spirits down the dust ye overtrod: We stand sinlessly stark-naked in effulgence of the Christlight, And our polecat chokes not cherubs; and our skunk smells sweet to God. “For He grasps the pale Created by some thousand vital handles, Till a Godshine, bluely winnowed through the sieve of thunderstorms, Shimmers up the non-existent round the churning feet of angels; And the atoms of that glory may be seraphs, being worms. “Friends, your nature underlies us and your pulses overplay us; Ye, with social sores unbandaged, can ye sing right and steer wrong? For the transient cosmic, rooted in imperishable chaos, Must be kneaded into drastics as material for a song. “Eyes once purged from homebred vapours through humanitarian passion See that monochrome a despot through a democratic prism; Hands that rip the soul up, reeking from divine evisceration, Not with priestlike oil anoint him, but a stronger-smelling chrism. “Pass, O poet, retransfigured! God, the psychometric rhapsode, Fills with fiery rhythms the silence, stings the dark with stars that blink; All eternities hang round him like an old man's clothes collapsèd, While he makes his mundane music—and he will not stop, I think.” THE PERSON OF THE HOUSE IDYL CCCLXVI: THE KID THE ACCOMPANIMENTS 1. The Monthly Nurse 2. The Caudle 3. The Sentences I. THE MONTHLY NURSE The sickly airs had died of damp; Through huddling leaves the holy chime Flagged; I, expecting Mrs. Gamp, Thought—“Will the woman come in time?” Upstairs I knew the matron bed Held her whose name confirms all joy To me; and tremblingly I said, “Ah! will it be a girl or boy?” And, soothed, my fluttering doubts began To sift the pleasantness of things; Developing the unshapen man, An eagle baffled of his wings; Considering, next, how fair the state And large the license that sublimes A nineteenth-century female fate— Sweet cause that thralls my liberal rhymes! And Chastities and colder Shames, Decorums mute and marvellous, And fair Behaviour that reclaims All fancies grown erroneous, Moved round me musing, till my choice Faltered. A female in a wig Stood by me, and a drouthy voice Announced her—Mrs. Betsy Prig. 2. THE CAUDLE Sweet Love that sways the reeling years, The crown and chief of certitudes, For whose calm eyes and modest ears Time writes the rule and text of prudes— That, surpliced, stoops a nuptial head, Nor chooses to live blindly free, But, with all pulses quieted, Plays tunes of domesticity— That Love I sing of and have sung And mean to sing till Death yawn sheer, He rules the music of my tongue, Stills it or quickens, there or here. I say but this: as we went up I heard the Monthly give a sniff And “if the big dog makes the pup—” She murmured—then repeated “if!” The caudle on a slab was placed; She snuffed it, snorting loud and long; I fled—I would not stop to taste— And dreamed all night of things gone wrong. 3. THE SENTENCES I Abortive Love is half a sin; But Love's abortions dearer far Than wheels without an axle-pin Or life without a married star. II My rules are hard to understand For him whom sensual rules depress; A bandbox in a midwife's hand May hold a costlier bridal dress. III “I like her not; in fact I loathe; Bugs hath she brought from London beds.” Friend! wouldst thou rather bear their growth Or have a baby with two heads? IDYL CCCLXVI THE KID My spirit, in the doorway's pause, Fluttered with fancies in my breast; Obsequious to all decent laws, I felt exceedingly distressed. I knew it rude to enter there With Mrs. V. in such a state; And, 'neath a magisterial air, Felt actually indelicate. I knew the nurse began to grin; I turned to greet my Love. Said she— “Confound your modesty, come in! —What shall we call the darling, V.?” (There are so many charming names! Girls'—Peg, Moll, Doll, Fan, Kate, Blanche, Bab: Boys'—Mahershahal-hashbaz, James, Luke, Nick, Dick, Mark, Aminadab.) Lo, as the acorn to the oak, As well-heads to the river's height, As to the chicken the moist yolk, As to high noon the day's first white— Such is the baby to the man. There, straddling one red arm and leg, Lay my last work, in length a span, Half hatched, and conscious of the egg. A creditable child, I hoped; And half a score of joys to be Through sunny lengths of prospect sloped Smooth to the bland futurity. O, fate surpassing other dooms, O, hope above all wrecks of time! O, light that fills all vanquished glooms, O, silent song o'ermastering rhyme! I covered either little foot, I drew the strings about its waist; Pink as the unshell'd inner fruit, But barely decent, hardly chaste, Its nudity had startled me; But when the petticoats were on, “I know,” I said; “its name shall be Paul Cyril Athanasius John.” “Why,” said my wife, “the child's a girl.” My brain swooned, sick with failing sense; With all perception in a whirl, How could I tell the difference? “Nay,” smiled the nurse, “the child's a boy.” And all my soul was soothed to hear That so it was: then startled Joy Mocked Sorrow with a doubtful tear. And I was glad as one who sees For sensual optics things unmeet: As purity makes passion freeze, So faith warns science off her beat. Blessed are they that have not seen, And yet, not seeing, have believed: To walk by faith, as preached the Dean, And not by sight, have I achieved. Let love, that does not look, believe; Let knowledge, that believes not, look: Truth pins her trust on falsehood's sleeve, While reason blunders by the book. Then Mrs. Prig addressed me thus; “Sir, if you'll be advised by me, You'll leave the blessed babe to us; It's my belief he wants his tea.” LAST WORDS OF A SEVENTH-RATE POET Bill, I feel far from quite right—if not further: already the pill Seems, if I may say so, to bubble inside me. A poet's heart, Bill, Is a sort of a thing that is made of the tenderest young bloom on a fruit. You may pass me the mixture at once, if you please—and I'll thank you to boot For that poem—and then for the julep. This really is damnable stuff! (Not the poem, of course.) Do you snivel, old friend? well, it's nasty enough, But I think I can stand it—I think so—ay, Bill, and I could were it worse. But I'll tell you a thing that I can't and I won't. 'Tis the old, old curse— The gall of the gold-fruited Eden, the lure of the angels that fell. 'Tis the core of the fruit snake-spotted in the hush of the shadows of hell, Where a lost man sits with his head drawn down, and a weight on his eyes. You know what I mean, Bill—the tender and delicate mother of lies, Woman, the devil's first cousin—no doubt by the female side. The breath of her mouth still moves in my hair, and I know that she lied, And I feel her, Bill, sir, inside me—she operates there like a drug. Were it better to live like a beetle, to wear the cast clothes of a slug, Be the louse in the locks of the hangman, the mote in the eye of the bat, Than to live and believe in a woman, who must one day grow aged and fat? You must see it's preposterous, Bill, sir. And yet, how the thought of it clings! I have lived out my time—I have prigged lots of verse—I have kissed (ah, that stings!) Lips that swore I had cribbed every line that I wrote on them—cribbed—honour bright! Then I loathed her; but now I forgive her; perhaps after all she was right. Yet I swear it was shameful—unwomanly, Bill, sir—to say that I fibbed. Why, the poems were mine, for I bought them in print. Cribbed? of course they were cribbed. Yet I wouldn't say, cribbed from the French—Lady Bathsheba thought it was vulgar— But picked up on the banks of the Don, from the lips of a highly intelligent Bulgar. I'm aware, Bill, that's out of all metre—I can't help it—I'm none of your sort Who set metres, by Jove, above morals—not exactly. They don't go to Court— As I mentioned one night to that cowslip-faced pet, Lady Rahab Redrabbit (Whom the Marquis calls Drabby for short). Well, I say, if you want a thing, grab it— That's what I did, at least, when I took that danseuse to a swell cabaret, Where expense was no consideration. A poet, you see, now and then must be gay. (I declined to give more, I remember, than fifty centeems to the waiter; For I asked him if that was enough; and the jackanapes answered—Peut-être. Ah, it isn't in you to draw up a menu such as ours was, though humble: When I told Lady Shoreditch, she thought it a regular grand tout ensemble.) She danced the heart out of my body—I can see in the glare of the lights, I can see her again as I saw her that evening, in spangles and tights. When I spoke to her first, her eye flashed so, I heard—as I fancied—the spark whiz From her eyelid—I said so next day to that jealous old fool of a Marquis. She reminded me, Bill, of a lovely volcano, whose entrails are lava— Or (you know my penchant for original types) of the upas in Java. In the curve of her sensitive nose was a singular species of dimple, Where the flush was the mark of an angel's creased kiss—if it wasn't a pimple. Now I'm none of your bashful John Bulls who don't know a pilau from a puggaree Nor a chili, by George, from a chopstick. So, sir, I marched into her snuggery, And proposed a light supper by way of a finish. I treated her, Bill, To six entrées of ortolans, sprats, maraschino, and oysters. It made her quite ill. Of which moment of sickness I took some advantage. I held her like this, And availed myself, sir, of her sneezing, to shut up her lips with a kiss. The waiters, I saw, were quite struck; and I felt, I may say, entre nous, Like Don Juan, Lauzun, Almaviva, Lord Byron, and old Richelieu. (You'll observe, Bill, that rhyme's quite Parisian; a Londoner, sir, would have cited old Q. People tell me the French in my verses recalls that of Jeames or John Thomas: I Must maintain it's as good as the average accent of British diplomacy.) These are moments that thrill the whole spirit with spasms that excite and exalt. I stood more than the peer of the great Casanova—you know—de Seingalt. She was worth, sir, I say it without hesitation, two brace of her sisters. Ah, why should all honey turn rhubarb—all cherries grow onions—all kisses leave blisters? Oh, and why should I ask myself questions? I've heard such before—once or twice. Ah, I can't understand it—but, O, I imagine it strikes me as nice. There's a deity shapes us our ends, sir, rough-hew them, my boy, how we will— As I stated myself in a poem I published last year, you know, Bill— Where I mentioned that that was the question—to be, or, by Jove, not to be. Ah, it's something—you'll think so hereafter—to wait on a poet like me. Had I written no more than those verses on that Countess I used to call Pussy— Yes, Minette or Manon—and—you'll hardly believe it—she said they were all out of Musset. Now I don't say they weren't—but what then? and I don't say they were—I'll bet pounds against pennies on The subject—I wish I may never die Laureate, if some of them weren't out of Tennyson. And I think—I don't like to be certain, with Death, so to speak, by me, frowning— But I think there were some—say a dozen, perhaps, or a score—out of Browning. And—though God knows his poems are not (as all mine are, sir) perfumed with orris— Or at least with patchouli—I wouldn't be sworn there were none out of Morris. And it's possible—only the legend of Circe is quite an old yarn—old As the hills—that I might have been thinking, perhaps, of a poem by Arnold When I sang how Ulysses—Odysseus I mean—would have yearned to dishevel her Bright hair with his kisses, and painted myself at her feet—a Strayed Reveller. As for poets who go on a contrary tack to what I go and you go— You remember my lyrics translated—like “sweet bully Bottom”—from Hugo? Though I will say it's curious that simply on just that account there should be Men so bold as to say that not one of my poems was written by me. It would stir the political bile or the physical spleen of a drab or a Tory To hear critics disputing my claim to Empedocles, Maud, and the Laboratory. Yes, it's singular—nay, I can't think of a parallel (ain't it a high lark? As that Countess would say)—there are few men believe it was I wrote the Ode to a Skylark. And it often has given myself and Lord Albert no end of diversion To hear fellows maintain to my face it was Wordsworth who wrote the Excursion, When they know that whole reams of the verses recur in my authorized works Here and there, up and down! Why, such readers are infidels—heretics—Turks. And the pitiful critics who think in their paltry presumption to pay me a Pretty compliment, pairing me off, sir, with Keats—as if he could write Lamia! While I never produced a more characteristic and exquisite book, One that gave me more real satisfaction, than did, on the whole, Lalla Rookh. Was it there that I called on all debtors, being pestered myself by a creditor, (he Isn't paid yet) to rise, by the proud appellation of bondsmen—hereditary? Yes—I think so. And yet, on my word, I can't think why I think it was so. It more probably was in the poem I made a few seasons ago On that Duchess—her name now? ah, thus one outlives a whole cycle of joys! Fair supplants black and brown succeeds golden. The poem made rather a noise. And indeed I have seen worse verses; but as for the woman, my friend— Though his neck had been never so stiff, she'd have made a philosopher bend. As the broken heart of a sunset that bleeds pure purple and gold In the shudder and swoon of the sickness of colour, the agonies old That engirdle the brows of the day when he sinks with a spasm into rest And the splash of his kingly blood is dashed on the skirts of the west, Even such was my own, when I felt how much sharper than any snake's tooth Was the passion that made me mistake Lady Eve for her niece Lady Ruth. The whole world, colourless, lapsed. Earth fled from my feet like a dream, And the whirl of the walls of Space was about me, and moved as a stream Flowing and ebbing and flowing all night to a weary tune (“Such as that of my verses”? Get out!) in the face of a sick-souled moon. The keen stars kindled and faded and fled, and the wind in my ears Was the wail of a poet for failure—you needn't come snivelling tears And spoiling the mixture, confound you, with dropping your tears into that! I know I'm pathetic—I must be—and you soft-hearted and fat, And I'm grateful of course for your kindness—there, don't come hugging me, now— But because a fellow's pathetic, you needn't low like a cow. I should like—on my soul, I should like—to remember—but somehow I can't— If the lady whose love has reduced me to this was the niece or the aunt. But whichever it was, I feel sure, when I published my lays of last year (You remember their title—The Tramp—only seven-and-sixpence—not dear), I sent her a copy (perhaps her tears fell on the title-page—yes— I should like to imagine she wept)—and the Bride of Bulgaria (MS.) I forwarded with it. The lyrics, no doubt, she found bitter—and sweet; But the Bride she rejected, you know, with expressions I will not repeat. Well—she did no more than all publishers did. Though my prospects were marred, I can pity and pardon them. Blindness, mere blindness! And yet it was hard. For a poet, Bill, is a blossom—a bird—a billow—a breeze— A kind of creature that moves among men as a wind among trees. And a bard who is also the pet of patricians and dowagers doubly can Express his contempt for canaille in his fables where beasts are republican. Yet with all my disdainful forgiveness for men so deficient in ton I cannot but feel it was cruel—I cannot but think it was wrong. I with the heat of my heart still burning against all bars As the fire of the dawn, so to speak, in the blanched blank brows of the stars— I with my tremulous lips made pale by musical breath— I with the shade in my eyes that was left by the kisses of Death— (For Death came near me in youth, and touched my face with his face, And put in my lips the songs that belong to a desolate place— Desolate truly, my heart and my lips, till her kiss filled them up!) I with my soul like wine poured out with my flesh for the cup— It was hard for me—it was hard—Bill, Bill, you great owl, was it not? For the day creeps in like a Fate: and I think my grand passion is rot: And I dreamily seem to perceive, by the light of a life's dream done, The lotion at six, and the mixture at ten, and the draught before one. Yes—I feel rather better. Man's life is a mull, at the best; And the patent perturbator pills are like bullets of lead in my chest. When a man's whole spirit is like the lost Pleiad, a blown-out star, Is there comfort in Holloway, Bill? is there hope of salvation in Parr? True, most things work to their end—and an end that the shroud overlaps. Under lace, under silk, under gold, sir, the skirt of a winding-sheet flaps— Which explains, if you think of it, Bill, why I can't, though my soul thereon broodeth, Quite make out if I loved Lady Tamar as much as I loved Lady Judith. Yet her dress was of violet velvet, her hair was hyacinth-hued, And her ankles—no matter. A face where the music of every mood Was touched by the tremulous fingers of passionate feeling, and made Strange melodies, scornful, but sweeter than strings whereon sorrow has played To enrapture the hearing of mirth when his garland of blossom and green Turns to lead on the anguished forehead—“you don't understand what I mean”? Well, of course I knew you were stupid—you always were stupid at school— Now don't say you weren't—but I'm hanged if I thought you were quite such a fool! You don't see the point of all this? I was talking of sickness and death— In that poem I made years ago, I said this—“Love, the flower-time whose breath Smells sweet through a summer of kisses and perfumes an autumn of tears Is sadder at root than a winter—its hopes heavy-hearted like fears. Though I love your Grace more than I love little Letty, the maid of the mill, Yet the heat of your lips when I kiss them” (you see we were intimate, Bill) “And the beat of the delicate blood in your eyelids of azure and white Leave the taste of the grave in my mouth and the shadow of death on my sight. Fill the cup—twine the chaplet—come into the garden—get out of the house— Drink to me with your eyes—there's a banquet behind, where worms only carouse! As I said to sweet Katie, who lived by the brook on the land Philip farmed— Worms shall graze where my kisses found pasture!” The Duchess, I may say, was charmed. It was read to the Duke, and he cried like a child. If you'll give me a pill, I'll go on till past midnight. That poem was said to be—Somebody's, Bill. But you see you can always be sure of my hand as the mother that bore me By the fact that I never write verse which has never been written before me. Other poets—I blush for them, Bill—may adore and repudiate in turn a Libitina, perhaps, or Pandemos; my Venus, you know, is Laverna. Nay, that epic of mine which begins from foundations the Bible is built on— “Of man's first disobedience”—I've heard it attributed, dammy, to Milton. Well, it's lucky for them that it's not worth my while, as I may say, to break spears With the hirelings, forsooth, of the press who assert that Othello was Shakespeare's. When he that can run, sir, may read—if he borrows the book, or goes on tick— In my poems the bit that describes how the Hellespont joins the Propontic. There are men, I believe, who will tell you that Gray wrote the whole of The Bard— Or that I didn't write half the Elegy, Bill, in a Country Churchyard. When you know that my poem, The Poet, begins—“Ruin seize thee!” and ends With recapitulations of horrors the poet invokes on his friends. And I'll swear, if you look at the dirge on my relatives under the turf, you Will perceive it winds up with some lines on myself—and begins with the curfew. Now you'll grant it's more probable, Bill—as a man of the world, if you please— That all these should have prigged from myself than that I should have prigged from all these. I could cry when I think of it, friend, if such tears would comport with my dignity, That the author of Christabel ever should smart from such vulgar malignity. (You remember perhaps that was one of the first little things that I carolled After finishing Marmion, the Princess, the Song of the Shirt, and Childe Harold.) Oh, doubtless it always has been so—Ah, doubtless it always will be— There are men who would say that myself is a different person from me. Better the porridge of patience a poor man snuffs in his plate Than the water of poisonous laurels distilled by the fingers of hate. 'Tis a dark-purple sort of a moonlighted kind of a midnight, I know; You remember those verses I wrote on Irene, from Edgar A. Poe? It was Lady Aholibah Levison, daughter of old Lord St. Giles, Who inspired those delectable strains, and rewarded her bard with her smiles. There are tasters who've sipped of Castalia, who don't look on my brew as the brew: There are fools who can't think why the names of my heroines of title should always be Hebrew. 'Twas my comrade, Sir Alister Knox, said, “Noo, dinna ye fash wi' Apollo, mon; Gang to Jewry for wives and for concubines, lad—look at David and Solomon. And it gives an erotico-scriptural twang,” said that high-born young man, “—tickles The lug” (he meant ear) “of the reader—to throw in a touch of the Canticles.” So I versified half of The Preacher—it took me a week, working slowly. Bah! You don't half know the sex, Bill—they like it. And what if her name was Aholibah? I recited her charms, in conjunction with those of a girl at the café, In a poem I published in collaboration with Templeton (Taffy). There are prudes in a world full of envy—and some of them thought it too strong To compare an earl's daughter by name with a girl at a French restaurant. I regarded her, though, with the chivalrous eyes of a knight-errant on quest; I may say I don't know that I ever felt prouder, old friend, of a conquest. And when I've been made happy, I never have cared a brass farthing who knew it; I Thank my stars I'm as free from mock-modesty, friend, as from vulgar fatuity. I can't say if my spirit retains—for the subject appears to me misty—any tie To such associations as Poesy weaves round the records of Christianity. There are bards—I may be one myself—who delight in their skill to unlock a lip's Rosy secrets by kisses and whispers of texts from the charming Apocalypse. It was thus that I won, by such biblical pills of poetical manna, From two elders—Sir Seth and Lord Isaac—the liking of Lady Susanna. But I left her—a woman to me is no more than a match, sir, at tennis is— When I heard she'd gone off with my valet, and burnt my rhymed version of Genesis. You may see by my shortness of speech that my time's almost up: I perceive That my new-fangled brevity strikes you: but don't—though the public will—grieve. As it's sometimes my whim to be vulgar, it's sometimes my whim to be brief; As when once I observed, after Heine, that “she was a harlot, and I” (which is true) “was a thief.” (Though you hardly should cite this particular line, by the way, as an instance of absolute brevity: I'm aware, man, of that; so you needn't disgrace yourself, sir, by such grossly mistimed and impertinent levity.) I don't like to break off, any more than you wish me to stop: but my fate is Not to vent half a million such rhymes without blockheads exclaiming— Jam Satis. Specimen from the speaker's original poems. Come into the orchard, Anne, For the dark owl, Night, has fled, And Phosphor slumbers, as well as he can With a daffodil sky for a bed: And the musk of the roses perplexes a man, And the pimpernel muddles his head. SONNET FOR A PICTURE That nose is out of drawing. With a gasp, She pants upon the passionate lips that ache With the red drain of her own mouth, and make A monochord of colour. Like an asp, One lithe lock wriggles in his rutilant grasp. Her bosom is an oven of myrrh, to bake Love's white warm shewbread to a browner cake. The lock his fingers clench has burst its hasp. The legs are absolutely abominable. Ah! what keen overgust of wild-eyed woes Flags in that bosom, flushes in that nose? Nay! Death sets riddles for desire to spell, Responsive. What red hem earth's passion sews, But may be ravenously unripped in hell? NEPHELIDIA From the depth of the dreamy decline of the dawn through a notable nimbus of nebulous noonshine, Pallid and pink as the palm of the flag-flower that flickers with fear of the flies as they float, Are they looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from a marvel of mystic miraculous moonshine, These that we feel in the blood of our blushes that thicken and threaten with throbs through the throat? Thicken and thrill as a theatre thronged at appeal of an actor's appalled agitation, Fainter with fear of the fires of the future than pale with the promise of pride in the past; Flushed with the famishing fullness of fever that reddens with radiance of rathe recreation, Gaunt as the ghastliest of glimpses that gleam through the gloom of the gloaming when ghosts go aghast? Nay, for the nick of the tick of the time is a tremulous touch on the temples of terror, Strained as the sinews yet strenuous with strife of the dead who is dumb as the dust-heaps of death: Surely no soul is it, sweet as the spasm of erotic emotional exquisite error, Bathed in the balms of beatified bliss, beatific itself by beatitude's breath. Surely no spirit or sense of a soul that was soft to the spirit and soul of our senses Sweetens the stress of suspiring suspicion that sobs in the semblance and sound of a sigh; Only this oracle opens Olympian, in mystical moods and triangular tenses— “Life is the lust of a lamp for the light that is dark till the dawn of the day when we die.” Mild is the mirk and monotonous music of memory, melodiously mute as it may be, While the hope in the heart of a hero is bruised by the breach of men's rapiers, resigned to the rod; Made meek as a mother whose bosom-beats bound with the bliss-bringing bulk of a balm-breathing baby, As they grope through the grave-yard of creeds, under skies growing green at a groan for the grimness of God. Blank is the book of his bounty beholden of old, and its binding is blacker than bluer: Out of blue into black is the scheme of the skies, and their dews are the wine of the bloodshed of things; Till the darkling desire of delight shall be free as a fawn that is freed from the fangs that pursue her, Till the heart-beats of hell shall be hushed by a hymn from the hunt that has harried the kennel of kings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME VI A MIDSUMMER HOLIDAY. ASTROPHEL. A CHANNEL PASSAGE. AND OTHER POEMS A MIDSUMMER HOLIDAY To Theodore Watts I THE SEABOARD The sea is at ebb, and the sound of her utmost word Is soft as the least wave's lapse in a still small reach. From bay into bay, on quest of a goal deferred, From headland ever to headland and breach to breach Where earth gives ear to the message that all days preach With changes of gladness and sadness that cheer and chide, The lone way lures me along by a chance untried That haply, if hope dissolve not and faith be whole, Not all for nought shall I seek, with a dream for guide, The goal that is not, and ever again the goal. The trackless ways are untravelled of sail or bird; The hoar wave hardly recedes from the soundless beach. The silence of instant noon goes nigh to be heard, The viewless void to be visible: all and each, A closure of calm no clamour of storm can breach Concludes and confines and absorbs them on either side, All forces of light and of life and the live world's pride. Sands hardly ruffled of ripples that hardly roll Seem ever to show as in reach of a swift brief stride The goal that is not, and ever again the goal. The waves are a joy to the seamew, the meads to the herd, And a joy to the heart is a goal that it may not reach. No sense that for ever the limits of sense engird, No hearing or sight that is vassal to form or speech, Learns ever the secret that shadow and silence teach, Hears ever the notes that or ever they swell subside, Sees ever the light that lights not the loud world's tide, Clasps ever the cause of the lifelong scheme's control Wherethrough we pursue, till the waters of life be dried, The goal that is not, and ever again the goal. Friend, what have we sought or seek we, whate'er betide, Though the seaboard shift its mark from afar descried, But aims whence ever anew shall arise the soul? Love, thought, song, life, but show for a glimpse and hide The goal that is not, and ever again the goal. II A HAVEN East and north a waste of waters, south and west Lonelier lands than dreams in sleep would feign to be, When the soul goes forth on travel, and is prest Round and compassed in with clouds that flash and flee. Dells without a streamlet, downs without a tree, Cirques of hollow cliff that crumble, give, their guest Little hope, till hard at hand he pause, to see Where the small town smiles, a warm still sea-side nest. Many a lone long mile, by many a headland's crest, Down by many a garden dear to bird and bee, Up by many a sea-down's bare and breezy breast, Winds the sandy strait of road where flowers run free. Here along the deep steep lanes by field and lea Knights have carolled, pilgrims chanted, on their quest, Haply, ere a roof rose toward the bleak strand's lee, Where the small town smiles, a warm still sea-side nest. Are the wild lands cursed perchance of time, or blest, Sad with fear or glad with comfort of the sea? Are the ruinous towers of churches fallen on rest Watched of wanderers woful now, glad once as we, When the night has all men's eyes and hearts in fee, When the soul bows down dethroned and dispossest? Yet must peace keep guard, by day's and night's decree, Where the small town smiles, a warm still sea-side nest. Friend, the lonely land is bright for you and me All its wild ways through: but this methinks is best, Here to watch how kindly time and change agree Where the small town smiles, a warm still sea-side nest. III ON A COUNTRY ROAD Along these low pleached lanes, on such a day, So soft a day as this, through shade and sun, With glad grave eyes that scanned the glad wild way, And heart still hovering o'er a song begun, And smile that warmed the world with benison, Our father, lord long since of lordly rhyme, Long since hath haply ridden, when the lime Bloomed broad above him, flowering where he came. Because thy passage once made warm this clime, Our father Chaucer, here we praise thy name. Each year that England clothes herself with May, She takes thy likeness on her. Time hath spun Fresh raiment all in vain and strange array For earth and man's new spirit, fain to shun Things past for dreams of better to be won, Through many a century since thy funeral chime Rang, and men deemed it death's most direful crime To have spared not thee for very love or shame; And yet, while mists round last year's memories climb, Our father Chaucer, here we praise thy name. Each turn of the old wild road whereon we stray, Meseems, might bring us face to face with one Whom seeing we could not but give thanks, and pray For England's love our father and her son To speak with us as once in days long done With all men, sage and churl and monk and mime, Who knew not as we know the soul sublime That sang for song's love more than lust of fame. Yet, though this be not, yet, in happy time, Our father Chaucer, here we praise thy name. Friend, even as bees about the flowering thyme, Years crowd on years, till hoar decay begrime Names once beloved; but, seeing the sun the same, As birds of autumn fain to praise the prime, Our father Chaucer, here we praise thy name. IV THE MILL GARDEN Stately stand the sunflowers, glowing down the garden-side, Ranged in royal rank arow along the warm grey wall, Whence their deep disks burn at rich midnoon afire with pride, Even as though their beams indeed were sunbeams, and the tall Sceptral stems bore stars whose reign endures, not flowers that fall. Lowlier laughs and basks the kindlier flower of homelier fame, Held by love the sweeter that it blooms in Shakespeare's name, Fragrant yet as though his hand had touched and made it thrill, Like the whole world's heart, with warm new life and gladdening flame. Fair befall the fair green close that lies below the mill! Softlier here the flower-soft feet of refluent seasons glide, Lightlier breathes the long low note of change's gentler call. Wind and storm and landslip feed the lone sea's gulf outside, Half a seamew's first flight hence; but scarce may these appal Peace, whose perfect seal is set for signet here on all. Steep and deep and sterile, under fields no plough can tame, Dip the cliffs full-fledged with poppies red as love or shame, Wide wan daisies bleak and bold, or herbage harsh and chill; Here the full clove pinks and wallflowers crown the love they claim. Fair befall the fair green close that lies below the mill! All the place breathes low, but not for fear lest ill betide, Soft as roses answering roses, or a dove's recall. Little heeds it how the seaward banks may stoop and slide, How the winds and years may hold all outer things in thrall, How their wrath may work on hoar church tower and boundary wall. Far and wide the waste and ravin of their rule proclaim Change alone the changeless lord of things, alone the same: Here a flower is stronger than the winds that work their will, Or the years that wing their way through darkness toward their aim. Fair befall the fair green close that lies below the mill! Friend, the home that smiled us welcome hither when we came, When we pass again with summer, surely should reclaim Somewhat given of heart's thanksgiving more than words fulfil— More than song, were song more sweet than all but love, might frame. Fair befall the fair green close that lies below the mill! V A SEA-MARK Rains have left the sea-banks ill to climb: Waveward sinks the loosening seaboard's floor: Half the sliding cliffs are mire and slime. Earth, a fruit rain-rotted to the core, Drops dissolving down in flakes, that pour Dense as gouts from eaves grown foul with grime. One sole rock which years that scathe not score Stands a sea-mark in the tides of time. Time were even as even the rainiest clime, Life were even as even this lapsing shore, Might not aught outlive their trustless prime: Vainly fear would wail or hope implore, Vainly grief revile or love adore Seasons clothed in sunshine, rain, or rime. Now for me one comfort held in store Stands a sea-mark in the tides of time. Once, by fate's default or chance's crime, Each apart, our burdens each we bore; Heard, in monotones like bells that chime, Chime the sounds of sorrows, float and soar Joy's full carols, near or far before; Heard not yet across the alternate rhyme Time's tongue tell what sign set fast of yore Stands a sea-mark in the tides of time. Friend, the sign we knew not heretofore Towers in sight here present and sublime. Faith in faith established evermore Stands a sea-mark in the tides of time. VI THE CLIFFSIDE PATH Seaward goes the sun, and homeward by the down We, before the night upon his grave be sealed. Low behind us lies the bright steep murmuring town, High before us heaves the steep rough silent field. Breach by ghastlier breach, the cliffs collapsing yield: Half the path is broken, half the banks divide; Flawed and crumbled, riven and rent, they cleave and slide Toward the ridged and wrinkled waste of girdling sand Deep beneath, whose furrows tell how far and wide Wind is lord and change is sovereign of the strand. Star by star on the unsunned waters twiring down. Golden spear-points glance against a silver shield. Over banks and bents, across the headland's crown, As by pulse of gradual plumes through twilight wheeled, Soft as sleep, the waking wind awakes the weald. Moor and copse and fallow, near or far descried, Feel the mild wings move, and gladden where they glide: Silence, uttering love that all things understand, Bids the quiet fields forget that hard beside Wind is lord and change is sovereign of the strand. Yet may sight, ere all the hoar soft shade grow brown, Hardly reckon half the rifts and rents unhealed Where the scarred cliffs downward sundering drive and drown, Hewn as if with stroke of swords in tempest steeled, Wielded as the night's will and the wind's may wield. Crowned and zoned in vain with flowers of autumntide, Soon the blasts shall break them, soon the waters hide; Soon, where late we stood, shall no man ever stand. Life and love seek harbourage on the landward side: Wind is lord and change is sovereign of the strand. Friend, though man be less than these, for all his pride, Yet, for all his weakness, shall not hope abide? Wind and change can wreck but life and waste but land: Truth and trust are sure, though here till all subside Wind is lord and change is sovereign of the strand. VII IN THE WATER The sea is awake, and the sound of the song of the joy of her waking is rolled From afar to the star that recedes, from anear to the wastes of the wild wide shore. Her call is a trumpet compelling us homeward: if dawn in her east be acold, From the sea shall we crave not her grace to rekindle the life that it kindled before, Her breath to requicken, her bosom to rock us, her kisses to bless as of yore? For the wind, with his wings half open, at pause in the sky, neither fettered nor free, Leans waveward and flutters the ripple to laughter: and fain would the twain of us be Where lightly the wave yearns forward from under the curve of the deep dawn's dome, And, full of the morning and fired with the pride of the glory thereof and the glee, Strike out from the shore as the heart in us bids and beseeches, athirst for the foam. Life holds not an hour that is better to live in: the past is a tale that is told, The future a sun-flecked shadow, alive and asleep, with a blessing in store. As we give us again to the waters, the rapture of limbs that the waters enfold Is less than the rapture of spirit whereby, though the burden it quits were sore, Our souls and the bodies they wield at their will are absorbed in the life they adore— In the life that endures no burden, and bows not the forehead, and bends not the knee— In the life everlasting of earth and of heaven, in the laws that atone and agree, In the measureless music of things, in the fervour of forces that rest or that roam, That cross and return and reissue, as I after you and as you after me Strike out from the shore as the heart in us bids and beseeches, athirst for the foam. For, albeit he were less than the least of them, haply the heart of a man may be bold To rejoice in the word of the sea as a mother's that saith to the son she bore, Child, was not the life in thee mine, and my spirit the breath in thy lips from of old? Have I let not thy weakness exult in my strength, and thy foolishness learn of my lore? Have I helped not or healed not thine anguish, or made not the might of thy gladness more? And surely his heart should answer, The light of the love of my life is in thee. She is fairer than earth, and the sun is not fairer, the wind is not blither than she: From my youth hath she shown me the joy of her bays that I crossed, of her cliffs that I clomb, Till now that the twain of us here, in desire of the dawn and in trust of the sea, Strike out from the shore as the heart in us bids and beseeches, athirst for the foam. Friend, earth is a harbour of refuge for winter, a covert whereunder to flee When day is the vassal of night, and the strength of the hosts of her mightier than he; But here is the presence adored of me, here my desire is at rest and at home. There are cliffs to be climbed upon land, there are ways to be trodden and ridden: but we Strike out from the shore as the heart in us bids and beseeches, athirst for the foam. VIII THE SUNBOWS Spray of song that springs in April, light of love that laughs through May, Live and die and live for ever: nought of all things far less fair Keeps a surer life than these that seem to pass like fire away. In the souls they live which are but all the brighter that they were; In the hearts that kindle, thinking what delight of old was there. Wind that shapes and lifts and shifts them bids perpetual memory play Over dreams and in and out of deeds and thoughts which seem to wear Light that leaps and runs and revels through the springing flames of spray. Dawn is wild upon the waters where we drink of dawn to-day: Wide, from wave to wave rekindling in rebound through radiant air, Flash the fires unwoven and woven again of wind that works in play, Working wonders more than heart may note or sight may wellnigh dare, Wefts of rarer light than colours rain from heaven, though this be rare. Arch on arch unbuilt in building, reared and ruined ray by ray, Breaks and brightens, laughs and lessens, even till eyes may hardly bear Light that leaps and runs and revels through the springing flames of spray. Year on year sheds light and music rolled and flashed from bay to bay Round the summer capes of time and winter headlands keen and bare Whence the soul keeps watch, and bids her vassal memory watch and pray, If perchance the dawn may quicken, or perchance the midnight spare. Silence quells not music, darkness takes not sunlight in her snare; Shall not joys endure that perish? Yea, saith dawn, though night say nay: Life on life goes out, but very life enkindles everywhere Light that leaps and runs and revels through the springing flames of spray. Friend, were life no more than this is, well would yet the living fare. All aflower and all afire and all flung heavenward, who shall say Such a flash of life were worthless? This is worth a world of care— Light that leaps and runs and revels through the springing flames of spray. IX ON THE VERGE Here begins the sea that ends not till the world's end. Where we stand, Could we know the next high sea-mark set beyond these waves that gleam, We should know what never man hath known, nor eye of man hath scanned. Nought beyond these coiling clouds that melt like fume of shrines that steam Breaks or stays the strength of waters till they pass our bounds of dream. Where the waste Land's End leans westward, all the seas it watches roll Find their border fixed beyond them, and a worldwide shore's control: These whereby we stand no shore beyond us limits: these are free. Gazing hence, we see the water that grows iron round the Pole, From the shore that hath no shore beyond it set in all the sea. Sail on sail along the sea-line fades and flashes; here on land Flash and fade the wheeling wings on wings of mews that plunge and scream. Hour on hour along the line of life and time's evasive strand Shines and darkens, wanes and waxes, slays and dies: and scarce they seem More than motes that thronged and trembled in the brief noon's breath and beam. Some with crying and wailing, some with notes like sound of bells that toll, Some with sighing and laughing, some with words that blessed and made us whole, Passed, and left us, and we know not what they were, nor what were we. Would we know, being mortal? Never breath of answering whisper stole From the shore that hath no shore beyond it set in all the sea. Shadows, would we question darkness? Ere our eyes and brows be fanned Round with airs of twilight, washed with dews from sleep's eternal stream, Would we know sleep's guarded secret? Ere the fire consume the brand, Would it know if yet its ashes may requicken? yet we deem Surely man may know, or ever night unyoke her starry team, What the dawn shall be, or if the dawn shall be not: yea, the scroll Would we read of sleep's dark scripture, pledge of peace or doom of dole. Ah, but here man's heart leaps, yearning toward the gloom with venturous glee, Though his pilot eye behold nor bay nor harbour, rock nor shoal, From the shore that hath no shore beyond it set in all the sea. Friend, who knows if death indeed have life or life have death for goal? Day nor night can tell us, nor may seas declare nor skies unroll What has been from everlasting, or if aught shall alway be. Silence answering only strikes response reverberate on the soul From the shore that hath no shore beyond it set in all the sea. A NEW-YEAR ODE To Victor Hugo I Twice twelve times have the springs of years refilled Their fountains from the river-head of time Since by the green sea's marge, ere autumn chilled Waters and woods with sense of changing clime, A great light rose upon my soul, and thrilled My spirit of sense with sense of spheres in chime, Sound as of song wherewith a God would build Towers that no force of conquering war might climb. Wind shook the glimmering sea Even as my soul in me Was stirred with breath of mastery more sublime, Uplift and borne along More thunderous tides of song, Where wave rang back to wave more rapturous rhyme And world on world flashed lordlier light Than ever lit the wandering ways of ships by night. II The spirit of God, whose breath of life is song, Moved, though his word was human, on the face Of those deep waters of the soul, too long Dumb, dark, and cold, that waited for the grace Wherewith day kindles heaven: and as some throng Of quiring wings fills full some lone chill place With sudden rush of life and joy, more strong Than death or sorrow or all night's darkling race, So was my heart, that heard All heaven in each deep word, Filled full with light of thought, and waxed apace Itself more wide and deep, To take that gift and keep And cherish while my days fulfilled their space A record wide as earth and sea, The Legend writ of Ages past and yet to be. III As high the chant of Paradise and Hell Rose, when the soul of Milton gave it wings; As wide the sweep of Shakespeare's empire fell, When life had bared for him her secret springs; But not his various soul might range and dwell Amid the mysteries of the founts of things; Nor Milton's range of rule so far might swell Across the kingdoms of forgotten kings. Men, centuries, nations, time, Life, death, love, trust, and crime, Rang record through the change of smitten strings That felt an exile's hand Sound hope for every land More loud than storm's cloud-sundering trumpet rings, And bid strong death for judgment rise, And life bow down for judgment of his awless eyes IV And death, soul-stricken in his strength, resigned The keeping of the sepulchres to song; And life was humbled, and his height of mind Brought lower than lies a grave-stone fallen along; And like a ghost and like a God mankind Rose clad with light and darkness; weak and strong, Clean and unclean, with eyes afire and blind, Wounded and whole, fast bound with cord and thong, Free; fair and foul, sin-stained, And sinless; crowned and chained; Fleet-limbed, and halting all his lifetime long; Glad of deep shame, and sad For shame's sake; wise, and mad; Girt round with love and hate of right and wrong; Armed and disarmed for sleep and strife; Proud, and sore fear made havoc of his pride of life. V Shadows and shapes of fable and storied sooth Rose glorious as with gleam of gold unpriced; Eve, clothed with heavenly nakedness and youth La Légende des Siècles: Le Sacre de la Femme. That matched the morning's; Cain, self-sacrificed La Conscience. On crime's first altar: legends wise as truth, And truth in legends deep embalmed and spiced; The stars that saw the starlike eyes of Ruth, Booz endormi. The grave that heard the clarion call of Christ. Première rencontre du Christ avec le tombeau. And higher than sorrow and mirth La Terre: Hymne. The heavenly song of earth Sprang, in such notes as might have well sufficed To still the storms of time And sin's contentious clime With peace renewed of life reparadised: Earth, scarred not yet with temporal scars; Goddess of gods, our mother, chosen among the stars. VI Earth fair as heaven, ere change and time set odds Between them, light and darkness know not when, And fear, grown strong through panic periods, Les Temps Paniques. Crouched, a crowned worm, in faith's Lernean fen, And love lay bound, and hope was scourged with rods, And death cried out from desert and from den, Seeing all the heaven above him dark with gods And all the world about him marred of men. Cities that nought might purge La Ville Disparue. Save the sea's whelming surge From all the pent pollutions in their pen Deep death drank down, and wrought, With wreck of all things, nought, That none might live of all their names again, Nor aught of all whose life is breath Serve any God whose likeness was not like to death. VII Les Trois Cents. Till by the lips and eyes of one live nation The blind mute world found grace to see and speak, And light watched rise a more divine creation At that more godlike utterance of the Greek, Let there be freedom. Kings whose orient station Made pale the morn, and all her presage bleak, Girt each with strengths of all his generation, Dim tribes of shamefaced soul and sun-swart cheek, Twice, urged with one desire, Son following hard on sire, With all the wrath of all a world to wreak, And all the rage of night Afire against the light Whose weakness makes her strong-winged empire weak, Stood up to unsay that saying, and fell Too far for song, though song were thousand-tongued, to tell. VIII From those deep echoes of the loud Ægean Le Détroit de l'Euripe: La Chanson de Sophocle à Salamine. That rolled response whereat false fear was chid By songs of joy sublime and Sophoclean, Fresh notes reverberate westward rose to bid All wearier times take comfort from the pæan That tells the night what deeds the sunrise did, Even till the lawns and torrents Pyrenean Le Romancero du Cid. Ring answer from the records of the Cid. But never force of fountains From sunniest hearts of mountains Wherein the soul of hidden June was hid Poured forth so pure and strong Springs of reiterate song, Loud as the streams his fame was reared amid, More sweet than flowers they feed, and fair With grace of lordlier sunshine and more lambent air. IX A star more prosperous than the storm-clothed east's Clothed all the warm south-west with light like spring's, When hands of strong men spread the wolves their feasts Le Petit Roi de Galice. And from snake-spirited princes plucked the stings; Ere earth, grown all one den of hurtling beasts, Le Jour des Rois. Had for her sunshine and her watersprings The fire of hell that warmed the hearts of priests, The wells of blood that slaked the lips of kings. The shadow of night made stone Montfaucon. Stood populous and alone, Dense with its dead and loathed of living things That draw not life from death, And as with hell's own breath And clangour of immitigable wings Vexed the fair face of Paris, made Foul in its murderous imminence of sound and shade. X La vision d'où est sorti ce livre. And all these things were parcels of the vision That moved a cloud before his eyes, or stood A tower half shattered by the strong collision Of spirit and spirit, of evil gods with good; A ruinous wall rent through with grim division, Where time had marked his every monstrous mood Of scorn and strength and pride and self-derision: The Tower of Things, that felt upon it brood Night, and about it cast The storm of all the past Now mute and forceless as a fire subdued: Yet through the rifted years And centuries veiled with tears And ages as with very death imbrued Freedom, whence hope and faith grow strong, Smiles, and firm love sustains the indissoluble song. XI Above the cloudy coil of days deceased, Its might of flight, with mists and storms beset, Burns heavenward, as with heart and hope increased, For all the change of tempests, all the fret Of frost or fire, keen fraud or force released, Wherewith the world once wasted knows not yet If evil or good lit all the darkling east From the ardent moon of sovereign Mahomet. Sublime in work and will L'an neuf de l'Hégire. The song sublimer still Salutes him, ere the splendour shrink and set; Then with imperious eye Les sept merveilles du monde. And wing that sounds the sky Soars and sees risen as ghosts in concourse met The old world's seven elder wonders, firm As dust and fixed as shadows, weaker than the worm. XII High witness borne of knights high-souled and hoary Les quatre jours d'Elciis. Before death's face and empire's rings and glows Even from the dust their life poured forth left gory, As the eagle's cry rings after from the snows Le Régiment du baron Madruce. Supreme rebuke of shame clothed round with glory And hosts whose track the false crowned eagle shows; More loud than sounds through stormiest song and story La Chanson des Aventuriers de la Mer. The laugh of slayers whose names the sea-wind knows; More loud than peals on land Les Reîtres. In many a red wet hand The clash of gold and cymbals as they close; Loud as the blast that meets La Rose de l'Infante. The might of marshalled fleets And sheds it into shipwreck, like a rose Blown from a child's light grasp in sign That earth's high lords are lords not over breeze and brine. XIII Above the dust and mire of man's dejection Le Satyre. The wide-winged spirit of song resurgent sees His wingless and long-labouring resurrection Up the arduous heaven, by sore and strange degrees, Mount, and with splendour of the soul's reflection Strike heaven's dark sovereign down upon his knees, Pale in the light of orient insurrection, And dumb before the almightier lord's decrees Who bade him be of yore, Who bids him be no more: And all earth's heart is quickened as the sea's, Even as when sunrise burns Les paysans au bord de la mer. The very sea's heart yearns That heard not on the midnight-walking breeze The wail that woke with evensong From hearts of poor folk watching all the darkness long. XIV Dawn and the beams of sunbright song illume Les pauvres gens. Love, with strange children at her piteous breast, By grace of weakness from the grave-mouthed gloom Plucked, and by mercy lulled to living rest, Soft as the nursling's nigh the grandsire's tomb Petit Paul. That fell on sleep, a bird of rifled nest; Soft as the lips whose smile unsaid the doom Guerre Civile. That gave their sire to violent death's arrest. Even for such love's sake strong, La Vision de Dante. Wrath fires the inveterate song That bids hell gape for one whose bland mouth blest All slayers and liars that sighed Prayer as they slew and lied Till blood had clothed his priesthood as a vest, And hears, though darkness yet be dumb, La Trompette du Jugement. The silence of the trumpet of the wrath to come. XV Torquemada (1882). Nor lacked these lights of constellated age A star among them fed with life more dire, Lit with his bloodred fame, whose withering rage Made earth for heaven's sake one funereal pyre And life in faith's name one appointed stage For death to purge the souls of men with fire. Heaven, earth, and hell on one thrice tragic page Mixed all their light and darkness: one man's lyre Gave all their echoes voice; Bade rose-cheeked love rejoice, And cold-lipped craft with ravenous fear conspire, And fire-eyed faith smite hope Dead, seeing enthroned as Pope And crowned of heaven on earth at hell's desire Sin, called by death's incestuous name Borgia: the world that heard it flushed and quailed with shame. XVI La Légende des Siècles: tome cinquième et dernier (1883). Another year, and hope triumphant heard The consummating sound of song that spake Conclusion to the multitudinous word Whose expectation held her spirit awake Till full delight for twice twelve years deferred Bade all souls entering eat and drink, and take A third time comfort given them, that the third Might heap the measure up of twain, and make The sinking year sublime Among all sons of time And fair in all men's memories for his sake. Each thought of ours became Fire, kindling from his flame, And music widening in his wide song's wake. Yea, and the world bore witness here How great a light was risen upon this darkening year. XVII November 25, 1883. It was the dawn of winter: sword in sheath, Change, veiled and mild, came down the gradual air With cold slow smiles that hid the doom beneath. Five days to die in yet were autumn's, ere The last leaf withered from his flowerless wreath. South, east, and north, our skies were all blown bare, But westward over glimmering holt and heath Cloud, wind, and light had made a heaven more fair Than ever dream or truth Showed earth in time's keen youth When men with angels communed unaware. Above the sun's head, now Veiled even to the ardent brow, Rose two sheer wings of sundering cloud, that were As a bird's poised for vehement flight, Full-fledged with plumes of tawny fire and hoar grey light. XVIII As midnight black, as twilight brown, they spread, But feathered thick with flame that streaked and lined Their living darkness, ominous else of dread, From south to northmost verge of heaven inclined Most like some giant angel's, whose bent head Bowed earthward, as with message for mankind Of doom or benediction to be shed From passage of his presence. Far behind, Even while they seemed to close, Stoop, and take flight, arose Above them, higher than heavenliest thought may find In light or night supreme Of vision or of dream, Immeasurable of men's eyes or mounting mind, Heaven, manifest in manifold Light of pure pallid amber, cheered with fire of gold. XIX And where the fine gold faded all the sky Shone green as the outer sea when April glows, Inlaid with flakes and feathers fledged to fly Of clouds suspense in rapture and repose, With large live petals, broad as love bids lie Full open when the sun salutes the rose, And small rent sprays wherewith the heavens most high Were strewn as autumn strews the garden-close With ruinous roseleaves whirled About their wan chill world, Through wind-worn bowers that now no music knows, Spoil of the dim dusk year Whose utter night is near, And near the flower of dawn beyond it blows; Till east and west were fire and light, As though the dawn to come had flushed the coming night. XX The highways paced of men that toil or play, The byways known of none but lonely feet, Were paven of purple woven of night and day With hands that met as hands of friends might meet— As though night's were not lifted up to slay And day's had waxed not weaker. Peace more sweet Than music, light more soft than shadow, lay On downs and moorlands wan with day's defeat, That watched afar above Life's very rose of love Let all its lustrous leaves fall, fade, and fleet, And fill all heaven and earth Full as with fires of birth Whence time should feed his years with light and heat: Nay, not life's, but a flower more strong Than life or time or death, love's very rose of song. XXI Song visible, whence all men's eyes were lit With love and loving wonder: song that glowed Through cloud and change on souls that knew not it And hearts that wist not whence their comfort flowed, Whence fear was lightened of her fever-fit, Whence anguish of her life-compelling load. Yea, no man's head whereon the fire alit, Of all that passed along that sunset road Westward, no brow so drear, No eye so dull of cheer, No face so mean whereon that light abode, But as with alien pride Strange godhead glorified Each feature flushed from heaven with fire that showed The likeness of its own life wrought By strong transfiguration as of living thought. XXII Nor only clouds of the everlasting sky, Nor only men that paced that sunward way To the utter bourne of evening, passed not by Unblest or unillumined: none might say, Of all things visible in the wide world's eye, That all too low for all that grace it lay: The lowliest lakelets of the moorland nigh, The narrowest pools where shallowest wavelets play, Were filled from heaven above With light like fire of love, With flames and colours like a dawn in May, As hearts that lowlier live With light of thoughts that give Light from the depth of souls more deep than they Through song's or story's kindling scroll, The splendour of the shadow that reveals the soul. XXIII For, when such light is in the world, we share, All of us, all the rays thereof that shine: Its presence is alive in the unseen air, Its fire within our veins as quickening wine; A spirit is shed on all men everywhere, Known or not known of all men for divine. Yea, as the sun makes heaven, that light makes fair All souls of ours, all lesser souls than thine, Priest, prophet, seer and sage, Lord of a subject age That bears thy seal upon it for a sign; Whose name shall be thy name, Whose light thy light of fame, The light of love that makes thy soul a shrine Whose record through all years to be Shall bear this witness written—that its womb bare thee. XXIV O mystery, whence to one man's hand was given Power upon all things of the spirit, and might Whereby the veil of all the years was riven And naked stood the secret soul of night! O marvel, hailed of eyes whence cloud is driven, That shows at last wrong reconciled with right By death divine of evil and sin forgiven! O light of song, whose fire is perfect light! No speech, no voice, no thought, No love, avails us aught For service of thanksgiving in his sight Who hath given us all for ever Such gifts that man gave never So many and great since first Time's wings took flight. Man may not praise a spirit above Man's: life and death shall praise him: we can only love. XXV Life, everlasting while the worlds endure, Death, self-abased before a power more high, Shall bear one witness, and their word stand sure, That not till time be dead shall this man die. Love, like a bird, comes loyal to his lure; Fame flies before him, wingless else to fly. A child's heart toward his kind is not more pure, An eagle's toward the sun no lordlier eye. Awe sweet as love and proud As fame, though hushed and bowed, Yearns toward him silent as his face goes by: All crowns before his crown Triumphantly bow down, For pride that one more great than all draws nigh All souls applaud, all hearts acclaim, One heart benign, one soul supreme, one conquering name. LINES ON THE MONUMENT OF GIUSEPPE MAZZINI. Italia, mother of the souls of men, Mother divine, Of all that served thee best with sword or pen, All sons of thine, Thou knowest that here the likeness of the best Before thee stands; The head most high, the heart found faithfullest, The purest hands. Above the fume and foam of time that flits, The soul, we know, Now sits on high where Alighieri sits With Angelo. Not his own heavenly tongue hath heavenly speech Enough to say What this man was, whose praise no thought may reach, No words can weigh. Since man's first mother brought to mortal birth Her first-born son, Such grace befell not ever man on earth As crowns this one. Of God nor man was ever this thing said, That he could give Life back to her who gave him, whence his dead Mother might live. But this man found his mother dead and slain, With fast sealed eyes, And bade the dead rise up and live again, And she did rise. And all the world was bright with her through him: But dark with strife, Like heaven's own sun that storming clouds bedim, Was all his life. Life and the clouds are vanished: hate and fear Have had their span Of time to hurt, and are not: he is here, The sunlike man. City superb that hadst Columbus first For sovereign son, Be prouder that thy breast hath later nurst This mightier one. Glory be his for ever, while his land Lives and is free, As with controlling breath and sovereign hand He bade her be. Earth shows to heaven the names by thousands told That crown her fame, But highest of all that heaven and earth behold Mazzini's name. LES CASQUETS. From the depths of the waters that lighten and darken With change everlasting of life and of death, Where hardly by noon if the lulled ear hearken It hears the sea's as a tired child's breath, Where hardly by night if an eye dare scan it The storm lets shipwreck be seen or heard, As the reefs to the waves and the foam to the granite Respond one merciless word, Sheer seen and far, in the sea's live heaven, A seamew's flight from the wild sweet land, White-plumed with foam if the wind wake, seven Black helms as of warriors that stir not stand. From the depths that abide and the waves that environ Seven rocks rear heads that the midnight masks; And the strokes of the swords of the storm are as iron On the steel of the wave-worn casques. Be night's dark word as the word of a wizard, Be the word of dawn as a god's glad word, Like heads of the spirits of darkness visored That see not for ever, nor ever have heard, These basnets, plumed as for fight or plumeless, Crowned of the storm and by storm discrowned, Keep ward of the lists where the dead lie tombless And the tale of them is not found. Nor eye may number nor hand may reckon The tithes that are taken of life by the dark, Or the ways of the path, if doom's hand beckon, For the soul to fare as a helmless bark— Fare forth on a way that no sign showeth, Nor aught of its goal or of aught between A path for her flight which no fowl knoweth, Which the vulture's eye hath not seen. Here still, though the wave and the wind seem lovers Lulled half asleep by their own soft words, A dream as of death in the sun's light hovers, And a sign in the motions and cries of the birds. Dark auguries and keen from the sweet sea-swallows Strike noon with a sense as of midnight's breath, And the wing that flees and the wing that follows Are as types of the wings of death. For here, when the night roars round, and under The white sea lightens and leaps like fire, Acclaimed of storm and applauded in thunder, Sits death on the throne of his crowned desire. Yea, hardly the hand of the god might fashion A seat more strong for his strength to take, For the might of his heart and the pride of his passion To rejoice in the wars they make. When the heart in him brightens with blitheness of battle And the depth of its thirst is fulfilled with strife, And his ear with the ravage of bolts that rattle, And the soul of death with the pride of life, Till the darkness is loud with his dark thanksgiving And wind and cloud are as chords of his hymn, There is nought save death in the deep night living, And the whole night worships him. Heaven's height bows down to him, signed with his token, And the sea's depth, moved as a heart that yearns, Heaves up to him, strong as a heart half broken, A heart that breaks in a prayer that burns. Of cloud is the shrine of his worship moulded, But the altar therein is of sea-shaped stone, Whereon, with the strength of his wide wings folded, Sits death in the dark, alone. He hears the word of his servant spoken, The word that the wind his servant saith; Storm writes on the front of the night his token, That the skies may seem to bow down to death. But the clouds that stoop and the storms that minister Serve but as thralls that fulfil their tasks; And his seal is not set save here on the sinister Crests reared of the crownless casques. Nor flame nor plume of the storm that crowned them Gilds or quickens their stark black strength. Life lightens and murmurs and laughs right round them, At peace with the noon's whole breadth and length, At one with the heart of the soft-souled heaven, At one with the life of the kind wild land: But its touch may unbrace not the strengths of the seven Casques hewn of the storm-wind's hand. No touch may loosen the black braced helmlets For the wild elves' heads of the wild waves wrought. As flowers on the sea are her small green realmlets, Like heavens made out of a child's heart's thought; But these as thorns of her desolate places, Strong fangs that fasten and hold lives fast: And the vizors are framed as for formless faces That a dark dream sees go past. Of fear and of fate are the frontlets fashioned, And the heads behind them are dire and dumb. When the heart of the darkness is scarce impassioned, Thrilled scarce with sense of the wrath to come, They bear the sign from of old engraven, Though peace be round them and strife seem far, That here is none but the night-wind's haven, With death for the harbour bar. Of the iron of doom are the casquets carven, That never the rivets thereof should burst. When the heart of the darkness is hunger-starven, And the throats of the gulfs are agape for thirst, And stars are as flowers that the wind bids wither, And dawn is as hope struck dead by fear, The rage of the ravenous night sets hither, And the crown of her work is here. All shores about and afar lie lonely, But lonelier are these than the heart of grief, These loose-linked rivets of rock, whence only Strange life scarce gleams from the sheer main reef, With a blind wan face in the wild wan morning, With a live lit flame on its brows by night, That the lost may lose not its word's mute warning And the blind by its grace have sight. Here, walled in with the wide waste water, Grew the grace of a girl's lone life, The sea's and the sea-wind's foster-daughter, And peace was hers in the main mid strife. For her were the rocks clothed round with thunder, And the crests of them carved by the storm-smith's craft: For her was the mid storm rent in sunder As with passion that wailed and laughed. For her the sunrise kindled and scattered The red rose-leaflets of countless cloud: For her the blasts of the springtide shattered The strengths reluctant of waves back-bowed. For her would winds in the mid sky levy Bright wars that hardly the night bade cease: At noon, when sleep on the sea lies heavy, For her would the sun make peace. Peace rose crowned with the dawn on golden Lit leagues of triumph that flamed and smiled: Peace lay lulled in the moon-beholden Warm darkness making the world's heart mild For all the wide waves' troubles and treasons, One word only her soul's ear heard Speak from stormless and storm-rent seasons, And nought save peace was the word. All her life waxed large with the light of it, All her heart fed full on the sound: Spirit and sense were exalted in sight of it, Compassed and girdled and clothed with it round Sense was none but a strong still rapture, Spirit was none but a joy sublime, Of strength to curb and of craft to capture The craft and the strength of Time. Time lay bound as in painless prison There, closed in with a strait small space. Never thereon as a strange light risen Change had unveiled for her grief s far face. Three white walls flung out from the basement Girt the width of the world whereon Gazing at night from her flame-lit casement She saw where the dark sea shone. Hardly the breadth of a few brief paces, Hardly the length of a strong man's stride, The small court flower-lit with children's faces Scarce held scope for a bird to hide. Yet here was a man's brood reared and hidden Between the rocks and the towers and the foam, Where peril and pity and peace were bidden As guests to the same sure home. Here would pity keep watch for peril, And surety comfort his heart with peace. No flower save one, where the reefs lie sterile, Gave of the seed of its heart's increase. Pity and surety and peace most lowly Were the root and the stem and the bloom of the flower: And the light and the breath of the buds kept holy That maid's else blossomless bower. With never a leaf but the seaweed's tangle, Never a bird's but the seamew's note, It heard all round it the strong storms wrangle, Watched far past it the waste wrecks float. But her soul was stilled by the sky's endurance, And her heart made glad with the sea's content; And her faith waxed more in the sun's assurance For the winds that came and went. Sweetness was brought for her forth of the bitter Sea's strength, and light of the deep sea's dark, From where green lawns on Alderney glitter To the bastioned crags of the steeps of Sark. These she knew from afar beholden, And marvelled haply what life would be On moors that sunset and dawn leave golden, In dells that smile on the sea. And forth she fared as a stout-souled rover, For a brief blithe raid on the bounding brine: And light winds ferried her light bark over To the lone soft island of fair-limbed kine. But the league-long length of its wild green border, And the small bright streets of serene St. Anne, Perplexed her sense with a strange disorder At sight of the works of man. The world was here, and the world's confusion, And the dust of the wheels of revolving life, Pain, labour, change, and the fierce illusion Of strife more vain than the sea's old strife. And her heart within her was vexed, and dizzy The sense of her soul as a wheel that whirled: She might not endure for a space that busy Loud coil of the troublous world. Too full, she said, was the world of trouble, Too dense with noise of contentious things, And shows less bright than the blithe foam's bubble As home she fared on the smooth wind's wings. For joy grows loftier in air more lonely, Where only the sea's brood fain would be; Where only the heart may receive in it only The love of the heart of the sea. A BALLAD OF SARK. High beyond the granite portal arched across Like the gateway of some godlike giant's hold Sweep and swell the billowy breasts of moor and moss East and westward, and the dell their slopes enfold Basks in purple, glows in green, exults in gold. Glens that know the dove and fells that hear the lark Fill with joy the rapturous island, as an ark Full of spicery wrought from herb and flower and tree. None would dream that grief even here may disembark On the wrathful woful marge of earth and sea. Rocks emblazoned like the mid shield's royal boss Take the sun with all their blossom broad and bold. None would dream that all this moorland's glow and gloss Could be dark as tombs that strike the spirit acold Even in eyes that opened here, and here behold Now no sun relume from hope's belated spark Any comfort, nor may ears of mourners hark Though the ripe woods ring with golden-throated glee, While the soul lies shattered, like a stranded bark On the wrathful woful marge of earth and sea. Death and doom are they whose crested triumphs toss On the proud plumed waves whence mourning notes are tolled. Wail of perfect woe and moan for utter loss Raise the bride-song through the graveyard on the wold Where the bride-bed keeps the bridegroom fast in mould, Where the bride, with death for priest and doom for clerk, Hears for choir the throats of waves like wolves that bark, Sore anhungered, off the drear Eperquerie, Fain to spoil the strongholds of the strength of Sark On the wrathful woful marge of earth and sea. Prince of storm and tempest, lord whose ways are dark, Wind whose wings are spread for flight that none may mark, Lightly dies the joy that lives by grace of thee. Love through thee lies bleeding, hope lies cold and stark, On the wrathful woful marge of earth and sea. NINE YEARS OLD February 4, 1883 I Lord of light, whose shrine no hands destroy, God of song, whose hymn no tongue refuses, Now, though spring far hence be cold and coy, Bid the golden mouths of all the Muses Ring forth gold of strains without alloy, Till the ninefold rapture that suffuses Heaven with song bid earth exult for joy, Since the child whose head this dawn bedews is Sweet as once thy violet-cradled boy. II Even as he lay lapped about with flowers, Lies the life now nine years old before us Lapped about with love in all its hours; Hailed of many loves that chant in chorus Loud or low from lush or leafless bowers, Some from hearts exultant born sonorous, Some scarce louder-voiced than soft-tongued showers Two months hence, when spring's light wings poised o'er us High shall hover, and her heart be ours. III Even as he, though man-forsaken, smiled On the soft kind snakes divinely bidden There to feed him in the green mid wild Full with hurtless honey, till the hidden Birth should prosper, finding fate more mild, So full-fed with pleasures unforbidden, So by love's lures blamelessly beguiled, Laughs the nursling of our hearts unchidden Yet by change that mars not yet the child. IV Ah, not yet! Thou, lord of night and day, Time, sweet father of such blameless pleasure, Time, false friend who tak'st thy gifts away, Spare us yet some scantlings of the treasure, Leave us yet some rapture of delay, Yet some bliss of blind and fearless leisure Unprophetic of delight's decay, Yet some nights and days wherein to measure All the joys that bless us while they may. V Not the waste Arcadian woodland, wet Still with dawn and vocal with Alpheus, Reared a nursling worthier love's regret, Lord, than this, whose eyes beholden free us Straight from bonds the soul would fain forget, Fain cast off, that night and day might see us Clear once more of life's vain fume and fret: Leave us, then, whate'er thy doom decree us, Yet some days wherein to love him yet. VI Yet some days wherein the child is ours, Ours, not thine, O lord whose hand is o'er us Always, as the sky with suns and showers Dense and radiant, soundless or sonorous; Yet some days for love's sake, ere the bowers Fade wherein his fair first years kept chorus Night and day with Graces robed like hours, Ere this worshipped childhood wane before us, Change, and bring forth fruit—but no more flowers. VII Love we may the thing that is to be, Love we must: but how forego this olden Joy, this flower of childish love, that we Held more dear than aught of Time is holden— Time, whose laugh is like as Death's to see— Time, who heeds not aught of all beholden, Heard, or touched in passing—flower or tree, Tares or grain of leaden days or golden— More than wind has heed of ships at sea? VIII First the babe, a very rose of joy, Sweet as hope's first note of jubilation, Passes: then must growth and change destroy Next the child, and mar the consecration Hallowing yet, ere thought or sense annoy, Childhood's yet half heavenlike habitation, Bright as truth and frailer than a toy; Whence its guest with eager gratulation Springs, and life grows larger round the boy. IX Yet, ere sunrise wholly cease to shine, Ere change come to chide our hearts, and scatter Memories marked for love's sake with a sign, Let the light of dawn beholden flatter Yet some while our eyes that feed on thine, Child, with love that change nor time can shatter, Love, whose silent song says more than mine Now, though charged with elder loves and latter Here it hails a lord whose years are nine. AFTER A READING For the seven times seventh time love would renew the delight without end or alloy That it takes in the praise as it takes in the presence of eyes that fulfil it with joy; But how shall it praise them and rest unrebuked by the presence and pride of the boy? Praise meet for a child is unmeet for an elder whose winters and springs are nine: What song may have strength in its wings to expand them, or light in its eyes to shine, That shall seem not as weakness and darkness if matched with the theme I would fain make mine? The round little flower of a face that exults in the sunshine of shadowless days Defies the delight it enkindles to sing of it aught not unfit for the praise Of the sweetest of all things that eyes may rejoice in and tremble with love as they gaze. Such tricks and such meanings abound on the lips and the brows that are brighter than light, The demure little chin, the sedate little nose, and the forehead of sun-stained white, That love overflows into laughter and laughter subsides into love at the sight. Each limb and each feature has action in tune with the meaning that smiles as it speaks From the fervour of eyes and the fluttering of hands in a foretaste of fancies and freaks, When the thought of them deepens the dimples that laugh in the corners and curves of his cheeks. As a bird when the music within her is yet too intense to be spoken in song, That pauses a little for pleasure to feel how the notes from withinwards throng, So pauses the laugh at his lips for a little, and waxes within more strong. As the music elate and triumphal that bids all things of the dawn bear part With the tune that prevails when her passion has risen into rapture of passionate art, So lightens the laughter made perfect that leaps from its nest in the heaven of his heart. Deep, grave and sedate is the gaze of expectant intensity bent for awhile And absorbed on its aim as the tale that enthralls him uncovers the weft of its wile, Till the goal of attention is touched, and expectancy kisses delight in a smile. And it seems to us here that in Paradise hardly the spirit of Lamb or of Blake May hear or behold aught sweeter than lightens and rings when his bright thoughts break In laughter that well might lure them to look, and to smile as of old for his sake. O singers that best loved children, and best for their sakes are beloved of us here, In the world of your life everlasting, where love has no thorn and desire has no fear, All else may be sweeter than aught is on earth, nought dearer than these are dear. MAYTIME IN MIDWINTER A new year gleams on us, tearful And troubled and smiling dim As the smile on a lip still fearful, As glances of eyes that swim: But the bird of my heart makes cheerful The days that are bright for him. Child, how may a man's love merit The grace you shed as you stand, The gift that is yours to inherit? Through you are the bleak days bland; Your voice is a light to my spirit; You bring the sun in your hand. The year's wing shows not a feather As yet of the plumes to be; Yet here in the shrill grey weather The spring's self stands at my knee, And laughs as we commune together, And lightens the world we see. The rains are as dews for the christening Of dawns that the nights benumb: The spring's voice answers me listening For speech of a child to come, While promise of music is glistening On lips that delight keeps dumb. The mists and the storms receding At sight of you smile and die: Your eyes held wide on me reading Shed summer across the sky: Your heart shines clear for me, heeding No more of the world than I. The world, what is it to you, dear, And me, if its face be grey, And the new-born year be a shrewd year For flowers that the fierce winds fray? You smile, and the sky seems blue, dear; You laugh, and the month turns May. Love cares not for care, he has daffed her Aside as a mate for guile: The sight that my soul yearns after Feeds full my sense for awhile; Your sweet little sun-faced laughter, Your good little glad grave smile. Your hands through the bookshelves flutter; Scott, Shakespeare, Dickens, are caught; Blake's visions, that lighten and mutter; Molière—and his smile has nought Left on it of sorrow, to utter The secret things of his thought. No grim thing written or graven But grows, if you gaze on it, bright; A lark's note rings from the raven, And tragedy's robe turns white; And shipwrecks drift into haven; And darkness laughs, and is light. Grief seems but a vision of madness; Life's key-note peals from above With nought in it more of sadness Than broods on the heart of a dove: At sight of you, thought grows gladness, And life, through love of you, love. A DOUBLE BALLAD OF AUGUST (1884) All Afric, winged with death and fire, Pants in our pleasant English air. Each blade of grass is tense as wire, And all the wood's loose trembling hair Stark in the broad and breathless glare Of hours whose touch wastes herb and tree. This bright sharp death shines everywhere; Life yearns for solace toward the sea. Earth seems a corpse upon the pyre; The sun, a scourge for slaves to bear. All power to fear, all keen desire, Lies dead as dreams of days that were Before the new-born world lay bare In heaven's wide eye, whereunder we Lie breathless till the season spare: Life yearns for solace toward the sea. Fierce hours, with ravening fangs that tire On spirit and sense, divide and share The throbs of thoughts that scarce respire, The throes of dreams that scarce forbear One mute immitigable prayer For cold perpetual sleep to be Shed snowlike on the sense of care. Life yearns for solace toward the sea. The dust of ways where men suspire Seems even the dust of death's dim lair. But though the feverish days be dire The sea-wind rears and cheers its fair Blithe broods of babes that here and there Make the sands laugh and glow for glee With gladder flowers than gardens wear. Life yearns for solace toward the sea. The music dies not off the lyre That lets no soul alive despair. Sleep strikes not dumb the breathless choir Of waves whose note bids sorrow spare. As glad they sound, as fast they fare, As when fate's word first set them free And gave them light and night to wear. Life yearns for solace toward the sea. For there, though night and day conspire To compass round with toil and snare And changeless whirl of change, whose gyre Draws all things deathwards unaware, The spirit of life they scourge and scare, Wild waves that follow on waves that flee Laugh, knowing that yet, though earth despair, Life yearns for solace toward the sea. HEARTSEASE COUNTRY TO ISABEL SWINBURNE The far green westward heavens are bland, The far green Wiltshire downs are clear As these deep meadows hard at hand: The sight knows hardly far from near, Nor morning joy from evening cheer. In cottage garden-plots their bees Find many a fervent flower to seize And strain and drain the heart away From ripe sweet-williams and sweet-peas At every turn on every way. But gladliest seems one flower to expand Its whole sweet heart all round us here; 'Tis Heartsease Country, Pansy Land. Nor sounds nor savours harsh and drear Where engines yell and halt and veer Can vex the sense of him who sees One flower-plot midway, that for trees Has poles, and sheds all grimed or grey For bowers like those that take the breeze At every turn on every way. Content even there they smile and stand, Sweet thought's heart-easing flowers, nor fear, With reek and roaring steam though fanned, Nor shrink nor perish as they peer. The heart's eye holds not those more dear That glow between the lanes and leas Where'er the homeliest hand may please To bid them blossom as they may Where light approves and wind agrees At every turn on every way. Sister, the word of winds and seas Endures not as the word of these Your wayside flowers whose breath would say How hearts that love may find heart's ease At every turn on every way. A BALLAD OF APPEAL TO CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI Song wakes with every wakening year From hearts of birds that only feel Brief spring's deciduous flower-time near: And song more strong to help or heal Shall silence worse than winter seal? From love-lit thought's remurmuring cave The notes that rippled, wave on wave, Were clear as love, as faith were strong; And all souls blessed the soul that gave Sweet water from the well of song. All hearts bore fruit of joy to hear, All eyes felt mist upon them steal For joy's sake, trembling toward a tear, When, loud as marriage-bells that peal, Or flutelike soft, or keen like steel, Sprang the sheer music; sharp or grave, We heard the drift of winds that drave, And saw, swept round by ghosts in throng, Dark rocks, that yielded, where they clave, Sweet water from the well of song. Blithe verse made all the dim sense clear That smiles of babbling babes conceal: Prayer's perfect heart spake here: and here Rose notes of blameless woe and weal, More soft than this poor song's appeal. Where orchards bask, where cornfields wave, They dropped like rains that cleanse and lave, And scattered all the year along, Like dewfall on an April grave, Sweet water from the well of song. Ballad, go bear our prayer, and crave Pardon, because thy lowlier stave Can do this plea no right, but wrong. Ask nought beside thy pardon, save Sweet water from the well of song. CRADLE SONGS (To a tune of Blake's) I [Baby, baby bright] Baby, baby bright, Sleep can steal from sight Little of your light: Soft as fire in dew, Still the life in you Lights your slumber through. Four white eyelids keep Fast the seal of sleep Deep as love is deep: Yet, though closed it lies, Love behind them spies Heaven in two blue eyes. II [Baby, baby dear] Baby, baby dear, Earth and heaven are near Now, for heaven is here. Heaven is every place Where your flower-sweet face Fills our eyes with grace. Till your own eyes deign Earth a glance again, Earth and heaven are twain. Now your sleep is done, Shine, and show the sun Earth and heaven are one. III [Baby, baby sweet] Baby, baby sweet, Love's own lips are meet Scarce to kiss your feet. Hardly love's own ear, When your laugh crows clear, Quite deserves to hear. Hardly love's own wile, Though it please awhile, Quite deserves your smile. Baby full of grace, Bless us yet a space: Sleep will come apace. IV [Baby, baby true] Baby, baby true, Man, whate'er he do, May deceive not you. Smiles whose love is guile, Worn a flattering while, Win from you no smile. One, the smile alone Out of love's heart grown, Ever wins your own. Man, a dunce uncouth, Errs in age and youth: Babies know the truth. V [Baby, baby fair] Baby, baby fair, Love is fain to dare Bless your haughtiest air. Baby blithe and bland, Reach but forth a hand None may dare withstand; Love, though wellnigh cowed, Yet would praise aloud Pride so sweetly proud. No! the fitting word Even from breeze or bird Never yet was heard. VI [Baby, baby kind] Baby, baby kind, Though no word we find, Bear us yet in mind. Half a little hour, Baby bright in bower, Keep this thought aflower— Love it is, I see, Here with heart and knee Bows and worships me. What can baby do, Then, for love so true?— Let it worship you. VII [Baby, baby wise] Baby, baby wise, Love's divine surmise Lights your constant eyes. Day and night and day One mute word would they, As the soul saith, say. Trouble comes and goes; Wonder ebbs and flows; Love remains and glows. As the fledgeling dove Feels the breast above, So your heart feels love. PELAGIUS I The sea shall praise him and the shores bear part That reared him when the bright south world was black With fume of creeds more foul than hell's own rack, Still darkening more love's face with loveless art Since Paul, faith's fervent Antichrist, of heart Heroic, haled the world vehemently back From Christ's pure path on dire Jehovah's track, And said to dark Elisha's Lord, “Thou art.” But one whose soul had put the raiment on Of love that Jesus left with James and John Withstood that Lord whose seals of love were lies, Seeing what we see—how, touched by Truth's bright rod, The fiend whom Jews and Africans called God Feels his own hell take hold on him, and dies. II The world has no such flower in any land, And no such pearl in any gulf the sea, As any babe on any mother's knee. But all things blessed of men by saints are banned: God gives them grace to read and understand The palimpsest of evil, writ where we, Poor fools and lovers but of love, can see Nought save a blessing signed by Love's own hand. The smile that opens heaven on us for them Hath sin's transmitted birthmark hid therein: The kiss it craves calls down from heaven a rod. If innocence be sin that Gods condemn, Praise we the men who so being born in sin First dared the doom and broke the bonds of God. III Man's heel is on the Almighty's neck who said, Let there be hell, and there was hell—on earth. But not for that may men forget their worth— Nay, but much more remember them—who led The living first from dwellings of the dead, And rent the cerecloths that were wont to engirth Souls wrapped and swathed and swaddled from their birth With lies that bound them fast from heel to head. Among the tombs when wise men all their lives Dwelt, and cried out, and cut themselves with knives, These men, being foolish, and of saints abhorred Beheld in heaven the sun by saints reviled, Love, and on earth one everlasting Lord In every likeness of a little child. LOUIS BLANC THREE SONNETS TO HIS MEMORY I [The stainless soul that smiled through glorious eyes] The stainless soul that smiled through glorious eyes; The bright grave brow whereon dark fortune's blast Might blow, but might not bend it, nor o'ercast, Save for one fierce fleet hour of shame, the skies Thrilled with warm dreams of worthier days to rise And end the whole world's winter; here at last, If death be death, have passed into the past; If death be life, live, though their semblance dies. Hope and high faith inviolate of distrust Shone strong as life inviolate of the grave Through each bright word and lineament serene. Most loving righteousness and love most just Crowned, as day crowns the dawn-enkindled wave, With visible aureole thine unfaltering mien. II [Strong time and fire-swift change, with lightnings clad] Strong time and fire-swift change, with lightnings clad And shod with thunders of reverberate years, Have filled with light and sound of hopes and fears The space of many a season, since I had Grace of good hap to make my spirit glad, Once communing with thine: and memory hears The bright voice yet that then rejoiced mine ears, Sees yet the light of eyes that spake, and bade Fear not, but hope, though then time's heart were weak And heaven by hell shade-stricken, and the range Of high-born hope made questionable and strange As twilight trembling till the sunlight speak. Thou sawest the sunrise and the storm in one Break: seest thou now the storm-compelling sun? III [Surely thou seest, O spirit of light and fire] Surely thou seest, O spirit of light and fire, Surely thou canst not choose, O soul, but see The days whose dayspring was beheld of thee Ere eyes less pure might have their hope's desire, Beholding life in heaven again respire Where men saw nought that was or was to be, Save only death imperial. Thou and he Who has the heart of all men's hearts for lyre, Ye twain, being great of spirit as time is great, And sure of sight as truth's own heavenward eye, Beheld the forms of forces passing by And certitude of equal-balanced fate, Whose breath forefelt makes darkness palpitate, And knew that light should live and darkness die. VOS DEOS LAUDAMUS: THE CONSERVATIVE JOURNALIST'S ANTHEM “As a matter of fact, no man living, or who ever lived—not Cæsar or Pericles, not Shakespeare or Michael Angelo— could confer honour more than he took on entering the House of Lords.” —Saturday Review, December 15, 1883. “Clumsy and shallow snobbery—can do no hurt.” —Ibid. I O Lords our Gods, beneficent, sublime, In the evening, and before the morning flames, We praise, we bless, we magnify your names. The slave is he that serves not; his the crime And shame, who hails not as the crown of Time That House wherein the all-envious world acclaims Such glory that the reflex of it shames All crowns bestowed of men for prose or rhyme. The serf, the cur, the sycophant is he Who feels no cringing motion twitch his knee When from a height too high for Shakespeare nods The wearer of a higher than Milton's crown. Stoop, Chaucer, stoop: Keats, Shelley, Burns, bow down: These have no part with you, O Lords our Gods. II O Lords our Gods, it is not that ye sit Serene above the thunder, and exempt From strife of tongues and casualties that tempt Men merely found by proof of manhood fit For service of their fellows: this is it Which sets you past the reach of Time's attempt, Which gives us right of justified contempt For commonwealths built up by mere men's wit: That gold unlocks not, nor may flatteries ope, The portals of your heaven; that none may hope With you to watch how life beneath you plods, Save for high service given, high duty done; That never was your rank ignobly won: For this we give you praise, O Lords our Gods. III O Lords our Gods, the times are evil: you Redeem the time, because of evil days. While abject souls in servitude of praise Bow down to heads untitled, and the crew Whose honour dwells but in the deeds they do, From loftier hearts your nobler servants raise More manful salutation: yours are bays That not the dawn's plebeian pearls bedew; Yours, laurels plucked not of such hands as wove Old age its chaplet in Colonos' grove. Our time, with heaven and with itself at odds, Makes all lands else as seas that seethe and boil; But yours are yet the corn and wine and oil, And yours our worship yet, O Lords our Gods. December 15, 1883. ON THE BICENTENARY OF CORNEILLE CELEBRATED UNDER THE PRESIDENCY OF VICTOR HUGO Scarce two hundred years are gone, and the world is past away As a noise of brawling wind, as a flash of breaking foam, That beheld the singer born who raised up the dead of Rome; And a mightier now than he bids him too rise up to-day. All the dim great age is dust, and its king is tombless clay, But its loftier laurel green as in living eyes it clomb, And his memory whom it crowned hath his people's heart for home, And the shade across it falls of a lordlier-flowering bay. Stately shapes about the tomb of their mighty maker pace, Heads of high-plumed Spaniards shine, souls revive of Roman race, Sound of arms and words of wail through the glowing darkness rise, Speech of hearts heroic rings forth of lips that know not breath, And the light of thoughts august fills the pride of kindling eyes Whence of yore the spell of song drove the shadow of darkling death. IN SEPULCRETIS “Vidistis ipso rapere de rogo cœnam.” —Catullus, LIX. 3. “To publish even one line of an author which he himself has not intended for the public at large—especially letters which are addressed to private persons—is to commit a despicable act of felony.” —Heine. I It is not then enough that men who give The best gifts given of man to man should feel, Alive, a snake's head ever at their heel: Small hurt the worms may do them while they live— Such hurt as scorn for scorn's sake may forgive. But now, when death and fame have set one seal On tombs whereat Love, Grief, and Glory kneel, Men sift all secrets, in their critic sieve, Of graves wherein the dust of death might shrink To know what tongues defile the dead man's name With loathsome love, and praise that stings like shame. Rest once was theirs, who had crossed the mortal brink: No rest, no reverence now: dull fools undress Death's holiest shrine, life's veriest nakedness. II A man was born, sang, suffered, loved, and died. Men scorned him living: let us praise him dead. His life was brief and bitter, gently led And proudly, but with pure and blameless pride. He wrought no wrong toward any; satisfied With love and labour, whence our souls are fed With largesse yet of living wine and bread. Come, let us praise him: here is nought to hide. Make bare the poor dead secrets of his heart, Strip the stark-naked soul, that all may peer, Spy, smirk, sniff, snap, snort, snivel, snarl, and sneer: Let none so sad, let none so sacred part Lie still for pity, rest unstirred for shame, But all be scanned of all men. This is fame. III “Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!” Titus Andronicus, Act iv., Scene 2. If one, that strutted up the brawling streets As foreman of the flock whose concourse greets Men's ears with bray more dissonant than brass, Would change from blame to praise as coarse and crass His natural note, and learn the fawning feats Of lapdogs, who but knows what luck he meets? But all in vain old fable holds her glass. Mocked and reviled by men of poisonous breath, A great man dies: but one thing worst was spared; Not all his heart by their base hands lay bared. One comes to crown with praise the dust of death; And lo, through him this worst is brought to pass. Now, what a thing it is to be an ass! IV Shame, such as never yet dealt heavier stroke On heads more shameful, fall on theirs through whom Dead men may keep inviolate not their tomb, But all its depths these ravenous grave-worms choke. And yet what waste of wrath were this, to invoke Shame on the shameless? Even their twin-born doom, Their native air of life, a carrion fume, Their natural breath of love, a noisome smoke, The bread they break, the cup whereof they drink, The record whose remembrance damns their name, Smells, tastes, and sounds of nothing but of shame. If thankfulness nor pity bids them think What work is this of theirs, and pause betimes, Not Shakespeare's grave would scare them off with rhymes. LOVE AND SCORN I Love, loyallest and lordliest born of things, Immortal that shouldst be, though all else end, In plighted hearts of fearless friend with friend, Whose hand may curb or clip thy plume-plucked wings? Not grief's nor time's: though these be lords and kings Crowned, and their yoke bid vassal passions bend, They may not pierce the spirit of sense, or blend Quick poison with the soul's live watersprings. The true clear heart whose core is manful trust Fears not that very death may turn to dust Love lit therein as toward a brother born, If one touch make not all its fine gold rust, If one breath blight not all its glad ripe corn, And all its fire be turned to fire of scorn. II Scorn only, scorn begot of bitter proof By keen experience of a trustless heart, Bears burning in her new-born hand the dart Wherewith love dies heart-stricken, and the roof Falls of his palace, and the storied woof Long woven of many a year with life's whole art Is rent like any rotten weed apart, And hardly with reluctant eyes aloof Cold memory guards one relic scarce exempt Yet from the fierce corrosion of contempt, And hardly saved by pity. Woe are we That once we loved, and love not; but we know The ghost of love, surviving yet in show, Where scorn has passed, is vain as grief must be. III O sacred, just, inevitable scorn, Strong child of righteous judgment, whom with grief The rent heart bears, and wins not yet relief, Seeing of its pain so dire a portent born, Must thou not spare one sheaf of all the corn, One doit of all the treasure? not one sheaf, Not one poor doit of all? not one dead leaf Of all that fell and left behind a thorn? Is man so strong that one should scorn another? Is any as God, not made of mortal mother, That love should turn in him to gall and flame? Nay: but the true is not the false heart's brother: Love cannot love disloyalty: the name That else it wears is love no more, but shame. ON THE DEATH OF RICHARD DOYLE A light of blameless laughter, fancy-bred, Soft-souled and glad and kind as love or sleep, Fades, and sweet mirth's own eyes are fain to weep Because her blithe and gentlest bird is dead. Weep, elves and fairies all, that never shed Tear yet for mortal mourning: you that keep The doors of dreams whence nought of ill may creep, Mourn once for one whose lips your honey fed. Let waters of the Golden River steep The rose-roots whence his grave blooms rosy-red, And murmuring of Hyblæan hives be deep About the summer silence of its bed, And nought less gracious than a violet peep Between the grass grown greener round his head. IN MEMORY OF HENRY A. BRIGHT Yet again another, ere his crowning year, Gone from friends that here may look for him no more. Never now for him shall hope set wide the door, Hope that hailed him hither, fain to greet him here. All the gracious garden-flowers he held so dear, Oldworld English blossoms, all his homestead store, Oldworld grief had strewn them round his bier of yore, Bidding each drop leaf by leaf as tear by tear; Rarer lutes than mine had borne more tuneful token, Touched by subtler hands than echoing time can wrong, Sweet as flowers had strewn his graveward path along. Now may no such old sweet dirges more be spoken, Now the flowers whose breath was very song are broken, Nor may sorrow find again so sweet a song. A SOLITUDE Sea beyond sea, sand after sweep of sand, Here ivory smooth, here cloven and ridged with flow Of channelled waters soft as rain or snow, Stretch their lone length at ease beneath the bland Grey gleam of skies whose smile on wave and strand Shines weary like a man's who smiles to know That now no dream can mock his faith with show, Nor cloud for him seem living sea or land. Is there an end at all of all this waste, These crumbling cliffs defeatured and defaced, These ruinous heights of sea-sapped walls that slide Seaward with all their banks of bleak blown flowers Glad yet of life, ere yet their hope subside Beneath the coil of dull dense waves and hours? VICTOR HUGO: L'ARCHIPEL DE LA MANCHE Sea and land are fairer now, nor aught is all the same, Since a mightier hand than Time's hath woven their votive wreath. Rocks as swords half drawn from out the smooth wave's jewelled sheath, Fields whose flowers a tongue divine hath numbered name by name, Shores whereby the midnight or the noon clothed round with flame Hears the clamour jar and grind which utters from beneath Cries of hungering waves like beasts fast bound that gnash their teeth, All of these the sun that lights them lights not like his fame; None of these is but the thing it was before he came. Where the darkling overfalls like dens of torment seethe, High on tameless moorlands, down in meadows bland and tame, Where the garden hides, and where the wind uproots the heath, Glory now henceforth for ever, while the world shall be, Shines, a star that keeps not time with change on earth and sea. THE TWILIGHT OF THE LORDS I Is the sound a trumpet blown, or a bell for burial tolled, Whence the whole air vibrates now to the clash of words like swords— “Let us break their bonds in sunder, and cast away their cords; Long enough the world has mocked us, and marvelled to behold How the grown man bears the curb whence his boyhood was controlled”? Nay, but hearken: surer counsel more sober speech affords: “Is the past not all inscribed with the praises of our Lords? Is the memory dead of deeds done of yore, the love grown cold That should bind our hearts to trust in their counsels wise and bold? These that stand against you now, senseless crowds and heartless hordes, Are not these the sons of men that withstood your kings of old? Theirs it is to bind and loose; theirs the key that knows the wards, Theirs the staff to lead or smite; yours, the spades and ploughs and hods: Theirs to hear and yours to cry, Power is yours, O Lords our Gods.” II Hear, O England: these are they that would counsel thee aright. Wouldst thou fain have all thy sons sons of thine indeed, and free? Nay, but then no more at all as thou hast been shalt thou be: Needs must many dwell in darkness, that some may look on light; Needs must poor men brook the wrong that ensures the rich man's right. How shall kings and lords be worshipped, if no man bow the knee? How, if no man worship these, may thy praise endure with thee? How, except thou trust in these, shall thy name not lose its might? These have had their will of thee since the Norman came to smite: Sires on grandsires, even as wave after wave along the sea, Sons on sires have followed, steadfast as clouds or hours in flight. Time alone hath power to say, time alone hath eyes to see, If your walls of rule be built but of clay-compacted sods, If your place of old shall know you no more, O Lords our Gods. III Through the stalls wherein ye sit sounds a sentence while we wait, Set your house in order: is it not builded on the sand? Set your house in order, seeing the night is hard at hand. As the twilight of the Gods in the northern dream of fate Is this hour that comes against you, albeit this hour come late. Ye whom Time and Truth bade heed, and ye would not understand, Now an axe draws nigh the tree overshadowing all the land, And its edge of doom is set to the root of all your state. Light is more than darkness now, faith than fear and hope than hate; And what morning wills, behold, all the night shall not withstand. Rods of office, helms of rule, staffs of wise men, crowns of great, While the people willed, ye bare; now their hopes and hearts expand, Time with silent foot makes dust of your broken crowns and rods, And the lordship of your godhead is gone, O Lords our Gods. CLEAR THE WAY! Clear the way, my lords and lackeys! you have had your day. Here you have your answer—England's yea against your nay: Long enough your house has held you: up, and clear the way! Lust and falsehood, craft and traffic, precedent and gold, Tongue of courtier, kiss of harlot, promise bought and sold, Gave you heritage of empire over thralls of old. Now that all these things are rotten, all their gold is rust, Quenched the pride they lived by, dead the faith and cold the lust, Shall their heritage not also turn again to dust? By the grace of these they reigned, who left their sons their sway: By the grace of these, what England says her lords unsay: Till at last her cry go forth against them—Clear the way! By the grace of trust in treason knaves have lived and lied: By the force of fear and folly fools have fed their pride: By the strength of sloth and custom reason stands defied. Lest perchance your reckoning on some latter day be worse, Halt and hearken, lords of land and princes of the purse, Ere the tide be full that comes with blessing and with curse. Where we stand, as where you sit, scarce falls a sprinkling spray; But the wind that swells, the wave that follows, none shall stay: Spread no more of sail for shipwreck: out, and clear the way! A WORD FOR THE COUNTRY Men, born of the land that for ages Has been honoured where freedom was dear, Till your labour wax fat on its wages You shall never be peers of a peer. Where might is, the right is: Long purses make strong swords. Let weakness learn meekness: God save the House of Lords! You are free to consume in stagnation: You are equal in right to obey: You are brothers in bonds, and the nation Is your mother—whose sons are her prey. Those others your brothers, Who toil not, weave, nor till, Refuse you and use you As waiters on their will. But your fathers bowed down to their masters And obeyed them and served and adored. Shall the sheep not give thanks to their pastors? Shall the serf not give praise to his lord? Time, waning and gaining, Grown other now than then, Needs pastors and masters For sheep, and not for men. If his grandsire did service in battle, If his grandam was kissed by a king, Must men to my lord be as cattle Or as apes that he leads in a string? To deem so, to dream so, Would bid the world proclaim The dastards for bastards, Not heirs of England's fame. Not in spite but in right of dishonour, There are actors who trample your boards Till the earth that endures you upon her Grows weary to bear you, my lords. Your token is broken, It will not pass for gold: Your glory looks hoary, Your sun in heaven turns cold. They are worthy to reign on their brothers, To contemn them as clods and as carles, Who are Graces by grace of such mothers As brightened the bed of King Charles. What manner of banner, What fame is this they flaunt, That Britain, soul-smitten, Should shrink before their vaunt? Bright sons of sublime prostitution, You are made of the mire of the street Where your grandmothers walked in pollution Till a coronet shone at their feet. Your Graces, whose faces Bear high the bastard's brand, Seem stronger no longer Than all this honest land. But the sons of her soldiers and seamen, They are worthy forsooth of their hire. If the father won praise from all free men, Shall the sons not exult in their sire? Let money make sunny And power make proud their lives, And feed them and breed them Like drones in drowsiest hives. But if haply the name be a burden And the souls be no kindred of theirs, Should wise men rejoice in such guerdon Or brave men exult in such heirs? Or rather the father Frown, shamefaced, on the son, And no men but foemen, Deriding, cry “Well done”? Let the gold and the land they inherit Pass ever from hand into hand: In right of the forefather's merit Let the gold be the son's, and the land. Soft raiment, rich payment, High place, the state affords; Full measure of pleasure; But now no more, my lords. Is the future beleaguered with dangers If the poor be far other than slaves? Shall the sons of the land be as strangers In the land of their forefathers' graves? Shame were it to bear it, And shame it were to see: If free men you be, men, Let proof proclaim you free. “But democracy means dissolution: See, laden with clamour and crime, How the darkness of dim revolution Comes deepening the twilight of time! Ah, better the fetter That holds the poor man's hand Than peril of sterile Blind change that wastes the land. “Gaze forward through clouds that environ; It shall be as it was in the past: Not with dreams, but with blood and with iron, Shall a nation be moulded to last.” So teach they, so preach they, Who dream themselves the dream That hallows the gallows And bids the scaffold stream. “With a hero at head, and a nation Well gagged and well drilled and well cowed, And a gospel of war and damnation, Has not empire a right to be proud? Fools prattle and tattle Of freedom, reason, right, The beauty of duty, The loveliness of light. “But we know, we believe it, we see it, Force only has power upon earth.” So be it! and ever so be it For souls that are bestial by birth! Let Prussian with Russian Exchange the kiss of slaves: But sea-folk are free folk By grace of winds and waves. Has the past from the sepulchres beckoned? Let answer from Englishmen be— No man shall be lord of us reckoned Who is baser, not better, than we. No coward, empowered To soil a brave man's name: For shame's sake and fame's sake, Enough of fame and shame. Fame needs not the golden addition; Shame bears it abroad as a brand. Let the deed, and no more the tradition, Speak out and be heard through the land. Pride, rootless and fruitless, No longer takes and gives: But surer and purer The soul of England lives. He is master and lord of his brothers Who is worthier and wiser than they. Him only, him surely, shall others, Else equal, observe and obey. Truth, flawless and awless, Do falsehood what it can, Makes royal the loyal And simple heart of man. Who are these, then, that England should hearken, Who rage and wax wroth and grow pale If she turn from the sunsets that darken And her ship for the morning set sail? Let strangers fear dangers: All know, that hold her dear, Dishonour upon her Can only fall through fear. Men, born of the landsmen and seamen Who served her with souls and with swords, She bids you be brothers, and free men, And lordless, and fearless of lords. She cares not, she dares not Care now for gold or steel: Light lead her, truth speed her, God save the Commonweal! A WORD FOR THE NATION I A word across the water Against our ears is borne, Of threatenings and of slaughter, Of rage and spite and scorn: We have not, alack, an ally to befriend us, And the season is ripe to extirpate and end us: Let the German touch hands with the Gaul, And the fortress of England must fall; And the sea shall be swept of her seamen, And the waters they ruled be their graves, And Dutchmen and Frenchmen be free men, And Englishmen slaves. II Our time once more is over, Once more our end is near: A bull without a drover, The Briton reels to rear, And the van of the nations is held by his betters, And the seas of the world shall be loosed from his fetters, And his glory shall pass as a breath, And the life that is in him be death; And the sepulchre sealed on his glory For a sign to the nations shall be As of Tyre and of Carthage in story, Once lords of the sea. III The lips are wise and loyal, The hearts are brave and true, Imperial thoughts and royal Make strong the clamorous crew, Whence louder and prouder the noise of defiance Rings rage from the grave of a trustless alliance, And bids us beware and be warned, As abhorred of all nations and scorned, As a swordless and spiritless nation, A wreck on the waste of the waves. So foams the released indignation Of masterless slaves. IV Brute throats that miss the collar, Bowed backs that ask the whip, Stretched hands that lack the dollar, And many a lie-seared lip, Forefeel and foreshow for us signs as funereal As the signs that were regal of yore and imperial; We shall pass as the princes they served, We shall reap what our fathers deserved, And the place that was England's be taken By one that is worthier than she, And the yoke of her empire be shaken Like spray from the sea. V French hounds, whose necks are aching Still from the chain they crave, In dog-day madness breaking The dog-leash, thus may rave: But the seas that for ages have fostered and fenced her Laugh, echoing the yell of their kennel against her And their moan if destruction draw near them And the roar of her laughter to hear them; For she knows that if Englishmen be men Their England has all that she craves; All love and all honour from free men, All hatred from slaves. VI All love that rests upon her Like sunshine and sweet air, All light of perfect honour And praise that ends in prayer, She wins not more surely, she wears not more proudly, Than the token of tribute that clatters thus loudly, The tribute of foes when they meet That rattles and rings at her feet, The tribute of rage and of rancour, The tribute of slaves to the free, To the people whose hope hath its anchor Made fast in the sea. VII No fool that bows the back he Feels fit for scourge or brand, No scurril scribes that lackey The lords of Lackeyland, No penman that yearns, as he turns on his pallet, For the place or the pence of a peer or a valet, No whelp of as currish a pack As the litter whose yelp it gives back, Though he answer the cry of his brother As echoes might answer from caves, Shall be witness as though for a mother Whose children were slaves. VIII But those found fit to love her, Whose love has root in faith, Who hear, though darkness cover Time's face, what memory saith, Who seek not the service of great men or small men But the weal that is common for comfort of all men, Those yet that in trust have beholden Truth's dawn over England grow golden And quicken the darkness that stagnates And scatter the shadows that flee, Shall reply for her meanest as magnates And masters by sea. IX And all shall mark her station, Her message all shall hear, When, equal-eyed, the nation Bids all her sons draw near, And freedom be more than tradition or faction, And thought be no swifter to serve her than action, And justice alone be above her, That love may be prouder to love her, And time on the crest of her story Inscribe, as remembrance engraves, The sign that subdues with its glory Kings, princes, and slaves. A WORD FROM THE PSALMIST Ps. xciv. 8 I “Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?” From pulpit or choir beneath the steeple, Though the words be fierce, the tones are bland. But a louder than the Church's echo thunders In the ears of men who may not choose but hear; And the heart in him that hears it leaps and wonders, With triumphant hope astonished, or with fear. For the names whose sound was power awaken Neither love nor reverence now nor dread; Their strongholds and shrines are stormed and taken, Their kingdom and all its works are dead. II Take heed: for the tide of time is risen: It is full not yet, though now so high That spirits and hopes long pent in prison Feel round them a sense of freedom nigh, And a savour keen and sweet of brine and billow, And a murmur deep and strong of deepening strength. Though the watchman dream, with sloth or pride for pillow, And the night be long, not endless is its length. From the springs of dawn, from clouds that sever, From the equal heavens and the eastward sea, The witness comes that endures for ever, Till men be brethren and thralls be free. III But the wind of the wings of dawn expanding Strikes chill on your hearts as change and death. Ye are old, but ye have not understanding; And proud, but your pride is a dead man's breath. And your wise men, toward whose words and signs ye hearken, And your strong men, in whose hands ye put your trust, Strain eyes to behold but clouds and dreams that darken, Stretch hands that can find but weapons red with rust. Their watchword rings, and the night rejoices, But the lark's note laughs at the night-bird's notes— “Is virtue verily found in voices? Or is wisdom won when all win votes? IV “Take heed, ye unwise indeed, who listen When the wind's wings beat and shift and change; Whose hearts are uplift, whose eyeballs glisten, With desire of new things great and strange. Let not dreams misguide nor any visions wrong you: That which has been, it is now as it was then. Is not Compromise of old a god among you? Is not Precedent indeed a king of men? But the windy hopes that lead mislead you, And the sounds ye hear are void and vain, Is a vote a coat? will franchise feed you, Or words be a roof against the rain? V “Eight ages are gone since kingship entered, With knights and peers at its harnessed back, And the land, no more in its own strength centred, Was cast for a prey to the princely pack. But we pared the fangs and clipped the ravening claws of it, And good was in time brought forth of an evil thing, And the land's high name waxed lordlier in war because of it, When chartered Right had bridled and curbed the king. And what so fair has the world beholden, And what so firm has withstood the years, As Monarchy bound in chains all golden, And Freedom guarded about with peers? VI “How think ye? know not your lords and masters What collars are meet for brawling throats? Is change not mother of strange disasters? Shall plague or peril be stayed by votes? Out of precedent and privilege and order Have we plucked the flower of compromise, whose root Bears blossoms that shine from border again to border, And the mouths of many are fed with its temperate fruit. Your masters are wiser than ye, their henchmen: Your lords know surely whereof ye have need. Equality? Fools, would you fain be Frenchmen? Is equity more than a word indeed? VII “Your voices, forsooth, your most sweet voices, Your worthy voices, your love, your hate, Your choice, who know not whereof your choice is, What stays are these for a stable state? Inconstancy, blind and deaf with its own fierce babble, Swells ever your throats with storm of uncertain cheers: He leans on straws who leans on a light-souled rabble; His trust is frail who puts not his trust in peers.” So shrills the message whose word convinces Of righteousness knaves, of wisdom fools; That serfs may boast them because of princes, And the weak rejoice that the strong man rules. VIII True friends, ye people, are these, the faction Full-mouthed that flatters and snarls and bays, That fawns and foams with alternate action, And mocks the names that it soils with praise. As from fraud and force their power had first beginning, So by righteousness and peace it may not stand, But by craft of state and nets of secret spinning, Words that weave and unweave wiles like ropes of sand, Form, custom, and gold, and laws grown hoary, And strong tradition that guards the gate: To these, O people, to these give glory, That your name among nations may be great. IX How long—for haply not now much longer— Shall fear put faith in a faithless creed, And shapes and shadows of truths be stronger In strong men's eyes than the truth indeed? If freedom be not a word that dies when spoken, If justice be not a dream whence men must wake, How shall not the bonds of the thraldom of old be broken, And right put might in the hands of them that break? For clear as a tocsin from the steeple Is the cry gone forth along the land, Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand? A BALLAD AT PARTING Sea to sea that clasps and fosters England, uttering evermore Song eterne and praise immortal of the indomitable shore, Lifts aloud her constant heart up, south to north and east to west, Here in speech that shames all music, there in thunder-throated roar, Chiming concord out of discord, waking rapture out of rest. All her ways are lovely, all her works and symbols are divine, Yet shall man love best what first bade leap his heart and bend his knee; Yet where first his whole soul worshipped shall his soul set up her shrine: Nor may love not know the lovelier, fair as both beheld may be, Here the limitless north-eastern, there the strait south-western sea. Though their chant bear all one burden, as ere man was born it bore; Though the burden be diviner than the songs all souls adore; Yet may love not choose but choose between them which to love the best. Me the sea my nursing-mother, me the Channel green and hoar, Holds at heart more fast than all things, bares for me the goodlier breast, Lifts for me the lordlier love-song, bids for me more sunlight shine, Sounds for me the stormier trumpet of the sweeter strain to me. So the broad pale Thames is loved not like the tawny springs of Tyne: Choice is clear between them for the soul whose vision holds in fee Here the limitless north-eastern, there the strait south-western sea. Choice is clear, but dear is either; nor has either not in store Many a likeness, many a written sign of spirit-searching lore, Whence the soul takes fire of sweet remembrance, magnified and blest. Thought of songs whose flame-winged feet have trod the unfooted water-floor When the lord of all the living lords of souls bade speed their quest; Soft live sound like children's babble down the rippling sand's incline, Or the lovely song that loves them, hailed with thankful prayer and plea; These are parcels of the harvest here whose gathered sheaves are mine, Garnered now, but sown and reaped where winds make wild with wrath or glee Here the limitless north-eastern, there the strait south-western sea. Song, thy name is freedom, seeing thy strength was born of breeze and brine. Fare now forth and fear no fortune: such a seal is set on thee. Joy begat and memory bare thee, seeing in spirit a twofold sign, Even the sign of those thy fosters, each as thou from all time free, Here the limitless north-eastern, there the strait south-western sea. ASTROPHEL AND OTHER POEMS TO WILLIAM MORRIS ASTROPHEL AFTER READING SIR PHILIP SIDNEY'S ARCADIA IN THE GARDEN OF AN OLD ENGLISH MANOR HOUSE I A star in the silence that follows The song of the death of the sun Speaks music in heaven, and the hollows And heights of the world are as one; One lyre that outsings and outlightens The rapture of sunset, and thrills Mute night till the sense of it brightens The soul that it fills. The flowers of the sun that is sunken Hang heavy of heart as of head; The bees that have eaten and drunken The soul of their sweetness are fled; But a sunflower of song, on whose honey My spirit has fed as a bee, Makes sunnier than morning was sunny The twilight for me. The letters and lines on the pages That sundered mine eyes and the flowers Wax faint as the shadows of ages That sunder their season and ours; As the ghosts of the centuries that sever A season of colourless time From the days whose remembrance is ever, As they were, sublime. The season that bred and that cherished The soul that I commune with yet, Had it utterly withered and perished To rise not again as it set, Shame were it that Englishmen living Should read as their forefathers read The books of the praise and thanksgiving Of Englishmen dead O light of the land that adored thee A kindled thy soul with her breath, Whose life, such as fate would afford thee, Was lovelier than aught but thy death, By what name, could thy lovers but know it, Might love of thee hail thee afar, Philisides, Astrophel, poet Whose love was thy star? A star in the moondawn of Maytime, A star in the cloudland of change; Too splendid and sad for the daytime To cheer or eclipse or estrange; Too sweet for tradition or vision To see but through shadows of tears Rise deathless across the division Of measureless years. The twilight may deepen and harden As nightward the stream of it runs Till starshine transfigure a garden Whose radiance responds to the sun's: The light of the love of thee darkens The lights that arise and that set: The love that forgets thee not hearkens If England forget. II Bright and brief in the sight of grief and love the light of thy lifetime shone, Seen and felt by the gifts it dealt, the grace it gave, and again was gone: Ay, but now it is death, not thou, whom time has conquered as years pass on. Ay, not yet may the land forget that bore and loved thee and praised and wept, Sidney, lord of the stainless sword, the name of names that her heart's love kept Fast as thine did her own, a sign to light thy life till it sank and slept. Bright as then for the souls of men thy brave Arcadia resounds and shines, Lit with love that beholds above all joys and sorrows the steadfast signs, Faith, a splendour that hope makes tender, and truth, whose presage the soul divines. All the glory that girds the story of all thy life as with sunlight round, All the spell that on all souls fell who saw thy spirit, and held them bound, Lives for all that have heard the call and cadence yet of its music sound. Music bright as the soul of light, for wings an eagle, for notes a dove, Leaps and shines from the lustrous lines wherethrough thy soul from afar above Shone and sang till the darkness rang with light whose fire is the fount of love. Love that led thee alive, and fed thy soul with sorrows and joys and fears, Love that sped thee, alive and dead, to fame's fair goal with thy peerless peers, Feeds the flame of thy quenchless name with light that lightens the rayless years. Dark as sorrow though night and morrow may lower with presage of clouded fame, How may she that of old bare thee, may Sidney's England, be brought to shame? How should this be, while England is? What need of answer beyond thy name? III From the love that transfigures thy glory, From the light of the dawn of thy death, The life of thy song and thy story Took subtler and fierier breath. And we, though the day and the morrow Set fear and thanksgiving at strife, Hail yet in the star of thy sorrow The sun of thy life. Shame and fear may beset men here, and bid thanksgiving and pride be dumb: Faith, discrowned of her praise, and wound about with toils till her life wax numb, Scarce may see if the sundawn be, if darkness die not and dayrise come. But England, enmeshed and benetted With spiritless villainies round, With counsels of cowardice fretted, With trammels of treason enwound, Is yet, though the season be other Than wept and rejoiced over thee, Thine England, thy lover, thy mother, Sublime as the sea. Hers wast thou: if her face be now less bright, or seem for an hour less brave, Let but thine on her darkness shine, thy saviour spirit revive and save, Time shall see, as the shadows flee, her shame entombed in a shameful grave. If death and not life were the portal That opens on life at the last, If the spirit of Sidney were mortal And the past of it utterly past, Fear stronger than honour was ever, Forgetfulness mightier than fame, Faith knows not if England should never Subside into shame. Yea, but yet is thy sun not set, thy sunbright spirit of trust withdrawn: England's love of thee burns above all hopes that darken or fears that fawn: Hers thou art: and the faithful heart that hopes begets upon darkness dawn. The sunset that sunrise will follow Is less than the dream of a dream: The starshine on height and on hollow Sheds promise that dawn shall redeem: The night, if the daytime would hide it, Shows lovelier, aflame and afar, Thy soul and thy Stella's beside it, A star by a star. A NYMPHOLEPT Summer, and noon, and a splendour of silence, felt, Seen, and heard of the spirit within the sense. Soft through the frondage the shades of the sunbeams melt, Sharp through the foliage the shafts of them, keen and dense, Cleave, as discharged from the string of the God's bow, tense As a war-steed's girth, and bright as a warrior's belt. Ah, why should an hour that is heaven for an hour pass hence? I dare not sleep for delight of the perfect hour, Lest God be wroth that his gift should be scorned of man. The face of the warm bright world is the face of a flower, The word of the wind and the leaves that the light winds fan As the word that quickened at first into flame, and ran, Creative and subtle and fierce with invasive power, Through darkness and cloud, from the breath of the one God, Pan. The perfume of earth possessed by the sun pervades The chaster air that he soothes but with sense of sleep. Soft, imminent, strong as desire that prevails and fades, The passing noon that beholds not a cloudlet weep Imbues and impregnates life with delight more deep Than dawn or sunset or moonrise on lawns or glades Can shed from the skies that receive it and may not keep. The skies may hold not the splendour of sundown fast; It wanes into twilight as dawn dies down into day. And the moon, triumphant when twilight is overpast, Takes pride but awhile in the hours of her stately sway. But the might of the noon, though the light of it pass away, Leaves earth fulfilled of desires and of dreams that last; But if any there be that hath sense of them none can say. For if any there be that hath sight of them, sense, or trust Made strong by the might of a vision, the strength of a dream, His lips shall straiten and close as a dead man's must, His heart shall be sealed as the voice of a frost-bound stream. For the deep mid mystery of light and of heat that seem To clasp and pierce dark earth, and enkindle dust, Shall a man's faith say what it is? or a man's guess deem? Sleep lies not heavier on eyes that have watched all night Than hangs the heat of the noon on the hills and trees. Why now should the haze not open, and yield to sight A fairer secret than hope or than slumber sees? I seek not heaven with submission of lips and knees, With worship and prayer for a sign till it leap to light: I gaze on the gods about me, and call on these. I call on the gods hard by, the divine dim powers Whose likeness is here at hand, in the breathless air, In the pulseless peace of the fervid and silent flowers, In the faint sweet speech of the waters that whisper there. Ah, what should darkness do in a world so fair? The bent-grass heaves not, the couch-grass quails not or cowers; The wind's kiss frets not the rowan's or aspen's hair. But the silence trembles with passion of sound suppressed, And the twilight quivers and yearns to the sunward, wrung With love as with pain; and the wide wood's motionless breast Is thrilled with a dumb desire that would fain find tongue And palpitates, tongueless as she whom a man-snake stung, Whose heart now heaves in the nightingale, never at rest Nor satiated ever with song till her last be sung. Is it rapture or terror that circles me round, and invades Each vein of my life with hope—if it be not fear? Each pulse that awakens my blood into rapture fades, Each pulse that subsides into dread of a strange thing near Requickens with sense of a terror less dread than dear. Is peace not one with light in the deep green glades Where summer at noonday slumbers? Is peace not here? The tall thin stems of the firs, and the roof sublime That screens from the sun the floor of the steep still wood, Deep, silent, splendid, and perfect and calm as time, Stand fast as ever in sight of the night they stood, When night gave all that moonlight and dewfall could. The dense ferns deepen, the moss glows warm as the thyme: The wild heath quivers about me: the world is good. Is it Pan's breath, fierce in the tremulous maidenhair, That bids fear creep as a snake through the woodlands, felt In the leaves that it stirs not yet, in the mute bright air, In the stress of the sun? For here has the great God dwelt: For hence were the shafts of his love or his anger dealt. For here has his wrath been fierce as his love was fair, When each was as fire to the darkness its breath bade melt. Is it love, is it dread, that enkindles the trembling noon, That yearns, reluctant in rapture that fear has fed, As man for woman, as woman for man? Full soon, If I live, and the life that may look on him drop not dead, Shall the ear that hears not a leaf quake hear his tread, The sense that knows not the sound of the deep day's tune Receive the God, be it love that he brings or dread. The naked noon is upon me: the fierce dumb spell, The fearful charm of the strong sun's imminent might, Unmerciful, steadfast, deeper than seas that swell, Pervades, invades, appals me with loveless light, With harsher awe than breathes in the breath of night. Have mercy, God who art all! For I know thee well, How sharp is thine eye to lighten, thine hand to smite. The whole wood feels thee, the whole air fears thee: but fear So deep, so dim, so sacred, is wellnigh sweet. For the light that hangs and broods on the woodlands here, Intense, invasive, intolerant, imperious, and meet To lighten the works of thine hands and the ways of thy feet, Is hot with the fire of the breath of thy life, and dear As hope that shrivels or shrinks not for frost or heat. Thee, thee the supreme dim godhead, approved afar, Perceived of the soul and conceived of the sense of man, We scarce dare love, and we dare not fear: the star We call the sun, that lit us when life began To brood on the world that is thine by his grace for a span, Conceals and reveals in the semblance of things that are Thine immanent presence, the pulse of thy heart's life, Pan. The fierce mid noon that wakens and warms the snake Conceals thy mercy, reveals thy wrath: and again The dew-bright hour that assuages the twilight brake Conceals thy wrath and reveals thy mercy: then Thou art fearful only for evil souls of men That feel with nightfall the serpent within them wake, And hate the holy darkness on glade and glen. Yea, then we know not and dream not if ill things be, Or if aught of the work of the wrong of the world be thine. We hear not the footfall of terror that treads the sea, We hear not the moan of winds that assail the pine: We see not if shipwreck reign in the storm's dim shrine; If death do service and doom bear witness to thee We see not,—know not if blood for thy lips be wine. But in all things evil and fearful that fear may scan, As in all things good, as in all things fair that fall, We know thee present and latent, the lord of man; In the murmuring of doves, in the clamouring of winds that call And wolves that howl for their prey; in the midnight's pall, In the naked and nymph-like feet of the dawn, O Pan, And in each life living, O thou the God who art all. Smiling and singing, wailing and wringing of hands, Laughing and weeping, watching and sleeping, still Proclaim but and prove but thee, as the shifted sands Speak forth and show but the strength of the sea's wild will That sifts and grinds them as grain in the stormwind's mill. In thee is the doom that falls and the doom that stands: The tempests utter thy word, and the stars fulfil. Where Etna shudders with passion and pain volcanic That rend her heart as with anguish that rends a man's, Where Typho labours, and finds not his thews Titanic, In breathless torment that ever the flame's breath fans, Men felt and feared thee of old, whose pastoral clans Were given to the charge of thy keeping; and soundless panic Held fast the woodland whose depths and whose heights were Pan's. And here, though fear be less than delight, and awe Be one with desire and with worship of earth and thee, So mild seems now thy secret and speechless law, So fair and fearless and faithful and godlike she, So soft the spell of thy whisper on stream and sea, Yet man should fear lest he see what of old men saw And withered: yet shall I quail if thy breath smite me. Lord God of life and of light and of all things fair, Lord God of ravin and ruin and all things dim, Death seals up life, and darkness the sunbright air, And the stars that watch blind earth in the deep night swim Laugh, saying, “What God is your God, that ye call on him? What is man, that the God who is guide of our way should care If day for a man be golden, or night be grim?” But thou, dost thou hear? Stars too but abide for a span, Gods too but endure for a season; but thou, if thou be God, more than shadows conceived and adored of man, Kind Gods and fierce, that bound him or made him free, The skies that scorn us are less in thy sight than we, Whose souls have strength to conceive and perceive thee, Pan, With sense more subtle than senses that hear and see. Yet may not it say, though it seek thee and think to find One soul of sense in the fire and the frost-bound clod, What heart is this, what spirit alive or blind, That moves thee: only we know that the ways we trod We tread, with hands unguided, with feet unshod, With eyes unlightened; and yet, if with steadfast mind, Perchance may we find thee and know thee at last for God. Yet then should God be dark as the dawn is bright, And bright as the night is dark on the world—no more. Light slays not darkness, and darkness absorbs not light; And the labour of evil and good from the years of yore Is even as the labour of waves on a sunless shore. And he who is first and last, who is depth and height, Keeps silence now, as the sun when the woods wax hoar. The dark dumb godhead innate in the fair world's life Imbues the rapture of dawn and of noon with dread, Infects the peace of the star-shod night with strife, Informs with terror the sorrow that guards the dead. No service of bended knee or of humbled head May soothe or subdue the God who has change to wife: And life with death is as morning with evening wed. And yet, if the light and the life in the light that here Seem soft and splendid and fervid as sleep may seem Be more than the shine of a smile or the flash of a tear, Sleep, change, and death are less than a spell-struck dream, And fear than the fall of a leaf on a starlit stream. And yet, if the hope that hath said it absorb not fear, What helps it man that the stars and the waters gleam? What helps it man, that the noon be indeed intense, The night be indeed worth worship? Fear and pain Were lords and masters yet of the secret sense, Which now dares deem not that light is as darkness, fain Though dark dreams be to declare it, crying in vain. For whence, thou God of the light and the darkness, whence Dawns now this vision that bids not the sunbeams wane? What light, what shadow, diviner than dawn or night, Draws near, makes pause, and again—or I dream—draws near? More soft than shadow, more strong than the strong sun's light, More pure than moonbeams—yea, but the rays run sheer As fire from the sun through the dusk of the pinewood, clear And constant; yea, but the shadow itself is bright That the light clothes round with love that is one with fear. Above and behind it the noon and the woodland lie, Terrible, radiant with mystery, superb and subdued, Triumphant in silence; and hardly the sacred sky Seems free from the tyrannous weight of the dumb fierce mood Which rules as with fire and invasion of beams that brood The breathless rapture of earth till its hour pass by And leave her spirit released and her peace renewed. I sleep not: never in sleep has a man beholden This. From the shadow that trembles and yearns with light Suppressed and elate and reluctant—obscure and golden As water kindled with presage of dawn or night— A form, a face, a wonder to sense and sight, Grows great as the moon through the month; and her eyes embolden Fear, till it change to desire, and desire to delight. I sleep not: sleep would die of a dream so strange; A dream so sweet would die as a rainbow dies, As a sunbow laughs and is lost on the waves that range And reck not of light that flickers or spray that flies. But the sun withdraws not, the woodland shrinks not or sighs, No sweet thing sickens with sense or with fear of change; Light wounds not, darkness blinds not, my steadfast eyes. Only the soul in my sense that receives the soul Whence now my spirit is kindled with breathless bliss Knows well if the light that wounds it with love makes whole, If hopes that carol be louder than fears that hiss, If truth be spoken of flowers and of waves that kiss, Of clouds and stars that contend for a sunbright goal. And yet may I dream that I dream not indeed of this? An earth-born dreamer, constrained by the bonds of birth, Held fast by the flesh, compelled by his veins that beat And kindle to rapture or wrath, to desire or to mirth, May hear not surely the fall of immortal feet, May feel not surely if heaven upon earth be sweet; And here is my sense fulfilled of the joys of earth, Light, silence, bloom, shade, murmur of leaves that meet. Bloom, fervour, and perfume of grasses and flowers aglow, Breathe and brighten about me: the darkness gleams, The sweet light shivers and laughs on the slopes below, Made soft by leaves that lighten and change like dreams; The silence thrills with the whisper of secret streams That well from the heart of the woodland: these I know: Earth bore them, heaven sustained them with showers and beams. I lean my face to the heather, and drink the sun Whose flame-lit odour satiates the flowers: mine eyes Close, and the goal of delight and of life is one: No more I crave of earth or her kindred skies. No more? But the joy that springs from them smiles and flies: The sweet work wrought of them surely, the good work done, If the mind and the face of the season be loveless, dies. Thee, therefore, thee would I come to, cleave to, cling, If haply thy heart be kind and thy gifts be good, Unknown sweet spirit, whose vesture is soft in spring, In summer splendid, in autumn pale as the wood That shudders and wanes and shrinks as a shamed thing should, In winter bright as the mail of a war-worn king Who stands where foes fled far from the face of him stood. My spirit or thine is it, breath of thy life or of mine, Which fills my sense with a rapture that casts out fear? Pan's dim frown wanes, and his wild eyes brighten as thine, Transformed as night or as day by the kindling year. Earth-born, or mine eye were withered that sees, mine ear That hears were stricken to death by the sense divine, Earth-born I know thee: but heaven is about me here. The terror that whispers in darkness and flames in light, The doubt that speaks in the silence of earth and sea, The sense, more fearful at noon than in midmost night, Of wrath scarce hushed and of imminent ill to be, Where are they? Heaven is as earth, and as heaven to me Earth: for the shadows that sundered them here take flight; And nought is all, as am I, but a dream of thee. ON THE SOUTH COAST To Theodore Watts Hills and valleys where April rallies his radiant squadron of flowers and birds, Steep strange beaches and lustrous reaches of fluctuant sea that the land engirds, Fields and downs that the sunrise crowns with life diviner than lives in words, Day by day of resurgent May salute the sun with sublime acclaim, Change and brighten with hours that lighten and darken, girdled with cloud or flame; Earth's fair face in alternate grace beams, blooms, and lowers, and is yet the same. Twice each day the divine sea's play makes glad with glory that comes and goes Field and street that her waves keep sweet, when past the bounds of their old repose, Fast and fierce in renewed reverse, the foam-flecked estuary ebbs and flows. Broad and bold through the stays of old staked fast with trunks of the wildwood tree, Up from shoreward, impelled far forward, by marsh and meadow, by lawn and lea, Inland still at her own wild will swells, rolls, and revels the surging sea. Strong as time, and as faith sublime,—clothed round with shadows of hopes and fears, Nights and morrows, and joys and sorrows, alive with passion of prayers and tears,— Stands the shrine that has seen decline eight hundred waxing and waning years. Tower set square to the storms of air and change of season that glooms and glows, Wall and roof of it tempest-proof, and equal ever to suns and snows, Bright with riches of radiant niches and pillars smooth as a straight stem grows. Aisle and nave that the whelming wave of time has whelmed not or touched or neared, Arch and vault without stain or fault, by hands of craftsmen we know not reared, Time beheld them, and time was quelled; and change passed by them as one that feared. Time that flies as a dream, and dies as dreams that die with the sleep they feed, Here alone in a garb of stone incarnate stands as a god indeed, Stern and fair, and of strength to bear all burdens mortal to man's frail seed. Men and years are as leaves or tears that storm or sorrow is fain to shed: These go by as the winds that sigh, and none takes note of them quick or dead: Time, whose breath is their birth and death, folds here his pinions, and bows his head. Still the sun that beheld begun the work wrought here of unwearied hands Sees, as then, though the Red King's men held ruthless rule over lawless lands, Stand their massive design, impassive, pure and proud as a virgin stands. Statelier still as the years fulfil their count, subserving her sacred state, Grows the hoary grey church whose story silence utters and age makes great: Statelier seems it than shines in dreams the face unveiled of unvanquished fate. Fate, more high than the star-shown sky, more deep than waters unsounded, shines Keen and far as the final star on souls that seek not for charms or signs; Yet more bright is the love-shown light of men's hands lighted in songs or shrines. Love and trust that the grave's deep dust can soil not, neither may fear put out, Witness yet that their record set stands fast, though years be as hosts in rout, Spent and slain; but the signs remain that beat back darkness and cast forth doubt. Men that wrought by the grace of thought and toil things goodlier than praise dare trace, Fair as all that the world may call most fair, save only the sea's own face, Shrines or songs that the world's change wrongs not, live by grace of their own gift's grace. Dead, their names that the night reclaims—alive, their works that the day relumes— Sink and stand, as in stone and sand engraven: none may behold their tombs: Nights and days shall record their praise while here this flower of their grafting blooms. Flower more fair than the sun-thrilled air bids laugh and lighten and wax and rise, Fruit more bright than the fervent light sustains with strength from the kindled skies, Flower and fruit that the deathless root of man's love rears though the man's name dies. Stately stands it, the work of hands unknown of: statelier, afar and near, Rise around it the heights that bound our landward gaze from the seaboard here; Downs that swerve and aspire, in curve and change of heights that the dawn holds dear. Dawn falls fair on the grey walls there confronting dawn, on the low green lea, Lone and sweet as for fairies' feet held sacred, silent and strange and free, Wild and wet with its rills; but yet more fair falls dawn on the fairer sea. Eastward, round by the high green bound of hills that fold the remote fields in, Strive and shine on the low sea-line fleet waves and beams when the days begin; Westward glow, when the days burn low, the sun that yields and the stars that win. Rose-red eve on the seas that heave sinks fair as dawn when the first ray peers; Winds are glancing from sunbright Lancing to Shoreham, crowned with the grace of years; Shoreham, clad with the sunset, glad and grave with glory that death reveres. Death, more proud than the kings' heads bowed before him, stronger than all things, bows Here his head: as if death were dead, and kingship plucked from his crownless brows, Life hath here such a face of cheer as change appals not and time avows. Skies fulfilled with the sundown, stilled and splendid, spread as a flower that spreads, Pave with rarer device and fairer than heaven's the luminous oyster-beds, Grass-embanked, and in square plots ranked, inlaid with gems that the sundown sheds. Squares more bright and with lovelier light than heaven that kindled it shines with shine Warm and soft as the dome aloft, but heavenlier yet than the sun's own shrine: Heaven is high, but the water-sky lit here seems deeper and more divine. Flowers on flowers, that the whole world's bowers may show not, here may the sunset show, Lightly graven in the waters paven with ghostly gold by the clouds aglow: Bright as love is the vault above, but lovelier lightens the wave below. Rosy grey, or as fiery spray full-plumed, or greener than emerald, gleams Plot by plot as the skies allot for each its glory, divine as dreams Lit with fire of appeased desire which sounds the secret of all that seems; Dreams that show what we fain would know, and know not save by the grace of sleep, Sleep whose hands have removed the bands that eyes long waking and fain to weep Feel fast bound on them—light around them strange, and darkness above them steep. Yet no vision that heals division of love from love, and renews awhile Life and breath in the lips where death has quenched the spirit of speech and smile, Shows on earth, or in heaven's mid mirth, where no fears enter or doubts defile, Aught more fair than the radiant air and water here by the twilight wed, Here made one by the waning sun whose last love quickens to rosebright red Half the crown of the soft high down that rears to northward its wood-girt head. There, when day is at height of sway, men's eyes who stand, as we oft have stood, High where towers with its world of flowers the golden spinny that flanks the wood, See before and around them shore and seaboard glad as their gifts are good. Higher and higher to the north aspire the green smooth-swelling unending downs; East and west on the brave earth's breast glow girdle-jewels of gleaming towns; Southward shining, the lands declining subside in peace that the sea's light crowns. Westward wide in its fruitful pride the plain lies lordly with plenteous grace; Fair as dawn's when the fields and lawns desire her glitters the glad land's face: Eastward yet is the sole sign set of elder days and a lordlier race. Down beneath us afar, where seethe in wilder weather the tides aflow, Hurled up hither and drawn down thither in quest of rest that they may not know, Still as dew on a flower the blue broad stream now sleeps in the fields below. Mild and bland in the fair green land it smiles, and takes to its heart the sky; Scarce the meads and the fens, the reeds and grasses, still as they stand or lie, Wear the palm of a statelier calm than rests on waters that pass them by. Yet shall these, when the winds and seas of equal days and coequal nights Rage, rejoice, and uplift a voice whose sound is even as a sword that smites, Felt and heard as a doomsman's word from seaward reaches to landward heights, Lift their heart up, and take their part of triumph, swollen and strong with rage, Rage elate with desire and great with pride that tempest and storm assuage; So their chime in the ear of time has rung from age to rekindled age. Fair and dear is the land's face here, and fair man's work as a man's may be: Dear and fair as the sunbright air is here the record that speaks him free; Free by birth of a sacred earth, and regent ever of all the sea. AN AUTUMN VISION October 31, 1889 ??????? ???????? ???? I Is it Midsummer here in the heavens that illumine October on earth? Can the year, when his heart is fulfilled with desire of the days of his mirth, Redeem them, recall, or remember? For a memory recalling the rapture of earth, and redeeming the sky, Shines down from the heights to the depths: will the watchword of dawn be July When to-morrow acclaims November? The stern salutation of sorrow to death or repentance to shame Was all that the season was wont to accord her of grace or acclaim; No lightnings of love and of laughter. But here, in the laugh of the loud west wind from around and above, In the flash of the waters beneath him, what sound or what light but of love Rings round him or leaps forth after? II Wind beloved of earth and sky and sea beyond all winds that blow, Wind whose might in fight was England's on her mightiest warrior day, South-west wind, whose breath for her was life, and fire to scourge her foe, Steel to smite and death to drive him down an unreturning way, Well-beloved and welcome, sounding all the clarions of the sky, Rolling all the marshalled waters toward the charge that storms the shore, We receive, acclaim, salute thee, we who live and dream and die, As the mightiest mouth of song that ever spake acclaimed of yore. We that live as they that perish praise thee, lord of cloud and wave, Wind of winds, clothed on with darkness whence as lightning light comes forth, We that know thee strong to guard and smite, to scatter and to save, We to whom the south-west wind is dear as Athens held the north. He for her waged war as thou for us against all powers defiant, Fleets full-fraught with storm from Persia, laden deep with death from Spain: Thee the giant god of song and battle hailed as god and giant, Yet not his but ours the land is whence thy praise should ring and rain; Rain as rapture shed from song, and ring as trumpets blown for battle, Sound and sing before thee, loud and glad as leaps and sinks the sea: Yea, the sea's white steeds are curbed and spurred of thee, and pent as cattle, Yet they laugh with love and pride to live, subdued not save of thee. Ears that hear thee hear in heaven the sound of widening wings gigantic, Eyes that see the cloud-lift westward see thy darkening brows divine; Wings whose measure is the limit of the limitless Atlantic, Brows that bend, and bid the sovereign sea submit her soul to thine. III Twelve days since is it—twelve days gone, Lord of storm, that a storm-bow shone Higher than sweeps thy sublime dark wing, Fair as dawn is and sweet like spring? Never dawn in the deep wide east Spread so splendid and strange a feast, Whence the soul as it drank and fed Felt such rapture of wonder shed. Never spring in the wild wood's heart Felt such flowers at her footfall start, Born of earth, as arose on sight Born of heaven and of storm and light. Stern and sullen, the grey grim sea Swelled and strove as in toils, though free, Free as heaven, and as heaven sublime, Clear as heaven of the toils of time. IV Suddenly, sheer from the heights to the depths of the sky and the sea, Sprang from the darkness alive as a vision of life to be Glory triune and transcendent of colour afar and afire, Arching and darkening the darkness with light as of dream or desire. Heaven, in the depth of its height, shone wistful and wan from above: Earth from beneath, and the sea, shone stricken and breathless with love. As a shadow may shine, so shone they; as ghosts of the viewless blest, That sleep hath sight of alive in a rapture of sunbright rest, The green earth glowed and the grey sky gleamed for a wondrous while; And the storm's full frown was crossed by the light of its own deep smile. As the darkness of thought and of passion is touched by the light that gives Life deathless as love from the depth of a spirit that sees and lives, From the soul of a seer and a singer, wherein as a scroll unfurled Lies open the scripture of light and of darkness, the word of the world, So, shapeless and measureless, lurid as anguish and haggard as crime, Pale as the front of oblivion and dark as the heart of time, The wild wan heaven at its height was assailed and subdued and made More fair than the skies that know not of storm and endure not shade. The grim sea-swell, grey, sleepless, and sad as a soul estranged, Shone, smiled, took heart, and was glad of its wrath: and the world's face changed. V Up from moorlands northward gleaming Even to heaven's transcendent height, Clothed with massive cloud, and seeming All one fortress reared of night, Down to where the deep sea, dreaming Angry dreams, lay dark and white, White as death and dark as fate, Heaving with the strong wind's weight, Sad with stormy pride of state, One full rainbow shone elate. Up from inmost memory's dwelling Where the light of life abides, Where the past finds tongue, foretelling Time that comes and grace that guides, Power that saves and sways, compelling Souls that ebb and flow like tides, Shone or seemed to shine and swim Through the cloud-surf great and grim, Thought's live surge, the soul of him By whose light the sun looks dim. In what synod were they sitting, All the gods and lords of time, Whence they watched as fen-fires flitting Years and names of men sublime, When their counsels found it fitting One should stand where none might climb— None of man begotten, none Born of men beneath the sun Till the race of time be run, Save this heaven-enfranchised one? With what rapture of creation Was the soul supernal thrilled, With what pride of adoration Was the world's heart fired and filled, Heaved in heavenward exaltation Higher than hopes or dreams might build, Grave with awe not known while he Was not, mad with glorious glee As the sun-saluted sea, When his hour bade Shakespeare be? VI There, clear as night beholds her crowning seven, The sea beheld his likeness set in heaven. The shadow of his spirit full in sight Shone: for the shadow of that soul is light. Nor heaven alone bore witness: earth avowed Him present, and acclaimed of storm aloud. From the arching sky to the ageless hills and sea The whole world, visible, audible, was he: Each part of all that wove that wondrous whole The raiment of the presence of his soul. The sun that smote and kissed the dark to death Spake, smiled, and strove, like song's triumphant breath; The soundless cloud whose thunderous heart was dumb Swelled, lowered, and shrank to feel its conqueror come. Yet high from heaven its empire vast and vain Frowned, and renounced not night's reluctant reign. The serpentine swift sounds and shapes wherein The stainless sea mocks earth and death and sin, Crawls dark as craft, or flashes keen as hate, Subdued and insubmissive, strong like fate And weak like man, bore wrathful witness yet That storms and sins are more than suns that set; That evil everlasting, girt for strife Eternal, wars with hope as death with life. The dark sharp shifting wind that bade the waves Falter, lose heart, bow down like foes made slaves, And waxed within more bitter as they bowed, Baffling the sea, swallowing the sun with cloud, Devouring fast as fire on earth devours And hungering hard as frost that feeds on flowers, Clothed round with fog that reeked as fume from hell, And darkening with its miscreative spell Light, glad and keen and splendid as the sword Whose heft had known Othello's hand its lord, Spake all the soul that hell drew back to greet And felt its fire shrink shuddering from his feet. Far off the darkness darkened, and recoiled, And neared again, and triumphed: and the coiled Colourless cloud and sea discoloured grew Conscious of horror huge as heaven, and knew Where Goneril's soul made chill and foul the mist, And all the leprous life in Regan hissed. Fierce homeless ghosts, rejected of the pit, From hell to hell of storm fear watched them flit. About them and before, the dull grey gloom Shuddered, and heaven seemed hateful as the tomb That shrinks from resurrection; and from out That sullen hell which girt their shades about The nether soul that lurks and lowers within Man, made of dust and fire and shame and sin, Breathed: all the cloud that felt it breathe and blight Was blue as plague or black as thunderous night. Elect of hell, the children of his hate Thronged, as to storm sweet heaven's triumphal gate. The terror of his giving rose and shone Imminent: life had put its likeness on. But higher than all its horrent height of shade Shone sovereign, seen by light itself had made, Above the woes of all the world, above Life, sin, and death, his myriad-minded love. From landward heights whereon the radiance leant Full-fraught from heaven, intense and imminent, To depths wherein the seething strengths of cloud Scarce matched the wrath of waves whereon they bowed, From homeborn pride and kindling love of home To the outer skies and seas of fire and foam, From splendour soft as dew that sundawn thrills To gloom that shudders round the world it fills, From midnights murmuring round Titania's ear To midnights maddening round the rage of Lear, The wonder woven of storm and sun became One with the light that lightens from his name. The music moving on the sea that felt The storm-wind even as snows of springtide melt Was blithe as Ariel's hand or voice might make And bid all grief die gladly for its sake. And there the soul alive in ear and eye That watched the wonders of an hour pass by Saw brighter than all stars that heaven inspheres The silent splendour of Cordelia's tears, Felt in the whispers of the quickening wind The radiance of the laugh of Rosalind, And heard, in sounds that melt the souls of men With love of love, the tune of Imogen. VII For the strong north-east is not strong to subdue and to slay the divine south-west, And the darkness is less than the light that it darkens, and dies in reluctant rest. It hovers and hangs on the labouring and trembling ascent of the dawn from the deep, Till the sun's eye quicken the world and the waters, and smite it again into sleep. Night, holy and starry, the fostress of souls, with the fragrance of heaven in her breath, Subdues with the sense of her godhead the forces and mysteries of sorrow and death. Eternal as dawn's is the comfort she gives: but the mist that beleaguers and slays Comes, passes, and is not: the strength of it withers, appalled or assuaged by the day's. Faith, haggard as Fear that had borne her, and dark as the sire that begat her, Despair, Held rule on the soul of the world and the song of it saddening through ages that were; Dim centuries that darkened and brightened and darkened again, and the soul of their song Was great as their grief, and sublime as their suffering, and strong as their sorrows were strong. It knew not, it saw not, but shadows triune, and evoked by the strength of their spell Dark hell, and the mountain of anguish, and heaven that was hollower and harder than hell. These are not: the womb of the darkness that bare them rejects them, and knows them no more: Thought, fettered in misery and iron, revives in the light that it lived in of yore. For the soul that is wisdom and freedom, the spirit of England redeemed from her past, Speaks life through the lips of the master and lord of her children, the first and the last. Thought, touched by his hand and redeemed by his breath, sees, hears, and accepts from above The limitless lightnings of vision and passion, the measureless music of love. A SWIMMER'S DREAM November 4, 1889 Somno mollior unda I Dawn is dim on the dark soft water, Soft and passionate, dark and sweet. Love's own self was the deep sea's daughter, Fair and flawless from face to feet, Hailed of all when the world was golden, Loved of lovers whose names beholden Thrill men's eyes as with light of olden Days more glad than their flight was fleet. So they sang: but for men that love her, Souls that hear not her word in vain, Earth beside her and heaven above her Seem but shadows that wax and wane. Softer than sleep's are the sea's caresses, Kinder than love's that betrays and blesses, Blither than spring's when her flowerful tresses Shake forth sunlight and shine with rain. All the strength of the waves that perish Swells beneath me and laughs and sighs, Sighs for love of the life they cherish, Laughs to know that it lives and dies, Dies for joy of its life, and lives Thrilled with joy that its brief death gives— Death whose laugh or whose breath forgives Change that bids it subside and rise. II Hard and heavy, remote but nearing, Sunless hangs the severe sky's weight, Cloud on cloud, though the wind be veering Heaped on high to the sundawn's gate. Dawn and even and noon are one, Veiled with vapour and void of sun; Nought in sight or in fancied hearing Now less mighty than time or fate. The grey sky gleams and the grey seas glimmer, Pale and sweet as a dream's delight, As a dream's where darkness and light seem dimmer, Touched by dawn or subdued by night. The dark wind, stern and sublime and sad, Swings the rollers to westward, clad With lustrous shadow that lures the swimmer, Lures and lulls him with dreams of light. Light, and sleep, and delight, and wonder, Change, and rest, and a charm of cloud, Fill the world of the skies whereunder Heaves and quivers and pants aloud All the world of the waters, hoary Now, but clothed with its own live glory, That mates the lightning and mocks the thunder With light more living and word more proud. III Far off westward, whither sets the sounding strife, Strife more sweet than peace, of shoreless waves whose glee Scorns the shore and loves the wind that leaves them free, Strange as sleep and pale as death and fair as life, Shifts the moonlight-coloured sunshine on the sea. Toward the sunset's goal the sunless waters crowd, Fast as autumn days toward winter: yet it seems Here that autumn wanes not, here that woods and streams Lose not heart and change not likeness, chilled and bowed, Warped and wrinkled: here the days are fair as dreams. IV O russet-robed November, What ails thee so to smile? Chill August, pale September, Endured a woful while, And fell as falls an ember From forth a flameless pile: But golden-girt November Bids all she looks on smile. The lustrous foliage, waning As wanes the morning moon, Here falling, here refraining, Outbraves the pride of June With statelier semblance, feigning No fear lest death be soon: As though the woods thus waning Should wax to meet the moon. As though, when fields lie stricken By grey December's breath, These lordlier growths that sicken And die for fear of death Should feel the sense requicken That hears what springtide saith And thrills for love, spring-stricken And pierced with April's breath. The keen white-winged north-easter That stings and spurs thy sea Doth yet but feed and feast her With glowing sense of glee: Calm chained her, storm released her, And storm's glad voice was he: South-wester or north-easter, Thy winds rejoice the sea. V A dream, a dream is it all—the season, The sky, the water, the wind, the shore? A day-born dream of divine unreason, A marvel moulded of sleep—no more? For the cloudlike wave that my limbs while cleaving Feel as in slumber beneath them heaving Soothes the sense as to slumber, leaving Sense of nought that was known of yore. A purer passion, a lordlier leisure, A peace more happy than lives on land, Fulfils with pulse of diviner pleasure The dreaming head and the steering hand. I lean my cheek to the cold grey pillow, The deep soft swell of the full broad billow, And close mine eyes for delight past measure, And wish the wheel of the world would stand. The wild-winged hour that we fain would capture Falls as from heaven that its light feet clomb, So brief, so soft, and so full the rapture Was felt that soothed me with sense of home. To sleep, to swim, and to dream, for ever— Such joy the vision of man saw never; For here too soon will a dark day sever The sea-bird's wing from the sea-wave's foam. A dream, and more than a dream, and dimmer At once and brighter than dreams that flee, The moment's joy of the seaward swimmer Abides, remembered as truth may be. Not all the joy and not all the glory Must fade as leaves when the woods wax hoary; For there the downs and the sea-banks glimmer, And here to south of them swells the sea. GRACE DARLING Take, O star of all our seas, from not an alien hand, Homage paid of song bowed down before thy glory's face, Thou the living light of all our lovely stormy strand, Thou the brave north-country's very glory of glories, Grace. Loud and dark about the lighthouse rings and glares the night; Glares with foam-lit gloom and darkling fire of storm and spray, Rings with roar of winds in chase and rage of waves in flight, Howls and hisses as with mouths of snakes and wolves at bay. Scarce the cliffs of the islets, scarce the walls of Joyous Gard, Flash to sight between the deadlier lightnings of the sea: Storm is lord and master of a midnight evil-starred, Nor may sight or fear discern what evil stars may be. Dark as death and white as snow the sea-swell scowls and shines, Heaves and yearns and pants for prey, from ravening lip to lip, Strong in rage of rapturous anguish, lines on hurtling lines, Ranks on charging ranks, that break and rend the battling ship. All the night is mad and murderous: who shall front the night? Not the prow that labours, helpless as a storm-blown leaf, Where the rocks and waters, darkling depth and beetling height, Rage with wave on shattering wave and thundering reef on reef. Death is fallen upon the prisoners there of darkness, bound Like as thralls with links of iron fast in bonds of doom; How shall any way to break the bands of death be found, Any hand avail to pluck them from that raging tomb? All the night is great with child of death: no stars above Show them hope in heaven, no lights from shores ward help on earth. Is there help or hope to seaward, is there help in love, Hope in pity, where the ravening hounds of storm make mirth? Where the light but shows the naked eyeless face of Death Nearer, laughing dumb and grim across the loud live storm? Not in human heart or hand or speech of human breath, Surely, nor in saviours found of mortal face or form. Yet below the light, between the reefs, a skiff shot out Seems a sea-bird fain to breast and brave the strait fierce pass Whence the channelled roar of waters driven in raging rout, Pent and pressed and maddened, speaks their monstrous might and mass. Thunder heaves and howls about them, lightning leaps and flashes, Hard at hand, not high in heaven, but close between the walls Heaped and hollowed of the storms of old, whence reels and crashes All the rage of all the unbaffled wave that breaks and falls. Who shall thwart the madness and the gladness of it, laden Full with heavy fate, and joyous as the birds that whirl? Nought in heaven or earth, if not one mortal-moulded maiden, Nought if not the soul that glorifies a northland girl. Not the rocks that break may baffle, not the reefs that thwart Stay the ravenous rapture of the waves that crowd and leap; Scarce their flashing laughter shows the hunger of their heart, Scarce their lion-throated roar the wrath at heart they keep. Child and man and woman in the grasp of death clenched fast Tremble, clothed with darkness round about, and scarce draw breath, Scarce lift eyes up toward the light that saves not, scarce may cast Thought or prayer up, caught and trammelled in the snare of death. Not as sea-mews cling and laugh or sun their plumes and sleep Cling and cower the wild night's waifs of shipwreck, blind with fear, Where the fierce reef scarce yields foothold that a bird might keep, And the clamorous darkness deadens eye and deafens ear. Yet beyond their helpless hearing, out of hopeless sight, Saviours, armed and girt upon with strength of heart, fare forth, Sire and daughter, hand on oar and face against the night, Maid and man whose names are beacons ever to the North. Nearer now; but all the madness of the storming surf Hounds and roars them back; but roars and hounds them back in vain: As a pleasure-skiff may graze the lake-embanking turf, So the boat that bears them grates the rock where-toward they strain. Dawn as fierce and haggard as the face of night scarce guides Toward the cries that rent and clove the darkness, crying for aid, Hours on hours, across the engorged reluctance of the tides, Sire and daughter, high-souled man and mightier-hearted maid. Not the bravest land that ever breasted war's grim sea, Hurled her foes back harried on the lowlands whence they came, Held her own and smote her smiters down, while such durst be, Shining northward, shining southward, as the aurorean flame, Not our mother, not Northumberland, brought ever forth, Though no southern shore may match the sons that kiss her mouth, Children worthier all the birthright given of the ardent north Where the fire of hearts outburns the suns that fire the south. Even such fire was this that lit them, not from lowering skies Where the darkling dawn flagged, stricken in the sun's own shrine, Down the gulf of storm subsiding, till their earnest eyes Find the relics of the ravening night that spared but nine. Life by life the man redeems them, head by storm-worn head, While the girl's hand stays the boat whereof the waves are fain: Ah, but woe for one, the mother clasping fast her dead! Happier, had the surges slain her with her children slain. Back they bear, and bring between them safe the woful nine, Where above the ravenous Hawkers fixed at watch for prey Storm and calm behold the Longstone's towering signal shine Now as when that labouring night brought forth a shuddering day. Now as then, though like the hounds of storm against her snarling All the clamorous years between us storm down many a fame, As our sires beheld before us we behold Grace Darling Crowned and throned our queen, and as they hailed we hail her name. Nay, not ours alone, her kinsfolk born, though chiefliest ours, East and west and south acclaim her queen of England's maids, Star more sweet than all their stars and flower than all their flowers, Higher in heaven and earth than star than sets or flower that fades. How should land or sea that nurtured her forget, or love Hold not fast her fame for us while aught is borne in mind? Land and sea beneath us, sun and moon and stars above, Bear the bright soul witness, seen of all but souls born blind. Stars and moon and sun may wax and wane, subside and rise, Age on age as flake on flake of showering snows be shed: Not till earth be sunless, not till death strike blind the skies, May the deathless love that waits on deathless deeds be dead. Years on years have withered since beside the hearth once thine I, too young to have seen thee, touched thy father's hallowed hand: Thee and him shall all men see for ever, stars that shine While the sea that spared thee girds and glorifies the land. LOCH TORRIDON To E. H. The dawn of night more fair than morning rose, Stars hurrying forth on stars, as snows on snows Haste when the wind and winter bid them speed. Vague miles of moorland road behind us lay Scarce traversed ere the day Sank, and the sun forsook us at our need, Belated. Where we thought to have rested, rest Was none; for soft Maree's dim quivering breast, Bound round with gracious inland girth of green And fearless of the wild wave-wandering West, Shone shelterless for strangers; and unseen The goal before us lay Of all our blithe and strange and strenuous day. For when the northering road faced westward—when The dark sharp sudden gorge dropped seaward—then, Beneath the stars, between the steeps, the track We followed, lighted not of moon or sun, And plunging whither none Might guess, while heaven and earth were hoar and black, Seemed even the dim still pass whence none turns back: And through the twilight leftward of the way, And down the dark, with many a laugh and leap, The light blithe hill-streams shone from scaur to steep In glittering pride of play; And ever while the night grew great and deep We felt but saw not what the hills would keep Sacred awhile from sense of moon or star; And full and far Beneath us, sweet and strange as heaven may be, The sea. The very sea: no moutain-moulded lake Whose fluctuant shapeliness is fain to take Shape from the steadfast shore that rules it round, And only from the storms a casual sound: The sea, that harbours in her heart sublime The supreme heart of music deep as time, And in her spirit strong The spirit of all imaginable song. Not a whisper or lisp from the waters: the skies were not silenter. Peace Was between them; a passionless rapture of respite as soft as release. Not a sound, but a sense that possessed and pervaded with patient delight The soul and the body, clothed round with the comfort of limitless night. Night infinite, living, adorable, loved of the land and the sea: Night, mother of mercies, who saith to the spirits in prison, Be free. And softer than dewfall, and kindlier than starlight, and keener than wine, Came round us the fragrance of waters, the life of the breath of the brine. We saw not, we heard not, the face or the voice of the waters: we knew By the darkling delight of the wind as the sense of the sea in it grew, By the pulse of the darkness about us enkindled and quickened, that here, Unseen and unheard of us, surely the goal we had faith in was near. A silence diviner than music, a darkness diviner than light, Fulfilled as from heaven with a measureless comfort the measure of night. But never a roof for shelter And never a sign for guide Rose doubtful or visible: only And hardly and gladly we heard The soft waves whisper and welter, Subdued, and allured to subside, By the mild night's magic: the lonely Sweet silence was soothed, not stirred, By the noiseless noise of the gleaming Glad ripples, that played and sighed, Kissed, laughed, recoiled, and relented, Whispered, flickered, and fled, No season was this for dreaming How oft, with a stormier tide, Had the wrath of the winds been vented On sons of the tribes long dead: The tribes whom time, and the changes Of things, and the stress of doom, Have erased and effaced; forgotten As wrecks or weeds of the shore In sight of the stern hill-ranges That hardly may change their gloom When the fruits of the years wax rotten And the seed of them springs no more. For the dim strait footway dividing The waters that breathed below Led safe to the kindliest of shelters That ever awoke into light: And still in remembrance abiding Broods over the stars that glow And the water that eddies and welters The passionate peace of the night. All night long, in the world of sleep, Skies and waters were soft and deep: Shadow clothed them, and silence made Soundless music of dream and shade: All above us, the livelong night, Shadow, kindled with sense of light; All around us, the brief night long, Silence, laden with sense of song. Stars and mountains without, we knew, Watched and waited, the soft night through: All unseen, but divined and dear, Thrilled the touch of the sea's breath near: All unheard, but alive like sound, Throbbed the sense of the sea's life round: Round us, near us, in depth and height, Soft as darkness and keen as light. And the dawn leapt in at my casement: and there, as I rose, at my feet No waves of the landlocked waters, no lake submissive and sweet, Soft slave of the lordly seasons, whose breath may loose it or freeze; But to left and to right and ahead was the ripple whose pulse is the sea's. From the gorge we had travelled by starlight the sunrise, winged and aflame, Shone large on the live wide wavelets that shuddered with joy as it came; As it came and caressed and possessed them, till panting and laughing with light From mountain to mountain the water was kindled and stung to delight. And the grey gaunt heights that embraced and constrained and compelled it were glad, And the rampart of rock, stark naked, that thwarted and barred it, was clad With a stern grey splendour of sunrise: and scarce had I sprung to the sea When the dawn and the water were wedded, the hills and the sky set free. The chain of the night was broken: the waves that embraced me and smiled And flickered and fawned in the sunlight, alive, unafraid, undefiled, Were sweeter to swim in than air, though fulfilled with the mounting morn, Could be for the birds whose triumph rejoiced that a day was born. And a day was arisen indeed for us. Years and the changes of years Clothed round with their joys and their sorrows, and dead as their hopes and their fears, Lie noteless and nameless, unlit by remembrance or record of days Worth wonder or memory, or cursing or blessing, or passion or praise, Between us who live and forget not, but yearn with delight in it yet, And the day we forget not, and never may live and may think to forget. And the years that were kindlier and fairer, and kindled with pleasures as keen, Have eclipsed not with lights or with shadows the light on the face of it seen. For softly and surely, as nearer the boat that we gazed from drew, The face of the precipice opened and bade us as birds pass through, And the bark shot sheer to the sea through the strait of the sharp steep cleft, The portal that opens with imminent rampires to right and to left, Sublime as the sky they darken and strange as a spell-struck dream, On the world unconfined of the mountains, the reign of the sea supreme, The kingdom of westward waters, wherein when we swam we knew The waves that we clove were boundless, the wind on our brows that blew Had swept no land and no lake, and had warred not on tower or on tree, But came on us hard out of heaven, and alive with the soul of the sea. THE PALACE OF PAN Inscribed to my Mother September, all glorious with gold, as a king In the radiance of triumph attired, Outlightening the summer, outsweetening the spring, Broods wide on the woodlands with limitless wing, A presence of all men desired. Far eastward and westward the sun-coloured lands Smile warm as the light on them smiles; And statelier than temples upbuilded with hands, Tall column by column, the sanctuary stands Of the pine-forest's infinite aisles. Mute worship, too fervent for praise or for prayer, Possesses the spirit with peace, Fulfilled with the breath of the luminous air, The fragrance, the silence, the shadows as fair As the rays that recede or increase. Ridged pillars that redden aloft and aloof, With never a branch for a nest, Sustain the sublime indivisible roof, To the storm and the sun in his majesty proof, And awful as waters at rest. Man's hand hath not measured the height of them; thought May measure not, awe may not know; In its shadow the woofs of the woodland are wrought; As a bird is the sun in the toils of them caught, And the flakes of it scattered as snow. As the shreds of a plumage of gold on the ground The sun-flakes by multitudes lie, Shed loose as the petals of roses discrowned On the floors of the forest engilt and embrowned And reddened afar and anigh. Dim centuries with darkling inscrutable hands Have reared and secluded the shrine For gods that we know not, and kindled as brands On the altar the years that are dust, and their sands Time's glass has forgotten for sign. A temple whose transepts are measured by miles, Whose chancel has morning for priest, Whose floor-work the foot of no spoiler defiles, Whose musical silence no music beguiles, No festivals limit its feast. The noon's ministration, the night's and the dawn's, Conceals not, reveals not for man, On the slopes of the herbless and blossomless lawns, Some track of a nymph's or some trail of a faun's To the place of the slumber of Pan. Thought, kindled and quickened by worship and wonder To rapture too sacred for fear On the ways that unite or divide them in sunder, Alone may discern if about them or under Be token or trace of him here. With passionate awe that is deeper than panic The spirit subdued and unshaken Takes heed of the godhead terrene and Titanic Whose footfall is felt on the breach of volcanic Sharp steeps that their fire has forsaken. By a spell more serene than the dim necromantic Dead charms of the past and the night, Or the terror that lurked in the noon to make frantic Where Etna takes shape from the limbs of gigantic Dead gods disanointed of might, The spirit made one with the spirit whose breath Makes noon in the woodland sublime Abides as entranced in a presence that saith Things loftier than life and serener than death, Triumphant and silent as time. Pine Ridge: September 1893. A YEAR'S CAROLS JANUARY Hail, January, that bearest here On snowbright breasts the babe-faced year That weeps and trembles to be born. Hail, maid and mother, strong and bright, Hooded and cloaked and shod with white, Whose eyes are stars that match the morn. Thy forehead braves the storm's bent bow, Thy feet enkindle stars of snow. FEBRUARY Wan February with weeping cheer, Whose cold hand guides the youngling year Down misty roads of mire and rime, Before thy pale and fitful face The shrill wind shifts the clouds apace Through skies the morning scarce may climb. Thine eyes are thick with heavy tears, But lit with hopes that light the year's MARCH Hail, happy March, whose foot on earth Rings as the blast of martial mirth When trumpets fire men's hearts for fray. No race of wild things winged or finned May match the might that wings thy wind Through air and sea, through scud and spray. Strong joy and thou were powers twin-born Of tempest and the towering morn. APRIL Crowned April, king whose kiss bade earth Bring forth to time her lordliest birth When Shakespeare from thy lips drew breath And laughed to hold in one soft hand A spell that bade the world's wheel stand, And power on life, and power on death, With quiring suns and sunbright showers Praise him, the flower of all thy flowers. MAY Hail, May, whose bark puts forth full-sailed For summer; May, whom Chaucer hailed With all his happy might of heart, And gave thy rosebright daisy-tips Strange fragrance from his amorous lips That still thine own breath seems to part And sweeten till each word they say Is even a flower of flowering May. JUNE Strong June, superb, serene, elate With conscience of thy sovereign state Untouched of thunder, though the storm Scathe here and there thy shuddering skies And bid its lightning cross thine eyes With fire, thy golden hours inform Earth and the souls of men with life That brings forth peace from shining strife. JULY Hail, proud July, whose fervent mouth Bids even be morn and north be south By grace and gospel of thy word, Whence all the splendour of the sea Lies breathless with delight in thee And marvel at the music heard From the ardent silent lips of noon And midnight's rapturous plenilune. AUGUST Great August, lord of golden lands, Whose lordly joy through seas and strands And all the red-ripe heart of earth Strikes passion deep as life, and stills The folded vales and folding hills With gladness too divine for mirth, The gracious glories of thine eyes Make night a noon where darkness dies. SEPTEMBER Hail, kind September, friend whose grace Renews the bland year's bounteous face With largess given of corn and wine Through many a land that laughs with love Of thee and all the heaven above, More fruitful found than all save thine Whose skies fulfil with strenuous cheer The fervent fields that knew thee near. OCTOBER October of the tawny crown, Whose heavy-laden hands drop down Blessing, the bounties of thy breath And mildness of thy mellowing might Fill earth and heaven with love and light Too sweet for fear to dream of death Or memory, while thy joy lives yet, To know what joy would fain forget. NOVEMBER Hail, soft November, though thy pale Sad smile rebuke the words that hail Thy sorrow with no sorrowing words Or gratulate thy grief with song Less bitter than the winds that wrong Thy withering woodlands, where the birds Keep hardly heart to sing or see How fair thy faint wan face may be. DECEMBER December, thou whose hallowing hands On shuddering seas and hardening lands Set as a sacramental sign The seal of Christmas felt on earth As witness toward a new year's birth Whose promise makes thy death divine, The crowning joy that comes of thee Makes glad all grief on land or sea. ENGLAND: AN ODE I Sea and strand, and a lordlier land than sea-tides rolling and rising sun Clasp and lighten in climes that brighten with day when day that was here is done, Call aloud on their children, proud with trust that future and past are one. Far and near from the swan's nest here the storm-birds bred of her fair white breast, Sons whose home was the sea-wave's foam, have borne the fame of her east and west; North and south has the storm-wind's mouth rung praise of England and England's quest. Fame, wherever her flag flew, never forbore to fly with an equal wing: France and Spain with their warrior train bowed down before her as thrall to king; India knelt at her feet, and felt her sway more fruitful of life than spring. Darkness round them as iron bound fell off from races of elder name, Slain at sight of her eyes, whose light bids freedom lighten and burn as flame; Night endures not the touch that cures of kingship tyrants, and slaves of shame. All the terror of time, where error and fear were lords of a world of slaves, Age on age in resurgent rage and anguish darkening as waves on waves, Fell or fled from a face that shed such grace as quickens the dust of graves. Things of night at her glance took flight: the strengths of darkness recoiled and sank: Sank the fires of the murderous pyres whereon wild agony writhed and shrank: Rose the light of the reign of right from gulfs of years that the darkness drank. Yet the might of her wings in flight, whence glory lightens and music rings, Loud and bright as the dawn's, shall smite and still the discord of evil things, Yet not slain by her radiant reign, but darkened now by her sail-stretched wings. II Music made of change and conquest, glory born of evil slain, Stilled the discord, slew the darkness, bade the lights of tempest wane, Where the deathless dawn of England rose in sign that right should reign. Mercy, where the tiger wallowed mad and blind with blood and lust, Justice, where the jackal yelped and fed, and slaves allowed it just, Rose as England's light on Asia rose, and smote them down to dust. Justice bright as mercy, mercy girt by justice with her sword, Smote and saved and raised and ruined, till the tyrant-ridden horde Saw the lightning fade from heaven and knew the sun for God and lord. Where the footfall sounds of England, where the smile of England shines, Rings the tread and laughs the face of freedom, fair as hope divines Days to be, more brave than ours and lit by lordlier stars for signs. All our past acclaims our future: Shakespeare's voice and Nelson's hand, Milton's faith and Wordsworth's trust in this our chosen and chainless land, Bear us witness: come the world against her, England yet shall stand. Earth and sea bear England witness if he lied who said it; he Whom the winds that ward her, waves that clasp, and herb and flower and tree Fed with English dews and sunbeams, hail as more than man may be. No man ever spake as he that bade our England be but true, Keep but faith with England fast and firm, and none should bid her rue; None may speak as he: but all may know the sign that Shakespeare knew. III From the springs of the dawn, from the depths of the noon, from the heights of the night that shine, Hope, faith, and remembrance of glory that found but in England her throne and her shrine, Speak louder than song may proclaim them, that here is the seal of them set for a sign. And loud as the sea's voice thunders applause of the land that is one with the sea Speaks Time in the ear of the people that never at heart was not inly free The word of command that assures us of life, if we will but that life shall be; If the race that is first of the races of men who behold unashamed the sun Stand fast and forget not the sign that is given of the years and the wars that are done, The token that all who are born of its blood should in heart as in blood be one. The word of remembrance that lightens as fire from the steeps of the storm-lit past Bids only the faith of our fathers endure in us, firm as they held it fast: That the glory which was from the first upon England alone may endure to the last. That the love and the hate may change not, the faith may not fade, nor the wrath nor scorn, That shines for her sons and that burns for her foemen as fire of the night or the morn: That the births of her womb may forget not the sign of the glory wherein they were born. A light that is more than the sunlight, an air that is brighter than morning's breath, Clothes England about as the strong sea clasps her, and answers the word that it saith; The word that assures her of life if she change not, and choose not the ways of death. Change darkens and lightens around her, alternate in hope and in fear to be: Hope knows not if fear speak truth, nor fear whether hope be not blind as she: But the sun is in heaven that beholds her immortal, and girdled with life by the sea. ETON: AN ODE FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE COLLEGE I Four hundred summers and fifty have shone on the meadows of Thames and died Since Eton arose in an age that was darkness, and shone by his radiant side As a star that the spell of a wise man's word bade live and ascend and abide. And ever as time's flow brightened, a river more dark than the storm-clothed sea, And age upon age rose fairer and larger in promise of hope set free, With England Eton her child kept pace as a fostress of men to be. And ever as earth waxed wiser, and softer the beating of time's wide wings, Since fate fell dark on her father, most hapless and gentlest of star-crossed kings, Her praise has increased as the chant of the dawn that the choir of the noon outsings. II Storm and cloud in the skies were loud, and lightning mocked at the blind sun's light; War and woe on the land below shed heavier shadow than falls from night; Dark was earth at her dawn of birth as here her record of praise is bright. Clear and fair through her morning air the light first laugh of the sunlit stage Rose and rang as a fount that sprang from depths yet dark with a spent storm's rage, Loud and glad as a boy's, and bade the sunrise open on Shakespeare's age. Lords of state and of war, whom fate found strong in battle, in counsel strong, Here, ere fate had approved them great, abode their season, and thought not long: Here too first was the lark's note nursed that filled and flooded the skies with song. III Shelley, lyric lord of England's lordliest singers, here first heard Ring from lips of poets crowned and dead the Promethean word Whence his soul took fire, and power to outsoar the sunward-soaring bird. Still the reaches of the river, still the light on field and hill, Still the memories held aloft as lamps for hope's young fire to fill, Shine, and while the light of England lives shall shine for England still. When four hundred more and fifty years have risen and shone and set, Bright with names that men remember, loud with names that men forget, Haply here shall Eton's record be what England finds it yet. THE UNION I Three in one, but one in three, God, who girt her with the sea, Bade our Commonweal to be: Nought, if now not one. Though fraud and fear would sever The bond assured for ever, Their shameful strength shall never Undo what heaven has done. II South and North and West and East Watch the ravens flock to feast, Dense as round some death-struck beast, Black as night is black. Stand fast as faith together In stress of treacherous weather When hounds and wolves break tether And Treason guides the pack. III Lovelier than thy seas are strong, Glorious Ireland, sword and song Gird and crown thee: none may wrong, Save thy sons alone. The sea that laughs around us Hath sundered not but bound us: The sun's first rising found us Throned on its equal throne. IV North and South and East and West, All true hearts that wish thee best Beat one tune and own one quest, Staunch and sure as steel. God guard from dark disunion Our threefold State's communion, God save the loyal Union, The royal Commonweal! EAST TO WEST Sunset smiles on sunrise: east and west are one, Face to face in heaven before the sovereign sun. From the springs of the dawn everlasting a glory renews and transfigures the west, From the depths of the sunset a light as of morning enkindles the broad sea's breast, And the lands and the skies and the waters are glad of the day's and the night's work done. Child of dawn, and regent on the world-wide sea, England smiles on Europe, fair as dawn and free. Not the waters that gird her are purer, nor mightier the winds that her waters know. But America, daughter and sister of England, is praised of them, far as they flow: Atlantic responds to Pacific the praise of her days that have been and shall be. So from England westward let the watchword fly, So for England eastward let the seas reply; Praise, honour, and love everlasting be sent on the wind's wings, westward and east, That the pride of the past and the pride of the future may mingle as friends at feast, And the sons of the lords of the world-wide seas be one till the world's life die. INSCRIPTIONS FOR THE FOUR SIDES OF A PEDESTAL I Marlowe, the father of the sons of song Whose praise is England's crowning praise, above All glories else that crown her, sweet and strong As England, clothed with light and fire of love, And girt with might of passion, thought, and trust, Stands here in spirit, sleeps not here in dust. II Marlowe, a star too sovereign, too superb, To fade when heaven took fire from Shakespeare's light, A soul that knew but song's triumphal curb And love's triumphant bondage, holds of right His pride of place, who first in place and time Made England's voice as England's heart sublime. III Marlowe bade England live in living song: The light he lifted up lit Shakespeare's way: He spake, and life sprang forth in music, strong As fire or lightning, sweet as dawn of day. Song was a dream where day took night to wife: “Let there be life,” he said: and there was life. IV Marlowe of all our fathers first beheld Beyond the tidal ebb and flow of things The tideless depth and height of souls, impelled By thought or passion, borne on waves or wings, Beyond all flight or sight but song's: and he First gave our song a sound that matched our sea. ON THE DEATH OF RICHARD BURTON Night or light is it now, wherein Sleeps, shut out from the wild world's din, Wakes, alive with a life more clear, One who found not on earth his kin? Sleep were sweet for awhile, were dear Surely to souls that were heartless here, Souls that faltered and flagged and fell, Soft of spirit and faint of cheer. A living soul that had strength to quell Hope the spectre and fear the spell, Clear-eyed, content with a scorn sublime And a faith superb, can it fare not well? Life, the shadow of wide-winged time, Cast from the wings that change as they climb, Life may vanish in death, and seem Less than the promise of last year's prime. But not for us is the past a dream Wherefrom, as light from a clouded stream, Faith fades and shivers and ebbs away, Faint as the moon if the sundawn gleam. Faith, whose eyes in the low last ray Watch the fire that renews the day, Faith which lives in the living past, Rock-rooted, swerves not as weeds that sway. As trees that stand in the storm-wind fast She stands, unsmitten of death's keen blast, With strong remembrance of sunbright spring Alive at heart to the lifeless last. Night, she knows, may in no wise cling To a soul that sinks not and droops not wing, A sun that sets not in death's false night Whose kingdom finds him not thrall but king. Souls there are that for soul's affright Bow down and cower in the sun's glad sight, Clothed round with faith that is one with fear, And dark with doubt of the live world's light. But him we hailed from afar or near As boldest born of the bravest here And loved as brightest of souls that eyed Life, time, and death with unchangeful cheer, A wider soul than the world was wide, Whose praise made love of him one with pride, What part has death or has time in him, Who rode life's lists as a god might ride? While England sees not her old praise dim, While still her stars through the world's night swim, A fame outshining her Raleigh's fame, A light that lightens her loud sea's rim, Shall shine and sound as her sons proclaim The pride that kindles at Burton's name. And joy shall exalt their pride to be The same in birth if in soul the same. But we that yearn for a friend's face—we Who lack the light that on earth was he— Mourn, though the light be a quenchless flame That shines as dawn on a tideless sea. ELEGY: 1869–1891 Auvergne, Auvergne, O wild and woful land, O glorious land and gracious, white as gleam The stairs of heaven, black as a flameless brand, Strange even as life, and stranger than a dream, Could earth remember man, whose eyes made bright The splendour of her beauty, lit by day Or soothed and softened and redeemed by night, Wouldst thou not know what light has passed away? Wouldst thou not know whom England, whom the world, Mourns? For the world whose wildest ways he trod, And smiled their dangers down that coiled and curled Against him, knows him now less man than god. Our demigod of daring, keenest-eyed To read and deepest read in earth's dim things, A spirit now whose body of death has died And left it mightier yet in eyes and wings, The sovereign seeker of the world, who now Hath sought what world the light of death may show, Hailed once with me the crowns that load thy brow, Crags dark as midnight, columns bright as snow. Thy steep small Siena, splendid and content As shines the mightier city's Tuscan pride Which here its face reflects in radiance, pent By narrower bounds from towering side to side, Set fast between the ridged and foamless waves Of earth more fierce and fluctuant than the sea, The fearless town of towers that hails and braves The heights that gird, the sun that brands Le Puy; The huddled churches clinging on the cliffs As birds alighting might for storm's sake cling, Moored to the rocks as tempest-harried skiffs To perilous refuge from the loud wind's wing; The stairs on stairs that wind and change and climb Even up to the utmost crag's edge curved and curled, More bright than vision, more than faith sublime, Strange as the light and darkness of the world; Strange as are night and morning, stars and sun, And washed from west and east by day's deep tide. Shine yet less fair, when all their heights are won, Than sundawn shows thy pillared mountain-side. Even so the dawn of death, whose light makes dim The starry fires that life sees rise and set, Shows higher than here he shone before us him Whom faith forgets not, nor shall fame forget. Even so those else unfooted heights we clomb Through scudding mist and eddying whirls of cloud, Blind as a pilot beaten blind with foam, And shrouded as a corpse with storm's grey shroud, Foot following foot along the sheer strait ledge Where space was none to bear the wild goat's feet Till blind we sat on the outer footless edge Where darkling death seemed fain to share the seat, The abyss before us, viewless even as time's, The abyss to left of us, the abyss to right, Bid thought now dream how high the freed soul climbs That death sets free from change of day and night. The might of raging mist and wind whose wrath Shut from our eyes the narrowing rock we trod, The wondrous world it darkened, made our path Like theirs who take the shadow of death for God. Yet eastward, veiled in vapour white as snow, The grim black herbless heights that scorn the sun And mock the face of morning rose to show The work of earth-born fire and earthquake done. And half the world was haggard night, wherein We strove our blind way through: but far above Was light that watched the wild mists whirl and spin, And far beneath a land worth light and love. Deep down the Valley of the Curse, undaunted By shadow and whisper of winds with sins for wings And ghosts of crime wherethrough the heights live haunted By present sense of past and monstrous things, The glimmering water holds its gracious way Full forth, and keeps one happier hand's-breadth green Of all that storm-scathed world whereon the sway Sits dark as death of deadlier things unseen. But on the soundless and the viewless river That bears through night perchance again to day The dead whom death and twin-born fame deliver From life that dies, and time's inveterate sway, No shadow save of falsehood and of fear That brands the future with the past, and bids The spirit wither and the soul grow sere, Hovers or hangs to cloud life's opening lids, If life have eyes to lift again and see, Beyond the bounds of sensual sight or breath, What life incognisable of ours may be That turns our light to darkness deep as death. Priests and the soulless serfs of priests may swarm With vulturous acclamation, loud in lies, About his dust while yet his dust is warm Who mocked as sunlight mocks their base blind eyes, Their godless ghost of godhead, false and foul As fear his dam or hell his throne: but we, Scarce hearing, heed no carrion church-wolf's howl: The corpse be theirs to mock; the soul is free. Free as ere yet its earthly day was done It lived above the coil about us curled: A soul whose eyes were keener than the sun, A soul whose wings were wider than the world. We, sons of east and west, ringed round with dreams, Bound fast with visions, girt about with fears, Live, trust, and think by chance, while shadow seems Light, and the wind that wrecks a hand that steers. He, whose full soul held east and west in poise, Weighed man with man, and creed of man's with creed, And age with age, their triumphs and their toys, And found what faith may read not and may read. Scorn deep and strong as death and life, that lit With fire the smile at lies and dreams outworn Wherewith he smote them, showed sublime in it The splendour and the steadfastness of scorn. What loftier heaven, what lordlier air, what space Illimitable, insuperable, infinite, Now to that strong-winged soul yields ampler place Than passing darkness yields to passing light, No dream, no faith can tell us: hope and fear, Whose tongues were loud of old as children's, now From babbling fall to silence: change is here, And death; dark furrows drawn by time's dark plough. Still sunward here on earth its flight was bent, Even since the man within the child began To yearn and kindle with superb intent And trust in time to magnify the man. Still toward the old garden of the Sun, whose fruit The honey-heavy lips of Sophocles Desired and sang, wherein the unwithering root Sprang of all growths that thought brings forth and sees Incarnate, bright with bloom or dense with leaf Far-shadowing, deep as depth of dawn or night: And all were parcel of the garnered sheaf His strenuous spirit bound and stored aright. And eastward now, and ever toward the dawn, If death's deep veil by life's bright hand be rent, We see, as through the shadow of death withdrawn, The imperious soul's indomitable ascent. But not the soul whose labour knew not end— But not the swordsman's hand, the crested head— The royal heart we mourn, the faultless friend, Burton—a name that lives till fame be dead. A SEQUENCE OF SONNETS ON THE DEATH OF ROBERT BROWNING I [The clearest eyes in all the world they read] The clearest eyes in all the world they read With sense more keen and spirit of sight more true Than burns and thrills in sunrise, when the dew Flames, and absorbs the glory round it shed, As they the light of ages quick and dead, Closed now, forsake us: yet the shaft that slew Can slay not one of all the works we knew, Nor death discrown that many-laurelled head. The works of words whose life seems lightning wrought, And moulded of unconquerable thought, And quickened with imperishable flame, Stand fast and shine and smile, assured that nought May fade of all their myriad-moulded fame, Nor England's memory clasp not Browning's name. December 13, 1889. II [Death, what hast thou to do with one for whom] Death, what hast thou to do with one for whom Time is not lord, but servant? What least part Of all the fire that fed his living heart, Of all the light more keen than sundawn's bloom That lit and led his spirit, strong as doom And bright as hope, can aught thy breath may dart Quench? Nay, thou knowest he knew thee what thou art, A shadow born of terror's barren womb, That brings not forth save shadows. What art thou, To dream, albeit thou breathe upon his brow, That power on him is given thee,—that thy breath Can make him less than love acclaims him now, And hears all time sound back the word it saith? What part hast thou then in his glory, Death? III [A graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve] A graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve: Venice and winter, hand in deadly hand, Have slain the lover of her sunbright strand And singer of a stormbright Christmas Eve. A graceless guerdon we that loved receive For all our love, from that the dearest land Love worshipped ever. Blithe and soft and bland, Too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave, Shone on our dreams and memories evermore The domes, the towers, the mountains and the shore That gird or guard thee, Venice: cold and black Seems now the face we loved as he of yore. We have given thee love—no stint, no stay, no lack: What gift, what gift is this thou hast given us back? IV [But he—to him, who knows what gift is thine] But he—to him, who knows what gift is thine, Death? Hardly may we think or hope, when we Pass likewise thither where to-night is he, Beyond the irremeable outer seas that shine And darken round such dreams as half divine Some sunlit harbour in that starless sea Where gleams no ship to windward or to lee, To read with him the secret of thy shrine. There too, as here, may song, delight, and love, The nightingale, the sea-bird, and the dove, Fulfil with joy the splendour of the sky Till all beneath wax bright as all above: But none of all that search the heavens, and try The sun, may match the sovereign eagle's eye. December 14. V [Among the wondrous ways of men and time] Among the wondrous ways of men and time He went as one that ever found and sought And bore in hand the lamplike spirit of thought To illume with instance of its fire sublime The dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime. No spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought, No faith, no fear, no dream, no rapture, nought That blooms in wisdom, nought that burns in crime, No virtue girt and armed and helmed with light, No love more lovely than the snows are white, No serpent sleeping in some dead soul's tomb, No song-bird singing from some live soul's height, But he might hear, interpret, or illume With sense invasive as the dawn of doom. VI [What secret thing of splendour or of shade] What secret thing of splendour or of shade Surmised in all those wandering ways wherein Man, led of love and life and death and sin, Strays, climbs, or cowers, allured, absorbed, afraid, Might not the strong and sunlike sense invade Of that full soul that had for aim to win Light, silent over time's dark toil and din, Life, at whose touch death fades as dead things fade? O spirit of man, what mystery moves in thee That he might know not of in spirit, and see The heart within the heart that seems to strive, The life within the life that seems to be, And hear, through all thy storms that whirl and drive, The living sound of all men's souls alive? VII [He held no dream worth waking: so he said] He held no dream worth waking: so he said, He who stands now on death's triumphal steep, Awakened out of life wherein we sleep And dream of what he knows and sees, being dead. But never death for him was dark or dread: “Look forth” he bade the soul, and fear not. Weep, All ye that trust not in his truth, and keep Vain memory's vision of a vanished head As all that lives of all that once was he Save that which lightens from his word: but we, Who, seeing the sunset-coloured waters roll, Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea, Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole, And life and death but shadows of the soul. December 15. SUNSET AND MOONRISE New Year's Eve, 1889 All the west, whereon the sunset sealed the dead year's glorious grave Fast with seals of light and fire and cloud that light and fire illume, Glows at heart and kindles earth and heaven with joyous blush and bloom, Warm and wide as life, and glad of death that only slays to save. As a tide-reconquered sea-rock lies aflush with the influent wave Lies the light aflush with darkness, lapped about by lustrous gloom, Even as life with death, and fame with time, and memory with the tomb Where a dead man hath for vassals Fame the serf and Time the slave. Far from earth as heaven, the steadfast light withdrawn, superb, suspense, Burns in dumb divine expansion of illimitable flower: Moonrise whets the shadow's edges keen as noontide: hence and thence Glows the presence from us passing, shines and passes not the power. Souls arise whose word remembered is as spirit within the sense: All the hours are theirs of all the seasons: death has but his hour. BIRTHDAY ODE August 6, 1891 I Love and praise, and a length of days whose shadow cast upon time is light, Days whose sound was a spell shed round from wheeling wings as of doves in flight, Meet in one, that the mounting sun to-day may triumph, and cast out night. Two years more than the full fourscore lay hallowing hands on a sacred head— Scarce one score of the perfect four uncrowned of fame as they smiled and fled: Still and soft and alive aloft their sunlight stays though the suns be dead. Ere we were or were thought on, ere the love that gave us to life began, Fame grew strong with his crescent song, to greet the goal of the race they ran, Song with fame, and the lustrous name with years whose changes acclaimed the man. II Soon, ere time in the rounding rhyme of choral seasons had hailed us men, We too heard and acclaimed the word whose breath was life upon England then— Life more bright than the breathless light of soundless noon in a songless glen. Ah, the joy of the heartstruck boy whose ear was opened of love to hear! Ah, the bliss of the burning kiss of song and spirit, the mounting cheer Lit with fire of divine desire and love that knew not if love were fear! Fear and love as of heaven above and earth enkindled of heaven were one; One white flame, that around his name grew keen and strong as the worldwide sun; Awe made bright with implied delight, as weft with weft of the rainbow spun. III He that fears not the voice he hears and loves shall never have heart to sing: All the grace of the sun-god's face that bids the soul as a fountain spring Bids the brow that receives it bow, and hail his likeness on earth as king. We that knew when the sun's shaft flew beheld and worshipped, adored and heard: Light rang round it of shining sound, whence all men's hearts were subdued and stirred: Joy, love, sorrow, the day, the morrow, took life upon them in one man's word. Not for him can the years wax dim, nor downward swerve on a darkening way: Upward wind they, and leave behind such light as lightens the front of May: Fair as youth and sublime as truth we find the fame that we hail to-day. THRENODY October 6, 1892 I Life, sublime and serene when time had power upon it and ruled its breath, Changed it, bade it be glad or sad, and hear what change in the world's ear saith, Shines more fair in the starrier air whose glory lightens the dusk of death. Suns that sink on the wan sea's brink, and moons that kindle and flame and fade, Leave more clear for the darkness here the stars that set not and see not shade Rise and rise on the lowlier skies by rule of sunlight and moonlight swayed. So, when night for his eyes grew bright, his proud head pillowed on Shakespeare's breast, Hand in hand with him, soon to stand where shine the glories that death loves best, Passed the light of his face from sight, and sank sublimely to radiant rest. II Far above us and all our love, beyond all reach of its voiceless praise, Shines for ever the name that never shall feel the shade of the changeful days Fall and chill the delight that still sees winter's light on it shine like May's. Strong as death is the dark day's breath whose blast has withered the life we see Here where light is the child of night, and less than visions or dreams are we: Strong as death; but a word, a breath, a dream is stronger than death can be. Strong as truth and superb in youth eternal, fair as the sundawn's flame Seen when May on her first-born day bids earth exult in her radiant name, Lives, clothed round with its praise and crowned with love that dies not, his love-lit fame. III Fairer far than the morning star, and sweet for us as the songs that rang Loud through heaven from the choral Seven when all the stars of the morning sang, Shines the song that we loved so long—since first such love in us flamed and sprang. England glows as a sunlit rose from mead to mountain, from sea to sea, Bright with love and with pride above all taint of sorrow that needs must be, Needs must live for an hour, and give its rainbow's glory to lawn and lea. Not through tears shall the new-born years behold him, crowned with applause of men, Pass at last from a lustrous past to life that lightens beyond their ken, Glad and dead, and from earthward led to sunward, guided of Imogen. THE BALLAD OF MELICERTES In Memory of Théodore de Banville Death, a light outshining life, bids heaven resume Star by star the souls whose light made earth divine. Death, a night outshining day, sees burn and bloom Flower by flower, and sun by sun, the fames that shine Deathless, higher than life beheld their sovereign sign. Dead Simonides of Ceos, late restored, Given again of God, again by man deplored, Shone but yestereve, a glory frail as breath. Frail? But fame's breath quickens, kindles, keeps in ward, Life so sweet as this that dies and casts off death. Mother's love, and rapture of the sea, whose womb Breeds eternal life of joy that stings like brine, Pride of song, and joy to dare the singer's doom, Sorrow soft as sleep and laughter bright as wine, Flushed and filled with fragrant fire his lyric line. As the sea-shell utters, like a stricken chord, Music uttering all the sea's within it stored, Poet well-beloved, whose praise our sorrow saith, So thy songs retain thy soul, and so record Life so sweet as this that dies and casts off death. Side by side we mourned at Gautier's golden tomb: Here in spirit now I stand and mourn at thine. Yet no breath of death strikes thence, no shadow of gloom, Only light more bright than gold of the inmost mine, Only steam of incense warm from love's own shrine. Not the darkling stream, the sundering Stygian ford, Not the hour that smites and severs as a sword, Not the night subduing light that perisheth, Smite, subdue, divide from us by doom abhorred, Life so sweet as this that dies and casts off death. Prince of song more sweet than honey, lyric lord, Not thy France here only mourns a light adored, One whose love-lit fame the world inheriteth. Strangers too, now brethren, hail with heart's accord Life so sweet as this that dies and casts off death. Omitted here is a poem written in French. LIGHT: AN EPICEDE To Philip Bourke Marston Love will not weep because the seal is broken That sealed upon a life beloved and brief Darkness, and let but song break through for token How deep, too far for even thy song's relief, Slept in thy soul the secret springs of grief. Thy song may soothe full many a soul hereafter, As tears, if tears will come, dissolve despair; As here but late, with smile more bright than laughter, Thy sweet strange yearning eyes would seem to bear Witness that joy might cleave the clouds of care. Two days agone, and love was one with pity When love gave thought wings toward the glimmering goal Where, as a shrine lit in some darkling city, Shone soft the shrouded image of thy soul: And now thou art healed of life; thou art healed, and whole. Yea, two days since, all we that loved thee pitied: And now with wondering love, with shame of face, We think how foolish now, how far unfitted, Should be from us, toward thee who hast run thy race, Pity—toward thee, who hast won the painless place; The painless world of death, yet unbeholden Of eyes that dream what light now lightens thine And will not weep. Thought, yearning toward those olden Dear hours that sorrow sees and sees not shine, Bows tearless down before a flameless shrine: A flameless altar here of life and sorrow Quenched and consumed together. These were one, One thing for thee, as night was one with morrow And utter darkness with the sovereign sun: And now thou seest life, sorrow, and darkness done. And yet love yearns again to win thee hither; Blind love, and loveless, and unworthy thee: Here where I watch the hours of darkness wither, Here where mine eyes were glad and sad to see Thine that could see not mine, though turned on me. But now, if aught beyond sweet sleep lie hidden, And sleep be sealed not fast on dead men's sight For ever, thine hath grace for ours forbidden, And sees us compassed round with change and night: Yet light like thine is ours, if love be light. THRENODY Watching here alone by the fire whereat last year Sat with me the friend that a week since yet was near, That a week has borne so far and hid so deep, Woe am I that I may not weep, May not yearn to behold him here. Shame were mine, and little the love I bore him were, Now to mourn that better he fares than love may fare Which desires, and would not have indeed, its will, Would not love him so worse than ill, Would not clothe him again with care. Yet can love not choose but remember, hearts but ache, Eyes but darken, only for one vain thought's poor sake, For the thought that by this hearth's now lonely side Two fast friends, on the day he died, Looked once more for his hand to take. Let thy soul forgive them, and pardon heal the sin, Though their hearts be heavy to think what then had been, The delight that never while they live may be— Love's communion of speech with thee. Soul and speech with the soul therein. O my friend, O brother, a glory veiled and marred! Never love made moan for a life more evil-starred. Was it envy, chance, or chance-compelling fate, Whence thy spirit was bruised so late, Bowed so heavily, bound so hard? Now released, it may be,—if only love might know— Filled and fired with sight, it beholds us blind and low With a pity keener yet, if that may be, Even than ever was this that we Felt, when love of thee wrought us woe. None may tell the depths and the heights of life and death. What we may we give thee: a word that sorrow saith, And that none will heed save sorrow: scarce a song. All we may, who have loved thee long, Take: the best we can give is breath. A DIRGE [A bell tolls on in my heart] A bell tolls on in my heart As though in my ears a knell Had ceased for awhile to swell, But the sense of it would not part From the spirit that bears its part In the chime of the soundless bell. Ah dear dead singer of sorrow, The burden is now not thine That grief bade sound for a sign Through the songs of the night whose morrow Has risen, and I may not borrow A beam from its radiant shrine. The burden has dropped from thee That grief on thy life bound fast; The winter is over and past Whose end thou wast fain to see. Shall sorrow not comfort me That is thine no longer—at last? Good day, good night, and good morrow, Men living and mourning say. For thee we could only pray That night of the day might borrow Such comfort as dreams lend sorrow: Death gives thee at last good day. A REMINISCENCE The rose to the wind has yielded: all its leaves Lie strewn on the graveyard grass, and all their light And colour and fragrance leave our sense and sight Bereft as a man whom bitter time bereaves Of blossom at once and hope of garnered sheaves, Of April at once and August. Day to night Calls wailing, and life to death, and depth to height, And soul upon soul of man that hears and grieves. Who knows, though he see the snow-cold blossom shed, If haply the heart that burned within the rose, The spirit in sense, the life of life be dead? If haply the wind that slays with storming snows Be one with the wind that quickens? Bow thine head, O Sorrow, and commune with thine heart: who knows? VIA DOLOROSA The days of a man are threescore years and ten. The days of his life were half a man's, whom we Lament, and would yet not bid him back, to be Partaker of all the woes and ways of men. Life sent him enough of sorrow: not again Would anguish of love, beholding him set free, Bring back the beloved to suffer life and see No light but the fire of grief that scathed him then. We know not at all: we hope, and do not fear. We shall not again behold him, late so near, Who now from afar above, with eyes alight And spirit enkindled, haply toward us here Looks down unforgetful yet of days like night And love that has yet his sightless face in sight. February 15, 1887. I TRANSFIGURATION But half a man's days—and his days were nights. What hearts were ours who loved him, should we pray That night would yield him back to darkling day, Sweet death that soothes, to life that spoils and smites? For now, perchance, life lovelier than the light's That shed no comfort on his weary way Shows him what none may dream to see or say Ere yet the soul may scale those topless heights Where death lies dead, and triumph. Haply there Already may his kindling eyesight find Faces of friends—no face than his more fair— And first among them found of all his kind Milton, with crowns from Eden on his hair, And eyes that meet a brother's now not blind. II DELIVERANCE O death, fair Death, sole comforter and sweet, Nor Love nor Hope can give such gifts as thine. Sleep hardly shows us round thy shadowy shrine What roses hang, what music floats, what feet Pass and what wings of angels. We repeat Wild words or mild, disastrous or divine, Blind prayer, blind imprecation, seeing no sign Nor hearing aught of thee not faint and fleet As words of men or snowflakes on the wind. But if we chide thee, saying “Thou hast sinned, thou hast sinned, Dark Death, to take so sweet a light away As shone but late, though shadowed, in our skies,” We hear thine answer—“Night has given what day Denied him: darkness hath unsealed his eyes.” III THANKSGIVING Could love give strength to thank thee! Love can give Strong sorrow heart to suffer: what we bear We would not put away, albeit this were A burden love might cast aside and live. Love chooses rather pain than palliative, Sharp thought than soft oblivion. May we dare So trample down our passion and our prayer That fain would cling round feet now fugitive And stay them—so remember, so forget, What joy we had who had his presence yet, What griefs were his while joy in him was ours And grief made weary music of his breath, As even to hail his best and last of hours With love grown strong enough to thank thee, Death? IV LIBITINA VERTICORDIA Sister of sleep, healer of life, divine As rest and strong as very love may be, To set the soul that love could set not free, To bid the skies that day could bid not shine, To give the gift that life withheld was thine. With all my heart I loved one borne from me: And all my heart bows down and praises thee, Death, that hast now made grief not his but mine. O Changer of men's hearts, we would not bid thee Turn back our hearts from sorrow: this alone We bid, we pray thee, from thy sovereign throne And sanctuary sublime where heaven has hid thee, Give: grace to know of those for whom we weep That if they wake their life is sweet as sleep. V THE ORDER OF RELEASE Thou canst not give it. Grace enough is ours To know that pain for him has fallen on rest. The worst we know was his on earth: the best, We fain would think,—a thought no fear deflowers— Is his, released from bonds of rayless hours. Ah, turn our hearts from longing; bid our quest Cease, as content with failure. This thy guest Sleeps, vexed no more of time's imperious powers, The spirit of hope, the spirit of change and loss, The spirit of love bowed down beneath his cross, Nor now needs comfort from the strength of song. Love, should he wake, bears now no cross for him: Dead hope, whose living eyes like his were dim, Has brought forth better comfort, strength more strong. ?? ??????????? As Greece of old acclaimed thee God and man, So, Death, our tongue acclaims thee: yet wast thou Hailed of old Rome as Romans hail thee now, Goddess and woman. Since the sands first ran That told when first man's life and death began, The shadows round thy blind ambiguous brow Have mocked the votive plea, the pleading vow That sought thee sorrowing, fain to bless or ban. But stronger than a father's love is thine, And gentler than a mother's. Lord and God, Thy staff is surer than the wizard rod That Hermes bare as priest before thy shrine And herald of thy mercies. We could give Nought, when we would have given: thou bidst him live. VII THE LAST WORD So many a dream and hope that went and came, So many and sweet, that love thought like to be, Of hours as bright and soft as those for me That made our hearts for song's sweet love the same, Lie now struck dead, that hope seems one with shame. O Death, thy name is Love: we know it, and see The witness: yet for very love's sake we Can hardly bear to mix with thine his name. Philip, how hard it is to bid thee part Thou knowest, if aught thou knowest where now thou art Of us that loved and love thee. None may tell What none but knows—how hard it is to say The word that seals up sorrow, darkens day, And bids fare forth the soul it bids farewell. IN MEMORY OF AURELIO SAFFI The wider world of men that is not ours Receives a soul whose life on earth was light. Though darkness close the date of human hours, Love holds the spirit and sense of life in sight, That may not, even though death bid fly, take flight. Faith, love, and hope fulfilled with memory, see As clear and dear as life could bid it be The present soul that is and is not he. He, who held up the shield and sword of Rome Against the ravening brood of recreant France, Beside the man of men whom heaven took home When earth beheld the spring's first eyebeams glance And life and winter seemed alike a trance Eighteen years since, in sight of heaven and spring That saw the soul above all souls take wing, He too now hears the heaven we hear not sing. He too now dwells where death is dead, and stands Where souls like stars exult in life to be: Whence all who linked heroic hearts and hands Shine on our sight, and give it strength to see What hope makes fair for all whom faith makes free: Free with such freedom as we find in sleep, The light sweet shadow of death, when dreams are deep And high as heaven whence light and lightning leap. And scarce a month yet gone, his living hand Writ loving words that sealed me friend of his. Are heaven and earth as near as sea to strand? May life and death as bride and bridegroom kiss? His last month's written word abides, and is; Clear as the sun that lit through storm and strife And darkling days when hope took fear to wife The faith whose fire was light of all his life. A life so fair, so pure of earthlier leaven, That none hath won through higher and harder ways The deathless life of death which earth calls heaven; Heaven, and the light of love on earth, and praise Of silent memory through subsiding days Wherein the light subsides not whence the past Feeds full with life the future. Time holds fast Their names whom faith forgets not, first and last. Forget? The dark forgets not dawn, nor we The suns that sink to rise again, and shine Lords of live years and ages. Earth and sea Forget not heaven that makes them seem divine, Though night put out their fires and bid their shrine Be dark and pale as storm and twilight. Day, Not night, is everlasting: life's full sway Bids death bow down as dead, and pass away. What part has death in souls that past all fear Win heavenward their supernal way, and smite With scorn sublime as heaven such dreams as here Plague and perplex with cloud and fire the light That leads men's waking souls from glimmering night To the awless heights of day, whereon man's awe, Transfigured, dies in rapture, seeing the law Sealed of the sun that earth arising saw? Faith, justice, mercy, love, and heaven-born hate That sets them all on fire and bids them be More than soft words and dreams that wake too late, Shone living through the lordly life that we Beheld, revered, and loved on earth, while he Dwelt here, and bade our eyes take light thereof; Light as from heaven that flamed or smiled above In light or fire whose very hate was love. No hate of man, but hate of hate whose foam Sheds poison forth from tongues of snakes and priests, And stains the sickening air with steams whence Rome Now feeds not full the God that slays and feasts; For now the fangs of all the ravenous beasts That ramped about him, fain of prayer and prey, Fulfil their lust no more: the tide of day Swells, and compels him down the deathward way. Night sucks the Church its creature down, and hell Yawns, heaves, and yearns to clasp its loathliest child Close to the breasts that bore it. All the spell Whence darkness saw the dawn in heaven defiled Is dumb as death: the lips that lied and smiled Wax white for fear as ashes. She that bore The banner up of darkness now no more Sheds night and fear and shame from shore to shore. When they that cast her kingdom down were born, North cried on south and east made moan to west For hopes that love had hardly heart to mourn, For Italy that was not. Kings on quest, By priests whose blessings burn as curses blest, Made spoil of souls and bodies bowed and bound, Hunted and harried, leashed as horse or hound, And hopeless of the hope that died unfound. And now that faith has brought forth fruit to time, How should not memory praise their names, and hold Their record even as Dante's life sublime, Who bade his dream, found fair and false of old, Live? Not till earth and heaven be dead and cold May man forget whose work and will made one Italy, fair as heaven or freedom won, And left their fame to shine beside her sun. April 1890. THE FESTIVAL OF BEATRICE Dante, sole standing on the heavenward height, Beheld and heard one saying, “Behold me well: I am, I am Beatrice.” Heaven and hell Kept silence, and the illimitable light Of all the stars was darkness in his sight Whose eyes beheld her eyes again, and fell Shame-stricken. Since her soul took flight to dwell In heaven, six hundred years have taken flight. And now that heavenliest part of earth whereon Shines yet their shadow as once their presence shone To her bears witness for his sake, as he For hers bare witness when her face was gone: No slave, no hospice now for grief—but free From shore to mountain and from Alp to sea. THE MONUMENT OF GIORDANO BRUNO I Not from without us, only from within, Comes or can ever come upon us light Whereby the soul keeps ever truth in sight. No truth, no strength, no comfort man may win, No grace for guidance, no release from sin, Save of his own soul's giving. Deep and bright As fire enkindled in the core of night Burns in the soul where once its fire has been The light that leads and quickens thought, inspired To doubt and trust and conquer. So he said Whom Sidney, flower of England, lordliest head Of all we love, loved: but the fates required A sacrifice to hate and hell, ere fame Should set with his in heaven Giordano's name. II Cover thine eyes and weep, O child of hell, Grey spouse of Satan, Church of name abhorred. Weep, withered harlot, with thy weeping lord, Now none will buy the heaven thou hast to sell At price of prostituted souls, and swell Thy loveless list of lovers. Fire and sword No more are thine: the steel, the wheel, the cord, The flames that rose round living limbs, and fell In lifeless ash and ember, now no more Approve thee godlike. Rome, redeemed at last From all the red pollution of thy past, Acclaims the grave bright face that smiled of yore Even on the fire that caught it round and clomb To cast its ashes on the face of Rome. June 9, 1889. LIFE IN DEATH He should have followed who goes forth before us, Last born of us in life, in death first-born: The last to lift up eyes against the morn, The first to see the sunset. Life, that bore us Perchance for death to comfort and restore us, Of him hath left us here awhile forlorn, For him is as a garment overworn, And time and change, with suns and stars in chorus, Silent. But if, beyond all change or time, A law more just, more equal, more sublime Than sways the surge of life's loud sterile sea Sways that still world whose peace environs him, Where death lies dead as night when stars wax dim, Above all thought or hope of ours is he. August 2, 1891. EPICEDE [As a vesture shalt thou change them, said the prophet] As a vesture shalt thou change them, said the prophet, And the raiment that was flesh is turned to dust; Dust and flesh and dust again the likeness of it, And the fine gold woven and worn of youth is rust. Hours that wax and wane salute the shade and scoff it, That it knows not aught it doth nor aught it must: Day by day the speeding soul makes haste to doff it, Night by night the pride of life resigns its trust. Sleep, whose silent notes of song loud life's derange not, Takes the trust in hand awhile as angels may: Joy with wings that rest not, grief with wings that range not, Guard the gates of sleep and waking, gold or grey. Joys that joys estrange, and griefs that griefs estrange not, Day that yearns for night, and night that yearns for day, As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they change not, Seeing that change may never change or pass away. Life of death makes question, “What art thou that changest? What am I, that fear should trust or faith should doubt? I that lighten, thou that darkenest and estrangest, Is it night or day that girds us round about? Light and darkness on the ways wherein thou rangest Seem as one, and beams as clouds they put to rout. Strange is hope, but fear of all things born were strangest, Seeing that none may strive with change to cast it out. “Change alone stands fast, thou sayest, O death: I know not: What art thou, my brother death, that thou shouldst know? Men may reap no fruits of fields wherein they sow not; Hope or fear is all the seed we have to sow. Winter seals the sacred springs up that they flow not: Wind and sun and change unbind them, and they flow. Am I thou or art thou I? The years that show not Pass, and leave no sign when time shall be to show.” Hope makes suit to faith lest fear give ear to sorrow: Doubt strews dust upon his head, and goes his way. All the golden hope that life of death would borrow, How, if death require again, may life repay? Earth endures no darkness whence no light yearns thorough; God in man as light in darkness lives, they say: Yet, would midnight take assurance of the morrow, Who shall pledge the faith or seal the bond of day? Darkness, mute or loud with music or with mourning, Starry darkness, winged with wind or clothed with calm, Dreams no dream of grief or fear or wrath or warning, Bears no sign of race or goal or strife or palm. Word of blessing, word of mocking or of scorning, Knows it none, nor whence its breath sheds blight or balm. Yet a little while, and hark, the psalm of morning: Yet a little while, and silence takes the psalm. All the comfort, all the worship, all the wonder, All the light of love that darkness holds in fee, All the song that silence keeps or keeps not under, Night, the soul that knows gives thanks for all to thee. Far beyond the gates that morning strikes in sunder, Hopes that grief makes holy, dreams that fear sets free, Far above the throne of thought, the lair of thunder, Silent shines the word whose utterance fills the sea. MEMORIAL VERSES ON THE DEATH OF WILLIAM BELL SCOTT A life more bright than the sun's face, bowed Through stress of season and coil of cloud, Sets: and the sorrow that casts out fear Scarce deems him dead in his chill still shroud, Dead on the breast of the dying year, Poet and painter and friend, thrice dear For love of the suns long set, for love Of song that sets not with sunset here, For love of the fervent heart, above Their sense who saw not the swift light move That filled with sense of the loud sun's lyre The thoughts that passion was fain to prove In fervent labour of high desire And faith that leapt from its own quenched pyre Alive and strong as the sun, and caught From darkness light, and from twilight fire. Passion, deep as the depths unsought Whence faith's own hope may redeem us nought, Filled full with ardour of pain sublime His mourning song and his mounting thought. Elate with sense of a sterner time, His hand's flight clomb as a bird's might climb Calvary: dark in the darkling air That shrank for fear of the crowning crime, Three crosses rose on the hillside bare, Shown scarce by grace of the lightning's glare That clove the veil of the temple through And smote the priests on the threshold there. The soul that saw it, the hand that drew, Whence light as thought's or as faith's glance flew, And stung to life the sepulchral past, And bade the stars of it burn anew, Held no less than the dead world fast The light live shadows about them cast, The likeness living of dawn and night, The days that pass and the dreams that last. Thought, clothed round with sorrow as light, Dark as a cloud that the moon turns bright, Moved, as a wind on the striving sea, That yearns and quickens and flags in flight, Through forms of colour and song that he Who fain would have set its wide wings free Cast round it, clothing or chaining hope With lights that last not and shades that flee. Scarce in song could his soul find scope, Scarce the strength of his hand might ope Art's inmost gate of her sovereign shrine, To cope with heaven as a man may cope. But high as the hope of a man may shine The faith, the fervour, the life divine That thrills our life and transfigures, rose And shone resurgent, a sunbright sign, Through shapes whereunder the strong soul glows And fills them full as a sunlit rose With sense and fervour of life, whose light The fool's eye knows not, the man's eye knows. None that can read or divine aright The scriptures writ of the soul may slight The strife of a strenuous soul to show More than the craft of the hand may write. None may slight it, and none may know How high the flames that aspire and glow From heart and spirit and soul may climb And triumph; higher than the souls lie low Whose hearing hears not the livelong rhyme, Whose eyesight sees not the light sublime, That shines, that sounds, that ascends and lives Unquenched of change, unobscured of time. A long life's length, as a man's life gives Space for the spirit that soars and strives To strive and soar, has the soul shone through That heeds not whither the world's wind drives Now that the days and the ways it knew Are strange, are dead as the dawn's grey dew At high midnoon of the mounting day That mocks the might of the dawn it slew. Yet haply may not—and haply may— No sense abide of the dead sun's ray Wherein the soul that outsoars us now Rejoiced with ours in its radiant sway. Hope may hover, and doubt may bow, Dreaming. Haply—they dream not how— Not life but death may indeed be dead When silence darkens the dead man's brow. Hope, whose name is remembrance, fed With love that lightens from seasons fled, Dreams, and craves not indeed to know, That death and life are as souls that wed. But change that falls on the heart like snow Can chill not memory nor hope, that show The soul, the spirit, the heart and head, Alive above us who strive below. AN OLD SAYING Many waters cannot quench love, Neither can the floods drown it. Who shall snare or slay the white dove Faith, whose very dreams crown it, Gird it round with grace and peace, deep, Warm, and pure, and soft as sweet sleep? Many waters cannot quench love, Neither can the floods drown it. Set me as a seal upon thine heart, As a seal upon thine arm. How should we behold the days depart And the nights resign their charm? Love is as the soul: though hate and fear Waste and overthrow, they strike not here. Set me as a seal upon thine heart, As a seal upon thine arm. A MOSS-ROSE If the rose of all flowers be the rarest That heaven may adore from above, And the fervent moss-rose be the fairest That sweetens the summer with love, Can it be that a fairer than any Should blossom afar from the tree? Yet one, and a symbol of many, Shone sudden for eyes that could see. In the grime and the gloom of November The bliss and the bloom of July Bade autumn rejoice and remember The balm of the blossoms gone by. Would you know what moss-rose now it may be That puts all the rest to the blush, The flower was the face of a baby, The moss was a bonnet of plush. TO A CAT I Stately, kindly, lordly friend, Condescend Here to sit by me, and turn Glorious eyes that smile and burn, Golden eyes, love's lustrous meed, On the golden page I read. All your wondrous wealth of hair, Dark and fair, Silken-shaggy, soft and bright As the clouds and beams of night, Pays my reverent hand's caress Back with friendlier gentleness. Dogs may fawn on all and some As they come; You, a friend of loftier mind, Answer friends alone in kind. Just your foot upon my hand Softly bids it understand. Morning round this silent sweet Garden-seat Sheds its wealth of gathering light, Thrills the gradual clouds with might, Changes woodland, orchard, heath, Lawn, and garden there beneath. Fair and dim they gleamed below: Now they glow Deep as even your sunbright eyes, Fair as even the wakening skies. Can it not or can it be Now that you give thanks to see? May not you rejoice as I, Seeing the sky Change to heaven revealed, and bid Earth reveal the heaven it hid All night long from stars and moon, Now the sun sets all in tune? What within you wakes with day Who can say? All too little may we tell, Friends who like each other well, What might haply, if we might, Bid us read our lives aright. II Wild on woodland ways your sires Flashed like fires; Fair as flame and fierce and fleet As with wings on wingless feet Shone and sprang your mother, free, Bright and brave as wind or sea. Free and proud and glad as they, Here to-day Rests or roams their radiant child, Vanquished not, but reconciled, Free from curb of aught above Save the lovely curb of love. Love through dreams of souls divine Fain would shine Round a dawn whose light and song Then should right our mutual wrong— Speak, and seal the love-lit law Sweet Assisi's seer foresaw. Dreams were theirs; yet haply may Dawn a day When such friends and fellows born, Seeing our earth as fair at morn, May for wiser love's sake see More of heaven's deep heart than we. HAWTHORN DYKE All the golden air is full of balm and bloom Where the hawthorns line the shelving dyke with flowers. Joyous children born of April's happiest hours, High and low they laugh and lighten, knowing their doom Bright as brief—to bless and cheer they know not whom, Heed not how, but washed and warmed with suns and showers Smile, and bid the sweet soft gradual banks and bowers Thrill with love of sunlit fire or starry gloom. All our moors and lawns all round rejoice; but here All the rapturous resurrection of the year Finds the radiant utterance perfect, sees the word Spoken, hears the light that speaks it. Far and near, All the world is heaven: and man and flower and bird Here are one at heart with all things seen and heard. THE BROTHERS There were twa brethren fell on strife; Sweet fruits are sair to gather: The tane has reft his brother of life; And the wind wears owre the heather. There were twa brethren fell to fray; Sweet fruits are sair to gather: The tane is clad in a cloak of clay; And the wind wears owre the heather. O loud and loud was the live man's cry, (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) “Would God the dead and the slain were I!” And the wind wears owre the heather. “O sair was the wrang and sair the fray,” (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) “But liefer had love be slain than slay.” And the wind wears owre the heather. “O sweet is the life that sleeps at hame,” (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) “But I maun wake on a far sea's faem.” And the wind wears owre the heather. “And women are fairest of a' things fair,” (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) “But never shall I kiss woman mair.” And the wind wears owre the heather. Between the birk and the aik and the thorn (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) He's laid his brother to lie forlorn: And the wind wears owre the heather. Between the bent and the burn and the broom (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) He's laid him to sleep till dawn of doom: And the wind wears owre the heather. He's tane him owre the waters wide, (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) Afar to fleet and afar to bide: And the wind wears owre the heather. His hair was yellow, his cheek was red, (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) When he set his face to the wind and fled: And the wind wears owre the heather. His banes were stark and his een were bright (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) When he set his face to the sea by night: And the wind wears owre the heather. His cheek was wan and his hair was grey (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) When he came back hame frae the wide world's way: And the wind wears owre the heather. His banes were weary, his een were dim, (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) And nae man lived and had mind of him: And the wind wears owre the heather. “O whatten a wreck wad they seek on land” (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) “That they houk the turf to the seaward hand?” And the wind wears owre the heather. “O whatten a prey wad they think to take” (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) “That they delve the dykes for a dead man's sake?” And the wind wears owre the heather. A bane of the dead in his hand he's tane; Sweet fruits are sair to gather: And the red blood brak frae the dead white bane. And the wind wears owre the heather. He's cast it forth of his auld faint hand; Sweet fruits are sair to gather: And the red blood ran on the wan wet sand. And the wind wears owre the heather. “O whatten a slayer is this,” they said, (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) “That the straik of his hand should raise his dead?” And the wind wears owre the heather. “O weel is me for the sign I take” (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) “That now I may die for my auld sin's sake.” And the wind wears owre the heather. “For the dead was in wait now fifty year,” (Sweet fruits are sair to gather) “And now shall I die for his blood's sake here.” And the wind wears owre the heather. JACOBITE SONG Now who will speak, and lie not, And pledge not life, but give? Slaves herd with herded cattle: The dawn grows bright for battle, And if we die, we die not; And if we live, we live. The faith our fathers fought for, The kings our fathers knew, We fight but as they fought for: We seek the goal they sought for, The chance they hailed and knew, The praise they strove and wrought for, To leave their blood as dew On fields that flower anew. Men live that serve the stranger; Hounds live that huntsmen tame: These life-days of our living Are days of God's good giving Where death smiles soft on danger And life scowls dark on shame. And what would you do other, Sweet wife, if you were I? And how should you be other, My sister, than your brother, If you were man as I, Born of our sire and mother, With choice to cower and fly, And chance to strike and die? No churl's our oldworld name is, The lands we leave are fair: But fairer far than these are, But wide as all the seas are, But high as heaven the fame is That if we die we share. Our name the night may swallow, Our lands the churl may take: But night nor death may swallow, Nor hell's nor heaven's dim hollow, The star whose height we take, The star whose light we follow For faith's unfaltering sake Till hope that sleeps awake. Soft hope's light lure we serve not, Nor follow, fain to find: Dark time's last word may smite her Dead, ere man's falsehood blight her: But though she die, we swerve not, Who cast not eye behind. Faith speaks when hope dissembles: Faith lives when hope lies dead: If death as life dissembles, And all that night assembles Of stars at dawn lie dead, Faint hope that smiles and trembles May tell not well for dread: But faith has heard it said. Now who will fight, and fly not, And grudge not life to give? And who will strike beside us, If life's or death's light guide us? For if we live, we die not, And if we die, we live. THE BALLAD OF DEAD MEN'S BAY The sea swings owre the slants of sand, All white with winds that drive; The sea swirls up to the still dim strand, Where nae man comes alive. At the grey soft edge of the fruitless surf A light flame sinks and springs; At the grey soft rim of the flowerless turf A low flame leaps and clings. What light is this on a sunless shore, What gleam on a starless sea? Was it earth's or hell's waste womb that bore Such births as should not be? As lithe snakes turning, as bright stars burning, They bicker and beckon and call; As wild waves churning, as wild winds yearning, They flicker and climb and fall. A soft strange cry from the landward rings— “What ails the sea to shine?” A keen sweet note from the spray's rim springs— “What fires are these of thine?” A soul am I that was born on earth For ae day's waesome span: Death bound me fast on the bourn of birth Ere I were christened man. “A light by night, I fleet and fare Till the day of wrath and woe; On the hems of earth and the skirts of air Winds hurl me to and fro.” “O well is thee, though the weird be strange That bids thee flit and flee; For hope is child of the womb of change, And hope keeps watch with thee. “When the years are gone, and the time is come, God's grace may give thee grace; And thy soul may sing, though thy soul were dumb, And shine before God's face. “But I, that lighten and revel and roll With the foam of the plunging sea, No sign is mine of a breathing soul That God should pity me. “Nor death, nor heaven, nor hell, nor birth Hath part in me nor mine: Strong lords are these of the living earth And loveless lords of thine. “But I that know nor lord nor life More sure than storm or spray, Whose breath is made of sport and strife, Whereon shall I find stay?” “And wouldst thou change thy doom with me, Full fain with thee would I: For the life that lightens and lifts the sea Is more than earth or sky. “And what if the day of doubt and doom Shall save nor smite not me? I would not rise from the slain world's tomb If there be no more sea. “Take he my soul that gave my soul, And give it thee to keep; And me, while seas and stars shall roll Thy life that falls on sleep.” That word went up through the mirk mid sky, And even to God's own ear: And the Lord was ware of the keen twin cry, And wroth was he to hear. He 's tane the soul of the unsained child That fled to death from birth; He 's tane the light of the wan sea wild, And bid it burn on earth. He 's given the ghaist of the babe new-born The gift of the water-sprite, To ride on revel from morn to morn And roll from night to night He 's given the sprite of the wild wan sea The gift of the new-born man, A soul for ever to bide and be When the years have filled their span. When a year was gone and a year was come, O loud and loud cried they— “For the lee-lang year thou hast held us dumb Take now thy gifts away!” O loud and lang they cried on him, And sair and sair they prayed: “Is the face of thy grace as the night's face grim For those thy wrath has made? A cry more bitter than tears of men From the rim of the dim grey sea;— “Give me my living soul again, The soul thou gavest me, The doom and the dole of kindly men, To bide my weird and be!” A cry more keen from the wild low land Than the wail of waves that roll;— “Take back the gift of a loveless hand, Thy gift of doom and dole, The weird of men that bide on land; Take from me, take my soul!” The hands that smite are the hands that spare; They build and break the tomb; They turn to darkness and dust and air The fruits of the waste earth's womb; But never the gift of a granted prayer, The dole of a spoken doom. Winds may change at a word unheard, But none may change the tides: The prayer once heard is as God's own word; The doom once dealt abides. And ever a cry goes up by day, And ever a wail by night; And nae ship comes by the weary bay But her shipmen hear them wail and pray, And see with earthly sight The twofold flames of the twin lights play Where the sea-banks green and the sea-floods grey Are proud of peril and fain of prey, And the sand quakes ever; and ill fare they That look upon that light. DEDICATION [The sea of the years that endure not] 1893 The sea of the years that endure not Whose tide shall endure till we die And know what the seasons assure not, If death be or life be a lie, Sways hither the spirit and thither, A waif in the swing of the sea Whose wrecks are of memories that wither As leaves of a tree. We hear not and hail not with greeting The sound of the wings of the years, The storm of the sound of them beating, That none till it pass from him hears: But tempest nor calm can imperil The treasures that fade not or fly; Change bids them not change and be sterile, Death bids them not die. Hearts plighted in youth to the royal High service of hope and of song, Sealed fast for endurance as loyal, And proved of the years as they throng, Conceive not, believe not, and fear not That age may be other than youth; That faith and that friendship may hear not And utter not truth. Not yesterday's light nor to-morrow's Gleams nearer or clearer than gleams, Though joys be forgotten and sorrows Forgotten as changes of dreams, The dawn of the days unforgotten That noon could eclipse not or slay, Whose fruits were as children begotten Of dawn upon day. The years that were flowerful and fruitless, The years that were fruitful and dark, The hopes that were radiant and rootless, The hopes that were winged for their mark, Lie soft in the sepulchres fashioned Of hours that arise and subside, Absorbed and subdued and impassioned, In pain or in pride. But far in the night that entombs them The starshine as sunshine is strong, And clear through the cloud that resumes them Remembrance, a light and a song, Rings lustrous as music and hovers As birds that impend on the sea, And thoughts that their prison-house covers Arise and are free. Forgetfulness deep as a prison Holds days that are dead for us fast Till the sepulchre sees rearisen The spirit whose reign is the past, Disentrammelled of darkness, and kindled With life that is mightier than death, When the life that obscured it has dwindled And passed as a breath. But time nor oblivion may darken Remembrance whose name will be joy While memory forgets not to hearken, While manhood forgets not the boy Who heard and exulted in hearing The songs of the sunrise of youth Ring radiant above him, unfearing And joyous as truth. Truth, winged and enkindled with rapture And sense of the radiance of yore, Fulfilled you with power to recapture What never might singer before— The life, the delight, and the sorrow Of troublous and chivalrous years That knew not of night or of morrow, Of hopes or of fears. But wider the wing and the vision That quicken the spirit have spread Since memory beheld with derision Man's hope to be more than his dead. From the mists and the snows and the thunders Your spirit has brought for us forth Light, music, and joy in the wonders And charms of the north. The wars and the woes and the glories That quicken and lighten and rain From the clouds of its chronicled stories, The passion, the pride, and the pain, Whose echoes were mute and the token Was lost of the spells that they spake, Rise bright at your bidding, unbroken Of ages that break. For you, and for none of us other, Time is not: the dead that must live Hold commune with you as a brother By grace of the life that you give. The heart that was in them is in you, Their soul in your spirit endures: The strength of their song is the sinew Of this that is yours. Hence is it that life, everlasting As light and as music, abides In the sound of the surge of it, casting Sound back to the surge of the tides, Till sons of the sons of the Norsemen Watch, hurtling to windward and lee, Round England, unbacked of her horsemen, The steeds of the sea. A CHANNEL PASSAGE AND OTHER POEMS IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM MORRIS AND EDWARD BURNE JONES A CHANNEL PASSAGE 1855 Forth from Calais, at dawn of night, when sunset summer on autumn shone, Fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone: Soft and sweet as the sky they smiled, and bade man welcome: a dim sweet hour Gleamed and whispered in wind and sea, and heaven was fair as a field in flower Stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music: the starbright air Made the face of the sea, if aught may make the face of the sea, more fair. Whence came change? Was the sweet night weary of rest? What anguish awoke in the dark? Sudden, sublime, the strong storm spake: we heard the thunders as hounds that bark. Lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars, we saw the lightnings exalt the sky, Living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die. Heaven's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire: Thunder on thunder exulted, rejoicing to live and to satiate the night's desire. And the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free: And a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea. All the weight of the wind bore down on it, freighted with death for fraught: And the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught. And madness fell on them laughing and leaping; and madness came on the wind: And the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of Ind. Such glory, such terror, such passion, as lighten and harrow the far fierce East, Rang, shone, spake, shuddered around us: the night was an altar with death for priest. The channel that sunders England from shores where never was man born free Was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea. As a wild steed ramps in rebellion, and rears till it swerves from a backward fall, The strong ship struggled and reared, and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff's wall. Stern and prow plunged under, alternate: a glimpse, a recoil, a breath, And she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the throat of death. Three glad hours, and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal joy, Filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird's heart in a boy. For the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed, sublime As the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time. The glory beholden of man in a vision, the music of light overheard, The rapture and radiance of battle, the life that abides in the fire of a word, In the midmost heaven enkindled, was manifest far on the face of the sea, And the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free. Far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky laughed out into light From the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white. The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade From the cloud's black base to the black wave's brim rejoiced in the light they made. Far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in lustrous tune, Shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the steadfast smile of the moon. The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold, and deep As life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine on the soul through sleep. All glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know Bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship, above and below. The joys of the lightnings, the songs of the thunders, the strong sea's labour and rage, Were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to wage. No thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night made bare, Illimitable, infinite, awful and joyful, alive in the summit of air— Air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea's, Rebellious, rapturous, and transient as faith or as terror that bows men's knees. No love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams Than the world shone then, when the sky and the sea were as love for a breath's length seems— One utterly, mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides As the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm, and released the tides. In the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering, assailed and withheld As a soul born royal, if life or if death be against it, is thwarted and quelled. As the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn Were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn. A thousand Phosphors, a thousand Hespers, awoke in the churning sea, And the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a tune could be; As a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep, Audible alway alive in the storm, too fleet for a dream to keep: Too fleet, too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember awake: Light subtler and swifter than lightning, that whispers and laughs in the live storm's wake, In the wild bright wake of the storm, in the dense loud heart of the labouring hour, A harvest of stars by the storm's hand reaped, each fair as a star-shaped flower. And sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed When the light and the sound of it sank, and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed. The glory, the terror, the passion that made of the midnight a miracle, died, Not slain at a stroke, nor in gradual reluctance abated of power and of pride; With strong swift subsidence, awful as power that is wearied of power upon earth, As a God that were wearied of power upon heaven, and were fain of a new God's birth, The might of the night subsided: the tyranny kindled in darkness fell: And the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of heaven and of hell. The waters, heaving and hungering at heart, made way, and were wellnigh fain, For the ship that had fought them, and wrestled, and revelled in labour, to cease from her pain. And an end was made of it: only remembrance endures of the glad loud strife; And the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the passage of life. THE LAKE OF GAUBE The sun is lord and god, sublime, serene, And sovereign on the mountains: earth and air Lie prone in passion, blind with bliss unseen By force of sight and might of rapture, fair As dreams that die and know not what they were. The lawns, the gorges, and the peaks, are one Glad glory, thrilled with sense of unison In strong compulsive silence of the sun. Flowers dense and keen as midnight stars aflame And living things of light like flames in flower That glance and flash as though no hand might tame Lightnings whose life outshone their stormlit hour And played and laughed on earth, with all their power Gone, and with all their joy of life made long And harmless as the lightning life of song, Shine sweet like stars when darkness feels them strong. The deep mild purple flaked with moonbright gold That makes the scales seem flowers of hardened light, The flamelike tongue, the feet that noon leaves cold, The kindly trust in man, when once the sight Grew less than strange, and faith bade fear take flight, Outlive the little harmless life that shone And gladdened eyes that loved it, and was gone Ere love might fear that fear had looked thereon. Fear held the bright thing hateful, even as fear, Whose name is one with hate and horror, saith That heaven, the dark deep heaven of water near, Is deadly deep as hell and dark as death. The rapturous plunge that quickens blood and breath With pause more sweet than passion, ere they strive To raise again the limbs that yet would dive Deeper, should there have slain the soul alive. As the bright salamander in fire of the noonshine exults and is glad of his day, The spirit that quickens my body rejoices to pass from the sunlight away, To pass from the glow of the mountainous flowerage, the high multitudinous bloom, Far down through the fathomless night of the water, the gladness of silence and gloom. Death-dark and delicious as death in the dream of a lover and dreamer may be, It clasps and encompasses body and soul with delight to be living and free: Free utterly now, though the freedom endure but the space of a perilous breath, And living, though girdled about with the darkness and coldness and strangeness of death: Each limb and each pulse of the body rejoicing, each nerve of the spirit at rest, All sense of the soul's life rapture, a passionate peace in its blindness blest. So plunges the downward swimmer, embraced of the water unfathomed of man, The darkness unplummeted, icier than seas in midwinter, for blessing or ban; And swiftly and sweetly, when strength and breath fall short, and the dive is done, Shoots up as a shaft from the dark depth shot, sped straight into sight of the sun; And sheer through the snow-soft water, more dark than the roof of the pines above, Strikes forth, and is glad as a bird whose flight is impelled and sustained of love. As a sea-mew's love of the sea-wind breasted and ridden for rapture's sake Is the love of his body and soul for the darkling delight of the soundless lake: As the silent speed of a dream too living to live for a thought's space more Is the flight of his limbs through the still strong chill of the darkness from shore to shore. Might life be as this is and death be as life that casts off time as a robe, The likeness of infinite heaven were a symbol revealed of the lake of Gaube. Whose thought has fathomed and measured The darkness of life and of death, The secret within them treasured, The spirit that is not breath? Whose vision has yet beholden The splendour of death and of life? Though sunset as dawn be golden, Is the word of them peace, not strife? Deep silence answers: the glory We dream of may be but a dream, And the sun of the soul wax hoary As ashes that show not a gleam. But well shall it be with us ever Who drive through the darkness here, If the soul that we live by never, For aught that a lie saith, fear. THE PROMISE OF THE HAWTHORN Spring sleeps and stirs and trembles with desire Pure as a babe's that nestles toward the breast. The world, as yet an all unstricken lyre, With all its chords alive and all at rest, Feels not the sun's hand yet, but feels his breath And yearns for love made perfect. Man and bird, Thrilled through with hope of life that casts out death, Wait with a rapturous patience till his word Speak heaven, and flower by flower and tree by tree Give back the silent strenuous utterance. Earth, Alive awhile and joyful as the sea, Laughs not aloud in joy too deep for mirth, Presageful of perfection of delight, Till all the unborn green buds be born in white. HAWTHORN TIDE I Dawn is alive in the world, and the darkness of heaven and of earth Subsides in the light of a smile more sweet than the loud noon's mirth, Spring lives as a babe lives, glad and divine as the sun, and unsure If aught so divine and so glad may be worshipped and loved and endure. A soft green glory suffuses the love-lit earth with delight, And the face of the noon is fair as the face of the star-clothed night. Earth knows not and doubts not at heart of the glories again to be: Sleep doubts not and dreams not how sweet shall the waking beyond her be. A whole white world of revival awaits May's whisper awhile, Abides and exults in the bud as a soft hushed laugh in a smile. As a maid's mouth laughing with love and subdued for the love's sake, May Shines and withholds for a little the word she revives to say. When the clouds and the winds and the sunbeams are warring and strengthening with joy that they live, Spring, from reluctance enkindled to rapture, from slumber to strife, Stirs, and repents, and is winter, and weeps, and awakes as the frosts forgive, And the dark chill death of the woodland is troubled, and dies into life. And the honey of heaven, of the hives whence night feeds full on the springtide's breath, Fills fuller the lips of the lustrous air with delight in the dawn: Each blossom enkindling with love that is life and subsides with a smile into death Arises and lightens and sets as a star from her sphere withdrawn. Not sleep, in the rapture of radiant dreams, when sundawn smiles on the night, Shows earth so sweet with a splendour and fragrance of life that is love: Each blade of the glad live grass, each bud that receives or rejects the light, Salutes and responds to the marvel of Maytime around and above. Joy gives thanks for the sight and the savour of heaven, and is humbled With awe that exults in thanksgiving: the towers of the flowers of the trees Shine sweeter than snows that the hand of the season has melted and crumbled, And fair as the foam that is lesser of life than the loveliest of these. But the sense of a life more lustrous with joy and enkindled of glory Than man's was ever or may be, and briefer than joys most brief, Bids man's heart bend and adore, be the man's head golden or hoary, As it leapt but a breath's time since and saluted the flower and the leaf. The rapture that springs into love at the sight of the world's exultation Takes not a sense of rebuke from the sense of triumphant awe: But the spirit that quickens the body fulfils it with mute adoration, And the knees would fain bow down as the eyes that rejoiced and saw. II Fair and sublime as the face of the dawn is the splendour of May, But the sky's and the sea's joy fades not as earth's pride passes away. Yet hardly the sun's first lightning or laughter of love on the sea So humbles the heart into worship that knows not or doubts if it be As the first full glory beholden again of the life newborn That hails and applauds with inaudible music the season of morn. A day's length since, and it was not: a night's length more, and the sun Salutes and enkindles a world of delight as a strange world won. A new life answers and thrills to the kiss of the young strong year, And the glory we see is as music we hear not, and dream that we hear. From blossom to blossom the live tune kindles, from tree to tree, And we know not indeed if we hear not the song of the life we see. For the first blithe day that beholds it and worships and cherishes cannot but sing With a louder and lustier delight in the sun and the sunlit earth Than the joy of the days that beheld but the soft green dawn of the slow faint spring Glad and afraid to be glad, and subdued in a shamefast mirth. When the first bright knoll of the woodland world laughs out into fragrant light, The year's heart changes and quickens with sense of delight in desire, And the kindling desire is one with thanksgiving for utter fruition of sight, For sight and for sense of a world that the sun finds meet for his lyre. Music made of the morning that smites from the chords of the mute world song Trembles and quickens and lightens, unfelt, unbeholden, unheard, From blossom on blossom that climbs and exults in the strength of the sun grown strong, And answers the word of the wind of the spring with the sun's own word. Hard on the skirt of the deep soft copses that spring refashions, Triumphs and towers to the height of the crown of a wildwood tree One royal hawthorn, sublime and serene as the joy that impassions Awe that exults in thanksgiving for sight of the grace we see, The grace that is given of a god that abides for a season, mysterious And merciful, fervent and fugitive, seen and unknown and adored: His presence is felt in the light and the fragrance, elate and imperious, His laugh and his breath in the blossom are love's, the beloved soul's lord. For surely the soul if it loves is beloved of the god as a lover Whose love is not all unaccepted, a worship not utterly vain: So full, so deep is the joy that revives for the soul to recover Yearly, beholden of hope and of memory in sunshine and rain. III Wonder and love stand silent, stricken at heart and stilled. But yet is the cup of delight and of worship unpledged and unfilled. A handsbreadth hence leaps up, laughs out as an angel crowned, A strong full fountain of flowers overflowing above and around. The boughs and the blossoms in triumph salute with adoring mirth The womb that bare them, the glad green mother, the sunbright earth. Downward sweeping, as song subsides into silence, none May hear what sound is the word's they speak to the brooding sun. None that hearken may hear: man may but pass and adore, And humble his heart in thanksgiving for joy that is now no more. And sudden, afront and ahead of him, joy is alive and aflame On the shrine whose incense is given of the godhead, again the same Pale and pure as a maiden secluded in secret and cherished with fear, One sweet glad hawthorn smiles as it shrinks under shelter, screened By two strong brethren whose bounteous blossom outsoars it, year after year, While earth still cleaves to the live spring's breast as a babe unweaned. Never was amaranth fairer in fields where heroes of old found rest, Never was asphodel sweeter: but here they endure not long, Though ever the sight that salutes them again and adores them awhile is blest, And the heart is a hymn, and the sense is a soul, and the soul is a song. Alone on a dyke's trenched edge, and afar from the blossoming wildwood's verge, Laughs and lightens a sister, triumphal in love-lit pride; Clothed round with the sun, and inviolate: her blossoms exult as the springtide surge, When the wind and the dawn enkindle the snows of the shoreward tide. Hardly the worship of old that rejoiced as it knelt in the vision Shown of the God new-born whose breath is the spirit of spring Hailed ever with love more strong and defiant of death's derision A joy more perfect than here we mourn for as May takes wing. Time gives it and takes it again and restores it: the glory, the wonder, The triumph of lustrous blossom that makes of the steep sweet bank One visible marvel of music inaudible, over and under, Attuned as in heaven, pass hence and return for the sun to thank. The stars and the sun give thanks for the glory bestowed and beholden, For the gladness they give and rejoice in, the night and the dawn and the day: But nought they behold when the world is aflower and the season is golden Makes answer as meet and as sweet as the flower that itself is May. THE PASSING OF THE HAWTHORN The coming of the hawthorn brings on earth Heaven: all the spring speaks out in one sweet word, And heaven grows gladder, knowing that earth has heard. Ere half the flowers are jubilant in birth, The splendour of the laughter of their mirth Dazzles delight with wonder: man and bird Rejoice and worship, stilled at heart and stirred With rapture girt about with awe for girth. The passing of the hawthorn takes away Heaven: all the spring falls dumb, and all the soul Sinks down in man for sorrow. Night and day Forego the joy that made them one and whole. The change that falls on every starry spray Bids, flower by flower, the knell of springtime toll. TO A BABY KINSWOMAN Love, whose light thrills heaven and earth, Smiles and weeps upon thy birth, Child, whose mother's love-lit eyes Watch thee but from Paradise. Sweetest sight that earth can give, Sweetest light of eyes that live, Ours must needs, for hope withdrawn, Hail with tears thy soft spring dawn. Light of hope whose star hath set, Light of love whose sun lives yet, Holier, happier, heavenlier love Breathes about thee, burns above, Surely, sweet, than ours can be, Shed from eyes we may not see, Though thine own may see them shine Night and day, perchance, on thine. Sun and moon that lighten earth Seem not fit to bless thy birth: Scarce the very stars we know Here seem bright enough to show Whence in unimagined skies Glows the vigil of such eyes. Theirs whose heart is as a sea Swoln with sorrowing love of thee Fain would share with thine the sight Seen alone of babes aright, Watched of eyes more sweet than flowers Sleeping or awake: but ours Can but deem or dream or guess Thee not wholly motherless. Might they see or might they know What nor faith nor hope may show, We whose hearts yearn toward thee now Then were blest and wise as thou. Had we half thy knowledge,—had Love such wisdom,—grief were glad, Surely, lit by grace of thee; Life were sweet as death may be. Now the law that lies on men Bids us mourn our dead: but then Heaven and life and earth and death, Quickened as by God's own breath, All were turned from sorrow and strife: Earth and death were heaven and life. All too far are then and now Sundered: none may be as thou. Yet this grace is ours—a sign Of that goodlier grace of thine, Sweet, and thine alone—to see Heaven, and heaven's own love, in thee. Bless them, then, whose eyes caress Thee, as only thou canst bless. Comfort, faith, assurance, love, Shine around us, brood above, Fear grows hope, and hope grows wise, Thrilled and lit by children's eyes. Yet in ours the tears unshed, Child, for hope that death leaves dead, Needs must burn and tremble; thou Knowest not, seest not, why nor how, More than we know whence or why Comes on babes that laugh and lie Half asleep, in sweet-lipped scorn, Light of smiles outlightening morn, Whence enkindled as is earth By the dawn's less radiant birth All the body soft and sweet Smiles on us from face to feet When the rose-red hands would fain Reach the rose-red feet in vain. Eyes and hands that worship thee Watch and tend, adore and see All these heavenly sights, and give Thanks to see and love and live. Yet, of all that hold thee dear, Sweet, the dearest smiles not here. Thine alone is now the grace, Haply, still to see her face; Thine, thine only now the sight Whence we dream thine own takes light. Yet, though faith and hope live blind, Yet they live in heart and mind Strong and keen as truth may be: Yet, though blind as grief were we Inly for a weeping-while, Sorrow's self before thy smile Smiles and softens, knowing that yet, Far from us though heaven be set, Love, bowed down for thee to bless, Dares not call thee motherless.

Eum. 538–544 ???? ?? ??? ?????. Æsch. Cho. 972 I Light and night, whose clouds and glories change and mingle and divide, Veil the truth whereof they witness, show the truth of things they hide. Through the darkness and the splendour of the centuries, loud or dumb, Shines and wanes and shines the spirit, lit with love of life to come. Man, the soul made flesh, that knows not death from life, and fain would know, Sees the face of time change colour as its tides recoil and flow. All his hope and fear and faith and doubt, if aught at all they be, Live the life of clouds and sunbeams, born of heaven or earth or sea. All are buoyed and blown and brightened by their hour's evasive breath: All subside and quail and darken when their hour is done to death. Yet, ere faith, a wandering water, froze and curdled into creeds, Earth, elate as heaven, adored the light that quickens dreams to deeds. Invisible: eye hath not seen it, and ear hath not heard as the spirit hath heard From the shrine that is lit not of sunlight or starlight the sound of a limitless word. And visible: none that hath eyes to behold what the spirit must perish or see Can choose but behold it and worship: a shrine that if light were as darkness would be. Of cloud and of change is the form of the fashion that man may behold of it wrought: Of iron and truth is the mystic mid altar, where worship is none but of thought. No prayer may go up to it, climbing as incense of gladness or sorrow may climb: No rapture of music may ruffle the silence that guards it, and hears not of time. As the winds of the wild blind ages alternate in passion of light and of cloud, So changes the shape of the veil that enshrouds it with darkness and light for a shroud. And the winds and the clouds and the suns fall silent, and fade out of hearing or sight, And the shrine stands fast and is changed not, whose likeness was changed as a cloud in the night. All the storms of time, and wrath of many winds, may carve no trace On the viewless altar, though the veil bear many a name and face: Many a live God's likeness woven, many a scripture dark with awe, Bids the veil seem verier iron than the word of life's own law. Till the might of change hath rent it with a rushing wind in twain, Stone or steel it seems, whereon the wrath of chance is wreaked in vain: Stone or steel, and all behind it or beyond its lifted sign Cloud and vapour, no subsistence of a change-unstricken shrine. God by god flits past in thunder, till his glories turn to shades: God to god bears wondering witness how his gospel flames and fades. More was each of these, while yet they were, than man their servant seemed: Dead are all of these, and man survives who made them while he dreamed. Yet haply or surely, if vision were surer than theirs who rejoiced that they saw, Man might not but see, through the darkness of godhead, the light that is surety and law. On the stone that the close-drawn cloud which veils it awhile makes cloudlike stands The word of the truth everlasting, unspoken of tongues and unwritten of hands. By the sunbeams and storms of the centuries engraven, and approved of the soul as it reads, It endures as a token dividing the light from the darkness of dreams and of deeds. The faces of gods on the face of it carven, or gleaming behind and above, Star-glorified Uranus, thunderous Jehovah, for terror or worship or love, Change, wither, and brighten as flowers that the wind of eternity sheds upon time, All radiant and transient and awful and mortal, and leave it unmarred and sublime. As the tides that return and recede are the fears and the hopes of the centuries that roll, Requenched and rekindled: but strong as the sun is the sense of it shrined in the soul. II In the days when time was not, in the time when days were none, Ere sorrow had life to lot, ere earth gave thanks for the sun, Ere man in his darkness waking adored what the soul in him could, And the manifold God of his making was manifest evil and good, One law from the dim beginning abode and abides in the end, In sight of him sorrowing and sinning with none but his faith for friend. Dark were the shadows around him, and darker the glories above, Ere light from beyond them found him, and bade him for love's sake love. About him was darkness, and under and over him darkness: the night That conceived him and bore him had thunder for utterance and lightning for light. The dust of death was the dust of the ways that the tribes of him trod: And he knew not if just or unjust were the might of the mystery of God. Strange horror and hope, strange faith and unfaith, were his boon and his bane: And the God of his trust was the wraith of the soul or the ghost of it slain. A curse was on death as on birth, and a Presence that shone as a sword Shed menace from heaven upon earth that beheld him, and hailed him her Lord. Sublime and triumphant as fire or as lightning, he kindled the skies, And withered with dread the desire that would look on the light of his eyes. Earth shuddered with worship, and knew not if hell were not hot in her breath; If birth were not sin, and the dew of the morning the sweat of her death. The watchwords of evil and good were unspoken of men and unheard: They were shadows that willed as he would, that were made and unmade by his word. His word was darkness and light, and a wisdom that makes men mad Sent blindness upon them for sight, that they saw but and heard as he bade. Cast forth and corrupt from the birth by the crime of creation, they stood Convicted of evil on earth by the grace of a God found good. The grace that enkindled and quickened the darkness of hell with flame Bade man, though the soul in him sickened, obey, and give praise to his name. The still small voice of the spirit whose life is as plague's hot breath Bade man shed blood, and inherit the life of the kingdom of death. “Bring now for blood-offering thy son to mine altar, and bind him and slay, That the sin of my bidding be done”: and the soul in the slave said, “Yea.” Yea, not nay, was the word: and the sacrifice offered withal Was neither of beast nor of bird, but the soul of a man, God's thrall. And the word of his servant spoken was fire, and the light of a sword, When the bondage of Israel was broken, and Sinai shrank from the Lord. With splendour of slaughter and thunder of song as the sound of the sea Were the foes of him stricken in sunder and silenced as storms that flee. Terror and trust and the pride of the chosen, approved of his choice, Saw God in the whirlwind ride, and rejoiced as the winds rejoice. Subdued and exalted and kindled and quenched by the sense of his might, Faith flamed and exulted and dwindled, and saw not, and clung to the sight. The wastes of the wilderness brightened and trembled with rapture and dread When the word of him thundered and lightened and spake through the quick and the dead. The chant of the prophetess, louder and loftier than tempest and wave, Rang triumph more ruthless and prouder than death, and profound as the grave. And sweet as the moon's word spoken in smiles that the blown clouds mar The psalmist's witness in token arose as the speech of a star. Starlight supreme, and the tender desire of the moon, were as one To rebuke with compassion the splendour and strength of the godlike sun. God softened and changed: and the word of his chosen, a fire at the first, Bade man, as a beast or a bird, now slake at the springs his thirst. The souls that were sealed unto death as the bones of the dead lie sealed Rose thrilled and redeemed by the breath of the dawn on the flame-lit field. The glories of darkness, cloven with music of thunder, shrank As the web of the word was unwoven that spake, and the soul's tide sank. And the starshine of midnight that covered Arabia with light as a robe Waxed fiery with utterance that hovered and flamed through the whirlwind on Job. And prophet to prophet and vision to vision made answer sublime, Till the valley of doom and decision was merged in the tides of time. III Then, soft as the dews of night, As the star of the sundawn bright, As the heart of the sea's hymn deep, And sweet as the balm of sleep, Arose on the world a light Too pure for the skies to keep. With music sweeter and stranger than heaven had heard When the dark east thrilled with light from a saviour's word And a God grew man to endure as a man and abide The doom of the will of the Lord of the loud world's tide, Whom thunders utter, and tempest and darkness hide, With larger light than flamed from the peak whereon Prometheus, bound as the sun to the world's wheel, shone, A presence passed and abode but on earth a span, And love's own light as a river before him ran, And the name of God for awhile upon earth was man. O star that wast not and wast for the world a sun, O light that was quenched of priests, and its work undone, O Word that wast not as man's or as God's, if God Be Lord but of hosts whose tread was as death's that trod On souls that felt but his wrath as an unseen rod, What word, what praise, what passion of hopeless prayer, May now rise up to thee, loud as in years that were, From years that gaze on the works of thy servants wrought While strength was in them to satiate the lust of thought That craved in thy name for blood as the quest it sought? From the dark high places of Rome Far over the westward foam God's heaven and the sun saw swell The fires of the high priest's hell, And shrank as they curled and clomb And revelled and ravaged and fell. IV Yet was not the work of thy word all withered with wasting flame By the sons of the priests that had slain thee, whose evil was wrought in thy name. From the blood-sodden soil that was blasted with fires of the Church and her creed Sprang rarely but surely, by grace of thy spirit, a flower for a weed. Thy spirit, unfelt of thy priests who blasphemed thee, enthralled and enticed To deathward a child that was even as the child we behold in Christ. The Moors, they told her, beyond bright Spain and the strait brief sea, Dwelt blind in the light that for them was as darkness, and knew not thee. But the blood of the martyrs whose mission was witness for God, they said, Might raise to redemption the souls that were here, in the sun's sight, dead. And the child rose up in the night, when the stars were as friends that smiled, And sought her brother, and wakened the younger and tenderer child. From the heaven of a child's glad sleep to the heaven of the sight of her eyes He woke, and brightened and hearkened, and kindled as stars that rise. And forth they fared together to die for the stranger's sake, For the souls of the slayers that should slay them, and turn from their sins, and wake. And the light of the love that lit them awhile on a brief blind quest Shines yet on the tear-lit smile that salutes them, belated and blest. And the girl, full-grown to the stature of godhead in womanhood, spake The word that sweetens and lightens her creed for her great love's sake. From the godlike heart of Theresa the prayer above all prayers heard, The cry as of God made woman, a sweet blind wonderful word, Sprang sudden as flame, and kindled the darkness of faith with love, And the hollow of hell from beneath shone, quickened of heaven from above. Yea, hell at her word grew heaven, as she prayed that if God thought well She there might stand in the gateway, that none might pass into hell. Not Hermes, guardian and guide, God, herald, and comforter, shed Such lustre of hope from the life of his light on the night of the dead. Not Pallas, wiser and mightier in mercy than Rome's God shone, Wore ever such raiment of love as the soul of a saint put on. So blooms as a flower of the darkness a star of the midnight born, Of the midnight's womb and the blackness of darkness, and flames like morn. Nor yet may the dawn extinguish or hide it, when churches and creeds Are withered and blasted with sunlight as poisonous and blossomless weeds. So springs and strives through the soil that the legions of darkness have trod, From the root that is man, from the soul in the body, the flower that is God. V Ages and creeds that drift Through change and cloud uplift The soul that soars and seeks her sovereign shrine, Her faith's veiled altar, there To find, when praise and prayer Fall baffled, if the darkness be divine. Lights change and shift through star and sun: Night, clothed with might of immemorial years, is one. Day, born and slain of night, Hath hardly life in sight As she that bears and slays him and survives, And gives us back for one Cloud-thwarted fiery sun The myriad mysteries of the lambent lives Whose starry soundless music saith That light and life wax perfect even through night and death. In vain had darkness heard Light speak the lustrous word That cast out faith in all save truth and love: In vain death's quickening rod Bade man rise up as God, Touched as with life unknown in heaven above: Fear turned his light of love to fire That wasted earth, yet might not slay the soul's desire. Though death seem life, and night Bid fear call darkness light, Time, faith, and hope keep trust, through sorrow and shame, Till Christ, by Paul cast out, Return, and all the rout Of raging slaves whose prayer defiles his name Rush headlong to the deep, and die, And leave no sign to say that faith once heard them lie. VI Since man, with a child's pride proud, and abashed as a child and afraid, Made God in his likeness, and bowed him to worship the Maker he made, No faith more dire hath enticed man's trust than the saint's whose creed Made Caiaphas one with Christ, that worms on the cross might feed. Priests gazed upon God in the eyes of a babe new-born, and therein Beheld not heaven, and the wise glad secret of love, but sin. Accursed of heaven, and baptized with the baptism of hatred and hell, They spat on the name they despised and adored as a sign and a spell. “Lord Christ, thou art God, and a liar: they were children of wrath, not of grace, Unbaptized, unredeemed from the fire they were born for, who smiled in thy face.” Of such is the kingdom—he said it—of heaven: and the heavenly word Shall live when religion is dead, and when falsehood is dumb shall be heard. And the message of James and of John was as Christ's and as love's own call: But wrath passed sentence thereon when Annas replied in Paul. The dark old God who had slain him grew one with the Christ he slew, And poison was rank in the grain that with growth of his gospel grew. And the blackness of darkness brightened: and red in the heart of the flame Shone down, as a blessing that lightened, the curse of a new God's name. Through centuries of burning and trembling belief as a signal it shone, Till man, soul-sick of dissembling, bade fear and her frauds begone. God Cerberus yelps from his throats triune: but his day, which was night, Is quenched, with its stars and the notes of its night-birds, in silence and light. The flames of its fires and the psalms of their psalmists are darkened and dumb: Strong winter has withered the palms of his angels, and stricken them numb. God, father of lies, God, son of perdition, God, spirit of ill, Thy will that for ages was done is undone as a dead God's will. Not Mahomet's sword could slay thee, nor Borgia's or Calvin's praise: But the scales of the spirit that weigh thee are weighted with truth, and it slays. The song of the day of thy fury, when nature and death shall quail, Rings now as the thunders of Jewry, the ghost of a dead world's tale. That day and its doom foreseen and foreshadowed on earth, when thou, Lord God, wast lord of the keen dark season, are sport for us now. Thy claws were clipped and thy fangs plucked out by the hands that slew Men, lovers of man, whose pangs bore witness if truth were true. Man crucified rose again from the sepulchre builded to be No grave for the souls of the men who denied thee, but, Lord, for thee. When Bruno's spirit aspired from the flames that thy servants fed, The spirit of faith was fired to consume thee and leave thee dead. When the light of the sunlike eyes whence laughter lightened and flamed Bade France and the world be wise, faith saw thee naked and shamed. When wisdom deeper and sweeter than Rabelais veiled and revealed Found utterance diviner and meeter for truth whence anguish is healed, Whence fear and hate and belief in thee, fed by thy grace from above, Fall stricken, and utmost grief takes light from the lustre of love, When Shakespeare shone into birth, and the world he beheld grew bright, Thy kingdom was ended on earth, and the darkness it shed was light. In him all truth and the glory thereof and the power and the pride, The song of the soul and her story, bore witness that fear had lied. All hope, all wonder, all trust, all doubt that knows not of fear, The love of the body, the lust of the spirit to see and to hear, All womanhood, fairer than love could conceive or desire or adore, All manhood, radiant above all heights that it held of yore, Lived by the life of his breath, with the speech of his soul's will spake, And the light lit darkness to death whence never the dead shall wake. For the light that lived in the sound of the song of his speech was one With the light of the wisdom that found earth's tune in the song of the sun; His word with the word of the lord most high of us all on earth, Whose soul was a lyre and a sword, whose death was a deathless birth. Him too we praise as we praise our own who as he stand strong; Him, Æschylus, ancient of days, whose word is the perfect song. When Caucasus showed to the sun and the sea what a God could endure, When wisdom and light were one, and the hands of the matricide pure, A song too subtle for psalmist or prophet of Jewry to know, Elate and profound as the calmest or stormiest of waters that flow, A word whose echoes were wonder and music of fears overcome, Bade Sinai bow, and the thunder of godhead on Horeb be dumb. The childless children of night, strong daughters of doom and dread, The thoughts and the fears that smite the soul, and its life lies dead, Stood still and were quelled by the sound of his word and the light of his thought, And the God that in man lay bound was unbound from the bonds he had wrought. Dark fear of a lord more dark than the dreams of his worshippers knew Fell dead, and the corpse lay stark in the sunlight of truth shown true. VII Time, and truth his child, though terror set earth and heaven at odds, See the light of manhood rise on the twilight of the Gods. Light is here for souls to see, though the stars of faith be dead: All the sea that yearned and trembled receives the sun instead. All the shadows on the spirit when fears and dreams were strong, All perdition, all redemption, blind rain-stars watched so long, Love whose root was fear, thanksgiving that cowered beneath the rod, Feel the light that heals and withers: night weeps upon her God. All the names wherein the incarnate Lord lived his day and died Fade from suns to stars, from stars into darkness undescried. Christ the man lives yet, remembered of man as dreams that leave Light on eyes that wake and know not if memory bid them grieve. Fire sublime as lightning shines, and exults in thunder yet, Where the battle wields the name and the sword of Mahomet. Far above all wars and gospels, all ebb and flow of time, Lives the soul that speaks in silence, and makes mute earth sublime. Still for her, though years and ages be blinded and bedinned, Mazed with lightnings, crazed with thunders, life rides and guides the wind. Death may live or death may die, and the truth be light or night: Not for gain of heaven may man put away the rule of right. A NEW YEAR'S EVE Christina Rossetti died December 29, 1894 The stars are strong in the deeps of the lustrous night, Cold and splendid as death if his dawn be bright; Cold as the cast-off garb that is cold as clay, Splendid and strong as a spirit intense as light. A soul more sweet than the morning of new-born May Has passed with the year that has passed from the world away. A song more sweet than the morning's first-born song Again will hymn not among us a new year's day. Not here, not here shall the carol of joy grown strong Ring rapture now, and uplift us, a spell-struck throng, From dream to vision of life that the soul may see By death's grace only, if death do its trust no wrong. Scarce yet the days and the starry nights are three Since here among us a spirit abode as we, Girt round with life that is fettered in bonds of time, And clasped with darkness about as is earth with sea. And now, more high than the vision of souls may climb, The soul whose song was as music of stars that chime, Clothed round with life as of dawn and the mounting sun, Sings, and we know not here of the song sublime. No word is ours of it now that the songs are done Whence here we drank of delight as in freedom won, In deep deliverance given from the bonds we bore. There is none to sing as she sang upon earth, not one. We heard awhile: and for us who shall hear no more The sound as of waves of light on a starry shore Awhile bade brighten and yearn as a father's face The face of death, divine as in days of yore. The grey gloom quickened and quivered: the sunless place Thrilled, and the silence deeper than time or space Seemed now not all everlasting. Hope grew strong, And love took comfort, given of the sweet song's grace. Love that finds not on earth, where it finds but wrong, Love that bears not the bondage of years in throng Shone to show for her, higher than the years that mar, The life she looked and longed for as love must long. Who knows? We know not. Afar, if the dead be far, Alive, if the dead be alive as the soul's works are, The soul whose breath was among us a heavenward song Sings, loves, and shines as it shines for us here a star. IN A ROSARY Through the low grey archway children's feet that pass Quicken, glad to find the sweetest haunt of all. Brightest wildflowers gleaming deep in lustiest grass, Glorious weeds that glisten through the green sea's glass, Match not now this marvel, born to fade and fall. Roses like a rainbow wrought of roses rise Right and left and forward, shining toward the sun. Nay, the rainbow lit of sunshine droops and dies Ere we dream it hallows earth and seas and skies; Ere delight may dream it lives, its life is done. Round the border hemmed with high deep hedges round Go the children, peering over or between Where the dense bright oval wall of box inwound, Reared about the roses fast within it bound, Gives them grace to glance at glories else unseen. Flower outlightening flower and tree outflowering tree Feed and fill the sense and spirit full with joy. Nought awhile they know of outer earth and sea: Here enough of joy it is to breathe and be: Here the sense of life is one for girl and boy. Heaven above them, bright as children's eyes or dreams, Earth about them, sweet as glad soft sleep can show Earth and sky and sea, a world that scarcely seems Even in children's eyes less fair than life that gleams Through the sleep that none but sinless eyes may know. Near beneath, and near above, the terraced ways Wind or stretch and bask or blink against the sun. Hidden here from sight on soft or stormy days Lies and laughs with love toward heaven, at silent gaze, All the radiant rosary—all its flowers made one. All the multitude of roses towering round Dawn and noon and night behold as one full flower, Fain of heaven and loved of heaven, curbed and crowned, Raised and reared to make this plot of earthly ground Heavenly, could but heaven endure on earth an hour. Swept away, made nothing now for ever, dead, Still the rosary lives and shines on memory, free Now from fear of death or change as childhood, fled Years on years before its last live leaves were shed: None may mar it now, as none may stain the sea. THE HIGH OAKS Barking Hall, July 19th, 1896 Fourscore years and seven Light and dew from heaven Have fallen with dawn on these glad woods each day Since here was born, even here, A birth more bright and dear Than ever a younger year Hath seen or shall till all these pass away, Even all the imperious pride of these, The woodland ways majestic now with towers of trees. Love itself hath nought Touched of tenderest thought With holiest hallowing of memorial grace For memory, blind with bliss, To love, to clasp, to kiss, So sweetly strange as this, The sense that here the sun first hailed her face, A babe at Her glad mother's breast, And here again beholds it more beloved and blest. Love's own heart, a living Spring of strong thanksgiving, Can bid no strength of welling song find way When all the soul would seek One word for joy to speak, And even its strength makes weak The too strong yearning of the soul to say What may not be conceived or said While darkness makes division of the quick and dead. Haply, where the sun Wanes, and death is none, The word known here of silence only, held Too dear for speech to wrong, May leap in living song Forth, and the speech be strong As here the silence whence it yearned and welled From hearts whose utterance love sealed fast Till death perchance might give it grace to live at last. Here we have our earth Yet, with all the mirth Of all the summers since the world began, All strengths of rest and strife And love-lit love of life Where death has birth to wife, And where the sun speaks, and is heard of man: Yea, half the sun's bright speech is heard, And like the sea the soul of man gives back his word. Earth's enkindled heart Bears benignant part In the ardent heaven's auroral pride of prime: If ever home on earth Were found of heaven's grace worth So God-beloved a birth As here makes bright the fostering face of time, Here, heaven bears witness, might such grace Fall fragrant as the dewfall on that brightening face. Here, for mine and me, All that eyes may see Hath more than all the wide world else of good, All nature else of fair: Here as none otherwhere Heaven is the circling air, Heaven is the homestead, heaven the wold, the wood: The fragrance with the shadow spread From broadening wings of cedars breathes of dawn's bright bed. Once a dawn rose here More divine and dear, Rose on a birth-bed brighter far than dawn's, Whence all the summer grew Sweet as when earth was new And pure as Eden's dew: And yet its light lives on these lustrous lawns, Clings round these wildwood ways, and cleaves To the aisles of shadow and sun that wind unweaves and weaves. Thoughts that smile and weep, Dreams that hallow sleep, Brood in the branching shadows of the trees, Tall trees at agelong rest Wherein the centuries nest, Whence, blest as these are blest, We part, and part not from delight in these; Whose comfort, sleeping as awake, We bear about within us as when first it spake. Comfort as of song Grown with time more strong, Made perfect and prophetic as the sea, Whose message, when it lies Far off our hungering eyes, Within us prophesies Of life not ours, yet ours as theirs may be Whose souls far off us shine and sing As ere they sprang back sunward, swift as fire might spring. All this oldworld pleasance Hails a hallowing presence, And thrills with sense of more than summer near, And lifts toward heaven more high The song-surpassing cry Of rapture that July Lives, for her love who makes it loveliest here; For joy that she who here first drew The breath of life she gave me breathes it here anew. Never birthday born Highest in height of morn Whereout the star looks forth that leads the sun Shone higher in love's account, Still seeing the mid noon mount From the eager dayspring's fount Each year more lustrous, each like all in one; Whose light around us and above We could not see so lovely save by grace of love. BARKING HALL: A YEAR AFTER Still the sovereign trees Make the sundawn's breeze More bright, more sweet, more heavenly than it rose, As wind and sun fulfil Their living rapture: still Noon, dawn, and evening thrill With radiant change the immeasurable repose Wherewith the woodland wilds lie blest And feel how storms and centuries rock them still to rest. Still the love-lit place Given of God such grace That here was born on earth a birth divine Gives thanks with all its flowers Through all their lustrous hours, From all its birds and bowers Gives thanks that here they felt her sunset shine Where once her sunrise laughed, and bade The life of all the living things it lit be glad. Soft as light and strong Rises yet their song And thrills with pride the cedar-crested lawn And every brooding dove. But she, beloved above All utterance known of love, Abides no more the change of night and dawn, Beholds no more with earth-born eye These woods that watched her waking here where all things die. Not the light that shone When she looked thereon Shines on them or shall shine for ever here. We know not, save when sleep Slays death, who fain would keep His mystery dense and deep, Where shines the smile we held and hold so dear. Dreams only, thrilled and filled with love, Bring back its light ere dawn leave nought alive above. Nought alive awake Sees the strong dawn break On all the dreams that dying night bade live. Yet scarce the intolerant sense Of day's harsh evidence How came their word and whence Strikes dumb the song of thanks it bids them give, The joy that answers as it heard And lightens as it saw the light that spake the word. Night and sleep and dawn Pass with dreams withdrawn: But higher above them far than noon may climb Love lives and turns to light The deadly noon of night. His fiery spirit of sight Endures no curb of change or darkling time. Even earth and transient things of earth Even here to him bear witness not of death but birth. MUSIC: AN ODE I Was it light that spake from the darkness, or music that shone from the word, When the night was enkindled with sound of the sun or the first-born bird? Souls enthralled and entrammelled in bondage of seasons that fall and rise, Bound fast round with the fetters of flesh, and blinded with light that dies, Lived not surely till music spake, and the spirit of life was heard. II Music, sister of sunrise, and herald of life to be, Smiled as dawn on the spirit of man, and the thrall was free. Slave of nature and serf of time, the bondman of life and death, Dumb with passionless patience that breathed but forlorn and reluctant breath, Heard, beheld, and his soul made answer, and communed aloud with the sea. III Morning spake, and he heard: and the passionate silent noon Kept for him not silence: and soft from the mounting moon Fell the sound of her splendour, heard as dawn's in the breathless night, Not of men but of birds whose note bade man's soul quicken and leap to light: And the song of it spake, and the light and the darkness of earth were as chords in tune. THE CENTENARY OF THE BATTLE OF THE NILE August 1898 ‘Horatio Nelson—Honor est a Nilo’ A hundred years have lightened and have waned Since ancient Nile by grace of Nelson gained A glory higher in story now than time Saw when his kings were gods that raged and reigned. The day that left even England more sublime And higher on heights that none but she may climb Abides above all shock of change-born chance Where hope and memory hear the stars keep chime. The strong and sunbright lie whose name was France Arose against the sun of truth, whose glance Laughed large from the eyes of England, fierce as fire Whence eyes wax blind that gaze on truth askance. A name above all names of heroes, higher Than song may sound or heart of man aspire, Rings as the very voice that speaks the sea To-day from all the sea's enkindling lyre. The sound that bids the soul of silence be Fire, and a rapturous music, speaks, and we Hear what the sea's heart utters, wide and far: “This was his day, and this day's light was he.” O sea, our sea that hadst him for thy star, A hundred years that fall upon thee are Even as a hundred flakes of rain or snow: No storm of battle signs thee with a scar. But never more may ship that sails thee show, But never may the sun that loves thee know, But never may thine England give thee more, A man whose life and death shall praise thee so. The Nile, the sea, the battle, and the shore, Heard as we hear one word arise and soar, Beheld one name above them tower and glow— Nelson: a light that time bows down before. TRAFALGAR DAY Sea, that art ours as we are thine, whose name Is one with England's even as light with flame, Dost thou as we, thy chosen of all men, know This day of days when death gave life to fame? Dost thou not kindle above and thrill below With rapturous record, with memorial glow, Remembering this thy festal day of fight, And all the joy it gave, and all the woe? Never since day broke flowerlike forth of night Broke such a dawn of battle. Death in sight Made of the man whose life was like the sun A man more godlike than the lord of light. There is none like him, and there shall be none. When England bears again as great a son, He can but follow fame where Nelson led. There is not and there cannot be but one. As earth has but one England, crown and head Of all her glories till the sun be dead, Supreme in peace and war, supreme in song, Supreme in freedom, since her rede was read, Since first the soul that gave her speech grew strong To help the right and heal the wild world's wrong, So she hath but one royal Nelson, born To reign on time above the years that throng. The music of his name puts fear to scorn, And thrills our twilight through with sense of morn: As England was, how should not England be? No tempest yet has left her banner torn. No year has yet put out the day when he Who lived and died to keep our kingship free Wherever seas by warring winds are worn Died, and was one with England and the sea. October 21, 1895. CROMWELL'S STATUE Refused by the party of reaction and disunion in the House of Commons on the 17th of June, 1895. What needs our Cromwell stone or bronze to say His was the light that lit on England's way The sundawn of her time-compelling power, The noontide of her most imperial day? His hand won back the sea for England's dower; His footfall bade the Moor change heart and cower; His word on Milton's tongue spake law to France When Piedmont felt the she-wolf Rome devour. From Cromwell's eyes the light of England's glance Flashed, and bowed down the kings by grace of chance, The priest-anointed princes; one alone By grace of England held their hosts in trance. The enthroned Republic from her kinglier throne Spake, and her speech was Cromwell's. Earth has known No lordlier presence. How should Cromwell stand With kinglets and with queenlings hewn in stone? Incarnate England in his warrior hand Smote, and as fire devours the blackening brand Made ashes of their strengths who wrought her wrong, And turned the strongholds of her foes to sand. His praise is in the sea's and Milton's song; What praise could reach him from the weakling throng That rules by leave of tongues whose praise is shame— Him, who made England out of weakness strong? There needs no clarion's blast of broad-blown fame To bid the world bear witness whence he came Who bade fierce Europe fawn at England's heel And purged the plague of lineal rule with flame. There needs no witness graven on stone or steel For one whose work bids fame bow down and kneel; Our man of men, whose time-commanding name Speaks England, and proclaims her Commonweal. June 20, 1895 A WORD FOR THE NAVY I Queen born of the sea, that hast borne her The mightiest of seamen on earth, Bright England, whose glories adorn her And bid her rejoice in thy birth As others made mothers Rejoice in births sublime, She names thee, she claims thee, The lordliest child of time. II All hers is the praise of thy story, All thine is the love of her choice The light of her waves is thy glory, The sound of thy soul is her voice. They fear it who hear it And love not truth nor thee: They sicken, heart-stricken, Who see and would not see. III The lords of thy fate, and thy keepers Whose charge is the strength of thy ships, If now they be dreamers and sleepers, Or sluggards with lies at their lips, Thy haters and traitors, False friends or foes descried, Might scatter and shatter Too soon thy princely pride. IV Dark Muscovy, reptile in rancour, Base Germany, blatant in guile, Lay wait for thee riding at anchor On waters that whisper and smile. They deem thee or dream thee Less living now than dead, Deep sunken and drunken With sleep whence fear has fled. V And what though thy song as thine action Wax faint, and thy place be not known, While faction is grappling with faction, Twin curs with thy corpse for a bone? They care not, who spare not The noise of pens or throats; Who bluster and muster Blind ranks and bellowing votes. VI Let populace jangle with peerage And ministers shuffle their mobs; Mad pilots who reck not of steerage Though tempest ahead of them throbs. That throbbing and sobbing Of wind and gradual wave They hear not and fear not Who guide thee toward thy grave. VII No clamour of cries or of parties Is worth but a whisper from thee, While only the trust of thy heart is At one with the soul of the sea. In justice her trust is Whose time her tidestreams keep; They sink not, they shrink not, Time casts them not on sleep. VIII Sleep thou: for thy past was so royal, Love hardly would bid thee take heed Were Russia not faithful and loyal Nor Germany guiltless of greed. No nation, in station Of story less than thou, Re-risen from prison, Can stand against thee now. IX Sleep on: is the time not a season For strong men to slumber and sleep, And wise men to palter with treason? And that they sow tares, shall they reap? The wages of ages Wherein men smiled and slept, Fame fails them, shame veils them, Their record is not kept. X Nay, whence is it then that we know it, What wages were theirs, and what fame? Deep voices of prophet and poet Bear record against them of shame. Death, starker and darker Than seals the graveyard grate, Entombs them and dooms them To darkness deep as fate. XI But thou, though the world should misdoubt thee, Be strong as the seas at thy side; Bind on but thine armour about thee, That girds thee with power and with pride. Where Drake stood, where Blake stood, Where fame sees Nelson stand, Stand thou too, and now too Take thou thy fate in hand. XII At the gate of the sea, in the gateway, They stood as the guards of thy gate; Take now but thy strengths to thee straightway, Though late, we will deem it not late. Thy story, thy glory, The very soul of thee, It rose not, it grows not, It comes not save by sea. NORTHUMBERLAND Between our eastward and our westward sea The narrowing strand Clasps close the noblest shore fame holds in fee Even here where English birth seals all men free— Northumberland. The sea-mists meet across it when the snow Clothes moor and fell, And bid their true-born hearts who love it glow For joy that none less nobly born may know What love knows well. The splendour and the strength of storm and fight Sustain the song That filled our fathers' hearts with joy to smite, To live, to love, to lay down life that right Might tread down wrong. They warred, they sang, they triumphed, and they passed, And left us glad Here to be born, their sons, whose hearts hold fast The proud old love no change can overcast, No chance leave sad. None save our northmen ever, none but we, Met, pledged, or fought Such foes and friends as Scotland and the sea With heart so high and equal, strong in glee And stern in thought. Thought, fed from time's memorial springs with pride, Made strong as fire Their hearts who hurled the foe down Flodden side, And hers who rode the waves none else durst ride— None save her sire. O land beloved, where nought of legend's dream Outshines the truth, Where Joyous Gard, closed round with clouds that gleam For them that know thee not, can scarce but seem Too sweet for sooth, Thy sons forget not, nor shall fame forget, The deed there done Before the walls whose fabled fame is yet A light too sweet and strong to rise and set With moon and sun. Song bright as flash of swords or oars that shine Through fight or foam Stirs yet the blood thou hast given thy sons like wine To hail in each bright ballad hailed as thine One heart, one home. Our Collingwood, though Nelson be not ours, By him shall stand Immortal, till those waifs of oldworld hours, Forgotten, leave uncrowned with bays and flowers Northumberland. STRATFORD-ON-AVON June 27, 1901 Be glad in heaven above all souls insphered, Most royal and most loyal born of men, Shakespeare, of all on earth beloved or feared Or worshipped, highest in sight of human ken. The homestead hallowed by thy sovereign birth, Whose name, being one with thine, stands higher than Rome, Forgets not how of all on English earth Their trust is holiest, there who have their home. Stratford is thine and England's. None that hate The commonweal whose empire sets men free Find comfort there, where once by grace of fate A soul was born as boundless as the sea. If life, if love, if memory now be thine, Rejoice that still thy Stratford bears thy sign. BURNS: AN ODE A fire of fierce and laughing light That clove the shuddering heart of night Leapt earthward, and the thunder's might That pants and yearns Made fitful music round its flight: And earth saw Burns. The joyous lightning found its voice And bade the heart of wrath rejoice And scorn uplift a song to voice The imperial hate That smote the God of base men's choice At God's own gate. Before the shrine of dawn, wherethrough The lark rang rapture as she flew, It flashed and fired the darkling dew: And all that heard With love or loathing hailed anew A new day's word. The servants of the lord of hell, As though their lord had blessed them, fell Foaming at mouth for fear, so well They knew the lie Wherewith they sought to scan and spell The unsounded sky. And Calvin, night's prophetic bird, Out of his home in hell was heard Shrieking; and all the fens were stirred Whence plague is bred; Can God endure the scoffer's word? But God was dead. The God they made them in despite Of man and woman, love and light, Strong sundawn and the starry night, The lie supreme, Shot through with song, stood forth to sight A devil's dream. And he that bent the lyric bow And laid the lord of darkness low And bade the fire of laughter glow Across his grave, And bade the tides above it flow, Wave hurtling wave, Shall he not win from latter days More than his own could yield of praise? Ay, could the sovereign singer's bays Forsake his brow, The warrior's, won on stormier ways, Still clasp it now. He loved, and sang of love: he laughed, And bade the cup whereout he quaffed Shine as a planet, fore and aft, And left and right, And keen as shoots the sun's first shaft Against the night. But love and wine were moon and sun For many a fame long since undone, And sorrow and joy have lost and won By stormy turns As many a singer's soul, if none More bright than Burns. And sweeter far in grief or mirth Have songs as glad and sad of birth Found voice to speak of wealth or dearth In joy of life: But never song took fire from earth More strong for strife. The daisy by his ploughshare cleft, The lips of women loved and left, The griefs and joys that weave the weft Of human time, With craftsman's cunning, keen and deft, He carved in rhyme. But Chaucer's daisy shines a star Above his ploughshare's reach to mar, And mightier vision gave Dunbar More strenuous wing To hear around all sins that are Hell dance and sing. And when such pride and power of trust In song's high gift to arouse from dust Death, and transfigure love or lust Through smiles or tears In golden speech that takes no rust From cankering years, As never spake but once in one Strong star-crossed child of earth and sun, Villon, made music such as none May praise or blame, A crown of starrier flower was won Than Burns may claim. But never, since bright earth was born In rapture of the enkindling morn, Might godlike wrath and sunlike scorn That was and is And shall be while false weeds are worn Find word like his. Above the rude and radiant earth That heaves and glows from firth to firth In vale and mountain, bright in dearth And warm in wealth, Which gave his fiery glory birth By chance and stealth, Above the storms of praise and blame That blur with mist his lustrous name, His thunderous laughter went and came, And lives and flies; The roar that follows on the flame When lightning dies. Earth, and the snow-dimmed heights of air, And water winding soft and fair Through still sweet places, bright and bare, By bent and byre, Taught him what hearts within them were: But his was fire. THE COMMONWEAL A Song for Unionists Men, whose fathers braved the world in arms against our isles in union, Men, whose brothers met rebellion face to face, Show the hearts ye have, if worthy long descent and high communion, Show the spirits, if unbroken, of your race. What are these that howl and hiss across the strait of westward water? What is he who floods our ears with speech in flood? See the long tongue lick the dripping hand that smokes and reeks of slaughter! See the man of words embrace the man of blood! Hear the plea whereby the tonguester mocks and charms the gazing gaper— “We are they whose works are works of love and peace; Till disunion bring forth union, what is union, sirs, but paper? Break and rend it, then shall trust and strength increase.” Who would fear to trust a double-faced but single-hearted dreamer, Pure of purpose, clean of hand, and clear of guile? “Life is well-nigh spent,” he sighs; “you call me shuffler, trickster, schemer? I am old—when young men yell at me, I smile.” Many a year that priceless light of life has trembled, we remember, On the platform of extinction—unextinct; Many a month has been for him the long year's last—life's calm December: Can it be that he who said so, saying so, winked? No; the lust of life, the thirst for work and days with work to do in, Drove and drives him down the road of splendid shame; All is well, if o'er the monument recording England's ruin Time shall read, inscribed in triumph, Gladstone's name. Thieves and murderers, hands yet red with blood and tongues yet black with lies, Clap and clamour—“Parnell spurs his Gladstone well!” Truth, unscared and undeluded by their praise or blame, replies— “Is the goal of fraud and bloodshed heaven or hell?” Old men eloquent, who truckle to the traitors of the time, Love not office—power is no desire of theirs: What if yesterday their hearts recoiled from blood and fraud and crime? Conscience erred—an error which to-day repairs. Conscience only now convinces them of strange though transient error: Only now they see how fair is treason's face; See how true the falsehood, just the theft, and blameless is the terror, Which replaces just and blameless men in place. Place and time decide the right and wrong of thought and word and action; Crime is black as hell, till virtue gain its vote; Then—but ah, to think or say so smacks of fraud or smells of faction!— Mercy holds the door while Murder hacks the throat. Murder? Treason? Theft? Poor brothers who succumb to such temptations, Shall we lay on you or take on us the blame? Reason answers, and religion echoes round to wondering nations, “Not with Ireland, but with England rests the shame.” Reason speaks through mild religion's organ, loud and long and lusty— Profit speaks through lips of patriots pure and true— “English friends, whose trust we ask for, has not England found us trusty? Not for us we seek advancement, but for you. “Far and near the world bears witness of our wisdom, courage, honour; Egypt knows if there our fame burns bright or dim. Let but England trust as Gordon trusted, soon shall come upon her Such deliverance as our daring brought on him. “Far and wide the world rings record of our faith, our constant dealing, Love of country, truth to friends, contempt for foes. Sign once more the bond of trust in us that here awaits but sealing, We will give yet more than all our record shows. “Perfect ruin, shame eternal, everlasting degradation, Freedom bought and sold, truth bound and treason free.” Yet an hour is here for answer; now, if here be yet a nation, Answer, England, man by man from sea to sea! June 30, 1886 THE QUESTION 1887 Shall England consummate the crime That binds the murderer's hand, and leaves No surety for the trust of thieves? Time pleads against it—truth and time— And pity frowns and grieves. The hoary henchman of the gang Lifts hands that never dew nor rain May cleanse from Gordon's blood again, Appealing: pity's tenderest pang Thrills his pure heart with pain. Grand helmsman of the clamorous crew, The good grey recreant quakes and weeps To think that crime no longer creeps Safe toward its end: that murderers too May die when mercy sleeps. While all the lives were innocent That slaughter drank, and laughed with rage, Bland virtue sighed, “A former age Taught murder: souls long discontent Can aught save blood assuage? “You blame not Russian hands that smite By fierce and secret ways the power That leaves not life one chainless hour; Have these than they less natural right To claim life's natural dower? “The dower that freedom brings the slave She weds, is vengeance: why should we, Whom equal laws acclaim as free, Think shame, if men too blindly brave Steal, murder, skulk, and flee? “At kings they strike in Russia: there Men take their life in hand who slay Kings: these, that have not heart to lay Hand save on girls whose ravaged hair Is made the patriot's prey, “These, whom the sight of old men slain Makes bold to bid their children die, Starved, if they hold not peace, nor lie, Claim loftier praise: could others deign To stand in shame so high? “Could others deign to dare such deeds As holiest Ireland hallows? Nay, But justice then makes plain our way: Be laws burnt up like burning weeds That vex the face of day. “Shall bloodmongers be held of us Blood-guilty? Hands reached out for gold Whereon blood rusts not yet, we hold Bloodless and blameless: ever thus Have good men held of old. “Fair Freedom, fledged and imped with lies, Takes flight by night where murder lurks, And broods on murderous ways and works, Yet seems not hideous in our eyes As Austrians or as Turks. “Be it ours to undo a woful past, To bid the bells of concord chime, To break the bonds of suffering crime, Slack now, that some would make more fast: Such teaching comes of time.” So pleads the gentlest heart that lives, Whose pity, pitiless for all Whom darkling terror holds in thrall, Toward none save miscreants yearns, and gives Alms of warm tears—and gall. Hear, England, and obey: for he Who claims thy trust again to-day Is he who left thy sons a prey To shame whence only death sets free: Hear, England, and obey. Thy spoils he gave to deck the Dutch; Thy noblest pride, most pure, most brave, To death forlorn and sure he gave; Nor now requires he overmuch Who bids thee dig thy grave. Dig deep the grave of shame, wherein Thy fame, thy commonweal, must lie; Put thought of aught save terror by; To strike and slay the slayer is sin; And Murder must not die. Bind fast the true man; loose the thief; Shamed were the land, the laws accursed, Were guilt, not innocence, amerced; And dark the wrong and sore the grief, Were tyrants too coerced. The fiercest cowards that ever skulked, The cowardliest hounds that ever lapped Blood, if their horde be tracked and trapped, And justice claim their lives for mulct, Gnash teeth that flashed and snapped. Bow down for fear, then, England: bow, Lest worse befall thee yet; and swear That nought save pity, conscience, care For truth and mercy, moves thee now To call foul falsehood fair. So shalt thou live in shame, and hear The lips of all men laugh thee dead; The wide world's mockery round thy head Shriek like a storm-wind: and a bier Shall be thine honour's bed. APOSTASY Et Judas m'a dit: Traître! —Victor Hugo I Truths change with time, and terms with truth. To-day A statesman worships union, and to-night Disunion. Shame to have sinned against the light Confounds not but impels his tongue to unsay What yestereve he swore. Should fear make way For treason? honour change her livery? fright Clasp hands with interest? wrong pledge faith with right? Religion, mercy, conscience, answer—Yea. To veer is not to veer: when votes are weighed, The numerous tongue approves him renegade Who cannot change his banner: he that can Sits crowned with wreaths of praise too pure to fade. Truth smiles applause on treason's poisonous plan: And Cleon is an honourable man. II Pure faith, fond hope, sweet love, with God for guide, Move now the men whose blameless error cast In prison (ah, but love condones the past!) Their subject knaves that were—their lords that ride Now laughing on their necks, and now bestride Their vassal backs in triumph. Faith stands fast Though fear haul down the flag that crowned her mast And hope and love proclaim that truth has lied. Turn, turn, and turn—so bids the still small voice, The changeless voice of honour. He that stands Where all his life he stood, with bribeless hands, With tongue unhired to mourn, reprove, rejoice, Curse, bless, forswear, and swear again, and lie, Stands proven apostate in the apostate's eye. III Fraud shrinks from faith: at sight of swans, the raven Chides blackness, and the snake recoils aghast In fear of poison when a bird flies past. Thersites brands Achilles as a craven; The shoal fed full with shipwreck blames the haven For murderous lust of lives devoured, and vast Desire of doom whose feast is mercy's fast: And Bacon sees the traitor's mark engraven Full on the front of Essex. Grief and shame Obscure the chaste and sunlike spirit of Oates At thought of Russell's treason; and the name Of Milton sickens with superb disgust The heaving heart of Waller. Wisdom dotes, If wisdom turns not tail and licks not dust. IV The sole sweet land found fit to wed the sea, With reptile rebels at her heel of old, Set hard her heel upon them, and controlled The cowering poisonous peril. How should she Cower, and resign her trust of empire? Free As winds and waters live the loyal-souled And true-born sons that love her: nay, the bold Base knaves who curse her name have leave to be The loud-tongued liars they are. For she, beyond All woful years that bid men's hearts despond, Sees yet the likeness of her ancient fame Burn from the heavenward heights of history, hears Not Leicester's name but Sidney's—faith's, not fear's— Not Gladstone's now but only Gordon's name. RUSSIA: AN ODE 1890 I Out of hell a word comes hissing, dark as doom, Fierce as fire, and foul as plague-polluted gloom; Out of hell wherein the sinless damned endure More than ever sin conceived of pains impure; More than ever ground men's living souls to dust; Worse than madness ever dreamed of murderous lust. Since the world's wail first went up from lands and seas Ears have heard not, tongues have told not things like these. Dante, led by love's and hate's accordant spell Down the deepest and the loathliest ways of hell, Where beyond the brook of blood the rain was fire, Where the scalps were masked with dung more deep than mire, Saw not, where the filth was foulest, and the night Darkest, depths whose fiends could match the Muscovite. Set beside this truth, his deadliest vision seems Pale and pure and painless as a virgin's dreams. Maidens dead beneath the clasping lash, and wives Rent with deadlier pangs than death—for shame survives, Naked, mad, starved, scourged, spurned, frozen, fallen, deflowered, Souls and bodies as by fangs of beasts devoured, Sounds that hell would hear not, sights no thought could shape, Limbs that feel as flame the ravenous grasp of rape, Filth of raging crime and shame that crime enjoys, Age made one with youth in torture, girls with boys, These, and worse if aught be worse than these things are, Prove thee regent, Russia—praise thy mercy, Czar. II Sons of man, men born of women, may we dare Say they sin who dare be slain and dare not spare? They who take their lives in hand and smile on death, Holding life as less than sleep's most fitful breath, So their life perchance or death may serve and speed Faith and hope, that die if dream become not deed? Nought is death and nought is life and nought is fate Save for souls that love has clothed with fire of hate. These behold them, weigh them, prove them, find them nought, Save by light of hope and fire of burning thought. What though sun be less than storm where these aspire, Dawn than lightning, song than thunder, light than fire? Help is none in heaven: hope sees no gentler star: Earth is hell, and hell bows down before the Czar. All its monstrous, murderous, lecherous births acclaim Him whose empire lives to match its fiery fame. Nay, perchance at sight or sense of deeds here done, Here where men may lift up eyes to greet the sun, Hell recoils heart-stricken: horror worse than hell Darkens earth and sickens heaven; life knows the spell, Shudders, quails, and sinks—or, filled with fierier breath, Rises red in arms devised of darkling death. Pity mad with passion, anguish mad with shame, Call aloud on justice by her darker name; Love grows hate for love's sake; life takes death for guide. Night hath none but one red star—Tyrannicide. III “God or man, be swift; hope sickens with delay: Smite, and send him howling down his father's way! Fall, O fire of heaven, and smite as fire from hell Halls wherein men's torturers, crowned and cowering, dwell! These that crouch and shrink and shudder, girt with power— These that reign, and dare not trust one trembling hour— These omnipotent, whom terror curbs and drives— These whose life reflects in fear their victims' lives— These whose breath sheds poison worse than plague's thick breath— These whose reign is ruin, these whose word is death, These whose will turns heaven to hell, and day to night, These, if God's hand smite not, how shall man's not smite?” So from hearts by horror withered as by fire Surge the strains of unappeasable desire; Sounds that bid the darkness lighten, lit for death; Bid the lips whose breath was doom yield up their breath; Down the way of Czars, awhile in vain deferred, Bid the Second Alexander light the Third. How for shame shall men rebuke them? how may we Blame, whose fathers died, and slew, to leave us free? We, though all the world cry out upon them, know, Were our strife as theirs, we could not strike but so; Could not cower, and could not kiss the hands that smite; Could not meet them armed in sunlit battle's light. Dark as fear and red as hate though morning rise, Life it is that conquers; death it is that dies. FOR GREECE AND CRETE Storm and shame and fraud and darkness fill the nations full with night: Hope and fear whose eyes yearn eastward have but fire and sword in sight: One alone, whose name is one with glory, sees and seeks the light. Hellas, mother of the spirit, sole supreme in war and peace, Land of light, whose word remembered bids all fear and sorrow cease, Lives again, while freedom lightens eastward yet for sons of Greece. Greece, where only men whose manhood was as godhead ever trod, Bears the blind world witness yet of light wherewith her feet are shod: Freedom, armed of Greece was always very man and very God. Now the winds of old that filled her sails with triumph, when the fleet Bound for death from Asia fled before them stricken, wake to greet Ships full-winged again for freedom toward the sacred shores of Crete. There was God born man, the song that spake of old time said: and there Man, made even as God by trust that shows him nought too dire to dare, Now may light again the beacon lit when those we worship were. Sharp the concert wrought of discord shrills the tune of shame and death, Turk by Christian fenced and fostered, Mecca backed by Nazareth: All the powerless powers, tongue-valiant, breathe but greed's or terror's breath. Though the tide that feels the west wind lift it wave by widening wave Wax not yet to height and fullness of the storm that smites to save, None shall bid the flood back seaward till no bar be left to brave. DELPHIC HYMN TO APOLLO (B.C. 280) Done into English I Thee, the son of God most high, Famed for harping song, will I Proclaim, and the deathless oracular word From the snow-topped rock that we gaze on heard, Counsels of thy glorious giving Manifest for all men living, How thou madest the tripod of prophecy thine Which the wrath of the dragon kept guard on, a shrine Voiceless till thy shafts could smite All his live coiled glittering might. II Ye that hold of right alone All deep woods on Helicon, Fair daughters of thunder-girt God, with your bright White arms uplift as to lighten the light, Come to chant your brother's praise, Gold-haired Phœbus, loud in lays, Even his, who afar up the twin-topped seat Of the rock Parnassian whereon we meet Risen with glorious Delphic maids Seeks the soft spring-sweetened shades Castalian, fain of the Delphian peak Prophetic, sublime as the feet that seek. Glorious Athens, highest of state, Come, with praise and prayer elate, O thou that art queen of the plain unscarred That the warrior Tritonid hath alway in guard, Where on many a sacred shrine Young bulls' thigh-bones burn and shine As the god that is fire overtakes them, and fast The smoke of Arabia to heavenward is cast, Scattering wide its balm: and shrill Now with nimble notes that thrill The flute strikes up for the song, and the harp of gold Strikes up to the song sweet answer: and all behold, All, aswarm as bees, give ear, Who by birth hold Athens dear. A NEW CENTURY An age too great for thought of ours to scan, A wave upon the sleepless sea of time That sinks and sleeps for ever, ere the chime Pass that salutes with blessing, not with ban, The dark year dead, the bright year born for man, Dies: all its days that watched man cower and climb, Frail as the foam, and as the sun sublime, Sleep sound as they that slept ere these began. Our mother earth, whose ages none may tell, Puts on no change: time bids not her wax pale Or kindle, quenched or quickened, when the knell Sounds, and we cry across the veering gale Farewell—and midnight answers us, Farewell; Hail—and the heaven of morning answers, Hail. AN EVENING AT VICHY Written on the news of the death of Lord Leighton September 1896 A light has passed that never shall pass away, A sun has set whose rays are unquelled of night. The loyal grace, the courtesy bright as day, The strong sweet radiant spirit of life and light That shone and smiled and lightened on all men's sight, The kindly life whose tune was the tune of May, For us now dark, for love and for fame is bright. Nay, not for us that live as the fen-fires live, As stars that shoot and shudder with life and die, Can death make dark that lustre of life, or give The grievous gift of trust in oblivion's lie. Days dear and far death touches, and draws them nigh, And bids the grief that broods on their graves forgive The day that seems to mock them as clouds that fly. If life be life more faithful than shines on sleep When dreams take wing and lighten and fade like flame, Then haply death may be not a death so deep That all things past are past for it wholly—fame, Love, loving-kindness, seasons that went and came, And left their light on life as a seal to keep Winged memory fast and heedful of time's dead claim. Death gives back life and light to the sunless years Whose suns long sunken set not for ever. Time, Blind, fierce, and deaf as tempest, relents, and hears And sees how bright the days and how sweet their chime Rang, shone, and passed in music that matched the clime Wherein we met rejoicing—a joy that cheers Sorrow, to see the night as the dawn sublime. The days that were outlighten the days that are, And eyes now darkened shine as the stars we see And hear not sing, impassionate star to star, As once we heard the music that haply he Hears, high in heaven if ever a voice may be The same in heaven, the same as on earth, afar From pain and earth as heaven from the heaving sea. A woman's voice, divine as a bird's by dawn Kindled and stirred to sunward, arose and held Our souls that heard, from earth as from sleep withdrawn, And filled with light as stars, and as stars compelled To move by might of music, elate while quelled, Subdued by rapture, lit as a mountain lawn By morning whence all heaven in the sunrise welled. And her the shadow of death as a robe clasped round Then: and as morning's music she passed away. And he then with us, warrior and wanderer, crowned With fame that shone from eastern on western day, More strong, more kind, than praise or than grief might say, Has passed now forth of shadow by sunlight bound, Of night shot through with light that is frail as May. May dies, and light grows darkness, and life grows death: Hope fades and shrinks and falls as a changing leaf: Remembrance, touched and kindled by love's live breath, Shines, and subdues the shadow of time called grief, The shade whose length of life is as life's date brief, With joy that broods on the sunlight past, and saith That thought and love hold sorrow and change in fief. Sweet, glad, bright spirit, kind as the sun seems kind When earth and sea rejoice in his gentler spell, Thy face that was we see not; bereft and blind, We see but yet, rejoicing to see, and dwell Awhile in days that heard not the death-day's knell, A light so bright that scarcely may sorrow find One old sweet word that hails thee and mourns—Farewell. TO GEORGE FREDERICK WATTS On the Eightieth Anniversary of his Birth, February 23 1897 High thought and hallowed love, by faith made one, Begat and bare the sweet strong-hearted child, Art, nursed of Nature; earth and sea and sun Saw Nature then more godlike as she smiled. Life smiled on death, and death on life: the Soul Between them shone, and soared above their strife, And left on Time's unclosed and starry scroll A sign that quickened death to deathless life. Peace rose like Hope, a patient queen, and bade Hell's firstborn, Faith, abjure her creed and die; And Love, by life and death made sad and glad, Gave Conscience ease, and watched Good Will pass by. All these make music now of one man's name, Whose life and age are one with love and fame. ON THE DEATH OF MRS. LYNN LINTON Kind, wise, and true as truth's own heart, A soul that here Chose and held fast the better part And cast out fear, Has left us ere we dreamed of death For life so strong, Clear as the sundawn's light and breath, And sweet as song. We see no more what here awhile Shed light on men: Has Landor seen that brave bright smile Alive again? If death and life and love be one And hope no lie And night no stronger than the sun, These cannot die. The father-spirit whence her soul Took strength, and gave Back love, is perfect yet and whole, As hope might crave. His word is living light and fire: And hers shall live By grace of all good gifts the sire Gave power to give. The sire and daughter, twain and one In quest and goal, Stand face to face beyond the sun, And soul to soul. Not we, who loved them well, may dream What joy sublime Is theirs, if dawn through darkness gleam, And life through time. Time seems but here the mask of death, That falls and shows A void where hope may draw not breath: Night only knows. Love knows not: all that love may keep Glad memory gives: The spirit of the days that sleep Still wakes and lives. But not the spirit's self, though song Would lend it speech, May touch the goal that hope might long In vain to reach. How dear that high true heart, how sweet Those keen kind eyes, Love knows, who knows how fiery fleet Is life that flies. If life there be that flies not, fair The life must be That thrills her sovereign spirit there And sets it free. IN MEMORY OF AURELIO SAFFI Beloved above all nations, land adored, Sovereign in spirit and charm, by song and sword, Sovereign whose life is love, whose name is light, Italia, queen that hast the sun for lord, Bride that hast heaven for bridegroom, how should night Veil or withhold from faith's and memory's sight A man beloved and crowned of thee and fame, Hide for an hour his name's memorial might? Thy sons may never speak or hear the name Saffi, and feel not love's regenerate flame Thrill all the quickening heart with faith and pride In one whose life makes death and life the same. They die indeed whose souls before them died: Not he, for whom death flung life's portal wide, Who stands where Dante's soul in vision came, In Dante's presence, by Mazzini's side. March 26, 1896. CARNOT Death, winged with fire of hate from deathless hell Wherein the souls of anarchs hiss and die, With stroke as dire has cloven a heart as high As twice beyond the wide sea's westward swell The living lust of death had power to quell Through ministry of murderous hands whereby Dark fate bade Lincoln's head and Garfield's lie Low even as his who bids his France farewell. France, now no heart that would not weep with thee Loved ever faith or freedom. From thy hand The staff of state is broken: hope, unmanned With anguish, doubts if freedom's self be free. The snake-souled anarch's fang strikes all the land Cold, and all hearts unsundered by the sea. June 25, 1894. AFTER THE VERDICT France, cloven in twain by fire of hell and hate, Shamed with the shame of men her meanest born, Soldier and judge whose names, inscribed for scorn, Stand vilest on the record writ of fate, Lies yet not wholly vile who stood so great, Sees yet not all her praise of old outworn. Not yet is all her scroll of glory torn, Or left for utter shame to desecrate. High souls and constant hearts of faithful men Sustain her perfect praise with tongue and pen Indomitable as honour. Storms may toss And soil her standard ere her bark win home: But shame falls full upon the Christless cross Whose brandmark signs the holy hounds of Rome. September 1899. THE TRANSVAAL Patience, long sick to death, is dead. Too long Have sloth and doubt and treason bidden us be What Cromwell's England was not, when the sea To him bore witness given of Blake how strong She stood, a commonweal that brooked no wrong From foes less vile than men like wolves set free Whose war is waged where none may fight or flee— With women and with weanlings. Speech and song Lack utterance now for loathing. Scarce we hear Foul tongues that blacken God's dishonoured name With prayers turned curses and with praise found shame Defy the truth whose witness now draws near To scourge these dogs, agape with jaws afoam, Down out of life. Strike, England, and strike home. October 9, 1899. REVERSE The wave that breaks against a forward stroke Beats not the swimmer back, but thrills him through With joyous trust to win his way anew Through stronger seas than first upon him broke And triumphed. England's iron-tempered oak Shrank not when Europe's might against her grew Full, and her sun drank up her foes like dew, And lion-like from sleep her strength awoke. As bold in fight as bold in breach of trust We find our foes, and wonder not to find, Nor grudge them praise whom honour may not bind: But loathing more intense than speaks disgust Heaves England's heart, when scorn is bound to greet Hunters and hounds whose tongues would lick their feet. November 1, 1899. THE TURNING OF THE TIDE Storm, strong with all the bitter heart of hate, Smote England, now nineteen dark years ago, As when the tide's full wrath in seaward flow Smites and bears back the swimmer. Fraud and fate Were leagued against her: fear was fain to prate Of honour in dishonour, pride brought low, And humbleness whence holiness must grow, And greatness born of shame to be so great. The winter day that withered hope and pride Shines now triumphal on the turning tide That sets once more our trust in freedom free, That leaves a ruthless and a truthless foe And all base hopes that hailed his cause laid low, And England's name a light on land and sea. February 27, 1900. ON THE DEATH OF COLONEL BENSON Northumberland, so proud and sad to-day, Weep and rejoice, our mother, whom no son More glorious than this dead and deathless one Brought ever fame whereon no time shall prey. Nor heed we more than he what liars dare say Of mercy's holiest duties left undone Toward whelps and dams of murderous foes, whom none Save we had spared or feared to starve and slay. Alone as Milton and as Wordsworth found And hailed their England, when from all around Howled all the recreant hate of envious knaves, Sublime she stands: while, stifled in the sound, Each lie that falls from German boors and slaves Falls but as filth dropt in the wandering waves. November 4, 1901. ASTRÆA VICTRIX England, elect of time, By freedom sealed sublime, And constant as the sun that saw thy dawn Outshine upon the sea His own in heaven, to be A light that night nor day should see withdrawn, If song may speak not now thy praise, Fame writes it higher than song may soar or faith may gaze. Dark months on months beheld Hope thwarted, crossed, and quelled, And heard the heartless hounds of hatred bay Aloud against thee, glad As now their souls are sad Who see their hope in hatred pass away And wither into shame and fear And shudder down to darkness, loth to see or hear. Nought now they hear or see That speaks or shows not thee Triumphant; not as empires reared of yore, The imperial commonweal That bears thy sovereign seal And signs thine orient as thy natural shore Free, as no sons but thine may stand, Steers lifeward ever, guided of thy pilot hand. Fear, masked and veiled by fraud, Found shameful time to applaud Shame, and bow down thy banner towards the dust, And call on godly shame To desecrate thy name And bid false penitence abjure thy trust: Till England's heart took thought at last, And felt her future kindle from her fiery past. Then sprang the sunbright fire High as the sun, and higher Than strange men's eyes might watch it undismayed: But winds athwart it blew Storm, and the twilight grew Darkness awhile, an unenduring shade: And all base birds and beasts of night Saw no more England now to fear, no loathsome light. All knaves and slaves at heart Who, knowing thee what thou art, Abhor thee, seeing what none save here may see, Strong freedom, taintless truth, Supreme in ageless youth, Howled all their hate and hope aloud at thee While yet the wavering wind of strife Bore hard against her sail whose freight is hope and life. And now the quickening tide That brings back power and pride To faith and love whose ensign is thy name Bears down the recreant lie That doomed thy name to die, Sons, friends, and foes behold thy star the same As when it stood in heaven a sun And Europe saw no glory left her sky save one. And now, as then she saw, She sees with shamefast awe How all unlike all slaves and tyrants born Where bondmen champ the bit And anarchs foam and flit, And day mocks day, and year puts year to scorn, Our mother bore us, English men, Ashamed of shame and strong in mercy, now as then. We loosed not on these knaves Their scourge-tormented slaves: We held the hand that fain had risen to smite The torturer fast, and made Justice awhile afraid, And righteousness forego her ruthless right: We warred not even with these as they; We bade not them they preyed on make of them their prey. All murderous fraud that lurks In hearts where hell's craft works Fought, crawled, and slew in darkness: they that died Dreamed not of foes too base For scorn to grant them grace: Men wounded, women, children at their side, Had found what faith in fiends may live: And yet we gave not back what righteous doom would give. No false white flag that fawns On faith till murder dawns Blood-red from hell-black treason's heart of hate Left ever shame's foul brand Seared on an English hand: And yet our pride vouchsafes them grace too great For other pride to dream of: scorn Strikes retribution silent as the stars at morn. And now the living breath Whose life puts death to death, Freedom, whose name is England, stirs and thrills The burning darkness through Whence fraud and slavery grew, We scarce may mourn our dead whose fame fulfils The record where her foes have read That earth shall see none like her born ere earth be dead. THE FIRST OF JUNE Peace and war are one in proof of England's deathless praise. One divine day saw her foemen scattered on the sea Far and fast as storm could speed: the same strong day of days Sees the imperial commonweal set friends and foemen free. Save where freedom reigns, whose name is England, fraud and fear Grind and blind the face of men who look on her and lie: Now may truth and pride in truth, whose seat of old was here, See them shamed and stricken blind and dumb as worms that die. Even before our hallowed hawthorn-blossom pass and cease, Even as England shines and smiles at last upon the sun, Comes the word that means for England more than passing peace, Peace with honour, peace with pride in righteous work well done. Crowned with flowers the first of all the world and all the year, Peace, whose name is one with honour born of war, is here. ROUNDEL From the French of Villon Death, I would plead against thy wrong, Who hast reft me of my love, my wife, And art not satiate yet with strife, But needs wilt hold me lingering long. No strength since then has kept me strong: But what could hurt thee in her life, Death? Twain we were, and our hearts one song, One heart: if that be dead, thy knife Hath cut me off alive from life, Dead as the carver's figured throng, Death! A ROUNDEL OF RABELAIS Theleme is afar on the waters, adrift and afar, Afar and afloat on the waters that flicker and gleam, And we feel but her fragrance and see but the shadows that mar Theleme. In the sun-coloured mists of the sunrise and sunset that steam As incense from urns of the twilight, her portals ajar Let pass as a shadow the light of the sound of a dream. But the laughter that rings from her cloisters that know not a bar So kindles delight in desire that the souls in us deem He erred not, the seer who discerned on the seas as a star Theleme. LUCIFER Écrasez l'infâme. —Voltaire Les prêtres ont raison de l'appeler Lucifer. —Victor Hugo Voltaire, our England's lover, man divine Beyond all Gods that ever fear adored By right and might, by sceptre and by sword, By godlike love of sunlike truth, made thine Through godlike hate of falsehood's marshlight shine And all the fume of creeds and deeds abhorred Whose light was darkness, till the dawn-star soared, Truth, reason, mercy, justice, keep thy shrine Sacred in memory's temple, seeing that none Of all souls born to strive before the sun Loved ever good or hated evil more. The snake that felt thy heel upon her head, Night's first-born, writhes as though she were not dead, But strikes not, stings not, slays not as before. THE CENTENARY OF ALEXANDRE DUMAS Sound of trumpets blowing down the merriest winds of morn, Flash of hurtless lightnings, laugh of thunders loud and glad, Here should hail the summer day whereon a light was born Whence the sun grew brighter, seeing the world less dark and sad. Man of men by right divine of boyhood everlasting, France incarnate, France immortal in her deathless boy, Brighter birthday never shone than thine on earth, forecasting More of strenuous mirth in manhood, more of manful joy. Child of warriors, friend of warriors, Garibaldi's friend, Even thy name is as the splendour of a sunbright sword: While the boy's heart beats in man, thy fame shall find not end: Time and dark oblivion bow before thee as their lord. Youth acclaims thee gladdest of the gods that gild his days: Age gives thanks for thee, and death lacks heart to quench thy praise. AT A DOG'S GRAVE I Good night, we say, when comes the time to win The daily death divine that shuts up sight, Sleep, that assures for all who dwell therein Good night. The shadow shed round those we love shines bright As love's own face, when death, sleep's gentler twin, From them divides us even as night from light. Shall friends born lower in life, though pure of sin, Though clothed with love and faith to usward plight, Perish and pass unbidden of us, their kin, Good night? II To die a dog's death once was held for shame. Not all men so beloved and mourned shall lie As many of these, whose time untimely came To die. His years were full: his years were joyous: why Must love be sorrow, when his gracious name Recalls his lovely life of limb and eye? If aught of blameless life on earth may claim Life higher than death, though death's dark wave rise high, Such life as this among us never came To die. III White violets, there by hands more sweet than they Planted, shall sweeten April's flowerful air About a grave that shows to night and day White violets there. A child's light hands, whose touch makes flowers more fair, Keep fair as these for many a March and May The light of days that are because they were. It shall not like a blossom pass away; It broods and brightens with the days that bear Fresh fruits of love, but leave, as love might pray, White violets there. THREE WEEKS OLD Three weeks since there was no such rose in being; Now may eyes made dim with deep delight See how fair it is, laugh with love, and seeing Praise the chance that bids us bless the sight. Three weeks old, and a very rose of roses, Bright and sweet as love is sweet and bright. Heaven and earth, till a man's life wanes and closes, Show not life or love a lovelier sight. Three weeks past have renewed the rosebright creature Day by day with life, and night by night. Love, though fain of its every faultless feature, Finds not words to match the silent sight. A CLASP OF HANDS I Soft, small, and sweet as sunniest flowers That bask in heavenly heat When bud by bud breaks, breathes, and cowers, Soft, small, and sweet. A babe's hands open as to greet The tender touch of ours And mock with motion faint and fleet The minutes of the new strange hours That earth, not heaven, must mete; Buds fragrant still from heaven's own bowers, Soft, small, and sweet. II A velvet vice with springs of steel That fasten in a trice And clench the fingers fast that feel A velvet vice— What man would risk the danger twice, Nor quake from head to heel? Whom would not one such test suffice? Well may we tremble as we kneel In sight of Paradise, If both a babe's closed fists conceal A velvet vice. III Two flower-soft fists of conquering clutch, Two creased and dimpled wrists, That match, if mottled overmuch, Two flower-soft fists— What heart of man dare hold the lists Against such odds and such Sweet vantage as no strength resists? Our strength is all a broken crutch, Our eyes are dim with mists, Our hearts are prisoners as we touch Two flower-soft fists. PROLOGUE TO DOCTOR FAUSTUS Light, as when dawn takes wing and smites the sea, Smote England when his day bade Marlowe be. No fire so keen had thrilled the clouds of time Since Dante's breath made Italy sublime. Earth, bright with flowers whose dew shone soft as tears, Through Chaucer cast her charm on eyes and ears: The lustrous laughter of the love-lit earth Rang, leapt, and lightened in his might of mirth. Deep moonlight, hallowing all the breathless air, Made earth and heaven for Spenser faint and fair. But song might bid not heaven and earth be one Till Marlowe's voice gave warning of the sun. Thought quailed and fluttered as a wounded bird Till passion fledged the wing of Marlowe's word. Faith born of fear bade hope and doubt be dumb Till Marlowe's pride bade light or darkness come. Then first our speech was thunder: then our song Shot lightning through the clouds that wrought us wrong. Blind fear, whose faith feeds hell with fire, became A moth self-shrivelled in its own blind flame. We heard, in tune with even our seas that roll, The speech of storm, the thunders of the soul. Men's passions, clothed with all the woes they wrought, Shone through the fire of man's transfiguring thought. The thirst of knowledge, quenchless at her springs, Ambition, fire that clasps the thrones of kings, Love, light that makes of life one lustrous hour, And song, the soul's chief crown and throne of power, The hungering heart of greed and ravenous hate, Made music high as heaven and deep as fate. Strange pity, scarce half scornful of her tear, In Berkeley's vaults bowed down on Edward's bier. But higher in forceful flight of song than all The soul of man, its own imperious thrall, Rose, when his royal spirit of fierce desire Made life and death for man one flame of fire. Incarnate man, fast bound as earth and sea, Spake, when his pride would fain set Faustus free. Eternal beauty, strong as day and night, Shone, when his word bade Helen back to sight. Fear, when he bowed the soul before her spell, Thundered and lightened through the vaults of hell. The music known of all men's tongues that sing, When Marlowe sang, bade love make heaven of spring; The music none but English tongues may make, Our own sole song, spake first when Marlowe spake; And on his grave, though there no stone may stand, The flower it shows was laid by Shakespeare's hand. PROLOGUE TO ARDEN OF FEVERSHAM Love dark as death and fierce as fire on wing Sustains in sin the soul that feels it cling Like flame whose tongues are serpents: hope and fear Die when a love more dire than hate draws near, And stings to death the heart it cleaves in twain, And leaves in ashes all but fear and pain. Our lustrous England rose to life and light From Rome's and hell's immitigable night, And music laughed and quickened from her breath, When first her sons acclaimed Elizabeth. Her soul became a lyre that all men heard Who felt their souls give back her lyric word. Yet now not all at once her perfect power Spake: man's deep heart abode awhile its hour, Abode its hour of utterance; not to wake Till Marlowe's thought in thunderous music spake. But yet not yet was passion's tragic breath Thrilled through with sense of instant life and death, Life actual even as theirs who watched the strife, Death dark and keen and terrible as life. Here first was truth in song made perfect: here Woke first the war of love and hate and fear. A man too vile for thought's or shame's control Holds empire on a woman's loftier soul, And withers it to wickedness: in vain Shame quickens thought with penitential pain: In vain dark chance's fitful providence Withholds the crime, and chills the spirit of sense: It wakes again in fire that burns away Repentance, weak as night devoured of day. Remorse, and ravenous thirst of sin and crime, Rend and consume the soul in strife sublime, And passion cries on pity till it hear And tremble as with love that casts out fear. Dark as the deed and doom he gave to fame For ever lies the sovereign singer's name. Sovereign and regent on the soul he lives While thought gives thanks for aught remembrance gives, And mystery sees the imperial shadow stand By Marlowe's side alone at Shakespeare's hand. PROLOGUE TO OLD FORTUNATUS The golden bells of fairyland, that ring Perpetual chime for childhood's flower-sweet spring, Sang soft memorial music in his ear Whose answering music shines about us here. Soft laughter as of light that stirs the sea With darkling sense of dawn ere dawn may be, Kind sorrow, pity touched with gentler scorn, Keen wit whose shafts were sunshafts of the morn, Love winged with fancy, fancy thrilled with love, An eagle's aim and ardour in a dove, A man's delight and passion in a child, Inform it as when first they wept and smiled. Life, soiled and rent and ringed about with pain Whose touch lent action less of spur than chain, Left half the happiness his birth designed, And half the power, unquenched in heart and mind. Comrade and comforter, sublime in shame, A poor man bound in prison whence he came Poor, and took up the burden of his life Smiling, and strong to strive with sorrow and strife, He spake in England's ear the poor man's word, Manful and mournful, deathless and unheard. His kind great heart was fire, and love's own fire, Compassion, strong as flesh may feel desire, To enkindle pity and mercy toward a soul Sunk down in shame too deep for shame's control. His kind keen eye was light to lighten hope Where no man else might see life's darkness ope And pity's touch bring forth from evil good, Sweet as forgiveness, strong as fatherhood. Names higher than his outshine it and outsoar, But none save one should memory cherish more: Praise and thanksgiving crown the names above, But him we give the gift he gave us, love. PROLOGUE TO THE DUCHESS OF MALFY When Shakespeare soared from life to death, above All praise, all adoration, save of love, As here on earth above all men he stood That were or are or shall be—great, and good, Past thank or thought of England or of man— Light from the sunset quickened as it ran. His word, who sang as never man may sing And spake as never voice of man may ring, Not fruitless fell, as seed on sterile ways, But brought forth increase even to Shakespeare's praise. Our skies were thrilled and filled, from sea to sea, With stars outshining all their suns to be. No later light of tragic song they knew Like his whose lightning clove the sunset through. Half Shakespeare's glory, when his hand sublime Bade all the change of tragic life and time Live, and outlive all date of quick and dead, Fell, rested, and shall rest on Webster's head. Round him the shadows cast on earth by light Rose, changed, and shone, transfiguring death and night. Where evil only crawled and hissed and slew On ways where nought save shame and bloodshed grew, He bade the loyal light of honour live, And love, when stricken through the heart, forgive. Deep down the midnight of the soul of sin He lit the star of mercy throned therein. High up the darkness of sublime despair He set the sun of love to triumph there. Things foul or frail his touch made strong and pure, And bade things transient like to stars endure. Terror, on wings whose flight made night in heaven, Pity, with hands whence life took love for leaven, Breathed round him music whence his mortal breath Drew life that bade forgetfulness and death Die: life that bids his light of fiery fame Endure with England's, yea, with Shakespeare's name. PROLOGUE TO THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY Fire, and behind the breathless flight of fire Thunder that quickens fear and quells desire, Make bright and loud the terror of the night Wherein the soul sees only wrath for light. Wrath winged by love and sheathed by grief in steel Sets on the front of crime death's withering seal. The heaving horror of the storms of sin Brings forth in fear the lightning hid therein, And flashes back to darkness: truth, found pure And perfect, asks not heaven if shame endure. What life and death were his whose raging song Bore heaven such witness of the wild world's wrong, What hand was this that grasped such thunder, none Knows: night and storm seclude him from the sun. By daytime none discerns the fire of Mars: Deep darkness bares to sight the sterner stars, The lights whose dawn seems doomsday. None may tell Whence rose a world so lit from heaven and hell. Life-wasting love, hate born of raging lust, Fierce retribution, fed with death's own dust And sorrow's pampering poison, cross and meet, And wind the world in passion's winding-sheet. So, when dark faith in faith's dark ages heard Falsehood, and drank the poison of the Word, Two shades misshapen came to monstrous birth, A father fiend in heaven, a thrall on earth: Man, meanest born of beasts that press the sod, And die: the vilest of his creatures, God. A judge unjust, a slave that praised his name, Made life and death one fire of sin and shame. And thence reverberate even on Shakespeare's age A light like darkness crossed his sunbright stage. Music, sublime as storm or sorrow, sang Before it: tempest like a harpstring rang. The fiery shadow of a name unknown Rose, and in song's high heaven abides alone. PROLOGUE TO THE BROKEN HEART The mightiest choir of song that memory hears Gave England voice for fifty lustrous years. Sunrise and thunder fired and shook the skies That saw the sun-god Marlowe's opening eyes. The morn's own music, answered of the sea, Spake, when his living lips bade Shakespeare be, And England, made by Shakespeare's quickening breath Divine and deathless even till life be death, Brought forth to time such godlike sons of men That shamefaced love grows pride, and now seems then. Shame that their day so shone, so sang, so died, Remembering, finds remembrance one with pride. That day was clouding toward a stormlit close When Ford's red sphere upon the twilight rose. Sublime with stars and sunset fire, the sky Glowed as though day, nigh dead, should never die. Sorrow supreme and strange as chance or doom Shone, spake, and shuddered through the lustrous gloom. Tears lit with love made all the darkening air Bright as though death's dim sunrise thrilled it there And life re-risen took comfort. Stern and still As hours and years that change and anguish fill, The strong secluded spirit, ere it woke, Dwelt dumb till power possessed it, and it spoke. Strange, calm, and sure as sense of beast or bird, Came forth from night the thought that breathed the word; That chilled and thrilled with passion-stricken breath Halls where Calantha trod the dance of death. A strength of soul too passionately pure To change for aught that horror bids endure, To quail and wail and weep faint life away Ere sovereign sorrow smite, relent, and slay, Sustained her silent, till her bridal bloom Changed, smiled, and waned in rapture toward the tomb. Terror twin-born with pity kissed and thrilled The lips that Shakespeare's word or Webster's filled: Here both, cast out, fell silent: pity shrank, Rebuked, and terror, spirit-stricken, sank: The soul assailed arose afar above All reach of all but only death and love. PROLOGUE TO A VERY WOMAN Swift music made of passion's changeful power, Sweet as the change that leaves the world in flower When spring laughs winter down to deathward, rang From grave and gracious lips that smiled and sang When Massinger, too wise for kings to hear And learn of him truth, wisdom, faith, or fear, Gave all his gentler heart to love's light lore, That grief might brood and scorn breed wrath no more. Soft, bright, fierce, tender, fitful, truthful, sweet, A shrine where faith and change might smile and meet, A soul whose music could but shift its tune As when the lustrous year turns May to June And spring subsides in summer, so makes good Its perfect claim to very womanhood. The heart that hate of wrong made fire, the hand Whose touch was fire as keen as shame's own brand When fraud and treason, swift to smile and sting, Crowned and discrowned a tyrant, knave or king, False each and ravenous as the fitful sea, Grew gently glad as love that fear sets free. Like eddying ripples that the wind restrains, The bright words whisper music ere it wanes. Ere fades the sovereign sound of song that rang As though the sun to match the sea's tune sang, When noon from dawn took life and light, and time Shone, seeing how Shakespeare made the world sublime, Ere sinks the wind whose breath was heaven's and day's, The sunset's witness gives the sundawn praise. PROLOGUE TO THE SPANISH GIPSY The wind that brings us from the springtide south Strange music as from love's or life's own mouth Blew hither, when the blast of battle ceased That swept back southward Spanish prince and priest, A sound more sweet than April's flower-sweet rain, And bade bright England smile on pardoned Spain. The land that cast out Philip and his God Grew gladly subject where Cervantes trod. Even he whose name above all names on earth Crowns England queen by grace of Shakespeare's birth Might scarce have scorned to smile in God's wise down And gild with praise from heaven an earthlier crown. And he whose hand bade live down lengthening years Quixote, a name lit up with smiles and tears, Gave the glad watchword of the gipsies' life, Where fear took hope and grief took joy to wife. Times change, and fame is fitful as the sea: But sunset bids not darkness always be, And still some light from Shakespeare and the sun Burns back the cloud that masks not Middleton. With strong swift strokes of love and wrath he drew Shakespearean London's loud and lusty crew: No plainer might the likeness rise and stand When Hogarth took his living world in hand. No surer then his fire-fledged shafts could hit, Winged with as forceful and as faithful wit: No truer a tragic depth and heat of heart Glowed through the painter's than the poet's art. He lit and hung in heaven the wan fierce moon Whose glance kept time with witchcraft's air-struck tune: He watched the doors where loveless love let in The pageant hailed and crowned by death and sin He bared the souls where love, twin-born with hate, Made wide the way for passion-fostered fate. All English-hearted, all his heart arose To scourge with scorn his England's cowering foes: And Rome and Spain, who bade their scorner be Their prisoner, left his heart as England's free. Now give we all we may of all his due To one long since thus tried and found thus true. PROLOGUE TO THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN Sweet as the dewfall, splendid as the south, Love touched with speech Boccaccio's golden mouth, Joy thrilled and filled its utterance full with song, And sorrow smiled on doom that wrought no wrong. A starrier lustre of lordlier music rose Beyond the sundering bar of seas and snows When Chaucer's thought took life and light from his And England's crown was one with Italy's. Loftiest and last, by grace of Shakespeare's word, Arose above their quiring spheres a third, Arose, and flashed, and faltered: song's deep sky Saw Shakespeare pass in light, in music die. No light like his, no music, man might give To bid the darkened sphere, left songless, live. Soft though the sound of Fletcher's rose and rang And lit the lunar darkness as it sang, Below the singing stars the cloud-crossed moon Gave back the sunken sun's a trembling tune. As when at highest high tide the sovereign sea Pauses, and patience doubts if passion be, Till gradual ripples ebb, recede, recoil, Shine, smile, and whisper, laughing as they toil, Stark silence fell, at turn of fate's high tide, Upon his broken song when Shakespeare died, Till Fletcher's light sweet speech took heart to say What evening, should it speak for morning, may. And fourfold now the gradual glory shines That shows once more in heaven two twinborn signs, Two brethren stars whose light no cloud may fret, No soul whereon their story dawns forget. THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE Let there be light, said Time: and England heard: And manhood grew to godhead at the word. No light had shone, since earth arose from sleep, So far; no fire of thought had cloven so deep. A day beyond all days bade life acclaim Shakespeare: and man put on his crowning name. All secrets once through darkling ages kept Shone, sang, and smiled to think how long they slept. Man rose past fear of lies whereon he trod: And Dante's ghost saw hell devour his God. Bright Marlowe, brave as winds that brave the sea When sundawn bids their bliss in battle be, Lit England first along the ways whereon Song brighter far than sunlight soared and shone. He died ere half his life had earned his right To lighten time with song's triumphant light. Hope shrank, and felt the stroke at heart: but one She knew not rose, a man to match the sun. And England's hope and time's and man's became Joy, deep as music's heart and keen as flame. Not long, for heaven on earth may live not long, Light sang, and darkness died before the song. He passed, the man above all men, whose breath Transfigured life with speech that lightens death. He passed: but yet for many a lustrous year His light of song bade England shine and hear. As plague and fire and faith in falsehood spread, So from the man of men, divine and dead, Contagious godhead, seen, unknown, and heard, Fulfilled and quickened England; thought and word, When men would fain set life to music, grew More sweet than years which knew not Shakespeare knew. The simplest soul that set itself to song Sang, and may fear not time's or change's wrong. The lightest eye that glanced on life could see Through grief and joy the God that man might be. All passion whence the living soul takes fire Till death fulfil despair and quench desire, All love that lightens through the cloud of chance, All hate that lurks in hope and smites askance, All holiness of sorrow, all divine Pity, whose tears are stars that save and shine, All sunbright strength of laughter like the sea's When spring and autumn loose their lustrous breeze, All sweet, all strange, all sad, all glorious things, Lived on his lips, and hailed him king of kings. All thought, all strife, all anguish, all delight, Spake all he bade, and speak till day be night. No soul that heard, no spirit that beheld, Knew not the God that lured them and compelled. On Beaumont's brow the sun arisen afar Shed fire which lit through heaven the younger star That sank before the sunset: one dark spring Slew first the kinglike subject, then the king. The glory left above their graves made strong The heart of Fletcher, till the flower-sweet song That Shakespeare culled from Chaucer's field, and died, Found ending on his lips that smiled and sighed. From Dekker's eyes the light of tear-touched mirth Shone as from Shakespeare's, mingling heaven and earth. Wild witchcraft's lure and England's love made one With Shakespeare's heart the heart of Middleton. Harsh, homely, true, and tragic, Rowley told His heart's debt down in rough and radiant gold. The skies that Tourneur's lightning clove and rent Flamed through the clouds where Shakespeare's thunder went. Wise Massinger bade kings be wise in vain Ere war bade song, storm-stricken, cower and wane. Kind Heywood, simple-souled and single-eyed, Found voice for England's home-born praise and pride. Strange grief, strange love, strange terror, bared the sword That smote the soul by grace and will of Ford. The stern grim strength of Chapman's thought found speech Loud as when storm at ebb-tide rends the beach: And all the honey brewed from flowers in May Made sweet the lips and bright the dreams of Day. But even as Shakespeare caught from Marlowe's word Fire, so from his the thunder-bearing third, Webster, took light and might whence none but he Hath since made song that sounded so the sea Whose waves are lives of men—whose tidestream rolls From year to darkening year the freight of souls. Alone above it, sweet, supreme, sublime, Shakespeare attunes the jarring chords of time; Alone of all whose doom is death and birth, Shakespeare is lord of souls alive on earth. DEDICATION [The sea that is life everlasting] The sea that is life everlasting And death everlasting as life Abides not a pilot's forecasting, Foretells not of peace or of strife. The might of the night that was hidden Arises and darkens the day, A glory rebuked and forbidden, Time's crown, and his prey. No sweeter, no kindlier, no fairer, No lovelier a soul from its birth Wore ever a brighter and rarer Life's raiment for life upon earth Than his who enkindled and cherished Art's vestal and luminous flame, That dies not when kingdoms have perished In storm or in shame. No braver, no trustier, no purer, No stronger and clearer a soul Bore witness more splendid and surer For manhood found perfect and whole Since man was a warrior and dreamer Than his who in hatred of wrong Would fain have arisen a redeemer By sword or by song. Twin brethren in spirit, immortal As art and as love, which were one For you from the birthday whose portal First gave you to sight of the sun, To-day nor to-night nor to-morrow May bring you again from above, Drawn down by the spell of the sorrow Whose anguish is love. No light rearising hereafter Shall lighten us here as of old When seasons were lustrous as laughter Of waves that are snowshine and gold. The dawn that imbues and enkindles Life's fluctuant and fugitive sea Dies down as the starshine that dwindles And cares not to be. Men, mightier than death which divides us, Friends, dearer than sorrow can say, The light that is darkness and hides us Awhile from each other away Abides but awhile and endures not, We know, though the day be as night, For souls that forgetfulness lures not Till sleep be in sight. The sleep that enfolds you, the slumber Supreme and eternal on earth, Whence ages of numberless number Shall bring us not back into birth, We know not indeed if it be not What no man hath known if it be, Life, quickened with light that we see not If spirits may see. The love that would see and would know it Is even as the love of a child. But the fire of the fame of the poet Who gazed on the past, and it smiled, But the light of the fame of the painter Whose hand was as morning's in May, Death bids not be darker or fainter, Time casts not away. We, left of them loveless and lonely, Who lived in the light of their love, Whose darkness desires it, we only, Who see them afar and above, So far, if we die not, above us, So lately no dearer than near, May know not of death if they love us, Of night if they hear. We, stricken and darkling and living, Who loved them and love them, abide A day, and the gift of its giving, An hour, and the turn of its tide, When twilight and midnight and morrow Shall pass from the sight of the sun, And death be forgotten, and sorrow Discrowned and undone. For us as for these will the breathless Brief minute arise and pass by: And if death be not utterly deathless, If love do not utterly die, From the life that is quenched as an ember The soul that aspires as a flame Can choose not but wholly remember Love, lovelier than fame. Though sure be the seal of their glory And fairer no fame upon earth, Though never a leaf shall grow hoary Of the crowns that were given them at birth, While time as a vassal doth duty To names that he towers not above, More perfect in price and in beauty For ever is love. The night is upon us, and anguish Of longing that yearns for the dead. But mourners that faint not or languish, That veil not and bow not the head, Take comfort to heart if a token Be given them of comfort to be: While darkness on earth is unbroken, Light lives on the sea.</field>
