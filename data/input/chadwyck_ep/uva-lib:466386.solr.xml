      <field name="fulltext">THE TRIUMPH OF REFORM! A COMIC POEM. 1 John Bull an honest Country 'Squire, Liv'd on his own Estate; Contented by his homely fire, Nor seeking to be great. 2 He lov'd his King—upheld his Church— Paid deference to his Laws; Nor e'er was known a friend to lurch, Who had a righteous cause! 3 As for his Wife, dear as his life, John priz'd his Heart's elected! His Children prov'd how well he lov'd, That she was ne'er neglected! 4 John had a numerous Family, Few could with his compare; His Daughters they were fair to see, And pure as they were fair! 5 His Sons, a bold and manly race, Were fam'd for arts and arms;— Alike, skill'd in the plough—the chase,— Or battle's stern alarms! 6 John paid his way, he till'd, to pay The land on which he liv'd; Rose with the lark, work'd hard all day, And health with wealth receiv'd! 7 He lov'd good cheer, ador'd Roast-Beef, And often had a feast; Could with Plum-Pudding charm each grief, And joy'd to see a guest. 8 Bless'd with a glorious Constitution, No wonder he was stout; Good fare, he said, gave resolution, Roast-Beef kept weakness out! 9 A generous Landlord, he reliev'd Each Tenant in disaster; His servants he ne'er idly griev'd,— He was a kind good master. 10 He had a Lease of his Estate, For John for squalls provides: A Charter that was truly Great; His ‘Rights’ secur'd besides! 11 Thus long John Bull had liv'd in peace And comfort, on his labours; Seeing his joys and stores encrease, And valued by his Neighbours. 12 But, ah! he now and then would fight, And with those Neighbours quarrel; For he'd in strong beer great delight, And often tapp'd the barrel! 13 Then, too, his stomach was so great, He would to no one humble! It pleas'd him of his rights to prate, And at his wrongs to grumble! 14 In short, John Bull, the truth to say, Was somewhat of a Bruin, And to his fondness, for a fray It was, he owed his ruin! 15 For though his courage, strength and might! Still made him conqueror, yet As he'd to pay for every fight, It run him soon in Debt! 16 And money he was forced to borrow, Large Interest he'd to pay;— Paving the way for future sorrow, A dreadful settling day! 17 Which brings me to this “ow're true tale,” Of facts it is, I write! John plung'd in Debt, head over tail, Through this his love for fight. 18 Then he in Law had many suits, One “Yankey versus Bull,” He lost, and such its heavy fruits, It made his courage cool! 19 He won the other, “Bull 'gainst French,” But 'twas so long about, And gave his pockets such a drench, It fairly cleaned him out;— 20 Took all his cash, made him draw bills, And only pay in paper,— In short brought on a thousand ills, And left small cause for vapour! 21 'Twas 'bout a dish they both had dress'd, They fought like dog and cat! For French, the Boney-part possessed, And wanted John Bull's fat! 22 So high John's rents this made him raise, The interest to defray; His Tenants on their settling days, Found they could scarcely pay. 23 But this, alas! was not the worst,— Involved, perplexed, John Bull, Forc'd to his Servants now to trust, Became their prey—their tool! 24 On private gain alone intent, To pilfer was their plan; To conscience they a deaf ear lent, The reign of waste began! 25 In John's Great House,—through thick and thin, Resolv'd to keep their places,— They brought their own relations in, And bought new ribbons—laces! 26 The Agencies, upon the farm, To rogues and knaves they sold; The better to prevent Reform— Nor let the truth be told. 27 The list of John Bull's pensioned poor,— Whose strength, by age decreas'd, He paid for, from his private store,— Most foully they encreas'd! 28 Fix'd in it many a shameless dame, The stocks had better grac'd; And many a dolt, known but by name, They in its columns plac'd. 29 Corruption soon bore general sway, And Bribery, oh, shame! “Notorious, as” is “at noon day, The sun itself” became! 30 In vain the tenants, their complaints To John's Great House convey'd; John's Servants seem'd to him such Saints, No heed to ought he paid! 31 Petitions Meetings, were in vain, Corruptions course to stem; Poor John Bull's Tenants could not gain, One soul to speak for them! 32 The force of bad example then, John's family too, proved! His Sons set up for gentlemen, And drank, and gamed, and roved. 33 Frequented Operas, Balls, and Plays! In work took no delight;— Like Dandies dress'd themselves in stays, And smok'd cigars all night! 34 The Daughters too, forsook their cows! To play on the piano! At farmers' sons turn'd up their nose, And flaunted o'er the manor. 35 Lisp'd forth bad French, and squall'd Sol fa Dress'd all in silks and satins; Began to call their father “Pa,” And burnt their mother's pattens!— 36 The waste grew greater every hour, Hoodwink'd were John Bull's eyes: Distress, on all, its withering power Began to exercise! 37 Despair alone the tenants saw!— With lives and goods they sported; They burnt John's ricks, he took the law, And some of them transported! 38 But to John's Servants, now awhile, The muse, per-force, digresses;— They look'd on with a heartless smile, Though causing these distresses! 39 'Tis fit, we give their names and state, Though shown now of their glory! Their history we must relate, To verify our story. 40 John's steward, Arthur, in John's Fights, His second oft had been, And had of old upheld his rights, For he'd much service seen! 41 He was a bold and skilful man, And Generalship possess'd: But all to grasp, was still his plan, Acquirement fir'd his breast! 42 He said, John must despotic rule, His Tenants to keep under; Should beat them all, like boys at school, And speak in voice of thunder! 43 That they had nought to do but pay, That John their minds must fetter; Nor heed aught they might choose to say, For things could not ‘work’ better! 44 That though about distress, a fuss Was made, still the estate, Had never been more prosperous, Nor John Bull half so great! 45 He clearly the Old Soldier played, The more to cousin John: And yet he was an active blade, And better might have done! 46 The Irish labourers he free'd, That came for John to toil; And gave them leave their rights to plead, And have their share of spoil! 47 John's Housekeeper, who bore a bob, In all that Arthur did, Was one, who would do any job, His fellow-servant bid! 48 His name was Robert, perquisites He dearly lov'd to share! The candle ends were his delights, The cheese be joy'd to pare! 49 But we the truth must not conceal, The rotter cheer'd his heart, And what he said was but the Peel, Was oft the greater part! 50 He said John Bull a hundred rats, About the House might see, But t'was well known, a dozen cats Could not catch rats like he! 51 Himself, he 'gainst the tenants match'd, That John they might not fleece, And that the farm might be well watch'd He raised a New Police! 52 Bob was an useful man enough About a House to be; Of talk he'd always quantum suff., If he'd had honesty! 53 Both he and Arthur had agreed, Their master's ‘loaves and fishes’ Were for no other end decreed, But to fill up their dishes! 54 And that they might not be turn'd out, (The Tenants wishes granting,) They soon convinc'd John, past all doubt, That no Reform was wanting! 55 But spite of all that they could say, John was not quite contented; He soon began to fall away, And his decline lamented! 56 His appetite began to fail, That he thought everlasting; And so much did his spirits quail, He talk'd one day of Fasting! 57 His dinner's joys gave no delight, He sat with folded arms; Roast-Beef itself fail'd to invite, Plum-Pudding had no charms! 58 While Mr. Bull was thus perplex'd, His Neighbours, in their turn, Had, with their tenants, been as vex'd,— At power they'd dar'd to spurn! 59 The Tenants of his neighbour, French, Were knocking old things down!— And had, to shew they would retrench, Reduc'd their rents, a crown. 60 They swore their rights they'd have protected, Their lease should be observ'd; So a new landlord they elected, One Philip! well who'd serv'd! 61 Then Nicholas who keeps Wild Beasts, Felt rather sore, 'tis droll! Because his Bears, despite some priests, Were stirr'd-up by a Pole. 62 And Mr. Belge having had too much Of Hollands, when they'd settle, Had with his landlord too a touch, For offering him Dutch metal! 63 And even some Italian boys, Who liv'd on maccaroni, 'Gainst cousin Germans made a noise, And spurn'd the name of crony 64 This rous'd the Tenants of John Bull, Corruption's hold to storm, They vow'd they'd altogether pull, And die or have Reform! 65 Declared they would have proper men, Their fights to represent, His servants' roguery to condemn, And tell John what they meant. 66 'Twas well for Bull he had a friend, To check the coming riot; One who would mutual rights defend, And treachery disquiet! 67 Young Russell, of a noble race, The noblest son of all! Who in his line could patriots trace, Had dar'd for John to fall! 68 He sought the ‘Squire,’ and cried “Arouse” Look, Sir, to your estate, Amend th' abuses of your house, Ere yet it be too late! 69 “Your Servants grossly, Sir, deceive, Arthur his duty slights; Your faithful Tenants, Sir, believe,— Grant them, John Bull, their rights. 70 “Too long they've begg'd and pray'd, in vain, Have pin'd in misery, John Bull must be John Bull again, Or he will cease to be! 71 “Yes they must Represented be, There must be a Reform; Or soon to hold you, Sir, you'll see The house will be too warm! 72 “You 'n your duty must not fail, Your rents you must reduce, Your pension list you must curtail, Or, 'twill be little use! 73 “You've Agents, Sir, for empty barns, Stone walls—a barren plain— But mind it is a friend that warns, You must cut short their reign! 74 “A numerous family there are, The Boroughs'—men! no doubt, You know, they're known, Sir, near and far, Root the food 'mongers out! 75 “They are a rank and rotten set, A vile corrupted race, And only in your house, John, get, To gain themselves a place! 76 “They have not, Sir, your Tenants' voice, They're neither sound nor staunch; They are not, Sir, your Tenants' choice, Out with them root and branch! 77 “Let those who pay, fit members choose, To watch their rights at home; For think, if you their aid should lose, What would of you become! 78 “Turn out the drones, the locusts, knaves, That now your house deform! The traitors, sycophants, the slaves, Effect one grand Reform! 79 “But this, from ruin can protect! Believe my words are true! Should you my warnings, John, neglect, Till latest years you'll rue! 80 “Our dear Chief Magistrate, God bless him! Long may he live and reign, May care and roguish ne'er distress him, Will help you, might and main! 81 “About it! not a moment lose, But with your tenants pull! Reform or ruin—you must choose, Awake! arouse! John Bull!” 82 “Hey what!” cried John, “can this be true? It must you'd not deceive! No, Russell! I may trust to you, You're one I can believe. 83 “How have I been impos'd upon, Been gull'd, but it is o'er; I have indeed been, ‘easy John,’ But I'll be so no more! 84 “Arthur shall to the right about— Bob's house too, soon I'll storm: Yes, one and all, they shall turn out, By Jove! I'll have Reform! 85 “They've robb'd me, plung'd me into debt, My interest they have slighted, But a new household I will get, My Tenants shall be righted! 86 “‘New Brooms sweep clean?’ give me my Wig, The House I'll clear at once; Again my porter I will swig In joy, or I'm a dunce! 87 “There's a Grey-headed worthy man, That shall my Steward be; He, of Reform has drawn a plan, He long ago show'd me! 88 “In March that plan you shall bring forth, Its march shall then begin, When once my tenants know its worth, Their hearts and souls you'll win! 89 “The Boroughs, venal set, may rail, The turn'd out crew may swear; But bid them, it their hearts will quail, The ‘Ides of March, beware!’ 90 “Come, to the House we'll go direct, The plan you shall propose; Reform! for ever, we'll effect, The rogues accounts we'll close!” 91 They went, young Russell broach'd his plan, Show'd what John wish'd Reform'd; 'Twas then the war of words began, Lord, how Bob rav'd and storm'd! 92 The Boroughmen, with one acclaim, Their voices 'gainst it rais'd: Heap'd curses on its very name, And all corruption prais'd! 93 “Would you o'er-turn,” they cried, “by storm, Each Ancient Institution? We tell you what you call Reform, Is down-right Revolution! 94 “It will not do—it must not be, You'll ruin the whole Nation! Preserve the system's purity, We want no Innovation!” 95 A Pretty Lawyer without cause, The plan most strangely Twiss-ted; Abused Shopkeepers and the laws, And on no change insisted! 96 One old Knave, swore he'd Weather-all, And at the project jested, Cut jokes upon th' expected fall, And, that 'twas wrong protested! 97 John's Hunt's-man who, Reform to aid, Prest-on, through thick and thin, Turn'd tail! and soon was seen, 'tis said, With Bob's own whipper-in! 98 But worse, John's Clergyman, whose creed It was to right each wrong, That he might still on John Bull feed, Join'd the opposing throng! 99 As for the rest, how did they bawl, They rais'd a horrid rout, Swore, unâ voce, one and all, By Jove! they'd not turn out! 100 Foil'd in his plans, and set at nought, John did not stay to prate, Short work he made, at once he sought, His good Chief Magistrate! 101 Who heard his Tenants' tale of woe, And cried, “ah! slaves of pelf— Give me a Broom, by Jove I'll go And clear the House myself!” 102 He went—when uprose fool and dunce Swore they of life were Lords! But William cleared the House at once, Proof to their war of words. 103 He clos'd the doors, “now John,” said he, “Choose Servants that will serve, Prove but Reform, you want, to me; And you'll not find me swerve.” 104 John, thankful, to the statute went, New servants to engage; Servants to do their duty bent, And shine in history's page. 105 But, honest man, how did he stare, And burn in every vein, To see the old crew waiting there, To be engaged again. 106 Quoth he, “I'm not of sense bereft, You don't again gull me;” They brib'd—in vain—they all were left, In the Minority! 107 New Servants hired—so well their part, They play'd—they guile defied, In vain the old ones, every art, To foil John's purpose tried. 108 They storm'd—they shifted, senseless fools; Reform they could not foil; The people vow'd and swore, the tools Should render up their spoil. 109 Now Arthur finding this the case, Mov'd by the love of pelf, Thought he'd best get again his place, And give Reform himself. 110 So to the Manor House direct, Where liv'd our Magistrate, (What after this might John expect?) He went by the back gate. 111 Urg'd on by one still worse than he, Born but to Cumber-land, Who hail'd his treachery with glee, And join'd him heart and hand! 112 The Lady of our Magistrate, And all his Family, Alas! that they should take the bait, Nor their sad folly see— 113 They first won over to their cause, No doubt by lies enough, Got to then talk about the Laws, And rioting and stuff— 114 To the good-natured easy wight Who dearly lov'd his wife! And lectur'd him so, day and night, He grew quite tired of life. 115 They plainly told him, honest man, If he at peace would be, To his Grey-headed servant's plan, That he must not agree. 116 And thus, alas! in evil hour, So poisoned was his ear, He faltered—and when ask'd,—his power, He did not make a-peer! 117 His servants left him—John Bull stared But on reform still bent; Shrunk not, but, till 'twas pass'd, declar'd That he would pay no rent! 118 This startled William! soon he saw That no time should be lost;— If he refus'd John Bull his Law, That it a crown might cost! 119 At once he to his senses came, Children and wife defied, Gain'd back again his own good name, Again became John's pride! 120 John, back'd by him, 'gainst Arthur's throng, Now firmly kept the field! Those who had Lorded it so long, Were forc'd despite, to yield. 121 In every point the faction fail'd, That reason's rights withstood; Reform triumphantly prevail'd, Prelude to worlds of good! 122 John's Tenants hail'd it, bidding cease Each ill that can annoy; Sure harbinger of Plenty, Peace, Prosperity, and Joy! 123 Be ever fam'd the noble band, This blessing that obtained; By whose proud deeds a suffering land, Redress at length has gain'd. 124 Bright shine their names in history's roll, From age to age renowned; Their influence felt from Pole to Pole, With endless praises crowned!</field>
