      <field name="fulltext">To the Reader. Peruse with heede, then frendlie iudge, and blaming rashe refraine: So maist thou reade vnto thy good, and shalt requite my paine. [THE FIRST PARTE] TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, MY SINGVLER GOOD Lorde and Maister, Robert Earle of Leycester, Baron of Denbighe, Knight of the moste noble orders of the garter, and of saincte Michaël, Maister of her Ma???? horse, one of her Highnes moste honorable priuie Counsaile, and Lorde Lieutenant and Captaine Generall of her Ma???? forces in the lowe countries. ARTHVR BOVRCHIER TO THE READER. Perfection needes no other foyles, suche helpes comme out of place: For where it selfe, can grace it selfe, there needes no other grace. Why should I then my fruiteles praise on Whitneys worke bestowe, Where wisdome, learninge, and deuise, so perfectly doe flowe. Yet gentle Reader by thy leaue, thus muche I mente to wrighte, As one that honours these his giftes, but seekes them not t'indighte. No longe discourse, no tedious tale, I purpos'de am to tell: Lest thou shouldst saye, where is the nutte, you feede me with the shell. Goe forwarde then in happie time, and thou shalt surely finde, With coste, and Labour well set out, a banquet for thy minde. A storehouse for thy wise conceiptes, a whetstone for thy witte: Where, eache man maye with daintie choice his fancies finely fitte. Giue Whitney then thy good report, since hee deserues the same: Lest that the wise that see thee coye, thy follie iustly blam?. D. O. M. Since man is fraile, and all his thoughtes are sinne, And of him selfe he can no good inuent, Then euerie one, before they oughte beginne, Should call on God, from whome all grace is sent: So, I beseeche, that he the same will sende, That, to his praise J maie beginne, and ende. Te stante, virebo. A mightie Spyre, whose toppe dothe pierce the skie, An iuie greene imbraceth rounde about, And while it standes, the same doth bloome on highe, But when it shrinkes, the iuie standes in dowt: The Piller great, our gratious Princes is: The braunche, the Churche: whoe speakes vnto hir this. I, that of late with stormes was almoste spent, And brused sore with Tirants bluddie bloes, Whome fire, and sworde, with persecution rent, Am nowe sett free, and ouerlooke my foes, And whiles thow raignst, oh most renowmed Queene By thie supporte my blossome shall bee greene. Quàdij vocant, eundum. The trauaylinge man, vncertaine where to goe, When diuers wayes before his face did lie, Mercurius then, the perfect pathe did showe, Which when he tooke, hee neuer went awrie, But to his wishe, his iorneys ende did gaine In happie howre, by his direction plaine. This trauailinge man: doth tell our wandringe state, Before whose face, and eeke on euerye side, Bypathes, and wayes, appeare amidd our gate, That if the Lorde bee not our onlie guide: We stumble, fall, and dailie goe astraye, Then happie those, whome God doth shew the waye. Prouidentia. Svche prouidence hathe nature secret wroughte In creatures wilde, and eeke such knowledge straunge, That man, by them in somme thinges maie be taughte, As some foretell, when weather faire will chaunge, Of heate, of raine, of winde, and tempests rage, Some showe by signes, and with their songs presage. But leauing theise, which almost all doe knowe, The Crocodile, by whome th' Ægyptians watche, Howe farre that yeare shall mightie Nilus flowe, For theire shee likes to laie her egges, and hatche, Suche skill deuine, and science to foretell, Hath Nature lente vnto this Serpent fell. Which showes, They should with due regarde foresee, When anie one doth take in hande a cause, The drifte, and ende, of that they doe decree, And longe thereon to ponder, and to pause, For after witts, are like a shower of rayne Which moistes the soile, when withered is the graine. Veritas temporis filia. Three furies fell, which turne the worlde to ruthe, Both Enuie, Strife, and Slaunder, heare appeare, In dungeon darke they longe inclosed truthe, But Time at lengthe, did loose his daughter deare, And setts alofte, that sacred ladie brighte, Whoe things longe hidd, reueales, and bringes to lighte. Thoughe strife make fier, thoughe Enuie eate hir harte, The innocent though Slaunder rente, and spoile: Yet Time will comme, and take this ladies parte, And breake her bandes, and bring her foes to foile. Dispaire not then, thoughe truthe be hidden ofte, Bycause at lengthe, shee shall bee sett alofte. Dissidia inter æquales, pessima. The Swallowe swifte, dothe beare vnto her neste The Grasshopper, that did no daunger feare, For that shee thought, they lou'de togeather beste, Bycause they both, obseru'de one time of yeare, And bothe, did ioye theire iarringe notes to sounde, And neare the house they bothe, theire dwellings founde. Yet time, and tune, and neighbourhood forgotte, For perfect frende, a tyrant shee became, Which taxeth those, whome God dothe heare allotte Like gifts of grace, to winne a lasting name, Yet Enuie soe theire vertues doth deface, It makes them foes, to them theie should imbrace. Formicæ grata est formica, Cicada cic?dæ Et doctis doctus gaudet Apollo choris. Nic. Reusnerus. Temeritas. The waggoner, behoulde, is hedlonge throwen, And all in vaine doth take the raine in hande, If he be dwrawen by horses fierce vnknowen, Whose stomacks stowte, no taming vnderstande, They praunce, and yerke, and out of order flinge, Till all they breake, and vnto hauocke bringe. That man, whoe hath affections fowle vntam'de, And forwarde runnes neglecting reasons race, Deserues by right, of all men to bee blam'de, And headlonge falles at lengthe to his deface, Then bridle will, and reason make thy guide, So maiste thow stande, when others doune doe slide. Intestinæ simultates. When ciuill sworde is drawen out of the sheathe, And bluddie broiles, at home are set a broache, Then furious Mars with sworde doth rage beneathe, And to the Toppe, deuowring flames incroache, None helpes to quenche, but rather blowes the flame, And oile doe adde, and powder to the same. Intestine strife, is fearefull moste of all, This, makes the Sonne, to cut his fathers throate, This, parteth frendes, this, brothers makes to bralle, This, robbes the good, and setts the theeues a floate, This, Rome did feele, this, Germanie did taste, And often times, this noble Lande did waste. Non tibi, sed Religioni. The pastors good, that doe gladd tidinges preache, The godlie sorte, with reuerence do imbrace: Though they be men, yet since Godds worde they teache, Wee honor them, and giue them higheste place, Imbassadors of princes of the earthe, Haue royall Seates, thoughe base they are by birthe. Yet, if throwghe pride they doe them selues forgett, And make accompte that honor, to be theires: And doe not marke with in whose place they sett, Let them behowlde the asse, that ISIS beares, Whoe thowghte the men to honor him, did kneele, And staied therfore, till he the staffe did feele. For, as he pass'd with ISIS throughe the streete, And bare on backe, his holie rites about, Th' Ægyptians downe fell prostrate at his feete, Whereat, the Asse grewe arrogante, and stowte, Then saide the guide: oh foole not vnto thee, Theise people bowe, but vnto that they see? Experientia docet. A yovthefvll Prince, in prime of lustie yeares, Woulde vnderstande what weather shoulde betide, For that hee thoughte, with manie noble Peares To passe the time, on huntinge forth to ride: Th' Astronomer, did wishe hym staie at courte, For present raine, should hinder all their sporte. Which staied the Prince, but raine did none discende, Then, wente hee forth with manie Gallantes braue, But when he thought the clowdes, did droppes portend, Hee roade aside, a plowghmans skill to craue, Whoe, looking straighte vppon the varijng skie: Saide, twentie daies I thinke it will bee drie. Proceedinge then, his iudgement true was founde, Then, (quoth the Prince) weare thou the doctours Roabe, And geeue to him, thy Harrowe on the grownde, And in exchaunge, take thou his Spheare, and Gloabe: And further saied, henceforthe wee will allowe, That learninge shall vnto Experience bowe. Sirenes. Withe pleasaunte tunes, the Syrenes did allure Vlisses wise, to listen to theire songe: But nothinge could his manlie harte procure, Hee sailde awaie, and scap'd their charming stronge, The face, he lik'de: the nether parte, did loathe: For womans shape, and fishes had they bothe. Which shewes to vs, when Bewtie seekes to snare The carelesse man, whoe dothe no daunger dreede, That he shoulde flie, and shoulde in time beware, And not on lookes, his fickle fancie feede: Suche Mairemaides liue, that promise onelie ioyes: But hee that yeldes, at lengthe him selffe distroies. Hæc Venus ad musas: Venerem exhorrescite Nimphæ, In vos armatus aut amor insiliet. Cui contrà, musæ, verba hæc age dicito marti: Aliger huc ad nos non volat ille puer. Res humanæ in summo declinant. The gallante Shipp, that cutts the azure surge, And hathe both tide, and wisshed windes, at will: Her tackle sure, with shotte her foes to vrge, With Captaines boulde, and marriners of skill, With streamers, flagges, topgallantes, pendantes braue, When Seas do rage, is swallowed in the waue. The snowe, that falles vppon the mountaines greate, Though on the Alpes, which seeme the clowdes to reache. Can not indure the force of Phœbus heate, But wastes awaie, Experience doth vs teache: Which warneth all, on Fortunes wheele that clime To beare in minde how they haue but a time. Passibus ambiguis fortuna volubilis errat, Et manet in nullo certa, tena? loco. Sed modò læta manet, vultus modò sumit acerbos Et tantùm constans in leuitate sua est. Ouidius 5. Trist. 9. Frustrà. The Poëttes faine, that DANAVS daughters deare, Inioyned are to fill the fatall tonne: Where, thowghe they toile, yet are they not the neare, But as they powre, the water forthe dothe runne: No paine will serue, to fill it to the toppe, For, still at holes the same doth runne, and droppe. Which reprehendes, three sortes of wretches vaine, The blabbe, th' ingrate, and those that couet still, As first, the blabbe, no secretts can retaine.

Of NIOBE, behoulde the ruthefull plighte, Bicause shee did dispise the powers deuine: Her children all, weare slaine within her sighte, And, while her selfe with tricklinge teares did pine, Shee was transform'de, into a marble stone, Which, yet with teares, dothe seeme to waile, and mone. This tragedie, thoughe Poëtts first did frame, Yet maie it bee, to euerie one applide: That mortall men, shoulde thinke from whence they came, And not presume, nor puffe them vp with pride, Leste that the Lorde, whoe haughty hartes doth hate, Doth throwe them downe, when sure they thinke theyr state.

By which is ment, That those whoe do pursue Theire fancies fonde, and thinges vnlawfull craue, Like brutishe beastes appeare vnto the viewe, And shall at lenghte, Actæons guerdon haue: And as his houndes, soe theire affections base, Shall them deuowre, and all their deedes deface.

While HERCVLES, with mightie clubbe in hande In Lyons skinne did sleepe, and take his ease: About him straighte approch'de the Pigmeis bande, And for to kill this conquerour assaies, But foolishe dwarffes? theire force was all to smalle, For when he wak'de, like gnattes hee crush'd them all.

And he that lik'd to spende his time at dice, This lawe in Rome, Severvs did prouide: That euerie man, shoulde deeme him as a vice, And of his Landes, an other shoulde bee guide: Like Lawes beside, did diuers more deuise, And wisedome still, againste suche vnthriftes cries.

This reprehendes, the sonnes, or greedie frendes, That longe do hope, for deathe of aged Sires: And on theire goodes, doe feede before theire endes, For deathe ofte times, doth frustrate theire desires: And takes awaie, the yonge before the oulde, Let greedie heires, this looking glasse behoulde. Filius ante diem patrios inquirit in annos: Victa iacet pietas, &amp;c. Ouid. 1. Metamorph. Furor &amp; rabies. The crewell kinges, that are inflam'de with ire: With fier, and sworde, theire furious mindes suffise: And ofte to showe, what chiefelie they desire, Within theire sheildes, they dreadefull shapes deuise, Some Griphins feirce, some ramping Lions beare, Some Tygers fell, or Dragons like to weare. All which bewraye, theire inwarde bloodie thoughte, Suche one, behoulde, kinge Agamemnon was: Who had in shielde, a ramping Lion wroughte And eke this verse, was grauen in the brasse: Mannes terror this, to feare them that behoulde: Which shielde is borne, by Agamemnon boulde. Dum furor in cursu est, currenti cede furori: Difficiles aditus impetus omnis habet. Ouid. 1. Remed. Uarij hominum sensus. To Sir Henry Woodhowse Knight. An aged dame, in reuerence of the dead, With care did place, the sculles of men shee founde, Vppon an hill, as in a sacred bed, But as shee toil'de, shee stumbled to the grounde: Whereat, downe fell the heades within her lappe, And here, and there, they ranne abowt the hill: With that, quoth shee, no maruaile is this happe, Since men aliue, in myndes do differ still: And like as theise, in sunder downe do fall, So varried they, in their opinions all. Mille hominum species, &amp; rerum discolor vsus. Velle suum cuique est, nec voto viuitur vno.

Marte &amp; arte. To Sir William Standley Knight. Where courage great, and consaile good doe goe, With lastinge fame, the victorie is wonne: But seperate theise, then feare the ouerthrowe, And strengthe alone, dothe vnto ruine ronne: Then Captaines good, must ioyne theise two, in one: And not presume with this, or that, alone. As valiant hartes, and corage highe beseeme, The Captaines boulde, that enterprise for fame: Soe muste they still, of pollicie esteeme, And wisedomes rules, to bringe to passe the same: While Cæsar great, subdude the countries farre: In gowne at home, did Tvllie helpe to warre. Vlisses wise, and Diomedes forme, Are heare set downe, for valiant wightes to viewe: The one deuis'de, the other did performe, Whereby, they did the Troiane force subdue: The one, his foes with witte, and counsaile harm'de, The other, still him selfe againste them arm'de. Labor irritus. Heare, Ocnus still the roape doth turne and winde, Which he did make, of russhes and of grasse: And when with toile, his worke was to his minde He rol'de it vp, and lefte it to the asse: Whoe quickelie spoil'de, that longe with paine was sponne, Which being kept, it might some good haue donne. This Ocnus shewes, a man that workes and toiles, The Asse declares, a wicked wastfull wife: Whoe if shee maie, shee quicklie spendes and spoiles That he with care, was getting all his life, And likewise those, that lewdely doo bestowe Suche thinges, as shoulde vnto good vses goe.

In eum qui sibi ipsi damnum apparat. The rauening wolfe, by kinde my mortall foe, Yet lo, infors'de, I foster vp her whelpe: Who afterwarde, as it did stronger growe, Thoughe as my owne, I longe the same did helpe: Yet, coulde I not contente it with my teate, But that my selfe, hee rent to be his meate. No willinge minde, to please him might suffise, No diligence, to geue the tyraunte sucke, Though whelpishe daies, his nature did disguise, Yet time at lengthe vnto my euell lucke, Bewray'de his harte, a warninge good to those, Whoe in theire howse, doe foster vp theire foes. For, thoughe throughe neede they frendlie seeme a while, Or childishe yeares, do cloke their cancker'd minde, Althoughe some doe, releeue them in exile, And spend theire goodes, in hope to alter kinde: Yet all theire loue, and care to doe them good, Suche will forgett, and seeke to spill theire blood. Garrulitas. Betimé when sleepe is sweete, the chattringe swallowe cries, And doth awake the wearied wighte, before he would arise: Which carpes the pratinge crewe, whoe like of bablinge beste: Whose tounges doe make him almoste deafe, that faine would take his rest. Quære adolescens, vtere senex. VVhilst youthe doth laste, with liuelie sappe, and strengthe, With sweate of browe, see that for age thou toyle: And when the same, arresteth thee at lengthe, Then take thy rest, let younglinges worke, and moyle: And vse thy goodes, which thou in yowthe haste wonne, To cheare thy harte, whil'st that thy glasse shal ronne. Uitæ, aut morti. Within one flower, two contraries remaine, For proofe behoulde, the spider, and the bee, One poison suckes, the bee doth honie draine: The Scripture soe, hath two effectes we see: Vnto the bad, it is a sworde that slaies, Vnto the good, a shielde in ghostlie fraies. Nil penna, sed vsus. To. Pr. Dr. The Hippocrites, that make so great a showe, Of Sanctitie, and of Religion sounde, Are shaddowes meere, and with our substance goe, And beinge tri'de, are but dissemblers founde. Theise are compar'de, vnto the Ostriche faire, Whoe spreades her winges, yet sealdome tries the aire. Fortissima minimis interdum cedunt. The scarlet cloathe, dothe make the bull to feare. The culler white, the Olephant dothe shunne. The crowinge cocke, the Lion quakes to heare. The smoke of cloathe, dothe make the stagge to runne. All which doe showe, wee no man shoulde dispise, But thinke howe harme, the simplest maie deuise. Iniuriis, infirmitas subiecta. The mightie fishe, deuowres the little frie, If in the deepe, they venture for to staie, If vp they swimme, newe foes with watchinge flie, The caruoraunte, and Seamewe, for theire praie: Betweene these two, the frie is still destroi'de, Ah feeble state, on euerie side anoi'de.

Luxuriosorum opes. On craggie rockes, and haughtie mountaines toppe, Vntimelie fruicte, one sower figtree growes: Whereof, no good mankinde at all doth croppe, But serues alone, the rauens, and the crowes: So fooles, theire goodes vnto no goodnes vse, But flatterers feede, or waste them on the stewes. Agentes, &amp; consentientes, pari pœna puniendi. A Trompetter, the Captaines captiue leade, Whoe pardon crau'de, and saide, he did no harme: And for his life, with tremblinge longe did pleade, Whereat, quoth they, and hal'de him by the arme: Althoughe, thie hande did neuer strike a stroke, Yet with thie winde, thou others did'st prouoke. Jn quatuor anni tempora. By swallowes note, the Springe wee vnderstande, The Cuckowe comes, ere Sommer doth beginne: The vinefinche showes, that haruest is at hande: The Chaffinche singes, when winter commeth in: Which times they keepe, that man therebie maie knowe, Howe Seasons chaunge, and tymes do come and goe. Paruam culinam, duobus ganeonibus non sufficere. In smalle, and little thinges, there is no gaine at all, One groaue, maie not two redbreastes serue, but euermore they brall. Cuncta complecti velle, stultum. ET TVTTO ABBRACCIO ETNVLLA STRINGO. The little boyes, that striue with all theire mighte, To catche the belles, or bubbles, as they fall: In vaine they seeke, for why, they vanishe righte, Yet still they striue, and are deluded all: So, they that like all artes, that can bee thoughte, Doe comprehende not anie, as they oughte. Alius peccat, alius plectitur. The angrie dogge doth turne vnto the stone, When it is caste, and bytes the same for ire, And not pursues, the same that hathe it throwne, But with the same, fulfilleth his desire: Euen so, theyr are that doe bothe fighte, and brall, With guiltlesse men, when wrathe dothe them inflame, And mortall foes, they deale not with at all, But let them passe, to theire rebuke, and shame: And in a rage, on innocentes do ronne, And turne from them, that all the wronge haue donne.

Pythagoras, vnto his schollers gaue, This lesson firste, that silence they should keepe: And this, wee reade Philosophers moste graue, Yea in theire hartes, this Princes printed deepe: Vlisses wordes weare spare, but rightlie plac'd: This, Nestor lik'de. Lycvrgvs this imbrac'de. This, famous made Epaminondas boulde: By this, great praise did Demaratvs gaine: This, Athens made to reuerence Zeno oulde: Simonides condemned speaches vaine, Whose sayinge was, my wordes repentance had, But Silence yet, did neuer make mee sad. And Cato sayeth: That man is next to God, Whoe squares his speache, in reasons rightfull frame: For idle wordes, God threatneth with his rodde, And sayeth, wee must giue reckoninge for the same: Sainct Pavle likewise, this faulte doth sharplie tutche, And oftentimes, condemneth bablinge mutche. One calles the tounge, the gate of life, and deathe, Which wiselie vs'd, extolleth men on earthe: Which lewdlie vs'de, depriueth men of breathe, And makes them mourne, whoe might haue liu'de in mirthe: For euell wordes, pierce sharper then a sworde, Which ofte wee rue, thoughe they weare spoke in boorde. Not that distroyes, into the mowthe that goes, But that distroyes, that forthe thereof doth comme: For wordes doe wounde, the inwarde man with woes, Then wiselie speake, or better to bee domme The tounge, althowghe it bee a member small, Of man it is the best, or worste of all. The foole, is thought with silence to be wise, But when he prates, him selfe he dothe bewraye: And wise men still, the babler doe dispise, Then keepe a watche when thou haste owght to saie, What labour lesse, then for to houlde thy peace, Which aged daies, with quiet doth increase. Th' Ægyptians wise, and other nations farre, Vnto this ende, Harpocrates deuis'de, Whose finger, still did seeme his mouthe to barre, To bid them speake, no more then that suffis'de, Which signe thoughe oulde, wee may not yet detest, But marke it well, if wee will liue in reste.

For if that Iove shoulde shoote, so ofte as men offende, The Poëttes saie, his thunderboltes shoulde soone bee at an ende. Then happie wee that haue, a Princesse so inclin'de. That when as iustice drawes hir sworde, hath mercie in her minde, And to declare the same, howe prone shee is to saue: Her Maiestie did make her choice, this Poësie for to haue.

A withered Elme, whose boughes weare bare of leaues And sappe, was sunke with age into the roote: A fruictefull vine, vnto her bodie cleaues, Whose grapes did hange, from toppe vnto the foote: And when the Elme, was rotten, drie, and dead, His braunches still, the vine abowt it spread. Which showes, wee shoulde be linck'de with such a frende, That might reuiue, and helpe when wee bee oulde: And when wee stoope, and drawe vnto our ende, Our staggering state, to helpe for to vphoulde: Yea, when wee shall be like a sencelesse block, That for our sakes, will still imbrace our stock.

The Lions grimme, behoulde, doe not resiste, But yealde them selues, and Cupiddes chariot drawe, And with one hande, he guydes them where he liste, With th' other hande, he keepes them still in awe: Theye couche, and drawe, and do the whippe abide, And laie theire fierce and crewell mindes aside. If Cupid then, bee of such mightie force, That creatures fierce, and brutishe kinde he tames: Oh mightie Iove, vouchsafe to showe remorse, Helpe feeble man, and pittie tender dames: Let Africke wilde, this tyrauntes force indure, If not alas, howe can poore man bee sure.

Not for our selues, alone wee are create, But for our frendes, and for our countries good: And those, that are vnto theire frendes ingrate, And not regarde theire ofspringe, and theire blood, Or hee, that wastes his substance till he begges, Or selles his landes, whiche seru'de his parentes well: Is like the henne, when shee hathe lay'de her egges, That suckes them vp and leaues the emptie shell, Euen so theire spoile, to theire reproche, and shame, Vndoeth theire heire, and quite decayeth theire name.

Sen. Hipp. 1. Mutuum auxilium. To R. Cotton Esquier. The blynde, did beare the lame vppon his backe, The burthen, did directe the bearors waies: With mutuall helpe, they seru'd eche others lacke, And euery one, their frendly league did praise: The lame lente eies, the blynde did lend his feete, And so they safe, did passe both feelde, and streete. Some lande aboundes, yet hathe the same her wante, Some yeeldes her lacke, and wantes the others store: No man so ritche, but is in some thinge scante, The greate estate, must not dispise the pore: Hee workes, and toyles, and makes his showlders beare, The ritche agayne, giues foode, and clothes, to weare. So without poore, the ritche are like the lame: And without ritche, the poore are like the blynde: Let ritche lend eies, the poore his legges wil frame, Thus shoulde yt bee. For so the Lorde assign'd, Whoe at the firste, for mutuall frendship sake, Not all gaue one, but did this difference make. Whereby, with trade, and intercourse, in space, And borrowinge heare, and lendinge there agayne: Such loue, such truthe, such kyndnes, shoulde take place, That frendshipp, with societie should raigne: The prouerbe saieth, one man is deemed none, And life, is deathe, where men doo liue alone. Non est diues opum, diues: nec pauper inops? Infelix: alio nec magis alter eget. Diues eget gemmit; Cereali munere pauper. Sed cùm egcant ambo, pauper egens minus est. Ausonius in Epig.

When Sanabal Hierusalem distrest, With sharpe assaultes, in Nehemias tyme: To warre, and worke, the Iewes them selues addrest, And did repaire theire walles, with stone, and lime: One hande the sworde, against the foe did shake, The other hande, the trowell vp did take. Of valiant mindes, loe here, a worthie parte, That quailed not, with ruine of theire wall: But Captaines boulde, did prooue the masons arte, Which doth inferre, this lesson vnto all: That to defende, our countrie deare from harme, For warre, or worke, wee eyther hande should arme. Murus æneus, sana conscientia. To Miles Hobart Esquier. Bothe freshe, and greene, the Laurell standeth sounde, Thoughe lightninges flasshe, and thunderboltes do flie: Where, other trees are blasted to the grounde, Yet, not one leafe of it, is withered drie: Euen so, the man that hathe a conscience cleare, When wicked men, doe quake at euerie blaste, Doth constant stande, and dothe no perrilles feare, When tempestes rage, doe make the worlde agaste: Suche men are like vnto the Laurell tree, The others, like the blasted boughes that die. Integer vitæ, sceleris? purus Non eget Maurî iaculis nec arcu, Nec venenatis grauida sagittis, Fusce pharetra.

In fruictefull feilde amid the goodlie croppe, The hurtfull tares, and dernell ofte doe growe, And many times, doe mounte aboue the toppe Of highest corne: But skilfull man doth knowe, When graine is ripe, with siue to purge the seedes, From chaffe, and duste, and all the other weedes. By which is ment, sith wicked men abounde, That harde it is, the good from bad to trie: The prudent sorte, shoulde haue suche iudgement sounde, That still the good they shoulde from bad descrie: And siste the good, and to discerne their deedes, And weye the bad, noe better then the weedes. Interiora vide. To George Brooke Esquier. Though outwarde thinges, doe trimme, &amp; braue, appeare, And sightes at firste, doe aunswere thie desire, Yet, inwarde partes, if that they shine not cleare, Suspecte the same, and backe in time retire: For inwardlie, such deadlie foes maie lurke, As when wee trust, maie our destruction worke. Though bewtie rare, bee farre and neare renoumde, Though Natures giftes, and fortunes doe excell: Yet, if the minde, with heinous crimes abounde, And nothing good with in the same doe dwell: Regarde it not, but shonne the outward showe, Vntill, thou doe the inwarde vertues knowe. Virtus omnia in se habet, omnia adsunt bona, quem Pene'st virtus, Plaut. in Amph. Fortuna virtutem superans. To Fr. W. Esquier. When Brvtvs knewe, Avgvstvs parte preuail'de, And sawe his frendes, lie bleedinge on the grounde, Suche deadlie griefe, his noble harte assail'de, That with his sworde, hee did him selfe confounde: But firste, his frendes perswaded him to flee, Whoe aunswer'd thus, my flighte with handes shalbee. And bending then to blade, his bared breste, Hee did pronounce, theise wordes with courage great: Oh Prowes vaine, I longe did loue thee beste, But nowe, I see, thou doest on fortune waite. Wherefore with paine, I nowe doe prooue it true, That fortunes force, maie valiant hartes subdue. Fides non apparentium. To Barthram Calthorpe Esquier. The fissherman, doth caste his nettes in sea, In hope at lengthe, an happie hale to haue, And is content, longe time to pause, and staie, Thoughe, nothinge elles hee see, besides the waue: Yet, onelie trust for thinges vnseene dothe serue, Which feedes him ofte, till he doth almoste sterue. If fisshermen, haue then suche constant hope, For hidden thinges, and such as doe decaie, Let Christians then, the eies of faithe houlde ope, And thinke not longe, for that which lastes for aie, And on Gods worde, theire hope to anchor faste, Whereof eache iote, shalbee fulfil'de at laste.

The surging Sea, doth salte, and sweete remaine, And is preserude with working, to and froe: And not corruptes, nor suffreth anie staine, Whiles in his boundes, the same doth ebbe, and flowe: But if it waste, and forth by sluses fall, It soone corruptes, and hath no force at all. The arrowes sharpe, that in one sheafe are bounde, Are harde to breake, while they are ioined sure, But seuer them, then feeble are they founde, So where as loue, and concorde, doth indure: A little force, doth mightilie preuaile, Where Princes powers, with hate and discorde quaile. Gratiam referendam. See heare the storke prouides with tender care, And bringeth meate, vnto her hatched broode: They like againe, for her they doe prepare, When shee is oulde, and can not get her foode: Which teacheth bothe, the parente and the childe, Theire duties heare, which eche to other owe: First, fathers must be prouident, and milde, Vnto theire fruicte, till they of age doe growe: And children, muste with dutie still proceede, To reuerence them, and helpe them if they neede.

The couetons man, this fable reprehendes, For chaunge his name, and Tantalvs hee is, Hee dothe abounde, yet sterues and nothing spendes, But keepes his goulde, as if it weare not his: With slender fare, he doth his hunger feede, And dare not touche his store, when hee doth neede.

For, when that griefe doth grate vppon our gall, Or surging seas, of sorrowes moste doe swell, That life is deathe, and is no life at all, The liuer rente, it dothe the conscience tell: Which being launch'de, and prick'd, with inward care, Although wee liue, yet still wee dyinge are.

Let mortall men, that are but earthe, and duste, Not looke to highe, with puffe of wordlie pride: But sometime, viewe the place wheretoo they muste, And not delighte, the poorest to deride: Leste when theire mindes, do mounte vnto the skies, Their fall is wrought, by thinges they doe dispise. Some others are, that fitlie this applie, To those, whoe doe Astronomie professe: Whoe leaue the earthe, and studie on the skie, As if they coulde, all worldlie thinges expresse: Yet, when to knowe the starres they take in hande, Of daungers neare, they doe not vnderstande.

Not euerie one, mighte to Corinthus goe, The meaninge was, not all mighte Lais loue: The manchet fine, on highe estates bestowe, The courser cheate, the baser sorte must prooue: Faire Helen leaue for Menelavs grace, And Coridon, let Mablie still imbrace. And thoughe, the poore maie not presume alofte, It is no cause, they therefore shoulde dispaire: For with his choise, doth Irvs ioye as ofte, As dothe the Prince, that hathe a Venvs faire: No highe estate, can giue a quiet life, But God it is, that blesseth man, and wife. Then make thy choise, amongste thy equalles still, If thou mislike Dianas steppes to trace: Thoughe Paris, had his Helen at his will, Thinke howe his facte, was Ilions foule deface. And hee, that moste the house of Lais hauntes, The more he lookes, the more her face enchauntes. Præpostera fides. Anellvs, sendes his corne vnto the mill, Which beinge grounde, he tri'de it by the waighte: And finding not the measure, to his will, Hee studied longe, to learne, the millers sleighte: For noe complaintes, coulde make him leaue to steale, Or fill the sacke, with fustie mixed meale. Wherefore, to mill he sente his dearest wife, That nighte, and daie, shee mighte the grindinge viewe: Where shee, (kinde harte,) to ende al former strife, Did dubbe her Spouse, one of Vvlcanvs crewe: Oh greedie foole Anellus, of thy graine, And of thy wife, too prodigall, and plaine. Fatuis leuia commitito. The little childe, is pleas'de with cockhorse gaie, Althoughe he aske a courser of the beste: The ideot likes, with bables for to plaie, And is disgrac'de, when he is brauelie dreste: A motley coate, a cockescombe, or a bell, Hee better likes, then Iewelles that excell. So fondelinges vaine, that doe for honor sue, And seeke for roomes, that worthie men deserue: The prudent Prince, dothe giue hem ofte their due, Whiche is faire wordes, that right their humors serue: For infantes hande, the rasor is vnfitte, And fooles vnmeete, in wisedomes seate to sitte. Homines voluptatibus transformantur. See here Vlisses men, transformed straunge to heare: Some had the shape of Goates, and Hogges, some Apes, and Asses weare. Who, when they might haue had their former shape againe, They did refuse, and rather wish'd, still brutishe to remaine. Which showes those foolishe sorte, whome wicked loue dothe thrall, Like brutishe beastes do passe theire time, and haue no sence at all. And thoughe that wisedome woulde, they shoulde againe retire, Yet, they had rather Circes serue, and burne in theire desire. Then, loue the onelie crosse, that clogges the worlde with care, Oh stoppe your eares, and shutte your eies, of Circes cuppes beware.

Epist. 2. Iudicium Paridis. To Paris, here the Goddesses doe pleade: With kingdomes large, did Ivno make her sute, And Pallas nexte, with wisedome him assaide, But Venvs faire, did winne the goulden fruite. No princelie giftes, nor wisedome he did wey, For Bewtie, did comaunde him to obey. The worldlie man, whose sighte is alwaies dimme, Whose fancie fonde eache pleasure doth entice, The shaddowes, are like substance vnto him, And toyes more deare, them thinges of greatest price: But yet the wise this iudgement rashe deride, And sentence giue on prudent Pallas side.

Heare Hanno standes, and lookes into the skye, And feedes him selfe, with hope of future praise: Vnto his birdes, he dothe his eare applie, And trustes in tyme, that they his name should raise: For they weare taughte, before they flewe abrode, Longe tyme to saie, that Hanno was a God. But, when the birdes from bondage weare releast, And in the woodes, with other birdes weare ioin'de, Then Hannos name, theire woonted lesson ceaste, For eache did singe, accordinge to his kinde: Then flee this faulte, Ambition workes our shame, And vertue loue, which dothe extoll our name. Desidiam abiiciendam. Vse labour still, and leaue thie slouthfull seate, Flee Idlenesse, which beggers state dothe giue: With sweate of browe, see that thou get thy meate, If thou be borne, with labouring hande to liue: And get, to eate. and eate, to liue with praise: Liue not to eate, to liue with wanton ease. By Dracoes lawes, the idle men shoulde die, The Florentines, made banishement theire paine: In Corinthe, those that idlie they did see, Weare warn'de at firste, the seconde time were slaine: And eke Sainct Paule, the slothfull thus doth threate, Whoe laboreth not, denie him for to eate.

The Princes greate, and Monarches of the earthe, Whoe, while they liu'de, the worlde might not suffice: Yet can they claime, by greatnesse of their birthe, To beare from hence, when nature life denies, Noe more then they, who for releife did pyne, Which is but this, a shrouding sheete of twyne. Thoughe fewe there bee, while they doe flourishe heere, That doe regarde the place whereto the muste: Yet, thoughe theire pride like Lucifers appeere, They shalbee sure at lengthe to turne to duste: The Prince, the Poore, the Prisoner, and the slaue, They all at lengthe, are summon'de to their graue. But, hee that printes this deepelie in his minde, Althoughe he set in mightie Cæsars chaire, Within this life, shall contentation finde, When carelesse men, ofte die in great dispaire: Then, let them blusshe that woulde be Christians thought, And faile hereof, Sith Turkes the same haue taught.

Bothe houses faire, and citties great, they viewe, But Riuers swifte, theire passage still do let, They ofte looke backe, and doe theire fortune rue, Since that therin, they haue no seate to set: Thus, passe they throughe theire longe vnquiet life, Till deathe dothe come, the ende of worldlie strife.

They longe did striue, who shoulde the firste demaunde: The Couetous man refus'de, bicause his mate, Shoulde haue his gifte then doubled out of hande: The thought whereof, vppon his harte did grate Wherefore the Goddes, did plague him for his sinne, And did commaunde, th' Enuious man beginne.

Yet manie are, who not the cause regarde, The birthe, the yeares, nor vertues of the minde: For goulde is first, with greedie men prefer'de, And loue is laste, and likinge set behinde: But parentes harde, that matches make for goodes: Can not be free, from guilte of childrens bloodes.

No where hee stay'de, but musique sweete did sounde; No where hee went, but hee did odors smell; Nowe in his pompe, when all thinges did abounde, Being ask'd, if that this life did please him well: Hee aunswere made, it was the heauen alone, And that to it, all other liues weare none. Then, did the king comaunde a naked sworde, Vnto the roofe, shoulde with a heare bee knit: That right shoulde hange, when hee was plac'd at bourde, Aboue his head, where he did vse to sit: Which when hee sawe, as one distracte with care, Hee had no ioye in mirthe, nor daintie fare. But did beseech, the Tyraunt for to giue, His former state, and take his pompe againe: By which, wee learne, that those who meanely liue, Haue ofte more ioye, them those who rule and raigne: But cheifelye, if like him they doe appeare, Who night, and daye, of subiectes stoode in feare.

THE SECOND PARTE OF EMBLEMES, AND OTHER DEVISES, gathered, Englished, and moralized, And diuerse newlie deuised, by Geffrey Whitney. IN PRAISE, OF THE TWO NOBLE EARLES, Warwicke, And Leycester. Two Beares there are, the greater, and the lesse, Well knowne to those that trauaile farre, and neare: Without whose sighte, the shipman sailes by gesse, If that the Sonne, or Moone, doe not appeare. They both doe showe, to th' Equinoctiall line, And one, vnto th' Antipodes doth shine. These, haue their lighte from Phoebvs goulden raies, And all the worlde, by them receyueth good: Without whose helpe, no man mighte passe the seas, But euer stande in daunger of the flood; Oh blessed lightes, the worke of heauenly hande, You, millions saue from ruthe of rocke, and sande. Two noble peeres, who both doe giue the beare, Two famous Earles, whose praises pierce the skye: Who both are plac'd in honours sacred cheare, Whose worthie fame shall liue, and neuer dye: In Englishe courte doe spende their blessed daies: Of publique weale, two greate, and mightie staies. And as those starres by Phoebvs lighte are seene, So, both these Earles haue honour, mighte, and power: From Phoebe brighte, our moste renowmed Queene, Whose fame, no time, nor enuie can deuower: And vnder her, they showe to others lighte, And doe reioyce tenne thousand with their sighte. But, since that all that haue bin borne, haue ende, And nothinge can with natures lawes dispence: Vowch safe oh Lorde, longe time their liues to lende, Before thou call these noble persons hence: Whose fame, while that the Beares in skie shall showe, Within this lande, all future times shall knowe. In praise of the Righte Honorable my good Lorde, and Maister, the Earle of Leycester. Hee that desires to passe the surging Seas, Bycause they are so wonderfull to see, And without skill, doth venture wheare hee please, While that the waues both caulme, and quiet bee, Weare better farre, to keepe him on the lande, Then for to take such enterprise in hande. For, if hee lacke his compasse, and his carde, And arte therfore, to shape his course arighte: Or pylottes good, that daungers may regarde, When surge doth swell, and windes doe showe their mighte, Doth perrill life, throughe wanton wreckles will, And doth to late lamente his lacke of skill. So, hee that shoulde with will, bee stirr'd to wryte, Your noble actes, your giftes and vertues rare: If Pallas ayde hee lacke, for to indite, Hee should but haste his follie to declare. And wronge your righte, deseruinge Vergils penne; And Homers skill, if they weare here agayne. Then, best for such to take a longer pause, Then to attempte a thinge so farre vnfitte: For, they may knowe to write of such a cause, Beseemeth best, the fine, and rarest witte. Yet those that woulde, I wishe their learninge sutche, That as they shoulde, they mighte your vertues tutche. An other of the same. Since fame is wighte of winge, and throughe eche clymate flies, And woorthy actes of noble peeres, doth raise vnto the skies. And since shee hathe extoll'd your praises longe agoe, That other countries farre, and neare, your noble name doe knowe. Althoughe I houlde my peace, throughe wante of learned skill, Yet shall your passinge fame bee knowne, and bee renowmed still. And those that haue desire, vppon your praise to looke, May finde it truly pen'd by fame, within her goulden booke. Where, on the formost fronte of honours hautie stage, Shee placeth you, in equall roome, with anie of your age. Wherfore to fame I yeeld, and cease what I begonne: Bicause, it is in vaine, to set a candell in the Sonne. Respice, &amp; prospice. The former parte, nowe paste, of this my booke, The seconde parte in order doth insue: Which, I beginne with Ianvs double looke, That as hee sees, the yeares both oulde, and newe, So, with regarde, I may these partes behoulde, Perusinge ofte, the newe, and eeke the oulde. And if, that faulte within vs doe appeare, Within the yeare, that is alreadie donne, As Ianvs biddes vs alter with the yeare, And make amendes, within the yeare begonne, Euen so, my selfe suruayghinge what is past; With greater heede, may take in hande the laste. This Image had his rites, and temple faire, And call'd the God of warre, and peace, bicause In warres, hee warn'de of peace not to dispaire: And warn'de in peace, to practise martiall lawes: And furthermore, his lookes did teache this somme; To beare in minde, time past, and time to comme. To the honorable Sir Philippe Sidney Knight, Gouuernour of the Garrison, and towne of Vlissinge. Since best deserte, for valour of the minde, And prowes great, the Romanes did deserue; And sithe, the worlde might not their matches finde, In former times, as aucthors yet reserue: A fewe of them I meane for to recite, That valiaunt mindes maye haue therein delighte. And but to tutche the naked names of some, As Romulus, that first the wall did laye: And so, from thence to nearer times to come, To Curtius boulde, that did the gulfe assaye: Or Cocles eeke, who did his foes withstande, Till bridge was broke, and armed swamme to lande. Then Posthumus, I might with these repeate, That did repulse the Latines, from the waules. And Manlius, a man of courage greate, Who did defende the Capitoll from Gaules: And Fabius name, of whome this dothe remaine, Three hundreth sixe, weare in one battaile slaine. With these, by righte comes Coriolanus in, Whose cruell minde did make his countrie smarte; Till mothers teares, and wiues, did pittie winne: Fabricius then, whome bribes coulde not peruerte. And Decij eeke; and Iunij voide of dreede With Curij; and Metelli, doe succeede. Dentatus nexte, that sixe score battailes foughte, Who, Romanes call'de Achilles, for his force: Vnto his graue no wounde behinde hee broughte, But fortie fiue before, did carue his corse. Torquatus eeke, his foe that ouercame, And tooke his chaine; whereby he had his name. With Claudius blinde, and Claudius Caudax nam'de, Two brothers boulde, for valour great renoum'de: And Calatine, that all Sicilia tam'de, And one the Sea, Hamilcar did confounde: Luctatius eeke, that Carthage fleete subdu'de, Whereby, for peace they with submission su'de. And Fabius greate, and Marc Marcellus boulde, That at the lengthe did Syracvsa sacke: And eeke the actes of Portius wee behoulde, Whose life thoughe longe, yet Rome to soone did lacke: Duillius yet, and Liuius wee doe knowe, Thoughe they weare turn'd to poulder longe agoe. What shoulde I speake of Claudius Neros harte, When Hanibal, did royall Rome dismaye: And Hasdrvbal did hast to take his parte, But Claudius, lo, did meete him by the waye, And reau'd his life, and put his hoste to flighte, And threwe his head to Hanibal his sighte. Then Scipio greate, that Carthage waules did race. A noble prince, the seconde vnto none: Flaminius then, and Fuluius haue their place; Æmilius actes, and Gracchus, yet are knowne: With Sylla fierce, and Caius Marius stoute, Whose ciuill warres, made Rome tenne yeares in doubte. Sertorius, nexte, and eeke Gabinius name, With Crassus, and Lucullus, highe renoum'de: And Cæsar great, that prince of endelesse fame, Whose actes, all landes, while worlde dothe laste, shall sounde. Augustus great, that happie most did raigne, The scourge to them, that had his vnkle slaine. Anthonius then, that fortune longe did frende, Yet at the lengthe, the most vnhappie man: And Lepidus, forsaken in the ende, With Brutus boulde, and Cassius, pale and wan: With manie more, whome aucthors doe reporte, Whereof, ensue some tutch'd in larger sorte. Mutius Scæuola. Pietas in patriam. This hande, and sworde, within the furious flame, Doth shewe his harte, that sought Porsennas ende: Whose countries good, and ecke perpetuall fame, Before his life did Scævola commende: No paine, had power his courage highe to quaile, But bouldlie spake, when fire did him assaile. Which sighte, abash'd the lookers on, but moste Amaz'de the kinge; who pardoned straighte the knight: And ceas'd the siege, and did remooue his hoste, When that hee sawe one man so muche of mighte: Oh noble minde, althoughe thy daies bee paste; Thy fame doth liue, and eeke, for aye shall laste. Habet &amp; bellum suas leges. Camillvs then, that did repulse the Gaules, And vnto Rome her former state did giue: When that her foes made spoile within her waules, Lo here, amongst his actes that still shall liue. I made my choice, of this example rare, That shall for aye his noble minde declare. Wherefore, in briefe then this his woorthie parte, What time he did besiege Faleria stronge: A scoolemaster, that bare a Ivdas harte, Vnto the place where he was fostred longe, Ofte walk'd abrode with schollers that hee toughte, Whiche cloke hee vs'de, so that no harme was thoughte. At lengthe, with sonnes of all the best, and moste, Of noble peares, that kepte the towne by mighte: Hee made his walke into the Romane hoste, And, when hee came before Camillvs sighte, Quoth hee, my Lorde, lo these? thy prisoners bee, Which beinge kepte, Faleria yeeldes to thee. Whereat, a while this noble captaine stay'd, And pondering well the straungenes of the cause: Vnto his frendes, this in effecte hee say'd. Thoughe warres bee ill, yet good mens warres haue lawes, And it behooues a Generall good to gaine, With valiaunt actes, and not with treacherous traine. With that, hee caus'de this Sinon to bee stripte, And whippes, and roddes, vnto the schollers gaue: Whome, backe againe, into the toune they whipte, Which facte, once knowne vnto their fathers graue: With ioyfull hartes, they yeelded vp their Toune: An acte moste rare, and glasse of true renoume. M. Ualerius Coruinus. Insperatum auxilium. If Livies pen haue written but the truthe, And diuerse mo, that actes of ould declare. Then knowe, when Gaules did dare the Roman youthe, Valerivs, lo, a Roman did prepare By dinte of sword, the challenger to trye, Who both in armes incountred by and by. And whilst with force, they proou'd their weapons brighte, And made the sparkes to flie out of the steele, A Rauen, straight, vppon Valerivs lighte, And made his foe a newe incounter feele: Whome hee so sore did damage, and distresse, That at the lengthe, the Roman had successe. For, when his foe his forces at him bente, With winges all spread the rauen dim'd his sighte: At lengthe, his face hee scratch'd, and all to rente, And peck'd his eies, hee coulde not see the lighte, Which shewes, the Lorde in daunger doth preserue, And rauens raise our wordlie wantes to serue. Regulus Attilius. Hosts etiam seruanda fides. The Consull boulde Attilivs, here regarde, That Africke made to tremble at his name; Who, for his faithe receyued this rewarde, Two hundreth thousande men, hee ouercame. And three score shippes, and eeke two hundreth townes, Yet flattringe fate, in fine vppon him frownes. For, after by Xantippvs ouerthrowne, To Carthage broughte, in dungeon deepe was caste; Yet, with desire for to redeeme their owne, Their messenger they made him, at the laste: And in exchaunge, hee vnto Rome was sente, For prisoners there, and on his worde he wente. Who promis'd this, hee woulde retourne to bandes, If that hee fail'd of that, they did require: But when hee sawe so manie in their handes, Thoughe Romanes glad, did graunt him his desire: Yet coulde hee not theretoo, in harte agree, Bycause for him, so manie shoulde bee free. Thus, countries loue, was dearer then his life, Who backe retourn'de, to keepe his promise true: Where hee did taste longe time of tormentes rise, But yet, his harte no tortures coulde subdue. His mangled eies, the Sonne all daye assailes; And in the ende, was thruste in tonne with nailes. Marcus Sergius. Fortiter &amp; feliciter. Marc Sergivs nowe, I maye recorde by righte, A Romane boulde, whome foes coulde not dismaye: Gainste Hannibal hee often shewde his mighte, Whose righte hande loste, his lefte hee did assaye Vntill at lengthe an iron hande hee proou'd: And after that Cremona siege remoou'd. Then, did defende Placentia in distresse, And wanne twelue houldes, by dinte of sworde in France, What triumphes great? were made for his successe, Vnto what state did fortune him aduance? What speares? what crounes? what garlandes hee possest; The honours due for them, that did the beste. Cn. Pompeius Magnus. Celsa potestatis species. When Pompey great, with fortune longe was bleste, And did subdue his foes, by lande, and sea, And conquestes great obtained in the Easte, And Parthians, and Arabians, made obaye, And seas, and Iles, did in subiection bringe, Whose name with feare, did throughe Ivdæa ringe. And had restor'de kinge Masinissas righte, And ouercame Sertorivs with his power: And made the Kinge of Pontvs knowe his mighte. Yet, at the lengthe, hee had his haplesse hower: For ouercome by Cæsar, fled for aide, To Ægypte lande; wherein hee was betrai'd. Within whose ringe, this forme aboue was wroughte, Whereby, his force, and noble minde appeares; Which, with his head to Cæsar being broughte, For inwarde griefe, hee wash'd the same with teares, And in a fire with odours, and perfumes: This princes head with mourning hee consumes. Marcus Scæua. Audaces fortuna iuuat. This monumente of manhoode, yet remaines, A witnes true, of Marcvs Scævas harte: Whose valliancie, did purchase him such gaines, That deathe, nor time, can blemishe his deserte. In battaile, boulde: no feare his harte coulde wounde, When sixe-score shaftes within his shielde weare founde, And in that fighte, one of his eies hee loste, His thighe thrust throughe, and wounded sore beside: Such souldiours, had greate Cæsar in his hoste, As by him selfe, and others, is discride. But, those that would more of these Knightes behoulde, Let them peruse the Roman Aucthours oulde. Inuidia integritatis assecla. The gallant Palme with bodie straighte, and tall, That freshelie showes, with braunches sweete of smell: Yet, at the foote the frogges, and septentes crall, With ercksome noise, and eke with poison fell: Who, as it weare, the tree doe still annoye, And do their worste, the same for to destroye. When noble peeres, and men of highe estate, By iuste deserte, doe liue in honor greate: Yet, Enuie still dothe waite on them as mate, And dothe her worste, to vndermine their seate: And Momvs broode dothe arme, with all their mighte, To wounde their fame, whose life did geue them lighte. Ex damno alterius, alterius vtilitas. The Lion fierce, and sauage bore contende, The one, his pawes: his tuskes the other tries: And ere the broile, with bloodie blowes had ende, A vulture loe, attendes with watchinge eies: And of their spoile, doth hope to præie his fill, And ioyes, when they eche others blood doe spill. When men of mighte, with deadlie rancor swell, And mortall hate, twixte mightie Monarches raignes; Some gripes doe watche, that like the matter well, And of their losse, doe raise their priuate gaines: So, Soliman his Empire did increase, When christian kinges exiled loue, and peace. Hic magnus sedet Æneas secum? volutat Euentus belli varios, &amp;c. Virg. Aeneid. 10. Et pendebat adhuc belli fortuna, diu? Inter vtrumque volat dubiis victoria pennis. Ouid. Metam. 7. Vigilantia, &amp; custodia. Ad reuerendiss. Dn. D. Gvlielmvm Chattertonvm Episcopum Cestrensem. The Heraulte, that proclaimes the daie at hande, The Cocke I meane, that wakes vs out of sleepe, On steeple highe, doth like a watchman stande: The gate beneath, a Lion still doth keepe. And why? theise two, did alder time decree, That at the Churche, theire places still should bee. That pastors, shoulde like watchman still be preste, To wake the worlde, that sleepeth in his sinne, And rouse them vp, that longe are rock'd in reste, And shewe the daie of Christe, will straighte beginne: And to foretell, and preache, that light deuine, Euen as the Cocke doth singe, ere daie doth shine. The Lion shewes, they shoulde of courage bee, And able to defende, their flocke from foes: If rauening wolfes, to lie in waite they see: They shoulde be stronge, and boulde, with them to close: And so be arm'de with learning, and with life, As they might keepe, their charge, from either strife. Festina lentè Ad Amplissimos viros Dn. Franciscvm Windham, &amp; Dn. Edwardvm Flowerdewe Iudices integerrimos. This figure, lo, Avgvstvs did deuise, A mirror good, for Iudges iuste to see, And alwayes fitte, to bee before their eies, When sentence they, of life, and deathe decree: Then muste they haste, but verie slowe awaie, Like butterflie, whome creepinge crabbe dothe staie. The Prince, or Iudge, maie not with lighte reporte, In doubtfull thinges, giue iudgement touching life: But trie, and learne the truthe in euerie sorte, And mercie ioyne, with iustice bloodie knife: This pleased well Avgvstvs noble grace, And Iudges all, within this tracke shoulde trace.

Ad eosdem Iudices. When Fire, and Aire, and Earthe, and Water, all weare one: Before that worke deuine was wroughte, which nowe wee looke vppon. There was no forme of thinges, but a confused masse: A lumpe, which Chaos men did call: wherin no order was, The Coulde, and Heate, did striue: the Heauie thinges, and Lighte. The Harde, and Softe. the Wette, and Drye. for none had shape arighte. But when they weare dispos'd, eache one into his roome: The Fire, had Heate: the Aire, had Lighte: the Earthe, with fruites did bloome. The Sea, had his increase: which thinges, to passe thus broughte: Behoulde, of this vnperfecte masse, the goodly worlde was wroughte. Then all thinges did abounde, that seru'd the vse of man: The Riuers greate, with wyne, and oyle, and milke, and honie, ranne. The Trees did yeeld their fruite: thoughe planting then vnknowne. And Ceres still was in her pompe, thoughe seede weare neuer sowne. The season, Sommer was: the Groues weare alwayes greene. And euery banke, did beare the badge, of fragrant Flora Queene. This was the goulden worlde, that Poëttes praised moste, No hate, was harbor'd then at home: nor hatch'd, in forren coste. But after, when the earthe, with people did increase: Ambition, straighte began to springe: and pryde, did banishe peace. For, as all tymes doe change: euen so, this age did passe. Then did the siluer age insue. and then, the age of brasse. The Iron age was laste, a fearefull cursed tyme: Then, armies came of mischiefes in: and fil'd the worlde with cryme. Then rigor, and reuenge, did springe in euell hower: And men of mighte, did manadge all, and poore opprest with power. And hee, that mightie was, his worde, did stand for lawe: And what the poore did ploughe, and sowe: the ritch away did drawe. None mighte their wiues inioye, their daughters, or their goodes, No, not their liues: such tyraunts broode, did seeke to spill their bloodes. Then vertues weare defac'd, and dim'd with vices vile, Then wronge, did maske in cloke of righte: then bad, did good exile. Then falshood, shadowed truthe: and hate, laugh'd loue to skorne: Then pitie, and compassion died: and bloodshed fowle was borne. So that no vertues then, their proper shapes did beare: Nor coulde from vices bee decern'd, so straunge they mixed weare. That nowe, into the worlde, an other Chaos came: But God, that of the former heape: the heauen and earthe did frame. And all thinges plac'd therein, his glorye to declare: Sente Ivstice downe vnto the earthe: such loue to man hee bare. Who, so suruay'd the world, with such an heauenly vewe: That quickley vertues shee aduanc'd: and vices did subdue. And, of that worlde did make, a paradice, of blisse: By which wee doo inferre: That where this sacred Goddes is. That land doth florishe still, and gladnes, their doth growe: Bicause that all, to God, and Prince, by her their dewties knowe. And where her presence wantes, there ruine raignes, and wracke: And kingdomes can not longe indure, that doe this ladie lacke. Then happie England most, where Ivstice is embrac'd: And eeke so many famous men, within her chaire are plac'd. ? sed comprime motus, Nec tibi quid liceat, sed quid fecisse licebit, Occurrat, mentem? domet respectus honesti. Amicitia fucata vitanda. Of open foes, wee alwaies maie beware, And arme our selues, theire Malice to withstande: Yea, thoughe they smile, yet haue wee still a care, Wee trust them not, althoughe they giue theire hande: Theire Foxes coate, theire fained harte bewraies, Wee neede not doubt, bicause wee knowe theire waies. But those, of whome wee must in daunger bee, Are deadlie foes, that doe in secret lurke, Whoe lie in waite, when that wee can not see, And vnawares, doe our destruction worke: No foe so fell, (as Bias wise declares) As man to man, when mischeife hee prepares. Pernicies homini quæ maxima? solus homo alter. Bias Sobriè potandum. A thirstie dogge, to Nilvs runnes to drinke, A Crocodile, was readie in the flood: Which made the dogge, to lappe harde by the brinke, As one that much in feare of poisoning stood: And sparingly, began to coole his heate, When as hee sawe, this Serpent lye in waite. This carefull dogge, condemnes those careles wightes, Althoughe he bee of brutisshe kynde, bycause Those reason lacke, that spend both daies, and nightes, Without regard, in keeping Bacchvs lawes: And when throughe drinke, on feete they can not stande, Yet as they lye, they haue their boales in hande.

When Hectors force, throughe mortall wounde did faile, And life beganne, to dreadefull deathe to yeelde: The Greekes moste gladde, his dyinge corpes assaile, Who late did flee before him in the fielde: Which when he sawe, quothe hee nowe worke your spite, For so, the hares the Lion dead doe byte. Looke here vpon, you that doe wounde the dead, With slaunders vile, and speeches of defame: Or bookes procure, and libelles to be spread, When they bee gone, for to deface theire name: Who while they liu'de, did feare you with theire lookes, And for theire skill, you might not beare their bookes.

The Gluttons fatte, that daintie fare deuoure, And seeke about, to satisfie theire taste: And what they like, into theire bellies poure, This iustlie blames, for surfettes come in haste: And biddes them feare, their sweete, and dulcet meates, For oftentimes, the same are deadlie baites. ?

The raging Sea, that roares, with fearefull sounde, And threatneth all the worlde to ouerflowe: The shore sometimes, his billowes doth rebounde, Though ofte it winnes, and giues the earthe a blowe Sometimes, where shippes did saile: it makes a lande. Sometimes againe they saile: where townes did stande. So, if the Lorde did not his rage restraine, And set his boundes, so that it can not passe: The worlde shoulde faile, and man coulde not remaine, But all that is, shoulde soone be turn'd to was: By raging Sea, is ment our ghostlie foe, By earthe, mans soule: he seekes to ouerthrowe. And as the surge doth worke both daie, and nighte, And shakes the shore, and ragged rockes doth rente: So Sathan stirres, with all his maine, and mighte, Continuall siege, our soules to circumuente. Then watche, and praie, for feare wee sleepe in sinne, For cease our crime: and hee can nothing winne. Dicta septem sapientum. To Sir Hvghe Cholmeley Knight. The sages seuen, whose fame made Grecia glad, For wisedome greate, amongst theire sainges wise: Eache one of them, a goulden sentence had, And Alciat, did the pictures thus deuise, For to obserue the vse of Emblems righte, Which represent the meaning to our sighte. Keepe still the meane, did Cleobulvs teache: For measure, lo, the ballance loyn'd thereto. And Knowe thy selfe, did Chilon alwaies preache: The glasse behoulde, that thou the same maiste doe. Restraine thy wrathe, dothe Periander tell: And shewes an hearbe, that choller dothe expell. Nothinge too mutche, did Pittacvs commende, Thereto a flower, whereof too muche destroyes. And Solon sai'd, Remember still thy ende, Before the which, none can haue perfect ioyes: A piller form'd, declininge downe he showes, Which telles that deathe, the strongest ouerthrowes. Of wicked men the number dothe exceede: This Bias vs'd: and cause for foule defame, Sardinia moste is stained, as we reade, On asses backe, behoulde one of the same. And Thales, laste of all the Sages, say'd: Flee sewertiship, for feare thou be betray'd. And vnderneathe, a birde vpon the net, That dothe not feare, the craftie foulers call, Hereby wee ofte, doe paie an others debte, And free our frendes, and bringe our selues in thrall: Which sayinges wise, whoe keepe them in their brestes, By proofe shall finde, they harbour happie guestes. Scripta manent. To Sir Arthvre Manwaringe Knight. If mightie Troie, with gates of steele, and brasse, Bee worne awaie, with tracte of stealinge time: If Carthage, raste: if Thebes be growne with grasse. If Babel stoope: that to the cloudes did clime: If Athens, and Nvmantia suffered spoile: If Ægypt spires, be euened with the soile. Then, what maye laste, which time dothe not impeache, Since that wee see, theise monumentes are gone: Nothinge at all, but time doth ouer reache, It eates the steele, and weares the marble stone: But writinges laste, thoughe yt doe what it can, And are preseru'd, euen since the worlde began. And so they shall, while that they same dothe laste, Which haue declar'd, and shall to future age: What thinges before three thousande yeares haue paste, What martiall knightes, haue march'd vppon this stage: Whose actes, in bookes if writers did not saue, Their fame had ceaste, and gone with them to graue. Of Samsons strengthe, of worthie Iosvas might. Of Davids actes, of Alexanders force, Of CÆsar greate; and Scipio noble knight, Howe shoulde we speake, but bookes thereof discourse: Then fauour them, that learne within their youthe: But loue them beste, that learne, and write the truthe. De morte, &amp; amore: Iocosum. To Edward Dyer Esquier. While furious Mors, from place, to place did flie, And here, and there, her fatall dartes did throwe: At lengthe shee mette, with Cupid passing by, Who likewise had, bene busie with his bowe: Within one Inne, they bothe togeather stay'd, And for one nighte, awaie theire shooting lay'd. The morrowe next, they bothe awaie doe haste, And eache by chaunce, the others quiuer takes: The frozen dartes, on Cupiddes backe weare plac'd, The fierie dartes, the leane virago shakes: Whereby ensued, suche alteration straunge, As all the worlde, did wonder at the chaunge. For gallant youthes, whome Cupid thoughte to wounde, Of loue, and life, did make an ende at once. And aged men, whome deathe woulde bringe to grounde: Beganne againe to loue, with sighes, and grones; Thus natures lawes, this chaunce infringed soe: That age did loue, and youthe to graue did goe. Till at the laste, as Cupid drewe his bowe, Before he shotte: a younglinge thus did crye, Oh Venus sonne, thy dartes thou doste not knowe, They pierce too deepe: for all thou hittes, doe die: Oh spare our age, who honored thee of oulde, Theise dartes are bone, take thou the dartes of goulde. Which beinge saide, a while did Cupid staye, And sawe, how youthe was almoste cleane extinct: And age did doate, with garlandes freshe, and gaye, And heades all balde, weare newe in wedlocke linckt: Wherefore he shewed, this error vnto Mors, Who miscontent, did chaunge againe perforce. Yet so, as bothe some dartes awaie conuay'd, Which weare not theirs: yet vnto neither knowne, Some bonie dartes, in Cupiddes quiuer stay'd, Some goulden dartes, had Mors amongst her owne. Then, when wee see, vntimelie deathe appeare: Or wanton age: it was this chaunce you heare. Prudentes vino abstinent. Loe here the vine dothe claspe, to prudent Pallas tree, The league is nought, for virgines wise, doe Bacchus frendship flee. Alciat. Quid me vexatis rami?

In colores. To Edwarde Paston Esquier. The dier, loe, in smoke, and heate doth toile, Mennes fickle mindes to please, with sundrie hues: And though hee learne newe collours still to boile, Yet varijng men, woulde faine some newer choose: And seeke for that, which arte can not deuise, When that the ould, mighte verie well suffise. And some of them, here brieflie to recite, And to declare, with whome they best agree: For mourners, blacke. for the religious, white. Which is a signe, of conscience pure, and free. The greene, agrees with them in hope that liue: And eeke to youthe, this colour wee do giue. The yelowe next, vnto the couetous wighte. And vnto those, whome ielousie doth fret. The man refus'd, in Taunye doth delite. The collour Redde, let martiall captaines get. And little boies, whome shamefastnes did grace, The Romaines deck'd, in Scarlet like their face. The marriners, the Blewe becometh well. Bicause it showes the colour of the sea: And Prophettes, that of thinges deuine foretell, The men content, like Violet arraie. And laste, the poore and meaner sorte prouide, The medley, graye, and russet, neuer dy'de. Loe here, a fewe of colours plaine expreste, And eeke the men, with whome they best agree: Yet euerie one, doth thinke his hewe the beste, And what one likes, an other lothes to see: For Nature thoughe ten thousande colours haue, Yet vnto man, more varrijng mindes she gaue. Nowe straungers, who their countries still commende, And make vs muse, with colours they recite: Maye thinke our lande, small choise of hues doth lende. Bycause so fewe, of manie I doe write. Yet let them knowe, my Aucthor these presentes, Inoughe for those, whome reason still contentes. But saye wee lacke, their herbes, their wormes, their flies, And want the meanes: their gallant hues to frame. Yet Englande, hath her store of orient dies, And eeke therein, a Dyer most of fame, Who, alwaies hathe so fine, and freshe, a hewe, That in their landes, the like is not to vewe. Jn studiosum captum amore. A Reuerend sage, of wisedome most profounde, Beganne to doate, and laye awaye his bookes: For Cvpid then, his tender harte did wounde, That onlie nowe, he lik'de his ladies lookes? Oh Venvs staie? since once the price was thine, Thou ought'st not still, at Pallas thus repine. Omnes humanos sanat medicina dolores: Solus amor morbi non amat artificem. Propert. 2. Abstinentia.

The marble showes: they must bee firme, and sure, And not be pierc'd, nor mooued from the truthe: The reste declare: they must bee cleane, and pure; And not inclin'd to rigor, or to ruthe. But, when a cause before them shalbee harde, With conscience cleare, let them the same decide: No Ritche, or Poore, or frend, or foe, regarde. For feare, they doe throughe theire affections slide: But let them washe, theire handes from euerie crime, That God maye blesse, and here prolonge theire time.

The shippe, that longe vppon the sea dothe saile, And here, and there, with varrijng windes is toste: On rockes, and sandes, in daunger ofte to quaile. Yet at the lengthe, obtaines the wished coaste: Which beinge wonne, the trompetts ratlinge blaste, Dothe teare the skie, for ioye of perills paste. Thoughe master reste, thoughe Pilotte take his ease, Yet nighte, and day, the ship her course dothe keepe: So, whilst that man dothe saile theise worldlie seas, His voyage shortes: althoughe he wake, or sleepe. And if he keepe his course directe, he winnes That wished porte, where lastinge ioye beginnes. Tardè aggredere, quod aggressurus sis perseueranter prosequere. Nam vt inquit Greg. lib. 1. Mor. Incassum bonum agitur, si ante vitæ terminum deseratur: Quia frustra velociter currit, qui prius, quàm ad metas venerit, deficit. Demetrius Phaler. Ex Bello, pax. To Hvghe Cholmeley Esquier. The helmet stronge, that did the head defende, Beholde, for hyue, the bees in quiet seru'd: And when that warres, with bloodie bloes, had ende. They, hony wroughte, where souldiour was preseru'd: Which doth declare, the blessed fruites of peace, How sweete shee is, when mortall warres doe cease. Pax me certa ducis placidos curuauit in vsus: Agricolæ nunc slum, militis ante fui. De falce ex ense, Martialis. Calumniam contra calumniatorem virtus repellit. Who so with force against the marble wall, Or piller stronge, doth shoote, to pierce the same: It not preuailes, for doune the arrowes fall, Or backe rebounde, to him from whence they came: So slaunders foule, and wordes like arrowes keene, Not vertue hurtes, but turnes her foes to teene. Sic spectanda fides. To George Manwaringe Esquier. The touche doth trye, the fine, and purest goulde: And not the sound, or els the goodly showe. So, if mennes wayes, and vertues, wee behoulde, The worthy men, wee by their workes, shall knowe. But gallant lookes, and outward showes beguile, And ofte are clokes to cogitacions vile. Illicitum non sperandum. Here Nemesis, and Hope: our deedes doe rightlie trie. Which warnes vs, not to hope for that, which iustice doth denie. Feriunt summos fulmina montes. To I. T. Esquier. The bandogge, fitte to matche the bull, or beare, With burthens greate, is loden euery daye: Or drawes the carte, and forc'd the yoke to weare: Where littell dogges doe passe their time in playe: And ofte, are bould to barke, and eeke to bite, When as before, they trembled at his sighte. Yet, when in bondes they see his thrauled state, Eache bragginge curre, beginnes to square, and brall: The freër sorte, doe wonder at his fate, And thinke them beste, that are of stature small: For they maie sleepe vppon their mistris bedde, And on their lappes, with daynties still bee fedde. The loftie pine, with axe is ouerthrowne, And is prepar'd, to serue the shipmans turne: When bushes stande, till stormes bee ouerblowne. And lightninges flashe, the mountaine toppes doth burne. All which doe shewe: that pompe, and worldlie power, Makes monarches, markes: when varrijnge fate doth lower. Luxuriant animi rebus plerumque secundis, Nec facile est æqua commoda mente pati. Ouid. 2. Art. Amandi. Perfidus familiaris. To G. B. Esquier. While throughe his foes, did boulde Brasidas thruste, And thought with force, their courage to confounde: Throughe targat faire, wherein he put his truste, His manlie corpes receau'd a mortall wounde. Beinge ask'd the cause, before he yeelded ghoste: Quoth hee, my shielde, wherein I trusted moste. Euen so it happes, wee ofte our bayne doe brue, When ere wee trie, wee trust the gallante showe: When frendes suppoas'd, do prooue them selues vntrue, When Sinon false, in Damons shape dothe goe: Then gulfes of griefe, doe swallowe vp our mirthe, And thoughtes ofte times, doe shrow'd vs in the earthe. All is not goulde that glittereth to the eye: Some poison stronge, a sugred taste doth keepe; The crabbe ofte times, is beautifull to see. The Adder fell, within the flowers doth creepe: The brauest tombe, hath stinking bones within: So fawninge mates, haue alwaies faithlesse bin. Yet, to preuent such harmes before they fall, Thinke howe thy frende, maie liue to bee thy foe: Then, when your loue exceedeth moste of all, Looke that thy tonge, doe not at randonne goe: For feare thy speeche, doe turne vnto thy smarte, If that thy mate, doe beare a Ivdas harte. But, if thou doe inioye a faithfull frende, See that with care, thou keepe him as thy life: And if perhappes he doe, that maye offende, Yet waye thy frende: and shunne the cause of strife, Remembringe still, there is no greater crosse; Then of a frende, for, to sustaine the losse. Yet, if this knotte of frendship be to knitte, And Scipio yet, his Lelivs can not finde? Content thy selfe, till some occasion fitte, Allot thee one, according to thy minde: Then trie, and truste: so maiste thou liue in rest, But chieflie see, thou truste thy selfe the beste? In copia minor error. The ape in tree, beganne at foxe beneath to raile: And said, hee was a shamelesse beast to weare so great a taile. Then aunswere made the foxe, I maye thee more deride, Bicause thou haste no taile at all, thy shamelesse partes to hide. Which shewes the bitter fruite, that doth of mocking springe: For scorners ofte, such mates doe meete, that worse then serpentes stinge. Uindice fato. To G. B. sen. Esquier. When sentence wronge, of will, and rigor vile, Was fram'd, to please the Emperor Valens minde: Which shoulde condemne Sainct Basil to exile: And nothinge lack'd, but that it was not sign'd: Th' Emperor thoughte to take no longer pause, But tooke his penne, for to confirme the cause. But all in vayne, the quill would take no inke, Yet still herein, he lewdlie did persiste: Vntill his hande beganne to shake, and shrinke, Whereby, the penne did fall out of his fiste: Wherefore for feare, he rente the writte in twaine, Then feare the Lorde, and rashe attemptes refraine. Homo homini lupus. No mortall foe so full of poysoned spite, As man, to man, when mischiefe he pretendes: The monsters huge, as diuers aucthors write, Yea Lions wilde, and fishes weare his frendes: And when their deathe, by frendes suppos'd was sought, They kindnesse shew'd, and them from daunger brought. Arion lo, who gained store of goulde, In countries farre: with harpe, and pleasant voice: Did shipping take, and to Corinthvs woulde, And to his wishe, of pilottes made his choise: Who rob'd the man, and threwe him to the sea, A Dolphin, lo, did beare him safe awaie. Quis nescit vastas olim delphina per vndas, Lesbida cum sacro vate tulisse lyram? Parad poëticus. In curiosos. Let maidens sowe; let schollers: plie the schooles.

Let Grimme haue coales: and lobbe his whippe to lashe. Let none presume an others arte to vse, But trie the trade, to which he hath bene kept: But those that like a skill vnknowne to choose, Let them behoulde: while that the workeman slept, The toying ape, was tempringe with his blockes, Vntill his foote was crush'd within the stockes. Nauita de ventis; de tauris narrat arator; Enumerat miles vulnera; pastor oues. Propert. 2. 1. In iuuentam. Two sonnes of Iove that best of man deserue, Apollo great, and Bacchvs, this impartes: With diet good, the one doth healthe preserue, With pleasante wine, the other cheares our hartes. And theise, the worlde immortall Goddes would haue, Bicause longe life, with sweete delighte, they gaue. But if theise are so soueraigne vnto man, That here, with ioye they doe increase his daies, And freshe doe make the carefull colour wanne: And keepe him longe from sicknes, and disease: I graunte, they ought to be renowmed more, Then all the Goddes, the Poëttes did adore. Tu vino curas, tu victu dilue morbos, Vt lento accedat curua senecta pede. Alciat. ad eosdem sie. Fel in melle. Lo Cvpid here, the honie hyes to taste, On whome, the bees did straight extende their power: For whilst at will he did their labours waste, He founde that sweete, was sauced with the sower: And till that time hee thought no little thinges, Weare of suche force: or armed so with stinges. Thy hyues weare plac'd accordinge to his minde, The weather warme, the honie did abounde. And Cvpid iudg'd the bees of harmelesse kinde, But whilste he tri'de his naked corpes they wounde: And then to late his rashe attempte hee ru'de, When after sweete, so tarte a taste insu'de. So ofte it happes, when wee our fancies feede, And only ioye in outwarde gallant showes. The inwarde man, if that wee doe not heede, Wee ofte, doe plucke a nettle for a rose: No baite so sweete as beautie, to the eie, Yet ofte, it hathe worse poyson then the bee. Ferè Simile ex Theocrito. To Lavra. Whilst Cvpid had desire to taste the honie sweete, And thrust his hand into the tree, a bee with him did meete. The boye no harme did doubt, vntill he felt the stinge: But after to his mother ranne, and ofte his handes did wringe. And cry'd to her for helpe, and toulde what hap befell: Howe that a little beast with pricke, did make his finger swell. Then Venvs smiling say'd, if that a little bee? Doe hurte so sore: thinke howe thou hurt'st? that art a childe to see. For where the bee can pierce no further then the skinne: Thy dartes do giue so great a wounde, they pierce the harte within. Cùm quo conuenit aliud ex Anacreonte. As Venvs sonne within the roses play'd, An angrie bee that crept therein vnseene, The wanton wagge with poysoned stinge assay'd: Whereat, aloude he cri'de, throughe smarte, and teene. And sought about, his mother for to finde: To whome, with griefe he vttered all his minde. And say'd, behoulde, a little creature wilde, Whome husbandmen (I heare) doe call a bee, Hath prick'd mee sore alas: whereat shee smil'de, And say'd: my childe, if this be griefe to thee, Remember then, althoughe thou little arte? What greeuous wounde, thou makest with thy darte. Amor sui. To D. E. Narcissvs lou'de, and liked so his shape, He died at lengthe with gazinge there vppon: Which shewes selfe loue, from which there fewe can scape, A plague too rife: bewitcheth manie a one. The ritche, the pore, the learned, and the sotte, Offende therein: and yet they see it not. This, makes vs iudge too well of our desertes, When others smile, our ignorance to see: And whie? Bicause selfe loue doth wounde our hartes, And makes vs thinke, our deedes alone to bee. Whiche secret sore, lies hidden from our eyes, And yet the same, an other plainlie sees. What follie-more, what dotage like to this? And doe we so our owne deuise esteeme? Or can we see so soone an others misse? And not our owne? Oh blindnes most extreme. Affect not then, but trye, and prooue thy deedes, For of selfe loue, reproche, and shame proceedes. Nusquam tuta fides. No state so sure, no seate within this life But that maie fall, thoughe longe the same haue stoode: Here fauninge foes, here fained frendes are rife. With pickthankes, blabbes, and subtill Sinons broode, Who when wee truste, they worke our ouerthrowe, And vndermine the grounde, wheron wee goe. The Olephant so huge, and stronge to see, No perill fear'd: but thought a sleepe to gaine But foes before had vndermin'de the tree, And downe he falles, and so by them was slaine: First trye, then truste: like goulde, the copper showes: And Nero ofte, in Nvmas clothinge goes. Fœdera mortales ne sæuo rumpite ferro, Sed castam seruate fidem: fulgentibus ostro Hæs potior-regnis, &amp;c. Silius 13. Quod non capit Christus, rapit fiscus. Where couetousnes the scepter doth supporte, There, greedie gripes the Kinge dothe ofte extoll: Bicause, he knowes they, doe but make a sporte, His subiectes poore, to shaue, to pill, and poll? And when he sees, that they are fatte, and full? He cuttes them of, that he maye haue theire wolle? Vnto a sponge, theise are resembled righte: Which drie at firste, when it with water swelles, The hande that late did wette it, being lighte: The same againe, the moisture quite expelles. And to the flood, from whence it latelie came, It runnes againe, with wringinge of the same. Orbem iam totum victor Romanus habebat, Quà mare, quà terræ, quà sidus currit vtrumque, Nec satiatus erat, grauidis freta pulsa carinis, Iam peragrabantur, si quis sinus abditus vltra, Si qua foret tellus, quæ fuluum mitteret aurum, &amp;c. Petrus Arbiter. Paupertatem summis ingeniis obesse ne prouehantur. Ad Doctiss. virum Dn. W. Malim. One hande with winges, woulde flie vnto the starres, And raise mee vp to winne immortall fame: But my desire, necessitie still barres, And in the duste doth burie vp my name: That hande woulde flie, th' other still is bounde, With heauie stone, which houldes it to the grounde. My wishe, and will, are still to mounte alofte. My wante, and woe, denie me my desire: I shewe theire state, whose witte, and learninge, ofte Excell, and woulde to highe estate aspire: But pouertie, with heauie clogge of care, Still pulles them downe, when they ascending are. Haud facilè emergunt, quorum virtutibus obstat Res. angusta domi, &amp;c. Inuenalit. Pro bono, malum. The stagge, that hardly skap'd the hunters in the chase, At lengthe, by shadowe of a tree, founde refuge for a space. And when the eger houndes had lefte their wished praye, Behoulde, with biting of the boughes, him selfe hee did bewraye. Throughe which, the hunter straight did pierce him to the harte: Whereat, (quoth hee) this wounde I haue, is iustly my deserte. For where I good did finde, I ought not ill requite: But lo, these boughes that sau'd my life, I did vnkindly bite. Wherefore, althoughe the tree could not reuenge her wronge: Yet nowe by fates, my fall is wrought, who mighte haue liued longe. In pace de bello. The bore did whette his tuskes, the foxe demaunded why: Since that he had no foes at hande, that should their sharpnes try. To which, he answere made, when foes doe me beset, They all aduantage gladlie take, and giue no leane to whet. Which teacheth vs, in peace, our force for warres to frame: Whereby, we either shall subdue, or loose the field with fame. Aliena pericula, cautiones nostræ. The lyon, asse, and foxe, goe forthe to hunte for pray: Which done: the lyon bad the asse, the spoile in partes to lay. Then he with greate regarde, three partes alike did share: Wherat, the lyon in a rage, the asse in peeces tare. The foxe he charged then, for to performe the same: Who, all the beste, vppon one heape, did for the lyon frame: And littell of the worste, did for him selfe reserue: Then beinge ask'd, what taughte him so vnequally to carue? This spectacle (quoth hee) which I behoulde with care: Which showes, those happie that can bee by others harmes beware. Indulgentia parentum, filiorum pernicies. A theefe, condemn'd to dye, to execution lead: His wofull mother did beholde, for sorowe almoste dead. And whilst she kiss'd her sonne, whome she did tender deare: The towarde childe did kisse with teeth? and off her nose did teare? Whereat, the standers by exclaymed at his acte: Then quoth the theefe, my masters marke, I will defend the facte. My mother, in my youthe, did with my faults dispence: And euermore did like me best, when I did most offence. So that, she was the cause that made me doe amisse: For if shee had correction vs'de, I had not come to this. Wherefore, I did reuenge my wronge, in what I mighte: In hope my facte shall mothers warne, that doe behould this sighte. For if the Children steale, and come vnto the rope: It often is the parentes faulte, for giuing them such scope. Dolor è medicina. A purblinde dame agreed with one to helpe her sight; Who, daylie when he home retorn'd, did steale what so he might. At lengthe when all was gone, the pacient gan to see: And then, the false Phisition ask'd the price, they did agree. Whereat quoth she, alas, no remedie I finde: Bycause my sences either faile, or ells my eies bee blinde. For, where my house before was garnish'd euerie nooke: I, nowe can see no goodes at all, though rounde about I looke. Dura vsu molliora. When first the foxe, the lyon did behoulde, Hee quak'd for feare, and almost dead did fall: The second time, he waxed somewhat boulde; But at the third, hee had no feare at all. Which shewes, that artes at first moste harde to see, With triall oft, both playne, and easie bee. In eos, qui, proximioribus spretis, remotiora sequuntur. Th' ASTRONOMER, by night beheld the starres to shine: And what should chaunce an other yeare, began for to deuine. But while too longe in skyes, the curious foole did dwell, As hee was marchinge through the shade, he slipt into a well. Then crying out for helpe, had frendes at hand, by chaunce; And nowe his perill being past; they thus at him doe glaunce. What foolishe art is this? (quoth they) thou hould'st so deare, That doth forshowe the perilles farre: but not the daungers neare. Saturnus procul est, iàmque olim cæcus, vt aiunt, Nec propè discernens à puero lapidem: Luna verecundis formosa incedit ocellis, Nec nisi virgineum virgo videre potest: Iupiter Europam, Martem Venus, &amp; Venerem Mars, Daphnen Sol, Hersen Mercurius recolit: Hinc factum, Astrologe, est, tua cùm capit vxor amantes, Sidera significent vt nihil inde tibi. Morus in Epig. Post fata: vxor morosa, etiam discors. Colasmvs wife, in raging flood was drown'd? Who longe did seeke her corpes, against the streame: His neigbours thought his sences weare not sound? And did deride his madnes most extreme: Who call'd aloude, thy wife beneath did fall? Then dounwarde seeke, or seeke thou not at all. To whome quoth he, the place belowe I see, Yet in her life, gainst reason she did striue: And contrarie to euerie one, woulde bee; Wherefore, I knowe this way she needes must driue? Then leaue, quoth they, and let her still be drown'd, For such a wife is better loste then founde? Dum ætatis ver agitur: consule brumæ. In winter coulde, when tree, and bushe, was bare, And frost had nip'd the rootes of tender grasse: The antes, with ioye did feede vpon their fare, Which they had stor'de, while sommers season was: To whome, for foode the grashopper did crie, And said she staru'd, if they did helpe denie. Whereat, an ante, with longe experience wise? And frost, and snowe, had manie winters seene: Inquired, what in sommer was her guise. Quoth she, I songe, and hop't in meadowes greene: Then quoth the ante, content thee with thy chaunce, For to thy songe, nowe art thou light to daunce? Bilingues cauendi. A Satyre, and his hoste, in mid of winters rage, At night, did hye them to the fire, the could for to asswage, The man with could that quak'd, vpon his handes did blowe: Which thinge the Satyre marked well; and crau'd the cause to knowe. Who answere made, herewith my fingers I doe heate: At lengthe when supper time was come, and bothe sat downe to eate; He likewise blewe his brothe, he tooke out of the potte: Being likewise asked why: (quoth hee) bicause it is to whotte. To which the Satyre spake, and blow'st thou whotte, and coulde? Hereafter, with such double mouthes, I will no frendship houlde. Which warneth all, to shonne a double tonged mate: And let them neither suppe, nor dine, nor come within thy gate. Ars deluditur arte. The sickly foxe, within her hole was hid, Where, to the mouthe, the lion straight did hye; And did demaunde most frendly, how shee did, And saide, his tonge woulde helpe her, by and by? Bicause there was such vertue hid therein, That all he heal'd, if he did licke their skinne. Then quoth the foxe, my Lorde? I doe not doubt, But that your tonge is soueraigne, as I heare: But yet, it hath such neighbours round about? It can not helpe, I iudge, while they be neare. Wherefore, I wishe you woulde them banishe all? Or ells, I thinke your pacients wilbee small. In cos qui multa promittunt, &amp; nihil præstant. The crying babe, the mother sharply threates, Except he ceas'd, he shoulde to wolfe bee throwne: Which being hard, the wolfe at windowe waites, And made account that child should bee his owne: Till at the lengthe, agayne he hard her say Feare not sweete babe, thou shalt not bee his pray. For, if he come in hope to sucke thy blood, Wee wil him kill, before he shall departe: With that the wolfe retorned to the wood, And did exclayme thus wise with heauie hart: Oh Iupiter? what people now doe liue, That promise much, and yet will nothing giue. Pietas filiorum in parentes. Aeneas beares his father, out of Troye, When that the Greekes, the same did spoile, and sacke: His father might of suche a sonne haue ioye, Who throughe his foes, did beare him on his backe: No fier, nor sworde, his valiaunt harte coulde feare, To flee awaye, without his father deare. Which showes, that sonnes must carefull bee, and kinde, For to releeue their parentes in distresse: And duringe life, that dutie shoulde them binde, To reuerence them, that God their daies maie blesse: And reprehendes tenne thowsande to their shame, Who ofte dispise the stocke whereof they came. Hinc satus Æneas: pietas spectata per ignes: Sacra patrem? humeris: altera sacra, tulit. Ouid. 4. Fast. Aliquid mali propter vicinum malum. To my Father M. Geffrey Whitney. Two pottes, within a runninge streame weare toste, The one of yearth, the other, was of brasse: The brasen potte, who wish'd the other loste, Did bid it staie, and neare her side to passe. Whereby they might, togeather ioyned sure: Without all doubt, the force of flood indure. The earthen potte, then thus did answeare make, This neighborhood doth put me much in feare? I rather choose, my chaunce farre of to take, Then to thy side, for to be ioyned neare, For if wee hitte, my parte shalbe the wurste, And thou shalt scape, when I am all to burste. The running streame, this worldlie sea dothe shewe; The pottes, present the mightie, and the pore: Whoe here, a time are tossed too, and froe, But if the meane, dwell nighe the mighties dore, He maie be hurte, but cannot hurte againe, Then like, to like: or beste alone remaine. Post amara dulcia. To M. Thomas Mynors. Sharpe prickes preserue the Rose, on euerie parte, That who in haste to pull the same intendes, Is like to pricke his fingers, till they smarte? But being gotte, it makes him straight amendes It is so freshe, and pleasant to the smell, Thoughe he was prick'd, he thinkes he ventur'd well. And he that faine woulde get the gallant rose, And will not reache, for feare his fingers bleede; A nettle, is more fitter for his nose? Or hemblocke meete his appetite to feede? None merites sweete, who tasted not the sower, Who feares to climbe, deserues no fruicte, nor flower. Which showes, we shoulde not fainte for anie paine, For to atchieue the fruictes of our desire: But still proceede, and hope at lengthe to gaine, The thinges wee wishe, and craue with hartes entire: Which all our toile, and labour, shall requite, For after paine, comes pleasure, and delighte. When winter endes, comes in the pleasant springe. When nighte is done, the gladsome daye appeares. When greifes be gone, then ioye doth make vs singe. When stormes be paste, the varijng weather cleares. So after paines, our pleasures make vs glad, But without sower, the sweete is hardlie had. Ueritas inuicta. To my vncle Geffrey Cartwrighte. Thovghe Sathan striue, with all his maine, and mighte, To hide the truthe, and dimme the lawe deuine: Yet to his worde, the Lorde doth giue such lighte, That to the East, and West, the same doth shine: And those, that are so happie for to looke, Saluation finde, within that blessed booke. Si Deus nobiscum, quis contranos? His seruauntes God preserues, thoughe they in danger fall: Euen as from vipers deadlie bite, he kept th' Appostle Paule. Cum tempore mutamur. Ad Dn. Iohannem Croxton. Times change, and wee doe alter in the same, And in one staye, there nothing still maye bee: What Monarches greate, that wanne the chiefest fame, But stealinge time, their birthe, and deathe, did see: Firste Nestor suck'd, and Homer first was taughte, Bothe famous once, yet both to dust are broughte. Wee first are younge, and then to age we yeelde, Then flit awaye, as we had not bene borne: No wight so stronge, but time doth winne the feelde, Yea wonders once, are out of memorie worne: This Ægypte spires, and Babell, sawe in fine, When they did mounte, and when they did decline. Fœlix qui propriis æuum transegit in auris, Ipsa domus puerum quem vïdet ipsa senem; Qui baculo nitens, in qua reptauit arena, Vnius numerat sæcula longa casæ: Illum non vario traxit fortuna tumultu, Nec bibit ignotas mobilis hospes aquas. Claud. de Senec. Veronensi. Si nihil attuleris, ibis Homere foras. To M. Matthew Pattenson. Sometime was witte esteem'de, of greater price then goulde: But wisedome pore, maie nowe goe begge? and starue without for coulde. Yea, thoughe that Homer come, with all the Muses guarde, Yet if he nothinge bringe? must faste, and stande within the yarde? Ingenium superat vires. Mans wisedome great, doth farre surpasse his strengthe, For proofe, behoulde, no man could bende the bowe: But yet, his witte deuised at the lengthe, To winde the stringe so farre as it shoulde goe: Then wisedome chiefe, and strengthe, must come behinde, But bothe be good, and giftes from God assignde. Malè parta malè dilabuntur. In fœneratores. An vserer, whose Idol was his goulde, Within his house, a peeuishe ape retain'd: A seruaunt fitte, for suche a miser oulde, Of whome both mockes, and apishe mowes, he gain'd. Thus, euerie daie he made his master sporte, And to his clogge, was chained in the courte. At lengthe it hap'd? while greedie graundsir din'de? The ape got loose, and founde a windowe ope: Where in he leap'de, and all about did finde, The God, wherein the Miser put his hope? Which soone he broch'd, and forthe with speede did flinge, And did delighte on stones to heare it ringe? The sighte, righte well the passers by did please, Who did reioyce to finde these goulden crommes: That all their life, their pouertie did ease. Of goodes ill got, loe heere the fruicte that commes. Looke herevppon, you that haue Midas minte, And bee posseste with hartes as harde as flinte. Shut windowes close, leste apes doe enter in, And doe disperse your goulde, you doe adore. But woulde you learne to keepe, that you do winne? Then get it well, and hourde it not in store. If not: no boultes, nor brasen barres will serue, For God will waste your stocke, and make your sterue. Ferè simile præcedenti, ex Alciato. The greedie kyte, so full his gorge had cloy'de, He coulde not brooke his late deuoured praie: Wherefore with griefe, vnto his damme hee cry'de, My bowelles lo, alas doe waste awaie. With that quoth shee, why doste thou make thy mone, This losse thou haste is nothinge of thy owne. By which is mente, that they who liue by spoile, By rapine, thefte, or gripinge goodes by mighte, If that with losse they suffer anie foile, They loose but that, wherein they had no righte? Hereof, at firste the prouerbe oulde did growe: That goodes ill got, awaie as ill will goe. Usus libri, non lectio prudentes facit. Ad D. A. P. The volumes great, who so doth still peruse, And dailie turnes, and gazeth on the same, If that the fruicte thereof, he do not vse, He reapes but toile, and neuer gaineth fame: Firste reade, then marke, then practise that is good, For without vse, we drinke but Lethe flood. Of practise longe, experience doth proceede; And wisedome then, doth euermore ensue: Then printe in minde, what wee in printe do reade, Els loose wee time, and bookes in vaine do vewe: Wee maie not haste, our talent to bestowe, Nor hide it vp, whereby no good shall growe. Lectio multorum voluminum, &amp; omnis generis auctorum, habet aliquid vagum &amp; instabile: certis ingeniis immorari &amp; innutriri oportet, si velis aliquid trahere, quod in animo fideliter sedeat. Senec. 1. Epist. 2. Studiis inuigilandum. Ad iuuentutem Scholæ Aldelemensis in Anglia. Whiles prime of youthe, is freshe within his flower, Take houlde of time: for it doth haste awaye. Watche, write, and reade, and spende no idle hower, Inritche your mindes with some thinge, euerie daye: For losse of time, all other losse exceedes, And euermore it late repentaunce breedes. The idle sorte, that ignoraunce doe taste, Are not esteem'd, when they in yeares doe growe: The studious, are with vnderstanding grac'd, And still prefer'd, thoughe first their caulinge lowe. Then haue regarde, to banishe idle fittes, And in your youthe, with skill adorne your wittes. Whereby, in time such hap maye you aduaunce, As bothe your Towne, and countrie, you maye frende: For, what I woulde vnto my selfe shoulde chaunce: To you I wishe, wheare I my prime did spende. Wherefore behoulde this candle, booke, and glasse: To vse your time, and knowe how time dothe passe. Præcocia non diuturna. Doctissimo viro D. Stephano Limberto Nordouicensis Scholæ Magistro. The fruicte that soonest ripes, doth soonest fade awaie. And that which slowlie hath his time, will not so soone decaie. Our writing in the duste, can not indure a blaste: But that, which is in marble wroughte, from age, to age, doth laste. Euen so it is of wittes, some quicke, to put in vre: Some dull to learne, but oftentimes the slowe are sounde, and sure. And thoughe the apte, and prompte: soone learne, and soone forget. Yet ofte the dull doe beare in minde, what first therein was set. Hereof the prouerbe comes: Soone ripe, soone rotten turnes: And greenest wood, though kindlinge longe, yet whottest most it burnes. O formose puer, nimium ne crede colori. Alba ligustra cadunt, vaccinia nigra leguntur. Virg. Eclog. 2. In fœcunditatem, sibiipsi damnosam. If sence I had, my owne estate to knowe, Before all trees, my selfe hath cause to crie: In euerie hedge, and common waye, I growe, Where, I am made a praye, to passers by: And when, they see my nuttes are ripe, and broune, My bowghes are broke, my leaues are beaten doune. Thus euerie yeare, when I doe yeelde increase, My proper fruicte, my ruine doth procure: If fruictlesse I, then had I growen in peace, Oh barrennes, of all most happie, sure Which wordes with griefe, did Agrippina grone, And mothers more, whose children made them mone. Certè ego si nunquam peperissem, tutior essem: Ista Clytemnestra digna querela fuit. Locus è nuce Ouidiana. Otiosi semper egentes. Here, Idlenes doth weepe amid her wantes, Neare famished: whome, labour whippes for Ire: Here, labour sittes in chariot drawen with antes: And dothe abounde with all he can desire. The grashopper, the toyling ante derides, In Sommers heate, cause she for coulde prouides. But when the coulde of winter did increase, Out of her hill, the ante did looke for newes: Whereas she harde the grashopper to cease, And all her songes, shee nowe with sighing rues: But all to late, for now for foode she staru'd, Whereas the ante had store, she had preseru'd. All which doe warne, while that our Sommer lastes, Which is our youthe: with freshe, and liuelie strengthe. Wee muste prouide, for winters bitter blastes. Which is our age: that claimes his righte at lengthe. Wherefore in youthe, let vs prouide for age; For ere wee thinke he stealeth on the stage. Semper præsto esse infortunia. Three carelesse dames, amongste their wanton toies, Did throwe the dice, who firste of them shoulde die: And shee that loste, did laughe with inwarde ioyes, For that, shee thoughte her terme shoulde longer bee: But loe, a tyle vppon her head did fall, That deathe, with speede, this dame from dice did call. Euen so, it falles, while carelesse times wee spende: That euell happes, vnlooked for doe comme. But if wee hope, that God some good wil sende, In earnest praier, then must wee not bee domme: For blessinges good, come seild before our praier, But euell thinges doe come before we feare. Ludit in humanis diuina potentia rebus, Et certam præsens vix habet hora fidem. Ouid. 4. Pont. 3. Unica semper auis. To my countrimen of the Namptwiche in Chesshire. The Phœnix rare, with fethers freshe of hewe, Arabias righte, and sacred to the Sonne: Whome, other birdes with wonder seeme to vewe, Dothe liue vntill a thousande yeares bee ronne: Then makes a pile: which, when with Sonne it burnes, Shee flies therein, and so to ashes turnes. Whereof, behoulde, an other Phœnix rare, With speede dothe rise most beautifull and faire: And thoughe for truthe, this manie doe declare, Yet thereunto, I meane not for to sweare: Althoughe I knowe that Aucthors witnes true, What here I write, bothe of the oulde, and newe. Which when I wayed, the newe, and eke the oulde, I thought vppon your towne destroyed with fire: And did in minde, the newe Nampwiche behoulde, A spectacle for anie mans desire: Whose buildinges braue, where cinders weare but late, Did represente (me thought) the Phœnix fate. And as the oulde, was manie hundreth yeares, A towne of fame, before it felt that crosse: Euen so, (I hope) this Wiche, that nowe appeares, A Phœnix age shall laste, and knowe no losse: Which God vouchsafe, who make you thankfull, all: That see this rise, and sawe the other fall. Cælum, non animum. To R. P. Why fleest thou throughe the worlde? in hope to alter kinde: No forren soile, hath anie force to change the inward minde. Thou doste but alter aire, thou alterest not thy thoughte: No distance farre can wipe awaye, what Nature first hath wroughte. The foole, that farre is sente some wisedome to attaine: Returnes an Ideot, as he wente, and bringes the foole againe. Where rancor firste hathe roote, it growes, liue where wee shall: And where as malice is by kinde, no absence helpes at all. The catte, in countries kepte, where are no myse for praye, Yet, being broughte where they doe breede, her selfe shee doth bewraye. The beastes of crewell kinde, where hate, by nature growes, Thoughe parted longe, yet when they meete, become most deadlie foes, Which prooues, no trauaile farre, no coaste, nor countrie straunge: Hath anie force to alter kinde, or Natures worke to chaunge. Quo fugis ah demens? nulla est fuga: tu licet vsque Ad Tanaim fugias, vsque sequetur amor. Propert. 2, 30. Auri sacra fames quid non? Desire to haue, dothe make vs muche indure, In trauaile, toile, and labour voide of reste: The marchant man is caried with this lure, Throughe scorching heate, to regions of the Easte: Oh thirste of goulde, what not? but thou canst do: And make mens hartes for to consent thereto. The trauailer poore, when shippe doth suffer wracke, Who hopes to swimme vnto the wished lande, Dothe venture life, with fardle on his backe, That if he scape, the same in steede maye stande. Thus, hope of life, and loue vnto his goods, Houldes vp his chinne, with burthen in the floods. Uerbum emissum non est reuocabile. Who lookes, maye leape: and saue his shinnes from knockes. Who tries, maye truste: els flattringe frendes shall finde. He saues the steede, that keepes him vnder lockes. Who speakes with heede, maye bouldlie speake his minde. But hee, whose tonge before his witte, doth runne, Ofte speakes to soone, and greeues when he hathe done. A worde once spoke, it can retourne no more, But flies awaie, and ofte thy bale doth breede: A wife man then, settes hatche before the dore, And while he maye, doth square his speeche with heede. The birde in hande, wee maye at will restraine, But beinge flowen, wee call her backe in vaine. In occasionem. To my Kinsman M. Geffrey Whitney. What creature thou? Occasion I doe showe. On whirling wheele declare why doste thou stande? Bicause, I still am tossed too, and froe. Why doest thou houlde a rasor in thy hande? That men maie knowe I cut on euerie side, And when I come, I armies can deuide. But wherefore hast thou winges vppon thy feete? To showe, how lighte I flie with little winde. What meanes longe lockes before? that suche as meete, Maye houlde at firste, when they occasion finde. Thy head behinde all balde, what telles it more? That none shoulde houlde, that let me slippe before. Why doest thou stande within an open place? That I maye warne all people not to staye, But at the firste, occasion to imbrace, And when shee comes, to meete her by the waye. Lysippus so did thinke it best to bee, Who did deuise mine image, as you see. Potentia amoris. Here, naked loue doth sit, with smilinge cheare, No bended bowe, nor quiuer he doth beare: One hande, a fishe: the other houldes a flower: Of Sea, and Lande, to shewe that he hath power. Pulchritudo vincit. To the fairest. When creatures firste weare form'd, they had by natures lawes, The bulles, their hornes: the horses, hooses: the lions, teeth, and pawes. To hares, shee swiftenes gaue: to fishes, finnes assign'de: To birdes, their winges: so no defence was lefte for woman kinde. But, to supplie that wante, shee gaue her suche a face: Which makes the boulde, the fierce, the swifte, to stoope, and pleade for grace. Qui me alit me extinguit. Even as waxe dothe feede, and quenche the flame, So, loue giues life; and loue, dispaire doth giue: The godlie loue, doth louers croune with fame: The wicked loue, in shame dothe make them liue. Then leaue to loue, or loue as reason will, For, louers lewde doe vainlie languishe still. Scribit in marmore læsus. In marble harde our harmes wee alwayes graue, Bicause, wee still will beare the same in minde: In duste wee write the benifittes wee haue, Where they are soone defaced with the winde. So, wronges wee houlde, and neuer will forgiue, And soone forget, that still with vs shoulde liue. Nec sibi, nec alteri. To Aphilus. A Snarlinge curre, did in the manger lie, Who rather steru'd? then made the haye, his meate, Yet shew'd his fanges, and offred for to flie Vppon the oxe, who hungred for to eate. And there throughe spite, did keepe the oxe from foode: Vntill for wante, hee faynted as hee stoode. The couetous man enuious, here behoulde, Who hath inowghe, yet vse thereof doth lacke: And doth enuie his needie neighbour, shoulde But get a groate, if he coulde houlde it backe? Who, thoughe they doe possesse the diuill, and all? Yet are they like the dogge, in oxes stall? Scripta non temerè edenda. Ad doctiss. virum D. St. Bvllvm. Lo, here Qvinctilivs sittes, a graue and reuerende sire: And pulles a younglinge by the arme, that did for fame desire. For, hee with pace of snayle, proceeded to his pen; Lest haste shoulde make him wishe (too late) it weare to write againe. And therfore still with care, woulde euerie thinge amende: Yea, ofte eche worde, and line suruaye, before hee made an ende. And, yf he any sawe, whose care to wryte was small: To him, like wordes to these hee vs'd, which hee did meane to all. My sonne, what worke thou writes, correcte, reforme, amende, But if thou like thy first assaye, then not Qvinctilivs frende? The fruicte at firste is sower, till time giue pleasante taste: And verie rare is that attempte, that is not harm'd with haste. Perfection comes in time, and forme and fashion giues: And euer rashenes, yeeldes repente, and most dispised liues. Then, alter ofte, and chaunge, peruse, and reade, and marke: The man that softlie settes his steppes, goes safest in the darke. But if that thirst of fame, doe pricke thee forthe too faste: Thou shalt (when it is all to late) repente therefore at laste. Orphei Musica. Ad eundem. Lo, Orphevs with his harpe, that sauage kinde did tame: The Lions fierce, and Leopardes wilde, and birdes about him came. For, with his musicke sweete, their natures hee subdu'de: But if wee thinke his playe so wroughte, our selues wee doe delude. For why? besides his skill, hee learned was, and wise: And coulde with sweetenes of his tonge, all sortes of men suffice. And those that weare most rude, and knewe no good at all: And weare of fierce, and cruell mindes, the worlde did brutishe call. Yet with persuasions founde, hee made their hartes relente, That meeke, and milde they did become, and followed where he wente. Lo these, the Lions fierce, these,Beares, and Tigers weare: The trees, and rockes, that lefte their roomes, his musicke for to heare. But, you are happie most, who in suche place doe staye: You neede not Thracia seeke, to heare some impe of Orphevs playe. Since, that so neare your home, Apollos darlinge dwelles; Who Linvs, &amp; Amphion staynes, and Orphevs farre excelles. For hartes, like marble harde, his harmonie dothe pierce: And makes them yeelding passions feele, that are by nature fierce. But, if his musicke faile: his curtesie is suche, That none so rude, and base of minde, but hee reclaimes them muche. Nowe since you, by deserte, for both, commended are: I choose you, for a Iudge herein, if truthe I doe declare. And if you finde I doe, then ofte therefore reioyce: And thinke, I woulde suche neighbour haue, if I might make my choice. In statuam Baccht. The timelie birthe that Semele did beare, See heere, in time howe monstêrous he grewe: With drinkinge muche, and dailie bellie cheare, His eies weare dimme, and fierie was his hue: His cuppe, still full: his head, with grapes was croun'de; Thus time he spent with pipe, and tabret sounde. Which carpes all those, that loue to much the canne, And dothe describe theire personage, and theire guise: For like a beaste, this doth transforme a man, And makes him speake that moste in secret lies; Then, shunne the sorte that bragge of drinking muche, Seeke other frendes, and ioyne not handes with suche. Iunge tibi socios pulchræ virtutis amore, Nam Venere &amp; Baccho iuncta repentè cadunt. Iohan. Samb. in Epigr. Vino forma perit, vino corrumpitur ætas, Vino sæpè suum nescit amica virum? Propertius. Cæcus amor prolis. With kindenes, lo, the Ape doth kill her whelpe, Throughe clasping harde, and lulling in her armes. Euen so, the babes, whose nature, Arte shoulde helpe: The parents fonde doe hazarde them with harmes, And worke their spoile, and bringe them vnto naughte, When foolishe loue forbiddes them to bee taughte. Admirata putat formosum Simia fœtum: Nempe solet pulchrum cuique placere suum. Nic. Reusnerus. Maturandum. Abovte the arrowe swifte, Echeneis slowe doth foulde: Which, biddes vs in our actions haste, no more then reason woulde. In sinu alere serpentem. Ad Doctiss. V. D. Franciscvm Raphelengivm in obsidione Antwerpiana periclitantem. Thovghe, cittie stronge the cannons shotte dispise, And deadlie foes, beseege the same in vaine: Yet, in the walles if pining famine rise, Or else some impe of Sinon, there remaine. What can preuaile your bulwarkes? and your towers, When, all your force, your inwarde foe deuoures. In desciscentes. When that with milke, the goate had fil'd the pot, Shee brake the same, that all about it ranne. Wherat, the maide her pacience quite forgot, And in a rage, the brutishe beaste did banne? Which toye, thoughe shorte, yet sharply reprehendes Beginnings good, that haue vnhappie endes. Stultorum quantò status sublimior, tantò manifestior turpitudo. Promoote the foole, his folly doth appeare, And is a shame to them, that make him clime: Whose faultes, before coulde not bee seene so cleare, For lowe estate did shadowe euery crime: But set him vp, his folly soone is harde, Then keepe him doune, let wise men bee prefer'de. Bis dat qui citò dat. Doe not thine almes deferre, when neede doth bid thee haste: For why, one gifte is double thought, that in due time is plaste. Or so. When to the pore thou giu'st, make speede the same to doe: Bycause one gifte in time bestowed, is worthe some other two. Spes vana. The eager haulke, with sodaine sighte of lure Doth stoope, in hope to haue her wished praye: So, manie men do stoope to sightes vnsure: And curteous speeche, dothe keepe them at the baye, Let suche beware, lest frendlie lookes be like, The lure, to which the soaring haulke did strike? Audi, tace, fuge. To my Nephew Ro. Borron. Heare much; but little speake; and flee from that is naught: Which lessons, by these formes in briefe, to euery one are taught. Importunitas euitanda. Who that with force, his burnish'd blade doth trie On anuill harde, to prooue if it be sure: Doth Hazarde muche, it shoulde in peeces flie, Aduentring that, which else mighte well indure: For, there with strengthe he strikes vppon the stithe, That men maye knowe, his youthfull armes haue pithe. Which warneth those, that louinge frendes inioye, With care, to keepe, and frendlie them to treate, And not to trye them still, with euerie toye, Nor presse them doune, when causes be too greate, Nor in requests importunate to bee: For ouermuche, dothe tier the courser free? Strenuorum immortale nomen. To the honorable Gentleman, Sir William Rvssell Knight. Achilles tombe vpon Sigæa shore, This representes: where Thetis ofte was seene: And for his losse, did seeme for to deplore, With gallant flower the same was alwaies greene: And at the toppe, a palme did freshelie bloome; Whose braunches sweete did ouerspread the toombe. Which shewes, thoughe deathe the valiaunt ouerthrowe, Yet after fate, their fame remaines behinde: And triumphes still, and dothe no conquest knowe, But is the badge of euerie noble minde: And when in graue their corpes inclosed lye, Their famous actes doe pierce the azure skye. Nunquam Stygias fertur ad vinbras Inclyta virtus: viuite fortes Nec Lethæos sæua per amnes Vos fata trahent: sed cum summas Exiget auras consumpta dies, Iter ad fuperos gloria pandet. Sen. Her. Fur. Oet. act. 5. Vel post mortem formidolosi. To the honorable Sir Iohn Norris Knight, Lord president of Munster in Irelande, and Colonell Generall of the Englishe Infanterie, in the lowe countries. A secret cause, that none can comprehende, In natures workes is often to bee seene; As, deathe can not the ancient discorde ende, That raigneth still, the wolfe, and sheepe betweene: The like, beside in many thinges are knowne, The cause reueal'd, to none, but God alone. For, as the wolfe, the sillye sheepe did feare, And made him still to tremble, at his barke: So beinge dead, which is moste straunge to heare, This feare remaynes, as learned men did marke; For with their skinnes, if that two drommes bee bounde, That, clad with sheepe, doth iarre: and hathe no sounde. And, if that stringes bee of their intrailes wroughte, And ioyned both, to make a siluer sounde: No cunninge eare can tune them as they oughte, But one is harde, the other still is droun'de: Or discordes foule, the harmonie doe marre; And nothinge can appease this inward warre. So, Zisca thoughte when deathe did shorte his daies, As with his voice, hee erste did daunte his foes; That after deathe hee shoulde newe terror raise, And make them flee, as when they felte his bloes. Wherefore, hee charg'd that they his skinne shoulde frame, To fitte a dromme, and marche forth with the same. So, Hectors sighte greate feare in Greekes did worke, When hee was showed on horsebacke, beeinge dead: Hvniades, the terrour of the Turke, Thoughe layed in graue, yet at his name they fled: And cryinge babes, they ceased with the same, The like in France, sometime did Talbots name. Victoria cruenta. To Sir William Standley Knight. The Olephante with stinge of serpent fell, That still about his legges, with winding cralles: Throughe poison stronge, his bodie so did swell, That doune he sinkes, and on the serpente falles: Which creature huge, did fall vppon him soe, That by his deathe, he also kill'd his foe. Those sharpe conflictes, those broiles and battailes maine, That are atchieude, with spoile on either parte: Where streames of blood the hilles, and valleys staine, And what is wonne, the price is deathe, and smarte: This dothe importe: But those are captaines good, That winne the fielde, with sheddinge leaste of blood. Pennæ gloria perennis. To Edwarde Dier Esquier. When frowning fatall dame, that stoppes our course in fine, The thred of noble Svrreys life, made hast for to vntwine. Apollo chang'd his cheare, and lay'd awaie his lute, And Pallas, and the Muses sad, did weare a mourninge sute. And then, the goulden pen, in case of sables cladde, Was lock'd in chiste of Ebonie, and to Parnassus had. But, as all times do chaunge, so passions haue their space; And cloudie skies at lengthe are clear'd, with Phœbus chearefull face. For, when that barren verse made Muses voide of mirthe: Behoulde, Lvsina sweetelie sounge, of Sidneys ioyfull birthe. Whome mightie Iove did blesse, with graces from aboue: On whome, did fortune frendlie smile, and nature most did loue. And then, behoulde, the pen, was by Mercvrivs sente, Wherewith, hee also gaue to him, the gifte for to inuente. That, when hee first began, his vayne in verse to showe. More sweete then honie, was the stile, that from his penne did flowe. Wherewith, in youthe hee vs'd to bannishe idle fittes; That nowe, his workes of endlesse fame, delighte the worthie wittes. No haulting verse hee writes, but matcheth former times, No Cherillus, he can abide, nor Poëttes patched rimes. What volumes hath hee writte, that rest among his frendes, Which needes no other praise at all, eche worke it selfe comendes. So, that hee famous liues, at home, and farre, and neare; For those that liue in other landes, of Sidneys giftes doe heare. And suche as Muses serue, in darkenes meere doe dwell; If that they haue not seene his workes, they doe so farre excell. Wherefore, for to extoll his name in what I might, This Embleme lo, I did present, vnto this woorthie Knight. Who, did the same refuse, as not his proper due: And at the first, his sentence was, it did belonge to you. Wherefore, lo, fame with trompe, that mountes vnto the skye: And, farre aboue the highest spire, from pole, to pole dothe flye. Heere houereth at your will, with pen adorn'd with baies: Which for you bothe, shee hath prepar'd, vnto your endlesse praise. The laurell leafe for you, for him, the goulden pen; The honours that the Muses giue, vnto the rarest men. Wherefore, proceede I praye, vnto your lasting fame; For writinges last when wee bee gonne, and doe preserue our name. And whilst wee tarrye heere, no treasure can procure, The palme that waites vpon the pen, which euer doth indure. Two thousand yeares, and more, Homervs wrat his booke; And yet, the same doth still remayne, and keepes his former looke. Wheare Ægypte spires bee gonne, and Rome doth ruine feele, Yet, both begonne since he was borne, thus time doth turne the wheele. Yea, thoughe some Monarche greate some worke should take in hand, Of marble, or of Adamant, that manie worldes shoulde stande, Yet, should one only man, with labour of the braine, Bequeathe the world a monument, that longer shoulde remaine. And when that marble waules, with force of time should waste; It should indure from age, to age, and yet no age should taste. Oh happie you therfore, who spend your blessed daies In seruing God, your Prince, your lande, vnto your endlesse praise. And daily doe proceede, with trauaile of the minde, To make you famous heere, and eeke, to leaue a fame behinde. Which is the cheefest thinge, the greatest Prince can haue, For, fame doth triumphe ouer deathe, when corpes are clos'd in graue. Euen so, your worthie workes, when you in peace shall sleepe, Shall make reporte of your desertes, and Diers name shall keepe. Whome, I doe reuerence still, as one of Pallas peares: And praye the Lorde, with ioyfull dayes for to prolonge your yeares. Animus, non res. To Edward Paston Esquier. In christall towers, and turrets richlie sette With glittering gemmes, that shine against the sonne: In regall roomes of Iasper, and of Iette, Contente of minde, not alwaies likes to wonne: But oftentimes, it pleaseth her to staye In simple cotes, clos'de in with walles of claye. Diogenes, within a tonne did dwell, No choice of place, nor store of pelfe he had; And all his goodes, coulde Bias beare right well, And Codrvs had small cates, his harte to gladde: His meate was rootes: his table, was a stoole, Yet these for witte, did set the worlde to scoole? Who couettes still, or hee that liues in feare, As much delighte is wealthe vnto his minde, As musicke is to him, that can not heare, Or pleasante showes, and pictures, to the blinde: Then sweete content, ofte likes the meane estate, Which is exempte, and free, from feare, and hate. What man is ritche? not he that doth abounde. What man is pore? not hee that hath no store. But he is ritche, that makes content his grounde. And he is pore, that couettes more and more. Which proues: the man was ritcher in the tonne, Then was the Kinge, that manie landes had wonne. If then, content the chiefest riches bee, And greedie gripes, that doe abounde be pore, Since that, inoughe allotted is to thee, Embrace content, then Cæsar hath no more. Giue Midas, goulde: and let him pine with shame. Vse you, your goodes, to liue, and die, with fame. Quæ sequimur fugimus. To Thomas Wilbraham Esquier. Wee flee, from that wee seeke; &amp; followe, that wee leaue: And, whilst wee thinke our webbe to skante, &amp; larger still would weaue, Lo, Time dothe cut vs of, amid our carke: and care. Which warneth all, that haue enoughe, and not contented are. For to inioye their goodes, their howses, and their landes: Bicause the Lorde vnto that end, commits them to their handes. Yet, those whose greedie mindes: enoughe, doe thinke too small: Whilst that with care they seeke for more, oft times are reu'd of all, Wherefore all such (I wishe) that spare, where is no neede: To vse their goodes whilst that they may, for time apace doth speede. And since, by proofe I knowe, you hourde not vp your store; Whose gate, is open to your frende: and purce, vnto the pore: And spend vnto your praise, what God dothe largely lende: I chiefly made my choice of this, which I to you commende. In hope, all those that see your name, aboue the head: Will at your lampe, their owne come light, within your steppes to tread. Whose daily studie is, your countrie to adorne: And for to keepe a worthie house, in place where you weare borne. Patria cuique chara. To Richarde Cotton Esquier. The bees at lengthe retourne into their hiue, When they haue suck'd the sweete of Floras bloomes; And with one minde their worke they doe contriue, And laden come with honie to their roomes: A worke of arte; and yet no arte of man, Can worke, this worke; these little creatures can. The maister bee, within the midst dothe liue, In fairest roome, and most of stature is; And euerie one to him dothe reuerence giue, And in the hiue with him doe liue in blisse: Hee hath no stinge, yet none can doe him harme, For with their strengthe, the rest about him swarme. Lo, natures force within these creatures small, Some, all the daye the honie home doe beare. And some, farre off on flowers freshe doe fall, Yet all at nighte vnto their home repaire: And euerie one, her proper hiue doth knowe, Althoughe there stande a thousande on a rowe. A Comon-wealthe, by this, is right expreste: Bothe him, that rules, and those, that doe obaye: Or suche, as are the heads aboue the rest, Whome here, the Lorde in highe estate dothe staye: By whose supporte, the meaner sorte doe liue, And vnto them all reuerence dulie giue. Which when I waied: I call'd vnto my minde Your Cvmbermaire, that fame so farre commendes: A stately seate, whose like is harde to finde, Where mightie Iove the horne of plentie lendes: With fishe, and foule, and cattaile sondrie flockes, Where christall springes doe gushe out of the rockes. There, fertile fieldes; there, meadowes large extende: There, store of grayne: with water, and with wood. And, in this place, your goulden time you spende, Vnto your praise, and to your countries good: This is the hiue; your tennaunts, are the bees: And in the same, haue places by degrees. And as the bees, that farre and neare doe straye, And yet come home, when honie they haue founde: So, thoughe some men doe linger longe awaye, Yet loue they best their natiue countries grounde. And from the same, the more they absent bee, With more desire, they wishe the same to see. Euen so my selfe; throughe absence manie a yeare, A straunger meere, where I did spend my prime. Nowe, parentes loue dothe hale mee by the eare, And sayeth, come home, deferre no longer time: Wherefore, when happe, some goulden honie bringes? I will retorne, and rest my wearie winges. Quid melius Roma? Scythico quid frigore peius? Huc tamen ex illa barbarus vrbe fugit. Ouid. 1. Pont. 4. Aureæ compedes. To G. M. Esquier. It better is (wee say) a cotage poore to houlde, Then for to lye in prison stronge, with fetters made of goulde. Which shewes, that bondage is the prison of the minde: And libertie the happie life, that is to man assign'de. And thoughe that some preferre their bondage, for their gaines: And richely are adorn'd in silkes, and preste with massie chaines. Yet manie others liue, that are accompted wise: Who libertie doe chiefely choose, thoughe clad in gounes of frise, And waighe not Pompeys porte, nor yet Lvcvllvs fate: So that they may adorne their mindes, they well contented are. Yea, rather doe accepte his dwelling in the tonne, And for to liue with Codrvs cates: a roote, and barly bonne. Where freedome they inioye, and vncontrolled liue: Then with the chiefest fare of all, attendance for to geue. And, if I should bee ask'd, which life doth please mee beste: I like the goulden libertie, let goulden bondage reste. Auxilio diuino. To Richard Drake Esquier, in praise of Sir Francis Drake Knight. Throvghe scorchinge heate, throughe coulde, in stormes, and tempests force, By ragged rocks, by shelfes, &amp; sandes: this Knighte did keepe his course. By gapinge gulses hee pass'd, by monsters of the flood; By pirattes, theeues, and cruell foes, that long'd to spill his blood. That wonder greate to scape: but, God was on his side, And throughe them all, in spite of all, his shaken shippe did guide. And, to requite his paines: By helpe of power deuine. His happe, at lengthe did aunswere hope, to finde the goulden mine. Let Græcia then forbeare, to praise her Iason boulde? Who throughe the watchfull dragons pass'd, to win the fleece of goulde. Since by Medeas helpe, they weare inchaunted all, And Iason without perrilles, pass'de: the conqueste therfore small? But, hee, of whome I write, this noble minded Drake, Did bringe away his goulden fleece, when thousand eies did wake. Wherefore, yee woorthie wightes, that seeke for forreine landes: Yf that you can, come alwaise home, by Ganges goulden sandes. And you, that liue at home, and can not brooke the flood, Geue praise to them, that passe the waues, to doe their countrie good. Before which sorte, as chiefe: in tempeste, and in calme, Sir Francis Drake, by due deserte, may weare the goulden palme. Auaritia huius sæculi. To Arthvre Bovrchier Esquier. With double dore this Pallace loe, doth ope; The one, vnto the gallant roomes doth shewe, Whereas the ritche with goulden giftes haue scope; The other, to an emptie benche doth goe, And there, the pore haue leaue for to resorte, But not presume vnto the other porte. For, alwaies that is shutte vnto the pore, But ope to them, that haue the mines of goulde: Then, thoughe the worlde of Poëttes haue no store, No maruaile tho, sith bountie is so coulde; For, if there did Mecoenas giftes abounde, Newe Horace soone, &amp; Virgil should be founde. Ingenium sacri miraris abesse Maronis, Nec quenquam tanta bella sonare tuba: Sint Mæcenates, non deerunt Flacce, Marones; Virgilium? tibi vel tua rura dabunt. Martial. lib. 8. Epig. 55. ad Flaccum. Pulchritudo sine fructu. To Arthvre Starkey Esquier. The Cipresse tree is pleasinge to the sighte, Straighte, tall, and greene, and sweete vnto the smell: Yet, yeeldes no fruicte vnto the trauaylinge wighte, But naughte, and bad, experience dothe vs tell: Where, other trees that make not suche a showe, Yeelde pleasante fruicte, and plentifullie growe. This gallante tree that good, and fruictfull seemes, In couerte sorte, a kinde of men doth checke: Whose curtesie, no man but much esteemes, Who promise muche, and faune about our necke. But if wee trie, their deedes wee barren finde, Or yeelde but fruicte, like to the Cipresse kinde. Pulchra coma est, pulchro digestæ? ordine frondes; Sed fructus nullos hæc coma pulchra gerit. Alciatus. Tempore cuncta mitiora. Iano Dovsæ, nobiliss. viri, Dn. Iani Dovsæ à Noortwijck, F. The grapes not ripe, the trauailinge man doth waste, And vnder foote doth treade, as sower, and naughte: Which, being ripe, had sweete, and pleasaunte taste Whereby, wee maie this lesson true be taughte. Howe simple men, doe simplie iudge of thinges. And doe not waighe that time perfection bringes. For in this worlde, the thinges most faire, and rare, Are harde at firste, and seeme both harshe, and sower: But yet in time, they sweete and easie are, Then staie for time, which giues both fruite and flower: And vse our time, and let vs still suppose No greater losse, then time that wee doe lose. Nam mora dat vires, teneras mora percoquit vuas, Et validas segetes, quod fuit herba facit. Ouid. 1. Remed. Imparilitas. To M. William Harebrowne, at Constantinople. The faulcon mountes alofte vnto the skie, And ouer hilles, and dales, dothe make her flighte; The duckes, and geese, about the house doe flie, And in eche diche, and muddie lake doe lighte, They seeke their foode in puddles, and in pittes, While that alofte, the princelie faulcon sittes. Suche difference is in men, as maye appeare; Some, throughe the worlde doe passe by lande, and sea: And by deserte are famous farre, and neare, So, all their life at home, some others staie: And nothinge can to trauaile them prouoke, Beyonde the smell of natiue countries smoke. In sublime volans tenuem secat aëra falco: Sed pascuntur humi graculus, auser, anas. Alciatus. Tunc tua res agitur, paries cum proximus ardet. To M. Thomas Wheteley. Awake from sleepe secure, when perrill doth appeare: No wisedome then to take our ease, and not the worst to feare. Still Archimedes wroughte, when foes had wonne the towne, And woulde not leaue his worke in hande, till he was beaten downe. No suretie is within, when roofe alofte doth flame: It is a madnes then to staye, till wee haue donne our game. Yea, those that helpe deferre, when neighbours house doth burne: Are like with griefe, to see their owne, with speede to cinders turne. Then, cut of all delaies when daungers are begonne, For if beginnings wee withstande, the conquest sooner wonne. Temporis officium est solatia dicere certi, Dum dolor in cursu est, dum petit æger opem. Ouid. 4. Pont. 11. Ex morbo medicina. To W. Ro. When that Opimivs ritche, had scraped manie a pounde; And fil'd his baggs, &amp; cofers full, that wealthe did most abounde. Yet liu'd hee still in awe, as if it weare offence To ope his purce, for any neede; hee spared so his pence. At lengthe, this greedie carle the Lythergie posseste: That vnneth hee could stere a foote, with sleepe so sore oppreste. And languishinge therein, not like for to escape: His heire, was ioyfull of that sighte, who for his goodes did gape. But, when that nothinge coulde Opimivs sleeping let, The quicke Phisition did commaunde, that tables shoulde bee set About the misers bed, and budgettes forthe to bringe, And poure the goulde vppon the bourde, that hee mighte heare it ringe. And bad the heire to tell, and all the standers bye: With that, hee to the sicke man call'de, what meane you thus to lye? And will not haue regarde your treasure to preserue: Behoulde your heire, and all the reste, howe largely nowe they carue? With that, hee started vp; halfe dead, and halfe a liue; And staringe on his heapes of goulde, longe time for life did striue. So that, when nothinge coulde his drousie eies awake, Such vertue, had the sighte of goulde, that sleepe did him forsake. Which showées, when dreadfull deathe presentes the lastinge sleepe: They hardly can departe in peace, whose goulde is rooted deepe. Effigiem Rex. Crœse tu? ditissime Regum Vidit apud Manes, Diogenes Cynicus. C?stitit vt? procul solito maiore cachinno Concussus, dixit. quid tibi dinitiæ Nunc prosunt Regum Rex ô ditissime, tum sis Sicut ego solus, me quoque pauperior? N? quæcunq. habui, mec? fero cum nihil ipse Ex tantis tecum Crœse feras opibus. Auson. Epig. 55. Fraus meretur fraudem. The Lion oulde that coulde not get his praye, By swifte pursute, as he had done of late: Did faigne him sicke, and in his denne did staye, And præde on those, that came to see his state: At lengthe, the foxe his dutie to declare, Came to the dore, to knowe howe he did fare. Who answered, sicke, my oulde beloued frende? Come in, and see, and feele my pulses beate: To whome, quoth he, I dare not now intende, Bicause, these steppes some secret mischiefe threate: For, all I see haue gone into thy denne, But none I finde, that haue retorn'd againe. Zelotypia. A sicknes sore, that dothe in secret wounde, And gripes the harte, thoughe outward nothing showe; The force whereof, the paciente doth confounde, That oftentimes, dispaire therof doth growe: And Ielousie, this sicknes hathe to name, An hellishe paine, that firste from Plvto came. Which passion straunge, is alwaies beauties foe, And moste of all, the married sorte enuies: Oh happie they, that liue in wedlocke soe, That in their brestes this furie neuer rise: For, when it once doth harbour in the hatte, It soiournes still, and doth too late departe. Lo Procris heare, when wounded therwithall, Did breede her bane, who mighte haue bath'de in blisse: This corsie sharpe so fedde vppon her gall, That all to late shee mourn'd, for her amisse: For, whilst shee watch'd her husbandes waies to knowe, Shee vnawares, was præye vnto his bowé. Medici Jcon. Ad ornatiss. viros D. Ioannem Iames, &amp; Lancelottvm Browne Medicos celeberrimos. This portrature, dothe Æscvlapivs tell. The laurell crowne, the fame of phisike showes. The bearde, declares his longe experience well: And grauitie therewith that alwaie goes. The scepter, tells he ruleth like a kinge Amongst the sicke; commaunding euerie thinge. The knotted staffe, declares the crabbed skill Moste harde t'attaine; that doth supporte his state: His sittinge, shewes he must be setled still, With constant minde, and rashe proceedinge hate: The Dragon, tells he doth our age renewe, And soone decerne, to giue the sicke his dewe. The cocke, dothe teache his watchinge, and his care, To visite ofte his pacientes, in their paine: The couchinge dogge, dothe laste of all declare, That faithfulnes, and loue, shoulde still remaine: Within their brestes, that Phisike doe professe. Which partes, they all shoulde in their deedes expresse. Inanis impetus. Clariss, omni? doctrinæ &amp; virtutis laude ornatissimo viro D. Ivsto Lipsio. By shininge lighte, of wannishe Cynthias raies, The dogge behouldes his shaddowe to appeare: Wherefore, in vaine aloude he barkes, and baies, And alwaies thoughte, an other dogge was there: But yet the Moone, who did not heare his queste, Hir woonted course, did keepe vnto the weste. This reprehendes, those fooles which baule, and barke, At learned men, that shine aboue the reste: With due regarde, that they their deedes should marke, And reuerence them, that are with wisedome bleste: But if they striue, in vaine their winde they spende, For woorthie men, the Lorde doth still defende. Esse quid hoc dicam, viuis quod fama negatur, Et sua quod rarus tempora lector amat? Hi sunt inuidiæ nimirum Regule mores; Præferat antiquos semper vt illa nouis. Martial. lib. 5. ad Regulum. In diuitem, indoctum. On goulden fleece, did Phryxus passe the waue, And landed safe, within the wished baie: By which is ment, the fooles that riches haue, Supported are, and borne throughe Lande, and Sea: And those enrich'de by wife, or seruauntes goodds, Are borne by them like Phryxus through the floodds. An other of the like argument. To M. I. E. A leaden sworde, within a goulden sheathe, Is like a foole of natures finest moulde: To whome, shee did her rarest giftes bequethe. Or like a sheepe, within a fleece of goulde. Or like a clothe, whome colours braue adorne, When as the grounde, is patched, rente, and torne. For, if the minde the chiefest treasures lacke, Thoughe nature bothe, and fortune, bee our frende; Thoughe goulde wee weare, and purple on our backe, Yet are wee poore, and none will vs comende But onlie fooles; and flatterers, for theire gaine: For other men, will ride vs with disdaine. Interminabilis humanæ vitæ labor. To M. Iohn Gostlinge. Loe Sisyphvs, that roles the restlesse stone To toppe of hill, with endlesse toile, and paine: Which beinge there, it tumbleth doune alone, And then, the wretche must force it vp againe: And as it falles, he makes it still ascende; And yet, no toile can bringe this worke to ende. This Sisyphvs: presenteth Adams race. The restlesse stone: their trauaile, and their toile: The hill, dothe shewe the daye, and eeke the space, Wherein they still doe labour, worke, and moile. And thoughe till nighte they striue the hill to clime, Yet vp againe, the morning nexte betime. Vita humana propriè vti ferrum est: Ferrum si exerceas, conteritur: si non exerceas, tamen rubigo interficit. Item homines exercendo videmus conteri. Si nihil exerceas, inertia atque torpedo plus detrimenti facit, quàm exercitatio. Aul. Gell. lib. 11. ca. 2. Qui se exaltat, humiliabitur. The boylinge brothe, aboue the brinke dothe swell, And comes to naughte, with falling in the fire: So reaching heads that thinke them neuer well, Doe headlonge fall, for pride hathe ofte that hire: And where before their frendes they did dispise, Nowe beinge falne, none helpe them for to rise. Sol non occidat super iracundiam vestram. Caste swordes awaye, take laurell in your handes, Let not the Sonne goe downe vppon your ire. Let hartes relente, and breake oulde rancors bandes, And frendshippes force subdue your rashe desire. Let desperate wightes, and ruffians, thirst for blood; Winne foes, with loue; and thinke your conquest good. Omnis caro fœnum. To M. Elcocke Preacher. All fleshe, is grasse; and withereth like the haie: To daie, man laughes, to morrowe, lies in claie. Then, let him marke the frailtie of his kinde, For here his tearme is like a puffe of winde, Like bubbles smalle, that on the waters rise: Or like the flowers, whome Flora freshlie dies. Yet, in one daie their glorie all is gone: So, worldlie pompe, which here we gaze vppon. Which warneth all, that here their pageantes plaie, Howe, well to liue: but not how longe to waie. Inter spem curam?, timores inter &amp; iras, Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum. Grata superueniet, quæ non sperabitur, hora. Horat. 1. Epist. 4 Peruersa iudicia. Presvmptvovs Pan, did striue Apollos skill to passe: But Midas gaue the palme to Pan: wherefore the eares of asse Apollo gaue the Iudge: which doth all Iudges teache; To iudge with knowledge, and aduise, in matters paste their reache? Mulier vmbra viri. Ovr shadowe flies, if wee the same pursue: But if wee flie, it followeth at the heele. So, he throughe loue that moste dothe serue, and sue, Is furthest off his mistresse harte is steele. But if hee flie, and turne awaie his face; Shee followeth straight, and grones to him for grace. In amore tormentum. Even as the gnattes, that flie into the blaze, Doe burne their winges and fall into the fire: So, those too muche on gallant showes that gaze, Are captiues caught, and burne in their desire: And suche as once doe feele this inwarde warre, Thoughe they bee cur'de, yet still appeares the scarre. For wanton Love althoughe hee promise ioies, Yet hee that yeeldes in hope to finde it true, His pleasures shalbee mated with annoyes; And sweetes suppos'de, bee mix'd, with bitter rue: Bicause, his dartes not all alike, doe wounde: For so the frendes of coye Aspasia founde. They lou'd, shee loth'de: they crau'd, shee still deni'de. They sigh'd, shee songe: they spake, shee stopt her eare They walk'd, shee satte: they set, awaye shee hi'de. Lo this their bale, which was her blisse, you heare. O loue, a plague, thoughe grac'd with gallant glosse, For in thy seates a snake is in the mosse. Then stoppe your eares, and like Vlisses waulke, The Syreenes tunes, the carelesse often heares: Crocvta killes when shee doth frendly taulke: The Crocodile, hathe treason in her teares. In gallant fruicte, the core is ofte decay'd; Yea poison ofte in cuppe of goulde assay'd. Then, in your waies let reason strike the stroke, Aspasia shonne, althoughe her face doe shine: But, if you like of Hymenævs yoke, Penelope preferre, thoughe spinninge twine, Yet if you like, how most to liue in rest, Hippolytvs his life, suppose the best. Vincit qui patitur. The mightie oke, that shrinkes not with a blaste, But stiflie standes, when Boreas moste doth blowe, With rage thereof, is broken downe at laste, When bending reedes, that couche in tempestes lowe With yeelding still, doe safe, and sounde appeare: And looke alofte, when that the cloudes be cleare. When Enuie, Hate, Contempte, and Slaunder, rage: Which are the stormes, and tempestes, of this life; With patience then, wee must the combat wage, And not with force resist their deadlie strife: But suffer still, and then wee shall in fine, Our foes subdue, when they with shame shall pine. Aculei irriti. Where as the good, do liue amongst the bad: And vertue growes, where seede of vices springes: The wicked sorte to wounde the good, are glad: And vices thrust at vertue, all their stinges: The like, where witte, and learning doe remaine, Where follie rules, and ignoraunce doth raigne. Yet as wee see, the lillie freshlie bloomes, Though thornes, and briers, enclose it round aboute: So with the good, thoughe wicked haue their roomes, They are preseru'd, in spite of all their route: And learning liues, and vertue still doth shine, When follie dies, and ignoraunce doth pine. Neglecta virescunt. To M. Rawlins Preacher. The Iuie greene that dothe dispised growe, And none doth plante, or trimme the same at all, Althoughe a while it spreades it selfe belowe, In time it mountes, with creepinge vp the wall. So, thoughe the worlde the vertuous men dispise, Yet vp alofte in spite of them they rise. Impunitas ferociæ parens. To M. Steevenson Preacher. When worthie men, for life, and learninge greate, Who with their lookes, the wicked did appall, If frouninge fates, with persecution threate; Or take them hence, or shut them vp in thrall: The wicked sorte reioice, and plaie their partes, Thoughe longe before, they clok'd their fained hartes. Nemo potest duobus dominis seruire. To M. Knewstvb Preacher. Here, man who first should heauenlie thinges attaine, And then, to world his sences should incline: First, vndergoes the worlde with might, and maine, And then, at foote doth drawe the lawes deuine. Thus God hee beares, and Mammon in his minde: But Mammon first, and God doth come behinde. Oh worldlinges fonde, that ioyne these two so ill, The league is nought, throwe doune the world vhich speede: Take vp the lawe, according to his will. First seeke for heauen, and then for wordly neede. But those that first their wordlie wishe doe serue, Their gaine, is losse, and seeke their soules to sterue. Sic probantur. To M. Andrewes Preacher. Throvghe tormentes straunge, and persecutions dire, The Christians passe, with pacience in their paine: And ende their course, sometime with sworde, and fire, And constant stand, and like to lambes are slaine. Bycause, when all their martirdome is past, They hope to gaine a glorious croune at last. Noli tuba canere Eleemosynam. When that thou giu'st thy almes vnto the pore, In secret giue, for God thy giftes doth see: And openlie, will thee rewarde therfore. But, if with trompe thy almes must publish'd bee, Thou giu'st in vaine: sith thou therby dost showe, Thy chiefe desire is, that the world maie knowe. Superest quod suprà est. Adve deceiptfull worlde, thy pleasures I detest: Nowe, others with thy showes delude; my hope in heauen doth rest. Inlarged as followeth. Even as a flower, or like vnto the grasse, Which now dothe stande, and straight with sithe dothe fall; So is our state: now here, now hence wee passe: For, time attendes with shredding sithe for all. And deathe at lengthe, both oulde, and yonge, doth strike: And into dust dothe turne vs all alike. Yet, if wee marke how swifte our race dothe ronne, And waighe the cause, why wee created bee: Then shall wee know, when that this life is donne, Wee shall bee sure our countrie right to see. For, here wee are but straungers, that must flitte: The nearer home, the nearer to the pitte. O happie they, that pondering this arighte, Before that here their pilgrimage bee past, Resigne this worlde: and marche with all their mighte Within that pathe, that leades where ioyes shall last. And whilst they maye, there, treasure vp their store, Where, without rust, it lastes for euermore. This worlde must chaunge: That worlde, shall still indure. Here, pleasures fade: There, shall they endlesse bee. Here, man doth sinne: And there, hee shalbee pure Here, deathe hee tastes: And there, shall neuer die. Here, hathe hee griefe: And there shall ioyes possesse, As none hath seene, nor anie harte can gesse. Amico ficto nulla fit iniuria. Since fauninge lookes, and sugred speache preuaile, Take heede betime: and linke thee not with theise. The gallant clokes, doe hollowe hartes conceile, And goodlie showes, are mistes before our eies: But whome thou find'st with guile, disguised so: No wronge thou doest, to vse him as thy foe. Ferè simile, in Hypocritas. A face deform'de, a visor faire dothe hide, That none can see his vglie shape within; To Ipocrites, the same maie bee applide, With outward showes, who all their credit winne: Yet giue no heate, but like a painted fire; And, all their zeale, is: as the times require. Sic ætas fugit. To M. Iames Ionson. Two horses free, a thirde doe swiftlie chace, The one, is white, the other, blacke of hewe: None, bridles haue for to restraine their pace, And thus, they bothe, the other still pursue: And, neuer cease continuall course to make, Vntill at lengthe, the first, they ouertake. This formost horse, that ronnes so fast awaye, It is our time; while heere, our race wee ronne: The blacke, and white, presenteth nighte, and daye: Who after hast, vntill the goale bee wonne; And leaue vs not, but followe from our birthe, Vntill wee yeelde, and turne againe to earthe. Labitur occultè, fallit? volatilis ætas, Et celer admissis labitur annus equis. Ouid. 1. Amor. 8. Soli Deo gloria. To M. Howlte Preacher. Here, man with axe doth cut the boughe in twaine, And without him, the axe, coulde nothing doe: Within the toole, there doth no force remaine; But man it is, that mighte doth put thereto: Like to this axe, is man, in all his deeds; Who hath no strength, but what from God proceedes. Then, let him not make vaunt of his desert, Nor bragge thereof, when hee good deedes hath donne: For, it is God that worketh in his harte, And with his grace, to good, doth make him ronne: And of him selfe, hee weake theretoo, doth liue; And God giues power, to whome all glorie giue. Dominus viuit &amp; videt. Behinde a figtree great, him selfe did Adam hide: And thought from God hee there might lurke, &amp; should not bee espide. Oh foole, no corners seeke, thoughe thou a sinner bee; For none but God can thee forgiue, who all thy waies doth see. Ex maximo minimum. Where liuely once, Gods image was expreste, Wherin, sometime was sacred reason plac'de, The head, I meane, that is so ritchly bleste, With sighte, with smell, with hearinge, and with taste. Lo, nowe a skull, both rotten, bare, and drye, A relike meete in charnell house to lye, Conclvsio operis Tempus omnia terminat. Ad Illustrissimum Heroëm D. Robertum Dudlæum, Comitem Leicestriæ, Baronem de Denbighe, &amp;c. Dominum meum vnicè colendum. The longest daye, in time resignes to nighte. The greatest oke, in time to duste doth turne. The Rauen dies, the Egle failes of flighte. The Phœnix rare, in time her selfe doth burne. The princelie stagge at lengthe his race doth ronne. And all must ende, that euer was begonne. Euen so, I, here doe ende this simple booke, And offer it vnto your Lorshippes sighte: Which, if you shall receiue with pleasinge looke, I shall reioyce, and thinke my labour lighte. And pray the Lorde your honour to preserue, Our noble Queene, and countrie long to serue. Finis.</field>
