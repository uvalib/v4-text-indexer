Containing, The manner of Winter and Summer-drowning of Medow and Pasture, by the aduantage of the least, Riuer, Brooke, Fount, or Water-prill adiacent; there-by to make those grounds (especially if they be drye) more Fertile Ten for One. As also a demonstration of a Proiect, for the great benefit of the Commonwealth generally, but of Hereford-shire especially. By Rowland Vavghan, Esquire. Imprinted at London by George Eld. 1610â (4to). A PANEGYRICKE, In the deserued honor of this most profitable worke, and no lesse renowned then much-desired Proiect. I sing of him that is as deere to mee As to the World; to whom both aye are bound; Then briefe, for Bond so long, I cannot be; Vnlesse my Loue were (like my Lines) too round. Proportion doth so please Witte, Will, and Sense, That where it wants, it grieues Sense, Will, and Witte: Then by Proportion of his Excellence, Thus must we shape our praise of Him, and It. When as the Earth all soild in sinne did lye, Th'almighties long-prouokt inraged-HAND Emptied Heau'ns Bottles, it to purifie; And made that Noahs floud. FLVD that mud to countermand. So, for like crimes, of late, we plagu'd haue bin With like The Inundation caused by the boiling vp of the sea in Monmouth and Glamorgan shire, the yeare 1607. O'reflowings, washing all away That lay the Earth vpon, or Earth within, Within the limitts where this Deluge lay! Which Inundations were for Earth vnfit: But hee whose Hand and Head this WORKE compos'd, Shewes how to drowne the Earth to profit it: And beeing Ill, to make it Well-disposd. Some with their Lands, doe oft so sinck them-selues, That they to it, and it to them yeeld nought, But, in the Ocean what doe yeeld the Shelues, Which when they see, they Few Hadlands take pleasure to behold the lands they had. flee, with pensiue thought. But in His Drownings, He makes Lands arise, In grace and goodnesse to the highest pitch; And Meades, and Pastures price he multiples; So, while some lies, He rise doth in the Trenches, by which his workes are effected. Ditch. His royall TRENCH (that all the rest commands) And holds the Sperme of Herbage by a Spring) Infuseth in the wombe of sterile Lands, The Liquid seede that makes them Plenty bring. Here, two of the inferior Elements (Ioyning in CoÃ¯tu) Water on the Leaze (Like Sperme most actiue in such complements) Begets the full-pancht Foison of Increase? For, through Earths rifts into her hollow wombe, (Where Nature doth her Twyning-Issue frame) The water soakes, whereof doth kindly come Full- By equiuocation it may bee taken for Infants as wel as Barnes: Barne being the name of Infant in some places of England.Barnes, to ioy the Lords that hold the same. For, as all Womens wombes do barren seeme, That neuer had societie of Men; So fertill Grounds we often barren deeme, Whose Bowells, Water fills not now and then. Then, Earth and Water, warmed with the Sunne, Ingenders what doth make Man-kinde ingender: For Venus quickly will to ruine runne, If Sine Cerere &amp; Baccho, friget Venus. Ceres and her Bacchus not defend her. Then looke how much the Race of Man is worth, So much is worth this Arte, maintaining it; Then Ã´ how deere is hee that brought it forth, With paine and cost for Man-kinds benefit! Though present Times (that oft vngratefull prooue) May vnder-valew both his Worke and Him; Yet After-times will prize them Price aboue, And hold them Durt that doe their glory dim. For He by Wisedome, ouer-rules the Fates, By Witt defeating passions of the Ayre; When they against his well-fare nurse debates, While fooles (ore-rul'd by each) die through dispaire. In dropping Sommers, that do marre the Meads, His Trenches draine the Raines superfluous Almes; And when heate wounds the Earth ( The Sunne exhaling all radicall moysture from thence by wounds or chaps which are made by summers heate.to death that bleeds) Hee cures the chaps with richest Water-balmes. So, when Heau'n (ceaselesse) weepes to see Earths sinne He can restraine those Teares from hurting him; Vntill his Teares the Heau'ns to The teares of sinners, are the wine of Angels. ioy do win, While other Grounds are torne, the life from limbe. And when the Earth growes Iron, for Hearts so growne, Hee can dissolue it straite (as Waxe it were;) Mantling the Meadowes in their Summer-Gowne; So ioys in hope, while others grieue in feare. âThus wisemen Ars Dominabitur astris. rule the Starres, as Starres doe fooles; âAnd each mans manners doe his Fortunes square; âArte learnes to thriue in Natures practick Schooles; âAnd Fortune fauours men of actions rare. Such one is this rare Subiect of my Rimes, Who raignes by mirry motion, ore my Spleene; Such is this Or cleare Mirrour. Water-glasse, wherein these Times Do see how to adorne their Meades in Greene.

How many Riuers, Founts, and Water-prills, (Tend'ring their seruice to their Lords for Rent) Are nere imployde but in poore Water-mills, While the drye Grounds vnto the Bones are brent. To Tantalus I can resemble those That touch the water that they n'ere doe taste; And pine away, Fruite being at their Nose, So, in Aboundance, they to nought do waste. The Brookes runne murmuring by their parched Brincks (Pure virgin Nimphes) and chide against the Stancks, When as their sweetest profer'd seruice stinkes, So coyly kisse the chapt-lippes of the Bankes. And (weake as water) in their Beds do stretch (As t'were to yeeld their Ghost for such disgrace) Their Christall limbes vnto the vtmost Reach; And In dry Summers the Riuers grow lowest. shrinke from th'Armes that (vselesse) them imbrace.

Beds, their loue and health to winne. O Landlords see, O see great Lords of Land These sencelesse creatures mou'd to eithers aid But for your helpe, who may their helpes command: Then well command, you shall be well obaid. Helpe Nature in her Workes, that workes for you; And be not idle when you may do good: âPaines are but Gaines take away the thought of Paines. Sports when earnest gaines insue: âFor, Sport, in earnest, lies in Liuelihood. The Golden-age is now return'd againe, Sith Gold's the God that all commands therein; By Gold (next God) Kings conquer, rule and raign; With Gold we may commute, or grace our sinne. Briefly, by Him we may do what we will, Although we would do more then well we may: For He makes ill too good, and good too ill; And more then God, the ill do him obay. Then if ye would be eyther Great or Good, Or Good and Great (all which he Wealth helps Vertue in her operations; whose hands were else bound from ouert action. can you make) Take pleasure (Ã´) to saue your Liuings Bloud And streame it through their Limbes, for Profits sake. This Esculapius of diseased Grounds, (Casting their Water in his Vrinalls) (His Trenches) sees what Humor ore-abounds, Aud cures them straight by Drought or Water-falls. This little-great-great-little Flash of Wit, This Soule of Action, all compos'd of Flame, (Mounting by Action to high Benefit) Exalts his State, his Countries, and his Fame. He well deserues to be a Lord of Land, That ore All gauly &amp; too dry grounds rebell against nature, and mens profit. rebellious Lands, thus Lords it well: O that all Lords that can much Land command. Would so command it, when it doth rebell. But pleasure, Pompe, and inter-larded Ease Possesse great Land-lords; who, for rebell Groundes, Do Racke their Rents, and idely liue on these; Or spoyle their Tenants Cropp with carelesse Houndes. But this rare Spirit, (that hath nor Flesh, nor Bone, But Man euen in the Abstract) hunts for Wealth With Witt, that runnes where Profit should be sowne By wholesome Paines; so, reaps both Wealth, &amp; Health. Whether the Cost, or Time, which he hath spent Be most, it's hard to say: for, twenty yeares His Pounds, by thousands, he his Grounds hath lent, Which payes now vse, on vse, as it appeares. The Place wherein is fall'n His happy Lott Hight Golden Valley; and so iustly held: His Royall TRENCH, is as his melting Pott, Whence issues Liquid-gold the Vale to gild! O that I had a World of glorious wordes, In golden Verse (with gold) to paint his praise, I would blinde Enuies Eyes, and make Land-lords By this Sunnes rising; see their Sonnes to raise. But Ã´! this is not all thou dost behight Deere Vaughan, thy Deere Country The Countries good. for her good; For, thou resolu'st to raise that benefit Out of thy priuate care; and Liu'lyhood. Thy many trades (too many to rehearse That shall on thy Foundation stedfast stand) Shall with their Praiers, still the Heauens pierce; And blesse their Founders rare Head, Heart, and Hand. That publike Table which thou will erect (Where forty euery Meale shall freely feed) Will be the Cause of this so good Effect To plant both Trades and Trafficke there with speed. There shall thy Iouialist Mechanicalls Attend this Table all in Scarlet Cappes; (As if they were King Arthures Seneschals) And, for their paines shall fill their Chapps and Lapps. For, neuer since King Arthurs glorious dayes (Whose radiant Knights did Ring his Table round) Did euer any such a Table raise As this, where Viands shall to all abound! Nay this, shall that franke Table farre exceed If we respect the good still done by each: For, that fedde none but such as had no need; But this (like God) shall feede both poore and rich! This Table then (that still shall beare thy Name In Hyrogliphicks of the daintiest Cates) As oft as it is spread shall spread thy Fame Beyond the greatest conquering Potentates! They spill with spite, what thou in pitty spend'st; They onely great, thou good, how euer small; Subuersion they, Erection thou intend'st; They foes to most, but Thou a friend to all. Thy vertuous care to haue thy God ador'd (Among thy Paines and Pleasures) all will blesse: Thy Pension for a Preacher &amp; Curate for daily seruice. Preacher of his Word, Shewes thou seek'st Heauen, and earthly happinesse. A Chappell and a Curate for the same (The one maintain'd, the other built by Thee For Gods Diurnall praise) shall make thy Name In Rubricke of the Saints enrold to be. Thine Almes-house for thy Any way mischanc't in their Bodies, So that they cannot work. haplesse Mechanicks Shall blaze thy charity to After-ages; And longer last in Brests of men, then Bricks; Increasing still thy heauenly Masters Wages. If holy Dauid had great thanks from Heau'n But for the Thought to make the 2 Sam. 7. 2â16. Arke an House; Then thanks of all, to Thee, should still be giu'n Whose purpose is to all commodious. O happy Captaine! that hast past the Pikes Of sharpest Stormes, still wounding Soldiers states, To end thy Dayes in that which all men likes, Ioy, Mirth, and Fellowship, which ends debates. Thy Drummes and Trumpets (Mars his melodie) That wonted were to call thy foes to fight, Shall now but call a friendly Company (For honest ends) to feasting and delight. Glory of Wales, and luster of thy name, That giu'st to both sans Parralel'd renowne, Vpon the Poles inscribed be thy Fame, That it to Worlds vnknowne may still be knowne. That they may say a Nooke but of an Isle That North-ward lies, doth yeeld a rarer Man, Then larger Lands by many a Thousand Mile, Who can do What is before expressed. Thus, and will do what He can. But many Monarches, many Worldes haue wonne, Yet, with their Winnings haue not wonne that praise As this great-little Lord of hearts hath done, For good-deedes done to These, and After-dayes. Now Enuy swell, and breake thy bitter'st Gall With ceaselesse fretting at these sweete Effects, Th'eternall good which he intends to all His Fame (well fenc'd) aboue a Foile erects. Liu'd He among the Pagans, they would make His glorious Like Mars, Iupiter and Saturne. Mansion some auspicious Starre; And make their Altars fume still for his sake As to a God, to whome still bound they are. For, Bacchus but for planting, first, those Vines. Plants Whereby mens Wealth, and Witt are oft ore'throwne Which Wanton Nature rather craues, then wants, They, as a God, with Gods do still enthrone. But let vs Christians, though not yeeld Him this, Yet giue him Loue and Honor due t'a Man, That makes men liue (like Gods) in Wealth, and Blisse, And heaue his Fame to Heauen if we can. Vaine Hanno taught his lesse vaine Birds to say Hee was a God: and then he turn'd them loose That they abroad might chaunt it still; but they (So gon) with silence prou'd their God, a Goose. Then, though no God he were, yet might He be A right ( Geese (by reason of their vigilancy) kept the Pagan-Gods in the Romaine Capitoll.) God-keeper in the Capitoll: They Geese (at most) and so (at least) was He; Or, if ought lesse, his God-head was a Gull. But what I say, none taught me but thy Worth; Nor shall it (like those Birds) thy Fame betray: But these my Lines shall then best sett thee forth When thou art worse then Wormes, and lesse then Clay. As well thy Crest, as Coat (Ã´ wondrous thing!) A Serpent is, about an Infants Necke: Who was thine Ancestor, as Bards do sing, So borne (aliue) the Fates to counterchecke. From him thou cam'st; as one, in him preseru'd; (By way of Miracle) for this good end, As, by thy skill, to haue so well deseru'd Of all the Kingdome, which it much will mend. This praise (perhaps) which thy deserts exact, By Enuy will be thought poeticke skill, Playing the Vice, but in a glozing Act, And so wrong Witte to sooth an erring will.

Seldome doe Clowdes so dimne the day, But Sol will once his Beames display: Though Neptune driues the surging Seas, Sometimes he giues them quiet ease; And so few Proiects speed so ill, But somewhat chaunceth at our will. I will not instance in the Great, Placed in Honors higher Seate; Though Vertue in a Noble Line Commends it, and the more doth shine: Yet this is procur'd by Sword and Pen, Desert oft dwells in priuate Men. My proofe is not farre hence to seeke, There is at hand braue Richard Peeke, Whose worth his Foes cannot reuoke, Borne in the Towne of Tauystoke In Deuon, where Minerua sitts Shaping stoute Hearts, and Pregnant Witts. This well resolu'd and hardy Sparke, Ayming at Fame, as at a Marke, Was not compell'd against his will, In Mars his field to try his skill: As Voluntary he did goe, To serue his King against his Foe. If he had pleas'd, he might haue spent His daies at home, in safe content: But nurcing Valour in his brest, He would aduenture with the Best, Willing to shed his dearest blood, To doe his Prince, and Countrey good. Thus bent, he adding Winges to Feete, Departed with the English Fleete: There was no rub, nor stay at all, The Shipps saild with a pleasant Gale: In setting forth they by their hap, Seem'd lul'd in Amphitrites lap. At length they did arriue at Cales, Where restles Peeke against the Walles Made fourescoore Shot towards the Shore, Making the Welkyn wide to rore: He kept his standing in this strife, Setting a straw by the losse of life. Into a Vineyard afterward He marcht, and stood vpon his guard; There he an Horse-man did dismount, By outward port of good account: But did on him compassion take, And spar'd his life for pitties sake. The next assault, vneuen he felt, For with twelue Spaniards he dealt At once, and held them lusty play, Vntill through odds, theirs was the day: From eare to eare they pearc'd his head, And to the Towne him Captiue led. In Prison they him shut by night, Loaden with Chaines of greiuous waight, All comfortlesse in Dungion deepe, Where Stench annoyes, and Vermines creepe: He grouel'd in this loathsome Cell, Where gastly sights and horrors dwell. Yet nothing could his courage quaile, Hunger, nor thirst, nor wound nor Iayle: For being brought before a Don, And askt, Why England did set on A scraping, not a pecking Hen? He answer'd, staine not English-men. That England is a Nation stoute, And till the last will fight it out: My selfe could prooue by Chiualrie, If for a Captiue this were free: Why, (quoth the Duke) darst thou to fight With any of my Men in sight? Of thousands whom in Warre you vse, Not one (quoth Peeke) doe I refuse: A chosen Champion then there came, Whose heeles he tript, as at a game, And from his Hand his Rapier tooke, Presenting it vnto the Duke. Then three at once did him oppose They Rapiers, he a long Staffe chose The vse whereof so well he knowes, He conquer'd them with nimble blowes: One that beside him play'd his round, He threw as dead vnto the ground. The Noble Duke who this did see Commended Peeke, and set him free; He gaue him Guifts, and did commaund That none should wrong him in their Land; So well he did him entertayne, And sent him to the Court of Spayne. There he was fed with no worse meate, Then which the King himselfe did eate; His Lodging rich, for he did lie In furniture of Tapestrie: The King what of him he had heard, Did with his Treasure well reward. Our then Ambassador was there, Peekes Pike and praise he doth declare: At Spanish Court whiles he attends He thriues for Vertues sake: as Friends Foes sent him in triumphant sort Home from a Foe and Foreign Port. If thus his very Foes him lou'd, And Deeds against themselues aproou'd; How should his Friends his loue embrace, And yeild him countenance and grace? The praise and worth how can we cloke Of manly Peeke of Tauystoke? FINIS III.âWilliam Parry.

To my deseruedly beloued and worthy Friend and Countriman Mr. Iohn Gwillim, touching his display of the Honourable Art of ARMORY. Thy Name, thy Countrey, and thy matchlesse Art Incites my Muse to raise her Armes of pow'r, With praises to lay open thy desert, To make it all-deuouring Time deuoure. But (oh) a small Reward it is to get, But Fame, too Cheape, for that which cost so deere, As Time, and Paines, and Cost; and all three, great; Yet that's the most, the most doe looke for heere. Thou hast reduc'd an Art (much like our Law) Vnmethodiz'd, to such a Method now, That the whole Art, that was before but raw, Is made most ripe in Rules the same to know: Heere, all the Termes by which the Art is knowne, And the least Particle of each least Part, Are so Anatomized, and strictly showne, That All may see the Soule of all this Art. Heere, all the Bearings, both of Beasts and Birds, Of Fish, Flies, Flowers, Stone, and each minerall, Of Planets, Starres, and all, that All affords, Are made by Art, appeare most naturall. So that this Worke, did ransacke Heauen and Earth, Yea Natures bulke it selfe, or all that is In Nature hid, before this Booke had birth, To shew this Art by them, and them by this: Then, Natures Secretary we may stile Thy Searching Spirit, or else we iustly may, Plinius Secundus call thee; sith (the while, Rare Herald) thou dost Natures Armes display; So that we cannot hold him Generous, (If squar'd by Rules of Generosity,) That will not haue this Booke (composed thus) To vnderstand Himselfe, and It thereby. For, heere by Armes (as sometimes Ships at Sea) Is seene how Houses grapple, but for Peace; Yet (being ioined) distinguisht so they be, That we may see them (seuerall) peece by peece. For, the whole Body to these Armes thou hast, So cleerely purg'd from sad Obscurity, That now this Art in FRONT may well be plac'd Of Arts that shine in Perspicuity. And if before, the same seem'd most abstruse; Now, hast thou (for WALES glory, and thine owne Rare BRITAINE) made it facill for our vse, Sith vnconfusedly the same is showne: Then, all that honour Armes must honour Thee, That hast made Armes from all confusion Free.

In euery Art, saue Poetry, the meane Is praisd: but therein meanely-well to do Is base, too base: then Iudgment cannot leane On whats too base, but base it must be too. Then each man that his Reputation huggs For Iudgment, praise no lines of but meane Reach: And laude but what drawes dry Mineruaes duggs, Lest they their Iudgments might thereby impeach. Then is my Iudgment Iack, perplext in thee; For thou dost write so well with meanes so ill That thine Admirer I confesse to be, Much rather then the Iudger of thy skill: Art makes not Poetry, thou dost plainly proue, But supernaturall bountie from aboue.

In the most iust praise of Musicke, this praise-worthy Worke, and my deare, vertuous and right expert friend, the most iudicious Author. The ten-fold Orbes of Heauen are said to moue By Musicke; for they make, Harmonious din: And all the Powres subordinate aboue Spend Time, nay, spend Ãternity therein. If Musicke then, moue all that All doth moue; That's not compriz'd in ALL that spights her State: If not in ALL, it's nought; which who doth loue is worse then nought, to loue what Heau'n doth hate: For, NOVGHT is nothing; sith it was not made By that great WORD, without which made was nought: Then, if that nought but NOVGHT doe her inuade, Like God, her goodnesse is surmounting THOVGHT. But no man is so ill that hath no good; So, no man in the Abstract can be nought: Then 'tis no man that hates sweete Musickes moode, But Some-thing worse then all that can be thought. A Beast? O no: A Monster? neither. Then Is it a Deuill? Nothing lesse: for, these Haue Beings with an Angell, or a Man; But that exists not, that sweete Notes displease. FORMES, Essence giue to Man, Beast, Fish, &amp; Fowle; Then Men WERE not, had they no Soule (their Forme) But Musickes haters haue no Forme, nor Soule: So, they (like Sinne) exist but to enorme, For, had they Soules produc't in Harmony, Or rather Art it selfe (some Wise auouch) They would he rauisht with her Suauity. And turn'd CÃ¦lestiall with her Heauenly Touch! But, let them goe as more than mortall Sinne 'Gainst Wisedomes Spirit, not to be forgiuen: While thou dost wooe the Soules, which thou dost winne With thy Sweet Notes (deere Friend) to mind but Heau'n. Thy Nature, Manners, and thy Notes doe make A Three-fold Cord, to drawe all hearts it gaines: Thy Musickes Cordes hold Eares and Eyes awake (Yet lullaby in pleasure) with their Straines.

Lo here a Monument admir'd of all That weigh the compass, weight, and height of it; O'r-topping Envie's clouds, and ever shall Sith built by deepest Art, and highest Wit. The Base that bears it, is the Word that stands True Ground of highest glorie, truth, and grace: The Building rear'd by two rare heads and hands (Divinely holp) to glorifie that Base. Here French and English, joyne in friendly fight (On even Ground) to prove their utmost power; Who shew such equall Skill, and equall Might, That hard it is to say who's conqueror. But, English bound to foot it like the French And offer nought, but what shall like her foe, It is as glorious seld to take a Wrench, As being free, to give an overthrow. If French to English were so strictly bound, It would but passing lamely strive with it; And soon be forc't to lose both grace and ground, Although they strave with equall Skill and Wit. Besides, all Prose is easier to translate Then Verse; and easier low, then lofty Lines: Then, these Lines, reaching to the top of State Are hard'st of all: yet none of all declines. O faire Translation then, with smoothÃ©d face, Goe forth to' allure Time's Turns, to turn Thee o'r: So shall they in thy folds unfold thy grace; And grace thee with Fame's glory more and more. If Ovid me. Hee, that churn'd the Cream of Poetry, To honied Butter, that the Muses feeds, DivinÃ©d truly, it should never die; Then, what shall This, that far the same exceeds? Hee labour'd Lines, w?? though they doe endure All turns of Time, yet was their stuf profane: But these are drawn of Stuf more heav'nly pure, That most shall shine; when those are in the wane. Hee, though his Braines (profanely) were divine, And glorious Monuments of art compos'd, Was yet exil'd for many a looser Line, That made them wantons, chastely else dispos'd: But, thou (clear Bartas, his dear Sylvester, Whose Lines do lead to Vertues only gaine, And with sweet Poesies strew'st the way to her) How should the World remunerate thy paine? And, if from heart's aboundance tongues do speak; And what we most affect, wee most doe minde: It argues, thou this Argument didst seek; Sith, in thy Soule before, thou didst it finde. So, Bartas was but Mid-wife to thy Muse, With greater ease to utter her Conceits; For whose dear birth, thou didst all ease refuse, World's-weale, and (being a Merchant) thy Receits. This pain so pleas'd thy labouring Thoughts, that thou Forsook'st the Sea, and took'st thee to the Soile, Where (from thy royall Trade,) thou fell'st to plow Art's furrows with thy Pen, that yeeld but toyl. This stole thee from thy selfe, thy selfe to finde In sacred Raptures on the Muses' Hill: And, went'st out of thy Body with thy Minde, More freely so, to use thy Wit and Will. And (O!) how haplesse had wee Britains been (Sith here is stor'd such sweet Soule-ravishments) Hadst thou not made them to us clearly seen: Who give thee for it praising Discontents? If so great Art and Grace, finde nought but fame Of famous Men for grace; the Presse shall be Prest but for Vice's Service (Source of shame). So Times to come, in Print our shame shall see. But O! be't far from this so famous Isle For Armes and Learning, either to neglect; Sith it doth grace and glorie quite exile, And is the cause of many a bad effect. O terrene Gods, as yee to State aspire, Lift Learning up with you; especially If matcht with Wisedome, and divine desire: So shall yee twice be like the Deity. And, weigh what pow'r the Pens of such possesse (Of such; for others will but gild your Crimes) Their Pens eternise can your worthinesse: And make yee glorious, past succeeding Times. But you doe justly to neglect and scorn The cursÃ©d crue, that doe the Muse abuse: For, they your praises to dispraises turn; As Vice, in praising Vertue's grace, doth use. Their wine-driv'n brains, involv'd in follie's cloud, Fly here, and there (and where not?) with a trice: And, though both beggars base, yet passing proud; Constant in nothing but inconstant Vice: Making loose lines (forsooth) their Scala CÅli, A Taverne for a Temple to adore; Their onely god, their guts, their beastly Belly, To whom they offer all their slender Store. The Lands of such, are odious like their Lives: They (Pitch) pollute what-ere they doe but touch; Whose glory to the foulest shame arrives: Then, well you fence your fame to keep off such. But they whose lives, and lauds, and lines are Source Of Moral vertue, running by each stone (Men high, and hard, that let them in their Course) To Seas of glory, like clear Helicon; O! these ye should support, and still receive Into the Ocean of your bound-lesse love: For these (like truest Friends) will take, and give No more but what true Vertue shall approve. If these should pine away through your neglect, Your memories shall dye, or live with shame; Sith such a Muse is the chiefe Architect, To reare, from Earth to Heav'n, a lasting Name. Achilles' fame, with him, had been interr'd, Had Homer's lines not ty'd it to the Stars: And, of Ãneas wee had never heard, Had Virgil's Strains not been his Trumpeters. One of the Nine had bin our Warwick's Guy, (The Nine, whose worth all Times so much commend;) And so disrankt great Bullen's Godfery Had hee but had a Tasso for his friend. Laura had ne're so greenly growne above Her Peers, as now she doth, to after-times, Had she not had a Petrarch to her Love; Which made her mount, with Nectar-dropping Rimes. No, no: ye cannot but out-live your Fame, If ye uphold not Fame's best Notaries: If these ye scorne, your glory is but game; For, when ye die, in game your glory dies. And, though blest Peace hath turn'd our Spears to spades, Let it not turn our pens to ploughs, or worse; By Learning some should live as some by Trades, In blessÃ©d States, that would incurre no curse. Where Vertue is not rais'd, and Vice supprest, There all to Vice will run; and so to wrack: For, there the worst shall Lord it ore the best; And where that is, all goes to utter sack. Reward, and Punishment (like Armes of Steel) Doe still uphold each King-upholding State: For, neither wants, but it begins to reel; But, both imploy'd, stands sure in spight of Hate. Then may thy Hopes, wing'd by thy vertuous Muse, Dear Sylvester, expect some cherishment, In this blest State; that still those Armes will use, To stay her Grace, and grace her Government: But, if thy paines acquire but pure renowne, Thou art Christ's Image, crost for Glorious crown. Beneficium dando accipit, qui digno dedit. The unfained lover of thine Art, honesty, and vertue, John Davies of Hereford. FINIS.</field>
