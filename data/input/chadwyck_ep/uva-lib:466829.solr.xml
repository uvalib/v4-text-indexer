      <field name="fulltext">Heavy-winged thieves!â Shelley's Skylark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An âOh!â or âAh!â of joy or miseryâ Or a âHa! ha!â or âBah!ââa yawn, or âPooh!â Of which perhaps the latter is most true. Byron.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PEDESTRIAN. My heart is light, and my strength is good, And e'er night I shall pass yon dreary wood! The red sun is sinking behind the hill, And every thing around is still, Save the murmuring sound, so pleasing and sweet, Of the rippling river that runs at my feet; And the nightingale chaunting his evening song, To the traveller, wearily toiling along! But curling now from yon cottage I see The dun smoke ascending so cheerily; And the housewife now, with duteous care, The evening meal begins to prepare; And though for me no home is near, No meal prepared with friendly cheer, Yet so light is my heart, and my strength so good, That e'er night I shall pass this dreary wood! 1825. A REVERIE. ââincipe! nil est. Culpantur frustra calami. Hor. Ser. 2, 3. As thus I sate in musing mood, With nought to break my solitude, Mingling and mangling bits of rhymes And changing each a thousand times; Now catching at a straggling thought And shifting it about, when caught, To see in what form it would look The best, in paper or in book; And now, relinquishing as vain Each futile project of my brainâ The candles had been long neglected, And thieves too might have been detected, Which both their reddening wicks infested, Allowed to reign there unmolested; 'Twas then, when they began to glimmer, Growing irregularly dimmer, Now burning steady, dull, and slow, And sinking gradually low; Now quickening up, and shedding bright, But wavering and trembling light; That all my thoughts and projects gone, And not one left to rhyme upon, I dashed my pen into the fire, And swore I would renounce the lyre. 1825 WINTER. The air is cold and chilling now, On the trees not a leaf is remaining; And barren Winter, crowned with snow, In desolate grandeur is reigning. Like a dream, those lovely flowers are past, Though many and blooming we found them, Which, laughing in rich luxuriance, cast The glow of their beauties around them. The rose has blushed for the last, last time And sweet, from its lowly bed, The violet's blue no more glistens through The dew-drop that weighed down its head. The light winds sigh so mournfully by, They seem o'er the flow'rets weeping; The hard-fixed ground with the frost is bound, And Nature herself is sleeping. But Spring will soon call, and wake her again, She will come in her beauty bounding! Pleasure and Joy will dance in her train, Her welcome return resounding! The sun will smile on the flowers once more, Their leaves will unfold to receive him; His beams will illumine the earth as before, And Nature with joy will perceive him! So when affliction saddens the heart, And man of his crosses is weary; When hope is fled, and desires are dead, And all within is dreary; His passions asleep, the world he detests, And despair succeeds to sorrow;â But hope returns, in his bosom she burns, And he smiles again to-morrow! December, 1826. ANACREONTIC. The red sun drinks of the cooling wave, When his shining course is over, And the moon, with pale and watery beam, Drinks brightness from her lover: The dry earth drinks the shower, And flowers spring anew; The bee sips from the flower, And the flower drinks the dewâ Then why should we refuse To drink together too? The brilliant sun-beams glancing On the billows of the ocean, Are ever with them dancing, In ever-restless motionâ The flow'rets of the dingle, And the leaves upon the trees, In merry dances mingle To the music of the breezeâ Then why should we refuse To join the dance with these? June, 1827. THE STEAM-BOAT. A goodly vessel did I then espy, Come like a giant from a haven broad, And lustily along the bay she strode! WordsworthâSonnet. The sun sinks downâhis last beams parting stray, In streaks of gold along the placid deep, Far-spreading; and the soft-declining day Dying, sinks calmly beautiful to sleep,â Whence comes that lengthening rush? Is it the sweep Of some far distant torrent? Whence may be Those breeze-borne notes of harmony, that creep, Softened by distance, onward, till the sea Is filled with swelling strains of sweetest melody! On comes the steamer swiftâswift she glides by! Proud, steady, and majestic! surely she Disdains by help of winds or tides to fly, Aye, though they both at once opposing be, Would still sweep on resistless through the sea! Around her prow the dancing waters play; And, rattling on in swift succession, see, The fast-revolving paddles beat away The waves, that rise on high in clouds of foaming spray! As the heart heaves within the troubled breast, Late moved by some wild passion; and 'tis long Before the fluttering spirits sink to rest, Still shaken by the dark tumultuous throng Of feelings which survive the first, the strong Excitement, ceased itself;âso though no more The steamer labours the vexed waves among, Still rise the heaving watersâstill they pour Back, as with greater force, to lash the opposing shore 1827. [As the April sun breaking] As the April sun breaking Through masses of cloud, Flings a dim ray of brightness O'er the dark purple shroudâ A single ray, stealing Across the wild sky, Like an angel of promise From glory on high! So memory brings us From the days that are gone, Some bright sunny moment, Seen sparkling alone!â Though faintly she trace it, Forgetfulness round it, Yet she brings it as pure And as calm as she found it! As we gaze o'er the desert That stretches between, And doat on that moment So brightly serene! Its joys are rememberedâ Its happiness cherishedâ Its cares, if it had them, Forgotten and perished. It is hard to conceive When we think what we are, All wearied with trouble, All worn out with careâ That we are the same With those whom we see, In that glimpse of the past So happy and free; Then, motes in the sunbeam Disporting so gaily; Now, learning new sorrows, Fresh bitterness daily;â But we'll banish the present, To live in the past, Content with the knowledge That nothing can last. 1827. SUNSET. (FROM AN UNFINISHED POEM.) O'er Shechem's vale, the fading day Steals, calmly lingering, away; On either hand the mountains rise, Clothed richly soft with varied dyes; Not cragged and coldâand bleak and gray, But gently curved, with flowers gay. And where they open, widely sweeping, The western sky all golden shewing, Is seen the broad sun, brightly glowing, And crimson streaks around him sleeping, Crossed by a distant scattered group Of palm trees that desponding droop, As if in lowly meekness bending, Before their God, the Sun descending! And warmly flow those sunbeams bright, Fill the hushed vale with hallowed light, And gleam o'er groves whose lengthening shadows In stillness rest on greenest meadowsâ Groves richly filled with jasmine fair That sweetly scents the evening airâ And skirted by a gay profusion Of fruit and flower in wild confusion, And many a tree in blossom now Whose fruit still blushes on the bough. The bee hums on to the mountain side, His gathered honey there to hide; The warbling of the nestling bird Within the trees is faintly heard; All is so still, and sweet, and fair, That every sense might revel there! A STARRY NIGHT. (FROM THE SAME.) He looked on the starsâand with something of joyâ But mingled and mellowed with mournful alloy; He saw them shining brightly on high, Brightly in the distant sky; The sky that seemed so darkly blue But to add brightness to their hueâ The sky that seemed so softly calm But to increase their soothing charm! He lookedâand he thought how they come and goâ Unmarking, unmoved by what passes below; Happily twinklingâhappily burningâ Still calmly departingâstill brightly returning! He turned to earth, and looked aroundâ And he felt like a grovelling worm on the ground; He felt as if that were his proper sphereâ He felt as if left by all he held dearâ It was so dark and so dismally drear! The very sky, as the earth it neared, Dark and deep in gloom appeared! So he turned him again to the regions of light, With their myriads on myriads gathering brightâ Strange! That all brightness and peace should be there. And nothing but sorrow and darkness here DEATH. (FROM THE SAME.) The warrior on the battle plain, Elated feels that Death is gain! He knows that many a tongue will tell, He bravely fought and nobly fell; That many a young and ardent heart Will burn to act his glorious part, And often as his name he hears, Will see the pictured scene arise, Though mellowed by the mist of years, Distinct before his envious eyes; The deadly storm of desperate blows The furious chargeâthe fatal close! The sick one on the dying bed, May even there be comforted; He sees around the falling tear Of weeping friends who watch him near, And knows, however dark his lot, He will not here be all forgot! The poor man worn and wearied dies, And finds a place of restâ The rich man every pleasure tries, And finds them poor at best; Then sick of all he loved before, With nothing left to live for more, Dies, like a sated guest! Hope gives the good man strength to bear, And pride can make the wicked dare This last, this trying test, Uphold them in Death's darkest hour, And bid them mock his vaunted power! DESPAIR. (FROM THE SAME.) The goaded soul will madly try Distracted from its woes to flyâ Try every slenderest hope in vain; The blasting sense returns again, The sense of utter helplessnessâ Till, wearied with its wild distress, It sinks beneath the barren blight Of dark Despair's o'ershadowing might! A bitter calmâunlike the roar The fierce waves madly made before, While o'er them yet the vessel bore; But like the waters settling dark And silent o'er the sinking bark! A FRAGMENT. (FROM THE SAME.) Goâtake the wings of morning lightâand fly To where the utmost ocean meets the skyâ Amidst the lonely stillness, need Despair Afflict the heart?âno, God is present there! Or through yon watching orbs unwearied wind Till farthest glimmering stars are left behindâ There, lost in gloomy spaceâstill, changeless, wideâ His hand shall hold thee, and his right hand guide! Dive down the darkest depths of hell, and there Will God be stillâGod, God is everywhere! June, 1828. PLAIN TRUTHS. (EXTRACT FROM A LETTER.) Well then, for advice, it most common and trite is, And therefore, perhaps, most easy to write is; And you know, like the slipper that's hunted, you reap it From all without trouble, though no one will keep it: And as they give it first, who should have least to do with it, Why, we'll make that a reason for my troubling you with it. In all things you do, say, think, or devise, Moderation will govern you if you be wise; The extremes e'en of virtues are vices that hurt you, The beginning of vices is sometimes a virtue; There's nothing so bad that it has not some good in't; To discover how much be but cautious and prudent. Though all bitter we like not, all sweetness admire, 'Tis a mixture of both that most we desire; For where is the fruit ever woman or man ate With more relish than oranges, shaddock, pomegranate? Of beauty, both moral and physical, âtak tent;â The highest of beauty's when neither is lacked in't; Of the two, that which claims of attention most part, Of course is the beauty of mind and of heart; As an earthenware jug of real flowers is finer Than the best artificial! though clustered in China; And a plain homely dish of good viands will tempt ye From the brightest and richest gold plate that is empty. Study mildness, good-humour, submission, and meekness, For the strength of a woman consists in her weakness; The thistle and nettle, though armed, none would spare, But who'd tread on the daisy, âwee, crimson and fair?â Good hours, of course, I need not recommend to you, The cheapest best ornaments any could send to you; âGood hours, of fair cheeks,â Byron says, âare best tinters, âAnd lower the rouge bills, at least by some winters.â Take care of your health, and take care of your purse, 'Tis a friend you should cherishâyou often meet worse. But whatever you lean to, whate'er in your way shun, Of all things, keep farthest from vile affectation; It puts one in mind of the story related By the good-humoured Hajji, See the Adventures of Hajji Baba in England. wherein it is stated That the doctor or purser (I forget which it was) had a Dye lent him by one of the suite of the ambassador; And his head he profusely anointed, opining That his hair would be soon both jet-black and shining; But one of the stains which mixed gave the jettiness Its virtue had lostâand with it its prettiness; And the coxcomb was shocked, when he found to his sorrow That his hair was as red as a brick on the morrow. Just so, the good folks who this foible delight in, But detract from those charms which they think it will heighten. May 12, 1829. CHORUS IN THE âSEVEN AGAINST THEBESâ OF ÃSCHYLUS.(FAITHLESSLY RENDERED FROM THE ORIGINAL.) An Argive army before the walls of Thebes, advancing to the assault. The Chorus of Virgins looking out from the battlements, pours forth a medley of description, prayers, and ejaculations. ??????? ?????? ?????? ?????. ?. ?. ?. 78 Terror strikes my trembling frameâ Woes impend too great to name! The warrior-hosts upon the plain, Are moving to their ranks again. Successive crowds of cavalry Pour onward like a raging sea Whose waves with wildly-hollow roar Chase each other to the shore. I know it by the thick clouds curling, Wide their slugglish folds unfurling! I see them slowly from the tents, Uprising to the battlements! Dense and slowâthey clearly tell, And deadly stillâthey speak too wellâ Too well they tell of foemen nearing, Crimson War and Death appearing! Hark to the slumber-startling sound, The steady tramp that shakes the ground! The heavy tread of horses prancing, Hundred steeds at once advancing! Hearken to the fearful hum Gathering as they fiercely come, Like waves that dash with boisterous shock On the wet, spray-dripping rock! Oh ye that in Olympus dwell! Ye gods! ye gods! our foes repel! Their efforts crush, their fury quell, And calm the rising storm! See! see! how backward flash the raysâ A circle wide of dazzling blazeâ As high their glittering shields they raise And round the city form! Who is now our aid? Who for our defence arrayed? Of all the gods on high On whom shall we rely? Shall we to the shrines repair, And clinging to the statues, there Supplicate with earnest prayer? Oh ye who from the blissful plains Descend to illume our sacred fanes, By fixing there your bright abodesâ Our own, our chief, our guardian gods! Oh is not this the time to clasp With entreating trembling grasp, Made by depth of terror bold, Those statues of terrestrial mould In which revering mortals see Personified divinity? Whyâwhy do we delay With bursting sigh and trickling tear To wend the mournful way? First Three of the Choir, (addressing the others). Do ye not hear The clashing swordâthe whirring spear?â When shall we go, with footsteps slow, Clad in gloomy garb of woeâ On brows declining, chaplets twining, At the sanctuaries to bow? Oh never if not now! Second Three, (answering). I hearâI hear! The clashing swordâthe whirring spear! Hark! hark! the air around So teems with horrid sound, It may be felt and seen! Not oneânot one! a thousand spears With clashing din assault the earsâ Sharp cries and shouts between! Lord of War! to thee we pray! Lord of War! wilt thou betray Thine own peculiar peopleâthey Who more than all thy rule obey? Oh golden-helmÃ«d godâlook downâlook down Upon the city once thine own! Come all ye Powers of Light! Come in glorious might! Come, every radiant Lord of heaven Till wide the scattered foe be driven! Till the virgin-band shall be From the chilling terror free Of soul-debasing slavery! Against the walls, a roaring sea Of proud-plumed men beats clamorously, Lashed to fury, fierce and far By the rushing breeze of war! But oh! thou King of Gods, to whom, below, Above, all things performance owe, Our battles wage, our fears assuage And baffle the besiegers' rage! The Theban towers encircled stand By a threatening Argive band Gathering in increasing swarmsâ And oh! those horrid arms! Hark! the bits and trappings playing Freely, as the chargers neighing Proudly prance in furious mood, Ring querulous for blood! At every one of seven gates, One of seven champions waits, Breathing terrors fierce and high, In spear-repulsing panoply! Oh Jove-descended power! To whose delighted ear The deafening bray of battle-hour Is ravishingly dear!â Minerva! be our trusty tower In time of weakness near! And thou, the God, whose mighty nod The generous courser gave, Without whose will the winds lie still, The great Deep dare not raveâ Awed by the trident vast, whose sway Upreared above the wave The Monsters of the Main obeyâ Thine anxious people save! Sire of our Cadmeian line! Warrior God! thine ear incline; Let our state thy power attest Make thy glory manifest! Venus too! we bow before thee, Venus, ever we adore thee! In thine ambrosial form we trace The mother of the Theban race! Oh then deeply we implore thee Defend our long-loved dwelling place! Mighty with the matchless bow! Archer-king, assist us now! And thou the chaste Latona-born! Maiden of the mountain horn! Diana! can the foe withstand Shaft from thine unerring hand! Strophe 1. Hark! rolling through the streets afar, Comes the clattering of the car! Oh Juno, Juno hear! Heavily creaking o'er the stones, How the loaded axle groans! Be thou, Diana, near! The air is maddened with the sound Of showers of spears that ring around! What will be our city's fate! What doom doth its defenders wait! What dread result will soon be given By the ruling powers of Heaven! Antistrophe 1. See! clouds of stones are thickly soaring, Against the ramparts, crashing, roaringâ Nearer rolls the desperate fight! 'Tis at the gate those falchions bright Are clashing on the brass-bound shieldsâ Who now, Apollo, wins or yields? Mistress of the Conflict! hear! Fray-enchanted Queen! appear! Yield not thus to adverse Fates The City of the Seven Gates! Strophe 2. Hail all ye tutelary powers! Guardians of our ancient towers! Ye for whom our victims bleed, Help us in the hour of need; When the spoiler at the gates The foreign foe terrific waits! Our trembling arms are raised and bare, Oh listen to the virgins' prayer! Antistrophe 2. Come all in one resistless band! Mars! who loves the battle-brandâ Archer-King and Mountain Maidâ Thou who mak'st the depths afraid! Goddess of the olive greenâ Ever-ruling Beauty's Queenâ All who make our land your care, For that land your love declare! If ye the rites of worship heed, If ye would have the victim bleed, If ye would have a nation bow, Protect those ritesâthat nation now! July, 1829. OPENING SCENES OF THE âCLOUDSâ OF ARISTOPHANES. The âCloudsâ was written to ridicule the pernicious doctrines of the Sophists, at that time the sole educators of the Athenian youth. From one of these doctrines, that the agreeable was always right, if practicableâthat what we would we always should, if we could, an idea of the rest may be formed. The person of Socrates, singularly suited for caricature, and his constant attendance at the schools of the Sophists, for which alone he was then remarkable, pointed him out to the comic dramatist as a fitting hero for his poem. Socrates indeed was always seen in the company of the Sophistsâ but his object was unknown to the public; he was a perpetual thorn in their sidesâever engaging and beating them with their own weapons; he stuck to them like a goat-suckerâthough his case was just the converse of the bird's, in this particular, that in reality the greatest enemy, he was generally esteemed the friend of those to whom he adhered. A countryman, ruined by the extravagance of his son, endeavours to persuade him to go and learn sophistry at the school of Socrates, that so he might be enabled to cheat his creditors. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Strepsiades. Parsnippides, Son of Strepsiades. Disciple of Socrates. Servant Boy. Scene first. Strepsiades and his son in bed. The latter asleep. Streps. Alack! alack! How long, how monstrous long, oh Jove, the nights are In dragging through! Will day-light never come? I'm sure I heard the cock crow long agoâ The slaves are snoring stillâbefore the war I'd not have borne their impudence so coolly! This comes of going to warâmy curses on it! Look ye, I dare not even give my slaves A beating when they want it; curse the war! Young Hopeful here, though, seems but little given To pass the night in watching; there he lies, At least five blankets round and round him rolled.â Well, since it must be so, I'll pull the clothes up And try to snore as loud as they. No, no! The slaves may sleep, I cannot; for the cost This fellow of a son for ever puts me to In debts for horses, stables, and the like, (Besides the keeping) racks me all night long, Andâbites me till the blood comes. Not the less The rascal rides and drives his curricle, And even dreams of horses. I am like To die when I perceive the moon bring on The days for payment to the usurers: The interest still goes on. Boy, bring a light, And fetch the account book, quick, that I may see How much I owe, and reckon up the interest. Here, give it me. First, forty pounds to Pasia. What! forty pounds to Pasia! and for what? I'd like to know for what. Oh, for a horseâ The dashing blood Bellerophon. Alack, Unhappy that I am! I wish before I'd bought this dashing blood Bellerophon, I'd dashed my eye out with a big, sharp stone! Aristophanes puns upon the words ????????? and ????????.. An attempt, perhaps a needless or unsuccessful one, has been made to preserve the pun in the translation. Pars. (talking in sleep.) My friend, that isn't fairâkeep your own course. Streps. There, there, 'tis that that ruins me, d'ye see Though sound asleep, his head still runs on driving. Pars. How many courses has that chariot driven? Streps. How many courses, fool, have you driven me? How many shifts compelled me to resort to?â But come, whose claim doth next oppress me This line is parodied from the tragedians.? Ah! Twelve pounds to Amunias, for wheels and coach-box! Pars. (still asleep) Strip off that horse's harness; lead him home. Streps. I think, bad luck to you, you're stripping me Of all I'm worth; besides, these debts to pay, The usurers swear they'll seize my goods. Pars. (waking.) Why father, What can the matter be? What makes you fume, And turn the whole night topsy-turvey, eh? Streps. I cannot rest a moment in the blankets; I'm bitten through and through byâthe usurer, Who says he'll seize my goods. Pars. I wish, good man, You'd let me get a wink or two of sleep. Streps. Go, go to sleep with you; but mark my words, The weight of these detested debts shall fall On your own lazy shoulders, my young fellow Alack-a-day! Oh, would to Heaven destruction deep had fallen In the original, a parody on the first line of the Medea of Euripides. On her, the busy, meddling match-maker, Who fooled me into marrying your mother. I led, ere that, the sweetest country life: Up to my eyes in dirt, unscrubbed, at ease, And passing rich in fleeces, bees, and vineyards, And then to go, a hob-nail that I was, And marry me, forsooth, a grand and dressy dame, From top to toe âmy ladyââniece of Megacles, The high-born Megacles! I wedded her; I, rank with smell of fleeces, bees-wax, cheese-rindsâ She, all perfumery scent and dalliance, Dress, showers of kisses, waste and wantonness. I don't say she was out-and-out a spendthrift, But just in all she did, she ran too fast Taking a candle up the other day, âMy dear,â said I, ('twas just to cloak a hint) âYou shouldn't light both ends at once, my dear!ââ Boy. There's not a drop of oil, sir, in the lamp. Streps. Why did you light a lamp that used so much? Come and be beaten, rascal. Boy. Oh, sir, why? Streps. Because you put in one of the thick wicks.â Well, after that, this precious son was born; And then a desperate tussle straight began 'Twixt my good dame and me, about his name. Nothing would please her fancy but Xanthippus, Charippus, or Callippides, or some Such lofty-sounding, noble appellation. I battled stoutly for plainâParsimon, For 'twas his grand-dad's name; 'twas long before We came to termsâat last we split the difference, And called the boyâParsnippides. This boy,â Whenever dandling him upon her knee, My wife began, âMy sweet, when you're grown up, âOh what a dashing gig you'll drive to town, âWrapt in a graceful cloak like Megaclesââ And I would interrupt with, âWhen you're grown up, âWhat shaggy herds of goats you'll drive to pasture, âClad like your father, in a coarse smock frockââ He never wasted breath in talking on't, But quietly inflicted on my purse A kind of veterinary malady, A horse-consumption, equine atrophy! Now, after puzzling all night long, I've got One plan at last, I think a devilish good oneâ And if I can but coax this fellow into't, I yet shall save my bacon. First, let's see How I can wake him least offensivelyâ Parsnippides! my pretty! Pars. What say, father! Streps. (Coaxingly.) Kiss me, my boyâcome let me squeeze your hand. Pars. Oh, oh! what now! Streps. My boy, now do you love me? Pars. Ay, that I doâby Neptune, god of horseflesh! Streps. No more, for God's sake, of the god of horsefleshâ That god's the cause of all my troubles, boy! But if you really love me from your heart, Obey me, boy! Pars. In what must I obey you? Streps. Give up your present coursesâmend your manners, And come attend to what I've got to say. Pars. Say what it is, then. Streps. But will you obey me? Pars. Ay, ay, by Bacchus! Streps. Well, then, look this way. D'ye see that door, and that small cottage, there? Pars. I doâi'faith, and what may that be, father? Streps. The mental-workshop of your witty spirits; There men reside, who'd prove the very sky A mighty furnace wrapping us in flame, And we the coals and cinders. For a fee, They teach a man, by dint of argument, To prove that wrong is right, and right is wrong. Pars. But what are they? Streps. I don't exactly know; Excogitators deep, real gentles, all, Of substance good, and reputation fair. Pars. A pack of scamps, I'll lay my life! you mean Such gruel-visaged, ill-shod swaggerers, As Socrates (the knave!) and ChÅrephon. Streps. Hush, hush, nowâdon't talk nonsense. But do something To save your father's barley-board and lodging,â Cut jockeyship, and turn philosopher. Pars. I one of these! No, noâby Bacchusâno! Not though you bribe me with the finest game-cocks My friend Leogoras ever trained for victory! Streps. I do entreat you now, my dearest fellow, Do come and learn. Pars. What would you have me learn? Streps. They say those people have two kinds of reasoning, The stronger, as they call it, and the weaker; Of these, they say, though wholly in the wrong, The worse can get the better of the better. Go, learn me then, that unjust argument, And of those debts, incurred on your account, I will not payânot Iâno, not a farthing! Pars. I cannot goâhow could I bear to look A man o' horseback in the face again, If I were like those dried skin-bags of bones, Those clattering, withered, lean anatomies! Streps. Curse catch me if you get a bit to eat then! Either yourself, your carriage-horse, or hunter; But out of doors I'll kick you, neck and heels! Pars. The stylish Megacles shall never see me Studless! I'll goânot that I care for you! Exit. SCENE II. Strepsiades solus. Before the Door of the School. I've had a fall; but won't give up the contest,â I'll sooner put my trust in Providence, And go and take to scholaring myself! Though how can I, a thick-sculled, dull old man, Of slippery memory, slow of apprehension, Learn all the subtleties of chopping logic? I must go on, howeverâwhy stand here, then, And hesitate to knock?âBoy! boy! within there! SCENE III. The School. A Disciple of Socrates. Strepsiades Knocking. Disc. Go to the devil with you! who is't knocking? Streps. 'Tis one Strepsiades, from Cicynna. Disc. Some snob, by Jove! some rude, unpolished clown, Who thus unheedfully exerts his heels To batter the reverberating door, And brings miscarriage on the labouring brain, Abortiveness on its sublime conception! Streps. Beg pardon, sirâI live a long way off; But say, what was the thing that so miscarried? Disc. Inhibited is speech except with scholars. Streps. Ne'er fear to speak to me, then! I am come A sort of scholar to the school myself! Disc. I will expound thenâfitting 'tis you learn And be initiated in the mysteries. Socrates had inquired of ChÅrephon As to a fleaâhow many of its paces He thought a flea could leap; for one just then, With morsure satiated of ChÅrephon, Had vaulted to the occiput of Socrates. Streps. And did he measure them? Disc. Oh, beautifully! Of wax he chose a lumpâwhich first exposed To due proportion of caloric, he With nice precision liquefied; and then Grasping the little insect by the back, Deep into the mass its legs the sage immersed. There fitting time he held him, till the wax Its pristine state of density resumed. Forth then he drew the flea; and then, observe The bright effects of skillâits legs were cased In Persian bootsâsuch boots as ladies wear; He pulled these off, and measured them, and thus The size of the flea's sole exactly hit on. Streps. By Jupiter! the 'cuteness of the thing! Is there not, in the original, though not to the degree insisted on in the translation, a clownish bluntness about the thoughts and expressions of the countryman, contrasted with a preciseness and pompous verbosity in those of the student? Disc. Oh! if you knew another demonstration Of Socrates! Streps. I pr'ythee say, what was it? Disc. ChÅrephon proposed to him concerning gnats, As to which theory he most inclined: Whether their powers cantatory reside, Or in their heads, or haply in their tails? Streps. And what was his idea about the gnat? Disc. He said that the intestinal canal Is narrow in the gnatâthat through its form So slender, trumpet-like, cylindrical, The irruent atmospheric fiercely rushesâ That its momentum meets caudine compression And forth results mysterious melody. Streps. The gnat, then, wears his horn upon his tail, Not on his head, like other animalsâ But oh! thrice happy he, supremely blest, In power of intestine-explication! How would he slip the clutches of a bailiff, To justice give the go-bye, and escape The meshes of the lawâwho can discern The twinings of the ileum of a gnat! 1829 &amp; 1832. THE FIRST ODE OF HORACE, PARAPHRASED. Oh thou whose lofty lineage flows In streams where dimless glory glows, Where monarchs shine, in ancient day, Majestic with the Tuscan sway: Thou, sheltered by whose princely power, I calmly pass the careless hour, Thy love at once my pride and pleasure, My treasured glory, darling treasure, MÃ¦cenas! mark with curious ken The various tastes of various men. Some love to whirl with flying car Clouds of Olympic dust afar; And when the wheels have deftly rounded The mark by which their course is bounded, And when th' ennobling palm is given, The Lords of Earth are Kings of Heaven! And some there are whose sole desire Is gained when changeful crowds conspire On their aspiring heads to shower The pomp and pride of civic power. And other bosoms beat no more, When gathered to their private store What reapings rich of golden grain Are largely swept from Lybia's plain. Not all the luxuries wealth could bring, Not all the splendours of a king, Could lure the man, whose joy is still The lands his father left to tillâ Where many a silent summer sun Hath seen him cheerly toiling onâ With timorous awkwardness to brave The raging of the restless wave. The merchant, lapt in rural ease, While yet the dashing of the seas, And howling of the angry breeze The foamy billows buffetingâ In memory's ear discordant ring, Enraptured boasts the scenery sweet, And quiet of his calm retreat. But soon before his dazzled eyes Wealth's glittering visions brightly rise; And little wills he to endure The hardships that await the poor; So fits his waveworn bark again, And dauntless skims the heaving main. Nor wanting some who gaily measure The brimming cup of sparkling pleasure; But little loth to wile away Meet portion of the livelong day, Stretched on the spot of shadow spread By strawberry clustering over-head; Or more reclined, in darker dell, Where rising up with bubbling swell, Some clearly-gushing crystal rill Its sacred stream doth rippling fill. And many a heart with rapture boundeth When the lofty trumpet soundeth, And the silver clarion waketh Ardour nought but battle slaketh! The rolling pride of war's array, The joy intense of deadly frayâ Though they bid the mother's breast Throb with fears which will not rest, Source of fond and deep alarmsâ For many bear resistless charms. The huntsman plies his eager feet, Full reckless or of cold or heat; And well repaid for lost caresses Of her his absence sore distresses, If haply in his far career His hounds espy the fallow deer; Or mazy net give way before The fury of the tusky boar. Me, the wreathÃ«d ivy-bough, Fittest gift for learned brow, Lifts far above a world like this, And wafts into the fields of bliss! Me the silent lonely rove, The dewy freshness of the grove, Across whose darkling shadows glancing, Nymphs are seen with Satyrs dancing; Eluding still the cheated eye, On faÃ«ry footstep flitting byâ Never resting, ever changing, Through each mazy measure rangingâ These, these can win me from among The bustling of the selfish throngâ These, if Euterpe nor refrain, From her sadly-pleasing strain, Nor the many-hymnÃ«d Muse Touch of Lesbian lyre refuse. But if, my friend, you number me, With bards of lyric minstrelsyâ Though far on high the stars may shine, Their glory shall not equal mine, And brilliant though their lustre be, A brighter fame shall welcome me! August, 1829. FRAGMENTS. DEATH. ? ??????, ????? ????? Soph: Ajax. Oh thou, whate'er thou art, whose name Is Terror's trumpet-call! The knell of everything but Fame On this terrestrial ballâ Thou undefined and shadowy Thing, Whose ever-haunting dusky wing Hangs dimly over all,â A moment sweep thy clouds away And stand revealed in open day! I've wondered oft what thou might'st be, Since first my life began, And tried as well to picture thee As Doubt and Darkness canâ And now, e'er yet we close, thou Foe, Whom all engage, yet none o'erthrow, I would thy features scan; And measure well thy breadth and height, Like combatants before they fight. How oft doth charmed childhood read, In Araby's bright lore, Of dangers dark to him decreed, And woes unfelt before, Whose venturous arm should rashly bold Some mystic portal dare unfold; Yet ardour to explore The secrets deep he there might read, Hath nerved him to the desperate deed. And thus, there seems so much to know Which only thou canst teach, Such rest from pain, disgust, and woe, Which none but thou can'st reach, Thou should'st to Reason's eye appear A thing to hope for, not to fear, A blessing to beseech; And man should joy to see thee nigh, And deem it liberty to die. Why was this burning thirst for Fame Into my breast instilled? Why was I born with hope and aim Which ne'er could be fulfilled? Would I were dead!âfor then my breast Would find at least a little rest, This throbbing heart be stilledâ Againâagainâwould I were dead, That I might rest this weary head! And oft, perhaps, on silent night, When all is still and lone, The watery moonbeams, silvery bright, May rest on the cold stone; And I no other tears will crave, No other mourners o'er my grave, Forgotten and unknown! There weeds may grow, there worms may creep, But nought shall break that stirless sleep. April, 1830. A WISH. TO A YOUNG FRIEND. The Lark who sings in the morning air Is happy as happy may be; On wings of joy he rises thereâ May'st thou be as happy as he! The Bee in the stilly summer noon, O'er the bright fields wanders free, And begs of each flower a honied boonâ May'st thou be as happy as he! And when all the sky is dimly chill, And there's nothing but snow to see, At the window the Robin sings happily stillâ May'st thou be as happy as he! And when the fire is blazing bright, As at Christmas is wont to be, The Cricket full blithely chirps at nightâ May'st thou be as happy as he! And so may to thee summer, winter, and spring, Measured many and many times o'er, In this bright world as much of pure happiness bring, Till a brighter shall lure thee to more! December, 1829. IN AN ALBUM. You bid me write, what must appear, Amid these pages bright and gay, A tear, where all are âwreathed smiles,â A âcloud upon a sunny day.â Is it that fond remembrance here May find forgotten scenes againâ As cherished locks of hair remind Of those who're past all joy and pain? If so, should gladness light my life And bright my future fortunes be, This record will but raise a smile, A sneer, in those who coldly see. But if misfortune dim my days, And storm arise and cloud appear, Perhaps it might obtain a sighâ If not too much to askâa tear. Then why require my lonely grief O'er others joy its shade to throw? Why bid me ask a happier heart To share in private selfish woe? Christmas, 1829. COMMONPLACES. I. Our wishes and our wants Keep place with what supplies themâwhat we have We think our own by right, so nought regard it; 'Tis in the actual growth of our possessions, Not in their stationary magnitude, That all the charm of satisfaction lies. The ragged Beggar thinks him fortunate And deeply blest, if on a bed of straw His weary limbs awhile may rest;âthe King Would have another throne to sit upon. The Beggar thinks his poor repast complete If that his mouldy crust of bread be doubled;â The Monarch thinks his rich repast a poor one, Composed of all earth, air or sea may yield In rich profusion spread upon the board. For all is good or bad or great or small But by comparison. We do not say the sun is glorious bright Because his brightness doth eclipse the moon; Nor wonder at the brightness of the moon If that she do outshine a little star; We do not praise the swiftness of the hare Because she far outstrips the crawling tortoise;â Who starts a mile before his adversary, Will have but little cause to bless his fortune Arriving at the goal as soon as he! II. ââand to deem We are not what we should be.ââ Childe Harold. We know the good, and yet we seize it not; See the true path, and yet pursue it not; Discern the brightness of the glancing star, Whose salutary lustre would deliver Our storm-tossed vessel from the waves of sorrow, Yet trust not to its extricating guidance. So wrangle still our wishes with our practice; Conscience and honour, virtuous love of fame, All upward tendings of the emulous heart, Drive like a gusty wind against the tide, The swelling tide of base and low affections, Of all that lures us from the sunbright way Of noble deeds; and so the stream of life Is ruffled only into billows on the surface, Its deeper course unchangedâso jar and tumult And sad commotion of the inward breast Perplex its foamy course. More happy they Whose eyes content have never looked beyond The common aimings of the multitude, Attracted never by the voice of Fame The clear exalted light of fair Renown! They pass ignobly happyâwith the crowd They pass away unheard ofâin obscure Oblivious calm, they live their sluggish death, Nor claim distinction aught, desiring none. III. âHow little do we know the joys we have Until we lose them,ââthen with what regret Discern their value never felt before! The tenant of the chamber, through whose gloom Pale Sickness waves her pleasure-frighting wand, Bidding attendance of her ghastly crew Of pains corporeal, sappers of the mindâ Paints to himself the blessings sweet of Health, Of rosy bounding healthâcompares his heart Languid and sinkingâfaint with long disuse Of cheering breeze, fresh air, and gladsome sun, With his, the unchecked wanderer's, to whom Health lends enlivening buoyancy to choose And taste the joys around. Yet strange to say Though taught by hard experience how good A thing is mere exemption from the ill, So soon her lessons are forgot, we find The good regained no longer good than whilst The ill its absence made could set it off. Once more 'tis ours and we perceive it notâ Its beauty all has vanishedâand again We toil for other blessings, fancy-fired, But to neglect and think them little worth When we have gained them.âThus we live Still toiling on to nothingsâeach fulfilment The worst of disappointments; as in wilds Of burning Africâsullen, herbless wastesâ With cleaving tongue, and weary, fainting step, The traveller strains to reach the false mirage That mocks his thirst with pictured lake, and finds A smooth expanse of still deceptive sand Which baffles him at once to deep despair. Oh when will fancy-flouted man consent To study to enjoy the good he has, Not pant for blessings which he views afarâ To know Possession's worthâthough partial, sure; And Hope's deceitâthough boundless, insecure, Spring, 1830. FRAGMENT OF A CHORUS IN THE AJAX OF SOPHOCLES. Oh thou who possessest that isle of the sea, The wave-beaten Salamisâhappy and freeâ When thy deeds are of glory, thy actions all bright, In thy fame I rejoice, in thy fortune delight! But when thou art stricken by Jove in his wrath, And the threats of the Greeks go terribly forth; As the dove in the greenwood all fearful may be, So, Telamon's son, must I tremble for thee! For reports are abroad that tarnish thy fame, All foul with dishonour, all blackened with shame! They say that thou roamest at night-time alone O'er the thickly-clad fields where the booty is strewn; That on flocks and on herds with inglorious blow Thou dealest the death thou shouldst hurl at the foe, And the sword that an enemy's life-blood should steep, Is but stained with the slaughter of oxen and sheep! But if down with fell swoop like a vulture you come, In an instant all hushed is that clamorous hum, And those babblers so loud in a moment are dumb! 1830. TEARS. âTo them 'tis a reliefâto us a torture.â âDon Juan. The tears of Woman flow from sorrow's source, As mildly as the softest rains from heaven, Which steal so gently downward, and distil Continued drops so fine, you scarce can hear Them meet the shrubs, and not a rose-leaf falls, Though faded, at their downy touch; but soon, Beneath their influence bland, all Nature breathes Fresh sweetness more delightful;ânot so Man's When pride, even pride, fails to restrain the tears, And choking torture will not be repressed, The big drops fall, though stifled half, yet wrung From bitter agony,âthough few, yet fierce And heavy;âlike the firstlings of the storm, Dashed savagely from forth the muttering gloom, That blackly scowls above! Woman's seem given But to add sweetness to the after-smile, As to the clearing beam the gentle rains;â Man's are the dark announcers of the war, The elemental war of pride and passion, Raging with deep and bitter gloom within, Like lightning in the bosom of the cloud. April, 1830. ODE TO THE MATHEMATICS. A CAMBRIDGE EBULLITION. âNor deal (thank God for that!) in Mathematics.â Don Juan. Ye Mathematics! over which I pore Full stolidlyâyet to my sorrow find I cannot fix upon your crabbed lore My scape-grace, wandering, weak, wool-gathering mindâ Oh, are yet not in language plain, a bore, For luckless wight like me a plague refinedâ Ye intellectual catacombsâwhere drones Of many an age have piled up musty bones! We are old foesâyet can't, it seems, be loosed From one another, though we tug the chain Like coupled hounds: I have so oft abused And railed at you, and yet returned again To be by your dark mysteries confused, That at my fate I smile, and friendship fain Would offerâfoes are well-nigh friendly (trust 'em,) Whose regular abuse becomes a custom. They say you lead to grand results, and Science Makes you unto her heaven a Jacob's ladder; So clouded though, we cannot see the sky hence, And black-gowned students are a vision sadder, Nor promise half so much for what they spy hence, As did the white-robed angels Jacob had a Glimpse of;âbut be that as it may, you lead to Things greater far than I can e'er give heed to. You teach the starsâtheir coursesâlike Silenus; See the Sixth Eclogue of Virgil. Teach what the world is set a-going by, And all the eccentricities of Venus; You compass earth and ocean, land and sky; Teach us to argue and to squabble, wean us From base delights (no doubt) to pure and high; You teach mankind all, all that can ennoble 'em;â Meantime I'm staggered by this plaguy problem! 1830. [Oft when I read the lays] â??? ??? ???? ?????.â âFor a Muse is ours too.â Euripides. Oft when I read the lays Of many a deathless bard divine Who shone in other days, I mourn because no Muse is mine, That I no wreathe of song may twine. It little soothes to say, The light of Fame could not illume, Though bright indeed its ray, The joyless, black, neglected gloom, That reigns within the stilly tombâ To say that though the crowd Combine to laud the lofty lay, In wondering worship loud, Its voice would fail to scare away The worm that banquets on our clay! What matter, though Renown Like wreathe of poisonous flowers showâ A rich but fatal crown; Or like the meteor's baleful glow, The dank pestiferous marsh below! What, though experience tells Thou, Genius, art a fearful dower; That Ruin darkly dwells Within thy fairy-seeming bower, And Grief is handmaid to thy power! What, though it be too true That Sorrow oft, and often Care, Thy heritors pursueâ The pain, the death, who would not dare, The everlasting meed to share! To hold in every clime A sunny place in every heart, Down to the end of Time, Into unnumbered souls to dart Our soulâand influence sweet impart! Then Poesy, be mine! And from thine amaranthine bowers A wreath for me entwine, And thou shalt cheer my latest hours, And strew the path of death with flowers! Feb. 1830. STANZAS. âDry be that tear, be hushed that sigh, At least I'll love thee till I die!â Sheridan. âUntil I die!â Oh, could I vow To love thee only till I die? And wouldst thou smile so fondly now, If all my love with life could fly? When from the tomb my soul shall break, From dust and mouldering ashes free, And in the unknown void awake, Where shonld it turn, if not to thee? If love with this day-dream must perish, That sweet exchange no more be known, What hopes immortal can I cherish? Could there be joy when thou wert gone? And if remembrance should remain, And waft the vivid thoughts above, Of all the dear delightful pain Of earth's affection, human loveâ Oh, could thine image ever fly?â My soul would cease to love thee never; It could not rest, it would not die, But dying live to mourn for ever! Oh, no! there is no heaven without thee; My only heaven, above, below, In all its glory hangs about thee; The rest is changeless, endless woe! Sept. 1830. FRAGMENT. Oh! they who soonest sink to sadness, Are soonest warmed again to gladness! And brightest joys that heart illume, Which sometimes wears the deepest gloom; As flowers, whose life is frailest, fleetest, In growth and bloom are quickest, sweetest! March, 1830. TO A LADY. WITH A FAN FROM CHINA. Go, fanâthy journey's almost overâ In many a clime, o'er many a sea, Long hast thou been a weary rover, But brighter days are waiting thee! Yet shouldst thou love thy fortune dearly, Couldst thou by wandering far and free, Through dangers threatening more severely, Serve her whom thou art soon to see! But thy reward shall be thy duty, And own how much that duty blesses; To bathe in freshness beaming beauty, And wave her glossy raven tresses! Before thee flies the glow invading That cheek so fair and brow so bright, Like rosy hues of sunset fading Before the cooling winds of night! Go then, all meaner breezes scorning, The richest seek that ever blew; The fresh cool air of April morning All bright with mist and glittering dew! The sweet airs Araby discloses, That spicy land of golden dreaming,â Or lovely Cashmere's fields of roses; Or Jordan's groves with jasmine teeming! Onâon! Ã¤erial depths exploring, The purely subtle breeze pursue, Which bears aloft the eagle, soaring Through Alpine skies intensely blue! Nor rest thee yetâthose airs assemble Which Seraphs' radiant wings diffuse, When bliss ecstatic makes them tremble, All sparkling with a thousand hues! Goâgoâlet toil nor trouble stay thee, For if thou chance her breath to meet, That breath at once will richly pay thee, Thou canst bestow no airs so sweet! Yet haply, after all, 'twere better To spare thy search through sky and plain, Whose richest breathings leave thee debtorâ And waft her back her own again! Sept. 1830. TO ?. When the Moon shines in the lucid sky, Silently and still; Like beauty's sadly-musing eye, Which the bright tears fillâ How the melting hush, like a spell, Doth the soul disarm, And the breath is restrainÃ«d well, Lest it break the charm! So when we gaze with joy intense, On that radiant face, And the pure soft light of innocence In its features traceâ How its still sweet serenity O'er the spirit steals; Till the heart dare not breathe to thee Of the love it feels! 1830. WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM. Oh, who shall describe me this Album of thine!â 'Tis the heart's turnpike-gate, where its minions pay toll; It is Love's table-d'hote, where her votaries dineâ Of the forces of Friendship the muster-roll! Of the murderer's cairn it is just the reverseâ To that every comer contributes a stone; But a token of hate is left there, and a curse, While by what is left here, it is love that is shown! Here all feelings are found, sad, sober, or quizzical; Here all tastes, and all sects, and all authors agree; From romantic and light to the dark metaphysical, There is room for them all, whatever they be! Here the stately and orthodox Ãpiscopalian Sits peaceably down by his brother dissenting; And with Chalmers or Irving, comes Sherlock or Paley on; While Ephraim on Judah no venom is venting. Here with spinners of poetry, psalm-spinners soar, Or try to, alas! though their steeds often stumble; And Watts comes with Byron, and Doddridge with Moore, And âtake up their songsâ without ever a grumble. Here cold Common-Sense for poor Sentiment sickly, Lays aside most humanely its sneer or its frown; So the leopard in days of Millennium, quickly With the kid shall politely and meekly lie down. Here the old poet's lay shines so quaint and so curious, Like a sweet simple flower that should bloom by itself; And more modern songs blaze hereâextravagantâfuriousâ Like the nosegays that stare on a kitchen-maid's shelf. Here the aged folks tender both prayers and advice, And the young ones prate sweetly of feeling and passion; While here and there glows of description a spice, From the bard whose effusions are just then in fashion. Here with crumbs of morality, gayest young ladies Each other devoutly and tenderly cheer, And convince us that all for which Albums are made, is To keep up their courage in virtue's career. And some bring conceits most facetious and pleasant; Some with saddest of sentiment coo like a pigeon illâ And some (like the writer who's scribbling at present) Would, no doubt, if they could, be considered original. Some draw, sketch, or paint, to embellish the plan, Ships, houses, or cattle, men, women, or treesâ They do it, of course, not to show that they can, But to prove how they long the fair owner to please. And all ere they write turn over the pages With quizzical smile and sarcastic remark; And hint doubtful things of complexions and ages, And are still most severe when they're most in the dark. And then from the writing how shrewd are the guesses What the writer may be, both in body and mind; If he's steady or gayâhow he looks, or she dresses, With nicest sagacity all is divined. There are some who write stiffly like school-boys in dread Of the rod of the masterâwhile others more knowing Will affect a bad hand that can scarcely be read, A genteel, superior, indifference showing. And look at the neat hand of gentle feminitieâ (So pointedly delicate irony should be!) She who writes so ethereally must be divinity, Nor less than an angel in petticoats could be! But whoe'er to this chaos, than Milton's more motley, May contribute his mite, should remember this chiefly, Be it gaily or sadly, or coldly or hotly, (More wise than this writer) he had better write briefly! October, 1830. WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM. The raindrop on the lily lying, Tells that a gloomy cloud hath past; Its hour of birth beholds it dying, Though on so sweet a pillow cast. And such appears this verse's lotâ For sad and dark the heart that leaves it; And just as soon 'twill be forgot; Although a fairer flower receives it! October, 1830. LINES. The Stars their watch are keepingâ But the midnight Taper's burning; And through the window peeping, Their light there's no discerning! But hide the taper's gleamingâ And in all their conscious glory The mystic brilliants beaming, In thousands rise before ye! So, when dazzled by the pleasures Which here we love so dearly, Heaven's brighter, purer treasures We can ne'er distinguish clearly. But when the sweetest flowers In the heart's rich wreath are faded, When Affection flies her bowers, And Hope's sunlight is shadedâ With purer gaze and fonder, No lights of Earth obscuring, On Heaven we love to ponder, And woo its joys enduring. October, 1830. ON THE BIRTH OF A NEAR RELATION. Fountain of an endless River, Mighty stream from scanty source, Flowing once, to flow for ever, All Eternity thy course! Joyful be the path thou cleavest, Through Life's dull ravine, whose bed, From the champain broad thou leavest, Tends to that far on ward spread! Oh! would Reason have us mourning O'er the much-loved new-born boy? Stern Experienceâis she warning, Birth may not be cause for joy? Does she say, âAway with gladness! Woe is oft the world's best fare; He must eat the bread of sadness, Often drink the cup of care?â Noâthere must be so much blessingâ So much âroseâ without the âthorn,â As will make it not distressing That an heir to earth is born! Sayâbecause its leaves have faded, Would you wish the Rose unblown? Since by clouds he may be shaded, Wish no Sun had ever shone?â Ask the Mother, when her Treasure Warm she presses to her heart, Fondly thinking of the pleasure It doth to its sire impart! Ask the Father, whose affection Glows, as he beholds them, there, Doubly claiming that protection Which they cannot seek elsewhere! Poets tell us, seraphs mingle Wholly, when in heaven they love, In etherial essence singleâ Clay divides not hearts above. Such the union parents gather, When in one fair child they trace All the mother, all the father, Beaming in its beauteous face! Oh! the hopes that then they cherishâ Do they lure them but to leave them? Must their golden visions perish? Do they shine but to deceive them? Must we ask when years have found him, When long years have passed away, Will he give to all around him Joy, like that he gives to-day? No! away with doubts unpleasantâ Let us hope and wish the best! Reap the joy that gilds the presentâ Why should man regard the rest? Let us wish a heart supplied him, Ardent as the steed's careerâ While the head shall curb and guide him Deftly as the charioteer! To the last may youth's quick feeling Make life's dullest scenery brightâ Age from hearts no freshness stealing, They create their own delight! Shall we wish the power given Fancy's fairy dreams to gild? Yesâand we shall wish him heaven If we wish those dreams fulfilled. Oh! may real Honour charm him; Glory, made by Virtue fair! To be first, Ambition warm him, Sense direct him how and where! Thus with head and heart agreeing, May he aim at Reason's mark; All things on their bright side seeing, Cheerly bear with what is dark! And o'er all be free Health sparklingâ Head, or heart without, I ween, Are like lovely landscapes darkling, Without sun to make them seen! Father! may he ever lend thee All the joy thou feelest nowâ Each succeeding summer send thee Happier heart and brighter brow! Mother! all thy fond caressing May his future years repayâ May'st thou deem him then a blessing, Such as he appears to-day! November 7, 1830. GREEK SONG. COMMONLY ASCRIBED TO ALCÃUS. ?? ?????? ????? ?? ????? ??????. ?. ?. ?. Twined with myrtle I will bear The sword that Freedom bids me wear! So Aristogeiton bore it, So the brave Harmodius wore it, When they slew the Tyrant-slave And Freedom's laws to Athens gave! Thou art not, loved Harmodius, dead! Though that day thy spirit fled, Dead thou canst not, shalt not be! Thou art living, thou art free, Where AchillesâTydeus rest, In the Islands of the Blest! Twined with myrtle I will bear The sword that Freedom bids me wear! So Aristogeiton wore it, So beloved Harmodius bore it, When they did the Tyrant slay On Minerva's festal day! Never fades their glory, never!â Brightly shall thy fame for ever Brave Aristogeiton, shine, And beloved Harmodius, thine, Because ye slew the Tyrant-slave, And Freedom's laws to Athens gave! Nov. 20, 1830. [Whence is it mountains, forests, fields, and floods] âIt lightensâit brightens The tenebrific scene!â âBurns. Whence is it mountains, forests, fields, and floods Hold o'er the Mind of Man such influence strange? Whence is it Nature's soul hath power Its lights and shadows to impart To man's chameleon-fashioned heart, Which throbs in unison with her great moods, And takes her Spirit's hues which vary every hourâ True to her every change? Why is it, Morn, and Noon, and Eve, The starry Night, the golden Day, Can sadden, cheer, depress, beguile, Each with peculiar sway? Whence may it be Some weather makes it difficult to grieve, In some we scarce can smile? Or why are we So often gay, or sad, or proud, As sun prevails, or rain or cloud?â Why it is, I cannot tell, But this I know full well, There is a spell Can make the tinkling rain Which patters on the windows, seem Melodious as the musing streamâ Make the low-moaning wind dispute With the sweetly-stealing lute; The wind and rain Both strive in vain To fling o'er fine-strung hearts their dark desponding chain! It is the beauty of a certain cheek, Of eyes in which the pensive soul doth speak; It is the sweetness of a certain face Where softness sits serene, and purity and grace! The soft, the downy hand, Timid, unresisting, warmâ The smile affectionateâthe undesigning glanceâ These, these can charm The heavy Heart to joy, the moody Mind entrance! Ay! let the Sun refuse his lightâ Love's dullest day is still with more than sunshine bright! And let the Cloud descend in gloomâ With inborn radiance Love can murkiest sky illume! The scenes which Love has lighted Are never darkened more; But Memory backward-flighted, Doth on their glory pore! For, as the Rocket's track is seen, Gemmed with drops of starry sheen, Though dark the path, or rude or meanâ Love leaves a trail of light wherever he hath been! March, 1831. âGOOD BYE.â No poesy this page can showâ It tells not âtearâ nor âsigh;â Nor sentiment nor pathos boastsâ It only says âGood bye!â And when beyond the deep sea far, This record meets thine eye, Remember, 'mid thy many friends That I too said âGood bye.â 1830. ['Twas in the twilight onceâand Sorrow's shadow lay] âWhile yet in truth I knew not why Nor wherefore I am sad!â âKirke White. 'Twas in the twilight onceâand Sorrow's shadow lay Heavily on my mindâ I knew not whence she came, nor why, Where she could entrance findâ It was as creeping Mists diffuse them o'er the sky With progress unperceived and mute, And sweep the stars away! A moment back, and every star, Most faintly palpitating in remotest cell, Minutely trembling with delight irregular, Might be discovered well! Now, all is one dim, wide, unbroken shroud, No shape distinct, no form of Cloud! So stole upon my heart that deeply-brooding Shade And all its stars unrayed; Yet seemed no Grief particular in kind, No single feeling certainly displayed, No sad thought well-defined! The fire was burning faint and lowâ The bubbling flames meandering slow, Their quiet converse held; The falling coals at intervals a crumbling murmur made; Upon the dusky ceiling, to and fro, The shadow of the chimney-piece With fitful throbbing playedâ The ceiling's glimmer answered still the flitting flame below; So the harmonious workings of the Brain Keep time and tune, in thought and strain, With every feeling which the Heart doth burningly contain! As in the silence, deep, distinct, I listened to the quiet fire âLONG AGO,â ADDRESSED TO ? I. Long ago!âlong ago! How heavily on the heart The simple accents flow!â Yet is there music in the sound, A witching charm not elsewhere found, That makes us love the woe! II. How at the words Imagination fond Flies to the Pictures of the Past, In Memory's gallery cast It ought perhaps to be stated, that at the time of writing the above, the author had not perused Mr. Tennyson's exquisite little volume of Poems, in one of which the same phrase occurs.; Which, like the gloomy clouds that dimly hang Motionless, in skies of grey, And seem to threaten less than they despondâ Pause ere they pass away. Each aspect of what once has been May there with sad delight be seenâ The light and shade of years of oldâ And many an hour in sunshine or in rain, Of sport, employment, mirth or pain, With melancholy joy beheld again! III. But where's the pen By which the difference can be told 'Twixt now and then! The hopes, the fears, The smiles, the tears, The fond pursuits of other years, Are past and gone! Our interest in them done. The friends that once were dear Have long in silence ebbed awayâ And every-thing that once was all in all Does trifling now appearâ Remembered scarce to-day. We needs must mourn their transient sway, And yet cannot but love whatever may remain Of feelings, forms, and scenes that we Through life and long Eternity Can never meet again! IV. The Soul where'er her sunny home Mingles with it, fondly clings, And lovingly her tendrils flings On all the beauties round; And though perhaps compelled to roam, And though another home be found, She loves full oft to fly on Memory's wings, And mournfully renew her former communings. V. The Earth, the glorious gladsome Earthâ From her our soul-linked clay had birth! And when her magic influence steals The Heart, what is it that it feels But the Child's longings, ill-exprest Deep yearnings for its Mother's breast, There to be again at rest! In these renewals of her power, Earth recalls our natal hour, Stirs us with mysterious might, And reasserts her primal right. And wherever Love hath been Between us and some olden scene, Nature will not let it die, But rebinds the broken tie, Revives the drooping sympathy, And makes it sweet our view to cast O'er long-closed pages of existence past! VI. The Present is a Mine, From which we dig the mingled ore, Rude though it be and gross;â Then Time extracts the worthless dross, And leaves it dull no more! And then the rich, refinÃ«d hoard, In the coffers of the Past is stored, Where in radiant rows they stand, Arranged for pensive Memory's handâ A fairer show, Than e'er did glow In gorgeous faÃ«ry tale of sweet Arabia's land. VII. The Present is a Stream, That sweeps along, a varying tideâ Now dancing on in Pleasure's beam, Now tost by Passion, swoln by Pride! And troubled waves of Strife are there, And bitter waves of Grief and Care!â Dim with Woe or foul with Crime, These are filtered well by Time! He finds a torrentâturbid, wildâ He leaves a lake, transparentâmild! Then, in some silent hour, When nature sinks in deep repose, In summer's sultry noon; Or when a stillness more intense she knows, And swims in tears the weary Moon;â The first, the rapturous Sleep of Joy, Faint with its own excessâ The last, the musing Wakefulness of Woe, Full, full of tendernessâ In such an hour comes Memory there Her golden cup to fill; And dipping in the streamlet fair, Quaffs with serenest joy the clearly-gushing rill. VIII. Then why the deeds of Time Complainingly decry? Why say that all his triumphs Only ask a sigh? All the victories of years Merit jubilees of tears? Why declare He will not spare Aught save relics here and there, Crumbling fragments, passing fair! That he only leaves behind The simpleâthe sublimeâ And all-enduring Records of the Majesty of Mind! Pillar and stone and column gray Melt beneath his touch away! See how in ruin forlornly they standâ Mournfully lingering all aloneâ Sighing for a world that's gone! Why tarry they here in a Stranger-land, With a race that knows them not? Their eloquent stillness seems to say They would follow those who are past away, Those who joyed in their loveliness ages ago, But have forsaken them in their woe, Left them to decay! IX. And must we thus in melancholy tone All the deeds of Time bemoan? Cheerlessly in him behold Circumfluous Ocean ruinous round all Creation rolledâ Silent, ever-pressing zone Wrapping in corrosive fold This rotund World with life encrusted; Till Titanean Might o'erthrown Beauty blighted, Glory rustedâ New is old, and old is gone, The things that are, are things that wereâthe things that were, unknown? We will take a brighter view Of the deeds that Time can do! View him slowly veiling Sadness, Mellowing the hues of Gladness; Making Danger's memory dear, Softening what was harsh, when near; Turning, like the King of old, All things, by his touch, to gold! 'Tis his refining hand can make Our weary Days the semblance take Of moonlit waves in a vessel's wakeâ Dark while around they dash in spray, Not lighted up till they're past away! He teaches those who do not spurn The Sadness of Delight, From what is to what was to turn, And oft in vision not unpleasant, By dreamy day or stirless night, Chequer the gloom that purples o'er the Present With the Past's mild streaks of light! X. Roll on, then, swift Days, roll! Be ye dark, or be ye bright, Be whate'er it may your goalâ Is it not a treasure To discover in your flight But material of pleasure, Increase of delight?â But stayâmethinks I hear you sayâ âWhither, whither will you stray? Sure this idle, rambling rhyme Wasteth words and loseth time! To you whatever it may be Small interest it can have for me!â Shall I tell a simple plan Will do more than fancy can? Give it interest for you, Haply make you read it through?â List!âthe spell you soon shall knowâ Deem it idle, rambling rhyme, Waste of words and loss of time; Only wait, though many a day, And pass it by, till you can say âIt was written long ago!â April, 1831. ON BEING ASKED TO WRITE IN AN ALBUM. A meteor oft from earth will bound To sparkle in the sky, And with eternal worlds around A while may cheat the eye. But soon it glides down heaven's face, In death repenting late; It little knew its proper place, And all deride its fate! And can I wonder if the same Success await on me, Inserting numbers here, which claim But little melody? Here, where the Great Ones of the Lyre Undying music bring, Thoughts tangible, and words of fireâ Should I attempt to sing?â Oh, no! but be not mine the wrong, Since mine is not the choosingâ For when âthe Fair commands the song,â There can be no refusing! April, 1831. ANOTHER. A glow worm circled round with stars, With fairest flowers a weedâ Such similes did in my mind To your request succeed. I had not written could it seem, I deemed that aught of mine Were worth a place where Lords of Song In dimless splendour shine! But well I know, as from the Moon A radiant beam is thrown Which lends the rudest, meanest scene, A beauty not its ownâ So, haply, Friendship's partial eye A moment glancing o'er, May find a worth in this poor page It could not boast before! And who will blame the meanest bard, Or turn displeased away, If, tempted by the rich reward, He thus insert his lay? April, 1831. TO AGNES. AN HISTORICAL REFLECTION. Herodotus says, a custom prevailed among some tribes of the ancient Scythians, of prohibiting the marriage of their virgins till they had killed an enemy in battle. The rovers of old Scythia's plain A curious custom had, 'tis said; No maid till she a foe had slain Was e'er allowed to wed. Now think you, gentle Agnes, what Had been your fate had you lived thenâ Sure your's had been a luckless lot, Among those savage men! Hard doom! that one so sweet, so fair, Unloved, unwedded should remain, Because her kind heart could not bear To give another pain!â And yet methinks one way had still Been left, your fortune to redressâ For you would pierce all hearts, and kill By very gentleness!â 1831. STANZAS. (A BIT OF BIRTH-DAY MORBIDEZZA.) This day it was my life begunâ And small my joy in looking back Along the course which I have runâ A dreary track! A restless, frantic war with fate, Or calm disgustâtoo calm by far! The sullen, sluggish Peace, whose weight Is worse than War; When mad Despair gives up the strife With ills with which 'twere vain to copeâ And rebel pride sends love of life To follow Hope!â The wasting of the aimless breastâ Hopes waxing but to wane in Griefâ The listless mien to cloak unrestâ Poor, poor relief! Each day endured, as what conveyed A chance of change, though bringing none; Each day a burden while it stayed, A grief when gone!â I should be young, to date by yearsâ But bounding hopes, and fancies gay, The generous warmthâthe ready tearsâ Where, where are they?â Once Love made common day divineâ And once I thrilled with thirst of Fameâ To make the general mention mine, The deathless name!â Those sanguine dreams of youth are goneâ The tinge of glory all things wore; Truth, mournful truth, remains aloneâ Illusion's o'er! The dreary past I would forgetâ And with the future calmly cope; The first has nothing for regretâ The last, for hope!â My earlier birth-days brought delightâ My later little else than griefâ No more the coming year looks bright, The past one, brief! One grief is mine to-dayâto see So much remains of wretched breath; One sad delightâso much to be The nearer Death. May, 1831. FLOWERS. âTo me the meanest Flower that blows, can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears!â Wordsworth. I. Flowers, though of texture inexpressible, woven though they be of a mystic woof, are yet the Birth-day Apparel of Earthâher Raiment of Gladsomenessâher Festival-Drapery! Her Virgin-Zone of Beauty they wereâher Matron-Stole of Loveliness they are, but she putteth them off in the days of her Widowhood!â Her Children too are theyâthe dear ones of her heartâbut old Winter frighteneth them! II. Who shall tell out the colours of their Glory? to what will ye liken the richness of their Odours?âmingling yet separately perceived they come,â like the hues of the Rainbow, that Wedding-ring of Sunlight and Cloud-gloomâlike the streaks on the blade of the sheeny Striped-grassâlike the colours of an eddying Bannerâlike Love. III. Flowers and Female Beauty, peers in their peerlessness, though hardly in their tarriance;âtheir brief existence the theme of Songâtheir coming and going in eternal alternation, waxing and waning in their bloom and decay, like the brightness and dimness of an ever-revolving Beacon-light at seaâpreserving the while such mysterious silenceâmay well be the subject of marvel and earnest curiosity. IV. The expressions of Flowers, as various and striking as though they were animated by indwelling Spirits, who made them their radiant Resting-placesâtheir pure Pavilionsâtheir silent Homes! V. And oh that they had voice to explain the feelings which cause their diverse expressionsâas the sky-roamer hath!âcertes, it would be both sweet and strangeâstrange as the murmuring of the Spirit of the Seashellâstrange as the melody of the finger-invoked Genie of the Handglass, breathing forth his deep unearthly churming;âsoft, as the footstep of a silver cloudâas the sound of melting snow,âas the fall of glittering dewâas the flickering of troubled gossamers, glancing in the Summer noontide airâsubtleâevanescent! VI. And harmoniously would they discourseâhaply of high regrets, and sorrowings after glorious and forfeited thingsâof lasting melancholy; haply of transient sadnessâof private and passing afflictionsâof griefs of every-day! VII. Flowers sympathise ever with usâshare in our Triumphâlend their gaiety to our Joy, and soothe us when Sorrow is nearâthey are tender and pureâand tranquil in gladnessâand calm in grief! VIII. And mournfully and strangely doth contrast with their tranquillity our restlessnessâour âpining for what is notââour ambition and unsatisfying speculationsâour toiling after shadowsâour âlooking before and afterâ âour regretâour anxiety! IX. And are they not, then, silent and delicate Teachers of the Littleness of Wealth and Fame and Power and Praise?âand meek and shining exemplars of extremes avoided and content attained?â PART THE FIRST. What are ye, lovely Flowers? Flowers, though of texture inexpressible, woven though they be of a mystic woof, Sense and Reason say, Your nature is like ours, Ye are formed of clay; They, methinks, cannot be rightâ Ye are so delicate and bright! The Lightâit is your Mother, are yet the Birthday apparel of Earth, her raiment of Gladsomenessâher Festival-Drapery! And your foodâit is the Dew; The Rainbow is your Brotherâ He is most like you! Born of Light and gentle Rain, Both are free from earthly stain! Ye are Stars, besprinkling Her Virgin-zone, of Beauty they were, her Matron-stole of Loveliness they are, The broad expanse of Earthâ In coloured radiance twinkling, but she putteth them off in the days of her widowhood. Filling her with mirth! Her form in all-hued robes ye swathe, Her limbs in precious odours bathe! Her revolving motion Her children too are theyâthe dear ones of her heart, Ye follow with delight; Plunge down into the Ocean Of Darkness, every night; And up again with her returning, Freshly greet the Day-light burning! When dark Winter neareth, but old Winter frighteneth them! From Earth's face ye fly, As when dawn appeareth Stars fade off the sky! Scattered drops of light, ye fear, Touch of one so cold and drear. So the Poet's visions, Sweet imaginings, Shrink from all collisions With cold, worldly thingsâ Aught less high and warm than they, Sweeps them from his mind away! PART THE SECOND. Sweet is the dazzling whiteness Who shall tell out the colours of their Glory? Of the Maiden's brow; Sweet is the azure brightness Of her meek eyes' glow; Her lip's geranium-redâthe flush Of her modest, mantling blush; Sweet are the dyes adorning A tropic Bird's array; The coloured clouds of Morning, The tints of rising Day; And sweet the Sun-set to beholdâ The crimson, and the water-gold! Sweet are the tinges, glowing Through the bright green tide, From Coral-reefs up-growing Like gardens petrifiedâ Sweet and gay the rich sea-flowers Which crown those insect-pilÃ«d towers! Yesâsweet are these, and many Hues of Earth and Air, But I know not any May with yours compareâ With the million-coloured bloom These gems of upper Earth assume! Odours from you pouring to what will ye liken the richness of their odours? Gush deliciously; Such rich fragrance showering, mingling they come, yet separately perceived, like the hues of the Rainbow, that Wedding-ring of Sunlight and Cloudgloomâlike the streaks on the blade of sheeny stripedgrassâlike the colours of an eddying Bannerâlike Love. That the sense would be Delighted to drink in the river Of refreshing scent for ever! In your posies pleasant, Distinct, although combining, Each sweet scent is presentâ Like the intertwining Voices of a choir, around Dispensing silver threads of sound; Like that combination Which young bosoms proveâ Brilliant constellation Of fond feelingsâLove! Every Star in lustre blent Of the Soul's deep firmament! In that mighty Ocean Of mixed tenderness, No wave-like Emotion Is discerned the less; Each in different form and fashion Adding to the Tide of Passion. All the Love that dwelleth In the Parent's breast; All that simply swelleth In the child confest; Love of Sister, Brother, Friend, Distinctly in the Lover blend. All the ties Protection On either side can raise, Humble, proud affection, Serving while it swaysâ Oh the sheaves that Lovers bind Of golden ears of Feelings kind! PART THE THIRD. Maidens everywhere Hold with you communion; Flowers and female beauty, peers in their peerlessness, though hardly in their tarriance; their brief existence the theme of song; Both are pure and fair, And that simple union Makes them cherish and befriend you, And like younger sisters tend you. I know how poets often Your short lives bewail; And their sweet lays soften To a tender tale, As they tell how Beauty too, Dies almost as soon as you. We have earthly creatures So purely clear and bright, That their tender features Seem melting into Light! Transparent cheek and sunny tress Often mock your loveliness. Yet beauty in the Maiden Will last until the heart Of its love may be unladen; And when it does depart We miss it notâfor then we dieâ You, while our love is freshest, fly!â Many an anxious query, their coming and goingin eternal alternationâwaxing and waning in their bloom and decay, like the brightness and dimness of an ever-revolving beacon-light at seaâpreserving the while such mysterious silenceâmay well be the subject of marvel and earnest curiosity. Mysteries without clue, Till the mind is weary, Rise, on watching youâ What may be your end and aim, Where ye go, or whence ye came? Why your races gay, In silence fast succeeding, Comeâsmileâand pass away, To oblivion speeding? Why ye are so lovely made, So lovely, if so soon to fade? Oh that I could sing you In a strain undyingâ I would rather bring you Life, than mourn your flying; Not lament in idle lay, But bid you bloom till Time decay. PART THE FOURTH. And yet if we could make you Lasting as ye're fairâ Many a summer wake you Fresh as now ye areâ Should we, gazing on you so, Have no more to ask or know? Oh there are deeper feelings To both of us belong Than may have revealings Or in prose or songâ There is such infectious power In the sadness of a Flower! Some of you smile gladly, The expressions of Flowers, as various and striking Some look coy and shy; Some seem grieving sadly As the Moon on high, When she floateth, full of sighs, Asking some to sympathise! Whence could ye inherit Expressions all so true?â as though they were animated by indwelling spirits, I am sure that Spirit Must reside in you, For amidst your simple sheening, There are looks so full of meaning! Not the honey-gatherer only Dives into your cells, And insects not alone lie In your cups and bellsâ In your fragrant, tiny breasts, Spirits must have made their nests! As in olden ages It was idly thought By romancing sages, That our Spirits sought, When their human life had ceased, Ignoble home in bird or beastâ So, perhaps, when weary who made them their radiant resting places, their pure pavilions, their silent homes! Of their forms of fire, May the souls of Peri, Into you retireâ If such After-homes were ours, Might not they migrate to Flowers? Or do Smiles, long vanished, Sighsâforgotten tooâ From our bosoms banished, Fly at last to you, And enshrined there, teach you how To mimic all our feelings now? PART THE FIFTH. When I see you grieving Grief attacketh me; 'Tis beyond believing That just cause can be, And oh that they had voice to explain the feelings which cause their diverse expressions, Cruel Sorrow should not spare Things so innocent and fair! What are your distresses? Wherefore do you sigh? Vainly Fancy guesses, Idly would replyâ For your speaking looks alone Make your gentle sorrows known! To the Wind that wingeth as the sky-roamer hath! The Profound of Heaven, Is a lyre that singeth All its feelings given; Now in revelry loud-ringing, Now low-moaning sweetness flinging! It tells how breezes sorrow, Tells how they rejoiceâ Would that we could borrow Such an echoing voice, certesâit would be both sweet and strangeâ For the hidden thoughts which dower The mystic muteness of a Flower! Oh, Woman's voice is dearest, strange as the murmuring of the Spirit of the sea-shellâ strange as the melody of the finger-invoked Genie of the hand-glass, breathing forth its deep unearthly Churmingâsoft as the foot-beat of a silver cloud, as the sound of the melting snow, as the fall of the glittering dewâas the flickering of troubled gossamersâglancing in the summer noontideâsubtle, evanescent! And sweet beyond compare! To hers in beauty nearest Birds' merry warblings areâ Sweetly too the summer fly Murmureth an instant by! But what were sweetest trilling Of insect, bird or maiden, To that a Flower were willing Its soul should be conveyed in? The tones a Flower would choose, to express All its joy and its distress! Sound of Chaffinch weaving Her moss-fibred nest; Sound of Bees upheaving Waxen cells of rest; Feathers rustling in the wing Of a bright Moth fluttering; Sound of Motes a-dancing In the slant sunbeam, Floatingâturningâglancingâ Rude and harsh would seem, Harsh and rude all these would be, To a Flower's euphony! PART THE SIXTH. Mutely would we listen To your meek complaining; And our eyes would glisten, Tears of pity raining, And harmoniously would they discourse, As ye did in silver tone Make your gentle sorrows known. And then you would declare haply ofhigh regrets, and sorrowings after How, you could not smile In a World so fair, Filled with woe and guileâ How, you cannot cease to mourn That for which you first were born! How some of you have ever Wept for fallen Manâ How some of you have never Looked otherwise than wan Since ye drew your timid eyes glorious and forfeited things, From a sinless Paradise! And how ye still remember Those olden glories well; of lasting melancholy; And how Tradition's ember Glimmers yet to tell How happy once, ye lived and grew In Eden light, on Eden dew! Or you would discover haply, of transient sadness, Tales of simpler sorrow; Grief would soon be over And forgot to-morrow; Haply tell us how your tears Fall for humbler pains and fears; How some bee has slighted One whom oft his kisses of private and passing afflictions, And his song delighted; How, another misses Warmly-wooing, faithless breezesâ of griefs of everyday! And their coldness sore displeases! How fate too far removed you From sunlightâovershaded; How some Flower that loved you Prematurely fadedâ How it is for Love that ye Droop your heads so pensively!â These and more distresses Would your sweet plaint swellâ But vainly Fancy guesses What you cannot tell; For, alas! your looks alone Make your gentle sorrows known! PART THE SEVENTH. Poet's happy carol Flowers sympathise ever with us, Wreath of Flowers earneth; Hero from high quarrel Flower-crowned returneth: Hero bold, and Poet too, share in our triumph, Half their Triumph owe to you! Flowers on Bridal Morning lend their gaiety to our joy, Heighten gladsomeness; Dear ones' graves adorning and soothe us when sorrow is near;â Soothe our deep distress: You smile with us when we are glad, And you weep when we are sad! Lambs in joyaunce lowly they are tender and pure Share your simple grace; Dove-like melancholy In some of you we traceâ Doves and Lambs of herbal kindâ Sometimes sadâalway resigned! Passions in you glow not, and tranquil in gladness, Which we could reproveâ Hate and guile ye know not, Ye are full of Love! Calm your tears as is your gladnessâ That is tender as your sadness! and calm in grief. Pride ye haveâbut harmlessâ Envyâye have noneâ There is nothing charmless, Which ye do not shunâ There is nothing pure and sweet Misseth your serene retreat! PART THE EIGHTH. Guide us, tranquil Flowers, And mournfully and strangely doth contrast with their tranquillity To your springs of Quietâ Anxious Care is ours, And distressing Riot; Our joys are troubled at the bestâ Our repose is seldom rest! our restlessness; We dream of Worlds of FaÃ«ry, Joys which cannot beâ our âpining for what is not;â And weepâbecause they vary From the ones we see; You pass your lives exempt from pain, Content with what ye may attain. Thought and high desireâ All the Pride of Mind; our ambition Thirst for something higher Than 'tis ours to find: These our chance of Quiet mar, Because our Will and Power jar. Mysteries of deep wonder Ever hang about us, and unsatisfying speculations; Enticing us to ponder, Only then to flout usâ You live happily and well By clinging to the visible! We toilâand discontent our toiling after shadows, Is often all we win; Your lives are gladlier spent, Who toil not, neither spin! our âlooking before and after,' We grieve o'er all the Pastâand sorrow our regret, our anxiety! O'er that which may be ours Tomorrow! Oh then, sweet ones, guide us To your Springs of Quiet! Care has sorely tried usâ We are sick of Riotâ And would fain know where they be, Those Fountains of Tranquillity! PART THE NINTH. As the Sunbeams lighten Chambers of the Deep, And are they not then silent and delicate teachers All my breast ye brighten, All my bosom steep In thoughtâdelightful Calm bestowing Till my eyes are overflowing! Why then toil for treasure, Gold and Silver so?â I have store of pleasure of the littleness of wealth Long as Flowers blow; Joys that pall not may be mine While dew falls, or sunbeams shine Teach me not to languish Any more for Fame; and fame, and power and praise, Not to quail at Anguish, Wild Delight to tameâ Take what happiness I may, and meek and shining exemplars of extremes avoided and content attained? Bidding lofty Thoughts away! I will ask no praisesâ Friendshipsâvery few; Power in me raises No wish to pursue; Sunny fieldsâblue skiesâthe lyreâ These are all that I require! Let me live as ye, Happy Flowers, do; Love my Sunlight beâ Poesy my Dew; Love and song all wants supply Till tranquilly as you I die! 1831. A SIMILE. When placid is the Lake, And not a breath of air With smile-like ripple doth its silver surface break, The Heavens, mirrored there, A glorious picture make, Doubled in every change of brilliant, foul or fair. And so my heart shall be A Lake wherein shall glow The true reflection of its lovely Heaven, thee! And all thy clouds of Woe And stars of Joy shall see Their sweet forms imaged in my watchful breast below. And as the Lake remains Itself unseen, unknown, Its only features those which from the Heavens it gains,â My heart shall of its own No pleasures and no pains, No joys, no hopes possess, but throb with thine alone. And as the lake-born sky Combines with that above, To form one sphere complete of beauty deep and highâ My heart and thine shall prove A double unity, A two-fold single sphere of happiness and love! September, 1831. THE BROKEN TRYST. Alas! poor lady! desolate and leftâ Two Gent. of Verona, What! all alone desponding, Fairest, quite alone? Love's adoring minions, Vanished, every one! None to praise the tangles Of thy jetty hair, And brokenly to tell thee, Thou art very fair! To draw thy breath in sighingâ To kiss thy soft blue eye, And of very tenderness Almost to die! The whispering voice of Nightâ But cheerless things it says; The Moon's a silent loverâ Cold the Fountain's praise! Moon! Moon! shine not so brightlyâ Those beams are idly thrown To tell the poor forlorn one She is all alone! Moon! Moon! shine not so coldlyâ Thy kisses cold and wan Poorly supply the place of those For ever, ever gone! Oh shine no more, no more, Moon! Thy tender look but mocketh! Thy lightâit is not Love's lightâ Its brightness only shocketh!â Cease, FountÃ in, cease thy murmur! Thy sweet tender tone, Reminds her of another Sweeter than thine own! Last night thy waters murmured In the self-same tone; But then he listened with herâ And now she's all alone! Oh, rest thy weary bosom, Sweet, on the balustradeâ Cold as the heart is, that so late Its warm, warm pillow made! Thou wert a simple Flower, And he, the pilfering Bee Who stole thy love, the honeyâ Cruel, cruel he! Sorrow now must woo herâ Constant lover, he, All unlike her first love, Is not wont to flee. He's a jealous Lover; Miser of the heart, Grudging Joy his rival, Any, any part!â Prythee, weep, forlorn one! Tears will give thee easeâ Strangeâdark Grief should father Children bright as these!â Nay, do not, do not weep so! Lest it break thy heartâ Did'st not know that bright dreams Soonest, first depart? Did'st not know that Sorrow Comes when Joys are dearestâ To the most confiding Treachery is nearest?â She will ever weep soâ She will never smileâ Death will dry those meek eyes In a little while. I have seen a poor dove, With a broken wingâ Surely, surely thou art Such a maimÃ«d thing! I have seen a Rainbow, One half dissolved and goneâ More than half her bright soul With her love has flown! Die, then, die, forlorn one! Peace returneth neverâ In the cold grave, poor one, There is rest for ever! August, 1831. A SEA SIDE CALM. The morning air was pure and coolâ Asleep the silver bay; Each object on the shining sands, In shade reflected lay. The giant Cliffs in long array Were drawn up by the sea; Their heads thrown back with lofty pride In musing Majesty. The Sea methought did woo the Earth In low fond tones of loveâ The silent Sky hung stooping o'er, And listened from above! The herds of clouds were lying downâ The hunting Winds were gone; Their angry bark was heard no more, The weary chase was done. A calm, ambrosial consciousness Did Nature's bosom steepâ A stillness, not so stern as Death, And more profound than Sleep! 'Twas music mute, and voiceless speechâ A quiet, creeping, spellâ Reposeâwithout forgetfulness, And silence audible! September, 1831. THE CARD CASE'S PETITION. TO A LADY. May I come and attend on you, day after day, As you wing through your friends like a bee through the flowers?â Though the bee on his visits takes sweetness away, While you would bestow all the sweetness on ours? Oh can I expect you will deign to receive me, When so few and so poor must my services be?â For since every one loves you that knows you, believe me, There are none will deny themselves ever to thee! Oct. 1831. THE âLAND O' THE LEAL.â âThere's nae sorrow there, Jean, There's neither cauld nor care, Jean, In the Land o' the Leal!â Scotch Song. ??? ????, ?? ??????, ???? ????? ?? ??????????? ?? ??? ????? ??????? ?????, ?????????â??????? ????????????, ???? ?? ??. Plato: PhÅdon. Oh what a strange and a wonderous thing It will be when the Soul from its earth-home takes wing, And changes this narrow and darksome place For the limitless spread of Etherial Space! When it steals from its trammels of cumbersome clay And wakes in the subtle voidâfar, far, away, And marvels awe-struck what the hush of the scene, And the vast and mysterious loneliness mean! As the flame of the taper you thrust unaware In a chamber surcharged with inflammable air, Expands all at once to an atmosphere bright Of wide-spreading blaze, a volume of lightâ Will the spark of the Soul, half-stifled in clay, Thus dilate as it springs into measureless Day, And spread with the rush of a Banner unfurled, To the furthermost range of the spiritual world? Will it silently float on its wondering way, The strange and the secret by turns to survey? Or burst into Being of boundless expanse, And drink all the Universe in with a glance? âThen unembodied doth it trace By steps each planet's heavenly way, Or fill at once the realms of space, A thing of eyes that all survey?â Byron. Will it bid a farewell to the Sky and the Sun, And the Stars, that in glory and mystery runâ Like fire-flies glancing through cloud-woven bowers, Or golden hail driving in dazzling showersâ And the many-hued awning of Cloud spread on high, Which shuts o'er the globe, like the lid o'er its eye? And the dark-bright Earth with her dÅdal dress, And her changes on changes of loveliness? Will it nevermore list to the deep melody Which she hums as she flies, like a murmuring beeâ The music she whirls to, which ceaseth never, The chaunt of the wind and the chime of the river? Oh what will the Soul be where matter is noneâ The visible, audible, tangible goneâ Where Mind is the only Existence, and nought Is remaining but senseless and bodiless Thought? Will it be through Eternity radiantly shrined In a cloud of pure brightness undefined, Like the formless flood of silvery light Which hides the Sun's orb in winter white? Or revel in all that sweet Poesy breathes Of Elysiumâambrosiaâand amaranth wreathes? All that is joyous and all that is brightâ The sapphireâthe onyxâthe chrysolite? The emerald-green, resplendent bowersâ The crystal streamsâthe unfading flowersâ All refined from the grossness they wear below To a mellow, transparent, etherial glow! And the towers heaped up like the silvery piles Of sun-lit clouds when the summer smiles;â And the pearly domes, and the long colonnades, And the softer gleams of their gem-lit shades! And the diamond-roofs raining their blinding rays; And the fretwork alive with a rainbow blaze; And the tall aisles that shoot far far away, Built of radiance that moves with a flitting play; And the wide sea of Spirits that dazzle the sight, And their Crowns that quiver and flash with light, All violet-dark as the Sun's disk may be With the depth of their liquid brilliancy! âDark with excessive bright.ââParadise Lost. And the bright jasper-pavement ââthe bright Pavementâthat like a sea of jasper shone.â Paradise Lost. that mirror-like flings, From its surface the hues of the Seraphim's wings, Whose glossy and changing green, rich-blue and gold Would make all the plumage of Earth dim and cold! And the harmonies floating through all Time and Space, That in beauty breathe on though their birth none may trace; For Music once made shall exist evermore, Nor in Silence, its Death, fade away as before! And the ever-new songs of the Cherubim choirs; And the thrilling throb of their golden lyres; And the floating flush of the fragrant air, And the melodies ringing everywhere! We know notâwe guess notâhow these things may be; The rapture to feelâand the glory to see! We only conceive that Repose will be there, Unbroken by sorrowâuncankered by care! There the bud of our Reason shall perfectly blow, And reveal all we darklingly ponder belowâ All that we hear, and all that we see, In the light of a lovely consistency! And that mournful questioning Moving about in worlds not realized.âWordsworth. never again Shall ariseâwhich makes Admiration a Pain, From the mystery mantling the Death and the Birth Of everything beautiful here on Earth! There the bitter and sad shall for ever be gone, And the Pleasaunce of Sorrow be tasted alone; And Memory, Hope, and Possession unite In one deep gush of serene delight! Memoryâunpoisoned by sad regret; And Hope, by no doubts, no fears besetâ Possession enduring, and never to cloyâ Condensed to a crisis eternal of joy! There the Will and the Power together shall flow; Hand in hand with Fulfilment Desire shall go! Disappointment and Grief shall not enter there, And Pride and Ambition be banished elsewhere! Oh for a taste of that Calm of the breastâ That dreamy sleep of a brilliant Rest! For a moment of that world's moony bliss, To quiet the turmoil and fever of this! What is Death, what is Death, then, if he will explain All the doubts that so restlessly harass the brain? And where is the gloom of the terrorless Tomb, If its shadows the clouds of the Mind will illume?â Like the darkened approach to a grotto spar-bright, Is the dark path of Death to the regions of Light; And its palpable Night but the foil may be To the sparkles that gem Eternity! Then let Life fade away with its glimmering sheen, For the Night must rush down e'er the Stars can be seen, We shall leave only weariness, languor at best, And meet undisturbed, eternal Rest! Christmas, 1831. âGOOD-BYE!â Good-bye!âyes, good be with thee ever, Though fraught the words with ill to meâ Oh could my wishes guard thee, never Should evil trouble thee! Good-bye!âas much of good remain With thee, as will with me of sorrowâ Thy joy could not exceed the pain That will be mine to-morrow! And yet to one so good, believe Good wishes must superfluous beâ For who would harm, or wrong, or grieve A gentle thing like thee? Good-bye!âbut in that tender tone, Oh say not, love, `good-bye,' to meâ To wish me good when thou art gone, Is cruel mockery! Thou art my goodâand I shall find No good, no joy, when wanting thee, Except thine image in my mindâ And that shall never flee! But did you really wish my breast To feel the good you seem to pray, Oh you would grant your own requestâ And ever with me stay! Jauuary, 1832. TO IONE. Thy deeply-chiselled brows,âthy twilight eyes Upraised in gentle seriousness,âthy hair Whose long black weight makes more than marble fair The smooth brow and white bust whereon it lies,â Have given thy loveliness that tone we prize For its attractive aweâthat deep serene Solemnity of sweetness, which is seen In dark blue zenith depths of Alpine skies! The untamed Life of young pure Thought, in thee, So gently bold, so innocently free, Seems mellowed to a glowing still repose, A fervent calm its holiness bestows,â A look half rapture and half aweâmeek fire We know not most to love, to worship, or admire! January 31, 1832. TO AGNES. Thine azure eyes, floating in pensive light,â Thy raven hair,âthy features, soul-imprest, So tingeless and transparentâsimply drest In placid purityâserenely bright,â Would make me deem that thou hadst winged thy flight, A blessed Spirit, sped on love-behest, From some celestial Home of sainted Rest! But when thy dark-fringed eyelids, curved and white, In mournful meekness veil thine eyes' blue beaming, As sink a silver dove's wings o'er the dart,â I feel how sweetly human is thy heart, And long to reassure thy timid seeming, Protect thy gentle innocence, and press Thy breast to mine in ecstacy of tenderness! April 1, 1832. THE LONE STAR OF LOVE. âBut soft! what light through yonder window breaks!â Romeo and Juliet. I. Stilly as sinks on a Flower of June, The weight of dusk Eve or of sultry Noonâ Mutely and densely as fog-mists enthral The elegant Fabric on which they fallâ Thus mutely and deeply, with novelty laden Has the pall of Love mantled the beautiful Maiden! And the downcast light of the eye, half-hid By the heavily drooping, transparent lid;â And the long jetty lashes, imbedded that lie In the liquidly lustrous glow of the eye, As, when the Sun, with a mournful glare Is setting behind a wood all bare, The black naked branches by which he is crost In the indistinct brightness are almost lost;â Those glossy dark fringes that seem to seek To pillow themselves on the damask cheek, Whose delicate sheen with a warm-blush is burning, Like the Daisy away from you modestly turning;â And the rose-lips, down sinking in sweetest of sadness, Undimpled,âunwreathed by the smilings of gladness;â Nay, the head that is bowed, as the blue-bell may be, When it folds to its bosom the searching bee,â And the arm, that can scarcely its own weight sustain, But unweetingly losing its hold again Of the curtain it clung to, is ready to glide Slowly adown to her gentle sideâ The attitude was suggested by Mr. Newton's beautiful picture of the Dutch Girl. Sooth to say, her whole graceful but buoyantless frame, Unupheld and so languidâall tell us the same, The same soft tale of the o'ermastering weight Of her spirit's tyrannical tender freight!â II. Yes! Love doth deeply oppress herâI trow:â As noiselessly, softly as clouds of snow Do weigh down the boughs of a cedar-tree, Thus overladen with Love is she. Gently and tenderly every limb He hath brought into quiet subjection to himâ Smoothing them down with a softening touch, As ye smoothe a Dove's feathers when ruffled too muchâ And each feature is stamped with the impress intense Of his pervading influence. And as sunbeams, in which they transparently sleep, A Flower's rich-hued petals steep, Through and through them free-flowing, till the floweret seems To be made of the Light which on it streams; Thus are the gushes of subtle feeling To her Frame's and her Spirit's recesses stealing;â Her Soul, and the Frame where it meekly doth rest, Like a lovely bird in a lovely nest, Both with that Feeling so fully are fraught That she seems but the Essence of passionate Thought! And like as the Flower, its light-mingled hues Doth o'er the air it respires diffuse, So the Maid breathes an atmosphere, round and above, An atmosphere sated and teeming with Love! III. But is not Sadness in her air, And on her brow a tinge of Care? And feels she then that Weariness Which repose can make no less? Without fatigue, that Want of Rest, For aching heart, and weary breast? And does she prove that dear Distress, The workings of sweet bitternessâ The craveâthe voidâthe restlessness? The darling Woe which 'tis a pain To relinquish or retain? And does she fondly, sadly cherish Thoughts that drain Life's fountains dry, With obstinate love resolved to perish, Ere her heart's poor nestlings die? And does she nurse the Pelican-brood Of Wishes not to be withstood, Which, like that Desert-winger's young, Too often drain the dear life-blood That warms the breast from which they sprung?â Alas! that ever Pleasure paineth! That Woe so deep such Joy containeth! And well-a-day! that ever Gladness Should be but a phase of Sadness! IV. Have you seen when the Summer's day is done, And the Earth turns away from her lord, the Sun, Like a love-sated weary one, By his gifts and his kisses no more to be won? Though he had pranked her in glorious braverie, In cloud-robe of purple, far-flowing and free, And of crimson adornment, as rich as may be? All braided with water-gold, gorgeous to see, And jasper-streak, sheening bewitchingly?â His labour is thrown away, I guess, The Ladye-Earth turns from his rich caress, And himself and his favours capriciously spurning For a new Paramour is the faithless One burning! And lo! the sweet awe of the fading twilight, Prepareth the way for her new-love Night!â And then have you seen the first lone Star, Faint with its journeying from afarâ In the surfaceless Heaven's paly blue Still liquidly warm with a roseate hueâ Hanging with a motionless light, Innocently calm, and timidly bright? Belike, unperceived she hath stolen away, From the flashing halls where her Sisters play, In golden troops eternally dancing, Like glittering sun-sparks on wavelets glancing!â She hath come to the outskirts of Heaven awhile On some Meteor-Genie of Earth to smile, And throbbingly list to his harrowing tale, Of the woes and the dangers that did him assail While fettered he lay on the dismal swamp, Chained to the marish-floor, cold and dampâ Like a purple-winged Peri when doomed by the rage Of the Demons of Evil to pine in a cageâ And how he escaped with such danger and pain, And is come to his Angel, his fair One again! But alas for the ear that will list to his tale, And alas for the cheek that will turn so pale, And the innocent heart that will meekly believe And fondly confide in the words that deceive! For soon she will see him glide down the steep sky, Nor care though he leave her to mourn till she die, Or to wander heart-broken, disconsolate, pining, Through the airy-built halls where her sisters are shining! V. And a Star seems the Maiden all brightly to be, In the light of her Angel purity! A young, fair Star, such an one as is given, To make of this dull Earth a radiant Heaven! And she resteth now, star-like and still, Expectant on the window-sill; And watcheth, like that horizon-gem, The sweetest in Night's diadem! So be the light, her heart alluring, Than that Meteor more enduring! So may her Love-mate be truer Than that meek Star's Meteor-wooer! Feb. 1832. LOVE AND CIRCUMSTANCE. âCircumstance, that unspiritual God And miscreatorââ Childe Harold. I. Alas! that most our wishes swell For what is least attainable! That what we can and what we should Is so removed from what we would The author has unconciously adopted these lines from Cowperâwho has, âBut what we would-so weak is manâ Lies oft remote from what we can.â Sheridan says of plagiarisms, âFaded ideas float in the fancy like half-forgotten dreams; and the imagination in its fullest enjoyments becomes suspicious of its offspring, and doubts whether it has created or adopted.â May we not affirm the same in the less lofty case of phrases and turns of expression floating in the memory?! Alas! need is we pare and press The mind to meet its earthly dress, And mould it to a statue which May suit its narrow worldly niche! For Circumstance is a cruel thing, Remorseless all, and uncomplyingâ And aye bemocketh tears and sighing;â And Fancy's is too wild a wing,â And what to sanguine Youth appears The bud of Smiles, may bloom in Tears! II. And when some sunny Isle of Bliss Along the sea of Life is spiedâ And straight our bark puts off for this, And Hope her sails unfurleth wideâ And nearer still, and still more near That bright Isle woos our mad careerâ Then woe for what full soon is seen! A thousand breakers rise between, And with long-rolling burst defend, The pleasant Isle to which we tend! They boil and hiss, and raise on high Their surf-white heads complainingly, And press around, with plaintive cry, And like a wild bird's famished brood Importunate for wanted food! III. And are not these breakers the passionate pangs Which clutch the torn heart with their desperate fangs, When the Tide of fierce wishes which hurry the Soul Heedlessly on its dazzling goal, Breaks o'er the sharp rocksâdiscovered too late, Which the Demon of Circumstance, Fiends of Fate, For the poor Heart's shipwreck miscreate? IV. And many the Isles that gem that sea, And varied in form as the wishes may be! Ambition is there with its mountains high, And its pinnacles piercing the depths of the sky;â And the gentle slopes and the still dells of Ease, With their murmuring streams, and their slumbery trees;â And the low coast of Wealth, dull and dark to the show, But teeming with mines richly laden below;â And looming in Majesty, shrouded in mist, That strange Isleâwhose music clay souls never histâ To whose heart-thrilling echoes âclear spirits,â must listâ What is it but Fame? though it be not avowed If a real isle it be, or only a cloud? Like renowned Atalanta, much-babbled of old, Which all might approach though but few could behold, Or Mona mist-hid from the hardy sea-rover By a mermaid to punish her cold-hearted lover! V. But Love is the foremost and crowning Isle Of all that in Life's Archipelago smile! And what if Love be, though so fancy-bright, An all unattainable Home of Delight? One of those rich Resting-places of Bliss, Too sweet to be gained in a world like this! As bright as a Star or Rainbow to viewâ But like Rainbow or Star, unapproachable too! And what if its Sorrow-girt Pleasaunce appears, Like the delicate Foxglove, which gracefully rears Its stem hung with pink-bells, so meekly forlorn, Through briars all tangled and bristling with thorn! While Fancy alone is the Bee that has power To fly past them allâand to sip of the flower! January, 1832. ADRIAN'S DYING ADDRESS TO HIS SOUL. [Animulaâvagulaâblandula! Hospes, comesque corporis! QuÃ¦ nunc abibis in loca? Pallidula, rigida, nudulaâ Nec, ut soles, dabis jocos!] Tremulous, fluttering, Spirit!â Guest and companion whose presence Did enliven the Body, and cheer itâ Whither, Oh whither art flying?â Mournfulâand shrinkingâand sighingâ Where be thy jokes and thy pleasaunce? April 7, 1832. WELLINGTON. (ON A PICTURE BY SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE.) I. The dense smoke's volumes, rolling pitchy gloom Across the darkened skyâthe vivid play Of levelled flashes, glancing bright dismayâ The winged Artillery's loud exulting boom, With fierce joy bellowing forth a nation's doomâ These, and the bounding thrill, the rapture-rife Intense intoxication of the strife, The deadly revelry making Earth a Tombâ Declare the War-delirium at its height!â Meanwhile, in all the uproar of the scene, Curbing his pawing steedâunmovedâsereneâ Sits Wellington! but not the stern delight That fires the common warrior, can excite His features' hardy calmâwherein exprest Most visibly, looks forth the Mind, at Rest In riotous Amazeâin wild Affright Composedâwhose home is on the Battle-fieldâ The Petrel of the War-stormâin repose Where grappling in the death-gripe thousands close! In calmest consciousness of Strength, self-steeled, Behold in him the Master-mind revealed! The cloudless browâthe clear well-opened eyeâ The half-smile on the lipsâall foes defyâ His very Quiet is a People's shield! So, proudly rising in the hushed profound Of vacant purple, soars some Alpine Peak, Smiling in sunny calmâwhile, surging round Its base, wide foaming Mist-waves boil and break! II. The mildness of his mien might seem to mock The Hosts together flung with Earthquake shock! The cheerful ease of his confiding air, But ill betrays his all-Importance there! For through those lips what few short words transpire, Are Giants to upheave an Army's ire! That calm glance shoots the lightning of its ken O'er many a sulphur-clouded mass of men! The reins of Rage are guided by his hands, He wields the wrath of myriad warrior-bands! Proud-seated Cities bow before his breathâ He waves Destructionânods Despair and Death! Leagued Nations nerve him, in the awful hour Of red Revenge, with strength condensed, to smite; The gathered energies of Empires glow In himâthe Vehicle of all their Power, The Focus of their concentrated Might, Flashing its death-glare on the dazzled Foe! By Genius throned, on Self-Possession's height, Unmoved he scans the Chaos spread belowâ A still Moon shining through the Combat's night Of the thick and sulphurous fight.âByron's French Ode. Bidding its Tides of Fury ebb and flowâ A Sun, whose high behests serenely guide The fierce Monsoons of Battle to and fro; After whose path of calm commanding Pride Etesian war-winds wildly hurrying goâ A Battle-Pharos, beaming steady light Far o'er the raging Sea of fluctuating Fight! The peculiar calmness, amounting almost to dejection, which was the predominating expression of Napoleon's features during the battle of Austerlitz, is recorded by Savary, and strikingly preserved in the celebrated picture by Gerard. March 12, 1832. ADRIAN'S ADDRESS TO HIS SOUL WHEN DYING. PARAPHRASED. Spirit! gentleâkindly! Fluttering, wandering Thing! Long the Body's tenantâ Its companion dearâ Whither would'st thou blindly? Why art on the wing?â Silently awe-strickenâ All aghast with fear; Strangely grave and mournful, Wrapt in settled gloomâ Shrinking from the shadows, Of thy coming doom! No quips, no jests has thouâ No mirthful fancies now! 1832. SISERA. âThen sang Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoamââ Judges. Wake! son of Abinoam!âDeborah, wake! Uprise, and your timbrels of victory take! For the Conqueror's conqueredâthe Tyrant is slain And Israel exults in her freedom again! With the rumbling of thunderclouds heard from afar, Rolled Sisera's chariots on to the war! As the hot Simoom blasts with its withering breath Proud Sisera scattered Destruction and Death!â He is deadâhe is gone! with his horsemen of mightâ A terror at morningâa byword at night! They are stirless as clods on the plains where they strode, And in silence they rot where they recklessly rode! The Stars fought against themâthe Rivers aroseâ Old Kishon was first with the tyrants to close! The dark Heaven scowled on their desperate pathâ They witheredâthey shrunk from the blaze of its wrath! Wake! Deborah, wake! Sleep'st thou, Barak?âOh wake! Let your timbrels of triumph glad melody make! For the Earth and the Skies did the work of the sword, And dashed into nothing the foes of the Lord! 1827 and 1832. THE VOICE OF THE PESTILENCE. BY A YOUNG FRIEND OF THE AUTHOR. ???????, ??????? ????? ?? ???? ??????? Ãsch. Agam. I. Breathless the course of the pale white horse, Bearing the ghastly Formâ Rapid and dark the spectre bark When it sweeps before the storm! Balefully bright, through the torrid night Ensanguined meteors glareâ Fiercely the spires of volcanic fires Stream on the sulphurous air! Shades of the slain through the Murderer's brain Flit terrible and drearâ Shadowy and swift the black storm-drift Doth trample the atmosphere! But swifter than all, with a darker pall Of Terror around my path, I have arisen from my lampless prisonâ Slave of the high God's wrath! II. A deep Voice went from the Firmament And it pierced the caves of Earthâ Therefore I came on my wings of flame From the dark place of my birth! And it said: âGo forth from the South to the North Over yon wandering ballâ Sin is the King of that doomÃ«d Thing, And the sin-beguiled must fall!â III. Forth from the Gate of the Uncreate, From the portals of the Abyssâ From the caverns dim where vague Forms swim, And shapeless Chaos is! From Hades' wombâfrom the joyless Tomb Of Erebus and Old Nightâ From the unseen deep where Death and Sleep Brood in their mystic mightâ I comeâI come !âbefore me are dumb The nations, aghast for dreadâ Lo! I have past, as the desert-blastâ And the millions of Earth lie dead! IV. A voice of fear from the Hemisphere Tracketh me where I flyâ Earth weeping aloud for her widowhoodâ A wild and desolate cry! Thrones and Dominions, beneath my pinions Cower like meanest Thingsâ Melt from my presence, the pride and the pleasaunce Of pallor-stricken Kings! Sorrow and mourning supremely scorning, My throne is the boundless Airâ My chosen shroud is the dark-plumed cloud Which the whirling breezes bear! V. Was I not borne on the wings of the Morn From the jungles of Jessore, Over the plain of the purple main To the far Mauritian shore? To the isles which sleep on the sunbright deep Of a coral-pavÃ«d sea, Where the blue waves welter beneath the shelter Of Heaven's serenity? From the womb of the waters, athirst for slaughters I rose that thirst to sateâ Those green isles are graves in the waste of the waves, Their beauty is desolate! From the wide Erythrean the noise of my PÅan Rolled on the Southern blastâ Eternal Taurus made answering chorus, From his glaciers lone and vast! Did I not pass his granite mass, And the ridged Caucasian hillâ Over burning sandsâover frost-chained lands, Borne at my own wild will? VI. Then hark to the beat of my hastening feet, Thou shrinÃ«d in the Seaâ Where are thy dreams that the Ocean-streams Would be safety unto thee? Awaken! awaken! my wings are shaken Athwart the troubled skyâ Streams the red glance of my meteor lance, And the glare of mine eager eye! Hearken, oh hearken! my coming shall darken The light of thy festal cheerâ In thy storm-rocked home, on the Northern foamâ Nursling of Oceanâhear! 1831. NIGHT. A FRAGMENT. (BY THE SAME.) ââ'tis not merely The human being's pride, that peoples Space With Life, and mystical Predominance.â Coleridge's Wallenstein. The wings of the Night-wind brood Over the deep Tyrrhene; The buoyant plains are strewed With star-beams from between Yon filmy-pacÃ«d Clouds that travel the serene! Forth from their dewy prison, The subtle Mists arisen Wind o'er the heaving waste of sable waves; And upon Spirit-wings Sepulchral whisperings Float upward from the dark of the untrodden caves. Formless and undefined, Move on the silent Mind, Presences from a world invisibleâ As upon wood and meadow, White clouds drop quick shadow When scattered over heaven at the West wind's will. Within her own deep cells, The Human Spirit dwells, List'ning the weird thoughts that she cannot shunâ Thoughts of Birth and Being And Deathâthat mock th' unseeing And sense-bedimmÃ«d eyes of mortal vision! Beings of other mould With her still converse hold, Filling dew-like the Void etherialâ Converse rarely heard By the passion-stirred Soul that enchainÃ«d is, in this material Thrall. Musicâgentle and rareâ Glides on the throbbing air, As over cloudless Skies the grey moonshineâ Softer than radiant Dreamsâ Brighter than fitful gleams Of transitory joys on hearts that inly pine. Denizens of FaÃ«ry, Vague and visionaryâ Children o' th' bright Dreams of the impassioned Eld, Genii and Gnomes That people the far Domes Of star-ensphering Heavenâdeep in the Unbeheldâ Beautiful Shapes and dim,â The vacant air do swim, Thronging the Chambers of the wan Midnight,â Tissue of waving cloud Mantles the bodiless crowd; The charmÃ«d Soul o'erflows with tremulous Delight. She wakes from the grave of Sense Where she hath buried been, Fraught with Intelligence, Ardent and pure and keenâ Hearing the erst Unheardâand gazing on th' Unseen! 1832. HORACE TO LAMIAS. BOOK I. ODE. âMusis amicusâtristitiam et metus, &amp;c.â (ALCAICS.)

ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF FRISK. âOur good old friend is goneâgone to his rest.â Cowper. âErgo Quinctilium perpetuus sopor Urguet?âcui Pudor, et JustitiÃ¦ Soror Incorrupta Fidesânudaque Veritas Quando ullum inveniet parem?â Horace. âDead! Dead! Dead!âOh, oh, oh!â Othello. âDead? no, sure! what old Thomas Day!â Glee. âI'm sorryâbut we all must die. âHis time was comeâhe ran his race, We hope he's in a better place.â Swift. âStretched in the streetâand able scarce to pantâ âPoor fellow!âfor some reason, surely bad, They had slain him with five slugs.â Don Juan, Canto v. âFallenâfallenâfallenâfallenâ And weltering in his bloodâ On the bare earth exposed he lies And not a friend to close his eyes.â Dryden. âBut Tom is deadâand so no more of Tom.â Don Juan. Come, every Muse of saddest vein, From her who prompted David's strain, When âBrother Jonathanâ was slain, To her, whose sob Wrung speeches from the Corporal's brain O'er Master Bob! See Corporal Trim's eloquence on the death of Master Bobby, in Tristram Shandy. Come thou who came at Milton's wish, When Lycidas was food for fish; Who wept o'er Keats with Percy Byssheâ Inspired Marc Antony When Brutus âcarved the Gods a dishâ They scarce could want on high! Brutus says of Julius CÃ¦sarâ âLet's carve him as a dish fit for the Gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds!â Jul. CÃ¦s. Come every Muse who mournfully Doth Harp or Hurdigurdy ply; Who stirred up Byron's burning sigh When Thyrza fell, Or bade Ben Battle âpipe his eyeâ For faithless Nell! See the dolorous Ballad of the Love and Death of bold Ben Battle for Nelly Gray, in Hood's Whims and Oddities. Come all who turn, nor turn in vain That cistern's cock, in which the rain Of human tears is gatheredâdeign Your aid to apply! Grief is the cock through which you drain The salt floods dry! Bring every cry that Sorrow knows From Greek â??? ???âs, â?? ?âs, â??âs, The Greek Tragedians give us line after line of â????????????âs, â??? ??? ??? ??âs, â???????. ???????âs, &amp;c.âby way of moving our pityâproving thereby the truth of Byron's assertion, that âTruth denie all Eloquence to woe.â To our âAlack's,â âAlas's!â âOh's!ââ Bring groans and sighs, And handkerchiefs to blow the nose, And wipe the eyes. Come all and mourn with saddest mind The goodâthe gentle, and the kindâ The friend sincereâthe guest refinedâ The foe to none;â The Star of Dogs has sure declinedâ For Frisk is gone! As Homer in immortal lay, Makes wise Ulysses fiercely say, 'Twas to the suitors (by the way A currish crew!) âDogs,â says he, âyou have had your day!â We say so too! See Pope's (Homer's) Odyssey.â âDogsâye have had your day!âye feared no more Ulysses vengeful from the Trojan shore!â &amp;c. The last of all theâPoodles! Brutus (is it not?) mourning over the corpse of Cassius, calls him the Last of all the Romans. we Must bid a sad farewell to thee! It will be long before we see Thy like againâ A coat and character so free From spot or stain! Thy merits, Frisk, as I opine, Deserve an abler pen than mineâ But yet thy ghost (if ghost be thine) Need not be fretted, Nor by the Styx despairing whine,â 'Twas so regretted! Aye! though no tomb thy bones encrust, Nor (dog-faced) âanimated bustâ Nor âstoried urnâ adorn thy dustâ The feeling heart Thy death will mournâit may and mustâ Dog as thou wert! What, though there was no sable showâ No plumesâno pallâno outside woeâ Nor all that retinue so slow Of saddest stuffâ As death were not itself a foe Quite sad enoughâ Yet tears as true o'er thee descend, As o'er the many Great, whose friend Not sad enough himself to attend The funeral courses, Wouldâwhat will weep as truly, sendâ His coach and horses. And who with cold contemptuous sneer, Will scorn the undesigning tear That falls o'er thyâwe can't say, bier, Because thou'dst noneâ But that which falls, (we hope so) here O'er friendship gone. Oh, is there so much love to spare In this cold world of selfish care, That even the sternest heart could bear To spurnâreproveâ Or slight the meanest things there are, Who offered love? The tears of Heaven's affection streak The dappled daisy's modest cheek, So purely brightâso simply meek, As fondly quite As when the Oak's proud crest they seekâ A glorious sight! The Heavens look down with equal love Upon the sparrow of the grove, And on the King-Bird, far above, When charging on, He rides full-tilt, in fight to prove The astonished Sun! Then why regard with scorn or mirth, The creatures of fraternal birth, The children of one MotherâEarthâ Whose each degree Can feel and fill Affection's dearth As well as we? Oh, if a very worm relied On my protectionâwould confide In me, and love none else besideâ Could I reject it? No! I would cherish it with pride, And ne'er neglect it! The dogâunlike the human raceâ Loves on, through Pride and through Disgrace; Unaltered fondness in his face His tail he wags, And owns the friend he knew in lace, A friend in rags. His Master's side he never fled, Though black with crime by Passion bredâ Man coldly shrugs, and shakes his head, With seeming sigh, And talks of âFriendship forfeited,â And âruin nighâ!â But I, methinks, have wandered long, From him, the subject of my songâ And sooth it were a grievous wrong To leave untold What virtues in his breast did throng, Who's stiff and cold. His feats were not like theirs who brave Deep Alpine snows, and travellers save Who lose their way to find their graveâ Nor pulled he ever A Roland GrÃ¦me from out the wave, With bold endeavour. He rivalled not the Bow-street ârout ââthe race Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard,â &amp;c. Par. Lost.,â In snuffing secret murder out; Nor equalled him whose fame for snout So wide and large isâ The dog there's so much talk about, Of old Montargis. He could not boast the murderous power Of Billy, who, of dogs the flower, Killed rats by thousands in the hourâ To save digressionâ The best of valour was his dowerâ And that's Discretion! Yet though no rat of life he rid, who Left four-legged orphans, long-tailed widow, As Billy, cruel monster, did doâ Though travellers none for His succour, back to Being slid, who Had else been done for;â Though we may say, and without slander, He was no canine Alexanderâ Nor did, a Howard on four feet, wander Philanthropizingâ You'll find his virtues, if you ponder, Were worth the prizing. Each kind domestic quality, And all accomplishments that be Denied to dogs of low degree, In him were foundâ The Chesterfield of Dogs was he, With heart more sound! And though there are who do aver At call to arms he would demur, And âfortiter in reâ to cur But seldom showed,âOh 'Twas but excess of âsuaviterâ (Poor Dog!) âin modoâ! Chesterfield recommends the âsuaviter in modo, et fortiter in re,ââ the union of suavity of manner with firmness of action. A Canine Lake-School would have crowned Poor Frisk their kingâin him was found No love âof war or battle's soundââ The milk so mild Of quadrupedal kindness drowned Such wishes wild! His ever-peaceful conduct shows, The Christian creed of love to foes (Which we profess in midst of blows) He followed better, Than many a two-legged Christian doesâ Christian by letter! The Politics of Frisk, I ween, Were moderate as e'er were seenâ He thought not Anarchy must mean A Liberal's gloryâ And difference found (perhaps) between Tyrant and Tory. While fierce discussion o'er him flew, He gnawed his bone, nor thought it true If you allowed Corruptionâyou Would leave him none, Nor that Reform would give him two Instead of one! He classed the âright divineâ of kings, Like far-famed Niger's mouth and springs, With nature's secret, hidden thingsâ The time, the way, Or who the right from Heaven brings He could not say. Perhaps it comes down in a sheet, And sanctions them to âslay and eatâ Just whom they pleaseâa glorious treat Should make us vain! Promoted into Monarchs' meatâ We can't complain! True, Jove a log from Heaven sent, When on a King the frogs were bentâ And surely, there's safe precedent Why logs should be Received as kings by heaven lent, By you and me. But Frisk of this was never told So saw in Kings (profanely bold He must have been) no better mould Than flesh and blood, Which Nations vest with power, to hold For public good! Yet joined he not with those who thought That all to be made equal oughtâ Like him, who all his captives brought, Both great and small ones, To fit one bed, by stretching short, And lopping tall ones Procrustes (I think) was the famous robber who subjected his captives to this equalising ordealâabout as judicious a way of enforcing the physical âRights of Man,â as the other would be of adjusting their moral and political ones.. Again he held, his whims among, That Nature meant each body (strong Or weak) should to that Soul belong To which she tacked itâ But wiser men prove Nature wrong If thus she acted. Strange waste of Soul, that thing divine! It would have been in her to assign A separate one to eachâin fine 'Tis right black bodies Should serve our souls, and I opine So meant the Goddess! In giving them their skins of black, She clapt a livery on their back, And stamped them slaves, to toil and hack For souls in white caseâ How could our Dog rejectâalack!â This plain and bright case! Yet had his choice been (not to spin a Long yarn) 'twixt Slavery with a dinner, And Liberty withoutâthe sinner! The fault I fear Had not been his, if he'd got thinner So nigh good cheer. For Faith, he had a âword in seasonââ âYou neither made your Will nor Reason, Nor ever put yourself your knees on; 'Twas all inheritedâ So talk the matter how you please, onâ You've nothing merited.â To Sceptics vain, he said, (or might,) âUnless you doubt your doubtâand quite Mistrust your power of doubting rightâ Where is your claim To Reason's free, unclouded lightâ 'Tis all a name!â That nothing we for certain knowâ That nought's incredible below, And nought indubitableâso Our dog believedâ He thought not that it must be, though, As he conceived Lucky reservation !âelse doubtless had his canine conclusions and antiquated dogmatisms provoked felicitous applieation of Sidrophel's satire on âThose Athenian sceptic owls That will not credit their own soulsâ But measuring all things by their own Knowledge, hold nothing's to be known,â &amp;c. or, more effectively, of the gentleness and insinuating persuasiveness of the glorious Socrates, reasoning against those who conclude by supposing themselves ????????? ????????? ??? ?????????????? ????? ??? ???? ??? ????????? ??????? ????? ????? ???? ??????? ???? ??? ?????? of the mild and melancholy-tinged appeal: ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ?? ?????, ?? . . . ?? ?????? ??? ??????? ???? ??? ?????? ???????? ???? . . . ??? ?????? ???? ????? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ??????, ????????, ??? ?? ????? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ????????? ?????????. Plat. PhÃ¦d. 89, 90.. His âcry âFair Liberty was all his cry,ââSwift.,â or bark, was moderation; The golden mean of legislation, 'Twixt total change and conservation; And though ye die for 't, Freedom for every sect and nationâ (No doubt he 'll fry for't!) But let us leave his politics And call to mind his gambols, tricks, And all that did our Friendship fixâ For nought remains But Memoryâsince the gloomy Styx All else retains. How would he dance with lively bound And twirl on two legs round and roundâ Then, graceful sink upon the groundâ And take the bread So gently, which his labours crownedâ And nowâhe's dead! A pebble at your feet he'd layâ Retreat a step or twoâand pray With wistful whine, that seemed to say, âDo come and throw it!ââ His eyes the same request displayâ His tail would show it! And then his whine more earnest grew, The stone was nearer pushedâhe threw A glance at it, and then at youâ His tail too, said With more impatient wag âNow do!ââ But oh!âhe's dead! Those eyes, whose language did surpass The eye-talk of love-smitten lass, Or ev'n of Sterne's dejected ass, Are past awayâ âDog's flesh as well as man's is grassââ Death makes it hay! Those eyesâas eloquent as brightâ The feet that told each want arightâ The exulting bark, to show delight, The whine, to prayâ The Rhetoric of that tail so whiteâ Where, where are they? Of Time we are the fools, the sportâ And all complain our Life is short; Take fifty years from thisâto nought, Complaining Man, The Dog's âsojourn on Earthâ is brought, To scarce a span! Frisk died not in his bed or cotâ Nor died he in his shoesâhis lot Was not to fall by hangman's knotâ Yet tried was he, Convicted ofâold age, and shotâ His crimeâto be!â It was the ancient Scythians who Their aged men and women slewâ We know not if Frisk's slayers too Ere they could sate 'em, Followed the precedent quite through Andâboiled and ate him Herodotus says the MassagetÃ¦ put to death, boiled and ate those whose age and infirmities made them encumbrances.âIt was certainly a strange way of âliving again in one's posterityââthese savages must have been the original âliving gravesâ to which Byron compares the dungeons of Chillon. Each man was the burial-place of all his ancestryâa walking charnel-houseâson after son widening the great self-sarcophagus, like the concentric rings made by throwing a stone into a pondâone within another, like the cases of a mummy, or the tubes of a sliding telescopeâ the last always embracing all that preceded him. A resurrectionist (or Burkite, for in this case the two would be identical) would not only have rifled the whole family vault at once, but have carried off the vault itself. It was the oak, not springing from, but re-inclosed in, the acorn. Vanity, in such circumstances, must have been a virtue, for in worshipping one's self, one would have been âhonouring father and mother;â self-know-ledge would have been synonymous with length of descent, for in knowing one's-self, one would have known a far-ascending ancestryâin examining his own breast a man would have examined his pedigree. How truly might the young have declared that âthe ills of Eld their earlier years alloyed,ââhow literally may the old be said to have merged again into âsecond childhoodâmere oblivion!ââThe men of such an age, whether or not they âjudicious drank,â certainly âgreatly daring dinedâ âfor at a meal they devoured all their forefathers. What were the suppers of the Roman Emperors or Cleopatra to this?âwe can only hope they âinwardly digestedâ them. He fellâno fears his fame belied, He perished with becoming pride; Like Duke d'Enghien or Ney, he died With tearless eye; O'er which no bandage mean was tiedâ So heroes die! An edifying end we may Affirm he made; he âpast away With Christian fortitudeâ as say The tombstones ever,â Though benefit of Clergy they Allowed him never. O'er him they held no âcrowner's questââ No âuseless coffin shrined his breastâ But âlike aâPoodle taking restâ Just so he layâ âNo useless coffin enshrined his breastâ Not in sheet nor in shroud we wound him, But he lay like a Warrior taking his rest With his martial cloak around him!â Wolfe.âDeath of Sir J. Moork. No want of shroud or tomb distrest His sleeping clay. Then farewell Frisk! thour't kennelled now Safe in that bourne from which nor thou Nor any dogs return, but know Delight unceasingâ No whineâno snarl will there avow Dislike to teasing. But hadst thou thy desertsâthe might Of Genius should thy form unite With that ideal Menagerie bright, That Phantom throng Of creatures living in the light Of deathless song! There chirps Catullus' sparrow yet With Lesbia's tears no longer wet;â There Pope's and Byron's dogs forget Their earthly cares;â There Mailie frisksâpoor Burns's petâ With Cowper's hares; There Gray's and Johnson's cats are foundâ Catullus complains that Lesbia's eyes were red with weeping for the loss of her sparrowâPope and Byron have immortalised their Dogsâ Burns writes an Elegy on the death of Mailie, the Author's pet lambâGray a poem on the death of a favourite catâSterne has given everlasting existence to a starling and a jackass or twoâBoswell records Johnson's fondness for his cat âold HodgeââFrederic the Great was so grieved at the loss of one of his dogs, that nothing but his nose could compel him to suffer the removal of its carcass from his room. Walter Scott's Maida, and many other animalsâpets of the Immortals, will occur to the mind of the reader.â A history of them all would form a pleasant Biographical Dictionaryâan interesting intellectual Zoological Garden. And with like fame should'st thou be crowned And long as Earth spins round and round With merry whisk, Full many admiring tongues should sound The praise of Frisk! D.&amp;.âThe Will. His wealth perhaps, on hobbies gone, Very probablyâseeing that hobby-horses are winged Pegasuses, (or Pegasi) for flying away with cash and kicking down money. They are terribly hardmouthed. He died like Billy Pitt, with noneâ Canningâat Guildhallâwroteâ âHe lived without ostentation and he died poor.â Byronâin Don Juanâwroteâ âPitt as a high-souled Minister of State, is Renowned for ruining his country gratis!â Perhaps a kind good-natured crone (Which first we'd best state) Poor Frisk had no will of his own, And died intestate. Perhaps, being fond of notoriety His wealth endowed âsome good society,â Of pleasure having had satiety, While drawing breathâ Enabled thus to look with quiet eye On coming death: He left it, p'rhaps for Bible mission Are we to look for a specimen of the benefits to be derived from such appropriation of his property, to that strange combination of saints and savages, of swarthy chiefs and pale-faced missionariesâof barbarism and methodismâlicentiousness and cantâOtaheite?, To teach âwild salvagesâ contritionâ Perhaps to foster erudition And useful knowledge, In scholarship or exhibition For dogs at college. Perhaps in purpose philanthropic To spread from pole to either tropicâ Perhaps to benefit poor Chlopicki's gallant Polesâ For even dogs on such a topic Would show they'd souls If so, it would be more than their brother Englishmen did; they showed neither souls nor bowelsâat least of compassionâupon the occasion; however, ânil desperandum.â âFor Freedom's battle once begun, Requeathed by bleeding sire to son, Though baffled oft is ever won!â. His friendship, constant, warm, and weeded From selfish motives, much was needed; But Fashion's slaves to most succeededâ Though, Heaven under, If any love so well as he didâ 'Twill be a wonder. His toleranceâthe Church had it, (Dissenters scarcely got a bit;) [There seems an ambiguity about this sentence. It is not sufficiently clear whether his âtoleranceâ is said to have been allotted to âthe Church,â from their actual possession, or from their want of itâwhether it is withheld from the Dissenters, because they already had so much that more would have been superfluous, or still have so little that none could ever have been imparted. In each point, as the Dog would most likely have done, we must withhold our judgment, or put the most charitable construction on the tÃ¨xt.] He left to Barristers dog-wit; To Parliament, For duellists who seldom hit, His valour went. To Merchants how could he deny His honour delicate and high, And boundless generosity.â He made his power Of picking clean, and lapping dry, The Lawyer's dower. Could he to Editors of News His trick of twirling round refuse? His candour, freedom from abuse And gentleness, Who would like party speakers useâ Who waste it less? His self-mistrust, assumption small, And modesty he left to all; No single person would he call Heir to his charity; He knew, wherever it might fall, 'Twould be a rarity. HORACE TO HIS PAGE. ODE.

Because not of this noisy worldâbut silent and divine. Wordsworth. I. The sleep of sun-beguiled Earth is o'erâ The pearly lids of Day have drawn their screen Of golden lashes from her lustrous eyes, And theyâalbeit she shadows them in dark, As one about to gaze upon a sight Of most intolerable brilliancyâ Exult in interchange of glances glad, With all the orbs of Argus-visioned Heaven! On Day's blank skyey page Magician Night Has traced the figures of his glittering lore, The gorgeous symbols of his unknown tongueâ The eloquence of a language mysticalâ The soul-exciting secrets of a science Written in tomes which are the Universe, Lettered in Stars, worded in burning Worlds, And syllabled in Systems radiance-wrought! II. Oh then my Spirit, wake! wake thou, my soul! Shake off the shackles of terrestrial commerce, And with the ardour of etherial temper Make strong thy pinions to uphold thy flight Arduous, through endless multitudes of worlds, Of moving worldsâunutterable crowds And families of glory! On the Night, The black outstretched immense of Darkness, launch Thy loving ken enrapturedâonward soar! Through the starred Infinite wend thy wondering way Unweariedâthrough the labyrinthine maze Of golden marvels windâand find no rest, No pause, no change, no little space unfilled, No respite from the infinite display Of infinite might, where the bewildered soul And Admiration overborne and spent And dazed Delight may breathe a moment free! III. The glancing myriads riseâabove, around, Beforeâstill, still upon the encumbered sight They throng, they grow; on every side in swarms Increasing, as by mirrors multiplied Innumerable! lo, how the glittering shoals Floating in quick succession through the blue Vacuity, glide by the trancÃ«d gaze, Serenely swift, as sweep shores, fields, and trees, And grazing cattle past a flying bark! And mark! extant from out the studded Depths, Of those which nearer strew our airy path Each as it rapidly approaches seems A sparkâa starâa luminous orbâa globe Immense, upon its separate aim intent, And walking lone in silent confidence Its settled wayâponderous, dilating sphere, Hanging in solitude!âthen shrinking fast, From globe to luminous orbâto starâto spark, Again it twinkles in the gemmed expanse, And in the brilliant masses merging, flies! IV. How overpowering now the sense profound Of shorelessâwavelessâstill Immensity! Where now are Earth and Timeâand their vain doings, And where is Oldâand Newâand Pastâand Presentâ The Empiresâand the Kingdomsâand the Glory? Oh where is History with her restless years, Power and Might with all their fluctuations? The high Adventurings of old Renownâ The glorious visions of the indistinct Eldâ The illustrious things of dark Antiquityâ The ebb and flow of the great Tides of Time? Where is the noiseâthe bustleâand the tumultâ The ceaseless clashing of continual Warsâ The exalted bass which follows murmuringly The ever-rolling billows of Mankind? The shaking thunders of the big World's march, And the vast echoes of a thousand ages?â Unheardâunknownâunseenâforgottenâlostâ Gathered, condensed, and dwindled to a sparkâ All their high soundings sunk within the Deep Of the unbounded Silence. The mute Sky Through its far-rounding, solemn, clear, concave, Loaded with stars, tells not of suchâthe void Speaks not of themâthe shadowy Inane Knows not the fame thereof.âThey are absorbed, Lost in the hushed immense of hollow beingâ Whisper-like melting from the mute Abyss, As melts the hiss of feverish excitation From off the surface of subsiding waters. V. But look again across the spangled steep And tell us where the Earth thou callest thine?â Left far behind and lost in crowded spaceâ Invisible!âBut take yon little speckâ Hardly discerned amid the myriad lights Profuse along the Heavens; what must be The mites that crawl upon its surface when Itself is but a point?âOh is there found Among them Pride, and big undoubting sense Of Dignity, and Confidence disturbed By no misgiving? Strive they to be known? Oh toil its habitants to gain respect And adoration on that little mote? Do they with impotent endeavour strain To force their fame throughout that tiny speck, That single grain of sand upon a shore Boundless far more than Ocean'sâall composed Of atoms each as worthy as itself?â VI. Ambition! look you here! That atomy of light, minutest, faintestâ And by keen gaze alone discernible Amid innumerable such, contains A wider space than is bestowed on you To scheme and fret in!âKings and Lords of Earth, Whose sceptered sway extends o'er regions wide, And far-spread masses of mankind, and strength Of cities vastâbehold! a wider realm Than you can boast, Kingdoms and nations more Than worship you, are dwindled to that speck! There stoop ye to your stateâgrope for your greatnessâ There prick ye for your provinces, and lay The microscope to your magnificence! Poets! and ye to whom 'tis more than life To break the bread of Fame, to feed on Glory, And drink the draught of Honourâye who toil To lift your heads above your fellow worms, And mar the relish of your real existence, By revelling in all unreal Entityâ Spurning the joys of ordinary men, With a dull distaste for all known delightâ Steeled in a strangely-sanguine stoicism, A wild life-clinging impulse, which forgets The life around it, phantasy-beguiledâ With a most quenchless ardour, and a deep Uneasy longing for ye know not whatâ Toiling for praise ye will not hear, for love Ye never can returnâfor fond remembrance And glowing reverence in the hearts of crowds, The fervour of whose yearning adulation, Will sadly mock your mouldering silentnessâ See what a whole World's lasting Praise is pent in! Be talked of in that speckâthere climb to grovelâ Soar from its spaceless point until you crawl Some hair-breadth higher then its creeping tenants; Go be the boast, the glory of an atom;â There vaunt yourselves the voice of viewless crowds, The Mouth-piece of the hearts of Multitudes, Whose mighty feelings fume within a speck! Yes! there be very famousâin a spark Even by yourselves 'mid thousand others lost For utter insignificance! VII. Oh could we fill the Universe itself, Aye, all which it inherit, with the sense, The consciousnes of our existenceâcould we charge With Soul, our Soul, the endless breadth of space, And pour the puissance of pervading Mind Throughout its unimaginable spreadingsâ Oh could we load its limitless extent With all-unchecked diffusion of our presence, And with the being of our large Renown Furnish the infiniteâuntil the range Of rapid-winking stars most coy of commune, Should tell of usâthisâthis methinks were meet, But meet Ambition for a Soul which claims Deathless Eternity!âCould we unveil The crowded tracts that lie far far beyond That canopy of golden gems, perchance We there might find fit object for the aim And aspiration of Eternal Spiritâ There haply might discover region fit For the expatiations unrestrained Of immaterial Immortality! VIII. But here, here in our pointlike nook remote, Our faintly-twinkling speck of light which shows Like to a grain of sand on boundless sandsâ Like to a bubble on a pathless oceanâ A leaf in forest-tracts interminableâ We cannot choose but waitâpatient and firmâ Wrapt in the calmness of inemulous hope, The quiet of a proud Humility;â Setting minuteness of the visible world, And littleness of those that tenant it, Against the majesty of unmeasured Space, And our own hopes of infinite Existence;â Deducing from our kinship with the one, A meek perception of our low estate, A cold indifference for its puppet pomp, Its paltry prides and dreams, pleasures and fears,â And reaping from our yearnings for the other A lofty consciousnessânot free from aweâ Of birth superior, nobler destiny;â Despising greatness, yet confessing weakness, And owning meanness, though expecting mightâ Thus should we restâtill Death do kindly couch Our blinded eyesâpurge our material ken,â Infuse the keenness of immortal vision Into these powerless orbs,âand with the glance, The lightning glance of mental sight, endow Our dull perception, till it brightly break The cooping thraldom of our bonds of clay, And, strong to pierce the âpalpable obscure,â Explore the secret, and embrace the mighty, Gloat o'er the boundlessness of all that is! 1830 and 1832. MIDNIGHT. âTell me moon, thou pale and grey Pilgrim of Heaven's pathless way, In what depth of night or day Seekest thou repose now!â Shelley. 'Tis dead of nightâyet downy sleep Sinks not upon my brow; There is a spell more calmly deep, That binds my spirit now: For 'tis the hour When Nature musing on her power, Seems hushed in awe, As if she scarcely dared her breath restrained to draw. In every lifeless object round There seems a pulseâa soul; Yet each is throbless, breathless bound, In mystic, mute control; Hist! with a throng Of whisperings, like the Sea-shell's song, The air is fraught,â Continuous, faint, and lowâthe very voice of Thought! The frequent sighs of dripping caves Are hollow, faint, and bland; And softly sink the crystal waves In smooth absorbing sand; More soft than they, This rippling Silence sings alwayâ More soft, more faint, This simmering Silence weaves its dimly-chiming plaint. The moonbeams rest upon the white And shadowed coverlet; The dusky flakes of bluish light Are crossed, like work of net, Depicting plain Each diamonded casement-pane;â In cautious mood They seem to peer around, ere further they intrude. And through the glistening mistry glass, The Moon, the curious elf, Its barrier half-inclined to pass, Is peeping in herself! She seems to wait Till those fair beams report the state Of all within, And tell when unperceived herself may entrance win. And though detected now, lest more Suspicion she excite, She keeps the look she had before, Unchangingâstirless quite! So when the rest Of watchful Spider you molest, In shrunken shape He boldly mimics death your notice to escape. What is this strange bright Thing, which draws So near at dead of night? Its growing presence almost awes With meekest, mutest might! It fills my roomâ In living Thought absorbs the gloomâ Its silence rife With Spirit seems,âintense with conscious, creeping Life! Why does its lonely softness flow So sadly on the heart, And whence the bright, the tearful woe It does to all impart? That look so wornâ Whence is it, Wanderer most forlorn? Or why dost keep Weak watch, and go thy rounds, when all the strong ones sleep? Would'st tell of slight unkindâof dire Neglect, that thou dost break My chamber's gloom?âwill none admire? Oh is not love awake? Then I full fain Will bless thee in a simple strain; And soothly say Thy light is sweeter far than gaudy glare of Day! 1830, &amp; 1832. [This brave bright Earth with Mind o'erflowsâ] âBut it was all a mystery.â Don Juan. This brave bright Earth with Mind o'erflowsâ With secret Soul o'erfraught; In every form a Feeling glows, In every tone, a Thought! And yet o'er all there seems to reign, A mystery I can ne'er explain! I feel the joy of frolic rills, Elate in forest brown; The proud reserve of beetling hills, Their calm majestic frown; The dark defianceâsullenâhighâ Of clouds that walk the stormy sky! The sweet repose the solemn caves Of azure heaven possess; The dim might of careering waves,â The Ocean's restlessness! The sad despondence of a day Oppressed with mists of mournful gray! The deep intelligence of Stars I mark with mute delight; No want of kindred feeling mars My glory in the Night! The Moon's meek thoughts I cannot shun, Nor miss the rapture of the Sun! The joy of trembling grass I know, The wild soul of the breeze; The languor of each leaning bough, The quiet of the trees; The revelry of hissing showers, And all the moods of thoughtful Flowers. Yes !âI can feel the Soul, the Mind, That breathes through Nature's faceâ To its expressions am not blind, Her mighty feelings traceâ And yet o'er all there seem to reign Deep mysteries I can ne'er explain! June 3rd, 1832. A SUMMER THOUGHT. How oft you see, in summer bright, Two butterflies, on wings of light, So like, in colour, form and flight That each seems either to the sight!â With tremulous flutter, low or high, Their flower-like forms together fly; One impulse guides them both, as they Together wing their zig-zag way; Direct, aslant, above, below, Still side by side they gaily go!â Thus, one in each emotion, thrill, My heart and thine accorded still; And thus, alike in aim and hue, Our thoughts and hopes together flew! May, 1832. TO BIANCA. As one, who having looked upon the Sun, Deems every object of his after-sight Wrapt in a swimming shroud, obscure and dun, Of throbbing gloomâso much the Daystar's might Of quivering brilliancy his vision crushed, So much surpassed all else of fair and bright;â Thus when the beams of loveliness which gushed From thy meek form and, mind had filled the gaze Of my arrested Soul, upon me rushed Such blindness to what else had won my praise, Such darkness dimmed what else had moved my sighs,â I see no beauty in the vermeil glaze Of other cheeksâno heart in other eyesâ In other hearts no love, no tenderness to prize. And as the eyes, which thus without a screen Have met that flashing orb, when closed may see Full many an image of the Sun in green Emerge from out the purple vacancy;â So when thine absence throws a veil around All things that once had interest for me, Making this crowded world a void profound, A barren blank, in which no spot of rest My listless gaze of apathy hath crowned,â I see upon the dim inane imprest Thy sweet resemblance multiplied ;âa throng Of visions of that Day-star of my breast In each remembered aspect flit along, And cheer my sinking heartâand reawake my Song. 1832. SONG. I love thee, my own one! how muchâcan I tell? I love theeâOh would I could sing thee as well! Oh would that my love could extort from the Nine, A measure as noble as thou art divine! I know that thy charms could immortalise song, But I feel that my lays would thy loveliness wrong; For that face is so sweetâOh, I never can feignâ I can sing, but âI love thee, andâlove thee again!â But could I describe thee, love, just as thou art, With their numbers the Nine might unwelcomed depart; For the worldâso enchanting the picture would beâ Could not think of the numbers, for thinking of thee! There are bards who can sing the fair Angels they love In strains might be chanted by Angels above; But strive as I may to be lofty, my strain Still recurs to, âI love thee, andâlove thee again!â 'Tis not that those Angels are fairer, I trow, Than a dear winsome Angel who smiles on me now; No! their verses in vain with my song would compete, Were my song half as good as its subject is sweet! And I will not, I cannot, believe it to be, That their love could be greater than mine is for thee; Oh no, for if Truth could give worth to a lay, I need not have blushed for my numbers to day! Then my own one I know will confide in me still, Though by fancy deserted, unaided by skill; For my heart, not my Muse, bids me sing thee a strain, Which but vows that âI love thee, andâlove thee again!â THE NIGHTINGALE. âEven yet thou art to me, No birdâbut an invisible thing, A voiceâa mystery!â Wordsworth.âTo the Cuckoo. I It is nightâsilent night; restless winds have gone awayâ And the trees may in quiet sleep; And the stars, that like fawns had been scared by the stranger Day, Now timidly nearer creep; Your glance threads its way through their crowds, shining high and low, As it might through a motionless swarm Of insects that play in the summer even's glow, As they hang in the twilight warm. II As you look on the star-dropt dome, you may feel the soft dews Stealing downward like flakes of cool air; And flowers unseen their faint fresh odours diffuse, Through the thin darkness everywhere! The trees are so stillâthey seem in a trance to lie! Like dark clouds they thoughtfully stoopâ Their soft dusky foliage mixed with the mellow gray skyâ A spirit-like shadowy group! III How meekly in the pale gleaming sky are those starry eyes spread, O'er the corpse-like Earth, wrapt in gloom! Like the innocent wax-lights which burn o'er the regal Dead, Laid in state in a palace-room! And brightly that still Sky is watching the dark Earth below, As a sweet bright-eyed Child surveys Its Mother's black robes, and her shrouded face of woe, With a silent and wondering gaze. IV Did it startle you, Silenceâor charm you to joy?â that strain? It broke out with strange sweet power, And presently ceasedâand the darkness and hush again Have settled o'er meadow and bower! But again and again it wells forthâOh, pleasant and rare Is its changeful capricious controul! It is playfulâenrapturedâdespairing by turnsâtill the air Seems refined into living soul! V From the Ocean of Night how strangely those sounds emerge! How fitfully flitting along, Now hid by the black waves of Silence, now seen o'er their verge, Comes the air-cleaving, argent-winged Song! It would seem that grim Darkness, usurping the throne of Day, Did strive with persuasion bland, To win to himself the support and the love, if he may, Of the conquered and mourning Land! VI A surpriseâa delight, that Oasis of Harmony seemsâ 'Tis unlooked for, unwonted, I ween, When Silence and Sleep sit brooding o'er nestling Dreamsâ As the white Moon at midday seen! Not more strange, when benighted, no human dwelling near, In some deep lane or lonesome glen, Would it be, in the darkness close by, should you suddenly hear Low voices of talking men! VII Not more strange is the sound, when the livid sky's obscured, Of a bee humming on through the gloom; Some lone minstrel-bee of the wildernessâallured By the dark furze's golden bloom! Not more strange or delightful, to the Mariner so rude May the velvet-winged butterfly be, Wafting dreams of green fields, through some silent solitude Of the violet, silvery sea! Butterflies, carried out to sea in gales of wind, are sometimes met with hundreds of miles from any land. VIII What art thou, who flingest thy fullness of feeling pure O'er the voiceless abysm of Night? Why thy lone Star of Sound, why art gemming the mute obscure With thy single point of Light? What is peer to thy beautiful loneness? what like to thee shows?â Like a rose-bud in winter thou art; Like Faith at a funeral, joyfulâlike Love when it glows In a crime-bedimmed, desperate heart! IX Like a Sorceress fair, whose employment we cannot guess; Though fearful it needs must be! As she stoops o'er her work, and sings in her loneliness, She deemeth no eye can see; Then she holds flitting converse, with some Spirit-Familiar near, Whose answers in silence are lost; And her voice though so low, in the Night-hush sounds awfully clearâ But what says she? whom can she accost? X Thou art like a young Poet, who deep in his midnight retreat Gains him skill while the soulless sleep; Breathing fragments of song, would make even sorrow sweet, Or win you with gladness to weep! Till his voice full and clear through the listening world resound, And men to his spirit bow down:â While the Stars shining through the cold Night of Neglect around Are the glimpses of dear Renown! XI Thou art like a meek Maiden, left lonely awhile and drear By the loved-one whose presence was Day; Fondly feeding her grief on the songs which to him were dear, And the tunes which he loved her to play; And yet, though the Night-gloom of Absence, remembrances sweet, Starlike, of his true love rollâ Of their thoughts held in commonâtheir confidence complete, And of all their deep oneness of Soul! XII Hark! seems it not Rapture is flashing those rays of verse? âSing a strain of exceeding Delight! Sing the heart-thrill of feeling alone, unbeheld to commÃ©rce With the Stars, the Soul of Night! From my leafy-roofed well of seclusion, my gushing joy leaps To their sweet glances all mine own! Mine, mine are the Earth and the Sky! for the world of life sleepsâ Joy! Joy! I am all alone!â XIII Then Cheerfulness sheds her moonbeams of melody bright:â âOh tranquil our days shall be; Our own fond thoughts all my worldâmy task and delight The sweet one of tending thee! In a loving lone dream, from our sheltered shades we will trace The golden-paced Day till he fliesâ Then tunefully doat on the soft-illumined face Of Nightâand those spiritual eyes!â XIV It is hushedâand lo! Sorrow is raining her liquid plaint:â âWhyâwhy hast thou flown from me! Thy form was the food of my Soulâmy spirit is faint With mournfully pining for thee! The Stars have no light for me nowâfor Thou art away! âDarkâdark as my heart is the Sky! âAnd the clear solemn Night is no dearer now than Dayâ âOh why hast thou left me, whyâwhy?ââ XV Methinks as I listen, that it cannot well be true, Spirit-voice! who art warbling thus, That Sorrow, Hope and Joy are not keenly felt by you As ever they can be by us! And the glory of Man, what is it? his excellence, where? When his songs which have most of divine, Whose Fame wraps the Nationsâeternalâwide-spread as the Airâ Are so easily surpassed by thine? XVI But if you sing so blithely, though darkling and all alone, Can it be that repining Men O'er whom Grief, Doubt, Bereavement, have their deepest shadows thrown, Should be utterly despairing then? Oh! methinks we are bidden by that cheerily-gushing breath, To be patient yet a little while, Till the Mystery of Heaven and Earth, Life, Sorrow, and Death, In the Daylight of Knowledge shall smile! July, 1832. LOVE THE POET. âLove the Poet, pretty one.â Barry Cornwall. Thou, divine in Beauty's dower! Thou to whom the World must bow! Love the Poet! name of Powerâ Name divine as thou! Maker, he, of mental treasureâ All delight, above, beneath; Soothing sorrowâtearful pleasure, Life, Existence, Death! All of lovely, pure, excelling Which refines the soul from Earthâ From the clayey prison-dwelling Of its lowly birth! Love him, lovely one, whose duty 'Tis to love all lovelinessâ All the world can know of beautyâ More than it can guess. Fire, of more than mortal splendour Makes his breast a lightning cloud;â Not less lofty 'tis than tender, Sensitive as proud! He will mark each faint expression Of the voice, the form, the face, Shedding in its transient session Momentary grace; Gesture, look, or tone concealing Subtle charm from duller eyeâ Flitting glimpse of thought or feeling, All will he descry, Though less fleetly vary-sheening Rainbow-coloured rays of light Glance o'er tresses intervening 'Twixt the Sun and sight! Through your heart his Mind shall travel Reading its sweet workings wellâ Each emotion, throb, unravel Which you cannot tell! Lofty feeling, pure and holy, He will give it honour dueâ Delicate weakness, fond or lowly, He will cherish too! And with Fancy so prevailing He will sing his loved-one fair, It will turn a very failing To a beauty rare! In such witching hues each merit By his love-tones shall be drestâ You will feel yourself a Spirit, Or an Angel blest! And young Love's divine delusion Which they say must fly so fast, In his fancy's rich profusion He will bid it last. While his judgment fore-discerning Shall secure him from the fate Of that Disappointment, turning Coldness into Hate! His rich words such robes of glory O'er thy lineaments shall throw, 'Mid the fairest dreams in story Shall thine Image glow! Thou shalt shine so in his pages, Crowds to come shall worship thee; There the love of future ages Shall concentred be! To such insight he will move you Into things that common be; You shall find a Soul to love yon In each star and tree! He will bid to instant being Brighter worlds than yet have beenâ Worlds evading vulgar seeingâ You shall be their Queen! And his Mind shall so adore you, So shall make its might your own, Time and Space shall bow before you, Universe your Throne!â Would you bound in bright upbuoyance From a sad world, blighted, banned? Would you lead a life of joyance In a fairy land? Would you have each finest beauty Well discerned and fully prized? Not a charm of feeling, duty, Overlookedâdespised? Would you learn all lore that's rarest, And be loved by all for ever? Love the Poet! sweetest, fairest, Oh reject him never! Nov. 1832. REMORSE. A FRAGMENT. The fierce demands the self-attacking breast Makes for the motives it but now possestâ Pressing for reasons it can ne'er accord, Reasons for conduct now contemned, abhorred:â The bitter curses on its weakness cast, Deep imprecations on its frenzy pastâ When waking to a consciousness of crime From passion which obscured it for a time, It views the work on which its rage was spent With gloomy horrorâblank astonishment!â The torturing Thought that all Remorse is vain, That nothing can undo that deed againâ Prayers, curses, tears, can move it not, nor woundâ Those soul-shot arrows on the soul reboundâ There, sternly fixed, irrevocably done, Accuser, judge, avenger, all in one,â Its maddening muteness mocks the wretch who gave It birthâits palled Creator now its Slave!â The furious efforts of the Soul to flee From that o'erwhelming, withering Certainty,â Her wildest plungings in the tangling toils, But make more keenly felt the clinging coils, The deepening dints of that still, clankless chain, That circling mute Omnipotence of Pain!â And silently, as some increasing Tide Swells on the barrier which confronts its pride, That Thought unfolds the fullness of its might And brings its still Resistlessness to light! Then, as some Monster of his prey secure, Despising haste where victory is sure, Sports him with pangs which faint and fainter grow, Watching his victim's deathâthough certain, slow;â So that Reflection sees the Spirit cower, Beneath its crushing weight of passive powerâ Distracted with vain struggles to get free, And maddening with excess of Miseryâ Exhausting self in fruitless self-defence, And writhing in convulsive impotence! The Mind resigned to Reason all too late, Itself the only object of its hate, In vain reproaches on reproaches urgeâ Itself the victim, and itself the scourge! Waging on agonising War with Air It whirls within the Maelstrom of Despair! December 25th, 1832. SONG. Nay!âit was not thy loveliness lured me, Though all that is lovely be thine; It was something more dear that assured me Thy soft heart could sorrow with mine! And oft, when around thee there hovered The bright and the joyous and free, Oh say not 'twas Fancy discovered My gloom was as welcome to thee! All power, all wish of resistance Thy tranquil simplicity stole: Thy love reawoke my Existence; Thy form superseded my Soul! Yet it was not thy loveliness lured me, Though all that is lovely be thine; It was something more dear that assured me, Thy soft heart could sorrow with mine! January, 1832. [My ownâmy absent one! thou who art still] My ownâmy absent one! thou who art still Though absent, ever present!âif I strive My page with radiance of thy Form to fill, And to the outward eye thine Image give In lineaments of loveliness as clear As in my inmost Soul secluded liveâ Alas! what boots the fond attempt to cheer The weary pining of my woe-worn breast? Still as I dwell on each remembrance dear, And pore on all that cannot be exprest, Communion feigned makes Solitude more drearâ Such Opiate goads to more convulsed Unrest. What solace springs from dreaming thou art near? The worn impatient writheâthe bitter, blinding tear! PAUL PREACHING AT ATHENS SUGGESTED BY THE CARTOON OF RAFFAELLE. The glorious gathering of palaces, Where groves of whitest pillars proudly rose,â The temples, rife with capital and frieze, And frequent with the silent life which glows In marble statues, mocking human woes And frail Mortality, with godlike mien, And pure perfection of divine repose, Secure as calm, immortal as serene,â Made Athens and her hill a more than earthly scene. As two long waves approach with swelling might, And meetingâere in backward curl o'erthrownâ Shoot up with boiling crests to equal height; So reared that hill its tower-studded crown: Like foam-streaks, on its verdure-chequered brown The girdling walls ran up from side to side; And high o'er all, Minerva's fane looked down In dignified reserve, retiring prideâ And like her own chaste browâstill, solemn, quiet-eyed. But with far nobler charms that fair clime shone; In every porch and grove young Genius stept; Seemed it her very Atmosphere had grown Subtle with Intellect; the sunbeam crept Athwart her pillared shades, and on it slept The Spirit of deep Musing; Attic bees On her lone hills a thoughtful music kept; Inquiry murmured in the plaintive breeze, And stooped in pensive Reverie the stilly trees. There all the little vain, the humble great, Of the Mind's children dwelt;âher throne of Pride It was,âher ever-famed, world-worshipped seat Of centuries of Triumph:âthither hied Sage, Sophist, Bard, Philosopher, and vied In wrestling-bouts of Reason;âkeenly blind Each wildest wilderness of Thought they tried; Their marts the SchoolsâWisdom their wealth refined, They long monopolised all merchandise of Mind. Thither, well-nigh two thousand years ago, While some dreamed dreams ingeniously untrue, And more, in wonted idlesse, to and fro, Lounged listlessly in search of âsomething new,â Toil-worn and travel-soiled came there a Jew: While the broad Sun did westering expand,â Simple, august, serene, amid a crew Of hoary sages, dark-browed, subtle band, High-raised on Mars's hill, methought I saw him stand! His outstretched arms seemed raised to waft his soul Far o'er the Abyss, the unfathomable Sky, Where the great mysteries of the Future roll; Majestically still, his lighted eye, Dilating to embrace Eternity, Deep-held in awe appeared, as by the vast Presence of mighty Thoughts, divinely high, Which o'er his mind their brooding Shadows cast, And terribly sublime, entranced him as they past! In various mood, around him listening prest, The Stoic, who plucked passions up, like weeds, And rooted all the man from out his breast; And he who gave a loose in words and deeds To that sad bitterness man's baseness breedsâ The snarling Cynic; and the tribe whose aim, The present pleasure to which virtue leads, Was oft exchanged for that which vice may claim;â With these came many more of every sect and name. The Epicurean scowled to hear of meed And penance paid on that extremest Day; The Cynic laughed to think another creed Would lend excuse to persecute and slay; The Stoic heard without confest dismay, Words which the Mind's stern mastery o'erthrew And spurned its self-sufficiency away; The haughty Roman scorned the humble Jew; And smiling calm contempt, the polished Greek withdrew. Some mocked in mirthful wonderment, and thought Madness alone in such wild visions dealt; With upraised brows, protruded lipsâsome sought To look the candour which they never felt, And much on common sense and reason dwelt; Some seemed to feel Philosophy required Fair hearing even for error; others knelt, Such love and reverence his words inspired: But his presumption more with indignation fired. And thrilling 'twas, that memorable day To hear such lips to men like those rehearse The wonder-works of Deity; display In eloquence, electric, burning, terse, The solemn Spirit of the Universe. Unmoved by withering glance, full fiercely hurled, Ill-feigned indifference, or open curse; The lip compressed in hate, or scornful curled; He stoodâthe moral Atlas of a mightier world! Oh would he to our awe-struck gaze appear, As then he seemedâa Being of the Skyâ Majestic tenant of a nobler Sphereâ Creation gathered on his browâhis eye Sublime with Immortality! Can that be heâthe peasant churl insaneâ The scorn of that illustrious companyâ Barbarian babbler, visionary vain? Oh could the pride of Mind that glorious One disdain! Nov. 1832. L'Envoy. âMy soul's child!â Byron. Child of my Spirit, go!â Hope not the world's regard to steal; Thy little worth too well I know, Too sadly feel! Yet fondly weak, I wait, Not much in Hopeâmuch more in Fearâ Soul of my Solitude! thy fateâ My comrade dear! Thy fate, of frequent nights And days, my Comrade dearâmy Child! Who whence I know not, brought delights Deep, deep and wild!â Yet go!âno laurel crown, No darling meed of Fame expect; But with Oblivion lay thee down, And woo Neglect! What though, sweet Muse! when Day Poured joy profuse with liberal hand O'er all the glistering display Of sea and land,â Or chiefly when at Night Silence held soft solioquy, Grown vocal with extreme Delight And Liberty,â With me thou didst commune, And lapse of linkÃ«d numbers bring, If with a Spirit out of tune I heard thee sing! If with their amber flow My Soul chimed not in pure concent, But with them jarring notes of woe Discording blent; As silver raindrops strewn Brightly by dark clouds sun-bestrid, Are stained by fogsmokes which festoon A City hid!â No! thou couldst not impart The Hope elastic, Fancy strong, Which o'erinform the joyous heart With crystal song! From feelings of its own Some respite must the Spirit gain, Ere those by thee divinely shown It well can feign. Then wing, my Soul! thy flightâ On lowly verse, a voyage brief; Success not proffering much delight, Nor failure, grief! Go forth! despising Fame; With nought of Hope, with little Fear: A few, few yearsâand praise or blame Thou wilt not hear! Till thenâthere is a Pride, A stern nor bitter Hopelessness, Which gives the Mind, o'er worlds defied, Serene success! THE END.</field>
