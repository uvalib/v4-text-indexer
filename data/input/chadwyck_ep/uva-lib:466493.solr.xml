By Nature plantedâand by Nature rear'dâ Uncultur'd emblem of Life's chequer'd gleamâ Fresh from no dew-dropâby no sunshine chear'd, To animate its fade that fondly seem, A humble flow'ret woos the summer-beam! Ye stormy winds, awhile your flight delay, That frets the current of its vital stream: Oh, let it bloom its short-liv'dâlanguid dayâ Thenâin the lapse of Timeâdie silently away! TO MY HARP. 1 The Sun had sunkâthe twilight glimmer'd round, And soon in darkness veil'd the gloomy sphere: When from a bough, sigh'd forth a plaintive sound, Breathing its softness on my listening earâ The wind was highâit echoed still more clearâ And oh, so soft the magic of its strain It seemed some seraph spirit hovering near: It ceas'd awhileâthen floated round again, So beautifully shrillâit haunted all the plain! 2 The Moon aroseâand aided by her light, I gaz'dâthis phantom of surprize to see; When, as in kindness to my longing sight, From the wild branches of a lonely tree, Droop'd this proud emblem of my minstrelsyâ I snatch'd the Harp, in joy, from whence it hung, And woke again its wandering melody: I took it to my cellâthe chords restrungâ 'Till, through the vaulted gloom, my every sorrow rung. 3 And thus my Lyre, we've pass'd the dreary hour That heavily swells out each tedious day; I oft have stolen a tale from Passion's power, And thou hast charm'd a sweetness o'er my lay, Which else had glided, silently, away:â Much as I thank thee for the generous glow Thy spell hath thrown upon my Fancy's play, Yet one smile more, perchance thou wilt bestow, On the wild transports of my mind I offer to thee now! TO THE BEAUTIFUL MISS? 1 Shall Time e'er embitter these moments of Pleasure, Or lower the bright Sun of this joyous Day? Shall Fate's gloomy showers E'er shadow these bowers, Where in innocent raptures we happily stray? No, Maryâno, never! 2 Dear, dear, be the scenes where we wantonly roveâ And ever be cherish'd the sweets we here sip:â Long remember'd the blissesâ The sweet, artless kissesâ That have murmur'd from mine, to the rapturous lip, Of thee, Mary, my Love! 3 In this gleam of Delight, could I live an age thro' Of moments, with pleasure so joyously fraughtâ Yet how vain the regret, Should I strive to forget The happiness center'd in even a thought, My sweet Mary, of you! 4 Should the smile of Deceit, or adversity's breath, This bewildering sunshine of Hope ever blight; Or should Fate rudely chill That soft bosom, whose thrill Now glows with the soul of endearing Delight; Come then, Mary, Death! [When sunk beneath the swarded green] 1 When sunk beneath the swarded green In wakeless sleep are closed my eyes,â When nought save humble grave is seen, To tell the world where Sorrow lies: 2 Oh! then may one, I once so lov'd, In passing by my lowly tomb, By Pity drawnâby Friendship mov'dâ Shed a soft drop o'er misery's doom! 3 And may that kindly tearful eye Be dimm'd with Sympathy above my stone; And be that gently wafted sigh, Heav'dâbut to make my griefs its own! TO ???? ?????????? 1 I little thought when first we met, And smiling Friendship beam'd so brightly, So soon those days I should regretâ Or thou would'st treat their joys so lightly! 2 I thought not, when by Friendship aided, To mutual flame our Passions grewâ I e'er should see thine ardour faded, Or thou would'st cease to think mine, true! 3 I knew the wiles of woman's heartâ Truth I have seldom met in any! But did not think thine own'd the art That I have found, alas, in many! 4 Farewell ye scenes of gay delight, 'Midst which these happy moments rov'd! To joys, so dear to rapture's sightâ To them, and thee, I once so lov'd! 5 I lov'd themâor at least lov'd thee, With passion's warmest, tend'rest, glow; Unconscious, Time could e'er have prov'd thee, So false to all, save outward show! 6 In me you found a fond believerâ To Candour true, to Cunning loth; In thee I found a sad deceiverâ Faithful to one, and feigning both! 7 Retrace those days of pleasureâflownâ Review their many a happy token: Pause o'er those fleeting joys, now goneâ And view the heart thy folly's broken! 8 Deceitful, cruel, Maidâadieuâ 'Twould soothe my soul could I forget thee: But throbs, to Memory's bosom true, And sighs of sorrow, will not let me! 9 Farewellâand when by Death's kind hand, From earthly ills my soul shall sever; At my lone shrine let Pity stand, And weep o'er oneâundone for ever! FRAGMENT. I've tasted every sweet of pleasureâ In every joy I've borne some part: I dearly lov'dâI lost that treasureâ I once possess'dâbut broke that heart! TO A LADY On her departure for India. 1 See, as the Sun slow sinking in the west, Thro' clouds of Eve withdraws its beauty's ray, See, as departing to its couch of rest, Smile the faint glimmers of its glory's day! 2 As mildly setting, and its beams declining, Beneath yon veil it solemnly reposes, While round its tints, in splendour'd hue still shining, The gloom of Night, in misty darkness closes! 3 Thus Love, which Hope had cherish'd for awhile, Shone in the rapture of its heart's delight: A beauty-bud that op'd to Morning's smile, But fell oblivion'd in the shade of Night! 4 Oh, best belov'd! soul of each fond affectionâ To thee I pour my bosom's purest burning! I feel 'twas thusâyet pause sad recollection,â Thus was our loveâits joys no more returning! 5 Bright Star of Heav'n! my lonely wandering clearingâ How fair, how beautiful, thy ray has shone, How cloudless still, while dimly disappearing, My griefsâmy sorrowsâwill too wildly own! 6 Dearer than life, and friends that life endearing, Pulse of my heart, and each fond passion's swell, To thee, my gloomy hours no longer cheeringâ To thee I breathe, one lastâone sadâfarewell! 7 Absorb'd in dimness, my sad aching eye Would gaze, and weepâfond tear 'twere but in vain; For thee this bosom's every wafted sigh Would riseâwould heaveâbut ah, relapse again! 8 Fate harshly murmurs, âfarewell earthly peace, âFrom thee, from happiness, for ever riven!â Hope kindly whispers, âat the soul's release, âThere is a sphere ofâoh, there is a Heaven!â 9 There, my sweet girl, each soul to soul extending, We'll meet in bliss whose bloom will know no sorrow: In scenes of joy, the purest passions blendingâ In dreams, that wake not to a gloomy morrow! WRITTEN BENEATH A PICTURE. 1 Beneath this sketch of Mary's face, How vainly does the muse essay To add one gleam to Beauty's grace, Or splendor to its heavenly ray! 2 'Twere vain to draw in brighter glow The workings of the painter's art: Suffice it, lovely Girl, to knowâ Their charms enslav'd my doating heart! TO A ROSE. 1. Ah! lovely bloom, divinely sweet, How dear thy charms to me: Thy bud, expanding with the dawn, Gives splendor to the verdant lawnâ 'Tis there, thy flow'r I seeâ Thy odour, there, I greet! 2. Thy crimson'd garbâthy vivid hue Afford a varied pleasure; They yield a comfort to the sad, And heighten e'en the heart that's glad.â Beauty's fondest treasureâ Beauty's best emblem, too! 3. I gladden at thy sight, and smile, Yet know there's one that's dearer: My Mary's beauty decks that green Where Fashion's fairest form is seen: I pauseâand find my vision clearer, And gaze on her the while! 4. Sweet Girl, may joy attend thy life, And guard in peace its happy hours; And should thy mind, from sorrow free, Bestow one thought on distantâmeâ Oh, bid it nurse the pleasing gleaming, Nor sigh for future joysâunknown; Whilst I, remote from busy strife, In silent peace, adore the powers Which bind my soul, with rapture beaming, To sigh for thee alone! [In fabled lore, I've heard 'tis stated] 1 In fabled lore, I've heard 'tis stated, The Heart two sources has to drain: And Joy and Sorrow, tis related, Usurp, alternately, the reign! 2 Where are these blisses prov'd so dearly? Where is the heart such joys partaking? I've liv'd to loveâand that, sincerelyâ But only find that mine is breaking! TO MISS? On her leaving the Country. 1 Adieuâand when in distance straying, By thought, sad relict, solely guided; When 'midst those scenes, new charms displaying, That thought shall waft to friends divided: 2 Oh! from the throng, select one dear one, With himâto share fair Memory's shrine: His heart, oh, deem it a sincere oneâ And know, in friendship it is thine! 3 The pangs of grief have prov'd his soul, Estrang'd to Passion's wild career: It owns no pulse's mad controulâ It heaves and shedsânor sigh nor tear! 4 The gem it drops, is Pity's dewâ Wrung from a mine of feeling flame: Which presence long will temper trueâ And absence ever prove the same! FAREWELL. By wordsâby tongueâcan be exprest The mind of Man, when broken-hearted? Can years of peace console the breast, From earthly joys, for ever parted? Alas, the pangs by grief imparted, To pitying eyes, its force will tellâ In ceaseless sighsâin tears just started, Behold its wildâits long âFarewell!â ADDRESS To the Picture of? 1 Come to me, imageâsweetestâdearestâ And soothe my bosom's bursting grief; Since she, whose lovely smile thou wearest, Has ceas'd to give my mind relief! 2 Still sparkling in that livid smile, Beam recollections blandly dear; And in that eye's bewitching wile, The magic, which I thought sincere! 3 I lov'd her fondlyâwoo'd her tooâ To own her, was not my proud lot; And all the vows I sigh'd so true, Are fated worse, than if forgot! 4 'Tis pastâand oh, how vain to trace One glow, to calm my tortur'd breast; So goâthou fair, deceitful faceâ Nor longer break upon my rest! TO MARIAN. Marian, thy smile of Beauty, and the gleam Of that bold eyeâof such expressive bloom, Whose hue, unstain'd by Sorrow's dew of gloom, Shines like the radiance of the Sapphire's beamâ So bright, oh, God! the splendor of its rays, Is scarcely balanc'd by the diamond's lustre: And though thy raven ringlet's clustre, At timesâmay veil the beauty of its blaze; Yet, like the mighty Sun of Heaven's boundâ Forcing its clouds of gloomâso dense and darkâ So does thy lovely orbit's glowing spark Glance wildly forthâand dazzle all around! That smile of Pleasure, modestly extending O'er the soft colour of thy crimson cheek; And the mild blush, so beautifully meekâ All that is fairest and most perfectâblending, Seem some celestial union to bespeak! Such are thy charmsâby Virtue proudly prov'dâ Envied by all who know thee, yet by all belov'd! PARTING. 1 Farewellâand be happyâbut never forget In the smiles of the present, the times that are past; Oh, think with delight, on the hour when we metâ On the joys of that firstâon the pangs of this last! 2 Remember the vows which in youth we have sigh'd, In the moments of passions, so ardent, and sweet; And by the last kiss, on thy fair lip that diedâ Preserve them as chaste, 'till again we may meet! 3 And though thy light heart may awhile steal away From the chain of thy feeling, in moments of glee; Yet memory still shall usurp her fond sway, And bring back the truant, in bondage, to me! 4 'Midst the tears of the few, or the smiles of the many, That fall, or may sparkleâto balance thy brow, Oh, remember those pangs, the sincerest of anyâ That have softened me everâthat sadden me now! 5 They will tell thee, thou liv'st in my memory still, In a rapture of hope, but a stranger before; And will shew thee a bosom, whose agonized thrill, Once contented to love theeânow learns to adore! 6 Farewellâin that bosom's most tender devotionâ Thou shalt live, my sweet girl, tho' we're fated to sever; This Life's every impulseâmost faithful emotion, Thou soul of that Life, shall be thineâand for ever! SONG. 1 The heart may beatâthe bosom riseâ In all the gloom of sorrow's hue; The tear may stain those lovely eyes, That never dropp'd, before, their dew! 2 Heed notâ'tis but a hectic gleam, Caught from the force of passioned pain; 'Tis as delusive, as the dream That hovers round the slumb'ring brain! 3 But if, diffused by hope or fear, The bosom pantsâthe fair cheek flushes; 'Tis thenâmildâlovelyâand sincereâ And only then, that Virtue blushes! A REFLECTION. Like some faint light that shines along the deep, Joy to the watchfulâpeace to those who sleepâ Its blaze expanding, as each heart draws near The home, where sparkles every smile that's dear; 'Till from its splendor, welcom'd in at lastâ Fades all Reflection on the gloomy past! So, in its birth, glows Man's pale beam of life, The spark of sorrowâthen the flame of strifeâ Dazzling awhile, until its glare be spent On deeds of madness, and of dark intentâ Next, a bright Beacon on his troubled Seaâ Bursting, at length, into Eternity! ELEGIAC STANZAS. â SISTE VIATOR! 1 Where the low willow bends On the brow of the Mountainâ While its soft foliage lends Shade to the Fountain! 2 Where the wild breezes die In the play of the Riverâ Where their soft echoes sigh, Mournfully ever! 3 Where Evening's warbler hies, When Summer's day has bloom'dâ Thereâa fall'n hero liesâ Lowly entomb'd! 4 Sayâdidst thou hear the charms Of the hoarse cannon's yell, Or the wild clash of arms?â âTwas, there, he fell! 5 He diedâand Honour rears Her veil of sorrow o'er himâ Yet Fame restrains the tears, That thus deplore him! 6 He sleepsâhis awful slumber, No throbs of woe assailâ The night bird's lonely number, Tells his sad tale! 7 Unhonour'dâmourn'dâadmir'dâ No stone to mark the spotâ The name that all hearts fir'd, Perchance forgot! 8 All round is hush'd and stillâ Calm as his dreamless sleepingâ Save the soft purling rill, Beside him, weeping! 9 Lo, the pale Primrose leaf O'er him its tendrils wave! The lonely sign of Grief, Over his grave! 10 Let not the wind's rude tone Break on his restâ Let Woman's sigh, alone, Waft o'er his breast! 11 Andânurs'd 'midst it's sorrows, dearâ Forcing the smile of Pride, Let the sad, silent tear, Tell how he died! TO? 1 Oh, Lady! keep the lute I gaveâ Its touch may turn a thought on me: Oh, save it from oblivion's grave, And wake its slumb'ring minstrelsy! 2 For I have often heard its sound In rapt'rous cadence, die away; In it, have far more pleasure found, Than, elsewhere, cheer'd my happier day! 3 When every melting word that stole, Breath'd forth some joy I sigh'd to thee; Or that fond commune of the soul, That echoed back from thine to me! 4 Why is it tacitâwhy art thou, So cold unto my soul's endeavour? Silent and darkâoh, where is now The strain of love, the smile of pleasure? 5 'Tis soâfarewellâthe chords are muteâ The fire that thrill'd themâcoldly deadâ Away, my faithless love and luteâ Thy heart is falseâits rapture fled! TO MEDINA. 1 Serene as day, ere glittering PhÅbus dawn O'er the dense vapours that debar the lightâ Pure as that light, which welcomes in the mornâ Has nature form'd thee, thou endearing sprite! In thee, I view each pleasureâeach delightâ All that now charms this solitary place: Form'd to attract, thou dazzle-est the sightâ Unfolding all the magic of thy face, Like the resplendent glare of Heaven's solar grace! 2 Nor less unequall'd are those sensual charms, That smile in beauty, from thy mind's bright eyeâ Where Reason, seated 'midst her proud alarms, Checks the wild pulse, or the unmeaning sigh, In other maiden breasts, that idly lie. While o'er thy cheek, at times, pervades a thought, That seems some fond intenseness to descryâ But not of sorrowâ'tis a hectic caught From Feeling's silent cellâwith contemplation wrought! 3 Lovely alikeâand virtuous all as wellâ Pure in its glow, as Abbot's dying pray'râ Flower of my lonely bosom's tranquil swell, Dear to my heart, as to mine eye so fair, Thy fairy image hovers, ever, thereâ I love theeâand its anxious pow'r to prove, One tender wish shall be my constant careâ Lasting in joysâoh, happy be thy love, 'Till, Nature's boon reliev'd, thy Spirit waft above! THE CAPTIVE'S SONG. 1 The war that proudly swell'd the field, Still rages in its wild career: The sword that Freedom bid me wield, Is fall'nâand I am captive here! 2 The Sun that rose to light our toil, Still glances, brightly as beforeâ It beamsâupon the battle-soilâ It setsâagainst my prison door! 3 But what avails this thought of dread, That flits across my tortur'd mind? I feelâmy lofty spirit's fledâ I knowâmy limbs are here confin'd! 4 Yetâcould I brave this bondage pain, Which round my goaded bosom throngs: Oh, I could smile upon my chain, Could that but calm my Country's wrongs! 5 E'en Death were welcome then to me; If thus her injur'd thoughts could die, The spell that set her thraldom free, Should be my latestâdying sigh! This last verse is an almost literal translation from some lines, found in the Castle of Segoviaâas Patriotic as beautiful! TRIBUTARY STANZAS. The dreams of Youthâthe pride of other daysâ That gaudy sceneâthe world's deceitful blazeâ The bland allurement of whose giddy throng, Has charm'd my mind, in wantonness, thus long; The warm caresses of each friendly eye, Which fetter'd, firmer, every friendly tieâ The welcome of the crowdâthe social few I lik'd enough, its int'rest to renew; The smile of Beauty, and her speaking tear, Breathing its woes upon the anxious earâ Hope's shapeless visionsâjoy's too brief delightâ Fade from the view, and set in Sorrow's night! How vain, to cast the retrospective eye On scenes like these, now idly floated byâ On days of madness, whose decline retains The sting of anguishâFolly's bondag'd pains! On that gay crew, companions of my prideâ The wanton glanceâthe bowl's seductive tideâ Brief in its pleasureâ(âlasting in its woeâ) Like the wild sparkles, dying in its flow! On all the phrenzy of mine earlier time, That lull'd its victim in unconscious crime. And what avails, tho' thousand beaming eyes Should glance their lightnings from those lucid skies, She, whom my bosom sigh'd alone to loveâ Endear'd by ties, e'en Fancy's hopes aboveâ The fair deceiver of my ev'ry toil, Friend and associate of my Life's turmoil, The fond, the lonely guardian of my fateâ She, too, is goneâand left me desolate. Such is the pastâthe present is a waste Of woes unsever'dâsorrows yet to taste: Passing their clouds of Passion o'er the mindâ And then in darkness silently confin'd! In throbs of painâawhile by grief reliev'dâ In prospects blighted, and in hopes deceiv'dâ In thoughts, contending from their force to part, Anguish of feelingâbrokenness of heartâ Pilgrim below, whatever lot be thine, My sorrows sigh, âit cannot equal mine!â Such is the pastâthe moment's pleasing thrill, May lure thy Fancyâcalm thy feelings, stillâ But on the future, if thy thought should waveâ Shrink from the prospectâ'twill but shew the grave! FAREWELL TO MY HARP. 1 Thus far, I've ventur'd on the dangerous way, That distantly points out the path to fame: Thus long, with thee, beguil'd each lingering dayâ Companion of my griefs and joys, the same, The greatest solaceâonly friend, I claim! And what avails, though Fortune should bestow Her dazzling honours on an humble name? Oh, can it add to pleasureâexile woe? Then far be Pomp's proud glareâI envy not its glow! 2 Should friendship pass our faults in silence by, Or partial praise sit smiling on our song; I'll thank each bosom for it's generous sigh, Yet fain relinquish the seductive throng, To thee, alone, its tribute shall belongâ Remote from strife, I'll pass the lonely hour, Retiring from such giddy scenes, among! Cherish, awhile, this frail life-emblem's flower, Then woo the scythe of Fate, and bend beneath its power! 3 Farewell my Harpâwhile Memory holds her sway O'er the past fondness of my fancy's dream, It's grateful due to thee it long shall pay, Dwell with delight, and oft with rapture teem, At the wild softness of thy wandering theme! Farewellâthe fire that warm'd thee, now is chillâ Dimly o'ershadowing pleasure's fading beam; Hark, to the last faint cadence of thy thrillâ Now, fare thee well againâfor, lo, 'tis mutc and still! FINIS.</field>
