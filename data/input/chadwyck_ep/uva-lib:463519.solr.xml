      <field name="fulltext">Est Deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo; ???????? ?????? ?????. To the Honorable Colonel, Sr. HERBERT PRISE Knight, The staffe of his Family, and the honor of his Countrey; the Author wisheth augmentation of happinesse in this life, and perfection of glory in the life to come. TO THE Reader. I am not Eagle ey'd to face the Sun, My mind is low, and so my Verse doth run. I do not write of Stars to make men wonder. Or Planets how remote they move asunder. My shallow River thou may'st foord with ease, Ways, which are fair, and plain can nere displease. R. W. Concerning God and Christ. Veriùs cogitatur, quàm dicitur, &amp; veriùs est, quàm cogitatur. Presumptuons man gods Essence would define, Were he to reason subject, or to time: Angels in part may apprehend his nature, To comprehend him lies not in any creature: It is an easier labour to impart What thou art not, (O Lord) than what thou art No matter, form, or composition can Be found in God, as in a mortal man. He cannot be deceiv'd, he cannot lye, He cannot sin commit, he cannot dye. God may be angry with mans sinful way, And yet no passion doth his nature sway. His Center's every where: no humane sense, Or place can limit his circumference: Who can find out one God in persons three? Or how three persons can one Godhead be? Or how the holy Father, and the Sonne Coequal are before all worlds begun, As Christ is God, a mother he had not, As he is man, man never him begot. His Mother was a Virgin, chast, unstain'd; After Christs birth a Virgin she remain'd. She had a Son, nor did the Son unty The sacred bands of her Virginity. A Virgin, and a Mother; God, and man; Who these mysterious secrets riddle can? Approach not (O my soul) too near that light, Which will obscure, and dull the curious sight, My speech, and reason fails, Ile case my Lute, Wonder I may, but not of God dispute: FAITH. Fides famem non formidat; Bern. Although I am not pure, or white, But blacker than the shades of night, Although my sins in heaps do lye Like Crimson red, or scarlet dye; Yet through the grace of God I know I shall be white, as wooll, or snow. Although my Harp is turn'd to wo, And I, like Pilgrims, mourning go, Although I feed on cares, like bread, And wash all night with tears my bed, Yet faith assures me, that my God, Will kisse me again, and burn his rod: Although the Devil doth prepare, And watch to take me in his snare; Though like a thief both night, and day He thinks to steal my soul away, Yet like a bird my soul shall fly Safe from the fowlers tyranny. Though friends will not support my need, But fail me like a broken reed, Although they love, but while 'tis fair, And leave me in the troubled air; Yet Christ my Rock is firme in love; And nothing can this Rock remove; Though corruption is my father, And although just death will gather My body to the peaceful number Of those, that in their graves do slumber, Though I am dust, yet thence ile rise, And see my Saviour with these eyes. Upon Christs Nativity or Christmasse. From three dark places Christ came forth this day, First from his Father's bosome, where he lay Conceal'd till now; then from the typick Law, Where we his manhood but by figures saw, And lastly from his mothers womb he came To us a perfect God, and perfect man. Now in a Manger lyes th' eternal Word, The Word he is, yet can no speech afford. He is the Bread of life, yet hungry lyes, The living Fountain, yet for drink he cryes; He cannot help, or cloath himself at need, Who did the Lillies cloath, and Ravens feed: He is the light of lights, yet now doth shroud His glory with our nature as a cloud: He came to us a little one, that we Like little children might in malice be; Little he is, and wrapt in clouts, left he Might strike us dead, if cloath'd with majestie. Christ had four beds, and those not soft, nor brave, The Virgins Womb, the Manger, Cross and Grave; The Angels sung this day; and so will I, That have more reason to be glad, than they: The covetous worldling ? Quid non mortalia pectora cogit Auri sacra fames? Why dost thou doat on gold, and deemest grace A thing not worth thy labour, or embrace? No prudent man would blear-ey'd Leah wooe, And with disdain let the fair, Rachel go: He is a foolish Merchant, that's more fond Of glassie Bugles, then a Diamond: So Esau sought for Venson, carnal food, And lost the blessing, which was far more good: Thy coffers may be full, but yet this will Though like a gulfe it sucks in, doth not fill: Wealth is to thee, like fuel to the fire, Which doth augment, and kindle more desire: God hath set bounds unto the Sea, to curb Her proudest waves, lest they the earth disturb. But what can limit, what can set a bound Unto thy wandring thoughts? a little ground Contains thy body; and when thou art dead, Thou art contented with a narrow bed: O pray for Grace, without which all thy store, Which should enrich thee, will but make thee poore, The Anabaptist. Ostende Anabaptistam, &amp; ego ostendam monstrum. What wouldst thou have a King, a Lord, a Knight, A Bishop, Priest are monsters in thy sight; No Church, nor Altar, and no Law must be To dictate but thy conscience unto thee. It thou art displeas'd with Lawes Divine, and Civil, I know not what will fit thee, but the Devil. Upon the mournful death of our late Soveraign Lord Charles the first, King of England, &amp;c. I read of a Confessor, and a King, A King, and Martyr is a stranger thing. Our Charles was both: A King both just, and wise, A holy Martyr, and sweet sacrifice: Thieves did consent to kill the just; but why? When that the Wolf is Judge, the Lamb must dye? He went to Canaan for three Kingdoms good, Through the red-Sea of his own sacred blood: Thus John the Baptist dy'd, that holy one, Whilst Herod did usurp King Davids throne, By his beheading it may well be sed. Three Kingdoms by injustice lost their head; If ere I shall the ayde of Saints implore, Thy Shrine alone (good Charles) I will adore; Lord, let my soul unto thy Kingdom come, To see King Charls crown'd for his Martyrdom. Gods Mercy. Nec habet principium, quo inchoatur, nec finem quo terminatur. The Sun's within his Tropicks; th' heavens high Within a span; the clouds included lye Within the fist; the earth that spacious creature, Within a circle is confin'd by Nature. But (O thou God of Love) to thy rich treasure Of endlesse mercy who can find a measure? Upon the return of our most illustrious King Charls the second from Flanders to England. Welcome bright Starre, the prodrome of the day, With whom the Sun of glory shall display His golden banners, and restore the Light Of truth eclipst by an erroneous night: He liv'd in exile long, and Flanders then Was th' Eagles neast, or the true Lions den: He past a Sea of troubles; and each wave Of grief he flatted with a soul more brave. To meet their King, the people ran so fast, As if each one disdain'd to be the last. Such plenteous tears of joy flow'd every where, That some in England did a deluge feare; They did such piles of wood in London burn, That many thought it would to Ilion turn; Those fires are ended, but the flames of love Unto our King shall everlasting prove: Long live King Charles, so long, ti'l wisemen see His years as many as his vertues be. Then he'le outlive old Nestor, whose glasse ran Before 'twas spent through the third age of man. Upon the Lords Prayer. Clavis Cœli. The sacred Prayer of the eternal Word Doth greater comfort to my soul afford, Than all the prayers made by humane Art, Those I have read, but this I have by heart, It is my constant prayer; and the best Like rich perfume to sweeten all the rest. Winter. Charitas frigescit. Speak not to me of Frizland, or the cold And gelid Clymats of the North: I hold There can no greater frost or Winter be, Than a hard heart that's cold in charitie. O shine thou Sun of glory, and impart Thy gracious heat to thaw my frozen heart, Upon the Right Honorable the Lord General George Monk, Duke of Albemarle Qui flumen pietatis, slumen liberalitatis, &amp; fulmen belli. Here is our glorious Atlas, who doth bear Our heaven up, and keep our hearts from fear. His merit is beyond reward, whose mind To high attempts by Nature is confin'd; Some Merchants have by their adventures bold, Enricht this Land with precious pearl, and gold, Yet none but Royal Monk could ever bring So rich a treasure, as our gracious King: Herculean labours were but twelve: here's one That hath an hundred labours undergone: He nere was rash, nor did the hasty hand, But a wise heart his active sword command; Judgment, and valour live in him, as fair Rebecca's sons did in one womb: despair Could nere attempt him; for his nobler mind Did soar above the reach of storms, and wind. This good Centurion doth not love to change His garment of Religion, nor to range Through Groves of fancies: he's a fixed star To beautifie the Church, and seat of war. He is descended from a Royal line, Not from the Bramble, but the stately Pine; The glory of the Wood: his vertues be The Symptoms of his true Nobilitie. He is in vertues rich, in merits high, So let him happy live, so let him die. REPENTANCE Unicum necessarium. Repentance is the key for rich and poor, To lock up Hell, and open Heavens door. When like the Dove, our wandring souls have left The Ark of God; and when we are bereft Of safety and relief; all help is vain, But by repentance to return again: One tear for sin yields to the soul relief, More than a fountain shed for worldly grief. The Vine drops tears, which well the face may cleer, But never beautifie the soul: Repentance here Must be the spring, which makes us seem so bright, As if we were transfigur'd into light. WORLDLY WEALTH Natura paucis contenta. Wealth unto every man, I see, Is like the Bark unto the Tree: Take from the Tree the Bark away, The naked Tree will soon decay. Lord, make not me too rich, nor make me poor, To wait at rich mens tables, or their door. Upon the Coronation of our Soveraign Lord CHARLS by the grace of God King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith. Aspice venturo lætentur ut omnia sæclo. Our Solomon is crown'd: A Crown will share Not more of honour to his head, than care. He wore, as the great King of Heaven would, A Crown of Thorns, before his Crown of Gold: Thus children, whom the Lord intends to bless, Go to their Canaan through the Wilderness. CHARLS, by the grace of God, (wise men foresee) Greater than Charls the Great, in time shall be. Almost to death unhappy England bled, And liv'd a Monster long without a Head: The Kingdom swallow'd up the Commonwealth, And England, which was sick, is now in health. Her Merchants shall bring gold, and pearl, and spice, To make this Garden rich as Paradise; And unto Cæsar, our most gracious King, Great Nations shall their humble Presents bring. Kings were neer Fountains crown'd, as Writers show, Because from them, as from pure Fountains, flow Our wealth, health, honour: If the Head be ill, By sympathy the Body suffer will: We may as well live without air, or fire, Or bread, and water, which we all require, As live without a King, because the King Is like the Sun, which maketh every thing To grow and flourish: He's the Stern to guide Our wandring ships through every wind and tide: The Kings's our Nursing Father, and the Queen Gur Nursing Mother; It is always seen, That if the careful Nurse be sick or ill, The Child cannot be well, that sucks her still. What doth befall, or what concerns the King, It streams to us like Rivers from the Spring: If that the King be glad, 'tis joy to all; And if he stands, the people cannot fall. God save the King, let all the people shout, And give unto his foes a total rout. Upon the Right Honorable JAMES Duke of Ormond, and Earl of Brecknot. Here is the lofty Pine, which always stood In spight of winds, the pride of all the Wood: He's great by birth, and great by wealth; but he Cannot be greater than his merits be: Though like a mountain his great Fortunes swell, His lowly Mind doth in a valley dwell: Ambition spurs him not; for he doth move In th' highest orb of Honour, and of Love. The Learned he prefers; his Judgment can Distinguish well betwixt a Goose and Swan: His word is like the Persian law, most free From various change, or mutability: He is religious, and doth wisely mark The door which leads unto the holy Ark. Four Rivers ran from Paradise: we find More vertues far spring from his noble mind: He ever soar'd with an ambitious wing, To serve his God, his Country, and his King: His actions are so full of life, that they Cannot neglected in oblivion die: He is both good, and great; and so may he Still great in goodness, good in greatness be. Sampson's Foxes. Sampson did tail by tail Wild Foxes bind, And fastned Fire-brands to them all behind: Thus ers Hetick are joyn'd, and go astray Linkt in some antick, or preposterous way; They carry fire-brands too, to set on fire The peaceful Kingdom: Let us all desire To quench this fire, and these wild beasts to tame, Else they will prove our ruine, and our shame. Upon a fair Gentlewoman, but ill qualified Thus have I seen, thus did I often know A filthy dunghil overlaid with snow. Here a fair Object stands before your eyes, Whose beauty a cold Hermite might surprise; She looks like Heaven, where good Angels dwell, Yet is within as dark, as black as Hell: Thus many trees appear both sound, and green, But at the heart they have been rotten seen: The sweet composure of her face doth say, She is an Angel, which assumes our clay; But scan her ways unlawful, and uncivil, And then you will proclaim her for a Devil: Fair weather in her lovely face we find, But clouds of sin in her deceitful mind. To make her fair within, good Lord impart Unto that comely face a gracious heart. Upon the Right Honorable HENRY Lord HERBERT, eldest Son and Heir to the Right Honorable EDWARD Marquess of Worcester. Est pater, &amp; patriæ gloria magna suæ. Ask Fame the truth, and you shall fully know What noble vertues from this fountain flow: Whose precious soul is with more sweetness blest, Than the Arabian Phenix spiced nest: His Christian heart, and tongue united be, And in the sphere of pious truth agree: No swelling waves of pride, no puffing wind Disturb the calmness of his peaceful mind: His honest actions from foul rubs are free, Like Tempe that fair field of Thessaly. The Magnet could not shew more constancie Unto the Northern Pole, or Star, than he Did to our King; He never could abide Like to a broken bow to start aside: His active power, his ever loving heart, Like old Barzillai, took King Davids part. Have you observ'd a curious fabrick, high, Compos'd of free-stone, pleasant to the eye, And beautified within with works most pure Of gold and silver, and rich furniture? Thus grace, and nature fram'd him, so that I Am much too dull to write his Elogy: (Lord) from his eyes unhappy feares expell, His feete from falling keep, his soul from hell. The Bible Arbor Uitæ: Much books I have perus'd, but I protest Of books the sacred Bible is the best, Some books may much of humane Learning boast But here's the Language of the Holy Ghost, Hence we draw living water; here we do Observe the Patriarchs lives, and doctrine too: Here Christ himself directs us how to pray, And to the Gate of Heaven chalks the way. Here is the salve, which gives the blind their fight, All darknesse to expel, here is the light: Here is strong meat for men; and milk to feed The weaker babes, which more perfection need; Cast off erroneous pamphlets, wanton rhymes, All feigned books of love; which cheat the times; And read this book of life; those shall appear With Christ in heaven which are written here, The Wedding garment. Faith is the wedding garment, lind within, With love, without foul spots, or staines of sin Humility is the most decent lace, And patient hope, which doth this garment grace. Without this royal robe no guest is fit To sup, or at the Lords own table sit. The true Souldier. Est major, qui se, quam qui fortissima vincit Mænia ? He is a valiant man, and souldier brave Who can his passions in subjection have. Those which do conquer towns, shall never win The crown of life, unlesse they conquer sin. Strange Monsters. Of diverse monsters I have sometimes read Some without feet, and some without a head. No souler monsters can hot Africk bring, Than rebels are without their head the King. Solitarinesse. I am become like a Pelicane in the wilderness, and like an Owl, that is in the desart, I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow, that sitteth alone upon the house top: Psalm. 102. 6, 7. The multitude, like some tempestuous wind. Disturbs the contemplation of the mind: High meditations do my soul possesse, Like John the Bapist's, in a wildernesse. When secret fields I tread, I do refuse The books of men, and Nature's books peruse. The glorious Sun, the Moon, the Stars so bright Are demonstrations of th' Eternal light. The Rainbow doth in the dark clouds declare, How great Gods Judgments, and his mercies are. Each herb, or flower, each living plant, or tree Present Gods goodnesse, and his Majestie: I see the Lilleys grow, and then admire Gods wisdom in their pure, and rich attire; God seeds the Ravens, which not reap, nor sow, By these Gods gracious providence I know; When lo the lofty hills I lift mine eyes, I speak of heaven in soliloquies. The stream, whose constant motion never stays. Argues the swift Procession of my days: I travel to my grave, till life is done, As rivers do unto the Ocean run. When I behold the Lark't advance her wing, And to our God a thankful Anthem sing. I check my nature, and can do no lesse Than tax my self of dull unthankfulnesse. Such holy raptures with my soul agree, When in the world I from the world am free. The further I from wordly men remove, I draw the neerer to the God of Love: The Virgin Mary. From henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. Most blessed is (thou sonne of man) the breast, Which thou didst suck, &amp; the chast womb is blest Which bare thee, when thou didst our nature wed, No sinful lust defil'd thy marriage bed None was so gracious, as the Virgin Mary, Gods holy Temple, and his Sanctuary. As fathers hold, her blessing did consist More in beleeving, than in bearing Christ. Old age Delirium naturæ. VVhen we are young, and do enjoy the spring Of pleasant youth, we laugh we dance, we sing And think, old age, which is so cold, so soure, Will never come to blast our youthful flower. As some dark cloud invades the sky so fair, And by degrees obscures the clearest air. Old age thus creepeth on; and turnes our light, Or Summer's day into a winter night. Our Limmes are turn'd to ice, our hair to snow; Our windows dark and dull, our feet are slow, Our Roses languish, and our Lilleys fade, Our wine is sour'd, our pleasures bitter made. Joves tree the sturdy oake, the Cedar tall In length of time are forc't to stoop, and fall. Remember God, whilst thou art young, and he When thou art old, will sure remember thee: Upon the golden Grove in the County of Carmarthin, the habitation of the Right Honorable the Lord Vauhan, Earle of Carbery, now Lord President of the Marches of Wales. If I might, where I pleas'd, compose my nest, The golden Grove should be my constant rest. This curious fabrick might make us believe That Angels there, or men like Angels live, I must commend the out side; but within Not to admire, it were almost a sin. Of fertile ground the large circumference. With admiration may confound the sense; Which ground, if things were rightly understood, From Paradise came tumbling in the Flood, And there the water left it, therefore we Find here of pleasures such varietie. Wise Nature here did strive, and witty Art To please the curious eye, and longing heart. The neighbouring river Towyd oth oreflow, Like pleasant Nilus the rich Meades below. Hence come great store, and various kind of fish So good, as may enrich the empty dish. Fowles thither flock, as if they thought it fit, They should present themselves unto the spit. Here gardens are compos'd, so sweet, so fair With fragrant flowers as do perfume the air. Hard by a grovedoth stand, which doth defeat Cold winter storms, and the dry Summers heat. Their merry birds their pleasant Carols sing, Like sweet Musicians to the wanton spring. There are parks, orchards, warrens, fish-ponds, spring. Each foot of ground some curious object brings: There lives a noble Earl, free, just and wise, In whom the Elixer of perfection lyes. His heart is good as balsome, pure as gold, Wise, as a Serpent, as a Lion bold: The righteous is confident as a Lion Pro. 28. The guilty conscience feares, when there's no fear, And thinks, that every bush containes a beare; When none persues, the wicked flyes, and still Distractions alter his confused will: The righteous man sits in his peaceful chair Secure from fears, and free from black dispair. His resolution like a Uirgin pure He keeps unspotted, and can well endure The burden of affliction: for the crosse Makes trial, whether he be gold or drosse. The righteous shelter'd under heavens wing Like the three children in the fire may sing. For God will broach the rocks, and Manna rain He'le bring the quailes together to sustain His chosen people: Lions hunger may, And want; but he shat treads a vertuous way, Shall never feare a famine: God is able In the wild desarts to prepare a table. The Devil will destroy, the flesh infect, The world deceive, unlesse that God protect. Upon the Right Honourable Lady, the Lady, Mary Beauchamp of Edington, in the County of Wilts Romana vivit clarior Iliâ. A dwarfe may on a giant look; and I May speak of her, whose merits are so high. Count all the various flowers of May; declare, Of stars what number by creation are. This may be sooner done, than you can tell What sacred vertues in this Temple dwell. Would you find bounty? or do you desire To see Religion in his best attire. Would you know meeknesse, charity and love, Which are the touchstones, that our faith doth prove These vertues are included in her breast, Like precious Jewels in a golden chest. Her kinred, neighbors, tenants, and the poor, Yea, strangers do frequent, and blesse her door. Twixt her and Saints I do no difference know, But this, they are above, and she below. And if all had so pure a mind as she, Heaven on earth, and earth would heaven be. Upon the honourable Gentlewoman Mrs. Jane Lane, who was by Gods providence a most happy Instrument to convey our Soveraign Lord King Charles out of the hands of Rebels from England to Holland. Have you observ'd the sun sometimes to shroud His glorious head, and lustre in a cloud? Thus God was pleas'd to hide our gracious King Under a woman's most auspicious wing. 'Tis strange a woman could so silent be In things of moment, and great secresy. She was the weaker vessel; God thought fit To make her weak in strength, but strong in wit. To save her Countrey Holofernes head Brave Judith cut off on his wanton bed; But many traytorous hands did vex this Nation, Which Jane cut off by Charls his preservation. Let noble Ladies sing, and Virgins dance Before this Judith our deliverance. Praise God for this High-work, and be content To honor her, as Gods great instrument. No fading garland of sweet flowers, or bayes. Shall crown her head, but everlasting praise. GRACE. ???????? Sinne like a gyant doth encounter me, Nor am I from his proud controulment free: To kill this great Goliah, (gracious King) Give me thy grace instead of Davids sling. Jordan may help, and Siloam's poole may cure Carnal diseases: but thy fountaine pure Of saving grace, when I do faint, or pine, Doth heal my soul without fine oyl, or wine, Grace is the shield of my defence; the light, Which guides my feet through this dark vale of night. When friends, and riches leave me, that alone Conducts me from the grave to heavens throne. I fear no Devils through Gods grace, nor men, No firie oven, nor the Lion's den. Vpon the Honourable Lady, the Lady Elinor Williams of Gwernivet, Daughter to the most hospitable, and worthy Gentleman Eustance Whitney of Whitney Court Esq; Tell me no more, what noble Ladies have Secur'd their names by vertues from the grave. For if you knew the Lady, you would swear No other star mov'd in so high a sphear. Her vertues do like purest fountains flow, Which no defect, or diminution know; The number of her years a man may guesse, But not her vertues; they are numberless: If there be one, she is the Phenix true, Who doth her vertues, not her years renue: When Hereticks did think the Church to smother, She was to Church-men a kind nursing-mother. Her lamp did burne, nor could the wicked rout With all their blasts put her bright candle out. Her husband was Sr Henry, that wise Knight, Who was our Brittish glory, and our light; From these two stocks grew branches great and fair, Which keep the poor from the tempestuous air: This noble Lady is the onely crown, Which honour gave, and made our Country known To other Ladies she may well dispense With beames of vertue from her influence. The goodnesse of her language doth betray Some Angel dwelt within that house of clay; Our countrey by her absence, we confesse, Is worse in comfort, and in honour lesse: Contentment. Ex animo rem stare æquum puto, non animum ex re. Sad discontent like some unwholsom blast The fairest blossomes, and best fruit thou hast, Will soon destroy: Like leaven it will soure The lump of all thy joyes: No golden snoure Can help the wounded conscience, and no Art, But onely grace can cure the cankred heart: O sweet contentment, from which spring do flow Pure streames of joy: when I am poor, and low, Thou make'st me rich; when sick without relief, Thou art the balsome to expel my grief. I do not long for Quailes, or dainty fish, To court my palat with a curious dish. I am no slave to gold; an empty chest Disquiets not my conscience, nor my rest: I am not puft in mind: ambitious eyes Look often higher than their merits rise. My clothes shall decent be, not gay: I doubt, That velvet slippers, cannot cure the gout, Nor can a golden crown the head-ach cure, Nor purple Robes from Feavers us secure. I love my freedom: yet strong prison can Vex but the bad and not the vertuous man? Imprisonment, sicknesse, persecution, losse, Are but the chips of Christ his sacred crosse: I am content; nor do I greatly care, Whether the heavens fair, or cloudy are. I am the true Vine John. 15. 1. Christ is the fruitful Vine, whereon doth grow Clusters of mercies, which no number know. Hence we receive such active cups of wine As mortals make immortal, and divine. The Vine is cut, and prun'd; so Christ was torne His hands, and feet with nailes, his head with thorn. In malice they were ripe, and did not fear To pierce his side with a presumptious spear, Hence flow'd the Sacraments, as from a spring Of lively waters, saving health to bring. Upon the fair, charitable, and piously devo ed Gentlewoman Mrs. Mary Jeffreys the wife of John Jeffreys Esq. Would you the model of perfection find? Or take a coppy of a pious mind? Behold this Lady, where such vertues dwell, That Phenix-like she hath no parallel. She hath a dove-like nature, pride, and she Can never meet, there's such Antipathy. She's rich in beauty, rich in purse, and free, Her riches most consist in piety: When other Ladies sport, and laugh, and prate, She with her prayers knocks ot heaven's gate: Upon the Right Honourable John Lord Scudamore Uiscoun: Slego, qui profunditates penus pictatis ærarium, nec non nobilitatis, Splender maximus. He loveth our Nation, and hath built us a Synagogue, Luk. 7.5. Can I be safe, or from presumption free, That will attempt to climb so high a tree? Whose top doth reach to heaven; and hath made Sad Christians joyful with his pleasant shade. He is no barren fig-tree which deceives, And gives instead of fruits, but fading leaves. Who knows his pious mind, or spirit; knows A sea of vertues, which nere ebbes, but flows. Justice, Religion, wisdom in his breast As in their center fixt, do safely rest. His noble actions run like purer ore In a rich vein, and still increase their store. An ancient Temple ruin'd lay in dust, And was consumed by times all eating rust Those heaps of stones he did erect, and raise Pillars of honor to uphold Gods praise. If this weak child, my little book should peace, The stones to speak his worth would never cease. David was blest, because he thought to build, Here's one not only thought, but hath fulfil'd. He did not only this fair building frame, But with revenues he enricht the same. He thought it not a blessing, but a curse, To rob the Church, and so to fill his purse. The Eagle burnt her nest with that same cole, Which she had newly from the altar stole. A stollen sheafe, or sacrilegious meat Into our wealth will like a canker eat. He ne're defil'd his heart, nor staind his hands With plundred goods, or with ill-gotten lands. Who writes his charity, and love, must bring A quil from heaven's winged Cherubine. No wonder then, that this fair Cedar stands, When others are cut down by cruel hands: Afflictions daunt him not, but make him bold, He fears no fire, whose mettal is of gold. God goes before him like a cloud by day, And fire by night to guid, and guard his way. Although Hom-Lacy may afford him leasure, Yet Abbey Dowr will bring the richest treasure. O that my muse could spice his precious fame, And adde perfume unto his sweeter name. The Soul. What will it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Mat. 16. 26. Bright are the pearls of dew: the gold is pure, Try'd in the fire, and from all drosse secure. White is the untoucht snow: the light is fair Which guilds the day, and clears the cloudy air. These to the soul compar'd, are dark, and vaine, Which doth more beauty, sweetnesse, worth containe. I do respect my garden, and take heed No poisonous herb may grow, no stinking weed. I love my actions just, my words compleat, My body clean, my garment fair and neat; But yet my chiefest care, and study here, Is to preserve my soul, and conscience cleere. I am ambitious of an honest fame, And to preserve the candour of my name. My wife and children, and my friend I love, These are strong tyes, which may affection move. These are delights, but my delight is most, To watch my soul, lest that rich pearle be lost. Lord, let me feed on bread of cares, and fears, And let me wash my bed with constant tears. Let me be subject to all storms, and wind, And for my bed let me a dungeon find. Do, what thou wilt, (sweet Lord) I'le take it well, Onely preserve my self from death, and hell. What if I heard the musick of the sphears, And sweetest Anthems to content the ears? What if I had strong wines, delicious meat, And all the pleasures I could tast or eat? All this is gall, unless the soul is free, Which is more dear than twenty worlds to me. The Marigold. Heliotropium, sive Solisequium est anima mea, quæ sequitur solem Justitiæ, non naturæ. The loving Marigold his leaves displays, Glad to receive the Sun's all warming rays. But when the absent Sun denies relief, The flower contracted seems to dy for grief: While the bright Sun of glory shines on me, My soul is in a joyful extasy. But when he hides his gracious face of love, I cannot truely be, nor live, nor move: MUSICK. Non clamans, sed amans psallit in aure Dei. Amphion's musick was so rare, That with him no man might compare, And Orpheus with his silver string Did stones, and trees together bring. But when I sigh, or weep, or pray, I sweeter musick make than they. All things were fram'd by God above, And all things do in union move They say no musick to the ears, Is like the musick of the sphears. But yet to me it doth appear No musick's like the conscience cleer. SINNE. ?? ?????? ??? ???????? ???????. What cloud is this, that makes it night, And robs me of eternal light? Lord, in this darknesse I can see No path, which leads my soul to thee. O Sun of glory make it day. And chase these clouds of sinne away: PRAYER. Vt corpus est mortuum sine anima, sic anima sine oratione. The morning is the infancy of day, Which claims chast thoughts, &amp; cals the heart to pray When night puts on her black and dark attire, Let prayer kindle thee with holy fire. A faithful prayer pleaseth God: and turns His wrath to mercy, when his anger burns. It is a welcome sacrifice to God, For man a salve, and for the devil a rod; Without the wings of prayer none can fly To heavens throne, where pleasures never dy. Prayer's the Key which opens heaven's door: From whence all blessings fall on rich and poor. It is the key, which locks the gates of hell, Whence evils come, where all discomforts dwell: In prayer bend thy knees, and heart, for he Doth make his heart more stiff that spares his knee: Who God forgets, and doth neglect to pay, Is still in travel, never in the way: A FRIEND. Rara avis in terris. Where shall I find a friend? I may as soon Find out the man which dwelleth in the moon. The ancient days are past: when men did move Within the sphear of undeceiving love: Friendship is in these days respectless growne, Like some old matron in a thredbare gown: There is a fained friendship, which doth passe Sometimes for pearle, and is but painted glasse. Some undermine, who seem like friends to stand, These have the voice of Jacob; Esau's hand; Others will smooth you with a fair discourse, And give you talk enough, but keep the purse A perfect friend is not in love so cold, That he will lose his friend to save his gold. Thou art my friend (sweet Lord) who dost refresh My weary soul; I trust no arm of flesh. The Saints of God. Sanctitas nobis non per meritum sed per gratiam imputatur. The neerer we approach to God; the more Wee find our imperfections, and deplore Our frail estate: our weaknesse best we see. In the fair glasse of Gods great Majesty: The stars are glorious bodies, and by night Do guild the world with their resplendent light. But they are dull, and never do appear, When once the sun shines in our Hemisphere. The Sons of God, the children of the day, Excell the rest in beauty: but when they Behold Gods glory with a serious mind, They nothing in themselves, but darknesse find. The righteous do condemn themselves, and spy Beams in their own, not in their brothers eye. None keeps the paper of his life so white, But he will sometimes blot, as well as write. If th' heavens are not cleane, nor Angels pure In Gods account; who is from sin secure Therefore Gods Saints are from presumption free, Their faith is cloth'd with works of charity. Grant me (sweet Lord) a righteous life, then I, The precious death of thy dear Saints shall dy. Peter's denial. Angelus cecidit, licet in cælo; Adam cecidit licet in Paradiso; &amp; Petrus cecidit licet in Scholâ Christi. Art thou the Rock, where Christ his Church would build, Yet when thy master fights, thou leav'st the field? No wonder if weak buildings be cast downe With boistrous winds, when rocks are overthrown; Where was thy courage, when the Lamb did stand Before the Wolf, left to his furious hand? Wouldst hou forsake thy Saviour, swear and ban, In all thy life thou never knewst the man? Lord, leave me not vnto my self, lest I Fall from the faith, and thy great name deny. I hear a warning-peece, the Cock doth crow, And Peter feels his sad condition now: He doth repent his curses, oaths, and fears, In the sad language of his flowing tears. Let not my fountains cease, nor tears be few; Tears are the Angels joy, and Heavens dew. Gods Providence Deus est in Angelis per gloriam, in Electis per gratiam, in omnibus per providentiam. The Lilies do not spend the weary day In spinning thred to make their clothes more gay: Yet Solomon had no such rich attire, Whom all the world for glory did admire. The Ravens have no barn to store their grain, They do not sow, nor reap with careful pain; Yet God feeds them. If he the birds do feed, And clothe the grass, he will sustain my need With greater love: I never will despair; When all is spent, God will my stock repair. Upon the Honorable Colonel S? Herbert Prise Baronet, Master of the Houshold to His Majesty Charles the Second. Est major, quàm cui possit fortuna nocere. Some wavering men, like reeds with every wind, Are shaken to and fro: The various mind Dislikes no weather; be it foul, or fair, He hath a cloak fit for the present air: Such like the Cynick will their tubs remove From place to place, and still the sunshine love. On these unconstant worldlings I do look, As on the image in the Prophets book; The head of gold, of silver th' arms and breast, The thighs and belly were of brass; the rest As legs and feet, of iron were, and clay; The image fell, and moulder'd all away: So wavering men, who use no constant Creed From good to bad, from bad to worse proceed. But here is one, who like a Martyr ran, And held throughout the course he first began: No strong temptations, threatning, swords or gold, Could flat his resolution; he ne'r sold His love for gain; his heart was firm and stable Unto his King, as th' Anchor to the Cable: So stands the stately Pine, which rooted fast And deep in earth, disdains the weaker blast. To make one perfect, Nature never could Have form'd a man in a more decent mould: But wiser men neglect the outward shell, And praise his braver soul, where vertues dwell: His sole ambition, rightly understood, Is only to be known not great, but good: His actions are so just, that you'd protest Astræa dwelt within his sacred breast. With unclipt wings let may Ambition fly, As his desires are good, his merits high! GRACE. Qui quærit, invenit. Men dig the bowels of the earth for gold, And rocks for precious stones; and some are bold To dive into the sea for pearl: Few care To get the pearl of Grace, more rich, more rare. The Manna, and the Quails were dainty meat, And as delicious as a man could eat; But taste the food of Grace, and thou shalt find It yields a better relish to thy mind: Grace makes the poor man rich, the bline to see, The sad man full of joy, the bondman free; Weak humane thoughts it turns to thoughts divine, As Christ at Cana water turn'd to wine; It sweetens all conditions, rich and poor, Like some pure incense, and preserves thy store. A good Report. Honestus rumor optimum est patrimonium: Qui malè facit, malè audit. Do not neglect the candor of thy Name, Thou shouldst not stain thy clothes, much less thy fame: Fine houses men will build, repair and trim, And keep them neat without, and fair within; But little they regard, if by foul ways They blot their names, and slubber o're their days: Such men in life are odious, and shall be In death a scandal to posterity. I'll tread a righteous path; a good Report Makes men live long, although their life is short. Sampson's Riddle; Out of the strong came sweet. Christ was the Lamb, Christ was the Lion slain, To save our souls from everlasting pain: From Judah's Lion all sweet pleasures flow; No mercies but from him we have, or know. He was a Lion mighty, strong in pow'r, Before he could Death, Sathan, Hell devour. A Dark Lanthorn. This Lanthorn is but dull, and dark in sight, As if it had not the least spark of light The light is clos'd within, which none can spy Or well discern, unless the curious eye: So good men care not that the world should know How good they are, by any outward shew. Thus Cabinets appear but mean, and plain, Yet many times rich pearl and gold contain: Thus the best Wine that ever you can wish, Is often tasted in an earthen dish. Some look like holy Temples, when they are Like graves within defil'd with rotten ware: Of my weak deeds I will no trumpet sound; The heart is humble, where good gifts abound. Man's Infirmity. Wise Adam fell in Paradise; the good Angels in Heaven fell, who always stood In Gods own presence; Faithful Peter fell, Though in Christs school he was brought up so well; David committed murther; righteous Lot Defil'd his name with an incestuous blot: No Oak so strong, no Cedar is so tall, But shaken with tempestuous wind may fall; No man so perfect is, so pure a Saint, But in the battel he may fail and faint, (If God prevents not:) Man, that's born to sorrow, May safely stand to day, and fall to morrow. The Common people. Neutrum modò, mas modo vulgus. The many-headed Hydra, or the People, Now build the Church, then pull down Bells and Steeple: To day for learned Bishops, and a King, They shout with one consent; to morrow sing A different note: One while the people cry To Christ Hosanna; then him crucifie: And thus the wavering multitude will be Constant in nothing but inconstancie: When these together swarm, the Kingdom fears; They are as fierce as Tygers, rude as Bears. The Rock in Horeb. Once onely Moses with his sacred rod The Rock in Horeb struck, as he by God Commanded was; then waters gusht and fell From the hard Rock, as from a running Well. Lord, thou didst often strike me, never kill; Thy rod was gentle, I am stubborn still: Soften my stony heart, that tears may flow: None reap in joy, but those in tears that sow. The holy Sepulchre. Christ is our Rock, who in a rock is lain, The lesser rock the greater doth contain: Out of a rock they newly hew'd his grave, The new man Christ thus a new tomb must have: No creature might repose or lay his head, Without presumption, in the Creators bed: The Lily of the valley, Sharon's Rose, His fragrant grave in a sweet garden chose. This Rock did shelter Christ two days; but he An everlasting Refuge is to me: He is the Rock, that doth our souls relieve With water, which doth life eternal give. The Passing-Bell. The Passing-Bell doth toll; my thred is spun, My candle is burnt out, my hour-glass run: This sound is doleful, and this musick's sad To those which in the world are rich, and bad; It is like Davids musick, sweet to me, Which doth my soul from evil spirits free: I end my life, and yet to live begin; I shall in glory live, who liv'd in sin. The Spiritual Watchman. Nulla venit sine te nox mihi, nulla dies. When private in my bed I take my rest. I muse on all the gifts, wherewith God blest, And made me glad. The thankful man alone Climbs Jacobs ladder, and ascends Gods throne. I think on heaven's joys, and do admire Of Saints, and Angels the harmonious quire: Sometimes I think of hell; where rich men ly In deadly torments, and yet cannot dy. My life I call to mind; which God hath made Short like a span, vaine as a dream, or shade. This night may be my last, and I may have My sheet to be my shroud, my bed my grave. I count past sins, which so defile my soul, That on the dunghil Job was not so foul, These holy thoughts possesse my serious head, Til tears run downe, and wash my careful bed. LOVE. Amor est complementum legis. Our God is love, who doth remain in love In the same sphear with God himself doth move. All things by perfect nature do agree, And seem to hold a mutual sympathy: The heavens to love their inclination show, Which fairly do embrace this orb below. The fire, the water, earth, and air agree, And by kind nature intermixed be. Love doth fulfil the law; love conquers sin, And makes a man an earthly Cherubin Faith, patience, hope, all vertues rightly skand, Without pure love like barren fig-trees stand. With perfect love are sweetest graces seen, Like maids of honor waiting on the Queen. Love is the wedding-garment; and no guest Without this robe shall tast the royal feast. Invest me Lord, with love, make thou me able, And fit to feast with Angels at thy Table Upon the Right Worshipful: Sir Henry Lingen Knight of Stoke in Herefordshire. Nulli pietate secundus. My trumpet is too dul, and weak to sound His meritorious praise: as in rich ground, Most pleasant springs, sweet flowers, and herbs we find, So vertues are consistent in his mind. He's constant in the faith, and he doth hate Old truth with errors to sophisticate. Such valour he exprest that men should raise A stately Pyramide t'advance his praise. His hands were active, and his heart was free In loyal actions from Apostasy He strives not to climb high; a gentle tyde Thus have I seen within his channel slide, His actions are so cleer to each mans sight, As the pure Topaz, or the Chrysolite. All hearts to him, as to their Loadstone move, For he's the Center of his Countrey's love. By all his vertuous ways it doth appear, His soul in heaven is, his body here. The Sluggard. Otia corrumpunt animum. When God did Adam with all pleasures blesse, He was to labour, and the garden dresse. God made man active, those fair orbs above Do wheele about, and without ceasing move. The running stream is sweet, and can impart A wholsome draught unto a thirsty heart. But standing pools more dark and foul appear, Nor can they be from bad infections cleer; So labour whet, the soul, and cleers the mind, By active fire our mettal is refin'd. An idle life a sad condition breeds, Who sits, when he should travel, never speeds. Look how the painful Bee unto her hive Brings the pure hony, and doth daily thrive. And the laborious Ant with careful pain Doth treasure up in summer time her grain. So she prevents the famine, and doth live All winter in delight, and never grieve. The Sluggard foulds his armes, and then doth say, I fear, there is a Lion in the way: Thus in the end both poverty and shame Consumes his body, and obscures his name. God is a husbandman, he doth require All men to work, no peny else, no hire. To his much Honoured friend Mr. John Williams the most pious, and learned Minister, and Uicar of Devynnock, and Luel. In printed leaves for you I need not look, I have learnt you by heart without the book. Had I forgotten you, I had bin rude And guilty of most base ingratitude: If I had power equal to my mind, You should an honest friend, and servant find. But envious fortune hath so clipt my wing, That I can nothing but affection bring, I may more large in lands by fortune prove, But no condition can enlarge my love. The heavens blest you with a plenteous hand, That you your friends can help, your foes command. The Blackamores. We many men from Mauritania see To England come, as black, as Ravens be; Into your selves look with a curious eye, And you shall find you are more black then they Then wonder not at them so black in skin But at your selves so foul, so black by sin. Peace and Warre. Peace is like salt which seasons all our meat, Till envious warre doth poison all we eat. War like the horsleech calls for humane blood; And ruines all things like the unruly flood; Or raging fire: I do prefer by far An unjust peace before the justest war: Welcome sweet peace, which makes all things compleat And gives us grapes from our own vines to eat. That land is blest, and hath a golden day Where Drums, and trumpets cease, and Organs play. Peace breedeth plenty, warre consumes a nation, Peace bringeth joy, warre causeth Lamentation. Pray to the God of peace, that we may have The love, and peace of God unto the grave. HOPE. Qui nihil sperat, desperet nihil. I'm black, tis true: but yet no sad despair Shall me perswade, that I shall nere be fair. Transform hard stones the God of power can, And make them children unto Abraham. To turn my heart of stone, God knows the way, Into a heart of flesh without delay: My sore disease is not so great, or foul, That there's no balsome; which can heal my soul; Come true Samaritan, come sacred Dove, And in my soul, as in thy Temple move. To the most incomparable, wise, and vertuous Lady, the Lady Goditha Prise, Lady to the Honourable Colonel, Sir Herbert Prise Knight. As I do live, I wonder how you can Forget your sex, and be so much a man! In wit, and judgment; nay, you are divine Transcending far our nature masculine. As you are fair, so you disdain the rude, And sluttish nature of the multitude. They say, Promitheus stole from heaven fire, And brought it down weak mortals to inspire, If it be now on earth, I do protest That heavenly fire lies in your sacred breast. Who writes of you, or gives you greatest praise, To your high worth shall but a molehill raise. Vpon the same most excellent Lady, the Lady Goditha Prise. Have you observ'd a garden fair, and sweet Where whelsome herbs, and pleasant flowers do mee So doth her mind no imperfection know, Where graces do like grapes in clusters grow: If you with serious eyes desire to see The model of most perfect charity. Or if in earnest you desire to find Religion eated in a humble mind. Or would you know, where holy patience dwells, When grace, and truth all discontent expels; Then her behold who lives, as if with John She had Christ's sacred bosome lean'd upon. In tears, and prayers she doth sin bemone And each day neerer steps to heavens throne. The mortified Christian. I from the worlds deceitful snares am free, They were but cobwebs, which entangled me, All worldly mirth is madnesse; get away You bad companions, which mispend the day. Leave me alone, I ne're am lesse alone, Than when in private by my self I mone. I love no dainties, which procure delight, Nor curious sauce to whet the appetite. Nature is soon contented: give me meat, That I may live, let me not live to eat. I wear no silk, fine linnen, rich attire To make me proud, or burn with wanton fire; Rough sackcloth, or some homely weed I love, Which my poor heart to humble thoughts may move. I pray in Temples, meadows, woods; each place Invites my soul to call for saving grace: All sins by constant prayer conquer'd be, So conquer them, else they will conquer thee. The New illiterate Lay-Teachers. ????, ???? ???? ???????. Why trouble you religions sacred stream, And tear Christs coat, which had no rent, or seam? And you do patch it too with ragged clouts Of false opinions, and phantastick doubts. The skilful husbandman must till, and sow, That grounds ill drest, where blind men hold the plough Now in the Temple every saucy Jack Opens his shop, and shews his pedlars pack. Instead of candles we enjoy the snuff, For precious balme we have but kitchin stuffe. The ruder sort are by these teachers led, Who acrons eat, and might have better bread; If this a propagation shall be found, These build the house, which pull it to the ground; This is meere Hocus-Pocus; a strange slight, By putting candles out, to gain more light. Mad men by vertue of this propagation, Have Bedlum left, and preach't for Reformation. And they might well turn preachers, for we had Many that were more foolish, and more mad. The Tinkar being one of excellent mettle, Begins to sound his doctrine with his Kettle. And the laborious ploughman I bewail, Who now doth thresh the Pulpit with his slail. The louzy Taylor with his holy thimble Doth patch a sermon up most quick and nimble. He doth his skill, and wisdom much expresse, When with his goose he doth the Scripture presse. The Chandler now a man of light we find, His candle leaves a stinking snuffe behind. The Apothecary, who can give a glister Unto a holy brother or a sister; Hath one dram of the spirit, and can pray, Or preach, and make no scruple of his way. Thus false coyn doth for currant money passe, And precious stones are valued lesse than glasse. Not disputation, but a rigid law Must keep these frantick sectarists in aw. The itch of disputation will break out Into a scab of errour; which without Some speedy help will soon infect and run Through all the flock, where it hath once begun, I will take heed in these bad times, and care To shut my shop, but keep my constant ware. Lord let thy tender vine no longer bleed, Call home thy shepheards which thy lambs may feed: A Prayer to the Holy Ghost. O Holy Spirit, O most sacred Dove, Which didst descend upon the Son of Love; Descend upon my soul, that I may be Simple, as Doves without malignity! O holy Fire, inflame my lukewarm heart, And better heat of love divine impart! O holy Fire, O thou Eternal Light, Expel the clouds of everlasting night! O holy Fire, let my soul purged be From all her dross, as purest gold is free! O holy Fire, dissolve my heart, like wax, Which nothing but thy fair impression lacks! O holy Fire, vouchsafe in me to dwell, And keep my soul from the strange fire of hell! Antipathy. I love him not; but shew no reason can Wherefore, but this, I do not love the man. Astrology. To the profound and learned Gentleman, Mr. Vincent Wing; Qui Naturæ Aruspex intimus, Atlas physicus, nec non sensus &amp; rationis stupendus Arbiter. Wise men believe, inferior bodies move By dispensation from those Orbs above: Stars do not force, or by compulsion cause Our Natures to obey their constant laws. Who serves the God of pow'r, that made the spheres, No sad ecclipse or constellation fears; Where vertuous Reason guides not, but the Sense, There Planets have their greatest influence: God did the Sun, the Moon, and Stars bestow, Which do the course of time and seasons shew: 'Gainst Sisera in their orders sought the stars, And helpt Gods people in their prosperous wars. When Christ himself was born, a star did bring And guide the wise men to find out their King: And wise men still in stars a vertue find, Which is kept secret from the duller mind: Into brave spirits a pure light descends, Which heavy darkness never comprehends. I cannot call the stars by name, nor track The Sun through twelve signs of the Zodiack: Arcturus with his sons outgo my sense, So do the Pleyades with their influence: From the Pole-Artick what degrees there be Unto th' Antartique is unknown to me: Our Zenyth is too high for me to know What things are there, our Nadyr is too low: I do not understand how Planets move, And differ in their several Orbs above. The Circle from the Stars reflexion may Escape my knowledge call'd the milky way: Such knowledge is too deep; but yet I will Admire the path of that mysterious skill. Solomon's Memento Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, Eccles. 12. 1. Do not mispend thy golden youth, and bring The dross of thy old age to serve thy King. Do not neglect the morning of thy days, And think the evening fit thy God to praise: God early must be sought; the longer we Persist in sin, the stronger sin will be: From vice to vertue turn, from bad to good; The deeper still he sinks, who stands in mud. A nail, the further it is driven in, The harder is drawn out; and so is sin: None can foretell how long the fatal glass Shall run, or else how soon the sand will pass. Delay no time; that man will shrink and sear, Who lays the burden on old age to bear: Because the foolish Virgins came too late, They heaven lost, for Christ had shut the gate. Should we be old, are we then sure to store Our souls with grace, which we refus'd before? Through mire and dirt, who travels all the day, Will hardly go by night a cleaner way: The Tenant which neglects th' appointed day, Forfeit his lease, and fret his Landlord may. Upon the Right Worshipful, Sir Francis Floyd Knight, Sou to the most eloquent, pious, learned, and honorable Judge, Sir Marmaduke Floyd Knight. Vertue can never be conceal'd; her flame Shines bright, and will disclose a vertuous name: A brave report of his great worth we hear As loud as thunder in our Hemisphere: Contagious times could never make a spot On his fair clothes, or his white paper blot; He could not flatter, or affect the crime To temporize, or smooth the ruder time; Fixt in his station like a lofty hill He simply stood, and scorn'd to change his will: I wish he may enjoy fair Halcion days, And Heaven bless his meritorious ways. Even so come, Lord Jesus. Rev. 22. 20. The pretty Bird imprison'd in his cage, Would fain go free, and spend his merry age In spacious woods: So is my better mind As to a prison, to my flesh confin'd: Make haste, sweet Jesus, to strike off my shackle, And to dissolve this earthly tabernacle. Thou art on earth, the earth's most perfect pleasure; Thou art in heaven, heavens richest treasure: Let others dote on beauty, honour, wealth, Thou art my great reward, my joy, my health: My soul is ravisht with thy love, and sickly; Then come my sweetest Jesus, oh come quickly Upon Natures Darling, the young ingenuous Gentleman, Mr. James Jones Son to Edmund Jones Esq; He is in years a child; but if you scan The ripeness of his wit, he is a man This graff from such a gallant stock will be In time succeeding, a most fruitful tree; This Plant will prove a goodly Oak, and give A pleasant shade the weary to relieve. His Spring foretels the Autumn; and such rayes Dart from the morning of his youthful days, As do foreshew this Morning star will prove A glorious body in the orb of Love. Thus purest Springs, as they do forward go, The wider still, and still the deeper grow. Upon the death of the Right worshipful, Sir Walter Pye of the Mynde. Thus full grown, fruitful trees we often find Blown down by sad and unexpected wind. He was an Evening-star, but so divine, As did in glory Morning-stars outshine: Vertue was strong in him, (if truly scan'd) As when the Sun doth in his Zenith stand: The King hath lost a Subject, who should have An everlasting April on his grave. Have you observ'd, how the pure Frankincense Or Storax burning out, delights the sense? So he consum'd and dy'd; He left a Name A glory to his friends, to foes a shame: His death deserves of tears more ample store, Than there be sands upon rich Nilus shore. The Passion of Christ. Vita mea fuit mors Christi; Mors Christi vita mea est. Adam, who names to Creatures gave, Did in fair Edens garden sin: Christ in a garden, man to save, His bitter Passion did begin; There did his sweat, and drops abound, Yea, drops of precious holy blood; Which trickled down unto the ground, And flowed like a crimson flood: There Judas did his Lord betray With a foul and deceitful kiss; Dissemblers cast their souls away, Regarding not eternal bliss. From thence with lanthorns, staves and sword: They led him like a wicked thief; No faithful friend now aid affords, No Angel ministers relief. To Annas then they brought the Lord; The holy Lamb is strongly bound; To murther him they all accord, In whom no guile or sin was found. He could these cords asunder break, His mighty hands did heaven frame; My sins did bind and make him weak, And subject unto pain and shame. Herod did scorn him, and disdain To see so poor, and vile a thing; The Lamb no favour can obtain, When that the crafty Fox is King. To Pilate's Hall they brought him bound For, Pilate judgment was to give: The Judge in him no evil found, But that he might in justice live. They did blindfold the God of Light And struck the peaceful Prince of Love, Though to the blind he gave their sight, Yet nothing could these tyrants move: They spit in his most glorious face, Whose healing spittle cur'd the blind: Although he gave to sinners grace, Yet here he could no favour find: They 'twixt two thieves him crucifie, Who did him mock, and basely scorn; Between two thorns you might espy The Lilly of the vallies torn This was our Saviour's nuptial day, The bitter Cross his marriage bed, Where he his patient head down lay, His loving Spouse the Church to wed: With nails they pierce his hands and feet, And with a cruel spear his side; From whence the Sacraments most sweet Like to a lively stream did glide. At last he bow'd his head divine, All things were finisht and compleat; His Spirit to God he did assigne, And unto us his Merits great. The Children of Bethlehem Vox Sanguinis. A voice was heard in Ramab, or on high; Fair Rachel wept, because her babes must die: In Bethlem Rachel's buried; therefore she Is stil'd the Mother of this Infantrie. No voice comes sooner to the ears of God, Or crieth louder than the voice of blood: Herod the Fox these pretty Lambs did kill, Who the first Martyrs were by act, not will: In act and will I would a Martyr prove, And give this world, to gain the world above. Upon the Worshipful, and most hospitable Gentleman, Andrew Barker Esq; of Fearswood in the County of Gloucester. Integer vitæ, scelerisque purus. Observe bright Heavens constellation, how The stars do join, and make a glorious show. Thus vertues meet in him, whose noble thought Hath pious works unto perfection brought: He keeps a house compleat to strangers free, Without vain-glorious prodigality; No churlish Porter dares to shut his door Against the sad petitions of the poor: No Heresie, no Treason repossest, Or enter'd once into his serious breast; Fidelity and truth did ever guide And steer his ship through every wind and tide: His Wife is like the pleasant Vine, that she May stock the world with good posterity; His lovely Children blest with grace and wit, Like Olive branches at his table sit; And strangers which behold them, soon may gather They are the children of so good a Father. May he ne're cease, through the great power of God, To bud, and flourish like old Aarons rod. Upon Saul seeking his fathers Asses. Saul did much care and diligence express, By seeking Asses in the Wilderness; Three days he travell'd with a serious mind To find them out, but could no Asses find: Find out a hundred you in London may Of Presbyterian Asses in one day. The Moon. It is beleev'd, the Moon so fair, so bright, Doth from the Sun receive her candid light. My soul no beauty, no perfection knows, But what the Sun of glory still bestows. Upon the fair and vertuous Gentlewoman Mrs. M. S. that can sing excellently. Gratior est virtus veniens è corpore pulchro. When first I did this Virgin spie, The object pleas'd my serious eye But when I heard her sing, I swear, The musick took both heart and ear. Those inward vertues please us best, Which are with outward beauty drest; And 'tis a comely thing to find In bodies fair, a fairer mind: The Harp, the Viol hither bring, And Birds, musitians of the Spring; When she doth sing, those must be mute, They are but Cymbals to the Lute: She with her Notes doth rise, and fall, More sweetly than the Nightingal: God in her pious heart keeps place, Seme Angel in her voice and face. The Hen and Chickens. See how the careful Hen, with daily pain, Her young and tender Chickens doth maintain, From ravenous birds secure her young ones lie Under their mothers feather'd canopy: Thus his dear children God together brings, And still protects them with his gracious wings. The bird of prey Gods Doves would soon devour, Did he not guard them with his watchful pow'r. Upon the Honourable Colonel; Sir Randolph Egerton Knight. In pace optimus; in bello maximus. My trumpet is to dull too sound his praise, Who guilds this Nation with his vertuous rayes. His merits do, like Nilus, overflow The banks of comprehension; and I know No better way than silence to commend His vertues, which no measure have, nor end; The muses shall meloudious Anthems sing Of his bold love, and valour for the King. Upon the fair, and vertuous Gentlewoman Mrs. Elizabeth Gwyn of the Hay. I cannot speak her worth, but shew my will, Her merits are beyond my pen, or skill. Her face, and mind is fair, like to the day Unclouded, or like heaven's milkie way, When she inclines to marriage, may she find A lover correspendent to her mind; As she is rich, and comely, so may he Equal in portion, and proportion be: As she is kind, from him let kindnesse flow, And love, which weak defect may never know: So let them both like twyns be fair, and kind, Be rich in grace, be of a loving mind; So let them both continue, till they kisse In love each other to eternal blisse: Wordly Honor. Honos mundi est onus animis. Climb up the highest hill, and you shall find That place most subject to great storms and wind. So wordly Honours, and preferments are But steps to raise you to more grief, and care. To the most Courteous, and fair Gentlewoman the pattern of modesty, and piety Mrs. Elinor Williams of the Gare. As you are perfect without blot, or stain, So may perfection in your Bridegroome raign. As you are young, and tender; so may he In years a little your superiour be. For every marriage then is best in tune, When that the wife is May, the husband June, Let not your heart to beggar's Hall incline, A shrubble should not embrace so tall a pine. A Buzzard must not court the gentle Dove, For such a marriage will prodigious prove. No foolish Wood-cock, must expect to wedde. Or take the rarer Phenix to his bed. Before you Roses fade, joyn hand in hand, Old age will come and plough your finest land. Remember Lots Wife. Exempla plus valent, quam præcepta. A woman turn'd to salt, most true it is; Ovid nere knew that Metamorphosis. The woman chang'd, not man, Gods prime creature, For women are most apt to change by nature. She looked back with a most strong desire, To see old Sodom, which was then on fire. The act of looking back had bin no crime, Had she lookt back but at another time. It was Gods precept, made this act a sin, She had been free, had God not injur'd bin, Salt seasoneth flesh; she's turn'd to salt, that we By her example might well season'd be. Go on (my soul) to God with all thy might, Renounce thy former Sodom of delight. Upon the death of the Right Worshipful: Sir Anthony Mansel, who was shot, and kild at the battel of Newbery: Quis desiderio sit pudor, aut modus, Tam chari capitis: Hora. Death like a coward at a distance stood, When she struck him: his valour was so good, She durst not venter neere: Death to her shame His body kill'd, but could not kill his name. In this sad battel, if fame truth doth say, We got the field, and yet we lost the day. His death eclipst the day, and made it night, And clouds of sorrow did obscure the light. It were injustice to neglect his dust, Whose death was noble, as his life was just: Now heaven crownes him, where all labors cease, Although he dy'd in war, he dy'd in peace: Charity. Quid charitas sine fide? Quid fides sine charitate? The glorious Sun bestows his light, and heat, To cherish us, and make all things compleat. The swelling clouds with water do abound, To succour, and refresh the thirsty ground. The earth yields her increase: the fruitful vine Out of her treasure yields the pleasant wine. All creatures in their kind by nature give. And with their precious store our wants releive; These creatures by example us should move To help each other with a mutual love. To feed the poor who sells his own estate, Doth purchase heaven at an easie rate. God loves a broken heart, an humble knee, An open hand from all vain glory free. The Holy Sacrament, or Supper of the Lord Ubi ratio deficit, fides proficit: Under the forms of sacred bread, and wine, I do receive thee, Lord, and grace divine; Thou art the door, the vine, the corner stone, Thou art the way, the truth; the life alone. Thy mercy to inlarge thou art our bread; Wherewith we are to life eternal fed. Thy blood is wine, which sweetly doth refresh Our weary souls, and cheere our weaker flesh. Who eats this bread, and drinks this cup, shall be From fainting thirst, and pining hunger free. In this sweet bread doth no sour leaven lye Of fraud, of malice or hypocrisie: The bread's thy body, and the wine thy blood, This I beleeve; this faith is safe, and good; Thou art in thy great Sacrament; but how, I simply do confesse, I do not know; It is enough for me that thou art there, I will receive thee, Lord, with joy and fear. Upon the Right Worshipful Sir Richard Floyd, one of his Majesties Honourable Judges in South-Wales. Blush all you scarlet gowns, that heretofore Did wink at rich men, and condemn the poor. Great flyes break through, when the lesser fly In slender cobwebs doth intangled ly. But here is one of Jethro's Judges, he Fears God and is from base corruption free: The person he respects not, but the cause, He fancies not opinion, but the laws. The scales of Justice no fine gold can turn, He righteth those which laugh, and those that mourn. He's careful of the poor; for he doth know That men will soon tread down a hedge that's low. His language is attractive, sweet, and full, And falls like rain into a fleece of wooll. In faith he is a rock: in loyal love For his good King he did a Martyr prove. He is a honest Jude; my active will Would guild his name, had I but perfect skill: Conscience. Conscientia mille Testes, Consider all thy actions, and take heed On stollen bread, though it is sweet, to feed. Sinne like a Bee unto thy hive may bring A little honey, but expect the sting. Thou maist conceal thy sinne by cunning Art, But conscience sits a witnesse in thy heart, Which will disturb thy peace, thy rest undo, For that is witnesse, Judge, and prison too: The pleasant streame doth fair and smoothly glide, When in the bottom no great rubbes abide. No swelling grief, no boystrous cares appear, Where honest ways preserve the conscience clear. Our cloths being new, and fair, we hold it fit, To care, what thing we touch, and where we sit. When they are foul, or torne, we leave that care, And cast them up and down like broken ware: Tis so with conscience; while 'tis fair within, We fear to stain it with some heynous sin: If once the Virgin-Conscience plays the quean, We seldom after care to keep it clean. Then keep thy conscience, like thy paper white, And do not blot, when thou maist fairly write. The Shrew. Ventus ab Aquilone: Behold her lip, how thin it is; her nose How sharp, her voice how shrill, which doth disclose A froward shrew; who hath her by mishap, Shall surely hear a constant thunder-clap: Silence is her disease; for like a mill Her clapper goes, and never standeth still. By night Hobgoblins houses haunt: this sprite Doth vex, and haunt the house both day and night. The Rack the wheele, the Spanish Inquisition Torments not like her tongue; A sad condition Her husband lives in; like a coward he Must leave the field, and always vanquisht be. He must commend, what she doth well approve, And disallow of what she doth not love. We tame wild fouls, bears, lions: but no Art To tame a shrew could any yet impart. Upon a Gentlewoman with a bad face but a good, and pious mind. Here Uertue is eclipst: and I do find Her face a mask unto her fairer mind: Thus Diamonds in rocks, as story tells, And precious pearls are found in oyster-shells. In this dark Lanthorn burnes a lamp most bright, Under this cloud there is a glorious light; Sweet vertues sparkling from her soul divine, Will break forth through the thickest clouds, and shine. Nature in framing her, her skill forgot, When she should fairly write, shee did but blot. Her outside she compos'd of sturdy buffe, But grace hath lind her with more precious stuffe. Nature, and Grace in her could not agree, The one was sparing, and the other free. The Harlot. Pestis Reipublicæ. The Harlot is the broad way unto hell, A laborinth, a ditch, a poisnous well; She is a nightly glow-worm: Canker'd brasse; A common Inne, a sink, a broken glasse. Her love is lust, her lover is a slave, Her arms are fetters, and her bed a grave. She doth perfume her wanton lips, and hair, When her corrupted breath infects the air: Some fool will venture for a wanton kisse, As Eve did for an apple, heavens blisse. Thus children for a nut will part with gold, Thus Esau for some broth his birth right sold. Use thy own fountain; stollen waters please, Lascivious minds, and breed the souls disease; The Wish. Hoc est summum mei, caputque voti; A little house, a quiet wife, Sufficient food to nourish life, Most perfect health, and free from harm, Convenient cloths to keep me warm. The liberty of foot, and mind And grace the ways of God to find. This is the summe of my desire, Until I come unto heavens quire. Upon the most beautiful, hospitable, and Ingenuous Gentlewoman Mrs: Blanch Morgan of the Therow. Some fragant flowers the smell, some trees the sight, Do much content, some pearls are wondrous bright; There's not so sweet a flower, so fair a tree, So pure a gemme in all the world, as she: Some Ladies humble are, and some are wise; Some chast, some kind, some fair to please the eyes All vertues do in her like stars appear, And make a glorious constellation there. Fasting. Jejunavit Christus non per necessitatem, sed per dispensationem, ut ostenderet, quàm bonum sit Jejunium. Full Barrels make no sound, nor can they pray With perfect love, who banquet all the day. Fasting extenuates sin: it doth controul, And check the lustful motions of the soul: Fasting doth make our prayers flame more high, And prayer doth our fasting sanctifie: To fast from meat my body shall begin, And then my soul shall sooner fast from sin. Thy Saints and Angels, Lord, nor drink, nor eat, Receive my soul, and I will use no meat; Thou art the Well, and bread of life: on thee I'le feed with Heavens blessed Hierarchy. Baptism. Baptismus Johannis erat in spe ad pœnitentiam; baptismus Christi erat revera ad remissionem peccatorum. The Baptism of water, a good thing Common to all, cannot salvation bring, The Baptism of fire, and the Holy Ghost Must make us live, or else our life is lost. Baptize me, Lord, if thou shalt think it good With fire, and with the baptism of blood: Sickness. Omnes sani facilè ægrotis consilium damus. Ask me no more, Which is the greatest wealth Our rich possessions, liberty, or health? For riches, freedome, without health to me Make but sad musick without harmony. Rust eateth Iron: and the finest cloth Is spoil'd, and fretted by the envious moth; Through sickness strength and beauty fade away, As when a cloud obscures the fairest day; Each sickness is Gods prison; and more sad Than any which cruel Tyrants had. When the sore gout doth but possess the toe, Where is thy former liberty to go? A golden Crown can no great comfort be, When th' head is troubled with a plethorie. Call for delicious Quails, Canary Wine, The finest Bread, or Manna more divine; These to thy palate will distastful prove, When nothing can thee to disgestion move, Much more diseases will in man appear, Than there be dayes existent in the year. O health, O perfect health, the gift of God, When we grow wanton, sickness is his rod: When I am sick or well, grant, Lord, I may Remember thee, and not forget to pray. To the most affable, charitable, and ingenuous Gentleman, Roger Vaughan of Moccas, Esq Nobilis ingenio, natura, moribus, ortu. Mistake me not; It is not my intent To court you with a formal complement; Should I presume to set your praises forth, I should but injure you, and blot your worth, My drops can never make the Sea more full, And I confess, my Candle is too dull To add more light unto the Sun; my mind Would active be, but still defects I find. My slender power doth compell my pen To leave that task to more judicious men. The tongue. Bona lingua nihil melius, Mala lingua nihil pejus. Give not the Bridle to thy hasty tongue, A mad colt speeds, and may his Master wrong. A tongue well drest is excellent meat; ill drest It is distastful, and will not disgest: The tongue is fire, soft fire gives pleasant heat, But if it flames too high, the danger's great: Who gives full scope, and lets his tongue go free, Will but endanger his own Liberty. In silent streams we find the deepest foords, And Wisdom's most, where there is least of words: Excessive words, which like great tides do swell Above their banks, unhappy effects foretell. Upon the Right Worshipful, Sir John Awbrey of Lantrethit, Knight. Honestas rumor optimum est patrimonium. Since Truth is from the earth to heaven fled, Men are by strange, and various fancies led: The times did alter, yet the world may see This Knight from change, but not from chance was free. Some mens Religion like a blaze of fire Caus'd by dry sticks or thorns, will soon expire. Such will not row their boat, but where they find The tide most calm, free from tempestuous wind. But he great storms, and dangers did foresee, Yet no foul shipwrack of his faith could be: No danger could his resolution shake, Or on his soul a base impression make. Men might abuse his body, name, or land, They never could his braver soul command. The Sun's less constant; for since he begun, He ne're went back, like Hezekiah's Sun: I'le speak no more; he praised Cæsar best, Who silent wonder'd, and did speak the least. To the Right Worshipful, Sir Richard Basset of Bewper, Knight. Instar omnium. If commendation is to valour due, Or vertue, praise then is a debt to you You could not stoop, nor alter, like the wind, The loyal resolution of your mind, You bravely stood in times of war and fear Like some bright Star sixt in your proper sphear. Such sparks of Valour from your eyes did fly, As put your foes into an extasy. Your Noble actions do transcend all wit, Or copious lines, unless an Angel writ. Upon his much honoured friend, Major Henry Stedman. How shall I write of him, whose pleasant rayes Do further spread than my weak skill or praise? His mind is like sweet Edens Garden; which Was fair in trees, as he in vertues rich. His Loyalty is known, his Valour try'd, Nor can his serious Judgement be deny'd. East was not more divided from the West, Than Treason from his unpolluted breast. His faith is Catholick, and it is vain To tempt him with a fond fanatick strain. Although his Boat with waves and wind was tost, He ne're his course or resolution lost. To the Worshipful, Edward Powel, Esq; of the Maes Maur. My Pensil is too dull to paint your name With such a gloss, as may advance your fame. Yet I have writ you down; for I believe Your name more lustre to my Book will give: As precious stones adorn a golden Ring, And lillies beauty to the Valleys bring, So he that will on your perfections look, Shall find, they are a splendour to my Book. You are my friend; which some may think not true: Because I do so slightly write of you. Upon the Right Worshipful, Nicholas Arnold of Lantony, Esq Honesty is the best policy: Behold an Israelite, in whom's no gaile, Nor doth foul practice his fair hands defile, The worldly wise do study, watch, and plot, And tread all paths, that riches may be got. If Naboth's Vineyard fruitful is, then they With Naboth's blood will Naboth's Vineyard bay. But his soul is contented, and doth hate To wander further than his own estate. He soars not high with an ambitious wing, But is contented, like a private spring, To keep his constant course: no muddy gain Of ill got treasure shall his conscience stain. Thus have I seen a calm and pleasant tide Without all noise, or swelling billows slide His faith he pins not on anothers slieve, Nor changeth like the times: his soul doth grieve To see mad people, free from fear and grace, Besiege the Church, and storm the Sacred place. He is a friend true learning to advance, For learning hath no foe, but Ignorance: I wish him happy dayes, and life to see His vertues shine in his posterity. A Perewig. ?Ut moveat cornicula risum Furtivis nudata coloribus. VVelcome (brave gallant) with those locks so fair It is a question, who doth own that hair; The owner sure is dead; but when, or how, O in what place he dy'd, thou dost not know. Perhaps he dy'd at Bedlam, then take heed, Those hairs mad fancies in thy head may breed. Perchance sad Tyburn was the fatal place Where he did end his dayes for want of grace. If it be so, they will infect thy brain, And cause thee to delight in thievish gain. If from some broken Chamber-maid they fell, They'l move to lust, and modest thoughts expell. Or if they grew upon a drunken head, Thou seldom wilt go sober to thy bed: But if they came from some bad Statesman's ground, A Matchivillian Knave thou mayst be found: Thus these dead excrements, if thou them use, Will but bad thoughts and qualities infuse. Cast off those looser hairs, which every wind Will fright away, and shew thy vainer mind: God numbers all our hairs: let no man scoff At that, which God doth take such notice of: Besides, it is a sinful, shameful part, To slubber Natures work with sluttish Art. Upon his most dear and pious Uncle, Mr. James Parry, Parson of Tedstone. VVhile the new teachers in the Pulpit prate, His works his Sermons are, which do dilate, And spread themselves: we may his pious mind, And inward faith by outward actions find: A good tree bears good fruit; the Olive tree Is fat; but figs from thistles cannot be: The poor flock to him for supply and rest, As birds do fly unto the warmer nest: He lives not to the world; no base desire Of gold inflames him, or ambitious fire. He praiseth God, and doth contented live, Whether the hand of God doth take or give. Afflictions are his blessings, and the rod Which chastens him, doth bring him home to God: He lives to day, as if he'd die to morrow, Life is to him no joy, nor yet a sorrow. Hell. Qui per malam vitam negligit cœlum, per justitiam Dei cadit in Infernum. Good Lord, deliver me from hell, where grief Is without end, and pain without relief. In this dark dungeon damned spirits lie, Where the foul worm of conscience doth not die, Nor fire go out; where the most wretched soul Doth but in vain for pardon cry and houl; Here they do gnash their teeth, they spend sad tears, Full of distractions, horrid thoughts, and fears. From Gods sweet presence, from eternal light, From holy Angels, and from Saints delight, From heavens glory now they banisht are, What torment is this, no man can declare; If after twenty thousand years of pain, And thousands more the damn'd were sure to gain A pardon, and come out, this grant would be Some comfort to them in their misery. But there is no such hope: the Judgement's past, And cannot be revok'd; the gate is fast, And never can be opened: who can tell, What dreadful lamentations are in hell? I know that heaven is above; but how, Or where hell stands, Lord, let me never know. The prosperity of the wicked. Ut paupertas bonorum est beata, sic prosperitas impiorum est maledicta. Sometimes the wicked flourish like the bay, Which still keeps green, when better trees decay. Have you observ'd, how little streams do swell, And rise above their banks, and then have fell, And sunk into their Channels? so we know, Base men have risen high, then fallen low: That Kingdom is in an unhappy case, Where Cedars fall, and shrubs possess their place: With joy and pleasure Upstarts climb the hill, Again they tumble down against their will: Those men do much mistake, who only measure A Christians welfare by his worldly treasure: An Angel hath no gold, no beasts, nor land, And yet he is not poor; his wealth doth stand In better things: although the just mans store Is small; he hath enough, and needs no more God doth his grace instead of wealth impart, And with contentment doth enrich his heart. The bad mans wealth with discontent doth dwell, His heaven is but intermixt with hell; Be not in love with gold: a golden purse Is without grace no blessing, but a curse. The Martyr. Martyrium est baptismus sanguinis. Some in gay feathers do the Peacocks play, While 'tis fair weather, and a sunny day; But when 'tis clouded, and the storms begin, Like fearful snails they keep their horns within. Pure Fountain-water doth most heat contain The winter time: Good men, in greatest pain, And hardest times or dangers, valiant prove, And do express the greatest heat of love A Christian from his faith will never start, If thousands should present, and fire his heart: He loves not life, life is to him a pain; He fears not death, death is to him a gain: He dies a Saint, for truth who spends his breath; The cause proclaims a Martyr, not the death: The blood of Martyrs is the fruitful seed, Which being sown, doth still more Christians breed. The DEVIL. Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum. God bless me from the Devil: woe to man, If God rules not that great Leviathan. Dark, foggy mists he casts before our eyes, To make us credit his phantastick lyes: His greatest proffers are but painted toyes, Lin'd through with grief, and onely fac'd with joyes. With pleasant potions, and with sugred pills The Devil tempts his patient when he kills. He tempted David with Bathsheba fair; Judas with silver-pieces, whom despair Brought to perdition: with a beauteous face He brought two wanton Elders to disgrace: With Naboths vineyard Achab he beguil'd, So he with blood his guilty hands defil'd. He cozen'd Achan with a wedge of gold, Eve with an apple: No man can unfold His various tricks; he knoweth when to fish, What bait you love, what things you chiefly wish. Three ways he useth most; Wine, women, wealth, By which he creeps into the heart by stealth: Resist him at the first, he'll flie away; Get but the morning, and you have the day. The Sinners Petition. Non opus est misericordia, ubi non est peccatum. After some sick and tedious hours of night, The Patient longs for the approaching light: The thirsty Deer doth panting run, and look, Desiring to find out the water-brook: So pants my soul, and sighs, and longs to see Thy saving health to make thy servant free. How am I circled with thick clouds of sin, And still a thred of vain delights I spin. The Sun of glory these dark clouds can chase, And cleer me with the beauty of his face. Wash (Lord) my scarlet sins, that knowest how To make me whiter than the fleece of snow: Remember not my rash and ill spent youth, When I could fancy lyes, and hate the truth. Those sins are wormwood now, and bitter gall, My pleasures then, I now my sorrows call: I creep unto thy gate, and do implore Thy gracious love to cure my cankred sore: Receive me in, although I come so late, Thou hast the keyes to open heavens gate. A Hymn. Hear me, thou God of my delight: Me inspire with thy fire Pure and bright. Cleer my face with thy grace; Turn, I pray, night to day, With the beams of thy glorious light. My waters calm, and cure me with thy balm; Have in store for my sore Some redress, Rid my fears, wipe the tears Which mine eyes do surprise, And me with thy pleasures bless. Great King, break not a bruised reed, Give me bread to be fed At my need. Call to mind (Lord) how kind Christ thy Son me hath won, When his precious side must bleed. Keep me from thrall, and let me never fall Into woe, lest my foe May be glad. Let thy wing comfort bring To my mind when I find My soul in her mourning clad. All laud unto the glorious King, Whose great love we may prove By each thing. Heart and voice shall rejoyce, And my breath unto death Shall harmonious Anthems sing. Lord, when I die, let my spirit flie To thy throne, where alone Thou dost raign. Perfect health, and true wealth, Quiet peace never cease, In thy Kingdom, there's no pain. Glory unto the Father be, To the Son it be done Equally Praise and boast th' Holy Ghost With thy power every hour, One true God in Persons three. Now 'tis even as heretofore it was, And shall be certainly Evermore: His great light hath no night, Nor can he changed be, But remains as he was before. Drunkenness. Ebrietas brevis est insania. Use golden Temperance; that anchor may In greatest floods, thy boat that wanders, stay. Who drinks too much, and doth in taverns dwell, May want a drop to cool his tongue in hell. Poets write of Men transform'd to beasts: if true, I do believe they were some Drunken crue No Wolf, no Ass more fierce, more shameless can Or careless be, than is a drunken man: Lust, murder, folly, falshood, anger, pride Possess foul Drunkards, and their humors guide: Who runs, (and ne'r returns) this dirty way, Travels too hard to cast his soul away. Avoid the Ale-house: who frequents the door Where harlots live, will learn to love a whore. Lord bless me, that with Christ I may be able Before a drunken Inne to choose a stable. The Fountain O Fons, lucido splendidior vitro! Here I do bathe my body, wash my face: To cleanse my sins, I use the spring of grace. This fountain from a stony rock doth flow, Which teacheth me my Saviour Christ to know. He is the Rock, from whence a vertuous spring Proceeds to cleanse the beggar, and the King. Herein a Chrystal cleerness doth appear, Which teacheth me to keep my Conscience clear: This little fountain from all mud is free, When greater streams are dark and troubled be: Secure content doth crown a mean estate, When Honors are obscur'd by envious fate. Here I do drink, and fear no poisonous charm; Rich wine in golden cups contain more harm. The running Fountain makes no sluggish stay, But keeps its course, and travels night and day: Nor will I spend my life as in a dream, But labour to be active, as the stream Here without grudge the traveller shall stay And quench his thirst, although he nothing pay: Which teacheth me to bind the bruised reed, And give my cruse of oil to those that need. This pleasant Spring unto the sea doth haste, And spends both day and night, yet doth not waste: My tears shall never cease my God to move, Until they run into his sea of love. The Fountain doth alone, and secret dwell, Like some chaste Nun in a religious cell: A private life, obscure, doth best agree With my desires, from noise and tumults free. The Prodigal Son ? Facilis descensus averni, Sed revocare gradum; superasque evadere ad auras: Hic labor, hoc opus est. Once did I spread abroad my glorious train, And like a Cedar little shrubs disdain: Amongst small fish I thought my self a Whale, None might me ballance in an equal scale. Reason was not my guide; each wanton sense Did wander through the whole circumference: Sometimes the center of my pleasure lay Fixt in the bed of lust: the glorious Day Did usher in my fancies, and the Night Was but my secret Pander to delight. I robb'd the painful Silkworm of her store, And polisht English fleece with Indian ore; Which by reflexion from the Suns bright rays, Dull'd the beholders eyes, and made fools praise My handsom feature, although every part Was little bound to Natures work, but Art. No cloud of sorrow did eclipse my joy, Nor mud of envy did my spring annoy: Each day produc'd strange dishes of content, To give my palate a new complement: With women, wine, and cards I spent the day, Which like the wind chas'd clouds of cares away. But when my stock was spent, my thoughts did fall, I lost the Court, and found the Beggars hall: The stubborn husks, which nasty hogs do eat, Was then my onely dish, and constant meat The scales of sin fell from my watry eyes, And real truths I did discern from lyes. In haste I ran into my Fathers arms, And now with him I live secure from harms: I'le drown my sins in tears, and never more Spend oil in vain, that I may pay my score. HEAVEN. Non est mortale quod opto. The world's an empty chest, where nothing lies, Which may content the longing heart or eyes: Figs from these thistles we shall never gain, Nor grapes of pleasure from these thorns of pain My soul disdains the Earth, and sores above, Feather'd with wings of an immortal love. The Prisoner, which in some dark dungeon lies, No comfort feels, nor light of sun espies: What joy would he conceive, if he were free, And could enjoy his wished liberty? So my imprison'd soul expects the day, When Nature shall dissolve this house of clay: For then I shall ascend with swift desire, And sudden motion to the Angels quire; Where I shall see that glorious, Sacred face, Which joyes all creatures, lightneth every place, No Sun or Moon shines there; no day or night, The Lamb himself is the eternal light. There is the Mercy-Seat: the holy hill, Where neither thieves nor tyrants rob or kill. No shackles hurt the feet, nor cares the mind, The poor man there is free from storms and wind. All discontent, all imperfection dyes, The lame receive their feet, the blind their eyes. All tears are wip't away: None doth command, Each Saint doth hold a Scepter in his hand: Lord, let me see thy Court; I seek no more, But the least place to stand behind the door. Upon the most Hospitable, and Courteous Gentleman, the Worshipful, Thomas Lewis, Esq; of Langorse. As at a fountain every thirsty soul May freely drink, and fill his empty bowl; So doth his kindness, and his bounty flow, Like some high tide, which doth no measure know; As the pure air is from base mixture free, Without all vapours, or malignity; So his untainted heart disdains to be A friend to Schism, or Disloyalty: As on a Rock a house doth firmly stand, And bravely scorn both wind and rains command; So his most Noble resolution stood Firm for the Church, the King, and Countreys good. Black Patches. Vanitas vanitatum. Ladies turn Conjurers, and can impart The hidden mystery of the Black-Art. Black artificial patches do betray, They more affect the works of night, than day. The Creature strives the Creator to disgrace By patching that, which is a perfect face: A little stain upon the purest dye, Is both offensive to the heart and eye; Defile not then with spots that face of snow, Where the wise God his workmanship doth show The light of nature, and the light of grace, Is the complexion for a Ladies face. Powdred Hair. Malè olet. Some proud phantastick Coxcomb takes more pain And greater care to dress his hair, than brains: And he doth study, that his hair may have A better dye, than God and Nature gave; Furnish thy head with knowledge; I presume, That with a wise man is the best perfume. A Wife. Imperet illa nihil, quicquid tamen impetret uxor, utere nec serva conjuge, nec Domino. Art thou resolv'd for Marriage? then relie On God to chuse, not on the wanton eye. Men may intend, or purpose: It is not The man, but God, which ties the marriage knot. Fix not thy mind on beauty: that fair shade Will quickly pass, that fair flower will fade, Vertue and beauty to one place confin'd, Is the best glue, which can affection bind. A modest maid with beauty stor'd, and grace, Hath wealth enough, and portion in her face. To take a Wife for wealth, and not for love, Will but a sickness, not a Marriage prove. Chuse one well born: all waters do (we know) More sweet from fountains, than from channels flow. Graff on a Noble Stock, and you shall find Such pleasant fruit as will delight your mind: Doat not on her which doth the wanton play, And think with gold and pearl t'outshine the day. Give me a wife, that can the Spindle use, The Book, the Needle, free from brawls and news. Take heed of her, that sanctifies her face, And never prates without a Scripture phrase. One chast, and merry, lovely, kind, and wise, Active, well bred, contents both heart and eyes. Desire the hand of God to point thy wayes; He never falls, that in his journey prayes. The Rainbow. Ingens bibit arcus. Virg. Variety of colours may be seen Within the Rainbow, chiefly red and green. Green shews the Deluge, which did overflow, And drown the whole Creation here below: Red shews the world, (when times age shall expire) Must be refin'd, if not consum'd by fire. We see no arrow in this bow, nor string, It threatens not, but doth glad-tidings bring: The glorious bow of heaven doth foreshow Sweet showers of Blessings, not of Judgements now Grant me thy mercies, Lord, cast not thy dart, Nor shoot thine arrow at my wounded heart. The Carpenter. Is not this the Carpenter's Son? God is the Carpenter, whose skilful hand Upon the waters made this Orb to stand. He did compose the gate, which is the way To heavens bliss; and keeps himself the key: He hath his Plain, when we are rough and wild, To make our stubborn Natures smooth and mild He hath his perfect Rule, his Sawe, his Axe, To order that which reformation lacks. This Carpenter makes hearts and hands agree, And joins them fast in bonds of Unity. Lord, join and glue my soul to thee so well, That I in thee, and thou in me may'st dwell. Upon the Worshipful, and most hopeful Gentleman, Thomas Prise of Whisteston, Esq He is in years but young, yet grave and wise, Old age and youth in him do sympathize. Nature made use of Art, before she could Make one at the same time both young and old. His heart is gallant, humble, just, and free, There only vertues keep their Hierarchie. The pleasant Whisteston is his Mansion place, Where Nature Art, and Art doth Nature grace. In that fair dwelling we may find much pleasure, But yet in him consists the chiefest treasure! Wealth, Honour, Pleasure, are no more, we find, But hansome Pages to his Nobler mind. Upon the Nobly minded, and most pious Gentlewoman, Mrs. Mary Williams, daughter to that worthy Gentleman, Thomas Gwyn of the Hay-Castle, Esq; Sæcula Phœnices nulla tulere duos. Fresh is the morn, the Maiden-head of day. Sweet are the flowers which breath perfumes in May: Fair is the Rose in June: so doth her heart The sweetest ornaments of grace impart: Here Vertue sits inthron'd, as if she were Contented only with her dwelling there: Her alms and pious deeds beyond compare, For her a seat in heaven do prepare: And glorious heaven is the fittest place To entertain so good a heart and face: I wish, the Sun an hundred years may rise With joy to wait upon her brighter eyes. Affliction. Deus vulnerat carnem ut sanet mentem. When for delight I took the purer air, I have observ'd sweet Meadows green and fair O'relaid with dung, which spoil'd the present grace But afterwards it gave a better face: Affliction makes one dark, but we may find, It adds more gracious beauty to the mind. Afflictions are Gods Skullions; and these must Scoure and preserve his houshold stuff from rust; They are his Masons, which do smooth and square Stones for the Temple, which unpolisht are: The more the patient Camamile we tread, The more it will by dilatation spread The gentle fire, if often blown, will burn With greater heat, and to more fury turn: So Christians by afflictions stronger grow, They patience may no base submission show. When Christ was on the earth, they crown'd his head With thorns, and made the wooden Cross his bed. They gave him vinegar and gall, when he Did sorely thirst in his strong agonie: If that the King could have no better meat, What dainties shall the beggar think to eat? The Paschal Lamb with bitter herbs was eaten, If we are Christs, we surely shall be beaten. The World. Omnia vanitas. The World's a garden, which the fancy feeds, And yields few wholsom herbs, but many weeds. Fools may commend, and give a golden gloss To things that glister, but indeed are dross. When serious I consider in my cage The strange Meanders of the present Age, And see the chance and change of every thing From the poor beggar to the richest King: All worldly pleasures but false dreams I find, Which may distract, but not content the mind. Our life is short, our greatest riches vain, Our wisdom folly, and our pleasure pain. As wave on wave, so grief on grief doth fall, One trouble doth another sorrow call. Build on the Rock, if thou wilt safely stand: He sinks, who builds upon deceitful sand. The Remedy of Love. No woman lives, but in her eye We may some moats or beams espy. Thy Helen may be fair; but stay, Thy Helen will the wanton play. Thy Celia may be fair, but proud: Crumena rich, but sharp and loud: Eugenia may be full of wit, But wisdom wants to temper it. Lutetia may deserve thy love, If vertue can affection move: She's fair within, but foul without; And who would use a dirty clout? A foul tripe may thy taste annoy: Eat Phesants still, they will thee cloy. And thus no Beauty is so cleer, But storms in it, and clouds appear. Some foul disease, some grievous pain May Celia's blushing roses stain; Or age with furrows will disgrace The pleasant meadow of her face. Consider then; be sick no more, Since reason may thy health restore: If beauty doth so quickly pass, Oh seek a richer pearl than glass; That precious Beauty, which expels All clouds of grief, in heaven dwels: There fix thy mind, and thou shalt see What imperfections women be. Judas his Kiss. Judas did with a Kiss his Lord betray: Many seem friends, when they the Traitors play. Judas was proud, and kist our Saviours face; Presumption brought him to th' infernal place. Mary did kiss Christs feet; which humble kiss Exalted her to the celestial bliss. Judas and Mary kist him; both we find Alike in lips, but much dislike in mind, God weighs the heart; whom we can never move By outward actions, without inward love. Upon the most learned Gentleman, Doctor Aurelius Williams, Dr. of Physick. Some writers hold, which is most strange to me, There may of souls a transmigration be. If it be so, I swear, that Galen is Reviv'd in him by Metampsychosis. A thousand more than dy'd, Death thought to kill, Had Death not been prevented by his skill. Upon a drunken Woman. Would'st thou a Monster, or a Devil see? Or else in Nature some sad Prodigie? Then on a drunken Woman cast thine eye, All those are seen in her deformity. The Priesthood. ??? ???? ?????? ??????. 'Twas Jeroboam's practice, and his sport, Priests to elect out of the baser sort. As it was in those dayes of old: so now They have full orders, which no order know. Drones, knaves, and fools, for Church-preferment look, Those fish, and catch it with a silver hook. Such Workmen in Christs Vineyard, will, I fear, More shame the work, than help good labourers there. The Priesthood is a holy, Sacred thing, Deriv'd from Christ, both Prophet, Priest, and King. This pearl is fit for Merchants, that can tell The use thereof, and know the value well. Let not this rich and precious oyle be shed, Or pour'd on any, but wise Aaron's head. The wise men came with reverence to Christs stable. But fools will come without it to his table. Those must have perfect eyes that guide the blind. Who sin corrects, should have the purest mind. Those must have skill in Musick, that can sing One of the Songs of Sion to the King: Christ once had need, but cannot now abide Unto the Temple on as Ass to ride: God doth inflame his Priests with Sacred fire, And them he doth with different gifts inspire: Some wound, some heal our sores; some weep, some sing Some thunder Judgements; some glad-tydings bring. No Souldier will prepare himself to fight, Unless the Warlick Trumpet soundeth right: Then Prelate be not rash t'impose thy hand, The Holy Ghost is not at thy command. The Merciful Samaritane. No balm from Gilead, no Physitian can Heal me, but Christ the true Samaritan. When I am sick, and when my wounds are foul, He hath his oyle and wine to clense my soul. My sins the thieves, which wounded me, have bin, Help, Lord, conduct me to thy peaceful Inn. The poor Widows mite. Our Saviour did prefer the Widows mite Before the rich mens gifts: God takes delight More in the heart, than hands; and he doth measure How great our love is, not how much our treasure: Give all thy full possessions, but thy love, Thy gift will an abomination prove. Love makes cold water wine, small actions great, And without love no bounty is compleat. Upon the sad departure of the right reverend Father in God, and the most learned Prelate, William Nicolson, from Caermarthin in South-Wales, to his Bishopick of Gloncester. Sol vespertinas discedens duplicat umbras. Quanta sed abscessum est umbra sequuta tuum? The light which did direct us, will appear, Or shine no more in our dark Hemisphear. We lost a Shepherd, which could wisely keep The Fox and Wolf from preying on the sheep. His Catechism is in doctrine sound, In language sweet, in learning most profound. This he hath left behind him; and we look On nothing more than on his serious book: He made his Farewel-Sermon: ne're was known More grief, than now in Prophet Mertin's town. He utter'd many words; unless fame lyes, More tears by far flow'd from the peoples eyes. For Gloucesters Reformation, God thought fit To use his faithful pains, and holy wit. And if he can by wholesome doctrine bring These in obedience to the Church and King, It will a greater miracle be thought, Than any of the old Apostles wrought: His godly presence doth make others live In peaceful joy; his absence makes us grieve. Upon the much honoured Gentleman, John Delahay of Alltrynis, Esq Conspicuæ virtutis amor dominatur in illo Non magnus fieri, sed studet esse bonus. An old Philosopher with a Candle ran About the streets to find an honest man. Had he liv'd now, and met with him, I swear He had been pleas'd to stay his journey there. Or if he had refused him for one, He might in vain through all the world have gone. Upon the Worshipful Milborn Williams Esq; Son to that most excellent Knight, Sir Henry Williams of Gwernivet. Magnorum haudquaquam indignus avorum. 'Tis my ambition to remember those Whose vertuous minds their actions do disclose Some men, like owls, cannot behold the light, Nor judge of colours, be they black or white: Such I neglect, and write of those who can Discern a Picture from a living man. His knowledge is not weak, nor judgment dull, But strong, and bright, like Cynthia in the full. His gentle nature is so free, so fair, So full of sweetness, as the purer air: He beats an humble mind, and knoweth well, That by ambition holy Angels fell. He was so zealous for the Kingly cause, As old Judge Jenkins for the Kingdoms Laws. To number the bright stars, requires less pains, Than all the vertues which his heart contains To cut his thred of lif, when Fates agree, A great Eclipse in Brecknock-shire will be. DEATH. Omnibus hæc calcanda via est. Welcom (sweet Death) I love thy cold embrace: The rich, and bad cannot endure thy face Life is a passage unto Death; and Death An entrance into life: When mortal breath Is once expir'd; to live then we begin Which life secures us both from death and sin Conceive a precious pearl involv'd in clay, Which can its lustre by no means display: So doth the brighter soul imprison'd lie In this black dungeon of obscurity: Nor shall its glory shine, until 'tis free From the dark clouds of dull mortality. To come into the world, one way we have; A thousand ways to hasten to the grave. The day of Death is secret kept, that we Might every day suspect that day to be. As I am not asham'd to live, so I Can never truly be afraid to die. O Death! O watchful Death! thou look'st for me: I am prepar'd, O Death! and look for thee. Simeon's Song Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word. Some, when they die blaspheme, and some are mad: Some curse and swear, some desperate are some sad: But no distraction racks the just mans mind, No strange conceits his understanding blind. Out of this life so God his servant calls, As when the Infant into slumber falls. When Simeon had enricht his blessed eyes With seeing Christ, the world he did despise: He dy'd in peace; and like a Swan did sing Before his death, an Anthem to the King. Christ like a Lamb did die: whilst you have breath, Pray for a quiet and a peaceful death. Upon the Worshipful, and much deserving Gentleman, John Jeffreys of Abercunrick Esquire. ? Nondum mutatus ab isto Hectore, qui quondam. Can silence fit the present stage, or dare Our tongues be silent, where such merits are? His actions are too great, too good to lie Under a bushel in obscurity. He was not Linsey-woolsey, or content To be compos'd of King and Parliament: He was most loyal, and could not dispence With such base freedom to his conscience, As to neglect his King: he hath a heart, From whence transparent beams of Vertue dart: After sad years of cruel storms and wind, He shall a Haven, and a Heaven find. The Gardener. She supposing him to be the Gardener, said unto him, Job. 20. Mary prevents the day; she rose to weep, And see the bed, where Jesus lay asleep. She found out whom she sought; but doth not know Her Masters face; he is the Gardener now. This Gardener Edens Garden did compose, For which the chiefest Plants and Flowers he chose. He took great care to have sweet Rivers run T'enrich the ground, where he his work begun. He is the Gardener still, and knoweth how To make the Lilies and the Roses grow. He knows the time to set, when to remove His living plants to make them better prove. He hath his pruning knife, when we grow wild, To tame our nature, and make us more mild: He curbs his dearest children: when 'tis need, He cuts his choycest Vine, and makes it bleed. He weeds the poisonous herbs, which clog the ground. He knows the rotten hearts, he knows the sound. The blessed Virgin was the pleasant bower, This Gardener lodg'd in his appointed hour: Before his birth his Garden was the womb, In death he in a Garden chole his Tomb. Copernicus his opinion confirm'd. Copernicus his fancy may hold good, The earth did only move, the heavens stood. So earth and houses wheeling round about, And changing Climats, found new Masters out. The Changes. Tempora mutantur, nos &amp; mutamur in illis. The painful Bee, which to her hive doth bring Sweet honey, in her tail retains a sting Our sweetest joyes are interlin'd with cares, No field of corn, but hath some choaking tares. The stream, which doth with silent motion slide, Is oftentimes disturb'd with wind and tide. Who sits to day in Honours lap, and sings, God soon can change his tune, and clip his wing. Sometimes the Sea doth ebb, and sometimes flow, Now with anon against the tide we row; No haven's so secure, but some ill blast May toss the ship, and break the stately Mast: Who now in Court doth dance, and lift his head, To morrow droops, and sickly keeps his bed. The King may beg, and beggars may command. High Cedars fall, when little shrubs do stand. The sweetest comfort I do feel, or find, Though fortune change, is not to change my mind. The Hour-glass. Inter spem? metum? timores inter &amp; iras Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum. Our time consumes like smoke, and posts away, Nor can we treasure up a month or day. The sand within the transitory glass Doth haste, and so our silent minutes pass. Consider how the lingring hour-glass sends Sand after sand, until the stock it spends. Year after year we do consume away, Until our debt to Nature we do pay. Old age is full of grief: the life of man (If we consider) is but like a span Stretcht from a swollen hand: the more extent It is by strength, the more the pains augment Desire not to live long, but to live well, How long we live not years, but actions tell. Pride, and Humility. Humilis descendendo ascendit, superbus ascendendo descendit. What pride possesseth man, that is but clay Which must dissolve, and melt like yce away? What frothy balm of self-conceit and love, Doth puff his heart, and such high fancies move? Who doth presume to climb the highest wall, Will soonest slip, and catch the heaviest fall. Proud men have fallen from their stately chairs, And falling once, have tumbled down the stairs. The shrubs are most secure, and free from wind, When lofty trees a strong resistance find. Behold the twig, which gently bends and bows, When stubborn Oaks are broken, stands and grows. Vertue is sooner found in Cotts and Cells, Than in great Courts, where pride and envy dwells, A contrite heart, (O Lord) a bended knee, Like sweet perfume, shall at thy Altar be. Christs Resurrection-day: or Easter. As when through misty clouds and troubled air The Sun breaks forth, and makes the heavens fair, So Christ the glorious Bridegroom, came this day Out of his Chamber, where he secret lay; The brighter Sun is up, whose pleasant rayes Do bless the earth with good and happy dayes; Display thy warmer beams, and to my heart More fervent heat of zeal and love impart; Death could not kill, or conquer life; nor might The thickest darkness comprehend the light; Had he bin still interr'd, then we had bin For ever slaves to Satan, Death, and Sin; The Jews to keep him there, (O fond conceit) Roul'd to his grave a stone of heavy weight; His body pierc't the stone, but was not able To pierce their hearts far more impenetrable! He could remove vast Mountains with his Word, And in the Sea to them a grave afford; The Mountain of my sins from me remove, And drown them (Lord) in thy deep Sea of Love; This joyful morning at the break of day Our Saviour rose, and left his bed of clay: Awake betimes (my soul) from slumber free, And leave thou sin, before that sin leaves thee. The Spring. See how the wanton Spring In green is clad, Heark how the birds do sing, l'le not be sad: Doth not the blushing Rose Breath sweet perfume? I will my spice disclose, But not presume: The dew falls on the grass, And hastes away, Which makes me mind my glass Which will not stay: Now plants and herbs do grow In every place, Lord, let not me be slow In growth of Grace: Behold the fruitful trees And fertil ground; Observe the painful Bees, Whose hives abound; I will not barren be, Nor waste my dayes Like slaggards, that are free From vertuous wayes. The Poets Soliloquy. Why do I droop, like flowers opprest with rain? What cloud of sorrow doth my colour stain? I like a Sparrow on the house alone Do sit, and like a Dove I mourn and groan: Doth discontent, or sad affliction bind, And stop the freedom of my Nobler mind? No, no, I know the cause; I do retire, To quench old flames, and kindle better fire: It is my comfort to escape the rude And sluttish trouble of the multitude: Flowers, rivers, woods, the pleasant air and wind, With Sacred thoughts, do feed my serious mind: My active soul doth not consume with rust, I have been rub'd, and now are free from dust. Let moderation rule my pensive way; Students may leave their books, and sometimes play. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Joh. 14. 6. Via in exemplo, veritas in promisso, vita in præmio. Christ is the Way, which leads to heavens joy. He is the Truth, which errours can destroy: He is the Life, which raiseth up the dead, He is the Way, Truth, Life unlimited: The way is narrow, strive to enter in, The Truth is pure to clense our souls from sin, Ift we do walk this Way, this Truth maintain, Eernal life is ours, exempt from pain; This is the Way without all rubs of grief, This is the Truth which claims a just belief: Here is the Life which conquer'd death and sin, Truth, Life is ours, if we the way be in: The Truth informs us, and the Way doth gulde; The Life rewards us, if we constant bide. Follow this Way; embrace this Truth; desire This Life, the crown of Saints in Heavens quire. Thankfulness. Ascensus gratiarum, est descensus gratiæ In thee I have my being, live and move, Who art the King of glory, and of love: From thy rich storehouse of delight and pleasure I do receive my joy, my gifts, and treasure: Who gives me bread to strengthen me, and wine To glad my heart? who made my soul divine? Who gave me wisdom, or spiritual eyes, Good to discern from bad, and Truth from lyes? Who doth direct my ways, but thou my King, Which art the Fountain whence all vertues spring? What shall I render thee? I have no more Than what's thine own, thy riches are my store: If thou (sweet Lord) wilt not my Heart disdain, Thou gav'st it me, I give it thee again. The Holy Maid Dum fugio homines, invenio angelos; &amp; nunquam minùs sola quàm cùm sola. I am resolv'd, no fond desire Shall kindle in me Cupids fire: No amorous toyes, no wanton kiss Shall rob me of eternal bliss, I'll write, I'll read, I'll spin, I'll pray, To drive vain thoughts of Love away. A silent Cloyster, which is free From change and chance, best pleaseth me: When I do not converse with men, I speak with God, and Angels then. I will not wear a rich attire Of gold or silk, to set on fire Beholders eyes: The care I find, Most needful, is to dress my mind. No cunning Lover shall beguile, Or win me with a gift, or smile: I will accept no pretty thing, As Ribans, Gloves, a Watch, or Ring. Weak man's estate, as in a glass, Is truly seen in fading grass: The choisest Man, the fairest Rose, Will languish, and perfection lose. And yet I am in love: but where? My love ascends a higher sphere; Where honor, beauty, pleasures be Inthron'd, and full of constancie. My Beloved's white and ruddy, My red sins made him all bloody: His head is like fine gold, most free From dross, and all impurity: His gracious eyes are like Doves eyes; And in his cheeks composed lies A bed of spices and flowers sweet, Where all perfumes together meet: His mouth breathes roses; and no bliss Can equal his delicious kiss. But see, where my Beloved lies, And courts me with his dying eyes: He spreads his arms me to embrace; Who would not love so sweet a face? Rich drops of blood, like rubies fall, To ransom my poor soul from thrall: The Cross my pillow, and my bed Shall be his Grave to rest my head. All sweets are sour, all fair perfections foul, Compar'd with Christ, the Bridegroom of my soul. Come unto me all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will ease you Matthew 11. 28. Clamat Diabolus; Venite ad me, &amp; ego interficiam. Clamat Mundu's; Venite ad me, &amp; ego deficiam. Clamat Caro; Venite ad me, &amp; ego inficiam. Clamat Christus; Venite ad me, &amp; ego reficiam. Not Gilead's Balm, no Pool in Siloam, Not David's Hyssop, and no Angel can Or blessed Saint in heaven cure the soul, When sin hath made it, like a Leper, foul: Christ is our Balsom; and we have no Tree, Whose leaves do Nations heal, but only he. Our Saviours sacred blood speaks better things Than Abels blood; and greater comfort brings: Gods anger was incens'd when Abel dy'd, Our Saviours blood his anger pacifi'd: The blood of Abel did for vengeance call; Christs blood for love, and mercy to us all: Just Abels blood cry'd once, and cry'd no more; Our Saviours blood cries still; God hath in store A Sea of mercies, if we do depend On Christ our loving Bridegroom, and our Friend: He makes the lame to walk, the blind to see, The sad to sing for joy, the pris'ner free. Come all that labour: Blessed is the man, That hath some oil from this Samaritan. Come, not by strength of legs or feet, but mind; By prayers, not by steps, if rest you'll find: Mount with the wings of prayer, and ascend Gods holy hill, where pleasures never end. The Hypocrite Monumentum speciosum. The Hypocrite, his face, his words, his mind Into a thousand forms and shapes can wind: This weather-cock with every blast can turn, And he had rather change his faith, than burn: He cares not how, so he may fill his dish, He can in cleer, and troubled waters fish. He love protests, where he doth deadly hate; His words will run like oil, and break your pate. If men do hunt the Fox, he'll shout and cry, 'Tis fit the Fox, which kill'd the lambs, should die: But if the Fox sits in the chair of State, The Fox shall have his love, the Lamb his hate. If here the Turk should reign, this man alone Would sell his Bible for an Alcharon. I'll speak no more of dung; my heart is free From the base leaven of Hypocrisie. Chastity. A woman chaste, is like a Meadow fair, Enricht with pleasant flowers, and sweetest air, Then (woman) lock thy privy chamber; be A fountain seal'd, not to all comers free. If thou art rich, sell not thy self for pleasure; If thou art poor, sell not thy self for treasure. Make not thy self a Common; it is found, There's better pasture in inclosed ground. Predestination Occulta esse causa potest, injusta esse non potest. Dispute not why some Angels stood, And others fell, which were by nature good: Dispute not, wherefore God doth take and chuse Some to his grace, and others doth refuse: The potter doth of the same lump of clay Make vessels some more base, and some more gay; And shall we question Gods most secret will, Why his own creatures he doth save or kill? Who's sav'd, or damn'd, none knows: who look Into the Lords Predestination-book? The signs or symptoms which Election prove, Are lively faith, and undefiled love. I will serve God, and shake off sinful slumber, Who knows but I am of th' elected number? The Poets Condition Est Deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo. A poet, and rich? that seems to be A paradox most strange to me. A Poet, and poor? that Maxim's true, If we observe the Canting crue. What lands had Randolph, or great Ben, That plow'd much paper with his pen? Wise Chaucer, as old Records say, Had never but his length of clay: And by some men I have been told, That Cleaveland had more brains than gold. Shew me a Poet, and I'll shew thee An Emblem of rich poverty: An hundred Verses, though divine, Will never buy one pint of wine. I have a purse as free within From gold, as Heaven is from sin, And silver thinks, I do it wrong, If I imprison it too long. My purse no constant measure knows, But like the Sea it ebbs and flows; And as my purse doth rise or fall, So I do rule my senses all. When I have silver or pure gold, I am most brave, divine, and bold; And then I do not hold it fit That any should outvie m'in wit: But when these birds have taken wing, I cannot crack a jest, nor sing: All mirth and musick I detest, And mad Orlando, Mortuus est. But stay; I think no worldly gain So sweet as a Poetick vein: No grief disturbs a Poets head, No discontent frequents his bed: When riches ebb; my wits do flow, The rich are dull, and nothing know. I have a heart, I have a mind More quick in motion than the wind; And through the twelve Signs I can run By thought, more swiftly than the Sun. I know the motion of the Stars, Which are for peace, which are for wars: If I the Astrolabium take, I know their height without mistake: I know without all doubt or wonder, The cause of lightning and of thunder: What weather will be, I descry By the complexion of the sky. The vertues of each plant or tree, Of flowers and herbs, are known to me. I good and evil Angels know, And can their strength and order show: But (O my God) I know thee best, When I confess I know thee least. Thus I, when I am poor and bare, By meditations banish care. Then judge, which is the greatest curse, An empty head, or empty curse. Upon Peter Fishing. Do'st fish in the deep sea? 'tis Christs command, That thou shouldst rather fish upon dry land. Thou art a Fisher, not of fish, but men: Consider how to catch them, where, and when. He that will fish for men, the only hook Which he must use, must be the holy book: The Scripture is the net, which drags great store From Seas of troubles, to the blessed shore. To the fond Lover. ? Est forma fugax, est fæmina fallax. Be resolute, (fond youth) and free From courting her, which loves not thee: Strange passions rule a Lovers brain, Now tears, then smiles; now joy, then pain: Now hope doth rule, then black despair, Now he exclaims, then calls her fair; He sometimes doth Gods aid implore, But loves, and calls on Cælia more: No joy, no wealth, no worldly bliss, May be compar'd with Cælia's kiss: But we may seek, and find as well, Most perfect rest and ease from hell, As to derive our Paradise From any womans wanton eyes: We shall for honey look in vain From a foul nest of wasps to gain. Cælia cheats with her false treasure, Guilding pains and death with pleasure. She is a wavering, fickle toy, None is more fond, none is more coy. If thou art strange, then she is free, If free thou art, she's strange to thee; She will reject, if thou dost chuse, She will affect, if thou refuse. If thou art yce, then she is fire, Burn thou, and she will quench desire; When thou art kind, then she will frown, When thou disdain'st, she is thine own; She laughs, and weeps, she's kind, and sour, She grants, denies, all in an hour; Her bitter frowns, her sweetest smiles, Are all compos'd of snares and wiles. She paints an outward face of love, Where she will most a tyrant prove; And sometimes she pretends to hate, Where her sick soul is captivate; What she desires to scorn she fains, And seems to wish, what she disdains: Thus a poor Lover knows not well, Whether he is in heaven, or hell. Then fix thy love on Christ thy Rock, Not on a wavering Weather-cock. The Presbyterian Covenanter. The Presbyterian, as wise men may see, Hath little knowledge, less of honesty. He is both Fool, and Knave; or such another As wicked Cain was, who did kill his brother. He's lately come to England with a story Of a new Pamphlet, call'd a Directory: His Cloak is something short, his looks demure, His heart is rotten, when his words are pure, His mind is carried with a headlong tide Of self-will, worldly love, presumptuous pride. He's sick of late; a vomit may do well, Oaths, Covenants, Treasons, from his heart t'expel. In this our Land this Presbyterian brat, Like Pharaoh's lean kine, hath devour'd the fat; In Scotland he was bred, a place too wild To breed an honest, or a civil child: Let Presbyterians be to Scotland sent, I wish them no more plague; or punishment. Than pleasant flowers will in Gods garden sprout, When these unwholsom weeds are rooted out. Upon the young, most beautiful, and most ingenuous Gentlewoman, Mrs. Mary Carne, Daughter to the gallant Gentleman Mr Thomas Carne Esq; once of Bro-Castle, It is a strange and wondrous thing, To see ripe Autumn in the Spring: He scarcely lives, that ever saw Fruit the same time both ripe and raw. As strange a thing we may behold In her so young, in her so old: She is a tender Child in years, In wit a Matron she appears. Observe her growth, she is but small; Observe her wit, she is most tall Here Nature seems to rob Old age, By making Childhood, grave and sage. So cleer a Morning doth betray And speak the fairness of the day: So sweet a Bud doth well disclose We may expect a fragrant Rose. As she within is free from dross, So Nature gave her such a gloss Of gracious Beauty, that we have Nothing, except her Mind, so brave If Nature's stock were wholly spent, Here Beauty might again be lent T'enrich the world, because that she Hath Beauty's sole Monopoly: She like a lively Spring oreflows, And daily in perfection grows. The Leper. I am a filthy Leper, from my head Unto the foot, with scurf of sin o'respread: I want no art, or help to cleanse my skin, The stream may wash my body, not my sin. Lord, let the Jordan of thy grace restore My perfect health, and let me sin no more. An Epitaph upon my beloved Daughter Susanna Watkyns, who was born upon Ashwednesday, 1655. and dyed the 5. of August, 1658. Here lies a pleasant Rose, rash Death thought good To take, and crop it in the tender bud: God is a Husbandman, who doth remove His younger plants, to make them better prove. She for her mornings work shall have her pay Equal with those that labour'd all the day. Ashwednesday she was born; for her I mone, Because she is so soon to Ashes gone. Upon the most pious, and learned Work, intituled, Davids Harp strung and tuned; being a brief Analysis of Davids Psalms, with devout Prayers and Meditations on each, Psalm: Composed by that Orthodox, most learned, and excellently qualified Prelate, William Nicolson, Lord Bishop of Gloucester. VVhen David on his skilful Harp did play, Saul was refresht, the Devil fled away. Sure David with the Harp did sing a Psalm, Which did King Saul's fanatick nature calm. The Psalms are Davids Harp now plaid upon, And tun'd by Englands chief Musition. He handles Davids Harp, and playes so well, That where 'tis heard, no sad distractions dwell; With the wise Prophet, he doth well dispence By clearing, not by changing of the sence. Have you observ'd, how the laborious Bee Doth feed on flowers of all varietie, And thence pure honey doth extract, and we Receive much profit from her Treasurie? So he hath travel'd through the fruitful field Of Davids Psalms, which like rich flowers, do yield Pleasure and profit to judicious men, Who will admire the sweetness of his pen. On every Psalm each holy Meditation And Prayer, merits heavens approbation. Who meditates or prayes so well as he, From sin, from Satan, and from hell is free. Here thou may'st learn to write, and learn to pray; Here thou may'st learn to think on heavens way. Upon a most pious and learned Exposition of the Apostles Creed, by the same right reverend Father in God, William Nicolson, Lord Bishop of Gloucester. He that desires to tract the Sacred way Which leads to heaven, soon shall go astray, Uunless he hath a perfect rule or line, Safely to guide him through all paths divine. All is involved in th' Apostles Creed, Which sinners do unto salvation need: Twelve Articles of faith the Creed contains, Which are explain'd by his laborious pains. He lean'd with John, on Christs own bosome: thence He suckt deep knowledge; which he doth dispence Unto the world: to open heavens door, Use but this key, and you shall want no more. The two Books above mentioned, written by the Bishop of Gloucester, are to be sold at the Crown in Fleet-street Ambition exemplified in the Parable, Judg. 9. The trees would chuse a King: they all agree, The Olive should their King elective be. The Olive would not her rich fatness leese To be promoted over all the trees. The Vine would not be King to lose her wine, Which doth all hearts rejoice, all wits refine; The Fig-tree much did of her sweetness boast, And would not reign to have her sweetness lost. At last the Bramble doth intrude, and would (Though most unfit) the Royal Scepter hold. With vain ambition those do never swell, In whom high gifts of grace and nature dwell. Ambition spurs the bad, by some sad fate, Who many times usurp the Chair of State. To row their Boats for wind and tide they watch, And at Promotion, like the Bramble, catch. Ambition moves me not; my self I yield To be the meanest flower in all the field; Yet from preferment I'le not turn aside, Nor go on foot, when God doth bid me ride. The Conclusion. These Poems so compendious, I presume, No time, no fire, nor envy shall consume. Those Hero's writ of in this Book, shall be A President to all Posterity: Nature a short life gave them, this will give A second birth, and make them ever live.

To the Courteous Reader. The God of love made plants and herbs to give Their vertues humane nature to relieve. The meanest simple, weeds, and poisons have Some power, which our imperfections crave. To cure by Minerals is a curious Art, Herbs with less danger, vertues do impart. Behold this Looking-glass: In which thou'lt see When thou art sick, and when from sickness free. Accept of it: so small a gift (I know) Can no great bounty, but affection show. A LOOKING-GLASSE for the Sick: OR, The Causes and Symptoms, or signs of several Diseases, With their Cures and Remedies. Of the Head-ach caused by heat. This is ingender'd by the burning heat Of the warm Sun in Summer, or by great And too much exercise; the fiery flame, Anger, and hot diseases cause the same. The pain is great, strong heat afflicts the head, The skin is very dry, the eyes are red. Use but a little meat, apt to disgest, And cold in operation, fish is best From stony rivers: but you must restrain From milk or meats which fume into the brain. Oyle Omphacine with vinegar compound, Which pour'd upon the head, great ease is found. Of the Head-ach by cold. Cold causeth head-ach: some their health impair, That go bare-headed in the colder air. The head, when it is felt, no heat contains, The face is pale, the eyes do swell with pains. Hot bathes are good; the oyle of rewe is sure, Rub'd on the fore-part of the head, to cure. Of a Head-ach caused of a Plethory, or plenitude of blood. All meats and drinks, that nourish much, do breed The head-ach, if we plentifully feed, And yet neglect bathes, sweatings, vacuations, Whereby the body wanteth operations; The temple veins do beat: the urin's red And thick: sad heaviness distracts the head. The face and eyes are red: the pulse is great, And with no little vehemence doth beat. The patient must eschew reare eggs and flesh, Cold herbs are good the spirits to refresh. To let him blood is good: all wine is bad, Let him be alwayes merry, never sad. Of Head-ach caus'd by the foul Stomack. Sharp humors in the stomack oft abound, And chiefly in its mouth: from whence are found Foul vapours to ascend: the sick would fain Vomit: he feels a sharp and gnawing pain. You must now things to the head apply. To purge the stomack is the Remedy. Of Head-ach by Drunkenness. Hot wines, strong drinks, with vapours fill the brain, If that the brain be hot, the more's the pain. A vomit's very good, then sleep and rest, Amongst all medicines this is counted best. Of the Windiness of the Stomack. Phlegmatick humors we by reason find, Oft in the stomack do ingender wind. And sometimes windiness is caus'd by meat Dissolv'd to vapours through the want of heat. They that are thus diseas'd, do stretch, and swell, The pain doth in the back and belly dwell. If that the Patient's bound, a purge is good, Which may expell the flegm, and clense the blood. Boyle grains in good strong water, for I think Against all wind this is an excellent drink. The Yellow Jaundes. This sickness stops the gaul or spleen with great Combustion in the liver, and strong heat. A yellow colour of the skin and eyes, With grief doth in the spleen and liver rise. The juyce of hore-hound will afford relief, With thy own urine to expell this grief. Turmerick and Honey, Saffron well compound With Treacle, to make thy body sound. Or else the dung of Goats to powder beat, And drink't three dayes, to render health compleat. The Dropsie. The Dropsie is a water bred within Betwixt the bowels, and the render skin, Which clasps about them: which disease indeed From coldness of the liver doth proceed. The belly swells, the colour is not good, The Patient is compel'd to loath his food. With juyce of Plantain fill some pot; and bind About the pot a linnen cloth: then find And lay some ashes on the cloth: the fire It must abide, until the half expire. Drink some each morn: This hath been known and seen To cure the watrish Dropsie, and the Spleen. Of the Stone in the reins of the Bladder. Some gross and naughty humors putrifie Within the bladder, which great heat doth dry. Small gravel in the urine you may find, Pains in the bladder to afflict the mind. Anoint the yard with Fox-blood, and the stone Will soon dissolve: this is a practice known. Nine Ivy berries in warm wine receive. This drink the Patient never did deceive. Beat Snails to powder: or few egg-shells dry'd, Powder'd, and drunk, have bin thought good, and try'd. Of Garlick seeth some seven heads, or more, To break the stone, and perfect health restore. The Strangury. Ulcers within the Bladder this begets, Or some Apostume, which the urine frets, The urine at the yard will drop: and wish You may with strong desire, but cannot piss. The Radish root in white wine seeth or steep, If thou thy body from this grief wilt keep; Some Filbirts stampt, and drunk, the grievous pains Will cure, which in the bladder be, or reins. The Gout. Surfet and Drunkenness breeds this foul disease, And use of women doth the same increase, Long standing brings it too: and boystrous wayes Of too much exercise, and youthful playes. This doth great pains to joynts, and swellings bring, In time of harvest chiefly, and the Spring. Some Plantain leaves being plaistred with fresh greace, Bring down the swollen gout, and grief appease. Figs, honey, bread, and also mustard-seed With vinegar compounded, help your need: Pitch, Salt Armoniack mingle well, and stamp, 'Tis excellent good to cure a grievous cramp. The Ague called Ephymera, which endureth one day. Unnatural heat the vital parts doth fret, Which anger, watching, drunkenness may beget. A feverish heat it to the body sends, Which in a fainty sweat or vapour ends. For Agues tale a vomit: or a quart Of Sack will cure thee, and rejoice the heart. To cure the heat, juyce of Cucumber's best, With oyle of Roses: smear the pulse and breast [Abundance the foul body doth contain] A continual Ague. Abundance the foul body doth contain Of humors putrifi'd in every vein. The Patient suffers constant heat and pains, And, till the fever ends, no respit gains. Some Colewort-leaves, with oil of Roses take, And for the stomack this a plaister make: Drink in warm water the herb Pimpernel, This cures a Fever, as Physicians tell. The Carbuncle. Gross and hot blood residing in some place, An Ulcer, or a painful Bile doth cause. Rue, Nuts, and Honey stamp; this plaister will Cure all Carbuncles, and Apostumes kill. A Quartain Fever. This Melancholy breeds; which putrified, To divers parts of sickly men doth slide: The weary Patient two good days enjoys, But on the third a sore fit him annoys. Take Rue-leaves, Pepper, Honey, mingle these, The bigness of a Chess-nut will give ease: Two hours before the fit, that compound give, To cure the fever, nature to relieve. Use Almond-milk in fevers; and all say 'Tis good to use sweet clarified whay. The Lethargy. This sickness, like some drowsie, heavy pain, Fills with corrupted flegm and cold, the brain: Such often sleep; all wit and judgment's gone, And they forget what they have spoke or done. Use Vinegar and Oil, Red Mint, and Rew Unto the nose, the spirits to renew: Or you may burn the skin of any Hare, The ashes drunk with Calament is rare. The Phrensie. Cholet the Phrensie, and much blood maintains, Heating the head, and filling up the brains. A constant Fever frantick patients have, They love to watch, and seldom rest do crave: When they awake, they use to rore and cry, But can afford not any reason why. If Blood's the cause, to laugh they will delight If Choler be the cause, they braul and fight. With Plantan-juyce the temples first anoint, A Cap of Terebentine wax I then appoint, With womans milk: which wrapt about the head, Will give the Patient rest within his bed: Let blood in that same vein, which, as I guess, The middle of the forehead doth possess. The Turn, or Dazeling in the head. Some vap'rous Exhalations do arise From the foul stomack, and the brains surprise: The Patient thinketh, that all things go round, And oftentimes he falleth to the ground. The pith of Bread bak'd with Coriander seed Laid to the head, is good to help thy need: Take Opium, Saffron, Roses, and all these With Vinegar mix, which plaister bringeth ease. Too much Watching. Great store of choler, dryness in the brain, Doth watching cause, and wonted sleep retain. The seed of Mustard bruis'd, laid to the head Hot, cures she pains, and makes a quiet bed. Some Poppy-juyce, and oil of Roses take; These mixt, will make him sleep, that keeps awake. [Gross, slimy humors do possess the brain] The Falling-Sickness. Gross, slimy humors do possess the brain, The lively spirits no free passage gain: The Patient at the mouth will foam, and fall As if he dy'd, and lost his senses all. Burn any dead man's skull, the ashes take In drink; this sickness shall you soon forsake. If you desire to cure this evil, tye About your neck the root of Piony. The Pain in the Ears. Who rides, or travels in cold storms or wind, Grief in the ears, and mighty pains shall find. Hot Inflammations may the Ears withhold: So the Disease proceeds from heat, or cold. Stamp Emmets eggs, Earth-worms, and leaves of Rue In oil; which strain'd, the Hearing will renue: The juyce of Onion will afford relief, With Womans milk, and much asswage the grief. But in hot causes, to procure some rest, Cold Lettice made in plaister, is the best. The Fistula. Corrupt, sharp humors in some members shall Cause a deep Ulcer, narrow, and hard withall. Goats dung with honey mixt, the hollow place Fill with the same; it cures in little space. Take this Receipt; Put Leaven in strong Lye, And to the Fistula the same apply. The Scabs, Pox, and Leprosie. Gross, filthy humors, mixt with matter thin And very sharp, do these diseases bring: The hair will fall, and outward scabs appear; The Patient's not from pain, or itching clear. Take Oil, and Aloes, and unquenched Lime, An ointment make to cure in little time: Take oil of Bays, white Wax, white Frankincense, Quick-silver mixt with spittle, Hogs fat cleanse, Bay-salt, and Plantain-juice: then mingle these, To cure the Pox, the Scab, or Foul disease. The Falling of the Hair. Vicious and naughty humors do impair, And quickly may corrupt the roots of hair: If th' head wants moisture, and the skin be rare, The hair forsakes the head, and leaves it bare. Burn some Goats dung; the ashes will repair, If it be mixt with oil, the falling hair. Seeth Mallow-root in water; wash thy head In this against the scurff, and thou hast sped. The Morphew. The gross and slimy blood becomes like cream, And turns to Melancholick, and white Fleam. If you'll discern this sickness, notice take, The skin is spotted like a various snake. Sheeps liver newly kill'd, warm on the face, Revives the colour, and all spots doth chase: Anoint thy face all over with Bulls blood, To make one fair it is held wondrous good. The Tooth-ach. Great store of humors from the head do fall Unto the gums; the pains are known to all. Bruise the wild Poppy-seed, and put the meal Within thy hollow tooth, thy grief to heal: Stamp cloves of Garlick, tie them to thy arm, Against the Tooth-ach 'tis a present charm: With Crows dung fill the hollow tooth, and it Will break the tooth, and ease thy grievous fit. The Palsie. Paralisis. Foul and gross humors to the sinews flow, The members neither sense nor motion know. The Patient with oyle benedict anoint, Use ointments hot to supple every joint. Take the Fox skin, apply it hot: the grief It will asswage, and yield thee much relief. The Squinacy. Excess of filthy blood and choler float, And draw unto the muscles of the throat. The Patient's mouth is open, eyes are red, He cannot draw his breath, nor swallow bread. A Dogs toord with Oak-apples plaister-wise, Is for the throat the best you can devise. In a new earthen pot old Swallows burn, Honey and powder mix to serve your turn, Then with a quilt convey it down the throat, It is a perfect cure, as divers note. Fresh Hysop boyl'd in vinegar, is good To gargarise, as I have understood. Cough, or Hoarsness. Cold humors to the wind-pipe dropping rain Down from the head, which do the cough maintain. Some rosted nuts with honey stampt, is sure A long continued cough to heal and cure: If rume doth drop, and liver putrifie, Unto the head, being shaven, this apply. Some mustard lay upon the shaven place, The rume will dry within a little space. Plurisie. From much hot blood this bad disease comes in, Which hath recourse unto the tender skin About the ribs: the Patient must abide Hard breathing, fever, pricking in the side. To be let blood, I hold the safest way, The danger may be great, if you delay. It is conceived, that the herb of grace Receiv'd in drink, will cure the grieved place. Costiveness. Too much, or want of exercise, will bind, And we do certain meats restrictive find. Steep Jallop in good white wine over night. This drink will loose, and make disgestion light. Sod Mallow roots, and stampt with old hogs greace, And Bran laid to the Navil, will give ease. Stomp sodden Savine with hogs greace, and then Anoint the Navil, to cure costive men. The Flux. Excess of cold, or too much fruit to eat, Begets a Flux, so doth excess of heat. A Dog that eateth bones, will give thee a toord To bind the belly, take it on my word. Coriander seed being drunk, and acorns bind, Restrictive vertue in old Cheese we find. Cowes milk with Iron sodden, or a stone, Is for the Flux the truest Physick known. The Cholick. Some gross and slimy humors, or the wind Contained in the guts, the cause we find. Meats raw, and meats corrupt, but chiefly fat, And cold drink after heat engender that. The Cholick in the belly causeth pain With griefs: the Patient doth his meat disdain. Take grains, and beat them small, then boyle them well In Aqua vitæ, wind if you'l expell, Old dung of beasts with frying oyle apply Vnto your side, all pains to mortifie: March Mallows boyl'd in water three dayes, Grief in the bowels without doubt allayes. The Worms in the Belly. Corrupted fleam doth in the bowels seat; Pains vex the belly, and desire to eat. Boyle Garlick in your milk, which you must drink Or else some Brimstone: both will cure, I think. But Aloes Cicatrina, is the best To kill the Worms, and give the Patient rest. The Hemerrhoides. The liver doth contain unwholsome blood, And Melancholick, which is never good. Of this disease if you the Symptomes need, The fundamental veins break forth and bleed. Ceruse, burnt Lead, and Oyle of Roses tale With yolks of rosted eggs; a plaister male: The seed of Annise burnt with honey, lay Unto the grief, the Flux, and pain to stay. The Oppilation of the Liver. There some Apostume, or bad humors bide, The face ill-colour'd, pains in the right side. Savery, and Annise, Sage, and Fennel take With Goats dung: of these mixt a plaister make: Than Agarick, Sence, and Vermilion give To ope the pipes, and Nature to relive. The Inflation of the Cods. Humors deriv'd from too much cold or heat, Fall to the Cods, and cause inflations great. Goats dung dissolv'd with Wine, will take away The swelling of the Cods, and pains allay. The Juyce of Wallwort, common oyle, bean flowers These temper well: they have an active power. The Mother. Excess of humors stop the flowers: the seed Within the Matrix may corruption breed. Cramps in the legs, and weakness in the feet, Pale colour, sadness in the Patient meet. In strong hot Wine, Cloves, Garlick, Treacle take, The Moder than the Patient will forsake. Rue sod in oyle, and stampt, will soon relieve, With Hen, and Goose-grease, where the sore doth grieve. The swelling of the Paps. Hot blood, and also hardned blood maintains The swellings in the Paps, and grievous pains. Take Mallows stamp, and hot, if breasts do swell With common oyle; this plaister makes them well If there be hollow ulcers in the breast, Goats dung with honey, I esteem the best. Use Brimstone stampt with Wine, a plaister make, All hardness will the painful breasts forsake. The Consumption. Foul humors do descend: thin and sharp rume Fall from the head, and doth the Lungs consume. Short cough, short breath, and faintness, never cease To be companions of this sad disease. Use for thy constant drink, strong, pleasant Ale Warm'd by the fire, which shall thy strength recall. Resort to merry men, that love thee well, And pray to God all discontents t'expell. I know more cures for it; but I protest, Amongst them all I censure this the best. Warts. All Warts, as I have rightly understood, Proceed from gross and melancholick blood. Arsnick on Warts with vinegar apply'd, Consume them all: this hath been often try'd. The rind of Sallow burnt, and temper'd well With Vinegar, all Warts and Scabs expell. For the Bleeding at the Nose. The bleeding of the Nose from heat doth flow, From too much blood, and sometimes from a blow. The Herb of Grace put to the nose, is good To stop, and safely to restrain the blood. Blood burnt to powder, blown into the nose, Doth stanch the flowing blood, and wounds doth close. Burn Frog or Toad; the ashes then apply Unto the place which bleeds: This vertue try. Of the Pains in the Lights. Rheume, heat and dryness, on salt meats to feed, Or drinking too much wine, this pain doth breed: Pains in the left side, shortness of the wind, And cough to follow this disease we find. Take gum Arabick, Dragant, Frankincense, Make pills with Honey, and with these dispense. Against great desire to Fleshly lust. The use of active wine, delicious meat, Inflames the mind with Cupidineous heat, Camphire dissolve in oil; this ointment may, Rubb'd on the yard, all lustful actions stay. Against spitting of Blood. This from some bruise, or from a broken vein Proceeds, as best Physitians do maintain. Seeth some dry Figs fill'd up with Mustard seed, In White wine, and at night on those figs feed: And drink the Wine; for this will mundifie, And from the stoppage of the Liver free. To draw out Thorns or Splinters, or any thing which sticketh in the body. Some Sothern-wood compound with wholsom grease, To draw out thorns or iron, if you please. The pain in Child-birth. Give Mirrh to drink in wine a little warm, Big as a nut, this will prevent much harm. The juyce of Parsley in some drink is good, To cleanse the Matrix, and to purge the blood. Certain Rules to know the disposition of the Body by the Urine or Complexion. The sight of Urine and Complexion, shews Where each Disease is seated, whence it flows. Into four parts the the Urine we divide, Which do our reason and our judgment guide. The first the Circle is, which floats above; By this, what pains lie in the Head, we prove. The second part under this Circle lies, The pain of Breast and Lungs which signifies. And the third part the middle doth possess, Which doth the Stomach, Liver, Milt express. The fourth part is the bottom, which doth tell What pains in Kidnies, Guts, and Bladder dwell. When any of these four parts mixed be With other matters by contingencie; We then perceive wherein the chiefest harm Or grief consists: We use the Urine warm, Or fresh the morning. 'Tis a rule for all, Safely to close, or stop the Urinal: The Urine else will thicken and divide, And must again by fire be rectifi'd. When th' Urine's red, and thick, 't's understood The Patient's body's hot, and full of blood: The best Physitians wisely do relate, And his complexion Sanguine nominate. When th' Urines red, and thin seems to the eye, The Patient's body is both hot and dry: We Cholerick do this complexion call, Whose foul disease proceedeth from the gall: When th' Urine's white and thick, I truly hold The Patient is by nature moist and cold: He's Flegmatick; for we by reason know, From watry humors his diseases flow, But when the Urine is both thin, and white, The Patient's cold and dry; and takes delight In no companion; but his constant folly Doth make him subject unto Melancholy: His blood by nature like the earth is dull, His face is pale, his heart of sadness full. When the Urine yellow, like the purest gold, Digestion's good, and perfect then we hold. If th' Urine doth like watry blood appear, Or else like Saffron, or the flames of fire; These colours in sick bodies do foretell Heat in the Liver, and hot Fevers dwell: But that burnt moisture shews, which like red wine, Or red earth doth to heaviness incline. When th' Urine looks like Ashes, or like Lead, Some grievous sickness in the body's bred. A deadly sickness I did oft foresee By Urine, which is black as coal may be: Black Urine doth proceed, as I presume, From burning heat, which nature doth consume: Black Urine shews the Milt is stopt, and then The Yellow-Jaundise will endanger men. The Urine pale, wherein white sands we spy, Doth in the Bladder the Stone signifie. When th' Urines thick and fat, but red the sand, The cruel Stone the Kidnies doth command. When th' Urine's pale, with scum and fome, we find The head is moist, the belly full of wind. Urine like milk, which comes but little out, Foreshews the sickness which we call the gout. When th' Urine's subtile, or like water thin, Pains in the Milt, or Dropsie may begin. The Urine red, with pibbles or with bells, Upon the breast some foul Imposthume tells: The Urine, which is in hot Fevers green, Deadly by reason of too much heat hath been. If th' Urine looks like Lead, when that a dry Consumption holds the Patient, he will die. When that a swimming cloud is found or known In womans Urine driving up and down, And mixt with shells; this symptom ne'r beguil'd, But plainly shews, that woman is with child. FINIS.</field>
