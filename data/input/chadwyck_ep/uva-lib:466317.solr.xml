      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I MEMOIR TO JOSEPH AND ALICE BARNES. I My dear, dear friends, my heart yearns forth to you In very many of its lonely hours; Not sweetlier comes the balm of evening dew To all-day-drooping in fierce sunlight flowers, Than to this weary withered heart of mine The tender memories, the moonlight dreams Which make your home an ever-sacred shrine, And show your features lit with heavenly gleams. I have with some most noble friends been blest; I wage no quarrel with my human kin,— Knowing my misery comes from my own breast, At war with Fate by chance and God by sin: But of all living friends you claim in me The love most sanctified by memory. II When too, too conscious of its solitude, My heart plains weakly as a widowed dove, The forms of certain women sweet and good, Whom I have known and loved with reverent love, Rise up before me; then my heart grows great With tearful gratitude, and no more pines. You lovely souls that fitly consecrate The whiteness of your alabaster shrines! You tender lives of purest good, that leaven The monstrous evils of our mortal birth! There are no female angels up in Heaven, Because they all are women here on earth: As once God's sons, God's daughters now come down, But these to share, not lose, the heavenly crown. III Of all these women fair and wise and good, Of all save only her who died so young, Thou art in this angelic womanhood, Whose solemn praises bards have seldom sung, Supreme to me—most lovely and most pure, O second mother of my orphaned youth: Thou patient heart to suffer and endure, Thou placid soul to mirror heavenly truth, Thou gracious presence wheresoe'er you go To gladden pleasure, or to chasten strife, Thou gentlest friend to sympathise with woe, Thou perfect mother and most perfect wife, Whose priceless goodness shed on worthless me Makes gratitude itself half agony. IV A man of genial heart and liberal mind, A man most rich in that rare common-sense, Whose common absence in its name we find; A man of nature scorning all pretence, And honest to the core, yet void of pride Whose vice upon that virtue most attends; A man of joyous humour, unallied With malice, never making foes but friends; As such all know you, knowing you at all: But I, dear Guide and Teacher of my youth, When deeply shamed, yet strengthened, I recall Your goodness, patience, constant loyal truth In love for one whose life's a long defeat, Say—Souls like this keep human nature sweet. V When I trace back from this my death-in-life, Through years of sensual sin and nerveless sloth, And weary thought with Earth and Heaven at strife, And dull decay preventing natural growth:— Trace back until that period I attain When still stirred in me living seeds of good— Some faith in soul; some active power in brain, Some love in heart, some hopefulness in mood; I always reach at last that little room Wherein we lived a life so sweet and mild, When he who now lies sleeping in the tomb Was but an infant, and your only child: The happy child! thus saved, still pure in soul, From our false world of sin and strife and dole. VI Indeed you set me in a happy place, Dear for itself and dearer much for you, And dearest still for one life-crowning grace— Dearest, though infinitely saddest too: For there my own Good Angel took my hand, And filled my soul with glory of her eyes, And led me through the love-lit Faerie Land Which joins our common world to Paradise. How soon, how soon, God called her from my side, Back to her own celestial sphere of day! And ever since she ceased to be my Guide, I reel and stumble on life's solemn way; Ah, ever since her eyes withdrew their light, I wander lost in blackest stormy night. VANE'S STORY Prologue. This is the story (To God be the glory!) Which Vane, found in bed When a splash of fierce red From the sunset made strange The street's opposite range, Told me; who, astonished, Had firstly admonished, Then asked him outright, “On the spree all last night?” Pale looked he, and queer; But his speech calm and clear, And his voice, sweet and strong, So swayed me ere long, That I almost or quite Believed him that night. He named not the hall Where he went to the ball; Of his friends I could trace None who knew of the case, Nor the Jones, nor the Brown— There are myriads in town! The landlord avows He went out with his spouse After tea; slept at Bow, At her sister's. And so, Shall we trust Vane? or deem Him the dupe of a dream? Let who will decide. The next week he died, And thus ended his story. (To God be the glory!) The Story. One flamelet flickered to and fro Above the clear vermilion glow; The house was silent, and the street Deserted by all echoing feet; And that small restless tongue of light Possest my ear and mocked my sight, While drowsy, happy, warm, I lay This couch was sofa and not bed.Upon the couch at close of day, And drowsy, dreamy, more and more, I floated from the twilight shore Over the vague vast sea of sleep, Just conscious of the rest so deep; Not sinking to the under caves, But rocking on the surface waves. When fitfully some muffled sound Came from the crowded streets around, It brought no thought of restless life With wakeful care and passionate strife; But seemed the booming of a bell Sweetly ringing tumult's knell, Slowly chiming far away The euthanasia of the day. And then unsummoned by my will Came floating through this mood so still The scenes of all my life's past range, In perfect pictures, fair and strange, As flowers limned in purest light Upon a background such as might Expand beneath some forest-screen After the sunset, goldbrowngreen. And then I heard on every side The shadowy rustling slow and wide Of night's dim curtains softly drawn To hush the world asleep till dawn. I heard the rustling, and my eyes Were curtained with the curtained skies; And I lay wrapt as in a fleece Of warmth and purity and peace; While consciousness within the stream Of rippling thought and shadowy dream Sank slowly to the deepest deep, Lured by the murmuring Siren, sleep; When suddenly a little thrill Of splendour pricked both mind and will, And brought me tidings grand and strange; I did not stir with outward change, But felt with inward royal mirth, On all this dusk of heaven and earth The moon may rise or not to-night; But in my soul she rises bright! The globe of glory swelling rose In mighty pulses, solemn throes; And filled and overfilled me soon With light and music, with the swoon Of too much rapture and amaze, A murmurous hush, a luminous haze. How long in this sweet swoon I lay, What hours or years, I cannot say; Vast arcs of the celestial sphere Subtend such little angles here. But after the ineffable, This first I can remember well: A Rose of Heaven, so dewy-sweet Its fragrance was a soul complete, Came, touched my brow, caressed my lips, And then my eyes in their eclipse; And still I stirred not, though there came A wine of fire through all my frame, An ecstasy of joy and love, A vision of the throne above, A myriad-voiced triumphant psalm Upswelling through a splendour calm; Then suddenly, as if a door Were shut, veiled silence as before. The sweetest voice said, “True it is! He does not waken at my kiss!” I smiled: “Your kisses three and four Just gave me Heaven, no less, no more; I held me still, eyes shut, lest bliss Should overflow and waste a kiss.” Then dreamily my lids I raised, And with grand joy, small wonder, gazed, Although the miracle I saw Might well have made me wan with awe. “Why have you left your golden hair, These gorgeous dusky braids to wear? Why have you left your azure eyes, To gaze through deep dark mysteries? Why have you left your robe of white, And come in cloudy lace bedight? Or did you think that I could fail To know you through whatever veil? As bird or beast, as fish or worm, In fiendish or angelic form, As flower or tree, as wave or stone, Be sure I recognise My Own!” The sweet sad voice was sad no more, But sweeter, tenderer, than before; “Oh, ask no questions yet,” said she, “But answer me, but answer me. “I now have listened very long To catch some notes of that great song Your youth began to sing so well; Oh, why have none yet reached me? tell!” “And why is any lamp not bright, With no more oil to feed its light? Why does a robe moth-eaten fade When she is gone whom it arrayed? Great songs must pulse with lifeful breath, No hymns mark time for timeless death; One long keen wail above the bier, Then smothered moans, then stillness drear.” “I long have listened, all aflame, For some full echoes of the fame Youth pledged ripe manhood to achieve: Why must I, hearing none, still grieve?” “And why should he who cannot spend Not make of gold his life's chief end? O Love, the jewels of renown, So priceless in a monarch's crown, What are they when his realm is lost, And he must wander like a ghost Alone through wilds of rocky dearth, But pretty pebbles nothing worth? And would you have our love's proclaim In shouts and trumpet-peals of fame; Or whispered as I whisper here, Into this little pink-shell ear Still full of echoes from the sea Of fathomless Eternity?” “I do not seek thy fame because Enamoured of the world's applause, Though even its most reckless shout Involves some true love-praise no doubt: But, Dearest, when fame's trumpets blare Great hearts are battling with despair: Better the tumult of the strife Than stillness of lone-wasting life. If you were working out God's will, Could all the air around be still?” “But I am working out God's will Alike when active and when still; And work we good or work we ill, We never work against His will. . . . All work, work, work! Why must we toil For ever in the hot turmoil? God wrought six days, and formed the world; Then on the seventh His power refurled, And felt so happy that He blest That Sabbath day above the rest; And afterwards, we read, He cursed The work He thought so good at first; And surely Earth and Heaven evince That He has done but little since. The last chapter of George Sand's Lélia may seem to be the source of the following section: in fact, however, I chanced to read that work just after, and not before, this section was written.“Well, I, who am a puny man, And not a God who all things can, Have also worked: not six short days Of work refulgent with self-praise, Of work ‘all-good,’ whose end was blest With infinite eternal rest: No, I have worked life after life Of sorrow, sufferance and strife, So many ages, that I ask To rest one lifetime from the task, To spend these years (forlorn of thee) Sequestered in passivity; Observing all things God hath made, And of no ugliest truth afraid, But having leisure time enough To look at both sides of the stuff. . . . With Shelley to his ocean-doom, With Dante to his alien tomb; With Wallace, Raleigh, Sidney, Vane, All to the axe's bloody stain; With Socrates until the cup Of hemlock lifted calmly up, With Jesus to the fatal tree After the garden's agony, With Mohammed in flight and fight, With Burns in all his fate's deep night, With Joan to the fiery screen, With Charlotte to the guillotine, With Campanella all the while And Tasso in their dungeons vile, With Swift slow-dying from the top, With Rabelais to the curtain's drop, Cervantes prisoner and slave, Columbus on the unknown wave, And Luther through his lifelong war; With these, and with how many more, Since poor Eve fell, and as she fell Of course pulled Adam down as well,— In these, and in how many more, Have I outbattled life's stern war, Endured all hardships, toiled and fought, Oppressed, sore-wounded, and distraught, While inwardly consumed with thought; How long! how long!—Mankind no whit The better for the whole of it! And I, look at me, do I need The little rest I claim, indeed, With body dwindled, brain outworn, Soul's pith dried up, and heart forlorn? . . . And so I rest me, half-content That all my active power is spent: No new campaign till after cure! Meanwhile I passively endure The wounds bequeathed by so much strife, The hopelessness of present life: And this is much; what further can Be looked for from a wreck of man? I bear in silence and alone What maddened me at first, I own.” “The wounds bequeathed by so much strife, The hopelessness of present life.” She dwelt upon these words again With such a look of wistful pain As made my heart all creep and stir With pity, not for self, for her. “O my true love!” she said (the while Her poor lips sought and failed to smile), “O love! your laugh is like a knell; Your phantasy is horrible, Thus calmly plunged a glittering knife Into the core of your own life!” And there she broke down; all the grief, Love, pity powerless for relief, Yearning to suffer in my stead, Revulsion against fatal dread, Long swelling mighty in her soul O'erflooded now beyond control. She gave a little laughing cry, Choked sharply off; then heavily Flung herself down upon my breast With passionate weeping unreprest; A night-dark cloud upon some bleak And thunder-furrowed mountain peak Pouring itself in rain and fire; For now through all the black attire Heaving about her heaving frame Fermented flashes of swift flame; Not tempest-lightnings, but indeed Auroral splendours such as speed Battling with gloom before the day, And herald its triumphant sway. Her instincts in that mighty hour Of insurrection grasped at power; And her true self arrayed in light, Azure and golden, dazzling-bright, Was struggling through the mask of night. The mask remained,—for some good cause Well emphasised by Heavenly laws; She sobbed herself to self-control, Represt the heavings of her soul; Then stood up, pallid, faint, distraught, Facing some phantom of dread thought. “Another spasm like this,” I said, “Will kill me! When we both are dead I'll use my very first new breath To thank you for the blissful death, The torture-rapture utterless, You dear life-giving murderess!” I laughed; and yet the while I gazed Upon her standing wan and dazed: Would I had bitten out my tongue Ere any word of mine had stung With such an unforeboded smart That purest and most loving heart! “And do you never kneel and pray For comfort on your lonely way? And have you no firm trust in God To lighten your so-heavy load?” The voice how strange and sad! the mien How troubled from its pure serene! “You good Child! I beseech no more That one and one may make up four, When one and one are my assets And four the total of my debts: Nor do I now with fervour pray To cast no shadow in broad day: Nor even ask (as I asked once) That laws sustaining worlds and suns In their eternal path should be Suspended, that to pleasure me Some flower I love,—now drooping dead, May be empowered to lift its head.” “Ah, good pure souls have told me how You laughed at prayer as you laugh now, And turned all holy things to mirth, And made a mock of heaven and earth; And sometimes seemed to have no faith In God, in true life after death.” “But God exists, or not, indeed, Quite irrespective of our creed; We live, or live not, after death, Alike whatever be our faith; And not a single truth, in brief, Is modified by our belief. And if God does subsist and act, Though some men cannot learn the fact, Who but Himself has made mankind, Alike the seërs and the blind? It may be that for some good cause He loves to rest deep-veiled in laws; And better likes us who don't ask Or seek to get behind the mask, Than those our fellow-insect fry Who creep and hop and itch and pry, The Godhead's lice, the swarming fleas In Jove's great bed of slumbrous ease?” “They said you scorned all wise restraints, And loved the sinners, not the saints; And mocking these, still dwelt with those The friends who are the worst of foes.” “They told you something like the truth, These dear tale-bearers full of ruth. How proffer mere coarse human love To hearts sole-set on things above? And furthermore, although of old Wolves ravaged dreadfully the fold, Yet now Christ's tender lambs indeed Securely frisk, unstinted feed. To us poor goats they freely give The dreariest tracts, but they—they live In pastures green, by rivers clear, Quite sleek and happy even here: And when these lambs that frisk and leap Are all staid, stout, and well-clothed sheep, The shepherd, having taken stock, Will lead away the whole white flock To bleat and batten in galore Of Heavenly clover evermore! The dear saints want no earthly friend, Having their Jesus: but, perpend; What of the wild goats? what of us, A hundred times more numerous, Poor devils, starving wretched here On barren tracts and wild rocks drear, And in the next life (as they tell) Roasted eternally in Hell?” “But when you join the multitude Of sinners, is it for their good; To hale them from the slough of sin, Or but to plunge your own soul in?” “And what they are, must I not be? The dear Lord made them Who made me? If God did make us, this is sure, We all are brothers, vile and pure. I've known some brilliant saints who spent Their lives absorbed in one intent, Salvation each of his own soul; The race they ran had just one goal, And just one modest little prize, A wicket gate in Paradise, A sneaking-in there through the wall To bliss eternal; that was all. Some of them thought this bliss would too Be spiced by the contrasting view Of Hell beneath them surging crammed With all the tortures of the damned. Their alms were loans to poor God lent, Interest infinity-per-cent., (And God must be hard-up indeed If of such loans He stands in need); Their earnest prayers were coward cries, Their holy doctrines blasphemies; Their faith, hope, love, no more, no less, Than sublimated selfishness. “Now my gross, earthly, human heart With man and not with God takes part; With men, however vile, and not With seraphim I cast my lot: With those poor ruffian thieves, too strong To starve amidst our social wrong, And yet too weak to wait and earn Dry bread by honest labour stern; With those poor harlots steeping sin And shame and woe in vitriol-gin: Shall these, so hardly dealt with here, Be worse off in a future sphere; And I, a well-fed lounger, seek To ‘cut’ them dead, to cringe and sneak Into that bland beau monde the sky, Whose upper circles are so high? . . If any human soul at all Must die the second death, must fall Into that gulph of quenchless flame Which keeps its victims still the same, Unpurified as unconsumed, To everlasting torments doomed; Then I give God my scorn and hate, And turning back from Heaven's gate (Suppose me got there!) bow, Adieu! Almighty Devil, damn me too! This was written before Mr. J. S. Mill published a similar declaration. It will be noticed, however, that while the philosopher treated the matter with his habitual lofty earnestness, the flippant rhymester but makes it a subject for mockery and laughter.” As lightnings from dusk summer skies, Mirth dazzled from her brow and eyes; A charming chiming silvery laughter Accompanied my speech, and after Still tinkled when the speech was done Its symphony of faëry fun: And then her lips superbly smiled. “You are the child, the naughty child, Screaming and kicking on its back, And choking with convulsions black, At these old-bogey tales of Hell Its hard-pressed priestly nurses tell!” And gaylier, sweetlier yet she laughed, Till I was drunken, dizzy, daft. “You wicked holy one!” I cried, “You changeling seraph! you black-eyed Black-hearted scoffer! Heaven itself Has only made you worse, mad elf, Well, I confess that I deserve Your arrowy laugh, your lip's grand curve, For foaming out in such a rage Of boyish nonsense at my age, Anent this stupid Hell and Heaven Some half-believe one day in seven. Let all who stickle for a Hell Have it; they deserve it well. . . . Not often in these latter years Am I, my darling, moved to tears, Or joyous laughter or hot scorn, While plodding to the quiet bourne; 'Tis you have brought me back a part Of my old youthful passionate heart.” “And do you feel no bitter grief Of penitence for unbelief? No stings of venomous remorse In tracing backward to its source This wicked godless lifetime's course?” “I half remember, years ago, Fits of despair that maddened woe, Frantic remorse, intense self-scorn, And yearnings harder to be borne Of utter loneliness forlorn; What passionate secret prayers I prayed! What futile firm resolves I made! As well a thorn might pray to be Transformed into an olive-tree; As well a weevil might determine To grow a farmer hating vermin; The I am that I am of God Defines no less a worm or clod. My penitence was honest guile; My inmost being all the while Was laughing in a patient mood At this externe solicitude, Was waiting laughing till once more I should be sane as heretofore; And in the pauses of the fits That rent my heart and scared my wits, Its pleasant mockery whispered through, Oh, what can Saadi have to do With penitence? and what can you? Are Shiraz roses wreathed with rue? “Now tell me, ere once more we turn To things which us alone concern, Of all the prosperous saints you see Has none a kindly word for me?” “First Shelley, parting for above, Left you a greeting full of love.” “The burning Seraph of the Throne! Not for my worship deep and lone Of him, but for my love of you, He loves and greets me; in his view I stand all great and glorified, The bridegroom worthy of the bride For whom the purest soul in Heaven Might wait and serve long lifetimes seven, And other seven when these were past, Nor deem the service long at last, Though after all he failed for ever In his magnificent endeavour.” “Then that dear Friend of yours, who came Uncouthly shrinking, full of shame, Hopeless and desolate, at first, Dismayed that he was not accurst; But when his essence shone out clear Was found the noblest of our sphere; Beautiful, faithful, valiant, wise, With tenderest love that may suffice When once with equal power unfurled To sway and bless a whole bad world: Is it for my own sake that he Bows down, Sir, half-adoring me?” “The great deep heart of purest gold, Ever o'erflowing as of old From the eternal source divine With Heaven's most rich and cordial wine! Enough: the loneliest on earth, Famishing in affection's dearth, Who found but two such friends above Would banquet evermore on love.” “Now ask me what you wish to ask; Your slave is eager for her task.” “Then, firstly, I, who never mix With our vile nether politics, Have also ceased for many years To study those of your high spheres. Who now is, under God and Fate, The Steward of the world-estate, The Grand Vizier, Prime Minister, Or (if you will) sole Manager Of this bewildering Pantomime Whose scenes and acts fill Space and Time?” “I have heard many and many a name; The laws seem evermore the same, The operation of the laws Reveals no variance in the cause.” “A learned politician, you! Well, any name perchance will do; And we will take an old one, say That Demiurgos still bears sway. I want a prayer to reach his throne, And you can bear it, you alone; For neither God nor fiend nor man (Nay, scarcely any woman) can Resist that voice of tenderest pleading, Or turn away from it unheeding. Not in this mystic mask of night, But in your dazzling noonday light; Not with this silent storm of hair, But crowned with sunbeams you shall fare, Not with these darkest Delphian eyes, But with your luminous azure skies; For powers of solemn awe and gloom Love loveliness and joy and bloom. Only your voice you must not change; It is not, where all else is, strange; The sweetest voice in all the world, The soul of cosmic music furled In such a little slender sound, Delighting in its golden bound; The evening star of melody, The morning star of harmony; When I can catch its faintest tone In sighing breeze, in dim wave's moan, I feel you near, my Love, my Own.” “And who shall guide me to the throne Whose place is unto all unknown?” “By one at least the path is known: Prometheus Unbound, act ii., scene 3, et seq. To Demogorgon's awful throne, Down, down, through all the mysteries He led the Oceanides: Where Demogorgon dwelleth deep There Demiurgos watch doth keep, Though Vesta sleeps æonian sleep: Shelley himself shall be your guide, Since I must still on earth abide: Down, down, into the deepest deep; Down, down, and through the shade of sleep; Down, down, beyond the cloudy strife Of interwoven death and life; Down, down, unto the central gloom Whose darkness radiates through the tomb And fills the universal womb. “Then he shall leave thee lonely there, And thou shalt kneel and make thy prayer, A childish prayer for simple boon: That soon and soon and very soon Our Lady of Oblivious Death May come and hush my painful breath, And bear me thorough Lethe-stream, Sleeping sweet sleep without a dream; And bring you also from that sphere Where you grow sad without me, Dear; And bear us to her deepest cave Under the Sea without a wave, Where the eternal shadows brood In the Eternal Solitude, Stirring never, breathing never, Silent for ever and for ever; And side by side and face to face, And linked as in a death-embrace, Leave us absorbing thus the balm Of most divinely perfect calm, Till ten full years have overflowed For each wherein we bore the load Of heavy life upon this earth From birth to death from death to birth: That when this cycle shall be past We may wake young and pure at last, And both together recommence The life of passion, thought and sense, Of fear and hope, of woe and bliss;— But in another world than this. “For I am infinitely tired With this old sphere we once admired, With this old earth we loved too well; Disgusted more than words can tell, And would not mind a change of Hell. The same old solid hills and leas, The same old stupid patient trees, The same old ocean blue and green, The same sky cloudy or serene; The old two-dozen hours to run Between the settings of the sun, The old three hundred sixty-five Dull days to every year alive; Old stingy measure, weight and rule, No margin left to play the fool; The same old way of getting born Into it naked and forlorn, The same old way of creeping out Through death's low door for lean and stout; Same men with the old hungry needs, Puffed up with the old windy creeds; Old toil, old care, old worthless treasures, Old gnawing sorrows, swindling pleasures: The cards are shuffled to and fro, The hands may vary somewhat so, The dirty pack's the same we know Played with long thousand years ago; Played with and lost with still by Man,— Fate marked them ere the game began; I think the only thing that's strange Is our illusion as to change. “This is the favour I would ask: Can you submit to such a task?” “All you have told me I will do, Rejoicing to give joy to you: Oh, I will plead, will win the boon, That we may be united soon. . . . But sameness palls upon you so, That to relieve you I will go.” “By no means! wait a little, Dear! The change is in your being here. Besides, I have not finished yet— How stupid of me to forget! Sh! I shall think of it just now. . . . Your kiss, my Angel, on my brow! Your kiss that through the dullest pain Flashed inspiration on my brain!” Her face was fulgent with clear bliss; She bent down o'er me with the kiss As bends a dawn of golden light To kiss away the earth's long night. The splendour of her beauty made Me blind, and in the rapturous shade From head to foot my being thrilled As if with mighty music filled, To feel that kiss come leaning down Upon me like a radiant crown. Her royal kiss was on my brow A burning ruby, burning now As then, and burning evermore; A Star of Love above the roar And fever of this life's long war: And suddenly my brain was bright With glowing fire and dancing light, A rich intoxicating shine Like wave on wave of noble wine, The Alcahest of joy supreme Dissolving all things into dream. So when at length I found a tongue, Bell-clear and bold my voice outrung: “Dearest, all thanks were out of place For this thine overwhelming grace. The kiss of tenderness, the kiss Of truth, you gave me erst; but this Is consecration; to the man Who wears this burning talisman The veil of Isis melts away To woven air, the night is day, That he alone in all the shrine May see the lineaments divine: And fate the marble Sphinx, dumb, stern, Terror of Beauty cold, shall yearn And melt to flesh, and blood shall thrill The stony heart, and life shall fill The statue: it shall follow him Submissive to his every whim, Ev'n as the lion of the wild Followed pure Una, meek and mild. “Now, I can tell you what we two Before we part this night will do. There is a dance—I wish it were Some brilliant night-fête rich and rare, With gold-and-scarlet uniforms Far-flashing through the music-storms; Some Carnival's last Masquerade, Wherein our parts were fitly played. This is another sort of thing, The mere tame weekly gathering Of humble tradesmen, lively clerks, And fair ones who befit such sparks: Few merry meetings could look duller; No wealth, no grandeur, no rich colour. Yet they enjoy it: give a girl Some fiddle-screech to time her twirl, And give a youth the limpest waist That wears a gown to hold embraced; Then dance, dance, dance! both girl and boy Are overbrimmed and drunk with joy; Because young hearts to love's own chime Beat passionate rhythms all the time. “This is the night, and we will go, For many of the Class I know; Young friendly fellows, rather rough, But frank and kind and good enough For this bad world: how all will stare To see me with a dark Queen there! I went last winter twice or thrice, As dull as lead, as cold as ice, Amidst the flushed and vivid crowd Of youths and maidens laughing loud; For thought retraced the long sad years Of pallid smiles and frozen tears Back to a certain festal night, A whirl and blaze of swift delight, When we together danced, we two! I live it all again! . . . Do you Remember how I broke down quite In the mere polka? . . . Dressed in white, A loose pink sash around your waist, Low shoes across the instep laced, Your moonwhite shoulders glancing through Long yellow ringlets dancing too, You were an angel then; as clean From earthly dust-speck, as serene And lovely and beyond my love, As now in your far world above. “You shall this night a few more hours Be absent from your heavenly bowers; With leave or not, 'tis all the same, I keep you here and bear the blame. Your Star this night must take its chance Without you in the spheral dance, For you shall waltz and whirl with me Amidst a staider companie; The Cherubim and Seraphim And Saintly Hosts may drown their hymn With tenfold noise of harp and lyre; The sweetest voice of all the quire Shall sing to me, shall make my room, This little nutshellful of gloom, A Heaven of Heavens, the best of all, While I am dressing for the Ball! . . . “What book is this I held before, The gloaming glooming more and more, Eyes dreamed and hand drooped on the floor? The Lieder—Heine's—what we want! A lay of Heine's you shall chant; Our poor Saint Heinrich! for he was A saint here of the loftiest class, By martyrdom more dreadly solemn Than that of Simeon on the column. God put him to the torture; seven Long years beneath unpitying heaven, The body dead, the man at strife With all the common cares of life: A living Voice intense and brave Issuing from a Mattress-grave. At length the cruel agony wrung Confessions from that haughty tongue; Confessions of the strangest, more Than ever God had bargained for; With prayers and penitential psalms That gave the angels grinning qualms, With jests when sharp pangs cut too deep That made the very devils weep. Enough of this! the Monarch cried; Fear gave what mercy still denied; Torture committed suicide To quench that voice; the victim died Victorious over Heaven and Doom; The Mattress-grave became a tomb Deep in our Mother's kindly womb, Oblivion tranced the painful breath, The Death-in-Life grew perfect Death.” “Is it the mere quaint German type, Or is it from some blackened pipe? The volume seems, without a joke, A volume of tobacco-smoke!” “The choice is difficult in sooth; But sing that song of love and ruth The Princess Ilse sang his youth: And sing it very softly sweet, As not to ravish all the street; And sing it to what air you will, Your voice in any tune must thrill. . . . Yet stay, there was a certain hymn Which used at Sunday School to brim Our hearts with holy love and zeal, Our eyes with tears they yearned to feel: Mild Bishop Heber shall embrace Wild Heine by sweet music's grace, The while you sing the verses fair To Greenland's icy mountains' air; A freezing name! but icy mountains Were linked with Afric's sunny fountains.” Ich bin die Prinsessin Ilse, Und wohne im Ilsenstein; Komm mit nach meinem Schlosse, Wir wollen selig sein. “Dear Princess, I will come with thee Into thy cavern's mystery, And both of us shall happy be.” In meinen weissen Armen, An meiner weissen Brust, Da sollst du liegen und träumen Von alter Märchenlust. “In your white arms, on your white breast, I'll lie and dream in perfect rest, With more than faëry blessings blest.” Es bleiben todt die Todten, Und nur der Lebendige lebt; Und ich bin schön und blühend, Mein lachendes Herze bebt. “Yes, dead the dead for ever lie; But you my Love and your Love I Are of the souls that cannot die.” Doch dich soll mein Arm umschlingen, Wie er Kaiser Heinrich umschlang;— Ich hielt ihm zu die Ohren, Wenn die Trompet erklang. “Roll drum, plead lute, blare trumpet-call; Our ears shall be fast closed to all Beneath divine Oblivion's pall.” Oh what a quaintly coupled pair The poem and the music were! The Sunday School's old simple air, The heathen verses rich and rare! Wan ghosts have risen from the grave To flit across the midnight wave; Pale phantoms started from the tomb To hurry through the wildwood gloom; Cold corpses left their wormy bed To mingle in high feasts, 'tis said; But never since old Noah's flood Turned Eden into sand and mud, (Relieving thus the Heavenly guard From its long spell of duty hard?) The Holy Bible unfortunately tells us nothing of this. Readers may, however, refer to our auxiliary Bible, “Paradise Lost,” Book xi., Michael's prophecy of the Flood. But Milton was really too careless about the fate of the guard. Was it recalled in time, or did it perish at its post? Did the deluge sweep over that gate, “With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms?” Let us hope not. It would be sad to think that the “flaming sword” was extinguished with a hiss; and that the “Cherubim” were drowned like the other animals, without even the salvation of a single live specimen in the Ark. Probably, however, being abundantly and superabundantly furnished with wings, they all flew away to Heaven when the waters began sweeping the Mount of Paradise “Down the great river to the opening gulf.” Has any Angel left the sphere Of Heaven to dance with mortals here: Though earthly angels crowd each ball, Since women are such angels all. My partner was no icy corse, No phantom of a wild remorse, No Lamia of delirious dream, No nymph of forest, sea, or stream: A soul of fire, a lovely form Lithe to the dance and breathing warm; A face that flushed with cordial pleasure, Dove-feet that flew in perfect measure; A little hand so soft and fine, Whose touch electric thrilled through mine; A heart that beat against my breast Full pulses of triumphant zest; Deep eyes, pure eyes, as dark as night, Yet full of liquid love and light When their moon-soul came floating through The clouds of mystery into view, And myriad star-rays glittering keen Were tempered in its mystic sheen; Soft lips full curved in ruddy glow, And swift as young Apollo's bow,— What arrowy laughters flashing free With barbs of pleasant mockery Pierced through and through the whirling rout, And let thought in where life flew out, And made the world a happy dream “Where nothing is, but all things seem!” The splendid beauty of her face, Her dancing's proud and passionate grace, Her soul's eternal life intense Lavishly poured through every sense, Intoxicated all the air, Inspiring every dancer there: Never again shall that old Hall Spin round with such another Ball; The human whirlwind might have whirled It through the heights of air and hurled It down at last into the sea, Nor yet disturbed the revelry. The violin and the violoncello, The flute that withered little fellow, The red-faced cornet always mellow, Our noble Orchestra of four, Played as they never played of yore, Played as they will play nevermore, As if the rushing air were cloven By all the legions of Beethoven. In one of the eternal trances (Five minutes long) between two dances, The Brown whom one meets everywhere Came smug and grinning to me there, And “May I have the pleasure,—honour?” A glance (encouraging) upon her. “My dear good Brown, you understand This lady's from a foreign land, And does not comprehend a word You speak so well: nay, I have heard That one may search all England through, And not find twenty scholars who Can speak or write her language clearly, Though once our great men loved it dearly. The little of it I know still (Read well, write badly, speak so ill!) I first learnt many years ago From her, and one you do not know, A restless wanderer, one of these You call damned doubtful refugees, Enthusiasts, whom while harboured here All proper folk dislike and fear.” Brown muttered, “I've a little knowledge Of French,—the Working Man's New College.” “Ah, yes; your French is doubtless good, And French we know is understood By polished people everywhere; But then her land, though rich and fair, Lies far beyond the continents Of civilised accomplishments; And she could sooner learn to speak Persian or Sanskrit, Norse or Greek, Than this delightful brilliant witty Tongue of delightful Paris city, “Mich ruft der Tod ? Glaub mir, mein Kind, mein Weib, Mathilde, Nicht so gefährlich ist das wilde Erzürnte Meer und der trotzige Wald, Als unser jetzige Aufenthalt! Wie schrecklich auch der Wolf und der Geier, Haifische und sonstige Meerungeheuer: Viel grimmere, schlimmere Bestien enthält Paris, die leuchtende Hauptstadt der Welt, Das singende, springende, schöne Paris, Die Hölle der Engel, der Teufel Paradies— Das ich dich hier verlassen soll, Das macht mir verrückt, das macht mir toll!” Letzte Gedichte: Babylonische Sorgen. The title suggests, and may have been specially suggested by, that great verse of Jeremiah li. 7: “Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.” So Béranger, in his Jean de Paris: “Quel amour incroyable, Maintenant et jadis, Pour ces murs dont le diable A fait son paradis!” And he who knew his Paris best, Balzac the Terrible: “Cette succursale de l'enfer.” —Melmoth Reconcilié. Again, “Paris a été nommé un enfer. Tenez ce mot pour vrai.” —La Fille aux Yeux d'or. (Histoire des Treize.) And yet again, “Ce Paris qualifié d'antichambre de l'enfer.” —Balzac, to the Abbé Eglé.(‘The devils' paradise, the hell Of angels,—Heine loved it well!). And finally, my dearest Brown, The customs of her folk would frown Austere rebukes on her if she Dared dance with any one but me!” Brown went and whispered strange remarks To eager girls and staring clerks. . . . We are caught up and swept away In the cyclone-gallop's sway And round and round and round and round Go whirling in a storm of sound. But in the next brief perfect trance That followed the impassioned dance, The Jones whom one too rarely sees Came rushing on me like a breeze: “What miracle! what magic might!— But have you seen yourself to-night?” “Oh yes! twin-mirrored in the skies Of these my Lady's glorious eyes! In our rude days of kingly fear, If any monarch drawing near The palace saw so bright and clear His picture in the windows shine, He well might say, Auspicious sign That still this noble home is mine!” “But you are half as tall again, And stately as a King of Men; And in the prime of health and youth, Younger by twenty years, in sooth; Your face, the pale and sallow, glows As fresh as any morning rose; Your voice rings richly as a bell, Resonant as a trumpet-swell; Your dull and mournful dreamy eyes Now dazzle, burn, and mesmerise: Thus gazed, thus spoke, thus smiled, thus trod, Apollo the immortal God!” “Dear Jones, as usual, you are right; I stand revealed Myself to-night, The God of Poesy, Lord of Light. . . . But you would learn now whence the change: Listen; it is and is not strange. “There was a Fountain long ago, A fountain of perpetual flow, Whose purest springlets had their birth Deep in the bosom of the earth. Its joyous wavering silvery shaft To all the beams of morning laughed, Its steadfast murmurous crystal column Was loved by all the moonbeams solemn; From morn to eve it fell again A singing many-jewelled rain, From eve to morn it charmed the hours With whispering dew and diamond showers; Crowned many a day with sunbows bright, With moonbows halo'd many a night; And so kept full its marble urn, All fringed with fronds of greenest fern, O'er which with timeless love intent A pure white marble Goddess leant: And overflowing aye the urn In rillets that became a burn, It danced adown the verdant slope As light as youth, as gay as hope, And ‘wandered at its own sweet will;’ And here it was a lakelet still, And there it was a flashing stream; And all about it was a dream Of beauty, such a Paradise As rarely blooms beneath our skies; The loveliest flowers, the grandest trees, The broadest glades, the fairest leas; And double music tranced the hours,— The countless perfumes of the flowers, The countless songs of swift delight That birds were singing day and night. “But suddenly there fell a change; So suddenly, so sad, so strange! The fountain ceased to wave its lance Of silver to the spheral dance; The runnels were no longer fed, And each one withered from its bed; The stream fell stagnant, and was soon A bloated marsh, a pest-lagoon; The sweet flowers died, the noble trees Turned black and gaunt anatomies; The birds all left the saddened air To seek some other home as fair; The pure white Goddess and her urn Were covered with the withered fern,— The red and yellow fans outworn, And red and yellow leaves forlorn, Slow drifting round into a heap Till the fair shapes were buried deep: The happy Eden rich and fair Became a savage waste, a lair Where Silence with broad wings of gloom Brooded above a nameless tomb. . . . And thus it was for years and years; And only there were bitter tears Beneath those dark wings shed alway Instead of the bright fountain's play, And in the stead of sweet bird-tones Low unheard solitary moans. “Ah, sudden was that ruin sad; As sudden, resurrection glad! Unheralded one quiet night There came an Angel darkly bright, An Angel from the Heavenly Throne, Or else that Goddess carved in stone Enraptured into life by power Of her most marvellous beauty's dower: And from her long robe's sweeping pride The dead leaves all were scattered wide; And from a touch of her soft hand, Without one gesture of command, All suddenly was rolled away A mighty stone, whose broad mass lay Upon the urn, as on a tomb There lies a stone to seal its gloom: And straightway sprang into the night That joyous Fountain's shaft of light, Singing its old unwearied tune Of rapture to the quiet moon, As strong and swift and pure and high As ere it ever seemed run dry: For never since that Long-ago Had its deep springlets ceased to flow; But shut down from the light of day Their waters sadly oozed away Through pores of the dim underearth, Bereft of splendour, speed, and mirth; Yet ever ready now as then To leap into the air again.” “Ah yes,” said Jones, “I understand.” Then with his smile of sadness bland, “My fountain never got a chance To spring into the sunlight's glance, And wave its mystic silver lance In time with all the starry dance; Yet I believe 'tis ever there Heart-pulsing in its secret lair, Until the Goddess some fine day Shall come and roll the stone away. . . . Nor have you startled me; I knew Quite well it was a Goddess too.” “Because so well you know and speak Her esoteric Persian-Greek.” “Or shall we say (a truth of wine, If falsehood in the nectar-shine), Because a beauty so divine Has stirred no envy, grudge, or pine In any girl's or woman's breast, But only love and joyous zest?— For if the beauty dazzling thus Were nubile and not nebulous?” “This beauty is more real far Than all the other beauties are; And such a beauty's bridal kiss Transcends all other bridal bliss; And such a marriage-love will last When all the other loves are past. You know this well, dear friend of mine, When drinking nectar and not wine.” “I know it,—know it not: we rhyme The petals of the Flower of Time; And rhyming strip them off, perplext For every leaflet by the next Is contradicted in its turn; And thus we yearning ever yearn, And ever learning never learn; For while we pluck, from hour to hour New petals spring to clothe the flower, And till we strip the final one Can final answer fall to none. . . . To strip and strip the living bloom, Nor learn the oracle of Doom Until the fulgent Flower o' the Day Is altogether stripped away; Then with the dead stem leave the light, And moulder in eternal night!” “The sad old truth of earthly wine; The joyous fable in the shine Of nectar at the feast divine! . . . Love a near maid, love a far maid, But let Hebe be your barmaid; When she proffers you the cup, Never fear to drink it up; Though you see her crush her wine From a belladonna vine, Drink it, pouring on the clods Prelibation to the gods. Reck this rede unto the end: It is my good night, good friend.” The music 'gan again arise; A music of delicious sighs, A music plaintive with a grief More exquisite than all relief; Music impassioned, but subdued To a sweet sad dreamy mood. . . . And now a swift and sudden stream Of melody breaks through the dream: The still air trembles, and the whole Night-darkness fills with life and soul, And keen stars listen throbbing pale The drama of the nightingale. . . . The nightingale is now a thrush. . . . And now a soaring skylark. . . . Hush! Never a song in all the world! But low clouds floating soft and furled, And rivers winding far away, And ripples weaving faëry spray, And mists far-curving swelling round Dim twilight hills that soon are drowned, And breezes stirring solemn woods, And seas embracing solitudes; Interminable intervolving, Weaving webs for redissolving; The intertwining, interblending Of spirals evermore ascending; The floating hither, wheeling thither, Without a whence, without a whither; And still we whirl and wheel and float, But how the dancers are remote! “Is that the wonderful waltz-tune, Or is it the full-shining moon? And are those notes, so far and far? Each seems to me a brilliant star! Can we be dancing in the ball, And yet not see the earth at all? . . . The starry notes are round us whirling, Beneath the great moon-waltz is twirling; And thus without our own endeavour May we float and float for ever?” “When six long days of toil are past, The holy Sabbath comes at last.” Oh better than a battle won, And better than a great deed done, And better than a martyr's crown, And better than a king's renown, And better than a long calm life With lovely bairns and loving wife, And better than the sweetest thought That tearful Memory ever brought From searching with her rapturous woe Within the moonlit Long-ago, And better than the stillest sleep To him who wakes to moan and weep, And better than the trance of death To him who yearning suffereth; Better than this, than these, than all That mortals joys and triumphs call, Was last night's Meeting, last night's Ball! The tongue of flame had ceased to play, The steadfast glow long died away; The house was grave-still, and the street Re-echoed to no wandering feet; And still and chill as any stone The previous note anent this couch.)I lay upon the couch alone, Drest to the white kid-gloves in all The dress I put on for the Ball: And there, that glorious flower you see, She fixed it in my breast for me; Could such a flower of flowers have birth Upon our worn-out frigid earth? That golden-hearted amethyst Her own hand held, her own mouth kissed. The clocks struck one and two and three, And each stroke fell as aimed at me; For none should muse or read or write So late into the awful night, None dare awake the deep affright That pulseth in the heart of night, None venture save sleep-shrouded quite Into the solemn dead of night, None wander save in dreams of light Through the vast desert of black night; And none at three be dressed at all, Unless mere night-clothes dress you call Or underlinen of a pall; Therefore, my friend, in bidding you And all the rest a long adieu, For I am weary, Alleleu!— Yourself and all I re-advise, Early to bed and early to rise, Is the way to be healthy, wealthy, and wise! Epilogue. (Grossness here indeed is regnant, But it is the grossness pregnant; Heine growled it, ending thus His wild Book of Lazarus; Modern swansong's final note, Hoarse death-rattle in the throat. Swan was white or black?—Our candour! Black or white no swan's a gander.) “Glory warms us in the grave! Stupid words, that sound so brave! Better warmth would give to us Molly Seagrim amorous, Slobbering kisses lips and tongue, And yet reeking from the dung. Eine Kuh-magd—Any farm-wench; but Heine, who knew Fielding, probably had Molly Seagrim in his mind. Better warmth would likewise dart Through the cockles of one's heart, Drinking mulled wine, punch, or grog, Until helpless as a log, In the lowest den whose crowd is Thieves and drabs and ragged rowdies, Mortgaged to the gallows-rope, But who meanwhile breathe and hope, And more enviable far Than the son of Thetis are. Yes, Pelides was a judge;— Better live the poorest drudge In the upper world, than loom On the Stygian shore of gloom Phantom-Leader, bodiless roamer, Though besung by mighty Homer.” 1864. WEDDAH AND OM-EL-BONAIN Note.—I found this story, and that of the short piece following, which merit far better English versions than I have been able to accomplish, in the De l'Amour of De Stendhal (Henri Beyle), chap. 53, where they are given among “Fragments Extracted and Translated from an Arabic Collection, entitled The Divan of Love, compiled by Ebn-Abi-Hadglat.” From another of these fragments I quote a few lines by way of introduction: “The Benou-Azra are a tribe famous for love among all the tribes of Arabia. So that the manner in which they love has passed into a proverb, and God has not made any other creatures so tender in loving as are they. Sahid, son of Agba, one day asked an Arab, Of what people art thou? I am of the people who die when they love, answered the Arab. Thou art then of the tribe of Azra? said Sahid. Yes, by the master of the Caaba! replied the Arab. Whence comes it, then, that you thus love? asked Sahid. Our women are beautiful and our young men are chaste, answered the Arab.” On this theme Heine has a poem of four unrhymed quatrains, Der Azra, of which the sense without the melody may be given in English:— Daily went the wondrous-lovely Sultan's daughter to and fro there In the evening by the fountain, Where the waters white were plashing. Daily stood the youthful captive In the evening by the fountain, Where the waters white were plashing; Daily grew he pale and paler. And one evening the princess Stepped to him with sudden question: “I would know your name, young captive, And your country and your kindred.” Then the slave replied: “My name is Mohammed, I come from Yemen, And my kindred are the Azra, They who when they love must perish.” Part I. I Weddah and Om-el-Bonain, scarcely grown To boy and girlhood from their swaddling bands, Were known where'er the Azra tribe was known, Through Araby and all the neighbouring lands; Were chanted in the songs of sweetest tone Which sprang like fountains 'mid the desert sands: They were so beautiful that none who saw But felt a rapture trembling into awe. II Once on a dewy evetide when the balm Of herb and flower made all the air rich wine, And still the sunless shadow of the palm Sought out the birthplace of the day divine, These two were playing in the happy calm. A young chief said: In these be sure a sign Great God vouchsafes; a living talisman Of glory and rich weal to bless our clan. III Proud hearts applauded; but a senior chief Said: Perfect beauty is its own sole end; It is ripe flower and fruit, not bud and leaf; The promise and the blessing meet and blend, Fulfilled at once: then malice, wrath, and grief, Lust of the foe and passion of the friend, Assail the marvel; for all Hell is moved Against the work of Allah most approved. IV Thus beauty is that pearl a poor man found; Which could not be surrendered, changed, or sold, Which he might never bury in the ground, Or hide away within his girdle-fold; But had to wear upon his brow uncrowned, A star of storm and terrors; for, behold, The richest kings raged jealous for its light, And just men's hearts turned robbers at the sight. V But if the soul be royal as the gem, That star of danger may flash victory too, The younger urged, and bring the diadem To set itself in. And the other: True; If all Life's golden apples crown one stem, Fate touches none; but single they are few: And whether to defeat or triumph, this One star lights war and woe, not peaceful bliss. VI But nothing recked the children in that hour, And little recked through fifteen happy years, Of any doom in their surpassing dower: Rich with the present, free from hopes and fears, They dwelt in time as in a heavenly bower: Their life was strange to laughter as to tears, Serenely glad; their partings were too brief For pain; and side by side, what thing was grief? VII Amidst their clan they dwelt in solitude, Not haughtily but by instinctive love; As lion mates with lion in the wood, And eagle pairs with eagle not with dove; The lowlier creatures finding their own good In their own race, nor seeking it above: These dreamt as little of divided life As that first pair created man and wife. VIII The calm years flowed thus till the youth and maid Were almost man and woman, and the spell Of passion wrought, and each was self-dismayed; The hearts their simple childhood knew so well Were now such riddles to them, in the shade And trouble of the mists that seethe and swell When the large dawn is kindling, which shall grow Through crimson fires to steadfast azure glow. IX That year a tribe-feud, which some years had slept Through faintness, woke up stronger than before; And with its stir young hearts on all sides leapt For battle, swoln with peace and plenteous store; Swift couriers to and fro the loud land swept Weaving thin spites to one vast woof of war: And Weddah sallied forth elate, ranked man, A warrior of the warriors of his clan. X Ere long flushed foes turned haggard at his name; The beautiful, the terrible: for fire Burns most intensely in the clearest flame; The comeliest steed is ever last to tire And swiftest footed; and in war's fierce game The noblest sword is deadliest in its gyre: His gentle gravity grew keen and gay In hottest fight as for a festal day. XI And while he fought far distant with his band, Walid the Syrian, Abd-el-Malek's son; Renowned already for a scheme long planned With silent patience, and a sharp deed done When its ripe fruit leaned ready for his hand, And liberal sharing of the fruit well won; Came south to greet the tribe, and knit anew Old bonds of friendship and alliance true. XII He had full often from the poets heard Of these two children the divinely fair; But was not one to kindle at a word, And languish on faint echoes of an air; By what he saw and touched his heart was stirred, Nor knew sick longings and the vague despair Of those who turn from every nearest boon To catch like infants at the reachless moon. XIII But when one sunset flaming crimson-barred He saw a damsel like a shape of sleep, Who moved as moves in indolence the pard; Above whose veil burned large eyes black and deep, The lairs of an intense and slow regard Which made all splendours of the broad world cheap, And death and life thin dreams; fate-smitten there He rested shuddering past the hour of prayer. XIV Be heaven all stars, we feel the one moon's rise: Who else could move with that imperial grace? Who else could bear about those fateful eyes, Too overwhelming for a mortal face? Beyond all heed of questions and surprise He stood a termless hour in that same place, Convulsed in silent wrestling with his doom; Haggard as one brought living from the tomb. XV And she had shuddered also passing by, A moment; for her spirit though intent Was chilled as conscious of an evil eye; But forthwith turned and o'er its one dream bent; A woman lilting as she came anigh: But to destroy on earth was Weddah sent; There where he is brave warriors fall before him, Where he is not pine damsels who adore him. XVI And thus with purpose like a trenchant blade Forged in that fierce hour's fire, the Syrian chief Began new life. When next the Council weighed The heavy future charged with wrath and grief, He spoke his will: I ask to wed the maid, The child of Abd-el-Aziz: and, in brief, I bring for dowry all our wealth and might, Unto our last heart's blood, to fight your fight. XVII All mute with marvelling sat. Her sire then said: From infancy unto my brother's son She has been held betrothed: our Lord can wed Full many a lovelier, many a richer one. But quite in vain they reasoned, flattered, pled; This was his proffer, other he had none: A boy and girl outweighed the Azra tribe? 'Twas strange! His vow was fixed to that sole bribe. XVIII And as their couriers came in day by day Pregnant with portents of yet blacker ill; And all their urgence broke in fuming spray Against the rock of his firm-planted will; The baffled current took a tortuous way, And drowned a happy garden green and still, O'erwhelming Abd-el-Aziz with that gibe, A boy and girl outvalue all our tribe? XIX He loved his daughter, and he loved yet more His brother's son; and now the whole tribe prest The scale against them: there was raging war, Too sure of hapless issue in his breast; Sea-tossed where rocks on all sides fanged the shore. She heard him moaning: Would I were at rest, Ere this should come upon me, in the grave! Her poor heart bled to hear him weep and rave. XX She flung herself all yearning at his feet; The long white malehair dashed her brow with tears; But her tears scalded him; her kisses sweet Were crueller than iron barbs of spears; He had no eyes her tender eyes to meet; Her soft caressing words scarce touched his ears But they were fire and madness in his brain: Yet while she clasped he mutely clasped again. XXI At length he answered her: A heavy doom Is laid upon me; now, when I am old, And weak, and bending toward the quiet tomb . . . Can it then be, as we are sometimes told, That woman, nay, that young girls in their bloom, Lovely, beloved, and loving, have been bold To give their lives, when blenched the bravest man, For safety of their city or their clan? XXII She trembled in cold shadow of a rock Leaning to crush her where she knelt fast bound; She grew all ear to catch the coming shock, And felt already quakings of the ground; Yet firmly said: Your anguish would not mock Your daughter, O my Father: pray expound The woeful riddle; and whate'er my part, It is your very blood which feeds this heart. XXIII He told her all: the perils great and near; The might of Walid; and the friendship long Which bound them to his house, and year by year With mutual kindnesses had grown more strong His offer, his demand, which would not hear A word in mitigation right or wrong. Her young blood curdled: bring him to our tent, That I may plead; perchance he will relent. XXIV He came; and found her sitting double-veiled, For grief was round her like a funeral stole. She pleaded, she o'erwhelmed him, and she failed; For still the more her passion moved his soul, The more he loved her; when his heart most quailed, His purpose stretched most eager for the goal: I stake myself, house, friends, all, for the tribe Which gives me you; but for no meaner bribe. XXV So her face set into a stony mask, And heavy silence crushed them for an hour Ere she could learn the words to say her task: Let only mutes appeal to Fate's deaf power! Behold I pledge myself to what you ask, My sire here sells me for the settled dower: The sheikhs can know we are at one; I pray That none else know it ere the wedding-day. XXVI Which shall be when next moon is on the wane As this to-night: my heart is now the bier Of that which we have sacrificed and slain; My own poor Past, still beautiful and dear, Cut off from life, wants burial; and though vain Is woman's weeping, I must weep I fear A little on the well-beloved's tomb Ere marriage smiles and blushes can outbloom. XXVII He left them, sire and daughter, to their woe; Himself then sick at heart as they could be: But set to work at once, and spurred the slow Sad hours till they were fiery-swift as he: With messengers on all sides to and fro, With ravelled webs of subtle policy, He gave the sheikhs good earnest of what aid They had so cheaply bought with one fair maid. XXVIII Thus he took Araby's one peerless prize, And homeward went ungrudging all the cost; Though she was marble; with blank arid eyes, Weary and hopeless as the waste they crossed When neither moon nor star is in the skies, And water faileth, and the track is lost. He took such statue triumphing for wife, Assured his love would kindle it to life. XXIX She had indeed wept, wept and wailed that moon, But had not buried yet her shrouded Past; Which ever lay in a most deathlike swoon, Pallid and pulseless, motionless and ghast, While Fate withheld from it death's perfect boon: She kept this doleful mystery locked up fast; Her form was as its sepulchre of stone, Her heart its purple couch and hidden throne. XXX She went; and sweeter voiced than cooing dove Hassan the bard his farewell ode must render: We had a Night, the dream of heaven above, Wherein one moon and countless stars of splendour; We had a Moon, the face of perfect love, Wherein two nights with stars more pure and tender: Our Night with its one moon we still have here; Where is our Moon with its twin nights more dear? Part II. I As Weddah and his troop were coming back From their first foray, which success made brief, Scouts met him and in sharp haste turned his track On special mission to a powerful chief, Who wavered still between the white and black, And lurked for mere self-profit like a thief. This errand well fulfilled, at last he came To flush her tear-pearls with the ruby fame. II Into the camp full joyously he rode, Leading his weary escort; as for him, The love and trust that in his bosom glowed Had laughed away all weariness of limb. The sheikhs, his full report heard, all bestowed Well-measured praises, brief and somewhat grim; As veterans scanning the enormous night In which this one star shone so bravely bright. III Then Abd-el-Aziz rose and left the tent, And he accompanied with eager pace; And marked not how his frank smiles as he went Were unreflected in each well-known face; How joyous greetings he on all sides sent Brought hollow echoes as from caverned space: His heart drank sweet wine 'mid the roses singing, And thought the whole world with like revels ringing. IV He entered with his uncle, and his glance Sank disappointed. But the old man wept With passion o'er him, eyeing him askance; And made him eat and drink; and ever kept Questioning, questioning, as to every chance Throughout his absence; keen to intercept The fatal, But my cousin? ready strung Upon the tense lips by the eager tongue. V At length it flew, the lover's wingèd dart; He sped it wreathed with flowers of hope and joy, It pierced with iron point the old man's heart, Who quivering cried: You are, then, still a boy! Love, love, the sweet to meet, the smart to part, Make all your world of pleasure and annoy! Is this a time for dalliance in rose bowers? The vultures gather; do they scent sweet flowers? VI It is a time of woe and shame, of strife Whose victory must be dolorous as defeat: The sons of Ishmael clutch the stranger's knife To stab each other; every corpse you meet Has held a Moslem soul, an Arab life: The town-serfs prisoned in stark fort and street Exult while countless tents that freely roam Perish like proud ships clashing in the foam. VII We might learn wisdom from our foes and thralls! The mongrels of a hundred barbarous races, Who know not their own sires, appease their brawls, Leave night and sunward set their impure faces, To bay in concert round old Syrian walls, And thrust their three gods on our holy places: We have one Sire, one Prophet, and one Lord, And yet against each other turn the sword. VIII Thus long he groaned with fevered bitterness, Till, Say at least, my Father, she is well! Stung prudence out of patience: Surely yes! The children of the faith whom Azrael Hath gathered, do they suffer our distress?— But smitten by that word the lover fell, As if at such rash mention of his name That bird of God with wings of midnight came. IX Deep in the shadow of those awful plumes A night and day and night he senseless lay; And Abd-el-Aziz cowered 'mid deeper glooms, Silent in vast despair, both night and day: It seemed two forms belonging to the tombs Had been abandoned in that tent; for they Were stark and still and mute alike, although The one was conscious of their double woe. X At last death left the balance, and the scale Of wretched life jarred earth: and in the morn The lover woke, confused as if a veil Of heavy dreams involved him; weak and worn And cold at heart, and wondering what bale Had wounded him and left him thus forlorn: So still half-stunned with anguish he lay long, Fretful to rend the shroud that wrapt his wrong. XI He turned; and on the pillow, near his head, He saw a toy, a trifle, that gave tongue To mute disaster: forthwith on his bed The coiled-snake Memory hissed and sprang and stung: Then all the fury of the storm was shed From the black swollen clouds that overhung; The hot rain poured, the fierce gusts shook his soul, Wild flashes lit waste gloom from pole to pole. XII He hardly dared to touch the petty thing, The talisman of this tremendous spell: A purse of dark blue silk; a golden ring, A letter in the hand he knew so well. Still as he sought to read new gusts would fling Wet blindness in his vision, and a knell Of rushing thunder trample through his brain And tread him down into the swoon again. XIII He read: Farewell! In one sad word I weave More thoughts than pen could write or tongue declare. No other word can Om-el-Bonain leave To Weddah, save her blessing; and her prayer. That he will quail not, though his heart must grieve, That all his strength and valour, skill and care, Shall be devoted loyally to serve The sacred Tribe, and never self-ward swerve. XIV For verily the Tribe is all, and we Are nothing singly save as parts of it: The one great Nile flows ever to the sea, The waterdrops for ever change and flit; And some the first ooze snares, and some may be The King's sweet draught, proud Cairo's mirror; fit For all each service of the stream whose fame They share, by which alone they have a name. XV And since I know that you cannot forget, And am too sure your love will never change, I leave my image to your soul: but yet Keep it as shrined and shrouded till the strange Sad dream of life, illusion and regret, Is ended; short must be its longest range. Farewell! Hope gleams the wan lamp in a tomb Above a corpse that waits the final doom. XVI This writing was a dear but cruel friend That dragged him from the deep, and held him fast Upon life's shore, who would have found an end, Peace and oblivion. Turn from such a past To such a future, and unquailing wend Its infinite hopeless hours! he shrank aghast: Yet in this utmost weakness swore to make The dreadful sacrifice for her dear sake. XVII But when he stood as one about to fall, And would go weep upon her tomb alone, And Abd-el-Aziz had to tell him all, The cry of anguish took a harsher tone: Rich harem coverlets for funeral pall, For grave a Syrian marriage couch and throne! A human rival, breathing mortal breath, And not the star-cold sanctity of Death! XVIII This truth was as a potent poison-draught, Fire in the entrails, wild fire in the brain, Which kindled savage strength in him who quaffed And did not die of its first maddening pain. It struck him like the mere malignant shaft Which stings a warrior into sense again, Who lay benumbed with wounds, and would have died Unroused: the fresh wound makes him crawl and hide. XIX A month he wandered in wild solitude; And in that month grew old, and yet grew strong: Now lying prone and still as death would brood The whole long day through and the whole night long; Now demon-driven day and night pursued Stark weariness amidst the clamorous throng Of thoughts that raged with memory and desire, And parched, his bruised feet burning, could not tire. XX When he came back, o'ermastered by his vow To serve the Tribe through which he was unblest, None gazed without remorse upon his brow, None felt his glance without an aching breast: Magnificent in beauty even now, Ravaged by grief and fury and unrest, He moved among them swift and stern of deed, And always silent save in action's need. XXI And thus went forth, and unrejoicingly Drank deep of war's hot wine: as one who drinks And only grows more sullen, while yet he Never the challenge of the full cup shrinks; And rises pale with horror when the glee Of careless revellers into slumber sinks, Because the feast which could not give him joy At least kept phantoms from their worst annoy. XXII The lion of the Azra is come back A meagre wolf! foes mocked, who mocked no more When midnight scared them with his fresh attack After the long day's fighting, and the war Found him for ever wolf-like on their track, As if consumed with slakeless thirst of gore: Since he was cursed from slumber and repose, He wreaked his restlessness on friends and soes. XXIII The lightnings of his keen sword ever flashed Without a ray of lightning in his glance; His blade where blades were thickest clove or clashed Without a war-cry: ever in advance He sought out death; but death as if abashed Adopted for its own his sword and lance, And rode his steed, and swayed aside or blunted The eager hostile weapons he affronted. XXIV Once in the thick of battle as he raged Thus cold and dumb amidst the furious cries, Hassan the bard was near to him engaged, And read a weird in those forlorn fixed eyes; And singing of that combat they had waged Gave voice to what surpassed his own surmise: For our young Lion of the mateless doom Shall never go a cold corpse to the tomb! XXV Awe silenced him who sang, and deep awe fell On those who heard it round the campfire's blaze: But when they questioned he had nought to tell; The vision had departed from his gaze. The verse took wing and was a mighty spell; Upon the foe new terror and amaze, To friends redoubled force; to one alone, The hero's self, it long remained unknown. XXVI While Weddah in the South with fiery will Bore conquest wheresoe'er his banner flew, Walid with royal heart and patient skill Upon the Syrian confines triumphed too. They never met: each felt a savage thrill Which jarred his inmost being through and through As still fresh fame the other's fame enlarged: Each wished his rival in the ranks he charged. XXVII And when the foemen sued at length for peace To victors surfeited with war's alarms, Save him who knew all rest in rest must cease, They said: O warriors, not by your own arms, Though they are mighty! may their might increase! But more by Om-el-Bonain's fatal charms, Possessing both who lost her and who won, Have we been baffled, vanquished, and undone. XXVIII Whence Hassan sang his sudden daring ode Of Beauty revelling in the storm of fight: For if the warriors into battle rode, Their hearts were kindled by her living light; Either as sun that in pure azure glowed, Or baleful star in deep despair's black night: And whether by despair or joy she lit Intenser fires perplexed the poet's wit. XXIX And would you know why empires break asunder, Why peoples perish and proud cities fall; Seek not the captains where the steedclouds thunder, Seek not the elders in the council hall; But seek the chamber where some shining wonder Of delicate beauty nestles, far from all The turmoil, toying with adornments queenly, And murmuring songs of tender love serenely. XXX The clashing cymbals and the trumpet's clangour Are peacefuller than her soft trembling lute; The armies raging with hot fire of anger Are gentler than her gentle glances mute; The restless rushings of her dainty languor Outveer the wind, outspeed the barb's pursuit: Well Hassan knows; who sings high laud and blessing To this dear fatal riddle past all guessing. Part III. I The war was over for the time; and men Returned to heal its wounds, repair its waste, And thus grow strong and rich to fight again. And Weddah, cold in victory's sun, embraced The uncle whom his glory warmed; and then, Gathering his spoil of gems and gold in haste, Rode forth: the clansmen wondered much to find His famous favourite steed was left behind. II He set out in the night: none knew his goal, Though some might fix it in their secret thought. He could no longer stifle or control, In calm by battle's fever undistraught, The piteous yearning of his famished soul Which unappeasably its food besought; Fretting his life out like an infant's cry, Let us but see her once before we die! III When he returned not, soon the rumour spread, That he had vanished now his work was done; The prophecy had been fulfilled; not dead, But in the body borne beyond the sun, He lived eternal life. He heard this said Himself in Walid's city, where as one Who sojourns but for traffic's sake he dwelt; And hearing it, more surely shrouded felt. IV Courteous and humble as beseemeth trade, While ever on the watch, some gems he sold: Men said, this young man is discreet and staid, Yet fair in dealing, nor too fond of gold. He smiled to hear his virtues thus arrayed, A smile that gloomed to frowning; but controlled The haughty spirit surging in his breast; The end in view, what mattered all the rest? V The end in reach: for now the favourite slave Of Om-el-Bonain, as he knew full well; A frank-eyed girl, whose bosom was a wave Whereon love's lotus lightly rose and fell; Drew near to him, attracted by his grave Unsceptred majesty, and by the spell Of his intense and fathomless regard, Splendid in gloom as midnight myriad-starred. VI She haggled for a trinket with her tongue To veil the eager commerce of her eyes; Those daring smugglers when the heart is young, For contraband of passion. His disguise In talk with her but loosely round him hung; She glimpsed a secret and an enterprise; Love's flower, unsunned by hope, soon fades; she grieves, Yet still returns to scent the rich dead leaves. VII Till sick at heart and desperate with delay He ventured all, abruptly flinging down The weary mask: if death must end the play, Better at once: I learn that in your town Dwells Om-el-Bonain, whom you know men say, Upon her eye-flash dropped a decent frown: She is my mistress, and great Walid's wife— The word his heart sought, stabbed in with a knife. VIII Your mistress is my cousin; and will be The friend of who shall tell her I am here. But if I may not trust your secrecy, Tell Walid, tell not her: and have no fear That I will harm you for harm done to me, Unaimed at her. The life I hold not dear Might dower you well. But with a passionate oath The eager girl swore loyalty to both. IX Then hurried from him to her lady sweet, And thrilled her frozen heart with burning pang: For life resigned and torpid in defeat To new contention with its fate upsprang, This sword of hope sound lying at her feet While love's impetuous clarion summons rang: Weddah alive: alive and here! Beware! If you now mock, Hell mock your dying prayer! X I saw a merchant: never chief or king Of form so noble visited our land; He wore a little ring, a lady's ring, On the last finger of a feared right hand; Some woe enormous overshadowing Made beauty terrible that had been bland; He was convulsed when he would speak your name, From such abysses of his heart it came. XI Now whether this be Weddah's self or not, My Lady in her wisdom must decide. The lady's questions ploughed the self-same spot Over and over lest some grains should hide Of this vast treasure fallen to her lot: Swear by the Prophet's tomb I may confide In you as in myself until the end; And Om-el-Bonain lives and dies your friend. XII Brave Amine swore, and bravely held the vow. Her mistress kept her babbling all that eve, A pleasant rill. And on the morrow: Now Go bid him tell all friends that he must leave In seven days; so much we must allow, So many starving hours of bliss bereave! His travels urge him in his own despite; He gives a farewell feast on such a night: XIII And in the meanwhile he shall fully learn What is to follow. When this message came, The thick dark in him 'gan to seethe and burn Till soul and body fused in one clear flame. His guests all blinked with wonder to discern This glowing heart of joy; and flushed with shame Unmerited for having thought him cold, Who made their old feel young, their young feel old. XIV The long week passed; the morning came to crown Or kill the lovers' hope. It was a day Well chosen, for some guests of high renown Left Walid, who would speed them on their way; And festal tumult filled the sunny town. The merchant in departure strolled astray Amongst the groups about the palace heaving To glimpse the rich procession form for leaving. XV And when it left, absorbing every eye; A stream of splendours rolling with the din Of horn and tabor under that blue sky; Came Amine carelessly and led him in, With chat of certain anklets she would buy; And led him lounging onwards till they win A storeroom where her mistress daily spent Some matin hours on household cares intent. XVI Large chests were ranged around it, one of which They had made ready with most loving care; Lurked apertures among the carvings rich, Above its deep soft couch, for light and air: Behold your prison cell, your palace niche, The jewel casket of my Lady fair! I lock you in; from her must come your key: Love's captives pay sweet ransom to get free! XVII She found her mistress fever-flushed, and told Their full success: Our prisoner is secure; A lion meek as lambkin of the fold, Prepared your harshest torments to endure! But, dearest Lady, as you have been bold, Be prudent, prudent, prudent, and assure Long life to bliss. Now with your leave I go To be well seen of all the house below. XVIII She took another stairway for descent, And sauntered round to the front courtyard gate, Chatting and laughing lightly as she went With various groups, all busy in debate On those departed guests: and some were shent For meanness maugre retinue and state, And some extolled for bounteous disposition, And all summed up with judgment-day precision. XIX Of all her fellow-slaves it seemed but one, Whose breast was tinder for love's flame would she Vouchsafe a spark, had spied the venture run: Soho, my flirting madam, where is he You brought in here an hour since with your fun? A happy rogue, whoever he may be! Have you already tired of this new dandy, Or hid him somewhere to be always handy? XX The stupid jealous creature that you are! Where were your eyes, then, not to know his face? For weeks back he has dealt in our bazaar, And now is on the road to some new place. He had an emerald and diamond star I thought might win my poor dear Lady's grace; She would not even look at it, alack! I packed him off for ever with his pack. XXI Thus these long-hapless lovers for awhile, Enringed with dreadful fire, safe ambush found, Screened by its very glare; a magic isle By roaring billows guarded well till drowned; A refuge spot of green and liquid smile Whose rampart was the simoom gathering round: If darkness hid them, it was thunder gloom Whose light must come in lightnings to consume. XXII And even as Iskander's self, for whom The whole broad earth sufficed not, found at last Full scope vouchsafed him in the narrow tomb; So he long pining in the desert vast As in a dungeon, found now ample room, Found perfect freedom and content, shut fast Alive within that coffer-coffin lonely, Which gave him issue to that chamber only. XXIII They knew what peril compassed them about, But could not feel the dread it would inspire; Imperious love shut other passions out, Or made them fuel for his altar fire. At first one sole thought harassed them with doubt; To kill her lord and flee? Then tribe and sire Would justly curse them; for in every act He had been loyal to the evil pact. XXIV He had indeed wronged them; for well he knew Their love from infancy, their plighted troth, When merciless in mastery he drew From her repugnant lips the fatal oath: That love avenged the wrong of love was due; But still his blood was sacred to them both; The tender husband and the proved ally They dare not harm; must death come, they could die. XXV Die! Often he would dream for hours supine Upon his lidded couch, Life's dream is over; I wait the resurrection in this shrine: Anon an angel cometh to uncover The inmost glories of the realm divine, Because though dead I still am faithful lover; My spirit drinks its fill of bliss, and then Sinks back into this twilight trance again. XXVI Like bird above its young one in the nest Which cannot fly, he often heard her singing; The thrill and swell of rapture from her breast In fountains of delightful music springing: It seemed he had been borne among the blest, Whose quires around his darksome couch were ringing; Long after that celestial voice sank mute His heartstrings kept sweet tremble like a lute. XXVII She heard his breathing like a muffled chime, She heard his tranquil heart-beats through the flow Of busy menials in the morning time; Far-couched at night she felt a sudden glow, And straight her breathing answered rhyme for rhyme His softest furtive footsteps to and fro: And none else heard? She marvelled how the sense Of living souls could be so dull and dense. XXVIII Once early, early, ere the dawn grew loud, She stole to watch his slumber by its gleam; And blushing with a soft laugh-gurgle bowed And sank as in the bosom of a stream, An ardent angel in a rosy cloud Resolving the enchantment of his dream: Where there is room for thee, is room for us; So may I share thy death-sarcophagus! XXIX She grew so lovely, ravishing, and sweet, Her brow so radiant and her lips so warm; Such rich heart-music stirred her buoyant feet, And swayed the gestures of her lithe young form, And revelled in her voice to bliss complete; That Walid whirled with his great passion's storm, Befooled with joy, went doting down his hell: Oh, tame and meek, my skittish wild gazelle! XXX Thus these, sings Hassan, of their love's full measure Drank swiftly in that circle of swift fire; A veil of light and ardour to their pleasure Till it revealed their ashes on one pyre: Some never win, some spend in youth this treasure, And crawl down sad age starvelings of desire: These lavished royal wealth in one brief season, But Death found both so rich he gave them reason. Part IV. I The tender almond-blossom flushed and white Sank floating in warm flakes through lucid air; The rose flung forth into the sea of light Her heart of fire and incense burning bare; The nightingale thrilled all the breathless night With passion so intense it seemed despair: And still these lovers drank love's perfect wine From that gold urn of secrecy divine. II Then Fate prepared the end. A grey old man, Bowed down with grief who had not bent with time, Made way to Walid in the full divan: His son, great-hearted and in youth's hot prime, Was now a fugitive and under ban For an indignant deed of sinless crime; A noble heirloom pearl the suppliant brought To clear the clouded face ere he besought. III This pearl in Walid's mood of golden joy Shone fair as morning star in rosy dawn; He called his minion, Motar: Take this toy Unto your Lady where she sits withdrawn, With my love-greeting, and this message, boy: Were this a string of such, a monarch's pawn, A pearl for every note, it would not pay That song I heard you singing yesterday. IV They had been leaning for an hour perchance, Motionless, gazing in each other's eyes; Floating in deep pure joy, whose still expanse Rippled but rarely with long satiate sighs; Their souls so intermingled in the trance, So far away dissolved through fervent skies, That it was marvel how each fair mute form Without its pulse and breath remained life-warm. V When rapid footsteps almost at the door Stung her to vigilance, and her fierce start Shook Weddah, and that lion of proud war Must flee to covert like a timid hart: But drunken with the message he now bore The saucy youth flew in, Fate's servile dart, Without announcement; and espied, what he, Still subtle though amazed, feigned not to see. VI The message with the goodly pearl he gave: She could for wrath have ground it into dust Between her richer teeth, and stabbed the slave Who brought it; but most bitterly she must Put on sweet smiles of pleasure, and the knave With tender answer full of thanks entrust. He lingered: Our kind lady will bestow Some little mark of bounty ere I go? VII Her anger cried: Only the message dear Has saved the messenger from punishment; If evermore as now you enter here You shall be scourged and starved and prison-pent. He cowered away from her in sullen fear, And darted from the room; and as he went The sting of her rebuke was curdling all His blood of vanity to poison gall. VIII He hissed in Walid's ear the seething spite: My Lord's pearl by my Lady's was surpassed; In that rich cedar coffer to the right I saw the treasure being hidden fast; A gallant, young and beautiful and bright. Unmothered slave, be that foul lie your last! And clove the scandal with his instant sword Strong Walid: Motar had his full reward. IX When Weddah, plunged from glory into gloom, Heard that last speech of Om-el-Bonain there, A sudden ominous sense of icy doom Assailed his glowing heart with bleak despair. The moment that false slave had left the room She sprang to seize her lover in his lair: She bowed all quivering like a storm-swept palm; He rose to meet her solemn, pale and calm. X He clasped her with strong passion to his breast, He kissed her with a very tender kiss: Soul of my soul! what lives men call most blest Can be compared to our brief lives in bliss? But one wild year of anguish and unrest; Three moons of perfect secret love! Were this My dying hour, I thankfully attest Of all earth's dooms I have enjoyed the best. XI What, weeping, thou, such kiss-unworthy tears! The glory of the Azra must not weep, Whom mighty Weddah worships, for cold fears; But only for strong love, in stillness deep, Secluded from all alien eyes and ears. And now to vigil, and perchance to sleep, Enshrined once more: be proud and calm and strong; Your second visitor will come ere long. XII And scarcely was all said when Walid came, Full gently stealing for a tiger-spring; His love and fury, hope and fear and shame, All mad with venom from that serpent's sting, Like wild beasts huddled in a den of flame Within the cool white palace of a king: She rose to greet; he deigned no glance of quest, But went and lolled upon that cedar chest. XIII I come like any haggler of the mart, Who having sent a bauble seeks its price: Will you forgive the meanness of my part, And one of these fair coffers sacrifice? A clutch of iron fingers gript her heart Till it seemed bursting in the cruel vice: And yet she quivered not, nor breathed a moan: Are not myself and all things here your own? XIV I thank you for the bountiful award; And choose, say this whereon I now sit here? Take any, take them all; but that, my Lord, Is full of household stuff and woman's gear. I want the coffer, not what it may hoard, However rich and beautiful and dear. And it is thine, she said; and this the key: Her royal hand outheld it steadfastly. XV Swift as a double flash from thunder-skies The angel and the devil of his doubt Flamed from the sombre windows of his eyes: He went and took the key she thus held out, And turned as if he would unlock his prize. She breathed not; all the air ran blood about A swirl of terrors and wild hopes of guilt; Calm Weddah seized, then loosed, his dagger-hilt. XVI But Walid had restrained himself, and thought: Shall I unlock the secret of my soul, The mystery of my Fate, that has been brought So perfectly within my own control? That were indeed a work by folly wrought: For Time, in this my vassal, must unroll To me, and none but me, what I would learn; I hold the vantage, undiscerned discern. XVII He summoned certain slaves, and bade them bear The coffer he had sealed with his own seal Into a room below with strictest care; And followed thoughtful at the last one's heel. At noontide Amine found her mistress there, Benumbed with horror, deaf to her appeal; The sightless eyes fixed glaring on that door By which her soul had vanished evermore. XVIII Beneath the cedar whose noonshadow large, Level from massive trunk, outspread halfway Adown a swardslope to the river marge, Where rosebowers shone between the willows grey, The wondering bearers bore their heavy charge; And where the central shadow thickest lay He bade them delve a pit, and delve it deep Till watersprings against their strokes should leap. XIX Then waved them to a distance, while he bowed Upon the coffer, hearkening for a space: If truth bought that poor wretch his bloody shroud, I bury thus her guilt and my disgrace; And you, as by the whole earth disavowed, Sink into nothingness and leave no trace: If not, it is a harmless whim enough To sepulchre a chest of household stuff. XX With face encircled by his hands, which leaned Upon the wood, he challenged clear and slow: The hollow sound, his full hot breath thus screened Suffused his visage with a tingling glow; His pulse, his vesture's rustling intervened And marred the silence: he drew back, and so Knelt listening yet awhile with bated breath: The secret lay as mute and still as death. XXI Above there in her chamber Weddah might Have leapt forth suddenly their foe to kill. Ev'n here with hazard of swift fight and flight Escaped or perished as a warrior still; But thus through him her name had suffered blight: He locked his breath and nerves with rigid will. So Walid first let sink his key unused, Then signed the slaves back: they wrought on, he mused XXII Against the dark bulk swelled the waters thin, The stones and earth were trampled to a mound. He then broke silence, stern and sad: Within That coffer ye have buried, sealed and bound, Lies one of the most potent evil djinn, Whose hate on me and mine hath darkly frowned; He sought to kill your mistress: Hell and Doom And Allah's curse all guard this dungeon-tomb! XXIII And Walid never spoke of this again, And none dared ask him; for his brow grew black His eye flamed evil and appalling when Some careless word but strayed upon a track That might from far lead to it: therefore men Spoke only of the thing behind his back. The cedar shadow centred by that mound Was sacredly eschewed as haunted ground. XXIV But one pale phantom, noon and night and morn, Was ever seen there; quiet as a stone, Huddled and shapeless, weeping tears forlorn As silent as the dews; her heart alone And not her lips, whose seal was never torn, Upbraiding sluggish death with constant moan. Hushed whispers circled, piteous eyes were wet; The captive djinnee holds her captive yet. XXV Thus Walid learned too well the bitter truth, His home dissolved, its marvellous joy a cheat; Yet gave no sign to her: for there was ruth Of memories gall itself left subtly sweet; And consciousness of wrong against her youth, And surfeit of a vengeance so complete: He could not stab her bleeding heart; her name With his own honour he kept pure from shame. XXVI She thought Death dead, or prisoned in deep Hell As sole assuager of the human lot: But when the evening of the seventh day fell Walid alone dared tread the fatal spot: She crouched as who would plunge into a well, Livid and writhed into a desperate knot; Her fingers clutched like talons in the mould: Thus the last time his arms about her fold. XXVII As if to glut the demon with her doom, And break the spell, there where her corse was found He had it buried; and a simple tomb Of black-domed marble sealed the dolorous mound; And there was set to guard the cedar gloom A triple cirque of cypress-trees around: Thus Love wrought Destiny to join his slaves Weddah and Om-el-Bonain in their graves. XXVIII True Amine, freed and richly dowered, no less Had served until the end her lady dear; And shrouded for the grave that loveliness Whose noon-eclipse left life without its peer: Then sought the Azra in her lone distress, And tended Abd-el-Aziz through the sere Forlorn last days; and married in the clan, And bore brave children to a valiant man. XXIX Great Walid lived long years beyond this woe, And still increased in wealth and power and glory; A loyal friend, a formidable foe; Each Azra was his mother's child saith story; And he saw goodly children round him grow To keep his name green when Death took him hoary: So prosperous, was he happy too? the sage Cites this one counsel of his reverend age: XXX Have brood-mares in your stables, my young friend, And women in your harem, but no wife: A common daggerblade may pierce or rend, A month bring healing; this, the choicest knife In Fate's whole armoury, wounds beyond amend, And with a scratch can poison all your life; And it lies naked in your naked breast When you are drunk with joy and sleep's rich rest. XXXI As surely as a very precious stone Finds out that jeweller who doth excel, So surely to the bard becometh known The tale which only he can fitly tell: A few years thence, and Walid's heart alone Had thrilled not to a talisman's great spell, His deathstone set in Hassan's golden verse; Here poorly copied in cheap bronze or worse. XXXII He ends: We know not which to most admire; The lover who went silent to his doom; The spouse obedient to her lord's just ire, The mistress faithful to her lover's tomb; The husband calm in jealousy's fierce fire, Who strode unswerving through the doubtful gloom To vengeance instant, secret and complete, And did not strike one blow more than was meet. XXXIII With stringent cords of circumstance dark Fate Doth certain lives here so entoil and mesh That some or all must strangle if they wait, And knife to cut the knots must cut quick flesh: The first strong arm free severs ere too late; Fresh writhings would but tangle it afresh: To die with valiant fortitude, to kill As priest not butcher; so much scope has will. XXXIV These perished, and he slew them, in such wise That all may meet as friends and free from shame, Whether they meet in Hell or Paradise. If he has won long life and power and fame, Our darlings too have won their own set prize, Conjoined for evermore in true love's name: The Azra die when they do love, of old Was graven with the iron pen, on gold. XXXV May Allah grant eternal joy and youth In fateless Heaven to one and all of these. And for himself a little grain of ruth The bard will beg, this once, while on his knees; Who cannot always see the very truth, And does not always sing the truth he sees, But something pleasanter to foolish ears That should be tickled not with straws but spears. 1868–9. TWO LOVERS Their eyes met; flashed an instant like swift swords That leapt unparrying to each other's heart, Jarring convulsion through the inmost chords; Then fell, for they had fully done their part. She, in the manner of her folk unveiled, Might have been veiled for all he saw of her; Those sudden eyes, from which he reeled and quailed; The old life dead, no new life yet astir. His good steed bore him onward slow and proud: And through the open lattice still she leant; Pale, still, though whirled in a black rushing cloud, As if on her fair flowers and dreams intent. Days passed, and he passed timid, furtive, slow: Nights came, and he came motionless and mute; A steadfast sentinel till morning-glow, Though blank her window, dumb her voice and lute. She loved: the Cross stretched rigid arms to scare Her soul from the perdition of that love; She saw Christ's wounds bleed when she knelt in prayer, And frown abhorrent all the saints above. He loved: the Crescent hung with sharp cold gleam, A scimitar to cleave such love in twain; The Prophet menaced in his waking dream, Livid and swoln with wrath that great brow-vein. Each sternly true to the immortal soul, Crushed down the passion of the mortal heart; Which bled away beneath the iron control, But inwardly: they die; none sees the smart. Thus long months went, until his time came round To leave that city terrible and dear; To go afar on soulless business bound, Perchance for absence of a whole dead year. No word: but as she knelt to pray one night, What was that silk thing pendant from the Cross? Half of a talisman of chrysolite: Farewell! Full triumph stunned like fatal loss. A sacred jewel-charm of sovereign power 'Gainst demons haunting soul and sense and brain, 'Gainst madness: had it not until that hour Despite love's impious frenzy kept him sane? Now let her look forth boldly day by day; He will not come to wound her with his eyes; Now at the open lattice darkling stay, Only the stars are watching from the skies; Now with clear spirit let her sing and pray; No human presence clouds her Lord's full light: Now let her weep and moan and waste away, With broken heart a-bleeding day and night. Thin as a spectre, haggard, taciturn, He reached his native city; there did all He had to do: indifferent yet stern, As one whose task must end ere evening-fall. Then sank, and knew that Azrael was near: The hard dull rage of impotent remorse Burned into passion that consumed old fear: He loathed his unlived life, his unspent force. “Must we be sundered, then, beyond the grave, By that which here has sundered us? Not so! I can be lost with her I cannot save, And with these Christian dogs to deep Hell go.” A priest baptized the sinking renegade, A priest assured him of the Heaven he spurned; His wealth for many a mass thereafter paid; And many a Moslem his example turned. A friend had sworn to do his last behest; To be his swift and faithful messenger: His own half talisman from his true breast Would seal the truth of all things told to her. The funeral over, while the stars yet shone Though pale in the new dawn, this friend forth-spurred; Brief rests, long stages, hurried fiercely on; Hating the errand, loyal to his word. Twenty days' travel done in thrice three days, He reached her city, found her mansion there; A crowd before it busy with amaze, Cries from within it wounding the sweet air. She was no more since that day's sun had set; But wonder outran grief; for ere she died Infinite yearning, fathomless regret, Flooded her soul and drowned its faith and pride. “Shall I be happy with the saints above, While he is burning in the paynim Hell? Here I have cheated him of all my love, But there with him I can for ever dwell.” So she renounced the Cross and threefold God, And died in Islam; whence the bruit was great. Silent the friend his backward journey trod, Silent, and shrouded with the sense of Fate. Thus in the very hour supreme of death These two great hearts first dared live perfect life; Drew inspiration with their failing breath, Snatched victory as they sank down slain in strife. And thus Fate mocked them, who when life was sweet Had kept apart, both famished to the core; Let them draw near and in the death-point meet, But to diverge for ever, evermore. Yet both died happy in self-sacrifice; A dolorous happiness, yet true and deep: And Gods and Fate and Hell and Paradise Perchance are one to their eternal sleep. Poor human hearts, that yearn beyond the tomb, Wherein you all must moulder into dust! What has the blank immitigable gloom Of light or fervour to reward your trust? Live out your whole free life while yet on earth; Seize the quick Present, prize your one sure boon; Though brief, each day a golden sun has birth; Though dim, the night is gemmed with stars and moon. Love out your cordial love, hate out your hate; Be strong to grasp a foe, to clasp a friend: Your wants true laws are; thirst and hunger sate: Feel you have been yourselves when comes the end. Let the great gods, if they indeed exist, Fight out their fight themselves; for they are strong: How can we puny mortals e'er assist? How judge the supra-mortal right and wrong? But if we made these gods, with all their strife, And not they us: what frenzy equals this; To starve, maim, poison, strangle our poor life, For empty shadows of death's dark abyss? This man and maiden claim a brother's tear, Martyrs of sweet love, killed by bitter faith; Defrauded by the Gods of glad life here, And mocked by Doom in their heroic death. 1867. TO OUR LADIES OF DEATH The Three Ladies suggested by the sublime sisterhood of Our Ladies of Sorrow, in the “Suspiria de Profundis” of De Quincey. “Tired with all these, for restful death I cry.” —Shakespeare: Sonnet 66. Weary of erring in this desert Life, Weary of hoping hopes for ever vain, Weary of struggling in all-sterile strife, Weary of thought which maketh nothing plain, I close my eyes and calm my panting breath, And pray to Thee, O ever-quiet Death! To come and soothe away my bitter pain. The strong shall strive,—may they be victors crowned; The wise still seek,—may they at length find Truth; The young still hope,—may purest love be found To make their age more glorious than their youth. For me; my brain is weak, my heart is cold, My hope and faith long dead; my life but bold In jest and laugh to parry hateful ruth. Over me pass the days and months and years Like squadrons and battalions of the foe Trampling with thoughtless thrusts and alien jeers Over a wounded soldier lying low: He grips his teeth, or flings them words of scorn To mar their triumph: but the while, outworn, Inwardly craves for death to end his woe. Thus I, in secret, call, O Death! to Thee, Thou Youngest of the solemn Sisterhood, Thou Gentlest of the mighty Sisters Three Whom I have known so well since first endued By Love and Grief with vision to discern What spiritual life doth throb and burn Through all our world, with evil powers and good. The Three whom I have known so long, so well, By intimate communion, face to face, In every mood, of Earth, of Heaven, of Hell, In every season and in every place, That joy of Life has ceased to visit me, As one estranged by powerful witchery, Infatuate in a Siren's weird embrace. First Thou, O priestess, prophetess, and queen, Our Lady of Beatitudes, first Thou: Of mighty stature, of seraphic mien, Upon the tablet of whose broad white brow Unvanquishable Truth is written clear, The secret of the mystery of our sphere, The regnant word of the Eternal Now. Thou standest garmented in purest white; But from thy shoulders wings of power half-spread Invest thy form with such miraculous light As dawn may clothe the earth with: and, instead Of any jewel-kindled golden crown, The glory of thy long hair flowing down Is dazzling noonday sunshine round thy head. Upon a sword thy left hand resteth calm, A naked sword, two-edged and long and straight; A branch of olive with a branch of palm Thy right hand proffereth to hostile Fate. The shining plumes that clothe thy feet are bound By knotted strings, as if to tread the ground With weary steps when thou wouldst soar elate. Twin heavens uplifted to the heavens, thine eyes Are solemn with unutterable thought And love and aspiration; yet there lies Within their light eternal sadness, wrought By hope deferred and baffled tenderness: Of all the souls whom thou dost love and bless, How few revere and love thee as they ought! Thou leadest heroes from their warfare here To nobler fields where grander crowns are won; Thou leadest sages from this twilight sphere To cloudless heavens and an unsetting sun; Thou leadest saints into that purer air Whose breath is spiritual life and prayer: Yet, lo! they seek thee not, but fear and shun! Thou takest to thy most maternal breast Young children from the desert of this earth, Ere sin hath stained their souls, or grief opprest, And bearest them unto an heavenly birth, To be the Vestals of God's Fane above: And yet their kindred moan against thy love, With wild and selfish moans in bitter dearth. Most holy Spirit, first Self-conqueror; Thou Victress over Time and Destiny And Evil, in the all-deciding war So fierce, so long, so dreadful!—Would that me Thou hadst upgathered in my life's pure morn! Unworthy then, less worthy now, forlorn, I dare not, Gracious Mother, call on Thee. Next Thou, O sibyl, sorceress and queen, Our Lady of Annihilation, Thou! Of mighty stature, of demoniac mien; Upon whose swarthy face and livid brow Are graven deeply anguish, malice, scorn, Strength ravaged by unrest, resolve forlorn Of any hope, dazed pride that will not bow. Thy form is clothed with wings of iron gloom; But round about thee, like a chain, is rolled, Cramping the sway of every mighty plume, A stark constringent serpent fold on fold: Of its two heads, one sting is in thy brain, The other in thy heart; their venom-pain Like fire distilling through thee uncontrolled. A rod of serpents wieldeth thy right hand; Thy left a cup of raging fire, whose light Burns lurid on thyself as thou dost stand; Thy lidless eyes tenebriously bright; Thy wings, thy vesture, thy dishevelled hair Dark as the Grave; thou statue of Despair, Thou Night essential radiating night. Thus have I seen thee in thine actual form; Not thus can see thee those whom thou dost sway, Inscrutable Enchantress: young and warm, Pard-beautiful and brilliant, ever gay; Thy cup the very Wine of Life, thy rod The wand of more voluptuous spells than God Can wield in Heaven; thus charmest thou thy prey. The selfish, fatuous, proud, and pitiless, All who have falsified life's royal trust; The strong whose strength hath basked in idleness, The great heart given up to worldly lust, The great mind destitute of moral faith; Thou scourgest down to Night and utter Death, Or penal spheres of retribution just. O mighty Spirit, fraudful and malign, Demon of madness and perversity! The evil passions which may make me thine Are not yet irrepressible in me; And I have pierced thy mask of riant youth, And seen thy form in all its hideous truth: I will not, Dreadful Mother, call on Thee. Last Thou, retirèd nun and throneless queen, Our Lady of Oblivion, last Thou: Of human stature, of abstracted mien; Upon whose pallid face and drooping brow Are shadowed melancholy dreams of Doom, And deep absorption into silent gloom, And weary bearing of the heavy Now. Thou art all shrouded in a gauzy veil, Sombrous and cloudlike; all, except that face Of subtle loveliness though weirdly pale. Thy soft, slow-gliding footsteps leave no trace, And stir no sound. Thy drooping hands infold Their frail white fingers; and, unconscious, hold A poppy-wreath, thine anodyne of grace. Thy hair is like a twilight round thy head: Thine eyes are shadowed wells, from Lethe-stream With drowsy subterranean waters fed; Obscurely deep, without a stir or gleam; The gazer drinks in from them with his gaze An opiate charm to curtain all his days, A passive languor of oblivious dream. Thou hauntest twilight regions, and the trance Of moonless nights when stars are few and wan: Within black woods; or over the expanse Of desert seas abysmal; or upon Old solitary shores whose populous graves Are rocked in rest by ever-moaning waves; Or through vast ruined cities still and lone. The weak, the weary, and the desolate, The poor, the mean, the outcast, the opprest, All trodden down beneath the march of Fate, Thou gatherest, loving Sister, to thy breast, Soothing their pain and weariness asleep; Then in thy hidden Dreamland hushed and deep Dost lay them, shrouded in eternal rest. O sweetest Sister, and sole Patron Saint Of all the humble eremites who flee From out life's crowded tumult, stunned and faint, To seek a stern and lone tranquillity In Libyan wastes of time: my hopeless life With famished yearning craveth rest from strife; Therefore, thou Restful One, I call on Thee! Take me, and lull me into perfect sleep; Down, down, far-hidden in thy duskiest cave; While all the clamorous years above me sweep Unheard, or, like the voice of seas that rave On far-off coasts, but murmuring o'er my trance, A dim vast monotone, that shall enhance The restful rapture of the inviolate grave. Upgathered thus in thy divine embrace, Upon mine eyes thy soft mesmeric hand, While wreaths of opiate odour interlace About my pulseless brow; babe-pure and bland, Passionless, senseless, thoughtless, let me dream Some ever-slumbrous, never-varying theme, Within the shadow of thy Timeless Land. That when I thus have drunk my inmost fill Of perfect peace, I may arise renewed; In soul and body, intellect and will, Equal to cope with Life whate'er its mood; To sway its storm and energise its calm; Through rhythmic years evolving like a psalm Of infinite love and faith and sanctitude. But if this cannot be, no less I cry, Come, lead me with thy terrorless control Down to our Mother's bosom, there to die By abdication of my separate soul: So shall this single, self-impelling piece Of mechanism from lone labour cease, Resolving into union with the Whole. Our Mother feedeth thus our little life, That we in turn may feed her with our death: The great Sea sways, one interwoven strife, Wherefrom the Sun exhales a subtle breath, To float the heavens sublime in form and hue, Then turning cold and dark in order due Rain weeping back to swell the Sea beneath. One part of me shall feed a little worm, And it a bird on which a man may feed; One lime the mould, one nourish insect-sperm; One thrill sweet grass, one pulse in bitter weed; This swell a fruit, and that evolve in air; Another trickle to a springlet's lair, Another paint a daisy on the mead: With cosmic interchange of parts for all, Through all the modes of being numberless Of every element, as may befall. And if earth's general soul hath consciousness, Their new life must with strange new joy be thrilled, Of perfect law all perfectly fulfilled; No sin, no fear, no failure, no excess. Weary of living isolated life, Weary of hoping hopes for ever vain, Weary of struggling in all-sterile strife, Weary of thought which maketh nothing plain, I close my eyes and hush my panting breath, And yearn for Thee, divinely tranquil Death, To come and soothe away my bitter pain. 1861. THE CITY OF DREADFUL NIGHT “Per me si va nella città dolente.” —Dante. “Poi di tanto adoprar, di tanti moti D'ogni celeste, ogni terrena cosa, Girando senza posa, Per tornar sempre là donde son mosse; Uso alcuno, alcun frutto Indovinar non so.” “Sola nel mondo eterna, a cui si volve Ogni creata cosa, In te, morte, si posa Nostra ignuda natura; Lieta no, ma sicura Dell' antico dolor. . . Però ch' esser beato Nega ai mortali e nega a' morti il fato.” —Leopardi. Proem. Lo, thus, as prostrate, “In the dust I write My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.” Yet why evoke the spectres of black night To blot the sunshine of exultant years? Why disinter dead faith from mouldering hidden? Why break the seals of mute despair unbidden, And wail life's discords into careless ears? Because a cold rage seizes one at whiles To show the bitter old and wrinkled truth Stripped naked of all vesture that beguiles, False dreams, false hopes, false masks and modes of youth; Because it gives some sense of power and passion In helpless impotence to try to fashion Our woe in living words howe'er uncouth. Surely I write not for the hopeful young, Or those who deem their happiness of worth, Or such as pasture and grow fat among The shows of life and feel nor doubt nor dearth, Or pious spirits with a God above them To sanctify and glorify and love them, Or sages who foresee a heaven on earth. For none of these I write, and none of these Could read the writing if they deigned to try: So may they flourish, in their due degrees, On our sweet earth and in their unplaced sky. If any cares for the weak words here written, It must be some one desolate, Fate-smitten, Whose faith and hope are dead, and who would die. Yes, here and there some weary wanderer In that same city of tremendous night, Will understand the speech, and feel a stir Of fellowship in all-disastrous fight; “I suffer mute and lonely, yet another Uplifts his voice to let me know a brother Travels the same wild paths though out of sight.” O sad Fraternity, do I unfold Your dolorous mysteries shrouded from of yore? Nay, be assured; no secret can be told To any who divined it not before: None uninitiate by many a presage Will comprehend the language of the message, Although proclaimed aloud for evermore. I. The City is of Night; perchance of Death, But certainly of Night; for never there Can come the lucid morning's fragrant breath After the dewy dawning's cold grey air; The moon and stars may shine with scorn or pity; The sun has never visited that city, For it dissolveth in the daylight fair. Dissolveth like a dream of night away; Though present in distempered gloom of thought And deadly weariness of heart all day. But when a dream night after night is brought Throughout a week, and such weeks few or many Recur each year for several years, can any Discern that dream from real life in aught? For life is but a dream whose shapes return, Some frequently, some seldom, some by night And some by day, some night and day: we learn, The while all change and many vanish quite, In their recurrence with recurrent changes A certain seeming order; where this ranges We count things real; such is memory's might. A river girds the city west and south, The main north channel of a broad lagoon, Regurging with the salt tides from the mouth; Waste marshes shine and glister to the moon For leagues, then moorland black, then stony ridges; Great piers and causeways, many noble bridges, Connect the town and islet suburbs strewn. Upon an easy slope it lies at large, And scarcely overlaps the long curved crest Which swells out two leagues from the river marge. A trackless wilderness rolls north and west, Savannahs, savage woods, enormous mountains, Bleak uplands, black ravines with torrent fountains; And eastward rolls the shipless sea's unrest. The city is not ruinous, although Great ruins of an unremembered past, With others of a few short years ago More sad, are found within its precincts vast. The street-lamps always burn; but scarce a casement In house or palace front from roof to basement Doth glow or gleam athwart the mirk air cast. The street-lamps burn amidst the baleful glooms, Amidst the soundless solitudes immense Of rangèd mansions dark and still as tombs. The silence which benumbs or strains the sense Fulfils with awe the soul's despair unweeping: Myriads of habitants are ever sleeping, Or dead, or fled from nameless pestilence! Yet as in some necropolis you find Perchance one mourner to a thousand dead, So there; worn faces that look deaf and blind Like tragic masks of stone. With weary tread, Each wrapt in his own doom, they wander, wander, Or sit foredone and desolately ponder Through sleepless hours with heavy drooping head. Mature men chiefly, few in age or youth, A woman rarely, now and then a child: A child! If here the heart turns sick with ruth To see a little one from birth defiled, Or lame or blind, as preordained to languish Through youthless life, think how it bleeds with anguish To meet one erring in that homeless wild. They often murmur to themselves, they speak To one another seldom, for their woe Broods maddening inwardly and scorns to wreak Itself abroad; and if at whiles it grow To frenzy which must rave, none heeds the clamour, Unless there waits some victim of like glamour, To rave in turn, who lends attentive show. The City is of Night, but not of Sleep; There sweet sleep is not for the weary brain; The pitiless hours like years and ages creep, A night seems termless hell. This dreadful strain Of thought and consciousness which never ceases, Or which some moments' stupor but increases, This, worse than woe, makes wretches there insane. They leave all hope behind who enter there: One certitude while sane they cannot leave, One anodyne for torture and despair; The certitude of Death, which no reprieve Can put off long; and which, divinely tender, But waits the outstretched hand to promptly render That draught whose slumber nothing can bereave. Though the Garden of thy Life be wholly waste, the sweet flowers withered, the fruit-trees barren, over its wall hang ever the rich dark clusters of the Vine of Death, within easy reach of thy hand, which may pluck of them when it will. II. Because he seemed to walk with an intent I followed him; who, shadowlike and frail, Unswervingly though slowly onward went, Regardless, wrapt in thought as in a veil: Thus step for step with lonely sounding feet We travelled many a long dim silent street. At length he paused: a black mass in the gloom, A tower that merged into the heavy sky; Around, the huddled stones of grave and tomb: Some old God's-acre now corruption's sty: He murmured to himself with dull despair, Here Faith died, poisoned by this charnel air. Then turning to the right went on once more, And travelled weary roads without suspense; And reached at last a low wall's open door, Whose villa gleamed beyond the foliage dense: He gazed, and muttered with a hard despair, Here Love died, stabbed by its own worshipped pair. Then turning to the right resumed his march, And travelled streets and lanes with wondrous strength, Until on stooping through a narrow arch We stood before a squalid house at length: He gazed, and whispered with a cold despair, Here Hope died, starved out in its utmost lair. When he had spoken thus, before he stirred, I spoke, perplexed by something in the signs Of desolation I had seen and heard In this drear pilgrimage to ruined shrines: When Faith and Love and Hope are dead indeed, Can Life still live? By what doth it proceed? As whom his one intense thought overpowers, He answered coldly, Take a watch, erase The signs and figures of the circling hours, Detach the hands, remove the dial-face; The works proceed until run down; although Bereft of purpose, void of use, still go. Then turning to the right paced on again, And traversed squares and travelled streets whose glooms Seemed more and more familiar to my ken; And reached that sullen temple of the tombs; And paused to murmur with the old despair, Here Faith died, poisoned by this charnel air. I ceased to follow, for the knot of doubt Was severed sharply with a cruel knife: He circled thus for ever tracing out The series of the fraction left of Life; Perpetual recurrence in the scope Of but three terms, dead Faith, dead Love, dead Hope. Life divided by that persistent three=LXX/333=210. III. Although lamps burn along the silent streets; Even when moonlight silvers empty squares The dark holds countless lanes and close retreats; But when the night its sphereless mantle wears The open spaces yawn with gloom abysmal, The sombre mansions loom immense and dismal, The lanes are black as subterranean lairs. And soon the eye a strange new vision learns: The night remains for it as dark and dense, Yet clearly in this darkness it discerns As in the daylight with its natural sense; Perceives a shade in shadow not obscurely, Pursues a stir of black in blackness surely, Sees spectres also in the gloom intense. The ear, too, with the silence vast and deep Becomes familiar though unreconciled; Hears breathings as of hidden life asleep, And muffled throbs as of pent passions wild, Far murmurs, speech of pity or derision; But all more dubious than the things of vision, So that it knows not when it is beguiled. No time abates the first despair and awe, But wonder ceases soon; the weirdest thing Is felt least strange beneath the lawless law Where Death-in-Life is the eternal king; Crushed impotent beneath this reign of terror, Dazed with such mysteries of woe and error, The soul is too outworn for wondering. IV. He stood alone within the spacious square Declaiming from the central grassy mound, With head uncovered and with streaming hair, As if large multitudes were gathered round: A stalwart shape, the gestures full of might, The glances burning with unnatural light:— As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: All was black, In heaven no single star, on earth no track; A brooding hush without a stir or note, The air so thick it clotted in my throat; And thus for hours; then some enormous things Swooped past with savage cries and clanking wings: But I strode on austere; No hope could have no fear. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: Eyes of fire Glared at me throbbing with a starved desire; The hoarse and heavy and carnivorous breath Was hot upon me from deep jaws of death; Sharp claws, swift talons, fleshless fingers cold Plucked at me from the bushes, tried to hold: But I strode on austere; No hope could have no fear. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: Lo you, there, That hillock burning with a brazen glare; Those myriad dusky flames with points a-glow Which writhed and hissed and darted to and fro; A Sabbath of the Serpents, heaped pell-mell For Devil's roll-call and some fête of Hell: Yet I strode on austere; No hope could have no fear. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: Meteors ran And crossed their javelins on the black sky-span; The zenith opened to a gulf of flame, The dreadful thunderbolts jarred earth's fixed frame; The ground all heaved in waves of fire that surged And weltered round me sole there unsubmerged: Yet I strode on austere; No hope could have no fear. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: Air once more, And I was close upon a wild sea-shore; Enormous cliffs arose on either hand, The deep tide thundered up a league-broad strand; White foambelts seethed there, wan spray swept and flew; The sky broke, moon and stars and clouds and blue: And I strode on austere; No hope could have no fear. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: On the left The sun arose and crowned a broad crag-cleft; There stopped and burned out black, except a rim, A bleeding eyeless socket, red and dim; Whereon the moon fell suddenly south-west, And stood above the right-hand cliffs at rest: Still I strode on austere; No hope could have no fear. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: From the right A shape came slowly with a ruddy light; A woman with a red lamp in her hand, Bareheaded and barefooted on that strand; O desolation moving with such grace! O anguish with such beauty in thy face! I fell as on my bier, Hope travailed with such fear. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: I was twain, Two selves distinct that cannot join again; One stood apart and knew but could not stir, And watched the other stark in swoon and her; And she came on, and never turned aside, Between such sun and moon and roaring tide: And as she came more near My soul grew mad with fear. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: Hell is mild And piteous matched with that accursèd wild; A large black sign was on her breast that bowed, A broad blackband ran down her snow-white shroud; That lamp she held was her own burning heart, Whose blood-drops trickled step by step apart: The mystery was clear; Mad rage had swallowed fear. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: By the sea She knelt and bent above that senseless me; Those lamp-drops fell upon my white brow there, She tried to cleanse them with her tears and hair; She murmured words of pity, love, and woe, She heeded not the level rushing flow: And mad with rage and fear, I stood stonebound so near. As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: When the tide Swept up to her there kneeling by my side, She clasped that corpse-like me, and they were borne Away, and this vile me was left forlorn; I know the whole sea cannot quench that heart, Or cleanse that brow, or wash those two apart: They love; their doom is drear, Yet they nor hope nor fear; But I, what do I here? V. How he arrives there none can clearly know: Athwart the mountains and immense wild tracts, Or flung a waif upon that vast sea-flow, Or down the river's boiling cataracts: To reach it is as dying fever-stricken; To leave it, slow faint birth intense pangs quicken; And memory swoons in both the tragic acts. But being there one feels a citizen; Escape seems hopeless to the heart forlorn: Can Death-in-Life be brought to life again? And yet release does come; there comes a morn When he awakes from slumbering so sweetly That all the world is changed for him completely, And he is verily as if new-born. He scarcely can believe the blissful change, He weeps perchance who wept not while accurst; Never again will he approach the range Infected by that evil spell now burst: Poor wretch! who once hath paced that dolent city Shall pace it often, doomed beyond all pity, With horror ever deepening from the first. Though he possess sweet babes and loving wife, A home of peace by loyal friendships cheered, And love them more than death or happy life, They shall avail not; he must dree his weird; Renounce all blessings for that imprecation, Steal forth and haunt that builded desolation, Of woe and terrors and thick darkness reared: VI. I sat forlornly by the river-side, And watched the bridge-lamps glow like golden stars Above the blackness of the swelling tide, Down which they struck rough gold in ruddier bars; And heard the heave and plashing of the flow Against the wall a dozen feet below. Large elm-trees stood along that river-walk; And under one, a few steps from my seat, I heard strange voices join in stranger talk, Although I had not heard approaching feet: These bodiless voices in my waking dream Flowed dark words blending with the sombre stream:— And you have after all come back; come back. I was about to follow on your track. And you have failed: our spark of hope is black. That I have failed is proved by my return: The spark is quenched, nor ever more will burn. But listen; and the story you shall learn. I reached the portal common spirits fear, And read the words above it, dark yet clear, “Leave hope behind, all ye who enter here:” And would have passed in, gratified to gain That positive eternity of pain, Instead of this insufferable inane. A demon warder clutched me, Not so fast; First leave your hopes behind!—But years have passed Since I left all behind me, to the last: You cannot count for hope, with all your wit, This bleak despair that drives me to the Pit: How could I seek to enter void of it? He snarled, What thing is this which apes a soul, And would find entrance to our gulf of dole Without the payment of the settled toll? Outside the gate he showed an open chest: Here pay their entrance fees the souls unblest; Cast in some hope, you enter with the rest. This is Pandora's box; whose lid shall shut, And Hell-gate too, when hopes have filled it; but They are so thin that it will never glut. I stood a few steps backwards, desolate; And watched the spirits pass me to their fate, And fling off hope, and enter at the gate. When one casts off a load he springs upright, Squares back his shoulders, breathes with all his might, And briskly paces forward strong and light: But these, as if they took some burden, bowed; The whole frame sank; however strong and proud Before, they crept in quite infirm and cowed. And as they passed me, earnestly from each A morsel of his hope I did beseech, To pay my entrance; but all mocked my speech. Not one would cede a tittle of his store, Though knowing that in instants three or four He must resign the whole for evermore. So I returned. Our destiny is fell; For in this Limbo we must ever dwell, Shut out alike from Heaven and Earth and Hell. The other sighed back, Yea; but if we grope With care through all this Limbo's dreary scope, We yet may pick up some minute lost hope; And, sharing it between us, entrance win, In spite of fiends so jealous for gross sin: Let us without delay our search begin. VII. Some say that phantoms haunt those shadowy streets, And mingle freely there with sparse mankind; And tell of ancient woes and black defeats, And murmur mysteries in the grave enshrined: But others think them visions of illusion, Or even men gone far in self-confusion; No man there being wholly sane in mind. And yet a man who raves, however mad, Who bares his heart and tells of his own fall, Reserves some inmost secret good or bad: The phantoms have no reticence at all: The nudity of flesh will blush though tameless, The extreme nudity of bone grins shameless, The unsexed skeleton mocks shroud and pall. I have seen phantoms there that were as men And men that were as phantoms flit and roam; Marked shapes that were not living to my ken, Caught breathings acrid as with Dead Sea foam: The City rests for man so weird and awful, That his intrusion there might seem unlawful, And phantoms there may have their proper home. VIII. While I still lingered on that river-walk, And watched the tide as black as our black doom, I heard another couple join in talk, And saw them to the left hand in the gloom Seated against an elm bole on the ground, Their eyes intent upon the stream profound. “I never knew another man on earth But had some joy and solace in his life, Some chance of triumph in the dreadful strife: My doom has been unmitigated dearth.” “We gaze upon the river, and we note The various vessels large and small that float, Ignoring every wrecked and sunken boat.” “And yet I asked no splendid dower, no spoil Of sway or fame or rank or even wealth; But homely love with common food and health, And nightly sleep to balance daily toil.” “This all-too humble soul would arrogate Unto itself some signalising hate From the supreme indifference of Fate!” “Who is most wretched in this dolorous place? I think myself; yet I would rather be My miserable self than He, than He Who formed such creatures to His own disgrace. “The vilest thing must be less vile than Thou From whom it had its being, God and Lord! Creator of all woe and sin! abhorred, Malignant and implacable! I vow “That not for all Thy power furled and unfurled, For all the temples to Thy glory built, Would I assume the ignominious guilt Of having made such men in such a world.” “As if a Being, God or Fiend, could reign, At once so wicked, foolish, and insane, As to produce men when He might refrain! “The world rolls round for ever like a mill; It grinds out death and life and good and ill; It has no purpose, heart or mind or will. “While air of Space and Time's full river flow The mill must blindly whirl unresting so: It may be wearing out, but who can know? “Man might know one thing were his sight less dim; That it whirls not to suit his petty whim, That it is quite indifferent to him. “Nay, does it treat him harshly as he saith? It grinds him some slow years of bitter breath, Then grinds him back into eternal death.” IX. It is full strange to him who hears and feels, When wandering there in some deserted street, The booming and the jar of ponderous wheels, The trampling clash of heavy ironshod feet: Who in this Venice of the Black Sea rideth? Who in this city of the stars abideth To buy or sell as those in daylight sweet? The rolling thunder seems to fill the sky As it comes on; the horses snort and strain, The harness jingles, as it passes by; The hugeness of an overburthened wain: A man sits nodding on the shaft or trudges Three parts asleep beside his fellow-drudges: And so it rolls into the night again. What merchandise? whence, whither, and for whom? Perchance it is a Fate-appointed hearse, Bearing away to some mysterious tomb Or Limbo of the scornful universe The joy, the peace, the life-hope, the abortions Of all things good which should have been our portions, But have been strangled by that City's curse. X. The mansion stood apart in its own ground; In front thereof a fragrant garden-lawn, High trees about it, and the whole walled round: The massy iron gates were both withdrawn; And every window of its front shed light, Portentous in that City of the Night. But though thus lighted it was deadly still As all the countless bulks of solid gloom: Perchance a congregation to fulfil Solemnities of silence in this doom, Mysterious rites of dolour and despair Permitting not a breath of chant or prayer? Broad steps ascended to a terrace broad Whereon lay still light from the open door; The hall was noble, and its aspect awed, Hung round with heavy black from dome to floor; And ample stairways rose to left and right Whose balustrades were also draped with night. I paced from room to room, from hall to hall, Nor any life throughout the maze discerned; But each was hung with its funereal pall, And held a shrine, around which tapers burned, With picture or with statue or with bust, All copied from the same fair form of dust: A woman very young and very fair; Beloved by bounteous life and joy and youth, And loving these sweet lovers, so that care And age and death seemed not for her in sooth: Alike as stars, all beautiful and bright, These shapes lit up that mausoléan night. At length I heard a murmur as of lips, And reached an open oratory hung With heaviest blackness of the whole eclipse; Beneath the dome a fuming censer swung; And one lay there upon a low white bed, With tapers burning at the foot and head: The Lady of the images: supine, Deathstill, lifesweet, with folded palms she lay: And kneeling there as at a sacred shrine A young man wan and worn who seemed to pray: A crucifix of dim and ghostly white Surmounted the large altar left in night:— The chambers of the mansion of my heart, In every one whereof thine image dwells, Are black with grief eternal for thy sake. The inmost oratory of my soul, Wherein thou ever dwellest quick or dead, Is black with grief eternal for thy sake. I kneel beside thee and I clasp the cross, With eyes for ever fixed upon that face, So beautiful and dreadful in its calm. I kneel here patient as thou liest there; As patient as a statue carved in stone, Of adoration and eternal grief. While thou dost not awake I cannot move; And something tells me thou wilt never wake, And I alive feel turning into stone. Most beautiful were Death to end my grief, Most hateful to destroy the sight of thee, Dear vision better than all death or life. But I renounce all choice of life or death, For either shall be ever at thy side, And thus in bliss or woe be ever well.— He murmured thus and thus in monotone, Intent upon that uncorrupted face, Entranced except his moving lips alone: I glided with hushed footsteps from the place. This was the festival that filled with light That palace in the City of the Night. XI. What men are they who haunt these fatal glooms, And fill their living mouths with dust of death, And make their habitations in the tombs, And breathe eternal sighs with mortal breath, And pierce life's pleasant veil of various error To reach that void of darkness and old terror Wherein expire the lamps of hope and faith? They have much wisdom yet they are not wise, They have much goodness yet they do not well, (The fools we know have their own Paradise, The wicked also have their proper Hell); They have much strength but still their doom is stronger, Much patience but their time endureth longer, Much valour but life mocks it with some spell. They are most rational and yet insane: An outward madness not to be controlled; A perfect reason in the central brain, Which has no power, but sitteth wan and cold, And sees the madness, and foresees as plainly The ruin in its path, and trieth vainly To cheat itself refusing to behold. And some are great in rank and wealth and power, And some renowned for genius and for worth; And some are poor and mean, who brood and cower And shrink from notice, and accept all dearth Of body, heart and soul, and leave to others All boons of life: yet these and those are brothers, The saddest and the weariest men on earth. XII. Our isolated units could be brought To act together for some common end? For one by one, each silent with his thought, I marked a long loose line approach and wend Athwart the great cathedral's cloistered square, And slowly vanish from the moonlit air. Then I would follow in among the last: And in the porch a shrouded figure stood, Who challenged each one pausing ere he passed, With deep eyes burning through a blank white hood: Whence come you in the world of life and light To this our City of Tremendous Night?— From pleading in a senate of rich lords For some scant justice to our countless hordes Who toil half-starved with scarce a human right: I wake from daydreams to this real night. From wandering through many a solemn scene Of opium visions, with a heart serene And intellect miraculously bright: I wake from daydreams to this real night. From making hundreds laugh and roar with glee By my transcendent feats of mimicry, And humour wanton as an elfish sprite: I wake from daydreams to this real night. From prayer and fasting in a lonely cell, Which brought an ecstasy ineffable Of love and adoration and delight: I wake from daydreams to this real night. From ruling on a splendid kingly throne A nation which beneath my rule has grown Year after year in wealth and arts and might: I wake from daydreams to this real night. From preaching to an audience fired with faith The Lamb who died to save our souls from death, Whose blood hath washed our scarlet sins wool-white: I wake from daydreams to this real night. From drinking fiery poison in a den Crowded with tawdry girls and squalid men, Who hoarsely laugh and curse and brawl and fight: I wake from daydreams to this real night. From picturing with all beauty and all grace First Eden and the parents of our race, A luminous rapture unto all men's sight: I wake from daydreams to this real night. From writing a great work with patient plan To justify the ways of God to man, And show how ill must fade and perish quite: I wake from daydreams to this real night. From desperate fighting with a little band Against the powerful tyrants of our land, To free our brethren in their own despite: I wake from daydreams to this real night. Thus, challenged by that warder sad and stern, Each one responded with his countersign, Then entered the cathedral; and in turn I entered also, having given mine; But lingered near until I heard no more, And marked the closing of the massive door. XIII. Of all things human which are strange and wild This is perchance the wildest and most strange, And showeth man most utterly beguiled, To those who haunt that sunless City's range; That he bemoans himself for aye, repeating How time is deadly swift, how life is fleeting, How naught is constant on the earth but change. The hours are heavy on him and the days; The burden of the months he scarce can bear; And often in his secret soul he prays To sleep through barren periods unaware, Arousing at some longed-for date of pleasure; Which having passed and yielded him small treasure, He would outsleep another term of care. Yet in his marvellous fancy he must make Quick wings for Time, and see it fly from us; This Time which crawleth like a monstrous snake, Wounded and slow and very venomous; Which creeps blindwormlike round the earth and ocean, Distilling poison at each painful motion, And seems condemned to circle ever thus. And since he cannot spend and use aright The little time here given him in trust, But wasteth it in weary undelight Of foolish toil and trouble, strife and lust He naturally claimeth to inherit The everlasting Future, that his merit May have full scope; as surely is most just. O length of the intolerable hours, O nights that are as æons of slow pain, O Time, too ample for our vital powers, O Life, whose woeful vanities remain Immutable for all of all our legions Through all the centuries and in all the regions, Not of your speed and variance we complain. We do not ask a longer term of strife, Weakness and weariness and nameless woes; We do not claim renewed and endless life When this which is our torment here shall close, An everlasting conscious inanition! We yearn for speedy death in full fruition, Dateless oblivion and divine repose. XIV. Large glooms were gathered in the mighty fane, With tinted moongleams slanting here and there; And all was hush: no swelling organ-strain, No chant, no voice or murmuring of prayer; No priests came forth, no tinkling censers fumed, And the high altar space was unillumed. Around the pillars and against the walls Leaned men and shadows; others seemed to brood Bent or recumbent in secluded stalls. Perchance they were not a great multitude Save in that city of so lonely streets Where one may count up every face he meets. All patiently awaited the event Without a stir or sound, as if no less Self-occupied, doomstricken, while attent. And then we heard a voice of solemn stress From the dark pulpit, and our gaze there met Two eyes which burned as never eyes burned yet: Two steadfast and intolerable eyes Burning beneath a broad and rugged brow; The head behind it of enormous size. And as black fir-groves in a large wind bow, Our rooted congregation, gloom-arrayed, By that great sad voice deep and full were swayed:— O melancholy Brothers, dark, dark, dark! O battling in black stoods without an ark! O spectral wanderers of unholy Night! My soul hath bled for you these sunless years, With bitter blood-drops running down like tears: Oh, dark, dark, dark, withdrawn from joy and light! My heart is sick with anguish for your bale; Your woe hath been my anguish; yea, I quail And perish in your perishing unblest. And I have searched the highths and depths, the scope Of all our universe, with desperate hope To find some solace for your wild unrest. And now at last authentic word I bring, Witnessed by every dead and living thing; Good tidings of great joy for you, for all: There is no God; no Fiend with names divine Made us and tortures us; if we must pine, It is to satiate no Being's gall. It was the dark delusion of a dream, That living Person conscious and supreme, Whom we must curse for cursing us with life; Whom we must curse because the life He gave Could not be buried in the quiet grave, Could not be killed by poison or by knife. This little life is all we must endure, The grave's most holy peace is ever sure, We fall asleep and never wake again; Nothing is of us but the mouldering flesh, Whose elements dissolve and merge afresh In earth, air, water, plants, and other men. We finish thus; and all our wretched race Shall finish with its cycle, and give place To other beings, with their own time-doom: Infinite æons ere our kind began; Infinite æons after the last man Has joined the mammoth in earth's tomb and womb. We bow down to the universal laws, Which never had for man a special clause Of cruelty or kindness, love or hate: If toads and vultures are obscene to sight, If tigers burn with beauty and with might, Is it by favour or by wrath of fate? All substance lives and struggles evermore Through countless shapes continually at war, By countless interactions interknit: If one is born a certain day on earth, All times and forces tended to that birth, Not all the world could change or hinder it. I find no hint throughout the Universe Of good or ill, of blessing or of curse; I find alone Necessity Supreme; With infinite Mystery, abysmal, dark, Unlighted ever by the faintest spark For us the flitting shadows of a dream. O Brothers of sad lives! they are so brief; A few short years must bring us all relief: Can we not bear these years of labouring breath? But if you would not this poor life fulfil, Lo, you are free to end it when you will, Without the fear of waking after death.— The organ-like vibrations of his voice Thrilled through the vaulted aisles and died away; The yearning of the tones which bade rejoice Was sad and tender as a requiem lay: Our shadowy congregation rested still As brooding on that “End it when you will.” XV. Wherever men are gathered, all the air Is charged with human feeling, human thought; Each shout and cry and laugh, each curse and prayer, Are into its vibrations surely wrought; Unspoken passion, wordless meditation, Are breathed into it with our respiration; It is with our life fraught and overfraught. So that no man there breathes earth's simple breath, As if alone on mountains or wide seas; But nourishes warm life or hastens death With joys and sorrows, health and foul disease, Wisdom and folly, good and evil labours, Incessant of his multitudinous neighbours; He in his turn affecting all of these. That City's atmosphere is dark and dense, Although not many exiles wander there, With many a potent evil influence, Each adding poison to the poisoned air; Infections of unutterable sadness, Infections of incalculable madness, Infections of incurable despair. XVI. Our shadowy congregation rested still, As musing on that message we had heard And brooding on that “End it when you will;” Perchance awaiting yet some other word; When keen as lightning through a muffled sky Sprang forth a shrill and lamentable cry:— The man speaks sooth, alas! the man speaks sooth: We have no personal life beyond the grave; There is no God; Fate knows nor wrath nor ruth: Can I find here the comfort which I crave? In all eternity I had one chance, One few years' term of gracious human life: The splendours of the intellect's advance, The sweetness of the home with babes and wife; The social pleasures with their genial wit; The fascination of the worlds of art, The glories of the worlds of nature, lit By large imagination's glowing heart; The rapture of mere being, full of health; The careless childhood and the ardent youth, The strenuous manhood winning various wealth, The reverend age serene with life's long truth: All the sublime prerogatives of Man; The storied memories of the times of old, The patient tracking of the world's great plan Through sequences and changes myriadfold. This chance was never offered me before; For me the infinite Past is blank and dumb: This chance recurreth never, nevermore; Blank, blank for me the infinite To-come. And this sole chance was frustrate from my birth, A mockery, a delusion; and my breath Of noble human life upon this earth So racks me that I sigh for senseless death. My wine of life is poison mixed with gall, My noonday passes in a nightmare dream, I worse than lose the years which are my all: What can console me for the loss supreme? Speak not of comfort where no comfort is, Speak not at all: can words make foul things fair? Our life's a cheat, our death a black abyss: Hush and be mute envisaging despair.— This vehement voice came from the northern aisle Rapid and shrill to its abrupt harsh close; And none gave answer for a certain while, For words must shrink from these most wordless woes; At last the pulpit speaker simply said, With humid eyes and thoughtful drooping head:— My Brother, my poor Brothers, it is thus; This life itself holds nothing good for us, But it ends soon and nevermore can be; And we knew nothing of it ere our birth, And shall know nothing when consigned to earth: I ponder these thoughts and they comfort me. XVII. How the moon triumphs through the endless nights! How the stars throb and glitter as they wheel Their thick processions of supernal lights Around the blue vault obdurate as steel! And men regard with passionate awe and yearning The mighty marching and the golden burning, And think the heavens respond to what they feel. Boats gliding like dark shadows of a dream, Are glorified from vision as they pass The quivering moonbridge on the deep black stream; Cold windows kindle their dead glooms of glass To restless crystals; cornice, dome, and column Emerge from chaos in the splendour solemn; Like faëry lakes gleam lawns of dewy grass. With such a living light these dead eyes shine, These eyes of sightless heaven, that as we gaze We read a pity, tremulous, divine, Or cold majestic scorn in their pure rays: Fond man! they are not haughty, are not tender; There is no heart or mind in all their splendour, They thread mere puppets all their marvellous maze. If we could near them with the flight unflown, We should but find them worlds as sad as this, Or suns all self-consuming like our own Enringed by planet worlds as much amiss: They wax and wane through fusion and confusion; The spheres eternal are a grand illusion, The empyréan is a void abyss. XVIII. I wandered in a suburb of the north, And reached a spot whence three close lanes led down, Beneath thick trees and hedgerows winding forth Like deep brook channels, deep and dark and lown: The air above was wan with misty light, The dull grey south showed one vague blur of white. I took the left-hand lane and slowly trod Its earthen footpath, brushing as I went The humid leafage; and my feet were shod With heavy languor, and my frame downbent, With infinite sleepless weariness outworn, So many nights I thus had paced forlorn. After a hundred steps I grew aware Of something crawling in the lane below; It seemed a wounded creature prostrate there That sobbed with pangs in making progress slow, The hind limbs stretched to push, the fore limbs then To drag; for it would die in its own den. But coming level with it I discerned That it had been a man; for at my tread It stopped in its sore travail and half-turned, Leaning upon its right, and raised its head, And with the left hand twitched back as in ire Long grey unreverend locks befouled with mire. A haggard filthy face with bloodshot eyes, An infamy for manhood to behold. He gasped all trembling, What, you want my prize? You leave, to rob me, wine and lust and gold And all that men go mad upon, since you Have traced my sacred secret of the clue? You think that I am weak and must submit; Yet I but scratch you with this poisoned blade, And you are dead as if I clove with it That false fierce greedy heart. Betrayed! betrayed! I fling this phial if you seek to pass, And you are forthwith shrivelled up like grass. And then with sudden change, Take thought! take thought! Have pity on me! it is mine alone. If you could find, it would avail you naught; Seek elsewhere on the pathway of your own: For who of mortal or immortal race The lifetrack of another can retrace? Did you but know my agony and toil! Two lanes diverge up yonder from this lane; My thin blood marks the long length of their soil; Such clue I left, who sought my clue in vain: My hands and knees are worn both flesh and bone; I cannot move but with continual moan. But I am in the very way at last To find the long-lost broken golden thread Which reunites my present with my past, If you but go your own way. And I said, I will retire as soon as you have told Whereunto leadeth this lost thread of gold. And so you know it not! he hissed with scorn; I feared you, imbecile! It leads me back From this accursed night without a morn, And through the deserts which have else no track, And through vast wastes of horror-haunted time, To Eden innocence in Eden's clime: And I become a nursling soft and pure, An infant cradled on its mother's knee, Without a past, love-cherished and secure; Which if it saw this loathsome present Me, Would plunge its face into the pillowing breast, And scream abhorrence hard to lull to rest. He turned to grope; and I retiring brushed Thin shreds of gossamer from off my face, And mused, His life would grow, the germ uncrushed; He should to antenatal night retrace, And hide his elements in that large womb Beyond the reach of man-evolving Doom. And even thus, what weary way were planned, To seek oblivion through the far-off gate Of birth, when that of death is close at hand! For this is law, if law there be in Fate: What never has been, yet may have its when; The thing which has been, never is again. XIX. The mighty river flowing dark and deep, With ebb and flood from the remote sea-tides Vague-sounding through the City's sleepless sleep, Is named the River of the Suicides; For night by night some lorn wretch overweary, And shuddering from the future yet more dreary, Within its cold secure oblivion hides. One plunges from a bridge's parapet, As by some blind and sudden frenzy hurled; Another wades in slow with purpose set Until the waters are above him furled; Another in a boat with dreamlike motion Glides drifting down into the desert ocean, To starve or sink from out the desert world. They perish from their suffering surely thus, For none beholding them attempts to save, The while each thinks how soon, solicitous, He may seek refuge in the self-same wave; Some hour when tired of ever-vain endurance Impatience will forerun the sweet assurance Of perfect peace eventual in the grave. When this poor tragic-farce has palled us long, Why actors and spectators do we stay?— To fill our so-short rôles out right or wrong; To see what shifts are yet in the dull play For our illusion; to refrain from grieving Dear foolish friends by our untimely leaving: But those asleep at home, how blest are they! Yet it is but for one night after all: What matters one brief night of dreary pain? When after it the weary eyelids fall Upon the weary eyes and wasted brain; And all sad scenes and thoughts and feelings vanish In that sweet sleep no power can ever banish, That one best sleep which never wakes again. XX. I sat me weary on a pillar's base, And leaned against the shaft; for broad moonlight O'erflowed the peacefulness of cloistered space, A shore of shadow slanting from the right: The great cathedral's western front stood there, A wave-worn rock in that calm sea of air. Before it, opposite my place of rest, Two figures faced each other, large, austere; A couchant sphinx in shadow to the breast, An angel standing in the moonlight clear; So mighty by magnificence of form, They were not dwarfed beneath that mass enorm. Upon the cross-hilt of a naked sword The angel's hands, as prompt to smite, were held; His vigilant intense regard was poured Upon the creature placidly unquelled, Whose front was set at level gaze which took No heed of aught, a solemn trance-like look. And as I pondered these opposèd shapes My eyelids sank in stupor, that dull swoon Which drugs and with a leaden mantle drapes The outworn to worse weariness. But soon A sharp and clashing noise the stillness broke, And from the evil lethargy I woke. The angel's wings had fallen, stone on stone, And lay there shattered; hence the sudden sound: A warrior leaning on his sword alone Now watched the sphinx with that regard profound; The sphinx unchanged looked forthright, as aware Of nothing in the vast abyss of air. Again I sank in that repose unsweet, Again a clashing noise my slumber rent; The warrior's sword lay broken at his feet: An unarmed man with raised hands impotent Now stood before the sphinx, which ever kept Such mien as if with open eyes it slept. My eyelids sank in spite of wonder grown; A louder crash upstartled me in dread: The man had fallen forward, stone on stone, And lay there shattered, with his trunkless head Between the monster's large quiescent paws, Beneath its grand front changeless as life's laws. The moon had circled westward full and bright, And made the temple-front a mystic dream, And bathed the whole enclosure with its light, The sworded angel's wrecks, the sphinx supreme: I pondered long that cold majestic face Whose vision seemed of infinite void space. XXI. Anear the centre of that northern crest Stands out a level upland bleak and bare, From which the city east and south and west Sinks gently in long waves; and thronèd there An Image sits, stupendous, superhuman, The bronze colossus of a wingèd Woman, Upon a graded granite base foursquare. Low-seated she leans forward massively, With cheek on clenched left hand, the forearm's might Erect, its elbow on her rounded knee; Across a clasped book in her lap the right Upholds a pair of compasses; she gazes With full set eyes, but wandering in thick mazes Of sombre thought beholds no outward sight. Words cannot picture her; but all men know That solemn sketch the pure sad artist wrought Three centuries and threescore years ago, With phantasies of his peculiar thought: The instruments of carpentry and science Scattered about her feet, in strange alliance With the keen wolf-hound sleeping undistraught; Scales, hour-glass, bell, and magic-square above; The grave and solid infant perched beside, With open winglets that might bear a dove, Intent upon its tablets, heavy-eyed; Her folded wings as of a mighty eagle, But all too impotent to lift the regal Robustness of her earth-born strength and pride; And with those wings, and that light wreath which seems To mock her grand head and the knotted frown Of forehead charged with baleful thoughts and dreams, The household bunch of keys, the housewife's gown Voluminous, indented, and yet rigid As if a shell of burnished metal frigid, The feet thick shod to tread all weakness down; The comet hanging o'er the waste dark seas, The massy rainbow curved in front of it, Beyond the village with the masts and trees; The snaky imp, dog-headed, from the Pit, Bearing upon its batlike leathern pinions Her name unfolded in the sun's dominions, The “Melencolia” that transcends all wit. Thus has the artist copied her, and thus Surrounded to expound her form sublime, Her fate heroic and calamitous; Fronting the dreadful mysteries of Time, Unvanquished in defeat and desolation, Undaunted in the hopeless conflagration Of the day setting on her baffled prime. Baffled and beaten back she works on still, Weary and sick of soul she works the more, Sustained by her indomitable will: The hands shall fashion and the brain shall pore And all her sorrow shall be turned to labour, Till death the friend-foe piercing with his sabre That mighty heart of hearts ends bitter war. But as if blacker night could dawn on night, With tenfold gloom on moonless night unstarred, A sense more tragic than defeat and blight, More desperate than strife with hope debarred, More fatal than the adamantine Never Encompassing her passionate endeavour, Dawns glooming in her tenebrous regard: The sense that every struggle brings defeat Because Fate holds no prize to crown success; That all the oracles are dumb or cheat Because they have no secret to express; That none can pierce the vast black veil uncertain Because there is no light beyond the curtain; That all is vanity and nothingness. Titanic from her high throne in the north, That City's sombre Patroness and Queen, In bronze sublimity she gazes forth Over her Capital of teen and threne, Over the river with its isles and bridges, The marsh and moorland, to the stern rock-ridges, Confronting them with a coëval mien. The moving moon and stars from east to west Circle before her in the sea of air; Shadows and gleams glide round her solemn rest. Her subjects often gaze up to her there: The strong to drink new strength of iron endurance, The weak new terrors; all, renewed assurance And confirmation of the old despair. 1870–1874. IN THE ROOM “Ceste insigne fable et tragicque comedie.” —Rabelais. I The sun was down, and twilight grey Filled half the air; but in the room, Whose curtain had been drawn all day, The twilight was a dusky gloom: Which seemed at first as still as death, And void; but was indeed all rife With subtle thrills, the pulse and breath Of multitudinous lower life. II In their abrupt and headlong way Bewildered flies for light had dashed Against the curtain all the day, And now slept wintrily abashed; And nimble mice slept, wearied out With such a double night's uproar; But solid beetles crawled about The chilly hearth and naked floor. III And so throughout the twilight hour That vaguely murmurous hush and rest There brooded; and beneath its power Life throbbing held its throbs supprest: Until the thin-voiced mirror sighed, I am all blurred with dust and damp, So long ago the clear day died, So long has gleamed nor fire nor lamp. IV Whereon the curtain murmured back, Some change is on us, good or ill; Behind me and before is black As when those human things lie still: But I have seen the darkness grow As grows the daylight every morn; Have felt out there long shine and glow, In here long chilly dusk forlorn. V The cupboard grumbled with a groan, Each new day worse starvation brings: Since he came here I have not known Or sweets or cates or wholesome things: But now! a pinch of meal, a crust, Throughout the week is all I get. I am so empty; it is just As when they said we were to let. VI What is become, then, of our Man? The petulant old glass exclaimed; If all this time he slumber can, He really ought to be ashamed. I wish we had our Girl again, So gay and busy, bright and fair: The girls are better than these men, Who only for their dull selves care. VII It is so many hours ago— The lamp and fire were both alight— I saw him pacing to and fro, Perturbing restlessly the night. His face was pale to give one fear, His eyes when lifted looked too bright; He muttered; what, I could not hear: Bad words though; something was not right. VIII The table said, He wrote so long That I grew weary of his weight; The pen kept up a cricket song, It ran and ran at such a rate: And in the longer pauses he With both his folded arms downpressed And stared as one who does not see, Or sank his head upon his breast. IX The fire-grate said, I am as cold As if I never had a blaze; The few dead cinders here I hold, I held unburned for days and days. Last night he made them flare; but still What good did all his writing do? Among my ashes curl and thrill Thin ghosts of all those papers too. X The table answered, Not quite all; He saved and folded up one sheet, And sealed it fast, and let it fall; And here it lies now white and neat. Whereon the letter's whisper came, My writing is closed up too well; Outside there's not a single name, And who should read me I can't tell. XI The mirror sneered with scornful spite, (That ancient crack which spoiled her looks Had marred her temper), Write and write! And read those stupid, worn-out books! That's all he does, read, write, and read, And smoke that nasty pipe which stinks: He never takes the slightest heed How any of us feels or thinks. XII But Lucy fifty times a day Would come and smile here in my face, Adjust a tress that curled astray, Or tie a ribbon with more grace: She looked so young and fresh and fair, She blushed with such a charming bloom, It did one good to see her there, And brightened all things in the room. XIII She did not sit hours stark and dumb As pale as moonshine by the lamp; To lie in bed when day was come, And leave us curtained chill and damp. She slept away the dreary dark, And rose to greet the pleasant morn; And sang as gaily as a lark While busy as the flies sun-born. XIV And how she loved us every one; And dusted this and mended that, With trills and laughs and freaks of fun, And tender scoldings in her chat! And then her bird, that sang as shrill As she sang sweet; her darling flowers That grew there in the window-sill, Where she would sit at work for hours. XV It was not much she ever wrote; Her fingers had good work to do; Say, once a week a pretty note; And very long it took her too. And little more she read, I wis; Just now and then a pictured sheet, Besides those letters she would kiss And croon for hours, they were so sweet. XVI She had her friends too, blithe young girls, Who whispered, babbled, laughed, caressed, And romped and danced with dancing curls, And gave our life a joyous zest. But with this dullard, glum and sour, Not one of all his fellow-men Has ever passed a social hour; We might be in some wild beast's den. XVII This long tirade aroused the bed, Who spoke in deep and ponderous bass, Befitting that calm life he led, As if firm-rooted in his place: In broad majestic bulk alone, As in thrice venerable age, He stood at once the royal throne, The monarch, the experienced sage: XVIII I know what is and what has been; Not anything to me comes strange, Who in so many years have seen And lived through every kind of change. I know when men are good or bad, When well or ill, he slowly said; When sad or glad, when sane or mad, And when they sleep alive or dead. XIX At this last word of solemn lore A tremor circled through the gloom, As if a crash upon the floor Had jarred and shaken all the room: For nearly all the listening things Were old and worn, and knew what curse Of violent change death often brings, From good to bad, from bad to worse; XX They get to know each other well, To feel at home and settled down; Death bursts among them like a shell, And strews them over all the town. The bed went on, This man who lies Upon me now is stark and cold; He will not any more arise, And do the things he did of old. XXI But we shall have short peace or rest; For soon up here will come a rout, And nail him in a queer long chest, And carry him like luggage out. They will be muffled all in black, And whisper much, and sigh and weep: But he will never more come back, And some one else in me must sleep. XXII Thereon a little phial shrilled, Here empty on the chair I lie: I heard one say, as I was filled, With half of this a man would die. The man there drank me with slow breath, And murmured, Thus ends barren strife: O sweeter, thou cold wine of death, Than ever sweet warm wine of life. XXIII One of my cousins long ago, A little thing, the mirror said, Was carried to a couch to show, Whether a man was really dead. Two great improvements marked the case: He did not blur her with his breath, His many-wrinkled, twitching face Was smooth old ivory: verdict, Death.— XXIV It lay, the lowest thing there, lulled Sweet-sleep-like in corruption's truce; The form whose purpose was annulled, While all the other shapes meant use. It lay, the he become now it, Unconscious of the deep disgrace, Unanxious how its parts might flit Through what new forms in time and space. XXV It lay and preached, as dumb things do, More powerfully than tongues can prate; Though life be torture through and through, Man is but weak to plain of fate: The drear path crawls on drearier still To wounded feet and hopeless breast? Well, he can lie down when he will, And straight all ends in endless rest. XXVI And while the black night nothing saw, And till the cold morn came at last, That old bed held the room in awe With tales of its experience vast. It thrilled the gloom; it told such tales Of human sorrows and delights, Of fever moans and infant wails, Of births and deaths and bridal nights. 1867–8. SUNDAY UP THE RIVER Reprinted from Fraser's Magazine, October 1869, with the kind assent of Messrs. Longmans &amp; Co. AN IDYLL OF COCKAIGNE “En allant promener aux champs, J'y ai trouvé les blés si grands, Les aubépines florissant. En vérité, en vérité, C'est le mois, le joli mois, C'est le joli mois de mai. “Dieu veuill' garder les vins, les blés, Les jeunes filles à marier, Les jeun' garçons pour les aimer! En vérité, en vérité, C'est'le mois, le joli mois, C'est le joli mois de mai.” —Carol of Lorraine. From Victor Fournel's charming book, “Ce qu'on voit dans les rues de Paris.” I. I looked out into the morning, I looked out into the west: The soft blue eye of the quiet sky Still drooped in dreamy rest; The trees were still like clouds there, The clouds like mountains dim; The broad mist lay, a silver bay Whose tide was at the brim. I looked out into the morning, I looked out into the east: The flood of light upon the night Had silently increased; The sky was pale with fervour, The distant trees were grey, The hill-lines drawn like waves of dawn Dissolving in the day. I looked out into the morning; Looked east, looked west, with glee: O richest day of happy May, My love will spend with me! II. “Oh, what are you waiting for here, young man? What are you looking for over the bridge?” A little straw hat with the streaming blue ribbons Is soon to come dancing over the bridge. Her heart beats the measure that keeps her feet dancing, Dancing along like a wave o' the sea; Her heart pours the sunshine with which her eyes glancing Light up strange faces in looking for me. The strange faces brighten in meeting her glances; The strangers all bless her, pure, lovely, and free: She fancies she walks, but her walk skips and dances, Her heart makes such music in coming to me. Oh, thousands and thousands of happy young maidens Are tripping this morning their sweethearts to see; But none whose heart beats to a sweeter love-cadence Than hers who will brighten the sunshine for me. “Oh, what are you waiting for here, young man? What are you looking for over the bridge?” A little straw hat with the streaming blue ribbons; —And here it comes dancing over the bridge! III. In the vast vague grey, Mistily luminous, brightly dim, The trees to the south there, far away, Float as beautiful, strange and grand As pencilled palm-trees, every line Mystic with a grace divine, In our dreams of the holy Eastern Land. There is not a cloud in the sky; The vague vast grey Melts into azure dim on high. Warmth, and languor, and infinite peace! Surely the young Day Hath fallen into a vision and a trance, And his burning flight doth cease. Yet look how here and there Soft curves, fine contours, seem to swim, Half emerging, wan and dim, Into the quiet air: Like statues growing slowly, slowly out From the great vault of marble; here a limb, And there a feature, but the rest all doubt. Then the sculpturing sunbeams smite, And the forms start forth to the day; And the breath of the morning sweepeth light The luminous dust away: And soon, soon, soon, Crowning the floor of the land and the sea, Shall be wrought the dome of Noon. The burning sapphire dome, With solemn imagery; vast shapes that stand Each like an island ringed with flashing foam, Black-purple mountains, creeks and rivers of light, Crags of cleft crystal blazing to the crest: Vast isles that move, that roam A tideless sea of infinite fathomless rest. Thus shall it be this noon: And thus, so slowly, slowly from its birth In the long night's dark swoon, Through the long morning's trance, sweet, vague, and dim, The Sun divine above Doth build up in us, Heaven completing Earth, Our solemn Noon of Love. IV. The church bells are ringing: How green the earth, how fresh and fair! The thrushes are singing: What rapture but to breathe this air! The church bells are ringing: Lo, how the river dreameth there! The thrushes are singing: Green flames wave lightly everywhere! The church bells are ringing: How all the world breathes praise and prayer! The thrushes are singing: What Sabbath peace doth trance the air! V. I love all hardy exercise That makes one strain and quiver; And best of all I love and prize This boating on our river. I to row and you to steer, Gay shall be Life's trip, my dear: You to steer and I to row, All is bright where'er we go. We push off from the bank; again We're free upon the waters; The happiest of the sons of men, The fairest of earth's daughters. And I row, and I row; The blue floats above us as we go: And you steer, and you steer, Framed in gliding wood and water, O my dear I pull a long calm mile or two, Pull slowly, deftly feather: How sinful any work to do In this Italian weather! Yet I row, yet I row; The blue floats above us as we go: While you steer, while you steer, Framed in gliding wood and water, O my dear. Those lovely breadths of lawn that sweep Adown in still green billows! And o'er the brim in fountains leap; Green fountains, weeping willows! And I row, and I row; The blue floats above us as we go: And you steer, and you steer, Framed in gliding wood and water, O my dear. We push among the flags in flower, Beneath the branches tender, And we are in a faerie bower Of green and golden splendour. I to row and you to steer, Gay must be Life's trip, my dear; You to steer and I to row, All is bright where'er we go. A secret bower where we can hide In lustrous shadow lonely; The crystal floor may lap and glide To rock our dreaming only. I to row and you to steer, Gay must be Life's trip, my dear; You to steer and I to row, All is bright where'er we go. VI. I love this hardy exercise, This strenuous toil of boating: Our skiff beneath the willow lies Half stranded and half floating. As I lie, as I lie, Glimpses dazzle of the blue and burning sky; As you lean, as you lean, Faerie Princess of the secret faerie scene. My shirt is of the soft red wool, My cap is azure braided By two white hands so beautiful, My tie mauve purple-shaded. As I lie, as I lie, Glimpses dazzle of white clouds and sapphire sky; As you lean, as you lean, Faerie Princess of the secret faerie scene. Your hat with long blue streamers decked, Your pure throat crimson-banded; White-robed, my own white dove unflecked, Dove-footed, lilac-handed. As I lie, as I lie, Glimpses dazzle of white clouds and sapphire sky; As you lean, as you lean, Faerie Princess of the secret faerie scene. If any boaters boating past Should look where we're reclining, They'll say, To-day green willows glassed Rubies and sapphires shining! As I lie, as I lie, Glimpses dazzle of the blue and burning sky; As you lean, as you lean, Faerie Princess of the secret faerie scene. VII. Grey clouds come puffing from my lips And hang there softly curling, While from the bowl now leaps, now slips, A steel-blue thread high twirling. As I lie, as I lie, The hours fold their wings beneath the sky; As you lean, as you lean, In that trance of perfect love and bliss serene. I gaze on you and I am crowned, A Monarch great and glorious, A Hero in all realms renowned, A Faerie Prince victorious. As I lie, as I lie, The hours fold their wings beneath the sky; As you lean, as you lean, In that trance of perfect love and bliss serene. Your violet eyes pour out their whole Pure light in earnest rapture; Your thoughts come dreaming through my soul, And nestle past recapture. As I lie, as I lie, The hours fold their wings beneath the sky; As you lean, as you lean, In that trance of perfect love and bliss serene. O friends, your best years to the oar Like galley-slaves devoting, This is and shall be evermore The true sublime of boating! As I lie, as I lie, The hours fold their wings beneath the sky; As you lean, as you lean, In that trance of perfect love and bliss serene. VIII. The water is cool and sweet and pure, The water is clear as crystal; And water's a noble liquid, sure;— But look at my pocket-pistol! Tim Boyland gave it me, one of two The rogue brought back from Dublin; With a jar of the genuine stuff: hurroo! How deliciously it comes bubblin'! It is not brandy, it is not wine, It is Jameson's Irish Whisky: It fills the heart with joy divine, And it makes the fancy frisky. All other spirits are vile resorts, Except its own Scotch first cousin; And as for your Clarets and Sherries and Ports, A naggin is worth a dozen. I have watered this, though a toothful neat Just melts like cream down the throttle: But it's grand in the punch, hot, strong, and sweet: Not a headache in a bottle. It is amber as the western skies When the sunset glows serenest; It is mellow as the mild moonrise When the shamrock leaves fold greenest. Just a little, wee, wee, tiny sip! Just the wet of the bill of a starling! A drop of dew for the rosy lip, And two stars in the eyes of my darling! 'Faith your kiss has made it so sweet at the brim I could go on supping for ever! We'll pocket the pistol: And Tim, you limb, May this craturr abandon you never! IX. Like violets pale i' the Spring o' the year Came my Love's sad eyes to my youth; Wan and dim with many a tear, But the sweeter for that in sooth: Wet and dim, Tender and true, Violet eyes Of the sweetest blue. Like pansies dark i' the June o' the year Grow my Love's glad eyes to my prime; Rich with the purple splendour clear Of their thoughtful bliss sublime: Deep and dark, Solemn and true, Pansy eyes Of the noblest blue. X. Were I a real Poet, I would sing Such joyous songs of you, and all mere truth; As true as buds and tender leaves in Spring, As true as lofty dreams in dreamful youth; That men should cry: How foolish every one Who thinks the world is getting out of tune! Where is the tarnish in our golden sun? Where is the clouding in our crystal moon? The lark sings now the eversame new song With which it soared through Eden's purest skies; This poet's music doth for us prolong The very speech Love learnt in Paradise; This maiden is as young and pure and fair As Eve agaze on Adam sleeping there. XI. When will you have not a sole kiss left, And my prodigal mouth be all bereft? When your lips have ravished the last sweet flush Of the red with which the roses blush: Now I kiss them and kiss them till they hush. When will you have not a glance to give Of the love in whose lustre my glances live? When, O my darling, your fathomless eyes Have drawn all the azure out of the skies: Now I gaze and I gaze till they dare not rise. When will you find not a single vow Of the myriads and myriads you lavish now? When your voice has gurgled the last sweet note That was meant from the nightingales to float: Now I whisper it, whisper it dumb in your throat. When will you love me no more, no more, And my happy, happy dream be o'er? When no rose is red, and no skies are blue, And no nightingale sings the whole year through, Then my heart may have no love for you. XII. My Love o'er the water bends dreaming; It glideth and glideth away: She sees there her own beauty, gleaming Through shadow and ripple and spray. Oh, tell her, thou murmuring river, As past her your light wavelets roll, How steadfast that image for ever Shines pure in pure depths of my soul. XIII. The wandering airs float over the lawn, And linger and whisper in at our bower; (They babble, babble all they know:) The delicate secrets they have drawn From bird and meadow and tree and flower; (Gossiping softly, whispering low.) Some linden stretches itself to the height, Then rustles back to its dream of the day; (They babble, babble all they know:) Some bird would trill out its love-delight, But the honey melts in its throat away; (Gossiping softly, whispering low.) Some flower seduced by the treacherous calm Breathes all its soul in a fragrant sigh; (They babble, babble all they know:) Some blossom weeps a tear of balm For the lost caress of a butterfly; (Gossiping softly, whispering low.) Our Mother lies in siesta now, And we listen to her breathings here; (They babble, babble all they know:) And we learn all the thoughts hid under her brow, All her heart's deep dreams of the happy year: (Gossiping softly, whispering low.) XIV. Those azure, azure eyes Gaze on me with their love; And I am lost in dream, And cannot speak or move. Those azure, azure eyes Stay with me when we part; A sea of azure thoughts Overfloods my heart. “Mit deinen blauen Augen Siehst du mich lieblich an; Da ward mir so träumend zu Sinne Dass ich nicht sprechen kann. “An deine blauen Augen Gedenk' ich allerwärts;— Ein Meer von blauen Gedanken Ergiesst sich über mein Herz.” —Heine. XV. Give a man a horse he can ride, Give a man a boat he can sail; And his rank and wealth, his strength and health, On sea nor shore shall fail. Give a man a pipe he can smoke, Give a man a book he can read; And his home is bright with a calm delight, Though the room be poor indeed. Give a man a girl he can love, As I, O my Love, love thee; And his heart is great with the pulse of Fate, At home, on land, on sea. XVI. My love is the flaming Sword To fight through the world; Thy love is the Shield to ward, And the Armour of the Lord And the Banner of Heaven unfurled. XVII. Let my voice ring out and over the earth, Through all the grief and strife, With a golden joy in a silver mirth: Thank God for Life! Let my voice swell out through the great abyss To the azure dome above, With a chord of faith in the harp of bliss: Thank God for Love! Let my voice thrill out beneath and above, The whole world through: O my Love and Life, O my Life and Love, Thank God for you! XVIII. The wine of Love is music, And the feast of Love is song: And when Love sits down to the banquet, Love sits long: Sits long and ariseth drunken, But not with the feast and the wine; He reeleth with his own heart, That great rich Vine. XIX. Drink! drink! open your mouth! This air is as rich as wine; Flowing with balm from the sunny south, And health from the western brine. Drink! drink! open your mouth! This air is as strong as wine: My brain is drugged with the balm o' the south, And rolls with the western brine. Drink! drink! open your mouth! This air is the choicest wine; From that golden grape the Sun, i' the south Of Heaven's broad vine. XX. Could we float thus ever, Floating down a river, Down a tranquil river, and you alone with me: Past broad shining meadows, Past the great wood-shadows, Past fair farms and hamlets, for ever to the sea. Through the golden noonlight, Through the silver moonlight, Through the tender gloaming, gliding calm and free; From the sunset gliding, Into morning sliding, With the tranquil river for ever to the sea. Past the masses hoary Of cities great in story, Past their towers and temples drifting lone and free: Gliding, never hasting, Gliding, never resting, Ever with the river that glideth to the sea. With a swifter motion Out upon the Ocean, Heaven above and round us, and you alone with me; Heaven around and o'er us, The Infinite before us, Floating on for ever upon the flowing sea. What time is it, dear, now? We are in the year now Of the New Creation one million two or three. But where are we now, Love? We are as I trow, Love, In the Heaven of Heavens upon the Crystal Sea. And may mortal sinners Care for carnal dinners In your Heaven of Heavens, New Era millions three? Oh, if their boat gets stranding Upon some Richmond landing, They're thirsty as the desert and hungry as the sea! 1865. SUNDAY AT HAMPSTEAD (AN IDLE IDYLL BY A VERY HUMBLE MEMBER OF THE GREAT AND NOBLE LONDON MOB.) I. This is the Heath of Hampstead, There is the dome of Saint Paul's; Beneath, on the serried house-tops, A chequered lustre falls: And the mighty city of London, Under the clouds and the light, Seems a low wet beach, half shingle, With a few sharp rocks upright. Here will we sit, my darling, And dream an hour away: The donkeys are hurried and worried, But we are not donkeys to-day: Through all the weary week, dear, We toil in the murk down there, Tied to a desk and a counter, A patient stupid pair! But on Sunday we slip our tether, And away from the smoke and the smirch; Too grateful to God for His Sabbath To shut its hours in a church. Away to the green, green country, Under the open sky; Where the earth's sweet breath is incense And the lark sings psalms on high. On Sunday we're Lord and Lady, With ten times the love and glee Of those pale and languid rich ones Who are always and never free. They drawl and stare and simper, So fine and cold and staid, Like exquisite waxwork figures That must be kept in the shade: We can laugh out loud when merry, We can romp at kiss-in-the-ring, We can take our beer at a public, We can loll on the grass and sing. . . . Would you grieve very much, my darling, If all yon low wet shore Were drowned by a mighty flood-tide, And we never toiled there more? Wicked?—there is no sin, dear, In an idle dreamer's head; He turns the world topsy-turvy To prove that his soul's not dead. I am sinking, sinking, sinking; It is hard to sit upright! Your lap is the softest pillow! Good night, my Love, good night! II. How your eyes dazzle down into my soul! I drink and drink of their deep violet wine, And ever thirst the more, although my whole Dazed being whirls in drunkenness divine. Pout down your lips from that bewildering smile And kiss me for the interruption, Sweet! I had escaped you: floating for awhile In that far cloud ablaze with living heat: I floated with it through the solemn skies, I melted with it up the Crystal Sea Into the Heaven of Heavens; and shut my eyes To feel eternal rest enfolding me. . . . Well, I prefer one tyrannous girl down here, You jealous violet-eyed Bewitcher, you! To being lord in Mohammed's seventh sphere Of meekest houris threescore ten and two! III. Was it hundreds of years ago, my Love, Was it thousands of miles away, That two poor creatures we know, my Love, Were toiling day by day; Were toiling weary, weary, With many myriads more, In a City dark and dreary On a sullen river's shore? Was it truly a fact or a dream, my Love? I think my brain still reels, And my ears still throbbing seem, my Love, With the rush and the clang of wheels; Of a vast machinery roaring For ever in skyless gloom; Where the poor slaves peace imploring, Found peace alone in the tomb. Was it hundreds of years ago, my Love, Was it thousands of miles away? Or was it a dream to show, my Love, The rapture of to-day? This day of holy splendour, This Sabbath of rich rest, Wherein to God we render All praise by being blest. IV. Eight of us promised to meet here And tea together at five: And—who would ever believe it?— We are the first to arrive! Oh, shame on us, my darling; It is a monstrous crime To make a tryst with others And be before our time! Lizzie is off with William, Quite happy for her part; Our sugar in her pocket, And the sweet love in her heart. Mary and Dick so grandly Parade suburban streets; His waistcoat and her bonnet Proving the best of treats. And Fanny plagues big Robert With tricks of the wildest glee: O Fanny, you'll get in hot water If you do not bring us our tea! Why, bless me, look at that table, Every one of them there!— “Ha, here at last we have them, The always behindhand pair! “When the last trumpet-solo Strikes up instead of the lark, They'll turn in their sleep just grunting Who's up so soon in the dark?” Babble and gabble, you rabble, A thousand in full yell! And this is your Tower of Babel, This not-to-be-finished Hotel. (Since finished, in a fashion. The verses were written in 1863.) “You should see it in the drawing, You'd think a Palace they make, Like the one in the Lady of Lyons, With this pond for the lovely lake!” “I wish it wasn't Sunday, There's no amusement at all: Who was here Hot-cross-bun-day? We had such an open-air ball! The bands played polkas, waltzes, Quadrilles; it was glorious fun! And each gentleman gave them a penny After each dance was done.” “Mary is going to chapel, And what takes her there, do you guess? Her sweet little duck of a bonnet, And her new second-hand silk dress.” “We went to Church one Sunday, But felt we had no right there; For it's only a place for the grand folk Who come in a carriage and pair. “And I laughed out loud,—it was shameful! But Fanny said, Oh, what lives! He must have been clever, the rascal, To manage seven hundred wives!” “Suppose we play Hunt-the-Slipper?” “We can't, there's the crinoline!”—“Phew! Bother it, always a nuisance!” “Hoop-de-dooden-do!” “I think I've seen all the girls here, About a thousand, or more; But none of them half so pretty As our own loving four.” “Thank you! and I've been listening To lots of the men, the knaves; But none of them half such humbugs As our devoted slaves.” “Do you see those purple flushes? The sun will set in state: Up all! we must cross to the heath, friends, Before it gets too late. “We will couch in the fern together, And watch for the moon and the stars; And the slim tree-tops will be lighted, So the boys may light their cigars. “And while the sunset glory Burns down in crimson and gold, Lazy shall tell us a story Of his wonderful times of old.” V. Ten thousand years ago, (“No more than that?”) Ten thousand years, (“The age of Robert's hat!”— “Silence, you gods!”—“Pinch Fanny!”—“Now we're good.”) This place where we are sitting was a wood, Savage and desert save for one rude home Of wattles plastered with stiff clay and loam; And here, in front, upon the grassy mire Four naked squaws were squatted round a fire: Then four tall naked wild men crushing through The tangled underwood came into view; Two of them bent beneath a mighty boar, The third was gashed and bleeding, number four Strutted full-drest in war-paint, (“That was Dick!”) Blue of a devilish pattern laid on thick. The squaws jumped up to roast the carcass whole; The braves sank silent, stark 'gainst root and bole. The meat half-done, they tore it and devoured, Sullenly ravenous; the women cowered Until their lords had finished, then partook. Mist rose; all crept into their cabin-nook, And staked the mouth; the floor was one broad bed Of rushes dried with fox and bearskins spread. Wolves howled and wild cats wailed; they snored; and so The long night passed, shedding a storm of snow; This very night ten thousand years ago. VI. Ten thousand years before, (“Come, draw it mild! Don't waste Conk-ology like that, my child!”) From where we sit to the horizon's bound A level brilliant plain was spread all round, As level and as brilliant as a sea Under the burning sun; high as your knee Aflame with flowers, yellow and blue and red: Long lines of palm-trees marked out there the bed Of a great river, and among them gleamed A few grey tents. Then four swift horsemen streamed Out of the West, magnificent in ire, Churning the meadow into flakes of fire, Brandishing monstrous spears as if in fight, They wheeled, ducked, charged, and shouted fierce delight: So till they reach the camp: the women there Awaiting them the evening meal prepare; Milk from the goats and camels, dates plucked fresh, Cool curds and cheese, millet, sweet broiled kid's flesh. The spear struck deep hath picketed each barb; A grave proud turbaned man in flowing garb Sups with a grave meek woman, humbly proud, Whose eyes flash empire. Then the solemn crowd Of stars above, the silent plain below, Until the East resumes its furnace-glow; This same night twenty thousand years ago. VII. Ten thousand years before, (“But if you take Such mouthfuls, you will soon eat up Time's cake!”) Where we are sitting rose in splendid light A broad cool marble palace; from the height Broad terrace-gardens stairlike sank away Down to the floor of a deep sapphire bay. Where the last slope slid greenly to the wave, And dark rich glossy foliage shadow gave, Four women—or four goddesses—leaned calm, Of mighty stature, graceful as the palm: One stroked with careless hand a lion's mane, One fed an eagle; while a measured strain Was poured forth by the others, harp and voice, Music to make the universe rejoice. An isle was in the offing seen afar, Deep-purple based, its peak a glittering star; Whence rowed a galley (drooped the silken sails), A dragon-barque with golden burning scales. Then four bronzed giants leapt to land, embraced The glorious women, chanting: “Did we haste? The Cavern-Voice hath silenced all your fears; Peace on our earth another thousand years!” On fruits and noble wine, with song's rich flow, They feasted in the sunset's golden glow; This same night thirty thousand years ago. VIII. Ten thousand years before, (“Another ten! Good Lord, how greedy are these little men!”) This place where we are sitting (“Half asleep.”) Was in the sea a hundred fathoms deep: A floor of silver sand so fine and soft, A coral forest branching far aloft; Above, the great dusk emerald golden-green; Silence profound and solitude serene. Four mermaids sit beneath the coral rocks, Combing with golden combs their long green locks, And wreathing them with little pearly shells; Four mermen come from out the deep-sea dells, And whisper to them, and they all turn pale: Then through the hyaline a voice of wail, With passionate gestures, “Ever alas for woe! A rumour cometh down the Ocean-flow, A word calamitous! that we shall be All disinherited from the great sea: Our tail with which like fishes we can swim Shall split into an awkward double-limb, And we must waddle on the arid soil, And build dirt-huts, and get our food with toil, And lose our happy, happy lives!” And so These gentle creatures wept “Alas for woe!” This same night forty thousand years ago. IX. “Are you not going back a little more? What was the case ten thousand years before?” Ten thousand years before 'twas Sunday night; Four lovely girls were listening with delight, Three noble youths admired another youth Discoursing History crammed full of truth: They all were sitting upon Hampstead Heath, And monstrous grimy London lay beneath. “The stupidest story Lazy ever told; I've no more faith in his fine times of old.” “How do you like our prospects now, my dears? We'll all be mermaids in ten thousand years.” “Mermaids are beautiful enough, but law! Think of becoming a poor naked squaw!” “But in these changes, sex will change no doubt; We'll all be men and women turn about.” “Then these four chaps will be the squaws?—that's just; With lots of picaninnies, I do trust!” “If changes go by fifty thousand, yes; But if by ten, they last were squaws, I guess!” “Come on; we'll go and do the very beers We did this night was fifty thousand years.” Thou prophet, thou deep sage! we'll go, we'll go: The ring is round, Life naught, the World an O; This night is fifty thousand years ago! X. As we rush, as we rush in the Train, The trees and the houses go wheeling back, But the starry heavens above the plain Come flying on our track. All the beautiful stars of the sky, The silver doves of the forest of Night, Over the dull earth swarm and fly, Companions of our flight. We will rush ever on without fear; Let the goal be far, the flight be fleet! For we carry the Heavens with us, Dear, While the Earth slips from our feet! XI. Day after day of this azure May The blood of the Spring has swelled in my veins; Night after night of broad moonlight A mystical dream has dazzled my brains. A seething might, a fierce delight, The blood of the Spring is the wine of the world; My veins run fire and thrill desire, Every leaf of my heart's red rose uncurled. A sad sweet calm, a tearful balm, The light of the Moon is the trance of the world; My brain is fraught with yearning thought, And the rose is pale and its leaves are furled. O speed the day, thou dear, dear May, And hasten the night I charge thee, O June, When the trance divine shall burn with the wine And the red rose unfurl all its fire to the Moon! XII. O mellow moonlight warm, Weave round my Love a charm; O countless starry eyes, Watch from the holy skies; O ever-solemn Night, Shield her within thy might: Watch her, my little one! Shield her, my darling! How my heart shrinks with fear, Nightly to leave thee, dear; Lonely and pure within Vast glooms of woe and sin: Our wealth of love and bliss Too heavenly-perfect is: Good night, my little one! God keep thee, darling! 1863; 1865. THE NAKED GODDESS ?“Arcane danze D'immortal piede i ruinosi gioghi Scossero e l'ardue selve (oggi romito Nido de' venti).” —Leopardi. Through the country to the town Ran a rumour and renown, That a woman grand and tall, Swift of foot, and therewithal Naked as a lily gleaming, Had been seen by eyes not dreaming, Darting down far forest glades, Flashing sunshine through the shades. With this rumour's swelling word All the city buzzed and stirred; Solemn senators conferred; Priest, astrologer, and mage, Subtle sophist, bard, and sage, Brought their wisdom, lore, and wit, To expound or riddle it: Last a porter ventured—“We Might go out ourselves to see.” Thus, upon a summer morn Lo the city all forlorn; Every house and street and square In the sunshine still and bare, Every galley left to sway Silent in the glittering bay; All the people swarming out, Young and old a joyous rout, Rich and poor, far-streaming through Fields and meadows dark with dew, Crowd on crowd, and throng on throng; Chatter, laughter, jest, and song Deafened all the singing birds, Wildered sober grazing herds. Up the hillside 'gainst the sun, Where the forest outskirts run; On along the level high, Where the azure of the sky, And the ruddy morning sheen, Drop in fragments through the treen Where the sward surrounds the brake With a lucid, glassy lake, Where the ample glades extend Until clouds and foliage blend; Where whoever turneth may See the city and the bay, And, beyond, the broad sea bright, League on league of slanting light; Where the moist blue shadows sleep In the sacred forest deep. Suddenly the foremost pause, Ere the rear discern a cause; Loiterers press up row on row, All the mass heaves to and fro; All seem murmuring in one strain, All seem hearkening fixed and fain: Silence, and the lifted light Of countless faces gazing white. Four broad beech-trees, great of bole, Crowned the green, smooth-swelling knoll; There She leant, the glorious form Dazzling with its beauty warm, Naked as the sun of noon, Naked as the midnight moon: And around her, tame and mild, All the forest creatures wild— Lion, panther, kid, and fawn, Eagle, hawk, and dove, all drawn By the magic of her splendour, By her great voice, rich and tender, Whereof every beast and bird Understood each tone and word, While she fondled and carest, Playing freaks of joyous zest. Suddenly the lion stood, Turned and saw the multitude, Swelled his mighty front in ire, Roared the roar of raging fire: Then She turned, the living light, Sprang erect, grew up in height, Smote them with the flash and blaze Of her terrible, swift gaze; A divine, flushed, throbbing form, Dreadfuller than blackest storm. All the forest creatures cowered, Trembling, moaning, overpowered; All the simple folk who saw Sank upon their knees in awe Of this Goddess, fierce and splendid, Whom they witless had offended; And they murmured out faint prayers, Inarticulate despairs, Till her hot and angry mien Grew more gentle and serene. Stood the high priest forth, and went Halfway up the green ascent; There began a preachment long Of the great and grievous wrong She unto her own soul wrought In thus living without thought Of the gods who sain and save, Of the life beyond the grave: Living with the beasts that perish, Far from all the rites that cherish Hope and faith and holy love, And appease the thrones above: Full of unction pled the preacher; Let her come and they would teach her Spirit strangled in the mesh Of the vile and sinful flesh, How to gain the heavenly prize, How grow meet for Paradise; Penance, prayer, self sacrifice, Fasting, cloistered solitude, Mind uplifted, heart subdued; Thus a Virgin, clean and chaste, In the Bridegroom's arms embraced. Vestal sister's hooded gown, Straight and strait, of dismal brown, Here he proffered, and laid down On the green grass like a frown. Then stood forth the old arch-sage, Wrinkled more with thought than age: What could worse afflict, deject Any well-trained intellect Than in savage forest seeing Such a full-grown human being With the beasts and birds at play, Ignorant and wild as they? Sciences and arts, by which Man makes Nature's poor life rich, Dominates the world around, Proves himself its King self-crowned, She knew nothing of them, she Knew not even what they be! Body naked to the air, And the reason just as bare! Yet (since circumstance, that can Hinder the full growth of man, Cannot kill the seeds of worth Innate in the Lord of Earth), Yet she might be taught and brought To full sovranty of thought, Crowned with reason's glorious crown. So he tendered and laid down, Sober grey beside the brown, Amplest philosophic gown. Calm and proud she stood the while With a certain wondering smile; When the luminous sage was done She began to speak as one Using language not her own, Simplest words in sweetest tone: “Poor old greybeards, worn and bent! I do know not what they meant; Only here and there a word Reached my mind of all I heard; Let some child come here, I may Understand what it can say.” So two little children went, Lingering up the green ascent, Hand in hand, but grew the while Bolder in her gentle smile; When she kissed them they were free, Joyous as at mother's knee. “Tell me, darlings, now,” said she, “What they want to say to me.” Boy and girl then, nothing loth, Sometimes one and sometimes both, Prattled to her sitting there Fondling with their soft young hair: “Dear kind lady, do you stay Here with always holiday? Do you sleep among the trees? People want you, if you please, To put on your dress and come With us to the City home; Live with us and be our friend: Oh, such pleasant times we'll spend! . . . But if you can't come away, Will you let us stop and play With you and all these happy things With hair and horns and shining wings?” She arose and went half down, Took the vestal sister's gown, Tried it on, burst through its shroud, As the sun burns through a cloud: Flung it from her split and rent; Said: “This cerement sad was meant For some creature stunted, thin, Breastless, blighted, bones and skin.” Then the sage's robe she tried, Muffling in its long folds wide All her lithe and glorious grace: “I should stumble every pace! This big bag was meant to hold Some poor sluggard fat and old, Limping, shuffling wearily, With a form not fit to see!” So she flung it off again With a gesture of disdain. Naked as the midnight moon, Naked as the sun of noon, Burning too intensely bright, Clothed in its own dazzling light; Seen less thus than in the shroud Of morning mist or evening cloud; She stood terrible and proud O'er the pallid quivering crowd. At a gesture ere they wist, Perched a falcon on her wrist, And she whispered to the bird Something it alone there heard; Then she threw it off: when thrown Straight it rose as falls a stone, Arrow-swift on high, on high, Till a mere speck in the sky; Then it circled round and round, Till, as if the prey were found, Forth it darted on its quest Straight away into the West. . . . Every eye that watched its flight Felt a sideward flash of light, All were for a moment dazed, Then around intently gazed: What had passed them? Where was She, The offended deity? O'er the city, o'er the bay, They beheld her melt away, Melt away beyond their quest Through the regions of the west; While the eagle screamed rauque ire, And the lion roared like fire. That same night both priest and sage Died accursed in sombre rage. Never more in wild wood green Was that glorious Goddess seen, Never more: and from that day Evil hap and dull decay Fell on countryside and town; Life and vigour dwindled down; Storms in Spring nipped bud and sprout, Summer suns shed plague and drought, Autumn's store was crude and scant, Winter snows beleaguered want; Vines were black at vintage-tide, Flocks and herds of murrain died; Fishing boats came empty home, Good ships foundered in the foam; Haggard traders lost all heart Wandering through the empty mart: For the air hung thick with gloom, Silence, and the sense of doom. But those little children she Had caressed so tenderly Were betrothed that self-same night, Grew up beautiful and bright, Lovers through the years of play Forward to their marriage-day. Three long moons of bridal bliss Overflowed them; after this, With his bride and with a band Of the noblest in the land, Youths and maidens, wedded pairs Scarcely older in life's cares, He took ship and sailed away Westward Ho from out the bay: Portioned from their native shrine With the Sacred Fire divine, They will cherish while they roam, Quenchless 'mid the salt sea foam, Till it burns beneath a dome In some new and far-off home. As they ventured more and more In that ocean without shore, And some hearts were growing cold At the emprise all too bold, It is said a falcon came Down the void blue swift as flame; Every sunset came to rest On the prow's high curving crest, Every sunrise rose from rest Flying forth into the west; And they followed, faint no more, Through that ocean without shore. Three moons crescent fill and wane O'er the solitary main, When behold a green shore smile: It was that Atlantic isle, Drowned beneath the waves and years, Whereof some faint shadow peers Dubious through the modern stream Of Platonic legend-dream. High upon that green shore stood She who left their native wood; Glorious, and with solemn hand Beckoned to them there to land. Though She forthwith disappeared As the wave-worn galley neared, They knew well her presence still Haunted stream and wood and hill. There they landed, there grew great, Founders of a mighty state: There the Sacred Fire divine Burned within a wondrous shrine Which Her statue glorified Throughout many kingdoms wide. There those children wore the crown To their children handed down Many and many a golden age Blotted now from history's page; Till the last of all the line Leagued him with the other nine Great Atlantic kings whose hosts Ravaged all the Mid Sea coasts: Then the whelming deluge rolled Over all those regions old; Thrice three thousand years before Solon questioned Egypt's lore. Plato: the Timæus, and the Critias. 1866–7. THE THREE THAT SHALL BE ONE Love on the earth alit, Come to be Lord of it; Looked round and laughed with glee, Noble my empery! Straight ere that laugh was done Sprang forth the royal sun, Pouring out golden shine Over the realm divine. Came then a lovely may, Dazzling the new-born day, Wreathing her golden hair With the red roses there, Laughing with sunny eyes Up to the sunny skies, Moving so light and free To her own minstrelsy. Love with swift rapture cried, Dear Life, thou art my bride! Whereto, with fearless pride, Dear Love, indeed thy bride! All the earth's fruit and flowers, All the world's wealth are ours; Sun, moon, and stars gem Our marriage diadem. So they together fare, Lovely and joyous pair; So hand in hand they roam All through their Eden home; Each to the other's sight An ever-new delight: Blue heaven and blooming earth Joy in their darling's mirth. Who comes to meet them now,— She with the pallid brow, Wreathing her night-dark hair With the red poppies there, Pouring from solemn eyes Gloom through the sunny skies, Moving so silently In her deep reverie? Life paled as she drew near, Love shook with doubt and fear. Ah, then, she said, in truth (Eyes full of yearning ruth), Love, thou would'st have this Life, Fair may! to be thy wife? Yet at an awful shrine Wert thou not plighted mine? Pale, paler poor Life grew; Love murmured, It is true! How could I thee forsake? From the brief dream I wake. Yet, O belovèd Death, See how she suffereth; Ere we from earth depart Soothe her, thou tender heart! Faint on the ground she lay; Love kissed the swoon away; Death then bent over her, Death the sweet comforter! Whispered with tearful smile, Wait but a little while, Then I will come for thee; We are one family. 1863. ART I. What precious thing are you making fast In all these silken lines? And where and to whom will it go at last? Such subtle knots and twines! I am tying up all my love in this, With all its hopes and fears, With all its anguish and all its bliss, And its hours as heavy as years. I am going to send it afar, afar, To I know not where above; To that sphere beyond the highest star Where dwells the soul of my Love. But in vain, in vain, would I make it fast With countless subtle twines; For ever its fire breaks out at last, And shrivels all the lines. II. If you have a carrier-dove That can fly over land and sea; And a message for your Love, “Lady, I love but thee!” And this dove will never stir But straight from her to you, And straight from you to her; As you know and she knows too. Will you first ensure, O sage, Your dove that never tires With your message in a cage, Though a cage of golden wires? Or will you fling your dove: “Fly, darling, without rest, Over land and sea to my Love, And fold your wings in her breast”? III. Singing is sweet; but be sure of this, Lips only sing when they cannot kiss. Did he ever suspire a tender lay While her presence took his breath away? Had his fingers been able to toy with her hair Would they then have written the verses fair? Had she let his arm steal round her waist Would the lovely portrait yet be traced? Since he could not embrace it flushed and warm He has carved in stone the perfect form. Who gives the fine report of the feast? He who got none and enjoyed it least. Were the wine really slipping down his throat Would his song of the wine advance a note? Will you puff out the music that sways the whirl, Or dance and make love with a pretty girl? Who shall the great battle-story write? Not the hero down in the thick of the fight. Statues and pictures and verse may be grand, But they are not the Life for which they stand. 1865. PHILOSOPHY I. His eyes found nothing beautiful and bright, Nor wealth nor honour, glory nor delight, Which he could grasp and keep with might and right. Flowers bloomed for maidens, swords outflashed for boys, The world's big children had their various toys; He could not feel their sorrows and their joys. Hills held a secret they would not unfold, In careless scorn of him the ocean rolled, The stars were alien splendours high and cold. He felt himself a king bereft of crown, Defrauded from his birthright of renown, Bred up in littleness with churl and clown. II. How could he vindicate himself? His eyes, That found not anywhere their proper prize, Looked through and through the specious earth and skies. They probed, and all things yielded to their probe; They saw the void around the massy globe, The raging fire within its flowery robe. They pierced through beauty; saw the bones, the mesh Of nerves and veins, the hideous raw red flesh, Beneath the skin most delicate and fresh: Saw Space a mist unfurled around the steep Where plunge Time's waters to the blackest deep; Saw Life a dream in Death's eternal sleep. III. A certain fair form came before his sight, Responding to him as the day to night: To yearning, love; to cold and gloom, warm light. A hope sprang from his breast, and fluttered far On rainbow wings; beyond the cloudy bar, Though very much beneath the nearest star. His eyes drew back their beams to kindle fire In his own heart; whose masterful desire Scorned all beyond its aim, lower or higher. This fire flung lustre upon grace and bloom, Gave warmth and brightness to a little room, Burned Thought to ashes in its fight with gloom. IV. He said: Those eyes alone see well that view Life's lovely surfaces of form and hue; And not Death's entrails, looking through and through. Bones, nerves, and veins, and flesh, are covered in By this opaque transparency of skin, Precisely that we should not see within. The corpse is hid, that Death may work its vile Corruption in black secrecy; the while Our saddest graves with grass and fair flowers smile. If you will analyse the bread you eat, The water and the wine most pure and sweet, Your stomach soon must loathe all drink and meat. Life liveth but in Life, and doth not roam To other realms if all be well at home: “Solid as ocean-foam,” quoth ocean-foam. If Midge will pine and curse its hours away Because Midge is not Everything For-aye, Poor Midge thus loses its one summer day; Loses its all—and winneth what, I pray? 1866. LIFE'S HEBE In the early morning-shine Of a certain day divine, I beheld a Maiden stand With a pitcher in her hand; Whence she poured into a cup Until it was half filled up Nectar that was golden light In the cup of crystal bright. And the first who took the cup With pure water filled it up; As he drank then, it was more Ruddy golden than before: And he leapt and danced and sang As to Bacchic cymbals' clang. But the next who took the cup With the red wine filled it up; What he drank then was in hue Of a heavy sombre blue: First he reeled and then he crept, Then lay faint but never slept. And the next who took the cup With the white milk filled it up; What he drank at first seemed blood, Then turned thick and brown as mud: And he moved away as slow As a weary ox may go. But the next who took the cup With sweet honey filled it up; Nathless that which he did drink Was thin fluid black as ink: As he went he stumbled soon, And lay still in deathlike swoon. She the while without a word Unto all the cup preferred; Blandly smiled and sweetly laughed As each mingled his own draught. And the next who took the cup To the sunshine held it up, Gave it back and did not taste; It was empty when replaced: First he bowed a reverent bow, Then he kissed her on the brow. But the next who took the cup Without mixture drank it up; When she took it back from him It was full unto the brim: He with a right bold embrace Kissed her sweet lips face to face. Then she sang with blithest cheer: Who has thirst, come here, come here! Nectar that is golden light In the cup of crystal bright, Nectar that is sunny fire Warm as warmest heart's desire: Pitcher never lacketh more, Arm is never tired to pour: Honey, water, milk, or wine Mingle with the draught divine, Drink it pure, or drink it not; Each is free to choose his lot: Am I old? or am I cold? Only two have kissed me bold! She was young and fair and gay As that young and glorious day. 1866. A POLISH INSURGENT What would you have? said I; Some time after writing this I found that the great Balzac, in La Cousine Bette, dwells on this very phrase, “Que voulezvous?” as characteristic of the gallant and reckless Poles. 'Tis so easy to go and die, 'Tis so hard to stay and live, In this alien peace and this comfort callous, Where only the murderers get the gallows, Where the jails are for rogues who thieve. 'Tis so easy to go and die, Where our Country, our Mother, the Martyr, Moaning in bonds doth lie, Bleeding with stabs in her breast, Her throat with a foul clutch prest, Under the thrice-accursed Tartar. But Smith, your man of sense, Ruddy, and broad, and round—like so! Kindly—but dense, but dense, Said to me: “Do not go: It is hopeless; right is wrong; The tyrant is too strong.” Must a man have hope to fight? Can a man not fight in despair? Must the soul cower down for the body's weakness, And slaver the devil's hoof with meekness, Nor care nor dare to share Certain defeat with the right? They do not know us, my Mother! They know not our love, our hate! And how we would die with each other, Embracing proud and elate, Rather than live apart In peace with shame in the heart. No hope!—If a heavy anger Our God hath treasured against us long, His lightning-shafts from His thunder-clangour Raining a century down: We have loved when we went most wrong; He cannot for ever frown. No hope!—We can haste to be killed, That the tale of the victims get filled; The more of the debt we pay, The less on our sons shall weigh: This star through the baleful rack of the cope Burns red; red is our hope. O our Mother, thou art noble and fair! Fair and proud and chaste, thou Queen! Chained and stabbed in the breast, Thy throat with a foul clutch prest; Yet around thee how coarse, how mean, Are these rich shopwives who stare! Art thou moaning, O our Mother, through the swoon Of thine agony of desolation?— “Do my sons still love me? or can they stand Gazing afar from a foreign land, Loving more peace and gold—the boon Of a people strange, of a sordid nation?” O our Mother, moan not thus! We love you as you love us, And our hearts are wild with thy sorrow: If we cannot save thee, we are blest Who can die on thy sacred bleeding breast.— So we left Smith-Land on the morrow, And we hasten across the West. 1863. L'ANCIEN RÉGIME; OR, THE GOOD OLD RULE Who has a thing to bring For a gift to our lord the king, Our king all kings above? A young girl brought him love; And he dowered her with shame, With a sort of infamous fame, And then with lonely years Of penance and bitter tears: Love is scarcely the thing To bring as a gift for our king. Who has a thing to bring For a gift to our lord the king? A statesman brought him planned Justice for all the land; And he in recompense got Fierce struggle with brigue and plot, Then a fall from lofty place Into exile and disgrace: Justice is never the thing To bring as a gift for our king. Who has a thing to bring For a gift to our lord the king? A writer brought him truth; And first he imprisoned the youth; And then he bestowed a free pyre That the works might have plenty of fire, And also to cure the pain Of the headache called thought in the brain: Truth is a very bad thing To bring as a gift for our king. Who has a thing to bring For a gift to our lord the king? The people brought their sure Loyalty fervid and pure; And he gave them bountiful spoil Of taxes and hunger and toil, Ignorance, brutish plight, And wholesale slaughter in fight: Loyalty's quite the worst thing To bring as a gift for our king. Who has a thing to bring For a gift to our lord the king? A courtier brought to his feet Servility graceful and sweet, With an ever ready smile And an ever supple guile; And he got in reward the place Of the statesman in disgrace: Servility's always a thing To bring as a gift for our king. Who has a thing to bring For a gift to our lord the king? A soldier brought him war, La gloire, la victoire, Ravage and carnage and groans, For the pious Te Deum tones; And he got in return for himself Rank and honours and pelf: War is a very fine thing To bring as a gift for our king. Who has a thing to bring For a gift to our lord the king? A harlot brought him her flesh, Her lusts, and the manifold mesh Of her wiles intervolved with caprice; And he gave her his realm to fleece, To corrupt, to ruin, and gave Himself for her toy and her slave: Harlotry's just the thing To bring as a gift for our king. Who has a thing to bring For a gift to our lord the king? Our king who fears to die? A priest brought him a lie, The blackness of hell uprolled In heaven's shining gold; And he got as guerdon for that A see and a cardinal's hat: A lie is an excellent thing To bring as a gift for our king. Has any one yet a thing For a gift to our lord the king? The country gave him a tomb, A magnificent sleeping-room; And for this it obtained some rest, Clear riddance of many a pest, And a hope which it much enjoyed That the throne would continue void: A tomb is the very best thing For a gift to our lord the king. 1867. E. B. B. The white-rose garland at her feet, The crown of laurel at her head, Her noble life on earth complete, Lay her in the last low bed For the slumber calm and deep: “He giveth His belovèd sleep.” Soldiers find their fittest grave In the field whereon they died; So her spirit pure and brave Leaves the clay it glorified To the land for which she fought With such grand impassioned thought. Keats and Shelley sleep at Rome, She in well-loved Tuscan earth; Finding all their death's long home Far from their old home of birth. Italy, you hold in trust Very sacred English dust. Therefore this one prayer I breathe,— That you yet may worthy prove Of the heirlooms they bequeath Who have loved you with such love: Fairest land while land of slaves Yields their free souls no fit graves. 1861. POLYCRATES ON WATERLOO BRIDGE Let no mortals dare to be Happier in their lives than we: Thus the jealous gods decree. This decree was never heard, Never by their lips averred, Yet on high stands registered. I have read it, and I fear All the gods above, my Dear, All must envy us two here. Let us, then, propitiate These proud satraps of sole Fate; Our hearts' wealth is all too great. Say, what rich and cherished thing Can I to the river fling As a solemn offering? O belovèd Meerschaum Pipe, Whose pink bloom would soon be ripe, Must thou be the chosen type? Cloud-compeller! Foam o' the Sea, Whence rose Venus fair and free On some poet's reverie! In the sumptuous silken-lined Case where thou hast lain enshrined Thou must now a coffin find! And, to drag thee surely down, Lo! I tie my last half-crown: We shall have to walk through town. Penny toll is paid, and thus All the bridge is free to us; But no cab, nor even a 'bus! Far I fling thee through the gloom; Sink into thy watery tomb, O thou consecrate to Doom! May no sharp police, while they track Spoils thrown after some great “crack,” Ever, ever bring thee back! No mudlarkers, who explore Every ebb the filthy floor, Bring thee to the day once more! No sleek cook—I spare the wish; Dead dogs, cats, and suchlike fish, Surely are not yet a dish? . . . Gods! the dearest, as I wis, Of my treasures offered is; Pardon us our heavenly bliss! What Voice murmurs full of spleen? Not that Pipe, but—Ssss! how mean All the gods have ever been! 1865. SHAMELESS Kew Gardens. That irreverent scoundrel grinned as he passed; And perhaps we did look silly! As I on you those sheep's eyes cast, Which you cast back willy-nilly: While both my hands patted your dear little hand, As if in a fit of abstraction; And you let it lie at their command, Quite unaware of the action! A deaf mute, say, for the first time sees A youth and a damsel dancing, With their bows, twirls, shuffles, and one-two-threes, Retreating and advancing. He hears not the music, he finds no cause For such bewildering antic; He thinks the poor creatures obey no laws, But are certainly daft or frantic. So one who has felt not the love which rules And stirs, the harmonious passion, Must deem us lovers demented fools To act in so queer a fashion. I have heard that this theme in the assonant rhyme Has been sung with a beauty entrancing: The Spaniards have ever been sublime In passionate love and dancing. 1865. THE FIRE THAT FILLED MY HEART OF OLD I The fire that filled my heart of old Gave lustre while it burned; Now only ashes grey and cold Are in its silence urned. Ah! better was the furious flame, The splendour with the smart: I never cared for the singer's fame, But, oh! for the singer's heart Once more— The burning fulgent heart! II No love, no hate, no hope, no fear, No anguish and no mirth; Thus life extends from year to year, A flat of sullen dearth. Ah! life's blood creepeth cold and tame, Life's thought plays no new part: I never cared for the singer's fame, But, oh! for the singer's heart Once more— The bleeding passionate heart! 1864. TWO SONNETS I “Why are your songs all wild and bitter sad As funeral dirges with the orphans' cries? Each night since first the world was made hath had A sequent day to laugh it down the skies. Chant us a glee to make our hearts rejoice, Or seal in silence this unmanly moan.” My friend, I have no power to rule my voice: A spirit lifts me where I lie alone, And thrills me into song by its own laws; That which I feel, but seldom know, indeed Tempering the melody it could not cause. The bleeding heart cannot for ever bleed Inwardly solely: on the wan lips too Dark blood will bubble ghastly into view. II Striving to sing glad songs, I but attain Wild discords sadder than Grief's saddest tune; As if an owl with his harsh screech should strain To over-gratulate a thrush of June. The nightingale upon its thorny spray Finds inspiration in the sullen dark; The kindling dawn, the world-wide joyous day Are inspiration to the soaring lark; The seas are silent in the sunny calm, Their anthem-surges in the tempest boom; The skies outroll no solemn thunder psalm Till they have clothed themselves with clouds of gloom. My mirth can laugh and talk, but cannot sing; My grief finds harmonies in everything. 1860. A SONG OF SIGHING I Would some little joy to-day Visit us, heart! Could it but a moment stay, Then depart, With the flutter of its wings Stirring sense of brighter things. II Like a butterfly astray In a dark room; Telling:—Outside there is day, Sweet flowers bloom, Birds are singing, trees are green, Runnels ripple silver sheen. III Heart! we now have been so long Sad without change, Shut in deep from shine and song, Nor can range; It would do us good to know That the world is not all woe. IV Would some little joy to-day Visit us, heart! Could it but a moment stay, Then depart, With the lustre of its wings Lighting dreams of happy things, O sad my heart! 1868. DAY Waking one morning In a pleasant land, By a river flowing Over golden sand:— Whence flow ye, waters, O'er your golden sand? We come flowing From the Silent Land. Whither flow ye, waters, O'er your golden sand? We go flowing To the Silent Land. And what is this fair realm? A grain of golden sand In the great darkness Of the Silent Land. 1866. NIGHT He cried out through the night: “Where is the light? Shall nevermore Open Heaven's door? Oh, I am left Lonely, bereft!” He cried out through the night: It spread vaguely white, With its ghost of a moon Above the dark swoon Of the earth lying chill, Breathless, grave still. He cried out through the night: His voice in its might Rang forth far and far, And then like a star Dwindled from sense In the Immense. He cried out through the night: No answering light, No syllabled sound; Beneath and around A long shuddering thrill, Then all again still. 1864. VIRTUE AND VICE She was so good, and he was so bad: A very pretty time they had! A pretty time, and it lasted long: Which of the two was more in the wrong? He befouled in the slough of sin; Or she whose piety pushed him in? He found her yet more cold and staid As wedded wife than courted maid: She filled their home with freezing gloom; He felt it dismal as a tomb: Her steadfast mind disdained his toys Of worldly pleasures, carnal joys; Her heart firm-set on things above Was frigid to his earthly love. So he came staggering home at night; Where she sat chilling, chaste, and white: She smiled a scornful virtuous smile, He flung good books with curses vile. Fresh with the early morn she rose, While he yet lay in a feverish doze: She prayed for blessings from the Throne, He called for “a hair of the dog” with a groan: She blessed God for her strength to bear The heavy load,—he 'gan to swear: She sighed, Would Heaven, ere yet too late, Bring him to see his awful state! The charity thus sweetly pressed Made him rage like one possessed. So she grew holier day by day, While he grew all the other way. She left him: she had done her part To wean from sin his sinful heart, But all in vain; her presence might Make him a murderer some mad night. Her family took her back, pure saint, Serene in soul, above complaint: The narrow path she strictly trod, And went in triumph home to God: While he into the Union fell, Our halfway house on the road to Hell. With which would you rather pass your life The wicked husband or saintly wife? 1865. LOW LIFE AS OVERHEARD IN THE TRAIN. That jolly old gentleman, bless his white hat! Wouldn't come in to spoil our chat; We are alone and we can speak,— What have you done, Miss, all the week? “Oh, all the day it's been fit and shew, And all the night it's been trim and sew, For the ladies are flocking to Exeter Hall In lovely light dresses fit for a ball.” Under your eye a little dark streak, And a point of red on the top of your cheek, And your temples quite dim against your hair; This sha'n't last very much longer I swear. And what is the news from the workroom now? “The week began with a bit of a row; Emmy Harley married young Earl Just in the busy time!”—sensible girl! “That was on Monday; Missis said It was very ungrateful, very ill-bred, And very unkind to us when she knew The work so heavy, the hands so few. “But this was nothing: the minute we woke On Wednesday, before it seemed any one spoke, We knew that poor Mary Challis was dead; Kate Long had been sleeping in the same bed. “Mary worked with us till twelve, when tea Was brought in to keep us awake, but she Was so ill then, Miss Cooper sent her to bed; And there in the morning they found her dead; “With Kate fast asleep by her side: they had come To see how she was, and the sight struck them dumb: At last they roused Kate and led her away; She was sick and shuddering all the day. “Kate says when she went up at four to their room She was stupid with sleep; but she marked a faint bloom On Mary's pale face, and she heard her breathe low— A light fluttering breath now quick and now slow; “And feared to disturb her, for she had a cough, But the moment she laid her head down she was off, And knew nothing more till they stood by the side Of the bed: p'r'aps Mary slept on till she died. “They buried her yesterday. Kate was there, And she was the only one Missis could spare; Some dresses were bound to be finished by night, For the ladies to go in to Church all right. “Poor Mary! she didn't fear dying, she said, Her father drinks and her mother is dead; But she hoped that in Heaven the white garments wear For ever; no fashions and dressmaking There.” My Love, if the ladies most pious of all Who flock to the Church and to Exeter Hall Find Heaven has but one dress for rich as for poor, And no fashions, they'll very soon cut it I'm sure. I saw you ten minutes on Tuesday night, Then I took the 'bus home for I had to write; And I wrote and I wrote like an engine till five, When my fingers were dead and the letters alive. A fair bill of costs from a deuce of a draft In our Cashier's worst scrawl like Chinese ran daft; With entries between, on the margin, the back, And figures like short-hand marks put to the rack. But our Common-law Clerk is going away, And the Gov'nor had me in yesterday, And said he would try me, he thought I might do; And I jumped at the chance, for this child thinks so too. Just fancy, each morning a jolly good walk, And instead of the copying, bustle and talk! And if I do well—and well I will do— A couple of sovs. a week for my screw! And then when I'm free of the desk and the stool, Do you think you will keep to the nunnery rule Of the shop, till you go off like Mary some night Smothered in work from the air and the light? We'll use our professional talents, my dear: You shall make such a wedding dress, best of the year! And a wonderful marriage-deed I will draw With magnificent settlements perfect in law. Thus doing our duties in those states of life In which it has pleased God to call us, my wife! “And how much a year will you settle on me?” My body and soul and—what we shall see. 1865. PROLOGUE TO THE PILGRIMAGE TO SAINT NICOTINE OF THE HOLY HERB In every country and in every age Have men been wont to go on pilgrimage, As I have read,—each visiting that shrine Which seems to him most blessèd and divine; Athwart far lands, athwart the wild sea foam: Some to Jerusalem, and some to Rome; And some to Lourdes,—très lourdes, très lourdes God wot, Les pauvres âmes which seek that sacred spot; And some to Santiago far in Spain, Anear the roar of the Atlantic main; And some unto our Lady of Lorette,— Full many votaries this Dame doth get: The very Paynims bring their vows and prayers To Mecca and to Yeddo and Benares: While others piously seek out the tombs Of mighty men who have fulfilled their dooms, The fields where battles long ago were fought, The scenes wherever wondrous works were wrought, The sites of antique cities overthrown, The fanes of fair gods dead and turned to stone:— What need write more? when saint and bard and sage Declare our whole life but one Pilgrimage; A journey from the cradle to the bier Of all the restless millions wandering here; A toilsome travel of all things alive Unto the Temple where they all arrive, And bowing down before the Shrine of Death Find peace at last in breathing their last breath. But furthermore thus teacheth the wise man; That age by age our human caravan Is like unto all those that went before And all that shall come after evermore: New names, new robes, new thoughts and words and deeds, New toys and treasures, sciences and creeds But ever the same passions and same needs: The same old Drama on the same old Stage, The same old tears and laughters, joy and rage; The selfsame characters upon the Scene, Wise, foolish, rich and poor, and great and mean Old actors fall away with weary hearts, Fresh actors come to take the selfsame parts; And whosoe'er the destined rôles may fill, Hamlet is Hamlet—Osric, Osric still; And ever with the fifth act come the knaves To vent their clownish jests and dig the graves; And ever with the last scene entereth Some princely one demanding—“O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell? And so the Play is over: very well, It shall be played again, and have a run, Coëval with the earth's around the sun. Lo this is what men call philosophie, Whereof I know not anything perdie, But it hath brought us to our proper theme, Our Card of beauty and of joy supreme, Our peerless Pilgrimage unto the Shrine Of most beneficent Saint Nicotine. Five hundred years agone Dan Chaucer went A-riding through the pleasant lanes of Kent, In April on the eight and twentieth day, Which were with us I ween a week in May, There has been much learned astronomical discussion, of dubious import, about the exact time of the year, as indicated in the opening of the Prologue to the “Canterbury Tales.” If the deep scientific gentlemen engaged had but condescended to look forward to the Man of Law's Prologue they might have read in the beginning thereof— “And though he [the host] were not depe expert in lore, He wiste it was the eighte and twenty day Of April, that is messager to May.” This may suffice to fix the date accurately enough for us who are not astronomers. The Old Style, I suppose, would then be about eight days behind the New, as the difference I believe increases three days in every four centuries (one in each of the three which is not a multiple of four), and was eleven days in 1752, when the New Style was adopted in England (we all know how the populace vociferously demanded the eleven days of which they conceived themselves defrauded): the Russians, who keep to the Old Style, now date twelve days behind us. Thus Chaucer's April 28 would be our May 6. In reading Herrick and his contemporaries on the delights of going a-Maying, we are apt to forget that their May-day the 1st was our 11th; so with many old weather proverbs. He and his compagnie of twenty-nine, Both men and women, to the holy shrine Of Him by hot Knights at the altar slain, And now by Master Froude killed over again All in cold blood; alas! a piteous doom, Sword-pierced in life and pen-pierced in the tomb: But Master Freeman now hath set to work To maul this Froude as if he were a Turk; And he who kicked A'Becket as he lay Is like to kick the bucket in this fray. This compagnie it was of all degrees, The high, the low, the midway; and all these, Yea, each and all, our Poet doth rehearse And picture lifelike in his cordial verse; As sweet and rath as his own daisy was “Upon the smalè, softè, swotè gras,” As rich and free and cheerful as the gush Of gratulation from a mid-June thrush: I rede you read him once and twice and thrice, And over again; it is my boon advice; And learn what all these men and women were In mind and body, state and garb and air; And feel what full red-blooded life did flow Thorough their veins five hundred years ago; And find what Tales they told upon their way Of noble tragedy and jolly play; And see that we are now what they were then, Since fashions change, not women, neither men. What this first Poet, whom we love so well, Of merrie England, in his verse did tell Of these glad Pilgrims, both their mind and make, That Artist of the Visions clepèd Blake, Who also sang delightful young-world songs, Soaring aloof from all our old-world wrongs, Did picture forth with pencil and engrave, Form after form to match the Poet brave: We touch not him, for he was grand and wild; We leave this giant who became a child. A graceful limner, Stothard was his name, Did set himself to enterprise the same, And him we follow in our noble Card; But whereas he went backward to the Bard Through all the centuries, to match his rhyme, We choose our Pilgrims from our very time: For why? our Saint is not the Saint of old, But hath more votaries a hundredfold; Lo you shall hear of him anon, but first Behoves the jolly Pilgrims be rehearsed; New Saint, New Pilgrims, but the counterparts Of Chaucer's rout en route in brains and hearts. 1878. VERSICLES Wherever on this round earth Your shaft shall enter, Strike it straight, and never fear But you'll reach at last the centre. Each doth by his birth belong To some sphere wherein he's strong; Nine of ten with passion seek Alien spheres wherein they're weak; Whence in almost every man Such incongruous Will and Can. Dear Mother Earth, tell us, tell us, tell us! What is the meaning of all the things we see?— Oh! what a family of puny little fellows, Calling me always, Tellus, Tellus, Tellus! Eat your bread, drink your wine, snatch at all you see; But I am very busy, do not bother me. November 1866. L'ENVOY When the sixties are outrun, And the seventies nearly done, Or the eighties just begun; May some young and happy man, Wiser, kinder, nobler than He who tenders this one, bring You the real Magic Ring. This one may have pleasant powers; Charming idle girlish hours With its tales from færie bowers; Tinting hopeful maiden dreams With its soft romantic gleams; Breathing love of love and truth, Valour, innocence and ruth. But may that one bless the life Of the woman and the wife Through our dull world's care and strife; Year by year with rich increase, Give you love, and joy, and peace; And at last the good death bring, Sweet as sleep: your Magic Ring. Sunday LILAH, ALICE, HYPATIA, 14/2/69. Who was Lilah? I am sure She was young and sweet and pure; With the forehead wise men love,— Here a lucid dawn above Broad curved brows, and twilight there, Under the deep dusk of hair. And her eyes? I cannot say Whether brown, or blue, or grey: I have seen them brown, and blue, And a soft green grey—the hue Shakespeare loved (and he was wise), “Grey as glass” were Silvia's eyes. So to Lilah's name above I will add two names I love, Linking with the bracket curls Three sweet names of three sweet girls, Sunday of Saint Valentine, Eighteen hundred sixty nine. CREEDS AND MEN Twohosts received me in one day, And poured their best to greet my stay; The bottles, labels, seals were twins Alike as penalties and sins: Yet one flowed forth the richest wine; The other acid, gall, and brine. Two hosts received me the next day, And poured their best to greet my stay; The bottles, labels, seals in sooth Unlike as falsehood unto truth: Yet both flowed forth a liberal wine Of festal jubilance divine. Seals, labels, bottles are but vain; Regard the spirit they contain. A poor gin-bottle I found one day, Full of the wine of rich Tokay; A Tokay-bottle I found, within Only the vilest vitriol gin: No more of the outward form I ask, But, what is the spirit that fills the flask? 1878. VERSIFICATION OF THOMAS COOPER'S ARGUMENT IN A DEBATE ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD BETWEEN THAT GENTLEMAN AND CHARLES BRADLAUGH My poor friends, I come to you kindly, With a brotherly kiss, not a rod; For I know that sincerely, though blindly, You look up in vain for a God. For a very long time I have sought you— Since we met last the years are now seven— And here I have found you and brought you My Ladder for climbing to Heaven. My wonderful Ladder, that reaches From Self here to God (be not vext); Though its rungs are so few, and though each is A quite simple step from the next. For five years and eight months precisely It has borne me to either extreme, As cleverly, safely, and nicely As those angels of Jacob's sweet dream. You have seen a lamp-lighter at work, friends? Well, just in his fashion I'll stop, Set my Ladder, mount quick, give a jerk, friends, And light up a God at the top. And Bradlaugh, this ignorant fellow, May pelt at my lamp as he likes (Young fools often do so when mellow); I wager no stone of his strikes. I plant it on I; you can never Persuade me I am not, now, here: But as I have not been for ever, I must have a Cause—that is clear. And as I am a personal being, Intelligent, conscious, I claim That the stupidest cannot help seeing My Cause must be ditto—the same. Take another neat step: there is nowhere Where Nothing at all can be found; Wherever our thoughts go, they go where Unlimited Something's around: And the Cause of this infinite Something Must be certainly infinite too; For it would be a monstrous and rum thing To fancy a finite would do. So ourselves and the whole world of Matter Have one Cause—for who would explore (Without he was mad as a hatter) Still backwards forever for more? One cause, without cause, thus eternal; And infinite, therefore the power Of His will uncontrolled is supernal— Omnipotence must be His dower. And this all-wise, all-good, and almighty Creator of spirit and clod, At the top of my Ladder of light, He It is whom we worship as God. O my friends, is the climbing not easy? And are not the steps safe and strong? And how should my Ladder not please ye When I've trusted to it so long? O my luminous, logical Ladder, My natural musical scale, Whose notes swell up gladder and gladder In glory and triumph—all hail! The Cross, though a very good notion, And on the whole rather divine, Inspires no such fervid devotion As doth this grand Ladder of mine. P.S. penn'd for such as Truelove there And Bradlaugh: My God in the sky Is the little round dot up above there Perfecting this neat little i: For i wants the dot for completion, But no dot is wanted by u:— O Plato, much lecturing Grecian, The Metempsychosis is true! 1864. MR. MACCALL AT CLEVELAND HALL (April 15, 1866) Mr. Maccall at Cleveland Hall, Sunday evening—date to fix— Fifteenth April, sixty-six, Speech reported and redacted By a fellow much distracted. I. Who lectures? No mere scorner; Clear-brained, his heart is warm. She sits at the nearest corner Of I will not say what form. II. The Conflict of Opinions In the Present Day, saith Chair. What muff in the British dominions Could dispute that she is fair? III. Mammon-worship is horrid, Plutocracy is base. Dark hair from a fine small forehead; I catch but the still side face. IV. We wallow in mere dimension, The Big to us is Great. If she stood at her utmost tension She might pass four feet eight. V. We lay on colour in splashes, With a mop, or a broom for brush. How dark are her long eyelashes! How pure is her cheek's slight flush! VI. But we have no perception For form—the divinest—now. Each curve there is perfection, In nostril, chin, and brow. VII. Our women are good kind creatures, But they cannot dress at all. Does her bonnet grace her features?— Clear blue with a black lace fall. VIII. Low Church—very low—in the gutter; High Church—as ven'son high. O'er the flower of her face gleams the flutter Of a smile like a butterfly. IX. Herder, Wieland, Lessing; Bossuet, Montalembert. Fine names, but the name worth guessing Is the name of the sweet girl there. X. The individual; true man; Individuality. A man's but one half; some woman The other half must be. XI. Persistent valour the sternest, With love's most gentle grace. How grand is the eye fixed earnest In the half-seen up-turned face! XII. “How did you like the lecture? Was it not beautiful?” I should think she was! “I conjecture That your brains have been gathering wool!” P.S. The Chairman was a rare man; At every telling point He smiled at his post like a jolly host Carving rich cuts from the joint; Which the name he bore was Richard Moore Whom Heaven with grace anoint! That conflict of opinion It had its counterpart In conflict for dominion Between my head and heart. April 16, 1866. BILL JONES ON PRAYER Well, I'm not much of a hand at prayer, It's hardly in my line; I am pretty fair at a laugh and a swear, But a duffer at a whine. And if so be that a God there be On high above the sun, Why, who can know so well as he, What's the best thing to be done? And since he is no less good than wise, And has all power thereto, Why should one pester him with cries Of what he ought to do? God helpeth him who helps himself, They preach to us as a fact, Which seems to lay up God on the shelf, And leave the man to act. Which seems to mean—You do the work, Have all the trouble and pains, While God, that Indolent Grand Old Turk, Gets credit for the gains. November 1, 1880. EPIGRAMS IPHIGENIA À LA MODE How many a noble father since Agamemnon sinned, Has sacrificed his daughter just to raise the wind! 1864. LOVE'S LOGIC Love's Logic: I am and thou art . . . . must be marriage. (A syllogism who will dare disparage.) 1865. A TIMELY PRAYER Thou great Physician, fair play is divine To “M.D.” add “V.S.”; for, by the powers, The cattle on a thousand hills are thine, The cattle with a thousand ills are ours. This was written at a time when the cattle-plague was very prevalent. 1866. WHO KILLED MOSES? Who killed poor Moses? Goethe supposes That the terrible son Of a masculine Nun, And Caleb his crony, Whose sire is Jephone, Together killed Moses; So Goethe supposes! 1866. SUGGESTED FROM SOUTHAMPTON Mr. Kingsley's faith is just What a candidate should swear; Mr. Kingsley takes on trust All these trifles light as Eyre. This refers to Mr. Kingsley's professed faith in the necessity of the severe measures taken by Governor Eyre in the suppression of the rebellion in Jamaica. September 1866. POOR INDEED! The earth is the lords' and the fulness thereof, The country and also the towns; Our dear old Queen is our only sov., And she's hardly worth three crowns; And we very much fear when her loss we deplore, The sovereign or crown we shall never see more. April 1871. IN EXITU ISRAEL The Jew came up from the land of Goschen; Now Gladstone makes that land the ocean; A miracle which brings to thought The plaguey wonders Moses wrought. March 1871. THE SUCCESSORS WHO DO NOT SUCCEED I. The first Apostles, called to be Fishers of men in Galilee, By hook or crook, as all agree, Did catch their men by shoal; Now each Successor has his see, Fine gold and silver fish nets he, Some jolly place, p'raps two or three, But never any soul.

CROSS LINES FROM GOETHE (Being No. 67 of the Epigrams dated Venice, 1790) Very much can I put up with. Most things that are trials of temper I in tranquillity bear, as if imposed by a God.

OUR CONGRATULATIONS ON THE RECOVERY OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS Though we have not a God to thank for this grace, Though we care not a fig for the man, We have yet our share in the general joy At the lengthening of his span. Yes, because we scorn himself and his race, And because we love not the crown, We are truly pleased that this model prince May add to its bright renown. If we wished him well we might wish him gone; As it is, we rejoice in his breath; For his life is likely to damage the throne Such a great deal more than his death. January 1872.

SONG [“The Nightingale was not yet heard] “The Nightingale was not yet heard, For the Rose was not yet blown.” “Traveller in Persia” (Mr. Binning); cited by Mr. Fitzgerald in the notes to his translation of Omar Khayyam. His heart was quiet as a bird Asleep in the night alone, And never were its pulses stirred To breathe or joy or moan: The Nightingale was not yet heard For the Rose was not yet blown. Then She bloomed forth before his sight In passion and in power, And filled the very day with light, So glorious was her dower; And made the whole vast moonlit night As fragrant as a bower: The young, the beautiful, the bright, The splendid peerless Flower. Whereon his heart was like a bird When Summer mounts his throne, And all its pulses thrilled and stirred To songs of joy and moan, To every most impassioned word And most impassioned tone; The Nightingale at length was heard For the Rose at length was blown. February 1877. WILLIAM BLAKE He came to the desert of London town Grey miles long; He wandered up and he wandered down, Singing a quiet song. He came to the desert of London town, Mirk miles broad; He wandered up and he wandered down, Ever alone with God. There were thousands and thousands of human kind In this desert of brick and stone: But some were deaf and some were blind, And he was there alone. At length the good hour came; he died As he had lived, alone: He was not missed from the desert wide, Perhaps he was found at the Throne. 1866. SUPPLEMENT TO THE INFERNO I.—Relating to the Apotheosis of a Noble Universal Genius. (See especially opening of Canto V., and close of Canto XXI.) “A Great Soul! A great bladder for dried peas to rattle in.” George Eliot, Middlemarch. Ere we left Minos after parleying To trace the second circle's storm of gloom, There came with haughty strides a monstrous Thing Among the spirits crowding for their doom: I ween that when it crossed in Charon's boat No other freightage in that boat found room. Who, what art thou, roared hard the judge's throat, More hugeous than my grandson's fierce man-bull? The thing swelled chanting on a lofty note: I am a poet of the Beautiful, Priest of the Good, and Prophet of the True; Clothed thick with glory as a sheep with wool: I sole have done what twenty great men do; Historian, statesman, orator and sage, Wit, dramatist, and Fiction's master, who Have pictured every clime and every age, Have written everything in every style, And read the Tome of Thought through page by page: The Pilgrim-Genius, travelling mile by mile, This orbèd whole of Matter and Idea, Is comprehensive and not versatile; And I—Be damned! Great Jove, did e'er one see a Creature like this 'mong men or beasts or birds? A dictionary with the diarrhœa Could hardly spout such feculent flux of words: Strip, strip; I cannot judge you till I know What core of life this shaggy bulk engirds. The thing screamed: Aï! Aï! ever woe For the Promethean-souled; uncomprehended By men on earth, abhorred by fiends below, Pursued with fear and jealous anger blended By the monopolising Gods above! Be firm, O Titan heart, thou unbefriended; Nor sour the sweetness of thy solemn love For the Illimitable Fathomless, Wherein the eagle droops as droops the dove, With thought of gnats that sting thy nakedness!— Strip naked first! snarled Minos; and the Shapeless Shape Must piece by piece cast off its wondrous dress: Cloak, tunic, surplice, toga, mantle, cape, Hood, bonnet, hat, boot, slipper, buskin, sock, Bulged slowly to a heap that well might drape A college of professors with their flock, And furnish 'guises for a masquerade, And still leave six old clo'-men ample stock. The process went on till we grew dismayed; The Bulk and Voice together dwindling down: And when at intervals the sad work stayed For desperate protests, Minos with his frown And snarl of Strip, strip! urgent as a whip, Compelled renewal. Ah me! take a brown Ripe Spanish onion, and proceed to strip It very patiently fold after fold; So small at length you'll find the central pip, So large the volume of the swathes unrolled; And even so through piteous tears your eyes That core when reached but dimly will behold. But soon my tears were dashed off by surprise: The Kernel of that Shapeless Shape hopped there Upon its mount of cloth of many dyes, A restless bladder-skin distent with air, And sundry pebbles or baked peas within That rattled as it danced. Then Minos sware, The while some humour curled his savage grin: I sit to judge real living human souls, Not lively windbags: now you next, begin: And went on with his calling o'er the coals As who would make up for lost time. I said, How gayly, Master dear, it leaps and rolls Unto its own dry rhythmus, quick or dead: Where are the Good, the Beautiful, the True? Whither have Wisdom, Wit and Genius fled? And he: That heap of clothes must answer you; I can't think how it ever made them fit on, For they are of all fashions old and new, And of all sizes: whensoe'er it lit on Garments which to its fancy beautiful were Of Greek, Jew, Roman, German, Gaul or Briton; And whether they of linen, silk or wool were It must have begged or filched them for its pile, Till froggy swelled as large as if it bull were: Mark well, those peas which frisk in rapid style From point to point within the orbèd bladder Are comprehensive and not versatile. Then I who always in his smile grew gladder Said: Master, ere in this we touch the ground Behoves another step down reason's ladder: Dried peas within, a tumid film around, Which call you soul, or essence of this wonder? And He: Its soul is hollowness with sound; While it exists these two can never sunder; The selfsame soul in bladder and balloon, In thin pea-rattle and in far-heard thunder: When thou revisitest the sun and moon Remember this, and pay no heed at all To bulks of noisy emptiness. As soon As he had spoken an outreaching squall From the great cyclone of that second cirque Scattered the robes and bore away the ball, Which soon was lost to vision in the mirk; And so I thought Its spurious being ended, And quite forgot it in our serious work. But often afterwards as we descended It flitted past us like a twilight bat, And seemed to hover wheresoe'er we wended; As if endowed with more lives than a cat, Or by its very want of substance safe, Dancing upon the tempest which laid flat Substantial human souls; and it would chafe With its most arid noise our ears intent On solemn words of sinners. Thus the waif Annoyed us much throughout our sad descent Until we stood anear that broken bridge In Malebolge, where the demon lent Us demon escort to the farther ridge. “Et egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.”—A verse too easy to translate. Note that the austere Dante so enjoys this Aristophanic touch that he chuckles over it, not grimly, through twelve lines of grave burlesque opening the following Canto XXII., the only case of such self-indulgence I remember in the Divine Comedy.Just as he blew the signal to set out, The bladder, flung abruptly as a midge Against the troop, became a silent clout, Collapsing pierced by Graffiacave's hook; Who wheeling his third step faced right about And held it forth to Malacoda: Look! If thy sweet lips are moist with trumpeting, Here is a rag to wipe them! and he took. We saw no more of that preposterous Thing. May 1870. DON GIOVANNI AT COVENT GARDEN (June 8, 1866) Who is this appealing, with archly tender feeling, To that sturdy rustic as sullen as a boar? Sweet Zerlina Patti singing Batti, batti; Rustical Masetto sulking sulking more and more. Enviable peasant! sulking must be pleasant Feasted with such beauty, such caresses and such art; Adelina Patti singing Batti, batti, Soul and body singing with the voice that sings Mozart. By that sweet love's token, even had she broken All the ten commandments and twice as many more, I would cry, Dear Patti, singing Batti, batti, Sin and sing, you angel, sin and sing encore! Darling young Zerlina, charming Adelina, Long be you the Hebe of this heavenly music-wine; First, O Patti, Patti, pouring Batti, batti, Then Vedrai carino, the nectar more divine! AQUATICS (KEW) Tommy Tucker came up to Kew, And he got in a boat—an outrigger too: O, but the pity, the pity! For Tommy had made up his mind to show His pals and the gals how well he could row. Would he were safe in the city! The thing like a cradle it rocked in the tide, And he like the blessèd babby inside: O, but the pity, the pity! To hire out such shells so light and so slim, Is cruel as murder, for Tommy can't swim. Would he were safe in the city! And why should they stick out the rowlocks that way? He couldn't keep both hands together in play: O, but the pity, the pity! He spluttered, missed water, and zig-zag'd the boat, Each pull made a lurch, brought his heart in his throat. Would he were safe in the city! The river was crowded behind and before, They chaffed, and they laughed, and they splashed, and they swore: O, but the pity, the pity! He twisted his neck to attend to some shout, A four-oared came rushing, Confound you, look out! Would he were safe in the city! They made him so nervous, those terrible men, That he caught enough crabs for a supper of ten: O, but the pity, the pity! He crept back, a steamer came snorting astern, With hundreds on deck—it gave him a turn: Would he were safe in the city! A mass of strange faces that all stared and laughed, And the more Tommy flustered the more they all chaffed: O, but the pity, the pity! They passed him and roared out, Head on to the swell! But he thought he would rather keep out of it well: Would he were safe in the city! So it caught him broadside, and rolled him away, As a big dog rolls over a puppy in play: O, but the pity, the pity! It rolled him right over—Good Heavens! he'll drown! For his arms they went up, and his head it went down. Would he were safe in the city! Three men dragged him out with a hook through his coat, He was blue in the face and he writhed at the throat: O, but the pity, the pity! They hung his head down, he was limp as a clout, But the water once in him refused to turn out: Would he were safe in the city! To the house by the bridge then they carried him in; He was taken upstairs and stripped to the skin: O, but the pity, the pity! They wrapt him in blankets, he gave a low moan, Then lay there as stark and cold as a stone: Would he were safe in the city. Then they forced down his throttle neat brandy galore, He had taken the pledge, too, a fortnight before: O, but the pity, the pity! As it mixed with the water he woke in a fog, For his belly was full of most excellent grog: Would he were safe in the city! He got very sick, then felt better, he said, Though faintish, and nervous, and queer in the head: O, but the pity, the pity! He paid a big bill, and when it got dark Went off with no wish to continue the lark: Would he were safe in the city! His coat was stitched up, but had shrunk away half, And the legs of his trousers just reached to the calf: O, but the pity, the pity! No hat; they had stuck an old cap on his head; And his watch couldn't tell him the time when he said: Thank God I'm safe in the city! 1865. END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II LAST POEMS A VOICE FROM THE NILE Reprinted by permission from the Fortnightly Review. I come from mountains under other stars Than those reflected in my waters here; Athwart broad realms, beneath large skies, I flow, Between the Libyan and Arabian hills, And merge at last into the great Mid-Sea; And make this land of Egypt. All is mine: The palm-trees and the doves among the palms, The corn-fields and the flowers among the corn, The patient oxen and the crocodiles, The ibis and the heron and the hawk, The lotus and the thick papyrus reeds, The slant-sailed boats that flit before the wind Or up my rapids ropes hale heavily; Yea, even all the massive temple-fronts With all their columns and huge effigies, The pyramids and Memnon and the Sphinx, This Cairo and the City of the Greek As Memphis and the hundred-gated Thebes, Sais and Denderah of Isis queen; Have grown because I fed them with full life, And flourish only while I feed them still. For if I stint my fertilising flood, Gaunt famine reaps among the sons of men Who have not corn to reap for all they sowed, And blight and languishment are everywhere; And when I have withdrawn or turned aside To other realms my ever-flowing streams, The old realms withered from their old renown, The sands came over them, the desert-sands Incessantly encroaching, numberless Beyond my water-drops, and buried them, And all is silence, solitude, and death, Exanimate silence while the waste winds howl Over the sad immeasurable waste. Dusk memories haunt me of an infinite past, Ages and cycles brood above my springs, Though I remember not my primal birth. So ancient is my being and august, I know not anything more venerable; Unless, perchance, the vaulting skies that hold The sun and moon and stars that shine on me; The air that breathes upon me with delight; And Earth, All-Mother, all-beneficent, Who held her mountains forth like opulent breasts To cradle me and feed me with their snows, And hollowed out the great sea to receive My overplus of flowing energy: Blessèd for ever be our Mother Earth. Only, the mountains that must feed my springs Year after year and every year with snows As they have fed innumerable years, These mountains they are evermore the same, Rooted and motionless; the solemn heavens Are evermore the same in stable rest; The sun and moon and stars that shine on me Are evermore the same although they move: I solely, moving ever without pause, Am evermore the same and not the same; Pouring myself away into the sea, And self-renewing from the farthest heights; Ever-fresh waters streaming down and down, The one old Nilus constant through their change. The creatures also whom I breed and feed Perpetually perish and dissolve, And other creatures like them take their place, To perish in their turn and be no more: My profluent waters perish not from life, Absorbed into the ever-living sea Whose life is in their full replenishment. Of all these creatures whom I breed and feed, One only with his works is strange to me, Is strange and admirable and pitiable, As homeless where all others are at home. My crocodiles are happy in my slime, And bask and seize their prey, each for itself, And leave their eggs to hatch in the hot sun, And die, their lives fulfilled, and are no more, And others bask and prey and leave their eggs. My doves they build their nests, each pair its own, And feed their callow young, each pair its own, None serves another, each one serves itself; All glean alike about my fields of grain, And all the nests they build them are alike, And are the self-same nests they built of old Before the rearing of the pyramids, Before great Hekatompylos was reared; Their cooing is the cooing soft and sweet That murmured plaintively at evening-tide In pillared Karnak as its pillars rose; And they are happy floating through my palms. But Man, the admirable, the pitiable, These sad-eyed peoples of the sons of men, Are as the children of an alien race Planted among my children, not at home, Changelings aloof from all my family. The one is servant and the other lord, And many myriads serve a single lord: So was it when the pyramids were reared, And sphinxes and huge columns and wrought stones Were haled long lengthening leagues adown my banks By hundreds groaning with the stress of toil And groaning under the taskmaster's scourge, With many falling foredone by the way, Half-starved on lentils, onions, and scant bread; So is it now with these poor fellaheen To whom my annual bounty brings fierce toil With scarce enough of food to keep-in life. They build mud huts and spacious palaces; And in the huts the moiling millions dwell, And in the palaces their sumptuous lords Pampered with all the choicest things I yield: Most admirable, most pitiable Man. Also their peoples ever are at war, Slaying and slain, burning and ravaging, And one yields to another and they pass, While I flow evermore the same great Nile, The ever-young and ever-ancient Nile: The swarthy is succeeded by the dusk, The dusky by the pale, the pale again By sunburned turbaned tribes long-linen-robed: And with these changes all things change and pass, All things but Me and this old Land of mine, Their dwellings, habitudes, and garbs, and tongues: I hear strange voices; “and Nilus heareth strange voices.” —Sir Thomas Browne. never more the voice Austere priests chanted to the boat of death Gliding across the Acherusian lake, Or satraps parleyed in the Pharaoh's halls; Never the voice of mad Cambyses' hosts, Never the voice of Alexander's Greece, Never the voice of Cæsar's haughty Rome: And with the peoples and the languages, With the great Empires still the great Creeds change; They shift, they change, they vanish like thin dreams, As unsubstantial as the mists that rise After my overflow from out my fields, In silver fleeces, golden volumes, rise, And melt away before the mounting sun; While I flow onward solely permanent Amidst their swiftly-passing pageantry. Poor men, most admirable, most pitiable, With all their changes all their great Creeds change: For Man, this alien in my family, Is alien most in this, to cherish dreams And brood on visions of eternity, And build religions in his brooding brain And in the dark depths awe-full of his soul. My other children live their little lives, Are born and reach their prime and slowly fail, And all their little lives are self-fulfilled; They die and are no more, content with age And weary with infirmity. But Man Has fear and hope and phantasy and awe, And wistful yearnings and unsated loves, That strain beyond the limits of his life, And therefore Gods and Demons, Heaven and Hell: This Man, the admirable, the pitiable. Lo, I look backward some few thousand years, And see men hewing temples in my rocks With seated forms gigantic fronting them, And solemn labyrinthine catacombs With tombs all pictured with fair scenes of life And scenes and symbols of mysterious death; And planting avenues of sphinxes forth, Sphinxes couched calm, whose passionless regard Sets timeless riddles to bewildered time, Forth from my sacred banks to other fanes Islanded in the boundless sea of air, Upon whose walls and colonnades are carved Tremendous hieroglyphs of secret things; I see embalming of the bodies dead And judging of the disembodied souls; I see the sacred animals alive, And statues of the various-headed gods, Among them throned a woman and a babe, The goddess crescent-horned, the babe divine, Then I flow forward some few thousand years, And see new temples shining with all grace, Whose sculptured gods are beautiful human forms. Then I flow forward not a thousand years, And see again a woman and a babe, The woman haloed and the babe divine; And everywhere that symbol of the cross I knew aforetime in the ancient days, The emblem then of life, but now of death. Then I flow forward some few hundred years, And see again the crescent, now supreme On lofty cupolas and minarets Whence voices sweet and solemn call to prayer. So the men change along my changeless stream, And change their faiths; but I yield all alike Sweet water for their drinking, sweet as wine, And pure sweet water for their lustral rites: For thirty generations of my corn Outlast a generation of my men, And thirty generations of my men Outlast a generation of their gods: O admirable, pitiable Man, My child yet alien in my family. And I through all these generations flow Of corn and men and gods, all-bountiful, Perennial through their transientness, still fed By earth with waters in abundancy; And as I flowed here long before they were, So may I flow when they no longer are, Most like the serpent of eternity: Blessèd for ever be our Mother Earth. November 1881. RICHARD FOREST'S MID-SUMMER NIGHT I. The sun is setting in pale lucid gold, From out that strange sweet green The heavens through half their lucid breadth unfold, Unfathomably serene. The moon is risen, formless, vague and wan, Until the glory wane; Less moon as yet than thin white cloud, whereon Young yearning eyes fix fain. The splendour ripples on the broad calm bay Where still some white sails gleam Like sea-birds in the offing far away, Suspended as in dream. The wavelets whisper on the soft sands wide, Soothing their thread of foam, The silver fringe of the advancing tide, Nearer and nearer home. The hammers ringing on the building ships Are ceasing from their chime; Our toils are closing in this sweet eclipse Of tranquil vesper-time. O day slow-dying in the golden west, O far flushed clouds above, O slowly rising moon, your infinite rest Brings infinite longing love. II. But what come forth with the dark, With the dusk of the eve and the night? When the lessening sails of that single barque Shall be wholly lost to sight, And the latest song of the latest lark Shall be mute in the mute moonlight. All the stars come forth on high Like spirits that cast their shrouds, And the solemn depths of the darkening sky Are filled with their radiant crowds, And Hesper, lovely as Love's own eye, Shines beneath purple clouds; And the maidens and youths on earth, On the shores of the sands and the piers, Like a sudden bountiful beautiful birth, In the flower of their happy years, With babble and laughter and musical mirth Under the silent spheres. With the silent stars above, And the maidens and youths below With their murmurs sweeter than voice of the dove, By the calm sea's plash and flow, All the soft warm air breathes bliss and love In the sunset's after-glow. For the burning hours are past, And the toils of the day are done, And the peace of the night is come at last, And the moon succeeds the sun; And the pulses of Heaven and Earth throb fast, All the thousands throbbing as one. III. Oh, a myriad stars may shine, But ever the one sole Moon, The Queen of the stars and the night divine, The Queen most fair and boon, For her mystical shine is Love's best wine, And her midnight Love's own noon. I have heard that the smallest star Is a much more mighty sphere, Than the regnant moon in her silver car That we love and worship here; But behold, the star it is faint and far, While our moon is bright and near. Let the star in its distant skies Burn glorious and great, A sun of life to the far-off eyes In the planets that swell its state; But it sways not the tides of our seas as it rides, Nor the tides of our human fate. So, there on the shining sand, And there on the long curved pier, Fair ladies circle fulgent and grand, Each in her proper sphere; But the sun so far is a little star, While my Love is near and dear: Is near and dear and bright, The Queen of my Heavens above, The pure sweet light of my darkest night, My Lotus, my Lily, my Dove; And my pulses flow and thrill and glow In the sway of Her splendid love. IV. Farewell, fair margent of the sea, Fair city of the noble bay; I seek my Love who looks for me, Not far away, not far away, Over the hill of wood and lea, And near that other bay adown The winding valley lone and lown. The valley with its tethered kine, The orchard plots and fields of grain, So tranquil in the broad sunshine, More tranquil now the high stars reign, And tranquil most and most divine When over it comes floating soon The mystic splendour of the moon. The cottage nestles sheltered well Among rich apple-trees, embowered In its side-nook of dimpled dell; Roses and jasmine starry-flowered Clothe all its front; the tide's long swell Sounds up the valley slow and calm, To ebb away a dying psalm. Through clouds of delicate blossom white The red tiles burn with steadfast glow, Or through green leaves and apples bright And hoary stems a-slanting low, When morning crowns the eastern height; The blue smoke quivering up the air Its slender breath of household prayer; The sweet flowers flush and glow and yearn, With wild bees humming in their bloom, The lane comes winding like a burn Through banks of golden gorse and broom, And edged with grass and fringed with fern; The rapturous larks are singing high In all the regions of the sky. But that is day, these days of June A-verging into hot July, And this is night, more rich and boon, Although its hours so swiftly fly: O light of lovers, gracious moon, My own Moon waits me full of love, Brighter than all heaven's stars above. V. Ere the road curves up through the shade With its transverse moonlight bars, While above in the leafy gloom of the glade Hang the glittering fruits of the stars; Let me pause for a moment and turn and look down Beyond all the villa clumps duskily brown, And beyond all the pale yellow lamps of the town; To the sea and the noble bay Lulled asleep in the broad moonshine; To the shore where our youths and our maidens stray On the sands and the pier's long line, Like a swarm of bees that suspend their flight To gather the honey of love and delight In the heart of the azure-leaved Flower of the Night. Like a swarm of buzzing bees Whose busy murmurs float On the wide-wafting wings of the southerly breeze, Merged into one vague note: They are drunk with the honey of love and of bliss, And they throb with the stars of the azure abyss, And the air is as soft as a tremulous kiss. I shall find Her all alone At the wicket of garden and lane, Or out of the porch by the rose o'ergrown She will glide all flushed and fain: So gather your honey, you bees that swarm, I drink-in my nectar all golden and warm From a flower-cup the fairest in colour and form. VI. Do I love you more for your own grand sake, Or more for the bliss you bring to me? You big black arms of the elms that make The little white arms cling to me. Do I love you more for your own sweet sake, Or more for my heart's desire to me? You flowers of the night whose perfumes make The sweetest breath suspire to me. Do I love you more for your own dear sake, Or more for the joys that rill through me? You nightingales whose voices make The dearest soft voice thrill through me. Do I love you more for your own bright sake, Or more for the joys that stream on me? You stars of the heaven whose glances make The brightest moist eyes beam on me. Do I love you more for your own dear sake, Or more for the bliss possessing me? You whispering waves of the sea that make The dear lips mute caressing me. Do I love you more for your own pure sake, Or more for the Heavens you declare to me? You naked moon, whose splendours make The soul of her pure love bare to me. Oh, I love you all for your own love's sake, And my love of my Love and her love to me, Dear earth and sea and heavens that make This life as the life above to me. VII. She is not there at the rustic gate, Nor in the garden, nor in the porch: Lucy! the hour is not yet late, The moon, our this night's signal torch, The beacon-fire of our heart's desire, Over the wooded promontory Shines on our bay in all her glory. Good Father nods in his old arm-chair, A-dozing over his evening pipe, The old brown jug at his elbow there Half-full of the old ale humming-ripe; For his work is done with the set o' the sun, And he settles down content and placid, Sweetness without one drop of acid. And our little Mother upright sits, Under her glasses glancing keen And listening sharp as she knits and knits; Nothing unheard, nothing unseen; Her work is not done with the set o' the sun, And she never nods and she never dozes Until her head in the bed reposes. Or else the dear old couple play Some game they have played this thirty year; Cribbage,—and how she pegs away! Perhaps Don Pedro when I appear, And Lucy and I must join and try Which shall prove the more prompt and able, Or youth or eld at the old oak-table. But Lucy, Lucy, where is She? Not in the garden, not at the gate, Not in the porch a-looking for me, Not at the parlour-lattice in wait! Can she sew or read and take no heed How the stars are bright and the moon is shining, And I am without here longing and pining? O Lucy, Lucy! can you dream O'er the loves in a book with your own Love near?— Out from the back-shade darts a gleam; Lucy is here! Lucy is here! Dancing light in her eyes of a wicked surprise, White rose in her hair, red rose in her fingers, How she hastens!—and how she lingers! Oh, the smile of your mouth!—but I want my own kiss! Oh, the flush of your face!—but your head on my breast! Oh, the rose in your yellow hair fragrant with bliss! Oh, the rose in your hand by my own hand caressed! O dear form I enlace in this perfect embrace, My Love all a-tremble with passion and yearning, While under my kisses the pure neck is burning! VIII. Oh, how the nights are short, These heavenly nights of June! The long day all amort With toil, the time to court So stinted in its boon! In winter brief work-days, Long rest-nights dark and cold, Dank mists and miry ways, Black boughs and leafless sprays, No sweet birds singing bold. I find this order strange, And not at all the right; Not thus would I arrange: May I propose a change In seasons, day and night? Cold days, warm nights, be long, Cold nights, warm days, be brief: Warm nights of scent and song, Nights long as love is strong,— Oh, Love should have relief! Yet some days we would spare, Long days of love and rest, So long, so rich, so rare, When but to breathe the air Is to be fully blest. When deep in fern we lie With golden gorse above; Deep sapphire sea and sky, Ringing of larks on high, Our whole world breathing love. Long days of perfect rest! Long days of infinite bliss! Your head upon my breast; Possessing and possessed, Dissolving in a kiss. IX. Oh, how the nights are short, These heavenly nights of June! The long hot day amort With toil, the time to court So stinted in its boon! But three or four brief hours Between the afterglow And dawnlight; while the flowers Are dreaming in their bowers, And birds their song forego; And in the noon of night, As in the noon of day, Flowers close on their delight, Birds nestle from their flight, Deep stillness holdeth sway: Only the nightingales Yet sing to moon and stars, Although their full song fails; The corn-crake never quails, But through the silence jars. So few brief hours of peace; And only one for us, Alone, in toil's surcease, To feed on love's increase: It is too cruel thus! Did little Mother chide Because our sewing dropped And we sat dreamy-eyed? Dear Mother, good betide, The scolding must be stopped. Dear Mother, good and true, All-loving while you blame, When spring brings skies of blue And buds and flowers anew, I come in with my claim! I claim my Love, my Own, Yet ever yours the while, Under whose care hath grown The sweetest blossom blown In all our flower-loved isle. The Spring renews its youth And youth renews its Spring: Love's wildest dreams are truth, Magic is sober sooth; Charm of the Magic Ring! X. As we gaze and gaze on the sleeping sea Beneath the moon's soft splendour, The wide expanse inspires a trance Most solemn and most tender. The heavens all silent with their stars, The sweet air hardly breathing, The liquid light of ripples bright Wreathing and interwreathing. The tide self-poised now at the full, Scarce swaying, almost soundless; The sea between twin skies serene, Calm, fathomless and boundless. What specks are we in this vast world, Our little lives how fleeting! While star on star is throbbing far, What matter two hearts beating? How many many million years Those living lights supernal Shone ere our birth on this small earth! Yet they are not eternal. How many many million years, When we have passed death's portal, Those stars shall shine as now divine! Yet they are not immortal. Deep as may be the deepest sea, Yet deeper is our love, dear; Our souls dilate with bliss as great As all the heavens above, dear. We float in dream until we seem With all these worlds revolving; Our love intense, our bliss immense, Throughout the whole dissolving. A calm profound and infinite Within us as without us; Our pulses beat in union sweet With all the Life about us. We are the whole World yet ourself By some divine illusion; The I in Thee and Thou in Me By mystic interfusion. Our soul-tides poising at the full, Scarce swaying, tranced in glory, Have reached the clime of timeless time Amid the transitory. We have not spoken now so long, But mute in still caressing, Without one kiss have breathed the bliss Too perfect for expressing. XI. Good night; good night! how truly hath been sung, It is good night then only when the tongue Need never say Good night; When hearts may beat together till the morrow Dawns on long hours fulfilled of bliss not sorrow, And eyes that close for darkness, frayed and stung By the so less sweet light. Good night; good night! I leave you to sweet sleep And lovely dreams of love divinely deep; May this be your good night: My straining arms reluctantly surrender Into the arms of sleep divinely tender My Dearest thus, to safely surely keep Until the morn shines bright. Good night; good night! I leave you and go back Into the silent city; and, alack! Can this be my good night? Yet Love, Bliss, Memory, radiant Hope are burning In brain all throbbing and in heart all yearning, As moon and stars in skies that else were black With glorifying might. Good night; good night! If parting when so brief Is yet so bitter, what would be our grief With Good-bye for Good night!— Farewell! for weeks, for months, for years, for ever! Alas for Lovers whom the Fates thus sever! Where can they look for comfort or relief? Oh, worse than mortal blight! Good night; good night! for more than twenty hours! The sleeping time of all the birds and flowers, For whom it is good night; The waking time of all the sun's wide glory: Ere yet the moon has crowned yon promontory To-morrow evening, back to Eden's bowers I come with swerveless flight. Good night; good night! my Life, my Love, my Bliss! But one more last embrace, one more last kiss, To sweeten sour Good night: O dear Heavens, have her in your holy keeping! O moon and stars, watch tenderly her sleeping! O sun, thou regent of our World-abyss, Awake her to delight! December 1881. INSOMNIA “Sleepless himself to give to others sleep.” “He giveth His beloved sleep.” I heard the sounding of the midnight hour; The others one by one had left the room, In calm assurance that the gracious power Of sleep's fine alchemy would bless the gloom, Transmuting all its leaden weight to gold, To treasures of rich virtues manifold, New strength, new health, new life; Just weary enough to nestle softly, sweetly, Into divine unconsciousness, completely Delivered from the world of toil and care and strife. Just weary enough to feel assured of rest, Of Sleep's divine oblivion and repose, Renewing heart and brain for richer zest Of waking life when golden morning glows, As young and pure and glad as if the first That ever on the void of darkness burst With ravishing warmth and light; On dewy grass and flowers and blithe birds singing, And shining waters, all enraptured springing, Fragrance and shine and song, out of the womb of night. But I with infinite weariness outworn, Haggard with endless nights unblessed by sleep, Ravaged by thoughts unutterably forlorn, Plunged in despairs unfathomably deep, Went cold and pale and trembling with affright Into the desert vastitude of Night, Arid and wild and black; Foreboding no oasis of sweet slumber, Counting beforehand all the countless number Of sands that are its minutes on my desolate track. And so I went, the last, to my drear bed, Aghast as one who should go down to lie Among the blissfully unconscious dead, Assured that as the endless years flowed by Over the dreadful silence and deep gloom And dense oppression of the stifling tomb, He only of them all, Nerveless and impotent to madness, never Could hope oblivion's perfect trance for ever: An agony of life eternal in death's pall. But that would be for ever, without cure!— And yet the agony be not more great; Supreme fatigue and pain, while they endure, Into Eternity their time translate; Be it of hours and days or countless years, And boundless æons, it alike appears To the crushed victim's soul; Utter despair foresees no termination, But feels itself of infinite duration; The smallest fragment instant comprehends the whole. The absolute of torture as of bliss Is timeless, each transcending time and space; The one an infinite obscure abyss, The other an eternal Heaven of grace.— Keeping a little lamp of glimmering light Companion through the horror of the night, I laid me down aghast As he of all who pass death's quiet portal Malignantly reserved alone immortal, In consciousness of bale that must for ever last. I laid me down and closed my heavy eyes, As if sleep's mockery might win true sleep; And grew aware, with awe but not surprise, Blindly aware through all the silence deep, Of some dark Presence watching by my bed, The awful image of a nameless dread; But I lay still fordone; And felt its Shadow on me dark and solemn And steadfast as a monumental column, And thought drear thoughts of Doom, and heard the bells chime One. And then I raised my weary eyes and saw, By some slant moonlight on the ceiling thrown And faint lamp-gleam, that Image of my awe, Still as a pillar of basaltic stone, But all enveloped in a sombre shroud Except the wan face drooping heavy-browed, With sad eyes fixed on mine; Sad weary yearning eyes, but fixed remorseless Upon my eyes yet wearier, that were forceless To bear the cruel pressure; cruel, unmalign. Wherefore I asked for what I knew too well: O ominous midnight Presence, What art Thou? Whereto in tones that sounded like a knell: “I am the Second Hour, appointed now To watch beside thy slumberless unrest.” Then I: Thus both, unlike, alike unblest; For I should sleep, you fly: Are not those wings beneath thy mantle moulded? O Hour! unfold those wings so straitly folded, And urge thy natural flight beneath the moonlit sky. “My wings shall open when your eyes shall close In real slumber from this waking drear; Your wild unrest is my enforced repose; Ere I move hence you must not know me here.” Could not your wings fan slumber through my brain, Soothing away its weariness and pain? “Your sleep must stir my wings: Sleep, and I bear you gently on my pinions Athwart my span of hollow night's dominions, Whence hour on hour shall bear to morning's golden springs.” That which I ask of you, you ask of me, O weary Hour, thus standing sentinel Against your nature, as I feel and see Against my own your form immovable: Could I bring Sleep to set you on the wing, What other thing so gladly would I bring? Truly the poet saith: If that is best whose absence we deplore most, Whose presence in our longings is the foremost, What blessings equal Sleep save only love and death? I let my lids fall, sick of thought and sense, But felt that Shadow heavy on my heart; And saw the night before me an immense Black waste of ridge-walls, hour by hour apart, Dividing deep ravines: from ridge to ridge Sleep's flying hour was an aërial bridge; But I, whose hours stood fast, Must climb down painfully each steep side hither, And climb more painfully each steep side thither, And so make one hour's span for years of travail last. Thus I went down into that first ravine, Wearily, slowly, blindly, and alone, Staggering, stumbling, sinking depths unseen, Shaken and bruised and gashed by stub and stone; And at the bottom paven with slipperiness, A torrent-brook rushed headlong with such stress Against my feeble limbs, Such fury of wave and foam and icy bleakness Buffeting insupportably my weakness That when I would recall dazed memory swirls and swims. How I got through I know not, faint as death; And then I had to climb the awful scarp, Creeping with many a pause for panting breath, Clinging to tangled root and rock-jut sharp; Perspiring with faint chills instead of heat, Trembling, and bleeding hands and knees and feet; Falling, to rise anew; Until, with lamentable toil and travel Upon the ridge of arid sand and gravel I lay supine half-dead and heard the bells chime Two; And knew a change of Watchers in the room Without a stir or sound beside my bed; Only the tingling silence of the gloom, The muffled pulsing of the night's deep dread; And felt an image mightier to appal, And looked; the moonlight on the bed-foot wall And corniced ceiling white Was slanting now; and in the midst stood solemn And hopeless as a black sepulchral column A steadfast shrouded Form, the Third Hour of the night. The fixed regard implacably austere, Yet none the less ineffably forlorn. Something transcending all my former fear Came jarring through my shattered frame outworn: I knew that crushing rock could not be stirred; I had no heart to say a single word, But closed my eyes again; And set me shuddering to the task stupendous Of climbing down and up that gulf tremendous Unto the next hour-ridge beyond Hope's farthest ken. Men sigh and plain and wail how life is brief: Ah yes, our bright eternities of bliss Are transient, rare, minute beyond belief, Mere star-dust meteors in Time's night-abyss; Ah no, our black eternities intense Of bale are lasting, dominant, immense, As Time which is their breath; The memory of the bliss is yearning sorrow, The memory of the bale clouds every morrow Darkening through nights and days unto the night of Death. No human words could paint my travail sore In the thick darkness of the next ravine, Deeper immeasurably than that before; When hideous agonies, unheard, unseen, In overwhelming floods of torture roll, And horrors of great darkness drown the soul, To be is not to be In memory save as ghastliest impression, And chaos of demoniacal possession. . . . . I shuddered on the ridge, and heard the bells chime Three. And like a pillar of essential gloom, Most terrible in stature and regard, Black in the moonlight filling all the room The Image of the Fourth Hour, evil-starred, Stood over me; but there was Something more, Something behind It undiscerned before, More dreadful than Its dread, Which overshadowed it as with a fateful Inexorable fascination hateful,— A wan and formless Shade from regions of the dead. I shut my eyes against that spectral Shade, Which yet allured them with a deadly charm, And that black Image of the Hour, dismayed By such tremendous menacing of harm; And so into the gulf as into Hell; Where what immeasurable depths I fell, With seizures of the heart Whose each clutch seemed the end of all pulsation, And tremors of exanimate prostration, Are horrors in my soul that never can depart. If I for hope or wish had any force, It was that I might rush down sharply hurled From rock to rock until a mangled corse Down with the fury of the torrent whirled, The fury of black waters and white foam, To where the homeless find their only home, In the immense void Sea, Whose isles are worlds, surrounding, unsurrounded, Whose depths no mortal plummet ever sounded, Beneath all surface storm calm in Eternity. Such hope or wish was as a feeble spark, A little lamp's pale glimmer in a tomb, To just reveal the hopeless deadly dark And wordless horrors of my soul's fixed doom: Yet some mysterious instinct obstinate, Blindly unconscious as a law of Fate, Still urged me on and bore My shattered being through the unfeared peril Of death less hateful than the life as sterile: I shuddered on the ridge, and heard the bells chime Four. The Image of that Fifth Hour of the night Was blacker in the moonlight now aslant Upon its left than on its shrouded right; And over and behind It, dominant, The shadow not Its shadow cast its spell, Most vague and dim and wan and terrible, Death's ghastly aureole, Pregnant with overpowering fascination, Commanding by repulsive instigation, Despair's envenomed anodyne to tempt the Soul. I closed my eyes, but could no longer keep Under that Image and most awful Shade, Supine in mockery of blissful sleep, Delirious with such fierce thirst unallayed; Of all worst agonies the most unblest Is passive agony of wild unrest: Trembling and faint I rose, And dressed with painful efforts, and descended With furtive footsteps and with breath suspended, And left the slumbering house with my unslumbering woes. Constrained to move through the unmoving hours, Accurst from rest because the hours stood still; Feeling the hands of the Infernal Powers Heavy upon me for enormous ill, Inscrutable intolerable pain, Against which mortal pleas and prayers are vain, Gaspings of dying breath, And human struggles, dying spasms yet vainer: Renounce defence when Doom is the Arraigner; Let impotence of Life subside appeased in Death. I paced the silent and deserted streets In cold dark shade and chillier moonlight grey; Pondering a dolorous series of defeats And black disasters from life's opening day, Invested with the shadow of a doom That filled the Spring and Summer with a gloom Most wintry bleak and drear; Gloom from within as from a sulphurous censer Making the glooms without for ever denser, To blight the buds and flowers and fruitage of my year. Against a bridge's stony parapet I leaned, and gazed into the waters black; And marked an angry morning red and wet Beneath a livid and enormous rack Glare out confronting the belated moon, Huddled and wan and feeble as the swoon Of featureless Despair: When some stray workman, half-asleep but lusty, Passed urgent through the rain pour wild and gusty, I felt a ghost already, planted watching there. As phantom to its grave, or to its den Some wild beast of the night when night is sped, I turned unto my homeless home again To front a day only less charged with dread Than that dread night; and after day, to front Another night of—what would be the brunt? I put the thought aside, To be resumed when common life unfolded In common daylight had my brain remoulded; Meanwhile the flaws of rain refreshed and fortified. The day passed, and the night; and other days, And other nights; and all of evil doom; The sun-hours in a sick bewildering haze, The star-hours in a thick enormous gloom, With rending lightnings and with thunder-knells; The ghastly hours of all the timeless Hells:— Bury them with their bane! I look back on the words already written, And writhe by cold rage stung, by self-scorn smitten, They are so weak and vain and infinitely inane. . . . “How from those hideous Malebolges deep I ever could win back to upper earth, Restored to human nights of blessed sleep And healthy waking with the new day's birth?”— How do men climb back from a swoon whose stress, Crushing far deeper than all consciousness, Is deep as deep death seems? Who can the steps and stages mete and number By which we re-emerge from nightly slumber?— Our poor vast petty life is one dark maze of dreams. March 1882. HE HEARD HER SING We were now in the midmost Maytime, in the full green flood of the Spring, When the air is sweet all the daytime with the blossoms and birds that sing; When the air is rich all the night, and richest of all in its noon When the nightingales pant the delight and keen stress of their love to the moon; When the almond and apple and pear spread wavering wavelets of snow In the light of the soft warm air far-flushed with a delicate glow; When the towering chestnuts uphold their masses of spires red or white, And the pendulous tresses of gold of the slim laburnum burn bright, And the lilac guardeth the bowers with the gleam of a lifted spear, And the scent of the hawthorn flowers breathes all the new life of the year, And the linden's tender pink bud by the green of the leaf is o'errun, And the bronze-beech shines like blood in the light of the morning sun, And the leaf-buds seem spangling some network of gossamer flung on the elm, And the hedges are filling their fretwork with every sweet green of Spring's realm; And the flowers are everywhere budding and blowing about our feet, The green of the meadows star-studding and the bright green blades of the wheat. An evening and night of song. For first when I left the town, And took the lane that is long and came out on the breeze-swept down, The sunset heavens were all ringing wide over the golden gorse With the skylarks' rapturous singing, a revel of larks in full force, A revel of larks in the raptures surpassing all raptures of Man, Who ponders the blessings he captures and finds in each blessing some ban. And then I went on down the dale in the light of the afterglow, In that strange light green and pale and serene and pathetic and slow In its fading round to the north, while the light of the unseen moon From the east comes brightening forth an ever-increasing boon. And there in the cottage my Alice, through the hours so short and so long, Kept filled to the brim love's chalice with the wine of music and song: And first with colossal Beethoven, the gentlest spirit sublime Of the harmonies interwoven, Eternity woven with Time; Of the melodies slowly and slowly dissolving away through the soul, While it dissolves with them wholly and our being is lost in the Whole; As gentle as Dante the Poet, for only the lulls of the stress Of the mightiest spirits can know it, this ineffable gentleness: And then with the delicate tender fantastic dreamer of night, Whose splendour is starlike splendour and his light a mystic moonlight, Nocturn on nocturn dreaming while the mind floats far in the haze And the dusk and the shadow and gleaming of a realm that has no days: And then she sang ballads olden, ballads of love and of woe, Love all burningly golden, grief with heart's-blood in its flow; Those ballads of Scotland that thrill you, keen from the heart to the heart, Till their pathos is seeming to kill you, with an exquisite bliss in the smart. And then we went out of the valley and over the spur of the hill, And down by a woodland alley where the sprinkled moonlight lay still; For the breeze in the boughs was still and the breeze was still in the sprays, And the leaves had scarcely a thrill in the stream of the silver rays, But looked as if drawn on the sky or etched with a graver keen, Sharp shadows thrown from on high deep out of the azure serene: And a certain copse we knew, where never in Maytime fails, While the night distils sweet dew, the song of the nightingales: And there together we heard the lyrical drama of love Of the wonderful passionate bird which swelleth the heart so above All other thought of this life, all other care of this earth, Be it of pleasure or strife, be it of sorrow or mirth, Saving the one intense imperious passion supreme Kindling the soul and the sense, making the world but a dream, The dream of an aching delight and a yearning afar and afar, While the music thrills all the void night to the loftiest pulsating star:— “Love, love only, for ever; love with its torture and bliss; All the world's glories can never equal two souls in one kiss.” And when I had bidden farewell to my Love at the cottage door, For a night and a day farewell, for a night and a day and no more, I went down to the shining strand of our own belovèd bay, To the shore of soft white sand caressed by the pure white spray, In the arms of the hills serene, clothed from the base to the crest With garments of manifold green, curving to east and to west; And high in the pale blue south where the clouds were white as wool, Over the little bay-mouth the moon shone near the full; And I walked by the waves' soft moan, for my heart was beyond control, And I needed to be alone with the night and my love and my soul, And I could not think of sleep in the moonlight broad and clear, For a music solemn and deep filled all my spirit's sphere, A music interwoven of all that night I had heard, From the music of mighty Beethoven to the song of the little brown bird. And thus as I paced the shore beneath the azure abyss, And my soul thrilled more and more with a yearning and sadness of bliss, A voice came over the water from over the eastern cape, Like the voice of some ocean daughter wailing a lover's escape,— A voice so plaintive and distant, as faint as a wounded dove, Whose wings are scarcely resistant to the air beneath and above, Wavering, panting, urging from the farthest east to the west, Over some wild sea surging in the hope forlorn of its nest; A voice that quivered and trembled, with falls of a broken heart, And then like that dove reassembled its forces to play out its part; Till it came to a fall that was dying, the end of an infinite grief, A sobbing and throbbing and sighing that death was a welcome relief: And so there was silence once more, and the moonlight looked sad as a pall, And I stood entranced on the shore and marvelled what next would befall. And thus all-expectant abiding I waited not long, for soon A boat came gliding and gliding out in the light of the moon, Gliding with muffled oars, slowly, a thin dark line, Round from the shadowing shores into the silver shine Of the clear moon westering now, and still drew on and on, While the water before its prow breaking and glistering shone, Slowly in silence strange; and the rower rowed till it lay Afloat within easy range deep in the curve of the bay: And besides the rower were two; a Woman, who sat in the stern, And Her by her fame I knew, one of those fames that burn, Startling and kindling the world, one whose likeness we everywhere see; And a man reclining half-curled with an indolent grace at her knee, The Signor, lord of her choice; and he lightly touched a guitar;— A guitar for that glorious voice! Illumine the sun with a star! She sat superb and erect, stately, all-happy, serene, Her right hand toying unchecked with the hair of that page of a Queen; With her head and her throat and her bust like the bust and the throat and the head Of Her who has long been dust, of her who shall never be dead, Preserved by the potent art made trebly potent by love, While the transient ages depart from under the heavens above,— Preserved in the colour and line on the canvas fulgently flung By Him the Artist divine who triumphed and vanished so young: Surely there rarely hath been a lot more to be envied in life Than thy lot, O Fornarina, whom Raphael's heart took to wife. There was silence yet for a time save the tinkling capricious and quaint, Then She lifted her voice sublime, no longer tender and faint, Pathetic and tremulous, no! but firm as a column it rose, Rising solemn and slow with a full rich swell to the close, Firm as a marble column soaring with noble pride In a triumph of rapture solemn to some Hero deified; In a rapture of exultation made calm by its stress intense, In a triumph of consecration and a jubilation immense. And the Voice flowed on and on, and ever it swelled as it poured, Till the stars that throbbed as they shone seemed throbbing with it in accord; Till the moon herself in my dream, still Empress of all the night, Was only that voice supreme translated into pure light: And I lost all sense of the earth though I still had sense of the sea; And I saw the stupendous girth of a tree like the Norse World-Tree; And its branches filled all the sky, and the deep sea watered its root, And the clouds were its leaves on high and the stars were its silver fruit; Yet the stars were the notes of the singing and the moon was the voice of the song, Through the vault of the firmament ringing and swelling resistlessly strong; And the whole vast night was a shell for that music of manifold might, And was strained by the stress of the swell of the music yet vaster than night. And I saw as a crystal fountain whose shaft was a column of light More high than the loftiest mountain ascend the abyss of the night; And its spray filled all the sky, and the clouds were the clouds of its spray, Which glittered in star-points on high and filled with pure silver the bay; And ever in rising and falling it sang as it rose and it fell, And the heavens with their pure azure walling all pulsed with the pulse of its swell, For the stars were the notes of the singing and the moon was the voice of the song Through the vault of the firmament ringing and swelling ineffably strong; And the whole vast night was a shell for that music of manifold might, And was strained by the stress of the swell of the music yet vaster than night: And the fountain in swelling and soaring and filling beneath and above, Grew flushed with red fire in outpouring, transmuting great power into love, Great power with a greater love flushing, immense and intense and supreme, As if all the World's heart-blood outgushing ensanguined the trance of my dream; And the waves of its blood seemed to dash on the shore of the sky to the cope With the stress of the fire of a passion and yearning of limitless scope, Vast fire of a passion and yearning, keen torture of rapture intense, A most unendurable burning consuming the soul with the sense:— “Love, love only, forever; love with its torture of bliss; All the world's glories can never equal two souls in one kiss: Love, and ever love wholly; love in all time and all space; Life is consummate then solely in the death of a burning embrace.” And at length when that Voice sank mute, and silence fell over all Save the tinkling thin of that lute, the deep heavens rushed down like a pall, The stars and the moon for a time with all their splendours of light, Were quenched with that Voice sublime, and great darkness filled the night . . . . When I felt again the scent of the night-flowers rich and sweet, As ere my senses went, and knew where I stood on my feet, And saw the yet-bright bay and the moon gone low in my dream, The boat had passed away with Her the Singer supreme; She was gone, the marvellous Singer whose wonderful world-wide fame Could never possibly bring her a tithe of her just acclaim. And I wandered all night in a trance of rapture and yearning and love, And saw the dim grey expanse flush far with the dawning above; And I passed that copse in the night, but the nightingales all were dumb From their passionate aching delight, and perhaps whoever should come On the morrow would find, I have read, under its bush or its tree Some poor little brown bird dead, dead of its melody, Slain by the agitation, by the stress and the strain of the strife, And the pang of the vain emulation in the music yet dearer than life. And I heard the skylarks singing high in the morning sun, All the sunrise heavens ringing as the sunset heavens had done: And ever I dreamed and pondered while over the fragrant soil, My happy footsteps wandered before I resumed my toil:— Truly, my darling, my Alice, truly the whole night long Have I filled to the brim love's chalice with the wine of music and song. I have passed and repassed your door from the singing until the dawn A dozen times and more, and ever the curtains drawn; And now that the morn is breaking out of the stillness deep, Sweet as my visions of waking be all your visions of sleep! Could you but wake, O my dearest, a moment, and give one glance, Just a furtive peep the merest, to learn the day's advance! For I must away up the dale and over the hill to my toil, And the night's rich dreams grow pale in the working day's turmoil; But to-night, O my darling, my Alice, till night it will not be long, We will fill to the brim love's chalice with the wine of music and song; And never the memory fails of what I have learnt in my dream From the song of the nightingales and the song of the Singer supreme:— “Love, love only, for ever; love with its torture and bliss; All the world's glories can never equal two souls in one kiss: Love, love ever and wholly; love in all time and all space; Love is consummate then solely in the death of a burning embrace.” February 1882. TO H. A. B. ON MY FORTY-SEVENTH BIRTHDAY. Wednesday, November 23, 1881. When one is forty years and seven, Is seven and forty sad years old, He looks not onward for his Heaven, The future is too blank and cold, Its pale flowers smell of graveyard mould; He looks back to his lifeful past; If age is silver, youth is gold:— Could youth but last, could youth but last! He turns back toward his youthful past A-throb with life and love and hope, Whose long-dead joys in memory last, Whose shining days had ample scope; He turns and lingers on the slope Whose dusk leads down to sightless death:— The sun once crowned that darkening cope, And song once thrilled this weary breath. Ah, he plods wearily to death, Adown the gloaming into night, But other lives breathe joyous breath In morning's boundless golden light; Their feet are swift, their eyes are bright, Their hearts beat rhythms of hope and love, Their being is a pure delight In earth below and heaven above. And you have hope and joy and love, And you have youth's abounding life, Whose crystal currents flow above The stones and sands of care and strife. May all your years with joys be rife, May you grow calmly to your prime, A maiden sweet, a cherished wife, A happy mother in due time. All good you wish me, past my prime, I wish with better hope to you, And richer blessings than old Time And Fate or Fortune found my due: For you are kind and good and true, And so when you are forty-seven May spouse and children in your view Make Home the happiest life-long Heaven. PROEM O antique fables! beautiful and bright And joyous with the joyous youth of yore; O antique fables! for a little light Of what which shineth in you evermore, To cleanse the dimness from our weary eyes, And bathe our old world with a new surprise Of golden dawn entrancing sea and shore. We stagger under the enormous weight Of all the heavy ages piled on us, With all their grievous wrongs inveterate, And all their disenchantments dolorous, And all the monstrous tasks they have bequeathed; And we are stifled with the airs they breathed; And read in theirs our dooms calamitous. Our world is all stript naked of their dreams; No deities in sky or sun or moon, No nymphs in woods and hills and seas and streams; Mere earth and water, air and fire, their boon; No God in all our universe we trace, No Heaven in the infinitude of space, No life beyond death—coming not too soon. Our souls are stript of their illusions sweet, Our hopes at best in some far future years For others, not ourselves; whose bleeding feet Wander this rocky waste where broken spears And bleaching bones lie scattered on the sand; Who know we shall not reach the Promised Land;— Perhaps a mirage glistening through our tears. And if there be this Promised Land indeed, Our children's children's children's heritage, Oh, what a prodigal waste of precious seed, Of myriad myriad lives from age to age, Of woes and agonies and blank despairs, Through countless cycles, that some fortunate heirs May enter, and conclude the pilgrimage! But if it prove a mirage after all! Our last illusion leaves us wholly bare, To bruise against Fate's adamantine wall, Consumed or frozen in the pitiless air; In all our world, beneath, around, above, One only refuge, solace, triumph,—Love, Sole star of light in infinite black despair. O antique fables! beautiful and bright, And joyous with the joyous youth of yore; O antique fables! for a little light Of that which shineth in you evermore, To cleanse the dimness from our weary eyes, And bathe our old world with a new surprise Of golden dawn entrancing sea and shore. January 1882. THE POET AND HIS MUSE I sighed unto my Muse, “O gentle Muse, Would you but come and kiss my aching brow, And thus a little life and joy infuse Into my brain and heart so weary now; Into my heart so sad with emptiness Even when unafflicted by the stress Of all our kind's poor life; Into my brain so feeble and so listless, Crushed down by burthens of dark thought resistless Of all our want and woe and unresulting strife. “Would you but come and kiss me on the brow, Would you but kiss me on the pallid lips That have so many years been songless now, And on the eyes involved in drear eclipse; That thus the barren brain long overwrought Might yield again some blossoms of glad thought, And the long-mute lips sing, And the long-arid eyes grow moist and tender With some new vision of the ancient splendour Of beauty and delight that lives in everything. “Would you but kiss me on the silent lips And teach them thus to sing some new sweet song; Would you but kiss my eyes from their eclipse With some new tale of old-world right and wrong: Some song of love and joy or tender grief Whose sweetness is its own divine relief, Whose joy is golden bliss; Some solemn and impassioned antique story Where love against dark doom burns out in glory, Where life is freely staked to win one mutual kiss. “Would you but sing to me some new dear song Of love in bliss or bale alike supreme; Some story of our old-world right and wrong With noble passion burning through the theme: What though the story be of darkest doom, If loyal spirits shining through its gloom Throb to us from afar? What though the song with heavy sorrows languish, If loving hearts pulse to us through its anguish? Is not the whole black night enriched by one pure star?” And lo! She came, the ever-gentle Muse, Sad as my heart, and languid as my brain; Too gentle in her loving to refuse, Although her steps were weariness and pain; Although her eyes were blank and lustreless, Although her form was clothed with heaviness And drooped beneath the weight; Although her lips were blanched from all their blooming, Her pure face pallid as from long entombing, Her bright regard and smile sombre and desolate.— “Sad as thy heart and languid as thy brain I come unto thy sighing through the gloom, I come with mortal weariness and pain, I come as one compelled to leave her tomb: Behold, am I not wrapt as in the cloud Of death's investiture and sombre shroud? Am I not wan as death? Look at the withered leafage of my garland, Is it not nightshade from the sad dim far land Of night and old oblivion and no mortal breath? “I come unto thy sighing through the gloom, My hair dishevelled dank with dews of night, Reluctantly constrained to leave my tomb; With eyes that have for ever lost their light; My vesture mouldering with deep death's disgrace, My heart as chill and bloodless as my face, My forehead like a stone; My spirit sightless as my eyes are sightless, My inmost being nerveless, soulless, lightless, My joyous singing voice a harsh sepulchral moan. “My hair dishevelled dank with dews of night, From that far region of dim death I come, With eyes and soul and spirit void of light, With lips more sad in speech than stark and dumb: Lo, you have ravaged me with dolorous thought Until my brain was wholly overwrought, Barren of flowers and fruit; Until my heart was bloodless for all passion, Until my trembling lips could no more fashion Sweet words to fit sweet airs of trembling lyre and lute. “From the sad regions of dim death I come; We tell no tales there for our tale is told, We sing no songs there for our lips are dumb, Likewise our hearts and brains are graveyard mould; No wreaths of laurel, myrtle, ivy or vine, About our pale and pulseless brows entwine, And that sad frustrate realm Nor amaranths nor asphodels can nourish, But aconite and black-red poppies flourish On such Lethean dews as fair life overwhelm. “We tell no tales more, we whose tale is told; As your brain withered and your heart grew chill My heart and brain were turned to churchyard mould, Wherefore my singing voice sank ever still; And I, all heart and brain and voice, am dead; It is my Phantom here beside your bed That speaketh to you now; Though you exist still, a mere form inurning The ashes of dead fires of thought and yearning, Dead faith, dead love, dead hope, in hollow breast and brow.” When It had moaned these words of hopeless doom, The Phantom of the Muse once young and fair, Pallid and dim from its disastrous tomb, Of Her so sweet and young and débonnaire, So rich of heart and brain and singing voice, So quick to shed sweet tears and to rejoice And smile with ravishing grace; My soul was stupefied by its own reaping, Then burst into a flood of passionate weeping, Tears bitter as black blood streaming adown my face. “O Muse, so young and sweet and glad and fair, O Muse of hope and faith and joy and love, O Muse so gracious and so débonnaire, Darling of earth beneath and heaven above; If Thou art gone into oblivious death, Why should I still prolong my painful breath? Why still exist, the urn Holding of once-great fires the long dead ashes, No sole spark left of all their glow and flashes, Fires never to rekindle more and shine and burn? “O Muse of hope and faith and joy and love, Soul of my soul, if Thou in truth art dead, A mournful alien in our world above, A Phantom moaning by my midnight bed; How can I be alive, a hollow form With ashes of dead fires once bright and warm? What thing is worth my strife? The Past a great regret, the Present sterile, The Future hopeless, with the further peril Of withering down and down to utter death-in-life. “Soul of my soul, canst Thou indeed be dead? What mean for me if I accept their lore; Thy words, O Phantom moaning by my bed, ‘I cannot sing again for evermore’? I nevermore can think or feel or dream Or hope or love—the fatal loss supreme! I am a soulless clod; No germ of life within me that surpasses The little germs of weeds and flowers and grasses Wherewith our liberal Mother decks the graveyard sod. “I am half-torpid yet I spurn this lore, I am long silent yet cannot avow My singing voice is lost for evermore; For lo, this beating heart, this burning brow, This spirit gasping in keen spasms of dread And fierce revulsion that it is not dead, This agony of the sting: What soulless clod could have these tears and sobbings, These terrors that are hopes, these passionate throbbings? Dear Muse, revive! we yet may dream and love and sing!” February 1882. THE SLEEPER Reprinted by permission from the Cornhill Magazine. The fire is in a steadfast glow, The curtains drawn against the night; Upon the red couch soft and low Between the fire and lamp alight She rests half-sitting, half-reclining, Encompassed by the cosy shining, Her ruby dress with lace trimmed white. Her left hand shades her drooping eyes Against the fervour of the fire, The right upon her cincture lies In languid grace beyond desire, A lily fallen among roses; So placidly her form reposes, It scarcely seemeth to respire. She is not surely all awake, As yet she is not all asleep; The eyes with lids half-open take A startled deprecating peep Of quivering drowsiness, then slowly The lids sink back, before she wholly Resigns herself to slumber deep. The side-neck gleams so pure beneath The underfringe of gossamer, The tendrils of whose faery wreath The softest sigh suppressed would stir. The little pink-shell ear-rim flushes With her young blood's translucent blushes, Nestling in tresses warm as fur. The contour of her cheek and chin Is curved in one delicious line, Pure as a vase of porcelain thin Through which a tender light may shine; Her brow and blue-veined temple gleaming Beneath the dusk of hair back-streaming Are as a virgin's marble shrine. The ear is burning crimson fire, The flush is brightening on the face, The lips are parting to suspire, The hair grows restless in its place As if itself new tangles wreathing; The bosom with her deeper breathing Swells and subsides with ravishing grace. The hand slides softly to caress, Unconscious, that fine-pencilled curve “Her lip's contour and downiness,” Unbending with a sweet reserve; A tender darkness that abashes Steals out beneath the long dark lashes, Whose sightless eyes make eyesight swerve. The hand on chin and throat downslips, Then softly, softly on her breast; A dream comes fluttering o'er the lips, And stirs the eyelids in their rest, And makes their undershadows quiver, And like a ripple on a river Glides through her breathing manifest. I feel an awe to read this dream So clearly written in her smile; A pleasant not a passionate theme, A little love, a little guile; I fear lest she should speak revealing The secret of some maiden feeling I have no right to hear the while. The dream has passed without a word Of all that hovered finely traced; The hand has slipt down, gently stirred To join the other at her waist; Her breath from that light agitation Has settled to its slow pulsation; She is by deep sleep re-embraced. Deep sleep, so holy in its calm, So helpless, yet so awful too; Whose silence sheds as sweet a balm As ever sweetest voice could do; Whose trancèd eyes, unseen, unseeing Shadowed by pure love, thrill our being With tender yearnings through and through. Sweet sleep; no hope, no fear, no strife; The solemn sanctity of death, With all the loveliest bloom of life; Eternal peace in mortal breath: Pure sleep from which she will awaken Refreshed as one who hath partaken New strength, new hope, new love, new faith. January 1882. MODERN PENELOPE (RIDDLE SOLVED.) What did she mean by that crochet work? The work that never got done, Lolling as indolent as a Turk, Looking demure as a Nun: What subtle mystery might lurk (Of course there must be one) In that Penelope web of work, The work that never got done? She lolled on the low couch just under the light So very serene and staid: We had some other guests that night, One sang, another played, A couple discovered the stars were bright, Of course a youth and a maid, I watched her knitting under the light So very serene and staid. I knew that she was a rogue in her heart, As roguish as ever could be, And she knew that I knew, yet would not dart A single glance at me, But seemed as it were withdrawn apart Amid the companie, A nun in her face with a rogue in her heart As roguish as ever could be. I like a riddle when its knot Involves a pretty girl, I puzzle about, now cold, now hot, Through every loop and twirl, For the question is “Who” as well as “What”? And the answer is thus a pearl, And really you cannot study the knot, Unless you study the girl. With a graceful lazy kittypuss air She fingered the net and the ball: At first she started to work on the square, And then she undid all: To make it round was next her care, But the progress was strangely small, With a graceful lazy kittypuss air Trifling with net and ball. About her lips a quiet smile Came hovering, then took rest: A butterfly in the selfsame style Will choose some sweet flower's breast: Her eyes were drooping all the while, But the drooping lids expressed The satisfaction of a smile Like a butterfly at rest. Her hands kept floating to and fro Like a pair of soft white doves, In gentle dalliance coy and slow Around a nest of Loves: And against my chair her couch was low, And six was the size of her gloves, They were charming those hands there to and fro Like a pair of soft white doves. Her fair face opened like a flower, And a sigh thrilled the smile on her lips, And her eyes shone out with a dazzling power From the dream of their half-eclipse As she welcomed the trill of “A summer shower” With plausive finger-tips— Oh! her eyes so bright, and her face like a flower, And the exquisite smile of her lips! Those hands kept floating soft and white Our hearts to mesmerise, Those dark eyes keep half-veiled their light To lure and lure our eyes; That web is but a subtle sleight To mesh us by surprise: Do I not read your riddle right, Penelope the wise? O you nun in face with the rogue in your heart As roguish as ever can be, You have played an immensely wiser part Than the old Penelope: You have caught twin loves in the toils of your art, And neither will ever get free: You have won the game of a heart for a heart, And when shall the settling be? 1882. AT BELVOIR Sunday, July 3, 1881. A BALLAD, HISTORICAL AND PROPHETIC. (“In maiden meditation, fancy free.”) My thoughts go back to last July, Sweet happy thoughts and tender;— “The bridal of the earth and sky,” A day of noble splendour; A day to make the saddest heart In joy a true believer; When two good friends we roamed apart The shady walks of Belvoir. A maiden like a budding rose, Unconscious of the golden And fragrant bliss of love that glows Deep in her heart infolden; A Poet old in years and thought, Yet not too old for pleasance, Made young again and fancy-fraught By such a sweet friend's presence. The other two beyond our ken Most shamefully deserted, And far from all the ways of men Their stealthy steps averted: Of course our Jack would go astray, Erotic and erratic; But Mary!—well, I own the day Was really too ecstatic. We roamed with many a merry jest And many a ringing laughter; The slow calm hours too rich in zest To heed before and after: Yet lingering down the lovely walks Soft strains anon came stealing, A finer music through our talks Of sweeter, deeper feeling: Yes, now and then a quiet word Of seriousness dissembling In smiles would touch some hidden chord And set it all a-trembling: I trembled too, and felt it strange;— Could I be in possession Of music richer in its range Than yet had found expression? The cattle standing in the mere, The swans upon it gliding, The sunlight on the waters clear, The radiant clouds dividing; The solemn sapphire sky above, The foliage lightly waving, The soft air's Sabbath peace and love To satisfy all craving. We mapped the whole fair region out As Country of the Tender, From first pursuit in fear and doubt To final glad surrender: Each knoll and arbour got its name, Each vista, covert, dingle;— No young pair now may track the same And long continue single! And in the spot most thrilling-sweet Of all this Love-Realm rosy Our truant pair had found retreat, Unblushing, calm and cosy: Where seats too wide for one are placed, And yet for two but narrow, It's “Let my arm steal round your waist, And be my winsome marrow!” Reclining on a pleasant lea Such tender scenes rehearsing, A freakish fit seized him and me For wildly foolish versing: We versed of this, we versed of that, A pair of mocking sinners, While our lost couple strayed or sat Oblivious of their dinners. But what was strange, our maddest rhymes In all their divagations Were charged and over-charged at times With deep vaticinations: I yearn with wonder at the power Of Poetry prophetic Which in my soul made that blithe hour With this hour sympathetic. For though we are in winter now, My heart is in full summer: Old Year, old Wish, have made their bow; I welcome each new-comer. “The King is dead, long live the King! The throne is vacant never!” Is true, I read, of everything, So of my heart for ever! My thoughts go on to next July, More happy thoughts, more tender; “The bridal of the earth and sky,” A day of perfect splendour; A day to make the saddest heart In bliss a firm believer; When two True Loves may roam apart The shadiest walks of Belvoir. There may be less of merry jest And less of ringing laughter, Yet life be much more rich in zest And richer still thereafter; The love-scenes of that region fair Have very real rehearsing, And tremulous kisses thrill the air Far sweetlier than sweet versing; The bud full blown at length reveal Its deepest golden burning; The heart inspired with love unseal Its inmost passionate yearning: The music of the hidden chord At length find full expression; The Seraph of the Flaming Sword Assume divine possession. January 1882. A STRANGER I. It is not surely, this, a little thing, That day and night and every Sabbath day Throughout these months of winterless glad Spring, March mild as April, April sweet as May, And May as rich as June in common years, It has been given me upon my way, Given to me and all my village peers, But most to me as my full heart knows well, Brimming my eyes with tender wistful tears And throbbing with strange awe ineffable, To meet and pass, to follow with slow pace, Or on the street or in our quiet dell Or through the fields, that Lady of all grace With sweet sad eyes and noble mournful face. II. We know not who she is or whence she came, She and her little boy with her own eyes And brow and patient smile, whose Christian name Without the surname tells us where he lies With her heart buried in the self-same grave: The larks were singing in the soft blue skies, And even some few violets were brave To breathe faint sweetness on the bland warm air, Good Valentine such benediction gave, When she arrived with him, her anxious care, Her only joy, her terrible dark grief: In early April he was lying there; The Spring all blithe with bud and flower and leaf And scent and song above his Spring so brief. III. Only the Christian name upon the stone Above the date of birth and date of death; Two syllables of everlasting moan, Immortal sorrow breathing mortal breath, Continual weeping that would fain not weep, Sad comforting that vainly comforteth The deadly anguish graven far more deep Upon the heart than on the marble cold, “For so He giveth His belovèd sleep.” Yet with a lofty patience she controlled The outward signs of anguish; eve and morn Tending that little bed of sacred mould And others near it that were left forlorn; Praying, I think, to sleep herself outworn. IV. Her sorrow flowed with blessings from above; Her heart of joy and hope was in that tomb, But not her heart of sympathy and love: While her young flower was fading from its bloom She had been wonderfully sweet and kind; And now that it was buried in the gloom Her own sore suffering did but closelier bind Her heart to other hearts in all distress; The little angel in her sad soul shrined Was a true angel of pure gentleness And soft compassion and unwearying will To soothe and aid and with all solace bless: Our joys and sorrows take our nature still; Hers wrought bright good from her own darkest ill. V. Tenderness, worship, bliss in yearning pain!— To see her young and fair and more than fair, Amidst us yet not of us, sole remain As sanctified already unaware; To see the peacefulness of pure white brow Beneath the smoothness of the rich brown hair; The cloistral solitude without the vow; The self-renunciation mild and meek With meekness that is ever glad to bow, Evading honours such as others seek, Yet in its stooping cannot help but rise; To hear that soft slow voice its good words speak; To feel the fascination of those eyes, Solemn and dark and deep as midnight skies. VI. I did not wonder she could be so pure Amidst our petty cares and sordid strife, But how our common meanness could endure Beneath the lofty radiance of her life; Until I saw how, fine and soft and clear As starbeams quivering through the darkness rise, Her effluence shone on souls all dull and drear: Then as the Moon in moving through the Night Bears round her ever her own hemisphere Of tranquil beauty and entrancing light By solemn shadows more mysterious made, Her regnant beauty turned all darkness bright Or glorified mysteriously its shade; Fair Queen most queenly as in Night arrayed. VII. Oh, joyless joy of this most bounteous June, For with the Maytide She is gone, is gone! All men adore and love the one sole Moon; But she of all on whom her light has shone, Of all her pure and gracious light has blest, Discerns no mortal save Endymion, To him alone unveils her virgin breast, On him alone outpours her love divine. What shall we do who undistinguished rest? Shall we against her solemn choice repine? Or shall we rather lift our souls above To hold her ever in a crystal shrine, The perfect beauty of Heaven's brooding Dove, The sacred vision of Heaven's reachless Love? March 1882. LAW v. GOSPEL This and the two pieces following are reprinted from the Weekly Dispatch. “Despotism Tempered by Dynamite” was the last poem written by the author. The Gospel and the Law of late Have been at sad dissension Before the Judge and Magistrate: Old Satan's last invention. Of course the Law upholds the Law, The Gospel over-ruling; And those who have St. Paul in awe Must seek more modern schooling. The Gospel says, Swear not at all; The Law, or good or bad law, Says, You must swear, whate'er befall, Or else I fine you, Bradlaugh. Whereon he goes and swears himself In solemn legal banter; His fellow-members on the shelf Deposit him instanter. And then we have that narrow sect Of most Peculiar People, Who by the Book their way direct, And not by the Church steeple. They read how Asa sought not God, But doctors, being sickly; And therefore slept beneath the sod With his forefathers quickly. St. James enjoins, When one is ill, Send for an elder straightway; Anoint and pray (no doctor's bill!) And thus elude Death's gateway. So said so done; and then report Of death of son or daughter, And parents sentenced by the Court To prison for manslaughter. And now a new and noisy set— The Army of Salvation— Our equal-minded justice fret With constant botheration: For sometimes they obstruct the way, And sometimes cause a riot; Too much of zeal—too much, we say, Why can't the fools keep quiet? The dean and canons in their stalls Are placid as stalled cattle, And never rush out from St. Paul's To give the devil battle. In streets and lanes to brawl and fight Is far too low and rowdy; No, if he wants a spar, invite Him home to Mrs. Proudie. On Tuesday, March, the fourteenth day, Before Sir Thomas Owden, A youth was brought who blocked the way, Already over-crowden— Threadneedle-street—the wild War Cry, This well-dressed youth was selling: A camel and a needle's eye— The rest requires no telling. Sir Thomas said he understood How men in shabby raiment, To get a living, bad or good, Should do this thing for payment; But he could never understand How any young man, dressed all In decent clothes, could join the band, Like this young Henry Restall. “It's not to get a living, sir,” This youth spoke fast and faster; “I have been called to minister— I work for God, my Master.” Sir Thomas answered (much I grieve If you don't find it bon sens), He never could be made believe In such outrageous nonsense. This hardened youth he made reply, “We have reformed some thousand Poor drunkards;” Sir T. winked full sly, And sneezing sneered, “Der Tausend!” And for a fortnight did remand, Upon his good behaviour, That youth, who now should understand He mustn't cry his Saviour. Just think of Simon Peter thus, And all the zealous dozen, Brought up before Asinius, Our Owden's great fore-cousin. He would have quickly stopped their prate On a police-court summons; We should have no Archbishop Tait, No pious House of Commons! 'Tis true they were but fishermen And suchlike, poor and humble; And thus might earn a living then Approved by every Bumble. But preach a Gospel not for pelf! Absurd to Owden thinkers!— Just keep your Good News to yourself, And cease reforming drinkers! March 1882. THE OLD STORY AND THE NEW STOREY (House of Commons, Thursday, March 23.) “For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.” —Matthew xiii. 12. The Old Story says: We've another Young prince who will wed like a man; Let us give him, because of his mother, An extra ten thousand per ann. She has barely enough for herself, sirs; Not five hundred a week is his sum; Some of you have vastly more pelf, sirs; Let our vote be unanimous, come! The New Storey Mr. Storey, M.P. for Sunderland. says—(It is mentioned How, hating such meanness to hear, The noble array of the pensioned Assailed him with laughter and jeer)— He says: Public money should solely For good public service be spent. (Dear lords, what a doctrine unholy! Why it saps at your rights to your rent!) He says: What I urge 'gainst a wasteful And unjust proposal like this Must to many of you be distasteful, And the wherefore too palpable is; Since one hundred and ten of your body, And one hundred and twenty-six peers, For no service, or service of shoddy, Keep bleeding us numberless years. He says: This ten thousand per annum You would lavish on one wealthy pair— Many hundred a grandad and grannam Would keep in a comfort too rare; Or in Sunderland—that's my own borough— A small place—laugh on!—would secure Education quite free and quite thorough Without any rate on the poor. He says: These same princes as dummies In army and navy fill posts, While veterans, scorched up like mummies, Must starve in the cold like their ghosts. He says: Sweep away lordly flunkeys, If you really this money must clutch, Those bedizened and posturing monkeys— Your Gold Sticks in Waiting and such. He says—But fine ears we won't batter With more of his speech unpolite; So we'll give our own view of the matter, And our view of course is the right. We say: When your State-ship you're building, If you will have a gilt figure-head, Of course you must pay for the gilding; We say—there's no more to be said. It is true that the head a ship carries In proportion costs little when built; It is true that this head never marries And breeds little heads to be gilt. It is true—but sane words are a treasure Too precious for subjects like these— Having set up such heads at your pleasure, You can set them aside when you please. April 1882. DESPOTISM TEMPERED BY DYNAMITE There is no other title in the world So proud as mine, who am no law-cramped king, No mere imperial monarch absolute, The White Tsar worshipped as a visible God, As Lord of Heaven no less than Lord of Earth— I look with terror to my crowning day. Through half of Europe my dominions spread, And then through half of Asia to the shores Of Earth's great ocean washing the New World; And nothing bounds them to the Northern Pole, They merge into the everlasting ice— I look with terror to my crowning day. Full eighty million subjects worship me— Their father, high priest, monarch, God on earth; My children who but hold their lives with mine For our most Holy Russia dear and great, Whose might is concentrated in my hands— I look with terror to my crowning day. I chain and gag with chains and gags of iron The impious hands and mouths that dare express A word against my sacred sovranty; The half of Asia is my prison-house, Myriads of convicts lost in its Immense— I look with terror to my crowning day. I cannot chain and gag the evil thoughts Of men and women poisoned by the West, Frenzied in soul by the anarchic West; These thoughts transmute themselves to dynamite; My sire was borne all shattered to his tomb— I look with terror to my crowning day. My peasants rise to their unvarying toil, And go to sleep outwearied by their toil, Without the hope of any better life. But with no hope they have no deadly fear, They sleep and eat their scanty food in peace— I look with terror to my crowning day. My palaces are prisons to myself; I taste no food that may not poison me; I plant no footstep sure it will not stir Instant destruction of explosive fire; I look with terror to each day and night— With tenfold terror to my crowning day. May 1882. ADDRESS ON THE OPENING OF THE NEW HALL OF THE LEICESTER SECULAR SOCIETY, March 6, 1881. “So Man created god in His own image, in the image of Man created He him; male and female created He them.” —The New Book of Genesis. Lo, all the lands wherein our wandering race Have led their flocks, or fixed their dwelling-place To till with patient toil the fruitful sod, Abound with altars To the Unknown God Or Gods, whom Man created from of old, In His own image, one yet manifold, And ignorantly worshipped. We now dare, Taught by millenniums of barren prayer, Of mutual scorn and hate and bloody strife With which these dreams have poisoned our poor life, To build our temples on another plan, Devoting them to god's Creator, Man; Not to Man's creature, god. And thus, indeed, All men and women, of whatever creed, We welcome gladly if they love their kind; No other valid test of worth we find. We gaze into the living world and mark Infinite mysteries for ever dark: And if there is a god beyond our thought (How could he be within its compass brought?); He will not blame the eyes he made so dim That they cannot discern a trace of him; He must approve the pure sincerity Which, seeing not, declares it cannot see; He cannot love the blasphemous pretence Of puny mannikins with purblind sense To see him thoroughly, to know him well, His secret purposes, His Heaven and hell, His inmost nature—formulating this With calmest chemical analysis, Or vivisecting it, as if it were Some compound gas, or dog with brain laid bare. And if we have a life beyond our death, A life of nobler aims and ampler breath, What better preparation for such bliss Than honest work to make the best of this? He who is faithful in a few things found Becomes the lord of many; he whose pound Is well employed may look for many more; Waste adds to waste as store increaseth store. Who cannot run a mile will win no place Among the champions for a ten-mile race; Who cannot order well a little farm Shall have no great estate to bring to harm; Who squanders months and years can never be Entrusted with an immortality; Who loveth not the brother at his side, How can he love a dim dream deified? We know our lives at best are full of care, But we may learn to bear and to forbear, By sympathy and human fellowship,— Sweet cup of solace to the parching lip, Doubling all joy, diminishing all grief, Soothing despair itself with some relief. Each life is as a little plot of ground, Whose owner should not blankly wall it round To shut it in from others, shutting out Himself from those that neighbour it about: The plots must differ both in size and soil, The poorest will reward kind care and toil With fruits of sustenance and flowers of grace; All good, though varying in every case. Down with our dead walls!—let us all enjoy Our neighbours' industry without alloy; The bloom and odours of their fruits and flowers Which are so like and yet so unlike ours; The singing of the birds among their trees, Their glancing butterflies and honey-bees: And sharing thus the pleasures of the whole, Tend that which is within our own control More cheerfully, more earnestly, lest weeds Disgracing ours, taint theirs with wafted seeds; And let us cherish kindly interchange Of help and produce in our social range. This is the spirit in which we have wrought To build our little Temple of Free Thought And mere Humanity—to us Divine Above the deity of any shrine: This modest Hall for Club and Institute Which we now open; may it bear good fruit! No rigid barriers of sex or sect Or party in these walls do we erect: Inclusion not exclusion is our aim: Whatever freedom for ourselves we claim, We wish all others to enjoy the same, In simple womanhood's and manhood's name! Freedom within one law of sacred might, Trench not on any other's equal right. Our creed is simple, All men are one man! Our sole commandment, Do what good you can. We gladly welcome truth where'er it shines, The gold and silver of the ancient mines, Dug out and smelted by good men of yore, And mines but newly opened, still in ore; Submitting old and modern to the test, Most surely fallible but yet our best, Of self-experience, knowledge, reason; then Inviting the assays of other men. Buddha and Jesus, Zeno, Socrates, Mohammed, Paine, Voltaire,—alike from these The precious metals we accept with joy; But pray, friends, spare us from the proved alloy! Having no rich endowments from the State, Our means are small as our good-will is great:— A platform for Free Thought in courteous speech, And free discussion of the views of each; Some books, our true “Communion of the Saints,” To feed the mind and cheer the heart that faints; Some classes for instruction and delight; A club wherein our members may unite For cordial converse and such innocent pleasure As makes a blessing, not a curse, of leisure! Some social gatherings, where we trust to see Not the Man only but the Family, Where poetry and music, dance and song, Shall make the sweet hours blithely dance along. Thus all our youths and maidens, girls and boys, Must link this place with all their purest joys, And growing in their turn husbands and wives, Fathers and mothers, may devote their lives, Not as an irksome task, but gracious duty, Full-fraught with light and sweetness, love and beauty, To cherish, cultivate, and propagate, Or here or elsewhere as shall be their fate, When we ourselves are dead save in our deeds, This nursling from the ever-precious seeds Which we have in our time inherited From the brave culture of our noble Dead; Our small addition to their great work done, The present work in our loved town begun This Sunday, March sixth, Eighteen eighty-one. EARLY POEMS THE DOOM OF A CITY A FANTASIA. Part I. THE VOYAGE. I. From out the house I crept, The house which long had caged my homeless life: The mighty City in vast silence slept, Dreaming away its tumult, toil, and strife: But sleep and sleep's rich dreams were not for me, For me, accurst, whom terror and the pain Of baffled longings, and starved misery, And such remorse as sears the breast, And hopeless doubt which gnaws the brain Till wildest action blind and vain Would be more welcome than supine unrest, Drove forth as one possest To leave my kind and dare the desert sea; To drift alone and far, Dubious of any port or isle to gain, Ignorant of chart and star, Upon that infinite and mysterious main Which wastes in foam against our shore; Whose moans and murmurs evermore, Insupportably sublime, Haunting the crowded tumult of our Time, Suspend its hurrying breath— Like whispers of sad ghosts and spirits free From world's beyond our life and death, The unknown awful realm where broods Eternity. II. I paced through desert streets, beneath the gleam Of lamps that lit my trembling life alone; Like lamps sepulchral which had slowly burned Through sunless ages, deep and undiscerned, Within a buried City's maze of stone; Whose peopling corpses, while they ever dream Of birth and death—of complicated life Whose days and months and years Are wild with laughters, groans, and tears, As with themselves and Doom They wage, with loss or gain, incessant strife, Indeed, lie motionless within their tomb, Lie motionless and never laugh or weep, All still, and buried deep For ever in death's sleep, While burn the quiet lamps amidst the breathless gloom. III. My boat lay waiting there, Upon the moonless river Whose pulse had ceased to quiver In that unnatural hush of brooding night. I thought, Free breezes course the billowy deep! And rowed on panting through the feverous air, Leaving the great main waters on my right For that canal which creeps into the sea Across the livid marshes wild and bare. So, slowly faded back from sight, As doth a dream insensibly Fade backward on the ebbing tide of sleep, That city which had home nor hope for me, That stifling tomb from which I now was free. IV. Like some weak life whose sluggish moments creep Diffused on worthless objects, yet whose tide With dull reluctance hard to understand Refrains its death-in-life from death's full sleep, The river's shallow waters oozed out wide, Inclosing dreary flats of barren sand; So merged at last into the lethal waste That bounds of sea and stream could not be traced. V. Long languidly I rowed, With sick and weary pain, Between the deepest channel's bitter weeds Whose rankness salt slime feeds; And so out blindly thro' the dismal main, Now shaken with a long hoarse growling swell. And soon the Tempest—as a king who had slept The sleep of worn-out frenzy, while his slaves Cowered still in stupor till he woke again Refreshed for carnage—from his torpor leapt Breathed swarthy pallor through the dense low sky, And hurrying swift and fell Outspeeded his own thunder-bearing glooms; Then prone and instantaneous from on high Plunged down in one tremendous blast, Which crashed into white dust the heaving waves And left the ocean level when it past. . . . There was a moment's respite; silence reigned,— Such shuddering silence as may once appal The universe of tombs, Ere the last trumpet's clangour rend them all: And I sank down, one frail and helpless man Alone with desolation on the sea, To pray while any sense of prayer remained Amidst the horrors overwhelming me. VI. How shall I tell that tempest's thunder-story?— The soldier plunged into the Battle-stress, Struggling and gasping in the mighty flood, Stunned with the roar of cannon, blind with smoke, 'Midst yells and tramplings drunk and mad with blood, What knows he of the Battle's spheric glory? Of heavenly laws that all its evil bless— Of sacred rights of justice which invoke Its sternest pleading—of the tranquil eye Triumphant o'er its chaos—of the Mind Commanding all, serene and unsubdued, Which having first with wisest care designed Works to the end with vigilant fortitude; And from that field so drenched with angry blood Shall reap the golden harvest, Victory? VII. There was a stupor stung with pain and fear, Amidst the strangling surf flung on and on; There was bewilderment above all dread, Delirious calm and desperate joy austere Of revelling through the tempest lorn and lone. My boat and I with dizzy swiftness sped, In strange salvation from the certain doom, Along the urgent ridges over-reeling And gathering up their ruins as they fled; And down into the depths of scooped-out gloom Whose crystal walls glowed black in the revealing Of lightning-kindled foam; and up again, Perched on the giddy balance of two waves Which fiercely countering mingle with the shock, And rush aloft confused, and tower and rock Foaming with wild convulsion, till amain The mass heaves down from struggling, self-destroyed, And leaves us shuddering in a gulfy void. Confused and intermingled, fire, sea, air, Wrought out their ravage; for the thunders there Were echoing in the dreadly stormless caves And shook the deep foundations of the seas; The air was like an ocean, drenched with spray Whose meteor-flakes outflashed tumultuously Against the sinking heaven's black incline, When sudden lightnings seemed to burst their way Up through the deep to flood and fire its brine, Ingulfing for each moment all the Night— The blackness and the howling rage—in light More lurid and appalling, a World-pyre. . . . But heart and brain were overwrought; and soon, All vision reeling from my powerless eyes, I lay in quiet mercy-granted swoon As senseless as the boat in which I lay: And we two things through all the agonies Of night, tornado, sea, and fire, Were drifted passive on our fearful way. VIII. I know not for what time I lay in trance, Nor in what course the tempest hurled us on. At length to scarce-believed deliverance I woke; and saw a sweet slow silent dawn Upgrowing from the far dim grey abyss,— So slow, it seemed like some celestial flower Unfolding perfect petals to its prime, And feeling in its secret soul of bliss Each leaf a loveliness for many an hour, With amaranthine queenship over time. It grew: its purple splendours flecked and starred With golden fire spread floating up the steep Until they sole possessed the mighty sweep Of crystal lucent æther: its regard, The blessing of a light of peace and love, Charmed with a gradual spell the sullen mood Of the sea-giant, until all-subdued No more his huge bulk livid shook and hove The meteor-threatenings of his tawny mane, No more growled lingering wrath and turbulent pain; But calm and glad th'unmonstered monster lay Beneath the royal sun's perfected sway. IX. And there was Land. Where seemed a bank of clouds Piled in the South, now nobly, one by one, The pinnacles of lofty mountain-peaks Flamed keen as stars, enkindled by the sun; Emerging as with life from out their shrouds Of silvern haze far-cleft with roseate streaks: And far beneath them, down along the shore, A wave of low round hills gleamed pure and pale. But soon—like any human life, The golden promise of whose dawn doth fail Into the same drear noon of barren strife Of which our hearts were weary-sick of yore— The day grew chill and dark; And through its sullen hours the wintry gale Beat restlessly my bark, Beside that coast-line drifting to and fro Upon the ocean's vapour-shrouded flow. X. I saw grey phantoms, fading as they fled, Glide hurrying in loose rank O'er livid backgrounds of the upper sky, Whose vast and thunderous threat'ning overfrowned Abysses strangely dread— Cold, glassy gulfs, each like an evil eye Of serpent-malice which is dead and blank To every sight but woe and agony. The fascination of their wan green glance Was fixed upon the hills which, at the foot Of that stern wall of mountain lifted proud Above the firmament of level cloud, Lay stretched out cold and mute, In leaden bulk, beneath the long expanse Of dark and desert sky, whose brooding gloom Was blanched with cruel pallor here and there— Pallor of wrath or dread, instinct with doom. There stretched they far, a dark and silent host, Like monsters stranded from their deep sea-lair Benumbed with terror cowering; Still unrecovered from the storm whose ire Had drowned them in wild floods of pitiless fire, Or prescient of some deadlier tempest lowering. XI. At intervals, opposing the sun's track, Circling about the North Shone strangely blazoned forth Wild rainbow-fragments on the sweeping rack, The gale's rent symbol on rent banners borne. For ever and anon the sun gazed down From dizzy summits of the cloud-crags black; Or where the wind had torn Vast jaggèd rifts athwart their mass (Behind whose heavy frown Faint smiles of soothing like a robe of grass Had fallen from him on the frozen hills), He gazed out powerless o'er the rain-grey sea: No eye which sorrows fills With constant bitter tears, Drowning all life and lustre, joy and pride, Can gaze more faint and wan and hopelessly Into the homeless world, and waste of years Spread out between it and the grave's sweet sleeping; Can let the dark lid sink upon its weeping More often, fain to hide The chilling desolation blurred with strife Which, seen or unseen, maps its future life. XII. Ere sunset came a storm of rain Ploughing up the barren main With fierce and vital energy, While brief bright lightnings flashed incessantly. And then the South stood up, one solid wall Of battlemented cloud, in which the mountains And hills were fused together out of sight: The sinking sun from his intense fire-fountains Poured out against its heaven-absorbing might Seas of lurid purple light And fulvous meteors, surging and devouring The shattered crests, the crumbling slopes, The massive walls, the river copes, In fortitude of glowing bronze far-towering. XIII. From all the secret caverns of the air Night's gloomy phantoms issuing, gathered dense To blot and stifle out the pageant there; The murmur of their motions breathing wide Through that new silence thrilled upon the sense; When, gazing southward, I became aware Of some slow movement by the dim sea-side, As of a wind arousing from its lair To rend the settled vapours. I descried, After an interval of rapt suspense, By what faint gloaming yet was left of day, Two startling lamps uplifted slowly glide From out the thick and dun immensity, Fronting a long dark line like some array Of men that came in silent mystery, Across the undulations of the shore Long-winding coil on coil unbrokenly, To celebrate weird rites and sorceries hoar, Shrouded in gloom beside the moaning sea. XIV. I knew, but would not know, I knew too well, but knowledge was despair. It came on vast and slow, And dipt those baleful meteors in the brine; Whence soon it lifted them with hideous cries That flung strange horror through the shuddering air. Haling its length in many a monstrous twine, It bore on steadfastly those loathsome eyes, Set in the midst of intertangled hair Like sea-weed in whose jungle have their lair All foul and half-lived things: With such a gleam as haunts the rotting graves They fixed upon me their malignant stare; Shallow and slimy, fiendish, eyes of death. It neared me soon with fiendish wallowings Athwart the heaving and repugnant waves; Then paused a moment, and with one harsh roar Heaved up its whole obscene and ghastly bulk, To rankle in my memory evermore. With hissing shrieks and bursts of strangled breath, Torn by some agonising pang, it fell, And lay upon the sea a vast dead hulk; But raised yet once the huge and formless head Whence blood-dark foam was showering; and those eyes Glared blinking on me with the hate of Hell, Before it turned reluctantly and fled. Down, down, convicted by the holy skies, Away, away, O God! it hurtled forth; To cower in frozen caverns of the deep; To haunt—a nightmare in that ghastly sleep— The death and desolation of the North. XV. A man forlorn has wandered, cursed from rest, Through Time's dead waste, and savage howling seas, Bearing a fateful Horror in his breast, Formless and dim, but mighty to disease; Devouring, poisoning, stifling his pure life. And suddenly, when Hope can hope no more, He feels its coils unwinding from his heart, And rich vitality with glorious strife Surging through veins all shrunk and numb before: But also sees the Incubus depart, Coil after coil reluctant dragged away As were a serpent's from its strangled prey; And thus in his first health is clearly shown What still was hidden from his lunacy, The full obscene and deadly ghastliness Of that which held and ruled him to this day: Abhorrence almost chills him into stone, And that great blow which struck the prisoner free Hath nearly slain him by its mighty stress. Such was my agony of joy that hour, When saved for ever from the monster's power. XVI. The sky was spacious warm and bright, The clouds were pure as morning snow; In myriad points of living light The sea lay laughing to and fro. Above the hills a depth of sky, Dim-pale with heat and light intense, Was overhung by clouds piled high In mountain-ranges huge and dense; Whose rifts and ridges ran aloft Far to their crests of dazzling snow, Whence spread a vaporous lustre soft Veiling the noontide's azure glow. Through mists of purple glory seen Those dim and panting hill-waves lay, Absorbed into the heavens serene, Dissolving in the perfect day. But when the sun burned high and bare In his own realm of solemn blue, The clouds hung isolated there, Dark purple grandeurs vast and few; Like massive sculptures wrought at large Upon that dome's immensity, Like constant isles whose foamlit marge Rose high from out that sapphire sea. And all the day my boat sped on With rapid gliding smooth as rest, As if by mystic dreamings drawn To some fair haven in the West; Flew onward swift without a gale As if it were a living thing, And spread with joy its snow-white sail As spreads a bird its snow-white wing; Flashed on along the lucid deep Dividing that most perfect sphere, A vault above it glowing steep, A vault beneath it no less clear; Within whose burning sapphire-round The clouds, the air, the land, the sea, Lay thrilled with quivering glory, drowned In calm as of Eternity. Part II. THE CITY. I. Anear the dying of that royal day Those amber-vested hills began to swerve; And soon a lofty Pharos, gleaming white Upon its isle set darkly in the light, Beckoned us onward to the spacious bay Encompassed broadly by their noble curve. And so at length we entered it; and faced The thin dark lines of countless masts, all traced Upon the saddest sunset ever seen— Spread out like an interminable waste Of red and saffron sand, devoured by slow Persistent fire; beneath whose desolate glow A City lay, thick-zoned with solemn green Of foliage massed upon the steeps around. Between those mast-lines flamed the crystal fires Of multitudinous windows; and on high Grand marble palaces and temples, crowned With golden domes and radiant towers and spires, Stood all entranced beneath that desert sky, Based on an awful stillness. Dead or dumb That mighty City through the breathless air Thrilled forth no pulse of sound, no faintest hum Of congregated life in street and square: Becalmed beyond all calm those galleons lay, As still and lifeless as their shadows there, Fixed in the magic mirror of the bay As in a rose-flushed crystal weirdly fair. A strange, sad dream: and like a fiery pall, Blazoned with death, that sky hung over all. II. Where, eastward from the town, the shore was low, I drew at length my shallop up the sand,— The quiet and gloomless twilight gathering slow; And took my way across the lonely strand, And onward to the City, lost in thought. Who shall his own wild life-course understand? From terror through great terrors I am brought To front my fate in this mysterious land. In my old common world, well fenced about With myriad lives that fellowed well my own, Terror and deadly anguish found me out And drove me forth to seek the dread Unknown; Through all whose terrors I have yet been brought, Though hopeless, helpless, utterly alone. May yet my long wild night be blessed with morn? Some revelation from the awful Throne Awaits me surely: if my life, torn free From dire Egyptian bondage, has been led In safety through the all-devouring sea; If, lost in foodless deserts, it was fed Though murmuring ever; hath it truly trod Such paths for nothing? Shall it not be brought To stand awe-stricken 'neath some Mount of God Wrapt in thick clouds of thunder fire and gloom, And hear the Law of Heaven by which its doom To good or evil must be henceforth wrought? III. The moon hung golden, large, and round, Soothing its beauty up the quiet sky In swanlike slow pulsations, while I wound Through dewy meads and gardens of rich flowers, Whose fragrance like a subtle harmony Was fascination to the languid hours. A tender mist of light was interfused Upon the hills and waters, woods and leas, Throughout the gloomless gloaming; and I mused Dim thoughts deep-floating in delicious dream, Until the long stern lines of cypress trees, Amidst whose plumes funereal there did seem To creep with quivering sobs a moaning breath, Awed back my heart to life—to life and death. Far in the mystic moonlight lay outspread, In trance of solemn beauty still and weird, That Camp and City of the ancient dead; And far around stood up in dense array Those monumental marbles ever reared By men still battling with the powers of Life To those released before them from its sway: Victors or vanquished in the fearful strife, What matters?—ah, within our Mother's breast, From toil and tumult, sin and sorrow free, Sphered beyond hope and dread, divinely calm, They lie, all gathered into perfect rest; And o'er the trance of their Eternity The Cypress waves more holy than the palm. IV. A funeral train was gathered round a bier: The reverend priest with lifted hands and face, Appealing silently to Heaven's grace For this young soul called early from our sphere; And white-robed maidens pale, whose hands scarce held What further symbol flowers they had to shed Upon their sweet lost sister,—awe and dread Numbing their noisier grief, they stood compelled To meet Death's eyes which wither youth from Life; And leaning sole against a tree apart, As one might lean just stricken to the heart, A youth, wrought calm by woe's self-slaying strife— His head was sunken nerveless on his breast, He stood a dumb blind statue of Despair. While all yet moved not, I approached them there, Murmuring: They bring this maiden to her rest Beneath the pure sad moon, in thoughtful night, Rather than in the garish day whose King Rides through the Heavens for ever triumphing Throned above ruth in never-darkened light; That ere the blank dawn chills them they may gaze, And see her soul as some white cloud on high Floating serenely up the star-strewn sky. . . . My steps were now close near them, when amaze Convulsed me with a swooning suddenness— What people dwell within this Silent Land, Who thus have placed, through day and night to stand, This Scene complete in all its images Of Life in solemn conference with Death, Amidst the wide and populous solitude Of Death's own realm?—a people of strange mood. For all,—the maidens meek with bated breath And eyes weighed down by awe and fear and sorrow, The priest appealing to the Heavens above, The youth whose mortal night could hope no morrow, The sweet young girl new riven from his love,— All save the flowers, the withered flowers alone, Were carven weirdly in unconscious stone. V. Beneath my gaze was spread the princely mart. From out the folded hills came broad the stream Whose pulse flowed lifefull through the City's heart— The City dead in ever-voiceless dream. From all her stately mansions, reared apart 'Midst lawns and gardens, came no lamplight gleam, No cheerful glow and smoke of household fire; No festal music dying through the night, Sad in its death as joyous in its birth; No serenades intoning soft desire, To which young hearts in secret throb delight; No noise of banded revellers issuing forth With shouts and songs and jars, Who find the pale moon reeling jollily And twinkling laughters in the high cold stars. Between the hills and sea Only a dark dead dearth Of soulless silence yawned in dreadful mystery. VI. My limbs were shuddering while my veins ran fire, And hounded on by dread No less than by desire, I plunged into the City of the Dead, And pierced its Mausolean loneliness— Between the self-sufficing palaces, Broad fronts of azure, fire and gold, which shone Spectrally pallid in the moonlight wan; Adown great streets; through spacious sylvan squares, Whose fountains plashing lone Fretted the silence with perpetual moan; Past range on range of marts which spread their wares Weirdly unlighted to the eyes of heaven, Jewels and silks and golden ornaments, Rich perfumes soul-in-soul of all rare scents, Viols and timbrels,—O wild mockery! Where are the living shrines for these adornings? Shall love-tormented phantoms hither hie, Resolvèd that the tomb be no more mute, And thrill their heart-sick plaints from lyre and lute To plead against fair phantoms' cruel scornings; Wakening dim ghosts of buried melodies To shiver out beneath the scornful skies, And wander homeless till they fail of breath About this desert realm of timeless death? VII. What saw I in the City, which could make All thought a frenzy and all feeling madness? What found I in the City for whose sake Blank death were welcome as a restful gladness? I hold it truth, that what the stars and moon Can gaze upon with clear and steadfast eyes, Still soaring as of old to reach their noon, Serenely regnant in unwithered skies; That scene should never fill a human being With hopelessness of horror in the seeing. Can souls be blighted where the mere trees grow? Can lives be frozen where the dead streams flow? Can Man be prostrate where the fleeting mountains Stand up and fling abroad their joyous fountains? Could oceans, hills, stars, heavens, those imageries And shadows of our sole realities, Endure but for a moment undestroyed Were we extinct—Eternity left void? O truth beyond our sin and death's concealing!— The ghastliest den, worst Hell of pain and fear, In which a spirit can have will, thought, feeling, Is to that spirit no unnatural sphere; Nor justifies that spirit for the death Of firm self-trust, of love and hope and faith. VIII. What found I in the City, then, which turned My deep and solemn hope to wild despair? What mystery of horror lay inurned Within the royal City great and fair? What found I?—Dead stone sentries stony-eyed, Erect, steel-sworded, brass-defended all, Guarding the sombrous gateway deep and wide Hewn like a cavern through the mighty wall; Stone statues all throughout the streets and squares, Grouped as in social converse or alone; Dim stony merchants holding forth rich wares To catch the choice of purchasers of stone; Fair statues leaning over balconies, Whose bosoms made the bronze and marble chill; Statues about the lawns, beneath the trees; Firm sculptured horsemen on stone horses still; Statues fixed gazing on the flowing river Over the bridge's sculptured parapet; Statues in boats, amidst its sway and quiver Immovable as if in ice-waves set:— The whole vast sea of life about me lay, The passionate, heaving, restless, sounding life, With all its tides and billows, foam and spray, Arrested in full tumult of its strife Frozen into a nightmare's ghastly death, Struck silent from its laughter and its moan; The vigorous heart and brain and blood and breath Stark, strangled, coffined in eternal stone. IX. Look away there to the right—How the bay lies broad and bright, All athrob with murmurous rapture in the glory of the moon! See in front the palace stand, halls and columns nobly planned; Marble home for marble dwellers is it not full fair and boon? See the myriads gathered there in that green and wooded square, In mysterious congregation,—they are statues every one: All are clothed in rich array; it is some high festal day; The solemnity is perfect with that pallid moon for sun. See the theatre ranged high to its dome of deep blue sky; Tier on tier of serried statues glare impassioned on its stage, On its background of deep night, on its sculptured Chorus white, On its lofty sculptured actors locked in deadly tragic rage: Perhaps the drama was too great,—Titans, Furies, eyeless Fate Brooded in such sulphurous darkness thunder-swollen o'er its doom, That the multitude abide overwrought and petrified, Waiting till satyric sun-bursts rend away the crushing gloom. Turn, and o'er the river mark that huge structure scowling dark: It is black stone seamed with crimson, hopeless death with cruel gore: In it stony jailers guard stony prisoners evil-starred; Dungeoned thus within their dungeon, they are calm and groan no more. Note the temples every one—How the great gods are undone! Not a steer or goat or doveling for their holy hunger dies: Cold, long quenched their sacred fires; dull, long dumb their flattering quires; All the very priesthood staring at rich gifts with stolid eyes! Not a maid whose yielding charms can enrich a god's bold arms; Yet perchance they dwell contented though thus shorn of wealth and state: Nectar-and-ambrosia-blest, they may bask in perfect rest, Since (with marble joints and larynx) Man rests unimportunate! Ha! search eagerly around—every vault beneath the ground, Every mansion, every chariot, every galley, everywhere; And for ever, ever find all this blissful human kind Lifted up from clay's corruption into marble firm and fair: Fear and shame and anguish stilled, every evil passion killed, Crooked forms and ugly faces grown transcendent works of art; While the grand or lovely mood of the fair and young and good Is beatified in beauty that can nevermore depart. . . . And the full moon gazeth down on the smokeless lampless town, In a solemn trance of triumph, with her choir of radiant stars; For their peace is vext no more by a curse-and-shriek-swelled roar, By ferocities, obscenities, inebriate brawls and jars: Nay, the very grass and trees, and the disencumbered breeze, And the stainless river-waters, and the broad bright glittering bay,— Do they all joy that the strife of our sordid restless life Is now locked in adamantine bonds of perfect peace for aye? Ever-loved and gracious Earth, Mystic Mother of our birth, This is cruel, bitter, terrible, this joy in our dead rest! Canst Thou still leap forth and run, glory-speeded round the Sun, O Thou Niobe of World-stars, with Thy fairest and Thy best— With Thy vigorous youthful darling lying stone-cold on Thy breast! X. The Palace gates stand open wide and free; The King and Queen and all their company, Transfigured in full splendour of their pride, Came flowing forth in one refulgent tide, While trumpets rang their silver-throated blare Of jubilation through the sunny air; Swept onward slowly 'neath the azure skies Between the myriads of adoring eyes, And poured into the Theatre's dense sea Of many-billowed life triumphantly; As some grand river in the sunset shine May pour its boon of gold and crimson wine, Brimming the fulness of the purpled ocean Which heaves and sparkles, murmuring proud emotion. Gathered together, all awaited there Such scenic storms as purify life's air; Whose scathless lightnings shimmer wildly grand, Whose lofty thunders soothe sure peace more bland; And now, without a throb, without a breath, They wait, all frozen into icy death. XI. O marble Monarch, far more awful now Than when thy crown begirt a throbbing brow! No tyrant ever lived so dire and dread As He who sways the sceptre in thy stead; Never before on earth did any state Beneath oppression cower thus desolate, Thus utterly resigned to crushing Fate! Silence broods ghastly on the dead realm's throne: Whatever life, in prayer, or sigh, or moan, Would shake the Nightmare of his tyranny, Shudders with anguish, horror, lunacy, To feel its scorned and strangled pleadings creep Like homeless spectres through the vacant deep, And wither into nothingness at last— Devoid of refuge, unrelieved, aghast. XII. The Palace gates indeed stand open wide: Perchance the stately sepulchre may hide Some single life amidst the desolation, Preserved alone in mystical salvation, Entranced apart in holy contemplation? Pace up the steps, tread through the hall,—and see In scattered groups all lounging listlessly Those armoured gallants of the Royal Guard— Poor fellows! they have found it sadly hard To make their stately moments speed along, Though spurred with wine and gaming, jest and song, Cruelly mulcted of their sumptuous share In the great festival proceeding there. XIII. Haste on, haste on; awaken from their tomb The ghostly echoes, swarming through the gloom, Haunting your footsteps, gathering rank on rank, Rustling demoniac through the deadly blank; Better, far better that the air be rife With weird deliriums of demoniac life, Than void with utter idiotic death. Haste on, with burning blood and breathless breath;— How clear are all things round the rapid flight! Shrouded in gloom or washed with pale moonlight, The chemistry of terror thus intense Burns them all lurid on the shrinking sense.— See the mild maiden letting loose her soul In tears and blushes o'er the tender scroll Which plains his anguish since they two were parted, And raves that she, poor thing, is stony-hearted. Hurry from room to room, from hall to hall; And mark the effigies on every wall— Warriors and minstrels, nobles, kings, and priests, Adoring, conquering, feasting royal feasts; Olympian forms, ladies divinely fair With lily-sceptred hands and flower-crowned hair; See each and all ev'n as you hurry past Burst into sudden life, and swarming fast Join in the tingling chase through death and night, While clamorous echoes voice their mad delight. XIV. Most sweet young Mother! thou hadst ample pleasure Left quiet alone here with thine infant treasure; Which, poised unsurely on its feeble limbs, Across the sea-strange marble toward thee swims,— One foot half-lifted, while the arms outplead For thine extended arms to help its need: It stands, thou kneelest; never on thy breast Shall it fall forward in triumphant rest. XV. Far in his lofty turret whence the bay And half of Heaven's vault were seen alway; The bay, the distant ocean, and with these Broad scope of temples, streets, and palaces, The theatre, the square; the moving throngs, Whose converse-murmurs flashing into songs And laughters winged with joy were wont to rise And wander bird-like through the sun-tranced skies, Rippling deliciously the languid air; Alone, yet not alone, the Sage dwelt there. Doubtless his individual life required In seeming solitude to be inspired By constant intercourse with general life, And with the universal Spirit rife In Man and Nature,—One in all their forms, Alike contented with its worlds and worms, Through all its countless masks alike resplendent, The Breath of Life, eternal and transcendent. XVI. He sits, the full-length statue of a Sage, Amid the busts of those of every age Who handed on the torch of Wisdom, bright With growing splendour, 'thwart the billowy night Of shoreless Ignorance. Before him lies The roll which telleth on what mysteries He shed its lustre till they shone out clear: I trace its periods by the moonlight here. It is with swelling reverence dedicate, “Unto the King magnifical and great; The bounteous Sun by whom we live and move And flourish ever: Who commands our love Even more throughly than our perfect awe; Swaying His burning Throne by Heavenly law, While lifted far—by nature as by birth— Above the petty statutes of our earth: Who while His warmth createth and sustaineth Rich life in all, lights all; and no less deigneth To feed abundantly with life and light What humble spheres may strive to temper night In realms left dark while His imperial sway Vouchsafeth happier realms their boon of day: To Him, by Whom our heritage is grown The flower o' the World; to Him whose godlike throne Shall ever stand beside its subject sea, Fulgent with valour, arts and equity, Based on a princely people's love and bliss: Chrysandros, Tyrant of Cosmopolis!” XVII. Follow the problems which he hath resolved Though heretofore in clouds of doubt involved: “Shall this fair World consume in course of time? Our Earth is young? or old? or in her prime?” Whereto the Theses proud, less said than sung In liberal phrases of his golden tongue: “This glorious Universe shall live for ever; By all decay and death diminished never, Nor added to by constant birth and growth; But in the balanced interchange of both, Ascending slowly by successive stages Of nobler Good and Beauty through the Ages; Until its infinite Æther and the Whole Of stars and spheres that through it flashing roll Shall be informed with conscious Life and Soul: The All, one perfect Sphere, breathing one breath Of cosmic Life too pure for birth or death. . . . Our Earth has scarcely ceased to be a child, Sweet in its grace, but ignorant and wild: She putteth on about these very years The bloom of maidenhood, whose smiles and tears Are all of Love: She openeth out her heart In throbs of passionate rapture, to impart The dearest secrets of her treasured beauty To Man, her Lord; constrained by yearning duty Which he shall recompense with wiser love: How blest are we all previous men above, Born in this Spring of her millennial Youth!— O gracious Truth, divine and tranquil Truth, As I long years have worshipped only Thee, Thou hast at length unveiled Thy face to me, That I may ever of Thy priesthood be!” XVIII. I trace not further in the tingling scroll The steps by which he reached this glorious goal. It is too horrible:—alone, alone. I make mad dalliance with the empty flesh, Whose form is whole, whose ghastly bloom is fresh; And by my side, that hater of the soul— The grinning, the accursèd Skeleton! It is too horrible—O dreadful God, Thou know'st—only Thou, What dismal paths my shuddering feet have trod; Yet never knew I agony until now; Never,—O Thou who heardst me when I said Coldly and quietly, with confirming heart, “I take thee, Misery, for my faithful Bride: Despair hath smoothed the secret marriage-bed Wherein we two, embracing close, may hide, And wreak our stern unwitnessed vow— Never in life, nor after death, to part. I love thee for the love which only Thou Dost bear me: Thy caresses Sting my faint heart, Thy kisses on my brow Are fire and numbing frost, Thy tingling tresses Like serpents creep about me even now. O my enamoured Darling, deadly sweet! Sorcery smitten Sorceress! Queen of lurid loveliness! Most tender-hearted Ministrant of Ill! My life, my soul is lying at your feet; Possess me, use me, at your own wild will!” XIX. O fool, fool, fool! cherishing fatal madness! Mad with self-consciousness of guilt and woe, Mad with the folly of the world's much gladness While it was no less sunk in guilt and woe; I shut myself up from the lives around me, Eating my own foul heart—envenomed food; And while dark shadows more and more enwound me, Nourished a dreary pride of solitude; The cords of sympathy which should have bound me In sweet communion with earth's brotherhood, I drew in tight and tighter still around me, Strangling my best existence for a mood. What—Solitude in midst of a great City, In midst of crowded myriads brimmed with Life!— When every tear of anguish or of pity, When every shout of joy and scream of strife, When every deed and word and glance and gesture, Every emotion, impulse, secret thought Pent in the soul from all material vesture, Through all those myriads spread and interwrought; Inspiring each the air with its own spirit, Rayed forth as light is from a fount intense; The universal Æther forced to bear it, A certain though mysterious influence Affecting duly every other creature That breathed its breath of life; for good or ill, For pain or pleasure, acting on each nature, Beyond the consciousness, despite the will. Dire Vanity! to think to break the union That interweaveth strictly soul with soul In constant, sane, life-nourishing communion: The rivers ever to the ocean roll, The ocean-waters feed the clouds on high Whose rains descending feed the flowing rivers All the world's children must how quickly die Were they not all receivers and all givers! XX. But this is Solitude, O dreadful Lord! My spirit starves in this abysmal air— Of every human word, Of sigh and moan, of music and of prayer, Of passionate heart-beats felt though never heard, So utterly stript bare: The awful heavens are tranquil and divine, Serene and saintly in their purple deep The moon and young stars shine; No living souls beneath their influence leap, No other eyes are fixed on them with mine: Men said that Death and Sleep Are brothers;—yes, as lurid lightnings may Be kindred to the glory of calm day, Or darkness of the restful night-tide boon To darkness of the sun eclipsed at noon. . . . The Soul is murdered; and her world bereft By some dire doom still left, A fadeless corpse whose perfect form is rife “With ghastly affectations of true life.” XXI. How long, how long, I cowered beside the Sage; Whose head was lifted, fronting full the skies In tranquil triumph from his victory lone. Beneath that broad brow rough with thought and age, The pitiless light-beams glittered on his eyes, Like fatal swords flashed keen against a stone To sharpen them for piercing to the heart,— How was his triumph smitten, pierct, and slain! But cowering there apart, Upon those swelling eyeballs, that stern head, I ever gazed; while in my burning brain A cold thought soothing spread: As one who drains a poison-chalice slowly, In fixed and infinite longing to be dead; So let my yearning vision cleave amain To this grand marble image melancholy, Till I have drunken in to the last drain That poisonous Spirit of Death which fills it wholly. . . . The flesh that crept like worms is growing numb; The raging fire of blood is dying cold; The rout of fiendish thoughts are almost dumb: The heavens fade like a Vision cycles-old, Where from dead eyes gaze thoughts uncomprehended: Thank God, I soon shall cease to be alone; My mad discordant life is nearly blended With all this realm's unsuffering death of stone. Part III. THE JUDGMENTS. I. A multitudinous roaring of the ocean! Voices of sudden and earth-quaking thunder From the invisible mountains! The heavens are broken up and rent asunder By curbless lightning-fountains, Streaming and darting through that black commotion, In which the moon and stars are swallowed with the sky. Throughout the Mausolean City spread Drear palpitations, long-drawn moan and sigh; And then—an overwhelming whirlwind blast? Or else, indeed, the irrepressible cry Of all its statues waking up aghast! Doth God in final Judgment come thus heralded? II. I saw Titanic forms dark, solemn, slow, Like thunderclouds imperious o'er the wind, Sweep far with haughty tramplings to and fro; I heard great voices peal and trumpets blow: Strange fragments of their chanting shook my mind. “If the owl haunts doleful ruins and lives in the sombre night, Could it joy in the cheerful homes of men, could it love the noonday light? If the serpent couches in jungles and deserts of burning sand, Would it rather cast its slough in the peopled corn-rich land? If the great bear prowls alone in desolate wastes of ice, Could it joy to range in herded power through a tropic Paradise? If the vulture gorges on carrion and all abhorrent things, Would it rather slake with fruits and wine the rush of its obscene wings? “We sought through the archives of Fate, through all the records of Doom, Records of noontide refulgence, records of lightning-seared gloom: And lo, we have never found while the highth and the depth we explored, We have never yet traced out Punishment or Reward. “Peace may be happy and sweet; bitter and heart-rending Strife; Sin is corruption and death, Virtue is health and life: But every being is placed in that sphere, in that crisis, that spot, Which alone its own nature demands and asserts for its lot: As itself from itself its web the spider spins out, Doth each all the net of relations which weave it about: The sun shines the sun by the lustre he lavishes forth; For his might and his life and his light circles round him the earth: All the World—this infinite azure robe sphere-spangled sublime, In which God walks forth revealed and veiled to the creatures of Space and Time, Is all interwoven in one (each atom, each star, as each soul, Evolving so duly the threads of its work for its part in the Whole): With a woof and warp of might and light and mysteries all is wrought, For the many-figured, many-hued being and passion and thought. “Here hath a spirit full bliss to breathe ever-bland golden air; Here hath a spirit wild hurrying storms of doubt, dread, anguish, despair: For the world-realms are swept on their path for ever, through day and night; And their course is advanced no less, no more, in the gloom than in the light: And the journey is infinite truly,—through every various clime Do the countless myriads wander on, through every season of time; Cool water for him in the desert-blaze, red fire for him in the frost, Languor for him in the summer-peace, fierce heart for the tempest-tost: While all whence they know not whither they know not wend; Who appraiseth the means and progress, who conceiveth the end? But we swear by the Life Eternal, we swear by Eternal Death, We swear by the Fate supreme which rules in every pulse and breath; That strong or weak, simple or wise, polluted or most holy, Each each day is fed with the food befitting him fully and solely.” III. Again deep peace, again the stars and moon: I stood between the theatre and square, Beholding as before the statues there Unstirred and silent in the lethal swoon. Lo! in the empyréan grew a light— A great and awful Splendour, through its shroud Of fold on fold of massy thundercloud Intensely burning down with steadfast might. Wherefrom a Voice descended vast and lone; Of thunder-dreadfulness, of sea-fierce anger, Yet in its lofty silver-volumed clangour Chanting an unimpassioned monotone: “When all the wine is poisoned it must be Destroyèd utterly; The vessels also which contained it must Be burned and ground to dust.” Instantly shudderings shook the stony crowd; Some rigid arms with writhing spasms were lifted, Some dungeon-throats with frenzy-spasms rifted By hideous strangled voices shrieking loud: “Abominable Fate, We hurl thee back thy hate! The poison and the wine— Our sins and souls are thine! Ah! pangs of utter death Stifle our breath— Hear us; we plead; hear us; oh, wait!” No answer came save trumpet-voices blaring Death and destruction as in furious fray; And while those forms gasped out their cry despairing They sank down crumbling into dusty spray. Then, as the trumpet clamours died away, Did crash on crash in clear succession sound, Like lingering peals of thunder; each the knell Of house or column falling to the ground In sudden ruin, as those statues fell. And next, as if the solid hills were all Disseated now to glide tremendously Over the town and plunge athwart the sea, A mass of gloom enveloped in its pall Temple and palace, basement, dome and spire; Then o'er the marble crowd submerging came: Its black oppression burned throughout my frame, A torture of intolerable fire. Yet when at length its ponderous bulk was rolled Over the shrinking waters out of sight, The City and the steadfast statues white Stood all unchanged about me; but, behold, The uttered condemnation had been wrought Upon the ruined fragments,—they were naught. IV. That cloud-consuming fire still held the sky, Blotting its worlds out wholly; while the sphere Seemed listening breathless in an awful fear, Till that great Voice again rang forth on high: “When now the sapless tree bears bloom nor fruit, Why linger trunk and root? Let it be hewn away and fire-destroyed; And in its place left void A living tree be set to spread and rise, Responsive to the bounty of the skies.” The sentence smote some statues like a sword; With nerveless gestures pitiful to see They moaned their helpless hopeless litany, “We lived, we lived, O great and dreadful Lord!” Then as they crumbled into dust away, The Answer speeded from the hills behind,— A noise of rushing like a mighty wind: The ashen fire-flood in a tempest grey Hissed through the City and the wan array; And hurrying o'er the sea, as if its might With grim joy hasted to fulfil such trust, Swept all the human and palatial dust To irretrievable Chaos, Death and Night. And when that deadly storm of fire was past, A Voice came roaring like its final blast: “Whose virtue cannot pay their Life's expense, Whose souls are lost in sense, They are no more; themselves with God have willed,— Their æon is fulfilled.” V. Once more that fire possessing sole the sky, Once more deep silence o'er the lessened throng Of waiting statues; and it lasted long Ere that great Voice again pealed forth on high: “When he who had a Palace and its power, Well-favoured for his dower, Has proved unjust and proud, has spent its treasures On selfish pomps and pleasures; He must descend from his exalted place: Yet, if in deep disgrace He do not sink still deeper, till his breath Be wholly quenched in death; But learn to build again his kingly heart, The throne awaits him and the kingly part.” Ah! what a multitude of statues then Were shaken by the thunder of this doom!— “O Lord! all perish if Thou wilt consume In justice! Lord have mercy on frail men!” Ev'n as the crash of smitten structures roared The answering Judgment-terrors filled the sky: Inexorably swift it streamed and poured A red-fire deluge from that cloud on high, Which drowned the City and the multitude, Devouring all the space from hills to sea. Hissing and roaring the resistless flood Plunged through the trembling earth, in haste to flee With its vast ravage; and the earth gaped wide To swallow in that cup of wrath amain, Then gnashed her seared and riven jaws to hide What shook her yet with shuddering throbs of pain How many had become the torrent's prey, Swept down abrupt into some lower sphere! But of the rest—can vision cheat me here? What forms are these amidst the wan array Of human marble? Strange new stony forms— These serpents, panthers, wolves, these apes and swine, Vultures and hawks and owls, with sheep and kine, And many others, brutes and birds and worms, Couched in unutterably piteous rest, The sorcery of that Judgment-fire attest. VI. No more wild agonies shook the steadfast Earth; That night of cloud, unable to sustain Its soul of fire, was withering; when again Upon the silence that great Voice flowed forth: “When he who should have travelled all the day, Has lingered on his way To sport with idlers; or in common fear Of lone paths steep and drear, Has turned aside to pace down crowded roads Of rich and gay abodes; He must plod this day's journey on the morrow With weary rue and sorrow, Ere he can win his happy home, and greet The dear friends waiting for his laggard feet.” Whereunto statue-voices low implored: “Free human fellowship is very sweet; Bitter with our own kind as foes to meet— Heavy the load of uncompanioned life! Alas, we are so weary-sick of strife! Grant us awhile Thy perfect peace, O Lord!” The humble plaining of that saddest prayer, Relapsing into stony silentness, So filled my heart that I was unaware Until surrounded by its sway and stress, How the deep Ocean rushing from its lair Bellowed against the hillslopes planted broad; Whilst fierce from sea-vast cloudglooms in the air, Blazoned with dreadful sentences of God In writhed and quivering lightnings wrought, the rain Intense of swerveless thunderbolts streamed down, Crashing amidst the ruins of the town, And shrieking through the loud inundent main. VII. The flood below, the flood above ebbed soon Completely; fair and still the green earth lay, Beneath a heaven surcharged with tenfold day, More holy-sweet of lustre than the moon. I gazed: the statues stood there as before, Like dateless boulders by the old sea-shore: But of the City's vast palatial pride Of all the works of Man on every side— The theatre's stupendous cirque of tiers, The pharos and the galleons and the piers, Remained no vestige; save that here and there, Bathed in the sea of crystal-lucent air, Some fragment wall, some column cleft stood dim, More like strange rocks than structures reared by Him. Had that swift deluge been the stream of Time, And every billow some vast age sublime, Over the vacant City flowing ever Until a mind should swoon in the endeavour Such infinite cycles of its course to mete, Erasure had been scarcely more complete. VIII. The cloud was vanished from the perfect sky; Heaven earth and sea all floated from my sight, Bathed in a dimness of exceeding light Too pure, intense, and calm for mortal eye. And yet I saw as we may see in trance,— Saw how a gradual change beatified The statues who had never yet replied When those dread Judgments took dread utterance. As Memnon woke to music with the dawn, They in the solemn splendour seemed to rouse From death to life, with glory on their brows; A calm grand life, eyes shut and breath undrawn. The crystal sea of sky then streamed away, The inmost Heavens revealed themselves abroad: A Throne . . . the Vision of the Living God . . . Ravished and blind upon the earth I lay. Once more a Voice descended vast and lone, The Voice of Infinite Love Omnipotent; Sweeter than life or death, it swelled and blent The Universe all tuned into one tone: “The soldier who has fought the noble fight, Persistent for the right, Enduring all and daring all to prove His glad unpurchased love And faithfulness, in triumph and defeat: What doom for him is meet? The Battle, with the day it filled, is done; The field is lost or won: Let Night then greet him well with joy and rest By holy visions blest; That on the Morrow he may rise up strong Hopeful and fresh and young, His sharp wounds healed, to do and dare once more Heroic as before,— But with a loftier rank, with nobler power, With far more generous dower. And so for ever through the Nights and Days While he remaineth lord of his own praise, He may go on, exalted more and more, Till final triumph crown the fateful war; Till Love and Life and Bliss (which once was Faith) Have vanquished wholly Evil, Falsehood, Death; The loftiest station that his soul can fill, The utmost sway commensurate with his will, The All of Wisdom that he can believe, Of Love and Goodness that he can receive, Are then his dower from the reachless Throne And Him who reigns eternally thereon.” IX. I heard it all,—there prostrate on the ground; I floated in the Voice as in a sea, Or as a cloud may float dissolvingly Within the sapphire noontide's burning bound. And when it ebbed it left my shrinking soul To shudder back into its cave of clay, Blind, hopeless, one dead atom fallen astray From vital union in and with the Whole. After a time, from such fierce consciousness Of personal being as is lunacy— As not to know is perfectly to be— I was withdrawn by human utterances: “O Lord! let us be hidden, let us die! Thy love and wisdom are too infinite! We throb unpeaceful in Thy perfect light, Star-specks of gloom no Sun can glorify. “Were we less dark than our old midnight sphere, Transplant us not into Thy blinding day. Lord, we adore Thee, Perfect, Sole, for aye— Our sins and weakness crush our spirits here!” X. No answer sounded. I arose and stood. The gates of Heaven were shut, the Vision gone: But still undimmed miraculously shone That tenfold noon of glareless sanctitude. They stood—the Spirits who had conquered life; Erect, yet pleading, hands uplifted, there; Glorious—yet wan with that divine despair: Was this the crowning issue of the strife? The noble faces slowly turned to where The dim hills floated, exquisitely drawn Or interfused, like breathless streaks of dawn, Upon the breathless ocean of wide air. Thereon uplifted stood a lofty band; Some burning with the glory of their wings; Some golden-crowned and purple-robed like Kings; Some clad in white, a palm-branch in the hand; Some like stern warriors armed with shield and sword; Some swaying crystal cups in which the fire Of red wine quivered; while a radiant quire Striking their harps sang loud with sweet accord. XI. “Dear Friends, come! we wait for you; Strong and wise and pure and true. Why, alas, ascend so few? “Where are the myriads that should now be here? How have they wasted all the lavish dower With which God fitted them to rule their sphere— The Passion and the Vision and the Power? For ever hoping, disappointed ever, We know too well the constant tragic doom: Vision hath seen, with scarce a work-endeavour, Then closed its eyes for more voluptuous gloom; Passion hath disenshrined the awful soul, Its large heart tempting fatal fleshly lusts; And Power hath shaken off divine control, To gorge itself with universal trusts. “For the undone Many, ruth, Ye have conquered, true to truth; Dare our wine of Joy and Youth. “The tree whose trunk and branches dark and bare Withstood the storms of Winter, planted strong; Doth glorify itself in summer's air With leaf and fruit and nested bird's blithe song: The earth-realm labouring blind and dumb and cheerless, Yet ever onward, through the reign of night; Leaps forth with joy majestically fearless Into the pure new heaven of morning light. Again stern Winter with its storms shall come, But find the tree grown stronger 'gainst its wrath; Again the night-gloom, weary, blind and dumb, But find the realm far forward on its path. “Then, dear Friends, come, come away! Now is Summer, now is Day; Joy assumes imperial sway!” XII. As when the warm spring-breezes overblow Some silent, frozen, melancholy main, Its waters heave and throb and rend their chain, And singing in the sunbeams flash and flow: So with the breathing of that gracious song Those Spirits burst their trance of silent sadness; Their bosoms heaved with glorious life and gladness; Clear-eyed, erect, full-voiced, advanced their throng: “O Brothers of this Heaven supreme and glorious! O Sisters of this greeting full of love! Into what a dawn of perfect day victorious, Do ye usher us, and welcome us above! The World o'erflows with life serene and tender; The air, the light is all celestial wine; Our inmost soul is interfused with splendour And harmony divine! “As birds the boundless azure sky-deep winging, As breezes flowing round and round the earth, As flowers into the vernal welcome springing, As fountains leaping seaward bright with mirth; Our thoughts throughout Infinity float chainless, Our souls encompass spheres of life sublime, Our beings thrill and glow with new life stainless, Our swift joy laughs at Time! “The worlds go wheeling far their cycled courses,— From the fathomless Unbirth of the Abyss, By golden laws attuning counter-forces Built up into the noonday Heaven of Bliss: And pervading all, sustaining all, enwreathing With its infinite embrace beneath, above, The Æther—the Divine eternal breathing Of Life and Light and Love!” XIII. So singing they advanced with measured pace; And like a silver morning-mist were drawn Slow floating up the hillside wood and lawn, Unto that high seraphical embrace. All stood triumphant, beautiful, divine, Between the heaven and earth; all stood there bright; Informed, transfigured with the holy light As crystal cups with sacramental wine. I would have stood there evermore and gazed Entranced in adoration, consciousless, Upon that beauty of all holiness In human forms embodied and upraised. Alas! the universal light too soon Was fading, flowing backward to its fount, Until they stood upon that sombre mount Sole-shining o'er the dark earth as a moon. And still the glory-stream flowed back to God; And they with it were floated up the sky; Whose gates shut blank against my straining eye, And left the earth a dark and soulless clod— Left all the earth like some most desolate shore Wherefrom has ebbed the free and living tide; And left me stranded on its dark waste wide, A wreck to be recovered nevermore. O Life! this is thy deepest woe of all— That as a soul regains its heaven of birth, The body drags it swooning back to earth, Stunned, hopeless, blind with its tremendous fall. XIV. When I arose the ever ancient Night Filled with his sombre pomp the earth and sky: No memories of that doom of dire affright Perturbed the calm; and undismayed on high The moon and stars where they had shone before Shone on in cold and stern sublimity. The hills loomed dark upon the silent shore, Round which the waves in thoughtful monotone Rolled their old voice of Ever—evermore. A royal City dwelt upon this throne,— And what now left of all its wealth and pride? A few strange groups of pallid-gleaming stone! But Nature cares not for the ruin wide, Her dreaming beauty glows in perfect bloom: Most cold, imperial, unlamenting Bride, Her Lord and Bridegroom scarcely in the tomb. . . The moon sank slowly down from heaven's crest; Pale radiance lined and flecked the eastern gloom; A stir, a breathing thrilled the world's deep rest; No wakening bird, half-wakened, here and there Uttered uncertain warning from its nest; But spread a cold and fresh and fragrant air, That seemed with lifeful breath to cleanse away The grosser shades and vapours everywhere, And all memorials of the night's dismay, That pure and odorous the earth might greet The first divine embraces of the Day, Now hurrying up the heavens with fiery feet, The crown of burning gold upon his head, Cloud-robed with gold and purple, light and heat. . . . Ages on ages in their course have shed Ruin of fire and tempest on the earth, Uncounted æons of her sons are dead; Yet she exults with aboriginal mirth, Nor feels her frame grow weak, her blood grow cold, But pure and strong and young as at her birth When first God's hand her glorious path outrolled: For day by day He seals her with His sign— Night's tomb is rent, the gates of heaven unfold To let the ever-youngest Dawn divine, Bathe her in balms of sempiternal youth. I think no human soul which here doth pine In personal anguish and with general ruth, Without these Dawn-evangels fresh from God Could feel its immortality a truth. Dear are all dawns; but this that coming trod The eastern heavens to kiss the earth's pale brow With heavenly benedictions, when the rod Of the Avenging Justice was but now Withdrawn from penal smitings dire!—what speech That mortals use, what words of lofty vow Or soaring chant can emulate and reach The awe, the bliss, the gratitude, the love, That saving dawn brought with it from above? XV. What a dawn ascendeth fair through the pure and silent air, Fain to greet with holy rapture what a glorious virgin Earth! From her sins and fears and woes, from her memories, by the throes Of a fierce regeneration born anew in perfect birth! But what forms, what forms are they, there between the sea-loved bay And the spiritual hills with the woods that clothe their feet; Human forms erect in power, beasts that crouch and birds that cower, But all wrought in fadeless marble, white and shining, pure and sweet? Lo! as ever more and more broadening out the dawn doth soar, Kindling emerald purple golden quivering splendours round her way; What a flush—as if of Life kindling with triumphant strife Through the torpid marble—fires them, though they all so steadfast stay! Lo! as ever more and more music with the dawn doth soar, Breezes whisper, leaflets murmur, waters warble joy for day; What a thrill—as if of Life stirring with triumphant strife Through the rigid marble—heaves them, though they all so silent stay! These are forms that couch and stand, still as marble fountains grand, Still in meek victorious patience, till the Sea of Life arise; Till the World-sustaining Sea, Soul of all Eternity, Once more fill them with Its waters of the Life that never dies. When the Royal Sun shall leap glorious on yon eastern steep, Gazing grand athwart this province of his measureless domains; Straightway at that conquering sign, straightway at that glance divine, Soul shall fill them, stone encarnate, life-blood gush through all their veins. And this Nature which doth dream in Titanic sloth supreme, Hill and river, wood and meadow, heaven of azure, careless sea, Shall have all its want fulfilled, strength employed and bosom thrilled By a lordly domination—soul and thought and passion free. Oh, that these who in this hour shall attain such solemn dower, Consecrated Lords and Bridegrooms wedding this fair virgin Earth, Have such holy strength of will, love, faith, truth unquenchable, Wisdom, justice, making concord of inheritance and worth, As shall give a nobler being from the blissful marriage birth! XVI. As one who in the morning-shine Reels homeward, shameful, wan, adust, From orgies wild with fiery wine And reckless sin and brutish lust: And sees a doorway open wide, And then the grand Cathedral space; And hurries in to crouch and hide His trembling frame, his branded face. The organ-thunders surge and roll And thrill the heights of branching stone; They shake his mind, they crush his soul, His heart knells to them with a moan: He hears the voice of holy prayer, The chanting of the fervent hymn; They pierce his depths of sick despair, He trembles more, his eyes are dim. He sees the world-wide morning flame Through windows where in glory shine The saints who fought and overcame, The martyrs who made death divine: He sees pure women bent in prayer, Communing low with God above:— Too pure! what right has he to share Their silent feast of sacred love? How can he join the songs of praise? His throat is parched, his brain is wild: How dare he seek the Father's gaze, Thus hopeless, loveless, and defiled? How taint the pureness—though he yearn To join such fellowship for aye? . . . He creeps out pale—May he return Some time when he shall dare to stay! As he within that holy fane, Was I upon that solemn shore; One murky cloud, one spoiling stain, One jarring note,—all these and more: A Spectre from the wicked Past, Familiar with the buried years; The joys that fade, the griefs that last, The baffled hopes, the constant fears; The fair, fair dawn of many a day That sinks in storm-clouds red and wild; The souls that in their huts of clay Are crushed and buried, all defiled; The Lusts that rage like savage steeds, While Will with reinless hand sleeps on, And drunken Thought but goads their speeds,— Then one mad plunge, and all is gone; The Moods that strew palm-branches now And with Hosannas fill the sky, Then shortly crown with thorns the brow And mock and scourge and crucify; The error, guile and infamy, The waste of foul and bloody strife, The unforeseen catastrophe, That make the doleful drama, Life. Ah, what had I to do with these Young lovely souls serene and clear, Awaking up by fine degrees To life unsullied as its sphere? The Spectre that has roamed forlorn, Sin-restless, through the sombre night, Must creep to its old grave at morn, Nor blot the world of life and light. XVII. Where I had left it, on the lonely strand, Uninjured lay my boat, and lovely; seeming Some fair sea-creature, of the midsea dreaming To light foam-whispers on the yellow sand. While yet we skimmed the wavelets of the bay, Methought there rose, ev'n as the sun arose, A vehement Chorus hurrying to its close— Fresh as the breath of the awakened day. With vital fires the morning seemed to glow While it rang onward like a trumpet-blast Of keen reveillé crying: Night is past! Arouse ye dreamers, to the day and foe! The stars for ever sweep through space, surrounding Their sun-kings and God's central hidden Throne With splendour and deep music far-resounding, Though heard by pure celestial ears alone: Their music chants His lofty praise for ever, Their splendours burn to Him the Light Divine; In their grand uneager motions pausing never, They live and sing and shine. Eternally they sweep on their vast courses, With solemn joy fulfilling His behest; While the balance of stupendous counter-forces Buildeth up a stable Infinite of rest. And the Æther, breathing life through vast pulsations, Thrills with rapture to their God-supported flight; And its waves against the rushing constellations Break in the foam of light. Each world-sphere groweth grandly through the ages From its lifeless weltering unsubstantial birth, Through unnumbered fiery throes and cyclic stages Till it shines in heaven a life-abounding earth; Till its vapours are green fields and glorious oceans, Till with countless living beings it is rise: By harmony constraining dread commotions It is crowned and thronged with life. Until conscious, doubting, worshipping Immortals, As they journey on their infinite Life-way, Passing through its Birth and Death mysterious portals Inform with spirit-fire the clothing clay: And the dead, spectral, consciousless Material Is a dwelling-place for essences divine; Throbs with thought and passion deathlessly ethereal, A Heaven-honoured shrine. All spirits from their infancy's bland sleeping Must struggle to a strong and noble prime Through sins, dangers, anguish, terrors,—ever reaping Costly fruits in every season of swift Time: From their fountain in its deepest dark foundation, Glory-shrouded in the shadow of God's Throne, Through all worlds to their highest-soaring station By unrest all have grown. Life is only by perpetual on-flowing; Torpid rest is the true life-devouring death; Through stern struggles all things ever are upgrowing; Sighs and moanings prove a vital-throbbing breath. One alone—Eternal, Infinite, All-holy, Is in changeless rest; the Perfect grows nor grew: Finite souls and all things live by progress solely, All are but what they do. Part IV. THE RETURN. I. Long tranquil days one more than seven The beamless sun from out the main Went burning through the vault of Heaven, And circled to the deep again: While day by day in dreamful ease We glided o'er the glistening seas. Long calm autumnal nights just seven The moon with all her starry train Went shining through the vault of Heaven, And circled to the deep again: While night by night in dreamful ease We glided o'er the glimmering seas. Long days so rich in rest, so still; As warm as love, as calm as truth; Long nights which did those days fulfil, As some sweet girl a fervent youth: While day and night in dreamful ease We floated o'er the silent seas. Time set within his circled sky A topaz sun, a diamond moon, And thick star-pearls, and made thereby A marriage-ring of blissful boon; With which in ever-dreamful ease We floated o'er the happy seas. Did Nature sleep, and dream in sleep Of all the Spring and Summer toil Her children were about to reap,— The wealth of corn and wine and oil: As day and night in dreamful ease We floated o'er the sleeping seas? Or was it her deep-thoughted mood; A little sad, such loss had been; And grieved, the dear Past seemed so good; Yet proud, triumphant and serene: As day and night in dreamful ease We floated o'er the solemn seas? I lay in one long trance of rest And contemplation,—free from thought Of Future issue, worst or best To be from Past and Present wrought: While day and night in dreamful ease We glided o'er the trancèd seas. II. Before me, in the drowsy night outspread, The City whence in anguish I had fled A vast dark Shadow loomed: So still, so black, it gloomed, It seemed the darkness of a great abyss Gulfed in a desert bare; Around whose precipice Dim lamps burnt yellow in the vacant air, Lifted on high portentous. Yet to me Its dark suggestions were of Life, not Death; Its awful mass of life oppressed my soul: The very air appeared no longer free, But dense and sultry in the close control Of such a mighty cloud of human breath. The shapeless houses and the monstrous ships Were brooding thunderclouds that could eclipse The burning sun of day; Surcharged with storms of such electric life, Keen as the lightning to its chosen prey, Curbless and dreadful when aroused to strife. . . Who once has gazed upon the face of Death Confounds no more its calm with calmest Sleep; The terror of that beauty shadoweth His spirit with an influence too deep. III. And while I gazed upon the sleeping City, And pondered its unnumbered destinies, A flood of awe and fear and love and pity Swelled in my heart and overflowed my eyes With unexpected tears. The burden of the message I had brought From that great City far across the sea Lay heavy on my soul; as if for years And years I had been wandering wearily In travail with it: now the time was spent; Now, as a cloud with fire and thunder fraught, I must give birth with throes of agony, And perish in the bearing. So I leant Back in the boat, all desolate and distraught, Pangs shuddering through the faintness of cold fears: Death passed his hand across my brow; but went To lay its plenary pressure on some heart That throbbed true life—“for this poor pulse,” thought he, “Is not worth quelling”—I watched him depart Bearing all peace with him; when suddenly That Spirit which will never be withstood Came down and shook and seized and lifted me,— As men uplift a passive instrument Through which to breathe whatever fits their mood, Stately triumphal march or war-note dread, Anthem, gay dance, or requiem for the dead; And through my lips with irrepressible might Poured forth its own stern language on the night. IV. “Haughty and wealthy and great, mighty, magnificent, free, Empress in thine own right of the earth-surrounding sea! Broad and deep flows the river that feedeth thy mighty heart, Bringing from all the zones to crowd thine imperial mart Of all their produce the best—their silks, their gems, their gold, Their fruits and corn and wine, their luxuries thousand-fold: Thy merchants are palaced princes, thy nobles scorn great kings, Thy meanest children swell with pride beneath thy shadowing wings; And thy voice throughout the world, complacently serene, Proclaims ‘Of all my Sisters, I am the rightful Queen! This one is blind, this deaf, and that other is but a mute; This one is fair indeed, but drunken and dissolute; This is a very slave, dishonourèd long ago; This one is dying of age, that other of want and woe; This one is proud and great, but a heathen in her soul, And subject to fatal frenzies, raging beyond control: But I, I am rich and strong, I am wise and good and free; Thronèd above them, Empress sole of the earth-surrounding Sea!’ “Yes, indeed thy power is great, but thy evil is great no less, And thy wealth is poor to pay the debt of thy guiltiness; And the world is judged with justice, and thou must pass through that fire Which hath tested so sternly the glitter of Venice and Carthage and Tyre: For no wealth can bribe away the doom of the Living God, No haughtiest strength confront the sway of His chastening rod. Repent, reform, or perish! the Ages cry unto thee: Listen, oh listen, ere yet it be late, thou swarthy Queen of the Sea! “Thy heritage vast and rich is ample to clothe and feed The whole of thy millions of children beyond all real need; One of the two main wheels whereon thy Faith doth move Is that each as he loves himself so shall he his neighbour love: But thy chief social laws seem strictly framed to secure That one be corruptingly rich, another bitterly poor, And another just starving to death: thy fanes and mansions proud Are beleaguered with filthy hovels wherein poor wretches crowd, Pining in body and soul; untaught, unfed by those Who are good if they merely dribble bland alms upon fatal woes— Resigning scarcely aught of their pleasure and pride and content, Nor dreaming that all their life is one huge embezzlement. “The sumptuous web of thy trade encompassing all the globe Is fretted by gambling greed like a moth-eaten robe, Is slimed by creeping fraud, is poisoned by falsehood's breath, Is less a garment of life than a shroud of rotting death. “The mass of thy rulers live with scarcely one noble aim, Scarcely one clear desire for a not inglorious fame; Slaves to a prudence base, idolaters unto Might, Jailors of lofty zeal, infidels to pure Right, Deaf to the holy voice of the Conscience of the World, Blind to the banner of God when it floats in the storm unfurled; They, and with them the array of thine actual Priesthood, thy proud And numberless Father-confessors—ineffable crowd Of scribes who by day and by night, unceasingly blatant, dictate Thine every move in the contest with Time the Servant of Fate. “Thy flaring streets each night affront the patient skies With an holocaust of woes, sins, lusts and blasphemies; When thy thousands of harlots abroad with the other thousand are met Of those who made them first and who keep them harlots yet: So dreadful, that thou thyself must sometimes look for the fire That rained from heaven on Sodom to make thee one funeral pyre. “Thy Church has long been becoming the Fossil of a Faith; The Form of dry bones thou hast, but where are the blood and breath? Dry bones, that seem a whole, with dead sinews binding the parts, Inert save when bejuggled to ghastly galvanic starts: Though thou swearest to thy people, ‘The King is but sick, not dead’— Gaining the time while you choose you another in His stead; Though thy scribes and thy placemen all; most of whom know the fact, Vouchsafe in His name to write, pretend by His will to act: Where are the signs of His life?—While living He never ceased To thrill with the breath of His being thy realm from the West to the East; While He lived He fought with sin, with fleshly lust and pride; While He lived His poor and mean were wealthy and dignified; While He lived His reign was freedom, faith, chastity, peace and love; And the symbol borne on his banner was not the raven but dove; While He lived there yawned a Hell with a Devil for His foes, And a God-ruled Heaven of triumph before His followers rose; While He lived the noblest of men were wholly devoted to Him, The saints, the bards, the heroes, in soul and mind and limb,— Who now without a Leader, mournful in silence wait, Girding each one himself to his lonely fight with Fate. “But thou, O Queen, art false: a liar, if He is dead And becoming a mammoth fossil whose æon is wholly sped; A traitor if still He lives and shall for ever reign, For thou spurnest the laws most sacred of all He doth ordain, Should Christ come now from Heaven, to reap the harvest sown When He buried Himself in the earth, watered with blood of His own, How many Christians indeed could He gather with strictest care From thy two hundred myriads who claim in Him a share? He agonisèd to save thee and thy children all; And He saveth scarcely enough to delay thy deadly fall. “For fall thou wilt, thou must—so proud as thy state is now, Thou and thy sisters all, scarce better or worse than thou, If ye do not all repent, and cleanse each one her heart From the foulness circling with its blood to poison every part. Woe to thy pampered rich in their arrogant selfishness; Woe to thy brutelike poor who feel but their bread-distress; Woe to thy people who dare not live without hope of wealth, Who look but to fruits of the earth for their life and saving health; Woe to thy rulers who rule for the good of themselves alone, Fathers who give their children crying for bread a stone; Woe to thy mighty men whose strength is unused or sold; Thy sages who shut their eyes when Truth is stern to behold; Woe to thy prophets who smile Peace, Peace, when it is a sword; Thy poets who sing their own lusts instead of hymns of the Lord; Thy preachers who preach the life of what they feel to be death; Thy sophists who sail wild seas without the compass of faith; Thy traders trading in lies and in human bodies and souls; Thy good men cursing those better who strive on to loftier goals:— The final Doom evolveth, burdened with woe on woe, Sure as the justice of God while yet by His patience slow; For the earth is pervaded wholly, through densest stone and clod, With the burning fire of the law of the Truth of the Living God; Consuming the falsehood, the evil, the pride, the lust, the shame, With ever-burning, unrelenting, irresistible flame; Until all save the purest spirit, eternal, of truth and love, Be altogether consumed away, beneath as well as above.” 1857. RONALD AND HELEN Part I. Most bright and genial noon of Christmas Day! The pale blue sky is cloudless, and the sun A white intensity of light whose ray Is gladness unto all it shines upon: Blue-green and foamless swells the tide-filled bay; The remnant morning-mist still hovers dun Above St. Aubin's shore, and through its veil The white-walled houses gleam now tawny-pale. High on a brig's foremast a boy is singing In proud supremacy o'er dread and care, His arms in time with his free music swinging: How through the ocean of crystalline air That young and swift and joyous voice comes ringing, Like birdnotes through the summer greenwoods fair! What is his Christmas Carol?—The refrain Is “Gra machree ma cruiskeen;” noble strain! I lay abed this morning half-asleep And half-awake, in drowsy warmth and rest; While tender memories, such as smile and weep Over Life's faded flowers in every breast, And visionary thoughts, that sometimes steep (As sunset-glories steep the greying west) Life's mournful hours in lucent heavenly balm, Came floating at their pleasure through my calm. And thus at length, amidst the shadowy train, A little poem, like a song-bird sweet, First nestled in my heart, then in my brain, And now exultant with the genial heat Lets loose upon the air its simple strain: Perchance some gentle hearts whose pulses beat With Love's full symphonies in tremulous chime, Will welcome his least minion's rustic rhyme. It is not cold bleak winter any more; It is the noon of summer; and the isle Of Cæsaræan Jersey to its core Is drunken with the Sun's unclouded smile: The sea is steadfast as the glittering shore; We think such water never can beguile Fair boats, rich barques, brave men, to wreck and death, As now it lies unwrinkled by a breath. She sitteth at the window, lone, alone; Outgazing far across the lustrous bay, And through the heavens beneath the sun's high throne; For all her thoughts are wandering far away About the regions of some Southern zone, As they have wandered many and many a day, Like poor, forlorn, tired, faithful carrier-doves With urgent messages for him she loves. Alas, they cannot come upon his track, They know not where he wanders or reclines. O India, if you hold him send him back, More precious than all jewels of your mines! O dreadful Sea, if he has gone to wrack Amidst thy wrath, vouchsafe a few sad lines To give her such assurance of his doom That she may go unlingering to the tomb! Never a single note of him to speak, Never a single word by any ship! A hectic fire surmounts her pallid cheek, A peevish trouble agitates her lip; Through her impatient fingers wan and weak The torn-off petals of the white rose slip; Lividly set, her eyes burn large and bright, But with a painful sleepless desolate light. She often mutters to her own sick heart; She often mutters to herself alone, She often turns her with a sudden start, To find herself too surely all alone: Anon for weary sighs her pale lips part, Anon she singeth in a dreamy moan A song whose burden plains throughout the air The heavy burden of a life's despair:— “Adieu, adieu, my ain true Love, We must for ever part: Though I am not of Douglas sib, I bear the bleeding heart, My dear, I bear the bleeding heart!” “From all the farthest quarters of the world The level snowdrifts of white letters come; With all the steam-cars o'er the safe land hurled, With all the ships athwart the wild sea-foam, Till every happy wreath at length unfurled Melts in the warmth of loving hearts at home: And never one white flake to me addrest, To cool the burning fever of my breast! “O Sun, thou large and lidless eye of fire, My soul is withered in thy steadfast gaze; O hot and heavy air I must respire, No secret spring this fever-thirst allays; O cruel Sea, enmasking thy fierce ire With rippling smiles carest by golden rays: I would that I were buried cool and deep From this world-furnace in unwaking sleep! “I dreamed a dream of superhuman bliss, And it has vanished in the day's broad glare; I breathed my soul forth in one rapturous kiss, And it has died out in the vacant air; I stretched unheedful o'er a precipice To pluck Life's crowning Love-rose,—Oh, how fair!— And, all its fragrant beauty unenjoyed, I plunge down shuddering through the gulfy void. “O Ronald, Ronald, wheresoe'er you be: Whether lone-sleeping in an alien tomb, Or overswept by the remorseless sea, Or languid in the richest Orient's bloom Breathing delicious life; I summon thee! In body or in soul, whate'er your doom, Come hither; but one moment; so that I With consecration of your love may die! “Perchance some Indian witch hath snared your heart With fiery philtres and enwoven wiles Some swarthy Cleopatra, with the art To melt strong manhood in her tears and smiles: The one priceless pearl Cleopatra dissolved and drank in the wine of her love was the noble manhood of Antony. I see you there, all powerless to depart, The more her slave the more you learn her guiles; Draining the wine of that voluptuous sin Which Heaven and Earth seem both well lost to win. “Break through her spells, my beautiful, my brave! Shake off thy swoon, stand up, and come away! Submit no more to be her doting slave, Embruted while you grovel in her sway!— Alas, alas, how misery will rave! Thou art my own true love; thou art the prey Of no fierce lusts, thou, pure and strong and free, But of the wild waste all-devouring sea. “The fair white signal-pennon droopeth down Against its flagstaff on the fortress high; The solid serpent-smoke is trailing brown A lazy bulk between the sea and sky: How many hearts throughout the busy town Foresee dear friends or friendly greetings nigh! The flag of truce stills none of all my pains, The serpent's venom burns through all my veins. “Yet it is hard, O God, to die so soon, To feel my life decay before its prime; To perish in May-frosts when sumptuous June Is bringing Eden-airs to bless the clime; To have my day eclipsed before its noon; To sleep a widow ere the wedding-time, Down in the cold dark Earth—there truly wed, For Death the Skeleton will share my bed.” Then all the memories of her happy hours, Her girlish hours of hope and health and glee, And love a-budding like the other flowers When April whispers of the June to be; Of moonlit waters and of sunny bowers Ere one went forth upon the desert sea; Swelled in her heart and filled her eyes, and bore Out through her lips their passionate Nevermore!:— “O thou happy, happy Island-home, So rich and green and fair, Which I and my true-love used to roam Without a thought of care. O thou many-peopled busy town Upon the broad bay's marge; Into whose full life we went down And felt our life as large. O the ringing of the hammers on the building ships, And the bustle of the pier, With the gleaming eyes and the trembling lips And the last embraces dear. O the mile-long sweep of the full tide swell Far up the soft white sand; O the flashing of the foam when it scales so well The rocks of the Castle grand. O the flutter of the flakes in the broad bay mouth, Like myriads of sea-birds white; O the gliding of the sails in the hazy south, Like spirits calm and bright. O the wondrous mists that enchant the whole, And make it what they please,— A faërie realm for the dreaming soul, Or a wreck beneath dull seas. O the banks of the golden gorse and broom, And the lanes that wind like a burn, With the soft snowflakes of the apple-bloom Shed thick on their hedgerow fern. O the slant-stemmed orchards, ripe and old, When the rich fruits everywhere, Like flames of ruby and globes of gold, Burn in the quivering air. O the sleek and tethered kine that graze The valley-bottoms sweet, And look up with such long, slow, patient gaze As you pass with lingering feet. O the singing of the larks in the fields of air Above the fields of grain, When the sky is blue and the clouds are rare, And the hedges laugh with rain. Can it indeed, then, can it be, That I so young in years Must fade from the land and the air and the sea And the heaven of shining spheres? Must fade away to a joyless ghost, Or moulder in the earth, While all the world and the starry host Live on in their glorious mirth? From all the life and the beauty part Without one loving tear Of those eyes that lit the flame in my heart, That burns my life out here? O Father, Father, I beseech Before I go but this,— To see his face, to hear his speech, To feel his fervent kiss! When he again has sworn the vow Which long ago he swore— ‘My Love, I loved you, love you now, And must love evermore!’: Then I can breathe my latest breath, And feel Thy will be done! Assured that in the after-death We ever shall be one.” Part II. The same hushed vault of dim blue marble sky, All over-wandered with its thin white veins; The same fixed marble sea whose blue-green dye Brown sunken rocks enrich with purple stains: For still the same despotic sun on high In haughty splendour bare and beamless reigns; The earth beneath his too impassioned love Is Semele embraced with fire by Jove. What royal vision issues calm and free, Making the isle at once her beauty's throne?— For all the sphere of earth and sky and sea Pavilions not too grandly her alone. Can this erect and glorious woman be The pining girl whose weary heartsick moan Fretted the long still hours of yesterday? Can that rich life have ever known decay? With what pure bloom and firm elastic grace She glides among the flowers, a flower more fair; With what undazzled eyes and dew-fresh face She fronts the South in all its quivering glare; Her arms stretched forth as if to the embrace Of some Olympian lover burning there; Her lips just parted, and her bosom's breath Suspended in the bliss as calm as death. Her mother follows her, a matron mild, Now panting with astonishment and fear: “My poor, poor Helen! my unhappy child! What change is this, what madness brings you here? . . . She heeds me not . . . her look is fixed and wild . . . It is your mother speaking to you, dear! O God! what terrors hast Thou still in store?— She does not know her anguish any more!” The cry has troubled her serenest trance; She turns, and with reluctant effort slow Draws back her spirit from the bright expanse To comprehend her mother's clamorous woe; And then with such a strange, calm, pitying glance As angels on our sufferings may bestow, Bends down to kiss her: “Mother, sweet and kind, God has at length restored me my right mind. Last night I laid a wild, wild burning head Upon the pillow whence this morn arose A sweet cool shrine of happy thoughts instead: If I had slept death's slumber from my woes, A shroud my sheet, a narrow grave my bed (How often have I yearned for such repose!), And risen to the Heavenly Life, the change Could scarcely be more glorious and strange. Whether in sleep or not I cannot tell— Ah, life was all one restless dream insane!— A casual thought like some wind-seedling fell, And struck firm root within my infirm brain, And drew up all my soul as by a spell To feed its strength (and all my soul was fain), And grew up an oracular vast tree Whose leaves all murmured, Oh, the sea! the sea! Till I felt stifled in my little room And could not rest for irresistible yearning; But like a ghost that leaves its midnight tomb, Went forth and hurried forward without turning Over the hill-paths chequered gleam and gloom, And down the snow-white sand, to bathe my burning Tumultuous forehead deep in the divine, Calm cool refreshment of the deep-sea-brine. The sands late flooded by the sounding tide Wore luminous silver spoil of its retreat; But till I felt the glassy waters slide With thin spent whispers round my naked feet (The gathering volume of the next wave wide Nearing me fast with murmur full and sweet), I could not raise my eyes to see indeed Being intent alone on my great need. I looked, I stood: there never was a night Of such heart-breaking beauty for despair! Our world's one darling and supreme delight, Golden Beatitude! the moon couched there 'Midst golden-tissued cloudlets; and her bright Serene regard entranced the breathless air, And dazzled her old slave, the fawning sea: Oh, how the cruel splendour maddened me! Why linger here, where tireless ripples run Enraptured in the glory of her gaze? All lightsome creatures my dark sorrow shun, No fiery wine a fiery thirst allays. But I must reach those low rock-ridges dun, Where wrinkled shadows bar the silver rays; There shall I find some deep dark silent pool, Dark as oblivion, deep as death, grave-cool. So I walked forth along the pathway paved With tremulous lustre; and no thought of fear Or wonder told me of the peril braved: And though the light transfixed me like a spear, Yet o'er that sea of crystal, many-waved, To walk right on into the magic sphere Of that low gorgeous moon, was such a dream As made the pang a too sharp rapture seem. I reached the ridge; and as by instinct went, Eyeless with dreaming, to the dear old place;— A pebbled floor with small bright shells besprent, A pool at lowest ebb when not a trace Of moisture in hot noons is elsewhere lent To those black calcined rocks that need the grace Of living waters round them, and instead Have white sand-powder thick with worm coils spread. Here on this sloping ledge we sat alone That last sad day, and let the long hours swim Unheeded over us; and like a moan From far away each voice gasped strange and dim; His eyes were blank, his face was set like stone. What now is left me of the place and him? A book of lovely, delicate, sanguine weeds, A heart of thoughts whose every fibre bleeds. ‘Here let me lie; the shadow is so deep, The little water is so cold and pure— A font baptizing me to blessèd sleep; To slumber which for ever shall endure, Being o'ershrouded by the refluent sweep Of the great tide; or else whose balm will cure My soul to fitness for this world of life: Mysterious prescience soothes my inward strife! So first I knelt to dip my weary head, And then lay down as if the hollow were My natural resting-place, my nightly bed; And weedlike on the water streamed my hair. Then a strange peace was on my spirit shed; Beyond inert unconsciousness of care: I felt the world's smooth, silent, solemn wheeling; A mystic, restful, and triumphant feeling. ‘The burning golden Rose of the Day Droops down to the Western Sea; And the amber and purple flush of the sky, And the crimson glow of the sea, Ebb, ebb away; fade, fade and die; While the Earth all mantled in shadowy grey Washes her brow with a restful sigh In the cool sweet dews of the gloaming. ‘Then the shining silver Lily of the Night Opens broad her leaves divine, Afloat on the azure hyaline Of the heavenly sea; and her purest light Kisses the Earth that dreaming lies In a still enchanted sleeping; While the heavens with their countless starry eyes Still watch are keeping. ‘The Earth loves the golden Rose of the Day From which she distils the fiery wine Of immortal youth and magnificent might; But the Sea loves the silver Lily of the Night, For her beams are as wands of a holier sway Whose spell brings the trance divine: The Rose for Life's feast and the festal array, The Lily for Death's shrine.’ Who was the singer, singing thus alone Amidst the tidal rocks, beneath the moon? What gave his voice that mighty murmurous tone? Where had he learned that preternatural tune?— Melting all melody into a moan Of infinite yearning, then from music's swoon Striding to marshal armies of proud sound Whose trampling shook the earth and filled the air around. I rose, but gently, gently, not to spill A single drop of that enchanted wine Brimming my soul; and crept to where a sill, Backed by dark rock from all the gleam and shine, Served as a window; and there settled still, And gazed—if one indeed can gaze whose eyne Are fixed in blank dilation, while her ears Drink in oracular rhythms from all the spheres. Yet in my round of vision, very near He sat, and merged in my unconscious sight To union with his music in the clear Tropical splendour of the liquid light: An old, old man, reverend yet not austere, Who on a lower rock-ledge sat upright Fronting the moon, and chanting for her grace, While all his soul shone steadfast in his face. ‘The Earth lay breathless in a fever-swoon Beneath the burning noon, Sun-stricken, dazed with light and sick with heat; Then came the waters from the cool mid-sea Trooping up blithe and free, And fanned her brow with airs so fresh and sweet; And crept about her gently and caressed Her broad unheaving breast With the white cincture of a magic zone; Bathing and swathing her faint limbs, that were In the fierce sunfire bare, With lucid liquid folds of rich green purple-strown. ‘Then as the sun went floating to his rest Down the enamoured West, The waves were leaving the calm earth to dreams; Bearing the smirch of her long day's turmoil, The sweat of her fierce toil, The sultry breaths and feverous steams,— Bearing all far away, and as they went Whispering with blithe content, To drown and cleanse them in the pure midsea; The while the Earth all dewy sweet and clean, And drowsily serene, Beneath the star-dewed heavens might slumber safe and free.’ His foam-white hair and beard fell floating down In flowing curves like tendril-plants sea-swayed, Over his sea-like green-blue silken gown, Ample, of ever-shifting gleam and shade. Upon his knees the mighty hands dark-brown Grasped a great chorded shell, whose sleek lips played Wild freaks of rainbow lightnings to illume The gorgeous thunders of its hollow womb. Why speak of hair, harp, hands, when in his eyes The wonder dwelt? A small intense lone mere, Which under thick tree-shadows airless lies, As deep and blackly splendid may appear As if the whole night gloom beneath the skies Were concentrated in its narrow sphere: Such were those orbs, those well-shafts of black splendour, Through which a soul gazed, solemn, powerful, tender. Deep wells lead down to all-mysterious death, Deep eyes lead down to a mysterious soul, And both thrill fascination; but who saith What lures us on to plunge for either goal? I dared not stir or speak, and yet my breath Hysterically bursting from control Cried through his chanting in a plaint forlorn, Learnt by the sea-beach one drear winter morn: ‘Leafless and brown are the trees, And the wild waste rocks are brown Which the wan green sea so stealthily Comes creeping up to drown; And the north-west breeze blows chill, And the sky is cold and pale; And nevermore from this desolate shore Shall I watch my true-love's sail.’ As if indeed, omnisciently aware, He had been calmly waiting all the while My own announcement of my presence there, He turned his glance with an assuring smile, And said, ‘So young, and singing of despair!— What tyranny of fate, what human guile, Or what mere folly of your own weak heart, Makes you bewail an ever-cureless smart? ‘My poor Child! come and tell me all your woe; And I perchance may find some healing balm: Howe'er the billows rage and tempests blow, The sea's deep heart lies brooding ever calm: Wild waste above may have pure peace below.’ . . . I knelt there at his feet and felt his palm— Palm of a mighty hand—caress my hair, As erst the harpstrings, with fine tender care. And I could tell him all my woe and pain, As scarcely I could tell you, mother dear; All the wild dreams that haunted my vexed brain, All the sharp agonies of doubt and fear, All the despair of longings ever vain: And as I poured them forth into his ear I felt they never could return to me, But were as torrents drowned in the great sea. His hand was a strong blessing on my head; His eyes drew out the fever from my soul, And filled it all with cool sweet light instead, And held me calm in their supreme control By some high magic free from awe and dread, A spiritual charm; and when the whole Of my sad tale was sobbed forth, I felt sure, Before he named a remedy, of cure. Thoughtfully, father-tenderly he smiled, And held a moonlike jewel out to me: ‘This crystal-clear and hollow gem, my Child, Contains one pure drop from the deep midsea; And all the ocean-volumes calm or wild In all their depth and power and mystery, Clothing the round world with a living robe, Are represented in its little globe. ‘Take it, and seek in it with trustful care, Turning it slowly; and if He you mourn, Lord of your life and death, is anywhere Within the sea's dominions—whether borne Upon its bosom breathing happy air, Or buried in its depth a corpse forlorn— The blank will stir and breathe until you find His image in its magic sphere enshrined.’ I took it, full of faith; but could not see At first,—my hand so trembled, and my eyes Were clouded with such rushing mystery From my heart's fiery throbbing. But his wise Serene regard, steadfastly holding me, Soothed and restored; as tender moonlight lies In beautiful calm upon the ocean's breast, Enchanting into peace its great unrest. Upon my open palm the jewel gleamed, Faint, semi-lucid, almost colourless: I gazed, gazed, turning slowly, till it seemed Expanding by soft pulses in the stress Of my persistent gaze, whose full light streamed Triumphant with prophetic consciousness; Pulse after pulse, wave after wave, poured still From eyes protending with imperious will. A golden star is kindled at its core, The spherelet fills with the dissolving light; Gather and shift and vanish shadows hoar: It is pervaded with miraculous might, Swelling in musical triumph more and more: Behold! within and yet beyond our night Another heaven, another sea unfurled, Another vast horizon of our world! A vault of sky; the wan moon near its crest Fades from those fiery armies of the dawn, Whose van is up with golden spears in rest: A plane of sea as level as a lawn, But sapphire-blue; upon the far north-west A low grey land-cloud delicately drawn; And in the centre of the faërie sphere A single ship: all steadfast, solemn, clear! A lonely ship; through the crystalline air I see it as beneath a microscope We see an insect, every scale and hair; I hear its panting, and the plash aslope Its prow of languid wavelets green:—and there!— Oh, heart be firm, or this fierce shock of Hope Leaping up Bliss, will slay us!—Who is He Yearning across the ocean-leagues to me! Hush, hush; he murmurs . . . How dark-bronzed and brown The face that was so ruddy! Noble face, With lordly lion-locks for golden crown!— As pious Moslems in whatever place Turn always Meccaward when kneeling down For adoration of the Throne of Grace, He has turned hither, praying steadfast-eyed, Leaning impassioned o'er the vessel's side. Listen! ‘O Helen, this mysterious chain Which links us heart to heart, gives mine no rest, Dragging with such persistent cruel strain As if to tear it bleeding from my breast. From utmost India, over land and main, It draws me wild with longing to the West: What crushing grief, what bitter worldly strife, Or inward agony, exhausts your life? ‘I come, I come, Belovèd! tender heart Swooning transfixed! no wonder mine must bleed, Pierced by our sympathy with the same dart. I come, I come, to stay you in your need, And nevermore in life shall we two part! . . . Lo, with what beautiful and tranquil speed The morning drowns the gloom and fires the grey, And breathes triumphantly night's fears away!’ Oh, murmur sweeter than the sweetest psalm On Sabbath eve in Summer, through the air Floating with outspread wings that rain pure balm On who may through some quiet valley fare!— How picture-motionless, how crystal-calm And crystal-lucid, sea and sky spread there, Ringed by the far horizon's perfect ring; That lonely ship the only human thing! I could not dare to break the magic peace By crying ev'n to him, my Love so near; But gazed and listened: then a milk-white fleece Fell in vast volumes through the æther clear, And surged in violent growth and swift decrease; Whereon the suddenly thus-muffled sphere Span round, all ruining in with hollow roar. I cannot, though I try, remember more. Something there was: that old Sea-god benign, Glaucus the wonderful, to whom I raise Within my heart a rich and secret shrine For floral gratitude and incense-praise; Glaucus, and Ronald, and dear mother mine Yourself, seen flitting all before my gaze In glimmering dusk; strange music stirs sweet bowers: The rest has fled with the swift-flying hours. With the swift flying hours that bring to me My Love, my Own, my Beautiful, my Brave! Swift may their flight sweep over the broad sea, Soft fall their shadow on the halcyon wave! The hours are Seraphs bright with holy glee, Whom I thought sombre bearers to the grave! There is no grave, no death, no gloom of night; The World all overflows with God's pure light.” Part III. Nature had roused herself from that still trance, Her long siesta in the noon o' the year; Vast clouds had gathered in the dim expanse, High gales had swept the brooding atmosphere, With thunders and broad lightnings, with the dance Of joyous rain upon the meadows sere, And trees tumultuous as a roaring tide, And wan green bay and livid offing wide. And now a morning of delicious breath, A clear-skied morning full of hope, whose life Has no remembrance of past gloom and death, Whose peace abjures its birth in stormy strife, Welcomes the Wanderer as he entereth That noble bay-mouth which for him is rife With all the golden treasures of rich youth And perfect love, safesealed by perfect truth. The pathos of dear Memory's best delight Had filled his eyes with tender tears before, As they came pulsing in the early light, Sole on the waves, aslant the happy shore; And all the sister islets full in sight Unshrouding from their mist-veils thin and hoar Gleamed faintly blue: but now his soul was thrilled With fearless triumph of life's end fulfilled. “O fair green Isle, my Love's delightful nest, Deep in this silver branch of the great sea! Watched by the royal Lion of the West, Safe from the Eagle, ‘oure sweete enemie’: Look,—as a Lion couched in haughty rest, Slumbrous but watchful for emergency, Guarding a monarch's threshold night and day, Thy Castle lies out massive in thy bay. “Nest of my Love! the cradles of our birth Were rocked to mightier airs than thou hast known; Wild winds that raved round hills of gloomy dearth, And overswept vast heathery moorlands lone, And swayed deep solemn lochs as if old earth Were yawning into ruin: every tone Of those sublimest anthems swells once more Within me, O our stern dear Mother-shore! “But youth and youth's Love-Eden, rich and fair As that first Eden which the Lord God planted; Wherein we wandered sole as the first pair, And with the same divine new bliss enchanted; Are linked with thee for ever, everywhere, Sweet islet of the West, whose cool gleams haunted The burning splendours of the oldest East Shaming the wine of its voluptuous feast. “Wine of the East! not wine, but poison, call That flood of fire which through the parched frame rolls; ‘Thou art the wine whose drunkenness is all We can desire, O Love! and happy souls, Ere from thy vine the leaves of Autumn fall, Catch thee and feed from their o'erflowing bowls Thousands who thirst for thy ambrosial dew:’ The thousands thirst; the happy souls how few! “Thus chants the glorious Seraph?—And this wine Brimming a golden cup was at my lips; Yet I could put away the draught divine After the first short, trembling, rapturous sips, And leave the great Olympian revel-shine And downward fare into the earth-eclipse: And after long long years when I return, Still my wine waits me, still the star-lamps burn! “Because the Banquet of the Gods doth last For ever and for ever, day and night! Because their wine when years on years have passed Is fresh as at that instant when its light Streamed like a ruby chainlet holding fast The golden cup to Hebe's wrist curved white; Because his place who once hath sat there blest Is never taken by another guest. “And I did well, and I did well O Love, To love yet leave; do well to now return! How should a boy with great gods feast, and prove The nectar's inmost potency, discern Its subtlest fragrance, feel its ardours move Thrilling in slow rich growth until they burn Through all the being in a still desire And pure white flame of unconsuming fire? “The boy was all too weak: one full-breathed draught Had been intoxication; then dull swoon Had drowned remembrance of the nectar quaffed, Or left him sated who had dared too soon; While all the ever-glad Immortals laughed To see so misapplied their crowning boon: But I come back from years of toil and strife Strong and mature to claim my Feast of Life.” Whereon he shook himself erect, to feel The rich blood mantling through his stalwart frame, A fervent wine of life from brow to heel; And all his spirit like a pointed flame Burned out intensely pereceant as the steel Flashed from its scabbard at a hero's name,— Burned glittering from his eyes, and darted keen Swift herald fire-thrills to his Love unseen. He stamped, “But, O my steamer, how you crawl! I would your horse-power were a horse indeed, Thin-flanked and spur-able! Good hap befall This cautious steering, friends; but where's the need When thick surf escalades the pier-head wall? High tide—the sun mounts high—Oh speed, speed, speed!” Half hummed half sang he mellowly and low, A bathing snatch of mornings long ago. “O sun, lay down thy golden bridge, Across the waters clear! O foam flash round each rock and ridge That soon shall disappear! O tide, swell up a full spring-tide Upon the shingly shore! For, oh, I love thy surge-sweep wide And long-resounding roar!” Early she sat; not restless, but in awe Trembling at intervals with rhythms of fear; As from the leafy window-seat she saw The vessel freighted with life's bliss appear, And slowly to the hidden harbour draw Over the joyous waters blue and clear: When still the ship was but a shapeless speck Her true eye fixed Him lordly on the deck. The mist dissolving in the morning glow Still faintly streaked the blue abyss of air, And left a purple tinge on all below: The well-loved scene looked strange and still and fair, As some grand picture painted long-ago, Now for the first time brought before her there; Or some dear dream of childhood now once more Come back as wonderful as heretofore. If ever she relaxed her vision strong Which thus had drawn him from the unknown climes, It was to read again with kisses long A letter she had read a hundred times, And still found always new,—like some old song, Some old sweet song of simple passionate rhymes, And more than mortal tenderness—a lay Fit for a wedding and a dying day. “Has the old writing startled you, my dear?— Old schemes expanding, new ones striking root, Threatened to keep me tending year by year; Still as I gathered in one crop of fruit Finding another ripe,—with long arrear Of fresh plantations blossoming to boot: So wealth grew great, and great wealth's care and toil; But what became of love in all the coil? “Stunned, snared, deep-smitten!—so my heart cried out, With passionate scorn, imperative demands, And blood-dark proofs convicting murderous doubt. My lonely hours became as desert lands When hot simoon glares purple through the rout Where whirl the columns of the billowy sands: I felt that I must leave; yet how arrange That work should live and grow despite the change? “One night the glowing stars and golden moon, The perfect fruit of heaven, hung down so bright In their unwasting beauty, that a swoon Of pure love-longing and divine delight Melted me wholly—‘Thou consummate boon, Crown of the fruitage of the Tree of Night, Fringing cloud-leaves with splendid spray, and through The quiet air distilling nectar-dew: “Some swift hours hence my Love's own islet green Comes floating under the enormous shade; Oh, when she looks to thee, thou heavenly queen, Do thou shed blessings down on her!’ I prayed; ‘Fill her with shining hope and joy serene, Tell her,—He cometh now, no more delayed! This message bear, thou white and golden dove, Thou light of lovers whom all lovers love!’ “I heard you then cry, Ronald, come to me! As plainly as I ever heard you speak When we together sat, and I might see The glorious eyeglow pale the flushing cheek, The curved lips falter into utterance free, And feel the moist hand quiver strongly weak; I heard your clear voice ringing through the air, I felt you straining at my heart-strings there. “Whereon I forthwith registered a vow,— There was such anguish in the bell-sweet tone— To write no single line more, to allow My throbbing heart no language of its own, Till I could date from—where I date from now, Here, on our England's ever-green sea-throne: This vow made short sharp work of all that stood Between me and departure, bad or good. “I started, I am here: what voyage was mine, All my long Odyssey (without the zest Of lotus, or Calypso more divine), Until I passed the Pillars of the West, Spare now from scripture's ink for speech's wine: When one has reached the Islands of the Blest, The perils and the storms he came through seem Dim fragments of an interrupted dream. “Two days for London, or at longest three; I dare not come to you first, knowing well That when you once have laid soft hands on me I shall be impotent to break your spell: Meanwhile for some few hours more I am free, And ere they ring my this life's passing-bell Would wind up business with the world in peace; We make our wills just as our wills must cease. “But lest you wonder how I dare assume That my mad silence pregnant with dismay Has not already scared you to the tomb, Read this: you tortured me the whole sad way To Malta, pallid phantoms stern as Doom; But in the dawning of the perfect day That brought us to Valetta, you came forth An Angel of glad tidings from the North.” A telegraphic note had followed this, “I come on by the next Southampton mail:” Therefore she read and dreamed in solemn bliss, Watching the slow hours through, from when the veil Of misty darkness on the deep abyss Trembled and opened to the dawnlight pale: And now and then throughout the vigil long She murmured dreamily a little song:— “A fuchsia lay on the sodden mould; I stooped, and held it up To the morning sun, and a wine of gold Seethed in its purple cup: A lucid, lucid golden wine— The dewy bloom of the flower By the joyous beams of the morning shine Transfused with mystic power. “My heart was lying on a grave; I dared to hold it up To the Sun of Heaven, and a glorious wave Swelled in its purple cup: A glowing golden wine of love,— My heart's best blood in the kiss Of the living light of the Sun above Burning to perfect bliss.” Part IV. The quiet evening of that day of days Held the two lovers walking side by side, As slowly as a summer cloudlet strays From noon to eve across the heavens wide, Or distant barque whereat full long we gaze Ere sure its snowy pinions really glide: They paused and loitered in such indolence Of perfect Joy's eternal present tense. For perfect Joy would hardly care to baulk Poor perfect Sadness in her logical fit: “Better to walk than run, to stand than walk, To sit than stand, to lie down than to sit; And better than to lie awake and talk Or think, to lie in dreamless sleep; and it Is better to lie dead than lie asleep; Which better is the best we mortals reap.” Three hours of this world's time—such hours as make A heavenly life-time each—they lingered through The valley winding out to Grève de Lecq, Before the placid waters met their view; And much they spoke, yet speech would often slake To let the grander harmonies ensue Of Silence—great dumb Poet, overfraught With utterless passion and ineffable thought. As they turned up the highway, to ascend A narrow path amidst the golden gorse, A soldier brought his cane down on his friend With hearty comradeship's most heavy force, “Hammer my eyes, Bill! why don't you attend? There is a chest for the Victorier Crorss! That pair's the finest pair I ever see In this 'ere isle of poisoned ho-devee.” The speaker spoke more loudly than he meant (Enough of drink will make a whisper shout, As too much makes a shout of bold intent Huskily whisper); those he pointed out Thus heard quite well the sudden compliment. She drew herself up with a pretty pout, Arching her neck with grace superbly free; While his strong eyes laughed with a world of glee. “Your soldier is a judge; he knows a man, And eke a woman, tho' he loves his beer; I've fought a little in my time, and can Be proud to bend thus an old ramrod, dear: Old ladies, too, with awesome sharpness scan: And even as I leapt upon the pier, A jolly dame with marvellous cap snow-white Burst out Quel homme! in very frank delight. “Learn what a peerless prize you come to gain, Know what a god is prostrate at your feet!” “You big bad boy, come back to me as vain As ever! If some giant would but beat The boasting out of you!—I'll shear this mane Flung haughtily to every wind we meet, All the thick lionlocks of tawny hair Wherein your turbulent strength may have its lair!” “And who, of all men in the whole world wide, Crowned with the consecration of your kiss, Would not exult and overflow with pride Unmeasured as the ocean of his bliss? What dullest Apis ever deified? What Bottom in rare metamorphosis, Titania's flower-sweet hands like soft white doves Hovering round Donkey-head with delicate loves? “Yes, I am vain, all-happy and all-vain; As peacock when full noon lights up the eyes Emerald and amethyst that star his train, Dazzling the sober splendour of the skies; As whidah-bird in his new love's first gain, When he would front an eagle for the prize, And all his rapturous vanity unreprest Leaps like a fountain in the monstrous crest. “If I can bring my Love great store of wealth, Good—tho' all gold is dross beside my Love; If I can bring her beauty, vigour, health, Good—tho' her worth is all world's grace above: And shall I bring her these good things by stealth, As if ashamed my worship thus to prove? Not so; my life's best incense shall aspire Upon the hilltop in a flaming fire.” They sat them down where they could look abroad Through the sweet gloaming o'er the dim sea-space; And long they sat in silence hushed and awed, The while she nestled close in his embrace. Surely they felt the very breath of God Leaning down softly from the Heavenly place, Even as a mother leans with yearnings deep To watch her infant sink in happy sleep. At length she whispers in soft little gasps Of slender tremulous shadowy distant sound; Fearing to break the silence that enclasps With infinite love and peace the world around; Yet fearing more the silence, through which grasps Too powerfully her soul all tranced and bound His conquering soul imperious: and her will Spends its last free pulsation in the thrill. (All silently the lily's globe of dew Is drunk up by the great sun's hot desire; The burning cloudlet in the burning blue Is still as death, and overfraught with fire Dissolveth ever upward through and through Successive heavens, and would aspire—expire: It has condensed to cold and dark again Ere it showers earthward in wide-whispering rain.) “Are we in Heaven? or are we still on earth? Is this indeed Eternity or Time? . . . Oh, Love, the foretaste of another birth, Another life from blossoming to prime, That showed our richest foison arid dearth, Our tropic summer a dark polar clime, Was given me in an ecstasy of fear; How deep our roots cling to the Now and Here! “And this is Earth; and in the glass run by The sands that surely then for ages stood, As all the stars stood steadfast in the sky— The burning ranks, the golden multitude Of chariots wherein unweariedly The Lords of Time have evermore pursued The flying Future through the realms of Space: Sands run, and stars renew their solemn chase. “And shall we wish to hurry to the End? To sleep—to lose the rush, the stress, the glow, The rapture of the chase, because we bend At whiles faint bruised and dusty? Ah, no! no! Let all the seasons in the good fruit blend! And yet it was but three short months ago I sat as now we sit above the sea And this was all the thought that dwelt in me:— “The stars came gliding out of the sea To gaze on the sleeping City, With a tremulous light in their glances bright Of wonderful love and pity. “The breeze was breathing its olden song In a drowsy murmurous chanting; While the noble bay with its moonlight spray, Kept time in a slumbrous panting. “The City couched in a deep repose, All toil, all care suspended; The roar and the strife of its turbid life In the calm of Nature blended. “‘Alas!’ I sighed with a weary sigh, ‘That all the sin and sorrow, Now dreaming there, so calm and fair, Must wake afresh to-morrow! “‘Would that the whole might still rest on, Entranced, for ever sleeping; The sea and the sky, and the stars on high, And those myriads born for weeping!’” “What pansy's most imperial purple dye, What rapturous flush of redness in the rose, What lily's perfect moon-white purity, From that dark rain of weeping gleams or glows! For as the sun shines ever in the sky, And ever round our earth the free wind blows, So evermore the tears of heaven distil Beauty and good with sorrow for our ill. “But I waste costly hours: for this fair Isle Is Ithaca; and poor Penelope, Who has been constant all the dreary while, Weaving wan hopes of vain embroidery, Clasps her Ulysses, young, withouten guile, And famishes to hear his Odyssey. When he has told what wonders him befell, She has a little tale of home to tell.” “And she shall be cross-questioned to and fro, Backwards and forwards, sideways, up and down, Anent the tale of suitors who we know Were victims to a starry-bright renown,— Rash moths that plunged into the burning glow, Lovely, but crueler than tempest's frown.— No outward chances gave that voyage a story; But from within came all the gloom and glory. “My soul was like a jewel-amulet, Under favour of Göthe, who (having mentioned talismans) sings— “Amulete sind dergleichen Auf Papier geschriebne zeichen.” —West-östlicher Divan. The term, however, has been commonly used in the wider sense. Pale, troubled, day by day more dim and wan; The fatal shadow of a vast regret, The pallor of an awful fear, were on And in its lustre, that seemed always wet As with dull tears of hope for ever gone: If fitfully it gleamed again, the light Was such as oozes up from graves by night. “Life wasting out by saddest slow degrees; Life's heart-blood, love, a thin warm crimson thread, Trickling so long that scarce the bitter lees Kept the pale corse half-living and half-dead: Indian, Arabian, and Egyptian seas Gave me this vision of too-dreadful dread, Blurring their splendour; as the storm took shape To Gama in the Phantom of the Cape. “The City of the Greek, whose uproar jars The silence of sad Sphinx and pyramid, Affronts the desert's solitude, and mars The solemn mystery of millenniums hid In unknown mountains under other stars, Scared not the Spectre; pale and cold amid The rainbow throngs, the hum, the savage cries, It held me with its deep accusing eyes. “We crept upon the smooth Mid Sea; the air Was feverous with Sirocco; the red sun Burned fiercer for the haze that dimmed his glare; All life drooped sick: yet in that hour begun A fiery change for me,—the dull despair, The pallor and the stagnant tarnish dun, Fermented with keen flames and flashes bright; New battle opened with a burst of light. “The amulet, that had been dim and pale As ghostly moon in northern night forlorn, Dead-still and shrouded in a wan mist-veil, Grew then blood-crimson as that high sun shorn Of beams—that red hot cannon-ball; a wail, A long keen passionate terrible cry was borne Rending the lethal dumbness; pierced, I sprang As if to grasp a foe who dealt the pang. “Quivering with agony as blind as doom, And rage as impotent as nightmare-sleep; Restless as one who even in the tomb Finds that malignant Memory will not steep Her burning heart in the oblivious gloom; I paced the deck; I glared athwart the deep, As if intense volition could enslave Your anchored isle to float across the wave. “The day burned out sublimely in the West, My soul was burning till the night was gone,— Until the moon sank withering from heaven's crest Before the fiery armies of the dawn, Whose van was up with golden spears in rest; And my sea calenture became a lawn— An English lawn, that loveliest lakelet green Guarding an English home of life serene. “Ruthlessly brilliant as the crowded eyes Of Roman ladies glittering down intent On some barbarian's mortal agonies, The stars thick-gathered in the firmament— That amphitheatre of solemn skies Round earth's arena dark with hot blood spent In so much barren and ignoble strife— Had gazed upon the Passion of my Life. “The beautiful alien stars were pitiless As bland white statues of the gods could be To suppliants leaguered with the direst stress Of earthquake, fire, or flood, or storm-swelled sea; Gods unperturbed in their high happiness: But the pure infant Dawn compassioned me; The day-spring bathed my fever in its balm, Divinely sweet and cool, divinely calm. “And even as I felt its first sweet rest, And knew myself once more alive and sane, And yearned toward peaceful English homesteads blest In looking out upon the waveless main; Even in that instant from the far north-west, Where like a pearl-grey cloudlet with no stain Malta grew visible, a swelling psalm Floated you on its rapture through the calm. “Clad all in white, you Angel; crystal-bare The feet that did not touch the sapphire sea; Your head clothed only with its own rich hair, Flowing dishevelled even to the knee; God's dove athwart the deluge of despair Bringing the blessing of the olive-tree: For you were radiant, and your brow's moon-splendour Shed on your glowing cheeks a veil most tender. “You rested floating upright, when so near That my stretched arm had almost reached the place; Your vision swept the lonely hemisphere As if with triumph in the ample space, Then fixed on me, so that I felt you hear My mute emotion; then, with glorious grace Leaning, you whispered: ‘It is well, well, well!’ And vanished as my bosom's first breath fell. “And from that moment it was well indeed With me, and well grows better evermore; Well on the white waves whitened by our speed, Well in the gloaming on this lovely shore; And ever well it must be now decreed, Whatever yet the Future holds in store; Our love is fixed; therefore erect, elate, With awe, but with no fear, we welcome Fate.” When thus his tale was done, to him she told What she had told her Mother on the morrow Of that same night, whose wonders manifold Transfigured two sick lives of fear and sorrow Into twin raptures, rich with all the gold That Earth could ever from Heaven's pathways borrow; The nights were one, the solemn dawns were one, Both triumphs mounted with the selfsame sun. All she had told before she told to him, And more that could be told to him alone; And while the moon ventured its faery rim, Then floated up the vague, he drank the tone Of her low voice and marked her pure eyes swim As on the vast vague sea of the Unknown, Which floods and ebbs with infinite longing awe; And kissed them back to earth's most tender law. “Some night,” she whispered, “when the moon shall be As then a little later than to-night, And self-withdrawn as then the quiet sea Has left the sands to glitter in clear light; And all the rock-strown shore around is free From human presence and all else that might The dread charm break, the secret spirit scare, We two alone, my dearest, will go there. “And we may hear a music, full of power As the great sea with all its waves in storm, Yet lovely as the purest lily-flower, And mystic as the moonlight soft and warm; And when the singing has entranced the hour We may discover an immortal form,— Glaucus, our sea-god reverend and benign, Among the rocks that seem his ruined shrine “And we will kneel as one before him there; And you shall utter all the gratitude And reverence of both our hearts, which were Too great for me to utter. If he should But lay his hands with the old tender care Upon our heads and bless us,—Oh that would Make holier to us evermore the place With antique pieties and natural grace!” “Heathen of heathens! I am all unmanned; Wicked as is your will, it must be done. Good hap for me that this old sea-god bland, And not the radiant Monarch of the Sun, Met you and charmed you: think! I come to land, And ask for Helen; they my asking shun; What strange sad sunflower haunts the garden's mouth? A modern Clytie yearning toward the South!” These lovers have arisen, and have left, Together gone into the night away; And I seem standing on the shore, bereft, Watching the weaving of the waves and spray, But cannot weave into my halfspun weft Another flower, or golden from the day Or purple from the night; for, day and night, In that moondusk they have evanished quite. The lots are huddled in the fatal urn; The fairest souls may draw the darkest doom, And so long years their innate splendour burn Struggling disastrously with stormy gloom: Yet some fair souls find Fate and Chance not stern, Their light has but to shine and not consume; God's vestals feeding the eternal flame In beautiful temples hallowed by His name. The doom of these whom I have ever lost I know not—whether calm as temple air, Or wild as mountain-beacon tempest-tost; Nor need we search it with an anxious care . . . But one thread more the dusky loom has crossed, Some lines in her own writing firm and fair; No date, no place; these pretty words above “Two petals of our Fadeless Rose of Love.” I “I went of late amid the dancing throng, To dance with Him—my Love who loveth me; His whisper caught me up, ‘How long, how long, Have I been seeking, desolate, for thee! And now—Oh well a man might seek and trace For twenty lives, in hope at last to see The perfect vision of this fairest face Of all fair faces in the world that be! II “‘Such joy as our dark world has when the moon Comes floating sole and regnant in her skies; Such joy to me, such glorifying boon, When one sole Presence floateth in my eyes. More beautiful to-night than ever, Sweet, And yet most beautiful at every time: How do you make perfection more complete? How leave like infancy the queenliest prime? III “‘Upon my hopeless night your dawn arose; I said, The World can never be more bright: Yet ever, more and more, the splendour grows, And leaves that dawn confused with ancient night. I cry, This moment must be full-crowned noon! The moment brings new bursts of life and light! No more! no more! my heart and spirit swoon In thine infinity of heavenly might! IV “‘A dawn?—Your brow itself is what a dawn! Emerging from that Indian dusk of hair, With all its poor pale pearl-stars backwithdrawn, The archèd Promise shines so proudly fair. I find you out at last: you stir one tress, You let some young smile dream, you change a flower; And straight you are transformed! O Sorceress And Queen of Spells, I tremble at your power!’ V “I went last night amid the dancing throng, To dance with Him—my Love who loveth me: He sprang a-flush, ‘How long, how long, how long! The twenty lives I waited here for thee!’ My dark-brown hair, the string of pearls, I wore, As when his praises flowed so royally: ‘I bring the self-same spell that charmed before; To prove, indeed, your own inconstancy!’ VI “We stood together in the far recess: His noble eyes dilated full and bright, With love triumphant throbbing happiness; He bent down o'er me from his stately height— ‘How can our Queen, whose spirit sways the sun, Deign to enchant so mean a youth as this? Of all her countless spells the weakest one Would trance him evermore in perfect bliss. VII “‘Dear twilight mystery of hair, that now Art starred with pearls, I bid all night farewell; Pure archèd Promise of the dawn-bright brow, The full noon neareth, grand as you foretell!’ He placed a kiss upon my brow and hair, His kiss of Love enthroned and glorified; I felt it burning like a ruby there, The pallid pearl-gleams in its fulgence died: VIII “I felt it flushing all my neck and face, What time we danced among the dancers free; To all the youths and maidens in the place It signalled proudly of my Love and me: It lights and warms me in my chamber now, It lights the world, the years, all things that be; A royal jewel sacred to my brow, A Splendour lamping all Eternity.” Jersey, Xmas 1861. London, July 1864. SHELLEY Upon a grassy slope of shore I lay Hour after hour, from sunset into night, Outgazing tranquil o'er the tranquil bay, And dreaming in a mood of rare delight. Yes, for some hours, sky-pure sea-calm star-bright My spirit was in tune with heaven and earth, Nor felt the discords of its mortal birth. The round moon floated half-way up the sky, Beneath an arch of clouds serenely fair As if upfurled where never breeze could fly: So that it seemed a lamp suspended there To light the sea-floored theatre of air; Whose curtain raised, whose hush of expectation Foretold a solemn drama's celebration. My dream grew deeper, deeper evermore; A sleepless dream, a seeing trance, no swoon. I floated with the throb of sea and shore, And felt the earth swift-wheeling with the moon, And saw the worlds as they indeed are,—strewn Above, below, as fish through ocean roam, Not gliding round an even-surfaced dome. Until the Drama which that hush foretold Did come indeed as at a monarch's call; Although its pregnant scenes were not unrolled Upon that sea-stage, nor within that wall Of circling crystal, nor were lamped at all By that serenest moon,—they claimed a stage Of ampler scope and grander equipage. The stars are speeding in their companies; God's chariots in divine array, they roll Circling the sphere of three infinities, Our symbol of His thought-confounding Whole, As Plato saw them with his clear-eyed soul: See the Phædrus. He saw, we see; and each one tries to tell The Vision each one knows ineffable. And every silver-burning chariot-sphere Whose wheels churn Æther to the foam of Light Is guided by its seraph-charioteer, Serenely regnant o'er its fulgent flight, Sceptred and crowned and clothed with awful might: The infinite armies of the Lord, whose pinions Flash fire throughout His infinite dominions. And yet, as every dreamer seems to be The centre of the action of his dream, Our speck of this poor earth-sphere was to me The single central fountain whence did stream The growing river of that drama's theme; Which rolled so far and broadened out so wide That all the worlds were floated on its tide. A voice fell past me like a plummet cast To fathom that unfathomable sea, A voice austerely sad,—“At last, at last The measure of the earth's iniquity Brims God's great urn; at last it all must be Poured out upon the earth in blood and tears And raging fire, for years and years and years. “The Churches are polluted,—let them fall And crush old errors underneath their weight; The royal purples are a bloody pall To stifle Freedom,—rend them ere too late; The laws are silken meshes for the great But iron nets to hold the poor and mean,— Let them too perish. . . . But what next is seen? “Because the priests were false, the shrines impure, Mankind in God Himself all faith have lost; Because blood dyed old purples, they endure To walk all naked in the sun and frost; Because old laws the law of justice crost, They would live henceforth without any law: No loyal service, no revering awe! “Who will go down amidst these desolations Of fire and blood and lunacies and woe, To chant aloud to all the wildered nations Those heavenly truths no earth can overthrow, The changeless truths Eternal? Who will go To preach the Gospel of our Lord above, Chanting perpetually the law of Love?” Throughout the whole sphere-throbbing vastitude Deep silence followed when that great voice ended; Even the music of the multitude Of all their rhythmic revolutions blended, The ever-rolling music, seemed suspended: And I then dared to lift my awe-shut eyes And search for him who spoke throughout the skies. Search for the moon of night, the sun of day!— In centre of the universal round A broad and steadfast disc of splendour lay; Fit field for him who stood upon its ground, The solemn angel with pure glory crowned,— His right hand raised, his countenance divine Intently listening through the hyaline. From far, far, far, far even in that vast, A voice came trembling ravishingly sweet— “O Raphael beloved of God! the last And meanest of the spirits who repeat Eternal praises round the Judgment-Seat Implores that he, if none of greater worth, May sing the self-same praises on that earth.” A pure joy lighted up great Raphael's face As then he gestured “Hither!”; and there came A star-like speck from out the bounds of space With swift and swerveless flight to reach its aim, Developing into a tongue of flame, Until it stood upon that field of light A fervent Seraph beautiful and bright. Most beautiful in the eternal youth Of those who ever breathe the heavenly air Of perfect holiness and love and truth; Most bright in full-flusht fervour, standing there With half-spread wings and backward-streaming hair, As if alit for but a moment's rest While speeding forward on his single quest. Then Raphael laid a benedictive hand On that pure brow, and spake in gentle tone— “Thou dear, dear Child of God, than whom doth stand No purer humbler spirit near His throne, And none more ardent to speed forth alone On any errand from the bliss above In single-hearted and unbounded love; “Thy service is accepted: thou shalt pall In mortal flesh thy seraphood sublime; A witness of the one true Lord of all Amidst a world gone mad with sin and crime, A prophet of the glorious Future time, And of Eternity when Time is past Amidst the Present of a world aghast. “I see the storm's commencing clouds of gloom, I see the storm's first lightnings fiercely flash, I hear the storm's first thunders roll and boom, I hear the storm's first ruins quake and crash,— O Man, thy judgment-wrath is wild and rash!. . . Go down, dear Child; and may God give thee power To serve Him loyally thro' this stern hour.” Then most elastic Time, as oft in dream, Stretched out until five lustrums came and went, Swaying my soul upon their stormy stream, The earth was shaken, the great deeps were rent; From all the quarters of the firmament A desolating deluge seemed to pour Of fire and blood and tears and frantic war. Amidst whose terrors one stern human form, Above the mad crowds throned in haughty state, Appeared to wield the thunders of the storm And hurl its dreadful lightnings, and dilate— The Captain-Executioner of Fate; Until dragged down, and with a galling chain Bound to a lonely rock amidst the main. And then another lustrum came and went, Of peaceful years compared with those before; Wherein I heard that Voice whose ravishment I had not heard amid the crash and roar And shriekings of the earth-confusing war. Through all the lustrum till the chained Chief died That glorious Voice the air beatified. A voice of right amidst a world's foul wrong, A voice of hope amidst a world's despair, A voice instinct with such melodious song As hardly until then had thrilled the air Of this gross underworld wherein we fare: With heavenly inspirations, too divine For souls besotted with earth's sensual wine. All powers and virtues that ennoble men— The hero's courage and the martyr's truth, The saint's white purity, the prophet's ken, The high unworldliness of ardent youth, The poet's rapture, the apostle's ruth, Informed the Song; whose theme all themes above Was still the sole supremacy of Love. The peals of thunder echoing through the sky, The moaning and the surging roar of seas, The rushing of the storm's stern harmony, The subtlest whispers of the summer breeze, The notes of singing birds, the hum of bees, All sounds of nature, sweet and wild and strong Commingled in the flowing of the song; Which flowing mirrored all the Universe,— With sunsets flushing down the golden lines, And mountains towering in the lofty verse, And landscapes with their olives and their vines Spread out beneath a sun which ever shines, With moonlit seas and pure star-spangled skies, The World a Poem, and Earth Paradise. But ever and anon in its swift sweetness The voice was heard to lisp and hesitate, Or quiver absently from its completeness, As one in foreign realms who must translate Old thoughts into new language—Ah, how great The difference between our rugged tongue And that in which its hymns before were sung! A glorious voice of glorious inspiration; A voice of rapid rapture so intense That in its musical intoxication The Truth arrayed with such an affluence Of Beauty half-escaped the ravished sense,— A sun scarce visible in its own shine, A god forgotten in his gorgeous shrine. A voice divinely sweet, a voice no less Divinely sad; for all the maddening jar Of all the wide world's sin and wretchedness Swelled round its music, as when round a star Black storm-clouds gather and its white light mar: Pure music is pure bliss in heaven alone; Earth's air transmutes it to melodious moan. The lustrum passed. The vultures of despair And fierce ambition ceased not to consume The heart of him rock-bound, who failed to bear With Titan-patience his Promethean doom— Lacking the Titan's conscience. When the tomb Had held him but a little while in peace, I heard the singing voice for ever cease. And then once more the Vision filled my soul Of universal Æther, and the spheres Whose marshalled myriads through its silence roll With life and light and music; while the years, Heavy with anguish, blind with blood and tears, Pant after them, exhausted one by one Till the last heir of Time shall sink foredone. Upon his central field of burning gold Great Raphael stood; and there with meek head bowed And drooping wings and suppliant hands, behold, The Seraph knelt, whom still the sullen cloud Of mortal life enveloped like a shroud, Through which his native glorious beauty shown Star-sad, star-pure, star-tremulous, star-wan. And Raphael said “How faint and sad and pale You now return to us, Belovèd One, From that far Earth of stormy guilt and bale Wherein thy errand now is wholly done! Hath ever God deserted a dear Son?” While bending down, his princely hand carest The saintly brow so pallid and deprest. What voice of quivering anguish made reply!— “I am unworthy of thy ruthful love, Thou pure Archangel! Never more may I Rejoin in bliss the stainless quires above, Who singing in their circles ever move Around the footstool of the Throne of Grace; Ah, never, nevermore behold His face! “I dared—weak worm unconscious of my weakness!— To claim a service to our Lord and King; And I have failed;—in hope and faith and meekness, In wisdom, knowledge, patient suffering, In prudence, calmness, power, in everything! The awful eyes of all Thy stars, O Lord, Transfix me with rebukes, each glance a sword! “Breathing for ever Heaven's inviolate calm, I knew not how on Earth the wild winds blow; Singing for ever Heaven's ecstatic psalm, I knew not how on earth the wails of woe And shrieks of rage to maddening discord grow; Circling for ever in the Sun's full light, I knew not Earth's black clouds and sphereless night. “I could not understand men; all their hearts Had secrets which I could not even guess. Their greed for dross upon the daily marts, Their pride and fawning in the palaces, Their solemn church-attending worldliness, Their servile fear of Custom's lawless law, Filled me with sad perplexity and awe. “Their gods seemed hideous monsters only great In power and malice, or such phantoms vain As self-bewildered thought might evocate To mock the yearning heart and weary brain. I strove to teach them the true God, Whose reign Is infinite love for all things that exist; And I was branded as an Atheist. “I pitied both the tyrant and the slave; The one so cursed with pride and heartless mood, The other from the cradle to the grave With soul and body famishing for food. I charged them by their common brotherhood To fling their mutual bonds off and be free: They paused in their old strife to spurn at me. “I who was sent to charm their souls to love, Could only vex them to worse hate and scorn; And yet I swear, O Raphael, that I strove With all my power to mend their state forlorn: By every pang they felt my heart was torn, The else-unfelt oppressions of the earth.”“Julian and Maddalo.” And wounded worse by their unkindly spurning: I loved them with a love of infinite yearning. “Lo, I have failed: but God, He cannot fail. He speeds a shaft against Hell's Dragon-King, And it falls shivered from the iron mail;— There let it rot, the weak and worthless thing! I dare to triumph in my perishing: His quiver lacks not many a nobler dart Equal to pierce the Monster to the heart!” But Raphael raised the Seraph from his kneeling, And prest him heart to heart in long embrace; Then stood erect, to all the heights revealing The fulgent beauty of his solemn face; And flung abroad his voice to swell through space And thrill on all the ever-rolling spheres Triumphant music for celestial ears. “I call to witness all the angel-quires Sphering the heavens with their eternal hymn, I call to witness all the orbèd fires Bearing the light of life through Æther dim; The saints, the Cherubim, the Seraphim, All armies of the Servants of our Lord, I call to witness to my just award. “Thou hast not failed; where holy love and truth Contend with Evil failure cannot be: Their sorest scars claim reverence not ruth, Their worst repulse is still a victory. Thou, well-belovèd, who didst bend the knee In pure self-sacrifice to meet God's frown, Kneeling wert circled with the martyr's crown. “Music is sweet, whatever madmen's ears Be startled and tormented by the strain; Sunshine is glorious, whatever spheres Cloud themselves from it in dark storm and rain: Your spirit is as pure from worldly stain As is a moonbeam on a shore of slime; You sank not your Eternity in Time. “O wretched Earth! God sends thee age by age, In pity of thy wild perpetual moan, The saint, the bard, the hero, and the sage: But still the lofty life is led alone, The singer sings as in a tongue unknown, The sage's wisdom lamps his single urn; Thou wilt not heed or imitate or learn. “The blood of prophets thou hast loved to shed Still keepeth green thy fields, whose costly soil Is of the dust of nameless heroes dead; Carlyle. The only music in the vast turmoil Of all thy complicated strife and toil Was breathed from poets whom you starved with scorn: “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.” —Shelley, “Defence of Poetry.” O ever-unregenerate world forlorn!” Lo, while the great Archangel's voice rang on, The spirit by that tearful earth-cloud shaded In ever clear and clearer beauty shone To full transfiguration; for it faded As mists of night whose meshes are unbraided By the swift beams of morning, so that they Evanish wholly in the perfect day. And there, amidst the wheeling constellations, Upon the central disc of burning gold That throbbed harmonious with their palpitations, He stood with Raphael glorious to behold. . . . Then all the Vision from my brain was rolled; For that broad disc of palpitating fire, Consuming far through heaven the dead night's pyre, And bridging the deep bay with golden splendour, Was our own Sun. . . . The sky was clear and calm, The morning air most fragrant, fresh and tender, The green earth glittered with its dewy balm, The flashing waters sang a joyous psalm: All was as beautiful and pure that morn As if a sinless world had just been born. Jersey, 1861. THE DEAD YEAR I At midnight, in the heart of that great wood, Whose trunks towered dark and spectral, crowned with snow, Alone amidst the chill north wind I stood; And saw, whenas some fiercer gust would blow, White fragments plunge upon the white below; And from the rigid branches heard the blast Wring long wild clamours as its fury passed. II There saw I, at that time, the weak old Year Descend in silence from his chariot-throne; A weary wight, whose rest-joy dreamed some fear. But in the face of Him who climbed thereon Youth's vigorous hope and self-assurance shone; Though stern and clouded with the gloomy thought— Must this beginning with that end be fraught? III The thronèd King went proudly on his path: The other turned, and with mysterious sighs Fled onward with the tempest's gathering wrath. Beneath the scornful brilliance of the skies, Crowded with stars like cold unpitying eyes, My soul pursued the thin grey quivering form That like a cloud was hurried down the storm. IV 'Thwart homeless mountains, dead and shrouded plains, 'Thwart roaring woods and billowy wastes of moor, 'Thwart the Mid-sea and Afric's wild domains Of desert-fire and haunted realm obscure, His flight as swerveless as a new colure Swept down the savage ocean to its goal— The icy heart of death, the Southern Pole. V The broad cold joyless glare thrust into sight A ghastly nakedness of ice, which lay In livid bulks with grinning points of light; Sublime though terrible. But from the day Winding a strange and labyrinthic way Through hollows and ravines of frozen gloom, The realmless shadow sought and found his tomb, VI And, still advancing, cried in feeble tone, I come to join my buried Sires in death. Whereto I heard a congregated moan, A quavering sigh and moan of feeble breath, Respond, “Is yet another born for death?” He cried, A Youth now sways the pauseless car. They moaned, “Alas! the End, how far—how far?” VII I saw the secret Spectre-peopled tomb;— A mighty Cavern vaulted like a sky, Filled with a dreary mitigated gloom; For out of its dark-frowning canopy, And out of all its vague immensity, Cold sparkles glittering keen as naked blades Wrought constant twilight of inconstant shades. VIII And while yet died away the piteous moans, The moaning multitude therein I found: Dim regal shadows, throned on icy thrones Ranged pace by pace about the vast wall-round, And stretching still beyond the utmost bound To which the disinterring light could pierce, They sat—the Phantoms of the Buried Years. IX Their crowned brows were hoar and shrunk with age, Their sceptred hands with nerveless tremors shook, Their lightless eyes seemed spell-bound to the page Spread open of a knee-supported book, So overcharged with writings that my look Brought nothing to my mind except a waste Of blots and reckless scratches interlaced. X And every robe was foul, and fiercely rent, And stiff and dark with heavy clots of gore; And every crown and sceptre cloven and shent. They all with finished age were weak and hoar, Yet in their ages there was less and more; By slight degrees ascending to an Eld Whose contemplation mind and spirit quell'd. XI From off his soul-confusing Chronicle Each drew at length reluctant eyes away, And quavered to the Shadow standing still, “You come but now from that fair realm of day; We long have pined, to this dark tomb a prey: Ere yet thou take thy throne of silent pain Inform us, we desire thee, of thy reign. XII “How tends the bitter fate-deciding war, Constant between the Evil and the Good? Mankind—have they grown better than of yore, Less steeped and brutalised in lust and blood, Less fatally inconsequent of mood, More valiant, faithful, loving, and sincere? Is any hope that now the End draws near?” XIII He said, Could you but see me, O my Sires, Your eyes had read ere this what you would hear; For I am stained with blood and scarred with fires, And rent and wounded and amazed with fear. And they responded with their plainings drear, “Ah! blood and fire for ever, as of old! Yet let thy voice thy story now unfold.” XIV He sighed, Ev'n as of old; nor is there hope That yet it neareth to the final doom: For broad and deep as ever yawns the scope— An almost unattempted gulf of gloom Thronged thick with monsters savage to consume, Taloned and scaled with force and dread for strife— Between what is and that which should be Life. XV The old deep-founded Temples far renowned, The vast and lofty Temples quake and split: A column here reels prostrate to the ground; A roof-tree there sinks crumbling after it, Leaving free vision of the Infinite; Some sudden storm lays flat blank breadths of wall: Entire destruction seems to threaten all. XVI Their rich adornment of all gems and gold, Their marbles pure and massy stones displaced, Their forms of lofty sculpture manifold, Are left exposed to incoherent waste; The splendour soiled, the lineaments defaced: No Architect appeareth, to assign Them saving service in a nobler Shrine. XVII The worshippers abandon them in fear, And with them God and God's restraining law; Or, used so long to love and to revere, Tread down new reason underneath old awe, And cling with eyes shut blind to every flaw. More loud, more proud, the priests declaim their parts, To drown the murmurs swelling in their hearts. XVIII Exiled from God and His paternal love, Far—far from home, men languish desolate; A dungeon-roof, instead of Heaven, above; And constant vision through the iron grate Of one stern Jailor, blind and stony Fate— The stony heart unthrilled by wail or prayer, The stony eyes that blench at no despair. XIX The noblest given over to his hand Have no trust left, but to confront his pride With such endurance, wisdom, self-command, That they become his peers—are petrified Against his shafts—erect, though unallied: Their sole religion and their comfort sole, To love and help their fellows in this dole. XX There ceased he for a while; and all the throng Of trembling phantoms, till my heart was sore With their so piteous moaning, moaned “How long? So was it in the long, long days of yore; Must it be so for ever, evermore? How long, dread Lord, thus weary and opprest, Must we await the End of perfect rest?” XXI They moaned: but One arose, of solemn mien And lofty stature, on whose features grand Wisdom and love and sorrow dwelt serene; And swayed a Cross for sceptre in his hand; And spoke in tranquil accents of command, “The mighty tree's slow life doth tower and spread, Although the branch whence this was formed be dead.” XXII And then Another, on whose turban-crown A Crescent keenly flamed with blood-red light, Arose, and flung the gorgeous jewel down, And cried, “That infant Splendour shone out bright Between the clouds one dark and stormy night. All things of earth succumb to Time and Fate: The moons are fuller now; the month grows late.” XXIII When all was still the throneless Shade went on: Blood has been shed, my robe is foul with gore: Amidst the heights of sacred Lebanon, In China, in Morocco, on the shore From Capua to Palermo, war—war—war: And these are but a wound's first drops of blood, Ere yet the veins bring up their gushing flood. XXIV The war of classes, which has raged so long, Still groweth more intense, till it attain The crisis fatal to the deadlier wrong. Imperial liars, thronèd Kings insane, Statesmen and placemen selfish, blind and vain, The Peoples' inward rottenness avow; And Europe's Cæsars are her Aztecs now. XXV Around her churches of the cross and spire, Around her palaces so rich and haught, Around her castles of volcanic fire, Around her polities so subtly wrought, Rages a wild waste flood of restless thought. Sapping the old foundations: those must be Full firmly fixed that long defy the sea. XXVI Long gathering foulness stifled all the air: The storm began in France; then, desolating, Swept Europe with its lightnings everywhere; Through fierce destructions ever re-creating. One woe is past, another woe is waiting: The air is still with sullen foulness rife, And men still breathe, not life, but death-in-life. XXVII The mass of traders full of lies and fraud, The mass of rulers cowardly and blind, The mass of people without faith or God, The mass of teachers barren as the wind, The mass of laws unsuited to mankind: What doom do these imperiously require, But blood and death, and ordeal as by fire? XXVIII He paused again; and straightway all the throng Of spectral Struldbrugs See Swift's “Gulliver's Travels.” thrilled the icy gloom, Moaning in chorus drear, “How long, how long, How long are we within our living tomb Condemned to hateful consciousness of Doom? When will the ocean of eternity Engulf us, quenching all our misery?” XXIX But one vast Shade (by whom a couchant form, Monstrous, loomed dim) rose, threatful, far away, And cried, “This pigmy Man—this evil swarm Of restless, lawless, greedy imps, that prey On Earth our Mother—shall he last for aye? He dream to last, who gathereth bone by bone All that is left now of the Mastodon?” XXX Then all exclaimed, “Thou, youngest in this hell; Much of the tale thou tellest, each one here Of many thousands had before to tell: One thread of crimson wrath or sombre fear In Fate's wide loom still runs through many a year. Hast thou no star in night, no gleam of good To mark thee out amidst our brotherhood?” XXXI O venerable Fathers, he replied: If summer boasteth of her full-blown flowers, They yet were fostered to their perfect pride, Through germ and bud, by many previous hours Of wintry snows, of vernal suns and showers. I wear, indeed, upon my brow one star, By which I may be singled out afar. XXXII A nation long was trodden in the dust 'Neath various and discordant tyrannies, Until it seemed embruted to the lust Of its base despots,—mortgaging for these The priceless fame of olden centuries; And, like the wretchedness of Circe's swine, Drugging its all-sick soul with sensual wine. XXXIII This nation is aroused from shore to shore; The drunken lethargy is past away, The drunken frenzies vex its brain no more. The night is gone; the sullen lingering grey Consumes in fires of the advancing day, Whose crimson dawn shall have an azure noon This people rise, to labour for its boon. XXXIV The dreamer graspeth firmly Action's sword; The coward plunges smiling down the grave, To drag down with him tyranny abhorred; The meanest miser and self-seeking knave Give all up for their country; the poor slave Of superstition dares to see the truth; The long-oppressed is full of gentle ruth. XXXV The Niobe Byron, in “Childe Harold.” of nations, petrified, With all her children prostrate at her feet, Each with a barbed arrow in its side, Hath started into sudden life to greet With yearning love and wonder rapture-sweet Her darlings waking from their trance of death; Though two lie still, ev'n they breathe prescient breath. XXXVI Whence hath been poured this great electric thrill, Of God-like power to quicken very stone With life and soul, with hope and strength and will?— Throughout that air, long filled with hopeless moan, A living Voice was heard supreme and lone, Calm as the heavens and mighty as the sea, Arise! arise, Italia! one and free! XXXVII A Shade Dante. See the “Divine Comedy” throughout. stood up with interruption keen— A woe-worn countenance, sad earnest eyes, Brow-crowned with bitter bays, exalted mien— “O slow-come triumph of my prophecies! For this I never ceased to agonise, In banishment, in pain, in want—or fed As menials are with strangers' bitter bread.” XXXVIII Another Shadow Shelley. See the “Ode to Naples” (1820). Upon his tomb at Rome are inscribed the words “Cor Cordium.”—surely not of man, But Seraph beautiful—above whose throne, For motto, these two words “Cor Cordium” ran In letters throbbing fire, stood next alone; And chanted in a clear and solemn tone, “Since now hope, truth, and justice, do avail, O Naples and Italia, hail, all hail!” XXXIX The youngest looked up proud to that dim dome: Florence and Milan, Naples, Sicily, Are crying out to Venice and to Rome, “Ye soon shall rise to join our family, And make us one inviolate Italy: With fear-stung rage the Austrian frets, past bound; The Papal thunders are innocuous sound.” XL How has such fruit by such a tree been borne? How has this Italy, in sheer despite Of foes whose legions laughed her arms to scorn, Of friends as false in heart as great in might, Of statesmen plotting wrongs to help the right, Of Europe selfish, of herself distract, Wrought out her grand idea into fact? XLI She has two noble sons; by these she is. The Thinker; who, inspired from earliest youth, In want and pain, in exile's miseries, 'Mid alien scorn, 'mid foes that knew not ruth, Has ever preached his spirit's inmost truth; Though friends waxed cold or turned their love to hate, Though even now his country is ingrate. XLII The Doer, whose high fame as purely shines As His, Timoleon's. See Plutarch's Lives; whence the simile in the following line. who heretofore Sicilia won With victories flowing free as Homer's lines. Sublime in action when the strife is on, Sublime in pity when the strife is done; A pure and lofty spirit, blessed from sight Of meaner nature's selfishness, and spite. XLIII Therefore, O fathers, my best symbol see, Noble in meanness, rent, and stained with gore: To future Romans this Red Shirt shall be, As was that Leathern Apron The famous Direfsh-e-Gavanee, or Apron of Gavah the Smith, which Feridoon adopted for the banner of Iran: adorning it with jewels, to which each successive Monarch added until it blazed like a meteor in the front of battle. borne of yore To all the glittering pomp of Persian war. If any hope despite the Past may be; Italia shall be one, great, glorious, free! XLIV He finished; and deep silence followed. Then The congregated Shades in doubtful chime Maundered all querulous;—like senile men, Who, stranded helpless on the present time, See nought before them but a waste of slime Left by that ebbing flood of life, which rolled So strong and deep in their young days of old. XLV “Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Greece and Rome— How many a lofty creed and glorious state!— Have flourished under Heaven's eternal dome, With vigour emulous to last its date. Go, seek them now: they moulder desolate, Or languish ignominiously effete; Thus mortal things with Time and Doom compete! XLVI “The pure, the wise, the beautiful, the brave, The darlings of Earth's golden youth, are—where? Deep-trampled, rotted in the formless grave; Though still, wan ghosts, they haunt the upper air. Are wiser, purer, braver, breathing there? Plato's broad brow frowns homilies forlorn; Nay, Helen's lips smile all your hopes to scorn. XLVII “Then vex not us, nor vex thyself, we pray, With hopes whose vanity we proved of yore. One hope is fixed; when earth has passed away, And sin has perished, Time shall be no more;— Oh, that the grand catastrophe were o'er!— Behold, awaiteth thee that penal throne, Which while thou reignedst there down here hath grown, XLVIII “As by its side another now doth grow For him who reigneth now so young and proud.” He shuddered to his seat of wordless woe; The palsied heads to their old pages bowed. My spirit was withdrawn, amazed and cowed, From those cadaverous servitors of Doom; Dim, silent, ghastly, in their living tomb. 1860. THE DELIVERER Reprinted by permission from the Fortnightly Review. I was a captive. Massive walls sevenfold Encompassed all the prison high and bare; The stone, the brass, the iron, the triple gold, And yet another which we knew not there. Year after year I wasted there alone;— Now quiet, crushed beneath that woe immense; Now moaning with a weary changeless moan; Now frantic with still-baffled impotence: And heard at times through all that stony gloom The idiotic laugh, the piercing cry Of others; each within his living tomb Chained, wretched, helpless, impotent as I. Until one eve, when I felt sick to death, I found a love-prayer cowering in my heart: And clothed it with strong wings of passionate breath, And sent it thro' the heavens to plead our part. “O dreadful Lord, O gracious God, I know That I and all the other captives here Have wrought, each for himself, this doom of woe: Yet Thou, All-merciful, bend down Thine ear! “Alas, alas! what have we for a plea? We are most wretched; wretched most in this, That, tho' we strive, we cannot burn to Thee In love as Thou to us and all that is.” In that same night, when I was fallen asleep After such agony of yearning prayer, A voice came gliding through my slumber deep, A voice, a glow, a waft of vital air. I woke; and, raising gloom-attempered eyes, They blinked at lustre, but no form could see. The Voice rang singing sweet, “Awake, arise! And come out hither, and be ever free!” I stood—the fetters kept no longer hold; I walked straight forward through the dungeon-wall, And through the others—brass and iron and gold; And passing thro' them felt them not at all. And all the while that Voice sang full and sweet, “Come forth, come forth, poor captives everyone! Oh, shut not fast your ears when I entreat! Come forth, and breathe the air and see the sun!” I thought myself quite free, when, lo! I found An adamantine barrier foil me there: I could not see, could scarcely feel its bound,— A wall, a curtain woven of pure air. What poignant anguish pierced my blissful trance, Thus baffled at the very verge of Heaven!— “Dear Angel of divine deliverance, Assist me here, for I in vain have striven!” Louder and sweeter rang the glorious Voice, “Has one, then, wakened up to feel my breath? All holy spirits in your choirs rejoice; Another soul is saved from bonds and death!” The Spirit was beside me dazzling bright; It burned the way before me through that wall; And I was free beneath the heaven of night, Nor felt the barrier I passed thro' at all: But looking back could see a wall-veil then, As smooth as glass, opaquely black as jet, Towering on high beyond my farthest ken; But know not by what name to call it yet. As one who almost swooning drinks of wine, I drank in deep the universal air And glorious freedom of the world divine; Then fell down worshipping the Splendour there. It raised me gently as a wounded dove,— “Revere, but worship not, a fellow soul: Adore the Infinite Wisdom, Truth, and Love, The life and breath and being of the Whole.” It was compact of such intense pure flame, That still mine eyes were shut to It, in sooth; The ardour from It thrilled through all my frame Like new and purer blood, new life, new youth. It kissed my brow with such a ravishment Of burning bliss that half I swooned away, And felt my spirit soaring forth unpent From its dissolving funeral urn of clay. “Henceforward re-assume thy primal dower! I bless thee unto perfect liberty Of holiest faith and love: 'tis in thy power As thou art now, in heart to ever be. “On earth's most miry ways shall slip thy feet, This brow itself may catch the evil stain; But faith and love can burn thee pure and sweet: —Farewell, until we may unite again!” How did these gracious words beneficent Fill me with dread and agony!—I cried, “Great Spirit, if it be Thy blest intent To save me truly, leave not yet my side! “Stay with me yet awhile, Deliverer, Thou!— I am too weak with chains, too blind with gloom, For unassisted life; left lonely now, I must relapse into that hideous tomb. “Or at the least, disrobe awhile Thy form Of its too much effulgence, that my sight May meet Thy face; and so thro' every storm Preserve one Guiding-star, one Beacon-light.” “Because I burn in my pure nakedness, Thou canst not meet me with thy mortal gaze . . . Thy prayer is granted: a material dress, A form of shadowing gloom my soul arrays.” Oh bliss! I saw Her thro' the sevenfold veil;— A mighty Seraph shining ruby-clear, Clothed in majestic wings of golden mail; A sun within the midnight atmosphere. But still her countenance I scarce could scan, For living glories of the golden hair, And rapture of the eyes cerulean As solemn summer heavens burning bare. Around her head a crystal circlet shone, Fore-crested with a pure white flying dove: In emeralds and in sapphires writ thereon, Athwart the brow, one word was flaming,—Love. And when she spoke her voice was now so sweet In soft low music, tremulous with sighs, That one might dreaming hear his Mother greet With such a voice his soul to Paradise. “He is so weak, so weak who should be strong, Weak as a babe, faint-hearted, almost blind; The curse of previous bondage clingeth long: He must not lapse into that den behind. “The sun indeed shines ever in the sky: But when the realm is turned from him to night, When moon and stars gleam faint and cold on high Or else are veiled by stormy clouds from sight; “The traveller then through field and sombre wood Finds his own poor dim lamp best guide his feet; The man at home his household taper good For useful light, his household fire for heat. “Celestial flowers are set in earthly clay: However small the circle of a life, If it be whole it shall expand for aye; And all the Heavens are furled in Man and Wife. “So thou, the man, the circle incomplete, Shalt find thy other segment and be whole; Thy manhood with her womanhood shall meet And form one perfect self-involving soul. “Thy love shall grow by feeling day by day Celestial love, thro' human, blessing thee; Thy faith wax firm by witnessing alway Triumphant faith for ever glad and free. “By her obedience thy soul shall learn How far humility transcendeth pride; By her pure intuitions shall discern The fatal flaws of reason unallied. “Thou shalt see strength in weakness conquering, The bravest action with the tenderest heart, Self-sacrifice unconscious hallowing The lightest playing of the meanest part. “Chastity, purity, and holiness Shall shame thy virile grossness; and the power Of beauty in the spirit and its dress Reveal all virtue lovely as a flower. “Till love for her shall teach thee love for all; Till perfect reverence for her shall grow To faith in God which nothing can appal, Tho' His green world be dark with sin and woe. “Children, by all they are to glad and grieve, Shall teach thee what a loving Father is, And how to give is better than receive:— I bless thee with all household charities. “A priceless boon! and, like such boons to men, A glorious blessing or a fatal curse: Thou canst not sink back into yon vile den; Sinking at all, thou sinkest to a worse.” When thus her words were ended, it might seem That I was lapsing from a heavenly trance Into some scarce less blissful earthly dream, So wonderfully did a change advance. Her supernatural beauty grew less bright, Tho' scarce less beautiful; the fiery name Died out like fire; the wings of flashing light Were slowly back-withdrawn into her frame. The Spirit of the empyréan Heaven Was incarnated into human birth, The purest Seraph of the loftiest Seven Became a maiden of this lower earth. Yet still she was the same, thus different: The pinions there, tho' not put forth in power; The glory there, tho' in the body pent;— Both sheathed thus safely till the fitting hour: And in her mien, and on her face and brow, And in her violet eyes, as clear the sign Of Love supreme and infinite shone now As when it blazed in jewel fires divine. I woke. A tender hand all silently Had drawn the curtain and dispersed the gloom; The whole triumphant morning in a sea Of warmth and splendour dazzled thro' the room. The dearest face, the best-belovèd eyes, Were shining down upon me where I lay;— Aglow with love and rapturous surprise, Seeing my fever was all passed away. November 1859. A FESTIVAL OF LIFE “The One remains, the many change and pass; Heaven's light for ever shines, Earth's shadows fly; Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass, Stains the white radiance of Eternity, Until Death tramples it to fragments ?” Shelley's Adonais. The wind, in long gusts roaring, Over the sea-waste hurled with passionate might The torrent-rush of ponderous rain down-pouring Through that unbounded darkness of wild night. . . . I gazed into the tumult; seeing naught; But mastered by it into solemn thought, Such as can seldom brood in garish day,— Whose myriad sounds and forms and hues Their sparkling sensual wine infuse, Till the soul drowses in its drunken clay. Night scorns to pamper fleshly ears and eyes With earth's poor store of fleeting luxuries, Appealing to the Soul alone In its stupendous Monotone, Austerely murmuring spells of timeless mysteries. Long sightlessly outgazing I stood, when through the cloven dark, behold, A dome of purest crystal lifted, blazing With living splendours—purple, jasper, gold, And crowning all, serenely arched on high, A solemn depth of sapphire like a sky. Far-piercing tremulous lines of watery light And sheeted lustres wild and riven, Like sunset glories tempest-driven, It pours against the streaming gloom of night. Sustaining this aërial canopy White marble columns gleam unsteadfastly; Yet by its hovering poise in air, It seems self-borne to revel there, Surmounting furious blasts over the lurid sea. I stand by it envaulted. . . . The palace thrills throughout from dome to floor In swells of jubilant harmony, exalted By the storm's intermittent clash and roar: How the full volumes of orchestral sound Outsurge continuously and sweep around! As clouds by winds, see, swayed by their sweet measure, All floating, gliding, sinking, heaving, The countless Masquers interweaving An Iris-coloured maze of dizzy pleasure About the sea-like floor of marble green, All waved with multitudinous waves, whose sheen And restless shades the vision cheats; They seem to flow beneath the feet Which thrid that graceful dance of festive life serene. Around the shorelike border, Opening to arched recess and far aisle dim, The feast-spread tables range in stately order. What golden bowls, a-tremble to the brim, Beneath the lamps in constellations shine With jewels and the jewel-gleams of wine! What fruits are clustered into glorious piles Throughout the feast's magnificence, On whose uncumbered affluence Flowers shed the grace of their ethereal smiles! Round the broad tables sumptuous couches flow, Soft as June clouds, suffused with many a glow, Of crimson, amber, violet dark: Deep-dyed from each recess's arc The massy curtains fall, down-sweeping full and low. And children sport there tameless. . . . O happy, happy children! happier far, Possessed by unsought joyance free and aimless, Than those tall masks with laboured pleasures are. Through feast and dance they flit with shining faces, Wreathing, unwreathing, in capricious chases, With ringing laughters at their own swift wiles. And yet a few, of strange grave mood, Pace in shadowy solitude Those many-columned labyrinthine aisles, Which, opening through the oriels, link to zone The gem-bright feast with dark grey caverned stone: Though scarcely man or woman dares That dusk instinct with lightning-glares, Down whose far desert vistas waves and tempest moan. The dome's broad-soaring lustres Are poised upon one massive coil of gold; A ruby-crested serpent, starred with clusters Of flashing gems; its mighty bulk outrolled In cyclic rest for ever; while, consumed, The End in the Beginning lies entombed: Gorgeous the symbol of Eternity! The grand pilastered sweep of wall Lives and glows around the hall, Divinely pictured; earth and sea and sky Have yielded the best grandeurs and delights Of all their rolling seasons, days and nights, To make these fields of space expand Into an infinite Wonder-land By their infinitude of dream-surpassing sights. Sculptures serenely gracious From out the flowing draperies' regal dyes, Around the banquet-circle cool and spacious, Gleam half-revealed to my enchanted eyes. How can the festival flow undelayed Amidst the heavenly visions here displayed? How is it not rapt still, in breathless trance?— What scenes of rock, field, sky and sea, Flung round in infinite harmony!— That wood where uncouth creatures sport and dance In the weird dimness streaked with silvern rays: That Eden quivering in the noontide blaze, Nymphs languid in its fountain-bowers: That sea-built City's domes and towers Consuming in the Sunset's slow-breathed fiery haze! “Evohe! our high Palace! We dance, we dance, with dance-exulting feet! We grow immortal, draining bowl and chalice Of this life-burning wine-blood nectar-sweet, And banqueting on this ambrosial food! While ever and anon, in rapturous mood Outstealing from the revel, pair by pair Hide far within some dim recess, And, faint with fervid eagerness, Unlock the wildering wealth of love they share! What though black Night inspheres us,—storm and rain Assaulting this fair Heaven with fury vain? Our-music-storm poured strong and fast Can balance well the outer blast, And yon resplendent dome for evermore sustain!” With clash of wine-cups ringing, So rose from flower-crowned feasters swaying there The fervent Pæan, swelled with choral singing By many a gallant Knight and lady fair. What strength of wisdom and sure self-reliance Could make these bold to fling such gay defiance To all the dreadful Powers of ancient Night?— These—pigmies swarming in the deep Beneath their own dome's burning sweep; These—motes invisible beneath Heaven's height! But ere was ended the impetuous song, A tremor ran electric through the throng: With pallid cheek and restless eye, With urgent voices loud and high, Fear made them more and more the vauntful strains prolong. “Ha! what a burst of thunder! How the swift lightnings blanched our splendours pale! Reweave the links of dance, too long asunder! Let loose again the music's lifeful gale! . . . But who are these, this never-bidden Pair, Unnoticed while our joy-song dimmed the air? Who are these masked in such mysterious wise? What twain of all our company Are missing from the revelry?— They have assumed this melancholy guise To shed fantastic wildness on our sport. All here!—then who are Ye, not of our court? Whence come ye? wherefore thus invade Our blissful brightness with the shade Of sombre masks and robes, and joy-contemning port?” Silent and dark and solemn,— While the mixed tumult of amazement died In deep hushed awe,—firm-planted as the column Of dusky-splendid porphyry at their side, The Strangers stood, absorbing all the scene With slow calm eyes and wonder-baffling mien; Two awful Spirits of the outer Night! For age-like moments that ensued The Saturnalian multitude Was frozen into marble undelight; Continued numb with terror,—lost and drowned In that weird breathless agony profound, Like a Nightmare's stifling pain Crushing, maddening heart and brain, When utter, monstrous Silence yawns like death around, Till life, resurgent, tingled In burning blood through every shrunken vein; And one deep panting from all breasts commingled To mark remission of that deadly strain And over tension of the subtle strings Whose music is the life of living things. . . . Again with joy and power from secret caves The full dance-harmonies outstreaming Woke the Masquers from their dreaming, Again they floated on the buoyant waves. And all, it seemed, with fiercer yearning thirst, Triumphant o'er the pallid swoon now burst, Seized the fiery cup of bliss Mantling high to greet their kiss; And in delirious draughts awe doubt, and fear immerst. The dim voluptuous languor Of clouds surcharged with perfumes, slow and dense, Uprolled from precious burnings, veiled the clangour, The harmonised confusion grown intense, Reckless, and surging with a wild desire Most keenly hungered when most fed, like fire; —Veiled the vast revel, even from their seeing, Whose Bacchic frenzy broken loose Was now the element profuse That breathed it into such portentous being. And few of all involved in this rich screen Saw now the Strangers of mysterious mien; Whose dark intolerable eyes Burned through the tumult and disguise, Commanding like Omniscience all the wildered scene. But power to me was given To see, to pierce the gloomy robes austere, Which (as our world's gross night hides Hell and Heaven, From mortals sick with longing, wild with fear) Concealed these Two in undistinguished shade. I saw the Vision of a Queen, arrayed In midnight purple laced with snowy cloud, Which as her bosom heaved shone far With purest jewels, star on star. . . . Grand Queen; dread Pythoness: her tall form bowed: Transcendent beauty lost in desolate grace: Her long dark hair thrown down about a face So pale with awful mysteries Of perfect love and woe and bliss, That my own heart grew wild panting for her embrace. But, Heaven be our protection Against the Demon standing at Her side!— By what dread lunacies of blind affection, Or monstrous Destiny to Her allied! Infernal Horror!—His rent forehead crowned With hideous snakes writhing and interwound, A many crested coil distinguishless; While through black cloud with red fire seared His vast and fleshless frame appeared Momently shuddering into Nothingness. On His disfeatured face was stamped a grin Of unimagined foulness, hate and sin, Anguish, greed, and rage and scorn, And fiendish triumph most forlorn. . . . Thus stood They side by side amidst the festal din. Wilder and ever wilder The revel surged beneath its glowing dome; And still the outside rage grew ever wilder, As if all powers that have in Night their home, Lightning and thunder, rain and stormy blast, Held their wild revel in its sightless vast. . . . Then those Two Shapes were moved from stony rest; And, keeping still their sable shroud, Moved forward mingling with the crowd; Each with a strange keen eagerness represt. He seized an aged yet carousing Knight; She kissed a young girl's forehead drooping white; These dancing linked in languid grace, Those hurrying forth with swerveless pace, Soon through a curtained portal passed from out our sight. These rose shrill lamentation From revellers fixed awaiting their return; Inexplicable grief and consternation Possessed them,—dread yet keen desire to learn The fate of those led forth so suddenly; And tremulous murmurings spread. . . . Then all might see Those Shapes mysterious coming back alone. . . . The Silence gave one reckless shout, “The Knight was old and wearied out, The Maid was sick and faint some hours agone: These have but ushered them to rest and peace, In sooth full kindly—But why therefore cease The banquet and the dance? Away! Every moment of delay Is squandered from our joy's brief unreturning lease.” The rude spell fearless-hearted Swayed back the riant feast-joy's ebbing flood: But one—the Lover of the girl departed— Approached the Woman desperately, and sued With passion such as will not be denied For reunition with his promised bride. She led him forth in Her divine embrace; And then returned without the boy, Inspired by some exalted joy, Which shone with holy splendour in Her face, And bounded in Her port and heaved Her breast. . . . But of the remnant every one represt In silence of uneasy thought The wonder that within him wrought: The mystery had power to awe down open quest. Thenceforth a voice of wailing, Of grief that spurned all comfort, still increast, For dear ones lost for ever, countervailing The shouted songs and laughters of the feast; Whose wine ran like a mountain rill, which grows In strong and swift abundance as it flows. For the dread Strangers thinned the joyous rout; With stern and Fateful ministry Removing almost momently Man, woman, child, youth, maid,—selected out By some inscrutable and lawless law. Many to Her went willingly, I saw; And fascinated by the bliss Of Her tender, holy kiss, Welcomed with solemn joy their doom's mysterious awe. But it was shameful, fearful, To mark of those He gestured to His side How many shrank, with ravings wildly tearful Of idiot pleas; while stalwart feastmen cried “Grant us but one more hour of wine-fired glee! Others may fail; but we, Iacchus! we Could mount high revels with the mounting sun.” A few with high-wrought calmness grand Took His stretched imperious hand, And seemed, though then all powerless and undone, To cope with His Omnipotence of Fate, Yielding at once with undissembled hate. But trembling wretches clustered near, Already summoned forth by Fear To time-destroying pangs no doom could aggravate. O infinite tempest raging! O awful Visitants from Heaven and Hell! These mortals scorn and mock your dark presaging, And wreak high feast-strains on their own deep knell. See, through the clouds of incense wildly glancing, What Mœnads with wild cries are wildly dancing! All masks off-torn, their white limbs flash and shine, Flung out tossing through the whirls; Dishevelled tresses, wanton curls, A-flame with flowers and dripping crimson wine, Brush naked bosoms with their fiery trace,— White, perfect breasts, full-swelled to the embrace Which those wild eyes of humid light Fiercely passionate now invite:— The Palace, through their whirlwind, seems to reel in space. Alas, how sad and dreary Waned the whole scene there as the Night grew late! When many of the Masquers, sick and weary, Lay longing that those Ministers of Fate Would choose them for removal: when of all Whom They had taken from the festival No one returned; though mourners fiercely craved The never answering Shapes of Black To bring them, but a moment, back, And on the threshold of the Night-storm waved Their feeble torches, quenched as soon as lit, Seeking lost darlings through the Infinite: And when at times some dreadful ghost, Imaging the loved and lost, Would through the startled feast with bodeful gestures flit. . . . The lamps were quickly failing; The pictures were weird shadows on the wall; In the grey stone-cold dawn-gleams unprevailing The draperies seemed a vast funereal pall Flapping about the corpselike sculptures wan: The floor, the cupola which glimmering shone, The rain-dark marbles, in the tempest thrilled: Where late the noble feast was spread Lay scattered flower-blooms dim and dead, 'Mid stains of sullen-oozing wine outspilled From urns and goblets shattered and o'erthrown, And fragments in a sick confusion strown; And lost in all the ghastly waste, On couches tottering and displaced, Flushed victims of the orgy, helpless, senseless, prone. Yet evermore those Strangers Went gathering in their harvest; and no less, As men who face to face with deadly dangers Inebriate their terror and distress, A few kept up the revel with a madness Of reeling, shrieking glee which was not gladness. Till—portents of the near approaching Doom— Wailings, laughters, wild and fierce, Through the storm-swung darkness pierce, And spectres people the dull flickering gloom. . . . A deep foreboding hush pervades the place: To that dis-covered Twain in one wild race All reel along the quaking floor: There grows a mighty booming roar, As I am rapt away into the outer space. With storm and fire and thunder These rearward billows of Night's Ocean dash Against the Palace: it is rent asunder, Rent, shattered, with an instantaneous crash. On, undelayed, exultingly they sweep, Whirling its fragments through their wild waste deep: Precipitant in their stupendous sway The glowing fragments crystalline, Gold, jewels, precious marbles, shine Like showering meteors; high and far away, Portentous, the Snake's blazing wheel is borne, In dalliance with the lightnings whose fierce scorn Smites into view wan wailing shades . . . The whole Night-Chaos hurrying fades Over the livid sea, before the dismal morn. “O utter desolation! O blighted beauty, splendour, triumph, bliss! Alas, the gay and thoughtless congregation Flung out unsheltered to the dark Abyss! Bright Vision faded! never more can shine A joy-insphering Palace so divine.” Lamenting thus, I sank in sleep or swoon. . . . I wake—The isle and ocean spread Level and bare: but overhead The solemn Heaven of sapphire-burning noon Has bent its dome's immeasurable height; A few calm clouds o'erfraught with living light Melt in the quivering crystalline; Beneath the Eternal Sun divine, Insphering half the world in glory and delight. This is the Vision solely, Trancing all aspiration with content! Beauty all-perfect, blessedness all-holy, Are veiled beyond that crystal firmament. The breathless concave yearneth to the Hymn Of all the Hosts of Stars and Seraphim; The Hallelujah's raptured Monotone, To whose vast swell the world-strown Sea Of Æther throbs eternally, Circling the footstool of that nameless Throne Whose veil's far shadow floods this noon with light. . . . —O self-sequestered Earth! O gross, weak sight! For which beneath such heavenly day Yawneth fathomless for aye A spectre-haunted gulf of Sphere-completing Night. February 1857. TASSO TO LEONORA FROM HIS DUNGEON; IN MISERY AND DISTRACTION. “Ha! thy frozen pulses flutter With a love thou dar'st not utter. . . . Lady, whose imperial brow Is endiademed with woe! All the wide world beside us Show like multitudinous Puppets passing from a scene; What but mockery can they mean?” Shelley—Misery; a Fragment. Noblest Lady, throned above All my soaring hopes of love; Could you read my fate's dark truth, You would give me scornless ruth. Dawn by dawn I wake to say,— I will drive all thought away Of Her I cannot hope to win; Vain regret is coward sin. Yet each night I yearn to be Wandering far alone with thee, Through still Dreamland's dimmest grove Moonlit by thy heavenly love. Ah, the long days dark and cold! Life, bereft of thee, unsouled— Save for Memory!—crawls on slow, One sick swoon of barren woe. Ah, the long nights dreadly still! When sleep flies my frantic will; When through filmy dreams its sting Consciousness darts quivering. But when rich Sleep's nectared balm Bathes my weary heart in calm; Life, Strength, Joy are all re-found, With thy pure love glory-crowned. Thus thou hast my soul unsphered; Waking life is dead and weird; Deathlike trance is life:—ah me! All our being seems to be Interfused with mockery. Yes—as Love is truer far Than all other things; so are Life and Death, the World and Time, Mere false shows in some great Mime, By dreadful mystery sublime. Do not scorn me, Sweet, I crave; Perhaps this woe may somewhat rave: Yet how should It?—I can feel Truth itself at times less real. Do not scorn me,—for behold! Near and nearer swiftly rolled Solemn glooms of that great Night No false Day shall dawn to blight. Then the everlasting sleep, Shall our souls in rapture steep, Then in tranced Eternity Thou shalt be made One with me! Play our parts out in this Mime!— Spectres mocking spectral Time, Whose grim mockery keeps us hurled Reeling through our spectral World. What a Theatre expands! For its Stage all seas and lands; By the moon and high stars lit; Vaulted by the Infinite. Heavens! and I must bear a part, With my restless passionate heart Coffined in this foul dead den From the surging seas of men. Well . . . we all must act our time On the unreal Stage sublime; None of us is what he seems, Dramatising frenzy-dreams. By such monsters fleered, stung, tost, In such wildering mazes lost; How superbly serious all Threads the restless, senseless brawl Of our rabid Carnival! Noble, beautiful, serene, Thou must play the part of Queen; Crowned with unreal gems and gold, Phantom purples round thee rolled. Sweep with stately step the stage; Act great passions, love and rage, With yon crowd of half-souled things Masked as nobles, princes, kings. I must act a wretch forlorn, Wealthless, rankless, lowly born; Cursed more with a soul and sense Bounteous, regal, too intense: Ay, a woeful Wretch indeed; Say a starved incarnate Need, Ever with consummate art In his strange half-tragic part Living on an empty heart! Well, Dear, brief must be our task; Little matters in what mask We may rant our mimic rage On our unsubstantial Stage. So, Sweet Love, sustain your rôle, Freeze the pulses of your soul; Fair, grand, queenly dignified, Case yourself in marble pride. I—the while,—by evidence Of my purest love intense, Sure that when the Play is o'er You are mine for evermore— I will madly waste and moan, Pouring out against thy throne All my life of love,—flung back In wild foam o'er gulfs of black. Let some hollow princely mask, In thine Alpine sunshine bask; Blight me with well-feignèd scorn Let me pine and rage forlorn: Have it counted lunacy, My audacious love for Thee! In a lazar-dungeon thrust, Make me mad to prove you just. Brava, Dearest! noble, grand! Played with wondrous self-command! O great Theatre world-filled, Whom her spell holds rapt and thrilled, Shout the plaudits too long stilled! I, too,—do not I act well All the horrors of this Hell? Act so well, Love, that I feel Sometimes as if all were real! What a sickly, foolish fear! Love soon re-assures me, Dear: I must ape such anguish vile With an inward settled smile. Do I seem to writhe with pain Under thy assumed disdain? Do I seem, indeed, to be Far too mean for hope of thee? Do I really seem to brood In this dark den's solitude, Frenzied by the fœtid gloom Of such hideous living tomb? Do I seem to cringe, and crave Mercy from the poor dull slave, Who, disguised in sceptered power, Acts thy brother for the hour? Yet I scorn him: and serene, Far above this mimic scene With its shows of Space and Time, Dwell with thee in love sublime. Ah! your part so grand and fine Must be harder yet than mine; Bitter, but to seem, in sooth, False to love's eternal truth: Ah! you have my saddest ruth. Still, our parts are so forth writ In this Mime whose venomed wit Our poor wits so far transcends. On its acting life depends, Wild it is, but soon it ends. Joy! the Play must soon be done! Then the lamps called Stars and Sun Shall be quenched in perfect gloom By the grand foreclosing Doom; Then the Stage of land and sea Shall down-vanish utterly; Then the fretted azure roof Roll off like a burning woof; Then the serried multitude Surge out in a vast dim flood;— All, all fade and vanish quite, Leaving void and silent Night. Then, once more alone, my Sweet, We shall in the strange dark meet: You will doff your tinselled pride, I shall throw my rags aside. Then in silent darkness deep Comes the everlasting sleep, Comes the inexpressive bliss Of our union's perfectness! Time's loud turbid stream shall flow, With its perils, strife and woe, Far from where our Soul then lies Tranced in still Eternities: Tho', soft breathed from far away, Its dim soothing murmurs may Lull us to profounder rest, Swaying with the Ocean's breast. For we seek home after this; Clinging with a fonder kiss For the parting which so pained, For the cold neglect you feigned. We two only,—Woman, Man, Wedded ere the Mime began, Heaven-created Man and Wife For our whole true timeless life: Soul of soul and heart of heart; Each alone a wretched part, Lifeless, useless, maimed, unright, Ever yearning to unite In the perfect spheral Whole, Living, self-sufficient Soul, Swayed through Æther crystalline Circling restful in the shine Of the central Sun Divine. . . . What, although this trance at times Must be broken by such mimes? What, though we must earn by these Our reposeful ecstasies? Dearest, all the false cold days, With their bitter mocking Plays, Swiftly die to glorious Night When we meet in new delight. So two actors, Man and Wife, Mimic freely rage and strife, Suffering, terror, madness, death Whatsoe'er the fable saith: Earning thus wherewith to feed That which is their life indeed,— Long, calm, rich with love intense, Secret from the shallow sense Of the blatant audience. Ah, my weak bewildered heart! Do I act my monstrous part With too earnest lifelike truth?— Darling, bless me with thy ruth. Yes, at times my heart is torn By thy well-pretended scorn: Soothe this foolish heart of mine With some secret loving sign. Perhaps it feeleth Love to be Of such sacred verity, That thy merely feigned untruth Frets it like a serpent-tooth. Grant it some dear secret sign Which no other can divine,— But a word, a flower, to prove That you are my own, own Love. Act thy strange part not so well;— Even now, with pangs of Hell, I dread that your neglect is true, Doubting you, my Soul's Soul, you! But I strangle such base doubt. . . . How the drear plot lingers out! What a Chaos, baffling thought; Real with spectral interwrought! . . . Lo, the wondrous Universe! Hear its mystic powers rehearse Sweet and subtle melodies, Vast and solemn harmonies. Glorious shifting sceneries, see; And the dome's infinity, Lamp'd by all the rhythmic quires Of those unconsuming fires! Mark the stony Fate that broods, Mark the angel multitudes, Watching for the tragic range Of impassioned strife and change. O sublimest Theatre! Vexed with the insensate stir Of this doleful Mime distraught, By such pigmy puppets wrought. Pigmies: and they feel it well, While their hollow vauntings swell: How uneasily they roam Through its grandeurs, not at home!— Restless in its crystal calms, Trembling at its thunder-psalms, Cowering from its noon-poured light, Shuddering through its scenic night. How their poor rants quail and die Far beneath its solemn sky! How their clouds of passion all, Tumid grandeurs, burst and fall From its deep-based mountain-wall! Blood and filth defile the Stage, Filth of lust and blood of rage; Which they will not understand Are but self-pollution, and Suicide at second-hand. Every one there, bad or good, Is by all misunderstood, Knowing not himself,—yet strives To scheme the law for countless lives. Each is different from each, None hears right another's speech: Yet all fume and fight for aye, With anguish, hatred, death, dismay, To make others be as they. Every step they take perplext Taints the freedom of the next; Every thought and word and deed Curbeth all that shall succeed: Yet they still must move, nor pause, By the Drama's rigorous laws; Yet no true Life can there be Save in thoughts and deeds quite free. There work foolish Hate and Ill, Eager, subtle, fierce of will; Good and Love, alas, behold, Flagging, wavering, languish cold.— Love!—O Seraphs looking down, Who of all that wear the crown, That have won the sacred kiss Which should symbol Love's pure bliss, Even dream what true Love is? Sternly real the galling pain Of the vanquished bondman's chain; But the Victor's diadem Ever lacks its crowning gem. Nearly all the noblest parts Ruined by bad heads or hearts; Those in whom redemption lies Chained, with cankering energies, From sublime activities. Each aspiring burst, swayed back, Soon plods round the old drear track; Hope dies,—strangled in the knot Of such ever-ravelled plot. Did no sequent acts extend On unto a perfect End Far beyond these brief life-days, What a hopeless, ghastly maze! Yes! did'st Thou not light the scene, Leonora, O my Queen! One deep sigh would rend my heart, “Oh, that I had had no part!” . . . As it is,—to keep, perchance, Sane amid the dizzy dance— Muse I this fixed truth sublime, All is but a mocking Mime. Yet foul demons in my ear Hiss most wordless hints of fear,— That this hideous dream's wild strife Is our soul's substantial life! How the moment's thought appals!— That these stifling dungeon-walls Are of real during stone; That I fester here alone; That you cannot be my own! No; it is a fiendish lie. God our Father reigns on high: You are truer than my faith. . . . Oh, were life untwined from death! But, you cannot scorn me, Dear, Though I sink in doubt and fear? You too know, this mad Mime done, We shall evermore be one? Cling, cling fast to this dear faith, Rock of life in sea of death: Our mazed web of doom is wrought Under God's directing thought. For were life no flitting dream, Were things truly what they seem, Were not all this World-scene vast But a shade in Time's stream glass'd; Were the moods we now display Less phantasmal than the clay, In which our poor spirits clad Act this Vision, wild and sad, I must be mad, mad,—how mad! November 1856. A HAPPY POET Driven by mysterious care and restless pain The World rolls round me full of noise and strife, Racking what is not loss to dubious gain: I live apart my self-fulfilling life Serenely happy, breathing golden air Unvext by these dark storms of pain and care. The tumult whirls for ever to and fro: I see it all in vision; strangely wild And incoherent, yet by some rich glow Of vigour, thought and passion reconciled; Its mystery also, wherein dreams Delight, Brings dear old friends, tho' dimly, back to sight. O happy-dowered Soul! whom God doth call To life's imperial Banquet as a guest Greeted with gladness in its lofty Hall; Bathed clean and cool, sprinkled with odours, drest In fair white folds of free and flowing grace, The festal raiment of the splendid place; Who then is couched 'midst wise and valiant friends, In place of honour near the glorious Throne Wherefrom the Host such kingly welcome sends That all may feel His treasures all their own; And who is further gifted to divine The subtlest savours of the fruit and wine. Is it not strange? I could more amply tell Such woes of men as I discern or dream, Than this great happiness I know so well, Which is in truth profounder than they seem; And which abides for ever pure and deep, Beneath all dreams of wakefulness or sleep. For this whole world so vast and complicate, With every being nourished on its breast, With all its mighty workings-out of Fate, With that one Soul in all its life exprest, Must surely all be mine, and mine alone; Its power and joy are so indeed my own. Spring, summer, autumn, winter, float for aye, Weaving continually their wondrous robe, Of purple Night inwrought with golden Day About our earth, whose calm and mighty globe Through all the World-strown æther crystalline Floats ever circling round the sun divine. The faint voluptuous trance of summer noon, Young spring's blithe tenderness so green and fair, The golden wealth of quiet autumn boon, The star-keen life of winter glittering bare, Carol harmonious beauty and delight, And proffer all their treasures as my right. The birds rejoice in singing for my joy, And shaking sunshine thro' the clustered leaves: A brain that never plotteth them annoy, A heart that loves them and their injury grieves Swift bird and beast and jewelled insect free Full well can trust; one brotherhood are we. The flowers all love me, and the trees befriend; Lily and rose are eager to impart By fragrance, colour, or some perfect bend, Delicious secrets that surprise my heart; I muse beneath the forests, and they are With all their countless tongues oracular. Snow-vested mountains mighty and austere Persuade me: Climb us from thy lowly home, And we will be thine Altars; offer here From our pure silence to yon naked dome Thy sacrificial thoughts, in breathless awe And adoration of Eternal Law. And evermore old Ocean murmurs me: Come forth, and love our heritage, my Child; Safe-cherished on my bosom shalt thou be In death-sweet calms, in tempests dark and wild; Cadence of moonlit waves and mid-sea moan Shall dower thy Voice with many a mystic tone. O vaulted sky, O bounteous land and sea, O perfect World, the Palace and the Shrine Of infinite beauty, truth and mystery, That flood the soul with yearning bliss divine Till it dissolves in their exuberant might, As some frail cloud surcharged with noon's full light. The banquet-hall is noble, and its wine A nectar worthy of Olympian lyres; Solemn and sacred is the infinite shrine, With stars immortal for its altar-fires; Yet shrine and palace are scarce noticed things When all the guests and worshippers are kings: Imperial all; each freer than the sun Doth live and move, supreme, self-centred, sole; And yet they are my people, every one; My life of heart and brain is in the whole; Their hopes, fears, woes, joys, virtues, sins, despairs, Their full-orbed lives are mine no less than theirs. The stern exultance of the thoughtful youth Enrolled against the tyrants of his land; The noblest victor's self-contemning ruth When fireless eye must gaze on bloody hand; The greed of power, the sateless lust of pride, Whence kingly robes in blood are purple-dyed; The deep complacency of subtle skill In ravelled games, though winning wins a loss; The drear perversity with which one's will With wretched consciousness persists to cross His own best good, his dearest friends' best prayers, Devouring sullenly their generous cares; The fogs of fear in which their fellows loom Like threatening monsters, and the firm earth yields; The mists of hope and love-joy which illume With golden strangeness their poor homes and fields; The sophistries of passion-moulded thought By which they use to make “I would,” “I ought:” Free childhood's life, so rich it need not ask Poor thought to justify its flower-fresh grace; Youth's yearning tumult when the constant mask Seems falling first from Nature's glorious face, The infinite joy and sadness of its strife To probe the awful secrets of our life; The firm deliberate strength of manhood's prime, Appraising well the World, its smiles and frowns,— Yet for the spoils and triumphs of this Time Ceding the heirship of eternal crowns; Old age with Heaven's first rays upon its brow, Yet clinging feebly to the worn-out Now: His nature who from action will refrain In plenitude of spiritual thought, And his who keepeth every nerve a-strain In constant labour, hope and fear distraught; (In thought's pure æther float all worlds of life; The cold eye sees, warm being lives through strife): Those eagle spirits native to the skies Who drink the Sun's bare splendour, and contemn Such painted screens as unanointed eyes Must interpose between His shine and them,— The veils and imageries through which their sense Alone can bear the formless light intense; (But Suns shine spheric to the eagle-eye, Though formless to the owlet-sight, when bare): The soul opprest with its humanity, Which must have God's most personal love and care; The self-ruled souls, that need not supplicate, Feeling themselves divine and peers of Fate: All, all are mine, are Me. How vast the Stage! Imperious Doom, unvanquishable Will, Throughout the Drama constant battle wage; The Plot evolves with tangled good and ill; The passions overflood the shores of Time; With God the full Solution waits sublime. If I so much contemplate all the scene As if to pleasure me the whole were wrought, I gaze upon the actors great and mean With reverent love, with unaccusing thought; Their wails and curses are mine own no less Than their most tranquil strains of nobleness. And yet, how ever-gracious is my dower, Whose noon-tide bliss consumes its first alloy Whose midnight woe by some celestial power Enkindles purest stars of solemn joy: My lover glows, the world is all-June bowers; My widower weeps, the tears rain April-showers. For I must sing of all I feel and know; Waiting with Memnon passive near the palms, Until the heavenly light doth dawn and grow And thrill my silence into mystic psalms; From unknown realms the wind streams sad or gay, The trees give voice responsive to its sway. For I must sing; of mountains, deserts, seas, Of rivers ever flowing, ever flowing; Of beasts and birds, of grass and flowers and trees For ever fading and for ever growing; Of calm and storm, of night and eve and noon, Of boundless space, and sun and stars and moon: And of the secret sympathies that bind All beings to their wondrous dwelling-place; And of the perfect Unity enshrined In omnipresence throughout time and space, Alike informing with its full control The dust, the stars, the worm, the human soul: And most supremely of my human kin; Their thoughts and deeds, their valours and their fears, Their griefs and joys, their virtue and their sin, Their feasts and wars, their cradles and their biers, Their temples, prisons, homes and ships and marts, The subtlest windings of their brains and hearts. In all their faiths and sacraments I see Celestial features through the earthly veil, In all their dreams some deep reality, In all their structures beams that cannot fail, In all their thoughts some truth which doth inspire, In all their passions sparks of quenchless fire. For singing, in all thoughts I glimpse the law Ineffable, eternal, veiled behind, And robe it in full verse-folds dark with awe; And singing, in all passions I must find New secrets more impassioned, crowning them With golden words, a fulgent diadem. So heartless gibes of infidel mistrust, And quibblings spun by some poor wretch to snare His conscience into sanction of his lust, Or bind it into cowardly despair, Come forth from me the universal Nay That limits all our life's triumphant Yea. So softest sighings of a maiden's heart When first Love's fingers touch the trembling chords, Thrill through my soul with their delicious smart, And fly abroad from me new-winged with words So bright and beautiful and swift to soar That all must love them now and evermore. I sing, I sing, rejoicing in the singing, And men all love me for my songs so sweet, Even as they love the rapturous lark upspringing And singing loud his joy the sun to greet; O happiest lot, to win all love and blessing For that whose own delight is past expressing! Are men in truth not joyous strong and whole, But lofty strains thro' broken lyres expressed? My frame is all attunèd to my soul, My limbs are glad to do my mind's behest; To wander through the wide realm many a day As free as thoughts that wander every way: To climb the mountain brow thro' moonlit gloom, With vigorous breathing of its lonely air, And watch the trancèd dawn from out her tomb To perfect resurrection waking there: To revel through the storm when fire and rain And thunder make a man all heart and brain: To pierce the inmost heart of solemn woods, Where our great Mother coucheth grand and dim, And baring her full breast in solitudes, Suckles each child as if she had but him, With that same milk magnificent and bold Whence Gods and Titans drew their strength of old; To plunge away from earth on lonely shores And breast the green sea-surges foaming strong, Free as an eagle when it sways and soars The billows of the tempest-sea among; To sail alone the deep, past rocks and caves, From isle to isle upon the heaving waves: To row adown great rivers from their rills, Gliding thro' dawn and eve and noon and night, Winding between the patient woods and hills, The broad green meadows, fields and gardens bright; Past homesteads each sole-sacred as a star Gleaming thro' clustered foliage near and far; Past peaceful hamlets loosely gathered round Their spires still pointing from the graves to God;— Past rich and mighty cities far-renowned, So overcharged with life the soul is awed To think but of such massed intensity; And so into the earth-surrounding sea. How the rich days of life and joy and light, The unregretful, unforeboding days, Usher me softly into solemn night; Then sleep her spell divine upon me lays, And I am tranced and fed with perfect rest, Or wander far through dreamland, fancy-blest. Then, when the night's dusk curtains are withdrawn, And sleep dissolves her spell of mysteries, With what eternal freshness each new dawn Greets me with fair and golden promises! While born anew and young with day's new birth I hear the lark out-trill my infinite mirth. So rich and sweet is Life. And what is death? The tranquil slumbers dear and strange and boon That feed at whiles our waking being's breath; The solemn midnight of this glorious noon, With countless distant stars, and each a sun, Revealed harmonious with our daily one. 1857: 1859. THE LORD OF THE CASTLE OF INDOLENCE Nor did we lack our own right royal king, The glory of our peaceful realm and race. By no long years of restless travailing, By no fierce wars or intrigues bland and base, Did he attain his superlofty place; But one fair day he lounging to the throne Reclined thereon with such possessing grace That all could see it was in sooth his own, That it for him was fit and he for it alone. He there reclined as lilies on a river, All cool in sunfire, float in buoyant rest; He stirred as flowers that in the sweet south quiver; He moved as swans move on a lake's calm breast, Or clouds slow gliding in the golden west; He thought as birds may think when 'mid the trees Their joy showers music o'er the brood-filled nest; He swayed us all with ever placid ease As sways the thronèd moon her world-wide wandering seas. Look, as within some fair and princely hall The marble statue of a god may rest, Admired in silent reverence by all; Soothing the weary brain and anguished breast, By life's sore burthens all-too-much oppressed, With visions of tranquillity supreme; So, self-sufficing, grand and bland and blest, He dwelt enthroned, and whoso gazed did seem Endowed with death-calm life in long unwistful dream. While others fumed and schemed and toiled in vain To mould the world according to their mood, He did by might of perfect faith refrain From any part in such disturbance rude. The world, he said, indeed is very good, Its Maker surely wiser far than we; Feed soul and flesh upon its bounteous food, Nor fret because of ill; All-good is He, And worketh not in years but in Eternity. How men will strain to row against the tide, Which yet must sweep them down in its career! Or if some win their way and crown their pride, What do they win? the desert wild and drear, The savage rocks, the icy wastes austere, Wherefrom the river's turbid rills downflow: But he upon the waters broad and clear, In harmony with all the winds that blow, 'Mid cities, fields and farms, went drifting to and fro. The king with constant heed must rule his realm, The soldier faint and starve in marches long, The sailor guide with sleepless care his helm, The poet from sick languors soar in song: But he alone amidst the troubled throng In restful ease diffused beneficence; Most like a mid-year noontide rich and strong, That fills the earth with fruitful life intense, And yet doth trance it all in sweetest indolence. When summer reigns the joyous leaves and flowers Steal imperceptibly upon the tree; So stole upon him all his bounteous hours, So passive to their influence seemed he, So clothed they him with joy and majesty; Basking in ripest summer all his time, We blessed his shade and sang him songs of glee; The dew and sunbeams fed his perfect prime, And rooted broad and deep he broadly towered sublime. Thus could he laugh those great and generous laughs Which made us love ourselves, the world, and him; And while they rang we felt as one who quaffs Some potent wine-cup dowered to the brim, And straightway all things seem to reel and swim,— Suns, moons, earth, stars sweep through the vast profound, Wrapt in a golden mist-light warm and dim, Rolled in a volume of triumphant sound; So in that laughter's joy the whole world carolled round. The sea, the sky, wood, mountain, stream and plain, Our whole fair world did serve him and adorn, Most like some casual robe which he might deign To use when kinglier vesture was not worn. Was all its being by his soul upborne, That it should render homage so complete? The day and night, the even and the morn, Seemed ever circling grateful round his feet, “With Thee, through Thee we live this rich life pure and sweet!” For while he loved our broad world beautiful, His placid wisdom penetrated it, And found the lovely words but poor and dull Beside the secret splendours they transmit, The heavenly things in earthly symbols writ: He knew the blood-red sweetness of the vine, Yet did not therefore at the revel sit; But straining out the very wine of wine, Lived calm and pure and glad in drunkenness divine. Without an effort the imperial sun With ever ample life of light doth feed The spheres revolving round it every one: So all his heart and soul and thought and deed Flowed freely forth for every brother's need; He knew no difference between good and ill, But as the sun doth nourish flower and weed With self-same bounty, he too ever still Lived blessing all alike with equal loving will. The all-bestowing sun is clothed with splendour, The all-supporting sun doth reign supreme; So must eternal justice ever render Each unsought payment to its last extreme: Thus he most rich in others' joy did seem, And reigned by servitude all-effortless; For heaven and earth must vanish like a dream Ere such a soul divine can know distress, Whom all the laws of Life conspire to love and bless. 1859. BERTRAM TO THE MOST NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL LADY GERALDINE I Lady! this night for the first time my eyes, My bodily eyes, drank in with sateless thirst Thy noblest beauty; as when desert skies By the full moon late-risen are immerst In pure and solemn splendour. Not surprise But breathless awe filled all my soul when first You floated vision-strange before its sight; O long-lost Star! O well-known unknown Light! II Amid the murmurous hum and dusty glare, With which those restless throngs confused the room, I moved and gazed, with little thought or care, So that the hours slipt smoothly through Life's loom, Weaving gay vesture for an old despair; When the unearthly sense of some great doom Approaching near possessed me, and I thrilled With tremors too mysterious to be stilled. III Rapt by that revelation from the crowd, My eyes were lifted,—to behold your face! While, like a silver-burning summer-cloud, Slow-soothed by dreamful airs through azure space, You floated past me, glorious, tranquil, proud; Borne gliding on with such serenest grace By slow sweet music, that it seemed to be Voicing thine own soul's inward harmony. IV Forthwith I knew Thee, whom I had not sought Since Youth high-hoping found no outward meed, And, ignorant that high hope its own bliss wrought, Left Faith to die, and nursed the bitter weed Which blooms in poisonous gauds of heartless thought. O sole fulfilment of my heart's great need! Vision revealing how and whence it pined! Blessed redeemer of my sinking mind! V Thy Presence was its own most adequate Proclaimer, full-credentialled, to my soul: An instant, and I recognized my Fate, Yielding with solemn joy to its control. I have been wandering in this intricate And gloomy maze of Life, without a goal, Baffled and hopeless; but my future way Lies straight and clear through life and death for aye. VI And more:—as moonlight up some sombre stream May flow in silence, a refulgent river, Enchanting the dull line with gracious beam Till far back toward its fount outleaps the quiver Of free waves joyous, living in the gleam; Even so your Apparition did deliver My long-dead years from blank Lethean night, And all lived forth in your celestial light. VII All glorious dreams that beautified and blest My fervent youth were realised in Thee; Young longings, nobler far in their unrest Than later moods of scornful stagnancy, Again could heave and agitate my breast; My mind, long world-filled, was empowered to see That Life has sacred mysteries unrevealed, And grander trusts than Earth and Time can yield. VIII And all this Past was thus redeemed from death, Through its pure prescience of Thyself alone; Shining in splendours of unclouded faith, Breathing in pants of love. Yes, I had known Thee well in hours long faded; when your breath Thrilled all my frame, and when your dark eyes shone With holy passion and exalted bliss, Throughout my spirit tranced in ecstasies. IX Yet it was not the eyes, large, solemn, deep— The several features of the noble face; Nor wealth of hair, flung down in long-curved sweep, Flashing like rippling sunbeams, whose embrace Doth in so warm a glow of beauty steep That harmony severe of stately grace Which moulds thy form; nor was it that full form In its serene perfection breathing warm:— X Not in all these can I find all the spell Which thrilled such instant recognition, wild Yet doubtless as an holy oracle, Throughout my being torpid and defiled. Why should I fear this joyous truth to tell, Which Love has murmured to his last-born child?— Unaided by the mean of bodily sense, Souls can reciprocate deep influence. XI O music, flow for ever soft and sweet Through subtler mazes, that in timeless dream I may for ever watch her dove-quick feet Circling in light adown thy shadowy stream, And calm-robed form float, swaying to the beat Of the long languid pulses; while outgleam Her face and round arms radiant through the whirls, Grand neck, white shoulders, queenly golden curls. XII Desire, by its own wild intensity, Was baffled,—I stood trembling, panting, pale; And every eager step approaching Thee Sank back: how spirits nearing Heaven must quail! Till some strong inspiration carried me, Half-dumb, to gasp my pleading,—and prevail; To sue, and stand dance-ready at thy side, Intoxicate with love and bliss and pride. XIII Oh, glory of the dance sublimed to this! Oh pure white arm electric that embraced Ethereal-lightly my unbounded bliss! Oh, let me die on but another taste Of that warm breath ambrosial, and the kiss Of those whirl-wanton ringlets; interlaced, Quick frame with frame borne on; my lips the while Within a neck-bend of that heavenly smile! XIV Did music measure that delirious dancing? I heard it not; I know not what strange sway Kept us among those spectral figures, glancing As its poor harmonies might rule their way. I was o'erfilled with music more entrancing, But wild, how wild! I could have fled astray, Footing the buoyant æther's moonlight sea, For ever and for ever linked with Thee. XV Most pure and beautiful! what stayed my lips, When parched with thirsting near such ænomel, From clinging unto thine for bee-like sips? From pasturing o'er thy brow's white asphodel? Sealing thine eyes in passion's dear eclipse, With pressure on the full blue-veinèd swell, And thrillings o'er the silken lashes fine, Mid interdraughts of their deep violet wine? XVI Yet, O Belovèd, though thus love-distraught, Blame not my spirit; for I felt You there So holy-pure, that self-condemning thought Blighted my passionate worship with despair: Half shrank I from each touch, although it brought Such rapture with it as I scarce could bear, As if from harp strings ready tuned above, To vibrate forth seraphic bliss and love. XVII I felt You as a flower, my hand I knew With touch the lightest-tender still must harm; Or gem so lucenter than morning dew, That my least breath must sully its pure charm: The cold white moon cresting night's cloudless blue Above dark moorland, far from town and farm, Or few wan stars dim-steadfast in dim skies, Are not so dowered with awe-fraught sanctities. XVIII Ay, while I thought: Could I seize one caress But one grand grape from this full-fruited vine; Grasp the rich ripeness, press and press and press, Till drunk with its last drain of glorious wine; Staking the Future's infinite barrenness 'Gainst one transcendent moment's bliss divine!— Even then, my wildered spirit knelt subdued Beneath thy pure calm noble maidenhood. XIX Subdued by Thee,—and yet exalted more! Calmed by perfection of resolve and pride! The future was drear-barren as a shore Wave-wasted by an ever wintry tide: But now! Shall he, whose sanest hopes may soar To win the empire's Empress for his bride, Purloin a jewel from her crownèd brow? Be kingly, heart! the throne awaits us now. XX Thou wert the farther from me, as so near; Veiled awful, at a distance dim and great, In that supernal spiritual sphere To which Love lifts, that he may isolate The truest lovers from their union here: Hence their eternal Bridal, consecrate By perfect reverence; for the Loved must be An ever-new Delight and Mystery. XXI Did aught of these tempestuous agitations In irrepressible gust or lightning-burst Perturb thy heaven of starry contemplations In depths of moonlit quietude immerst? I long for answer; but no meditations Can realise those memories, all disperst In such wild seething mists of joy, hope, fear:— Oh, that the question now could reach thine ear! XXII But when I saw the end must come indeed, When laggard pairs were failing from the dance, Surely my curbless thoughts found words to plead:— “Forgive, sweet Maiden!—Time and Circumstance Are lightning-swift, and I must match their speed. Believe me, that I speak in heavenly trance Diviner truth than souls can reach or prove When uninspired by seraph-sighted Love. XXIII The Vision sways me; I must speak or die: Life of my life! I see, I know, I feel; The inspiration cannot err or lie; Passion doth its own truth with pure fire seal;— God from the depths of all Eternity Created us One Soul, in woe or weal, In life and death, in union or apart: Whisper but ‘Yea,’ assuring my sure heart! XXIV “You tremble pallid, with the same new birth Of Love, the pure eternal Seraph-child! Flooding with fulness all our deadly dearth, Is it not strange and fierce and rapture-wild? I have dim memory that in yon poor earth Where late I grovelled hopeless and defiled A mortal thing called Love with doubt and pain Is reared: scarce one his sole true Bride can gain. XXV “But time is very brief:—Shall we away Into the great calm Night besprinkled o'er With silver throbbing stars? My Dearest, say! And yet, so rich in years is Evermore That hurry were mean thrift: we well can stay, Who long have stayed, some few brief time-lives more; Being so certain from this hour sublime Of coming Union, perfect, beyond Time.” XXVI Were such words borne exultant on my breath? Memory, which cannot oversoar the deep That yawns between two lives in sombre death, Nor even that 'twixt wakefulness and sleep, Brings no sure tidings: yet, unmoved in faith, Though sick with failing from that glorious steep Whence all the Promised Land was seen so clear, I plod Time's desert with more hope than fear. XXVII Yes, though I now feel faint and spiritless,— For when such fire of rapture burns down low We shivering cower, unmanned by chill distress, Over the embers while the bleak winds blow; With dismal dread that such rich blessedness Will never more within our cold hearts glow; Till in the bitter dark we almost deem That vanished glory a delusive dream:— XXVIII Yet have I even now deep confidence In those great oracles of solemn bliss Uttered so clearly to my spirit's sense By heavenly Love who pure and perfect is; Yet must I cherish them with reverence Though scornful voices from our world-abyss Proclaim the madness of both Him and them: This staff sustains,—may fruit yet crown its stem! XXIX Perchance we never more till death shall meet: You dwell on far high places of the earth, 'Midst well-befitting pomp; beneath your feet I labour humbly, not assured from dearth,— The hard-won bread itself most bitter-sweet. Were I your peer in wealth and worldly birth You still might justly scorn my love and me; Yet none the less must I live loving Thee. XXX It is my fate; your soul hath conquered mine; And I must be your slave and glory in The bondage whether cruel or benign. Still let me cherish hopes even here to win By strenuous toil the far-off Prize divine; And feed on visions, not so shadowy-thin, Of gaining You beneath a nobler sun Should I in this life's battle be undone. XXXI And with my passionate love for evermore Is blended pure and reverent gratitude; Nor can I this full sacrifice deplore Though You should scorn me whom You have subdued, Or know not what devotion I outpour. Ah, from this timeless night what boundless good Your Presence hath bestowed on me!—no less That I am stung with my unworthiness. XXXII Dark winter ruled a desert of drear frost; Spring's breath stole softly o'er its ice and snow; All life revives which had so long been lost, Trees green, flowers bloom, birds sing, and fountains flow; The realm is laughing wide from coast to coast. Dear May of its redemption! while we know It seemed unworthy of thy Spring-love tender, That love yet fits it for full Summer splendour. XXXIII Henceforth my life shall not unearnest prove; It hath an ardent aim, a glorious goal: Numb Faith re-lives; You from your sphere above Have planted and must nourish in my soul That priceless blessing, pure and fervent love, O'er which no thought of self can have control. If with these boons come ever-longing pain, It shall be welcomed for the infinite gain. XXXIV Be pain unnoticed in a doom like this! I see eyes gazing on my weary night Like cold strange stars from out the world-abyss; They gaze with scorn or pity: but their sight Is banished from my inward golden bliss, Floating divinely in the noonday light Of Thee round whom I circle—O far Sun, Through mirk and shine alike the earth's true course is run! January 1857. AN OLD DREAM The maiden lay in a perfect trance, As sweet, as sad as Love; Embowered deep from the night's expanse, As a forest-nested dove; Through the leaves came never a single glance, For the stars were quenched above. The world seemed doomstruck, almost dead, Nor dared to breathe aloud; A wannish mist of grave-light spread From the moon within her shroud; No sky,—but the mute woods overhead Hung like a thunder-cloud. In a pure white robe lay the maiden there, A shroud or a bridal white; Her pale face set in her long rich hair, Golden and dimly bright; Free from joy and woe and care, Entranced within the night. At length that night was rolled away With its buried stars and moon; Advanced the pomp of a royal day In a dawn of glorious boon; But consciousless the maiden lay Till the crowning hour of noon. And then she opened her large wild eyes In the universal glow: Their late trance blent with their new surprise, They gazed; and drank in slow Grand gleams of the solemn azure skies And the clouds of dazzling snow. The noontide reigned in perfect power, Full-sphered with heat and sheen; The soft blue haze of the secret bower Was lit with golden green; Feeling their rich life fruit and flower Basked languidly serene. Sumptuous rose-leaves flushing red, And lilies white as snow Made for her limbs an ample bed, Lying still and low; But pansies pillowed her solemn head With their deepest purple glow And the bower's roof and wall and crown Was all one mighty vine, That linked and clothed the tree-stems brown With an endless leafy twine, Which the sultry clustered grapes weighed down, Heavy with wealth of wine. Thus richly couched she lay alone, Without one cry or start, Although her face was set like stone Against some cruel smart; Until her anguish found a moan, Complaining to her heart— “Oh, this is sad, sad, sad!” it sighed, “Oh, this is a cruel doom! What glorious life fills the whole world wide, What fruit and flower and bloom! Yet none for me—who must abide In this ever-lonely tomb. “The sky is all a-daze with light, The air one murmurous chime; The joyous sea sways blue and bright, The earth laughs green with prime;— For me no love and no delight In this fair world of Time!” She moaned—and raised a sculptured arm To where the great grapes hung; Her cold hand drew them dusk and warm To moisten her languid tongue,— To kindle some life through her wasted form With the summer's rich blood young. The whole green-woven umbrage bent And swayed to her light stress; The sun-steeped grapes to her wan lips leant In an unreserved caress; How could she 'plain of famishment Amid such grand excess? The sunlight's fervent golden wine Came streaming through the bower, The clouds of the firmamental vine Burst in a crimson shower; She loomed in the midst like a maid divine Veiled, glorious, by her dower. Over the roses and lilies white, Over the mossy ground, The rills of the vine blood revelled in light, Dancing around and around; With a multitudinous laughter bright And a song of murmurous sound. But look on her pallid brow and face, Look on her white robe fair,— There riot hath left what a bloody trace, What a ghastly vestige there! What a wild weird purple drowns the grace Of her shining golden hair! The blood of the lusty summer prime Could pour no life through her, The noon of the gorgeous summer time No health, no strength confer: She sank back cold from the boons sublime To the trance that could not stir. And who had seen her when the grey Was fading into gloom, Had thought a sculptured lady lay Upon a white stone tomb, Besprent with blood, to mark for aye Some awful tragic doom. Throughout calm depths of heaven were strewn The pure stars throbbing bright, The golden lustre of the moon Was spreading through the night, When next from out that mystic swoon Her spirit rose to light. She woke—“Ah, once I lived, it seems, Through ever mournful years; But now I wake from heavenly dreams That fill my eyes with tears;— From floating far down Eden-streams With a band of glorious feres. “And all my heart a throbbing gush Of life and love and bliss; And all my face a dawn-bright flush From some enraptured kiss; And all our Heaven the breathless hush Of crowning ecstasies!” While thus she murmured soft and low, And still half-trancedly, What calm bright forms came sinking slow Adown the moonlight sea? What strange sweet music 'gan to grow Throughout night's mystery? In the deep heart of all the wood Came down the seraphs bright; Around the maiden's couch they stood, All shining with the light Of the beauty of pure sanctitude Upon her ravished sight. They clasped her in a dear embrace Of high and holy love; Their voices thrilled the lonely place— “Meek sister! stricken dove! Come soar with us, and see the face Of Him who reigns above!” So sang they sweet; and all around The music swelled on high To an ocean of triumphant sound, That mingled gloriously With the moonlight, filling up the bound Of all the night-wide sky. As if rapt heavenwards by the might Of that harmonious wind, The seraph-wings flashed broad and bright And left the earth behind; And dim within their fulgent flight The maiden's form reclined. And up the music-moonlight sea They floated calm and slow— So that it rather seemed to be The earth was sinking low Than that they soared, so steadfastly Ascending they did go. They bore the maiden, still and dim, When first they rose from earth; But ere the splendour and the hymn Left all our sphere a dearth, A seraph with the seraphim She soared in her new birth. Friday, September 23, 1859. THE FADELESS BOWER Athwart the gloom of haunted years, Whose phantoms mock my lonely woe, I gaze, and see through glimmering tears A Vision of the Long-ago: From out the waste verge dim and far How purely gleams that single star! Shine forth, sole star!—The dear old bower And I therein alone with Her, In that rich summer's crowning hour, Whose quiet breathings scarcely stir The woof of leaves and tendrils thin Through which faint moonlight ripples in. I have this moment told my love; Kneeling, I clasp her hands in mine: She does not speak, she does not move; The silent answer is divine. The flood of rapture swells till breath Is almost tranced in deathless death. Had He whom, 'midst the whirlwind's roar, That fiery chariot's living light Far through the Heaven of Heavens upbore, Consuming space with meteor-flight, God's glory dazzling on his gaze,— Had he then breath for prayer or praise? The bower is very dim and still; But clustering in the copses near Sweet nightingales impassioned thrill The night with utterance full and clear Of love and love's harmonious jars, As glorious as the shining stars. My lips still lie upon her hand, Quivering and faint beyond the kiss; The heavens before my soul expand Athrob with dazzling light and bliss; He in his fiery car sublime Soared not more swiftly out of Time. Behold her as she standeth there, Breathless, with fixed awe-shadowed eyes Beneath her moon-touched golden hair! Her spirit's pure humilities Are trembling, half would disavow The crown I bring to crown her brow. Unworthy crown; and yet her life Was set on gaining it alone: And now in triumph without strife Led upward to the queenly throne, She falters from the sceptre's weight, While flushed with high-wrought pride elate. The simple folds of white invest Her noble form, as purest snow Some far and lovely mountain-crest Faint-flushed with all the dawn's first glow; Alone, resplendent, lifted high Into the clear vast breathless sky. The bower is hushed and still as death; The moonlight melting through its gloom Is mingled with the languid breath Of roses steeped in liquid bloom, That bare their inmost hearts this night To drink in deep the dew and light. So Thou, my Rose, my perfect Queen Of Beauty, float and breathe, nor move, In this enchanted air serene, Unfolding all thy heart to love; Drink in this dew of heavenly wine, This light which is a soul divine. The Vision fades . . . ah, woe, woe, woe!— While dreamed that summer's sun-tranced hours The ghastly Hand was creeping slow Through all their maze of leaves and flowers, And tore my Rose off when her breath Was sweetest: O remorseless Death!— Could that one hour have been drawn out Until the end of Time's whole range! We rapt away, so sphered about, And made eternal, free from change; In heart and mind, in soul and frame Preserved for evermore the same! The life of that great town afar Would breathe its murmur vast and dim, With all the multitudinous jar Sublimed into a solemn hymn, Mysterious, soothing, evermore, As heaven may hear our harsh Life-roar: The overtrailing passion-flower Gaze ever on the starry sky With all its constellated bower Of large and starlike blooms, which lie Amidst their golden fruit beset With leaves and tendrils dark-dew-wet: And I for ever kneel there still, With lifted eyes whose yearning sight Could never drink its perfect fill From those dear eyes of love and light, In which to me thy thoughts shine clear As yon high stars in yon blue sphere: Entranced above the worded Yes, All flushed and pale with rapturous shame, In that dim moonlit quietness You stand for evermore the same, Fairer than heaven, the Queen who now Is trembling as I crown her brow. Some ardent Seraph from above, Some Angel ever growing young, Would find this Eden of our love, Sequestered all the worlds among; With silent pinions gliding bright Into our calm enchanted night. And, ushered by the chant divine Of yonder deathless nightingales, Through all the tree-shades reach our shrine; And softly drawing back the veils Of foliage let some fuller stream Of moonlight bathe thy beauty's dream. And gazing long, until his form Might seem as fixed in trance as we, Serenely perfect breathing warm, Would sigh a sigh of mystery, Half vague regrets, half longings sweet; Then slow with lingering plumes retreat: Murmuring, “It is a goddess born, But left with mortals from her birth, None knew that she was thus forlorn; Till this one youth of all the earth, Inspired to see her as divine, Knelt down in reverence at her shrine. “Her native instincts roused to life Leap up to claim the worship due, Are breaking with imperial strife The bonds of earthly custom through; Yet still remains some sweet half-fear At entrance to the unknown sphere. “But, oh, what glory, triumph, bliss, The sudden revelation wrought! What power had that young mortal's kiss To thrill her thus beyond all thought? She shares with him the Heavenly throne Which he hath made indeed her own. “And hence while every other earth Rolls circling through the vast abyss With interchange of death and birth, And night and day, and woe and bliss, One sphere is kept for these alway Above all growth and all decay. “And here she blooms, a budded rose, Whose crimson fire of life new-lit Is ever fervent to unclose The many-petalled wealth of it, Embalmed from reaching to that prime Which fades so soon in sultry Time. “New dawn, far fairer than the noon; Hope, kinglier than thy crowning day; Young spring's green promise fresh and boon, No wealthiest summer's fruit can pay; Dreamland, so rich beyond life's bounds; Silence, more sweet than all sweet sounds! “While he who once was mean and poor Is climbing strenuous toward the throne, He breathes a loftier joy be sure Than when the prize is made his own, When reft of hope and valiant strife He paces lordly-level life. “O happy bud, for ever young, For ever just about to blow! O happy love, upon whose tongue The Yes doth ever trembling grow! O happiest Twain, whose deathless bower Embalms you in life's crowning hour!” . . . The Seraph-murmurs die out low, As fades the Vision, fades the Bower. The bower has faded long ago; The roses and the passion-flower Have rotted in the sodden mould; The new place quite forgets the old. Ah, Alice, if I dream and dream, What else is left me in this life? New faces all about me teem, New hopes and woes and loves are rife: I overlived my own self, Dear, In lingering when you left me here. And so my heart must soar away To where alone its treasure is: Despite my dream that we should stay Entranced in unfulfilling bliss, What fiery longings burn my breast To reach, to gain, to be possessed! Then fade, dim dream! and Sorrow, cease! While I can trust, where'er you be, That you are waiting my release To live out to its depth with me, In bowers or dens through noble spheres The love suspended all these years. 1858. SUGGESTED BY MATTHEW ARNOLD'S “STANZAS FROM THE GRANDE CHARTREUSE.” [Part I.] That one long dirge-moan sad and deep, Low, muffled by the solemn stress Of such emotion as doth steep The soul in brooding quietness, Befits our anguished time too well, Whose Life-march is a funeral knell. Dirge for a mighty Creed outworn— Its spirit fading from the earth, Its mouldering body left forlorn: Weak idol! feeding scornful mirth In shallow hearts; divine no more Save to some ignorant pagan poor; And some who know how by Its light The past world well did walk and live, And feel It even now more bright Than any lamp mere men can give; So cling to It with yearning faith, Yet own It almost quenched in death: While many who win wealth and power And honours serving at Its shrine, Rather than lose their worldly dower Proclaim their dead thing “Life divine;” And sacrifice to coward lust Their own souls' truth, a people's trust. And will none mourn the mighty Dead,— Pillar of heavenly fire and cloud, Which through this life's wild desert led For whole millenniums each grand crowd Of sages, bards, saints, heroes, all Whose names we glory to recall? None mourn Him, dead, with deep-moved soul, Whom, living, all our sires adored? None feel the heavy darkness roll Stifling about us, when the Lord Leaves us to walk by our own light, That one pale speck in boundless Night?— That earthly lamp when sun and star, When all the heavenly lights are lost: Does it shed radiance round afar? Our pathway is by deep gulfs cross'd: It fathoms none. We lift it high: It casts not one beam on the sky. If He thus died as no more fit To lead the modern march of thought, Supreme,—commanding, guiding it, With noblest love and wisdom fraught; He was at least Divine; and none Of human souls can lead it on. We pine in our dark living tomb, Waiting the God-illumined One Who, only, can disperse the gloom; Completing what the Dead begun, Or farther leading us some space Toward our eternal resting-place. But Israel wanders shepherdless, Or gloom-involved unmoving lies, And in despair's stark sinfulness Reviles the promised Paradise It cannot reach—Father divine! Let us not long thus hopeless pine. Still the deep dirge-notes long and low Breathe forth strange anguish to recall— Could we forget—our direst woe: A proud strong Age fast losing all Earth has of heaven; bereft of faith; And living in Eternal Death. And loudly boastful of such life: Blinded by our material might, Absorbed in frantic worldly strife, Unconscious of the utter Night Whose palpable and monstrous gloom Is gathering for our spirits' tomb. We feel as gods in our own hearts; Seeming to conquer Time and Space; Wealth gorging our imperial marts; Earth pregnant, from the fierce embrace Our matter-lusting spirits press, With unexampled fruitfulness. God, answering well our worldly prayer, Our hearts' chief prayer through all the hours Of selfish joy and sordid care, Comes down to us in golden showers: God turns to Mammon at our cry; Our souls wealth-crushed, dross-stifled lie. Those few, how rich! while this great mass, Myriads with equal greed for gold, Sink in such want and woe, alas! As never can on earth be told: These starve, and those yet wealthier rise; Meanwhile in both the spirit dies. Hear now the thrilling dirge-notes peal The anguished cry in thunder rolls:— The few yet left who think and feel, Who yearn with strenuous soaring souls For more than earth or time can grant; Where, where shall they appease their want? Black disbelief, substantial doubt Wreathe—blent into one louring cloud Through which Heaven's light can scarce shine out— Round all the Faiths: all in such shroud Fade ghostlike to th'entombing Past: Our Heaven is wildly overcast. Yet each Creed, senile, sick, half-dead, With bitter spite and doting rage Reviles all others. Whoso, led By thirst of love to pilgrimage, Seeks now old God-given Wells of Life, Finds drought-dry centres of vain strife; And turns away in blank despair, To scoff or weep as fits his mood. O God in Heaven, hear our prayer! We know Thou art, Allwise, Allgood, Yet sink in godless misery: Oh, teach us how to worship Thee! Part II. The great Form lies there nerveless still: But as we fix our longing gaze It grows in grandest beauty, till We worship in entranced amaze; Such holy love and wisdom seem To be there rapt in heavenly dream. Oh, if He may once more awake! Oh, if it be not death, but sleep!— And He from that dread slumber break Refreshed and strong, full-powered to sweep The darkness from our path again; Once more the Guiding Star of men! Yet—though it be death—view It well. The brow, how nobly high and broad! What love on those shut lips might well! This Form sublimely templed God: And, if not perfect, is a shrine Approaching well the most Divine. Do not turn hastily away From mighty death to petty life; Gaze in deep reverence on the clay With such a soul's expression rife: Read here, read long, the features worn By One incarnate Heavenly-born. So may we hope to recognise That Greater One who shall succeed This death-bound Monarch, who now lies In mute appealing for our need: God cannot long desert His earth; In the Old's death the New has birth. What say we?—we know well this truth, There is no death for the Divine; Which lives in ever-perfect youth: The Form alone—its earthly shrine— Is subject to earth's mortal sway; Sickens, and dies, and rots away. Thus each Form in its turn expires, No more with all revealed Truth rife,— Which even at that time inspires Some new and nobler form with life, Grander and vaster to express More of Its infinite heavenliness. Thus has it been since Time's first birth, Thus must it be for evermore: Still lie, moth-eaten, on the earth Old garments which this Spirit wore; Till, soiled and rent, they were off-thrown, And wider-flowing robes put on. They could not grow with His great growth, Pauseless though slow throughout the years; And vainly worshippers—so loath To leave what lengthened use endears— May still the empty robes adore; Their virtue was from Him who wore. Let none say the Divine is dead, Although this Form be soul-less quite: The Heavenly Sun doth ever shed His lifeful heat, His saving light; Never our earth doth lose His ray, Save when she turns herself away. Let none say the Divine is dumb, Although His voice no more we hear: It is that we are deaf become. For measured to each eye and ear His glory shines, His voice outspeaks; To each He gives the most it seeks. Our spirits may for ever grow; And He will fill them as before, And still their measure overflow With His unlessened infinite More: He gives us all we can receive; He teaches all we can believe. The pure can see Him perfect-pure; The strong feel Him, Omnipotence; The wise, All-wise; He is obscure But to the gross and earth-bound sense: Alas for us with blinded sight Who dare to cry, There is no light! Part III. Nay, ask us not to rise and leave Him from whom power and life seem gone; Say not that it is weak to grieve; Duty does not, now, urge us on: In vain ye urge; too well we know We cannot by our own strength go. Vainly ye choose you Saviours now Of men,—however good and wise Be those your mean faith would endow With power to which no man can rise: No best men living lure our faith From the Divine though veiled in death. Vainly ye wander every way Throughout the earth in search of Heaven, Changing your useless path each day With each new transient impulse given By human guides, who still agree In naught but fallibility. We should know better from the lore Of worldly wisdom—keen mistrust— On which our minds so love to pore; Nor leave for any child of dust This One Divine: to Him adhere Till the diviner One appear. My brothers, let us own the truth, Bitter and mournful though it be,— That we, who spent our dreary youth In foul and sensual slavery, Are all too slavish, too unmanned, For Conquerors of the Promised Land. In unprogressive wanderings We plod the desert to and fro; And fiery serpents' mortal stings, Earthquake and sword and weary woe And pestilence deal fearful death Amongst us for our want of faith. Far-scattered o'er the Waste forlorn Our bones shall whiten through the years, And startle pilgrims yet unborn; Our noblest captains, priests and seers, Dark death shall one by one remove, For lack of wisdom, faith, or love. Yet be we patient, meek and pure, Unselfishly resigned to God's Mysterious judgments; and endure Our sore scarce-intermitted loads Of grief and weary pain, imbued With sternly passive fortitude: And pray that those who shall succeed Prove worthy of a happier life Than we dare ask for as our meed; That they a constant noble strife Victorious against Ill may wage, And gain the glorious heritage. Cease now to cry and storm, and move, By such tumultuous toil opprest As, without guidance, vain must prove: When God keeps still can ye not rest? When He sends night so dark and deep, Why shrink from renovating sleep? Sleep, to His care resigned, a space; That when He rises in His might To lead our hosts from this dire place, We may have strength and heart to fight All evils that would bar our way, And march unfaltering all the day. Yes, let us stay in loving grief, Which patient hope and trust yet cheer, Silent beside our silent Chief, Till His Successor shall appear; Till death's veil fall from off His face, Or One anointed take His place. Nay,—our adoring love should have More faith than to believe that He, Before Another comes to save, Can leave us in blind misery Without a Guide: God never can So utterly depart from man. We will move onward!—let us trust That there is life and saving power In this dear Form which seems but dust. Arise, arise! though darkness lower, Earnest, bold-hearted, cease to mourn; It shall before our hosts be borne. Triumphantly He ever led Our faithful armies while alive; What though His form be cold and dead, His Spirit doth that death survive: We conquer by that Soul this Form Enshrined, not ill, while free and warm. Thus men have honoured fellow men, Who dying left a lofty fame; And won most glorious victories then By inspiration of a Name: If in men's names such life abode, Shall there not in His,—Son of God. A dawn-light creeps throughout the gloom, Sullenly sinks the storm of wrath; Life blossoms in our desert tomb; Mysteriously we find a path Which leadeth on to Paradise. Thus to our love's faith He replies! But, while the dirge still rolls away In passionate thunders wildly blent With mournful moanings, let us pray— Still on our Holy War intent— “O God, revive the seeming Dead; Or send Another in His stead! “The wintry midnight drear is past, But still the dawn gleams grey and cold; Dread phantoms haunt each restless blast, Our stumblings still are manifold: Oh, let Thy cloudless Sun rise soon, And flood us with His summer noon!” July 1855. FOUR POINTS IN A LIFE I. LOVE'S DAWN. Still thine eyes haunt me; in the darkness now, The dreamtime, the hushed stillness of the night, I see them shining, pure and earnest light; And here, all lonely, may I now avow The thrill with which I ever meet their glance? At first they gazed a calm abstracted gaze, The while thy soul was floating through some maze Of beautiful divinely-peopled trance; But now I shrink from them in shame and fear, For they are gathering all their beams of light Into an arrow, keen, intense, and bright, Swerveless and star-like from its deep blue sphere, Piercing the cavernous darkness of my soul, Burning its foul recesses into view; Transfixing with sharp agony through and through Whatever is not brave, and clean, and whole. And yet I will not shrink, although thou piercest Into the inmost depth of all my being: I will not shrink, although thou now art seeing My heart's caged lusts the wildest and the fiercest; The cynic thoughts that fret my homeless mind, My unbelief, my selfishness, my weakness, My dismal lack of charity and meekness; For, amidst all the evil, thou wilt find Pervading, cleansing, and transmuting me, A fervent and most holy love for Thee. 1852. II. MARRIAGE. Come to me, oh, come to me! Time is long since we were parted; I am sad and weary-hearted, Foiled and almost overthrown, Fighting with the world alone; What am I when thou art gone? Come, darling, soon! Come to me, oh, come to me! Let my failing head find rest, Love, On thy pure and tender breast, Love; Calm my overwearied brain, Soothe away my heart's chill pain, Bring me hope and strength again; Come, darling, soon! Come to me, oh, come to me! Evermore the memory lingers, How your gentle “flower-soft” fingers, With a touch, when I lay ill, Through my fevered frame would thrill Cool rich life, divinely still: Come, darling, soon! Come to me, oh, come to me! Dearest heart of love and meekness, Is not this unmanly weakness? But with thee such pure sweet calm Heals my wounds with heavenly balm, I, fighting, feel my spear a palm: Come, darling, soon! Come to me, oh, come to me! Though its perils gloomed more fearful I could fight undaunted, cheerful, This stern agony, called Life, Were the pauses of the strife Blest by thee, my noble wife: Come, darling, soon! Come to me, oh, come to me! Strength, and hope, and faith are waning With this fierce and pauseless straining: Ere my soul be conquered quite, Ere I fail from Truth and Right, Come, my Life, my Joy, my Light, Come, Darling, soon! 1857. III. PARTING. Weep not, dearest, weep not so; Soon again we two shall meet Who now part in deadly woe: After pain shall bliss be sweet. Few more years of numb despair Must we wander far apart Through the desert dead and bare; Love is courage in the heart. Few more years of bitter moan O'er the rugged mountain height, Must we toil on, each alone; Love can make all burthens light. Few more years of stricken woe, Erring on an alien shore, Lone and friendless each must go: We will love then more and more. Few short hours of doubt and dread, Trembling on the brink of Night, Spectre-haunted, each must tread: Love can burn all darkness bright. All the long lone years must die; Then shall we together come, Where beneath a calm bright sky, Bright waves bear us to our home. Weep not, Dearest, weep not so; Soon again we two must meet Where the calm deep waters flow, Soothing surely care and woe, With their mystic murmur sweet. 1854. IV. AT DEATH'S DOOR. Is this the second childhood's feeble sadness? My eyes are dim now and my hair is white; Yet never did the sunshine give more gladness, Never young Spring burst forth in green delight More freshly; never was the earth more fair, Never more rapture in the common air. Still, as I near great Death, it seems his portal Glides gently backward, that I may gaze through And catch far glories of the realm immortal; The world becomes transparent to my view, Diviner Heavens expand beyond the skies; The stars grow thoughtful with eternal eyes. How all the grass and every flower seem yearning To hint more clearly some high loveliness, Whose mystic soul within their forms is burning; How strives the sea for ever to express, With infinite heavings, murmurings manifold, Some secret grandeur that will not be told. The life of day is lulled to dreamful musing, And true life waketh in the world of dream; While with the Present, strangely interfusing, The Future and the Past together stream, As if the long-drawn waves of Time should be Settling and mingling in Eternity. With every golden dawn awakened lightly, It seems I must have slept through Death's calm night; For lo!—how purely, silently, and brightly, The Heavens unfold their gates before my sight; The trancèd sea of crystal spreadeth slowly, The burning Throne shines out with splendours holy. Whereon I look to see Thee come, swift greeting, From where thou waitest for my lingering feet; Assured beyond impatience for the meeting, Crowned with triumphant love and faith complete: I look in vain as yet; but any hour, So summer-rich, may make the bud a flower. How well, my Love, the thoughtful Heavens endeavour To make this world and life and time all bear Dream-lightly on the soul, ere it for ever Be parted from them!—Did I once despair Through years of lonely anguish unassuaged? This calm can scarce believe that storms have raged. Here is the blessing: I now muse enchanted In this sweet dawn-like sunset; night comes then Of restful sleep by gracious visions haunted; So with new morning I shall rise again, Full of young life, and find my Love for aye— My Love whom I have lost this long sad day. 1858. MATER TENEBRARUM I In the endless nights, from my bed, where sleepless in anguish I lie, I startle the stillness and gloom with a bitter and strong cry: O Love! O Belovèd long lost! come down from thy Heaven above, For my heart is wasting and dying in uttermost famine for love! Come down for a moment! oh, come! Come serious and mild And pale, as thou wert on this earth, thou adorable Child! Or come as thou art, with thy sanctitude, triumph and bliss, For a garment of glory about thee; and give me one kiss, One tender and pitying look of thy tenderest eyes, One word of solemn assurance and truth that the soul with its love never dies! II In the endless nights, from my bed, where sleepless in frenzy I lie, I cleave through the crushing gloom with a bitter and deadly cry: Oh! where have they taken my Love from our Eden of bliss on this earth, Which now is a frozen waste of sepulchral and horrible dearth? Have they killed her indeed? is her soul as her body, which long Has mouldered away in the dust where the foul worms throng? O'er what abhorrent Lethes, to what remotest star, Is she rapt away from my pursuit through cycles and systems far? She is dead, she is utterly dead; for her life would hear and speed To the wild imploring cry of my heart that cries in its dreadful need. III In the endless nights, on my bed, where sleeplessly brooding I lie, I burden the heavy gloom with a bitter and weary sigh: No hope in this worn-out world, no hope beyond the tomb; No living and loving God, but blind and stony Doom. Anguish and grief and sin, terror, disease and despair: Why throw not off this life, this garment of torture I wear, And go down to sleep in the grave in everlasting rest? What keeps me yet in this life, what spark in my frozen breast? A fire of dread, a light of hope, kindled, O Love, by thee; For thy pure and gentle and beautiful soul, it must immortal be. 1859. A REAL VISION OF SIN Like a soaking blanket overhead Spongy and lax the sky was spread, Opaque as the eye of a fish long dead. Like trees in a drawing gummed together Some trees stood dim in the drizzling weather; Sweating mere blood-flowers gloomed the heather. Like a festering gash left gaping wide That foul canal, long swooned from tide, The marshy moorland did divide. In a slushy hollow near its bank, Where noisome weeds grew thick and dank, And the very soil like an old corpse stank, They cowered together, the man and crone, Two old bags of carious bone; They and a mangy cur alone: Ragged, haggard, filthy, both; Viewing each the other loath; Growling now and then an oath. She at length with a spasm raised Her strong grey eyes, still strong tho' glazed; And thus her meditations phrased: “No mite left of all our treasure; Sin itself has no more pleasure: Drained out, drained out our full measure!” He quavered back: “It does seem so: The sun 'e died out long ago; The earth and the sky are a-rottin' slow.” She writhed her thick brows, dirty grey: “Then take at once my easy way Of swamping misery from our clay. “No trembling, dear red-rat-eyes! Come! We slip together through that green scum, And then with the world here rot on dumb.” He sat still, nipping spiteful blows On the snarling cur's amorphous nose; Relishing faintly her propose. “Well you look lovely, so you do, To call me names: a-drowndin' you Would go to spoil this pleasant view! “This 'ere damned life is bad enough; But, say we smother in that stuff, Our next life's only worse, you muff!” The woman thereto coldly sneered: “Of course, as usual all afeared, Old slaver-dewy stubble-beard. “Idiot and coward! hell-flames feed On certain fuel; but, indeed, A used-up soul won't sate their greed. “When Earth once gets us cold and stark She'll keep us safely in the dark: No fear of rousing with the lark! “Full long ago in grim despair, She growled, How those two witch-fires flare! They'll get no second chance I swear!” She laught this truth out 'gainst the man; Who shuffling, ill at ease, began: “You can be devilish sore, you can. “Suppose you're right; this life's a one That's cursèd bad, but better than none. . . . I wish they'd light another Sun. “We used to spree and we don't spree now; A screw is loose in the world allow, We didn't make it, anyhow. “Say Life's hard-up, No-life's more glum: Just think—a lashing lot of rum, And a night with you and a cool old chum!” She fingered a toad from its love-work sweet, And flung to the cur with a “mangy, eat; They say there's poison in the meat; “And so the next time you bite this dear He'll die off mad; for else I fear He'd fester for ever and ever here.” Its loose fangs squashed the nectarous lump; Then it went and crouched on a doddered stump, With an evil eye on the Male Sin's hump. He blinked and shuffled and swore and groaned: Rasping the bristly beard she owned, She thought drear thoughts until she moaned. “I see the truth,” with a scornful laugh, “I have starved abroad on the swine-fouled draff, While sleek at home sucked the fatt'ning calf. “Too late, too late! Yet it's good to see, If only damnation, thoroughly; My Life has never met with me. “And you, you never loved me, you! A heart that never once beat true, How could it love? I loved for two. “This dirty crumpled rag of a breast Was globed with milk once; I possest The means of being grandly blest! “Did the babe of mine suck luscious sips, Soothing the nipple with rose-soft lips While her eyes dropped mild in a dear eclipse? “A babe!—could I now squeeze out three drops Between that poor cur's ulcerous chaps, He'd die as livid as yon tree-tops. “You know where it rests, that child-dream gone? Come, grope in this charming water-lawn, Through ooze and slime and filth and spawn: “Perhaps we shall find a shudderous feel, Neither of eft nor toad nor eel; May hear a long long stifled squeal. “Touch the rotten bones of a murdered brat Whose flesh was daint to the water-rat,— If it does gnaw flesh it would relish that!” He ventured, “Curse all memory! It's more than thirty years”—but she Continued fierce unheedingly— “Come, and this loathsome life out-smother, No fear that we'll ever have another: The rain may beat and the wind may wuther, “But we shall rot with the rotting soil, Safe in sleep from the whole sad coil; Sleep's better than corn and wine and oil. “Here's a kiss; now at once!” effused the witch, And dragged the wildered male to the ditch, And plunged there prone by a bladdery bitch. Drowned dead, stone dead, and still her grasp Clawed him: but with a frenzied gasp He shuddered off the scranny clasp. Up the soddened bank in a fury of funk He sprawled: “She's awful! but she's sunk; I daren't die except dead drunk.” He managed at length the hollow to win; And was gulping down with a pang-writhed grin The black bottle's last of vitriol gin, When his gorge was choked by a sudden blight: The cur growled mad with venom and fright, And its blotches of hair all bristled upright. Its frenzy burst out in a wolfish yell; It leaped at his throat like an imp of hell; In a spasm of horror the bottle fell: It griped up his flaccid throat with a force That made his terrorment gurgle hoarse, While he turned as blue as a cholera-corse. It haled him into the festering dike; So all sank dead in its clam alike,— The Man, the Woman, the virtuous Tyke. And the dense rain crooned in its sullen flow From the sodden sky-stretch drooping low To the sodden earth; and to and fro Crept a maundering wind too weak to blow; And the dim world murmured dismal woe: For the earth and the sky were a-rotting slow. Friday, March 4, 1859. ARCH ARCHERY You ask me, darling, why I smile, And at what pleasant thing? My thoughts go back a few months' while To the fairest day in spring; The fairest day, in the end of March; The sun shone warm and bright; All blue and bland was the heaven's arch With its calm clouds soft and white. And some one said, “I should like to go, And shoot in this pleasant breeze.” And I humbly prayed, “Let me be your bow, You can bend me as you please.” And the saucy girl said, “A bow of yew! O a bow of yew must be good: They say it is tough and strong and true, Though a grave-devoted wood.” Over the rolling waves of sward We lightly skimmed along; While the larks from the cloud and the azure poured Freely their first full song: Then leaf-like came a-dropping down, When their joy thro' heaven was told, To the short sweet grass, to the gorse half brown, Half lit with shining gold. And I said or thought: Not Dian queen With her quiver and her bow, A statelier form, a purer mien, A lighter step could show. Till we came to a long lone quiet glen, Much loved of the thoughtful sheep: Before the Flood—or, who knows when?— It perhaps was a river deep. There were the targets ready placed, Right gorgeous to behold; With their red rings, blue rings, white rings graced, Around the central gold. And there our mighty match we shot, Like eager Volunteers. Hit we the mark, or hit we not, What merry laughs and jeers! Gaily we tripped along the glen Between the targets two, With riant races now and then For arrows in the dew. O arch was she with her jest and smile, And arch was I, I ween; But the Archer archest all the while Was shooting there unseen. Swift, swift and keen his arrows flew, Well aimed at either heart; And pierced the poor things thro' and thro', With a strange delicious smart. Well—when the match was fairly done, Who triumphed, she or I? We both had lost, we both had won; It ended in a tie. For that third Archer, we agreed, Alone should judge the case; And thus he solemnly decreed, With wisdom in his face— “You—maiden of the witching eyes, You—happiest of men; Must share the honour and the prize, Nor ever strive again. “For thus on either I bestow The meed that fitteth well— She is the mistress of the beau, He bears away the belle.” Curragh, 1860. THE DREAMER Sing the old song while the dear child is sleeping, Sing it most sweetly and tenderly low; Not to awake her again to her weeping; Let the soft notes through her dream gently flow. What, though the passionate tears were down-streaming From eye-balls long parched, when she lay down to rest: Poor thing, she now is most tranquilly dreaming; Her life is again with His dear presence blest. See, o'er her wan face what joy brightly flushes; Beneath the dark lids how her eyes swell and gleam! The sweet smile is drowned in the glow of love-blushes! Yes! he companions her now in the dream. Darling! her lips murmur softly and slowly,— What sacred vows and confessions of love? Is not this Dream-life most blessèd and holy Less of the earth than of Heaven above? No, do not draw down the white lawny curtain: The moonlight sleeps still on her hair, on her face; Mystical blending of shadow uncertain With lustre as holy as Heaven's blessèd grace. It stirs not her slumber, but chastened and tender— Our musical murmur half-thrilling its breast— Pervades with a blissful entrancement of splendour That dim world of dreams where her soul findeth rest. Sing the old song still with low-voicèd sweetness, To harmonise well with her brief dream of bliss, Blending therewith to ecstatic completeness:— The poor pallid lips, are they trembling a kiss! So may the words and the scenes of her vision To her tranced spirit more exquisite grow; With beauty and glory and rapture Elysian Subtly attuned to our soft music's flow: And she may, alas, when she wakes with the morrow To bitter reality, hopeless and lone, Remember far more to sooth anguish and sorrow Of the dream and the dream-words of him who is gone: And so, when we sing the old song in her hearing, May she with wonder and secret joy find The dear words, the bliss of her dream re-appearing With the loved music that flows through her mind. Perhaps she now hears him an old love-lay singing; Does it not thrill in her eager, fixed face? Or hears the old Church-bells in golden chimes ringing The union that cannot in this world take place. But sleep, darling, sleep; oh, dwell long in that heaven, The strange, solemn dream-land so holy and calm, Which God hath in mercy to such as thee given; Where all stricken hearts may find wound-healing balm. 1855. ROBERT BURNS He felt scant need Of church or creed, He took small share In saintly prayer, His eyes found food for his love; He could pity poor devils condemned to hell, But sadly neglected endeavours to dwell With the angels in luck above: To save one's precious peculiar soul He never could understand is the whole Of a mortal's business in life, While all about him his human kin With loving and hating and virtue and sin Reel overmatched in the strife. “The heavens for the heavens, and the earth for the earth! I am a Man—I'll be true to my birth— Man in my joys, in my pains.” So fearless, stalwart, erect and free, He gave to his fellows right royally His strength, his heart, his brains; For proud and fiery and swift and bold— Wine of life from heart of gold, The blood of his heathen manhood rolled Full-billowed through his veins. 1859. THE PURPLE FLOWER OF THE HEATHER I On the grey lone keep stood the Lady fair, With the lonely stream beneath; New-numbed with horror, moaning there, Her eye-balls fixed in a death-like stare Across the darkening heath. II They leapt from their boat in the grim grey air, They strode on stern and slow; By the wrinkled waters cold and bare, Under the great clouds rolling there, All ruggedly rimmed with a fierce red glare From the stormy sunset low. III They stood foot to foot on the lone dark heath, Eye fixed on eye: A pause—and each blade has left its sheath To clash and to flash its keen cold death Under the turbid sky. IV Adown the long straight fir-tree aisles The long gusts sing and roar; The reeds all sigh through their shivering files To the sad stream creeping weary miles Across the barren moor. V The gale sweeps down through southern lands; Some stars peer faint and grey, On two stern shadows—weary hands Of tireless rage—with sullen brands Still urging deadly fray. VI For they fight on still, though they bleed and gasp, With sweep and ward and pierce; And the long glaives quiver in their clasp, As tree-boughs quiver in a tempest's grasp Because the grasp is fierce. VII The moon came slowly up the sky To see a mournful sight: The one the other kneeleth by To tear his heart forth ere he die— “Great God hath judged your life's deep lie! Confess, now, recreant knight!” VIII Some faint words thrilled the waiting air— “I speak—to pardon you. Sealed lips must ope for their own last prayer; Your outrage now is washed out, fair— Though with my blood not yours—I swear Both she and I were true.” IX Slow, slow, the moon moved through the sky All night above that plain; Still gazing down with her cold wan eye On one all wild with agony Beside another slain. X “His form is cold as the earth beside, His blood is cold as the dew. O cursèd, cursèd jealous pride! O, lost for ever, noblest bride! O, dear, dear friend, that I had died Ere death had come to you!” XI Slow, slow, the moon moved through the sky, About that turret's gloom; Staring mad with her lidless eye The Lady, who with groan nor sigh, But pale and stark and stonily, Leant staring for her doom. 1857. A WINTER'S NIGHT I O mournful, mournful wind! Sobbing and moaning over moor and height; Fleeing the dawn, and plunging anguish-blind Deeper and deeper into doleful night. II O Moon, so faint and wan! Sinking away from gloomy cloud to cloud, Whence sleet and snow are shaken; and the dawn Shall find the earth laid out in one blank shroud. III The noontide breeze may blow With lifeful pleasure o'er the throngs of men, Freed from their darkest lusts and bitterest woe, Earning the bread of healthful labours then. IV Throned in eternal day The Sun may smile—all joy when joys the King; Diffusing light and life and wealth for aye, How should he dream to pity anything? V But thou—pale Priestess born! Driven for ever through the shoreless sea Of spectral night; thy pure heart pierced and torn With sight of our worst sin and misery: VI And thou—O homeless wind! Flung forth wild-moaning through night's wilderness, Burdened with all worst agonies of our kind, To sink far off beneath the fatal stress: VII Well may you sob and cry, Breathing this night our voice of guilt and pain! Well may you gaze down sadly, O wan Eye, To which our wretched lives this night are plain! 1858. SIREN'S SONG Realm of the sea! Listen to me, Rising up softly to sing you to rest; Your queen and your love, your lily, your dove, Soothing with music your broad-heaving breast; Guarding your isles from bad spirits' wiles, When the weary sun closes his lids in the west. What shall I sing you to-night? Listen and listen, the waters all glisten A-gaze on the ever-sweet moon: She gives you beauty of light, I give you the bountiful boon Of slumber-sweet singing so lovely and free, Delicious for glee. All the sun-perfect day I dive and I play Adown through the azure and soft-yielding streams, To the golden-green waves and the coralline caves And the pale purple bowers lit with clear crystal gleams; Or I float swayed in rest, embraced and caressed In the mid-sea's entrancement of noon-languid dreams: Then in the night I may roam, Singing so sweetly, and chasing so featly The stars all a-dance in the deep; Or, like a beautiful foam, Ride up the shore on the sweep Of the long-sounding waves, and with wild laughs of glee Melt back to the sea. Realm of the sea! Mighty and free!— None else can hear now—list to my sigh; With a sweet love and dear do I charm you down here, As the moon with her love from on high; And I reign all alone on my pearlèd throne As the moon in her star-gemmed sky: I ever-sole like the Moon! This is the sadness that fretteth my gladness— Oh! for a lover so dear! Oh! for love's bountiful boon! Ah! there is no one to hear: How I would love him, how happy were we, My realm of the sea! GARIBALDI REVISITING ENGLAND This day all the eyes of our millions Are fixed on the south, where the light Of the waves of the Channel laughs fearless Round the thunder-clouds stored with our might; This day the great heart of the people Is throbbing expectant, upstirred By a pride and a joy and a sorrow The voice of those thunders should word. For what is this mighty heart glowing? For what do these earnest eyes scan? It glows for a hero and martyr, They look for a patriot, a Man; For a hero supreme in the battle, A martyr no griefs could subdue, A patriot the soul of his country, A man to the people all-true: For him who as grandly defended As grandly Mazzini ruled Rome; For him who gave Sicily, Naples, To those who had bartered his home; For him who on sad Aspromonte Was pierced by a countryman's ball,— Tu Brute! this Cæsar worst-wounded In soul yet forgiveth it all. Oh, let us, we people of England, We millions the worst and the best, Give welcome true, solemn, and thoughtful, Befitting the worth of our guest. All titles and wealth which the monarch Could proffer this man is above; The people alone can reward him In his own golden coin, loyal love. Nor let us forget in the shoutings And feasts of the triumph they plan, That he comes not alone in his glory; The Nation is here in the Man: Enceladus Italy, risen With earthquake, but pausing distrest; The left arm still brutally fettered, And Peter's rock crushing the breast. WITHERED LEAVES I Let the roses lie, dear, Let them lie; They are all thrown by, dear, All thrown by: What should they do now but quickly die? II Yester morn they flourished Fresh and fair; Dew and sunlight nourished, Bloomed they there, Blushing as their sweetness felt the air. III Yester eve he tore them From the tree; Stars that glimmered o'er them, Two or three, Set not ere they perished, woe is me! IV Scarcely seem they dead yet— Death is new; See the petals red yet, Scent and dew, All as when in life they blushing grew. V Touch them yet I dare not While they show As if dead they were not; Ah! I know Dreams of life in death but madden woe. VI Let them lie and wither, As is right; I may then steal hither In the night; Find them wan and shrivelled in death's blight; VII Gather each leaf slowly From its nook; Hoard them up as holy In the Book Wherein Memory now for Hope must look. 1857. THE CYPRESS AND THE ROSES Roses and roses year by year Do I plant and cherish here, With many a wistful sigh and tear, Cradling new in the self-same bier Where the dead be. Hope and care and love betrayed! Blighted buds, they all, all fade In the constant deadly shade Of this cypress tree. One black cypress shade will blight Myriads of roses of delight; One stern cypress will outlast Ages of roses withering fast, Too well I see. What is left me now to do? What, but sink at the dark root too; Let the baleful gloom and rue Kill also me. 1858. MEETING AGAIN Your eyes were burning with wild love and woe; They seared my inmost heart: We knew, we knew too well that I must go, Yet could not bear to part. We did not blame each other; that worst gall Of common sin was spared; Nor vindicate ourselves: confessing all, In silence each despaired. One yearning overwhelmed all strength and hope,— That then and there we might Sink down, embracing, under heaven's cope, Engulfed in death's deep night. And now again, after long bitter years, We are allowed to meet, And mingle henceforth all our sighs and tears While these two hearts shall beat: I from that fearful world where I was cast Among the multitude, To expiate the inexpiable Past By constant doing good: You from the sterner solitary life, By woe and sin possessed, And waging with them constant deadly strife Within thine own poor breast. Ah! can you really love me, whom you know So weak and foul of yore? Dear heart! I feel that evil long-ago But makes me love you more. Yet still that longing almost swayeth me,— That we should sink down deep, And side by side, from life's sore burthen free, Sleep death's eternal sleep. 1860. “ALLACE! THAT SAMYN SWEIT FACE!” “In 1549 was printed at St. Andrews a curious work entitled ‘Vedderburn's Complainte of Scotlande,’ in which are preserved the titles of no less than thirty-seven songs.”—The Book of Scottish Song, by Alex. Whitelaw: Preface, p. v. Among the thirty-seven titles is this most pathetic one, “Allace! that samyn sweit face.” I “Allace! that samyn sweit face!” Bitter tears have drowned the shine Wont to laugh in azure eyne; Fear hath blanched the laughing lips, And they tremble trying to speak; Pain hath cast a wan eclipse On the round and rosy cheek; Grief hath greyed the locks; and how Care hath wrinkled that smooth brow! “Allace! that samyn sweit face!” Sweet then, yet sweeter now! II “Allace! that samyn sweit face!” Eyes have lost the light of youth, But have kept their loving truth; Lips that tremble while they speak Speak the words that ravish me; And the forpined hollow cheek, Oh, it breaks my heart to see! Hair yet witnesseth a vow; Loyalty is on the brow: “Allace! that samyn sweit face!” Sweet then, yet sweetest now! III “Allace! that samyn sweit face!” Could one kindle up those eyes, Think you, with a love-surprise? Could a rain of kisses turn Those poor lips to bloom once more? Would those wan cheeks swell and burn Fed with joys of heretofore? Would caressing hands allow Not a furrow on that brow? “Allace! that samyn sweit face!” Dear then, yet dearest now! A REQUIEM Thou hast lived in pain and woe, Thou hast lived in grief and fear; Now thine heart can dread no blow, Now thine eyes can shed no tear: Storms round us shall beat and rave; Thou are sheltered in the grave. Thou for long, long years hast borne, Bleeding through Life's wilderness, Heavy loss and wounding scorn; Now thine heart is burdenless: Vainly rest for ours we crave; Thine is quiet in the grave. We must toil with pain and care, We must front tremendous Fate, We must fight with dark Despair: Thou dost dwell in solemn state, Couched triumphant, calm and brave, In the ever-holy grave. 1858. THE JOLLY VETERANS Come rest, come rest, my leal old friends, Loll at ease round the old round table; Now the sun descends and our duty ends, We'll have mirth as long as we're able. Chorus. Then for all the rich blood we have ever outpoured Let us pour in the red wine fairly; Though our hands have warred till weak for the sword, They can wield round the wine-cup rarely. We have marched, we have fought, in the sweltry sun All the day since reveillé's blaring; Now the march is done and the field is won We've a right to rest and good faring. Then for all, &amp;c. See a rich warm light in the west still glows Though the sun has sunk before us, Though the grey shades close on the earth's repose, And the black night gathers o'er us. Then for all, &amp;c. Though our voices break as our songs we troll, Though our eyes and our limbs fail weary, Let each trusty soul have his pipe and his bowl, And the last few hours shall be cheery. Then for all, &amp;c. Till the thick night wraps both the vale and the steep Where through bad luck and good we fought fair, boys; Till we sink in the deep, in the long still sleep, Which shall drown all troubles and care, boys. Then for all, &amp;c. And what reck we, when that sleep is out, What may come with the dawn of the morrow? We shall rise fresh and stout, with the old hearts, no doubt, To confront toil and danger and sorrow. Then for all, &amp;c. 1857. A CAPSTAN CHORUS Rolling along, bowling along, Over the seas we go; And we heave up our anchor singing our song, With a Yeo, cheery men, yeo! Yeo, cheery men, yeo! The wind and the waves they will beat us about, And the rocks lie a-waiting below; But our yards they are trim and our timbers are stout; Sing a Yeo, cheery men, yeo! Yeo, cheery men, yeo! Monstrous and terrible growls the old sea When storms make his white rage grow; Grim death lurks then in his heart for we; But Yeo, cheery men, yeo! Yeo, cheery men, yeo! For well are we nursed on his broad boon breast When his rage shall overblow, Fed full of the free bold life which is best; Sing a Yeo, cheery men, yeo! Yeo, cheery men, yeo! How he swings him along 'neath his ocean of air In his great heart's careless flow! How we win his love when his wrath we dare! Sing a Yeo, cheery men, yeo! Yeo, cheery men, yeo! Rolling along, bowling along, Over the seas we go; And we heave up our anchor singing our song, With a yeo, cheery men, yeo! Yeo, cheery men, yeo! 1857. TO A PIANISTE I saw thee once, I see thee now; Thy pure young face, thy noble mien, Thy truthful eyes, thy radiant brow; All childlike, lovely, and serene; Rapt in harmonious visions proud, Scarce conscious of the audient crowd. I heard thee when the instrument, Possessed and quickened by thy soul, Impassioned and intelligent, Responded to thy full control With all the treasures of its dower, Its sweetest and its grandest power. I saw and heard with such delight As rarely charms our lower sphere: Blind Handel would not miss his sight, Thy beauty voiced thus in his ear; Beethoven in that face would see His glorious unheard harmony. 1859. A RECUSANT The Church stands there beyond the orchard-blooms: How yearningly I gaze upon its spire! Lifted mysterious through the twilight glooms, Dissolving in the sunset's golden fire, Or dim as slender incense morn by morn Ascending to the blue and open sky. For ever when my heart feels most forlorn It murmurs to me with a weary sigh, How sweet to enter in, to kneel and pray With all the others whom we love so well! All disbelief and doubt might pass away, All peace float to us with its Sabbath bell. Conscience replies, There is but one good rest, Whose head is pillowed upon Truth's pure breast 1858. A SERGEANT'S MESS SONG With our arms round the waists of the charming girls, Through the galop-sweeps and the swift waltz-whirls, While our beards are brushed by their dancing curls, Dance, boys, dance! With the old black pipe and the steaming glass, And a toast to the health of each sonsie lass, And a right jolly set the toast to pass, Drink, boys, drink! For we have our hold of the world to-day, And must snatch our share of it while we may, Before they bury us out of the way: Dance, boys, dance! So we'll smoke our pipe, and we'll drink our glass, And we'll play our game, and we'll hug our lass; And as for the rest—why the devil's an ass: Drink, boys, drink! SONNET [Through foulest fogs of my own sluggish soul] Through foulest fogs of my own sluggish soul, Through midnight glooms of all the wide world's guilt, Through sulphurous cannon-clouds that surge and roll Above the steam of blood in anger spilt; Through all the sombre earth-oppressing piles Of old cathedral temples which expand Sepulchral vaults and monumental aisles, Hopeless and freezing in the lifeful land; I gaze and seek with ever-longing eyes For God, the Love-Supreme, all-wise, all-good: Alas! in vain; for over all the skies A dark and awful shadow seems to brood, A numbing, infinite, eternal gloom: I tremble in the consciousness of Doom. A CHANT While the trees grow, While the streams flow, While the winds blow, We will be free! Free as trees growing, Free as streams flowing, Free as winds blowing, Evermore free! 1857. ON GEORGE HERBERT'S POEMS What are these leaves dark-spotted and acerb? “A very holy herb:” To what good use may I this herb convert? “Press it on thy soul's hurt:” When herb unto the hurt I thus apply? “Herb-ert is sanctity.” ON A BROKEN PIPE Neglected now it lies a cold clay form, So late with living inspirations warm: Type of all other creatures formed of clay— What more than it for Epitaph have they? A PROEM “Carouse in the Past.” Robert Browning's Saul. We will drink anew of old pleasures; In the golden chalice of song We will pour out the wine-like treasures Of memories hidden long. Old memories, hidden but cherished, In a heart-nook deep and calm; They have not faded and perished Like the old friends they embalm. We will call them forth from their darkness As we call forth a rare old wine Which the long rich years have mellowed Till the flavour is divine. In a glorious intoxication Will we revel while such drink may last; And dead to the leaden-houred Present, Live in golden hours of the Past. 1854. THE END</field>
