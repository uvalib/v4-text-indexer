      <field name="fulltext">[VOL. II., III., IV.] VOL. II. VIRGIL's ÆNEID. It is allowed at present, that the proemial lines of a poem, in which the general subject is proposed, must always be void of glitter and embellishment. “The first lines of Paradise Lost,” says Mr. Addison, “are perhaps as plain, simple and unadorned as any of the whole poem, in which particular the author has conformed himself to the example of Homer and the precept of Horace.” This observation seems to have been made by an implicit adoption of the common opinion without much consideration, either of the precept or example. Had Horace been consulted, he would have been found to have directed what should be comprised in the proposition, not how it should be expressed, and to have commended Homer in opposition to a meaner poet, not for the gradual elevation of his diction, but the expansion of his plan, for displaying events which he had not promised, not for producing unexpected elegancies of stile. ? Speciosa dehinc miracula promit Antiphaten Scyllamque, &amp; cum Cyclope Charybdim. If the exordial lines of Homer be compared with the rest of the poem, they will not appear remarkable for plainness or simplicity, but rather eminently adorned and illuminated. ????? ??? ??????, ?????, ??????????, ?? ???? ????? ???????, ???? ?????? ????? ?[]???????? ??????? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ????? ??? ???? ????. ????? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ????? ????? ?? ???? ?????, ????????? ?? ?? ????? ??? ?????? ???????? ???? ???? ?? ??????? ???????? ??????? ???. ????? ??? ?????????? ???????????? ??????, ??????, ?? ???? ???? ????????? ??????? ??????? ????? ? ?????? ???????? ???????? ????, ??? ?????? ??, ??? ??????? ????, ???? ??? ????. The first verses of the Iliad are eminently splendid, and the proposition of the Æneid closes with dignity and magnificence not often to be found even in the poetry of Virgil. The intent of the introduction is to raise expectation and suspend it; something therefore must be discovered and something concealed: The poet, while the fertility of his invention is yet unknown, may properly recommend himself by the grace of his language. He that reveals too much or promises too little, he that never irritates the intellectual appetite, or who immediately satiates it, equally defeats his own purpose; and since it is necessary to the pleasure of the reader, that few events should be anticipated, by what can his attention be invited, but by grandeur of expression? Rambler, N?. 158. THE FIRST BOOK. The ARGUMENT. The Trojans, after a seven Year's Voyage, set-sail for Italy, but are overtaken by a dreadful Storm, which Æolus raises at Juno's Request. The Tempest sinks one Ship, and scatters the rest: Neptune drives off the Winds, and calms the Seas. Æneas with his own, and six more Ships, arrives safe at an African Port. Venus complains to Jupiter of her Son's Misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind Reception among the Carthaginians. Æneas, going out to discover the Country, meets his Mother in the Shape of a Huntress, who conveys him in a Cloud to Carthage; where he sees his Friends whom he thought lost, and receives a kind Entertainment from the Queen. Dido, by a Device of Venus, begins to have a Passion for him, and, after some Discourse with him desires the History of his Adventures since the Siege of Troy; which is the Subject of the two following Books. Arms, and the Man I sing, the first who bore His course to Latium from the Trojan shore; By fate expell'd, on land and ocean tost, Before he reach'd the fair Lavinian coast: V. 5. By the gods.] Vi superûm, saevae memorem Junonis ob iram. The sense goes on, just as well, without this verse, as with it. Since Virgil has said here that it was by Juno's means; it is odd enough, that he should ask his muse, by whose means it was, ver. 8. infra. The translator has avoided this seeming impropriety.Doom'd by the Gods a length of wars to wage, And urg'd by Juno's unrelenting rage; Ere the brave hero rais'd, in these abodes, His destin'd walls, and fix'd his wand'ring gods. Hence the fam'd Latian line, and senates come, And the proud triumphs, and the towr's of Rome. Say, Muse, what causes could so far incense Celestial pow'rs, and what the dire offence That mov'd heav'n's awful empress to impose On such a pious prince a weight of woes, Expos'd to dangers, and with toils opprest? Can rage so fierce inflame an heavenly Breast? Against th'Italian coast, of ancient fame A city rose, and Carthage was the name; A Tyrian colony; from Tiber far; Rich, rough, and brave, and exercis'd in war. Which Juno far above all realms, above Her own dear Samos, honoured with her love. Here stood her chariot, here her armour lay, Here she design'd, would destiny give way, Ev'n then the seat of universal sway. But of a race she heard, that should destroy The Tyrian tow'rs, a race deriv'd from Troy, Who proud in arms, triumphant by their Swords, Should rise in time, the world's victorious Lords; By fate design'd her Carthage to subdue, And on her ruin'd empire raise a new. This fear'd the goddess; and in mind she bore The late long war her fury rais'd before For Greece with Troy; nor was her wrath resign'd, But ev'ry cause hung heavy on her mind; Her form disdain'd, and Paris' judgment, roll Deep in her breast, and kindle all her soul; Th'immortal Honours of the ravish'd boy, And last, the whole detested race of Troy. 40. With all these motives fir'd, &amp;c.] Observe (says Catrou) the delicate art of Virgil in this passage: in the enumeration of the causes of those quarrels and disgusts that animate Juno against the Trojans, not one of them falls personally upon Æneas. He is the object of this goddess's hatred only as he is a Trojan. By this conduct the poet excites the compassion of his readers in favour of Æneas.With all these motives fir'd, from Latium far She drove the relicks of the Grecian war: Fate urg'd their course; and long they wander'd o'er The spacious ocean, tost from shore to shore. So vast the work to build the mighty frame, And raise the glories of the Roman name! Scarce from Sicilian shores the shouting train Spread their broad sails, and plough'd the foamy main; 48. With haughty Juno.] —Virgil, we see, introduces machinery in the very beginning of his poem; the reason of which, and the use of machinery in general, was never so well explained as lately, by Mr. Spence in his Polymetis: whose judicious observations I shall set down at length, because they will serve to illustrate a great number of passages in the Æneid. The greatest of the ancient poets seem to have held, that every thing in the moral as well as the natural world, was carried on by the influence and direction of the supreme being. It was Jupiter that actuated every thing, and in some sense might be said to do every thing that was done. This universal principle of action they considered, for their own ease, as divided into so many several personages, as they had occasion for causes. Hence every part of the creation was filled by them with deities; and no action was performed without the assistance of some god or other, for every power superior to man they called by that name. This way of thinking (or at least this way of talking) was received by many of their philosophers as well as poets, though it was particularly serviceable to the latter, and therefore appears so frequently in their works. Petronius Arbiter tells us, that a good epic poet should always lay hold of this advantage; and should carry on his whole action, by the help of what we call machinery: and when Horace speaks against gods being introduced too freely, in a passage that is so often quoted, and sometimes not quite to the purpose, he speaks only of the introducing them too freely on the stage: for in epic poems, the very best of the ancient poets, and the greatest patterns for writing that ever were, introduce them perpetually and without reserve. Homer, who was so highly admired by Horace, scarce does any thing without them; and Virgil, who was both admired and loved so much by him (and whose Æneid was even published ten years before Horace died) follows Homer more closely in this, than in any other point I know of. But the example of Virgil is, I think, sufficient for me at present; who has employed machinery so much and so freely in his Æneid, that almost the whole of the story is carried on by the intervention of the gods. If we just run over the first book in this light, we shall see, that if Æneas meets with a storm, just after his first setting out, it is Æolus that raises it at the request of Juno, and by the operation of the several genius's that preside over the winds: if the Sea grows calm again, it is by the appearance of the deity who presides over that element; who countermands those winds and sends them back to their caves. If Æneas lands on the coast of Afric; and is to be kindly received at Carthage, it is Mercury that is sent by Jupiter to soften the minds of the Carthaginians and their queen toward him. And if he escapes all the attacks and dangers in passing through an unknown country, and an inhospitable people, till he comes to their capital; it is Venus who shrouds him in a cloud, and protects him from all danger. In fine, if the queen falls in love with him when he is arrived there; though she be represented as not old, and he as very handsome: yet must Cupid do no less, than undergo a transformation; to lie on her breast and insinuate that soft passion there. This sort of management which is used so much by Virgil in the entrance of his poem, runs through it quite to the end; and appears as fully in Æneas's combat with Turnus in the last book, as it did in his arrival at Carthage in the first. Every step and progression in the story, is full of machinery; or, according to Petronius's general rule, is carried on by the interposition and administration of the Gods. Polymetis, Dialogue xx. p. 317.When haughty Juno thus her rage exprest; Th'eternal wound still rankling in her breast. Then must I stop? are all my labours vain? And must this Trojan prince in Latium reign? Belike, the fates may baffle Juno's aims; And why could Pallas, with avenging flames, Burn a whole navy of the Grecian ships, And whelm the scatter'd Argives in the deeps? 56. Of Ajax.] Virgil might here have an eye to some celebrated picture of this Ajax. (Apollodori est) Ajax ful mine incensus, qui Pergami spectatur hodie. Plin. l. xxxv. c. 9. p. 429. Edit. Elzevir.She, for the crime of Ajax, from above Launch'd thro' the clouds the fiery bolts of Jove; Dash'd wide his Fleet, and, as her tempests flew, Expos'd the ocean's inmost depths to view. Then, while transfix'd the blasted wretch expires Flames from his breast, and fires succeeding fires, Snatch'd in a whirlwind, with a sudden shock, She hurl'd him headlong on a pointed rock. But I, who move supreme in heaven's abodes, Jove's sister-wife, and empress of the gods, With this one nation must a war maintain For years on years; and wage that war in vain! And now what suppliants will invoke my name, Adore my pow'r, or bid my altars flame? Thus fir'd with rage and vengeance, down she flies To dark Æolia, from the distant skies, Impregnated with storms; whose tyrant binds The blust'ring tempests, and reluctant winds. Their rage imperial Æolus restrains With rocky dungeons, and enormous chains. The bellowing brethren, in the mountain pent, Roar round the cave, and struggle for a vent. From his high throne, their fury to asswage, He shakes his sceptre, and controuls their rage; Or down the void their rapid whirls had driv'n Earth, air, and ocean, and the tow'rs of Heaven. But Jove, the mighty ruin to prevent, In gloomy caves th'aërial captives pent; O'er their wild rage the pond'rous rocks he spread, And hurl'd huge heaps of mountains on their head; And gave a king, commission'd to restrain And curb the tempest, or to loose the rein. Whom thus the queen addrest: Since mighty Jove, The king of men, and sire of gods above, Gives thee, great Æolus, the pow'r to raise Storms at thy sovereign will, or smooth the seas; A race, I long have labour'd to destroy, Waft to Hesperia the remains of Troy. Ev'n now their navy cuts the Tuscan floods, Charg'd with their exiles, and their vanquish'd gods. Wing all thy furious winds; o'erwhelm the train, Disperse, or plunge their vessels in the main. Twice sev'n bright nymphs, of beauteous shape are mine; For thy reward the fairest I'll resign, The charming Deiopeia shall be thine; She, on thy bed, long blessings shall confer, And make thee father of a race like her. 'Tis your's great queen, replies the pow'r, to lay The task, and mine to listen and obey. By you, I sit a guest with gods above, And share the graces and the smiles of Jove: By you, these realms, this sceptre I maintain, And wear these honours of the stormy reign. 109. So spoke th'obsequious god.] He that would be a real poet, says Bossu, must leave it to historians to say that a fleet was shatter'd by a storm, and cast upon a strange coast: and must say with Virgil, that Juno went to Æolus, and that this god, upon her request, unloosed the winds against Æneas. Let him leave it to an historian to write, that a young prince behaved himself on all occasions with great prudence, wisdom and discretion: but let him say with Homer, that Minerva led him by the hand in all his enterprizes.So spoke th'obsequious God; and, while he spoke, Whirl'd his vast spear, and pierc'd the hollow rock. The winds, embattled, as the mountain rent, Flew all at once impetuous thro' the vent: Earth, in their course, with giddy whirls they sweep, Rush to the seas, and bare the bosom of the deep: 115. East, West, &amp;c.] This storm of Virgil's probably contributed towards setting almost all the Roman poets after him a storm painting. In Agam. Sc. iii. we have a puerile imitation of it. Lucan has another, carried to excess: Ovid, according to his manner, has several: and Flaccus one, Argon. i. 641. which was certainly taken from this; unless both that and this were originally copied from Apollonius Rhodius. Juvenal seems to ridicule their overcharging their pieces; where speaking of a real storm, he says, 'twas as bad as a poetical one. Sat. xxii. 24. Spence.East, West, and South, all black with tempests, roar, And roll vast billows to the trembling shore. The cordage cracks; with unavailing cries The Trojans mourn; while sudden clouds arise, And ravish from their sight the splendors of the skies. Night hovers o'er the floods; the day retires; The heav'ns flash thick with momentary fires; Loud thunders shake the poles; from ev'ry place Grim death appear'd, and glar'd in ev'ry face. 124. In horror fixt the Trojan hero.] The objections of those critics, who from this passage arraign Æneas of cowardice, are most weak and frivolous. All fear is not cowardice, as no fierceness is true courage. Æneas is afraid of the gods, and for his country: both which are consistent with the truest magnanimity; nay there can be no true magnanimity without them. Trapp. There is a very remarkable passage in a letter of Mr. Pope to the duke of Buckingham, which this subject puts me in mind of. I can tell your grace, no less a hero than my lord Peterborow, when a person complimented him for never being afraid, made this answer; “Sir, shew me a danger that I think an imminent and real one, and I promise you I'll be as much afraid as any of you.” A braver answer was never made by any one of the ancient heroes whatever.In horror fixt the Trojan heroe stands, He groans, and spreads to heav'n his lifted hands. Thrice happy those! whose fate it was to fall (Exclaims the chief) beneath the Trojan wall. 129. Oh! 'twas a glorious fate.] Mr. Pope observes, that Virgil has borrowed this thought from a passage in the twenty-first Iliad; where Achilles is in the very same circumstances as Æneas, in danger of being drowned. He adds, nothing is more agreeable than this wish to the heroic character of Achilles: glory is his prevailing passion; he grieves not that he must die, but that he should die unlike a man of honour. Lucan, in the fifth Book of his Pharsalia, representing Cæsar in the same circumstance, has, I think, carried yet farther the character of ambition, and a noble thirst of glory, in his hero; when after he has repined in the same manner with Achilles and Æneas, he acquiesces at last in the reflection of the glory he had already acquired, ? Licet ingentis abruperit actus Festinata dies Fatis, sat magna peregi, Arctoas domui gentes; inimica subegi Arma manu: vidit magnum mihi Roma secundum. and wishes that his obscure fate might be concealed, only that all the world might still fear and expect him. This last circumstance is exceedingly great. ? Lacerum retinete cadaver Fluctibus in mediis; desint mihi busta, rogusque, Dum metuar semper, terrâque expecter ab omni. I am glad of any opportunity of doing justice to this neglected author; who, tho' by no means a chaste and correct writer, yet abounds in some of the most noble, animated and exalted sentiments, that can any where be found.Oh! 'twas a glorious fate to die in fight, To die, so bravely, in their parents' sight! Oh! had I there, beneath Tydides' hand, That bravest heroe of the Grecian band, Pour'd out this soul, with martial glory fir'd, And in that field triumphantly expir'd, Where Hector fell by fierce Achilles' spear, And great Sarpedon, the renown'd in war; Where Simöis' streams, incumber'd with the slain, Roll'd shields, and helms, and heroes to the main. Thus while he mourns, the Northern blast prevails, Breaks all his oars, and rends his flying sails; The prow turns round; the galley leaves her side Bare to the working waves, and roaring tide; While in huge heaps the gathering surges spread, And hang in wat'ry mountains o'er his head. These ride on waves sublime; those see the ground Low in the boiling deeps, and dark profound. Three shatter'd gallies the strong Southern blast On hidden rocks, with dreadful fury, cast; Th'Italians call them altars, as they stood Sublime, and heav'd their backs above the flood. Three more, fierce Eurus on the Syrtes threw From the main sea, and (terrible to view) He dash'd, and left the vessels, on the land, Intrench'd with mountains of surrounding sand. Struck by a billow, in the hero's view, From prow to stern the shatter'd galley flew Which bore Orontes, and the Lycian crew: Swept off the deck, the pilot from the ship, Stunn'd by the stroke, shot headlong down the deep: The vessel, by the surge tost round and round, Sunk, in the whirling gulf devour'd and drown'd. Some from the dark abyss emerge again; Arms, planks, and treasures, float along the main. And now thy ship, Ilioneus, gives way, Nor thine, Achates, can resist the sea; Nor old Alethes his strong galley saves; Then Abas yields to the victorious waves: The storm dissolves their well-compacted sides, Which drink at many a leak the hostile tides. Mean time th'Imperial monarch of the main Heard the loud tumults in his wat'ry reign, And saw the furious tempest wide around Work up the waters, from the vast profound. Then for his liquid realms alarm'd, the God Lifts his high head above the stormy flood, Majestic and serene: he rolls his eyes, And scatter'd wide the Trojan navy spies, Opprest by waves below, by thunders from the skies. Full well he knew his sister's endless hate, Her wiles and arts to sink the Trojan state. To Eurus, and the Western blast, he cry'd, Does your high birth inspire this boundless pride, Audacious winds! without a pow'r from me, To raise, at will, such mountains on the sea? Thus to confound heav'n, earth, the air, and main? Whom I—but first I'll calm the waves again. But if you tempt my rage a second time, Know, that some heavier vengeance waits the crime. Hence; fly with speed; from me, your tyrant tell, That to my lot this wat'ry empire fell. Bid him his rocks, your darksome dungeons, keep, Nor dare usurp the trident of the deep. There, in that gloomy court, display his pow'r, And hear his tempests round their caverns roar. V. 194. He spoke and speaking chac'd, &amp;c.] In the works of the ancients, nature and machinery generally go hand in hand, and serve chiefly to manifest one another. Thus, for instance, in the storm in the very beginning of the Æneid; these imaginary beings are introduced in every part of it: but it is only such beings, as are proper for the part in which they are introduced; and they appear there only to carry on the true order of the natural effects. The goddess of the upper air desires the God of the winds, to let loose those turbulent subjects of his; they are let loose; the sea is immediately all in a tumult; and the God of the sea appears, to make it all calm again. There seems to me, not to be any more difference in this, and the natural account of the thing; than if you should say, that all the parts of matter tend towards each other; and I should say, that some spiritual power always impels them towards each other. The effects are just the same; only in one case we look upon them as acting; and in the other as acted upon. See Mr. Spence's Polymetis, Dial. xx. These judicious reflexions applied in a proper manner to other fables and machines, may serve as a key to all the ancient mythology; and shew most of their stories, idle as they seem on the first view, to be full of good sense and sound philosophy at the bottom.He spoke, and speaking chac'd the clouds away, Hush'd the loud billows, and restor'd the day. Cymothoë guards the vessels in the shock, And Triton heaves 'em from the pointed rock. With his huge trident, the majestic God Clear'd the wild Syrtes, and compos'd the flood; Then mounted on his radiant car he rides, And wheels along the level of the tides. As when sedition fires th'ignoble crowd, And the wild rabble storms, and thirsts for blood: Of stones and brands, a mingled tempest flies, With all the sudden arms that rage supplies: If some grave sire appears, amid the strife, In morals strict, and innocence of life, All stand attentive; while the sage controuls Their wrath, and calms the tumult of their souls. So did the roaring deeps their rage compose, When the great father of the floods arose. Rapt by his steeds, he flies in open day, Throws up the reins, and skims the wat'ry way. The Trojans, weary'd with the storm, explore The nearest land, and reach the Libyan shore. Far in a deep recess, her jutting sides 217. This is a most beautiful and picturesque description. Poussin never painted a more solemn scene. Catrou is of opinion, that the poet had in view the port of Ancona. Lucretius has painted something like this: and the lines are very poetical. ? Noctivagi sylvestria templa tenebant Nympharum, quibus exibant humore fluenta Lubrica, proluvie largâ lavere humida saxa, Humida saxa super viridi stillantia musco, Et partim plano scatere atq; erumpere campo. Lib. iv. 945.An isle projects, to break the rolling tides, And forms a port, where, curling from the sea, The waves steal back, and wind into a bay. On either side, sublime in air, arise Two tow'ring rocks, whose summits brave the skies; Low at their feet the sleeping ocean lies: Crown'd with a gloomy shade of waving woods, Their awful brows hang nodding o'er the floods. 225. Secret grotto.] There is a place in the kingdom of Tunis (under the promontory of Mercury) now called Cape Bon) a few miles east of Carthage, that exactly answers the description of this grotto. This hollow goes in twenty or thirty fathoms, under the hills; and those who took out the stone from it (for it seems to have been a quarry) left a sort of pillars at proper distances, to support the weight at top from falling in. The arches which these pillars help to form, lye open to the sea; there are little streams perpetually draining from the rocks; and seats of stone formed within, probably for the use of those who worked in that quarry. There is a clift on each side; and the brow of the mountain is overshadowed with trees. Mr. Spence, from Dr. Shaw; who has given a farther account of them in his travels, page 157.Oppos'd to these, a secret grotto stands, The haunt of Nereids, fram'd hy nature's hands; Where polish'd seats appear of living stone, And limpid rills, that tinkle as they run. No cable here, nor circling anchor binds The floating vessel, harrast with the winds. The Dardan heroe brings to this retreat Sev'n shatter'd ships, the relicts of his fleet. With fierce desire to gain the friendly strand, The Trojans leap in rapture to the land, And, drench'd in brine, lye stretch'd along the sand. 236. Achates strikes the flint.] 'Tis remarkable that M. Segrais has omitted this circumstance in his translation. He tells us, that to adapt his work to the French manners, he dared not give Achates the great favourite of the hero so mean an office as that of lighting a fire. The Latin tongue and the antients, (continues he) are able to give a gracefulness to these kind of paintings, and to make such low circumstances agreeable; but they would be highly disgusting to our age. What can give one a stronger idea of the false delicacy of the French nation, and of the incapacity of their language to describe several little circumstances, which ought to have a place in an epic poem?Achates strikes the flint, and from the stroke The lurking seeds of fire in sparkles broke; The catching flame on leaves and stubble preys, Then gathers strength, and mounts into a blaze. Tir'd with their labours, they prepare to dine, And grind their corn, infected with the brine. 242. Æneas mounts a rock] Nothing can more entertain the imagination than the hero's mounting this hill to examine on what kind of coast they were landed, and his seeing no object but the herd of deer, grazing wildly. This amusing prospect, and the description of that beautiful, retired, and safe harbour in line 220. make a fine contrast to the preceding tumult and dreadful images of the storm.Æneas mounts a rock, and thence surveys The wide and wat'ry prospect of the seas; Now hopes the shatter'd Phrygian ships to find, Antheus, or Capys, driving with the wind; And now, Caïcus' glitt'ring arms to spy, Wide o'er the vast horizon darts his eye. The chief could view no vessel on the main; But three tall stags stalk'd proudly o'er the plain; Before the herd their beamy fronts they rais'd; Stretch'd out in length, the train along the valley graz'd. The Prince, who spy'd 'em on the shore below, Stop'd short—then snatch'd the feather'd shafts and bow, Which good Achates bore: his arrows fled; And first he laid the lordly leaders dead; Next all th'ignoble vulgar he pursu'd, And with his shafts dispers'd 'em thro' the wood: Nor ceas'd the chief, 'till, stretch'd beneath his feet, Lay sev'n huge stags, the number of his fleet. Back to the port the victor bends his way, And with his friends divides the copious prey. The generous wine, to crown the genial feast, Which kind Acestes gave his parting guest, Next to his sad associates he imparts; And with these words revives their drooping hearts. Friends! we have known more toils, than now we know, By long experience exercis'd in woe; And soon to these disasters shall be giv'n A certain period, by relenting heav'n. Think, how you saw the dire Cyclopean shore, Heard Scylla's rocks, and all her monsters, roar. Dismiss your fears; on these misfortunes past Your minds with pleasure may reflect at last. Thro' such varieties of woes, we tend To promis'd Latium, where our toils shall end: Where the kind fates shall peaceful seats ordain, And Troy, in all her glories, rise again. With manly patience bear your present state, And with firm courage wait a better fate. So spoke the chief, and hid his inward smart; Hope smooth'd his looks, but anguish rack'd his heart. The hungry crowd prepare, without delay, To dress the banquet, and to share the prey. Some from the body strip the smoaking hide, Some cut in morsels, and the parts divide; These bid, with busy care, the flames aspire; Those roast the limbs, yet quiv'ring, o'er the fire. Thus, while their strength and spirits they restore, The brazen cauldrons smoak along the shore. Stretch'd on the grass, their bodies they recline, Enjoy the rich repast, and quaff the gen'rous wine. The rage of hunger quell'd, they past away In long and melancholy talk the day; Nor knew, by fears and hopes alternate led, Whether to deem their friends distrest, or dead. Apart the pious chief, who suffer'd most, 297. Gyas and Cloanthus.] Virgil hath been greatly censured for a want of variety in his characters, and because he hath not fill'd his poem with so many heroes as Homer hath done. Ajax, Diomed, Idomeneus, &amp;c. are all shining characters, and are all diversified and distinguished from one another. Whereas the faithful Achates, the brave Gyas, and the brave Cloanthus (fortemque Gyan fortemque Cloanthum) the same over and over again, are of no material use in the poem, and serve only to fill now and then the gap of a verse or two. Mr. Voltaire's answer to this censure is well worthy the reader's notice. I am apt to think, says he, that such an objection turns a great deal to the advantage of the Æneid: Virgil sung the actions of Æneas, and Homer the idleness of Achilles. The Greek poet lay under the necessity of supplying the absence of his first hero, with some other warriors; but what was judicious in Homer, would have been preposterous in Virgil: he knew too much of his art, to drown his principal character in the croud of many other heroes, indifferent to the main action. Thus he found the way to center our concern in Æneas; he interests us for him by never losing sight of him, while Homer presenting us with the shifting scene of so many shining characters, interests us for none. Mr. Addison's opinion on this subject is likewise worthy the attention of the reader. Virgil, says he, is very barren in this part of his poem, (the diversity of characters) and has but little varied the manners of the principal persons in it. His Æneas is a compound of valour and piety, Achates calls himself his friend, but takes no occasion of shewing himself so: Mnestheus, Sergestus, Gyas, and Cloanthus, are all of them men of the same stamp and character. Virgil was so very nice and delicate a writer, that probably he might not think his compliment to Augustus so great, or so artfully concealed, if he had scattered his praises more promiscuously, and made his court to others in the same poem. Had he entertained any such design, Agrippa must in justice have challenged the second place; and if Agrippa's representative had been admitted, Æneas would have had very little to do; which would not have redounded much to the honour of his emperor. If therefore Virgil has shadowed any great person besides Augustus in his characters, they are to be found only in the meaner actors of his poem, among the disputers for a petty victory in the fifth book, and perhaps in some few other places.Bemoans brave Gyas and Cloanthus lost: For Lycus' fate, for Amycus he weeps, And great Orontes, whelm'd beneath the deeps. Now, from high heav'n, imperial Jove surveys The nations, shores, and navigable seas; There, as he sate, inthron'd above the skies, Full on the Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes. When, lo! the mournful queen of love appears; Her starry eyes were dim'd with streaming tears; Who to the sire her humble suit addrest, The schemes of fate revolving in his breast. Oh thou! whose sacred, and eternal sway, Aw'd by thy thunders, men, and Gods obey; What have my poor exhausted Trojans done? Or what, alas! my dear unhappy son? Still, for the sake of Italy, deny'd All other regions, all the world beside? Sure, once you promis'd, that a race divine Of Roman chiefs should spring from Teucer's line; The world in future ages to command, And in their empire grasp the sea and land. Oh! sov'reign father, say! what cause could move The fixt unalterable word of Jove? Which sooth'd my grief, when Ilion felt her doom; And Troy I balanc'd with the fates of Rome. But see! their fortune still pursues her blow; When wilt thou fix a period to their woe? In safety, bold Antenor broke his way Thro' hosts of foes, and pierc'd th'Illyrian bay, 326. Where thro' nine] The river Timavus bursts out all at once, from the bottom of a mountain, and divides itself into nine different streams before it runs into the Adriatic sea. 'Tis so large itself that Virgil here calls it a sea, mare proruptum &amp; pelago sonanti. As it is at the head of the gulph of Venice, the Italians now call it la madre del mare; as if they thought all that sea was supplied from it. Holdsworth.Where, thro' nine ample mouths, Timavus pours, Wide as a sea, and deluges the shores; The flood rebellows, and the mountain roars. Yet with his colonies, secure he came, Rais'd Padua's walls, and gave the realms a name. Then fix'd his Trojan arms; his labours cease; And now the hoary monarch reigns in peace. But we, your progeny, ordain'd to rise, And share th'eternal honours of the skies, To glut the rage of ohe, our vessels lost, Barr'd by her vengeance, from the promis'd coast. Are these the palms that virtue must obtain? And is our empire thus restor'd again? The sire of men and gods, superior, smil'd On the sad queen, and gently kiss'd his child. Then, with those looks that clear the clouded skies, And calm the raging tempest, he replies. Daughter, dismiss your fears; by doom divine Fixt are the fates of your immortal line. Your eyes Lavinium's promis'd walls shall see, And here we ratify our first decree. Your son, the brave Æneas, soon shall rise, Himself a god; and mount the starry skies. To sooth your care, these secrets I relate From the dark volumes of eternal fate: The chief fair Italy shall reach, and there With mighty nations wage a dreadful war, New cities raise, the savage natives awe, And to the conquer'd kingdoms give the law. The fierce Rutulians vanquish'd by his sword, Three years shall Latium own him sovereign lord. Your dear Ascanius then, the royal boy, (Now call'd Iülus, since the fall of Troy) While thirty rolling years their orbs compleat, Shall wear the crown, and from Lavinium's seat Transfer the kingdom; and, of mighty length Raise tow'ring Alba, glorying in her strength. There, shall the Trojan race enjoy the pow'r, And fill the throne three hundred winters more. Ilia, the royal priestess, next shall bear Two lovely infants to the god of war. Nurst by a tawny wolf, her eldest son, Imperial Romulus, shall mount the throne; From his own name, the people Romans call, And from his father Mars, his rising wall. No limits have I fixt, of time, or place, To the vast empire of the godlike race. Ev'n haughty Juno shall the nation love, Who now alarms earth, seas, and heav'n above; And join her friendly counsels to my own, With endless fame the sons of Rome to crown, The world's majestic lords, the nation of the gown. This word be fate—an hour shall wing its way, When Troy in dust shall proud Mycenae lay. In Greece, Assaracus, his sons shall reign, And vanquisht Argos wear the victor's chain. Then Caesar, call'd by great Iülus' name, (Whose empire ocean bounds, the stars his fame) Sprung from the noble Trojan line, shall rise Charg'd with his Eastern spoils, and mount the skies. Him, shall you see, advanc'd to these abodes; Ador'd by Rome; a god among the gods. From that blest hour all violence shall cease, 389. The age grow mild] Here it might have been expected that the poet should have enlarged upon Augustus; whom it was his great business to praise. So an ordinary poet would have done. But Virgil is so far from it, that he does not here say one word about him; hints at his reign, but says nothing of his person; nay immediately breaks off when he comes to that period. This is surprizing, and leaves the mind in suspence. Virgil very well knew the force of Horace's rule, Pleraque differat, et praesens in tempus omittat. he had two more proper places for that subject, and for them he reserved it. Trapp.The age grow mild; and soften into peace. With righteous Rhemus shall Quirinus reign, Old faith, and Vesta, shall return again; With many a solid hinge, and brazen bar, Shall Janus close the horrid gates of war. 394. Within the fane dire fury.] As the ancients enjoyed no small privilege above us, in knowing the persons hinted at in several of their authors; so they received a great advantage, in seeing often the pictures and images that are frequently described in many of their poets. When Phidias had carved out his Jupiter, and the spectators stood astonished at so awful and majestic a figure, he surprized them more by telling them it was a copy: and to make his words true, shew'd them the original in that magnificent description of Jupiter, towards the latter end of the first Iliad: the comparing both together, probably discovered secret graces in each of them, and gave new beauty to their performances. Thus in Virgil's first Æneid where we see the representation of rage bound up, and chain'd in the temple of Janus: ? Furor impius in his Saeva sedens super arma, &amp; centum vinctus anenis Post tergum nodis, fremit horridus ore cruento: tho' we are much pleas'd with so wonderful a description, how must the pleasure double on those who could compare the poet and the statuary together; and see which had put most horror and distraction in his figure. But we, who live in these lower ages of the world, are such entire strangers to this kind of diversion, that we often mistake the description of a picture for an allegory, and don't so much as know when it is hinted at. Addison.Within the fane dire fury shall be bound, With a huge heap of shatter'd arms around; Wrapt in an hundred chains, beneath the load The fiend shall roar, and grind his teeth in blood. The thund'rer said; and down th'aërial way Sent with his high commands the son of May; That Carthage may throw wide her friendly tow'rs, And grant her guests the freedom of her shores: Lest Dido, blind to fate, and Jove's decree, Should shut her ports, and drive them to the sea. Swift on the steerage of his wings he flies, And shoots the vast expansion of the skies. Arriv'd, th'almighty's orders he performs, Charm'd by the god, no more the nation storms With jealous rage; in chief the queen inclin'd To peace, and mild benevolence of mind. All night involv'd in cares Æneas lay, But rose impatient at the dawn of day, To view the coast, the country to explore, And learn if men, or beasts, possest the shore, (For wide around the gloomy waste extends) And bear the tidings to his anxious friends: Beneath a shelving rock his fleet dispos'd, With waving woods and awful shades inclos'd, Two glitt'ring spears he shook with martial pride, And forth he march'd; Achates at his side. 420. As thro' the wilds the chief.] This is a most entertaining and delightful scene. A great prince thrown by a tempest upon a strange coast, doubtful of its inhabitants, nay doubtful whether it has any Inhabitants or no, is wandering in a wood; meets a person whom he knows not, but who appears to be a beautiful virgin. (He supposes her a nymph or a goddess) in that lovely romantic dress.) Namque humeris She tells him a most surprizing story relating to the place in which she finds him, gives him advice and comfort; afterwards appears to be indeed a goddess, and not only so, but his own mother, and then leaves him in suspence and anxiety. The solitude of the recess, the unexpectedness of the meeting, the surprizing adventure, all conspire to fill the soul with ideas of pleasing melancholy, and impatient expectation of the event. Trapp.As thro' the wilds the chief his course pursu'd, He meets his goddess-mother in the wood; In show, an huntress she appear'd, array'd In arms and habit like a spartan maid; Or swift Harpalyce of Thrace, whose speed Out-flew the wings of winds, and tir'd the rapid steed. 426. Bare was her knee] This attitude is very graceful: Virgil had in his eye a passage of Homer where he makes Minerva appear to Ulysses, but he has undoubtedly here excelled the Greek poet.Bare was her knee; and with an easy pride Her polish'd bow hung graceful at her side. Close, in a knot, her flowing robes she drew; Loose to the winds her wanton tresses flew, Ho! gentle youths, she cry'd, have you beheld One of my sisters wand'ring o'er the field, Girt with a speckled lynx's vary'd hide, A painted quiver rattling at her side? Or have you seen her with an eager pace Urge with full cries the foaming boar in chace? None of your charming sisterhood (he said) Have we beheld, or heard, oh! beauteous maid. Your name, oh! nymph, or oh! fair goddess, say? A goddess, sure, or sister of the day, You draw your birth from some immortal line, Your looks are heav'nly, and your voice divine. Tell me, on what new climate are we thrown? Alike the natives and the lands unknown; By the wild waves, and swelling surges tost, We wander strangers on a foreign coast. Then will we still invoke your sacred name, And with fat victims shall your altars flame. No goddess' awful name, she said, I bear; For know, the Tyrian maids, by custom, here, The purple buskin, and a quiver wear. Your eyes behold Agenor's walls aspire; The Punick realms; a colony from Tyre. See! wide around, waste Libya's bounds appear, Whose swarthy sons are terrible in war. From her fierce brother's vengeance, o'er the main, From Tyre, fled Dido, and enjoys the reign: The tale is intricate, perplex'd, and long; Hear then, in short, the story of her wrong. Sichæus was her lord, beyond the rest Of the Phœnician race, with riches blest; Much lov'd by Dido, whom her father led Pure, and a virgin, to his nuptial bed. Her brother, fierce Pygmalion, fill'd the throne Of Tyre, in vice unrivall'd and alone. Ev'n at the sacred altar in a strife, By stealth, the tyrant shed his brother's life; Blind with the charms of gold, his faulchion drove, Stern, and regardless of his sister's love. Then, with fond hopes, deceiv'd her for a time, And forg'd pretences to conceal the crime. But her unbury'd lord, before her sight, Rose in a frightful vision of the night: Around her bed he stalks; grim! ghastly! pale! And, staring wide, unfolds the horrid tale Of the dire altars, dash'd with blood around; Then bares his breast, and points to every wound; Warns her to fly the land without delay; And, to support her thro' the tedious way, Shews where, in massy piles, his bury'd treasure lay. Rous'd, and alarm'd, the wife her flight intends, Obeys the summons, and convenes her friends: They meet, they join, and in her cause engage, All, who detest, or dread the tyrant's rage. Some ships, already rigg'd, they seiz'd, and stow'd Their sides with gold; then launch'd into the flood. They sail; the bold exploit a woman guides: Pygmalion's wealth is wafted o'er the tides. They came, where now you see new Carthage rise, And yon' proud citadel invade the skies. The wand'ring exiles bought a space of ground Which one bull-hide inclos'd and compass'd round; Hence Byrsa nam'd: but now, ye strangers, say, Who? whence you are? and whither lies your way? Deep, from his soul, he draws a length of sighs, And, with a mournful accent, thus replies. Shou'd I, o goddess, from their source relate, Or you attend the annals of our fate, The golden sun would sink, and ev'ning close, Before my tongue could tell you half our woes. By Grecian foes expell'd, from Troy we came, From ancient Troy (if e'er you heard the name) Thro' various seas; when lo! a tempest roars, And raging drives us on the Lybian shores. 504. The good Æneas am I] Modern critics may perhaps be disgusted at Æneas's praising himself: but the antients entertained different notions concerning self-commendation. Homer's Ulysses (as Mr. Spence observes) calls himself the wisest of the Grecians, as his Achilles does not scruple to represent himself the best and most valiant of them; and that too in a council of all the princes: Virgil has given us his approbation of both the one and the other, in making Æneas talk frequently of his own piety and valour. Socrates in Plato, is always brought in to his advantage; he himself quotes the oracle, which pronounced him to be the wisest of men. Xenophon represents Cyrus, upon his death-bed, as taking notice of the greatest beauty of his own character, his humanity; in a piece which every one knows was designed for the character of a perfect prince. Caesar and the great Jewish writer of his own life frequently commend themselves: the greatest critic, as well as the greatest among the Romans, who so often reckons modesty among the things which are most necessary toward rendering a man great in his profession; how open and frequent is he in praising himself, and setting his own merit in a true light? But what puts this beyond dispute (and shews at the same time. That a just commendation of one's self may be very consistent with the greatest modesty) it is to be found in the sacred writings, in which Moses says of himself, that he was the meekest man upon earth. Essay on Pope's Odyssey, Part i. 52.The good Æneas am I call'd; my fame, And brave exploits, have reach'd the starry frame: From Grecian flames I bear my rescu'd gods, Safe in my vessels, o'er the stormy floods. In search of antient Italy I rove, And draw my lineage from all-mighty Jove. A goddess-mother and the fates, my guides, With twenty ships I plough'd the Phrygian tides, Scarce sev'n of all my fleet are left behind, Rent by the waves, and shatter'd by the wind. My self, from Europe and from Asia cast, A helpless stranger, rove the Libyan waste. No more could Venus hear her son bewail His various woes, but interrupts his tale. Whoe'er you are, arriv'd in these abodes, No wretch I deem abandon'd by the gods; Hence then, with haste, to yon' proud palace bend Your course, and on the gracious queen attend. Your friends are safe, the winds are chang'd again, Or all my skill in augury is vain! See those twelve swans, a flock triumphant, fly, Whom lately, shooting from th'etherial sky, Th'imperial bird of Jove dispers'd around, Some hov'ring o'er, some settling on the ground. As these returning clap their sounding wings, Ride round the skies, and sport in airy rings; So have your friends and ships possest the strand, Or with full-bellying sails approach the land. Haste to the palace then, without delay, And, as this path directs, pursue your way. 535. She said and turning round,] As Phidias is said to have conceived his sublime idea of majesty from Homer's description of Jupiter, why may we not imagine that Raphael Urbin borrowed his idea of that grace, for which he is so famous, from Virgil's Venus? Mr. Addison has observed that our poet is never better pleased than when he is describing what is beautiful; and I think we may apply to his muse, that most elegant and polite compliment of Tibullus to his Mistress, Illam quidquid agit, quoquo vestigia vertit, Componit furtim, subsequiturque decor. Titull. iv. 11.She said, and turning round, her neck she show'd, That with celestial charms divinely glow'd. Her waving locks immortal odours shed, And breath'd ambrosial scents around her head. Her sweeping robe trail'd pompous as she trod, And her majestick port confess'd the god. Soon as he knows her thro' the coy disguise, He thus pursues his mother as she flies. Must never, never more our hands be join'd? Are you, like heaven, grown cruel and unkind? Why must those borrow'd shapes delude your son? And why, ah! why those accents not your own? He said; then sought the town; but Venus shrowds And wraps their persons in a veil of clouds; That none may interpose, to cause delay, Nor fondly curious ask them of their way. Thro' air sublime the queen of love retreats To Paphos' stately tow'rs, and blissful seats; Where to her name an hundred altars rise; And gums, and flow'ry wreaths, perfume the skies. Now o'er the lofty hill they bend their way, Whence all the rising town in prospect lay, And tow'rs and temples; for the mountain's brow Hung bending o'er, and shaded all below. Where late the cottage stood, with glad surprize The prince beholds the stately palace rise; On the pav'd streets, and gates, looks wond'ring down, And all the crowd and tumult of the town. The Tyrians ply their work; with many a groan 563. These roll,] Observe the buildings which Virgil hath selected, to make a particular mention of; 1. A temple for public worship. 2. A senate house to dispense justice. 3. Walls and a citadel for defence. 4. Houses of particular inhabitants. 5. A theatre for public spectacles Pausanias adds, to compleat the perfection of a great city, an academy for youth, and a reservoir of Water for the use of the public. Catrou.These roll, or heave some huge unweildy stone; Those bid the lofty citadel ascend; Some in vast length th'embattled walls extend; Others for future dwellings choose the ground, Mark out the spot, and draw the furrow round. Some, useful laws propose, and some the choice Of sacred senates, and elect by voice. These sink a spacious mole beneath the sea, Those a huge theatre's foundation lay; Hew massy columns from the mountain's side, Of future scenes an ornamental pride. 574. This simile is borrowed from one of Homer's on the same subject: and Scaliger, according to his usual method, very much prefers it to that of the Greek poet, and in particular extols the harmony and sweetness of the versification above that of Homer; against which censure (says Mr. Pope) we need only appeal to the ears of the reader. ???? ????? ???? ????????? ???????, ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ???? ??????????, ???????? ?? ???????? ??? ??????? ??????????? ?? ??? ?? ???? ???? ??????????, ?? ?? ?? ????. But Scaliger was unlucky in his choice of this particular comparison; there is a very fine one in the sixth Æneid, v 707. that better agrees with Homer's: and nothing is more evident, than that the design of these two is very different. Homer intended to describe the multitude of Greeks pouring out of the ships; Virgil the diligence and labour of the builders of Carthage. And Macrobius, who observes this difference Sat. l. v. c. 11. should also have found that therefore the similes ought not to be compared together. The beauty of Homer's is not inferiour to Virgil's, if we consider with what exactness it answers to its end. Thus far Mr. Pope. I will take this opportunity of assuring the reader, that in these notes, I shall be very cautious of lessening the character of Homer and advancing Virgil's, by any invidious comparisons (as some of Virgil's translators and commentators have done) for no other reason but because I am at present engaged in publishing the latter of these writers.Thus to their toils, in early summer, run The clust'ring bees, and labor in the sun; Led forth, in colonies, their buzzing race, Or work the liquid sweets, and thicken to a mass. The busy nation flies from flow'r to flow'r, And hoards, in curious cells, the golden store; A chosen troop before the gate attends, To take the burdens, and relieve their friends; Warm at the fragrant work, in bands, they drive The drone, a lazy robber, from the hive. The prince surveys the lofty towr's, and cries, 585. Blest, blest are you, &amp;c.] There is something very natural and affecting in this exclamation of Æneas: it likewise artfully fixes our thoughts on the grand subject of this poem, viz. The founding a colony.Blest, blest are you, whose walls already rise: Then strange, to tell, he mingled with the crowds, And past, unseen, involv'd in mantling clouds. Amid the town, a stately grove display'd A cooling shelter, and delightful shade. Here, tost by winds and waves, the Tyrians found A courser's head within the sacred ground; An omen sent by Juno, to declare A fruitful soil, and race renoun'd in war. A temple here Sidonian Dido rais'd To heav'n's dread empress, that with riches blaz'd; Unnumber'd gifts adorn'd the costly shrine, By her own presence hallow'd and divine. 598. Brass were the steps &amp;c.] This was not uncommon in the temples of the ancients. The doors to the Rotonda at Rome are covered with brass, and turn on brass-hinges. The portico was covered with the same formerly; and it rested on brass beams, fasten'd on with brass nails or pins of the same metal. There is one of these very nails, which I have seen in the great duke's gallery so large, that it weighs above forty seven pounds. Spence.Brass were the steps, the beams with brass were strong, The lofty doors, on brazen hinges, rung. Here, a strange scene before his eyes appears, To raise his courage, and dispel his fears; Here first, he hopes his fortunes to redress: And finds a glimmering prospect of success. While for the queen he waited, and amaz'd, O'er the proud shrine and pompous temple gaz'd; While he the town admires, and wond'ring stands At the rich labours of the artist's hands; 608. Amid the story'd walls,] The Trojan war was with great propriety represented in a temple dedicated to Juno; for that goddess excited the war, and was the cause of the destruction of the City. 'Tis observable that Vitruvius, in his architecture, mentions the Trojan war as one of the finest subjects painting could afford, for the ornament of a palace or magnificent building. Catrou. Virgil in a few verses selects the most striking and beautiful pictures of the Iliad; he has shewn his art in selecting those that are most proper for painting, as well as poetic description.Amid the story'd walls, he saw appear, In speaking paint, the tedious Trojan war; The war, that fame had blaz'd the world around, And every battle fought on Phrygian ground. There Priam stood, and Agamemnon here, And Peleus' wrathful son, to both severe. Struck with the view, oh! friend, the heroe cries, (Tears, as he spoke, came starting from his eyes) Lo! the wide world our miseries employ; What realm abounds not with the woes of Troy? See! where the venerable Priam stands! See virtue honour'd in the Libyan sands! For Troy, the generous tears of Carthage flow; And Tyrian breasts are touch'd with human woe. Now banish fear, for since the Trojan name Is known, we find our safety in our fame. Thus while his soul the moving picture fed, A show'r of tears the groaning heroe shed. For here, the fainting Greeks in flight he view'd; And there, the Trojans to their walls pursu'd 628. By plum'd Achilles with his dreadful spear,] The art of Virgil is extremely delicate in this passage; every epithet he uses is picturesque; and strongly descriptive of the manner in which each particular person was painted; Virgil's description of itself would be a sufficient direction for any painter to work after. Let us particularly review each expression. Cristatus Achilles. Niveis velis. Tydides cruentus. Pulvis inscribitur hasta. Crinibus passis.—Diva solo fixos oculos aversa tenebat. Tendentemque manus Priamum. Nigri Memnonis arma. Lunatis peltis. Exertae mammae. Aurea cingula. As to the moving picture of poor Troilus, give me leave to borrow the words of a critic of exquisite taste and judgment. “This is certainly as fine a piece as any drawn by the great hand of Virgil:” ? Amissis Troilus armis Infelix puer, atque impar congressus Achilli, Fertur equis, curruque haeret resupinus inani, Lora tenens tamen; huic cervique comaeque trahuntur Per terram, et versâ pulvis inscribitur hastâ. How beautiful does this look in the poem and in the picture? Yes, the painter and the poet have one and the same art; or rather one and the same power of creating. Aut utramque putabis esse pictam: Aut utramque putabis esse veram. Spence on Pope's Odyssey, Part ii. page 195.By plum'd Achilles, with his dreadful spear, Whirl'd on his kindling chariot thro' the war. Not far from thence, proud Rhaesus' tents he knows By their white veils, that match'd the winter snows, Betray'd and stretch'd amidst his slaughter'd train, And, while he slept, by fierce Tydides slain; Who drove his coursers from the scene of blood, E'er the fierce steeds had tasted Trojan food Or drank divine Scamander's fatal flood. There Troilus flies disarm'd (unhappy boy!) From stern Achilles, round the fields of Troy; Unequal he! to such an arm in war! Supine, and trailing from his empty car, Still, tho' in death, he grasps the flowing reins, His startled coursers whirl him o'er the plains; The spear, inverted, streaks the dust around; His snowy neck and tresses sweep the ground. Mean time a pensive supplicating train Of Trojan Matrons, to Minerva's fane In sad procession with a robe repair, Beat their white breasts, and rend their golden hair. Unmov'd with pray'rs, disdainfully she frown'd, And fix'd her eyes, relentless, on the ground. Achilles here, his vengeance to enjoy, Thrice drag'd brave Hector round the walls of Troy: Then to the mournful sire, the victor sold The breathless body of his son, for gold. His groans now deepen'd, and new tears he shed, To see the spoils, and chariot of the dead, And Priam both his trembling hands extend, And, gash'd with wounds, his dear disfigur'd friend. Mix'd with the Grecian peers, and hostile train, Himself he view'd, conspicuous in the plain: And swarthy Memnon, glorious to behold, His eastern hosts, and arms that flame with gold. All furious led Penthesilea there, With moony shields, her Amazons to war; Around her breast her golden belt she threw; Then thro' the thick-embattled squadrons flew; Amidst the thousands stood the dire alarms, And the fierce maid engag'd the men in arms. Thus, while the Trojan heroe stood amaz'd, 670. And fix'd with wonder] Monsieur Segrais observes, that an objection has been made to this incident of Æneas's meeting with the pictures of the Trojan war. How could the Trojan history (say some) be in so short a time so particularly known to the Carthaginians? And if it were, had they no exploits of themselves or ancestors, to adorn their temples with, but were they forced to fetch them from Greece and Troy? The answer is in substance as follows: Seven years had passed since the conclusion of that war, according to Virgil's account: nothing in the world had been ever so renowned; the gods and religion of these nations were the same: there might be, nay Virgil hints that there were, other decorations of the temple, besides this: tho' none of them was so likely to detain the eye of Æneas.And, fixt in wonder, on the picture gaz'd, 671. Fair Dido] A modern poet would have minutely and particularly described, the shape, the eyes, the hair, the cheeks, &amp;c. of this beautiful queen. But Virgil by a single epithet (pulcherrima Dido) like a masterly painter with one stroke of his pencil, gives one a fuller idea of her beauty, than all the florid expressions which Tasso has bestowed on his Armida. See the sixteenth book of Godfrey of Bulloign, as it is admirably translated by Mr. Fairfax: particularly page 356 of the last edition, printed correctly with some judicious emendations in the year 1749.With all her guards, fair Dido, from below, Ascends the dome, majestically slow. 673. As on Eurota's banks] The heighth of Diana's stature is frequently marked out by the poets; and that generally by comparing her with her nymphs: I wish we could now enjoy the sight of that famous picture of this goddess, by Apelles, in which this was so finely expressed. Pliny says that Apelles formed his idea of it from a celebrated passage in Homer; (Odyssey 108) and that he even surpassed his original. Virgil has imitated the very same description in his Æneid. What a pleasure might it have been to have compared the copies of two such scholars as Apelles and Virgil, with the work of so great a master as Homer? at least how much more pleasing, than to fall a disputing (as several of the critics have done) whether Homer or Virgil have given the finest strokes on this occasion? This Diana both in the picture, and in the descriptions was the Diana Venatrix; tho' she was not represented either by Virgil, or Apelles, or Homer, as hunting with her nymphs; but as employed with them in that sort of dances, which of old were regarded as very solemn acts of devotion. Polymetis, Dialogue viii. p. 102. A reader, that is curious in such kind of criticisms, may find in the ninth book of Gellius's Noctes Atticæ, that Valerius Probus was of opinion that Virgil had failed more in this imitation of Homer, than he had in any other. Scaliger affirms quite the contrary with his usual dogmatical bitterness. See the fifth book of his Poetics.As on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' heads, A thousand beauteous nymphs Diana leads, While round their quiver'd queen the quires advance, She tow'rs majestic, as she leads the dance; She moves in pomp superior to the rest, And secret transports touch Latona's breast. So pass'd the graceful queen amidst her train, To speed their labours and her future reign. Then with her guards surrounded, in the gate, 682. Beneath,] The ancient architects called the dome or cupola of a building, testudo.Beneath the spacious dome, sublime she sate. She shares their labours, or by lots she draws; And to the crowd administers the laws. When lo! Æneas brave Cloanthus spies, Antheus, and great Sergestus, with surprize, Approach the throne, attended by a throng Of Trojan friends, that pour'd in tides along; Whom the wild whistling winds and tempests bore, And widely scatter'd on a distant shore. Lost in his hopes and fears, amaz'd he stands, And with Achates longs to join their hands: But doubtful of th'event, he first attends, Wrapt in the cloud, the fortune of his friends; Anxious, and eager till he knew their state, And where their vessels lay, and what their fate. With cries, the royal favour to implore, They came, a train selected, from the shore: Then, leave obtain'd, Ilioneus begun, And, with their common suit, addrest the throne. Oh! queen, indulg'd by Jove, these lofty tow'rs And this proud town to raise on Libyan shores, With high commands, a savage race to awe, And to the barb'rous natives give the law, We wretched Trojans, an abandon'd race, Tost round the seas, implore your royal grace; Oh! check your subjects, and their rage reclaim, Ere their wild fury wrap our fleet in flame. Oh! save a pious race; regard our cry; And view our anguish with a melting eye. We come not, mighty queen, an hostile band, With sword and fire, and, ravaging the land, To bear your spoils triumphant to the shore: No—to such thoughts the vanquish'd durst not soar. Once by Oenotrians till'd, there lies a place, 'Twas call'd Hesperia by the Grecian race, (For martial deeds and fruits, renown'd by fame) But since Italia, from the leader's name; To that blest shore we steer'd our destin'd way, When sudden, dire Orion rous'd the sea; All charg'd with tempests rose the baleful star, And on our navy pour'd his wat'ry war; With sweeping whirlwinds cast our vessels wide, Dash'd on rough rocks, or driving with the tide: The few sad relicks of our navy bore Their course to this unhospitable shore. What are the customs of this barbarous place? What more than savage this inhuman race? In arms they rise, and drive us from the strand, From the last verge, and limits of the land. Know, if divine and human laws you slight, The gods, the gods will all our wrongs requite; Vengeance is theirs; and their's to guard the right. Æneas was our king, of high renown; Great, good, and brave; and war was all his own. If still he lives, and breathes this vital air, Nor we, his friends and subjects, shall despair; Nor you, great queen, repent, that you employ Your kind compassion in the cause of Troy. Besides, on high the Trojan ensigns soar, And Trojan cities grace Sicilia's shore; Where great Acestes, of the Dardan strain, Deriv'd from antient Teucer, holds his reign. Permit us, from your woods, new planks and oars To fell, and bring our vessels on your shores; That, if our prince and friends return again, With joy, for Latium, we may plow the main. But if those hopes are vanish'd quite away, If lost, and swallow'd in the Libyan sea, You lie, great guardian of the Trojan state, And young Iülus shares his father's fate; Oh! let us seek Sicilia's shores again, And fly from hence to good Acestes' reign. 754. He spoke] This harangue of Ilioneus is one of the finest pieces of eloquence in the whole Æneid: it accordingly produced the desired effects in its hearers. Virgil, who constantly keeps up to the characters of each person he introduces in his poem, always employs this Ilioneus, being a fine speaker, in embassies. Mr. Segrais informs us, that he omitted translating the words Nec spes jam restat Iüli, ver. 560. because it did not appear to him that Dido was obliged to know who this Iülus was. Perhaps this may be one of those little oversights which Virgil would have corrected, had he lived to make this poem as perfect as the Georgics.He spoke; a loud assent ran murmuring thro' the train. Thus then, in short, the gracious queen replies, While on the ground she fixt her modest eyes: Trojans, be bold; against my will, my fate, A throne unsettled, and an infant state, Bid me defend my realms with all my pow'rs, And guard with these severities my shores. Lives there a stranger to the Trojan name, Their valour, arms, and chiefs of mighty fame? We know the war that set the world on fire; Nor are so void of sense the sons of Tyre; For here his beams indulgent Phœbus sheds, And rolls his flaming chariot o'er our heads. Seek you, my friends, the blest Saturnian plains, Or fair Trinacria, where Acestes reigns? With aids supply'd, and furnish'd from my stores, Safe will I send you from the Libyan shores. Or would you stay to raise this growing town? Fix here your seat; and Carthage is your own. Haste, draw your ships to shore; to me the same, Your Troy and Tyre shall differ but in name. And oh! that great Æneas had been tost, By the same storm, on the same friendly coast! But I will send, my borders to explore, And trace the windings of the mazy shore. Perchance, already thrown on these abodes, He roams the towns, or wanders thro' the woods. Rais'd in their hopes the friend and heroe stood; And long'd to break, transported, from the cloud. Oh! goddess-born! cry'd brave Achates, say, What are your thoughts, and why this long delay? All safe you see; your friends and fleet restor'd: One (whom we saw) the whirling gulf devour'd. Lo! with the rest your mother's words agree, All but Orontes 'scap'd the raging sea. Swift as he spoke, the vapours break away, Dissolve in æther, and refine to day. 791. Radiant in open view Æneas stood] This discovery is extremely beautiful. It equally surprizes and delights the reader. I shall scarce ever forget the pleasure I felt upon first reading it. One may affirm that Aristotle, who appears so fond of surprizes and discoveries in his Poetics, would have been charmed with it.Radiant, in open view, Æneas stood, In form and looks, majestic as a god. Flush'd with the bloom of youth, his features shine, His hair in ringlets waves with grace divine. The queen of love the glance divine supplies, And breathes immortal spirit in his eyes. 797. Like Parian marble] This comparison contains a beauty which we are by no means so sensible of as a Roman reader might be; for the ancient statues both of marble and ivory were polished to such an extreme degree, that there was even something luminous and shining on their surfaces, and which dazzled the eyes of their beholders. The Vultus nimium libricus aspici, of Horace, might probably allude to this appearance in statues. Spence.Like Parian marble, beauteous to behold, Or silver's milder gleam in burnish'd gold, Or polish'd iv'ry, shone the godlike man: All stood surpriz'd; and thus the prince began. Æneas, whom you seek, you here survey; Escap'd the tempest of the Libyan sea, O Dido, gracious queen, who make alone The woes, and cause, of wretched Troy your own; And shelter in your walls, with pious care, Her sons, the relicks of the Grecian war; Who all the forms of misery have bore, Storms on the sea, and dangers on the shore; Nor we, nor all the Dardan nation, hurl'd Wide o'er the globe, and scatter'd round the world, But the good gods, with blessings, shall repay Your bounteous deeds, the gods and only they; (If pious acts, if justice they regard;) And your clear conscience stands its own reward. How blest this age that has such virtue seen? How blest the parents of so great a queen? While to the sea the rivers roll, and shades With awful pomp surround the mountain heads; While æther shines, with golden planets grac'd, So long your honour, name, and praise shall last: Whatever realm my fortune has assign'd, Still will I bear your image in my mind. This said, the pious chief of Troy extends His hands around, and hails his joyful friends: His left Sergestus grasp'd with vast delight, To great Ilioneus he gave the right. Cloanthus, Gyas, and the Dardan train, All, in their turns, embrac'd the prince again. 829. Dido gaz'd him o'er] Here was the beginning of that violent passion Dido afterwards felt for ÆneasCharm'd with his presence, Dido gaz'd him o'er, Admir'd his fortune much, his person more. What fate, O goddess-born, she said, has tost So brave a heroe on this barbarous coast? Are you Æneas, who in Ida's grove Sprung from Anchises and the queen of love 835. And now I call to mind] It is a very artful stroke in the poet to make Dido know something of Æneas's family and actions, which renders his good reception from a stranger more natural; and inclined her to a favourable opinion of him at first sight. The sentiment with which she concludes her speech, non ignara mali, &amp;c. is founded on the truest knowledge of human nature; for the passion of pity is ever most strongly felt by those who have been unfortunate.By Simois' streams? and now I call to mind, When Teucer left his native shores behind; The banisht prince to Sidon came, to gain Great Belus' aid, to fix him in his reign; Then the rich Cyprian isle, my warlike sire Subdu'd, and ravag'd wide with sword and fire. From him I learnt the Grecian kings of fame, The fall of Ilion, and your glorious name: He on your valour, tho' a foe, with joy Would dwell, and proudly trace his birth from Troy. Come to my palace then, my royal guest, And, with your friends, indulge the genial feast. My wand'rings and my fate resembling yours, At length I settled on these Libyan shores; And, touch'd with miseries myself have known, I view, with pity, woes so like my own. 851. She spoke] Bossu has many excellent remarks on what the critics call the intrigue of the epic poem, or in other words, the obstacles that are flung in the hero's way to retard him from prosecuting his main design. The conduct of Virgil, says he, in the intrigues he forms, has the simplicity of Homer in it. The tempests are made use of in the first part of the Æneid just as in the Odyssey. In this very part of the Æneid, Virgil suits himself to the humour and character of his hero, just as Homer suits himself to the humour of Achilles. For as he is passionate, warm, and easily provoked, Agamemnon provokes him and urges him by the most sensible affronts. Æneas was of a soft and mild disposition; therefore with the utmost propriety the poet makes use of good and benevolent offices, kind treats and entertainments, and the most melting, and most endearing passions, to engage him to stay at Carthage.She spoke, then leads him to her proud abodes, Ordains a feast, and offerings to the gods. Twice fifty bleating lambs and ewes she sends, And twice ten brawny oxen to his friends: 855. A hundred boars] A feast suited to the simplicity of ancient times.A hundred bristly boars, and monstrous swine; With Bacchus' gifts, a store of generous wine. The inner rooms in regal pomp display'd, The splendid feasts in ample halls are made; Where, labour'd o'er with art, rich carpets lie, That glow refulgent with the purple dye. The boards are pil'd with plate of curious mould; And their forefathers' deeds, in times of old, Blaz'd round the bowls, and charg'd the rising gold. 864. Eager love] Tenderness being the characteristic of Æneas, the poet takes all opportunities of displaying it.No more the prince his eager love supprest, All the fond parent struggled in his breast. 866. He sends Achates] The character of Achates suggests to us an observation we may often make, on the intimacies of great men, who frequently chuse their companions, rather for the qualities of the heart than those of the head; and prefer fidelity in an easy, inoffensive, complying temper, to those endowments which make a much greater figure among mankind. I do not remember that Achates, who is represented as the first favourite, either gives his advice, or strikes a blow, thro' the whole Æneid. Spectator, No. 385.He sends Achates to inform his son, And guide the young Ascanius to the town; (On his Ascanius turn his fear and joy, The father's cares are center'd in the boy;) To bring rich presents to the queen of Tyre, And relicks, rescu'd from the Trojan fire. A mantle wrought with saffron foliage round; And a stiff robe with golden figures crown'd; 874. Fair Helen's dress] Our hero's presents to Dido are all chosen with great elegance and propriety. And there is even something of gallantry in sending her a robe formerly worn by the beautiful Helen, and the sceptre of Ilione.Fair Helen's dress, when, fir'd with lawless joy, She left her native walls to ruin Troy, (Her mother's present in the bridal hour;) With gold a shining sceptre studded o'er, That wont Ilione's fair hand to grace, The eldest nymph of Priam's beauteous race; Her necklace, strung with pearls; her crown, that glows Instarr'd with gems and gold in double rows. To bring the splendid gifts, without delay, Swift to the fleet, Achates bends his way. 884. But beauteous Venus] That the chief divinity who guides the holy, wise, and brave Æneas, should be Venus, is somewhat unlucky. She well might tutor Paris, and favour all the Trojans, who had their seraglio's even then; but it required great discretion to make her act in the Æneid with any propriety. And after all, however we may be charm'd with the delicacy of her appearance, and the pomp of the description, I don't know but she is introduc'd as a mere person, divine indeed, and of great power; but without any regard to her character and inclinations. It was hard to make her appear in a virtuous cause, or direct the enterprizes of the pious hero, in any other capacity than his traditional parent; except she had condescended to accompany him when he went a hunting, and conducted him into the cave with Dido. Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer, p. 217.But beauteous Venus in her breast design'd New wiles, and plann'd new counsels in her mind, That winged Cupid to the court should come Like sweet Ascanius, in Ascanius' room; With the rich gifts the Tyrian queen inspire, And kindle in her veins the raging fire. Her dread of Juno's arts, who guards the place, Her just suspicions of the treach'rous race, Break, each revolving night, her golden rest: And thus the suppliant queen the god addrest. Oh son! my strength! supreme in heav'n above! Whose arrows triumph o'er the bolts of Jove: To thee I fly, thy succour to implore, Court thy protection, and thy pow'r adore. To tell how Juno's restless rage has tost Your brother round the seas, and ev'ry coast, Is but to mention what too well you know, Who sigh'd my sighs, and wept a mother's woe. Him, in her town, the Tyrian queen detains, With soft seducements, from the Latian plains. But much I fear that hospitable place, Where Juno reigns the guardian of the race: And lest this fair occasion she improve, Know, I design to fire the queen with love; A love, beyond the cure of pow'rs divine; A love as strong, and violent as mine. But how the proud Phœnician to surprize With such a passion, hear what I advise. The royal youth, Ascanius, from the port, Hastes, by his father's summons, to the court; With costly presents charg'd, he takes his way, Sav'd from the Trojan flames, and stormy sea; But to prevent suspicion, will I steep His temples in the dews of balmy sleep, Then to Cythera's sacred seats remove, Or softly lay him in th'Idalian grove. This one revolving night, thyself a boy, Wear thou the features of the youth of Troy; And when the queen, transported with thy charms, Amidst the feast, shall strain thee in her arms, The gentle poison by degrees inspire Thro' all her breast; then fan the rising fire, And kindle all her soul. The mother said, With joy the god her soft commands obey'd. Aside his quiver, and his wings he flung, And, like the boy Iülus, tript along. Mean time the goddess on Ascanius throws A balmy slumber and a sweet repose; Lull'd in her lap to rest, the queen of love Convey'd him to the high Idalian grove. 934. Wrapt in a flow'ry bed] In the original, “Surrounded him with sweet marjoram;” which would not sound gracefully in English. Nothing, says Catrou, escapes the vast learning of Virgil: One may think at first sight that he uses sweet marjoram in this passage, indifferently for any other odoriferous herb. 'Tis no such thing. It is because the marjoram of Cyprus had a power to drive away scorpions, which were so much to be feared during sleep. Pliny confirms this—Amaracus in Cypro Scorpionibus adversatur.There on a flow'ry bed her charge she laid, And, breathing round him, rose the fragrant shade. Now Cupid, pleas'd his orders to obey, Brought the rich gifts; Achates led the way. He came, and found on costly carpets spread 939. The queen majestic,] In the arrangement of the guests Dido takes place of Æneas (se mediam locavit) for the middle was the most honourable place among the Africans. Sallust has expressly marked this; Ne medius ex tribus, says he, quod apud Numidas honori ducitur Jugurtha foret. Farther, the queen's couch was of gold, that of Æneas and the Trojans of purple only. Dido being a woman did not give the upper place to her guest. A good poet should observe even these trifling decorums. Catrou.The queen majestic midst her golden bed. The great Æneas and the Trojans lie On pompous couches stain'd with Tyrian dye: Soft towels for their hands th'attendants bring, And limpid water from the crystal spring. They wash; the menial train the tables spread; And heap in glitt'ring canisters the bread. To dress the feast, full fifty handmaids join, And burn rich incense to the pow'rs divine; A hundred boys and virgins stood around, The banquet marshall'd, and the goblet crown'd. To fill th'embroider'd beds the Tyrians come Rank behind rank; and crowd the regal room. The guests the gorgeous gifts and boy admire, His voice, and looks, that glow with youthful fire; The veil and foliage wond'ring they behold, And the rich robe that flam'd with figur'd gold: But chief the queen, the boy and presents move, The queen, already doom'd to fatal love. Insatiate in her joy, she sate amaz'd, Gaz'd on his face, and kindled as she gaz'd. First, his dissembled father he carest, Hung round his neck, and play'd upon his breast; Next to the queen's embraces he withdrew; She look'd, and sent her soul at ev'ry view: Then took him on her lap, devour'd his charms; Nor knew poor Dido, blind to future harms, How great a god she fondled in her arms. But he, now mindful of his mother, stole By slow degrees Sichaeus from her soul; Her soul, rekindling, in her husband's stead 970. The living for the dead,] Vivo amore (in the original,) that is no doubt with the love of a living man instead of a dead one as Sichaeus was; not amore vehementi, as some would have it. Praevertere, i. e. with respect to any design of Juno's. Trapp.Admits the prince; the living for the dead. Soon as the banquet paus'd; to raise their souls With sparkling wine they crown the massy bowls. Thro' the wide hall the rolling echo bounds, The palace rings, the vaulted dome resounds. The blazing torches, and the lamps display, From golden roofs, an artificial day. Now Dido crowns the bowl of state with wine, The bowl of Belus, and the regal line. Her hands aloft the shining goblet hold, Pond'rous with gems, and rough with sculptur'd gold When silence was proclaim'd, the royal fair Thus to the gods addrest her fervent pray'r. Almighty Jove! who plead'st the stranger's cause; Great guardian god of hospitable laws! Oh! grant this day to circle still with joy, Thro' late posterity, to Tyre and Troy. Be thou, O Bacchus! god of mirth, a guest; And thou, O Juno! grace the genial feast. And you, my lords of Tyre, your fears remove, And shew your guests benevolence and love. She said, and on the board, in open view, The first libation to the gods she threw: 993. Then sip'd the wine,] Virgil often describes the incidents in his poem in allusion to the Roman customs. The ladies of Rome never drank wine but at religious ceremonies, the laws of that city punished with death, those who drank it any other time. Thus Dido does not drink it here but as at a ceremony, and does no more than touch her lips with it. Catrou.Then sip'd the wine, and gave to Bitias' hand: He rose, obedient to the queen's command; At once the thirsty Trojan swill'd the whole, Sunk the full gold, and drain'd the foaming bowl. Then thro' the peers, with sparkling nectar crown'd, The goblet circles, and the health goes round. 999. With curling tresses grac'd,] I cannot but fancy some celebrated master complimented under the name of Iopas the philosophical musician at Dido's banquet; for methinks the epithet, Crinitus, is so wholly foreign to the purpose, that it perfectly points at some particular person; who perhaps (to pursue a wandering guess) was one of the Grecian performers then in Rome; for besides that they were the best musicians and philosophers, the termination of the name belongs to their language, and the epithet is the same (????????????;) that Homer gives to his countrymen in general. Thus far Mr. Addison: but Mr. Spence hath given a better interpretation to this passage. As the Romans must have been so familiarly acquainted with the dress of the Festal Apollo, his long robe which he always wore then, and his full-dressed hair; Virgil's applying the epithet Crinitus (the known epithet of Apollo) to Iopas on this occasion, might imply to them, that he was dressed out like the Festal Apollo; in a long magnificent robe, and with his hair all flowing down his back; this by the way, is a strong instance of the use of being acquainted with the ancient Roman Customs, and with the appearances their gods used to make, on such and such occasions, towards understanding their poets. Had the author of a piece published a few years ago, under a name that would make every body fond of reading it, been aware of this, methinks he never could have called Crinitus here, an epithet so wholly foreign to the purpose. Polymetis, page 193.With curling tresses grac'd, and rich attire, Iopas stands, and sweeps the golden lyre; 1011. The truths which antient Atlas taught,] An entertaining and sprightly Frenchman makes the following remark. The banquet which Alcinous gives to Ulysses in the Odyssey, is well contrived, very proper and gallant; nevertheless men only are present at it: The banquet which Dido gives to Æneas is not conducted with propriety: in the first, were sung the gallantries and adventures of the gods, and other matters agreeable and gay: in the last, were sung the course of the stars, the causes of eclipses, and other philosophical matters. Carry the banquet of Alcinous to the court of Carthage, and that of Dido to the island of the Pheäcians, and all will be in it's proper order. Melanges de Vigneul Marville, Tom iii. Dr. Trapp will furnish us with an answer to M Vigneul Marville's objection. “To put so much natural philosophy into a song, may seem strange to a mere modern. Yet how much more grand and noble is it than a silly story of Chloris and Phyllis; and such like frothy trifles, which are the subjects of songs in our times! By the way, how pretty would have been an opera or masquerade, to entertain Æneas and his friends, upon this occasion? What pity it is, the ancients were not so polite and judicious as we are!”The truths, which antient Atlas taught, he sings, And nature's secrets, on the sounding strings. Why Cynthia changes; why the sun retires, Shorn of his radiant beams, and genial fires; From what originals, and causes, came Mankind and beasts, the rain, and rising flame; Arcturus, dreadful with his stormy star; The wat'ry Hyads, and the northern car; Why suns in summer the slow night detain, And rush so swift in winter to the main. With shouts the Tyrians praise the song divine, And in the loud applause the Trojans join. The queen, in various talk, prolongs the hours, Drinks deep of love, and ev'ry word devours; This moment longs of Hector to enquire, The next of Priam, his unhappy sire; 1017. What arms adorn'd] 'Tis worth observing how natural and proper for a woman these questions of Dido are. Quibus armis! Quantus Achilles! Quales Diomedis equi! These are such strokes of nature as escape common readers, but are infinitely beautiful. Our Shakespear abounds in them beyond any other author whatever.What arms adorn'd Aurora's glorious son; How high, above his hosts, Achilles shone; How brave Tydides thunder'd on his car; How his fierce coursers swept the ranks of war. 1021. Nay, but at large, my godlike guest, relate,] The sudden change of persons from the poet to the queen; the natural sliding in of that immo age &amp;c. and stealing the inquit, into the second line, as it were out of the way, and in a place where we can scarce observe it; the passing from those scatter'd particular questions, to the general request in form and solemnity, preparatory to the noble narrative which follows upon it; the art of the poet being like that of musicians, who sport themselves with little warbling essays and flourishes while they are preparing to begin a grand and full concert; and lastly the concluding the book with that request, and so leaving the mind of the reader in the most earnest expectation: are all of them circumstances marvellously beautiful; and the more they are consider'd, the more beautiful they will appear. Trapp.Nay, but at large, my godlike guest, relate The Grecian wiles, she said, and Ilion's fate; How far your course around the globe extends, And what the woes and fortunes of your friends: For, since you wander'd every shore and sea, Have sev'n revolving summers roll'd away. The End of the First Book. THE SECOND BOOK. The destruction of an ancient, populous city, with all those scenes of devastation, sorrow, and misery that must attend it, is one of the most striking objects in the world. Virgil accordingly chose it, as the properest subject imaginable to move the passions of pity and terror, and surely he hath succeeded to his wish. One cannot but think, that he was particularly pleased with this subject, as it happened to be left untouched by Homer. Our poet however hath borrowed many fine hints and affecting circumstances from two tragedies of Euripides, the Troades, and the Hecuba. Virgil, in general, seemeth to have been a great reader and lover of the works of this noble tragedian. And indeed these two writers seem to have nearly resembled each other in their genius and manner: Both were remarkable for brevity, and an elegant simplicity of style, both were of a tender temper, and particularly skilled in moving the passions. I must not neglect to observe, that Virgil recited this second book to the emperor Augustus, in order to give his great patron a taste of the rest of his Æneid. The versification of this book is extremely beautiful, and it is in general the most correct piece of the whole poem. The ARGUMENT. Æneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse. He declares the sixt resolution he had taken not to survive the ruins of his country, and the various adventures he met with in the defence of it: at last, having been before advised by Hector's ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his houshold gods in another country. In order to this he carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his wife following him behind. When he comes to the place appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed for him. V. 1. All gaz'd,] An ingenious critic hath lately made some just observations on this second book: Let us conceive an objector to put the following query: “Supposing the author of the Æneis to have related, in the natural order, the destruction of Troy, would not the subject have been, to all intents and purposes, as much one, as it is, under its present form; in which that event is told, in the second book, by way of episode?” I answer, by no means. The reason is taken from the nature of the work, and from the state and expectations of the reader. 1. The nature of an epic or narrative poem is this, that it lays the author under an obligation of shewing any event, which he formally undertakes in his own person, at full length, and with all its material circumstances. Every figure must be drawn in full proportion, and exhibited in strong, glowing colours. Now had the subject of the second book of the Æneis been related, in this extent, it must not only have taken up one, but many books. By this faithful and animated drawing, and from the time it must necessarily have to play upon the imagination, the event would have grown into such importance, that the remainder could only have passed for a kind of appendix to it. 2. The same conclusion is drawn from considering the state of the reader. For, hurried away by an instinctive impatience, he pursues the proposed event with eagerness and rapidity. So circumstantial a detail, as was supposed, of an intermediate action not necessarily connected with it, breaks the course of his expectations, and throws back the point of view to an immoderate distance. In the mean time the action, thus interposed and presented to his thoughts, acquires by degrees, and at length ingrosses his whole attention. It becomes the important theme of the piece; or, at least, what follows sets out with the disadvantage of appearing to him, as a new and distinct subject. But now being related by way of episode, that is, as a succinct, summary narration, not made by the poet himself, but coming from the mouth of a person, necessarily ingaged in the progress of the action, it serves for a short time to interrupt, and, by that interruption to sharpen the eager expectation of the reader. It holds the attention, for a while from the point of view; yet not long enough to destroy that impatient curiosity, which looks forward to it. And thus it contributes to the same end, as a piece of miniature, properly introduced into a large picture. It amuses the eye with something relative to the painter's design, yet not so, as to withhold its principal observation from falling on the greater subject. The parallel will not hold very exactly, because the painter is, of necessity, confined to the same instant of time; but it may serve for an illustration of my meaning. Suppose the painter to take, for his subject, that part of Æneas's story, where, with his Penates, his father, and his son, he is preparing to set sail for Italy. To draw Troy in flames, as a constituent part of this picture, would be manifestly absurd. It would be painting two subjects, instead of one. And perhaps Troja incensa might seize the attention before, Ascanium Anchisenque patrem Teucrosque Penates. But a distant perspective of burning Troy, might be thrown into a corner of the piece, that is episodically, with good advantage; where instead of distracting the attention, and breaking the unity of the subject, it would concenter, as it were, with the great design, and have an effect in augmenting the distress of it. Hurd's notes on Horace's art of poetry. All gaz'd in silence, with an eager look, Then from the golden couch the hero spoke. Ah mighty queen! you urge me to disclose, And feel, once more, unutterable woes; How vengeful Greece with victory was crown'd, And Troy's fair empire humbled to the ground; Those direful scenes I saw on Phrygia's shore, Those wars in which so large a part I bore, The fiercest Argive would with tears bewail, And stern Ulysses tremble at the tale: 11. And lo! the night precipitates away;] Notwithstanding these words contain a good reason to excuse Æneas from the task desired of him; yet I much mistake, if that was the only reason why the poet inserted them: The idea of the night-scene adds very much to the solemnity and awfulness of the relation. Indeed the whole disposition of the scene and the concomitant circumstances is admirable in every respect. A great prince, driven by a storm to a strange coast, entertained by a great queen, in a numerous assembly of princes and nobility and guards, and attendants supposed to be listening at a distance, after a magnificent banquet, in the large hall of a stately palace, hung round with tapers and flambeaus, in the dead of night, relates to her, at her request, such a surprising history of wars, distresses, and travels as was never before heard of. Trapp.And lo! the night precipitates away; The stars, grown dim before the dawning day, Call to repose; but since you long to know, And curious listen to the story'd woe; Tho' my shock'd soul recoils, my tongue shall tell, But with a bleeding heart, how Ilion fell. The Grecian kings, (for many a rolling year, Repell'd by fate, and harrass'd by the war;) By Pallas' aid, of season'd fir compose 20. A steed that tow'ring, &amp;c.] Servius observes, that when Virgil speaks of the building this horse, he makes use of the terms which belong to the shipwright's trade. Pausanias says, that every one must either allow that this horse was an engine made to batter the walls of Troy, or that the Trojans were most strangely infatuated. Tubero and Hyginus, according to Servius on this passage, were likewise of opinion, that it was such an engine as the ram or the testudo, invented for the purpose mentioned by Pausanias, which Propertius (says Mr. Merric) seems to allude to when he says, Aut quis equo pulsas abiegno nosceret arces? But that it was expressly the same as the battering ram is asserted only on the authority of Pliny, whose words are as follows: Equum, qui nunc Aries appellatur, in muralibus machinis, Epeum ad Trojam invenisse dicunt. Lib. vii. c. 56. But no historical authority can be produced that is reconcileable with Pliny's assertion. Though the original of this story of the Trojan horse be thus uncertain, yet it can scarce be imagined that the fiction could have been raised so early, and spread so universally without some foundation in history. Several therefore have been inclined to believe the account which is given of it by Palaephatus, whose testimony carries with it the greater weight on account of his antiquity, as he is thought to have lived before Homer. It is reported, says this author, that the Greeks took Troy, by enclosing themselves in a wooden horse. But the truth of the story is, that they built a horse of so large a size, that it could not be drawn within the city walls. In the mean while the chief of them, lay concealed in a hollow place near the city, which is to this day called ??????? ?????, the Grecian ambuscade. Sinon upon this deserted to the Trojans, and persuaded them to admit the horse within the city, assuring them that the Greeks would not return to molest them any more. The Trojans believing him, make a breach in their walls to let in the horse, thro' which the enemy entered at night, while the inhabitants were feasting, and sacked the town. Palaephatus, de Incredibilibus. It is observable, that this relation agrees in many particulars with that which the poets have given us; and as to that remarkable circumstance of the Grecian ambuscade, it seems to be obscurely hinted at, in a tradition mentioned by Servius; namely, that the Greeks lay in ambush behind a hill called Hippius, and from thence surprized the Trojans. Bonifacio, an Italian, joins with Aldus in supposing, that this hill not only took its name from the Greek word for a horse, but was likewise in the figure of one; the same author observes, that the Italians to this day make use of a rampart, which they call Cavalliero.A steed, that tow'ring like a mountain rose; This they pretend their common vow, to gain A safe return, and measure back the main: Such the report; but guileful Argos hides Her bravest heroes in the monster's sides; Deep, deep within, they throng'd the dreadful gloom, And half a host lay ambush'd in the womb. An isle, in antient times renown'd by fame, Lies full in view, and Tenedos the name; Once blest with wealth, while Priam held the sway, But now a broken, rough, and dang'rous bay: 31. Thither their unsuspected course they bore,] Mr. Merric, in his learned notes on Tryphiodorus, has observed, that the Menapii, a people bordering on the Rhine, were surprized by the same stratagem, which the Greeks are here described making use of to circumvent the Trojans. The story is related by Caesar, in his history of the Gallic war, Lib. iv. cap. 4.Thither their unsuspected course they bore, And hid their hosts within the winding shore. We deem'd them sail'd for Greece; transported Troy Forgot her woes, and gave a loose to joy; Threw wide her gates, and pour'd forth all her train, To view th'abandon'd camp, and empty plain. Here the Dolopian troops their station held; There proud Achilles' tent o'erlook'd the field; Here rang'd the thousand vessels stood, and there In conflict join'd the furious sons of war. Some view the gift of Pallas with surprize, The fatal monster, and its wondrous size. And first Thymoetes mov'd the crowd to lead And lodge within the tower the lofty steed; Or, with design, his country to destroy, Or fate determin'd now the fall of Troy. But hoary Capys, and the wise, require To plunge the treacherous gift of Greece in fire, Or whelm the mighty monster in the tides, Or bore the ribs, and search the cavern'd sides. Their own wild will the noisy crowds obey, And vote, as partial fancy points the way; Till bold Laocoon, with a mighty train, From the high tower rush'd furious to the plain; And sent his voice from far, with rage inspir'd— What madness, Trojans, has your bosoms fir'd? Think you the Greeks are sail'd before the wind? Think you these presents safe, they leave behind? And is Ulysses banish'd from your mind? Or this prodigious fabric must inclose, Deep in its darksom womb, our ambush'd foes; Or 'tis some engine, rais'd to batter down The tow'rs of Ilion, or command the town; Ah! trust not Greece, nor touch her gifts abhorr'd; Her gifts are more destructive than her sword. Swift as the word, his pond'rous lance he threw; Against the sides the furious javelin flew, Thro' the wide womb a spacious passage found, And shook with long vibrations in the wound. The monster groans, and shakes the distant shore; And, round his caverns roll'd, the deep'ning thunders roar. Then, had not partial fate conspir'd to blind, With more than madness, ev'ry Trojan mind, The crowd the treach'rous ambush had explor'd, And not a Greek had 'scap'd the vengeful sword; Old Priam still his empire would enjoy, And still thy tow'rs had stood, majestic Troy! Meantime, before the king, the Dardan swains, With shouts triumphant, brought a youth in chains, A willing captive to the Trojan hands, To open Ilion to the Grecian bands; Bold and determin'd either fate to try; Resolv'd to circumvent, or fix'd to die. The troops tumultuous gather round the foe, To see the captive, and insult his woe. Now hear the falshoods of the Grecian train; All, all in one; a nation in a man. For while confounded and disarm'd he stands, And trembling views around the Phrygian bands, Alas! what hospitable land, (he cry'd) Or oh! what seas a wand'ring wretch will hide? Not only banish'd from the Grecian state; But Troy, avenging Troy, demands my fate. His melting tears, and moving sighs controul Our rising rage, and soften ev'ry soul. We bid him tell his race, and long to know The fate and tidings of a captive foe. At length, encourag'd thus, the youth reply'd, And laid his well dissembled fears aside. All, all, with truth, great monarch, I confess, And first I own my birth deriv'd from Greece; 103. Yet Sinon can defy] Hesychius (says Mr. Merric abovementioned) speaks of a tragedy of Sophocles by the name of Sinon, and Aristotle seems to allude to it in his poetics. Were this performance still extant, we should very probably find Virgil indebted to it for several particulars in the management of this incident.Wretch as he is, yet Sinon can defy The frowns of fortune, and disdains a lye. You know, perchance, great Palamedes' name, Thro' many a distant realm renown'd by fame; Condemn'd, tho' guiltless, when he mov'd for peace, Condemn'd for treason by the voice of Greece. Tho' false the charge, the glorious heroe bled, But now the Greeks deplore the warrior dead. Me, yet a youth, my father sent to share With him, my kinsman, in the toils of war. Long as that heroe stood secure from fate, Long as his counsels prop'd the Grecian state, Ev'n I could boast an honourable name, And claim some title to a share of fame: But when the prince, (a well-known truth I tell,) 117. Ulysses' arts] Some manuscripts read fallacis instead of pellacis Ulyssei; but the latter epithet seems the stronger of the two, and more applicable to the seducing Ulysses. Lucretius uses the substantive, placidi pellacia ponti subdola.By dire Ulysses' arts and envy fell; Soon as he ceas'd to breathe this vital air, I drag'd my days in darkness and despair. And, if kind heav'n shou'd give me back once more Safe and triumphant to my native shore, For innocence condemn'd, revenge I vow'd, Mad as I was, and spoke my rage aloud. This mov'd Ulysses' hate, and hence arose. My past misfortunes, and my present woes. Eager he sought the means, and watch'd the time To charge me too with some pretended crime. For conscious of his guilt, my death he vow'd, And with dark hints amus'd the list'ning crowd. 130. At length with Calchas he concerts the scheme] There is a just observation of Mr. Spence on the great art of the poet in this passage. Have you not observed (says he) a larger sort of break, which is used artificially in a poem to incite the attention of the reader? I mean, when the narration is dropt in the most engaging parts of it, or just before some very material incident: this adds a double desire of hearing: the audience generally make it their request, that the speaker would go on, and inform them of the sequel. Thus it is in the eleventh Odyssey. Ulysses, in the midst of his account of the infernal regions, makes a feint of concluding: we are immediately told, that the Phæacians were eager to hear him on; and 'tis observable, that the very same break, and the very same sentiment after it, is imitated by Virgil. Donec Calchante ministro ? Tum vero ardemus scitari. 'Tis indeed improved in the latter; he has all the use of Homer's suspense, without the tediousness of it. Essay on Pope's Odyssey, Part ii. 43.At length with Calchas he concerts the scheme— But why, why dwell I on this hateful theme? Or why detain you with a tale of woe? Since you determine ev'ry Greek, a foe. Strike, strike; th'Atrides will my death enjoy, And dire Ulysses thank the sword of Troy. Now blind to Grecian frauds, we burn to know With fond desire the causes of his woe; Who thus, still trembling as he stood, and pale, Pursu'd the moving melancholy tale. Oft' had our hosts determin'd to employ Their sails for Greece, and leave untaken Troy, Urg'd to a shameful flight, from deep despair, And the long labours of a ten-year's war. And oh! that they had sail'd!—as oft' the force Of southern winds, and tempests stop'd their course. But since this steed was rais'd; strait, bellowing loud, Deep thunders roar'd, and burst from ev'ry cloud. We sent Eurypilus to Phœbus' shrine, Who brought this sentence from the voice divine; 150.—Ye calm'd the main With blood, ye Grecians, and a virgin slain.] This virgin was Iphigenia the daughter of Agamemnon; whom the oracle declared must be sacrificed, before the Grecian fleet which lay at Aulis, could obtain a favourable wind to carry it to the siege of Troy. One of Euripides's finest tragedies is on this interesting subject; and it has been imitated, and its principal beauties translated in one of Racine's on the same subject.When first ye sail'd for Troy, ye calm'd the main With blood, ye Grecians, and a virgin slain; And ere you measure back the foamy flood, Know, you must buy a safe return with blood. These awful words to ev'ry Greek impart Surprize and dread, and chill the bravest heart; To the dire stroke each thought himself decreed, Himself the victim that for Greece should bleed. Ulysses then, importunate and loud, Produc'd sage Calchas to the trembling crowd, Bade him the secret will of heav'n relate— And now my friends could prophesy my fate; And base Ulysses' wicked arts, they said, Were level'd all at my devoted head. Ten days the prophet from the crowd retir'd, Nor mark'd the victim that the gods requir'd. So long besieg'd by Ithacus he stood, And seem'd reluctant to the voice of blood; At length he spoke, and, as the scheme was laid, Doom'd to the slaughter my predestin'd head. All prais'd the sentence, and were pleas'd to see The fate that threaten'd all, confin'd to me. And now the dire tremendous day was come, When all prepar'd to solemnize my doom; The salted barley on my front was spread, The sacred fillets hound my destin'd head: I fled th'appointed slaughter, I confess, And, till our troops should hoist their sails for Greece, Swift to a slimy lake I took my flight, Lay wrapt in flags, and cover'd by the night. And now these eyes shall view my native shore, 181. My dear, dear children,] No wonder the Trojans, who were ignorant of Sinon's design were moved at these verses, when 'tis scarce possible even for us, who know the villany of them, to read them without tears: At least I speak for one; I have cry'd over them many a time when I was a school-boy, and am not ashamed to own that I am still exceedingly affected by them; I take it to be one of the most moving passages I ever met with. Virgil, to shew the triumph of his art, will soften us with the tenderest compassion by the mouth of one whom we know to be a perjur'd villain. It is not indeed upon the account of him, but of human nature in general: But still the person thro' whom it was convey'd would have prejudic'd us against it; had not the force of it been irresistible. No hope of ever more seeing his beloved native country, children, father! that was distressful enough; but little in comparison of what follows: there was danger that those dear lives would be sacrificed in his absence, and for his sake. Trapp.My dear, dear children, and my sire no more; Whom haply Greece to slaughter has decreed, And for my fatal flight condemn'd to bleed. But thee, o gracious monarch, I implore By ev'ry god, by ev'ry sacred pow'r, Who conscious of the facts my lips relate, With truth inspire me to declare my fate; By all the solemn sanctions that can bind In holy ties the faith of human kind; Have mercy, mercy, on a guiltless foe, O'erwhelm'd and sunk with such a weight of woe! His life we gave him, and dispell'd his fears, Touch'd with his moving eloquence of tears; And, melting first, the good old king commands To free the captive, and to loose his hands. Then with soft accents, and a pleasing look, Mild and benevolent the monarch spoke. Henceforth let Greece no more thy thoughts employ, But live a subject and a son of Troy; With truth and strict sincerity proceed, Say, to what end they fram'd this monstrous steed; Who was its author, what his aim, declare; Some solemn vow? or engine of the war? Skill'd in the frauds of Greece, the captive rears His hands unshackled to the golden stars; You, ye eternal splendors! he exclaims, And you divine inviolable flames, Ye fatal swords and altars, which I fled, Ye wreaths that circled this devoted head; All, all, attest! that justly I release My sworn allegiance to the laws of Greece, Renounce my country, hate her sons, and lay Their inmost counsels open to the day. And thou, O Troy, by Sinon snatch'd from fate, Spare, spare the wretch, who saves the Phrygian state. Greece on Minerva's aid rely'd alone, Since first the labours of the war begun. But from that execrable point of time, When Ithacus, the first in ev'ry crime, With Tydeus' impious son, the guards had slain, And brought her image from the Phrygian fane, Distain'd her sacred wreaths with murderous hands, Still red and reeking from the slaughter'd bands; Then ceas'd the triumphs of the Grecian train, And their full tide of conquest sunk again; Their strength decay'd, and many a dreadful sign To trembling Greece proclaim'd the wrath divine. Scarce to the camp the sacred image came, When from her eyes she flash'd a living flame; A briny sweat bedew'd her limbs around, And thrice she sprung indignant from the ground; Thrice was she seen with martial rage to wield Her pond'rous spear, and shake her blazing shield. With that, sage Calchas mov'd the trembling train To fly, and measure back the deeps again; That 'twas not giv'n our armies to destroy The Phrygian empire, and the tow'rs of Troy, Till they should bring from Greece those favouring gods, Who smil'd indulgent, when they plow'd the floods; 240. With more auspicious signs,] It is certain that Virgil often attributes to the Greeks the customs of the Romans. Perhaps indeed they were the same in Greece that they afterwards were in Rome. At least it appears to be certain, that the Roman generals always returned to Rome after an unfortunate expedition, and never returned to the same enterprize till they had taken new auspices. Livy assures us of this, H. l. 10. and l. 23. They called this ceremony Redauspicari.With more auspicious signs repass the main, And with new omens take the field again. Now to their native country they repair, With gather'd forces to renew the war; The scheme of Calchas! but their vanish'd host Will soon return to waste the Phrygian coast. All Greece, atoning dire Ulysses' deed, To Pallas' honour rais'd this wound'rous steed; But Calchas order'd this enormous size, This monstrous bulk, that heaves into the skies, Lest Troy should lead it thro' her opening gate, And by this new palladium guard her state. For oh! ye Phrygians, had your rage profan'd This gift of Pallas with an impious hand, Some fate (which all ye pow'rs immortal shed With all your vengeance on its author's head!) In one prodigious ruin would destroy Thy empire, Priam, and the sons of Troy. But would you join within your walls to lead This pledge of heav'n, this tutelary steed; Then, with her hosts, all Asia shall repair, And pour on Pelops' walls a storm of war; Then Greece shall bleed, and perish in her turn; Her future sons; her nations yet unborn. Thus did the perjur'd Sinon's art prevail; Too fondly we believ'd the study'd tale; And thus was Troy, who bravely could sustain Achilles' fury, when he swept the plain, A thousand vessels, and a ten years war, Won by a sigh, and vanquish'd by a tear. Here a more dreadful object rose to sight, And shook our souls with horror and affright. Unblest Laocoon, whom the lots design Priest of the year, at Neptune's holy shrine Slew on the sands, beside the rolling flood, A stately steer, in honour of the god. When, horrid to relate! two serpents glide And roll incumbent on the glassy tide, Advancing to the shore; their spires they raise Fold above fold, in many a tow'ring maze. Beneath their burnish'd breasts the waters glow, Their crimson crests inflame the deeps below; O'er the vast flood extended long and wide, Their curling backs lay floating on the tide; Lash'd to a foam the boiling billows roar, And now the dreadful monsters reach'd the shore; Their hissing tongues they darted, as they came, And their red eye-balls shot a sanguine flame. Pale at the sight, we fled in dire dismay; Strait to Laocoon they direct their way; 290. And first in curling fiery volumes] There is now in Rome a very ancient statue entangled in a couple of marble serpents, which admirable groupe of figures is said to be the work of Phidias. Pliny the elder tells us he had seen it in the palace of Titus. But the poet has the advantage of the statuary. The statuary can take but one point of time; the poet can describe any action successively. Here you have the whole suite. You first see the serpents on the sea; then on the shore; then killing the two sons of Laocoon; and lastly killing Laocoon himself. This may make almost every particular in this description of Laocoon's death, different from the famous groupe of it in the Vatican, except his own attitude, and the air of his head; which are like enough to be copied, the one from the other. Spence.And first in curling fiery volumes bound His two young sons, and wrapt them round and round, Devour'd the children in the father's view; Then on the miserable father flew, While to their aid he runs with fruitless haste; And all the man in horrid folds embrac'd: Twice round his waist, and round his neck they rear Their winding heads, and hiss aloft in air. His sacred wreaths the livid poisons stain, And, while he labours at the knots in vain, Stung to the soul, he bellows with the pain. So, when the ax has glanc'd upon his skull, Breaks from the shrine, and roars the wounded bull. But each huge serpent now retires again, And flies for shelter to Minerva's fane; Her buckler's orb the goddess wide display'd, And screen'd her monsters in the dreadful shade. Then, a new fear the trembling crowd possest, A holy horror pants in every breast; All judge Laocoon justly doom'd to bleed, Whose guilty spear profan'd the sacred steed. We vote to lead him to Minerva's tow'r, And supplicate, with vows, th'offended pow'r. All to the fatal labour bend their care, Level the walls, and lay the bulwarks bare; Some round the lofty neck the cables tye, Some to the feet the rolling wheels apply? The tow'ring monster, big with Ilion's doom, Mounts o'er the wall; an army in the womb; Around the moving pile the children join In shouts of transport, and in songs divine; They run, they pull the stretching cords with joy, And lend their little hands to ruin Troy! In one loud peal th'enormous horse rolls down, And thund'ring gains the center of the town. Oh Troy, renown'd in war! oh bright abodes! Oh glorious Troy! the labour of the gods!— Thrice stop'd unmov'd the monster in the gate, And clashing arms thrice warn'd us of our fate; But we, by madness blinded and o'ercome, Lodge the dire monster in the sacred dome. 331. Cassandra too, inspir'd,] Virgil does but just mention Cassandra on this occasion, without giving us the particulars of her prophecy. All he says of her is included in two lines: Tunc etiam fatis aperit Cassandra futuris Ora, Dei jussu non unquam credita Teucris. It had been very injudicious in Virgil to have put a long harangue into her mouth, since whatever she could have said, would have been little else but a repetition of what Laocoon had said at the beginning of the book. The death of Laocoon, which immediately follows his speech (verse 41) together with the amazing circumstances attending it, were admirably contrived by Virgil, (or perhaps Sophocles, who is said to have written a tragedy on that subject) and were sufficient to confirm the Trojans in their belief of Sinon's story. Merric's notes on Tryphiodorus, page 71.Cassandra too, inspir'd, our fate declares (So Phœbus doom'd) to unregarding ears; We, thoughtless wretches! deck the shrines, and waste In sports the day, which heav'n decreed our last. Now had the sun roll'd down the beamy light, And from the caves of Ocean rush'd the night; With one black veil her spreading shades suppress The face of nature, and the frauds of Greece. The Trojans round their walls in silence lay, And lost in sleep the labours of the day. When lo! their course the Grecian navy bore, New-rigg'd and arm'd, and reach'd the well-known shore, By silent Cynthia's friendly beams convey'd; And the proud admiral a flame display'd. Then Sinon, favour'd by the partial gods, Unlocks the mighty monster's dark abodes; His peopled caves pour forth in open air The heroes, and the whole imprison'd war. Led by the guiding cord, alight with joy Th'impatient princes, in the midst of Troy; Machaon first, then great Achilles' heir, Ulysses, Thoas, Acamas, appear; A crowd of chiefs with Menelaus succeed; Epeus last, who fram'd the fraudful steed. Strait they invade the city, bury'd deep In fumes of wine, and all dissolv'd in sleep; They slay the guards, they burst the gates, and join Their fellows, conscious to the bold design. 'Twas now the time when first kind heav'n bestows On wretched man the blessings of repose; When, in my slumbers, Hector seem'd to rise A mournful vision! to my closing eyes. Such he appear'd, as when Achilles' car And fiery coursers whirl'd him thro' the war; Drawn thro' his swelling feet the thongs I view'd, His beauteous body black with dust and blood. Ye gods! how chang'd from Hector! who with joy Return'd in proud Achilles' spoils to Troy; Flung at the ships, like heav'n's almighty sire, Flames after flames, and wrapt a fleet in fire. Now gash'd with wounds that for his Troy he bore, His beard and locks stood stiffen'd with his gore. With tears and mournful accents I began, And thus bespoke the visionary man! Say, glorious prince, thy country's hope and joy, What cause so long detains thee from thy Troy? Say, from what realms, so long desir'd in vain, Her Hector comes, to bless her eyes again? After such numbers slain, such labours past, Thus is our prince! ah! thus return'd at last? Why stream these wounds? or who could thus disgrace The manly charms of that majestic face? Nought to these questions vain the shade replies, But from his bosom draws a length of sighs; Fly, fly, oh! fly the gathering flames; the walls Are won by Greece, and glorious Ilion falls; Enough to Priam and to Troy before Was paid; then strive with destiny no more; Could any mortal hand prevent our fate, This hand, and this alone, had sav'd the state. Troy to thy care commends her wand'ring gods; With these pursue thy fortunes o'er the floods To that proud city, thou shalt raise at last, Return'd from wand'ring wide the watry waste. This said, he brought from Vesta's hallow'd quire The sacred wreaths, and everlasting fire. 397. Round the walls arise,] This puts me in mind of a line in Lucretius that is marvellously fine, where that poet (who had the warmest imagination of all the Roman writers,) unites together in one verse all the dreadful images of war, which he says is carried on, Vulneribus, clamore, fugâ, terrore, tumultu. Lib. v. 1335.Meantime tumultuous round the walls arise Shrieks, clamours, shouts, and mingle in the skies. And (tho' remote my father's palace stood, With shades surrounded, and a gloomy wood) Near, and more near, approach the dire alarms; The voice of woe; the dreadful din of arms. Rous'd at the deaf'ning peal that roars around, I mount the dome, and listen to the sound. 405. Thus o'er the corn] Upon the occasion of Æneas's making this simile, I cannot forbear hazarding an observation for which perhaps some critics may severely censure me. However that may be, it appears to me; that Virgil is injudicious in putting these comparisons into the mouth of Æneas. The hero in this and some other passages, is by far too great a poet. Virgil seems to forget that Æneas is speaking, and not himself. What can be more unnatural and offensive to propriety, than for Æneas to stop in a narration, where he is describing the desolation of his own city, to make a laboured comparison of five or six lines about a fire seizing a field of corn, or a shepherd listening to the roarings of a torrent? In short, I think all the similes Æneas uses in this second and the third book, during the time he is relating his story and adventures to Dido, are as injudicious, and as ill-placed as those laboured comparisons are with which the acts of several celebrated modern tragedies are concluded.Thus o'er the corn, while furious winds conspire, Rolls on a wide-devouring blaze of fire; Or some big torrent, from a mountain's brow, Bursts, pours, and thunders down the vale below, O'erwhelms the fields, lays waste the golden grain, And headlong sweeps the forests to the main; Stun'd at the din, the swain with list'ning ears From some steep rock the sounding ruin hears. Now Hector's warning prov'd too clear and true, The wiles of Greece appear'd in open view; The roaring flames in volumes huge aspire, And wrap thy dome, Deïphobus, in fire; Thine, sage Ucalegon, next strow'd the ground, And stretch'd a vast unmeasur'd ruin round, Wide o'er the waves the bright reflection plays; The surges redden with the distant blaze. 421. Then shouts and trumpets] It is the observation of Mons. Dacier, that Virgil hath been guilty of a mistake in this particular, of describing the trumpet as used in the sacking Exoritur clamorque virûm clangorque turbarum. And he likewise celebrates Misenus as the trumpeter of Æneas: but as Virgil wrote at a time very remote from those heroic ages, perhaps this liberty may be excused. However, a poet had better confine himself to customs and manners like a good painter; and it is equally a fault in either of them to ascribe to times and nations any thing with which they were unacquainted. This hath been a rock on which many a poet hath struck, and made himself highly ridiculous to the judicious and discerning; preposterously and unnaturally mixing modern with antient manners and customs. A practice as absurd, to use Voltaire's allusion, as it was for certain Italian and Flemish painters to represent the virgin Mary with a chaplet of beads hanging at her girdle, to place Swiss guards at the door of the apartment of Pharaoh; and to mix cannons and carabines with the antient arrows in the battle of Joshua.Then shouts and trumpets swell the dire alarms; And, tho' 'twas vain, I madly flew to arms: Eager to raise a band of friends, and pour In one firm body, to defend the tow'r; Rage and revenge my kindling bosom fire, Warm, and in arms, to conquer or expire. But lo! poor Pantheus, Phœbus' priest appears, Just scap'd the foe, distracted with his fears, The sage his vanquish'd gods and reliques bore, And with his trembling grandson sought the shore. Say, Pantheus, how the fate of Ilion stands? Say, if a tow'r remains in Trojan hands? He thus with groans;—Our last sad hour is come, Our certain, fixt, inevitable doom. 435. Troy once was great] Virgil had his eye undoubtedly on a passage in the Troades of Euripides, where Andromache and Hecuba speak, as follows, ????.—???? ??? ????. ????.—??????? ?????, ?????? ?????.Troy once was great, but oh! the scene is o'er, Her glory vanish'd! and her name no more! For partial Jove transfers her past renown To Greece, who triumphs in her burning town; And the huge monster from his op'ning side; Pours forth her warriors in an endless tide; With joy proud Sinon sees the flames aspire, Heaps blaze on blaze, and mingles fire with fire; Here thousands pouring through the gates appear, Far more than proud Mycenæ sent to war. Some seize the passes; groves of spears arise, That thirst for blood, and flash against the skies. The guards but just maintain a feeble fight With their fierce foes, amidst the gloomy night. 449. While Pantheus' words] There is a very majestic and solemn air of lamentation in this speech of Pantheus; and its being put into the mouth of the priest of Phoebus, adds a dignity and importance to it.While Pantheus' words, while ev'ry god inspires, I flew to arms; and rush'd amidst the fires, Where the loud furies call, where shouts and cries Ring round the walls, and thunder in the skies. Now faithful Ripheus on my side appears, With hoary Iphitus, advanc'd in years; And valiant Hypanis and Dymas, known By the pale splendors of the glimm'ring moon; With these Chorœbus, Mygdon's generous boy, Who came, ill-fated, to the wars of Troy; Fir'd with the fair Cassandra's blooming charms, To aid her sire with unavailing arms; Ah! brave unhappy youth!—he would not hear His bride inspir'd, who warn'd him from the war! These when I saw, with fierce collected might, Breathing revenge, and crowding to the fight; With warmth I thus address'd the gen'rous train: Ye bold, brave youths, but bold and brave in vain! If by your dauntless souls impell'd, you dare With me to try th'extremities of war; You see our hopeless state; how every god, Who guarded Troy, has left his old abode; You aid a town already sunk in fire; Fly, fly to arms, and gloriously expire; Let all rush on, and, vanquish'd as we are, Catch one last beam of safety from despair. Thus while my words inflame the list'ning crew, With rage redoubled to the fight they flew. As hungry wolves, while clouds involve the day, Rush from their dens; and, prowling wide for prey, Howl to the tempest, while the savage brood, Stretch'd in the cavern, pant and thirst for blood; So thro' the town, determin'd to expire, Through the thick storm of darts, and smoke and fire, Wrapt and surrounded with the shades of night, We rush'd to certain death, and mingled in the fight. What tongue the dreadful slaughter could disclose? Or oh! what tears could answer half our woes? The glorious empress of the nations round, 488. Majestic Troy, lay level'd] This description is sublime and pathetic; but how infinitely is it excelled by a passage in the prophet Isaiah, where he is speaking of the destruction of Babylon? “And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there, neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. But wild beasts of the desart shall lie there, and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces.” Chap. xiii.Majestic Troy, lay level'd with the ground; Her murder'd natives crowded her abodes, Her streets, her domes, the temples of her gods. Nor Ilion bled alone: her turn succeeds; And then she conquers, and proud Argos bleeds; Death in a thousand forms destructive frown'd, And woe, despair, and horror rag'd around. And first Androgeos, whom a train attends, With stile familiar hail'd us as his friends; Haste, brave associates, haste; what dull delay Detains you here, while others seize the prey? In flames your friends have laid all Ilion waste, And you come lagging from your ships the last. Thus he; but soon from our reply he knows His fatal error, compass'd round with foes; Restrains his tongue, and, meditating flight, Stops short;—and startles at the dreadful sight. 505. So the pale swain,] This fine simile, remarkable for its justness and propriety, is copied and imitated from one of Homer, in the third book of his Iliad. Mr. Pope makes this curious remark on it. “It may be said to the praise of Virgil, that he has applied it upon an occasion where it has an additional beauty.” Paris, upon the sight of Menelaus's approach, is compared to a traveller who sees a snake shoot on a sudden towards him: but the surprize and danger of Androgeus is more lively, being just in the reach of his enemies before he perceived it: and the circumstance of the serpent rousing his crest, (Attollentem iras, et caerula colla tumentem.) which brightens with anger, finely images the shining of their arms in the night time, as they were just lifted up to destroy him. Scaliger criticises on the needless repetition of the words in Homer, ?????????? and ?????????? which is avoided in the translation. But it must be observed in general, that little exactnesses are what we should not look for in Homer; the genius of his age was too incorrect, and his own too fiery to regard them. Notes on the third book of the Iliad, l. 47.So the plain swain, who treads upon a snake Unseen, and lurking in the gloomy brake, Soon as his swelling spires in circles play, Starts back, and shoots precipitate away. Fierce we rush in, the heedless foes surround, And lay the wretches breathless on the ground: New to the place, with sudden terror wild; And thus at first our flatt'ring fortune smil'd. Then, by his courage and success inspir'd, His warlike train the brave Chorœbus fir'd; Lo! friends, the road of safety you survey; Come, follow fortune, where she points the way; Let each in Argive arms his limbs disguise, And wield the bucklers, that the foe supplies; For if success an enemy attends, Who asks, if fraud or valour gain'd his ends? This said, Androgeos' crested helm he wore; Then, on his arm, the ponderous buckler bore With beauteous figures grac'd, and warlike pride; The starry sword hung glitt'ring at his side. Like him, bold Ripheus, Dymas, and the rest, Their manly limbs in hostile armour drest. With gods averse, we follow to the fight, And, undistinguish'd in the shades of night, Mix with the foes, employ the murd'ring steel, And plunge whole squadrons to the depths of hell. Some, wild with fear, precipitate retreat, Fly to the shore, and shelter in the fleet; Some climb the monstrous horse, a frighted train, And there lie trembling in the sides again. But, heav'n against us, all attempts must fail, All hopes are vain, nor courage can prevail; 537. For lo! Cassandra, lo! the royal fair] This is a beautiful and moving picture of the lovely prophetess in distress. A reader of taste will not be displeased to see her story in the words of Mr. Thompson, taken from his noble tragedy of Agamemnon, a play written in the true taste of the antients, and enriched with many excellent imitations and translations from the Greek tragedies. This Priam's fairest daughter, Is a young princess of engaging beauty Rais'd by distress; of noble sense and spirit But by poetic visions led astray, She dreamt Apollo lov'd her, and the gift Of prophecy bestowed to gain her promise: The gift once hers, the chastly-faithless maid Deceiv'd the God; who therefore in revenge Since he could not recall it, made it useless, For ever doom'd to meet with disregard. Act. iv. scene i.For lo! Cassandra, lo! the royal fair From Pallas' shrine with loose dishevel'd hair Dragg'd by the shouting victors;—to the skies She rais'd, but rais'd in vain, her glowing eyes; 541. Her eyes—she could no more—] The only gesture described by Homer, as used by the ancients in the invocation of the gods, is the lifting up their hands to heaven. Virgil frequently alludes to this passage; particularly in the second book there is a passage, the beauty of which is much raised by this consideration. Pope's notes. Iliad v. There is a fine Cassandra in the Florentine collection, in this attitude of distress.Her eyes—she could no more—the Grecian bands Had rudely manacled her tender hands; Chorœbus could not bear that scene of woes, But, fir'd with fury, flew amidst the foes; As swift we follow to redeem the fair, Rush to his aid, and thicken to the war. Here from the temple on our troop descends A storm of javelins from our Trojan friends, Who from our arms and helmets deem'd us foes; And hence a dreadful scene of slaughter rose. Then all the Greeks our slender band invade, And pour enrag'd to seize the rescu'd maid; Ajax with all the bold Dolopians came, And both the kings of Atreus' royal name. So when the winds in airy conflict rise, Here south and west charge dreadful in the skies; There louder Eurus, to the battle borne, Mounts the swift coursers of the purple morn; Beneath the whirlwind roar the bending woods; With his huge trident Neptune strikes the floods: Foams, storms, and tempesting the deeps around, Bares the broad bosom of the dark profound. Those too, we chas'd by night, a scatter'd train, Now boldly rally, and appear again. To them our Argive helms and arms are known, Our voice and language diff'ring from their own. We yield to numbers. By Peneleus' steel First at Minerva's shrine Chorœbus fell. Next Ripheus bled, the justest far of all The sons of Troy; yet heav'n permits his fall. The like sad fate brave Hypanis attends And hapless Dymas, slaughter'd by their friends. Nor thee, sage Pantheus! Phoebus' wreaths could save, Nor all thy shining virtues from the grave. Ye dear, dear ruins! and thou, Troy! declare If once I trembled or declin'd the war: Midst flames and foes a glorious death I sought, And well deserv'd the death for which I fought. Thence we retreat, our brave associates gone, Pelias and Iphitus were left alone; This slow with age and bending to the ground, And that more tardy from Ulysses' wound. Now from the palace-walls tumultuous ring The shouts, and call us to defend the king; There we beheld the rage of fight, and there The throne of death, and center of the war; As Troy, all Troy beside had slept in peace, Nor stain'd by slaughter, nor alarm'd by Greece. 589. Shield lock'd] The testudo was properly a figure which the soldiers cast themselves into; so that their targets should close altogether above their heads, and defend them from the missive weapons of the enemy; as if we suppose, the first rank to have stood upright on their feet, and the rest to have stoop'd lower and lower by degrees, till the last rank kneel'd down upon their knees: so that every rank covering with their target, the heads of all in the rank before them, they resembled a tortoise's shell, or a sort of penthouse. Kennett's Antiq. B. iv.Shield lock'd in shield, advance the Grecian pow'rs, To burst the gates, and storm the regal tow'rs; Fly up the steep ascent where danger calls, And fix their scaling engines in the walls. High in the left they grasp'd the fenceful shield, Fierce in the right the rocky ramparts held; Roofs, tow'rs, and battlements the Trojans throw, A pile of ruins! on the Greeks below; Catch for defense the weapons of despair, In these the dire extremes of death and war. Now on their heads the pond'rous beams are roll'd, By Troy's first monarchs crusted round with gold. Here thronging troops with glitt'ring fau'chions stand, To guard the portals, and the door command. Strait to the palace, fir'd with hopes, I go To aid the vanquish'd, and repell the foe. 605. A secret portico] The palace of Priam being strongly beleaguer'd and invested, before Æneas can enter to its relief, he is driven to a necessity of stealing in with his party at a postern, either deserted, or undiscovered: thro' which, they ascend to an old tower, and push the battlements of it down upon the enemy. These are circumstances, of so low a nature in themselves, as not to admit of being embellished, or wrought up to the dignity of heroic poetry. Virgil was conscious of this objection; and happily found the means of heightening, and enlivening, both circumstances by the help of fiction. To elevate the affair of the blind postern, he feigns, that thro' this gate and passage, in the times of her prosperity, Andromache was used to lead her young Astyanax to visit his old grandsire Priam; by this image, noble and elevated in itself, and full of tenderness, the lowness of the circumstance, with regard to the postern, is avoided and lost. To elevate the affair of the old mouldring tower, being pushed down, which conveys but a mean idea, he as happily feigns, that from thence they could take a prospect of all Troy, discover the camp and motions of the enemy, and survey the extent of their whole fleet. This, again, is giving the old turret a significance which makes its demolition to be considered with regret and pity; and quite turns off every thought of ridicule, arising from the manner of its tumbling. Segrais.A secret portico contriv'd behind, Great Hector's mansion to the palace join'd, By which his hapless princess oft would bring Her royal infant to the good old king. This way the topmost battlements I gain, Whence the tir'd Trojans threw their darts in vain. Rais'd on a lofty point, a turret rears Her stately head unrival'd to the stars; 613. From hence] This landscape which lay in prospect from the tower, diversifies the scenes of fire, and carnage he is describing.From hence we wont all Ilion to survey, The fields, the camp, the fleets, and rolling sea. With steel the yielding timbers we assail'd. Where loose the huge disjointed structure fail'd; Then, tugg'd convulsive from the shatter'd walls, 618. We push the pile;] This is a fine instance of the translator's making the sound of the verses an echo to the sense. The pause is likewise very judicious, and closely imitates the original, ? convellimus altis Sedibus impulimusque. I shall add a passage in Leonidas, where the Greeks gather together stones of the greatest bulk and bodies of vast trees, and push them down from Mount Œta upon the heads of the Persians who fought beneath: ? Downward sinks The nodding pile, stupendous heap of death! Trees roll'd on trees with mingled rock descend Unintermitted ruin. Loud resound The hollow trunks against the mountain's side, Swift bounds each craggy mass. ? The poet then adds a circumstance, which is entirely new and his own, and most strongly conceived. ? The foes beneath Look up aghast, with horror shrink and die. Leonidas, book v. 736.We push the pile; the pond'rous ruin falls Tumbling in many a whirl, with thund'ring sound, Down headlong on the foes, and smokes along the ground. But crowds on crowds the bury'd troops supply; And in a storm the beams and rocky fragments fly. Full in the portal rag'd with loud alarms Brave Pyrrhus, glitt'ring in bis brazen arms. 625. So from his den,] This comparison is copied from Homer Il. X. v 93. Virgil (says Dr. Theobald) speaks of the serpent, mala gramina pastus, as if poisonous herbs were his ordinary and constant diet: Homer, I think with more propriety, and a more intimate knowledge of nature, mentions the serpent as having eat poison, just when he meant to lie in wait, and was prepar'd for mischief. ????? ??????, ???????? ???? ???????. Ælian (Lib. vi. c. 4.] in his history of animals, mentions this custom of the serpent, and says it is alluded to by Homer.So from his den, the winter slept away, Shoots forth the burnish'd snake in open day; Who, fed with ev'ry poison of the plain, Sheds his old spoils, and shines in youth again; Proud of his golden scales rolls tow'ring on, And darts his forky sting, and glitters on the sun. To him the mighty Periphas succeeds, And the bold Automedon. chief who drove his fathers steeds; With these the Scyrian bands advance, and aim Full at the battlements the missive flame. Fierce Pyrrhus in the front with forceful sway Ply'd the huge ax, and hew'd the beams away; The solid timbers from the portal tore, And rent from ev'ry hinge the brazen door. At last the chief a mighty op'ning made, And, all th'imperial dome, in all her length display'd: The sacred rooms of Troy's first monarchs lie, With Priam's pomp, profan'd by every eye; In arms the centries to the breach repair, And stand embody'd, to repell the war. 646. Now far within,] The women in Greece, and all over the east (as the custom holds to this day) had their apartments quite distinct from those of men, in the inner and most retired part of the house. For their chambers to be broken open and violated was the most dreadful of calamities. Servius tells us, that all this fine passage is taken from Ennius's description of the siege of Alba; which Livy has so nobly painted in the first book of his history. The custom of kissing beds, columns, and doors, before they were oblig'd to quit them, is mentioned frequently by Sophocles and Euripides.Now far within, the regal rooms disclose, Loud and more loud, a direful scene of woes; 648. The roof resounds,] Ariosto has exactly and minutely imitated this fine description in his Orlando Furioso. Sonar per gli alti e spatiosi tetti S'odono gridi, e feminil lamenti: L' afflitti donne, percotendo i petti, Corron per casa pallide, e dolenti: E abbracian gli usci e i geniali letti, Che tosto hanno a lasciare astrane genti. Canto xvii. Stanza 13. 'Tis remarkable that Sir J. Harrington has totally omitted this fine passage (as indeed he has many others) in his translation of this celebrated Italian poet. There are a great many passages in Ariosto copied from this second book of Virgil. Dr. Theobald's second book.The roof resounds with female shrieks and cries, And the shrill echo strikes the distant skies. The trembling matrons fly from place to place, And kiss the pillars with a last embrace; Bold Pyrrhus storms with all his father's fire; The barriers burst; the vanquish'd guards retire; The shatter'd doors the thund'ring engines ply; The bolts leap back; the sounding hinges fly; The war breaks in; loud shout the hostile train; The gates are storm'd; the foremost soldiers slain: Through the wide courts the crowding Argives roam, And swarm triumphant round the regal dome. Not half so fierce the foamy deluge bounds, And bursts resistless o'er the level'd mounds; Pours down the vale, and roaring o'er the plain, Sweeps herds, and hinds, and houses to the main. These eyes within the gate th'Atrides view'd, 665. And furious Pyrrhus,] The character of this son of Achilles is all along supported with great spirit. There is a fine passage in the eleventh book of the Odyssey which from the relation it bears to this second book of the Æneid I shall quote at length. Achilles enquires of Ulysses the behaviour of his son, since he himself died: and Ulysses, to give him the highest idea of Pyrrhus his courage, answers him in the following lines: When Ilion in the horse receiv'd her doom, And unseen armies ambush'd in its womb, Greece gave her latent warriours to my care, 'Twas mine on Troy to pour th'imprison'd war: Then when the boldest bosom beat for fear, When the stern eyes of heroes drop'd a tear; Fierce in his look his ardent valour glow'd, Flush'd in his cheek or sally'd in his blood; Indignant in the dark recess he stands, Pants for the battle, and the war demands; His voice breath'd death; and with a martial air, He grasp'd his sword, and shook his glittering spear. Mr. Pope has animated and added fire to the original lines:And furious Pyrrhus cover'd o'er with blood; Sad they beheld, amid the mournful scene, The hundred daughters with the mother queen, And Priam's self polluting with his gore Those flames, he hallow'd at the shrines before. The fifty bridal rooms, a work divine! (Such were his hopes of a long regal line) Rich in Barbaric gold, with trophies crown'd, Sunk with their proud support of pillars round; And, where the flames retire, the foes possess the ground. 675. And now,] This is the only line, throughout all Æneas's narration, in which he takes notice of his audience.And now, great queen, you haply long to know The fate of Priam in this general woe. When with sad eyes the venerable sire Beheld his Ilion sunk in hostile fire; His palace storm'd, the lofty gates laid low, His rich pavillions crowded with the foe; In arms, long since disus'd, the hoary sage Loads each stiff languid limb, that shook with age; Girds on an unperforming sword in vain, And runs on death amidst the hostile train. Within the courts, beneath the naked sky, An altar rose; an aged laurel by; That o'er the hearth and houshold-gods display'd A solemn gloom, a deep majestic shade: Hither, like doves, who close-embody'd fly From some dark tempest black'ning in the sky, The queen for refuge with her daughters ran, Clung and embrac'd their images in vain. But when in cumbrous arms the king she spy'd, Alas! my poor unhappy lord! she cry'd, What more than madness, 'midst these dire alarms, Mov'd thee to load thy helpless age with arms? No aid like thine this dreadful hour demands, But asks far other strength, far other hands. No! could my own dear Hector arm again, 700. My own dear Hector,] De la Cerda imagines there is some hidden meaning in her saying My Hector, rather than Yours or Ours; as if he were the son of some God: Which conjecture is groundless and very far fetch'd. 'Tis certainly, as Dr. Trapp observes, only a fond, motherly expression, and nothing more.My own dear Hector now would arm in vain. Come to these altars; here we all shall have One common refuge, or one common grave. This said, her aged lord the queen embrac'd, And on the sacred seat the monarch plac'd. When lo! Polites, one of Priam's sons, Through darts and foes, from slaught'ring Pyrrhus runs, Wounded he traverses the cloyster'd dome, Darts through the courts, and shoots from room to room; Close, close behind, pursu'd the furious foe, Just grasp'd the youth, and aim'd the fatal blow; Soon as within his parents sight he past, Pierc'd by the pointed death, he breath'd his last: He fell; a purple stream the pavement dy'd, The soul comes gushing in the crimson tide. The king, that scene impatient to survey, Tho' death surrounds him, gives his fury way; And oh! may ev'ry violated God, Barbarian! thank thee for this deed of blood; (If Gods there are, such actions to regard,) Oh! may they give thy guilt the full reward; Guilt, that a father's sacred eyes defil'd With blood, the blood of his dear murder'd child! 723. Unlike thy sire,] Achilles in the twenty fourth book of the Iliad, receives old Priam with tenderness and compassion, and restores to him the body of his son Hector. I fancy this interview between Priam and Achilles would furnish an admirable subject for a painter, in the surprize of Achilles and the other spectators, and the attitude of Priam, and the sorrows in the countenance of this unfortunate king. That circumstance of Priam's kissing the hands of Achilles is inimitably fine; “he kiss'd, says Homer, the hands of Achilles, those terrible, murderous hands, that had robb'd him of so many sons.” By these two words the poet recalls to our minds, all the noble actions performed by Achilles in the whole Iliad: and at the same time strikes us with the utmost compassion for this unhappy king, who is reduced so low as to be obliged to kiss those hands that had slain his subjects, and ruined his kingdom and family. Pope's Iliad, xxiv. 586.Unlike thy sire, Achilles the divine! (But sure Achilles was no sire of thine!) Foe as I was, the heroe deign'd to hear The guest's, the suppliant's, king's, and father's pray'r; To funeral rites restor'd my Hector slain, And safe dismiss'd me to my realm again. This said, his trembling arm essay'd to throw The dull dead javelin, that scarce reach'd the foe; The weapon languishingly lagg'd along, And, guiltless, on the buckler faintly rung. 733. Thou then be first,] Virgil was too judicious, says Mr. Pope, to imitate Homer in some of his cruel and inhuman speeches, made over the dying and the dead; and is much more reserved in his sarcasms, and insults. There are not above four or five in the whole Æneid. That of Pyrrhus to Priam in the second book, tho' barbarous in itself, may be accounted for, as intended to raise a character of horror, and render the action of Pyrrhus odious; whereas Homer stains his most favourite characters with these barbarities. That of Ascanius over Numanus in the ninth, was a fair opportunity where Virgil might have indulged the humour of a cruel raillery, and have been excused by the youth and gaiety of the speaker; yet it is no more than a very moderate answer to the insolencies with which he had just been provoked by his enemy, only retorting two of his own words upon him. ? I, verbis virtutem illude superbis! Bis capti Phryges haec Rutulis responsa remittunt. He never suffers his Æneas to fall into this practice, but while he is on fire with indignation after the death of his friend Pallas: That short one is the best that could be said to such a tyrant: ? Ubi nunc Mezentius acer, et illa Effera vis animi? ? The worst-natured one I remember (which yet is more excusable than Homer's,) is that of Turnus to Eumedes in the twelfth book, En, agros et quam bello, Trojane, petisti, Hesperiam metire jacens: haec praemia, qui me Ferro ausi tentare, ferunt: sic moenia condunt. This note is so full of just criticism on so many passages of our author, that it's length does not want any excuse.Thou then be first, replies the chief, to go With these sad tidings to his ghost below; Begone—acquaint him with my crimes in Troy, And tell my sire of his degenerate boy. Die then: he said, and dragg'd the monarch on, Thro' the warm blood that issu'd from his son, Stagg'ring and sliding in the slipp'ry gore, And to the shrine the royal victim bore; Lock'd in the left he grasps the silver hairs, High in the right the flaming blade he rears, Then to the hilt with all his force apply'd, He plung'd the ruthless fau'chion in his side. 745. Such was the fate,] There is a passage in Dr. Trapp's poetical lectures, where that judicious critic compares the chast manner of Virgil's writing with the false and frivolous conceits and witticisms of Seneca and Ovid; and he produces this passage of Virgil as an instance. In Troade Senecae, Hecuba dolens quod Trojae excidio, Priami jaceret inhumatum cadaver, luctum suum sic exprimit: Ille tot regum parens Caret sepulchro Priamus, et flammâ indiget, Ardente Trojâ ? Et eodem modo alius; ? Priamumque in littore truncum, Cui non Troja rogus. ? Quid frigidius in materiâ tam grandi et sublimi? Quam leve istud dictum flammâ funebri caruisse Priamum, cum Troja flammis nimium abundaret? Quanto melius de re eadem Virgilius! Haec finis Priami—Grandia sunt omnia; majestatis plena et argumento congruentia; noluit poeta in re tam seriâ et magnificâ exiguis facetiis ludere. Such was the fate unhappy Priam found, Who saw his Troy lie levell'd with the ground; He, who round Asia sent his high commands, And stretch'd his empire o'er a hundred lands; Now lies a headless carcass on the shore, The man, the monarch, and the name more! Then, nor till then, I fear'd the furious foe, Struck with that scene of unexampled woe; Soon as I saw the murder'd king expire; 754. Old compeer,] This circumstance of his being put in mind of his father and family by seeing the lamentable death of old Priam, is very natural and moving. The distress is now work'd up to the heighth. Æneas is left alone amid all the dangers that surrounded him.His old compeer, my venerable sire, My palace, son, and consort left behind, All, all, at once came rushing on my mind. I gaz'd around, but not a friend was there; My hapless friends, abandon'd to despair, Had leap'd down headlong from the lofty spires, Tir'd with their toils; or plung'd amidst the fires. 761. Thus left alone,] Varius and Tucca, who were appointed to revise the Æneid, are said to have struck out the twenty two following verses in the original, as containing some inconsistencies relating to Helen's flight, and some expressions not agreeable to the purity of Virgil's style. Catrou is for retrenching them, but Dr. Trapp has defended them at large, and thinks they deserve to stand in their place. See Addison's travels, p. 425–6.Thus left alone, and wand'ring, I survey Where trembling Helen close and silent lay In Vesta's porch; and by the dismal glare Of rolling flames discern the fatal fair; The common plague! by Troy and Greece abhor'd! She fear'd alike the vengeful Trojan sword, Her injur'd country, and abandon'd lord. Fast by the shrine I spy'd the lurking dame, And all my soul was kindled into flame; My ruin'd country to revenge, I stood In wrath resolv'd to shed her impious blood. Shall she, this guilty fair, return in peace, A queen, triumphant, through the realms of Greece, And see, attended by her Phrygian train, Her home, her parents, spouse, and sons again? For her curst cause shall raging flames destroy The stately structures of imperial Troy? 778. Drench the Dardan shore,] In the original, sudârit sanguine tellus, is very strong, and is censured by some critics; but Virgil had Ennius's authority for it, from whom he has borrow'd many expressions of great force and energy: ? Æs sonat, Franguntur hastae, terra sudat sanguine.So many slaughters drench the Dardan shore? And Priam's self lie welt'ring in his gore? No!—she shall die—for tho' the victor gain No fame, no triumph for a woman slain; Yet if by just revenge the traitress bleed, The world consenting will applaud the deed: To my own vengeance I devote her head, And the great spirits of our heroes dead. 786. I saw my mother rise,] With what pomp and majesty has the poet introduced this piece of machinery! at the same time, how great is his art and judgment in bringing in Venus to make Æneas desist from any farther attempts in endeavouring to save the city! nothing but the appearance of this goddess, who plainly shews him the deities that are engaged in destroying Troy, could make Æneas forsake the fight.Thus while I rav'd, I saw my mother rise, Confess'd a goddess, to my wond'ring eyes, In pomp unusual, and divinely bright; Her beamy glories pierc'd the shades of night; Such she appear'd, as when in heav'n's abodes She shines in all her glories to the gods. Just rais'd to strike, my hand she gently took, Then from her rosy lips the goddess spoke. What wrath so fierce to vengeance drives thee on? Are we no objects of thy care, my son? Think of Anchises, and his helpless age, Thy hoary sire expos'd to hostile rage; Think if thy dear Creüsa yet survive, Think if thy child, the young Iülus live; Whom, ever hov'ring round, the Greeks inclose, From every side endanger'd by the foes; And, but my care withstood, the ruthless sword Long since had slaughter'd, or the flames devour'd. Nor beauteous Helen now, nor Paris blame, Her guilty charms, or his unhappy flame; The gods, my son, th'immortal gods destroy This glorious empire, and the tow'rs of Troy. Hence then retire, retire without delay, Attend thy mother, and her words obey; Look up, for lo! I clear thy clouded eye From the thick midst of dim mortality; Where yon' rude piles of shatter'd ramparts rise, Stone rent from stone, in dreadful ruin lies, And black with rolling smoke the dusty whirlwind flies: 815. There Neptune's trident] This imagery is prodigiously sublime; the thought of Venus's clearing his eye, and shewing him the Gods at work in destroying the city, is nobly conceived. I apprehend this to be one of the sublimest passages in Virgil's writings, and indeed it is comparable to any thing in Homer, the greatest commendation that can be given it. The hint seems to have been given by Homer, Iliad V. 127. And this passage has been imitated by Milton, book xi. 411. and by Tasso, Canto xviii. Stanza 93.There, Neptune's trident breaks the bulwarks down, There, from her basis heaves the trembling town; 817. Heaven's awful queen, &amp;c.] In the ancient gems and marbles the Juno Matrona is always represented in a modest and decent dress; as the Juno Regina, and the Juno Moneta, are always in a fine and more magnificent one: Yet when one has formed an idea of Juno, either from the simplicity of the one, or the magnificence of the others, one is still at a loss what to make of Virgil's account of her arms and military chariot in the first Æneid (ver. 17.) or of that angry and warlike figure he has given of her in this passage. At my first considering these warlike descriptions of Juno in Virgil, I saw they did not agree with the most established characters of that goddess among the Romans: I therefore thought, for some time, that Virgil took a good deal of liberty in cases of this nature, and that these were to be reckoned among his negligences. But on a more careful review, I found the fault was in myself; and that Virgil in both those places intended to speak of Juno, not according to the appearances she used to make among the Romans, but according to the representations of her in other countries. In the first he certainly speaks of the Carthaginian Juno; and in the second, of the Juno Argiva; or, at least, some particular Juno of the Greeks. It should, by the rules of propriety, be some Grecian Juno, or other; because she is assisting the Greeks, to overturn the empire of the Asiatics. One of the most celebrated among the Grecian Juno's was the Juno Argiva. She was worshiped under the name even in Italy; and Ovid has a long description of a procession to her at Falisci lib. iii. El. 13. Helenus had ordered the Romans, by Æneas, to worship Juno most particularly, to get her over to their party. Virgil Æn. iii. ver 433–439. They did so, and thought that, in time, she came to prefer them to all her most favourite nations, Ovid's Fast. lvi. ver. 45–48. Polymetis, p. 56.Heav'ns awful queen, to urge the Trojan fate, Here storms tremendous at the Scæan gate; Radiant in arms the furious goddess stands, And from the navy calls her Argive bands. On yon' high tow'r the martial maid behold, With her dread Gorgon blaze in clouds of gold. Great Jove himself the sons of Greece inspires, Each arm he strengthens, and each soul he fires. Against the Trojans, from the bright abodes, See! where the thund'rer calls th'embattled gods. Strive then no more with heav'n;—but oh! retreat, Ourself will guide thee to thy father's seat; Ourself will cover and befriend thy flight. She said, and sunk within the shades of night; And lo! the gods with dreadful faces frown'd, And lower'd, majestically stern, around. Then fell proud Ilion's bulwarks, tow'rs and spires; Then Troy, tho' rais'd by Neptune, sunk in fires. 835. So when an aged ash] This simile is copied from Homer, whose great advocate Macrobius, gives the preference in this instance to Virgil. The translator has done it justice, and we venture to affirm it has lost no one beauty under his hands. The last line, is an eminent instance of the sound's being an echo to the sense: as is the fourth line The tall tree trembling ? of a beauty in style much admired, called, the alliteration, or beginning many words that are placed together with the same letter: Waller thought this a beauty, and Dryden was extremely fond of it. Some late writers under the notion of imitating these two great versifiers in this point, run into downright affectation, and are guilty of the most improper and ridiculous expressions, provided there be but an alliteration. 'Tis observable, that there are many instances of this beauty of style in Lucretius, such are, Verbera ventorum vitare ? Et murmura magna minarum: but a most charming instance of it is in another passage of this fine old poet, in a line the most soft and smooth imaginable, where speaking of swans, he says, Et liquidam tollunt lugubri voce querelam. Lib. iv. 552. A reader of a musical ear will easily perceive the beauty of so many of the letter L concurring. 'Tis very remarkable, that the affectation of this beauty is ridiculed by Shakespear, in his Love's Labours Lost, act ii. where the pedant Holofernes says, I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility. The praiseful princess pierc'd and prickt— 'Tis ridiculed too in Chaucer, in a passage which I believe not every reader understands. The Plowman's tale is written, in some measure, in imitation of Piers Plowman's visions, and runs chiefly upon some one letter, or at least many stanzas have this affected iteration, as A full sterne streif is stirrid now ? For some be grete grown on grounde ? When the parson therefore in his order comes to tell his tale, which reflected on the clergy, he says, ? I am a southern man, I cannot jest, rum, ram, ruf, by letter, And God wote, rime hold I but little better. Upton's letter concerning Spenser, p. 27.So when an aged ash, whose honours rise From some steep mountain tow'ring to the skies, With many an ax by shouting swains is ply'd, Fierce they repeat the strokes from every side; The tall tree trembling, as the blows go round, Bows the high head, and nods to every wound: At last quite vanquish'd, with a dreadful peal, In one loud groan rolls crashing down the vale, Headlong with half the shatter'd mountain flies, And stretch'd out huge in length th'unmeasur'd ruin lies. Now, by the goddess led, I bend my way, Tho' javelins hiss, and flames around me play; With sloping spires the flames obliquely fly, The glancing darts turn innocently by. Soon as, these various dangers past, I come Within my rev'rend father's antient dome, Whom first I sought, to bear his helpless age Safe o'er the mountains, far from hostile rage; An exil'd life disdaining to enjoy, He stands determin'd to expire with Troy: Fly you, who health, and youth, and strength maintain, You, whose warm blood beats high in every vein; For me had heav'n decreed a longer date, Heav'n had preserv'd for me the Dardan state; Too much of life already have I known, To see my country's fall prevent my own; Think then, this aged corse with Ilion fell, And take, oh! take your solemn last farewell: For death—these hands that office yet can do; If not—I'll beg it from the pitying foe. At least the soldier for my spoils will come; Nor heed I now the honours of a tomb. Grown to my friends an useless heavy load, Long have I liv'd, abhorr'd by every god, Since, in his wrath, high heaven's almighty sire Blasted these limbs with his avenging fire. Thus he; and obstinately bent appears: 872. The mournful family] The pathetic was never perhaps carried farther than in this moving passage. Old Anchises, in the utmost despair, resolving to die on the spot, and thinking it impossible to try to escape, Creusa and Iülus, and Æneas, all standing about him, and persuading him to fly, to whose advice he continues inflexible, are most striking circumstances. This would have been a finer subject for Le Brun, than Darius's tent.The mournful family stand round in tears. Myself, my shrieking wife, my weeping son, Friends, servants, all, intreat him to be gone, Nor to the general ruin add his own; Bid him be reconcil'd to life once more, Nor urge a fate, that flew too swift before. Unmov'd, he still determines to maintain His cruel purpose, and we plead in vain. Once more I hurry to the dire alarms, To end a miserable life in arms; For oh! what measures could I now pursue, When death, and only death, was left in view: To fly the foe, and leave your age alone, Could such a sire propose to such a son? If 'tis by your's and heav'n's high will decreed, That you, and all, with hapless Troy, must bleed: If not her least remains you deign to save; Behold! the door lies open to the grave. Pyrrhus will soon be here, all cover'd o'er And red from venerable Priam's gore; Who stab'd the son before the father's view, Then at the shrine the royal father slew. Why, heavenly mother! did thy guardian care Snatch me from fires, and shield me in the war? Within these walls to see the Grecians roam, And purple slaughter stride around the dome; To see my murder'd consort, son, and sire, Steep'd in each other's blood, on heaps expire! Arms! arms! my friends, with speed my arms supply, 'Tis our last hour, and summons us to die; 902. My arms!] Whoever attentively considers this animated passage, cannot surely think, that either Æneas or Virgil wants spirit and fire.My arms!—in vain you hold me,—let me go— Give, give me back this moment to the foe. 'Tis well—we will not tamely perish all, But die reveng'd, and triumph in our fall. Now rushing forth, in radiant arms, I wield The sword once more, and gripe the pond'rous shield: When, at the door, my weeping spouse I meet, The fair Creüsa, who embrac'd my feet, And clinging round them, with distraction wild, 911. Reach'd to my arms my dear unhappy child, And oh! she cries— This short speech of Creusa is very moving, and her holding out the little Iülus to his father, is a most tender circumstance. None of the poets (says the excellent Mr. Addison) have touched this passion of grief like Virgil: the generality of other writers, when they attempt to move their readers, offend in this point, that they are too prolix in spinning out their complaints, and think their flood of tears inexhaustible; or else, while they labour to express the greatness of their genius, in the profuseness of their verse, rather raise our admiration at the flowing of their numbers, than excite our pity at the catastrophe of their story. Virgil has carefully avoided both these extremes, and dresses his images of sorrow in their native simplicity; and wherever he touches upon the pathetic, he does it, with a masterly quickness. The declamatory writers of long speeches in tragedy, uttered by persons in deep distress, should consider a little this practice of our judicious poet.Reach'd to my arms my dear unhappy child: And oh! she cries, if bent on death thou run, Take, take with thee, thy wretched wife and son; Or, if one glimmering hope from arms appear, Defend these walls, and try thy valour here; Ah! who shall guard thy sire, when thou art slain, Thy child, or me, thy consort once in vain? Thus while she raves, the vaulted dome replies To her loud shrieks, and agonizing cries. V. 920. It is certain (says Catrou) that Virgil borrowed this event from the Roman history; for a flame appeared upon the head of Servius Tullius, according to the relations of Pliny and Plutarch, whilst he was yet an infant. It was conjectured by that incident, that he would be a king. Anchises, skilled in auguries, judged, by the same prognostic, that a kingdom was promised to his grandson.When lo! a wond'rous prodigy appears, For while each parent kiss'd the boy with tears, Sudden a circling flame was seen to spread With beams refulgent round Iülus' head; Then on his locks the lambent glory preys, And harmless fires around his temples blaze. Trembling and pale we quench with busy care The sacred fires, and shake his flaming hair. But old Anchises lifts his joyful eyes, His hands and voice, in transport, to the skies. Almighty Jove! in glory thron'd on high, This once regards us with a gracious eye; If e'er our vows deserv'd thy aid divine, Vouchsafe thy succour, and confirm thy sign. Scarce had he spoke, when sudden from the pole, Full on the left, the happy thunders roll; A star shot sweeping through the shades of night, And drew behind a radiant trail of light, That o'er the palace, gliding from above, To point our way, descends in Ida's grove; Then left a long continu'd stream in view, The track still glittering where the glory flew. The flame past gleaming with a bluish glare, And smokes of sulphur fill the tainted air. At this convinc'd, arose my reverend sire, Address'd the gods, and hail'd the sacred fire. Proceed, my friends, no longer I delay, But instant follow where you lead the way. Ye gods, by these your omens, you ordain That from the womb of fate shall rise again, To light and life, a glorious second Troy; Then save this house, and this auspicious boy; Convinc'd by omens so divinely bright, I go, my son, companion of thy flight. Thus he—and nearer now in curling spires Through the long walls roll'd on the roaring fires. Haste then, my sire, I cry'd, my neck ascend, With joy beneath your sacred load I bend; Together will we share, where-e'er I go, One common welfare, or one common woe. Ourself with care will young Iülus lead; At safer distance you my spouse succeed; Heed too these orders, ye attendant train; Without the wall stands Ceres' vacant fane, Rais'd on a mount; an aged cypress near, Preserv'd for ages with religious fear; Thither, from different roads assembling, come, And meet embody'd at the sacred dome: 968. Thou, thou, my sire, our gods and relicks bear—] As the not taking the true scope of the Æneid has occasioned mistakes to Virgil's disadvantage, concerning the plan and conduct of the poem; so hath it likewise concerning the characters. The piety of Æneas, and his high veneration for the gods, so much offends a celebrated French writer, (Monsieur de St. Evremont) that he says, “the hero was “fitter to found a religion than a monarchy.” But he did not know, that the image of a perfect lawgiver is held out to us in Æneas; and had he known that he had perhaps been ignorant, that it was the office of such, to found religions and colleges of priests, as well as states and corporations. And that Virgil tells us this was his, ? Dum conderet urbem Inferretque Deos latio. ? Warburton's Divine Legation, book ii. sect. 4. The reader is desired to bear this excellent observation in his mind, which will serve to clear up a variety of passages and incidents throughout the poem; and for want of attending to which, Virgil's aim and meaning have been frequently misinterpreted and misunderstood.Thou, thou, my sire, our gods and relicks bear; These hands, yet horrid with the stains of war, Refrain their touch unhallow'd till the day, When the pure stream shall wash the guilt away. Now, with a lion's spoils bespread, I take My sire, a pleasing burthen, on my back; Close clinging to my hand, and pressing nigh, With steps unequal trip'd Iülus by; Behind, my lov'd Creüsa took her way; Through every lonely dark recess we stray: And I, who late th' embattled Greeks could dare, Their flying darts, and whole embody'd war, Now take alarm, while horrors reign around, 981. At every breeze,] Fulvius Ursinus has observed that Virgil had in his eye this verse of Sophocles, ?????? ??? ??? ?? ????????? ?????. There is likewise a fine fragment of Turpilius in a play called Leucadia to this purpose: Miseram terrent me omnia, maris sonitus, scopuli, Et solitudo, et sanctitudo Apollinis. After Mackbeth has murdered the king he exclaims, How is't with me, when ev'ry noise appalls me! See Dr. Theobald's second book of Virgil.At every breeze, and start at every sound. With fancy'd fears my busy thoughts were wild For my dear father, and endanger'd child. Now, to the city gates approaching near, I seem the sound of trampling feet to hear. Alarm'd my sire look'd forward thro' the shade, 987. And fly, my son, they come,] This sudden fear and exclamation of his father puts Æneas into a hurry and agitation and therefore makes his escape thro' devious paths very natural; and for the same reason, the losing Creusa very probableAnd, fly my son, they come, they come, he said; Lo! from their shields I see the splendors stream; And ken distinct the helmet's fiery gleam. And here, some envious god, in this dismay, This sudden terror, snatch'd my sense away. For while o'er devious paths I wildly trod, Studious to wander from the beaten road; 994. I lost my dear Creüsa,] The address of Virgil in the contrivance of this incident is admirable. For had not Æneas been supposed to traverse back thro' the ruins of Troy in quest of his wife, we must necessarily have lost the narrative of many thing, that happened in that dreadful night, which he neither could have seen, nor had any knowledge of; as, the pillaging of the palaces and temples, the number of Trojans that were made captives, and the very burning of his own house. Segrais. 994. I lost] Some have imputed it as a fault, it seems, to Æneas, that he took no more care of his wife: But Æneas charges himself with the care of his old father, and infant son, as the most weak and helpless persons; and he cautions his wife to follow him, so as neither to be at his heels, nor yet to quit sight of him; that their flight may be the more easily disguised, and that he might the more easily succour her upon occasion: She is lost, because he could not foresee the misfortune, nor look behind him, incumber'd as he was with his father on his shoulders. Virgil has taken care to prevent the objection, by that great judgment, which he shews upon every emergency. It cannot be inferr'd, that Æneas preferr'd his father to his wife, thro' a want of affection to her: That is answer'd by the great care which he takes to recover her; and the great dangers, which he runs thro', to that end. It is, besides, a fine stroke of art in the poet, to make her say, that her loss, or death, is not without the appointment of the Gods. It was destin'd to Æneas, to go to Italy, and there to marry Lavinia: (for by this alliance the Romans were to descend from the Trojans:) and therefore if Creusa had not been properly disposed of, she must of consequence have been a bar to that match. Segrais.I lost my dear Creüsa, nor can tell From that sad moment, if by fate she fell; Or sunk fatigu'd; or straggled from the train; But ah! she never blest these eyes again! Nor, till to Ceres' antient wall we came, Did I suspect her lost, nor miss the dame. There all the train assembled, all but she, Lost to her friends, her father, son, and me. What men, what gods did my wild fury spare? At both I rav'd, and madden'd with despair. In Troy's last ruins did I ever know A scene so cruel! such transcendent woe! Our gods, my son, and father to the train I next commend, and hide them in the plain; Then fly for Troy, and shine in arms again. Resolv'd the burning town to wander o'er, And tempt the dangers that I scap'd before. Now to the gate I run with furious haste, Whence first from Ilion to the plain I past; Dart round my eyes in every place in vain. And tread my former footsteps o'er again. Surrounding horrors all my soul affright; And more, the dreadful silence of the night. Next to my house I flew without delay, 1018. If there, if] Si forte pedem, si forte tulisset. That repetition, expressive of doubt and uncertainty is very elegant, says Dr. Trapp. Mr. Pitt has endeavoured to preserve this beauty.If there, if haply there she bent her way. In vain—the conquering foes were enter'd there; High, o'er the dome, the flames emblaze the air; Fierce to devour, the fiery tempest flies, Swells in the wind, and thunders to the skies. Back to th'embattled citadel I ran, And search'd her father's regal walls in vain. Ulysses now and Phœnix I survey, Who guard, in Juno's fane, the gather'd prey: In one huge heap the Trojan wealth was roll'd, Refulgent robes, and bowls of massy gold; A pile of tables on the pavement nods, Snatch'd from the blazing temples of the gods. A mighty train of shrieking mothers bound, Stood with their captive children trembling round. Yet more—I boldly raise my voice on high, 1034. And in the shade on dear Creüsa cry,) The grief and distress with which Æneas says he was o'erwhelmed, at the loss of his wife, his care and diligence in searching for her, and his venturing back again, alone and unassisted, into the thickest of the enemy, to find her; were all a plain indication of his great tenderness, sensibility, and conjugal affection; and as such, must needs make a very deep impression on Dido's Heart. Profecto, me horror capit atque etiam quatit, ubi videre, atque audire videor, in nocte, inter hostes, fortem simul atque pium virum, etiam clamore carissimam uxorem quaerere. Scaliger. Si sic ? omnia dixisset!And in the shade on dear Creüsa cry; Call on her name a thousand times in vain, But still repeat the darling name again. Thus while I rave and roll my searching eyes, 1038. I saw her shade arise,] This machine of Creusa's ghost is judiciously introduced. There was a dignus vindice nodus. No other expedient could be found to stop the further search of Æneas for his wife, and let him return again to rejoin his friends in their expedition.Solemn and slow I saw her shade arise, The form enlarg'd majestic mov'd along; Fear rais'd my hair, and horror chain'd my tongue; Thus as I stood amaz'd, the heav'nly fair With these mild accents sooth'd my fierce despair. Why with excess of sorrow raves in vain My dearest Lord, at what the gods ordain? Oh! could I share thy toils!—but fate denies; And Jove, dread Jove, the sov'reign of the skies. In long, long exile, art thou doom'd to sweep Seas after seas, and plow the watry deep. Hesperia shall be thine, where Tyber glides Thro' fruitful realms, and rolls in easy tides. There shall thy fates a happier lot provide, 1052. And a royal bride,] Æneas relating this prophecy of his wife to Dido, thereby informs her, that he was reserved by destiny for the bed of Lavinia: and so inforces the reasons of his obligation to quit Carthage. Dido therefore betrays herself by an indiscreet passion, and is not betray'd by any perfidy of Æneas. Segrais.A glorious empire, and a royal bride. Then let your sorrows for Creüsa cease; For know, I never shall be led to Greece; 1055. Captive's shame,] Slavery was deemed the greatest of miseries by the ancients. Andromache, to persuade Hector from going to the field of battle in the Iliad, tells him that if he should be slain, she should be made a captive by the Grecians; as the most powerful motive she could think of, to detain him in the city.Nor feel the victor's chain, nor captive's shame, A slave to some imperious Argive dame. No!—born a princess, sprung from heav'n above, Ally'd to Venus, and deriv'd from Jove, Sacred from Greece, 'tis mine, in these abodes, To serve the glorious mother of the gods. Farewell; and to our son thy care approve, 1062. Our son,] Thus Alcestes in Euripides, just upon the point of death, ?????? ?????? ?? ???? ?????? ?? ??? ????? ????? ???? ???? ????? ???????.Our son, the pledge of our commutual love. Thus she; and as I wept, and wish'd to say Ten thousand things, dissolv'd in air away. Thrice round her neck my eager arms I threw; Thrice from my empty arms the phantom flew, Swift as the wind, with momentary flight, Swift as a fleeting vision of the night. Now, day approaching, to my longing train, From ruin'd Ilion I return again; To whom, with wonder and surprize, I find A mighty crowd of new companions join'd; 1073. A host of willing exiles,] The poet by this circumstance signifies how greatly Æneas was belov'd by the Trojans, and the weight and importance of his character.A host of willing exiles round me stand, Matrons, and men, a miserable band; Eager the wretches pour from every side, To share my fortunes on the foamy tide; 1077. Arm'd,] Opious (in the original) may mean arms, or conveniencies, or necessaries for their intended expedition, Catrou says that by velim deducere(v. 800 in the original) is implied that they elected Æneas their king and leader, after the manner of ancient times.Valiant, and arm'd, my conduct they implore, To lead and fix them on some foreign shore: And now, o'er Ida with an early ray Flames the bright star, that leads the golden day. No hopes of aid in view, and every gate Possest by Greece, at length I yield to fate. Safe o'er the hill my father I convey. 1084. And bear the venerable load away.] This instance of filial piety, a great prince and hero's bearing his old feeble father on his shoulders, is highly pleasing. A modern leader or general would never submit to so laborious a task, but would order their servants or soldiers to undertake it.And bear the venerable load away. The End of the Second Book. THE THIRD BOOK IT is the opinion of the judicious M. de Segrais, that this book is the fullest of matter of any in the whole Æneid, and that it contains almost the whole Odyssey. What Æneas here relates, contains the space of seven years: whereas (except the fourth book which describes all that passed after Æneas arrived at Carthage till he left that city) each of all the other books contain but a few days. This book is very learned for its geography, and for the description of the manners of the people, in which Virgil shews great knowledge and exactness. Those different nations where he makes his hero land, the adventure of the Harpies, which is an allegory of bad women (or as some say) of the remorse of conscience succeeding bad actions; the adventure of the Cyclops, which is an image of men whom cruelty, gluttony, and drunkenness, have brutalized; all these serve excellently to teach us how a wise man ought to conduct himself in the dangers and perils to which human life is exposed. This great abundance of matter is adorned and set off with great eloquence, and there are as many fine passages as in any other book where the poet is so much extolled: nevertheless, this book is one of those, and I believe the very one, of the whole Æneid which is least read and admired. This neglect, I believe, is as much owing to the disadvantage of its situation as to any other reason; for the second book, which immediately precedes it, containing the destruction and burning of Troy, presents so great an object to the reader, that he disdains the third: and the fourth is so charming and interesting by the tenderness and passion which it contains, that one has naturally an impatience to read it. Thus, as it is enough to know, that after the taking of Troy, Æneas arrived at Carthage; this third book is often passed over intirely, or if the reader runs over its argument and contents cursorily, yet he disdains to study it so attentively as the others; nevertheless, it is in this book, (next to the sixth) that there is more to be learnt than in the whole Æneid, as well from this ancient chart, which is very exact, as from the different pictures of civil life, and from those fine monuments of the ancient religious customs, which are not to be found elsewhere. Thus, what appears to be admirable in this great work, is, that every thing in it is beautiful, but nothing alike. See Segrais's Remarks on the third book. The ARGUMENT. Æneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the fleet in which he sailed, and the success of his first voyage to Thrace; from thence he directs his course to Delos, and asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his habitation? by a mistake of the oracle's answer, he settles in Crete; his houshold gods give him the true sense of the oracle in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy: he is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprizing adventures, till at length he lands on Sicily; where his father Anchises dies. This is the place which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose, and threw him upon the Carthaginian coast. When heav'n destroy'd, by too severe a fate, The throne of Priam, and the Phrygian state, When Troy, tho' Neptune rais'd her bulwarks round, The pride of Asia, smok'd upon the ground; We sought in vacant regions new abodes, Call'd by the guiding omens of the gods. Secret, a sudden navy we provide, Beneath Antandros, and the hills of Ide. Doubtful, where heav'n would fix our wand'ring train, Our gather'd pow'rs prepare to plow the main. Scarce had the summer shot a genial ray; My sire commands the canvas to display, And steer wherever fate should point the way. With tears I leave the port, my native shore, And those dear fields, where Ilion rose before. An exil'd wretch, I lead into the floods My son, my friends, and all my vanquish'd gods. The warlike Thracians till a boundless plain, Sacred to Mars, Lycurgus' antient reign; Ally'd to Troy, while fortune own'd her cause; The same their gods and hospitable laws; Thither, with fates averse, my course I bore, And rais'd a town amid the winding shore. Then from my name the rising city call, And stretch along the strand th'embattled wall. Here to my mother, and the favouring gods, I offer'd victims by the rolling floods; But slew a stately bull to mighty Jove, Who reigns the sovereign of the pow'rs above. Rais'd on a mount, a cornel grove was nigh, And with thick branches stood a myrtle by. With verdant boughs to shade my altars round, I came, and try'd to rend them from the ground. 34. When lo! a horrid prodigy] If there be any instance (says Mr. Addison) in the Æneid, liable to exception, it is in the beginning of the third book, where Æneas is represented as tearing up the myrtle that dropped blood. This circumstance seems to have the marvellous without the probable, because it is represented as proceeding from natural causes, without the interposition of any god, or rather supernatural power, capable of producing it. Mr. Warburton's answer to this objection is admirable: “When this amiable writer, says he, made this remark, he appears not to have recollected what Æneas says on the occasion: ? Nymphas venerabar agrestes, Gradivumque patrem, Geticis qui praesidet arvis, Rite secundarent visus, omenque levarent. Now these kind of omens, for there were two sorts, were always supposed to be produced by the intervention of a supernatural power; as was the raining of blood so frequently related by the Roman annalists. And the poet was certainly within the bounds of the probable, while he told no more than what the gravest historians recorded in every page of their annals. But this was not done to make us stare He is, as we observe, in a legislative capacity, and writes to possess the people of the interposition of the gods, in omens and prodigies; which was in the method of the old lawgivers. So Plutarch tells us, that with divinations and omens, Lycurgus sanctified the Lacedemonians, Numa the Romans, Ion the Athenians, and Deucalion all the Greeks in general; and by hopes and fears kept up in them the awe and reverence of religion. The scene of this adventure is laid, with the utmost propriety on the uncivilized inhospitable shores of Thrace, to inspire horror for barbarous manners, and an inclination and appetite for civil policy.” Divine Legation, book ii. sect. 4. This marvellous story was particularly pleasing to the wild imaginations of the Italian poets: Tasso has closely imitated it, book xiii. stanza 41, &amp;c. And Ariosto, in the transformation of Astolfo; from whom their disciple Spenser hath copied it, canto ii. stanza 30. of the Fairy Queen.When lo! a horrid prodigy I see; For scarce my hands had wrench'd the rooted tree, When, from the fibres, drops of crimson gore Ran trickling down, and stain'd the sable shore. Amaz'd, I shook with horror and affright, My blood all curdled at the dreadful sight; Curious the latent causes to explore, With trembling hands a second plant I tore; That second wounded plant distill'd around Red drops of blood, and sprinkled all the ground. Rack'd with a thousand fears, devout I bow'd To every nymph, and Thracia's guardian god. These omens to avert by pow'r divine, And kindly grant a more auspicious sign. But when once more we tug'd with toiling hands, And eager bent my knees against the sands; Live I to speake it?—from the tomb I hear 51. A hollow groan,] The only way to judge truly of the ancients, in points that are purely ancient; is to imagine ourselves in their places, with the same sort of ideas they had, and the same circumstances of things about us. As we can very seldom do this, we are very often mistaken about them. I cannot say that I approve this passage; but is not the fault in myself? Would it have shock'd me had I been born a Roman, in the time of Augustus, and had read it soon after the Æneid was publish'd? They stock'd every thing with divinities and intelligencies: there was not a river, a lake, a grot, or a grove without them. These were not poetical ornaments, but the real objects of the belief and religion of the common people, and the profess'd religion of the great. When they believ'd every grove, and every tuft of trees, to have some particular divinities belonging to it; it was but one step further to entertain the notion of intelligences vitally annex'd to a tree, which was their receiv'd notion of the Hamadryades. See Bayle, Art. Hamad. These stories of Daphne, Phaeton's sisters, &amp;c. were known stories too, and tolerably well believ'd by the most believing part of mankind, the vulgar. There is even an ambassador in Livy, that treats a consecrated tree in general, as an intelligent being, and as a deity. Tum ex legatis unus abiens, “Et haec (inquit) sacrata quercus, et quicquid deorum est, audiant foedus a vobis ruptum.” Lib. iii. 25. Spence.A hollow groan, that shock'd my trembling ear. How can thy pious hands, Æneas, rend The bury'd body of thy hapless friend? This stream that trickles from the wounded tree Is Trojan blood, and once ally'd to thee. Ah! fly this barbarous land, this guilty shore, Fly, fly the fate of murder'd Polydore. This grove of lances, from my body slain, Now blooms with vegetable life again. Then, as amaz'd in deep suspense I hung, Fear rais'd my hair, and horror chain'd my tongue. Ill-fated Priam, when the Grecian pow'rs With a close siege begirt the Dardan tow'rs, No more confiding in the strength of Troy, Sent to the Thracian prince the hapless boy, With mighty treasures, to support him there, Remov'd from all the dangers of the war. This wretch, when Ilion's better fortunes cease, Clos'd with the proud victorious arms of Greece; Broke thro' all sacred laws, and uncontroll'd Destroy'd his royal charge, to seize the gold. 72. Curs'd gold!] This sententious acclamation is very judiciously placed by the poet, and may exemplify that just and elegant rule of Petronius: Curandum est, ne sententiae emineant extra corpus orationis expressae, sed intexto vestibus colore niteant: Homerus testis, et Lyrici, Romanusque Virgilius. This poet is indeed admirable in the art and propriety of introducing what the critics call sentences, or moral reflections on life and manners: They should be but sparingly introduced in an epic poem; and require great delicacy, and judgment, in the management of them. The absurdities of Lucan in his Pharsalia, and of Seneca in his tragedies, are innumerable in this particular; they are perpetually declaiming; and drag in philosophical reflexions, without any propriety, decorum, or regard to the character of the person speaking. Hecuba, overwhelmed with various misfortunes, utters a great many grave and calm sentences, and fine moral reflections on the instability of all human grandeur and honours, whom the poet had just before represented as utterly distracted with grief, and as almost having lost her reason and understanding. See the Troas of Seneca, Act I. I cannot forbear adding a rule of Bossu. The best remedy to cure these indecencies and improprieties is, to imagine we hear the true persons talking naturally together; and to suppose ourselves in their places, and see what we ourselves would say on such and such an occasion. By this means a man will learn to use sentences seldomer, and to retrench those that being not necessary to raise the idea of what he would represent, are only dress'd up for a show, He will likewise learn to strip a great many thoughts of that pompous air, which forms a general precept out of a trifle. And he will say upon these occasions; I command you to speak; do you obey: and not, like Seneca, He that does not speak when commanded, does not do as we commanded him. Some modern writers that may be named, might profit if they considered this Remark, especially the generality of our tragedy writers.Curs'd gold!—how high will daring mortals rise In ev'ry guilt, to reach the glittering prize? Soon as my soul recover'd from her fears, Before my father and the gather'd peers, I lay the dreadful omens of the gods; All vote at once to fly the dire abodes; To leave th'unhospitable realm behind, And spread our op'ning canvas to the wind. But first we paid the rites to Polydore, And rais'd a mighty tomb amid the shore. Next, to his ghost, adorn'd with cypress boughs And sable wreaths, two solemn altars rose; With lamentable cries and hair unbound, The Trojan dames in order mov'd around. Warm milk and sacred blood in bowls we brought, To lure the spirit with the mingled draught; Compos'd the soul; and, with a dismal knell, Took thrice the melancholy last farewell. Soon as our fleet could trust the smiling sea, And the soft breeze had smooth'd the watry way; Call'd by the whisp'ring gales, we rig the ships, Crowd round the shores, and launch into the deeps. Swift from the port our eager course we ply, And lands and towns roll backward, as we fly. By Doris lov'd, and Ocean's azure god, Lies a fair isle amid th'Ægean flood; Which Phœbus fix'd; for once she wander'd round The shores, and floated on the vast profound. But now unmov'd, the peopled region braves The roaring whirlwinds, and the furious waves. Safe in her open ports the sacred isle Receiv'd us, harrass'd with the naval toil. Our rever'nce due to Phœbus' town we pay, And holy Anius meets us on the way; Anius, whose brows the wreaths and laurels grace, Priest of the god, and sovereign of the place. Well-pleas'd to see our train the shore ascend, He flew to meet my sire, his antient friend: In hospitable guise our hands he prest, Then to the palace led each honour'd guest. To Phœbus' aged temple I repair, And suppliant to the god prefer my pray'r: To wand'ring wretches, who in exile roam, 115. Grant, o Thymbraean God,] The poet makes here no mention of sacrifices or immolations. The reason is, because they never killed any animals on the altars of Delos. Pythagoras, who held the Metempsychosis, made his vows only, says Tully, at the altars of Delos, as these were never stain'd with blood. Catrou.Grant, o Thymbræan god, a settled home; Oh! grant thy suppliants, their long labours past, A race to flourish, and a town to last; Preserve this little second Troy in peace, Snatch'd from Achilles and the sword of Greece; Vouchsafe, great father, some auspicious sign; And oh! inform us with thy light divine, Where lies our way? and what auspicious guide, To foreign realms shall lead us o'er the tide? Sudden, the dire alarm the temple took; The laurels, gates, and lofty mountains shook. Burst with a dreadful roar, the veils display The hallow'd tripods in the face of day. Humbled we fell; then, prostrate on the ground, We hear these accents in an awful sound: Ye valiant sons of Troy, the land that bore Your mighty ancestors to light before, Once more their great descendants shall embrace; Go—seek the ancient mother of your race. 134. When the wide world,] These two lines in the original are translated literally from Homer, Il. xx. 307. except that Virgil says cunctis oris, and Homer ????????? ??????. Hence it is conjectured that Æneas did reality never come into Italy. The learned M. Bochart has supported this opinion in a curious dissertation, added to M. Segrais' translation of Virgil.There the wide world, Æneas' house shall sway, And down from son to son, th'imperial power convey. Thus Phœbus spoke; and joy tumultuous fir'd The thronging crowds; and eager all enquir'd, What realm, what town, his oracles ordain, Where the kind god would fix the wand'ring train? Then in his mind my sire revolving o'er The long, long records of the times before; Learn, ye assembled peers, he cries, from me, The happy realm the laws of fate decree; Fair Crete sublimely tow'rs amid the floods, Proud nurse of Jove, the sovereign of the gods. There antient Ida stands, and thence we trace The first memorials of the Trojan race; A hundred cities the blest isle contains, And boasts a vast extent of fruitful plains. Hence our fam'd ancestor old Teucer bore His course, and gain'd the fair Rhætean shore, There the great chief the seat of empire chose, Before proud Troy's majestic structures rose; Till then, if rightly I record the tale, Our old forefathers till'd the lowly vale. From hence arriv'd the mother of the gods, 157. Hence her loud cymbals,] There is a fine passage in the second book of Lucretius, in which he accounts for the fable of Cybele, and describes her worship at the same time. Hanc veteres Graiûm docti cecinere poetae, Sublimem in currû bijugos agitare leones; Aeris in spatio magnam pendere docentes Tellurem; neque posse in terrâ sistere terram: Adjunxere feras; quia, quamvis effera, proles Officiis debet molliri victa parentûm: Muralique caput summum cinxere coronâ, Eximiis munita locis quod sustinet urbes: Quo nunc insigni per magnas praedita terras Horrifice fertur divinae matris imago. Lib. II. 900. I cannot forbear adding, that the poem of Catullus, who introduces Atys a priest of Cybele struck with madness by this goddess, abounds with some of the strongest strokes of passion, and true poetic enthusiasm, of any thing the Roman poesy has left us.Hence her loud cymbals and her sacred woods: Hence, at her rites religious silence reigns, And lions whirl her chariot o'er the plains. Then fly we speedy where the gods command, Appease the winds, and seek the Cretan land: Nor distant is the shore; if Jove but smile, Three days shall waft us to the blissful isle. This said; he slays the victims due, and loads In haste the smoaking altars of the gods. A bull to Phœbus, and a bull was slain To thee, great Neptune, monarch of the main: A milk white ewe to ev'ry western breeze, A black, to ev'ry storm that sweeps the seas. Now fame reports Idomeneus' retreat, Expell'd and banish'd from the throne of Crete; Free from the foe the vacant region lay: We leave the Delian shore, and plow the watry way. By fruitful Naxos, o'er the flood we fly, 175. Where to the Bacchanals the hills reply,] The translator in this and the following lines hath enlarged a little, (tho' very justifiably) and by adding a few descriptive epithets (glittering rocks appear, clustring islands, &amp;c.) hath given us a beautiful landscape of every different island and country that the navy passed by, and hath convey'd as full images of the whole scene as if we had viewed it from one of Æneas his ships.Where to the Bacchanals the hills reply; By green Donysa next and Paros steer, 177. Where, white in air,] Lord Sandwich said to a gentleman, from whom I had it; “That when he past by the island of Paros, several parts of it look'd as white to him, as the rising grounds about Turin, then covered with snow;” when he was there, in the year 1740.Where, white in air, her glitt'ring rocks appear. Thence through the Cyclades the navy glides, Whose clust'ring islands stud the silver tides. Loud shout the sailors, and to Crete we fly; To Crete our country, was the general cry. Swift shoots the fleet before the driving blast, And on the Cretan shore descends at last. With eager speed I frame a town, and call From antient Pergamus the rising wall. Pleas'd with the name, my Trojans I command To raise strong tow'rs, and settle in the land. Soon as our lusty youth the fleet could moor, And draw the vessels on the sandy shore, Some join the nuptial bands: with busy toil Their fellows plow the new-discover'd soil. To frame impartial laws I bend my cares, Allot the dwellings, and assign the shares. When lo! from standing air and poison'd skies, A suden plague with dire contagion flies. 196. On corn and trees the dreadful pest began,] The progress of this contagion is marked out according to the best philosophical and physical notions.On corn and trees the dreadful pest began; And last the fierce infection seiz'd on man. They breathe their souls in air; or drag with pain Their lives, now lengthen'd out for woes, in vain; Their wonted food the blasted fields deny, And the red dog-star fires the sultry sky. My sire advis'd, to measure back the main, Consult, and beg the Delian god again To end our woes, his succour to display, And to our wand'rings point the certain way. 'Twas night; soft slumbers had the world possest, When, as I lay compos'd in pleasing rest, Those gods I bore from flaming Troy, arise In awful figures to my wond'ring eyes: Close at my couch they stood, divinely bright, 211. And shone distinct, &amp;c.] As to the difficulties of the word insertas applied to fenestras; (in the original) insertas for inseratas according to Servius seems very harsh; and per insertas fenestras, for insertim per fenestras according to La Cerda, is more forced and unnatural than the other. And therefore I like it, with Turnebus, in it's plain literal sense; in which there is no difficulty at all. For what can be more proper, than fenestra inserta parieti? Trapp.And shone distinct by Cynthia's gleaming light, Then, to dispell the cares that rack'd my breast, These words the visionary pow'rs addrest: Those truths the god in Delos would repeat, By us, his envoys, he unfolds in Crete; By us, companions of thy arms and thee, From flaming Ilion o'er the swelling sea. Led by our care, shall thy descendants rise, The world's majestic monarchs, to the skies. Then build thy city for imperial sway, And boldly take the long laborious way. Forsake this region; for the Delian pow'r Assign'd not for thy seat the Gnossian shore. Once by Oenotrians till'd, there lies a place, 'Twas call'd Hesperia by the Grecian race; For martial deeds and fruits renown'd by fame; But since, Italia, from the leader's name. These are the native realms the fates assign; Hence rose the fathers of the Trojan line; The great Iäsius, sprung from heaven above, And antient Dardanus, deriv'd from Jove. Rise then, in haste these joyful tidings bear, These truths unquestion'd to thy father's ear. Begone—the fair Ausonian realms explore, For Jove himself denies the Cretan shore. Struck with the voice divine, and awful sight, No common dream, or vision of the night; I saw the wreaths, their features; and a stream Of trickling sweat ran down from every limb. I started from my bed, and rais'd on high My hands and voice in rapture to the sky. Then (to our gods the due oblations paid) The scene divine before my sire I laid. He owns his error of each antient place, Our two great founders, and the double race. My son, he cry'd, whom adverse fates employ, Oh! exercis'd in all the woes of Troy! Now I reflect, Cassandra's word divine Assign'd these regions to the Dardan line. But who surmiz'd, the sons of Troy should come To fair Hesperia from their distant home? Or who gave credit to Cassandra's strain, Doom'd by the fates to prophesy in vain? Pursue we now a surer, safer road, By Phœbus pointed, and obey the god. Glad we comply, and leave a few behind; Then spread our sails to catch the driving wind; Forsake this realm; the sparkling waves divide, And the swift vessels shoot along the tide. Now vanish'd from our eyes the lessening ground; And all the wide horizon stretching round, Above was sky, beneath was sea profound: 263. When black'ning by degrees,] We have here a description of a second tempest. It is to be observed that it is entirely different from that in the first book. By describing the same subject with new circumstances, the poet admirably displays the fruitfulness of his invention. Catrou, and Segrais.When, black'ning by degrees, a gathering cloud, Charg'd with big storms, frown'd dreadful o'er the flood, And darken'd all the main; the whirlwinds roar, And roll the waves in mountains to the shore. Snatch'd by the furious gust, the vessels keep Their road no more, but scatter o'er the deep: The thunders roll, the forky light'nings fly; And in a burst of rain descends the sky. Far from our course was dash'd the navy wide, And dark we wander o'er the tossing tide. Not skilful Palinure in such a sea, So black with storms, distinguish'd night from day; Nor knew to turn the helm, or point the way. Three nights, without one guiding star in view, Three days, without the sun, the navy flew; The fourth, by dawn, the swelling shores we spy, See the thin smokes, that melt into the sky, And blewish hills just opening on the eye. We furl the sails, with bending oars divide The flashing waves, and sweep the foamy tide. Safe from the storm the Strophades I gain, Incircled by the vast Ionian main, Where dwelt Celæno with her harpy train; Since Boreas' sons had chac'd the direful guests 287. From Phineus palace] Phineus was a king of Thrace; or, as some say, of Arcadia He ordered the eyes of his two sons to be torn out, to satisfy their mother-in law. The gods punished his cruelty; they struck him with blindness, and sent the Harpies to him, which took the meat from his mouth. The Argonauts arrived in his country, and amongst them Zetes and Calaïs, the sons of Boreas. These two winged princes delivered Phineas from the Harpyes, who had almost starv'd him; and pursued them to the Strophades, where they gave over the pursuit. Apollonius has finely enlarged on this fable in his Argonautics, book ii. These Harpyes were called out of hell, and seem'd to have been of the number of the Furies, a permission was given them to dwell on earth, to punish the wicked; by which the poets would represent to us the remorse of a bad conscience. Catrou.From Phineus' palace, and their wonted feasts. But fiends to scourge mankind, so fierce, so fell, Heav'n never summon'd from the depths of hell: Bloated and gorg'd with prey, with wombs obscene, Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean; A virgin face, with wings and hooky claws; Death in their eyes, and famine in their jaws. The port we enter'd, and with joy beheld Huge herds of oxen graze the verdant field, And feeding flocks of goats, without a swain, That range at large, and bound along the plain; We seize, we slay, and to the copious feast Call every god, and Jove himself a guest. Then on the winding shore the tables plac'd, And sate indulging in the rich repast; When from the mountains, terrible to view, 303. The monster Harpyes] The greatest part of the events included in the Æneid, are to be found in Dionysius of Halicarnassus. He mentions with accuracy the course of the navigation of Æneas. He does not omit the fable of the Harpyes, the predictions uttered by Celænus, the eating up of the cakes, &amp;c. As to the metamorphoses of the ships into nymphs, if Dionysius does not mention it, Virgil himself takes care to justify such an absurdity, by telling us, that it was an ancient tradition: Prisca fides facto, sed fama perennis ? If seems that Virgil, ashamed of such a fairy tale, hath a mind to excuse it by the common belief. Many passages in Virgil considered in this view, are entirely vindicated against his critics, whose good sense was misled in that particular, by their inattention. Voltaire on epic poetry, p. 37.On sounding wings the monster Harpyes flew. They taint the banquet with their touch abhorr'd, Or snatch the smoaking viands from the board. A stench offensive follows where they fly, And loud they scream, and raise a dreadful cry. Thence to a cavern'd rock the train remove, And the close shelter of a shady grove; Once more prepare the feast, the tables raise; Once more with fires the loaded altars blaze. Again the fiends from their dark covert fly, But from a different quarter of the sky; With loathsome claws they snatch the food away, Scream o'er our heads, and poison all the prey. Enrag'd, I bid my train their arms prepare, And with the direful monsters wage the war. Close in the grass, observant of the word, They hide the shining shield, and gleaming sword. Then, as the Harpyes from the hills once more Pour'd shrieking down, and crowded round the shore, On his high stand Misenus sounds from far The brazen trump, the signal of the war. With unaccustom'd fight we flew, to slay The forms obscene, dread monsters of the sea. But proof to steel their hides and plumes remain; We strike th'impenetrable fiends in vain, Who from the fragments wing th'aërial way, And leave, involv'd in stench, the mangled prey; All but Celæno;—from a pointed rock Where perch'd she sate, the boding Fury spoke: Then was it not enough, ye sons of Troy, Our flocks to slaughter, and our herds destroy? But war, shall impious war your wrongs maintain, And drive the Harpyes from their native reign? Hear then your dreadful doom with due regard, Which mighty Jove to Phœbus has declar'd; Which Phœbus open'd to Celæno's view, And I, the Furies queen, unfold to you. To promis'd Italy your course you ply, And safe to Italy at length shall fly; But never, never raise your city there, 'Till, in due vengeance for the wrongs we bear, Imperious hunger urge you to devour 345. Those very boards] It was an historical tradition, reported by D of Halicarnassus and Strabo, that Æneas had been warned by the oracle, that they should not be established in Italy till after having been reduced to eat his own tables. Varro relates that Virgil received this prediction in the forest of Dodona. Virgil manages this adventure like a true poet; and he puts this oracle into the mouth of an Harpy. It here makes a fine episode. We shall see by and by the completion of this prophecy, which now detains the mind of the reader in suspence. Catrou.Those very boards on which you fed before. She ceas'd, and fled into the gloomy wood. With hearts dejected my companions stood, And sudden horrors froze their curdling blood. Down drop the shield and spear; from fight we cease, And humbly sue by suppliant vows for peace; And whether goddesses, or fiends from hell, Prostrate before the monstrous forms we fell. But old Anchises, by the beating floods, Invok'd with sacrifice th'immortal gods; And rais'd his hands and voice:—ye pow'rs divine, Avert these woes, and spare a righteous line. Then he commands to cut the cords away; With southern gales we plow the foamy sea. And, where the friendly breeze or pilot guides, With flying sails we stem the murmuring tides. Now, high in view, amid the circling floods We ken Zacynthus crown'd with waving woods. Dulichian coasts, and Samian hills we spy, And proud Neritos tow'ring in the sky. 365. Rough Ithaca we shun, a rocky shore.] To express his contempt of the barrenness of Ithaca, Æneas calls it Scopulos Ithacæ, the rocks of Ithaca; and adds Laërtia regna, as if those fruitless rocks were the boundaries of this kingdom. The terms execramur et saevi Ulysses are very properly applied by the poet, to intimate his hero's detestation of so great an enemy to the Trojans as Ulysses.Rough Ithaca we shun, a rocky shore, And curse the land that dire Ulysses bore. Then dim Leucate swell'd to sight, who shrouds His tall aërial brow in ambient clouds; Last opens, by degrees, Apollo's fane, The dread of sailors on the wintry main. To this small town, fatigu'd with toil, we haste; The circling anchors from the prows are cast. Safe to the land beyond our hopes restor'd, We paid our vows to heaven's almighty lord. All bright in suppling oil, my friends employ Their limbs in wrestling, and revive with joy 377. On Actian shores] Nobilitamus Actium promontorium ludis, &amp;c. says Ruæus; and it may be true, says Dr. Trapp, but I rather take it by way of Hypallage, Celebramus ludos littoribus, &amp;c. especially since the change is so easy and natural. Tho' the literal sense is here sufficient; yet doubtless Virgil had a farther view to the sports afterwards instituted by Augustus, in memory of his victory at Actium.On Actian shores the solemn games of Troy. Pleas'd we reflect that we had pass'd in peace Through foes unnumber'd, and the towns of Greece. Meantime the sun his annual race performs, And blust'ring Boreas fills the sea with storms; I hung the brazen buckler on the door, 383. The warlike Abas] It is difficult to guess who this Abas might be. He seems however to have been a Grecian slain by Æneas in combat, from whom he took his buckler. Æneas fix'd it to the gate of Apollo's temple, with an inscription; and that even in a Grecian city. This was to let the Grecians understand, that there still remained revengers of Troy. We should observe that this inscription, which is only one line, is (after the manner of ancient inscriptions) the most simple and short imaginable.Which once in fight the warlike Abas bore; And thus inscrib'd—these arms with blood distain'd, From conquering Greece the great Æneas gain'd; Then, rous'd at my command, the sailors sweep And dash with bending oars the sparkling deep. Soon had we lost Phæacia's sinking tow'rs, And skimm'd along Epirus' flying shores. On the Chaonian port at length we fall; Thence we ascend to high Buthrotos' wall. Astonish'd here a strange report we found, That Trojan Helenus in Greece was crown'd. The captive prince, (victorious Pyrrhus dead,) At once succeeded to his throne and bed; And fair Andromache, to Troy restor'd, Once more was wedded to a Dardan lord. With eager joy I left the fleet, and went To hail my royal friends, and learn the strange event. Before the walls, within a gloomy wood, 401. Where a new Simoïs] Helenus and Andromache comforted themselves for the loss of Troy, in giving to a river of Epirus, the name of a Trojan river. Catrou.Where a new Simois roll'd his silver flood; 402. By chance Andromache] This unexpected meeting with Andromache has an infinite beauty, and must be very pleasing to the reader: her inexpressible surprize at the sight of the Trojan arms is naturally painted.By chance, Andromache that moment paid The mournful offerings to her Hector's shade. 404. An empty tomb] The bones of Hector were not deposited in this tomb. It was empty, and therefore Virgil styles it, inanem: it was literally what the Latins called monumentum. Catrou. It is probable Catrou might mean Cenotaphium.A tomb, an empty tomb her hands compose Of living turf; and two fair altars rose. Sad scene! that still provok'd the tears she shed; And here the queen invok'd the mighty dead. When lo! as I advanc'd, and drew more nigh, She saw my Trojan arms and ensigns fly; So strange a sight astonish'd to survey, The princess trembles, falls, and faints away. Her beauteous frame the vital warmth forsook, And, scarce recover'd, thus at length she spoke: Ha!—is it true?—in person? and alive? Still, dost thou still, oh! goddess-born, survive? Or, if no more thou breathe the vital air, Where is my lord, my Hector, tell me where? Then, the big sorrow streaming from her eyes, She fill'd the air with agonizing cries. Few words to sooth her raging grief I say, And scarce those few, for sobs, could find their way. Ah! trust your eyes, no phantoms here impose; I live indeed, but drag a life of woes. Say then, oh say, has fortune yet been just To worth like yours, since Hector sunk in dust? Or oh! is that great heroe's consort led 427. To Phyrrhus bed] These words of Æneas would have been a severe reproach, if Andromache had been mistress of her own fortune. Her slavery rendered her marriage with Pyrrhus excusable; notwithstanding which she is still confused, modestly casts her eyes to the ground, and replies with a low voice; not answering his question directly, but breaking out into that passionate exclamation, O felix una, &amp;c. meaning Polyxena, who was sacrificed by the Grecians to appease the ghost of Achilles. Trapp and Catrou.(His dear Andromache) to Pyrrhus' bed? To this, with lowly voice, the fair replies, While on the ground she fixt her streaming eyes: 430. Thrice blest Polyxena] Polyxena the daughter of Priam and Hecuba, was beloved by Achilles; who, when he came to marry her in the temple of Apollo, was treacherously murdered by Paris during the ceremony of the nuptials. After the sacking of Troy, Achilles's ghost appeared, and demanded that Polyxena should be sacrificed to him: she was accordingly slain upon his tomb by Pyrrhus the son of Achilles. The Hecuba of Euripides is founded on this subject; and the description of Polyxena's manner of dying, related by the herald Talthybius in the third act, is very noble.Thrice blest Polyxena! condemn'd to fall By vengeful Greece beneath the Trojan wall; Stab'd at Pelides' tomb the victim bled, To death deliver'd from the victor's bed. Nor lots disgrac'd her with a chain, like me, A wretched captive, drag'd from sea to sea! Doom'd to that hero's haughty heir, I gave A son to Pyrrhus, more than half a slave. From me, to fair Hermione he fled Of Leda's race, and sought a Spartan bed; My slighted charms to Helenus resign'd, And in the bridal bands his captives join'd. But fierce Orestes, by the Furies tost And mad with vengeance for the bride he lost, Swift on the monarch from his ambush flew, 431. At Apollo's] Upon these lines of Virgil, Racine has built the story of one of his best tragedies called Andromache; of which we have a translation, with the addition of some original beauties, in the Distrest Mother; written by Mr. Amb. Phillips. Seneca has a tragedy on the death of Astyanax, stuffed with bombast and unnatural thoughts.And at Apollo's hallow'd altar slew. On Helenus devolv'd (the tyrant slain,) A portion of the realm, a large domain: From Chaon's name the fruitful tract he calls, And from old Pergamus, his growing walls. But oh! what winds, what fates, what gracious pow'rs, Led you, unknowing, to these friendly shores? 452. Does yet Ascanius live] In the original there is an hemistich follows this line. There are many other breaks or half lines in the Æneid, which of itself, exclusive of other proofs, is sufficient to evince that Virgil did not give the last finishing to this poem. There is not one hemistich in the Georgics or Eclogues which he left complete; nor in any other old Latin poem, that I know of. The spirit of correctness and exactness, so remarkable in this poet, would certainly have spread itself, if his death had not prevented it, thro' all his works.Does yet Ascanius live, the hope of Troy? Does his fond mother's death afflict the boy? Or glory's charms his little soul inflame, To match my Hector's or his father's fame? So spoke the queen with mingled sobs and cries, And tears in vain ran trickling from her eyes. 458. The king descends] Bossu judiciously observes, that the reader of a poem is offended, when that is related to him which he already perfectly knows. This was not so great a fault in Homer's time. Virgil is more exact in this particular. Venus in the first book would not hear Æneas make a recital of his misfortunes; she interrupts it to comfort him. And in the third book, when good manners obliged Æneas to relate his story to Andromache, Helenus comes in very opportunely, and so hinders him from going on with his discourse.When lo! in royal pomp the king descends With a long train, and owns his antient friends. Then to the town his welcome guests he led; Tear follow'd tear, at ev'ry word he said. Here in a foreign region I behold A little Troy, an image of the old; Here creeps along a poor penurious stream, That fondly bears Scamander's mighty name: 466. A second Scæan gate I clasp'd with joy.] Those who were going out to banishment, or about to travel into some distant country were wont to embrace the pillars and thresholds of their houses. This they also did at their return. Hence V. Flaccus Arg. b. i.—Patriaeque amplecti limina portae. This custom they practised likewise in the colonies, dependent upon their respective countries.A second Scæan gate I clasp with joy, In dear remembrance of the first in Troy. With me, the monarch bids my friends, and all, Indulge the banquet in the regal hall, Crown'd with rich wine the foamy goblets hold; And the vast feast was serv'd in massy gold. Two days were past, and now the southern gales Call us aboard, and stretch the swelling sails. A thousand doubts distract my anxious breast, And thus the royal prophet I address'd: Oh sacred prince of Troy, to whom 'tis giv'n, To speak events, and search the will of heav'n, The secret mind of Phœbus to declare From laurels, tripods, and from every star; To know the voice of every fowl that flies The signs of every wing that beats the skies; Instruct me, sacred seer; since every god, With each blest omen, bids me plow the flood, To reach fair Italy, and measure o'er A length of ocean to the destin'd shore: The Harpy queen, and she alone, relates A scene of sad unutterable fates, A dreadful famine sent from heaven on high, With all the gather'd vengeance of the sky: Tell me, what dangers I must first oppose, And how o'ercome the mighty weight of woes. Now, the due victims slain, the king implores The grace and favour of th'immortal pow'rs; Unbinds the fillets from his sacred head, Then, by the hand, in solemn state he led His trembling guest to Phœbus' fair abode, Struck with an awful reverence of the god. At length, with all the sacred fury fir'd, Thus spoke the prophet, as the god inspir'd: Since, mighty chief, the deities, your guides, With prosperous omens waft you o'er the tides, Such is the doom of fate, the will of Jove, The firm decree of him who reigns above: Hear me, of many things, explain a few, Your future course with safety to pursue; And, all these foreign floods and countries past, To reach the wish'd Ausonian port at last. The rest the fates from Helenus conceal, And heav'ns dread queen forbids me to reveal. First then, that Italy, that promis'd land, Tho' thy fond hopes already grasp the strand, (Tho' now she seems so near,) a mighty tide, And long, long regions from your reach divide. 514. Plunging oars,] In the original lentandus: i.e. curvandus et flectendus: the oar being lentus, tough, and so made for bending not breaking. See Trapp and Servius.Sicilian seas must bend your plunging oars; Your fleet must coast the fair Ausonian shores, And reach the dreadful isle, the dire abode Where Circe reigns; and stem the Stygian flood, Before your fated city shall ascend. Hear then, and these auspicious signs attend: When, lost in contemplation deep, you find 521. White mother] This circumstance of finding a white sow and her thirty young ones was founded, according to Varro, upon an antient historical tradition. On their account, Alba, which Ascanius built, had its name and origin. There is no fiction either in the geography, or in the antiquities and origin of the nations mentioned in this third book. Virgil had seen with his own eyes, the seas, the islands, the countries, ports, and cities, thro' which his hero passed. For he himself made the very same voyage, that he describes Æneas to have made, on purpose that he might be more exact in his account. Catrou.A large white mother of the bristly kind, With her white brood of thirty young, who drain Her swelling dugs, where Tyber bathes the plain: There, there, thy town shall rise, my godlike friend, And all thy labours find their destin'd end. Fear then Celæno's direful threats no more, That your fierce hunger shall your boards devour. Apollo, when invok'd, will teach the way, And fate the mystic riddle shall display. But these next borders of th'Italian shores, On whose rough rocky sides our ocean roars, Avoid with caution, for the Grecian train Possess those realms that stretch along the main. Here, the fierce Locrians hold their dreadful seat; There, brave Idomeneus, expell'd from Crete, Has fixt his armies on Salentine ground, And awes the wide Calabrian realms around. 538. Here Philoctetes,] Philoctetes was the son of Pæan, and the companion and friend of Hercules, who gave him in his last moments the famous poisoned arrows; but Philoctetes being unfortunately bit by a serpent in his foot, the wound became very offensive to the camp, and the Grecian army thinking the bite was a punishment from the gods, agreed to send Philoctetes into the solitary island of Lemnos. But the oracle afterwards declaring that Troy could not be taken without the arrows of Hercules, he was brought back again by Ulysses and Neoptolemus; and hearing after Troy was taken, of an insurrection, or rather rebellion of the Meliboei; he came into Italy; and either built, or fortified, Petilia with walls. There is a most beautiful tragedy of Sophocles on the subject of Philoctetes's being brought back to the Grecian army by Ulysses: the substance and capital beauties of which, have been translated by Fenelon, and inserted into the fifteenth book of his Telemachus, the last speech of Philoctetes in this tragedy, where he takes leave of his cave and solitary island, is extremely poetical. ????? ? ????????, &amp;c.Here Philoctetes, from Thessalian shores, Rears strong Petilia fenc'd with walls and tow'rs. Soon as transported o'er the rolling floods, You pay due vows in honour of the gods; When on the shore the smoaking altars rise, 543. A purple veil] This veil with which the head was to be covered during sacrifice, was a piece of history of which Virgil hath made a poetical use. Aurelius Victor relates, that Æneas sacrificing on the shore of Italy, suddenly perceived Ulysses and his fleet approaching; and for fear of being known, covered his face with a purple veil. From this adventure, Virgil makes Helenus give Æneas a ceremonial precept, for all his posterity. Such use does the poet make of the least historical circumstances in the life of his hero. Catrou.A purple veil draw cautious o'er your eyes; Lest hostile faces should appear in sight, To blast and discompose the hallow'd rite. Observe this form before the sacred shrine, Thou, and thy friends, and all thy future line. When near Sicilian coasts thy bellying sails At length convey thee with the driving gales; Pelorus' straits just opening by degrees; Turn from the right; avoid the shores and seas. Far to the left thy course in safety keep, And fetch a mighty circle round the deep. That realm of old, a ruin huge! was rent In length of ages from the continent: With force convulsive burst the isle away; Through the dread op'ning broke the thund'ring sea: At once the thund'ring sea Sicilia tore, And sunder'd from the fair Hesperian shore; And still the neighbouring coasts and towns divides With scanty channels, and contracted tides. Fierce to the right tremendous Scylla roars, 563. Charybdis on the left &amp;c.] Virgil has copied this description from the twelfth book of the Odyssey; and I think excells Homer in it. The conoisseurs in painting are curious in observing how different masters acquit themselves in working upon the same subjects. In imitation of them, let us see how far below Virgil Ovid has fallen, in describing Scylla and Charybdis! Quid, quod nescio qui mediis concurrere in undis Dicuntur montes; ratibusque inimica Charybdis Nunc sorbere fretum, nunc reddere, cinctaque saevis Scylla rapax canibus Siculo latrare profundo. How flat and puerile is this in comparison of, Dextrum Scylla latus, laevum impacata Charybdis Obsidet, atque imo barathri ter gurgite vastos Sorbet in abruptum fluctus, rursusque sub auras Erigit alternos, et sidera verberat undâ. Methinks we have been looking on a piece of Michael Angelo's, and one of Verrio's on the same subject. I cannot forbear transcribing Milton's noble and just description of the allegorical figure of Sin, as it has a relation to this passage of Virgil. ? About her middle round A cry of hell-hounds, never ceasing bark'd, With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung A hideous peal: yet when they list, would creep, If ought disturb'd their noise, into her womb And kennel there: yet there still bark'd and howl'd Within, unseen. Far less abhorr'd than these Vex'd Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts Calabria, from the hoarse Trinacrian shore. Par. Lost, book ii. 654. Milton seems to have taken the hint of this famous allegory from these words in St. James's epistle, i. 15. “When Lust hath conceived it bringeth forth Sin, and Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth Death:” Where Lust, and Sin, and Death, are plainly personify'd.Charybdis on the left the flood devours: Thrice swallow'd in her womb, subsides the sea, Deep, deep as hell; and thrice she spouts away From her black bellowing gulphs, disgorg'd on high, Waves after waves, that dash the distant sky. Lodg'd in a darksom cavern's dreadful shade, High o'er the surges Scylla rears her head: Grac'd with a virgin's breast, and female looks, She draws the vessels on the pointed rocks. Below, she lengthens in a monstrous whale, With dogs surrounded, and a dolphin's tail. But oh! 'tis far, far safer with delay Still round and round to plow the watry way, And coast Pachynus, than with curious eyes To see th'enormous den where Scylla lies; The dire tremendous fury to explore, Where, round her cavern'd rocks, her watry monsters roar. Besides, if Helenus the truth inspires, If Phœbus warms me with prophetic fires; One thing in chief, O prince of Venus' strain, Tho' oft repeated, I must urge again. To Juno first with gifts and vows repair, And vanquish heaven's imperial queen with pray'r. So shall your fleets in safety waft you o'er, From fair Trinacria to th'Hesperian shore; There when arriv'd you visit Cuma's tow'rs, Where dark with shady woods Avernus roars, You see the Sibyl in her rocky cave, And hear the furious maid divinely rave. The dark decrees of fate the virgin sings, And writes on leaves, names, characters, and things. The mystic numbers, in the cavern laid, Are rang'd in order by the sacred maid; There they repose in ranks along the floor; At length a casual wind unfolds the door; The casual wind disorders the decrees, And the loose fates are scatter'd by the breeze. She scorns to range them, and again unite The fleeting scrolls, or stop their airy flight. Then back retreat the disappointed train, And curse the Sibyl they consult in vain. But thou more wise, thy purpos'd course delay, Though thy rash friends should summon thee away; And wait with patience, though the flattering gales Sing in thy shrowds, and fill thy opening sails. With suppliant pray'rs intreat her to relate, In vocal accents all thy various fate. Her voice the Italian nations shall declare, And the whole progress of thy future war. Thy numerous toils the prophetess shall show, And how to shun, or suffer every woe. With reverence due, her potent aid implore, So shalt thou safely reach the distant shore: 616. Thus far I tell thee,] Virgil represents the prophet Helenus, as restrain'd in his discoveries of what was to happen to Æneas, in his going from Italy. The great point in which he was thus restrain'd, was Æneas's delay at Carthage; and the danger that arose from it, of his quite breaking off his voyage, and settling in that city. Hence he says afterwards, “If Juno does not prevent it, you shall go from Sicily to Italy.” And 'tis true he did so; but that was after the second time of his being at Sicily: and the whole affair of his being driven to the coast of Afric, and his staying so long at Carthage (which happen'd after his first leaving Sicily) is totally dropt by Helenus. All he tells him is, how he may escape the other dangers in his voyage; and what he is to do, and where to fix, when he is got to Italy. Spence. Prophecies should be rarely introduced into a pöem, because they forestall the events of the action.Thus far I tell thee, but must tell no more. Proceed, brave prince, with courage in thy wars, And raise the Trojan glory to the stars. When thus my fates the royal seer foretold, He sent rich gifts of elephant and gold; Within my navy's sides large treasures stow'd, And brazen cauldrons that refulgent glow'd. To me the monarch gave a shining mail, With many a golden clasp, and golden scale; With this, a beauteous radiant helm, that bore A waving plume; the helm that Pyrrhus wore. My father too with costly gifts he loads, And sailors he supplies to stem the floods, And generous steeds, and arms to all my train, With skilful guides to lead us o'er the main. And now my sire gave orders to unbind The gather'd sails, and catch the rising wind; Whom thus, at parting, the prophetic sage Address'd with all the reverence due to age. 635. Whom Venus led,] Among other gallantries of Venus, it was said she had an affair with Anchises, as he was keeping his sheep on Mount Ida. This adventure is described at large, and in the most glowing colours, in Homer's hymn to Venus. The fable was probably invented (says the Abbe Banier) to cloak some piece of gallantry, and to calm the jealousy of Anchises's wife, who saw him too often frequent the banks of the river Simois, where he was probably smitten with the charms of some sheperdess, who was perhaps denominated Venus on account of her beauty. It would seem that it was that Venus whom Homer makes to have been the daughter of Dione, Il. ix. and who is mentioned by Cicero, De Nat. Deor. l. iii. The poets add, that Venus enjoyned her gallant not to speak of this adventure, but that he not being able to keep the secret, was struck with thunder, by which Servius says he lost his sight; others say, the wound he received thereby, could never be closed up.O favour'd of the skies! whom Venus led To the high honours of her genial bed, Her own immortal beauties to enjoy, And twice preserv'd thee from the flames of Troy: Lo! to your eyes Ausonian coasts appear; Go—to that realm your happy voyage steer. But far beyond those regions you survey, Your coasting fleet must cut the lengthen'd way. Still, still at distance lies the fated place, Assign'd by Phœbus to the Trojan race. Go then, he said, with full success go on, Oh blest! thrice blest in such a matchless son. Why longer should my words your course detain, When the soft gales invite you to the main? Nor less the queen, her love and grief to tell, With costly presents takes her sad farewell. She gave my son a robe; the robe of old Her own fair hands embroider'd o'er with gold: With precious vests she loads the darling boy, And a refulgent mantle wrought in Troy. Accept, dear youth, she said, these robes I wove In happier days, memorial of my love. This trifling token of thy friend receive, The last, last present Hector's wife can give. 659, 660. I see My dear Astyanax reviv'd in thee!] This reflection of Andromache is delicate and moving. 'Tis the very voice of nature; the mother appears in it; especially where she adds with a sigh, Et nunc aequali tecum pubesceret aevo! It suggests to one, the delight she would have felt to have seen Iülus and Astyanax together, engaged in friendship, and fond of the same pursuits! After the destruction of Troy, the Grecian priest Calchas declared that the gods, to send them a favourable wind for their return, demanded that the son of Hector and Andromache must perish. His mother concealed Astyanax, but Ulysses discovered him; and he was thrown from the battlements of a very high tower. Seneca has written a tragedy on this subject; which like the rest of that unnatural writer's compositions, is filled with far-fetched sentiments, affected conceits, false ornaments, and declamation; the bane of true tragedy.Ah! now, methinks, and only now, I see My dear Astyanax revive in thee! 661. Such were his motions!] Here we may remark the propriety of behaviour and the decorum which Virgil observes, with relation to the characters of Helenus and Andromache. She is entirely taken up with Ascanius, and the remembrance of her lost Astyanax. She makes no presents but to that young prince. Those which Helenus gives are to Anchises and Æneas.Such were his motions! such a sprightly grace Charm'd from his eyes, and open'd in his face! And had it pleas'd, alas! the pow'rs divine, His blooming years had been the same as thine. Thus then the mournful last farewell I took, And, bath'd in tears, the royal pair bespoke: Live you long happy in a settled state; 'Tis ours to wander still from fate to fate. Safe have you gain'd the peaceful port of ease, Not doom'd to plow th'immeasurable seas; Nor seek for Latium, that deludes the view, A coast that flies as fast as we pursue. Here you a new Scamander can enjoy; Here your own hands erect a second Troy: With happier omens may she rise in peace, And less obnoxious than the first to Greece. If e'er the long-expected shore I gain, Where Tyber's streams enrich the flow'ry plain; Or if I live to raise our fated town; Our Latian Troy and yours shall join in one; In one shall center both the kindred states, 682. The same their fates,] The adventures of Æneas and Helenus had a great resemblance. They were both the issue of Dardanus; both fugitives from Troy; one had founded a colony in Epirus, the other was going to do the same in Italy.The same their founder, and the same their fates! And may their son to future times convey 684. The sacred friendship,] De La Cerda from Nannius (to both whom I refer the reader) is particular in shewing the friendship between these nations in after times; by which this prophesy (as they call it) was fulfilled: but sure they forgot Pyrrhus king of Epirus, who was no great friend to the Romans. But history is not my business; what Æneas says may be regarded as his own resolution, and as a wish to posterity:—and that is sufficient. Trapp.The sacred friendship which we sign to-day. We take to Italy the shortest road, By steep Ceraunian mountains, o'er the flood. Now the descending sun roll'd down the light, The hills lie cover'd in the shades of night; When some by lot attend, and ply the oars, Some, worn with toil, lie stretch'd along the shores: There, by the murmurs of the heaving deep Rock'd to repose, they sunk in pleasing sleep. Scarce half the hours of silent night were fled, When careful Palinure forsakes his bed; And every breath explores that stirs the seas, And watchful listens to the passing breeze; Observes the course of ev'ry orb on high, That moves in silent pomp along the sky. Arcturus dreadful with his stormy star, The watry Hyads, and the northern car, In the blue vault his piercing eyes behold, And huge Orion flame in arms of gold. When all serene he saw th'etherial plain, He gave the signal to the slumb'ring train. We rouze; our opening canvas we display, And wing with spreading sails the watry way. Now every star before Aurora flies, Whose glowing blushes streak the purple skies: When the dim hills of Italy we view'd, That peep'd by turns, and div'd beneath the flood. Lo! Italy appears, Achates cries, And Italy, with shouts, the crowd replies. My sire, transported, crowns a bowl with wine, Stands on the deck, and calls the pow'rs divine: Ye gods! who rule the tempests, earth, and seas, Befriend our course, and breathe a prosperous breeze. Up sprung th'expected breeze; the port we spy, Near, and more near; and Pallas' fane on high, With the steep hill, rose dancing to the eye. Our sails are furl'd; and from the seas profound, We turn the prows to land, while Ocean foams around. Where from the raging east the surges flow, The land indented bends an ample bow; The port conceal'd within the winding shore, Dash'd on the fronting cliffs, the billows roar. Two lofty tow'ring rocks extended wide, With outstretch'd arms embrace the murmuring tide. Within the mighty wall the waters lie, And from the coast the temple seems to fly. Here first, a dubious omen I behold; Four milk-white coursers graz'd the verdant field. 732. War, cry'd my sire,] The character of Anchises is well supported to the last, throughout that short part which he acts in the poem. Virgil represents him skilful in divination; before his departure from Troy, he foretold that Iülus should be a king from the fire which surrounded his hair, B. ii. in this passage he foretells the arrival of the Trojans in Italy, from the sight of these white horses. The poet has painted him likewise with the natural infirmities of old age. Hence his weak memory makes him mistake the import of the Delphic oracle: He thought that they were directed to sail to Crete, because Teucer one of the founders of Troy, was a Cretan; and had forgotten that Dardanus, who was another founder of Troy, came from Italy. At the same time, Virgil has given him all the virtues of an old hero: he is resolved to perish with his country; he makes his old age a reason for his despising death; nothing but a prodigy could induce him to leave the city of Troy tho' in flames. See Catrou.War, cry'd my sire, these hostile realms prepare; Train'd to the fight, these steeds denounce the war. But since sometimes they bear the guiding rein, Yok'd to the car; the hopes of peace remain. Then, as her temple rais'd our shouts, we paid Our first devotions to the martial maid. Next, as the rules of Helenus enjoin, We veil'd our heads at Juno's sacred shrine; And sought heav'n's awful queen with rites divine. This done;—once more with shifting sails we fly, And cautious pass the hostile regions by. Hence we renown'd Tarentum's bay behold, Renown'd, 'tis said, from Hercules of old. Oppos'd, Lacinia's temple rose on high, And proud Caulonian tow'rs salute the sky. Then, near the rocky Scylacaean bay For wrecks defam'd, we plow the watry way. Now we behold, emerging to our eyes From distant floods, Sicilian Ætna rise; And hear a thund'ring din, and dreadful roar Of billows breaking on the rocky shore. The smoaking waves boil high, on every side, And scoop the sands, and blacken all the tide. Charybdis' gulph, my father cries, behold! The direful rocks the royal seer foretold; Ply, ply your oars, and stretch to every stroke: Swift as the word, their ready oars they took; First skilful Palinure; then all the train Steer to the left, and plow the liquid plain. Now on a tow'ring arch of waves we rise, Heav'd on the bounding billows, to the skies. Then, as the roaring surge retreating fell, We shoot down headlong to the depths of hell. Thrice the rough rocks rebellow in our ears; Thrice mount the foamy tides, and dash the stars. The wind now sinking with the lamp of day, Spent with our toils, and dubious of the way; We reach the dire Cyclopean shore, that forms An ample port, impervious to the storms. 771. But Ætna roars with dreadful,] This description is worked up with great spirit and sublimity. Dr. Pearce, in his learned and judicious notes on Longinus, remarks, that the expression of sidera lambit in the fourth line of it, has the swell in it, which Longinus, Sect. 3. calls super-tragical. It is observable that Mr. Addison has taken no notice of those words in a translation he has made of this passage: Which translation of part of this third book of the Æneid is by no means worthy that author. This description of Ætna seems to have been copied from a very sublime one of Pindar, which Mr. West hath nobly translated, and illustrated with some notes and observations, too curious to be omitted in this place. Now under sulph'rous Cuma's sea-bound coast, And vast Sicilia lies his shaggy breast; By snowy Ætna, nurse of endless frost, The pillar'd prop of heav'n, for ever prest: Forth from whose nitrous caverns issuing rise Pure liquid fountains of tempestuous fire, And veil in ruddy mists the noon day skies, While wrapt in smoke the eddying flames aspire, Or gleaming thro' the night with hideous roar Far o'er the red'ning main huge rocky fragments pour. Thucydides, at the end of this third book, makes mention of three eruptions of Mount Ætna, the last of which, he says, happen'd, in the third year of the 88th Olymp. the former about fifty years before, that is, in the last year of the 76th, or the first year of the 77th Olymp. Of the date of the first eruption he makes no mention. Probably no more was known in his time about it, than that it was the first, and the only one, besides the two above-mention'd, that had happen'd from the time of the Greeks first settling in Sicily, as he expressly tells us. This ode was composed in the 78th Olymp. about four or five years after the second eruption mentioned by Thucydides. The city of Ætna founded on the ruins of Catana, was built by Hiero in the 76th Olymp. and stood in the neighbourhood of Mount Ætna, from which it derived it's name. From all these considerations it appears, with how much propriety Pindar has here introduced a description of the fiery eruptions of that burning mountain; one of which having happen'd so lately as four or five years before the writing this ode, could not but be very fresh in the memories of the inhabitants of the city of Ætna, whose territories, and even the town itself, were in great danger of being laid waste and destroyed by the torrents of fire, which issued from the neighbouring mountain, or by the earthquakes, that usually attended those eruptions. With the same propriety therefore he closes his description with a prayer to Jupiter, who had a temple on Mount Ætna, imploring his favour and protection. The other beauties of this fine passage are so visible and striking, that I need not point them out to the judicious reader. I shall only observe, that Pindar is the first poet, that has given us a description of these fiery eruptions of Mount Ætna; which from Homer's having taken no notice of so extraordinary a phaenomenon, is supposed not to have burned before his time. 1 Pyth. Ode, Dec. V.But Ætna roars with dreadful ruins nigh, Now hurls a bursting cloud of cinders high, Involv'd in smoaky whirlwinds to the sky; With loud displosion, to the starry frame Shoots fiery globes, and furious floods of flame: Now from her bellowing caverns burst away Vast piles of melted rocks, in open day. Her shatter'd entrails wide the mountain throws, And deep as hell her burning center glows. On vast Enceladus this pond'rous load Was thrown in vengeance by the thund'ring god; Who pants beneath the mountain, and expires, Through openings huge, the fierce tempestuous fires; Oft as he shifts his side, the caverns roar; With smoke and flame the skies are cover'd o'er, And all Trinacria shakes from shore to shore. 787. That night we heard,] Nothing can more strongly strike the imagination, than these circumstances of the wandering Trojans, sheltered in a wood, upon an unknown coast, and hearing strange, and terrible noises, during the whole night, which was extremely dark and moonless, and not knowing from whence these dreadful sounds came, or by what they might be occasioned: and at day-break being suddenly surprized at the ghastly figure of a man, who at first runs towards them with great precipitation, seemingly to beg some assistance, but suddenly stops and starts back at the sight of Trojan arms and habits; at last recovering himself a little, resolves to fling himself into their hands, let what will be the consequence: who, when they have received him into a vessel, gives them that dreadful narration of Polypheme, and informs them that this was the Cyclops island, and begs them therefore to leave it instantly, concluding most pathetically, that it would be some comfort to him, if he must die, to perish by the hands of men, and not of monsters.That night we heard the loud tremendous sound, The monstrous mingled peal that thunder'd round; While in the shelt'ring wood we sought repose, Nor knew from whence the dreadful tumult rose. For not one star displays his golden light; The skies lie cover'd in the shades of night; The silver moon her glimmering splendor shrouds In gathering vapours, and a night of clouds. Now fled the dewy shades of night away, Before the blushes of the dawning day; When, from the wood, shot sudden forth in view A wretch, in rags that flutter'd as he flew. The human form in meager hunger lost; The suppliant stranger, more than half a ghost, Stretch'd forth his hands, and pointed to the coast. We turn'd to view the sight;—his vest was torn, And all the tatter'd garb was tagg'd with thorn. His beard hangs long, and dust the wretch distains, And scarce the shadow of a man remains. In all besides, a Grecian he appears, And late a soldier in the Trojan wars. Soon as our Dardan dress and arms he view'd, In fear suspended for a space he stood; Stood, stop'd, and paus'd; then, springing forth, he flies All headlong to the shore with pray'rs and cries: Oh! by this vital air, the stars on high, By every pitying pow'r who treads the sky! Ye Trojans, take me hence; I ask no more; But bear, oh bear me from this dreadful shore. I own myself a Grecian, and confess I storm'd your Ilion with the sons of Greece. If that offence must doom me to the grave, Ye Trojans, plunge me in the whelming wave. I die contented, if that grace I gain; I die with pleasure, if I die by man. Then kneel'd the wretch, and suppliant clung around My knees with tears, and grovel'd on the ground. Mov'd with his cries, we urge him to relate His name, his lineage, and his cruel fate: Then by the hand my good old father took The trembling youth, who thus encourag'd spoke. Ulysses' friend, your empire to destroy, I left my native Ithaca for Troy, My sire, poor Adamastus, sent from far His son, his Achaemenides, to war; Oh; had we both our humble state maintain'd, And safe in peace and poverty remain'd! For me my friends forgetful left behind, In the huge Cyclops' ample cave confin'd, Floating with human gore, the dreadful dome Lies wide and waste, a solitary gloom! With mangled limbs was all the pavement spread; High as the stars he heaves his horrid head. The tow'ring giant stalks with matchless might; A savage fiend! tremendous to the sight. (Far, far from earth, ye heav'nly pow'rs, repell A fiend so direful to the depths of hell!) For slaughter'd mortals are the monster's food 845. The bodies he devours, &amp;c.] This episode of the companions of Ulysses massacred and devoured by Polpyheme is drawn from the Odyssey B. ix. The Roman poet relates the story in terms more majestic and heroic than those of the Greek. Besides Virgil tells us that only two Grecians were devoured by the Cyclops, but Homer speaks of four; so that the Roman poet exaggerates less than the Grecian. Catrou.The bodies he devours, and quaffs the blood. These eyes beheld him, when his ample hand Seiz'd two poor wretches of our trembling band. Stretch'd o'er the cavern, with a dreadful stroke, He snatch'd, he dash'd, he brain'd 'em on the rock. In one black torrent swam the smoaking floor; Fierce he devours the limbs that drop with gore; The limbs yet sprawling, dreadful to survey! Still heave and quiver while he grinds the prey. But mindful of himself, that fatal hour, Not unreveng'd their death Ulysses bore. For while the nodding savage sleeps supine, Gorg'd with his horrid feast, and drown'd in wine; And, stretch'd o'er half the cave, ejects the load Of human offals mixt with human blood: Trembling, by lot we took our posts around, Th' enormous giant slumb'ring on the ground. Then (ev'ry god invok'd, who rules the sky) Plunge the sharp weapon in his monstrous eye; His eye, that midst his frowning forehead shone, Like some broad buckler, or the blazing sun. Thus we reveng'd our dear companions lost: 867. But fly, ye Trojans,] This break in Achaemenides's speech is of an exquisite beauty. In the midst of his narration, the fear of the Cyclops and the dangers he had just escaped, break in upon his mind, and stop him for a moment from finishing his account, to give the Trojans advice to fly immediately. The circumstances that follow of his hearing the giant's footsteps, and loud voices, while he lay hid in dens and caves, are strongly imagined.But fly, ye Trojans, fly this dreadful coast. For know, a hundred horrid Cyclops more Range on these hills, and dwell along the shore, As huge as Polypheme, the giant swain, Who milk, like him, in caves the woolly train. Now thrice the moon, fair empress of the night, Has fill'd her growing horns with borrow'd light, Since in these woods I pass'd the hours away, In dens of beasts, and savages of prey, Saw on the rocks the Cyclops ranging round Heard their loud footsteps thund'ring on the ground, With each big bellowing voice, and trembled at the sound. Here every stony fruit I pluck for food, Herbs, cornels, roots, and berries of the wood. While round I gaze, your fleet I first explore, The first that touch'd on this detested shore; To 'scape these savages, I flew with joy To meet your navy, tho' it fail'd from Troy. If I but shun the cruel hands of these; Do you destroy me by what death you please. Scarce had he said; when lo! th'enormous swain, Huge Polyphemus, 'midst his fleecy train, A bulk prodigious! from the mountain's brow Descends terrific to the shore below: A monster grim, tremendous, vast, and high; His front deform'd, and quench'd his blazing eye! His huge hand held a pine, tall, large, and strong, To guide his footsteps as he towr'd along. 895. This flock,] Some manuscripts have not the following words De collo fistula pendet. There should certainly be no stop after, Solamenque mali, which relates to his pipe. Mr. Upton makes the following remark on this passage. “De collo fistula pendet, comes in here after so dragging and heavy a manner, that some of the best editions leave it out. But surely the chief, if not only pleasure, that Polyphemus, so famous for his rural ditties on Galatea, could now take, was in his oaten pipe, and would the pastoral Virgil forget this? Let it be considered likewise that the verses are a description of the monster, as then he appeared to Æneas, with a pine tree in his hand, and his flocks following him; but his solace was his rural pipe, all his pleasure was in music— See how Virgilian then these verses will appear with the least alteration.” Quae sola voluptas Solamenque mali, de collo fistula pendet. Letter on Spencer, to Mr. West, page 29.His flock attends, the only joy he knows; His pipe around his neck, the solace of his woes. Soon as the giant reach'd the deeper flood With many a groan he cleans'd the gather'd blood From his bor'd eye-ball in the briny main, And, bellowing, grinds his teeth in agonizing pain. Then stalks enormous through the midmost tides; And scarce the topmost surges reach his sides. Aboard, the well-deserving Greek we took, And, pale with fear, the dreadful coast forsook; Cut every cord with eager speed away, Bend to the stroke, and sweep the foamy sea. The giant heard; and, turning to the sound, At first pursu'd us through the vast profound; 909. Stretch'd his huge hand,] The expression, dextram affectare, in the original, has given the commentators much fruitless trouble to endeavour to make sense of; tho' all the translators agree in the meaning of the words, yet there is a peculiarity in the phrase, which, for want of a parallel expression in any other classic author, has never been sufficiently clear'd up. The reading proposed by the Cambridge editor of dextram adjectare, if it were supported by any copies, as it is not, would be equally unaccountable.Stretch'd his huge hand to reach the fleet in vain; Nor could he ford the deep Ionian main. With that, the furious monster roar'd so loud, 912. That ocean shook,] This is a most noble hyperbole, and by no means too bold, as some will have it; they forget not only the prerogative of poetry, but the real nature of fear; which always swells and heightens it's object. Trapp.That Ocean shook in ev'ry distant flood; Trembled all Italy from shore to shore; And Ætna's winding caves rebellow to the roar. Rouz'd at the peal, the fierce Cyclopean train Rush'd from their woods and mountains to the main; Around the port the ghastly brethren stand, A dire assembly! covering all the strand. In each grim forehead blaz'd the single eye; In vain enrag'd the monstrous race we spy, A host of giants tow'ring in the sky. 922. So on some mountain,] 'Tis observable that this very short simile is the only one in the third book. For my own part, I could wish there had been none longer than this, in the second. It was on the subject of long, labour'd comparisons, that M. de la Motte used to say, that he thought Æneas by far too great a poet; and that he could not help feeling that impropriety thro' the whole of the second and third books of the Æneid; where the hero is often not less florid and figurtive in his narration, than the poet himself is in the rest.So on some mountain tow'rs the lofty grove Of beauteous Dian, or imperial Jove; Th'aërial pines in pointed spires from far, Or spreading oaks, majestic nod in air. Headlong we fly with horror, where the gales And speeding winds direct the fluttering sails. But Helenus forbids to plow the waves, Where Scylla roars, and fierce Charybdis raves. As death stands dreadful 'midst the dangerous road, With backward course we plow the foamy flood; When, from Pelorus' point a northern breeze Swells every sail, and wafts us o'er the seas; First, where Pantagia's mouth appear'd in view, Flank'd by a range of rocks, the navy flew: Then, shooting by the fam'd Megarean bay, And lowly Tapsus; cut the watry way. 938. These coasts by Achaemenides were shown,] What an exact observer of probability is Virgil! here is an answer prepar'd to any who might object, How should Æneas, a perfect stranger be so well acquainted with their coasts, which neither he nor any of his fleet had ever before visited, or beheld? Why, says he, Achaemenides whom they took up from the Cyclops' island, and who had lately passed the very same way, pointed the different countries to them as they passed along.These Coasts by Achaemenides were shown, Who follow'd, late, Laërtes' wand'ring son: Familiar with the track he past before, He names the lands, and points out ev'ry shore. An isle, once call'd Ortygia, fronts the sides Of rough Plemmyrium, and Sicanian tides. Hither, 'tis said, Alphëus, from his source In Elis' realms, directs his watry course: Beneath the main he takes his secret way, And mounts with Arethusa's streams to day: Now a Sicilian flood his course he keeps, And rolls with blended waters to the deeps. Admonish'd, I adore the gaurdian gods, Then pass the bounds of rich Helorus' floods. Next our fleet gallies by Pachynus glide, Whose rocks projecting stretch into the tide. 954. The Camarinian marsh,] The Oracle forbad the inhabitants to drain this marsh, they neglected to observe it, and their enemies entering thro' the part that was drained, committed a great slaughter, Servius observes that this oracle was not delivered so early as the time in which Æneas lived, and that is therefore a chronological error in the poet.The Camarinian marsh I now survey, By fate forbidden to be drain'd away. Then the Geloan fields with Gela came In view, who borrow'd from the flood their name. With her huge wall proud Agragas succeeds; A realm, of old renown'd for generous steeds. From thee, Selinus, swift before the wind 961.—And left thy sinking palms behind,] The original says, palmosa Selinus; the translator has therefore added a poetical circumstance, of the tops of the palm trees gradually sinking and disappearing as they sail'd along.We flew, and left thy sinking palms behind; By Lilybaeum's sides our course pursu'd, Whose rocks insidious hide beneath the flood: And reach (those dangerous shelves and shallows past) 965. The fatal port of Drepanum,] This is a city in Sicily (says Segrais) called at present Trepano, where they still shew the tomb of Anchises.The fatal port of Drepanum at last. 965. Wretch as I was,] Bossu thinks it an instance of our poet's exquisite judgment, that he doth not minutely and at length describe the illness and death of Anchises: which he is of opinion would have too much retarded the action of the poem, and not have interested the reader in any extraordinary manner; and above all, it afforded no matter for poetical description.Wretch as I was, on this detested coast, The chief support of all my woes, I lost; 968. Father—] Here Virgil does not follow Dionysius Halicarnasseus, as usual, who says Anchises arrived in Italy. But what part could Anchises have acted amid the wars that were to follow? Catrou.My dear, dear father—sav'd, but sav'd in vain From all the tempests of the raging main. Nor did the royal sage this blow foretell; Nor did the direful Harpy-queen of hell, Among her frightful prodigies, foreshow This last sad stroke, this unexpected woe. Here all my labours, all my toils were o'er, 975. And hence heav'n led me,] The original says vestris Deus appulit oris. My good genius, or the kind God led me; a compliment by the word Deus is I think meant to be paid the queen.—It is remarkable that the poet puts the soft expression Deus into the mouth of Æneas, tho' in reality it was a tempest that drove him hither.And hence heav'n led me to your friendly shore. 976. The prince relates,] Catrou says, the best manuscripts read—Fataque narrabat instead of—Fata renarrabat.—Thus, while the room was hush'd, the prince relates The wondrous series of his various fates; His long, long wand'rings, and unnumber'd woes: 979. Then ceas'd,] Segrais observes, that the fifteen hundred verses which are contained in the second and third book may be repeated in two hours. Æneas's recital did not appear prolix to Dido, neither can it to any reader of taste.Then ceas'd; and sought the blessings of repose. The End of the Third Book. THE FOURTH BOOK In the third book, Virgil seems to have displayed his skill in descriptive poetry; but this fourth book is entirely devoted to the pathetic. And indeed he hath exhausted the subject, no author ever moved the passions of pity and terror in so great a degree. The origin and progress of the passion of love, its various effects on the mind, its doubts, and hopes, and fears, and jealousies, its pleasures and pains, till it ends in the deepest despair, were never so forcibly, so elegantly, or naturally described. Servius tells us, that this whole book is borrowed from the third of Apollonius Rhodius. A few hints may perhaps be taken, but not enough to detract any thing from Virgil's merit. The only answer, says M. Voltaire, which is to be made to such observations is, that the fourth book of Virgil is too great a masterpiece to be but a copy. 'Tis just as some people say, Milton hath stolen his poem, from an Italian stroller, named Andreino. The ARGUMENT. Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Æneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting-match for his entertainment. Juno, with the consent of Venus, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives Æneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be compleated. Jupiter dispatches Mercury to Æneas, to warn him from Carthage. Æneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister's entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes. But love inflam'd the queen; the raging pain Preys on her heart, and glows in every vein. 3. Much she revolves the hero's deeds divine,] Dido endeavours to persuade herself, that it was the exalted merit and virtue of the hero, not his person that she was fond of: the usual and natural artifice of this insinuating passion of love!Much she revolves the hero's deeds divine, And much the glories of his godlike line; Each look, each accent breaks her golden rest, Lodg'd in her soul, and imag'd in her breast. The morn had chas'd the dewy shades away, And o'er the world advanc'd the lamp of day; When to her sister thus the royal dame Disclos'd the secret of her growing flame. Anna, what dreams are these that haunt my rest? Who is this heroe, this our godlike guest? Mark but his graceful port, his manly charms; How great a prince! and how renown'd in arms! Sure he descends from some celestial kind; For fear attends the low degenerate mind. But oh! what wars, what battles he relates! How long he struggled with his adverse fates! Did not my soul her purpose still retain, Fix'd and determin'd ne'er to wed again, Since from my widow'd arms the murdering sword Untimely snatch'd my first unhappy lord; Did not my thoughts the name of marriage dread, And the bare mention of the bridal bed— Forgive my frailty—but I seem inclin'd To yield to this one weakness of my mind. For oh! my sister, unreserv'd and free I trust the secret of my soul to thee; Since poor Sichæus, by my brother slain, Dash'd with his blood the consecrated fane, And stain'd the gods; my firm resolves, I own, This graceful prince has shook, and this alone. I feel a warmth o'er all my trembling frame, Too like the tokens of my former flame. 35. But oh; may earth] There are some delicate strokes of nature in the cautious manner in which Dido reveals her new-born passion to her sister. But what follows in the solemn protestations she makes, that she was immoveably resolved never to marry again, is inimitably just and natural; and the true picture of a widow's resolutions. The reader of taste will likewise be charm'd with the arguments her sister uses to persuade her to indulge her passion and marry again: 'tis impossible to think of more strong and weighty ones; especially where she puts Dido in mind, that she is surrounded with enemies, that nothing could give her kingdom more strength than a confederacy with the Trojans, that even prudence would direct her to take a husband, if for no other reason, yet that he might be a kind of protector of her infant kingdom against her brother's anger; and lastly, that the very gods seemed to have interested themselves in this affair, and that for her part she could not help believing that Juno herself had driven the Trojan fleet on purpose to her coasts. The excuses she suggests to Dido, and the causes of delay she would have her make use of to Æneas are likewise admirable: “Tell him that it is utterly impossible to undertake so dangerous a voyage in the wintry season, and that his fleet wants refitting.”But oh; may earth her dreadful gulph display, And gaping snatch me from the golden day; May I be hurl'd, by heav'n's almighty sire, Transfix'd with thunder and involv'd in fire, Down to the shades of hell from realms of light, The deep, deep shades of everlasting night; Ere, sacred honour! I betray thy cause In word, or thought, or violate thy laws. No!—my first lord, my first ill-fated spouse, Still, as in life, is lord of all my vows. My love he had, and ever let him have, Interr'd with him, and buried in the grave. Then, by her rising grief o'erwhelm'd, she ceas'd: The tears ran trickling down her heaving breast. Sister, the fair replies, whom far above The light of heav'n, or life itself I love; Still on your bloom shall endless sorrow prey, And waste your youth in solitude away? And shall no pleasing theme your thoughts employ? The prattling infant, or the bridal joy? Think you such cares disturb your husband's shade, Or stir the sacred ashes of the dead? What though before, no lover won your grace, Among the Tyrian, or the Libyan race? With just disdain you pass'd Iarbas o'er, And many a king whom warlike Afric bore. But will you fly the heroe you approve? And steel your heart against a prince you love? Nor will you once reflect what regions bound Your infant empire, and your walls surround? Here proud Gætulian cities tow'r in air, Whose swarthy sons are terrible in war; There the dread Syrtes stretch along the main, And there the wild Barcæans range the plain; Here parch'd with thirst a smoaking region lies, There fierce in arms the brave Numidians rise. Why should I urge our vengeful brother's ire? The war just bursting from the gates of Tyre? Sure, every god, with mighty Juno, bore The fleets of Ilion to the Libyan shore. From such a marriage, soon your joyful eyes Shall see a potent town and empire rise. What scenes of glory Carthage must enjoy, When our confederate arms unite with Troy? Go then, propitiate heav'n; due off'rings pay; Caress, invite your godlike guest to stay, And study still new causes of delay. Tell him, that, charg'd with deluges of rain, Orion rages on the wintry main; That still unrigg'd his shatter'd vessels lie, Nor can his fleet endure so rough a sky. 86. These words soon] Bossu makes some sensible remarks on the progress of Dido's passion and guilt. This princess at first entertains Æneas with vows and prayers which she puts up to the gods with a sincere piety. Because then she was innocent and at quiet. She begins to love Æneas contrary to the vow she had made to the manes of her first husband, which to her were a kind of deity. She begins at the same time to suppose that these manes are no longer concerned about her, and lay no obligation upon her to keep her vows. Last of all, being more corrupted, she becomes guilty of impiety against the gods: and seeing that Æneas was about to leave her by their order, she would persuade him that they are quite ignorant and unconcerned at what is done here on earth. Not that she was really and absolutely persuaded of so impious a maxim: the poet was too judicious to make so great and so strange an alteration in the manners of this queen, in so short a time. 'Tis her passion which makes her speak thus. This, in short, is the beginning of impiety; which naturally happens to those, whose vices and passions are violent; and which at last leads them into downright atheism. Bossu, book v. c. 2.These words soon scatter'd the remains of shame; Confirm'd her hopes, and fann'd the rising flame. With speed they seek the temples, and implore With rich oblations each celestial pow'r: Selected sheep with holy rites they slay To Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of day. But chief, to Juno's name the victims bled, To Juno, guardian of the bridal bed. The queen before the snowy heifer stands, Amid the shrines, a goblet in her hands; Between the horns she sheds the sacred wine, And pays due honours to the pow'rs divine; Moves round the fane in solemn pomp, and loads, Day after day, the altars of the gods. Then hovering o'er, the fair consults in vain The panting entrails of the victims slain: But ah! no sacred rites her pain remove; Priests, pray'rs, and temples! what are you to love? With passion fir'd, her reason quite o'erthrown, The hapless queen runs raving thro' the town. Soft flames consume her vitals, and the dart, Deep, deep within, lies festering in her heart. So sends the heedless hunter's twanging bow The shaft that quivers in the bleeding doe; Stung with the stroke, and madding with the pain, She wildly flies from wood to wood in vain; Shoots o'er the Cretan lawns with many a bound, The cleaving dart still rankling in the wound! 114. Now the fond princess] If the reader be not void of all taste and sensibility, pity and humanity, he must be inexpressibly moved, by the following circumstances of Dido's behaviour: by her carrying Æneas thro' the town, and tempting him to settle in a city already begun to be built; by her beginning to speak and suddenly stopping short and faultering; by her making still new feasts and entertainments for her lover; by her desiring to hear his story again and again; by her attention to every syllable he spoke; by her remaining in the hall after the guests were gone, and lying upon the couch where he sat; by her thinking she still hears his voice, and still sees his person, and by her fondly playing with Ascanius.Now the fond princess leads her heroe on, Shows him her Tyrian wealth, and growing town; Displays her pompous tow'rs that proudly rise, And hopes to tempt him with the glorious prize; Now, as she tries to tell her raging flame, Stops short,—and faulters, check'd by conscious shame: Now, at the close of evening, calls her guest, To share the banquet, and renew the feast: She fondly begs him to repeat once more The Trojan story that she heard before; Then to distraction charm'd, in rapture hung On every word, and dy'd upon his tongue. But when the setting stars to rest invite, And fading Cynthia veils her beamy light; When all the guests retire to soft repose; Left in the hall, she sighs, and vents her woes, Lies on his couch, bedews it with her tears, In fancy sees her absent prince, and hears His charming voice still sounding in her ears. Fir'd with the glorious hero's graceful look, The young Ascanius on her lap she took, With trifling play her furious pains beguil'd; In vain!—the father charms her in the child. 137. No more the tow'rs, unfinish'd,] The moral here is equally just and noble: nothing can more strongly represent the pernicious consequences of this violent passion; the neglect it occasions of all useful and necessary affairs; the indolence and stupor into which it casts all the faculties of mind and body; and how it damps and destroys all the noble and worthy pursuits and aims of mankind. To this purpose Lucretius says finely, that when a man is deeply in love, Labitur interea res et vadimonia fiunt; Languent officia, atque aegrotat fama vacillans. What a change of conduct has this passion suddenly wrought upon our unfortunate queen! the imperial works in which she was engaged with such earnestness are all at a stand! she, who was so busy and intent upon finishing her city, and bent her whole thoughts and soul upon that glorious design, now thinks of nothing but fresh parties of pleasure with her lover, and by what kinds of diversions and amusements she may best detain her beloved stranger!No more the tow'rs, unfinish'd, rise in air: The youth, undisciplin'd, no more prepare Ports for the fleet, or bulwarks for the war; The works and battlements neglected lie, And the proud structures cease to brave the sky. The fair thus rages with the mighty pain, That fir'd her soul; and honour pleads in vain. 144. This Juno saw,] The Juno of the Æneid is formed upon the Juno of the Iliad. This is visible. But see what Virgil in imitating hath added of his own. Juno, besides her hatred against the Trojans, excited by the judgment of Paris, and the rape of Ganymede (both so injurious to her beauty) appears particularly animated against Æneas for special reasons, which render her character proper for the Æneid; and which raise Virgil far above the rank of those servile copiers, who can only follow their author, step by step. Juno knew, says he, that the Roman power was to become fatal to Carthage, her favourite city, which she would gladly have made mistress of the world. This makes a new incentive to her against a people, she had already so many other reasons to hate; and this gives Virgil an opportunity of exalting the glory of his country, by recalling into the minds of his readers, the greatest events to be found in history. L'abbe Fraquier, Memoires de Litterature, tome ii.This Juno saw, and thus the bride of Jove, In guileful terms address'd the queen of love: A high exploit indeed! a glorious name, Unfading trophies and eternal fame, You, and your son have worthily pursu'd! Two gods a single woman have subdu'd! To me your groundless jealousies are known, And dark suspicions of this Tyrian town. But why, why Goddess, to what aim or end In lasting quarrels should we still contend? Hence then from strife resolve we both to cease, And by the nuptial band confirm the peace. To crown your wish, the queen with fond desire Dies for your son, and melts with amorous fire. Let us with equal sway protect the place, The common guardians of the mingled race. Be Tyre the dow'r to seal the glad accord, And royal Dido serve this Phrygian lord. To whom the queen; (who mark'd with piercing eyes The goddess labouring, in the dark disguise, To Libyan shores from Latium to convey 165. The destin'd seat] These lines contain a direct and most indisputable proof, that Virgil introduced this episode of Dido, with a view to the rivalship that existed betwixt Carthage and Rome.The destin'd seat of universal sway;) Who this alliance madly would deny? Or war with thee, dread empress of the sky? And oh! that fortune in the work would join, With full success to favour the design! But much I doubt, o goddess, if the fates, Or Jove permit us to unite the states. You, as his consort, your request may move, And search the will, or bend the mind of Jove. Go then—your scheme before the father lay? Go;—and I follow, where you lead the way. Be mine the care, th'imperial dame replies, To gain the god, the sovereign of the skies. Then heed my counsel—when the dawning light Drives from the opening world the shades of night; The prince and queen, transfix'd with amorous flame, Bend to the woods to hunt the savage game: There, while the crowds the forest-walks beset, Swarm round the woods, and spread the waving net; The skies shall burst upon the sportive train In storms of hail, and deluges of rain: The gather'd tempest o'er their heads shall roll, And the long thunders roar from pole to pole. On ev'ry side shall fly the scattering crowds, Involv'd and cover'd in a night of clouds. To the same cave for shelter shall repair The Trojan heroe and the royal fair. The lovers, if your will concurs with mine, Ourself in Hymen's nuptial bands will join. The goddess gave consent, the compact bound, 195. But smil'd] Venus in this and the foregoing passage line 161. is represented as a compleat mistress of cunning, and possessed of the keenest discernment. Whether the poet has concealed any allegory, by giving the queen of beauty these qualities, the ladies, to whom I leave it, must determine.But smil'd in secret at the fraud she found. Scarce had Aurora left her orient bed, And rear'd above the waves her radiant head, When, pouring through the gates, the train appear, Massylian hunters with the steely spear, Sagacious hounds, and toils, and all the sylvan war. 201. The queen engag'd in dress,] She was spending a great deal of time (says old Servius) to adorn herself to the utmost of her power that she might appear more charmingly beautiful to Æneas. And at last when she does actually make her appearance after this delay, our expectations are fully answered, and she comes forth as lovely a figure as we can conceive.The queen engag'd in dress,—with reverence wait The Tyrian peers before the regal gate. Her steed, with gold and purple cover'd round, Neighs, champs the bit, and foaming paws the ground. At length she comes, magnificently drest (Her guards attending) in a Tyrian vest: Back in a golden caul her locks are ty'd; 208. Back in a golden caul,] If modern fine ladies, who are apt to think the dresses worn at present, more elegantly fancied, and becoming, than any that can be imagined, would not be offended at the liberty I take; I would observe, that this hunting-dress of Dido is far more graceful and becoming to the person than any dress which ever appeared in a chace on Windsor forest.A golden quiver rattles at her side; A golden clasp her purple garment binds, And robes, that flew redundant in the winds. Next with the youthful Trojans to the sport The fair Ascanius issues from the court. But far the fairest, and supremely tall, Tow'rs great Æneas, and outshines them all. 215. As when from Lycia bound,] This comparison is of an exquisite beauty; and might give a full idea of the gracefulness of Apollo to a statuary or painter; there is something very elegant in the image of His locks bound backward and adorn'd with gold. A painter might execute in colours every part of this description, except the circumstance contained in the last line, His golden quiver rattling as he goes. This adds life to the whole figure, and is one of the reasons of the superiority of poetry to painting. It must be observed likewise that there is a secret beauty in this comparison, which a passage in Suetonius suggests. Augustus, it seems, affected to be thought like Apollo; there is therefore a peculiar propriety and address in the poet, in his comparing Æneas (by whom Augustus was undoubtedly meant) to that God. And it seems to have been an usual piece of flattery in the courtly writers of that time to compare the emperor (who was in reality beautiful) to Apollo. I would not assert (says Mr. Spence) that Virgil had the famous figure of the Apollo Belvidere in his eye, in writing this comparison; but thus much is plain; that they both relate to the Apollo Venator, set off more than he is usually in that character; that both in the poet and in the marble, this god is represented as the standard of beauty; that this divine beauty of his, and his motion, are the two principal points aimed at by Virgil in this similitude, and the two chief things that strike one in viewing the Apollo Belvidere; and on the whole, that if the one was not copied from the other, they are at least so much alike, that they may very well serve to give a mutual light to each other. Polymetis, Dial. viii.As when from Lycia bound in wintry frost, Where Xanthus' streams enrich the smiling coast, The beauteous Phoebus in high pomp retires, And hears in Delos the triumphant quires; The Cretan crowds and Dryopes advance, And painted Scythians round his altars dance; Fair wreaths of vivid bays his head infold, His locks bound backward and adorn'd with gold; The god majestic move's o'er Cynthus' brows, His golden quiver rattling as he goes: So mov'd Æneas; such his charming grace; So glow'd the purple bloom, that flush'd his godlike face. Soon as the train amid the mountains came, And storm'd the covert of the savage game; The goats flew bounding o'er the craggy brow From rock to rock, and sought the fields below. Here the fleet stags, chas'd down the tow'ring steep, In clouds of dust through the long valleys sweep: While there, exulting, to his utmost speed 234. The young Ascanius,] This circumstance is natural; Virgil for ever suits the manners to the age of the persons he introduces.The young Ascanius spurs his fiery steed, Outstrips by turns the flying social train, And scorns the meaner triumphs of the plain: The hopes of glory all his soul inflame; Eager he longs to run at nobler game, And drench his youthful javelin in the gore Of the fierce lion, or the mountain boar. Meantime loud thunders rattle round the sky, And hail and rain, in mingled tempest, fly; While floods on floods, in swelling turbid tides, Roll roaring down the mountain's channel'd sides. The young Ascanius, and the hunting train, To close retreats fled diverse o'er the plain. To the same gloomy cave with speed repair 248. The Trojan hero and the royal fair.] Sir R. Steele in the Tatlers observes the great judgment and exactness of Virgil in dropping the epithet he usually applies to his hero, pius Æneas, and calling him only Dux Trojanus, now he is entering upon the adventure of the cave. 'Tis said, that Mr. Addison communicated this remark to Steele, and by Steele's making use of it in the Tatler, first discovered him to be the author of those papers.The Trojan heroe and the royal fair. Earth shakes, and Juno gives the nuptial signs; With quivering flames the glimmering grotto shines: With light'nings all the conscious skies are spread; 252. The nymphs run,] If ever Virgil (says, M. Segrais) shewed his address in making things understood only by glancing at and lightly touching upon them; it is doubtless in this passage, at which it was so easy to make a false step. All the commentators praise his modesty and his delicacy.The nymphs run shrieking round the mountain's head. From that sad day, unhappy Dido! rose Shame, death, and ruin, and a length of woes. Nor fame nor censure now the queen can move, No more she labours to conceal her love. 257. Her passions stand avow'd,] The love with which Dido is seized for Æneas, and that of Calypso for Ulysses, are at bottom much the same thing; as are also the orders that Jupiter sends to Æneas to leave Carthage, and that sent to Ulysses to leave Calypso: But whoever takes the trouble to compare these passages together exactly, will find what may be expected from a great genius, when he comes after one of the same character; all the difference there necessarily is between an inventor and one who improves upon an invention. In fact, Calypso is enamour'd of Ulysses. She loves him passionately; for tho' immortal, yet she is not proof against the passions of mortals: She gives way to her inclination, and does not even observe the laws of modesty. Dido's love to Æneas is quite otherwise managed. 'Tis love himself, it is Cupid, who at the desire of his mother Venus, assumes the form of Ascanius, in order to deceive Dido more easily. Two divinities are employed to efface out of her mind the memory of her first spouse, and to blow up afresh the sentiments in her heart, which she thought she had buried in the grave of Sichaeus. Egregiam vero laudem &amp;c. Ulysses, by the order of the gods, abandons Calypso. She pines with regret, she addresses her plaints to heaven; but all her complaining and her grief is but for the loss of a man, and being deprived of her pleasure. The character Homer gives to Calypso, by becoming so easily enamour'd of Ulysses, gives his hero no personal pre-eminence over Æneas. Dido's complaints are in another strain; she deplores her stained glory her having sullied that reputation which had formerly exalted her name to heaven: Te propter Libycae. She thinks of the contempt with which neighbouring princes must look upon her, having so often despised them. The image of Sichaeus, that moving, tender image, is ever present to her mind, and in the miserable condition she is now in, she has nothing left to desire but death: Quin morere, ut merita es ? She dies, and the recital of her death presents us with such natural beauties and touching images, that we must have recourse to the most pathetic among the Greek tragedies, to find any thing to be compared with the end of the fourth book of the Æneid. What art, what dexterity is there in marking out by the rage of Dido the source of the implacable hatred between the Carthaginians and Romans: Exoriare aliquis &amp;c. L'abbe Fraquier, memoires de Litterature, Tome II.Her passion stands avow'd; and wedlock's name Adorns the crime, and sanctifies the shame. 259. Now Fame, tremendous fiend!] The description of this allegorical person of Fame is undoubtedly beautiful, but perhaps is rather too long. Mr. Addison is of opinion that these shadowy figures should have no share in the action on an epic poem, and on these principles seems to condemn the fine allegory of Sin and Death in Milton. This sublime image, And stalks on earth, and tow'rs above the skies, is litterally copied, from Homer's noble description of Discord, which Longinus so greatly admires, Sect ix. saying the space between heaven and earth marks out the vast reach and capacity of Homer's ideas, Iliad. iv. v 443. There is a thought of equal sublimity in the wisdom of Solomon: “Thy almighty word leaped down; it touched the heaven, but it stood upon the earth.” c. xviii. v 15, 16.Now Fame, tremendous fiend! without delay Through Libyan cities took her rapid way. Fame, the swift plague, that every moment grows, And gains new strength and vigour as she goes. First small with fear, she swells to wond'rous size, And stalks on earth, and tow'rs above the skies; Whom, in her wrath to heav'n, the teeming earth Produc'd the last of her gigantic birth; A monster huge, and dreadful to the eye, With rapid feet to run, or wings to fly. Beneath her plumes the various fury bears A thousand piercing eyes and list'ning ears; And with a thousand mouths and babbling tongues appears. Thund'ring by night, through heaven and earth she flies; No golden slumbers seal her watchful eyes; On tow'rs or battlements she sits by day, And shakes whole towns with terror and dismay; Alarms the world around, and, perch'd on high, Reports a truth, or publishes a lye. Now both she mingled with malignant joy, And told the nations, that a prince from Troy Inflam'd with love the Tyrian queen, who led The godlike stranger to her bridal bed; That both, indulging to their soft desires, And deaf to censure, melt in amorous fires; From every thought the cares of state remove, And the long winter pass'd away in love. This tale the Fury glories to display, Then to the king Iarbas bent her way; With jealous rage the furious prince inspires, And all his soul with indignation fires. 290. This monarch sprung from Ammon's] Jupiter Ammon was the only god whom the Garamantians adored, and the Garamantians were the people who bordered nighest on Æthiopia. Their situation was on the eastern side of that country which is now called Zaara. The famous temple of Jupiter Ammon was very much frequented on account of the oracles that were given out there. Lucan and Quintus Curtius have written very different descriptions of it, the one in the ninth book of his Pharsalia, the other in the fourth book of his history. Catrou.This monarch sprung from Ammon's warm embrace With a fair nymph of Garamantic race. The mighty king a hundred temples rais'd; An hundred altars that with victims blaz'd, Through all his realms, in honour of his fire; 295. And watch'd the hallow'd everlasting fire;] Plutarch mentions, as an historical fact, this lamp that was for ever burning before the altar of Jupiter Ammon. Virgil takes care to borrow from history every thing that can adorn and enrich his poem. Here is one instance of his great learning. Catrou.And watch'd the hallow'd everlasting fire; With various wreaths adorn'd the holy door, And drench'd the soil with consecrated gore. Amid the statues of the gods he stands, And, spreading forth to Jove his lifted hands, Fir'd with the tale, and raving with despair, Prefers in bitterness of soul his pray'r. 302. Almighty Jove! to whom our Moorish line,] There is a noble fire and fierceness in this bold speech of Iarbas: The taunts and revilings he throws even upon Jupiter himself, are quite in the spirit of an enraged African, a haughty prince, and abandon'd lover. The contempt with which he speaks of Æneas is admirably express'd; especially what relates to his dress and habit, which 'tis natural to imagine this rough, Moorish, king must hold in great disdain. Et nunc ille Paris, cum semiviro comitatu, Moeoniâ mentum mitrâ, crinemque madentem Subnexus, rapto potitur ?Almighty Jove! to whom our Moorish line In large libations pour the generous wine, And feast on painted beds; say, father, say, If yet thy eyes these flagrant crimes survey. Or do we vainly tremble and adore, When thro' the skies the pealing thunders roar? Thine are the bolts? or idly do they fall, And rattle thro' the dark aërial hall? A wand'ring woman, who on Libya thrown, Rais'd on a purchas'd spot a slender town; On terms ourself prescrib'd, was glad to gain A barren tract that runs along the main; The proffer'd nuptials of thy son abhorr'd; But to her throne receives a Dardan lord. And lo! this second Paris comes again, With his unmanly, soft, luxurious train, In scented tresses and a mitre gay, To bear my bride, his ravish'd prize, away; While still in vain we bid thy altars flame, And pay our vows to nothing but a name. Him, as he grasp'd his altars, and prefer'd His wrathful pray'r, th'almighty father heard; Then to the palace turn'd his awful eye, Where, careless of their fame, the lovers lie. The god, that scene offended to survey, Charg'd with his high command the son of May: Fly, fly, my son, our orders to perform; Mount the fleet wind, and ride the rapid storm; Fly—to you Dardan chief in Carthage bear Our awful mandate through the fields of air, Who idly ling'ring in the Tyrian state, Neglects the promis'd walls decreed by fate. Not such a prince, the beauteous queen of love (When twice she sav'd him) promis'd him to Jove; A prince she promis'd who by deeds divine Should prove he sprung from Teucer's martial line; Whose sword imperial Italy should awe, 339. And give the world the law.] In the original there is an expression of such force and energy, that, as Catrou observes, it is almost impossible to translate; Italiam gravidam imperiis. From that time Rome was destined to bring forth empires. In truth, in the time of Augustus, Rome was the mistress of almost all those countries and regions which composed the empires of the Babylonions, the Medes, the Persians and the Greeks.A warlike realm! and give the world the law. If no such glories can his mind inflame, If he neglects his own immortal fame; What has his heir the young Ascanius done? Why should he grudge an empire to his son? What scheme, what prospect can the chief propose, So long to loiter with a race of foes? The promis'd kingdom to regard no more, And quite neglect the destin'd Latian shore? Haste—bid him sail—be this our will; and bear With speed this mandate through the fields of air. 350. Swift at the word the duteous son,] The description of this celestial messenger is far excelled by our inimitable countryman, (who indeed, in many particulars, has outdone his. Masters, Homer and Virgil,) in his picture of the angel Raphael. ? Six wings he wore, to shade His lineaments divine; the pair that clad Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast With regal ornament; the middle pair Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold. And colours dip'd in heav'n: the third his feet Shadow'd from either heel with feather'd mail, Sky-tinctur'd grain! like Maia's son he stood And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance fill'd The circuit wide. Par. Lost, Book v. 276. Neither Raphaël nor Guido have painted a more graceful figure.Swift as the word, the duteous son of May Prepares th'almighty's orders to obey; First round his feet the golden wings he bound, That speed his progress o'er the seas profound, Or earth's unmeasur'd regions, as he flies, Wrap'd in a rapid whirlwind, down the skies. Then grasp'd the wand; the wand that calls the ghosts From hell, or drives 'em to the Stygian coasts, Invites or chases sleep with wond'rous pow'r, And opes those eyes that death had seal'd before. Thus arm'd, on wings of winds sublimely rode Thro' heaps of opening clouds the flying god. From far huge Atlas' rocky sides he spies, 363. Atlas, whose head supports the starry skies:] This description of Atlas, as a person, is very sublime and picturesque. There is a famous statue of Atlas, in the Farnese palace at Rome, supporting the globe of the heavens. From this description in Virgil, says Mr. Spence in his Polymetis, one might form a very good idea for a fountain statue; as perhaps it was, originally, taken from one.Atlas, whose head supports the starry skies: Beat by the winds and driving rains, he shrowds His shady forehead in surrounding clouds; With ice his horrid beard is crusted o'er; From his bleak brows the gushing torrents pour; Out-spread, his mighty shoulders heave below The hoary piles of everlasting snow. Here on pois'd pinions stoop'd the panting god; Then, from the steep, shot headlong to the flood. As the swift sea-mew, for the fishy prey, In low excursions skims along the sea, By rocks and shores, and wings th'aërial way; So, from his kindred mountain, Hermes flies Between th'extended earth and starry skies; Thus through the parting air his course he bore, And, gliding, skim'd along the Libyan shore. Soon as the winged god to Carthage came, He finds the prince forgetful of his fame: The rising domes employ his idle hours, Th'unfinish'd palaces and Tyrian tow'rs. A sword all starr'd with gemms, and spangled o'er With yellow jaspers, at his side he wore; A robe refulgent from his shoulders flow'd, That, flaming, deep with Tyrian crimson glow'd; The work of Dido; whose unrivall'd art With flow'rs of gold embroider'd every part. 389. To whom the god:] Upon Mercury's being sent to hasten Æneas from Carthage, Mr. Dryden breaks out into the following strange exclamation. Oh! how convenient is a machine sometimes in an heroic poem! This of Mercury is plainly one; and Virgil was constrained to use it here, or the honesty of his hero would be ill-defended. Mr. Spence has solidly and judiciously refuted this objection. I must own to you, that this very machine last mentioned, the introducing Mercury to oblige Æneas to pursue his voyage to Italy, which Mr. Dryden speaks of as such a forced one, seems to me to be particularly easy and obvious, and very well adapted. What the vulgar believed to be brought about by the will of their gods, the poets described as carried on by a visible interposition of those gods; and this to me seems the whole mystery of the machinery of the ancients.—When the gods are thus introduced in a poem, to help on any fact with which they are particularly supposed to be concerned, I call that machinery easy and obvious: and when the god thus introduced is the most proper that could be employed on that particular occasion, I call it well adapted. This I take to be the case in Virgil's introducing Mercury, on the occasion abovementioned. It was a supposed fact, among the Romans, that Æneas came into Italy in consequence of the will of heaven, and the express order of the gods, declared in oracles and prophecies. What they thus supposed, Virgil realizes. The fates, or will of heaven, in Virgil, is Jupiter giving his orders; and the declaration of it to Æneas is expressed by Mercury, (the usual messenger of the will of heaven) coming down to him; and giving him the orders he had from Jupiter. This machinery then is both obvious and well adapted: and we may add, that it could scarce be better timed, than when Æneas was at the greatest stop he met with in his whole voyage to Italy; and when he was most in danger of quitting his design. Polymetis, page 319. Dial. xx.To whom the god:—These hours canst thou employ To raise proud Carthage, heedless prince of Troy? Thus for a foreign bride to build a town And form a state, forgetful of thy own? The Lord of heav'n and earth, almighty Jove, With this command dispatch'd me from above; What are thy hopes from this thy long delay? Why thus in Libya pass thy hours away? If future empire cease thy thoughts to raise, Or the fair prospect of immortal praise; Regard Ascanius, prince, the royal boy; The last, the best surviving hope of Troy; To whom the Fates decree, in time to come, The long, long glories of imperial Rome. He spoke, and speaking left him gazing there; And all the fluid form dissolv'd in air. The prince astonish'd stood, with horror stung; Fear rais'd his hair, and wonder chain'd his tongue: Struck and alarm'd with such a dread command, He longs to leave the dear enchanting land. But ah! with what address shall we begin, How speak his purpose to the raving queen? A thousand thoughts his wavering soul divide, That turns each way, and strains on every side: A thousand projects labouring in his breast, On this at last he fixes as the best: 415. Mnestheus and brave Cloanthus] The critics on style have observed that Virgil, when he mentions the ancestors of three noble Roman families, turns Sergius, Memmius, and Cluentius, which might have degraded his verse too much, by their common and familiar use into Sergestus, Mnestheus, and Cloanthus. We find in our English writers (says Mr. Addison) how much the proper name of one of our own countrymen pulls down the language that surrounds it, and familiariseth a whole sentence. For our ears are so often used to it, that we find something vulgar and common in the sound and cant; and fancy the pomp and solemnity of style too much humbled and depressed by it. Dissertation on antient and modern learning.Mnestheus and brave Cloanthus he commands To rig the fleet, to summon all the bands In secret silence to the shore, and hide The sudden cause, that bids them tempt the tide. Then while fair Dido, sick with fond desire, Thinks such a boundless love can ne'er expire, Himself the proper measures will prepare To move the queen, and seize with watchful care The softest moments to address the fair. With speed impatient fly the chiefs away, And, fir'd with eager joy, the prince obey. But soon the fraud unhappy Dido spies; (For what can 'scape a lover's piercing eyes, Who e'en in safety fears with wild affright?) She first discern'd the meditated flight; And Fame, infernal fiend, the news conveys, The fleet was rigg'd and launching on the seas. Mad with despair, and all her soul on flame, Around the city raves the royal dame: So the fierce Bacchanal with frantick cries, Stung by the god, to proud Cithaeron flies, And shakes her ivy spear and raves around, While the huge mountain echoes to the sound. At length, by potent love and grief oppress'd, The queen, her recreant lover, first address'd: 440. Could'st thou hope, dissembler,] She begins with bitter revilings, but soon softens her tone, and falls into the most tender expostulations; begging him at least not to depart in the wintry season; reminding him of all their former fondness, and the vows they had made to each other; of the danger she exposed herself to, for his sake; of the loss of her fame and reputation on his account; of the destruction that will befal her kingdom, by Pygmalion; of her being forced to Iarbas's bed; concluding, that if notwithstanding all these moving considerations he is resolved to go, yet she begs him to stay at least, Till in my regal hall I may survey Some princely boy, some young Æneas play,And could'st thou hope, dissembler, from my sight, Ah! wretch perfidious! to conceal thy flight? In such base silence from my realms to sail? Nor can our vows and plighted hands prevail, Nor Dido's cruel death thy flight detain? For death, death only can relieve my pain: And are thy vessels launch'd, while winter sweeps With the rough northern blast the roaring deeps? Barbarian! say, if Troy herself had stood, Nor foreign realms had call'd thee o'er the flood, Would'st thou thy sails in stormy seas employ, And brave the surge to gain thy native Troy? Me will you fly, to tempt the dangerous wave? Ah! by the tears I shed, the hand you gave; (For these still mine, and only these remain; The tears I shed, the hand you gave in vain!) By those late solemn nuptial bands I plead, By those first pleasures of the bridal bed; If e'er, when folded in your circling arms, You sigh'd, and prais'd these now-neglected charms: If pray'r can move thee, with this pray'r comply, Regard, Æneas, with a pitying eye A falling race, and lay thy purpose by. For thee Numidian kings in arms conspire; For thee have I incens'd the sons of Tyre; For thee I lost my honour and my fame, That to the stars advanc'd my glorious name. Must I in death thy cruel scorn deplore, My barbarous guest!—but ah!—my spouse no more! What—shall I wait, till fierce Pygmalion pours From Tyre on Carthage, and destroys my tow'rs? Shall I in proud Iarbas' chains be led A slave, a captive to the tyrant's bed? Ah!—had I brought, before thy fatal flight, Some little offspring of our loves to light; If in my regal hall I could survey 476. Some princely boy, some young Æneas play;] I believe (says Mr. Bayle) our countesses and marchionesses would think they expressed themselves too much like city dames, ? Si quis mihi parvulus aulâ Luderet Æneas ? This is spoken in the spirit of the French critics; whose fastidious delicacy and false refinements render them incapable of relishing the lovely simplicity of the ancients, and make them despise the faithful paintings of nature. They would have every thing exactly conformable to modern manners and customs. Most of the complaints of de la Motte, Perrault, Fontenelle, and other unjust censurers of the antients, are entirely occasioned by their making no allowances for the very different practices and customs of different ages and nations.Some princely boy, some young Æneas play; Thy dear resemblance but in looks alone! I should not seem quite widow'd and undone. She said; the prince stood still in grief profound, And fix'd his eyes relentless on the ground; By Jove's high will admonish'd from the skies; At length the heroe thus in brief replies. Your bounties, queen, I never can forget; And never, never pay the mighty debt; But, long as life informs this fleeting frame, My soul shall honour fair Eliza's name. Then hear my plea:—By stealth I ne'er design'd To leave your hospitable realm behind; Forbear the thought;—much less in Libyan lands, A casual guest, to own the bridal bands. Had fate allow'd me to consult my ease, To live and settle on what terms I please; Still had I stay'd in Asia, to enjoy The dear, dear relicks of my native Troy: Rais'd royal Priam's ruin'd tow'rs again, A second Ilion for my vanquish'd train. But now, fair queen, Apollo's high command Has call'd me to the fam'd Italian land; Thither, inspir'd by oracles, I move, 500. There lies my country,] Æneas's reason for leaving Dido is the very strongest that could have been given to an heathen; “He had repeated commands from heaven to leave her, and therefore could not stay.” The reason why it sounds so weak to many of the modern critics must be; either from those who were then look'd upon as gods, being now seen in a ridiculous light; or from our critics not having so strong a notion of the interposition of providence, as the heathens had. I don't remember that any one of those critics has ever observed, that this speech is left unfinished by Virgil: and yet a good-natur'd critic, that was not satisfy'd with the reasons given, might well say; that Virgil probably had others in reserve, had he lived to complete his work. Spence.There lies my country, and there lies my love. If you your rising Carthage thus admire In these strange realms, a foreigner from Tyre, Why should not Teucer's race be free to gain The Latian kingdom, as the gods ordain? Oft as the stars display their fiery light, And earth lies cover'd in the shades of night, My father's angry spirit blames my stay, Stalks round my bed, and summons me away. Long has Ascanius call'd me hence in vain, By me defrauded of his destin'd reign. And now, ev'n now, the messenger of Jove (Both gods can witness) shot from heav'n above: Charg'd with the thunderer's high commands he flew, The glorious form appear'd in open view: I saw him pass these lofty walls, and hear His awful voice still murmuring in my ear. Then cease, my beauteous princess, to complain; Nor let us both be discompos'd in vain: From these dear arms to Latium forc'd away; 'Tis fate that calls, and fate I must obey. Thus while he spoke, with high disdain and pride She roll'd her wrathful eyes on every side, That glance in silence o'er the guilty man, And, all inflam'd with fury, she began: Pefidious monster! boast thy birth no more; No heroe got thee, and no goddess bore. No!—thou wert brought by Scythian rocks to day, By tigers nurs'd, and savages of prey; But far more rugged, wild, and fierce than they. For why, ah! why the traitor should I spare? What baser wrongs can I be doom'd to bear? 532. Did he once deign,] Here is a charming instance of the poet's exquisite art: He makes Dido in the heighth of her passion, turn suddenly from addressing Æneas in the second person, to speak of him in the third, as if he were absent. Genuit te cantibus ? Num fletu ingenuit? ? Afterwards she turns to him again, Neque te teneo, neque dicta refello, I sequere Italiam ventis, pete regna per undas. In the 545th line she again uses the third person as turning from him. Now great Apollo wants him to retire ? afterwards she again addresses him in the second person; Go then; I plead not, nor thy flight delay ? After her passion is worked up to the greatest height imaginable, and becoming too violent for her to support, the poet very naturally describes her fainting away, and carried off by her attendants.Did he once deign to turn his scornful eyes? Did he once groan at all my piercing sighs? Drop'd he one tear in pity to my cries? Calm he look'd on, and saw my passion burst. Which, which of all his insults was the worst? And yet great Jove and Juno from the sky Behold his treason with a careless eye; Guilt, guilt prevails; and justice is no more. The needy wretch just cast upon my shore, Fool as I was! with open arms I led At once a partner to my throne and bed; From instant death I sav'd his famish'd train, His shatter'd fleet I stor'd and rigg'd again. But ah! I rave;—my soul the furies fire; Now great Apollo warns him to retire; With all his oracles forbids to stay; And now through air the feather'd son of May Conveys Jove's orders from the blest abodes; A care well worthy to disturb the gods! Go then; I plead not, nor thy flight delay; Go, seek new kingdoms through the watry way: But there may every god, thy crime provokes, Reward thy guilt, and dash thee on the rocks; Then shalt thou call, amid the howling main, On injur'd Dido's name, nor call in vain; For, wrapt in fires, I'll follow through the sky, Flash in thy face, or glare tremendous by. When death's cold hand my struggling soul shall free, My ghost in every place shall wait on thee; My vengeful spirit shall thy torments know, And smile with transport in the realms below. With that, abrupt she took her sudden flight; Sick of the day, she loaths the golden light; And turns, while fault'ring he attempts to say Ten thousand things, disdainfully away; Sunk in their arms the trembling handmaids led The fainting princess to the regal bed. But though the pious heroe tries with care, And melting words, to sooth her fierce despair, Stung with the pains and agonies of love, Still he regards the high commands of Jove; Repairs the fleet; and soon the busy train Roll down the lofty vessels to the main. New-rigg'd, the navy glides along the flood; Whole trees they bring, unfashion'd from the wood, And leafy saplings to supply their oars, Pour from the town, and darken all the shores. So when the pismires, an industrious train, Embody'd, rob some golden heap of grain, Studious, e'er stormy winter frowns, to lay Safe in their darksom cells the treasur'd prey; In one long track the dusky legions lead Their prize in triumph through the verdant mead: Here, bending with the load, a panting throng With force conjoin'd heave some huge grain along: Some, lash the stragglers to the task assign'd; Some, to their ranks, the bands that lag behind: They crowd the peopled path in thick array, Glow at the work, and darken all the way. At that sad prospect, that tormenting scene, What thoughts, what woes were thine, unhappy queen! How loud thy groans, when from thy lofty tow'r Thy eyes survey'd the tumult on the shore; When on the floods thou heard'st the shouting train Plow with resounding oars the watry plain? To what submissions, of what low degree, Are mortals urg'd, imperious Love, by thee? Once more she flies to pray'rs and tears, to move Th'obdurate prince; and anger melts to love; Tries all her suppliant female arts again Before her death;—but tries 'em all in vain: 603. Sister, behold!] Here is a fine turn of passion. Dido's last speech was full of rage, anger, and indignation at her discovery of Æneas's design to leave her: now she softens her style, and falls into all the humble and supplicating arguments she could invent. The poet artfully makes the reader take notice of the change, Ire iterum in lacrymas, iterum tentare precando Cogitur, et supplex animos submittere amori. How moving is that part of this speech, where she desires her sister to tell Æneas, that she now does not presume to detain his voyage and keep him from his destin'd settlement, but that she only begs him to stay a little longer at Carthage, till she had learnt in some measure to subdue her grief; and overcome the unexpected blow; and till her bad fortune was grown more familiar to her mind.Sister, behold, from every side they pour With eager speed, and gather to the shore. Hark!—how with shouts they catch the springing gales, And crown their ships, and spread their flying sails. Ah! had I once foreseen the fatal blow, Sure, I had borne this mighty weight of woe. Yet, yet, my Anna, this one trial make For thy despairing, dying sister's sake. For ah! the dear perfidious wretch, I see, Lays open all his secret soul to thee. In all his thoughts you ever bore a part, You know the nearest passage to his heart. Go then, dear sister, as a suppliant go, Tell, in the humblest terms, my haughty foe, I ne'er conspir'd at Aulis to destroy, With vengeful Greece, the hapless race of Troy; Nor sent one vessel to the Phrygian coast, Nor rak'd abroad his father's sacred dust. From all the pray'rs a dying queen prefers, Why will he turn his unrelenting ears? Whither, ah whither, will the tyrant fly? I beg but this one grace before I die, To wait for calmer seas and softer gales To smooth the floods, and fill his opening sails. Tell my perfidious lover, I implore The name of wedlock he disclaims no more: No more his purpos'd voyage I detain From beauteous Latium, and his destin'd reign. For some small interval of time I move, Some short, short season to subdue my love; Till reconcil'd to this unhappy state, I grow at last familiar with my fate: This favour if he grant, my death shall please His cruel soul, and set us both at ease. Thus pray'd the queen; the sister bears in vain The moving message, and returns again. He stands inflexible to pray'rs and tears, For Jove and Fate had stop'd the heroe's ears. As, o'er th'aërial Alps sublimely spread, Some aged oak uprears his reverend head; This way and that the furious tempests blow, To lay the monarch of the mountains low; Th'imperial plant, tho' nodding at the sound, Tho' all his scatter'd honours strow the ground, Safe in his strength, and seated in the rock, In naked majesty defies the shock: High as the head shoots tow'ring to the skies, So deep the root in hell's foundation lies. Thus is the prince besieg'd by constant pray'rs: But though his heart relents at Dido's cares, Still firm the dictates of his soul remain, And tears are shed, and vows prefer'd in vain. Now tir'd with life abandon'd Dido grows; Now bent on fate, and harrass'd with her woes, She loaths the day, she sickens at the sky, And longs, in bitterness of soul, to die. To urge the scheme of death already laid, Full many a direful omen she survey'd: While to the gods she pour'd the wine, she view'd The pure libation turn'd to sable blood. 665. This horrid omen] These prodigies of the wine turned into blood, which Dido secretly observed (a very striking circumstance) and of Sichæus's voice, of the screams of the owl, the ancient predictions, and her melancholy dreams, are all admirably calculated to raise terror and pity, and must deeply affect every reader that has a feeling heart. The circumstance of the voice has been finely imitated by Mr. Pope, where Eloisa says— In each low wind methinks a spirit calls And more than echoes talk along the walls. Here as I watch'd the dying lamps around From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound: Come, sister, come, it said or seem'd to say, Thy place is here, sad sister, come away!This horrid omen to herself reveal'd, Ev'n from her sister's ear she kept conceal'd; Yet more—a temple, where she paid her vows, Rose in the palace to her former spouse; A marble structure; this she dress'd around With snowy wool; with sacred chaplets crown'd. From hence, when gloomy night succeeds the day, Her husband seems to summon her away. Perch'd on the roof the bird of night complains, In one sad length of melancholy strains; Now dire predictions rack her mind, foretold By prescient sages, and the seers of old; Now stern Æneas, her eternal theme, Haunts her distracted soul in ev'ry dream; In slumber now she seems to travel on, Through dreary wilds, abandon'd and alone; And treads a dark uncomfortable plain, And seeks her Tyrians o'er the waste in vain. 681. So Pentheus rav'd] Euripides, the most pathetic of all tragic writers whatever, seems particularly to have excelled in painting madness: Virgil has copied this simile from two of his tragedies: he has translated the very words: ??? ??? ???? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ????, ?????? ?? ?????, Et vero videre mihi duos quidem soles videor, duplicesque Thebas. This passage is found in the Bacchantes of Euripides. I have frequently wondered, that Longinus never quoted this description of the madness of Pentheus as an instance of the sublime. The description of the Bacchanalian women tearing Pentheus in pieces, for secretly inspecting their mysteries, is worked up with the greatest fire, and the truest poetical enthusiasm. And there is not a finer passage throughout the Greek tragedies. Theocritus has likewise nobly described this event. Longinus greatly admires the passage of Euripides from which Virgil imitated this description; and indeed human imagination can scarce conceive any thing painted so strongly ? ?????, ??????? ?? ?? []?????? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ???????????? ?????. ????? ???, ????? ??????? ????????? ???. A circumstance follows, which is most wonderfully moving, and which none of the critics (not even the excellent P. Brumoy) has taken any notice of. Orestes is held down upon a couch by his fond sister Electra, pierced with grief to see him in that distracted condition, and he mistakes her in his madness for one of his tormentors, and cries out; Away, thou that art one of my Furies, that perpetually haunt me, who hast now grasped me round my middle, that thou mayst hurl me down into hell. The Greek is inimitable. ?????—?? ???? ??? ???? ???????? ????? ?? ????????, ?? ????? ??? ????????.So Pentheus rav'd, when, flaming to his eyes, He saw the Furies from the deeps arise; And view'd a double Thebes with wild amaze, And two bright suns with rival glories blaze. So bounds the mad Orestes o'er the stage, With looks distracted, from his mother's rage; Arm'd with her scourge of snakes she drives him on, And, wrapt in flames, pursues her murdering son; He flies, but flies in vain;—the Furies wait, And fiends, in forms tremendous, guard the gate. At length distracted, and by love o'ercome, Resolv'd on death, she meditates her doom; Appoints the time to end her mighty woe, And takes due measures for the purpos'd blow. Then her sad sister she with smiles address'd, Hope in her looks, but anguish at her breast: Anna, partake my joy, for lo! I find The sole expedient that can cure my mind, Relieve my soul for ever from her pain, Or bring my lover to my arms again. Near Ocean's utmost bound, a region lies, Where mighty Atlas props the starry skies; There lives a priestess of Massylian strain, The guardian of the rich Hesperian fane; Who wont the wakeful dragon once to feed With honey'd cakes, and poppy's drowsy seed, That round the tree his shining volumes roll'd To guard the sacred balls of blooming gold. By magic charms the matron can remove, Or fiercely kindle all the fires of love; Roll back the stars; stop rivers as they flow; And call grim spectres from the realms of woe. Trees leave their mountains at her potent call; Beneath her footsteps groans the trembling ball: But witness thou, and all ye gods on high, With what regret to magic rites I fly. Go then, erect with speed and secret care, Within the court, a pile in open air. Bring all the traitor's arms and robes, and spread Above the heap our fatal bridal bed. The sacred dame commands me to destroy All, all memorials of that wretch from Troy. Thus with dissembling arts the princess spoke: A deadly paleness spreads o'er all her look. Nor could her wretched sister once divine These rites could cover such a dire design, Nor deem'd a lover treacherous to his vows Should more afflict her than her murder'd spouse; But rears a pile of oaks and firs on high, Within the court, beneath the naked sky. With wreaths the queen adorn'd the structure round; And with funereal greens and garlands crown'd: Next big with death, the sword and robe she spread, And plac'd the dear, dear image on the bed. 735. Amidst her altars,] That no circumstance of horror might be wanting to introduce the fate of this unhappy princess; to prodigies succeeds magic. The dismal solemnity and infernal religion of which exceedingly heightens the terror in the catastrophe of this tragedy. Thus far Dr. Trapp. One may here observe, the great superiority of Virgil's judgment to that of Lucan, who in his dreadful description of the incantations of Erictho has given full scope to the wildness of his extravagant imagination; exciting horror instead of terror.Amidst her altars, with dishevel'd hairs, Her horrid rites the priestess now prepares. Thund'ring she calls, in many a dreadful sound, On Chaos hoar, and Erebus profound; On hideous Hecate, from hell's abodes, (The threefold Dian!) and a hundred gods. The place she sprinkled, where her altars stood, With streams dissembled from Avernus' flood, And black envenom'd herbs she brings, reap'd down With brazen sickles, by the glimmering moon. Then crops the potent knots of love with care, That from the young estrange the parent mare. Now with a sacred cake and lifted hands, All bent on death, before her altar stands The royal victim, the devoted fair; Her robes were gather'd, and one foot was bare. She calls on every star in solemn state, Whose guilty beams shine conscious of her fate: She calls to witness every god above, To pay due vengeance for her injur'd love. 755 'Twas night; and, weary] This exquisite description can never be sufficiently admired. Virgil describes minutely and at length the profound calm, quiet, and stillness of the night, in order to render the cruel disturbances and agonies of the restless queen more affecting by such a contrast. At non infelix animi Phoenissa—is the finest turn that ever entered the imagination of a poet. Virgil never makes a description for the sake of the fine verses it may contain, or to shew his talent of painting well, but always in order to heighten some passion, and further the action of the poem. He took the hint of this description of the profound quiet of night, opposed to Dido's restlessness, from Apollonius Rhodius.'Twas night; and, weary with the toils of day, In soft repose the whole creation lay. The murmurs of the groves and surges die, The stars roll solemn through the glowing sky; Wide o'er the fields a brooding silence reigns, The flocks lie stretch'd along the flow'ry plains; The furious savages that haunt the woods, The painted birds, the fishes of the floods; All, all, beneath the general darkness, share In sleep, a soft forgetfulness of care; All but the hapless queen;—for love denies Rest to her thoughts, and slumber to her eyes. Her passions grow still fiercer, and by turns With love she maddens, and with wrath she burns. The struggling tides in different motions roll, And thus she vents the tempest of her soul: 771. What shall I do!] The image of this unhappy princess, reasoning with herself in the dead of night, is deeply moving. She turns her thoughts on every side to try if she can meet with succour or redress, but finds it impossible. She first thinks of applying to her former lovers, but soon rejects that expedient as absurd. Next she talks of accompanying the Trojans, but finds this every jot as unreasonable; and one reflexion which awakens her pride, is extremely natural— Suppose I went with them, ? The haughty sailors would but mock my woe. Neither, continues she, could I possibly persuade the Tyrians to pursue them as enemies.—Nothing can be done! no expedient can avail me! Die then as thou deserv'st; in death repose; her endeavouring afterwards to lay the fault on her sister is a fine touch of nature. And her concluding that all her misfortunes are owing to the breach of her vows is beyond expression charming. Non servata fides cineri promissa Sichæo. I cannot forbear adding, that this soliloquy, tho' pretty long, is yet extremely natural. How different from the generality of soliloquies introduced by the modern writers of tragedy! the management of which kind of speeches requires the utmost caution and care to make them appear natural; and surely they should be introduced as seldom as possible.What shall I do?—shall I in vain implore The royal lovers I disdain'd before? Or, slighted in my turn with haughty pride, Court the fierce tyrant whom I once deny'd? Shall I the Trojans base commands obey, Their slave, their suppliant, through the watry way? Yes—for my bounties, and my former aid By Troy already stand so well repaid! And yet suppose I were inclin'd to go; The haughty sailors would but mock my woe. Hast thou not yet, not yet, Eliza, known The perjur'd sons of proud Laomedon? What!—shall I follow through the roaring main, Sole and abandon'd, their triumphant train, Or drive 'em through the deeps with sword and fire, With all my armies, all the sons of Tyre? But can I draw to sea those Tyrian bands I drew reluctant from their native lands? Die then as thou deserv'st; in death repose; The sword, the friendly sword, shall end thy woes. You first, dear sister, by my sorrows mov'd, Expos'd me rashly to the wretch I lov'd; Your prompt obedience, and officious care Fann'd the young flame, and plung'd me in despair. Oh! had I learn'd like savages to rove, And never known the woes of bridal love! I prov'd unfaithful to my former spouse, And now I reap the fruits of broken vows! Thus vents the mournful queen, by love opprest, The grief that rag'd tumultuous in her breast. Meantime with all things ready for his flight, In thoughtless sleep the heroe past the night. 803. To whom again] To justify Æneas's departure still more, another messenger is sent from heaven to hurry him away, who tells him that if he does not set out immediately while the wind is favourable, he, and his whole fleet, will be destroyed by the Tyrians, whom Dido is animating to revenge.To whom again the feather'd Hermes came, His youthful figure, looks, and voice the same, And thus alarms the slumb'ring prince once more; What—canst thou sleep in this important hour? Nor all thy dangers canst thou yet survey? Nor hear the zephyrs call thee to the sea? Mad as thou art!—determin'd on her doom, She forms designs of mischiefs yet to come. Then fly her fury while thou yet canst fly, Before Aurora gilds the purple sky; Fly,—or the floods shall soon be cover'd o'er With numerous fleets, and armies crowd the shore, And direful brands with long-projected rays, Shall set the land and ocean in a blaze. Ev'n now her dread revenge is on the wing; Rise, prince; a woman is a changeful thing. This said; at once he took his rapid flight, Dissolv'd in air, and mingled with the night. The heroe starts from sleep in wild surprize, Struck with the glorious vision from the skies, And rouses all the train: awake, unbind, And stretch, my friends, the canvas to the wind; 825. Seize, seize,] In the first book of Virgil, says the judicious Bossu, Æneas appears to be very pious, and more forward to execute the will of the gods, than any other thing whatever. In the fourth book a very difficult choice is proposed to him; on one side, gratitude, love, natural tenderness, and several weighty considerations, engage him not to part from Dido; on the other side, an express order of the gods commands him to Italy. Before any one sees what side he will adhere to, and on what he will resolve, that which he has said ought to have demonstrated what his will, and what his inclinations are, and to what he will determine his conduct. His former speeches which discover to me his future resolutions are the poetical manners; these make one foresee that he would leave Dido and obey the gods; he does so; the manners then are good, and duly and justly ordered. Chap. iv. B. 4.Seize, seize your oars; the god descends again, To bid me fly, and launch into the main. Whoe'er thou art, thou blest celestial guide, Thy course we follow through the foamy tide; With joy thy sacred orders we obey; And may thy friendly stars direct the way. Sudden, he drew his sword as thus he said, And cut the haulsers with the flaming blade; With the same ardor fir'd, the shouting train Fly, seize their oars, and rush into the main. At once the floods with ships were cover'd o'er, And not one Trojan left upon the shore; All stretching to the stroke, with vigour sweep The whitening surge, and plow the smoaking deep. 839. Now o'er the glittering lawns, &amp;c.] Let us admire this fine stroke of nature. The queen who had spent the night in disquietude, possessed with a thousand alarming fears that her lover would leave her, rises at the very first glympse of daylight, (ut primum albescere lucem vidit) and ascends a high watch tower to view whether her fears were well-grounded or not, and the first thing that struck her eye was the navy in full sail.Now o'er the glittering lawns Aurora spread Her orient beam, and left her golden bed. Soon as the queen at early dawn beheld The navy move along the watry field, In pomp and order, from her lofty tow'r; And saw th'abandon'd port, and empty shore; 845. Thrice her fierce hands in madness] This action of the unhappy queen is exceedingly moving and pathetic; and is a most proper introduction to the passionate speech that follows. Bossu has some judicious observations on this passage. That which is so rare among the orators is common among the poets: they abound in instances of this kind, where one may see the passion prepared, and kept up by the actions. Dido begins her speech, “O Jupiter! what shall this stranger go off? &amp;c. This is no surprize to the hearers; they were so well prepared for it, that they would have wondered if the beginning of this speech had been less passionate. The practice of Seneca is quite contrary. If he has any recital to make, which ought to imprint some great passion or other; he takes away both from his personages and his audience all the inclinations they might have towards it. If they are possessed with the sorrow, fear, and expectation of some dreadful thing: he will begin by a fine and elegant description of some place or other, which only serves to shew the copiousness and the over-luxuriant wit of a poet without judgment. In the Troades, Hecuba and Andromache, wanted to hear of the barbarous death of Astyanax, whom the Greeks had thrown from the top of an high tower. It mightily concerned them indeed to know, that among the crowd that flocked from all quarters to that sad spectacle, some there were who stood on the ruins of the old decayed buildings, others whose legs trembled under them, because they were mounted so high. Those who have the patience to speak or hear such idle stuff, are so little inclined to weep, that they stand in need of notice, as the mercenary mourners of old had, when it is time to begin uttering their lamentations.Thrice her fierce hands in madness of despair Beat her white breast, and tore her golden hair. Then shall the traitor fly, ye gods! (she said) And leave my kingdom, and insulted bed? And shall not Carthage pour in arms away? Run there, and launch my navies on the sea. Fly, fly with all your sails, ye sons of Tyre; Hurl flames on flames; involve his fleet in fire. What have I said?—ah! impotent and vain! I rave, I rave—what madness turns my brain? Now can you, Dido, at so late a time, Reflect with horror on your former crime? Well had this rage been shown, when first you led The wretch, a partner to your throne and bed. This is the prince, the pious prince, who bore His gods and relicks from the Phrygian shore! And safe convey'd his venerable sire On his own shoulders through the Trojan fire! Could I not tear, and throw him for a prey, 864. Monster of the sea] This is finely added, the original says only, undis spargere.Base wretch! to every monster of the sea? 865. Son destroy] As Atreus did the sons of Thyestes his brother, a famous subject among the ancient tragedians. M. Crebillon, hath written a noble tragedy on this subject, and hath found a method of softening the extreme horror of the story, yet in such a manner as still to excite terror and pity, to a great degree.Stab all his friends, his darling son destroy, And to his table serve the murder'd boy? For, bent on death, and valiant from despair, Say—could I dread the doubtful chance of war? No—but my flames had redden'd all the seas; Wrapt all the flying navy in the blaze; Destroy'd the race, the father and the son, And crown'd the general ruin with my own. 873. Thou glorious sun!] After all the foregoing rage and madness, and variety of passion, expressed in the most rapid style, with short quick sentences, questions, exclamations, &amp;c. in the very next words, between which and the following she must be imagined to have paused, and panted, and taken breath; she cools and settles, falls into the long and slow style, and prays for plagues upon the head of her false lover, with such religious formality, and solemnity of horror, as is enough to chill one's blood, while one reads it. Sol, qui terrarum flammis, &amp;c. And so goes on cursing and imprecating to the end of the speech. Trapp. I must add that the finest part of these curses seems to begin with that line Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor Servius thinks the aliquis points to Annibal. Without doubt Virgil had in his head the bloody and fatal Punic wars. It is an usual practice in the ancient tragedians, to make their heroes call upon the sun just before they died. There is a very sublime instance of this in the Ajax of Sophocles, the speech that hero makes to the sun just before he falls upon his sword is worth the perusal of the reader of taste; especially where he bids the sun stop in his career, when he comes over his country, and related his calamities to his aged father and mother. ?? ??? ??? ????? ????? ??????????, ????, ??????? ?? ??? ???? ????? ????, ?????? ?????????? ?????, ??[]????? ???? ??? ???? ????? ?? ???? ??????? ???[], ?? ?? ??????? ?????.

Ajax, v. 856.Thou, glorious sun! whose piercing eyes survey These worlds terrestrial in thy fiery way, And thou, o Juno! bend thy awful head, Great queen, and guardian of the bridal bed; Hear thou, dire Hecate! from hell profound, Whose rites nocturnal through the streets resound, Hear all ye furies, fiends, and gods, who wait To pay due vengeance for Eliza's fate! If to the destin'd port the wretch must come, If such be Jove's unalterable doom: Still let him wander, toss'd from place to place, Far from his country, and his son's embrace, By barbarous nations harrass'd with alarms; And take the field with unsuccessful arms; For foreign aid to distant regions fly, See all his friends a common carnage lie; And when he gains, his ruin to compleat, A peace more shameful than his past defeat; Nor life nor empire let him long maintain, But fall, by murderous hands untimely slain, And lie unburied on the naked plain! This vow, ye gods, Eliza pours in death, With her last blood, and her last gasping breath! Oh!—in the silent grave when Dido lies, 897. Thou great avenger] This plainly points out Annibal.Rise in thy rage, thou, great avenger, rise! Against curs'd Troy, go mighty son of Tyre, Go, in the pomp of famine, sword, and fire! And you, my Tyrians, with immortal hate, In future times, pursue the Dardan state. No peace, no commerce with the race be made: Pay this last duty to your princess' shade; Fight, when your pow'r supplies so just a rage; Fight now, fight still, in every distant age; By land, by sea, in arms the nation dare, And wage, from son to son, eternal war! This said, she bends her various thoughts to close Her hated life, and finish all her woes. Then to her husband's nurse she gave command, (Her own lay bury'd in her native land) Go, Barce, go, and bid my sister bring The sable victims for the Stygian king, But first be sprinkled from the limpid spring. Thus let her come; and, while I pay my vows, Thou too in fillets bind thy aged brows. Fain would I kindle now the sacred pyre, And see the Trojan image sink in fire. Thus I compleat the rites to Stygian Jove, And then farewell—a long farewell to love! She said; the matron, studious to obey, With duteous speed runs trembling all the way. 923. Now to the fatal court] To paint, is not only to describe things: but to represent the circumstances of them, in such a lively sensible manner, that the hearer shall fancy he almost sees them with his eyes. For instance: if a dry historian were to give an account of Dido's death, he would only say; she was overwhelm'd with sorrow after the departure of Æneas; and that she grew weary of her life: so she went up to the top of her palace; and lying down on her funeral pile, she stabb'd herself. Now these words would inform you of the fact; but you do not see it. When you read the story in Virgil, he sets it before your eyes. When he represents all the circumstances of Dido's despair; describes her wild rage; and death already staring in her aspect: when he makes her speak at the sight of the picture and sword that Æneas left, your imagination transports you to Carthage; where you see the Trojan fleet leaving the shore, and the queen quite inconsolable. You enter into all her passions, and into the sentiments of the supposed spectators. It is not Virgil you then hear: you are too attentive to the last words of unhappy Dido, to think of him. The poet disappears: and we see only what he describes; and hear those only whom he makes to speak. Such is the force of a natural imitation, and of painting in language. Hence it comes that the painters and the poets are so nearly related: the one paints for the eyes, and the other for the ears: but both of them ought to convey the liveliest pictures to the imagination. I have taken an example from a poet to give you a fuller image of what I mean by painting in eloquence: for poets paint in a stronger manner than orators. Indeed the main thing in which poetry differs from eloquence is, that the poet paints with enthusiasm, and gives bolder touches than the orator. But prose allows of painting in a moderate degree: for, without lively descriptions 'tis impossible to warm the hearer's fancy, or to stir his passions. A plain narrative does not move people: we must not only inform them of facts; but strike their senses, by a lively moving representation of the manner and circumstances of the facts we relate. Archbishop of Cambray on Eloquence, Dial. i. p. 74.Now to the fatal court fierce Dido flies, And rolls around her fiery glaring eyes; Though pale and shivering at her purpos'd doom, And every dreadful thought of death to come: Yet many a crimson flush, with various grace, Glows on her cheek, and kindles in her face. Furious she mounts the pyre, and draws the sword, 930. Present] The sword, say the best critics, was given by Dido to Æneas, not vice versa, and Æneas had left it in his chamber.The fatal present of the Dardan lord; For no such end bestow'd;—the conscious bed, And robes she view'd; and tears in silence shed; 933. Stood still, and paus'd a moment,] No circumstance can be imagined more pathetic and moving, than her stopping, and bursting into tears at the sight of the bed and the Trojan robes, and then throwing herself in an agony upon the well-known couch. There is something of cool and sedate despair in this last of her speeches that is wonderfully affecting.Stood still, and paus'd a moment,—then she cast Her body on the couch, and spoke her last: Ye dear, dear relicks of the man I lov'd! While fate consented, and the gods approv'd, Relieve my woes, this rage of love controul, Take my last breath, and catch my parting soul. My fatal course is finish'd, and I go A ghost majestic to the realms below. Well have I liv'd to see a glorious town Rais'd by these hands, and bulwarks of my own; Of all its trophies robb'd my brother's sword, And on the wretch reveng'd my murther'd lord. Happy! thrice happy! if the Dardan band Had never touch'd upon the Libyan land. 947. Then pressing with her lips] Fondly taking leave of it, as Alcestes does of her bed in Euripides. But Catrou, who indeed follows Ruæus, gives, I think, a strange interpretation, and says it means biting the bed with rage and revenge. Ruæus says, Os lecto imprimens rabie quadam furoris, inultam se mori dolet. Surely the other interpretation is more moving.Then pressing with her lips the Trojan bed, Shall I then die, and unreveng'd? (she said,) 949. And thus, and thus, I go—] This repetition of the word sic is vastly beautiful: it strongly imprints on the mind the action of Dido at that moment: one sees her strike the ponyard into her bosom twice, when she says, and thus, and thus I go. The commentators, intent on grammatical constructions, more than poetical beauties, have strangely puzzled this plain and obvious passage. Even Mr. Cowley seems not to have understood it, is for omitting this hemistich, and having the verse end—sed moriamur ait.Yet die I will,—and thus, and thus, I go— Thus—fly with pleasure to the shades below. This blaze may yon' proud Trojan from the sea, This death, an omen of his own, survey. Meantime, the sad attendants, as she spoke, 954. Beheld her strike,] Here is a fine touch of art in the poet, he does not expressly say that Dido stabbed herself, but with the most beautiful brevity only tells us, ? ferro Collapsam aspiciunt comites ? passing on instantly to the effect.Beheld her strike, and sink beneath the stroke. At once her snowy hands were purpled o'er, And the bright faulchion smoak'd with streaming gore Her sudden fate is blaz'd the city round; The length'ning cries from street to street resound; To female shrieks the regal dome replies, And the shrill echoes ring amidst the skies; 961. Fair Carthage,] Here he seems plainly to allude to the sacking and burning Carthage by the Romans under Scipio, after the three bloody Punic wars.As all fair Carthage, or her mother Tyre, Storm'd by the foe, had sunk in floods of fire; And the fierce flame devour'd the proud abodes, With all the glorious temples of the gods. Her breathless sister runs with eager pace, And beats her throbbing breast, and beauteous face. Fierce through the parting crowds the virgin flies, And on her dying dear Eliza cries. Was this, my Dido, ah! was this the way You took, your easy sister to betray? Was it for this my hands prepar'd the pyre, The fatal altar, and the funeral fire? Where shall my plaints begin?—ah! wretch undone! Now left abandon'd to my woes alone! Was I unworthy then, to yield my breath, And share thy sweet society in death? Me, me you should have call'd, your fate to share From the same weapon, and the same despair. And did these hands the lofty pile compose? Did I invoke our gods with solemn vows? Only—ah cruel! to be sent away From the sad scene of death I now survey? You by this fatal stroke, and I, and all, Your senate, people, and your Carthage fall. Bring, bring me water; let me bathe in death Her bleeding wounds, and catch her parting breath. 987. Then up the steep ascent she flew,] The original says, sic sata, gradus evaserat altos, she was got to the top of the steps while she was speaking these words, and she spoke them as she was going up. Otherwise, it would be highly unnatural, for her to stop and not run immediately to her sister's assistance 'till she had finished a speech of eight or ten verses.Then up the steep ascent she flew, and prest Her dying sister to her heaving breast; With cries succeeding cries her robes unbound, To stanch the blood that issu'd from the wound. Her bosom groaning with convulsive pain, 992. She strives to raise,] How moving these circumstances are of her striving to open her eyes and fainting away again, and endeavouring to raise herself on her elbow and falling back again, no reader of taste need be told! Her not being able to speak and answer her sister is very moving. The poet's intending to enlarge a little here was perhaps the reason why he so artfully passed over the manner of her stabbing herself, which we before took notice of.She strives to raise her heavy lids in vain, And in a moment sinks, and swoons again. Prop'd on her elbow, thrice she rear'd her head, And thrice fell back, and fainted on the bed; Sought with her swimming eyes the golden light, And saw the sun, but sicken'd at the sight. Then mighty Juno, with a melting eye, Beheld her dreadful anguish from the sky; And bade fair Iris, from the starry pole, Fly, and enlarge her agonizing soul: For as she dy'd by love before the time, Nor sell by fate, nor perish'd for a crime, Not yet had Proserpine, with early care, Clip'd from her head the fatal golden hair; The solemn offering to the pow'rs below, To free the spirit, and relieve her woe. Swift from the glancing sun the goddess drew A thousand mingling colours, as she flew: Then radiant hover'd o'er the dying fair; And lo; this consecrated lock I bear To Stygian Jove: and now, as heav'n ordains, Release thy soul from these corporeal chains. The goddess stretch'd her hand, as thus she said, And clipt the sacred honours of her head; The vital spirit flies, no more confin'd, 1017. Mingles with the wind,] By way of concluding the notes on this fourth book I shall subjoin what the judicious Segrais hath said concerning the anachronism in Virgil's making Dido contemporary with Æneas—“Not pretending of myself, to decide a question, which requires so much learning, I am content to admire with Tasso (whether Æneas were contemporary with this queen, or not) the admirable invention of Virgil, who was able to find out in the history of this hero, a source of the hatred between Rome and Carthage, even in the very foundation of their walls. I cannot moreover upon this occasion dissemble my opinion, that of all the faults which a poet can commit, those which are against profound learning are the least considerable: and especially when the question turns only upon a point of learning, obscure, ancient, or embarrassed, as this did; which related to the antiquity of eleven hundred years, at a time when books were not so easily perpetuated as they are at present. For tho' a poet ought to be learned; yet we never desire him to be more learned, than delightful. That great judgment, which made rules, has reserved to itself the empire over them; and never intended to be enslaved by them. Besides; if the general maxim of poetry be always to prefer that which is probable, and pleasing, to that which is true, and shocking; why had not Virgil the power to suppose by a poetical fiction that Dido lived in the time of Æneas, even tho' he knew the contrary; in order to find in this fable the original of those wars between Rome, and Carthage, and the subject of those beautiful events which he describes? Why shall he be condemned for having made a fiction contrary to the order of time; if other poets are sometimes permitted to make them, contrary to the order of nature? would he have been the less a poet, tho' he had never learned chronology? there are no faults, properly so called, says Aristotle, but those which are made contrary to the art which one professes: insomuch that there are certain affected ignorances, which appear with a good grace. Extremes only are faulty in this case, as well as in all others. It would not have been allowable to contradict a point of history known to all the world: for example, to make Scipio and Hannibal contemporaries with Alexander, and to represent them as intimate friends. But in this profound antiquity, which one must study as profoundly, in order to strike out the least light from it, a great poet may, and should, speak of things, not as he can discover them to have really been, but as they are capable of embellishing his subject. It is for this, that he is even advised to chuse a subject distant from his own age, rather than too near it. The beauty of these boldnesses raises poetry above learning itself; for it is more easy to learn how things have actually passed, than by invention to make them agreeable. A man may study as long as he will; he will never make a good poem, if he has not a genius to feign and invent. Provided his inventions please, (as they always do, when they are natural, and the event answers, as in this fiction of Virgil's) the work will always succeed. For questionless, if we should ask those who are most forward to decry this passage, whether they would have had him follow the history; their thoughts must be very ill turned to chuse rather that he should have deprived his Æneis of this rich ornament, than have contradicted an history involved in the darkness of so many barbarous ages. The most critical will allow, that there is more judgment in committing this fault, if it be one, than there would have been in not committing it. This is the opinion of Scaliger; and of Mr. Bochart, as may be seen in a learned dissertation upon this argument, which he did me the honour to address to me. If a poet must be subject to the exact truth; he carries the matter much farther than this anachronism: and I believe it would be difficult to prove that Æneas was ever in Italy, against those strong authorities which he produces to the contrary. But he himself answers, and concludes, as I do, that this research of truth is by no means the business of a poet. The very foundation of the Æneis may be no more than a fable; and he is of that opinion for three strong reasons. The first is grounded upon the explication of some passages in Homer; and upon the testimonies of ancient history: which relate that Æneas died before the walls of Troy, and that he left children which reigned there for many ages. The second is taken from the religion of the Trojans, and the gods which Æneas must have brought into Italy, of which he finds not the least traces in the antiquities of Rome. The third is taken from the Phrygian or Trojan language; which he would likewise have brought with him and of which some words must have continued in the Latin tongue, as well as of the languages of other nations, with which the Romans had any intercourse or correspondence. But tho' he establishes his opinion upon very good arguments; he shews nevertheless that this great poet was in the right in founding his Æneis upon a contrary Opinion, since it was universally received at Rome. For this purpose, he shews that it was received, more than two hundred years before, by all the poets, historians, orators, and criticks: that even several Greek authors were of the same sentiments: not to mention Julius Cæsar, and Augustus his adopted son; who deeply interested themselves in authorizing this chimæra; to make it believed that that the family of the Cæsars was descended from Æneas, and by consequence from Venus and Jupiter; which rendered them the more considerable among the people, who fed themselves with the flattery of these vain imaginations. He proves that the consent of the senate and the people confirmed this belief: and that all the Romans presumed themselves to be descended from the Trojans.— In a word, he concludes, as I have done upon the subject of this anachronism, that tho' Virgil had fully known the falsity of this opinion, he ought not to have opposed it; since the state and the emperor loved this error, and were interested to support it: and it is not the business of poets to teach exact truth. He discusses this question with so much learning, and so much at large; that I will say no more of it. This reflection is so far from destroying the beauty of poetry, and its inventions; that it discovers them to the greater advantage. Their charms are so powerful and irresistible, that they overbear the clearest evidence and the most glaring truth. These fables, these lyes, these impostures, become the admiration and entertainment of the whole world, and in process of time the general opinion of the people. We are so prejudiced in their favour, that we hate those who are willing to maintain the contrary. If one compares the effects of the finest history with those of the finest poetry; what are those beautiful truths which history has ever made so publick, as poetry has made it's fictions? How many persons are there who have read Virgil and Homer, and even learned the greatest part of their works by heart, in comparison of those (tho' many) who have read the best Greek, or Latin historians?” Segrais.Dissolves in air, and mingles with the wind. The End of the Fourth Book. VOL. III. BOOK the Fifth I have frequently wondered at the judgment of the celebrated Montagne, who says, he esteemed this book of the Æneid, to be the most perfect and beautiful of the whole twelve. 'Tis not to be disputed that it contains many and various beauties, but being purely descriptive, and not at all applying to the passions, it can never interest the reader so deeply, nor engage his attention so strongly, as several other parts of the poem must do, if he has any feeling or sensibility. As to the nature and character of this fifth book, I shall transcribe a long passage from Monsieur Segrais, in which are many valuable observations. “The same reason, says he, which caused the variety I took notice of in the first book, upon the description of that pleasant place and retired harbour which the poet presents to the reader, immediately after the picture of the dreadful tempest, was doubtless the cause of that variety which we find between this fifth, and that which precedes it. The poet, judicious throughout, having imagined the representation of these sports would be a great embellishment to his work, because it is a subject capable of much ornament, judged farther, that he could no where better insert it, than in this place, to make an agreeable contrast to what he had treated of in the fourth book; not doubting but that it was requisite to recreate the spirits of his reader, grieved and afflicted by the tragical death of Dido. That beautiful order which is remarkable through his whole poem, discovers itself particularly in the detail of this book: These sports, varied by the diversity of their own nature, are still more so by his manner of relating them, by the different scene, and the different success, and by the rewards proportioned exactly to the dignity of the contention, and the quality of the contenders. The actions of the hero are conducted with no less judgment. The poet considered, that the person whom he would propose as a pattern to others, ought not to be regarded in the most sublime and important actions only: He thought fit, after the example of Homer, to humanize his hero a little; and to shew him as well in sports and diversions, as in other more striking occurrences of civil life. Let any one then consider the equity, and humanity, which accompanies all his actions; and all the decencies which he is made to observe.”—Dr. Trapp adds to these excellent remarks, “Though these recreations are diverting, yet there is nothing in them light or trifling: He is a hero even in sports, and his very mirth is majestic. What an air of grandeur is in “Risit pater optimus olli! &amp;c. “Kings are sometimes merry; but then they are merry like Kings.” The ARGUMENT. Æneas setting sail from Africk, is driven by a storm on the coasts of Sicily, where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of part of the island, and born of Trojan parentage. He celebrates the memory of his father with divine honours, institutes funeral games, and appoints prizes for those who should conquer in them. While the ceremonies were performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan women to burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them; which burnt four, and would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter by a sudden shower extinguished it. Upon this, Æneas, by the advice of one of his generals, and a vision of his father, builds a city, for the women, old men, and others, who were either unfit for war, or weary of the voyage; and sails for Italy. Venus procures of Neptune a safe voyage for him and all his men, excepting only his pilot Palinurus, who was unfortunately lost. Now with a prosp'rous breeze, Æneas held His destin'd course, and plough'd the watry field; Unhappy Dido's funeral flames surveys, That gild the spires, and round the bulwarks blaze; But soon the hidden cause the prince divin'd From the known transports of a female mind; With such a whirl their fiery passions move, In the mad rage of disappointed love! Now o'er the deep the rapid gallies fly, And the vast round was only wave and sky. A cloud all charg'd with livid darkness spreads, Blackning the floods, and gathering o'er their heads. Aloud the careful Palinurus cries; Lo! what a dreadful storm involves the skies! Oh! Neptune, mighty father of the main! What tempests threaten from thy watry reign? Then he commands to furl the sails, and sweep With every bending oar the foamy deep. Himself, to break the blast, his sails inclin'd, And fled obliquely with the driving wind. Oh! mighty prince, the trembling master cry'd, Scarce could I hope, in such a tossing tide, To reach Hesperia and surmount the flood, Tho' Jove had past the promise of a God. See! from the west what thwarting winds arise! How in one cloud are gathered half the skies! In vain our course we labour to maintain, And, struggling, work against the storm in vain. Let us, since fortune mocks our toil, obey, And speed our voyage, where she points the way. For not far distant lies the realm, that bore Your brother Eryx, the Sicilian shore, If right I judge, whose eyes with constant care Have watch'd the heav'ns, retracing every star. I see, reply'd the prince, thy fruitless pain, That long has struggled with the winds in vain. Then change thy course, the whirling gusts obey, And steer with open sails a different way. Oh! to what dearer land can I retreat? There I may rig again my shatter'd fleet: That land my father's sacred dust contains, And there my Trojan friend, Acestes reigns. This said, they steer their course; the western gales With friendly breezes stretch their bellying sails; Smooth o'er the tides the flying navy past, And reach'd with joy the well-known shore at last. Ver. 47. The King—The very dress and appearance of this monarch, prepare the reader for his character and behaviour.The king with wonder from a mountain's brow Beheld the fleet approach the coast below; Then, with a javelin in his hand, descends, Clad in a lion's spoils, to meet his friends. This monarch sprung from great Crinisus' flood; His Trojan mother mingling with the god. With due regard he hails the kindred train, Arriv'd from Carthage at his realms again; With feasts their fainting spirits be restor'd; And rural viands crown'd the generous board. Now the diminish'd stars had fled away Before the glories of the dawning day. His friends Æneas summon'd from the coast; Then from a rising point bespoke the host: Ye far-fam'd sons of Troy, a race divine, Whose fathers sprung from Jove's immortal line, Ver. 63. Now the full circle of the year runs round.—To confirm the opinion of the critics that the action of the Æneid is comprized in one year, Catrou hath given us the following calculation: “1. I suppose that it is a point founded on history, that Troy was sacked in the month of May; or, at farthest, in the month of June. 2. I suppose again, that Æneas stayed two months, or thereabouts, at Antandros, to build his fleet; and that he did not go from thence till the month of March, in the year which followed the taking of Troy. 3. I suppose moreover, that Æneas was four years and some months in passing the seas, and in making his unsuccessful settlements in Thrace and Crete. In my note 7 on book 3. I have observed, that the hero spends one lustrum in his voyages from Antandros: This lustrum contains four full years. The Trojan fleet left Antandros in the month of March: The Actian games are celebrated about the Dog-days in the month of August. Thus the four years and some months are exactly made out. 4. I suppose that the Trojans did not leave Epirus till August; and indeed, at their departure from this last place Virgil tells us, that the sea gave marks of the approaching winter, Et glacialis hyems aquilonibus asperat undus. This cannot be said of any other month than October, or November at least. 5. I farther suppose, that Æneas could hardly arrive at Drepanum before January: The vessels took up not more than two months in sailing into the Adriatic gulf; and, after that, in coasting all the Italian shore, and in searching for Drepanum in the Tyrrhene sea. 6. I lastly suppose, that Æneas was in Sicily the eleven months remaining, till the month of November, with which the Æneid opens.” According to the foregoing computation, January was the month in which Æneas arrived at the port of Sicily, where he lost his father. It very evidently appears, from the poet's own narration, that Anchises died in February; and that his anniversary was kept in the same month; which I thus prove. Æneas parted from Carthage in the depth of winter, Hyberno moliris sidere classem: This is what Dido reproaches him with: This certainly could mean no other time than the end of January. According to this supposition Æneas stayed but three months at Carthage; that is, from November to the end of January. As to what remains, we cannot possibly prove, that his stay was longer; and nothing can induce us to believe that it was. So that when he arrives in Sicily, that is to say, at the beginning of February, he declares that very day to be the anniversary of his father: It therefore follows, that his father died in February. Æneas afterwards spends one month in the celebration of the games, after leaving Sicily a second time to sail for Italy, whither he arrives at the beginning of the spring. This last point is plain, from the singing of the birds, and the serenity of the sky, which began to look clear, cum venti posuere. For the rest, the wars of Æneas in Italy till the death of Turnus, lasted from the beginning of the April, when he came into Italy to the November following. According to this plan, we may determine the Æneid to be comprized within the course of one solar year.Now the full circle of the year runs round, Since we dispos'd my sire in foreign ground, Rais'd verdant altars to the mighty shade, And paid all funeral honours to the dead: And now the fatal day is just return'd, By me (so Heav'n ordains) with rites adorn'd, For ever honour'd, and for ever mourn'd; Tho' banish'd to the burning Libyan sand, Tho' led a captive to the Argive land, Tho' lost and shipwreck'd on the Grecian sea, Still would I solemnize this sacred day. Sure all the friendly pow'rs our course inspire, To the dear relics of my reverend sire. Haste then, the new-adopted god adore, And from his grace a prosp'rous gale implore; Implore a city, where we still may pay, In his own fane, the honours of the day. On every ship two oxen are bestow'd By great Acestes of our Dardan blood; Call to the feast your native Phrygian pow'rs, With those the hospitable king adores. Soon as the ninth fair morning's opening light Shall glad the world, and chace the shades of night, Then to my Trojans I propose, to grace These sacred rites, the rapid naval race; Then all, who glory in their matchless force, Or vaunt their fiery swiftness in the course, Or dart the spear, or bend the twanging bow, Or to the dreadful gauntlet dare the foe, Attend; and each by merit bear away The noble palms, and glories of the day. Now grace your heads with verdant wreaths, he said; Then with his mother's myrtle binds his head. Like him, Acestes, and the royal boy Adorn their brows, with all the youth of Troy. Ver. 98. Now to the tomb—It is astonishing, that not one of the critics and commentators have perceived the design which the poet undoubtedly had, in this episode of the apotheosis of Anchises, and in the description of the games which are celebrated at his tomb. It is Augustus that Virgil represents here under the character of Æneas. The pious Augustus, by the apotheôsis (or deification) with which he honoured Julius Cæsar his father, and by the games which he caused to be performed to celebrate this new god; gave Virgil an occasion of inventing this episode, and of making these games and honours the subject of one entire book. This appears very charming, even to us at present; although the commentators have taken no notice of the relation it bore to Augustus. But how much more interesting and delightful must it have been to Augustus himself, and the Romans of that age, who remember'd that they themselves performed the same things for Julius Cæsar, which the poet makes Æneas perform in honour of Anchises.Now to the tomb surrounded with a throng, A mighty train, the heroe past along. Two bowls of milk, and sacred blood he pours; Two of pure wine; and scatters purple flow'rs. Then thus—Hail sacred sire, all hail again, Once more restor'd, but ah! restor'd in vain! 'Twas more than envious fate would give, to see The destin'd realms of Italy with thee; Or mighty Tyber's rolling streams explore, The sacred flood, that bathes th'Ausonian shore. Scarce had he said, when, beauteous to behold! From the deep tomb, with many a shining fold, Ver. 110. An azure serpent rose in scales.— There are many beautiful descriptions of this animal in the Æneid of Virgil, and in the Georgies likewise. M. Segrais is of opinion, that there are indeed too many of the same creature. There are few passages in Ovid, finer than his picture of the serpents, into which Cadmus and Æsculapius were transformed. Under this head it would be unpardonable to omit Milton's exquisite description of the tempting serpent, which far exceeds that of any poet whatever. ? not with indented wave Prone on the ground, as since; but in his rear, Circular base of rising folds, that towr'd Fold above fold, a rising maze; his head Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes: With burnish'd neck of verdant gold, erect Amid his circling spires, that on the grass Floted redundant: ? Book 9. v. 496.An azure serpent rose, in scales that flam'd with gold: Like heaven's bright bow his varying beauties shone That draws a thousand colours from the sun: Pleas'd round the altars and the tomb to wind, His glittering length of volumes trails behind. The chief in deep amaze suspended hung, While through the bowls the serpent glides along; Tastes all the food, then softly slides away, Seeks the dark tomb, and quits the sacred prey; Astonish'd at the sight, the heroe paid New rites, new honours to his father's shade, Doubts if the dæmon of his sire rever'd, Or the kind genius of the place appear'd. Five sable steers he slew with rites divine, As many snowy sheep, and bristly swine; And pouring wine, invok'd his father's shade Sent from the darksome regions of the dead. Then all the train, who gather'd round the grave, Each for his rank, proportion'd treasures gave. The altars blaze; the victims round expire; Some hang the massy cauldrons o'er the fire: Some o'er the grass, the glowing embers spread; Some broil the entrails on the burning bed. Now bright the ninth expected morning shone; Now rose the fiery coursers of the sun. When endless crowds the vast assembly crown'd From all the wide dispeopled country round. Some rous'd by great Acestes' mighty name, Some to behold the Trojan strangers came, Some to contend, and try the noble game. In view, amid the spacious circle, lay The costly gifts, the prizes of the day. Arms on the ground, and sacred tripods glow, With wreaths and palms to bind the victor's brow. Silver and purple vests in heaps are roll'd, Rich robes, and talents of the purest gold; And from a mount the sprightly trump proclaims To all the gather'd croud the glorious games. Ver. 148. Four well-match'd gallies.— The chariot-race is that which Homer has most laboured in his games, of which Virgil being sensible, he most judiciously avoided the imitation of what he could not improve, and substituted in its place the naval course or ship-race. It is in this, the Roman poet has employed all his force, as if on set purpose to rival his great master; but it is extremely observable, how constantly he keeps Homer in his eye, and is afraid to depart from his very track, even when he had vary'd the subject itself. Accordingly the accidents of the naval course have a strange resemblance with those of Homer's chariot-race. He could not forbear at the very beginning, to draw a part of that description into a simile. Do not we see he has Homer's chariots in his head, by these lines? Non tam praecipites, &amp;c.— Ver. 144. What is the encounter of Cloanthus and Gyas in the strait between the rocks, but the same with that of Menelaus and Antilochus in the hollow way? Had the galley of Sergestus been broken, if the chariot of Eumelus had not been demolished? Or, had Mnestheus been cast from the helm, had not the other been thrown from his seat? Does not Mnestheus exhort his rowers in the words Antilochus had used to his horses? Nec jam prima peto Mnestheus neque vincere certo, Quanquam O! sed superent quibus hoc Neptune dedisti; Extremos pudeat rediisse! hoc vincite, cives, Et prohibete nefas!— ???????? [] ???? ?????????? ???? ??????? ???? ??? ????????? ???????? ???? ?????, ??????? ??????? ?????????, ????? ????? ??? ????? ????? ? &amp;c. ?. Upon the whole, the description of the sea-race, I think, has the more poetry and majesty; that of the chariots, more nature and lively incidents. There is nothing in Virgil so picturesque, so animated, or which so much marks the characters, as the episodes of Antilochus and Menelaus, Ajax and Idomeneus, with that beautiful interposition of old Nestor.—On the other side, in Virgil the description itself is nobler; it has something more ostentatiously grand, and seems a spectacle more worthy the presence of princes and great persons. Pope's notes on the 23d Iliad.Four well-match'd gallies first, by oars impell'd Drawn from the navy, took the watry field. Ver. 150. Mighty Mnestheus.—'Tis surprizing that Virgil, who marks the origin of three very illustrious families of Rome, the Sergiens, the Memmians, and Cluentines, hath omitted the family of the Geganians, who were derived from Gyas. Catrou.In the swift Dolphin mighty Mnestheus came, Mnestheus, the founder of the Memnian name. Next Gyas in the vast Chimera sweeps (Huge as a town) the hoarse-resounding deeps: Ver. 154. Three rows of oars.—It is incontestable, that Virgil here describes one of those three-oared galleys of the ancients; concerning which much is said by many Greek and Roman writers. It must be owned likewise, that in the time of Æneas, this sort of vessel was not in use, since it was invented long afterwards by Aminocles of Corinth. This is an anachronism, which is to be imputed but as a slight fault to the poet. Catrou.Three rows of oars employ the panting train, To push th'enormous burthen o'er the main. Sergestus in the Centaur took his place, The glorious father of the Sergian race. In the blue Scylla great Cloanthus rode, The noble source of our Cluentian Blood; Far in the main a rock advances o'er The level tides, and fronts the foamy shore, That hid beneath the rolling ocean lies, When the black storms involve the starry skies, But in a calm its lofty head displays To rest the birds who wing the spacious seas. Here the great heroe fixt an oaken bough, A mark, that nodded o'er the craggy brow; To teach the train to steer the backward way, And fetch a shorter circle round the sea: Then, rank'd by lot, conspicuous o'er the flood, The chiefs array'd in gold and purple glow'd. The youths green poplars round their temples twine, And bright with oil their naked bodies shine, Eager, they grasp their oars, and list'ning wait the sign. Thick in their hearts alternate motions play, Now prest with beating fears they sink away, Now throb with rising hopes to win the glorious day. Soon as the trump the first shrill signal blew, All, in a moment, from the barrier flew: Turn'd by their labouring oars the surges rise, And with their shouts the sailors rend the skies, The foamy tides with equal furrows sweep; And, opening to the keel, divides the hoary deep. Not half so swift the fiery coursers pour, And, as they start, the distant plain devour; Nor half so fierce the drivers, pois'd in air, Urge the fleet steeds to whirl the flying car, Throw up the reins, and, bending o'er the yoke, Shout, lash, and send their souls at every stroke. The crouds in parties join; and, to the cries And eager shouts, the hollow wood replies; While hills to hills repeat the mingled roar, And the long echo rolls around the winding shore. With peals of loud applause from every side First Gyas flew, and shot along the tide. Cloanthus follows, but his pond'rous ship, Tho' better mann'd, moves heavier on the deep. Behind, the Dolphin and the Centaur lay, At equal distance, on the watry way: Now darts the rapid Dolphin o'er the main, Now the vast Centaur wins the day again: Then, side by side, and front by front, they join, And plow in frothy tracks the ruffled brine. And now proud Gyas reach'd th'appointed place, A while the victor of the watry race; Then to Menætes call'd, and gave command, Ver. 207. Leave the right.—The word palmula in the original signifies the extremity of the oar, which being made broad, resembles a man's hand. Ver. 207. Against the land.—Horace has a like expression with Littus ama, in the original, amatque janua limen. L. 1. Od. 25.To leave the right, and steer against the land; Let others plow the deep;—in vain he spoke; The cautious pilot dreads the lurking rock, And turns his prow, and steers a different road, And leaves the shallows for the open flood. Once more in vain the raging Gyas cry'd, And lo! that moment, brave Cloanthus spy'd Close at his back, who plow'd the nearer tide. The dangerous way the daring heroe took Between bold Gyas and the sounding rock. Sudden beyond the chief he shoots away, Clear of the goal, and gains the roomy sea. Then Gyas wept; and grief and rage enflame The youth, forgetful of his friends and fame, From the high stern, with anger and disdain, He hurl'd the hoary master in the main; Then madly took himself the sole command, And fir'd his train, and bore upon the land. Hoary with age, and struggling long in vain, With cumb'rous vests, Menætes mounts again; Trembling he climb'd a lofty rock; and dry'd His limbs, all drench'd and reeking with the tide. Ver. 229. Loud laugh'd the crowds, &amp;c.—Mr. Addison having observed that pleasantry, or ridiculous images are below the dignity of epic poetry, adds, “That there is but one laugh in the whole Æneid, and that is on this passage. But this piece of mirth, says he, is so well tim'd, that the severest critic can have nothing to say against it: for it is in the book of games, where the reader's mind may be supposed to be sufficiently relaxed for such an entertainment.” Spectator, N?. 279.Loud laugh'd the crowds to see him shoot away, Drink and disgorge by turns the briny sea. At distance Mnestheus and Sergestus lie; Both hope to pass the fiery Gyas by. The 'vantage first the bold Sergestus took, With rapid speed advancing to the rock; But not a length before: the Dolphin rides With rival speed, and bears upon her sides. Brave Mnestheus now inflames his naval crew, As o'er the deck from man to man he flew. My brave associates, in whose aid I trust, You, whom I chose, when Ilion sunk in dust, Now shew the strength and spirit once you shew'd, When raging storms, and Syrtes you withstood, Plow'd Malea's tide, and stem'd th'Iönian flood: Now, now, my friends, your utmost pow'r display, Rise to your oars, and sweep the watry way: Nor strive we now the victory to gain, Tho' yet!—but ah! let those the palm obtain, Those, whom thy favours crown, great monarch of the main! But to return the lags of all the day! Oh! wipe, my friends, that shameful stain away! Fir'd at the word, each other they provoke; Springs the swift ship at every vigorous stroke. With painful sweat their heaving bodies stream; Thick pant their hearts, and trembles every limb. All bending to their oars the labour ply; The sea rolls backward, and the surges fly. Now, with the wish'd success they toil to gain, Indulgent fortune crowns the lab'ring train; For while the fierce Sergestus nearer drew, And in a scanty space too rashly flew, (His road still narrower) with a mighty shock He rush'd against the sharp projected rock. Then flew the shatter'd oars, and flying rung, And on the rugged sides the vessel hung. To gain their floating oars, with mingled cries, All arm'd with iron poles, the sailors rise. Fir'd with success, along the open seas Proud Mnestheus shoots, invoking every breeze. As in her nest, within some cavern hung, The dove sits trembling o'er her callow young, Till rous'd at last by some impetuous shock, She starts surpriz'd, and beats around the rock; Then to the open field for refuge flies, And the free bird expatiates in the skies; Her pinions pois'd, thro' liquid air she springs, Ver. 276. And smoothly glides,— This line in the original is often quoted, as one of the most beautiful instances that can be produced of the sound's being an echo to the sense; Radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas. The translator has endeavoured to imitate this beauty, and has succeeded in his attempt.And smoothly glides, nor moves her levell'd wings: So, joyful Mnestheus darts without controul O'er the wide ocean, and approach'd the goal; So the swift Dolphin flies in open view, And gain'd new strength, new swiftness as she flew. First by Sergestus' ship he shoots along, That in the shelves and dang'rous shallows hung; With cries the chief his rival's aid implores, And strives in vain to row with shatter'd oars. Next fiery Gyas he with shouts pursu'd, Who, in the huge Chimæra stem'd the flood; She yields, depriv'd of her experienc'd guide; And sees her rival fly triumphant o'er the tide. Now, near the port, with all his pow'r he strains To pass Cloanthus, who the last remains. The doubling shouts inspires him as he flies And the long peal runs rattling round the skies: These, flush'd with pride, would cast their lives away, Ere they resign the glories of the day: Those, by success, in strength and spirit rise, And their fierce hopes already win the prize. Thus haply both with level beaks had ply'd The surge, and rode the victors of the tide; But brave Cloanthus o'er the rolling floods Stretch'd wide his hands, and thus invok'd the gods: Ye pow'rs! on whose wild empire I display My flying sails, and plow the watry way; Oh! hear your suppliant, and my vow succeed; Then on these shores a milk-white bull shall bleed; And purple wine your silver waves shall stain, And sacred victims glut the greedy main. Thus he—and every Nereid heard the vow, Ver. 308. With mighty Phorcus—The Nereids were the daughters of Phorcus, who was the son of Neptune by Thisca. Portunus, who is sometimes called Palemon, or Melicertes, was the god that presided over havens.With mighty Phorcus from the deeps below. And great Portunus, with his ample hand, Push'd on the rapid galley to the land. Swift as the hissing javelin cuts the skies, Swift as a whirlwind, to the port she flies. And now the herald's voice proclaims aloud Cloanthus victor, to the shouting crowd. The mighty prince himself, with verdant boughs Of vivid laurel, binds the hero's brows. Three steers, and one large talent are bestow'd On every rival crew, that plow'd the flood. But to the glorious leaders, bold and brave, The generous chief distinguish'd honours gave. A robe the victor shar'd, where purple plays, Mixt with rich gold, in every shining maze. Ver. 323. There royal Ganymede.—The description of this beautiful piece of tapestry is extremely picturesque. The circumstances of the boys panting, the old men lifting up their hands, and above all, the dogs looking up and barking after him, are painted in the liveliest manner imaginable. There is a very fine painting by Michael Angelo on this subject, who has exactly copied Virgil's description, except that he hath omitted the circumstance of the dogs.There royal Ganymede, inwrought with art, O'er hills and forests hunts the bounding hart; The beauteous youth, all wondrous to behold! Pants in the moving threads, and lives in gold: From tow'ring Ida shoots the bird of Jove, And bears him struggling thro' the clouds above; With out-stretch'd hands his hoary guardians cry, And the loud hounds spring furious at the sky. On Mnestheus next, the chief who bore away The second glorious honours of the day, A shining mail the generous prince bestows, That, rich with clasps of gold, refulgent glows, Who stript Demoleus of the costly load In Trojan fields, by Simois' mighty flood: Two labouring servants, with united toil And strength conjoin'd, scarce heaved th'enormous spoil: Yet in these arms of old, with matchless might, The swift Demoleus chac'd his foes in fight. This mail, Æneas gave the chief to bear, A sure defence and ornament in war. The next rich presents mighty Gyas grace, Two ponderous cauldrons of refulgent brass; Two silver goblets, wrought with art divine, That rough, and bright with sculptur'd figures shine. Proud of their gifts the lofty leaders tread, And purple fillets glitter on their head. When, from the rock scarce disengag'd with pain, Sergestus brings his shatter'd ship again. Ver. 351. One side all maim'd.— The following passage in Terence, among many others, is justly admired for its strength and elegant expressiveness: almost every word being emphatical. Quod ille unciatim vix de dimenso suo, suum defraudans genium, comparsit miser. Phormio Act &amp; Scen 1. And to match it out of Virgil, says Dr. Trapp, we may, among many others, produce this: Cum saevo e scopulo multâ vix arte revolsus Amissis remis, atque ordine debilis uno, Irrisam, sine honore, ratem Sergestus agebat. Here too is scarce a word without a strong and elegant emphasis. Saevo, multâ, vix, arte, revolsus, amissis remis, ordine debilis uno, irrisam, sine honore, agebat. And the last line is so slow and heavy, that one can hardly shove it along as one reads it.One side all maim'd, she slowly moves along, Spoil'd of her oars amid the hooting throng: As when a lingring fate the serpent feels, Obliquely crush'd beneath the brazen wheels, Or, bruis'd and mangled by the cruel swain With some huge stone, writhes with the shooting pain, And rolls and twists her scaly folds in vain. Above, all fierce her glittering volumes rise, Flames in her crest, and lightning in her eyes; But maim'd below, and tardy with the wound, Her train unfolded drags along the ground. So maim'd and slow the shatter'd gally past, But aided by her sails she reach'd the port at last. Pleas'd with the vessel and the crew restor'd, The generous prince rewards their hapless lord. The promis'd present to the chief he gave; Ver. 367. Cretan slave.—A female slave, especially a fruitful one, was deemed no mean present by the ancients: Sergestus was very well rewarded; nay, rather better than his adversary. This was to comfort him in his misfortune. A fine stroke of character in Æneas! Catrou.Pholoe, the beauteous female Cretan slave, In works of art superior to the rest, And proud of two fair infants at the breast. This contest o'er; with thousands in his train, Mov'd the great heroe to a spacious plain. High hills the verdant theatre surround; And waving woods the mighty circuit crown'd. Hither, with all the crowds the prince withdrew, And took his sylvan throne in open view. Here costly gifts the chief propos'd, to grace Ver. 377. Rapid race.—The foot race was a military exercise: the young Roman soldiers were instructed in it, according to Vegetius. Agility being of great use in war. Catrou.The spritely youths that urge the rapid race. Now throng the Trojan and Sicilian band; Ver. 379. And first Euryalus and Nisus stand.—The introducing these two youths in this place, is very judicious in the poet, as it in some measure prepares the reader for the important part they are to act in the beautiful episode in the ninth book.And first Euryalus and Nisus stand; That, for his youthful charms admir'd by Troy; This, for chaste friendship to the beauteous boy. Next to the contest, warm with hopes of fame, Of Priam's royal race, Diores came. Salius and Patron then in order past; Epirus one, and one Arcadia grac'd. Brave Helymus and Panopes succeed; Two valiant youths in fair Trinacria bred; Who with Acestes drove the savage race From wood to wood, long practis'd to the chace. And mighty numbers more, unknown to fame, Advance in crowds to share the glorious game. High in the midst Æneas rear'd his head, And oh! attend, ye generous youths, (he said;) Of all who try the fortune of the day, Not one shall go without a gift away. With two bright Cretan lances, each shall share An ax with silver grav'd, to shine in war. Distinguish'd gifts and olive wreaths shall grace The three triumphant victors of the race. On the first youth a courser I bestow, Whose trappings rich with gold and purple glow: The next a quiver charg'd with shafts shall claim, Such as adorns an Amazonian dame; Clasp'd by a gem, refulgent to behold, Shines the bright trophy with a belt of gold. On the proud youth this gift shall be conferr'd: And this fair Argive helm shall grace the third. This said, they took their place; the trumpet blew; And all impetuous from the barrier flew: Fierce as a tempest, o'er the plain they past From the first space, and gain upon the last. First Nisus sprung, and left the crowd behind, Swift as the lightning, or the wings of wind. Next, but the next with many a length between, Young Salius skim'd along the level green. Euryalus, the third, scarce touch'd the plain; Behind, bold Helymus his rival ran; But, hovering o'er him, runs Diores nigh; Now side by side, and foot by foot they fly. The youth had conquer'd in a longer way, Or undecided left the honours of the day. And now they just approach'd with rapid pace, Tir'd with the toil, the limit of the race, When Nisus fell amid the slippery plain, Drench'd with the copious blood of victims slain. His feet no more the shouting victor held; Aloft they fly, and quiver on the field. Headlong he fell, with mud all cover'd o'er, And every limb was stain'd with sacred gore. Yet, as he weltred on the ground, he strove To shew Euryalus his ardent love. Ver. 432. For now, ev'n now, the youth his body threw.— I am of opinion, that in this foot-race, Homer has shewn more judgment and morality, than Virgil. Nisus in the latter is unjust to his adversary, in favour of his friend Euryalus; so that Euryalus wins the race by palpable fraud; and yet the poet gives him the first prize: whereas Homer makes Ulysses victorious, purely through the mischance of Ajax, and his own piety in invoking Minerva. Pope's notes on the 23. B. Iliad. However this may be, one cannot but be charmed at the manner with which Virgil keeps up the characters of all the persons he introduces. Of which this action of Nisus in striving to be as serviceable to his friend as he possibly could, is a beautiful instance.For now, ev'n now, the youth his body threw Before his rival Salius, as he flew: He fell, and on the ground extended lay; Thus, favour'd by his friend, sprung swift away The young Euryalus, and won the day. At once beyond the goal the victor flies; Shouts of applause tumultuous rend the skies. Next Helymus, and next Diores came With eager ardor, now the third in fame. Now Salius fills the ring with clam'rous cries, By turns to every hoary judge applies, Storms at the fraud, and claims the rightful prize. But favour, winning tears, and youthful grace Plead for the boy, the victor of the race. Diores too, before the partial crowd, Defends the young Euryalus aloud; Who now must urge his claim, should Salius gain The first proud honours, to the third in vain. Thus then the prince—In order shall we pay To each brave youth the prizes of the day: Since these are shar'd, permit me to extend One proof of pity to a hapless friend: This said, on Salius generous he bestow'd A lion's yellow spoils, (a costly load!) With martial pride his shoulders to infold; Rough was the dreadful mane, the paws were sheath'd in gold. When Nisus thus,—If such high presents grace Salius who fell, first vanquish'd in the race, What gift shall I receive, who bore away, And still had held the honours of the day, Had not that fortune, which my foe o'erthrew, Befaln unhappy Nisus as he flew? Then show'd his robes and face with blood defil'd: Th'indulgent father of the people smil'd, And caus'd a mighty buckler to be brought, With art divine by Didymaon wrought; Great Neptune's gates the prize adorn'd in Troy, Now the bright present loads the favour'd boy. These gifts bestow'd; the heroe cries aloud, Stand forth, ye valiant champions, from the crowd; Who vaunt your courage and unrivall'd might, Ver. 473. And with the gauntlet.—There is a curious particular in M. Segrais, who informs us, that one of the best judges in France always told him, during the time he was translating Virgil, that he thought it impossible for him to make this combat of the cæstus, read agreeably in the French language: that their language was utterly incapable of lifting such a subject into a tolerable dignity. That translator, however, has acquitted himself gracefully; and one must do the justice to Mr. Pitt, to own he has greatly excelled in this passage, how difficult soever it might be to clothe such ideas in modern language.And with the gauntlet dare provoke the fight. Then he propos'd, in gold and garments gay, A Bull, to grace the victor of the day. Next, to relieve the loser's shame and pain, Cast a rich sword and helmet on the plain. Strait with a shout, supremely tall and strong, Bold Dares rear'd his bulk above the throng; Ver. 480. The youth, who dar'd withstand, The fierce tempestuous sway of Paris' hand. It may seem surprising, that Paris, who is looked upon by most people as an effeminate person, and distinguished as being merely Helen's gallant, should in this place be mentioned as a hero, expert in the cæstus, and endued with the strength of a giant. The commentators answer to this objection, that Paris had been bred up to the business of a shepherd, and thence had acquired that robust habit of body which the poet here gives him. Other authors, beside Virgil, speak of his skill in this art, as Hyginus, Fab. 91, Servius, Ovid, &amp;c. Segrais.The youth, the only youth, who dar'd withstand The fierce tempestuous sway of Paris' hand, Who on huge Butes prov'd his matchless might At Hector's tomb, victorious in the fight; (Butes, of Amycus' Bebrycian strain,) And stretch'd th'enormous giant on the plain. Thus, glorying in his strength, in open view His arms around, the tow'ring Dares threw, Stalk'd high, and laid his brawny shoulders bare, And dealt his whistling blows in empty air. His match was sought; thro' all a terror ran; All gaz'd and trembled at the mighty man. Despair, he thought, had seiz'd the circling bands; And now before the prince the champion stands; Fierce by the horns the beauteous bull he took, And in proud triumph to the heroe spoke: Since none, oh! chief, accept the proffer'd fray, Why for his coward foe must Dares stay? Permit me, prince, to lead my rightful prize away. The Trojans clamour with applauding cries, And for the youth demand the promis'd prize. Then to Entellus old Acestes said, Who sate beside him on the flow'ry bed; Entellus!—once the bravest on the plain, But ah! the bravest, and the best in vain! With such tame patience can my friend survey This prize, without a contest, borne away? Where, where is now great Eryx' vaunted name; The god, who taught our thundr'ing arms the game, The spoils that grace thy roof, and all thy former fame? I am not dead, replies the chief, to praise, Nor yield to fear, but sink by length of days. My nerves unstrung, my strength no more remains, And age creeps shiv'ring thro' my icy veins. Had I that vigor still, my youth could boast, Or yon' vain champion vaunts to all the host, Soon should this arm that insolence chastize, For fame alone, without the proffer'd prize. Ev'n now I scorn the combat to decline; The prize I heed not; let the fame be mine! This said; amid the ring, in open view, Two mighty gauntlets on the ground he threw: These grac'd great Eryx in the fight of old, And brac'd his arms with many a dreadful fold: Seven thick bull-hides, their volumes huge dispread, Pond'rous with iron and a weight of lead. The host stood all astonish'd at the sight, But Dares most, who now refus'd the fight: The heroe turns the folds, in wonder stands, And pois'd th'enormous gauntlets in his hands. How had you wonder'd, the bold champion said, Had you the huge Herculean arms survey'd? Had you those pond'rous gloves of death beheld, And the stern combat on this fatal field? These, prince, of old your brother Eryx wore, Lo! you behold 'em still distain'd with gore. With these Alcides' force he long sustain'd, And these I brandish'd, while my strength remain'd, Ere the cold hand of envious age had shed These marks of winter on my hoary head. Yet, if your champion trembles at the sight, Nor dares to meet these gauntlets in the fight; If so Æneas and the king incline; Lo! to his fears these weapons I resign: With equal arms the combat we will try; And thou, lay thou, thy Trojan gauntlets by. This said, the heroe strait his robe unbound, And cast the double garment on the ground; Bares his huge brawny limbs, and on the sands, Dreadful to view, the hoary champion stands. Then the great prince with equal gauntlets bound Their vigorous hands, and brac'd their arms around: Their arms, that moment, each impetuous foe Rear'd high in air, and rose to every blow; And, while their raging hands the fight provoke, Withdraw their heads from each tempestuous stroke. This on his youth and active speed relies, That on his bulk and tall gigantick size: But each vast limb moves stiff and slow with age; And thick short pantings shake the lab'ring sage. Each, but in vain, a thousand strokes bestows; Their sides and breasts re-echo to the blows. With swift repeated wounds their hands fly round Their heads and cheeks; their crackling jaws resound: Unmov'd Entellus, with a stedfast look And watchful eye, avoids the furious stroke. The youth invests his foe with all his pow'r, As some brave leader a beleaguer'd tow'r, When on the bull-warks in his rage he falls, And plants his engines round th'embattled walls; On every side with fruitless skill and pain, Eager he tries a pass or post to gain, And storms the rocky battlements in vain. And now his aim the bold Entellus took, With his huge hand, high brandish'd for the stroke; The youth observ'd the long-descending blow, And leaps aside, and disappoints the foe: The stroke was spent in air; with dreadful sound Prone fell the champion thund'ring to the ground. A pine thus tumbles to the vales below From Ida's top, or Erymanthus' brow. At once the Trojans and Sicilians rise, And with divided clamours rend the skies. And first Acestes, touch'd with pity, ran To raise his friend and old compeer again. Swift from the fall, and with redoubled might Sprung the fierce heroe, and renew'd the fight; Improv'd in spirit, to the combat came, While conscious valour sets his soul on flame, Stung with disgrace, and more enrag'd with shame. Now headlong o'er the field he drove the foe, And rose in strength and wrath at every blow. Now a thick storm of strokes around him flies, Thick as the hail comes rattling from the skies; With both his thund'ring hands the blows he ply'd, And turn'd his giddy foe on every side. Then flew the good Æneas, to asswage The hero's wrath, and check the mighty rage: From death he snatch'd the champion, and began To soothe the sorrows of the vanquish'd man: Ver. 600. What madness, hapless Dares.—This combat with the cæstus is in great part a verbal translation from Homer. But it must be owned in favour of Virgil, that he has varied from Homer in the event of the combat with admirable judgment, and with an improvement of the moral. Epeus and Dares are described by both poets as vain boasters; but Virgil, with more poetical justice, punishes Dares for his arrogance, whereas the presumption and pride of Epeus is rewarded by Homer. Ver. 600. What madness—The address of Æneas, on this occasion, is remarkable: he does not persuade the combatant to desist, because of his inferior strength or courage; but tells him, that the gods are on the side of his enemy.What madness, hapless Dares, has possest Thy thoughtless mind, and fir'd thy daring breast? Thy rival see, sustain'd by pow'r divine, By other strength, and mightier force than thine? Cease then, and give the vain contention o'er; Cease, and oppose the hand of heaven no more! The youth now drags his trembling legs along; His loose head tott'ring o'er his shoulders hung, Giddy with pain; he now ejects the blood, His loosen'd teeth come mingled in the flood: While in their arms his sad associates bore The batter'd champion groaning to the shore, The dear-bought sword and helmet brought away, And left the palm and bull the victor's prey. Now great Entellus, glorying in the prize And flush'd with conquest, thus, exulting cries; Behold, ye Trojans, and thou, chief divine, What vigor, in the bloom of youth, was mine; From what a thund'ring arm and fatal blow, Your timely mercy has preserv'd my foe. With that the chief, collected in his might, Confronts the victim, the reward of fight; Then rais'd his hand aloft, and from above, With dreadful sway, the pond'rous gauntlet drove Through the broad forehead of the stately bull, And dash'd within the brain the batter'd skull. The bull, convulsive with the deadly wound, Ver. 627. Groans—tumbles—rolls— There is a beauty in the original which no English translation can possibly come up to; for by the very cadence of the verse, Virgil represents the dead fall of this heavy animal, ? Procumbit humi bos. The reader may see several excellent instances of the sound's being an echo to the sense, in Vida's Poetics, or in Pope's Essay on Criticism.Groans, tumbles, rolls, and quivers on the ground. Then thus the hoary chief performs his vow, Eryx, on thee this victim I bestow; A nobler victim than my Trojan foe! To younger champions now the game I yield; Here hang my conquering arms; and here renounce the field. Ver. 633. Next the great prince.— This shooting-match (says Mr. Pope) is also a direct copy; but with the addition of two circumstances, which make a beautiful gradation. In Homer, the first archer cuts the string that held the bird, and the other shoots him as he is mounting. In Virgil, the first only hits the mast which the bird was fixed upon, the second cuts the string, the third shoots him; and the fourth, to vaunt the strength of his arm, directs his arrow up to heaven, where it kindles into a flame, and makes a prodigy. This last is certainly superior to Homer, in what they call the wonderful: but what is the intent or effect of this prodigy, or whether a reader is not at least as much surprized by it, as at the most unreasonable parts of Homer, I leave to those criticks who are more inclined to find fault than I am? Catrou has taken a great deal of pains to vindicate this circumstance that so much displeases Mr. Pope; the most remarkable and ingenious thing he urges in its vindication (though perhaps too far fetched) is, that the arrow of Acestes burning in the air was a presage of the ensuing accident, the firing of the ships. If I might be allowed to add one strained conjecture to another, might not one say, that this prodigy of the arrow burning, may distinctly hint at the Julium Sidus?Next the great prince propos'd the prize to those, Who wing'd the shafts, and bent the twanging bows. Amid the spacious plain the heroe plac'd Sublime in air Sergestus' lofty mast; Around the tap'ring top a dove they tye, The trembling mark at which their arrows fly; Hither to try their skill the warriors haste; And in a brazen helm the lots are cast. First, with applause, Hippocoon's lot was thrown, The mighty Hyrtacus' illustrious son. Mnestheus the next, whom verdant olives grace, The second victor in the naval race. Then the third chance to great Eurytion came, Thy brother, Pandarus, renown'd by fame, Whose hand by Pallas prompted, drew the bow, To break the truce against the Grecian foe. Last in the helm remain'd Acestes' name; Old as he was, he try'd the youthful game. Then every chief, with all his strength and art, Bent the tough bow, and chose the feather'd dart. Thro' yielding air first vanish'd with a spring Hippocoon's arrow from the sounding string: Full in the mast, impell'd with vigor, stood The forceful shaft, and quiver'd in the wood. The dove affrighted, stretch'd her flutt'ring wing; And with applause the vales and mountains ring. Then Mnestheus drew the bow, and aim'd on high The pointed dart, and levell'd with his eye; Nor thro' the mark the luckless arrow drove, But cut the string that ty'd the trembling dove. Swift thro' the clouds the bird unshackled flies, And spreads her wings, at freedom in the skies. Already had Eurytion bent his bow, And to his brother god address'd his vow: The tow'ring bird amid the clouds he slew, And the swift shaft transfix'd her as she flew. High in the skies she feels the deadly wound, And, with the dart, comes dying to the ground. And now, all hopes expir'd, the conquest gain'd, The venerable prince alone remain'd. Yet he discharg'd the flying shaft, to show His skill, his vigor, and resounding bow. When sudden they beheld, with wond'ring eyes, A dire portentous omen in the skies. Too late the seers the frightful sign explain, Too late they clear the dread event in vain! For, flying thro' the clouds in open view, The glowing arrow kindled as it flew; Then drew a golden trail of flames behind, That mark'd its course, and vanish'd in the wind: So shine the falling stars with dreadful hair, And glance, and shoot along the fields of air. Amaz'd the Trojans and Sicilians stood; And breath'd their ardent prayers to every god. The Dardan prince the doubtful sign mistook, Embrac'd the monarch, and with transport spoke: Father! accept the prize; the will divine Of mighty Jove, by this auspicious sign, Declares the first distinguish'd honours thine. Accept this goblet, which my sire of old Receiv'd from Cisseus rough with sculptur'd gold; Take it, my royal friend, and let it prove A long-priz'd gift of dear respect and love. Then he bestow'd the lawrel, and aloud Proclaim'd him victor to the shouting crowd. Nor did the generous chief the prize deny, Whose arrow pierc'd the bird amid the sky; Next, he who cut the cord, with gifts was grac'd; And he, whose arrow struck the tree, the last. Now call'd the prince, before the games were done, The hoary guardian of his royal son, And gently whispers in his faithful ear, To bid Ascanius in his arms appear, And with his youthful band and courser come, To pay due honours at his grandsire's tomb. Next he commands the huge assembled train To quit the ground, and leave an open plain. Ver. 710. Strait on their bridled steeds—This Lusus Trojæ (says Mr. Pope) is purely Virgil's own, and must be confessed to be inimitable. I don't know whether I may be allowed to say, it is worth all those other three in Homer (viz. the wrestling, the single combat, and the discus,) which Virgil hath left untouched.Strait on their bridled steeds, with grace divine, The beauteous youths before their fathers shine. The blooming Trojans and Sicilians throng, And gaze with wonder as they march'd along. Around their brows a vivid wreath they wore; Two glitt'ring lances tipt with steel they bore: These a light quiver stor'd with shafts sustain, And from their neck depends a golden chain. On bounding steeds advance three graceful bands, And each a little blooming chief commands. Ver. 720. Beneath each chief— A critic of equal taste and penetration, hath lately made the following new and judicious observations on the subject of these games in general: ‘The episode belongs, principally, to the epic muse; and the design of it is to diversify and ennoble the narration by digressive, yet not unrelated, ornaments; the former circumstance relieving the simplicity of the epic fable, while the other prevents its unity from being violated. Now these episodical narrations must either proceed from the poet himself, or be imputed to some other who is engaged in the course of the fable; and in either case, must help, indirectly at least, to forward it. ‘If of the latter kind, a probable pretext must be contrived for their introduction; which can be no other than that of satisfying the curiosity, or of serving to the necessary information, of some other. And in either of these ways a striking conformity in the mode of conducting the work is unavoidable. ‘If the episode be referred to the former class, its manner of introduction will admit a greater latitude. For it will vary with the subject, or occasions of relating it. Yet we shall mistake, if we believe these subjects, and consequently the occasions, connected with them, very numerous. 1. They must be of uncommon dignity and splendor; otherwise nothing can excuse the going out of the way to insert them. 2. They must have some apparent connection with the fable. 3. They must further accord to the idea and state of the times, from which the fable is taken. Put these things together, and see if they will not with probability, account for some coincidence in the choice and applications of the direct episode. And admitting this, the similarity of even its constituent parts is, also, necessary. ‘The genius of Virgil never suffers more, in the opinion of his critics, than when his book of games comes into consideration, and is confronted with Homer's. It is not unpleasant to observe the difficulties an advocate for his fame is put to in this nice point, to secure his honour from the imputation of plagiarism. The descriptions are accurately examined; and the improvement of a single circumstance, the addition of an epithet, even the novelty of a metaphor, or varied turn in the expression, is diligently remarked and urged, with triumph, in favour of his invention. Yet all this goes but a little way towards stilling the clamour. The entire design is manifestly taken; nay, particular incidents and circumstantials are, for the most part, the same, without variation. What shall we say, then, to this charge? shall we, in defiance of truth and fact, endeavour to confute it? or, if allowed, is there any method of supporting the reputation of the poet? I think there is, if prejudice will but suspend its determinations a few minutes, and afford his advocate a fair hearing. ‘The epic plan, more especially that of the Æneis, naturally comprehends whatever is most august in civil and religious affairs. The solemnities of funeral rites, and the festivities of public games (which religion had made an essential part of them) were, of necessity, to be included in a representation of the latter. But what games? Surely those, which ancient heroism vaunted to excel in; those, which the usage of the times had consecrated; and which, from the opinion of reverence and dignity, entertained of them, were become most fit for the pomp of epic description. Further, what circumstances could be noted in these sports? Certainly those, which befel most usually, and were the aptest to alarm the spectator, and make him take an interest in them. These, it will be said, are numerous. They were so; yet such as are most to the poet's purpose, were, with little or no variation, the same. It happened luckily for him, that two of his games, on which accordingly he hath exerted all the force of his genius, were entirely new. This advantage, the circumstances of the times afforded him. The Naumachia was purely his own. Yet so liable are even the best and most candid judges to be haunted by this spectre of imitation, that one, whom every friend to every human excellence honours, cannot help, on comparing it with the chariot-race of Homer, exclaiming in these words: “What is the encounter of Cloanthus and Gyas in the strait between the rocks, but the same with that of Menelaus and Antilochus in the hollow way? had the galley of Serjestus been broken, if the chariot of Eumelus had not been demolished? or, Mnestheus been cast from the helm, had not the other been thrown from his seat?” The plain truth is, it was not possible, in describing an ancient sea-fight, for one, who had even never seen Homer, to overlook such usual and striking particulars, as the justling of ships, the breaking of galleys, and loss of pilots. ‘It may appear from this instance, with what reason a similarity of circumstance, in the other games, hath been objected. The subject-matter admitted not any material variation: I mean in the hands of a judicious copier of nature. And Virgil was too jealous of the honour of that character, which is peculiarly his own, to hazard it for the sake of acquiring the false fame of originality. But we may go further; and demonstrate, that, in the case before us, he unquestionably judged right. ‘A defect of natural ability is not that, which the critics have been most forward to charge upon Statius. A person of true taste, who, in a fanciful way, hath contrived to give us the just character of the Latin poets, in assigning to this poet the topmost station on Parnassus, sufficiently acknowledges the vigour and activity of his genius. Yet, in composing his Thebaid (an old story taken from the heroic ages, which obliged him to the celebration of funeral obsequies with the attending solemnities of public games) to avoid the dishonour of following too closely on the heels of Homer and Virgil, who had not only taken the same route, but pursued it in the most direct and natural course, he resolved, at all adventures, to keep at due distance from them, and to make his way, as well as he could, more obliquely to the same end. To accomplish this, he was forced, though in the description of the same individual games, to look out for different circumstances and events in them; that so the identity of his subject, which he could not avoid, might, in some degree, be attoned for by the diversity of his manner in treating it. It must be owned, that great ingenuity as well as industry have been used, in executing this project. Had it been practicable, the character, just given of this poet, makes it credible, he must have succeeded in it. Yet, so impossible it is, without deserting nature herself, to dissent from her faithful copiers, that the main objection to the sixth book of the Thebaid hath arisen from this fruitless endeavour of being original, where common sense and the reason of the thing would not permit it. “In the particular descriptions of each of these games (says the great writer, before quoted, and from whose sentence in matters of taste, there lies no appeal) Statius hath not borrowed from either of his predecessors, and his poem is so much the worse for it.” Mr. Hird's Discourse on Poetical Imitation, p. 169.Beneath each chief twelve sprightly striplings came, In shining arms, in looks and age the same. Grac'd with his grandsire's name, Polites' son, Young Priam, leads the first gay squadron on; A youth, whose progeny must Latium grace: He press'd a dappled steed of Thracian race: Before, white spots on either foot appear, And on his forehead blaz'd a silver star. Atys the next advanc'd, with looks divine, Atys the source of the great Attian line: Iülus friendship grac'd the lovely boy: And last Iülus came, the pride of Troy, In charms, superior to the blooming train; And spurr'd his Tyrian courser to the plain; Which Dido gave the princely youth, to prove A lasting pledge, memorial of her love. Th'inferior boys on beauteous coursers ride, From great Acestes' royal stalls supply'd. Now flush'd with hopes, now pale with anxious fear, Before the shouting crowds, the youths appear; The shouting crowds admire their charms, and trace Their parents lines in every lovely face. Now round the ring, before their fathers, ride The boys, in all their military pride. Till Periphantes' sounding lash from far Gave the loud signal of the mimick war; Strait, in three bands distinct, they break away, Divide in order, and their ranks display: Swift at the summons they return, and throw At once their hostile lances at the foe: Then take a new excursion on the plain; Round within round, an endless course maintain; And now advance, and now retreat again; With well-dissembled rage their rivals dare, And please the crowd with images of war. Alternate now they turn their backs in flight, Now dart their lances, and renew the fight: Then in a moment from the combat cease, Rejoin their scatter'd bands, and move in peace. Ver. 759. So winds delusive—This comparison of the labyrinth, and the following one of the dolphins are borrowed; the one from Homer, and the other from Apollonius Rhodius, but are employed by Virgil in quite different circumstances. It must be owned, that they have a much finer effect in our poet, than in the authors from whom he borrowed them.So winds delusive, in a thousand ways Perplext and intricate, the Cretan maze; Round within round, the blind Mæanders run, Untrac'd and dark, and end where they begun. The skilful youths, in sport, alternate ply Their shifting course; by turns they fight and fly: As dolphins gambol on the watry way, And, bounding o'er the tides, in wanton circles play. This sport Ascanius, when in mighty length He rais'd proud Alba glorying in her strength, Taught the first fathers of the Latian name, As now he solemniz'd the noble game. From their successive Alban offspring come These ancient plays, to grace imperial Rome; Ver. 773. And game of Troy— This circumstance is by no means the invention of the poet, but is actually an historical fact. Dion Cassius, Tacitus, and above all Suetonius, in many passages of their works assure us, that this sort of games performed by noble youths of Rome, were called Troja. Suetonius gives this description of them, when he is speaking of Julius Cæsar. Trojam lusit turma duplex majorum minorumve, puerorum; and speaking of Augustus, he says, Sed et Trojae ludum edidit frequentissimè. That is to say, that he re-established and renewed the frequent use of them; which, according to Dion Cassius, had been something neglected by the Romans, till the reign of the Cæsars. Lazius in his Commentaries de Repub. Romanâ, fansies the justs and tournaments so much in fashion about two or three hundred years ago, to have owed their original to this ludus Trojae; and that tornamenta is but a corruption of Trojamenta. And the learned and noble Du Fresne acquaints us, that many are of the same opinion. However (says Mr. Kennet) though the words may perhaps be derived with more probability from the French tourner, to turn round with agility; yet the exercises have so much resemblance, as to prove the one an imitation of the other.Who owns her Trojan band, and game of Troy Deriv'd thro' ages from the princely boy. Thus were the solemn funeral honours paid To great Anchises' venerable shade. But soon the prince his changing fortune found, And in her turn the fickle goddess frown'd. For, while the gather'd crowds the games repeat, Ver. 780. Heaven's mighty empress—Here the poet returns to the main subject of his poem. This is the third obstacle Juno raises, to hinder Æneas's arrival in Italy. Nothing can be more natural, than the fears of the Trojan women to embark again, of which Juno makes a proper use, and introduces Iris to them, just at the moment they were wishing for some settlement, and declaring their dread of a new voyage.Heav'n's mighty empress, to the Trojan fleet, (Her ancient rage still glowing in her soul,) Dispatch'd fair Iris from the starry pole. Big with revengeful schemes, herself supplies The rapid storm that bears her down the skies. Unseen, the maid a thousand colours drew, As down her bow, with winged speed, she flew: And saw around the tomb th'assembly meet, The vacant harbour, and neglected fleet. Ver. 789. Mean time retir'd—In this passage Virgil observes the decorum (the bienséance of the French) of the manners. The women are not present at the celebration of the games, intermixed with the men; but apart, in a particular assembly of themselves alone, lament the death of Anchises. Catrou.Mean time, retir'd within the lonely shore, Anchises' fate the Trojan dames deplore; Cast a long look o'er all the flood, and weep To see the wide-extended watry deep: Yet, must we yet, alas! new labours try, More seas, more oceans? was the general cry. Oh! grant a town at last, ye gracious gods! To wretches harrast with the winds and floods. 'Twas then, their raging sorrow to improve, Amid the train shot Iris from above. Aside her heav'nly charms the goddess threw, Ver. 800. And like old Beroë—Virgil has made a Beroe of one of his goddesses in the 5th Æneid; but if we compare the speech she there makes with that of her namesake in this story (viz. Ovid's 3d book of the Metamorphosis) we may find the genius of each poet discovering itself in the language of the nurse: Virgil's Iris could not have spoken more majestically in her own shape; but Juno is so much altered from herself in Ovid, that the goddess is quite lost in the old woman. Addison.And like old Beroë stood in open view; (Doryclus' hoary spouse, a noble dame, Fam'd for her off-spring, and illustrious name;) And thus the goddess fans the rising flame: Ah! wretched race, whom heav'n forbade to fall By Grecian swords, beneath our native wall! Tost round the seas, o'er every region cast, Oh! to what fate are we reserv'd at last! Now, since imperial Troy in ashes lay, Have sev'n successive summers roll'd away. Still to new lands o'er floods and rocks we fly, And sail, by every star, in every sky. So long we chace, o'er all the boundless main, The flying coasts of Italy in vain. Here o'er our kindred Eryx' fruitful plains, The hospitable king, Acestes reigns: What, what forbids our wand'ring Trojan bands, To raise a city in these friendly lands? Ye gods preserv'd from hostile flames in vain! Shall our dear Ilion never rise again? A second Simois shall we view no more, Or a new Xanthus, on a foreign shore. Rise then, rise all; assist, ye mournful dames, To set this execrable fleet in flames. For late, Cassandra seem'd to load my hands, In visions of the night, with blazing brands: Seek Troy no more, she said: this destin'd place Is the fixt mansion of the Dardan race. Fly, fly we then, the omen to compleat; The glad occasion calls to fire the fleet; Ver. 830. Four proud altars rise—Virgil takes care to prepare even the least events in a proper manner. These altars, erected to Neptune, had already been taken notice of in the affair of the galleys. Cloanthus had made a vow to erect one to Neptune on the shore: Probably all the other commanders of the vessels had likewise erected each an altar for himself. Thus were there four in all erected: 'Tis not therefore without preparation, that the poet makes four altars be found, on purpose for his design. Catrou.Lo! where to Neptune four proud altars rise! Lo! his own fires the ready god supplies! She said;—then seiz'd a blazing brand, and threw; Th'increasing flames amid the navy flew. At the bold deed, with deep surprize amaz'd, The dames all wond'ring on the goddess gaz'd. At last, the nurse of Priam's offspring broke The general silence, and the train bespoke: Ver. 838. This was no Beroë— Matres, in the original signifies the women in general; all of that sex. (See 613, 616, compared with 622. anteh. 655, 715, 717, compared with this) Yet Virgil, to beautify his poem, and to preserve other traditions, has women among them on several occasions after this. As Cajeta 7, 1. Euryalus's mother, 9, 217 (who, he says there, was the only one that was not left in Sicily)—(The same, ibid. 474.) and a whole company of Trojan women at Pallas's funeral 11, 35. Perhaps this was out of forgetfulness. Opera in longo fas est obrepere somnum. Perhaps he was aware of it, and chose to do it on the great rule of committing little faults, to introduce considerable beauties. Spence.This was no Beroë, whom we saw appear, But some bright goddess from th'æthereal sphere. Mark her majestic port! her voice divine! O'er all her form what starry splendors shine! She darts a glance immortal from her eyes, Breathes, looks and moves, a sister of the skies! Beroë I left in anguish, who repin'd, Shut from the rites, and to her couch confin'd. The matrons, now by doubts and fears impell'd, First with malignant eyes the fleet beheld; In choice suspended for a space they stand, Between the promis'd and the present land: When, smooth on levell'd wings, the goddess flies, And cuts a mighty bow along the skies. Struck at the wond'rous sight, the shrieking dames, From the bright altars snatch the sacred flames; Bring leaves and wither'd branches in their hands To feed the fires; and hurl the blazing brands. Fierce thro' the ships, the decks, the crackling oars, In all his rage devouring Vulcan roars. And now Eumelus to the host conveys The dreadful tidings of the rising blaze: Ver. 860. The crouds grow pale—This is a very fine contrast; between the joy and festivity of the games, and the confusion, dread and disorder, which this accident of firing the ships occasions. Such oppositions, and such variations of the scene, are some of the greatest beauties of poetry. They raise surprize in the reader by their unexpectedness. Ver. 860. And spy—This distant prospect of the fire is finely imagined.The crouds grow pale; they look behind and spy A cloud of cinders dark'ning all the sky. Ver. 861. And first Ascanius—The making Ascanius the first person alarmed, his sudden riding away from the sport in which he was engaged, and the noble spirit with which he addresses these vile incendiaries, are all circumstances that make the reader fond of the character of this young hero, and give him an importance in the poem.And first Ascanius, as he led the band, Pour'd o'er the plain, impetuous, to the strand; Nor can his panting guardians check the speed Of the young heroe, and his fiery steed: Oh! what curst rage is this, ye wretched dames? To what dire purpose fly these fatal flames? Behold, your own Ascanius—you destroy No Argive navy, but the hopes of Troy. With that he threw his helmet on the shore, In which he led his youthful bands before. Next came Æneas, and the Trojan host. Ver. 873. Affrighted dames—Observe their fear and guilt, and their sudden repentance of their rash undertaking.Th'affrighted dames dispersing o'er the coast, To woods and hollow caverns take their flight, Repent their crime, and hate the golden light: With alter'd minds their kindred they confest, And the fierce goddess fled from every breast. Not so the furious flames; they spread the more; And, high in air, with rage, redoubled roar. Close in the cordage works the sullen fire, And thro' the ribs the heavy smokes expire. Within the keel the subtle vapours lye; Thence the contagious flames thro' all the vessel fly. The lab'ring heroes toil with fruitless pain, And gushing floods on floods are pour'd in vain, The prince then tore his robes in deep despair, Rais'd high his hands; and thus addrest his pray'r; Great Jove! if one of all the Trojan state, Lives yet exempt from thy immortal hate; Oh! if thy sacred eyes with wonted grace Behold the miserable mortal race; Suppress these fires; forbid them to destroy; Ver. 893. And snatch from death— One is in great pain least Æneas's whole fleet should be here destroyed, and consequently an end be put to his glorious intended expedition; but the poet Falsis terroribus implet. Jupiter most opportunely sends a shower sufficient to quench this alarming fire, and makes us easy again. The loss was small, only four gallies.And snatch from death the poor remains of Troy! Or if my crimes, almighty sire, demand! The last, last vengeance of thy dreadful hand, On me, on me alone that vengeance shed, And with thy levell'd thunders strike me dead! Scarce had he said, when o'er the navy pours A sudden gloomy cloud in rattling show'rs; Black with the southern winds the tempest flies, And in a moment bursts from all the skies In sluicy sheets and deluges of rain; And the loud thunders shook the mountain and the plain. Fierce o'er the ships the waters took their way; Ver. 905. Hissing timber— Virgil has found out most elegant terms to describe so difficult and unamiable a subject as the increase and abating of this fire; ? udo sub robore vivit Stupa, ? Examine likewise all the following lines.And, quench'd in floods, the hissing timbers lay. Four gallies lost; at length the flames retire, And all the remant fleet escap'd the raging fire. Mean time the heroe by the loss opprest, With various cares, that rack'd his lab'ring breast, If still to seek the Latian realm debates, Or here to fix, forgetful of the fates. Ver. 912. Then Nautes fam'd—This is one of those passages in which Virgil makes his court to one of the most illustrious families in Italy: That was the family called Nautia. Dionysius Halicarnasseus says, that the Nautes who founded this family, was one of the companions of Æneas; and that the care of guarding the Palladium was entrusted to him. He is introduced speaking with great wisdom.Then Nautes, fam'd for wisdom and for age, (For Pallas taught the venerable sage, What great events the fates and gods ordain;) Bespoke the chief, and thus reliev'd his pain. 'Tis best, illustrious heroe, to obey, And still pursue where fortune leads the way; By patience to retrieve our hapless state, And rise superior to the strokes of fate. Let great Acestes in your councils join, Your royal friend, of Troy's immortal line. Your vessels lost; those numbers who remain, A timorous, weak, unnecessary train, The hoary sires and dames, unfit to bear The perils of the sea, or toils of war, Select; and trust to his paternal care. The weary wretches here their walls may frame, And call their city by the monarch's name. The prince approv'd th'advice his friend addrest, But still a thousand cares distract his lab'ring breast, Now o'er the solemn skies devoid of light, High in her sable chariot rode the night; When to the godlike heroe, from the pole Ver. 934. His father's soul—Æneas still fluctuating in his designs, and not being fully resolved to leave the kingdom of Acestes, it was absolutely necessary to introduce Anchises's ghost, ordering him still to pursue his first design, and the will of the gods, in going to Italy. This surely is, Dignus vindice Nodus.Descends, and speaks his mighty father's soul: My son! in all the fates of Troy approv'd, Whom, while I liv'd, beyond my life I lov'd; Lo! I am sent by heav'n's almighty sire, Who from thy navy bade the flames retire. The prudent counsel of thy friend obey, Take, with the bravest youths, the dangerous way: With these fair Latium shalt thou reach, and there Wage with a rugged race a dreadful war. Ver. 943. To Pluto's regions go—This apparition of Anchises, and the commands he gives his son to descend into the shades below, are a necessary preparation for the sixth book. The art of the poet is admirable in the manner wherewith he always prepares the events that are to follow. By this he keeps up the suspence and raises the expectation of the reader, which is one of the greatest beauties in epic poetry. Catrou.Yet first, my son, to Pluto's regions go, And meet thy father in the realms below: For know, my spirit was not doom'd to dwell In the dark horrors and the depths of hell, But, with the pious blest assembly reigns, In all the pleasures of th'Elysian plains. But thou the blood of sable victims shed; Then shall the Sibyl guide thee to the dead. There shalt thou know what town the fates assign, With the long glories of thy future line. And now, farewell;—the night slides swift away I feel from far the morning's painful ray; And shrink, and sicken at the beams of day. He said, and lo! that moment from his eyes, Like a thin smoke, dissolv'd into the skies. Vanish'd so soon! where, whither art thou gone? Why, why retires my father from his son? What! not one last embrace? the prince exclaims: Then to new life he wakes the slumb'ring flames; And hoary Vesta, and the Trojan powers, With sacred gifts and suppliant vows adores. Strait the whole scene before his friends he lays, But chief the vision to the king displays; Unfolds the message sent from heav'n above, His father's counsel, and the will of Jove. His friends approve the Heroe's new designs, And in the task the good Acestes joins. To the new town the matrons they assign'd, And leave the willing vulgar crowds behind; Ver. 972. Souls that no hopes—It ought always to be remembered, that the particular design of the Æneid is to instruct princes how to found colonies. Now, one of the most prudent precautions in that matter is to leave behind all those who are intimidated with the dangers of the expedition, and retain only those who are thoroughly brave, and are fixt and hearty in the design. Catrou.Souls, that no hopes of future praise inflame, Cold and insensible to glorious fame. With speed the half-burn'd vessels they repair, Provide, new cordage, decks, and oars with care; A slender band, but eager all for war. The prince then drew a city on the plain; Next he assign'd the dwellings to the train. Now a new Ilion in Trinacria rose, And a new Simois and Scamander flows. Well-pleas'd Acestes took the sov'reign sway; Th'adopted subjects their new prince obey. The king conven'd the peers around, and sate To frame new laws, and regulate the state. To Venus' name they bid a temple rise From Eryx' top, high tow'ring to the skies: And next a priest and ample grove were made, For ever sacred to Anchises' shade. Now nine whole days in solemn feasts had past; When gentle breezes smooth'd the floods at last: The southern-winds invite their sails and oars; Then cries and shrieks resound along the shoars. In long, long tenderness they spend the day, In close embraces waste the night away. Ver. 995. Now all the wretches—What a just picture of human nature is here! All those who were so fond of staying in this new city but just before, when they came to part with their old friends and companions (which parting is movingly described) began to repent of their scheme, and long to accompany the rest in their voyage.Now all the wretches, e'en the female train Who fear'd so late the dangers of the main, And shrunk, the rolling ocean to survey, All wish to take the long laborious way. The melting heroe soothes their wild despair, And, weeps and gives them to the monarch's care. Three heifers next to Eryx' name he pays, A lamb to every storm the heroe slays, Unmoors his fleet, and every sail displays. Crown'd with a graceful olive wreath he stands High on the prow; a charger in his hands; Hurls the fat entrails o'er the foamy brine, And stains the silver waves with sable wine. Fresh rise the prosp'rous gales; the sailors sweep, And dash with equal strokes the roaring deep. Ver. 1010. Mean time the queen of love with cares—This complaint of Venus to Neptune, is very elegant and very artful; and what the god answers her, prepares the reader to expect their happy arrival in Italy; and serves to answer an objection that might be made, why Juno, who had excited so terrible a tempest in the first book, should not endeavour to raise another; since she now had no time to lose, as the Trojans were very near the end of their long voyage. One ought to observe with what art the poet gives to both these gods, those terms and manner of speaking that are most proper and suited to their characters. The speech of Venus is full of sweetness; and Neptune, in his answer, seems not to mention any thing but what belongs to his empire; one while calling Xanthus and Simois to witness, how much he had done for Troy; another while inserting in his speech, either the tempest which Juno excited, or the birth of Venus, who arose from the waves, or the inundation of the rivers of Troy. Thus should the characters of all those who are introduced speaking, be marked, in making them say what is proper, and peculiar to them; and in making them appear full of those things with which they ought to be more particularly touched and affected. Segrais.Mean time the queen of love with cares opprest, The mighty father of the floods addrest: Imperious Juno's unrelenting hate To the poor relicks of the Trojan state, (Which no decrees of Jove or fate restrain, Nor length of years, nor vows preferr'd in vain,) Compels a sister goddess to repair, To thee, great Neptune, with a suppliant's prayer. For rage like her's, 'twas little to destroy, Fair Asia's pride, th'imperial town of Troy! 'Twas not enough her wand'ring natives know All forms and all varieties of woe! But oh! her groundless vengeance would efface, Ev'n the last relicks of the perish'd race! Thou, thou canst witness, ocean's mighty god! With what dire storms she lash'd the Libyan flood; When, arm'd with all the Æolian winds in vain, Earth, air and heav'n, she mingled with the main, And rais'd such tumults in thy watry reign. Yet, still more shameful!—now her arts inspire The Trojan dames to wrap the ships in fire; And urge my son, to leave his social band (His fleet half-ruin'd) in a foreign land. But oh! I beg for those, who yet remain, A peaceful voyage to the Latian plain; A suppliant goddess begs for nothing more Than those same realms the fates assign'd before! 'Tis yours, reply'd the monarch of the main, Yours to command in this our watry reign; Since from the sacred ocean first you came, Since your deserts your confidence may claim; Oft for your son I bade the whirlwinds cease; I hush'd the roarings of the floods to peace; And Simois can attest and Xanthus' stream, By land my guardian care was still the same. When fierce Achilles, furious to destroy, Drove to their walls the trembling sons of Troy: Beneath his vengeful spear when thousands bled, When the choak'd rivers groan'd with loads of dead; When Xanthus' flood incumber'd with the slain, Scarce roll'd his struggling billows to the main; Your son oppos'd him, with unequal might And far inferior gods, in single fight: Instant I snatch'd him from the dreadful fray, And in a cloud convey'd the chief away. Ev'n then I sav'd the warrior, when with joy I wish'd and wrought the fall of perjur'd Troy: Ver. 1057. He shall plow— Venus in her speech to Neptune, in favour of Æneas, begs that he may arrive safe from Sicily, to the channel of the Tiber; ? Liceat Laurentum attingere Tybrim. Æn. 5. 796. Neptune, in his answer, says, that he shall get safe to the coast of Cumæ, which is not a satisfactory answer to the request; and yet she is fully satisfied with it. The Florentine manuscript in this answer, instead of accedet, has accedit: as if he had said, he is now going on in the coast of Cumæ, as safely as you could wish; and shall go on as safely all the rest of his voyage. Nothing is more frequent in Virgil, than this way, of not mentioning expresly, what may be easily inferred. 'Tis so common in him, that I have always taken it to be the distinguishing difference between his and Homer's manner of writing. Spence.And still will save him—he shall plow the sea, And to Avernus' port direct his way. On the wild floods shall only one be lost, One single wretch atone for all the host! Thus when the god had sooth'd her anxious mind, His finny coursers to the car he join'd; Next to their fiery mouths the bits apply'd, And, while the wheels along the level glide, He throws up all the reins, and skims the floating tide. Ver. 1066. The flood subsides— Homer, it must be granted, hath greatly excelled Virgil, in the passage from which this is copied, Iliad 13 B. Ver. 27. I cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the verses in their noble original: ? ??? ?????????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??? ????? ?????? ?? ???? ?? ???? ???????? ?? ??????, ??? ????????? ??????, ???????? ?? ??????? ????????? ??? ????????? ????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ??????? ????, Longinus confesses himself wonderfully struck with the vast grandeur and sublimity of this passage; which, he says, had raised the admiration of all antiquity. Mr. Pope thinks Virgil comes short of this original, and fancies Scaliger himself was sensible of this, by his passing in silence a passage, which lay so obvious to comparison.The flood subsides and spreads a glassy plain, And the loud chariot thunders o'er the main; The clouds before the mighty monarch fly In heaps, and scatter thro' the boundless sky: A thousand forms attend the glorious god, Enormous whales, and monsters of the flood: Here the long train of hoary Glaucus rides; Here the swift Tritons shoot along the tides; There rode Palæmon o'er the watry plain, With aged Phorcus, and his azure train; And beauteous Thetis led the daughters of the main. Æneas view'd the scene; and hence arose A beam of joy to dissipate his woes. Instant he gives command to stretch the sails, To rear the maft and catch the springing gales. Strait the glad train the spacious sheet unbind, And stretch the canvass to the driving wind. Old Palinurus first the navy guides; The rest obedient follow thro' the tides. Now half the night thro' heav'n had roll'd away, The sailors stretch'd along their benches lay, When thro' the parting vapour swiftly flies The god of slumbers from th' 'etherial skies. To thee, poor Palinure, he came, and shed Ver. 1090. A fatal sleep—Virgil's account of the death of Palinurus, is in the strong oriental taste. In one place 'tis said, that a god took away all his vigilance; tore off the rudder he should have guided, and flung him over-board with it into the sea: in another, that the god had nothing to do in it; but that it was wholly owing to himself. There are frequent instances of the very same orientalism in Homer, and in the sacred writings. Spence.A fatal sleep on thy devoted head! High on the stern his silent stand he took In Phorbas' shape; and thus the phantom spoke: Behold, the fleet, my friend, securely sails, Steer'd by the floods and wafted by the gales! Now steal a moment's rest; myself will guide A while the vessel o'er the floating tide. To whom the careful Palinure replies, While scarce he rais'd his heavy closing eyes: Me wouldst thou urge in sleep to sink away? And fondly credit such a flatt'ring sea? Too well, my friend, I know the treach'rous main! Too well to tempt the monster's smiles again! Too oft deceiv'd by such a calm before, I trust my master to the winds no more. This said, he grasp'd the helm, and fixt his eyes On every guiding star that gilds the skies. Then o'er his temples shook the wrathful god A branch, deep-drench'd in Lethe's silent flood. The potent charm in dews of slumber steep, And soon weigh down his swimming eyes to sleep. Scarce yet his languid limbs had sunk away, When o'er the wretch the god incumbent lay, And, with a shatter'd fragment of the ship, Bore down the helm and pilot to the deep; Headlong he tumbles in the flashing main, And calls for succour to his friends in vain. Swift from the stern the airy phantom flies, And with spread pinions mounts the golden skies; Yet smooth along the flood the navy rode, Safe in the promise of the watry god. Ver. 1121. The siren's dangerous coast—About thirty miles from the shore, directly off Naples, and a stone-throw from the south-side of the island Capreæ, stand the Sirenusæ, or rocks of the sirens. The common opinion about their inhabitants, and the most probable is, that they were lewd women, who prostituted themselves to the sailors, and by the allurements of a lazy voluptuous life, made them unmindful of their voyage, and careless of returning to their native country. But their story, as it is told by Homer, lies so pat for a moral, that it is hard to believe it to be any thing else than pure fiction. Their charming aspect at first sight; their beautiful faces, and ensnaring voice, perfectly represent the fair appearance of an object of pleasure; and their false destructive nature, their hidden deformities, and the way to shun and destroy them, agree so nicely with the methods prescribed by the moralists, for avoiding a gilded snare, that it would almost be pity to spoil the allegory. Nor is there any necessity we should. The Phenician accounts of these enchanting creatures; their telling how ravishingly they sung, and how many crews had been lost thro' their means, was ground sufficient for the poet: They both gave him a foundation for his tale, and scope to work it up in the symbolical Ægyptian manner, until it lost its specialities; and, from a private story, became capable of a general application. Enquiry into the life and writings of Homer, sect. 11. p. 259.Now they approach'd the siren's dangerous coast, Once rough, and infamous for vessels lost: Huge heaps of bones still whiten all the shore; And, dash'd from rock to rock, the billows roar. The watchful prince th'endanger'd galley found, Without a pilot, strike on shoaly ground; Himself then took the task, by night to guide The wand'ring vessel o'er the rolling tide: O dear lamented friend! (the heroe cries,) For faith repos'd on flatt'ring seas and skies, Cast on a foreign shore thy naked body lies! The End of the Fifth Book. BOOK the Sixth. This sixth book is a very valuable monument of learning, even exclusive of the sublime poetry it contains. In it we have a large and beautiful account of the ancient theology and mythology, their notions of a future state of rewards and punishments, of the immortality of the soul, and its transmigrations, of the doctrine of the anima mundi, or soul of the universe; and several other most curious points relating to the religion of the ancients. Add to this, that we are here likewise entertained with an elegantly succinct history of the chief Roman worthies, who pass in review before us, whose characters are distinctly and strongly marked, and their most illustrious actions specified. The ARGUMENT. The Sibyl foretells Æneas the adventures he should meet with in Italy. She attends him to hell, describing to him the various scenes of that place, and conducting him to his father Anchises, who instructs him in those sublime mysteries of the soul of the world, and the transmigration; and shews him that glorious race of heroes, which was to descend from him and his posterity. Thus while he wept; with flying sails and oars The navy reach'd the fair Cumæan shores. The circling anchors here the fleet detain, All rang'd beside the margin of the main. With eager transport fir'd, the Trojan band Leap from the ships to gain th'Hesperian land. Some strike from flints the sparkling seeds of flame, Some storm the coverts of the savage game; To feed the fires, unroot the standing woods, And shew with joy the new-discover'd floods. To Phœbus' fane the heroe past along, And those dark caverns where the Sibyl sung. There, as the god enlarg'd her soul, she sate, And open'd all the deep decrees of fate. The train with reverence enter, and behold Chaste Trivia's grove, and temple roof'd with gold; A structure rais'd by Dædalus, ('tis said) When from the Cretan king's revenge he fled. On wings to Northern climes he dar'd to soar, Through airy ways unknown to man before; Full many a length of sky and ocean past, On Cuma's sacred tow'rs he stoop'd at last. Then hung to Phœbus in the strange abode, The wings that steer'd him thro' the liquid road, And rais'd the pompous pile in honour of the god. Ver. 26. The matchless artist— The sculpture on the front of this temple, is beautifully imagined. That circumstance of the father's endeavouring to carve the death of his son in the piece, and his hands shaking and failing him for grief, and his being unable to finish the figure of Icarus, is inexpressibly tender. Icarus being confined with his father in a tower at Crete, endeavoured to escape with wings joined with wax; but flying too near the sun, the wax melted and he fell, and was drowned in the Egean sea.The matchless artist, on the lofty gate, Engrav'd Androgeos' memorable fate: And here by lot sad Athens yearly paid Sev'n hapless youths, to soothe his angry shade. Here stood the fatal urn; and there with pride Fair Crete rose tow'ring on the silver tide. There too the father of the herds was seen, Who quench'd the passion of the lustful queen; Their birth, a man below, a beast above, The mingled offspring of prepost'rous love! There stood the winding pile, whose mazes run Round within round, and end where they begun. But when the pitying Dædalus survey'd The hopeless passion of the Ariadne. royal maid, He led her Theseus through the puzzling ways, Safe with a clue, and open'd every maze. Thou too, poor Icarus! hadst borne a part, Had grief not check'd thy parent in his art! He thrice essay'd the mournful task in vain; Thrice shook his hand, and drop'd the task again. Thus had they gaz'd o'er all the costly frame, When lo! Achates from the temple came; With him Deiphobe of Phœbus' fane The sacred priestess—who at once began:— Ver. 50. Hence—The shortness, abruptness, and authoritative air of this speech, are much in character.Hence—gaze no more; sev'n chosen sheep with speed, Sev'n steers, unconscious of the yoke, must bleed. She spoke; the crowds obey; and to the fane Sublime, she calls the wond'ring Trojan train. Ver. 54. Scoop'd thro' the rock—Ovid's description of the cave of sleep, Met. 11. 592. is much more like what they call the Sybil's grot at present, than this opening describ'd by Virgil. Spence.Scoop'd thro' the rock, in mighty depth display'd, Lies the dark cavern of the Sybil maid; Thro' all the hundred portals rush abroad Her sacred voice, and answers of the god. Scarce at the cell arriv'd—invoke the skies, Ver. 59. I feel the god, the rushing god! she cries— This whole description is conceived and painted with the greatest warmth of imagination; it is one of the finest pieces of poetic enthusiasm in the world.—Lord Roscommon breaks out into the following rapture concerning this passage: Have you been led thro' the Cumæan cave, And heard th'impatient maid divinely rave? I hear her now! I see her rowling eyes! And panting, lo! the god, the god, she cries— I cannot help being surprized, with Dr. Trapp, that Lord Lauderdale and Mr. Dryden, in their translations, should omit the repetition of the word deus: Than which nothing can be more striking and emphatical. This circumstance of the priestess' spreading to the sight, and growing larger and larger, as the inspiration came upon her, is most nobly imagined and prodigiously affecting. Mr. Spence observes, that such kind of growing figures are very uncommon in the poets. There are but three of them, says he, that I can recollect at present; those are all described by Virgil; and are, perhaps, some of the strongest instances of that poet's imagination, of any thing in all his works. One of them is in his description of Fame; and the other two relate both to furies. In his description of Fame, he speaks of that goddess as appearing small to you at first; but as growing upon you continually, till her head reaches the clouds. He represents Tisiphone (Geor. 3.) much in the same manner; terrible indeed, when she first appears on the earth; but growing every day larger, and more and more terrible: This is when he introduces this fury as bringing a pestilence upon the earth; which gives it a great deal of propriety, from the allegory and the realities answering so well to each other. The third instance is in his account of Alecto's appearance to Turnus; where he says, that her face grew still larger and larger, as he looked upon it. Polymetis, Dial. 16. I hope this learned and amiable author (who seldom forgets any thing but the obligations he lays upon his friends) will pardon me for putting him in mind of a fourth instance of these growing figures, in Virgil's writings; this of the priestess, in the passage before us, which, for its beauty and sublimity, may be perhaps compared with any of the before-mentioned three.I feel the god, the rushing god! she cries. While yet she spoke, enlarg'd her features grew, Her colour chang'd, her locks dishevel'd flew. The heav'nly tumult reigns in every part, Pants in her breast, and swells her rising heart: Still spreading to the sight, the priestess glow'd, And heav'd impatient of th'incumbent god. Then to her inmost soul by Phœbus fir'd, In more than human sounds she spoke inspir'd: Still, dost thou still delay? thy voice employ In ardent vows, illustrious prince of Troy! Thy pray'rs, thy urgent pray'rs must wide display These awful portals to the light of day. She said; the Trojans shook with holy fear, And thus the suppliant prince preferr'd his pray'r: Hear, Phœbus, gracious God! whose aid divine So oft has sav'd the wretched Trojan line, And wing'd the shaft from Paris' Phrygian bow, The shaft that laid the great Achilles low. Led by thy guardian care, secure I past Thro' many a realm, and rang'd the watry waste; Trod the wild regions where the Syrtes lie, And lands that stretch beneath a different sky. At length the coast of Italy we gain, The flying coast, so long pursu'd in vain. Till now, to every realm our course we bent, And Ilion's fate pursu'd us where we went. Now all ye pow'rs, confederate to destroy The glorious empire and the tow'rs of Troy, 'Tis time to bid your wrathful vengeance cease, To bid her poor remains repose in peace. And thou, great Sybil! to whose piercing eye Disclos'd the scenes of future ages lie; Since all my cares and labours but explore An empire promis'd by the fates before, Give me to fix in Latium's fair abodes The sons of Troy, and rest her wand'ring gods: Then shall my hands a glorious temple frame To mighty Dian, and her brother's name; And solemn days to Phœbus I'll decree, And in my realms shall temples rise to thee: There all thy mystic numbers will I place, With all the fortunes of the Trojan race. By chosen sages guarded, there shall lie The records, sacred from the vulgar eye. Nor be my fates to flitting leaves consign'd, To fly the common sport of every wind! But thou, even thou, great prophetess! relate In vocal accents all my future fate. Now raves the Sybil in her cave, opprest By Phœbus raging in her heaving breast; She struggles to discharge the mighty load, Maddens and bounds, impatient of the god: Her foamy mouth attentive to controul, He forms her organs and commands her soul. Then (all the hundred doors display'd to view) Thro' every vent the sacred accents flew: By sea, O prince! are all thy perils o'er, But far, far greater wait thee on the shore. Dismiss thy doubts; to Latium's destin'd plain Troy's sons shall come, but wish to fly again. Wars, horrid wars I see on Tyber's shore; And all his waves run thick with human gore! Scamander shalt thou find, and Simois there, And Greece shall arm a second host for war. A new Achilles rises to the fight; Him too a pregnant goddess brings to light: And heav'n's great queen, with unrelenting hate, Still, as of old, pursues the Dardan state. Once more the woes of Troy derive their cause From a new breach of hospitable laws; And she must bleed again as late she bled, For a rap'd princess and a foreign bed. How shalt thou rove, new succours to implore, From every court along the Latian shore! But thou, more bold, the more thy fates oppose, Advance, great prince, superior to thy woes: Thy first fair hopes of safety and success, Beyond thy fondest wish, shall rise from Greece. Ver. 138. Thus spoke the sybil— In Virgil's account of Æneas's preparation (Æn. 6, 9 to 263) for his descent into hell, most people are apt to confound the priestess of the sibyl, and the sibyl herself together.—The priestess's name is Deiphobe, the daughter of Glaucus; which was not the name of any one of the sibyls.—The sibyl was herself a goddess, and as such required an introductress to her: and Scipio, in Silius Italicus, Lib. 13. has the priestess Autonoë, to conduct him to this very sibyl.—Virgil calls Deiphobe, generally by the name of Sacerdos; and the sibyl, Virgo, Vates and Dea: Silvius calls Autonoë only Vates; and the sibyl, Vates, major Vates, magna sacerdos, veri facunda sacerdos, docta comes Triviæ, Phœbei pectoris umbra fatidica, Cymes anus, Virgo, Sibylla, and Umbra Sibyllæ.—The priestess comes to conduct Æneas to the temple where the sibyl was, Æn. 6. ver. 35; and 'tis she that speaks to ver. 55: 'Tis the sybil herself that speaks afterwards, from ver. 82. to 155. The priestess appears again, ver. 244. and is succeeded again by the sibyl, from ver. 258. to the end. The whole course of the thing is thus: Æneas (ver. 2.) puts in with his fleet near cape Miseno. He sets out from thence for Cumæ; and stops (ver. 13.) in the portico of Apollo's temple there, while Achates goes for the priestess. She (ver. 35.) comes, and (ver. 41.) introduces him into the temple; where he makes his Prayer, (ver. 56.) and has his answers (ver. 83. and 125.) from the sibyl herself: who orders him to search for the golden bough; and to bury the person who lies dead (ver. 162.) in his fleet. He returns, and finds that person to be Misenus. Æneas himself assists (ver. 183.) in getting the wood for Misenus's funeral pile; which at the same time occasions his finding (ver. 187.) the golden bough. He carries it (ver. 211.) to the sibyl's; and returns (ver. 232) to pay his last rites to Misenus. Æneas goes to the lake of Avernus, (ver. 236.) between his fleet and the city of Cumæ; and is met there (ver. 244.) by the priestess. They perform (ver. 250.) the sacrifice. The sibyl (ver. 258.) comes, and (ver. 262.) leads the way to hell. Virgil does not say that Æneas arrived at Cumæ, but on the Cumæan shore. Now a great part of the coast about that city, (and particularly what we now call the coast of Baiæ) was then called the Cumæan shore. Ovid calls it so (Met. 14. 105.) in speaking of this very point; and says, that Æneas's fleet left Naples to the right; and steered on towards cape Miseno, on their left hand. That they anchored under the promontory of Miseno, appears too from Æneas's returning to bury Misenus; whose dead body (as the sibyl said) polluted his fleet. He bury'd it in that hill; and fixed his trumpet (ver. 235.) and an oar upon it; which remain'd there to Virgil's days, and for some time after: for Statius mentions it more than once.—Litus remoque notatus Collis, Lib. 5. Sylv. 3, 168.—Iliacoque jugum memorabile remo. Ibid. 8, 3. The sibyl's grot, as 'tis called, by which Virgil makes Æneas descend into hell, has one opening by the lake Avernus, and had another at Cumæ: and there was a passage went all under the hill, from one to the other. Virgil makes Æneas go quite through it, by his perpetual way of inferring things, rather than saying them directly; and then return (ver. 900.) the nearest way to his fleet, and set sail for Cajeta. Ovid says expressly (Met. 14, 157.) that he came out at Cumæ. Holdsworth, and Spence.Thus spoke the Sibyl from her dark abode The dread mysterious answers of the god; The wond'rous truths, involv'd in riddles, gave, And, furious, bellow'd round the gloomy cave. Apollo shook his rod; possest her whole, Pour'd in his fires, and rein'd her raging soul. At length the fierce etherial transports cease, And all the heavenly fury sunk in peace. When thus the chief—O sacred dame! I know Too well already my predestin'd woe; But grant my pray'r!—Since here, as fame relates, Lies the dread road to Pluto's gloomy gates; Where baleful Acheron spreads, far and wide, His livid, melancholy, murmuring tide; Unfold these portals, and thy suppliant lead Down to the dark dominions of the dead: Give me to view my father's reverend face, And rush with transport to his dear embrace! Him through embattled armies I convey'd, While javelins hist, and flames around me play'd. He shar'd my toils, determin'd to defy The storms of every sea and every sky; In hardships, cares and dangers to engage; Nor spar'd his stooping venerable age. Yet more—he bade me to thy cell repair, And seek thy potent aid with suppliant pray'r: Oh! hear our joint request, our just desire; And guide the son, in pity to the sire. Your's is the pow'r, for Hecaté bestow'd On you the rule of this infernal wood. If Orpheus by his lyre's enchanting strain Could call his consort from the shades again; Ver. 170. Pollux—Castor and Pollux were the two sons of Leda, one by Jupiter, the other by Tyndarus; consequently one was immortal, and the other mortal. Castor being killed, Pollux demanded of his father Jupiter, that his brother might share his immortality with him. Jupiter consented, and they alternately lived and died.If Pollux dy'd alternate, to convey His ransom'd brother to the realms of day, And trod so oft the same infernal way? Why should I Theseus, why Alcides name, Each heroe sprung but from a mortal dame? To hell those chiefs descended from above: I claim a juster right; for I can prove My birth from Venus; my descent from Jove. Then to the Trojan heroe, as he pray'd And grasp'd the altars, spoke the sacred maid: O glorious prince! of brave Anchises' line, Great, godlike heroe, sprung from seed divine! Smooth lies the road to Pluto's gloomy shade; And hell's black gates for ever stand display'd: But 'tis a long unconquerable pain, To climb to these etherial realms again. The choice selected few, whom fav'ring Jove, Or their own virtue rais'd to heav'n above, From these dark realms emerg'd again to day; The mighty sons of gods! and only they! The frightful entrance lies perplex'd with woods, Inclos'd with sad Cocytus' sullen floods. But since you long to pass the realms beneath, The dreadful realms of darkness and of death, Twice the dire Stygian stream to measure o'er, And twice the black Tartarean gulf explore: First, take my counsel, then securely go. A mighty tree, that bears a golden bough, Grows in a vale, surrounded with a grove, And sacred to the queen of Stygian Jove. Her nether world no mortals can behold, Till from the bole they strip the blooming gold. The mighty queen requires this gift alone, And claims the shining wonder for her own. One pluck'd away, a second branch you see Shoot forth in gold, and glitter through the tree. Go then; with care erect thy searching eyes, And in proud triumph seize the glorious prize. Thy purpos'd journey if the fates allow, Free to thy touch shall bend the costly bough: If not; the tree will mortal strength disdain; And steel shall hew the glitt'ring branch in vain. Besides, while here my counsel you implore, Your breathless friend, unburied on the shore, (Ah! hapless warrior! in thy absence lost) The camp unhallows, and pollutes the host. First let his cold remains in earth be laid, And decent in the grave dispose the dead. The due lustration next perform, and bring The sable victims for the Stygian king. Then to the realms of hell shalt thou repair, Untrod by those who breathe the vital air. Ver. 222. Returns—Perhaps there is no other instance in the classics, of the word ingreditur, in the original, signifying to leave: and for progreditur, there is no authority.She ceas'd; the mournful prince returns with sighs: On earth the drooping heroe fix'd his eyes. Deep in his melancholy thoughts he weigh'd The dire event, and all the Sibyl said; While at his side the good Achates shares The warrior's anguish, and divides his cares. Oft they divin'd in vain, what hapless friend Dead and expos'd, her dubious words intend. But when arriv'd, amid the crowded strand They saw Misenus stretch'd along the sand; The great Misenus, of celestial kind; Sprung from the mighty monarch of the wind; Whose trump, with noble clangors, fir'd from far Ver. 235. Blew the flames of war— There is an old tradition, that Eros, Virgil's secretary used to say, that as he was reading the following hemistick to his master, Ære ciere viros, ? The poet instantly added in a kind of enthusiasm, ? Martemque accendere cantû.Th'embattled hosts, and blew the flames of war. By Hector's side with unresisted might His javelin rag'd; his trumpet rouz'd the fight. But when that heroe on the Phrygian plain By stern Pelides' thund'ring arm was slain, He follow'd next Æneas' conqu'ring sword, As brave a warrior as his former lord. But while the daring mortal o'er the flood Rais'd his high notes, and challeng'd every god, With envy Triton heard the noble strain, And whelm'd the bold musician in the main. Around the body stood the mournful host, But his great master wept, and suffer'd most. The sorrowing troops the sibyl's words obey, And to the lofty forest bend their way, To bid the proud funereal pyre arise, And build the solemn structure to the skies. Then fled the savage from his dark abode; The well-ply'd axes echo thro' the wood. The piercing wedges cleave the crackling oak; Loud groan the trees and sink at every stroke. Ver. 256. The tall ash—The difference between the genius of Virgil and Statius is very visible on this occasion. The latter of whom minutely, and at length, describes the different sorts of trees that were cut down to make the funeral pile for Archemorus. While Virgil observes his usual and pregnant brevity, knowing he had not leisure to dwell on this subject, merely for the sake of a florid description. 'Tis observable, that Tasso has imitated Statius in this very particular.The tall ash tumbles from the mountain's crown; Th'aërial elms come crashing headlong down. First of the train, the prince, with thund'ring sound, Whirl'd his huge ax, and spread the ruin round. Then as the mighty forest he survey'd, O'ewhelm'd with care the thoughtful heroe pray'd: Oh! in this ample grove could I behold The tree that blooms with vegetable gold! Since truth inspir'd each word the Sibyl said; Too truly she pronounc'd Misenus dead! While yet he spoke, two doves before him flew: His mother's birds the chief with transport knew; Then, as they settled on the verdant plain, The joyful heroe pray'd, nor pray'd in vain: Be you my guides thro' airy tracks above, And lead my footsteps to the fatal grove; Point out the road (if any can be found,) Where the rich bough o'erspreads the sacred ground, With checquer'd darkness pierc'd by golden rays, And darts at once a shadow and a blaze: Thou too, O goddess mother! lead me on, Unfold these wonders, and relieve thy son. This said, he stop'd; but still his eager sight Watch'd every motion, and observ'd their flight. By turns they feed, by turns they gently fly; Th'advancing chief still follows with his eye. Arriv'd at length, where, breathing to the skies, Blue clouds of poison from Avernus rise, Swift from the deathful blast at once they spring, Cut the light air, and shoot upon the wing; Then on the wondrous tree the doves alight, Where shines the fatal bough divinely bright, That, gilding all the leaves with glancing beams, Strikes through the sullen shade with golden gleams: As when bleak winter binds the frozen skies, Push'd from the oak her foreign honours rise; The lofty trunk th'adopted branches crown, Grac'd with a Misletoe. yellow offspring not her own: So with bright beams, all beauteous to behold, Glow'd on the dusky tree the blooming gold; The blooming gold, by every breath inclin'd, Flam'd as it wav'd, and twinkled in the wind. The chief with transport stripp'd the branching oar, And the rich trophy to the Sibyl bore. Next on the strand, with tears the Trojans paid The last sad honours to Misenus' shade: With cloven oaks and unctuous pines, they rear A stately solemn pile aloft in air. With sable wreaths they deck the sides around, The spreading front with baleful cypress bound, And with his arms the tow'ring structure crown'd. Some the huge cauldron fill; the foaming stream From the deep womb mounts bubbling o'er the brim. With groans the train anoint and bathe the dead, O'er the cold limbs his purple garment spread, And place him decent on the funeral bed; While these support the bier, and in their hands, Ver. 313. With looks averted—It was the custom at the Roman funerals, for the parents, or nearest relations of the dead, to set fire to the funeral pile, and to turn away their heads, in sign of sorrow and reluctance. Chorinæus was the pontiff or supreme priest of the Trojan colony. He is again spoken of, Book 12.With looks averted, hold the flaming brands: The rite of old!—rich incense loads the pyre, And oils and slaughter'd victims feed the fire. Soon as the pyle, subsiding, flames no more, With wine the smoaking heap they sprinkled o'er: Then Chorinæus took the charge, to place The bones selected in a brazen vase: A verdant branch of olive in his hands, He mov'd around, and purify'd the bands; Slow as he past, the lustral waters shed, Ver. 323. Invok'd—This solemn adieu was to report the word vale, thrice; or else the word ilicet. Catrou.Then clos'd the rites, and thrice invok'd the dead. This done; to solemnize the warrior's doom, The pious heroe rais'd a lofty tomb; The tow'ring top his well-known ensigns bore, His arms, his once-loud trump, and tapering oar: Beneath the mountain rose the mighty frame, Ver. 329. That bears from age to age Misenus' name.—This mountain which is situated in the kingdom of Naples, is at this day called Monte Miseno. How must a Roman (says Mr. Addison) have been pleased, that was well acquainted with the capes and promontories, to see the original of their names as they stand derived from Misenus, Palinurus, and Cajeta? that could follow the poet's motions, and attend his heroe in all his marches from place to place? Dissertation on antient and modern Learning.That bears from age to age Misenus' name. These rites discharg'd; the Sibyl to obey, Swift from the tomb the heroe bends his way. Deep, deep, a cavern lies, devoid of light, All rough with rocks, and horrible to sight; Its dreadful mouth is fenc'd with sable floods, And the brown horrors of surrounding woods. From its black jaws such baleful vapours rise, Blot the bright day, and blast the golden skies, That not a bird can stretch her pinions there Through the thick poisons and incumber'd air, But struck by death her flagging pinions cease; And hence Aörnus was it call'd by Greece. Hither the priestess four black heifers led, Between their horns the hallow'd wine she shed; From their high front the topmost hairs she drew, And in the flames the first oblations threw. Then calls on potent Hecate, renown'd In heav'n above, and Erebus profound. The victims next th'attendants kill'd, and stood With ample chargers, to receive the blood. To earth and night a lamb of sable hue, With solemn rites, the pious heroe slew. Next, by the knife a barren heifer fell To great Persephone the queen of hell. Then to her lord, infernal Jove, he paid A large oblation in the gloomy shade; And oils amid the burning entrails pour'd, While slaughter'd bulls the sacred flames devour'd. When lo! by dawning day, with dreadful sound, Beneath their footsteps groans the heaving ground; The groves all wave; the forests tremble round. Pale Hecate forsook the nether sky, And howling dogs proclaim'd the goddess nigh. Fly, ye prophane! far, far away, remove (Exclaims the Sybil) from the sacred grove: And thou, Æneas, draw thy shining steel, And boldly take the dreadful road to hell. To the great task thy strength and courage call, With all thy pow'rs; this instant claims them all. This said; she plunges down the deep descent; The prince as boldly follow'd where she went. Ver. 371. Ye subterraneous gods—The poet's stopping suddenly in his narration, and breaking out into this most solemn and majestic address to the subterraneous deities, is a very striking circumstance: it raises the reader's attention to a great degree; it alarms one with a kind of religious dread and awfulness, and prepares the mind for the astonishing scenes that are to follow.Ye subterraneous gods! whose awful sway The gliding ghosts and silent shades obey; O Chaos hoar! and Phlegethon profound! Whose solemn empire stretches wide around; Give me, ye great tremendous pow'rs to tell Of scenes, and wonders in the depths of hell; Give me your mighty secrets to display From those black realms of darkness to the day; Now through the dismal gloom they pass, and tread Grim Pluto's courts, the regions of the dead; As puzzled travellers bewilder'd move, (The moon scarce glimmering thro' the dusky grove) When Jove from mortal eyes has snatch'd the light, And wrap'd the world in undistinguish'd night. Ver. 385. At hell's great mouth a thousand monsters wait, Grief weeps— This groupe of allegorical personages is admirably painted, and judiciously placed. Spencer has introduced some personified figures in the entrance to Mammon's cave, that are not to be met with in Virgil; but I think are represented in a very picturesque manner: By that way's side, there sat infernal Pain, And fast beside him sat tumultuous Strife, The one in hand an iron whip did strain, The other brandished a bloody knife, And both did gnash their teeth, and both did threaten life. Afterwards— But gnawing Jealousy out of their sight, Sitting alone, his bitter lips did bite; And trembling Fear still to and fro did fly, And found no place where safe he shroud him might. And over them sad Horrour, with grim hue Did always soar, beating his iron wings! &amp;c. This last image is bold, but I think allowable, as it does not, I believe, transgress against any of those excellent rules which Mr. Spence has judiciously laid down, for the forming allegorical personages with propriety, in the 19th Dialogue of Polymetis. Not one of the many critics and commentators, who have written remarks on this sixth book of Virgil, take the least notice that Virgil seems to have an eye on a fine passage of Lucretius; where that great poet describes some of these very allegorical personages, which Virgil has introduced as standing before the gates of death. Turpis enim fama, &amp; contemptus, &amp; acris egestas, Semota ab dulci vitâ stabilique videntur Et quasi jam Lethi portas cunctarior ante. Since this was written I find Catrou has taken notice of this passage.At hell's dread mouth a thousand monsters wait; Grief weeps, and Vengeance bellows in the gate: Base Want, low Fear, and Famine's lawless rage, And pale Disease, and slow repining Age, Fierce, formidable fiends! the portal keep; With Pain, Toil, Death, and Death's half-brother Sleep. There, Joys, embitter'd with remorse, appear; Daughters of Guilt! here storms destructive War. Mad Discord there her snaky tresses tore; Here, stretch'd on iron beds, the Furies roar. Full in the midst a spreading elm display'd His aged arms, and cast a mighty shade. Each trembling leaf with some light vision teems, And heaves impregnated with airy dreams. With double forms each Scylla took her place In hell's dark entrance, with the Centaur's race; And, close by Lerna's hissing monster, stands Briareus dreadful with an hundred hands. There stern Geryon rag'd; and, all around, Fierce Harpies scream'd, and direful Gorgons frown'd: Ver. 405. Here from Chimæra's jaws— Milton seems to have carried the description of the monsters in hell farther than any poet whatsoever. ? where nature breeds Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable; and worse Than fables yet have feign'd or fear conceiv'd, Gorgons, and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire. Parad. lost, B. 1. 624. By leaving it to the imagination to conceive something more dreadful than words can describe, he gives the highest idea of the horror and direfulness of the place.Here from Chimæra's jaws long flames expire; And the huge fiend was wrap'd in smoak and fire. Scar'd at the sight, his sword the heroe drew At the grim monsters, as they rose to view. His guide then warn'd him, not to wage the war With thin light forms, and images of air; Else had he rush'd amid th'impassive train, And madly struck at empty shades in vain. Ver. 413. From hence a dark— In talking of the poetical hell of the old Romans, I know not how one can do better, than to follow exactly the account which is given us by the best poet that the Romans ever had. Virgil's general character is exactness; and he seems to have shewn it particularly on this occasion. His account of the subterraneous world is much the most regular and the most compleat we meet with in any of the Greek, as well as Latin poets, that remain to us. Hence it is, that Silius Italicus, (who ought perhaps to have more the authority of an historian, than that of a poet,) sets Virgil's account of hell on a level with the principal subject of his Æneid: and seems to insinuate, that he laid out all the parts of it in as exact order, before he saw it; as he could have done, after he was an inhabitant of those lower regions. The whole imaginary world beneath the surface of the earth, which we call hell, (tho' according to the antients it was the receptacle of all departed persons, of the good as well as the bad,) is divided, by Virgil, into five parts: The first may be called the previous region. The second is the region of waters, or the river, which they were all to pass. The third is what we may call, the gloomy region; and what the antients called Erebus. The fourth is Tartarus, or the region of torments: And the fifth, the regions of joy and bliss; or what we still call Elysium. It may be worth while to enquire a little more particularly into the disposition which Virgil has made of the nether worlds into these five parts; and what sort of personages or inhabitants, he assigns to each of them. The first part in it, (which I call the previous region, as being only the suburbs of the realms of death,) Virgil has stocked with two sorts of beings. First, with those which make the real misery of mankind upon earth; such as war, discord, labour, grief, cares, distempers, and old age: And secondly, with fancied terrors, and all the most frightful creatures of our own imagination; such as gorgons, harpies, chimæra's, and the like. The next is the water, which all the departed were supposed to pass, to enter into the other world. This was called Styx; or, the hateful passage. The imaginary personages of this division are the souls of the departed, who are either passing over, or sueing for a passage; and, the master of the vessel, who carries them over, one freight after another, according to his will and pleasure. The third division begins immediately with the bank on the other side of the river; and was supposed to extend a great way in. It is subdivided again into several particular districts. The first seems to be the receptacle for infants; or, the limbus infantum. Then is the limbo, for all such as have been put to death without a cause. Next, is the place for those who have put a period to their own lives: A melancholy region; and situated amidst the marshes, made by the overflowings of the hateful river, or passage into the other world. After this, are the fields of mourning; full of dark woods and groves, and inhabited by those who died for love. Last of all, spreads an open champion country, allotted for the souls of departed warriors. The name of this whole division is Erebus. The several districts of this division seem to be disposed all in a line, one after the other; but after this, the great line or road divides into two: of which, the right-hand road leads to Elysium, or the place of the blest; and the left-hand road to Tartarus, or the place of the tormented. The fourth general division of the subterraneous world, is this Tartarus, or the place of torments. There was a city in it, and a prince to preside over it. Within this city was a vast deep pit, in which the tortures were supposed to be performed. In this horrid part Virgil places two sorts of souls: first, such, as have shewn their impiety and rebellion toward the gods; and secondly, such, as have been vile or mischievous among men. Those, (as he himself says of the latter, more particularly,) who hated their brethren; used their parents ill; or cheated their dependants; who made no use of their riches; who committed incest, or disturbed the marriage-union of others: those who were rebellious subjects, or knavish servants; who were despisers of justice, and betrayers of their country; and who made and unmade laws, not for the good of the public, but only to get money to themselves. All these, and the despisers of the gods, Virgil places in this most horrid division of his subterraneous world; and in the vast abyss, which was the most terrible even of that division. The fifth division is that of Elysium, or the place of the blest. Here Virgil places those who died for their country; those of pure lives; truly inspired poets; the inventors of arts; and all who have done good to mankind. He does not speak of any particular districts for these; but supposes, that they have the liberty of going where they please in that delightful region, and conversing with whom they pleased. He only mentions one vale, toward the end of it, as appropriated to any particular use: This is the vale of Lethe, or forgetfulness; where many of the ancient philosophers, and the Platonists in particular, supposed the souls which had passed through some periods of their trial, were immersed in the river which gives its name to it; in order to be put into new bodies, and to fill up the whole course of their probation in our upper world. In each of these three divisions on the other side of the river Styx, (which perhaps were comprehended under the name of Ades, as all the five might be under the name of Orcus,) was a prince, or judge: Minos, for the regions of Erebus; Rhadamanthus, for Tartarus; and Æacus, for Elysium. Pluto and Proserpine had their palace at the entrance of the road to the Elysian fields; and presided, as sovereigns, over the whole subterraneous world. Polymetis, Dialogue 16.From hence a dark uncomfortable road Leads to dread Acheron's Tartarean flood, Whose furious whirlpools boil on every side, And in Cocytus pour the roaring tide All stain'd with ooze, and black with rising sands, Lord of the flood, imperious Charon stands; But rough, begrim'd, and dreadful he appear'd; Rude and neglected hung his length of beard; All patch'd and knotted flutters his attire; His wrathful eyeballs glare with sanguine fire. Tho' old, still unimpair'd by years he stood, And hoary vigour blest the surly god. Himself still ply'd the oars, the canvas spread, And in his sable bark convey'd the dead. Hither, a mighty crowd, a mingled host, Confus'd, came pouring round the Stygian coast. Men, matrons, boys and virgins, in the throng, With mighty kings, and heroes march'd along; And blooming youths, before their mournful sires Stretch'd out untimely on their funeral pyres; Thick as the leaves come fluttering from above, When cooler autumn strips the blasted grove: Thick, as the feather'd flocks, in close array, O'er the wide fields of ocean wing their way, When from the rage of winter they repair To warmer suns, and more indulgent air. All stretch their suppliant hands, and all implore The first kind passage to the farther shore. Now these, now those, he singles from the host, And some he drives all trembling from the coast. The prince astonish'd at the tumult, cry'd, Why crowd such mighty numbers to the tide? Why are those favour'd ghosts transported o'er? And these sad shades chas'd backward from the shore? The full of days, the Sybil thus replies; Great prince, the true descendant of the skies! You see Cocytus' stream; the Stygian floods, Whose awful sanction binds th'attesting gods. Those, who neglected on the strand remain, Are all a wretched, poor, unbury'd train. Charon is he, who o'er the flood presides; And those interr'd, who cross the Stygian tides. No mortals pass the hoarse-resounding wave, But those who slumber in the peaceful grave. Thus, till a hundred years have roll'd away, Around these shores the plaintive spectres stray. That mighty term expir'd, their wanderings past, They reach the long expected shore at last. Ver. 461. Struck with their fate—According to the tenderness and humanity with which the heroe is always painted. Historians speak much of the sensibility and compassionate temper of Augustus.Struck with their fate, his steps the heroe stay'd, And with soft pity all the crowd survey'd. When lo! Leucaspis in the throng he 'spy'd; And great Orontes, once the Lycian guide; Sullen and sad; for fate's relentless doom Deny'd the chiefs, the honour of a tomb; Whose galley, whirl'd by tempests round and round, Sunk, by a mighty surge devour'd and drown'd. Ver. 469. His pilot—This interview with Palinurus is not only very affecting in itself, but is of use to make us acquainted what became of him, after he was lost in the fifth book. The pilot of such an expedition is a character of consequence.Now drew his pilot Palinurus nigh, Who watching every star that gilds the sky, While from the Libyan shores his course he keeps, From the tall stern plung'd headlong down the deeps. Pensive his slow approach the spectre made, When, as the prince had scarce his form survey'd Thro' the thick gloom, he first address'd the shade: What godhead whelm'd my friend, our faithful guide, Beneath the roarings of the dreadful tide? Tell me—for oh! I never could complain, Till now, of Phœbus, nor believ'd in vain. Once he foretold—(but ah! those hopes are lost) That Palinure should reach th'Ausonian coast, Safe from the giddy storm and rolling flood; Is this, is this the promise of a god? Nor Phœbus, he replies, foretold in vain, Nor has a god o'erwhelm'd me in the main. No—as I steer'd along the foamy sea, Headlong I fell, and tore the helm away. But by those fierce tumultuous floods I swear, For my own life I never felt a fear, For your's alone I trembled, lest the ship, Left all at large and bounding o'er the deep, Robb'd of her helm and long-experienc'd guide, Should sink, o'erwhelm'd in such a furious tide. For three long stormy nights sublime I rode, Heav'd by the southern tempests o'er the flood; At early dawn my eyes could just explore, From a tall tow'ring surge, th'Italian shore. Thus tir'd, the land I gain by slow degrees, And 'scap'd at length the dangers of the seas; But hopes of prey the savage natives led, And, while I grasp'd the shaggy mountain's head, (My cumb'rous vests yet heavy from the main,) By barbarous hands thy helpless friend was slain. And now by floating surges am I tost, With every wind, and dash'd upon the coast, But by the light of yon' etherial air, By thy dead father, and surviving heir, O prince! thy pity to a wretch extend; And from these dismal realms enlarge thy friend. Or to the Veline port direct thy way, And in the ground my breathless body lay: Or, if thy goddess-mother can disclose Some means to fix a period to my woes, (For sure uncall'd, unguided by the gods, You durst not pass these dreadful Stygian floods) Lend to a pining wretch thy friendly hand, And waft him with thee to the farther strand! Thus, in this dismal state of death, at least My wand'ring soul may lie compos'd in rest. And how, reply'd the dame, could rise in man A wish so impious; or a thought so vain! Uncall'd, unbury'd, wouldst thou venture o'er, And view th'infernal fiends who guard the shore? Hope not to turn the course of fate by pray'r, Or bend the gods inflexibly severe: But bear thy doom content; while I disclose A beam of comfort to relieve thy woes; For know, the nations bord'ring on the floods, Alarm'd by direful omens of the gods, In full atonement of thy death shall rear A mighty tomb, and annual offerings bear. The place, from age to age renown'd by fame, Still shall be known by Palinurus' name. These words reliev'd his sorrows, and display'd A dawn of joy to please the pensive shade. Now they proceed; but soon the pilot spy'd The strangers from the wood approach the tide. Then to the godlike chief, in wrath he said, Mortal! whoe'er thou art, in arms array'd, Stand off; approach not; but at distance say, Why to these waters dar'st thou bend thy way? These are the realms of Sleep, the dreadful coasts Of sable Night, and airy gliding ghosts. No living mortals o'er the stream I lead; Our bark is only sacred to the dead. Know, I repent I led Pirithoüs o'er, With mighty Theseus, to the farther shore; That great Alcides past the Stygian floods; Tho' these were heroes, and the sons of gods. From Pluto's throne, this drag'd in chains away Hell's triple porter, trembling, to the day. Those from his lofty dome aspir'd to lead The beauteous partner of his royal bed. To whom the sacred dame—how vain thy fear! These arms intend no violence or war. May the huge dog thro' all the Stygian coasts, Roar from his den, and scare the flying ghosts; Untouch'd and chaste, Persephonè may dwell, And with grim Pluto share the throne of hell: The Trojan prince, Æneas, far around For valour, arms and piety renown'd, Thro' these infernal realms decrees to go, And meet his father in the shades below. To bend thy mind, if such high virtue fail, At least this glorious present must prevail; (Then show'd the bough, that lay beneath her vest.) At once his rising wrath was hush'd to rest; At once stood reconcil'd the ruthless god, And bow'd with reverence to the golden rod; Bow'd, and refus'd his office now no more, But turns the sable vessel to the shore; Drives from the deck the flitting airy train; Then in the bark receiv'd the mighty man. The feeble vessel groans beneath the load, And drinks at many a leak th'infernal flood. The dame and prince at last are wafted o'er Safe to the slimy strand and oozy shore. Arriv'd, they first grim Cerberus survey; Stretch'd in his den th'enormous monster lay. His three wide mouths, with many a dreadful yell, And long, loud bellowings, shook the realms of hell: Now o'er his neck the starting serpents rose, When to the fiend the dame a morsel throws. Honey, and drugs, and poppy juices steep The temper'd mass with all the pow'rs of sleep. With three huge gaping mouths, impatient flies The growling savage, and devours the prize; Then, by the charm subdu'd, he sunk away; And, stretch'd all o'er the cave, the slumb'ring monster lay. The fiend thus lull'd, the heroe took the road, And left behind th'irremeable flood. Now, as they enter'd, doleful screams they hear; And tender cries of infants pierce the ear. Just new to life, by too severe a doom, Snatch'd from the cradle to the silent tomb! Next, mighty numbers crowd the verge of hell, Who by a partial charge and sentence fell. Here, by a juster lot, their seats they took; The fatal urn imperious Minos shook, Convenes a council, bids the spectres plead, Rehears the wretches, and absolves the dead. Then crowds succeed, who, prodigal of breath, Themselves anticipate the doom of death; Tho' free from guilt, they cast their lives away, And sad and sullen hate the golden day. Ver. 606. Oh! with what joy!—Plato's opinion of suicide is well known: who compares the self-murderer to a soldier who deserts his post, without an order from his general. Some commentators, justly imagine, that Virgil inserts this stricture on the crime of suicide, in order to lessen the glory of Cato, the great and illustrious enemy of the Cæsars.Oh! with what joy the wretches now would bear Pain, toil and woe, to breathe the vital air! In vain!—by fate for ever are they bound With dire Avernus, and the lake profound; And Styx with nine wide channels roars around. Next, open wide the melancholy plains, Where lovers pine in everlasting pains; Those soft consuming flames they felt alive, Pursue the wretches, and in death survive. Here, where the myrtle groves their shades display, In cover'd walks they pass their hours away. Ver 6l7. Evadne, Phædra—The short history of these unfortunate ladies, is as follows: Phædra, the wife of Theseus, being in love with her son-in-law Hypolitus, and he continuing inflexibly deaf to her incestuous passion, she first accuses him wrongfully to his father of attempting her virtue, and then murders herself out of remorse; the fine tragedies of Euripides, Racine, and Mr. Smith, on this subject, are well known. I cannot help observing, that the history is falsify'd, and the most pathetic part of the fable destroyed in the last of these plays, from an ill-grounded notion of poetical justice. Evadne, the wife of Capaneus, so desperately loved her husband, that she cast herself on the funeral pyre when his body was burning. Procris the wife of Cephalus, was extremely jealous of her husband: in hopes of surprising him, she concealed herself in a thicket, where she imagined he met his mistress: Cephalus hearing her move, and imagining it to be a wild beast, bent his bow, and shot her dead. Eryphile, the wife of Amphiaraus, discovered to Adrastus, the place where her husband had concealed himself, to avoid going to the Theban war. Amphiaraus perishing before Thebes, Alcmeon his son revenged his death, by slaughtering his mother. Pasiphaë was said to be the daughter of the sun, and wife to Minos king of Crete; she fell desperately in love with a bull. Cænis the daughter of Elatus, a Lapithan, obtained of her lover Neptune as a reward of her prostitution, that she might be transformed into a man, and rendered invulnerable: But the gods being offended at her pride and cruelty, she was destroyed in the war with the Lapithae, and made a woman again after her death, that for her impieties she might be deprived of both the favours which Neptune had granted to her. Laodamia was so fond of her husband Protesilaus, that after he was killed before the walls of Thebes, she begged of the gods she might see his ghost; which being granted, she perished in his embraces. 'Tis observable, that the poet says, the place allotted for the band of lovers, was very spacious and extensive; by which he signifies, say some critics, the frequency as well as danger of this universal passion.Evadne, Phædra, Procris he survey'd, Pasiphaë next, and Laodamia's shade. Stabb'd by her son, false Eriphylé there Points to her wound, and lays her bosom bare: Cœneus, who try'd both sexes, trod the plain, Now to a woman chang'd by fate again. With these, fair Dido rang'd the silent wood, New from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood; The chief, advancing thro' the shady scene, Scarce thro' the gloom discern'd the sullen queen: So the pale moon scarce glimmers to the eye, When first she rises in a clouded sky. He wept, and thus addrest her in the grove, With all the melting tenderness of love; Then was it true, that by revengeful steel, Stung with despair, unhappy Dido fell? And I, was I the cause of that despair? Yet oh! I vow by every golden star; By all the pow'rs th'etherial regions know, By all the pow'rs that rule the world below, I left your realm reluctant; o'er the floods Call'd by the fates, and summon'd by the gods; Th'immortal gods;—by whose commands I come From yon' bright realms to this eternal gloom: Condemn'd the wasteful deep of night to tread, And pass these doleful regions of the dead. Ah! could I think, when urg'd by heav'n to go, My flight would plunge you in the depth of woe! Stay, Dido, stay, and see from whom you fly! 'Tis from your fond repentant lover's eye. Turn then one moment, and my vows believe, The last, last moment fate will ever give! Nought to these tender words the fair replies, But fixt on earth her unrelenting eyes. The chief still weeping; with a sullen mein, Ver. 652. In stedfast silence frown'd th'obdurate queen— 'Tis well known, that this silence of Dido is copied from that of Ajax, in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey; which is nobly imagined, and cannot be enough admired. Longinus, in his ninth section, produces it as one of the strongest examples of the true sublime: His excellent translator observes, that Dido, in Virgil, behaves with the same greatness and majesty, as Homer's Ajax. He disdains the conversation of the man, who, to his thinking, had injuriously defrauded him of the arms of Achilles; and she scorns to hold conference with him, who, in her own opinion, had basely forsook her; and, by her silent retreat, shews her resentment, and reprimands Æneas more than she could have done in a thousand words. The pathetic as well as the grand, is expressed as strongly by silence, or a bare word, as in a number of periods. Thus far Mr. Smith, in his judicious notes on Longinus. I cannot forbear adding a most beautiful passage on this subject, taken from the second book of Quintilian's Institutes. Quid? nonne in oratione operienda sunt quædam, sive ostendi non debent, sive exprimi pro dignitate non possunt? ut fecit Timanthes, et opinor, Cithnius, in eâ tabulâ quâ Colotem Teium vicit. Nam cum in Iphigeniæ immolatione pinxisset tristem Calchantem, tristiorem Ulyssem, addidisset Menelao quem summum poterat ars efficere mærorem: consumtis affectibus, non reperiens quo dignè modo patris vultum posset exprimere, velavit ejus caput, &amp; suo cuique animo dedit æstimandum. Nonne huic simile est illud Sallustianum? nam de Carthagine tacere satius puto, quam parum dicere. A late judicious writer is singular in his opinion of this celebrated silence, whose words are worth the consideration of the reader. ‘The warmest admirers of the great Mantuan poet, can extol him for little more than the skill with which he has, by making his heroe both a traveller and a warrior, united the beauties of the Iliad and Odyssey in one composition: yet his judgment was perhaps sometimes overborne by his avarice of the Homeric treasures; and for fear of suffering a sparkling ornament to be lost, he has inserted it where it cannot shine with its original splendor. ‘When Ulysses visited the infernal regions, he found, that among the heroes that perished at Troy, his competitor Ajax, who, when the arms of Achilles were adjudged to Ulysses, died by his own hand in the madness of disappointment. He still appeared to resent, as on earth, his loss and disgrace. Ulysses endeavoured to pacify him with praises and submission; but Ajax walked away without reply. This passage has always been considered as eminently beautiful; because Ajax the haughty chief, the unletter'd soldier, of unshaken courage, of immoveable constancy, but without the power of recommending his own virtues by eloquence, or inforcing his assertions by any other arguments than the sword, had no way of making his anger known, but by gloomy sullenness and dumb ferocity. His hatred of a man whom he conceived to have defeated him only by volubility of tongue, was therefore naturally shewn by silence more contemptuous and piercing, than any words that so rude an orator could have found, and by which he gave his enemy no opportunity of exerting the only power in which he was superior. ‘When Æneas is sent by Virgil to visit the shades, he meets with Dido the queen of Carthage, whom his perfidy had hurried to the grave: he accosts her with tenderness, and excuses; but the lady turns away, like Ajax in mute disdain. She turns away like Ajax—but she resembles him in none of those qualities which might give either dignity or propriety to silence. She might, without any departure from the tenor of her conduct, have burst out, like other injured women, into clamor, reproach, and denunciation. But Virgil had his imagination full of Ajax, and therefore could not prevail on himself to teach Dido any other mode of resentment.’ The Rambler, N?. 121.In stedfast silence, frown'd th'obdurate queen. Fixt as a rock amidst the roaring main, She hears him sigh, implore, and plead in vain. Then, where the woods their thickest shades display, From his detested sight she shoots away; There from her dear Sichæus, in the grove, Found all her cares repaid, and love return'd for love. Touch'd with her woes, the prince, with streaming eyes And floods of tears, pursues her as she flies. Hence he proceeds; and last the fields appear, Where stalk'd the proud heroic sons of war. Ver. 663. Tydeus and pale Adrastus—Æneas now meets with the ancient heroes, who had been celebrated in the Theban war. Tydeus the son of Æneas was slain in that war by Menalippus. He was the father of Diomed, so celebrated in the Iliad. Parthenopæus, the son of Atalanta and Meleager, and king of the Arcadians, perished likewise at Thebes. Adrastus was king of Sicyon, and afterwards Argos, who losing great part of his army before Thebes, fled and returned home. 'Tis on account of this flight that Virgil gives him the epithet of Pallentis. The names of Agenor's sons were Polybus, Agenor, and Achamas, according to Pomponius Sabinus; or Archilochus, Acamas and Helicon, according to other writers. Idæus was Priam's charioteer. 'Tis Plato's doctrine, that the soul retains its principal inclinations and affections after death.Tydeus and pale Adrastus rose to sight, With Parthenopæus. Atalanta's son renown'd in fight. Here, a long crowd of chiefs the prince beheld, Who fell lamented in the glorious field, His Trojan friends;—with sighs he view'd the train; Three valiant sons of sage Antenor slain: Here brave Thersilocus and Glaucus stood, Medon and Polyœtes bath'd in blood. Idæus there still glories in alarms, Vaults on his car, and wields his shining arms. Eager to view the chief, on either hand, Rank behind rank, the eager warriors stand: All in their turn retard the prince, to know What urg'd his journey to the shades below. Ver. 677. Not so the kings of Greece—appall'd—This circumstance is very finely imagined, and does the heroe the greatest honour. For as the dead retain their old habits, their flying from the sight of Æneas, was a sign they had often done the same in life, during the siege of Troy. Dr. Trapp observes, that Ulysses does not fright the Trojan ghosts in the 11th Odyssey. Indeed no author, either before or since Virgil, is comparable to him in his judicious choice of particular circumstances, and his skill in making them various, new, and natural.Not so the kings of Greece—appall'd, dismay'd, The hostile chiefs the godlike man survey'd In arms that glitter'd thro' the dusky shade. Some turn'd and fled, astonish'd at the view As when before him to their fleets they flew. Some rais'd a cry; the flutt'ring accents hung And dy'd imperfect on the trembling tongue. Here Priam's son, Deïphobus, he found; The mangled youth was one continu'd wound. For now his face, his beauteous face appears Ver. 687. For now his face, his beauteous face appears, Gash'd and dishonour'd with a thousand scars— This mangled phantom is drawn according to the philosophy of Plato: who teaches in his Gorgias, that the dead not only retain all the passions of the soul, but all the marks and blemishes of the body. ????????? ?? ????? ??, [] ???? ???? ??? ?????? ????? ?? ?? ??????, ? ??? ???????? ? ????? ????????? ????, [] ????????? ?? ???? ????? ????? ????? ????.Gash'd, and dishonour'd with a thousand scars. His hands, ears, nostrils, hideous to survey! The stern insulting foes had lopp'd away; Trembling he stood, industrious to conceal The bloody traces of the ruthless steel. Soon as the prince discern'd him, he began, And thus deplor'd the miserable man: O brave Deïphobus! O chief divine! Sprung from majestic Teucer's martial line; What fierce barbarian hands could thus disgrace Thy manly figure, and thy beauteous face? In that last night, when Ilion sunk in flame, I heard, brave warrior! from the voice of fame, You fell on heaps of foes, with slaughter tir'd, And on the glorious purple pile expir'd. With care I rais'd on our Rhoëtean coast A vacant tomb, and hail'd thy mighty ghost: Thy name and arms adorn the place around; And, had thy mangled bleeding corse been found, Thy relicks had repos'd in Trojan ground. My friend (replies the chief) has duly paid, All funeral honours to my pensive shade; But these dire woes from fatal Helen came; These are the triumphs of the Spartan dame! For well, too well you know, in what delight We fondly spent our last destructive night: When the vast monster big with Ilion's doom, Tower'd thro' the town, an army in its womb; In solemn show she bade the dames advance, And in dissembled Orgies led the dance; A flaming torch she brandish'd in her hand; Then from the tow'r invites the Grecian band, While, worn with labours I repos'd my head (Ah wretch ill-fated!) on our bridal bed. My heavy lids the dews of slumber steep, Lull'd in a soft, profound, and death-like sleep. Then from beneath my head, as tir'd I lay, My loyal bride conveys my sword away, Removes my arms, unfolds the door, and calls Her Spartan lord within my palace walls; Betrays her last, to please her former spouse, And cancel all the guilt of broken vows! Fierce they broke in, by dire Ulysses led, And basely slew me in the bridal bed. Hear my just pray'rs, ye gods!—to Greece repay A fate like mine; give all your vengeance way! But thee, O prince, what wondrous fortune led Alive, to these dominions of the dead? Say, did the will and counsel of the gods, Or the rude tempests and tumultuous floods, Compel thy course from yon' etherial light, To these dark realms of everlasting night? Mean time the swift-wing'd coursers of the sun Thro' heav'n full half their fiery race had run; And all th'appointed hours in talk had past, But thus the priestess warn'd the chief at last: Lo! night advances, prince!—we waste away In idle sorrows the remains of day. See—in two ample roads, the way divides; The right, direct, our destin'd journey guides, By Pluto's palace, to th'Elysian plains; The left to Tartarus, where, bound in chains, Loud houl the damn'd in everlasting pains. Dismiss thy wrath, replies the pensive shade, But one word more—I then rejoin the dead: Go—mighty prince, the promis'd throne ascend; Go—but with better fortune than thy friend! With these last accents, to the warrior host Retires the trembling, melancholy ghost. Now to the left, Æneas darts his eyes, Where lofty walls with triple ramparts rise. Ver. 758. There rolls swift Phlegethon— I cannot forbear quoting Milton's noble description of the rivers of hell: Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate; Sad Acheron, of sorrow; black and deep! Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud Heard on the rueful stream: fierce Phlegeton, Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. In how many instances has our countryman equalled, if not excelled, the Greek and Roman classics!There rolls swift Phlegethon, with thund'ring sound, His broken rocks, and whirls his surges round. Ver. 760. On mighty columns rais'd— In the following description Milton seems at least to have equal'd the Latin poet, sublime as he is: ? At last appear And thrice threefold the gates; threefold were brass; Three iron, three of adamantine rock; Impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire, Yet unconsum'd: ? Parad. lost, Book 2, 643.On mighty columns rais'd, sublime are hung The massy gates, impenetrably strong. In vain would men, in vain would gods essay, To hew the beams of adamant away. Ver. 764.—Before the gate, By night and day, a wakeful fury sate, The pale Tisiphone— Milton seems to have had this passage in his eye, in his description of sin and death, as the porters of hell— ? Before the gates there sat On either side a formidable shape; The one seem'd woman to the waist, and fair; But ended foul in many a scaly fold, Voluminous and vast? a serpent arm'd With mortal sting ? &amp;c. ? ? The other shape (If shape it might be call'd that shape had none, &amp;c.) ? Black it stood as night, Fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell, And shook a dreadful dart: what seem'd his head, The likeness of a kingly crown had on. Parad. lost, Book 2. 650. This famous allegory of sin and death, seems to be taken from St. James's Epistle, chap. 1. ver. 14.Here rose an iron tow'r: before the gate, By night and day, a wakeful fury sate, The pale Tisiphoné; a robe she wore, With all the pomp of horror, dy'd in gore. Ver. 768. Here the loud scourge and louder—&amp;c. There is something strangely terrifying to the imagination in Æneas's and the Sibyl's standing before the adamantine gates, and listening to the clank of chains, and the noise of iron whips, that were heard in those regions of pain and sorrow. Milton, whose imagination was equal to that of any one of the antients, has taken this hint and nobly improved it. Raphaël tells Adam, that he was sent on the day of creation to see that none of Satan's crew escaped from hell, as a spy, &amp;c. and adds, ? Fast we found, fast shut The dismal gates, and barricado'd strong; But long e'er our approaching heard within Noise, other than the sound of dance or song, Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage. Parad. lost. Book 8. ver. 240.Here the loud scourge and louder voice of pain, The crashing fetter, and the ratt'ling chain, Strike the great heroe with the frightful sound, The hoarse, rough, mingled din, that thunders round: Oh! whence that peal of groans? what pains are those? What crimes could merit such stupendous woes? Thus she—brave guardian of the Trojan state, None that are pure must pass that dreadful gate. When plac'd by Hecat o'er Avernus' woods, I learnt the secrets of those dire abodes, With all the tortures of the vengeful gods. Ver. 779. Here Rhadamanthus—Rhadamanthus was of Crete, the brother of the most celebrated Minos the Cretan lawgiver, and the son of Jupiter and Europa. Minos is said to have first delivered the system of the Cretan laws; and Rhadamanthus's business was to put them into execution. This Plutarch relates, in the life of Theseus. Æacus was likewise the son of Jupiter. These three celebrated personages, viz. Minos, Rhadamanthus and Æacus, are usually placed by the poets, as judges in the infernal regions, on account of the strictness and severity of judgment they exercised during their lives. Virgil makes no mention of Æacus.Here Rhadamanthus holds his awful reign, Hears and condemns the trembling impious train. Those hidden crimes the wretch till death supprest, With mingled joy and horror in his breast, The stern dread judge commands him to display; And lays the guilty secrets bare to day, Her lash Tisiphoné that moment shakes; The ghost she scourges with a thousand snakes; Then to her aid, with many a thund'ring yell, Calls her dire sisters from the gulphs of hell. Now the loud portals from their hinges flew, And all the dreadful scene appears in view. Behold (she cries) what direful monster waits (Tremendous form!) to guard the gloomy gates! Ver. 793. More dreadful Hydra—Fiercer than the common hydra, the bellua lernæ, which he places without, primis in faucibus orci, 287 and 273. anteh. in the original.Within, her bulk more dreadful hydra spreads, And hissing rears her fifty tow'ring heads. Full twice as deep the dungeon of the fiends, The huge, Tartarean, gloomy gulf descends Below these regions, as these regions lie From the bright realms of yon' etherial sky. Ver. 799. Here roar the Titan race—These were the giants, the sons of Earth and Titan, who made war on Jupiter, and heaping mountain on mountain, attempted to scale heaven. Hesiod has nobly described the battle that ensued between them and the gods. The Aleian twins, ver. 803. were Otus and Ephialtes, the sons of Neptune by Iphimedia. Salmoneus was king of Elis, and being quite intoxicated with pride, drove a chariot over a bridge of brass, and cast torches on his subjects, that he might imitate thunder and lightning. Mr. Warburton ingeniously observes, upon this whole passage, that Virgil judiciously places these atheistical despisers of God and religion. Hic genus antiquum, &amp;c.—This was agreeable to the laws of Charondas: who says, be the contempt of the gods put into the number of the most flagitious crimes. The poet dwells particularly on that species of impiety that affects divine honours, the story of Salmoneus. And this was doubtless designed by him for an oblique castigation of the adulation of the apotheosis, then beginning to be paid and to be received at Rome.Here roar the Titan race, th'enormous birth; The antient offspring of the teeming earth. Pierc'd by the burning bolts, of old they fell, And still roll bellowing in the depths of hell. Here lie th'Aleian twins, in length display'd; Stretch'd as they lie, the giants I survey'd, Who warr'd to drive the thunderer from above; And storm'd the skies, and shook the throne of Jove. There proud Salmoneus, wrapt in chains below, Raves in eternal agonies of woe; Who mock'd with empty sounds and mimic rays, Heav'n's awful thunder and the lightning's blaze; Th'audacious wretch thro' Elis tower'd in air, Whirl'd by four coursers in his rattling car; A blazing torch he shook; o'er crowds he rode; And madly claim'd the glories of a god. O'er hollow vaults he lash'd the steeds along, And, as they flew, the brazen arches rung. Vain fool! to mock the bolts of heav'n above, And those inimitable flames of Jove! But from the clouds, th'avenging father aims Far other bolts and undissembled flames: Dash'd from his car, the mimic thunderer fell, And in a fiery whirlwind plung'd to hell. Ver. 823. Tityus— Poetry never afforded a more lively and affecting description, than this of the punishment of Tityus. Lucretius has finely allegorized the story. Nec Tityon volucres ineunt Acheronte jacentem; Nec, quod sub magno scrutetur pectore, quidquam Perpetuam ætatem poterunt reperire profecto, Quamlibet immani projectu corporis exstet, Qui non sola novem dispersis jugera membris, Obtineat, sed qui terrai totius orbem: Non tamen æternum poterit perferre dolorem, Nec præbere cibum proprio de corpore semper; Sed Tityos nobis hic est; in amore jacentem Quem volucres lacerant, atque exest anxius angor; Aut aliâ quâvis scindunt cuppedine curæ. The crime of Tityus, was, that he attempted to ravish Latona; for which he was shot by Apollo.There too the mighty Tityus I beheld, Earth's mighty giant son, stretch'd o'er th'infernal field; He cover'd nine large acres as he lay, While with fierce screams a vultur tore away His liver for her food, and scoop'd the smoaking prey; Plung'd deep her bloody beak, nor plung'd in vain, For still the fruitful fibres spring again, Swell, and renew th'enormous monster's pain. She dwells for ever in his roomy breast, Nor gives the roaring fiend a moment's rest; But still th'immortal prey supplies th'immortal feast. Need I the Lapiths' horrid pains relate, Ver. 835. Ixion's torments, or Pirithous' fate— The crime of Ixion was, that he attempted to ravish Juno, and boasted that he had actually effected it. That of Pirothous the friend of Theseus, that he laid a design to carry off Proserpine out of hell. Dr. Trapp observes, that there is a wonderful elegance in the original in that— ? Jam jam lapsura, cadentique Imminet assimilis! ? By that syllable que which would be redundant were it not for the ellision by imminet, the first verse seems to be tumbling down upon the second, to express the thing described.Ixion's torments, or Perithoüs' fate? On high a tottering rocky fragment spreads, Projects in air, and trembles o'er their heads. Stretch'd on the couch, they see with longing eyes In regal pomp successive banquets rise, While lucid columns, glorious to behold, Support th'imperial canopies of gold. The queen of furies, a tremendous guest, Sits by their side, and guards the tempting feast, Which if they touch, her dreadful torch she rears, Flames in their eyes, and thunders in their ears. Ver. 846. They that on earth—Let those severe gentlemen, who think reading the poets an useless and trifling study, attentively consider the noble and just moral that is contained in this description of the criminals our poet hath here selected to be punished. Mr. Warburton observes, that this passage relates to the infringers of the duties of imperfect obligation, which civil laws cannot reach: such as, want of natural affection to brothers, duty to parents, protection to clients, and charity to the poor. He adds, next to these are placed, those pests of public and private peace, the traytor and the adulterer. It is observable, he does not say, simply, adulteri, but ob adulterium cæsi; as implying, that the greatest civil punishment makes no atonement for this crime at the bar of divine justice.They that on earth had low pursuits in view, Their brethren hated, or their parents flew, And, still more numerous, they who swell'd their store, But ne'er reliev'd their kindred or the poor: Or in a cause unrighteous fought and bled; Or perish'd in the foul adulterous bed; Or broke the ties of faith with base deceit; Imprison'd deep, their destin'd torments wait. But what their torments, seek not thou to know, Or the dire sentence of their endless woe. Some roll a stone, rebounding down the hill, Some hang suspended on the whirling wheel; There Theseus groans in pains that ne'er expire, Chain'd down for ever in a chair of fire. There Phlegyas feels unutterable woe, And roars incessant thro' the shades below; Be just, ye mortals! by these torments aw'd, These dreadful torments, not to scorn a god. This wretch his country to a tyrant sold, Ver. 865. And barter'd glorious liberty for gold—Servius says, that Curio is hinted at in these lines, and Mark Antony in the succeeding. And Donatus tells us, that Tully is pointed at by the incestuous criminal, next mentioned; Sallust adopts this calumny against Cicero, his violent enemy; of whom he says—Filia matris pellex. Servius rejects this opinion as a groundless slander.And barter'd glorious liberty for gold. Laws for a bribe he past, but past in vain, For those same laws a bribe repeal'd again. This wretch by hot preposterous lust was led, To climb and violate his daughter's bed. To some enormous crimes they all aspir'd; All feel the torments that those crimes requir'd! Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, A voice of brass, and adamantine lungs, Not half the mighty scene could I disclose, Repeat their crimes, or count their dreadful woes!— Thus spoke the priestess of the god of day; And, haste, she cry'd; to hell's great empress pay The destin'd present, and pursue thy way. For lo! the high Cyclopean walls are near, And in full view the massy gates appear. On these the gods enjoin thee to bestow The sacred offering of the golden bough. This said, they journey'd thro' the solemn gloom, And reach'd at length the proud imperial dome: With eager speed his course the heroe bore, With living streams his body sprinkled o'er, And fixt the glittering present on the door. These rites compleat, they reach the flowery plains, The verdant groves where endless pleasure reigns. Ver. 890. Here glowing Æther shoots— The whole description is so charming (says Dr. Trapp) that it is almost Elysium to read it. As the cursed inhabitants of the other regions are (as I observed) most judiciously specified, so are the blessed ones of this: Those who suffered in the service of their country; holy priests; pious poets; inventers of arts and sciences; in a word, all public-spirited persons and benefactors to mankind. The antients never failed more in any thing (says Mr. Spence,) than in making a heaven; and if one was to consider all the modern descriptions of the same, we should find most of them perhaps little better than the antient ones. They had scarce any thing in the old philosophy, that held firmly against the fears of death; and therefore the notions which the Romans had even of a place of bliss, had something gloomy intermixed with it. Tho' the ideas of Virgil are much preferable to those of Homer on this subject; they are still low and mean enough o'conscience. Polymetis, p. 281.Here glowing Æther shoots a purple ray, And o'er the region pours a double day. From sky to sky th'unweary'd splendor runs, And nobler planets roll round brighter suns. Some wrestle on the sands; and some, in play And games heroic, pass the hours away. Those raise the song divine, and these advance In measur'd steps to form the solemn dance. There Orpheus, graceful in his long attire, In seven divisions strikes the sounding lyre; Across the chords the quivering quill he flings, Or with his flying fingers sweeps the strings. Here Teucer's antient race the prince surveys, The race of heroes born in happier days: Ilus, Assaracus in arms rever'd, And Troy's great founder Dardanus appear'd; Before him stalk'd the tall majestic train, And pitch'd their idle lances on the plain. Their arms and airy chariots he beheld; The steeds unharness'd graz'd the flowery field. Those pleasing cares the heroes felt, alive, For chariots, steeds, and arms, in death survive. Some on the verdant plains were stretch'd along; Sweet to the ear their tuneful Pæans rung: Others beneath a laurel grove were laid, And joyful feasted in the fragrant shade. Here, glittering thro' the trees, his eyes survey The streams of Po descending from the day. Here a blest train advance along the meads, And snowy wreaths adorn their graceful heads: Patriots who perish'd for their country's right, Or nobly triumph'd in the field of fight: There, holy priests, and sacred poets stood, Who sung with all the raptures of a god: Worthies, who life by useful arts refin'd, With those, who leave a deathless name behind, Friends of the world, and fathers of mankind! This shining band the priestess thus addrest, Ver. 928. But chief Musæus—The excellent M. Segrais makes a most judicious remark on this passage, which deserves to be set down at length. Some commentators, says he, ask why Virgil does Musæus the honour to place him in the Elysian fields, and to address the Sybil's words to him, rather than to Homer. I once saw a company of very learned men, almost unanimously agree, that Virgil ought indeed to have bestowed this honour upon Homer, but that his jealousy of him prevented it. I did not at that time reflect on it, and yet nothing is more ridiculous than this, and the answer to this objection is obvious: which is, that Virgil would have been guilty of a horrible fault in giving this commission to Homer in Æneas's life-time, since he was not born till a long time after. Wherefore, to answer the Sybil, this wise poet has chosen Musæus, who being Orpheus's disciple, was much ancienter than Homer; for he lived about the time of the Trojan war itself. It is scarce credible, that Scaliger the father should be so much mistaken as he is, when he takes Musæus, the author of the small poem of Leander and Hero, who, as many learned men believe, was later than Virgil himself, for this antient Musæus; and that he should alledge, to shew how much this poet was superiour to Homer, that it was for that reason that Virgil preferred him to Homer in the honour which he did him in the Elysian fields, without ever thinking how impertinent it would have been to place Homer in hell before the death of Æneas, Ulysses, and so many heroes whose adventures and exploits he sung. If Homer had lived during the Trojan war, he had never chosen it for the subject of his poem, and he must have dispatched his Iliad and Odyssey very hastily in seven years, in order to be ready to hold this dialogue with the Sybil; but 'tis plainly proved that he did not live till long after; and as no reason obliged Virgil to be guilty of this error in chronology, and it being impossible for him to be ignorant of it, he therefore avoided such a gross fault; which would be in a word, to make Homer die, before he was born. I believe on the contrary, that if he could handsomely have mentioned him, he would very willingly have done him that honour, nothing appearing in his character, unworthy of a most generous mind.But chief Musæus, tow'ring o'er the rest; So high the poet's lofty stature spreads Above the train, and overtops their heads! Say, happy souls! and thou, blest poet, say, Where dwells Anchises, and direct our way? For him we took the dire infernal road, And stem'd huge Acheron's tremendous flood. To whom the bard—unsettled we remove, As pleasure calls from verdant grove to grove; Stretch'd on the flowery meads, at ease we lie, And hear the silver rills run bubbling by. Come then, ascend this point, and hence survey By yon descent an open easy way. He spoke, then stalk'd before; and from the brow Points out the fair enamell'd fields below. They leave the proud aërial height again, And pleas'd bend downward to the blissful plain. Anchises there, the heroe's sire divine, Deep in the vale had rang'd his glorious line; Rank behind rank, his joyful eyes survey The chiefs in bright succession rise to day. He counts th'illustrious race with studious cares, Their deeds, their fates, their victories and wars, Soon as his lov'd Æneas he beheld, His dear, dear son, advancing o'er the field; Ver. 953. Eager he stretch'd—Our expectation had been long raised, and one longed most eagerly for the interview betwixt Æneas and his father; and now when it really happens, what can be imagined more interesting? Nothing can be more artful and judicious, than the manner in which the poet introduces Æneas to take a review of his posterity.Eager he stretch'd his longing arms, and shed A stream of tears, and thus with transport said: Then has thy long-try'd pious love surpast The dreadful road, to meet thy sire at last? Oh! is it given to see, nor see alone, But hear, and answer to my godlike son? This I presag'd, indeed, as late I ran O'er times and seasons; nor presag'd in vain. From what strange lands, what stormy seas and skies Returns my son, to bless my longing eyes? How did my anxious mind your danger move, Ver. 964. In Carthage—There is a great art in making Anchises anxious for his son, while he was detained at Carthage. It reminds the reader of that important episode. The expression, Libyæ tibi regna nocerent, seems to hint at the ancient enmity betwixt Rome and Carthage.Then, when in Carthage you indulg'd your love! Your shade, the prince replies, your angry shade, In many a frightful vision I survey'd. By your behest I came to these abodes; My fleet lies anchor'd in the Tuscan floods: Give me, O father! give thy hand, nor shun The dear embraces of a duteous son. While yet he spoke, the tender sorrows rise, And the big drops run trickling from his eyes. Thrice round his neck his eager arms he threw; Thrice from his empty arms the phantom flew, Swift as the wind, with momentary flight, Swift as a fleeting vision of the night. Meantime the heroe saw, with wondering eyes, Deep in a vale a waving forest rise: Thro' those sequester'd scenes slow Lethe glides, And in low murmurs lulls her slumbering tides: Unnumber'd ghosts around the waters throng, And o'er the brink the airy nations hung. So to the meads in glowing summer pour The clustering bees, and rifle every flow'r: O'er the sweet lillies hang the busy swarms; The fields remurmur to the deep alarms. Struck with the sight, the prince astonish'd stood; Oh! say, why throng such numbers to the flood? Or what the nature of the wondrous tide, And who the crowds?—to whom the sire reply'd: To all those souls who round the river wait, Ver. 992. New mortal bodies—Alluding to the Pythagorean doctrine, of the transmigration of the soul, from one body to another; which notion is finely ridiculed in that dialogue of Lucian, entitled the cock; which is, perhaps, the most humorous piece of that author.New mortal bodies are decreed by fate. To yon' dark streams the gliding ghosts repair, And quaff deep draughts of long oblivion there. How have I wish'd before thee to display These my descendants, ere they rise to day! Thus shalt thou Latium find with double joy, Since fate has fixt th'eternal throne of Troy.— O father! say, can heavenly souls repair Once more to earth, and breathe the vital air? Ver. 1001. Can they covet their corporeal chain?—This may shew that Virgil had nobler thoughts of life and death than Homer; as Lucan had nobler than either of them. Spence.What!—can they covet their corporeal chain? Gods!—can the wretches long for life again!— Attend, he cry'd, while I unfold the whole, And clear these wonders that amaze thy soul. Then the great sire the scheme before him lays, And thus each awful secret he displays: Ver. 1007. Know first, a spirit— In these sublime and exalted verses, Virgil follows the refined sentiments of Plato, concerning the anima mundi, or soul of the world, pervading and vivifying, all created things. To illustrate this opinion, I shall transcribe a passage of the excellent Bishop Berkley, to whom one may with justice apply what he himself finely says of Plato, viz. ‘That he hath joined with an imagination the most splendid and magnificent, an intellect not less deep and clear. ‘Both Stoics and Platonics held the world to be alive, tho' sometimes it be mentioned as an antient animal, sometimes as a plant or vegetable. But in this, notwithstanding what hath been surmised by some learned men, there seems to be no atheism. For so long as the world is supposed to be quickened by elementary fire or spirit, which is itself animated by soul, and directed by understanding, it follows that all parts thereof originally depend upon, and may be reduced unto, the same indivisible stem or principle, to wit, a supreme mind; which is the concurrent doctrine of Pythagoræans, Platonics, and Stoics. There is, according to these philosophers, a life infused throughout all things. The ??? ??????, ??? ???????? an intellectual and artificial fire, an inward principle, animal spirit, or natural life, producing and forming within as art doth without; regulating, moderating, and reconciling the various motions, qualities, and parts of this mundane system. By virtue of this life, the great masses are held together in their orderly courses, as well as the minutest particles governed in their natural motions, according to the several laws of attraction, gravity, electricity, magnetism, and the rest. It is this gives instincts, teaches the spider her web, and the bee her honey. This it is that directs the roots of plants to draw forth juices from the earth, and the leaves and cortical vessels to separate and attract such particles of air and elementary fire, as suit their respective natures. Nature seems to be not otherwise distinguished from the anima mundi, than as life is from soul; and upon the principles of the oldest philosophers, may not improperly or incongruously be styled the life of the world.—Alcinous, in his tract of the doctrine of Plato, saith, that God hath given the world both mind and soul: others include both in the word soul, and suppose the soul of the world to be God. Philo appears to be of this opinion, in several parts of his writings. And Virgil, who was no stranger to the Pythagoræan and Platonic tenets, writes to the same purpose: ? ‘Deum namque ire per omnes ‘Terrasque tractusque maris, cælumque profundum. &amp;c. Thus much the schools of Pythagoras and Plato seem agreed in, to wit, that the soul of the world, whether having a distinct mind of its own, or directed by a superiour mind, doth embrace all its parts, connect them by an invisible and indissoluble chain, and preserve them ever well adjusted and in good order.’ Berkley's Siris, p. 133.Know first, a spirit, with an active flame, Fills, feeds and animates the mighty frame; Runs thro' the watry worlds, the fields of air, The pond'rous earth, the depths of heav'n; and there Glows in the sun and moon, and burns in every star. Thus, mingling with the mass, the general soul Lives in the parts, and agitates the whole. From that celestial energy began The low-brow'd brute; th'imperial race of man; The painted birds who wing th'aërial plain, And all the mighty monsters of the main. Their souls at first from high Olympus came; And, if not blunted by the mortal frame, Th'etherial fires would ever burn the same! But while on earth; by earth-born passions tost, The heavenly spirits lie extinct and lost; Nor steal one glance, before their bodies die, From those dark dungeons to their native sky. Ev'n when those bodies are to death resign'd, Some old inherent spots are left behind; A sullying tincture of corporeal stains Deep in the substance of the soul remains. Ver. 1029. Thus are her splendors dimm'd and crusted o'er— Nothing can be more refined and spiritualized, than the doctrine of Plato (which our poet here pursues) concerning the baseness of indulging sensual pleasures, and of the filth, the stains, and the corruption with which they gradually taint and infect the soul. Milton has beautifully adorned these sentiments in his Comus: The reader of taste will thank me for inserting the passage, though it be pretty long. ? When lust By unchaste looks, loose gestures, and foul talk, But most by lewd and lavish act of sin, Lets in defilement to the inward parts, The soul grows clotted by contagion, Imbodies and imbrutes, till she quite lose The divine property of her first being. Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp, Oft seen in charnel vaults, and sepulchres, Lingring and sitting by a new-made grave; As loth to leave the body that it lov'd; And linkt itself by carnal sensuality, To a degenerate and degraded state. I cannot forbear observing, that this fine circumstance of the ghosts wandering near vaults, &amp;c. is literally translated from Plato.Thus are her splendors dimm'd, and crusted o'er With those dark vices, that she knew before. For this the souls a various penance pay, To purge the taint of former crimes away: Some in the sweeping breezes are refin'd, And hung on high to whiten in the wind: Some cleanse their stains beneath the gushing streams, And some rise glorious from the searching flames. Thus all must suffer; and, those sufferings past, The clouded minds are purify'd at last. But when the circling seasons as they roll, Have cleans'd the dross long-gather'd round the soul; When the celestial fire divinely bright, Breaks forth victorious in her native light; Then we, the chosen few, Elysium gain, And here expatiate on the blissful plain. But those thin airy throngs thy eyes behold, When o'er their heads a thousand years have roll'd, In mighty crowds to yon' Lethæan flood Swarm at the potent summons of the god; There the deep draught of dark oblivion drain; Then they desire new bodies to obtain, And visit heav'ns etherial realms again. This said, the sire conducts their steps along Thro' the loud tumult of th'aërial throng; Then climb'd a point, and every face descry'd, As the huge train prest forward to the tide: Ver. 1056. New hear.—Prophesies are oracular, and therefore short; and those especially ought to be so, which are predictions of things already past. An indifferent writer (as some moderns upon the same occasion have actually done) wou'd have launched out into long descriptions, and given us the history at large. But this is not to imitate Virgil: He gives us only short hints in a divine enthusiasm; and even those not in the real order of time, as things actually happened: It was not his business to be an exact chronologer: This would have been extremely flat, and dull; and the reader would have known before-hand what he was going to say: But now he is agreeably disappointed and surprized. Anchises has a prospect at once of all the ghosts standing before him; and they are not supposed to be ranged in order according to their future succession. Yet he does not entirely neglect chronology; so as to name Romulus first, then Camillus, then Numitor, then Augustus, and then Numa. Segrais.Now hear, while I display our race divine, And the long glories of our Dardan line, The noble Roman heroes, who shall rise From Trojan blood, successive, to the skies. This mighty scene of wonders I relate, And open all thy glorious future fate. First then behold yon' blooming youth appear, That heroe leaning on his shining spear! This thy last son, thy hoary age shall grace, Thy first brave offspring of the Latian race; From fair Lavinia in the groves he springs, A king, and father of a race of kings; Sylvius his name; proud Alba shall he sway, And to his sons th'imperial pow'r convey. See! where the youth, already wing'd to rise, Stands on the verge of life, and claims the skies. Procas the next behold, a chief divine, Procas the glory of the Trojan line; Capys and Numitor there pant for fame; There a new Sylvius Æneas. Sylvius bears thy mighty name; Like thee, just, great and good, for valour known, The chief shall mount th'imperial Alban throne. What strength each youth displays? but who are those With Civic crowns around their manly brows? By those shall Gabii and Nomentum rise, And proud Collatian tow'rs invade the skies. Then Faunus' town with turrets shall be crown'd, And fair Fidena stretch her ramparts round. Then Bola too shall rise, of mighty same; Unpeopled now they lie, and lands without a name! Bright Ilia, sprung from Trojan blood, shall bear Yon' glorious heroe to the god of war: Behold great Romulus, her victor son; Whose sword restores his grandsire to the throne. Lo! from his helmet what a glory plays! And Jove's own splendors round his temples blaze. From this brave prince, majestic Rome shall rise; The boundless earth, her empire shall comprize; Her fame and valour tow'r above the skies! Seven ample hills th'imperial city grace, Who nobly glories in her martial race; Proud of her sons, she lifts her head on high; Proud, as the mighty mother of the sky; When thro' the Phrygian towns, sublime in air, She rides triumphant in her golden car, Crown'd with a nodding diadem of tow'rs; And counts her offspring, the celestial pow'rs, A shining train, who fill the blest abode, A hundred sons, and ev'ry son a god! Ver. 1105. See here thy race divine—Here is a particular beauty, which I do not know that any one has taken notice of. The list which Virgil has here drawn up, was in general to do honour to the Roman name, but more particularly to compliment Augustus. For this reason Anchises, who shews Æneas most of the rest of his descendants in the same order that they were to make their appearance in the world, breaks his method for the sake of Augustus, whom he singles out immediately after having mentioned Romulus, as the most illustrious person who was to rise in that empire, which the other had founded. He was impatient to describe his posterity, raised to the utmost pitch of glory; and therefore passes over all the rest to come at this great man, whom by this means he implicitly represents as making the most conspicuous figure among them. By this artifice the poet did not only give his emperor the greatest praise he could bestow upon him; but hinder'd his reader from drawing a parallel, which would have been disadvantageous to him, had he been celebrated in his proper place; that is, after Pompey and Cæsar, who each of them eclips'd Augustus in military glory. Though there have been finer things said of this emperor than of any other man, all the wits of his age having tried to out-rival one another on that subject, he never received a compliment which can be compared, for sublimity of thought, to that which the poet here makes him. Guardian, N?. 138.Turn, turn thine eyes! see here thy race divine, Behold thy own imperial Roman line: Cæsar, with all the Julian name survey; See where the glorious ranks ascend to-day!— This—this is he!—the chief so long foretold To bless the land where Saturn rul'd of old, And give the Latian realms a second age of gold! The promis'd prince, Augustus the divine, Of Cæsar's race, and Jove's immortal line! This mighty chief his empire shall extend O'er Indian realms, to earth's remotest end. The hero's rapid victories out-run The year's whole course, the stars, and journeys of the sun! Where, high in air, huge Atlas' shoulders rise, Support th'etherial lights, and prop the rolling skies! Ver. 1120. Proclaim'd by every god—The original says, Hujus in adventum, jam nunc &amp; Caspia regna, Responsis horrent divûm; ? Catrou makes the following remark: It appears that Virgil alludes, in this passage, to a certain oracle or prediction, which a little before the time of Augustus's birth had spread itself over the universe. It was, that there would soon be born a person, who should be master of the whole world. Suetonius, who borrowed his account from Julius Marathus, relates it in the following manner: Author est Julius Marathus, ante paucos quam nasceretur Augustus, menses, prodigium Romæ factum publicè quo enunciabatur regem naturam parturire. This oracle, spread over the face of the whole earth, might indeed relate to Jesus Christ, whose birth was near that time. The people applied it to Augustus, as the predictions of the Cumæan Sybil, which related to the Messiah, were interpreted by Virgil in favour of, and by way of compliment to, the young Marcellus.He comes!—he comes!—proclaim'd by every god! Nile hears the shout, and shakes in every flood. Proud Asia flies before his dire alarms, And distant nations tremble at his arms. So many realms not great Alcides past, Not, when the brazen-footed hind he chas'd, O'er Erymanthus' steeps the boar pursu'd; Or drew the huge Lernæan monster's blood. Nor Bacchus such a length of regions knew, When on his car the god in triumph flew, And shook the reins, and urg'd the fiery wheels, Whirl'd by swift tygers down the Indian hills.— And doubt we yet, by virtuous deeds to rise, When fame, when empire is the certain prize? Rise, rise, my son; thy Latian foes o'ercome! Rise, the great founder of majestic Rome! But who that Numa Pompilius. chief, who crown'd with olive stands, And holds the sacred relicks in his hands? I know the pious Roman king from far, The silver beard, and venerable hair; Call'd from his little barren field away, To pomp of empire and the regal sway. Tullus the next succeeds, whose loud alarms Shall rouze the slumb'ring sons of Rome to arms. Inspir'd by him, the soft unwarlike train Repeat their former triumphs o'er again, Lo Ancus there!—the giddy crowd he draws, And swells too much with popular applause. Now wou'dst thou Tarquin's haughty race behold, Or fierce avenging Brutus, brave and bold? See the stern chief stalk awful o'er the plain, The glorious chief, who breaks the tyrant's chain! He to his ax shall proud rebellion doom, The first great consul of his rescu'd Rome! Ver. 1154. His sons (who arm, the Tarquins to maintain— What I have often thought of (says Mr. Spence, on Pope's Odyssey) as the finest subject either for poetry or painting, is the first Brutus on the judicial seat; just before the act of giving sentence on his own sons, for their treachery to the commonwealth. What a noble strife was there between natural affection, and the love of one's country? between duty and desire, between common humanity and the spirit (perhaps the pride) of a Roman? What a fine group of figures would the suppliants for the criminals compose in such a piece? On one side of the tribunal, the wife of the judge and mother of the offenders; and all the relations divided in the same manner, between a desire of moving pity, and an abhorrence of the very crime, for the pardon of which they would intercede: The people of Rome, on the other side, with looks full of mixt passions; some struck with pity amidst all their severity, some almost condemning, and yet approving at the same time, the rigid justice of the father; while others commiserate the youth of the sons, and seem incens'd at the unnatural impartiality of the judge. Evening the second, page 85. This subject has been very well executed since by Dr. Wall, of Worcester.His sons (who arm, the Tarquins to maintain, And fix oppression in the throne again,) He nobly yields to justice, in the cause Of sacred freedom and insulted laws. Tho' harsh th'unhappy father may appear, The judge compels the sire to be severe; And the fair hopes of fame the patriot move, To sink the private in the public love. Like him, Torquatus, for stern justice known, Dooms to the ax his brave victorious son. Ver. 1164. Behold the Drust—There were two of this name, who signalized themselves at Rome. The first defeated Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal. The second was the son of Livia, the wife of Augustus, and made war very successfully in Germany. The two Decii, the father and the son, devoted themselves one after another to die for their country; the one in the war against the Gauls, the other in the war against the Samnites. Camillus was five times Dictator, and triumph'd four times, over the Volsci, the Veii, over the Gauls (at which time he delivered Rome) and again over the same people in his old age, in the year of Rome 387. The next lines relate to Julius Cæsar, and Pompey.Behold the Drusi prodigal of blood! The Decii dying for their country's good! Behold Camillus there; that chief shall come With four proud triumphs to imperial Rome. Lo! in bright arms two spirits rise to sight! How strict their friendship in the realms of night! How fierce their discord when they spring to light! How furious in the field will both appear! With what dire slaughter! what a waste of war! Impetuous to the sight the father pours From the steep Alps, and tall Ligurian tow'rs. The son, with servile monarchs in his train, Leads the whole Eastern world, and spreads the plain. Oh! check your wrath, my sons; the nations spare; And save your country from the woes of war; Nor in her sacred breast, with rage abhorr'd, So fiercely plunge her own victorious sword! And thou, be thou the first; thy arms resign, Thou, my great son of Jove's celestial line!— Lucius Mummius.Yon' chief shall vanquish all the Grecian pow'rs, And lay in dust the proud Corinthian tow'rs, Drive to the capitol his gilded car, And grace the triumph with the spoils of war. T. Quinctius Flaminius.That chief shall stretch fair Argos on the plain, And the proud seat of Agamemnon's reign, O'ercome Philip, king of Macedon. th'Æacian king, of race divine, Sprung from the great Achilles' glorious line; Avenge Minerva's violated fane, And the great spirits of thy fathers slain. What tongue, just M. Portius Cato the censor. Cato, can thy praise forbear? Ver. 1194. Or each brave Scipio's— Virgil had Lucretitius's expression in his eye, who calls Scipio Africanus, Scipiades, belli fulmen. This great general put an end to the third Punic war, by utterly destroying Carthage.Or each brave Scipio's noble deeds declare, Africk's dread foes; two thunderbolts of war! Ver. 1196. Fabricius' worth repeat—Fabricius could not be corrupted by the Samnites, nor by Pyrrhus; and being offered a large bribe, answered, Romam aurum non habere, sed habentibus aurum imperare.Who can the bold Fabricius' worth repeat, In pride of poverty, divinely great; Call'd by his bleeding Country's voice, to come From the rude plow, and rule imperial Rome! Tir'd as I am the glorious roll to trace, Where am I snatch'd by the long Fabian race! See where the Q. Fabius Maximus. patriot shines, whose prudent care Ver. 1203. Preserves his country—The line in the original, Unus qui nobis, &amp;c. is taken from the annals of old Ennius, and was grown almost proverbial at Rome.Preserves his country by protracted war!— The subject nations, with a happier grace, Ver. 1205. From the rude stone may call the mimic face— The Grecians undoubtedly far excelled the Romans in statuary, painting, poetry and indeed in all the fine arts. The best judges likewise allow, that the eloquence of Demosthenes is superior to Tully's. But the secret reason why Virgil seems to give the superiority of eloquence to the Greeks, might perhaps be, that Tully was very odious to his patron, and his shadow'd hero Augustus. And how greatly the Greeks excelled the Romans in all parts of philosophy, and the reasons of such excellence, may be seen in the noble conclusion of Mr. Harris's late treatise, intitled Hermes.From the rude stone may call the mimic face, Or with new life inform the breathing brass: Shine at the bar, describe the stars on high, The motions, laws, and regions of the sky: Be this your nobler praise, in times to come, Ver. 1210. These your imperial arts—The Romans do not stick at owning, that the Greeks exceeded them in all the polite arts, and in every branch of literature. This passage is a remarkable proof of it, and one might load several pages with others, from Horace and Cicero. The Roman arts were the arts of war and government—Ego Romanis artibus, virtute, operâ, armis vincam: says Camillus to the schoolmaster of Falisci (Liv. l. 5. §. 27.)—Ut virtutis a nostris, sic doctrinæ sunt ab illis exempla repetenda. (Cic. de Orat. l. 3. §. 137.) Spence.These your imperial arts, ye sons of Rome! O'er distant realms to stretch your awful sway, To bid those nations tremble and obey; To crush the proud, the suppliant foe to rear, To give mankind a peace, or shake the world with war!— Ver. 1215. He said—a while their ravish'd eyes—Let us here admire an artful stroke of the poet: he makes Anchises stop in his narration, before he begins his account and character of Marcellus; this awakens the reader's attention, and makes the person he is going to speak of, of more dignity and importance.He said—awhile their ravish'd eyes admire The wondrous scenes:—when thus proceeds the sire: See! where Marcellus tow'rs above the train, And bears the regal trophies from the plain. Endanger'd Rome shall bless his guardian care, And stand unshaken in a storm of war. Carthage and Gaul the hero's might shall prove, The third who hangs th'imperial spoils to Jove.— With him the Trojan prince a youth beheld In shining arms advancing o'er the field; A beauteous form; but clouds his front surround, And his dim eyes were fixt upon the ground. Say, who that youth (he cries) o'ercast with grief; The youth who follows that victorious chief? His son? or one of his illustrious line? What numbers shout around the form divine? His port how noble! how august his fame! How like the former! and how near the same! But gloomy shades his pensive brows o'erspread, And a dark cloud involves his beauteous head. Seek not, my son, replies the sire, to know (And, as he spoke, the gushing sorrows flow,) What woes the gods to thy descendants doom, What endless grief to every son of Rome! This youth on earth the fates but just display, And soon, too soon, they snatch the gift away! Had Rome for ever held the glorious prize, Her bliss had rais'd the envy of the skies! Ver. 1243. Oh! from the martial—Part of the sepulchre in which the ashes of Marcellus were deposited, (and which was built by Augustus for Julius Cæsar himself, and the rest of his family) is still remaining. It stands in the Campus Martius, near the banks of the Tiber; and, when one sees it, puts one strongly in mind of the verses in Virgil, where he speaks of the funeral of that young prince. 'Tis what they now call the Mausolæum Augusti. Spence.Oh! from the martial field what cries shall come! What groans shall echo thro' the streets of Rome! How shall old Tyber, from his oozy bed, In that sad moment rear his reverend head, The length'ning pomp and funeral to survey, Ver. 1248. When by the mighty tomb— Here is an exquisite beauty in the original, which the translator has happily imitated: ? Cum tumulum præterlabere recentem. The word præterlabere has the most slow, melancholy air imaginable.When by the mighty tomb he takes his mournful way! A youth of nobler hopes shall never rise, Nor glad like him the Latian fathers eyes: And Rome, proud Rome shall boast, she never bore, From age to age, so brave a son before! Honour and fame, alas! and antient truth Revive and die with that illustrious youth! In vain embattled troops his arms oppose: In every field he tames his country's foes, Whether on foot he marches in his might, Or spurs his fiery courser to the fight. Poor pitied youth! the glory of the state! Oh! cou'dst thou shun the dreadful stroke of fate, Rome should in thee behold, with ravish'd eyes, Ver. 1262. Her pride, her darling, her Marcellus rise!— At hearing these beautiful lines on the death of her son, Octavia, to whom Virgil was reading them, fainted away. The poet most judiciously and artfully suppressed the name of Marcellus to the last. When he uttered it, it was so unexpected a stroke, that the princess could bear it no more. When she recovered a little, she ordered the poet should receive ten sesterces for every verse relating to Marcellus, that is, about fourscore pounds of our English coin. Donatus tells us, that Virgil read his verses with great sweetness, propriety, and grace; Pronuntiabat maximâ cum suavitate, &amp; lenociniis miris. Few poets are blessed with this talent. When an author (says Mr. Bayle) reads his play to the actors, to whom he is about to sell it, woe be to him, if he doth not read it well. It is impossible to do a greater service to a piece of poetry, than to read it well: it removes several faults; and no poem is so good, but an ill reader may spoil it. Virgil was therefore very happy, having the talent both of making charming verses, and of reading them well. Mr. Corneille resembled him but in one of these excellencies.Her pride, her darling, her Marcellus rise! Bring fragrant flow'rs, the whitest lillies bring, With all the purple beauties of the spring; These gifts at least, these honours I'll bestow On the dear youth, to please his shade below— Thus, while the wondrous scenes employ their sight, They rove with pleasure in the fields of light. When the great sire had taught his son the whole, And with the Roman glories fir'd his soul; Next to the list'ning heroe he declares His toils in Latium, and successive wars; Gives him their nations and their towns to know, And how to shun, or suffer every woe. Two gates the silent courts of sleep adorn, That of pale ivory, this of lucid horn. Thro' this, true visions take their airy way, Thro' that, false phantoms mount the realms of day. Then to the ivory gate he led them on, And there dismist the Sibyl and his son. Now the great chief, returning, to the main, Reviews his fleet, and glads his friends again. Then, steering by the strand, he plows the sea, And to Caïeta's port directs his way: There all the fleet the crooked anchors moor; And the tall ships stood rang'd along the shore. The End of the Sixth Book. BOOK the Seventh. A new scene of action here presents itself to our great poet. In the six first books he has imitated the Odyssey; in the six last he proposes the Iliad for his pattern. He himself gives us notice by the invocation toward the beginning of this seventh book, that he took this part to be more important than the first; his words are, Majus opus moveo. ? Notwithstanding which, by a kind of destiny common to most works, these six last books are not so much esteemed as the first six, and much less read. But, upon a close examination, and upon a general survey of the whole, I cannot discover the reason of this. It is certain, that as the poet had revised them less frequently than the first, their versification is not so perfect. But as to their disposition, their fictions, &amp;c. they are certainly not inferior to the first. This seventh book upon the whole contains as many pleasing circumstances as are to be found in any other: We have in every part of it the marvellous, and it is filled with so great a variety of events, that there are few books where the story is more engaging. Its principal part is the review or catalogue of the forces, and it is easily perceived that the poet has here raised and exerted himself. Segrais. The ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Æneas, and promises him his only daughter Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, who is in love with her, being favoured by her mother, and stirred up by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made; and engages in his quarrel, Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces and the names of their commanders are particularly related. Ver. 1. You too Cajeta—On the shore of the Tyrrhene sea, the borders of Latium; being that part of the Neapolitan territories, which is called Terra di Cavoro, and now Cajeta, Gaeta, a city, with a bay and promontory of the same name. Some, with Virgil, derive the name from Æneas's nurse. Strabo deduces it from the Lacedæmonian tongue, which terms all crooked things [littora curva] ???????. Ruæus. You too, Cajeta, whose indulgent cares Nurst the great chief, and form'd his tender years, Expiring here (an ever-honour'd name!) Adorn Hesperia with immortal fame: Thy name survives to please thy pensive ghost; Thy sacred relicks grace the Latian coast. Soon as her funeral rites the prince had paid, And rais'd a tomb in honour of the dead; (The sea subsiding, and the tempests o'er,) He spreads the flying sails, and leaves the shore. When, at the close of night, soft breezes rise, The moon in milder glory mounts the skies: Safe in her friendly light the navy glides; The silver splendors trembling o'er the tides. Now by rich Circe's coast they bend their way, (Circe, fair daughter of the god of day;) A dangerous shore: the echoing forests rung, While at the loom the beauteous goddess sung: Bright cedar brands supply her father's rays, Perfume the dome, and round the palace blaze. Ver. 21. Here wolves, &amp;c.— This whole description is borrowed from Homer, Odyss. 10. and, as Scaliger observes, highly improved. It must, says Mr. Pope, be confessed, that Iræ leonum, vincla recusantum, and the epithets and short descriptions applied to the nature of each savage, are beautiful additions. Virgil likewise differs from Homer, in the manner of the description: Homer draws the beasts with a gentleness of nature; Virgil paints them with the fierceness of savages. The reason of Homer's conduct is, because they still retained the sentiments of men, in the form of beasts, and consequently their native tenderness. To this remark I shall subjoin, that Virgil heightens the allegory, by representing these lovers of sensual pleasure, not only disguised in the shape of beasts, but endued likewise with their savage dispositions. Not to mention, that the hearing their roarings at a distance, a circumstance not found in Homer, is very affecting to the imagination. Milton, in his exquisite drama, Comus, had an eye to this passage: ? Whence night by night He, and his monstrous rout are heard to howl Like stabled wolves, or tygers at their prey, Doing abhorred rites to Hecate, In their obscured haunts of inmost bowers. And Spencer, Fairy Queen, B. 2. C. 12. Ere long they heard an hideous bellowing Of many beasts, that roar'd outrageously. I refer the reader to the whole canto, in which Spencer has made a fine use of this allegory.Here wolves with howlings scare the naval train, And lions roar reluctant to the chain. Here growling bears and swine their ears affright, And break the solemn silence of the night. These once were men; but Circe's charms confine, In brutal shapes, the human forms divine. But Neptune, to secure the pious host From these dire monsters, this inchanted coast, A friendly breeze to every sail supplies; And o'er the deeps the rapid navy flies. Now on her car was gay Aurora borne, And ocean reddens with the rising morn; The winds lie hush'd; the swelling surge subsides; And with their bending oars they labour thro' the tides. Ver. 35. From hence the heroe— Segrais observes in his preface, that Virgil designedly introduces this vernal description, as a hint that the action of the Æneid is included in one year. He makes the Trojan fleet enter the mouth of the Tyber in the spring. But this, I believe, is a refinement. Virgil, that the Tyber and its banks might appear as agreeable as possible, represents them under the influence of the sweetest of seasons. Thus it is a mere description without any reference to the main action. Mr. Addison, for the sake of amusing us with a beautiful image, has made the tragedy of Cato (which otherwise would have taken up no longer time than that of the representation) take up one whole day. He begins, The dawn is overcast, the morning low'rs, &amp;c. The action begins in the morning; but for the sake of introducing the image of the setting sun playing on the glittering arms, &amp;c. of Cæsar's approaching army, we must suppose it carried on to the evening. Scene 4. Act 5. Juba. Lucius, the horsemen are returned from viewing The number, strength and posture of our foes. Who now encamp within a short hour's march; On the high point of yon bright western tow'r We ken them from afar: the setting sun Plays on their shining arms and burning helmets, And covers all the field with gleams of fire. That single epithet setting applied to the sun, hinders the play from boasting a perfection, which is almost constantly to be found in Sophocles and Euripides, I mean that of the time being equal to the representation.From hence the heroe view'd a range of woods; Thro' the dark scene roll Tyber's glittering floods; With circling whirlpools urge their winding way, And lead their yellow waters to the sea. The painted birds, that haunt the golden tide And flutter round the banks on every side, Along the groves in pleasing triumph play, And with soft music hail the dawning day. Smooth o'er the shaded floods, at his command, The painted gallies glide, and reach the land. Now, goddess! aid thy poet, while he sings The state of Latium, and her ancient kings; Her dark confusions from their birth explores, When first the Trojans reach'd th'Hesperian shores. Ver. 49. Thou, thou, great Erato!— Ruæus and some others observe, that Virgil invokes the muse Erato, who presided over love affairs, because the transactions in this last part of the Æneid, turn upon the contentions betwixt Turnus and Æneas, for the fair Lavinia. This observation may at first sight appear too refined: But that Virgil here invokes Erato, as the muse presiding over love-affairs, is evident; for Nunc age qui reges Erato, &amp;c. is a transcript of that of Apollonius. ??? ??? ??? ????? ????? ??????, &amp;c. This is the initial verse of the book, where the amour commences between Medea and Jason. Apollonius afterwards gives a reason, why he particularly invoked Erato, ? ?? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????, ?? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ???????. Thy songs the rites of Cyprian bliss proclaim, Thy soothing numbers melt the frozen dame, And hence with love is stampt thy fav'rite name. Book 3.Thou, thou, great Erato! my soul inspire, To sing each furious fight with equal fire. A mightier work, a nobler scene appears; A long, long series of destructive wars! Kings against kings engag'd in dire alarms! And all Hesperia rouz'd to all the rage of arms! Latinus o'er the realm the sway maintain'd; And long in peace the hoary prince had reign'd; From Faunus and a fair Laurentian dame, A lovely nymph, the mighty monarch came. From Picus, Faunus drew his birth divine; From Saturn he, great author of the line. Fate from this king had snatch'd each blooming son; And one bright daughter heir'd th'imperial throne. Fir'd by her matchless charms, the youths repair From all the realms around, to court the fair; Bold Turnus too the royal maid addrest, Whose birth and beauty far surpast the rest. The Latian queen, to gain so brave a son, Had made the blooming heroe's cause her own. Vain was her aim, for every power divine Withstood the match, with many a dreadful sign. Amid the court a laurel rose in air, Preserv'd for ages with religious care; This venerable plant Latinus found, When first his town with rising tow'rs he crown'd; (Which thence deriv'd her name, as records say;) Then made it sacred to the god of day. It chanc'd, a cloud of bees in gathering swarms Swept thro' the skies, with murmuring hoarse alarms; Pour'd in, and (settling on the topmost bough,) Stretch'd down, dependent deep in air below: In one black length'ning chain together clung, Feet clasp'd in feet, the clustering nations hung. On this exclaims an augur—I explore A foreign consort from a distant shore; From yon' same point a stranger host shall come; And here their prince shall reign in this imperial dome. Yet more; while chaste Lavinia, at the shrine, Burns od'rous incense to the powers divine; As by her father stood the royal fair, The fires flew round, and caught her waving hair: O'er all her rich embroider'd garments roll'd The wanton flame, and crept thro' every fold; Ver. 93. Thro' her crown—Father Hardouin attempts to prove from this passage, that the Æneis was the work of modern impostors; but at the same time greatly betrays his own ignorance of ancient customs. How can a king's daughter, says he, be represented with a crown upon her head, before that insign was ever made use of? Besides, says he, no woman is to be seen with a crown on coins, 'till the 13th century; and thence concludes, that the Æneid was composed after that time. But it is notorious, that those who sacrificed, whether kings or private persons, always performed that ceremony with a crown on their heads. La Cerda thinks, that Lavinia is here represented crowned according to the ancient custom of virgins, when they were about to marry.Then, crackling, thro' her crown victorious plays; The gemms run melting in the golden blaze: Around the fair the dancing glories stray'd, And lambent fires involv'd the lovely maid; Then from her beauteous head enlarging grew, Wide and more wide, and round the palace flew. From this strange sign, portentous to behold, Th'astonish'd seer surprising truths foretold, That bright with fame should shine the glorious fair, But thro' the nations spread the flames of war. Mean time the king, astonish'd at the sign, Hastes to consult his præscient Faunus. sire divine. In dark Albunea's shades, supreme of woods! Where from her fountains boil sulphureous floods; Thick from her streams the clouds of poison rise, And, charg'd with heavy vapours, load the skies. Here, in distress, th'Italian nations come, Anxious, to clear their doubts, and learn their doom. Ver. 111. On the fleeces of the slaughter'd sheep— This solemn description of consulting the old god Faunus, the lying in the temple upon the skins of the sacrificed sheep, the seeing phantoms gliding along, and the hearing an awful voice from the depth of the forest, are all of them circumstances inexpressibly affecting to the imagination. It was a superstitious custom among the ancients, to sleep in the temples of the gods whom they consulted, by way of obtaining their answers in dreams. Spencer alludes to this ceremony, (Fairy Queen, B. 5. c. 7.) where Britomart sleeps in the temple of Isis. Strabo, lib. 16. has spoken concerning the temple of Jerusalem, as a place of this nature; “where (says he) the people either dreamed for themselves, or procured some good dreamer to do it:” By which it should seem (says Mr. Pope) that he had read something concerning the visions of their prophets, as that which Samuel had when he was ordered a third time to sleep before the ark, and upon doing so, had an account of the destruction of Eli's house: or that which happened to Solomon after having sacrificed before the ark at Gibeon. The same author has also mentioned the temple of Serapis, in Book 17. as a place for receiving oracles by dreams.First on the fleeces of the slaughter'd sheep, By night the sacred priest dissolves in sleep: When, in a train, before his slumbering eye, Thin, airy forms, and wondrous visions fly. He calls the pow'rs, who guard th'infernal floods; And talks, inspir'd, familiar with the gods. To this dread oracle the prince withdrew, And first a hundred sheep the monarch slew; Then on their fleeces lay; and from the wood He heard distinct these accents of the god: Ver. 121. Seek not a native prince—This answer (says Catrou) is given by Faunus himself, and not by the oaks which Latinus consulted. This adds a weight and importance to the oracle.Seek not a native prince, my son, nor wed Thy royal daughter to a Latian bed. A foreign chief appears, of mighty fame, Whose race to heav'n shall raise our glorious name; O'er either ocean shall their empire run, Beyond the radiant journeys of the sun. In every clime their standards are unfurl'd! And, prostrate at their feet, shall lie the trembling world! These answers of the god, reveal'd by night, The king divulg'd, and fame display'd to light; Spread the glad tidings all the nations o'er; When now the Trojan navy reach'd the shore. The heroe with his son and chiefs had laid Their limbs at ease beneath a cooling shade; Ver. 135. Then, dictated by Jove, &amp;c.—Founders of colonies ought to accustom themselves to live upon a little; the woods and wild scenes where they generally land, must necessarily afford but a very savage kind of food and entertainment. Catrou.Then, dictated by Jove, the banquet spread On cakes of flour along the verdant mead; The slender cakes the busy Trojans load With fruits austere, and wildings of the wood: These scanty viands soon consum'd, the crew, Compell'd by hunger, on their tables flew; Full eager they devour'd, by want distrest, The frail supporters of the failing feast. Ver. 143. When with a laugh, Ascanius—we devour, The plates and boards on which we fed before— This will be a proper place to insert some admirable observations of Mr. Addison, which will be of great service in explaining and illustrating, not only this, but many other passages in the poem. The story of Æneas, on which Virgil founded his poem, was very bare of circumstances, and by that means afforded him opportunity of embellishing it with fiction, and giving a full range to his own invention. We find, however, that he has interwoven, in the course of his fable, the principal particulars, which were generally believed among the Romans, of Æneas's voyage and settlement in Italy. The reader may find an abridgment of the whole story, as collected out of the ancient historians, and as it was received among the Romans, in Dionsius Halicarnasseus. Since none of the critics have considered Virgil's fable, with relation to this history of Æneas, it may not be perhaps amiss to examine it in this light, so far as regards my present purpose. Whoever looks into the abridgement abovementioned, will find that the character of Æneas is filled with piety to the gods, and a superstitious observation of prodigies, oracles, and predictions; Virgil has not only preserved this character in the person of Æneas, but has given a place in his poem to those particular prophecies, which he found recorded of him in history and tradition. The poet took the matters of fact as they came down to him, and circumstanced them after his own manner, to make them appear the more natural, agreeable, or surprising. I believe very many readers have been shocked at that ludicrous prophecy, which one of the harpyes pronounces to the Trojans in the third book, namely, that before they had built their intended city, they should be reduced by hunger to eat their very tables. But when they hear that this was one of the circumstances that had been transmitted to the Romans in the history of Æneas, they will think the poet did very well in taking notice of it. The historian abovementioned acquaints us, a prophetess had foretold Æneas, that he should take his voyage westward, till his companions should eat their tables: and that accordingly, upon his landing in Italy, as they were eating their flesh upon cakes of bread for want of other conveniencies, they afterwards fed upon the cakes themselves: upon which one of the company said merrily, we are eating our tables. They immediately took the hint, says the historian, and concluded the prophecy to be fulfilled. As Virgil did not think it proper to omit so material a particular in the history of Æneas, it may be worth while to consider, with how much judgment he has qualified it, and taken off every thing that might have appeared improper for a passage in an heroic poem. The prophetess, who foretells it, is an hungry harpy, as the person who discovers it is the young Ascanius. Heus etiam mensas consumimus, inquit Iulus. Such an observation, which is beautiful in the mouth of a boy, would have been ridiculous from any other of the company. The violare manu informs us, that the ancients looked upon their tables as sacred things. When with a laugh, Ascanius—we devour The plates and boards on which we fed before. Th'auspicious words his sire in rapture took, And weigh'd what once the oracle had spoke: Ver. 147. Hail happy—The original is hic patria est: Catrou translates these words, This is our ancient country; meaning that the Trojans were descended from Dardanus, who was an Italian. This interpretation adds much greater dignity to the sentiment, than if we understand it simply (as most of the interpreters do) that, this is the country due to me by fate.Hail happy realm, which fate so long has ow'd! All hail, he cry'd, each guardian Trojan god! My sire, when fair Elysium blest my eyes, Did thus disclose the secrets of the skies: “When, prest by raging famine, you devour “Your boards, impatient, on a foreign shore; “There thy long labours shall with peace be crown'd; “There build thy town, and raise the ramparts round.” This is the famine that the fates foreshow, And this the place to terminate our woe. Then bend we from the port, at dawn of day, Our eager steps, and strike a different way, To view the land, the cities to explore, And know what nations hold the fated shore. Now place again the goblets on the board; Be great Anchises honour'd and ador'd, And pour the wine to heav'n's almighty lord. Then, while the verdant boughs his temples grace, The prince ador'd the Genius of the place; The Nymphs, and unknown pow'rs that rule the floods, And sacred Earth, great source of all the gods; And awful Night; with her the stars that rise, To gild her face, and beautify the skies; And Jove, the guardian god of Troy, implores, And the great mother of th'etherial pow'rs; His mighty parents last, with honours crown'd In heav'n above, and Erebus profound. The hero's vows th'almighty heard from high, And thrice he thunder'd from an azure sky; And shook, majestic as the thunders roll'd, A fiery cloud, that blaz'd with beams of gold. Now thro' the Trojan host the news had flown, The day was come to raise their promis'd town; All, warm'd with transport at the happy sign, Indulge the feast, and quaff the generous wine. Soon as the morning shot a purple ray, And tipp'd the mountains with the beams of day, Ver. 184. By different ways—Scaliger, Book 3. of his Poet. observes, that there is a general resemblance between Ulysses in Homer, and Æneas in Virgil; and that Æneas acts in the same manner as Ulysses. The hero of the Greek poet, Odyss. 10. mounts a cliff after his arrival in the isle of Circe, to see if he could discover any marks of culture, and to listen if he could hear any human voice. This is a pleasing image; and, as Eustathius observes, Ulysses himself takes a general view of the island, but sends his companions for a more particular information. However, the first-mentioned critic remarks, Fusior &amp; latior Homerus invenietur, pictior Virgilius, &amp; numeris astrictior.By different ways the busy train explore The bounds, the cities, and the winding shore. Here dwell the Latian line; there Tyber flows; And here thy sacred stream, Numicus, rose. Now sent the Trojan prince (a peace to gain) A hundred youths selected from the train, With presents for the king. Without delay, All crown'd with olives took their speedy way. Ver. 192. Mean time the chief—The ancients generally marked the limits of their cities or encampments with a plough. This they drew round in a circle: hence some imagine, that urbs is derived from orbis, or urbum, which is the plough-tail. Urbare (according to Varro) is aratro definite.Mean time the chief design'd th'allotted ground For the new town, and drew the trench around: High tow'rs and ramparts all the place inclose; And, like a camp, the sudden city rose. Now the commission'd youths proceed with haste, And spy the lofty Latian spires at last. Before the gate, the blooming active train Or break the fiery courser to the rein, Ver. 200. Or whirl—See Milton's second book of Paradise lost, where the sports of the fallen angels are described with equal pomp and propriety.Or whirl the chariot o'er the dusty plain; Or bend the bow, or toss the whizzing spear, Or urge the race, or wage the mimic war. When lo! a messenger, dispatch'd with speed, Spurs to the Latian court his panting steed, And told the monarch what illustrious guests Arriv'd from foreign lands in foreign vests. The monarch summon'd all the train, and shone, In state majestic on the regal throne. High o'er the town, surrounded by a wood, Old Picus' venerable palace stood,— August and awful! proudly rose, around, A hundred columns, and the structure crown'd. Ver. 213. Here kings—The ancients generally held their assemblies for consulting about state-affairs in their temples. Thus Dido gave audience to the Trojans in the temple of Juno, Book 4.Here kings receiv'd the types of royal pow'r, The crown and scepter, and the robes they wore. This was their temple; this their court of state, Ver. 216. Here at their sacred feasts— Perpetuis considere mensis, Dr. Trapp translates it, ? in order sate Along the boards ? In this manner of sitting there was no distinction of seats. This too was the manner of dining among our ancestors, when the gorgeous feast, was (as Milton describes it) served up in hall by sewers and seneschalls; before the noble spirit of British hospitality made way for the fopperies of France. Perpetui tergo bovis, B. 8. v. 183. is to be understood an ox continued, not cut or divided into parts: perpetui, i. e. perpetim extensi.Here at their sacred feasts the fathers sate; And in long orders, as their thrones they fill'd, On offer'd rams their annual banquets held. Ver. 219. Before the gates—There is a venerable air of antiquity, and of a primæval simplicity in this description of the palace of Latinus, that are highly amusing; especially the statues of the first old kings of Latium. It must have been peculiarly affecting to the Romans, to read this account of their ancestors.Before the gates a venerable band, In cedar carv'd, the Latian monarchs stand. Sabinus there, who prest the foaming wine, Extends the hook that prun'd the generous vine: The front old Italus and Saturn grace, And hoary Janus with his double face; And many an antient monarch, proud to bear In their dear country's cause the wounds of war. Hung on the pillars, all around appears Ver. 228. A row of trophies—&amp;c.— Imitated by Statius Theb. B. 7. ver. 57. in his description of the house of Mars, which I take to be one of the finest passages of that author, Terrarum exuviæ circum, &amp; fastigia templi Captæ insignibant gentes, cœlataque ferro Fragmina portarum, bellatricesque carinæ, Et vacui currus, protritaque curribus ora. Mr. Dryden (and Chaucer before him) have borrowed several circumstances in describing the temple of Mars [the knight's tale] from the above representation of Statius.— Spencer, Fairy Queen, B. 3. C. 11. §. 52. finely applies a description of this kind. He is representing the house of Busyrane, dedicated to the power of love. And all about, the glistening walles were hong With warlike spoyles, and with victorious prayes Of mighty conquerors, and captaines strong, Which were whylom captived in their daies To cruell love, and wrought their own decayes; Their swords, and speares were broke, and hauberques rent ?A row of trophies, helmets, shields and spears, And solid bars, and axes keenly bright, And naval beaks, and chariots seiz'd in fight. With his divining wand in solemn state, With robes succinct the royal Picus sate. Fierce in his car of old he swept the field; And still the heroe grasps the shining shield. Him beauteous Circé lov'd, but lov'd in vain; Th'enchantress dame, rejected with disdain, Transform'd the hapless monarch, in despair, Chang'd to a painted bird, and sent to flit in air. Thus sat the sov'reign in the pompous fane, And gave admission to the Dardan train. Then to th'illustrious strangers, from the throne, The prince with mild benevolence begun. Say, noble Trojans, for we knew your name And ancient race, before your navy came; Ver. 245. What cause your fleet—&amp;c— Thus Polyphemus addresses Ulysses, and his crew. What are ye guests? on what adventure, say, Thus far ye wander in the watry way? Pirates, perhaps, who seek thro' seas unknown The lives of others, and expose your own. Pope's Odyss. 9. 300. La Cerda observes, that Virgil in Latinus's speech is more polite in his suppositions concerning the Trojans, than the Greek poet in the address of Polyphemus. To this I answer, in defence of Homer, that it is quite in the character of the savage giant Polypheme, to ask the Greeks, whether they were not pirates. Such a suspicion, without regard to these new guests, would have been shocking and absurd in a civilized monarch. Add to this, that Polypheme's question was very natural, as piracy was a common practice among the ancients, and was not looked upon as a dishonourable employment. Thucydides says, that even in his time there were several uncivilized countries in Greece, whose inhabitants lived both by sea and land, after the old barbarous manner. Lib. 1. ?? ?????? ????? ???????.What cause your fleet to Latium could convey, What call, thro' such a length of watry way? Or were your gallies wide in ocean lost? Or driv'n by tempests on th'Hesperian coast? Such dangers oft befall the train who ride O'er the wild deeps, and stem the furious tide. Vouchsafe to be our guests, and Latium grace; For know, our generous hospitable race, By Saturn form'd, from him their manners draw, Just without ties, and good without a law. From old Auruntian sages once our ears, Have heard a tale, tho' sunk in length of years; These realms the birth of Dardanus could boast, Who sail'd from hence, and reach'd your Phrygian coast. He left the Tuscan realms, and now on high Dwells in the starry mansions of the sky: Call'd from this nether world to heav'n's abodes,— He reigns above, a god among the gods! O prince divine! great Faunus' glorious son; Ver. 264. Thus to the king Ilioneus— Ilioneus is every where introduced as the speaker: in the first book, where he addresses Dido, he is styled Maximus Ilioneus, ver. 525. Servius observes, that Virgil has not made him an orator without reason; for Homer tells us, that Phorbas, the father of Ilioneus, always fought under the patronage and protection of Mercury, the god of eloquence. This address of Ilioneus, on the arrival of the Trojans, (says Catrou) shews the compleat orator. It is not Æneas; it is Dardanus himself, who is returned to his country: it is he whom the oracles directed to search out the Tyber; it is Dardanus that offers these presents to Latinus.(Thus, to the king, Ilioneus begun;) Nor stars misled our fleets, nor tempests tost, Nor wide we wander'd to the Latian coast, But our determin'd course, spontaneous bore, With one fixt purpose, to this friendly shore; Driv'n from the noblest empire o'er the seas, That the bright sun in all his race surveys. We and our prince derive our birth divine From Jove the source of our etherial line; And at the godlike chief's command we come, His suppliant envoys to this regal dome. Those, who beyond the bounds of ocean hurl'd, Possess that wild unhospitable world; And those who glow beneath the burning zone, Beneath the fiery chariot of the sun, Have heard, and heard with terror from a-far, What a dire deluge, what a storm of war, With ruin charg'd, and furious to destroy, From Greece burst thund'ring o'er the realms of Troy; When Europe shook proud Asia with alarms, And fate set two contending worlds in arms. Snatch'd from that storm, to roll around the floods, We beg some place, to fix our wand'ring gods; Some vacant region, you with ease can spare; The common use of water, earth, and air. Nor shall this new alliance bring disgrace, But add new glories to th'Italian race; Nor Latium shall repent the kind supply, Nor shall the dear remembrance ever die. Now by our potent glorious prince I swear, As true in peace as dreadful in the war: Tho' now as suppliants at thy throne we stand, With humble pray'rs and olives in our hand, Yet many nations, prince, invite our train, And our alliance court, but court in vain. For know, the gods, the mighty gods command The sons of Troy to seek the Latian land. To Tyber's flood great Phœbus urg'd our way, Where spring Numicus' sacred streams to-day; Here Dardanus was born, of heav'nly strain; Hence first he came, and now returns again. Yet more—these presents from the Trojan king, These reliques of his former state we bring, Snatch'd from devouring flames—his sire, of old, Pour'd due libations from this bowl of gold: In these rich robes the royal Priam shone, And gave the law, majestic, from the throne: This crown, this scepter, did the monarch wear; These vests were labour'd by the Trojan fair. He ceas'd—the sov'reign paus'd in thought profound, And fixt his eyes unmov'd upon the ground. Ver. 315. His daughter's—The characteristic of Latinus is piety, and a most religious observance of oracles; of which, he here discovers a most striking instance. He does not regard the gifts nor story of the Trojans, so much as he is transported at the thoughts of marrying his daughter, according to the direction of the gods.His daughter's fortunes all his mind employ, And future empire, not the gifts from Troy. Deep in his mind the prophecy he roll'd, And deem'd this chief, the son the gods foretold, The mighty heroe long foredoom'd by fate To share the glories of the regal state;— From whom a race, victorious by their swords, Should rise in time, the world's majestic lords: Then joyful spoke: may heav'n our counsels bless, And its own omens, with the wish'd success! Well pleas'd, my friends, your presents I receive, And free admission in my kingdoms give; Nor shall you want, while I the throne enjoy, A land as fruitful as the fields of Troy. But let your godlike prince, if he request Our royal friendship, be our honour'd guest; The peace he asks in person he may bring, Go then—report this message to your king.— Ver. 333. A beauteous daughter— It looks very ungallant to us moderns, for a great king to offer his daughter to a stranger, whom he had never so much as seen. But the manners of the ancients were different from ours: besides, we must remember what goes before: Et veteris Fauni volvit sub pectore sortem. Hunc illum fatis ? &amp;c ? And even now he does not offer his daughter, but only relates the oracle, and believes, and hopes, it is to be interpreted in favour of Æneas. Tyranni, in the original, signifies only king.A beauteous daughter in her bloom is mine, Forbid to wed in our Ausonian line: This all our native oracles deny, And every dreadful omen of the sky. From foreign shores, a foreign son appears, Whose race shall lift our glory to the stars. Your prince, the destin'd chief the fates require, Our thoughts divine, and we, my friends, desire. He said, and order'd steeds, to mount the band; Ver. 342. In lofty stalls— Virgil hardly ever mentions a horse, but he takes occasion to dwell for some time on the beauty, furniture, or other circumstances belonging to this noble animal. The joy of Turnus at seeing his horses approaching is shared by the poet himself, and must be likewise by every reader of taste. Poscit equos gaudetque tuens ante ora frementes, &amp;c. Our poet always takes care to place this creature in the best light; and the third Georgic is not the only part of his works, where he has done justice to an animal, for which, it is plain, he had a particular love and esteem.In lofty stalls three hundred coursers stand, Their shining sides with crimson cover'd o'er; The sprightly steeds embroider'd trappings wore, With golden chains, refulgent to behold; Gold were the bridles, and they champ'd on gold. But to their prince he sent a glorious car, With two distinguish'd coursers for the war; Fierce as they flew, their nostrils breath'd a fire; These Circé stole from her celestial sire, By mortal mares on earth, who, all unknown, Mixt with the flaming coursers of the sun. Pleas'd with the monarch's gift, their steeds they press, And to their anxious lord return with peace. But Jove's imperial queen, from Argos far, Rides on the whirlwinds thro' the fields of air. From proud Pachynus' point, her eyes explore The Trojan prince, and all his fleet on shore. Ver. 359. The bulwarks rise— Moliri jam tecta videt, jam fidere terræ. Catrou, Ruæus, Servius, and most of the printed copies read fidere; Pierius affirms that sidere is found in most of the old books: fidere certainly gives a stronger idea. Heinsius would read findere terram; but there is no necessity or authority for such a conjecture.The bulwarks rise, the troops possess the strand, Desert the ships, and pour upon the land; She stood in anguish fixt, and shook her head, Then, fir'd with rage, the wrathful goddess said: Curst race!—a race I labour to destroy!— But Juno sinks beneath the fates of Troy! Ver. 365. Did not the captives,—&amp;c.— Num capti potuere capi? num incensa cremavit Troja viros? I remember, says Dr. Trapp, I have heard a most ingenious and judicious critic, (the late Mr. Smith, of Christ-Church) object against this passage, as somewhat trifling and jingling, and more like one of Ovid's turns, than Virgil's majestic sentences. But perhaps there is no reason for this reflection. In this particular I cannot forbear dissenting from Dr. Trapp, and thinking the lines in question are too jingling and full of conceit, so opposite to Virgil's usual dignified simplicity of style. This playing upon words is much like that of Milton, ? And unfrequented left His righteous altar, bowing lowly down To bestial gods; for which their heads as low Bow'd down in battle. —Parad. lost, B. 1. ver. 433. I must confess there is some sentiment in Virgil's jingle, and something of passion implied in it. After all it is surprising, that our poet should be so close an imitator of Ennius, as to adopt his faults; Quæ nec Dardaniis campis potuére perire Nec cum capta capi, nec cum combusta cremari. Enn. An. L. 10.Did not the captives break the victor's chain? Did not her slaughter'd sons revive again? Did they not force, when Troy in ashes lay, Through fires and armies their victorious way? What—heav'n's great empress flags, by toils opprest! Or sure, her glutted vengeance lies at rest! And yet I dar'd pursue the banish'd train Thro' the last bounds of Neptune's watry reign, With rocks, with gulphs, with thunders from on high, With all the storms of ocean and the sky. In vain with storms I rous'd the roaring main; Earth, skies, and oceans wag'd my war in vain. In vain dire Scylla thunder'd o'er the sea; Nor could the vast Charybdis bar the way. For lo! in Tyber's flood their navies ride, Mock my revenge, and triumph o'er the tide. And yet the god of battles could efface, For one neglect, the Lapithæan race, For one neglect, did Jove himself resign To Dian's wrath the Calydonian line. But I, the queen supreme of gods above, The mighty consort of imperial Jove, In vain for years one nation have pursu'd; Nay by one single mortal am subdu'd! Yet, tho' my pow'rs are baffled, will I try Whatever pow'rs in nature's circle lie. What! tho' the partial heav'ns my aims repel I'll raise new forces from the depths of hell! What!—if the Trojan must in Latium reign! What!—if the fates a regal bride ordain! Yet, may I still the nuptial rite delay, And by a length of wars defer the day. Yet, shall the people bleed; the kings shall reign, The lonely monarchs of an empty plain; Yet shall the father and the son make good Their league of friendship, in their subjects blood; Ver. 401. In the mix'd—&amp;c.— Thus Euripides, Hippol. Coron. v. 550. ??? ?????? ???? ?? ??????, ??? ?????? ??? ?????, ??????? ?? ????????? ???????? ???? ?????? ??????. Naiadem [furentem] ut Baccham, Cum sanguine, &amp; cum fumo, Cruentisque Hyménæis Alcmenæ filio [sc. Herculi] Venus dedit. These lines in Virgil are strong to the last degree, and come with great weight from a deity of Juno's authority. They are indeed a preparative adequate and proportionable to the bloody and eventful war occasioned by Lavinia, and which takes up the ensuing part of the poem.In the mixt blood of nations shall be paid, At large, thy dreadful dow'r, imperial maid! Wed then—with every fatal omen wed:— Bellona waits thee to the bridal bed. The queen of love, like Priam's royal dame, For Ilion has conceiv'd a second flame. A Paris, sprung from Venus, shall destroy Once more with fatal fires the tow'rs of Troy. This said, to earth th'impetuous goddess flies, Inflam'd with rage and vengeance, from the skies; Looks down, and, bending o'er the baleful cell, Calls dire Alecto from the realms of hell. Crimes, frauds and murders are the fiend's delight, The rage of death, and slaughters of the fight. So fierce her looks! such terrors from her eyes! Round her grim front such monstrous serpents rise! Ver. 417. She scares ev'n Pluto— Odit &amp; ipse pater Pluton, odere sorores, Tartareæ monstrum ? The thought of Pluto himself hating this terrible monster, is nobly conceived: the translator I think has finely improved it, by saying that Pluto and her infernal sisters were afraid of her. Such heightenings are doubtless very allowable. Spencer, speaking of Echidna, Echidna is a monster direful dread, Whom gods do hate, and heavens abhor to see; So hideous is her shape, so huge her head, That even the hellish fiends affrighted bee, At sight thereof, and from her presence flee. Fairy Queen, B. 6. C. 6. §. 10.She scares ev'n Pluto, her immortal sire; Her sister furies tremble and retire. Then heav'n's great queen, against the Trojan train, Inflam'd her native rage, and thus began: Ver. 421. Daughter—One cannot forbear observing the fire, spirit and propriety of this speech; and with what force the character of the enraged Juno is supported.Daughter of night! thy potent aid I claim To guard my honour, and support my fame. Oh! let not Troy her pow'rs to Latium bring, Nor with this match amuse her easy king. 'Tis thine, the peace of brethren to confound, To arm their hands, and spread destruction round; Thro' kindling houses, towns and realms, to bear The torch of discord, and the flames of war. To thee a thousand noxious arts are known, And every form of mischief is thy own. Rouse, rouse the fury in thy soul! excite The chiefs, and kindle all the rage of fight! Dissolve the peace; and fir'd by dire alarms, Bid the mad nations rush to blood and arms! Ver. 435. Sudden from her eyes—Virgil does not give his readers any answer of the fury: she is silent, but immediately executes the orders of Juno. Great is the art of knowing how to introduce speeches in epic poetry, or to omit them with propriety and decorum. Catrou.Scarce had she spoke, when sudden from her eyes, Smear'd with Gorgonean blood, the fury flies Sublime; and tow'ring o'er the palace soars; Then stands unseen before Amata's doors; While grief and wrath the raging queen employ, For Turnus, injur'd by the match with Troy. Here stopt the fiend; and, (discord all her view) Snatch'd from her hissing locks, a snake she threw; And thro' her inmost soul the fiery serpent flew. Unfelt, the monster glides thro' every vest, And breathes the secret poison in her breast. Ver. 446. Now, like a fillet—Admirable is this description; especially those dreadful circumstances of the serpent's gliding thro' all the queen's garments, and winding round her temples like a fillet, and round her bosom! &amp;c. Ingentibus excita monstris, is prodigious, meaning that she saw a thousand horrible shapes crowding upon her. Observe the conciseness of infelix.Now like a fillet, round her temples roll'd, Now round her bosom, like a chain of gold. Now to her tresses he repairs, and there Thrids every ringlet of her golden hair. Thus while her kindling soul the pest inspires With the first sparkles of her fatal fires, Before the bosom of the royal dame Felt the full furies of th'infernal flame, She speaks her grief, in accents soft and mild, Implores the sire, and sorrows o'er her child: And must Lavinia then, our only joy, Wed with this wand'ring fugitive of Troy? And can a father issue the decree, So fatal to himself, to her and me? For sure the pirate soon will bear away With the first rising wind the lovely prey. Such, such a guest of old, the Phrygian boy Bore ravish'd Helen to the tow'rs of Troy. Where, where is friendship, truth and honour now? A father's promise, and a monarch's vow! If thy great sire's commands have fixt thy mind, To chuse some heroe of a foreign kind: Then every kind, my lord, and every land Are foreign, that are free from our command; And if we trace brave Turnus' blood, he springs Ver. 471. From a long line—Inachus, Acrisiusque patres— Inachus was the first king of Argos; Clemens Alexandrinus, L. 1. Strom. c. 10. reports, that he was cotemporary with Moses. Acrisius, descended from Inachus, was the last king of Argos, from whence he removed his seat of empire to Mycenæ.From a long line of ancient Argive kings. Thus urg'd the mother, in a mournful strain, Her loud complaints, yet urg'd them all in vain. But now the spreading poison, fir'd her whole, Ev'n to the last recesses of her soul. In her wild thoughts a thousand horrors rise; And fierce, and madding round the streets she flies. Ver. 478. So the gay striplings—Notwithstanding Virgil has taken infinite pains to raise this low image of the top, by describing it in the most elegant and choice expressions; yet I cannot forbear being still of opinion, that it is an object too mean to have a place in an epic poem.So the gay striplings lash in eager sport, A top, in giddy circles, round a court. In rapid rings it whirls, and spins aloud, Admir'd with rapture by the blooming crowd; From every stroke, flies humming o'er the ground, And gains new spirit, as the blows go round. Thus flew the giddy queen, with fury stung, Thro' the wide town, amid the wond'ring throng. Yet more;—the destin'd nuptials to delay, Fierce to the darksome wood she bounds away; And, rising still in rage, with rites divine She feign'd new orgies to the god of wine. Ver. 490. Thou, Bacchus, only thou—What elegance of madness is this!—It was customary for young virgins, to consecrate their hair to some deity; this they nourished with particular care, and never cut it off till just before marriage, and then it was hung up in the temple of the deity to whom it before was devoted. All the following description is animated with true poetic enthusiasm. One is ready to cry out with Horace, while one is perusing it, Quo me Bacche rapis tui plenum?—Thou, Bacchus, only thou, deserv'st the fair! For thee in ringlets grows her lovely hair! For thee she leads the dance, and wreaths her ivy spear. Now spread around the wild infectious flames; With the same fury glow the Latian dames; Let loose their flying tresses in the wind, Rush to the woods, and leave the town behind; Toss high their ivy-spears; while clamours rise, And trembling shrieks, tumultuous rend the skies. The madding queen, with rage superior stung, Rear'd high a flaming pine, amid the throng, And for young Turnus rais'd the nuptial song. Then rolls her fiery eyes, and loud exclaims: Hear, all ye matrons! hear ye Latian Dames! If yet a mother's woes your souls can move, If yet your injur'd princess shares your love; Like me, unbind your tresses; rove abroad; And hold these sacred orgies to the god. Thus the fierce fiend Amata's breast invades, And drives her raving to the sylvan shades. When all the monarch's palace she survey'd, With all his counsels in confusion laid; As wide around the rising fury grew, On dusky wings to Ardea swift she flew: Ardea, by Danaë built in days of yore, When with her Argive train she sought the shore; But now her perish'd ruins are no more! Where o'er the rest brave Turnus' mansion rose, She found the heroe sunk in soft repose; And first, her dread infernal form to hide, Laid the grim terrors of her front aside: With silver hairs her temples were o'erspread, And wreathes and verdant olives crown'd her head. Her wither'd face with wrinkles was embost, And in the woman all the fiend was lost. Ver. 525. She now appear'd a venerable dame— Statius, (but with little success upon the whole) has imitated this passage, Theb. L. 2, 94. where the shade of Laius disguis'd under the figure of Tircsias, appears to Tydeus asleep. However it must be owned, that Laius waking Tydeus, throwing off his disguise, and discovering himself to be his grandfather, has a fine effect. ? Ramos ac vellera fronti Diripuit confessus avum, dirique Nepotis Incubuit stratis:—jugulum mox cæde patentem Nudat, &amp; undanti perfundit vulnere somnum. Illi rapta quies; attollit membra, toroque Erigitur plenus monstris, vanumque cruorem Excutiens, simul horret avum, fratremque requirit, &amp;c.She now appear'd a venerable dame, And to the couch like Juno's priestess came: Then are thy labours vain, (she thus begun,) And shall a Trojan seize thy rightful throne? The king denies the crown he long has ow'd, Denies the fair thy labours bought with blood. Go—save his kingdom; fight the Tuscan train!— Go, prince, and conquer, to be scorn'd again! Hear then by me the mandate from on high Sent by the mighty empress of the sky: Fly, fly; the valiant youth for arms prepare; And thro' the opening gates let loose the war. Lo! where in Tyber ride the fleets of Troy; Go then, their chiefs and painted ships destroy; So Heav'n commands—and, if the Latian lord Detain the fair, regardless of his word, Let him in blood thy vengeful sword deplore, The sword that conquer'd in his cause before. Thus the dissembled dame—with scornful pride, In haughty terms the martial youth reply'd: The tidings you convey, I knew before; The Trojan fleet is landed on the shore. Hence—nor with idle tales my bosom move; I live secure in Juno's guardian love. But, worn with years, you dote with vain alarms, And, when you nod, you dream of kings in arms. Go, mother, go—and make your gods your care, But leave to men the province of the war. Ver. 553. While yet— Juvenal was particularly struck with this description. He singles it out from all other instances, as a passage where Virgil had exerted his poetical fire in the greatest degree. ? Qualis Rutulum confundat Erynnis: Nam si Virgilio puer, &amp; tolerabile desit Hospitium, cederent omnes a crinibus Hydri, Surda nihil gemeret grave Buccina. ? —Sat. 7.While yet he spoke, her looks the youth confound, And the black fiend in all her terrors frown'd. Agast, he shook, and trembled with affright, While all her native horrors blast his sight. Ver. 557. Such a tremendous front— This whole description is perhaps the most sublime, and most spirited of all the Æneid. The circumstances of her changing her assumed appearance into her real terrible personage, her enlarging and spreading to the sight, the hissing of the serpents round her head, the rolling her eyes, snatching two serpents from her head, and clanging her sounding whip, and throwing the torches into his breast to inflame him, are all conceived in the loftiest and liveliest manner imaginable. I cannot forbear adding, that Mr. Pitt has done justice to this passage, in his translation of it. The expression here of Tantaque so facies aperit, always used to strike me very particularly; and I always used to fansy (I don't know whether rightly or not) that it meant “the appearance of a horrid face, that grew continually larger and larger, to the troubled mind of the person who beheld it.” Spence.Such a tremendous front the fury spread, So dreadful hist the serpents round her head; So grim a figure now she seem'd to rise; That hell, all hell was open'd in her eyes! Then, e're the fault'ring trembling youth reply'd, She roll'd their fiery orbs from side to side; Snatch'd two black serpents from her locks, and shook The sounding scourge, and thund'ring thus she spoke: Behold, behold the wretch, by vain alarms And age, reduc'd to dream of kings in arms! A fury from the deeps of hell, I bear, In these dread hands, destruction, death and war! With that a flaming torch the goddess threw; Deep thro' his breast the fiery weapon flew. Strait rouz'd the startled warrior; and a stream Of sweat ran copious down from every limb. Thro' the wide dome he raves with mad alarms, He runs, he flies, he calls aloud to arms; Fell wrath and vengeance in his eyes appear, The thirst of slaughter, and the rage of war. Ver. 577. So when— Monsieur Segrais mentions this simile in conjunction with that of the top above-cited, as being both of the low kind. But there is manifestly a wide difference between them. This is far more grand and heroical than that. Nay, I know not what can give us a greater and more terrible idea of human rage and fierceness, than the boiling of liquor in a cauldron. The whole simile (the hint of which, for it is no more, is taken from the 21st Iliad of Homer) is in every part admirable: And there are few beauties, even in Virgil himself, preferable to this. I will not transcribe the whole; but refer to the last line only. Let any man consider how the flakes of smoke follow, and seem to push forward one another, as they ascend into the air; and then take notice of this verse: Nec, jam, se, capit, unda, volat, vapor, ater, ad auras. I have added a comma to every word; that the reader may observe the cadence, and seeming length of the verse, plainly expressing the long spires and wreaths of smoke. It seems almost as long as two; and yet does not all consist of dactyls: So ingeniously judicious is the disposition or situation of the words. Trapp.So when in parting spires the flame divides, And crackling climbs around the cauldron's sides, In the deep womb glow fierce the hissing streams, Boil, swell and foam, and bubble o'er the brims; Till high in air the fuming liquids rise, And in a length of vapours mount the skies. He sends to great Latinus, to declare The peace polluted, and denounce the war: To arms he cries,—this moment will we go To guard our country, and repel the foe. Himself, he boasts, will all the war maintain, And fight the Trojan and Ausonian train. His troops take fire, and (heav'n invok'd in pray'r,) With eager rage they gather to the war; Some by his beauty mov'd, his cause embrace, Some by his valiant deeds, and regal race. While thus his social train the prince inspires, Swift to the Trojan host the fiend retires. Big with new mischiefs to the place she came, Where young Iulus hunts the savage game. A stag he chac'd; the chace the fury sees, And bids the scent grow warm in every breeze; His opening hounds, exulting, shoot away, And bear impatient on the panting prey: From this light cause she rais'd the first alarms, And fir'd the brutal swains to blood and arms.— Snatch'd from the dam, by Tyrrheus' children rear'd, (Tyrrheus, chief master of the royal herd,) Ver. 605. Had this stag— This passage in the original, from cervus erat, down to ferebat, is all in Virgil's true pastoral style; and most of the lines in it, run in his pastoral, rather than his epic versification. I will explain myself: If Handel was to set several poems, of different sorts, tho' all in ten-syllable verse, to music; the general character of his composition for elegy, would be mournful; for an epithalamium, joyous; for a pastoral, sweet; for a didactic poem, sedate; and for an epic, majestic. A good poet should observe the same difference in the flow of his numbers, for such different subjects, as the other would in the air of his music. To make this the more generally intelligible, it may not be improper, just to add an instance of each of the sorts of versification above-mentioned. 1. The mournful, In these deep solitudes and awful cells, Where heav'nly-pensive contemplation dwells. Eloisa to Abelard. 2. The joyous. And in the sparkling goblet laughs the wine. Odyssey. 3. The sweet. Ye shady beeches, and ye cooling streams. Pope's 2d Pastoral. 3. The sedate. Laugh where we must, be candid where we can, But vindicate the ways of God to man. Ethic Epistles. 4. The majestic. Jove on his couch reclin'd his awful head, And Juno slumber'd on the golden bed. Spence.With care domestic had this stag been bred; Of beauteous shape; and antlers grac'd his head. The beast became their sister's darling care; Ver. 608. His horns were dress'd— Ovid trifles egregiously in describing the caresses which Cyparissus paid to his favourite stag, and the ornaments which he gave him. It must be confessed, that this subject is admirably calculated to admit of puerile decorations, and minute prettinesses. But Virgil knew how to write with reservedness and simplicity on every subject: How beautiful are those lines, Mollibus intexens ornabat cornua sertis Pectebatque ferum, puroque in fonts lavabat, Ille, manum patiens, mensæque assuetus herili, Errabat sylvis; rursusque ad limina nota Ipse domum, serâ quamvis, se nocte ferebat. When oppos'd to Ovid's, Cornua fulgebant auro; demissaque in armos Pendebant tereti gemmata monilia collo. Bulla super frontem parvis argentea loris Vincta movebatur, parilique ex ære nitebant Auribus in geminis circum cava tempora baccæ. And afterwards [speaking to Cyparissus.] Tu modo texebas varios per cornua flores; Nunc eques in tergo residens, huc lætús &amp; illuc Mollia purpureis frænabas ora capistris. Met. B. 9. circiter p. 115.His horns were dress'd with garlands by the fair. Fed from the board, accustom'd to command, The fawn familiar lick'd her stroking hand. Full oft she bath'd him in the limpid tide, And fondly curious comb'd his silken hide: All day amid the forests would he roam, But came each evening to his wonted home. Ascanius' hounds had rouz'd the trembling prey, As down the gentle flood he took his way, And on the cooling bank in length luxuriant lay. The youthful heroe fir'd with love of fame, Directs a feather'd arrow at the game; The feather'd arrow flew; the fury guides Ver. 621. The pointed weapon—The killing this favourite deer may, to some critics who relish nothing but pompous circumstances in a poem, appear to be but a trifling occasion for the raising this terrible war. But surely nothing could be more natural; nay, its being a little circumstance renders its beauty still more pleasing to a lover of nature, who knows how many important events have been occasioned by circumstances seemingly trifling in themselves. La Cerda has collected together a great number of instances, of many bloody wars that have arisen from as small causes, as this in Latium. See Bayle Pensées diverses, pag. 467.The pointed weapon thro' the wanton's sides. Pierc'd with the dart, the bleeding fawn in vain Flies back for refuge to his home again; Ver. 624. Complains with human tears—These most beautiful and pathetic lines are so moving, as scarce to be read without tears. I would recommend the perusal of them to some of our British heroines, who have had the honour of cutting a stag's throat, after a chace in Windsor forest.Complains with human tears, and human sighs, And begs for aid with unavailing cries. The beauteous Sylvia heard his moving strains, Beat her white bosom, and alarm'd the swains. Inspir'd with sudden rage they wing their way, For in the wood the lurking fury lay. Some arm'd with knotted clubs, impetuous came, And some with staves well-season'd in the flame. With stones or brands the peasants throng from far, And every sudden weapon, to the war. Ver. 634. Tyrrheus who clove an oak— The author of the preface to Mr. Dryden's Pastorals of Virgil (supposed to be Mr. Walsh,) is mistaken in calling Tyrrheus the master of the horse to king Latinus. He is only the intendant of his flocks; or, as Dryden translates it, Tyrrheus chief ranger to the Latian king. ? Cui regia parent Armenta ? The circumstance of his being alarmed while he is engaged in the rustic employment of cleaving an oak, and instantly snatching up an ax, is beautifully natural. We are to remember, that the deer just now killed, was under the charge of Tyrrheus; on which account he, as it were in right of his character, arms the peasants to encounter those who killed it.Tyrrheus who clove a tree with many a stroke, Left the huge wedge within the gaping oak; Then seiz'd the pond'rous ax with loud alarms, And call'd the rustics all around to arms. Mean time the fury from her stand descries The growing discord every moment rise; Ascends the roof, and, from the lofty height, Calls in the boist'rous peasants to the fight: With her full force her mighty horn she winds; Th'infernal strain alarms the gath'ring hinds. The dreadful summons the deep forests took; The woods all thunder'd, and the mountains shook. The lake of Trivia heard the note profound; The Veline fountains trembled at the sound. The thick sulphureous floods of hoary Nar Shook at the blast that blew the flames of war: Ver. 650. Pale at the piercing call— This stroke of nature is tender and affecting to the last degree. Other poets would have been satisfied to have mentioned the effects of this dreadful blast upon the woods and mountains, &amp;c. Virgil knew that this circumstance of the mothers catching their infants to their breasts would more touch and interest his readers than all the other pompous images, great as they are. This description is copied from Apollonius Rhodius Argonaut. B. 4, 129. The poet is speaking of the dragon that guarded the golden fleece. ? ?????? ?? ????????, ???? ?? ?????? ?????? ????????, ??? ??????? ????? ?????. ?????? ?? ??? ?????? ???? ????????? ???? ??????? ??? ???????? ???? ???????? ??????, ??? ????????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????, ?????? ?????????? ????? ????, ? ?? ??? ???? ????????? ?????? ??? ?? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ?? ????????? ???????, ???? ?? ????? ?????????, ?? ?? ???? ??? ???????????? ????? ????? ???????????, ?????? ????? ??????????. The dragon hissed horribly, and all around, the long-extended banks of the river, and the vast grove resounded. They who inhabit Colchis, not far from the Titanian land (near the mouth of the river Lycus, &amp;c.—) heard it: The mothers were struck with fear, and the infants which slept in their bosoms, being affrighted at the hissing, stretch'd forth their hands as in amaze. Euripides has finely touch'd this last circumstance in his Troades. ????? ?? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ????? ?????? ??????????. The beloved infants clasp'd their fearful hands round the robes of their mothers.Pale at the piercing call, the mothers prest With shrieks their starting infants to the breast. Thus the mad rustics caught the dire alarms, And at the horrid signal flew to arms. Nor less, in succour of the princely boy, Pour forth to battle all the troops of Troy: Clubs, staves and brands, at first the fight maintain; But now embody'd armies spread the plain, And deadly swords and shining bucklers wield; And groves of spears gleam dreadful o'er the field. Ver. 660. On brazen arms—Sole lacessita in the original, gives a most strong and beautiful image; as if there were a kind of rivalry, between the sun and the shining metal; and the last strikes back the rays of the first; being as it were provoked by it, and so shines with greater lustre; as a man when he returns a blow, exerts his strength more than usually. I take this to be the true sense of the word lacessita, in this place; if I am wrong in my conjecture, I hope it may be excused, because no commentator instructs me. Trapp.On brazen arms the sun refulgent plays, And to the skies the fiery helmets blaze. So when the wind has stirr'd the gentle seas, The waves just swell, and whiten by degrees; Till all the heaving watry worlds arise, In one vast burst of thunder to the skies. First Almon, Tyrrheus' eldest hope, was slain, Fierce as he fought, the foremost on the plain: Beneath his throat the arrow found its way; And choak'd in blood, the beauteous warrior lay. Now heaps on heaps fall thick on every side, And in the cloud of fight Galesus dy'd; Good old Galesus! while, with earnest care, He labour'd to prevent the rising war: The sage for justice bore the foremost place, Ver. 675. Tho' far the wealthiest—How frequent are the opportunities of observing the good sense and true judgment of Virgil? On this occasion he hath shewn great penetration, and a true knowledge of nature, in making old Galesus, who was the wealthiest of the Latins, and had the most property to lose, remarkably active in endeavouring to prevent the ravages of war.Tho' far the wealthiest of the Latian race: Five flocks, five bellowing droves, his pastures held, And with a hundred teams he turn'd the spacious field. Thus, while on either side, the martial train With mutual slaughter bath'd the purple plain: When the stern fury, from her promise freed, Beheld with joy the growing battle bleed; She leaves th'Hesperian shores she mounts the skies, And in proud triumph thus to Juno cries: Behold my promise, mighty queen! made good; The Trojan sword has drawn the Latian blood. War, boundless war, runs raging round the plain; Nor can yourself command the peace again; Speak but your will, I'll spread the dire alarm, And bid the bord'ring towns and countries arm, Both sides to aid, the nations shall repair; Wide round, the rising discord will I bear, And rouze in every breast the furies of the war. Enough, replies the queen, enough is done, The war stands fixt; the slaughters are begun. They fly to war; their arms with blood distain: Death, Rage, and Terror range the purple plain. Such are the nuptial rites, that we prepare For Latium's king, and Venus' worthy heir! But go—this moment leave the realms above; Go—nor offend the sacred eyes of Jove. To thy unhallow'd feet the sire denies Th'etherial walks, and freedom of the skies. Retire to hell! if aught remains undone, Ourself shall finish what thy toils begun. Swift as the goddess spoke, the fury springs With rapid speed, and spreads her dusky wings; Her serpents hissing all around, she flies To hell's dark realms, impetuous, from the skies. Ver. 709. Lies a deep vale— Virgil says expressly, that this descent of Alecto to hell, was in the vale of Amsanctus. Amsanctus is placed, both by the ancients and moderns, in the kingdom of Naples, between Trevicum and Acherontia. There was anciently a temple, built to Mephites here; as the deity who presided over noisome and pestilential smells. Hence the place is to this day called Nesanto and Mussito Virgil says, it was under the mountains in the midst of Italy; that it was inclosed with woods on each side; that there were hollows and several spiracula about it; and that the waters burst up into the air, and then fell down again, in a broken manner; for so, I think, one ought to understand his torto vertice torrens, and rupto Acheronte vorago. Both the spiracula, and this broken spout of water falling in upon itself, are described by another poet, of the greatest credit for the times he lived in, which was about 400 years after Virgil. Tunc &amp; pestiferi pacatum flumen Averni Innocuæ, transistis, aves! Flatumque repressit Amsonctus; tacuit, fixo torrente, vorago. Claudian, de Rapt. Prof. 2. ver. 350. Virgil alludes to the pestilential stench there, in the word pestiferas. The words amsanctus, and mephites, were used for a stench by the Roman writers; and the smells in this place were looked upon anciently as mortal.—Taceo, quod alarum specubus hircosis atque acescentibus latera captiva vallatus, nares circumsedentium ventilatâ duplicis amsancti peste funestat. Sidonius Apollinaris, Lib. 3. Ep. 13. —Sævamque exhalat opaca mephitim. Virgil Æn. 7. ver. 84. —Spiracula vocant; item in Hirpinis, amsancti ad mephitis ædem locum; quem qui intrant moriuntur. Pliny Nat. Hist. lib. 2. cap. 93. —The place which is now called Nesanto, (as supposed by corruption from amsanctus, see Leon. Alberti, fol. 101.) is in a dark vale, near Trevico; inclosed on each side by hills, and gloomy woods. In the midst are two or three filthy holes; in one of which the water bursts up to the height of three or four feet (sometimes more, and sometimes less) and then falls in again upon itself. It smells horribly, the earth being all impregnated with sulphur. There are several vents of wind in the sides of the hills near this odious bason, which you find to come out with a good deal of force, if you hold your hand to the vent, and they make more noise than a smith's bellows. A particular friend of mine who has been there, says, he found out the place by the noise. The water, in the holes abovementioned, is generally of a black look; and is still so much regarded as infectious, that the country-people do not much care to go with you to it. I know not whether it may be worth mentioning, that they have still stories and pictures in those parts, of a saint driving the devil (who had been very troublesome, it seems, in the country) back again to hell, through one of these holes. No one piece of ground now can, I think, answer to an ancient description more punctually and exactly, than this does to Virgil's account of Amsanctus. I know but one objection that can be made to it, which is from Virgil's saying that it is situated.—Italiæ medio. Nesanto, you may say, is very far from being in the midst of Italy; Naples lies above half-way in that country, and Nesanto is yet a hundred miles farther. Tho' the other circumstances of the place all tally so well, yet its failing in one point, and that so material and unchangeable a one, must destroy the whole. This objection would be very strong, if no place could be said to be the middle of Italy, except what was so, taking it in length: but may not a place be said to be in the middle of Italy, taking the country in breadth, as well as in length? I do not know whether that expression would be so proper now; but anciently they said the Apennines lay in the middle of Italy, which must be understood of the breadth. Umbrosis mediam mediam qua collibus Apenninus Erigit Italiam ? Lucan, lib. 2. ver. 397. And Dionysius, in his geography says that this mountain lies as exactly in the midst of Italy, as if it had been directed by a line: ????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ??? ??? ?? ????? ???? ?????? ?????? ????? ??? ?? ??????? ?????????? ??? ?? ?????? ????? ????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ?? ?? ?? ???????????? ????????. ? ??????. ver. 338. Now Nesanto (or the vale of Amsanctus) does not only lie among the Apennines; but is situated too, at near an equal distance from the mare superum, and the mare infernum; and so may the more strictly be said, to be in the midst of Italy; Italiæ medio, sub montibus altis. If there is any thing in this long account, which may give any new or stronger lights to this noted passage in the Æneid, I am obliged for it to a very particular friend Mr. Holdsworth. of mine, a gentleman of our own country; who has travelled often into Italy, and who (I believe,) is much better acquainted with it as classic ground, than any man now living. He had the curiosity in one of his voyages, to go to Nesanto; and it is from him that I have given the above account of the appearance, which that place makes at present. Spence.Amid fair Italy, renown'd by fame, Lies a deep vale, Amsanctus is the name. Her gloomy sides are shaded with a grove; And a huge range of mountains tow'rs above; Fierce thro' the dusky vale the torrents pour, And o'er the rattling stones the whirlpools roar. There the black jaws of hell are open'd wide; There rolls dire Acheron his fiery tide; There lies the dark infernal cave, and there Grim Pluto breathes the soft etherial air. Down thro' this dreadful opening, from on high, The fiend plung'd headlong, and reliev'd the sky. Mean time the queen of heav'n exerts her care, With her last hand to crown the growing war. In one vast tide the loud tumultuous swains Pour to the city, and desert the plains. Young Almon's corse they bear in open sight, And old Galesus slaughter'd in the fight; Implore the gods with vows, and beg in vain The hoary monarch to revenge the slain. While the fierce Daunian lord's complaints conspire, To spread the gath'ring fears of sword and fire. Turnus, he cries, is banish'd with disgrace, And wrong'd in favour of a foreign race. The king prefers a Trojan for his son; A Trojan prince already fills the throne! Those too, whose mothers by the queen were led, When, fir'd by Bacchus, to the woods she fled, (Such was her interest in the realm) declare For open arms, and breathe revenge and war. War is the fatal universal cry, Ver. 740. Against all omens—To justify his hero in endeavouring to deprive Turnus of Lavinia, who was betrothed to him, the poet frequently puts us in mind that it was the will of heaven; and by that means artfully flings the whole blame of this destructive war on the Latins.Against all omens of the angry sky!— Furious they crowd their sovereign's regal door, And, madding, round the rich pavilions roar; Besiege their king, as waves a rock, in vain, Some mighty rock, amidst the rolling main; That hears unmov'd the sounding tempests blow, That sees the furious surges foam below; And o'er the deeps, majestic to the sight, Stands fixt, and glories in its matchless height, Proud of its bulk; while storms and working tides Fly, dash and break against the tow'ring sides! When long the prince had labour'd to retain The rising madness of their souls in vain, And saw the crowd no counsel would obey, But rush'd to arms as Juno led the way; The mournful sire obtests the gods and skies; And lo! we yield to fate the monarch cries. The storm impetuous bears us down the flood— But heav'n, heav'n claims your sacrilegious blood! Thou too, rash Turnus, shalt thy part sustain, And late, too late, implore the gods in vain! Safe to the port am I already come, And all your king can lose, is but a tomb! Then pensive he retir'd, and left to fate The reins of empire, and the cares of state. Ver. 765, A solemn custom—Virgil here attributes a custom to the old Latins, the origin of which was of a later age. This is yet allowable enough. Livy assures us, that the ceremony of opening the gates of Janus was not instituted till the reign of Numa Pompilius; yet to decorate his poem with so fine a circumstance, our poet describes this custom as far more ancient.A solemn custom in Hesperia reign'd, Which long the potent Alban lords maintain'd, And Rome still holds, when, terrible in might, The world's great empress sends her sons to fight. Whether the chain for Dacia they prepare, Or wage th'Hyrcanian, or Arabian war, Ver. 771. Or their victorious arms, &amp;c.—The poet with infinite address takes care to exemplify this custom by those wars in which Augustus had so great and glorious a share. There is a great majesty in these lines.Or their victorious arms on India turn, And spread her eagles to the rising morn; Or urge proud Parthia's long-expected doom, And bring in pomp our ravish'd ensigns home.— Two massy solid gates have ever stood, For ages sacred to the Mars. Thracian god. Old, double Janus guards the dreadful doors; Grim war within, his mighty captive, roars. On many a pond'rous hinge the gates are hung; With brazen bars impenetrably strong. Soon as the fathers of the state proclaim, The fight must vindicate the Roman fame; Strait, at their high decree, the consul, drest In the rich sacred robe and Gabine vest, While the loud trumpets sound a martial strain, (In pomp attended by the valiant train,) Throws wide the gates; and thro' the nations far Lets loose the boundless furies of the war. So now the madding Latian crowds implore Their monarch, to unfold the sacred door. But from the fatal office he withdrew, Abhorr'd the province, and retir'd from view. Ver. 793. Then heav'n's—It is finely imagined to make Juno herself descend to open the gates of Janus, on Latinus's refusing to do it. It may be considered as a just and beautiful allegory, representing by this action, that she is the occasion of the war.Then heav'n's dread empress, while the prince delay'd, Shot down, and both the bursting gates display'd: The bolts fly back, with every brazen bar; And, like a storm, broke forth th'imprison'd war. Till now unmov'd by discord and alarms, Ausonia burns, and calls her sons to arms. Some to the furious fight on foot proceed; Some vault impetuous on the bounding steed. Some whet the blunted pole-ax for the field, Brighten the spear and long-neglected shield; With transport hear the trumpet's clangors rise, And view the banners streaming in the skies. Ardea, proud Tybur, Crustumerium's pow'rs, Atina strong, and high Antemnæ's tow'rs, Five potent cities, all their sons employ, To forge new arms against the troops of Troy. For greaves the ductile silver they extend, And for the shield the pliant sallow bend: The guiltless arms the rural trade affords, Scythes, plough-shares, hooks, are streighten'd into swords. And in the glowing forges they restore The blunted faulchions which their fathers wore. And now the sprightly trumpets sound from far; The word flies round; the signal of the war. Some snatch the polish'd helm with eager speed; Some to the yoke compel the snorting steed. Brace on the golden cuirass, seize the shield; And, with the glitt'ring sword, rush furious to the field. Ver. 821. Ye muses! now— This fresh invocation alarms the reader, and greatly raises his attention. Mr. Pope's observations on Homer's catalogue are very applicable to Virgil's, and are extremely judicious. We may observe first, what an air of probability is spread over the whole poem by the particularizing of every nation and people concerned in this war. Secondly, what an entertaining scene he represents to us of so many countries, drawn in their liveliest and most natural colours; while we wander along with him amidst a beautiful variety of towns, havens, forests, vineyards, groves, mountains, and rivers: and are perpetually amused with his observations on the different soils, products, situations, or prospects. Thirdly, what a noble review he makes pass before us of so mighty an army, drawn out in order troop by troop; which, had the number only been told in the gross, had never filled the reader with so great a notion of the importance of the action. Fourthly, the description of the different arms, and manner of fighting of the soldiers; and the various attitudes he has given to the commanders. Of these leaders, the greatest number are either the immediate sons of gods, or the descendants of gods: And how great an idea must we have of a war, to the waging of which so many demi-gods and heroes are assembled? Fifthly, the several artful compliments he paid by this means to his own country in general, and to many of his contemporaries in particular, by a celebration of the genealogies, ancient seats, and dominions of the great men of his time. Sixthly, the agreeable mixture of narrations from passages of history, or fables; with which he amuses and relieves us at proper intervals. Pope. This catalogue takes in all the parts of Italy between the mare inferum, and Apennines inclusive: Mantua is the only place out of this line, which is attach'd with a great deal of address to Tuscany—10, 198–214. And G. 2, 533. and Æn. 3, 168. Holdsworth. At the beginning of the principal part of this book, and indeed of the poem itself, which is the catalogue or review, the poet invokes the muses, and according to his example, there is no one who has not pursued his manner in passages of this kind. The reason of which, in my opinion, is, that the poet entering into a large detail of a thing of a very ancient date, he will the sooner be believed if he invokes the divinities that are able to instruct him in it. We find likewise by Virgil, that the muses alone were capable of guiding him through this labyrinth; but I know not, whether those who recite adventures of less ancient date, and who with a little trouble might find in the herald's office, or in a great number of historians, the names of all those who are engaged in the battles described, do well to begin like Virgil with an invocation to the muses, and to make them so long as those which we generally meet with in their works. This is the remark which Mr. Maroles has made on this subject. For myself, I shall be content to admire the great art of Virgil in this place, and how short he is in comparison of all others, particularly the moderns: so that one cannot find any part of the poem more diversified or full than this. For what is there more exact in geography itself, than the places he describes? or more curious for the learned, than what he relates concerning antiquity in general. What is more varied than his expressions? I have said, that in these passages he sometimes makes use of apostrophes, in order to vary them; and there is no doubt, that it is for this reason alone; for otherwise he would be always saying the same thing. But one might still observe with how much artifice the poet knows how to diversify the arms, habits, qualities, and adventures of the heroes, whose glory he intends to celebrate. Homer makes, and some of our moderns after his example, have made, a whole book of what our poet passes over in 170 lines. But, not to do the same thing again, when he shall be obliged to speak of those people, who came to the succour of the Trojans, and of the Trojans themselves, we shall see in Book X. that it will be under a very different form. He hints in Book I. the names of the most celebrated chiefs of Æneas's fleet in his narrative, without making a particular chapter of them: foreseeing that he shall be obliged to give a regular catalogue of them, in the seventh and tenth books. Treating in this place of the army of the Latins, he divides it into squadrons and cohorts: instead of which in Book X. he gives us the catalogue in a different manner, while he describes the ships of the Tuscan fleet, and all this to vary his images; and he likewise describes the strength of the vanquish'd party, that the honour of the victory may appear greater, and the glory of his heroe shine forth with a more conspicuous lustre. Segrais.Ye muses! now unlock your sacred spring; Inspire your bard, and teach him how to sing What mighty heroes led the martial train, And what embattled armies spread the plain: The Latian chiefs, ye goddesses! declare, And the dire progress of the wasteful war; You know, and can record the pow'rs who came, Which we learn only from the voice of fame. Ver. 829. Mezentius—Varro relates, that Mezentius was king of the Rutuli. That he strictly commanded his subjects to pay him tribute, the first-fruits of their herbs, and their animals; which before had been always appropriated to the sacrifices of the gods. It was hence he came to be called contemptor divûm. Virgil, with just reason, represents him as one of the kings of Etruria, divided into several little states, called Lucominies. See Macrob. Sat. B. 3. c. 5.Mezentius first, who scorn'd th'immortal pow'rs, Conducts his armies from the Tuscan shores. Him follow'd Lausus, flush'd with youthful fire, A son, whose shining virtues might require A happier throne, and far a better sire! He tam'd the steed, and urg'd the generous chace, And none but Turnus match'd his blooming face: He led from fair Agylla to the plain A thousand warriors, but he led in vain! Great Aventinus, great Alcides' son Wore the proud trophy that his father won: Ver. 840. A hundred serpents— In the heroic ages of the world, bucklers adorned with serpents, and other frightful animals, were frequently made use of, to give a terrible aspect. Euripides in Phæniss. thus represents Adrastus, ???? ?? ???????? ???????? ?? ???????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ????? ?(????. ? Adrastus verò erat in septimâ portâ Implens scutum picturâ centum viperarum Hydræ ? Statius perhaps has indulged his fancy too much, in describing shields of this sort, Theb. B. 4. And here by the way I shall observe, that his genius seems to be peculiarly suited to such sort of descriptions. In the following lines, the very habit of Mezentius is suitable to his temper and character.A hundred serpents round his buckler roll'd, And Hydra hiss'd from all her heads, in gold. Fresh wreaths of palm his lofty chariot crown'd And fierce he lash'd his fiery coursers round. When great Alcides from Geryon slain Return'd triumphant to the Latian plain; And the brave victor, safe in these abodes, Cool'd his Hesperian herds in Tyber's floods; He won in shades the beauteous Rhæa's grace, And this bold heroe crown'd his strong embrace, Born in mount Aventine's sequester'd wood; The mortal mother mingling with the god. His valiant troops long Sabine javelins bear, And arm'd with steely piles, provoke the war. He stalk'd before his host; and, wide dispread, A lion's teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his head: Then sought the palace in this strange attire, And look'd as stern and dreadful as his sire. From Tibur, Coras and Catillus came, Tibur, the town that took their brother's name. Brave youths! who led the martial Argive train, And rush'd the foremost to th'embattled plain. Ver. 862. So two fierce Centaurs— Those who think Virgil had not a strong and sublime imagination, are desired to consider this simile: All the circumstances of it are painted with Homeric spirit and magnificence, particularly ? Dat euntibus ingens Sylva locum, &amp; magno cedunt Virgulta fragore. To have a just idea of the thing described, says Burmannus, we are to suppose these centaurs half-horse and half-man, but resembling the horse in the fore-part, and so bearing down with their breasts all that stood in their way. Statius, Theb. 9, 220. imitates our author, in a manner rather bold than just, Semifer aeria talis Centaurus ab ossâ Desilit in valles;—ipsum nemora alta tremiscunt Campus equum ? And, in the same book, Non aliter sylvas humeris, &amp; utroque refringens Pectore montano duplex Hylæus ab antro Præcipitat;—pavet Ossa vias, pecudesque feræque Procubuere metu. ? I cannot agree with F. Ursinus, that this comparison is drawn from Homer Iliad, B. ?. Virgil, says Catrou, by comparing Coras and Catillus with centaurs, would have us to understand, that they fought on horseback.So two fierce centaurs of the cloud-born race, Rush furious down the frozen hills of Thrace; The groves give way, the crackling woods resound, And trampled forests spread their ruins wide around. Next mighty Cæculus to battle flies, Who bade the tow'rs of proud Præneste rise: Found on the hearth, amid the glowing fire, The nations deem'd great Mulciber his sire. A host of warriors to the field he led, The hardy swains that fair Præneste bred, Or Gabii sent where Juno's temple rose; Ver. 873. Anio flows— Mr. Addison, in a pretty description, reconciles the two opposite representations which Silius Italicus and Horace have given us of this river. Horace terms it, præceps Anio—Silius describes it, Sulphureis gelidus quæ serpit leniter undis Ad genitorem Anio, labens sine murmure Tybrim. Mr. Addison's words are these: “This river first throws itself down a precipice, and falls by several cascades from one rock to another, till it gains the bottom of a valley; where it recovers its temper, as it were by little and little, and after many turns and windings at last glides peaceably into the Tyber.” See Addison's Travels. The waters of this river are remarkable for their coldness. It is now the Teverone.The troops who dwell where shining Anio flows. With those who drink old Amasenus' stream, Or from the walls of rich Anagnia came. Not all with arms are furnish'd for the war, Nor grasp the shield, nor whirl the rapid car. But most from slings a storm of bullets throw, And leaden deaths destroy the distant foe. Some in their hands two pointed javelins bore, And spoils of wolves for glitt'ring helmets wore; Ver. 882. The left foot bare—The people in those parts to this day wear a piece of crude leather (half prepared) under the soles of their feet, with vincula that come over their feet, and half-way up their legs. Holdsworth.The left foot bare, they boldly rush to fight, But a tough hide, unseason'd, sheaths the right. Next Neptune's son, the brave Messapus came, Exempt from steel, and sacred from the flame. To long neglected wars he fir'd his train, And urg'd his troops to shine in arms again. From the Flavinian and Fescennian coast, At his command advance th'embody'd host: Ver. 890. With the Faliscan—Æquosque Faliscos. The Romans received the jura fecilia from this people, and some additions to their twelve tables; hence Virgil, says Servius, styles them Æqui, just. Some read Æquosque, Faliscosque, supposing Æqui a distinct people.With the Faliscan band, who purest justice boast. Those who on high Soracte's tow'rs reside, Or dwell by Ciminus' expanded tide, Or o'er the rough aspiring mountain rove, Or haunt divine Feronia's shady grove: All march, embattled in array, and sing The martial glories of their godlike king. Ver. 897. So from the fishy floods—This simile, says Dr. Trapp, is most finely expressed; and is, in all respects, very good as a simile. But why a number of armed men, tho' they were singing, should be taken for birds rather than soldiers, I confess, I do not well understand. It were sufficient, one would think, that they should be so far like birds. Homer's simile taken from swans, Iliad 11. has another point of view, and is very beautiful. However this difficulty may be easily got over, if we suppose that Virgil alludes to their evenness of marching, ibant Æquati numero. Some of the ancients have imagined, that the embattling an army was first learned from the close manner of flight of these birds. So that in this simile we must suppose the noise to be but a secondary kind of likeness; order is primarily pointed at. See Pope's Il. B. 3. n. ver. 7. That by asia here is not meant the country so called, is certain, because of the quantity of the first syllable.So from the fishy floods, a snowy train Of swans embody'd wing th'aërial plain; Stretch their long necks o'er Asius' crystal spring, And the responsive shores and echoing waters ring. Not one, who heard the loud confus'd alarms, Had thought this noisy train a host in arms, But some huge cloud of clamorous fowls, who soar Among the cliffs, and scream around the shore. Lo! next brave Clausus leads his troops along; From the old Sabine race the warrior sprung: With a vast host, a host himself, he came, The first great father of the Claudian name; That spread thro' Latium, when, the line to grace, Rome shar'd her empire with the Sabine race. The ancient Cures march at his commands, And a large force from Amiternian lands, Ver. 913. Where full Velinus— Rosea rura Velini. The channel of this river lies very high, and is shaded on all sides by a green forest, made up of several kinds of trees, that preserve their verdure all the year. The neighbouring mountains are covered with them, and by reason of their height, are more exposed to the dews and drizzling rains, than any of the adjacent parts; which gives occasion to Virgil's rosea rura, dewy countries. Addison's Travels. But this writer was mistaken, as may be seen by the following curious observation. Where Mr. Addison, in his Travels, quotes Virgil's rosea rura Velini; he has made another mistake, besides the larger one of making the waterfall of Velini, the place whence Alecto descended into hell: he supposes rosea to be derived from ros; but there is no such derivative in the Latin tongue; the adjective from ros is roscidus: Rosea is a proper name of part of the country thereabouts. Varro had a villa there; and, in speaking of it, says, in meâ roseâ. Holdsworth.With those who dwell where full Velinus runs, Or where Nomentum boasts her martial sons, Or old Eretum stretch'd her utmost bound, And rich Mutusca smiles, with olives crown'd; Or where steep Tetrica's rough rocks arise, Or proud Severus tow'rs amid the skies. Where, with fair Foruli Casperia stands, And clear Himella floats the fruitful lands, Where gentle Fabaris serenely glides, Whose streams augment imperial Tyber's tides: Ver. 923. Beauteous Orta—In the original, Hortinæ classes, should be read Ortinæ, the bargemen of Orta; a town still as full of them, as Abingdon is with us.—The commentators say, it signifies troops; and the dictionary writers make classis signify a troop, on the authority of this single passage. Holdsworth.Where, near cold Nursia, beauteous Orta stood, And mournful Allia rolls her fatal flood. Thick shines with moving troops the blazing plain, Thick, as the billows on the stormy main; Thick as the ripen'd harvests are beheld, That nod, and wave along the golden field. The bucklers ring, the clashing arms resound; Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground. Then Agamemnon's son, Halesus came, By birth a foe to all the Trojan name: He yok'd his fiery coursers to the car, And with a thousand soldiers rush'd to war, From where on mountains live th'Auruntian line, Ver. 936. Massic hills—Famous for vines: in the kingdom of Naples. Cales is now called Calvi, in the neighbourhood of Capua. Vulturnus, now called Voltorno, runs by Capua. Oscan were likewise called Opici; were reckoned barbarous and stupid, and were a term of reproach; as the French say, a Limousin, for a heavy unpolished fellow.Where massic hills produce the generous wine: Warriors, who dwell along the roaring sea, Or from the walls of Cales took their way: With those who drink Vulturnus' shoaly flood, The rough Saticulan and Oscan stood. Short, pointed javelins, fasten'd by a string, With fatal force the dext'rous artists fling: Light shields of season'd hide aloft they bear, And, arm'd with bending swords, provoke the war. Nor thou, unsung, brave Oebalus! shalt pass, The nymph Sebethis' son, of Telo's race. While pleasing Capreæ own'd his father's sway, And the Teleboan realms his nod obey; The son, far more ambitious, stretch'd his reign O'er those rich towns, where Sarno bathes the plain. Now to the fight he leads his warlike pow'rs From ancient Batulum, and Rufa's tow'rs, From where, her blooming fruits Abella crown, And old Celenna spreads her spacious down. These, like the rough Teutonic warriors, threw Huge spears with barbs, that wing'd with slaughter flew. Light casques of cork around their heads they wore, And brazen swords, and brazen bucklers bore. Thee too, bold Ufens, to the dire alarms, Cold Nursia sent, a chief renown'd in arms. Her fierce rough sons thro' forests bound away, And o'er wild mountains chace the panting prey. In arms the natives turn the frozen soil, Make war a sport, and fly upon the spoil. Umbro, the brave Marrubian priest, was there, Sent by the Marsian monarch to the war. The smiling olive with her verdant boughs Shades his bright helmet, and adorns his Brows. His charms, in peace the furious serpent keep, And lull th'envenom'd viper's race to sleep; His healing hand allay'd the raging pain; And at his touch the poisons fled again. But yet he fail'd to cure, with all his art, The wound inflicted by the Trojan dart! Nor all his charms, nor potent herbs that grow On Marsian mountains, could prevent the blow! For thee, wide echoing sigh'd th'Angitian woods; For thee, in murmurs wept thy native floods! Next, brave Hippolytus! thy beauteous heir, The lovely Virbius mingled in the war. In the dark woods by fair Egeria bred, His troops the youth from old Aricia led: Where, on the shore, Diana's altar stood, (But now unstain'd with offer'd human blood;) Ver. 985 For when Hippolytus—See the noble description of the death of Hippolytus, as delivered by the messenger, in the Hippolytus Coron. of Euripides, ver. 1190 &amp; seq. This is imitated by Racine; but unhappily, and with a mixture of bombast.For when Hippolytus, as records tell By his fierce stepdame's arts and vengeance fell, Chas'd by his father's curses to the shore, The hapless youth the startled coursers tore; Ver. 989. By Æsculapius' skill, &amp;c.— Spenser who relates the fate of Hippolytus, Fairy Queen, B. 1. c. 5. §. 37. &amp;c. &amp;c. feigns that Æsculapius, when he was struck down to hell by Jupiter's lightening, for bringing Hippolytus to life, busied himself in healing his own wounds. The learned Mr. Jortin, in his remarks on Spenser, seems to think this a fine improvement upon the story. But unto hell Jupiter. did thrust him downe alive, With flashing thunderbolts ywounded sore Where long remaining, he did alwayes strive Himselfe with salves to health for to restore, And slake the heavenly fire which raged evermore. Stanza 40. Pindar has described in a very sublime manner Pyth. 3. the action of Jupiter dashing Æsculapius down.By Æsculapius' skill and Dian's care The chief reviv'd and breath'd etherial air. But Jove incens'd, a mortal to survey, From the Tartarean shades restor'd to day, Great Phœbus' son, the godlike artist, hurl'd, Transfixt with thunder, to the nether world: But Dian hid the youth in groves, and there Consign'd her darling to Egeria's care. There, in the forests, with the sacred dame He past his days, and Virbius was his name. For this, th'unhallow'd steed must still remove From Dian's fane and consecrated grove: Since the mad horses startled as they flew, And on the ground their mangled master threw. Yet his brave offspring drove the thund'ring car, And lash'd his fiery coursers to the war. Bold Turnus in the front, supremely tall, Sheath'd in refulgent arms, outshines them all: High on his helm a triple plume was rais'd, And on his crest the dire chimæra blaz'd: From her wide jaws the horrid fiend exspires A dreadful length of fires succeeding fires. When the loud voice of slaughter rends the skies, And the full horrors of the battle rise, Ver. 1013. She glows— This is, I think, one of the boldest fictions in Virgil; but so nobly animated that one must forgive the extravagance to which it seems to be carried. I cannot help observing the great judgment of Virgil in this particular; he adapts even the ornaments of the persons he introduces, to their manners and behaviour. The helmet here described was highly proper to be worn by a youthful hero, who hereafter breathes nothing but rage, indignation and revenge.She glows, she lightens, as the warrior turns; She flames with rage; and the whole monster burns. Chang'd to an heifer in the flowery field, The beauteous Iö charg'd the shining shield. Here stood her Argus. guard; and there her Iachus, a river god. father roll'd His swelling surges thro' the figur'd gold. Ver. 1019. A cloud of foot succeeds—Insequitur nimbus peditum, is evidently from Homer's ????? ?????? ?????. The figure in both poets is noble and elevated. Yet Virgil, says Dr. Trapp, justly could have render'd it nubes peditum, if he had pleased; but he thought the other a better sound, and a stronger image.A cloud of foot succeeds; a mighty train, With spears, and shields; and armies hide the plain. The pow'rs from Argive and Auruntian lands Mix'd with the ancient bold Sicanian bands. With painted shields the brave Labici came And Sacran forces to the field of fame: With those who till Numicus' fair abodes, Or dwell where Tyber views his rising woods: Or where the rough Rutulians turn the ground, And the steep hills of Circe stretch around: Where fair Feronia boasts her stately grove, Ver. 1030. And Anxur glories in her guardian Jove—Fulvius Ursinus observes, that the true reading is Jupiter axurus; for which he has the authority of a silver medal, representing Jupiter, with the inscription axurus. Ruæus mentions the same medal, but reads anxurus, from the city Anxur, rejecting the idle dream of Servius, &amp;c. who affirms, that there was a Jupiter particularly worshipped, as a boy, and without a beard ???? ?????; whereas in the coin he speaks of, Jupiter is represented with a very long beard; with the inscription, Jovis axur.And Anxur glories in her guardian Jove: Where stands the Pontine lake and o'er the plain, Cold Ufens' stream steals gently to the main. Ver. 1033. All sheath'd in brass—Florentes ære, flourishing with brass, instead of sheath'd. 'Tis a noble metaphor, but too strong to be preserved in English.Last with her martial troops, all sheath'd in brass, Camilla came, a queen of Volscian race. Nor were the web or loom the virgin's care, But arms and coursers, and the toils of war. She led the rapid race, and left behind, The flagging floods, and pinions of the wind: Lightly she flies along the level plain, Nor hurts the tender grass, nor bends the golden grain; Ver. 1041. Suspended sweeps— Several judicious critics think this hyperbole is carried a little too far; especially as no supernatural power is mentioned to salve the difficulty: [See note on ver. 1002. B. 11.] The picture that follows, of this female heroine is delicately finished and beautiful. Guido could not have given her a more graceful attitude. I cannot help quoting some beautiful lines from Apollonius Rhodius Argonaut. L. 1, 182. which, I believe, Virgil had in his eye, in describing Camilla's swiftness, speaking of Polypheme, a son of Neptune, ?????? ???? ??? ?????? ??? ???????? ??????? ????????, ???? ????? ?????? ?????, ???? ???? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ???????. The reader will excuse me for not translating these lines, as Virgil (and Mr. Pitt, after him) have done it so elegantly to my hands. The thought is originally drawn from Homer, Iliad B. 20. speaking of the mares of Ericthonius. ?? ???? ??? ???????? ??? ???????? ??????? ????? ?? ????????? ?????? ????, ???? ????????? ??? ??? ?? ???????? ?? ????? ???? ?????????, ????? ??? ???????? ???? ??????? ???????. These lightly skimming, when they swept the plain, Nor ply'd the grass, nor bent the tender grain, And when along the level seas they flew, Scarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew. Pope, 270. Segrais observes, that the poet, to soften the violence of this hyperbole, uses volaret, she could fly, instead of the imperfect volabat, she did fly. Mambrun, and Segrais, and Catrou, are all of opinion, that tho' a femal warrior be improper for the chief character of an epic poem, as the Pucelle of Chapelain; yet that such a character is beautiful, when introduced episodically, as the Penthisilea of Q. Calaber, and the Clorinda of Tasso.Or o'er the swelling surge suspended sweeps, Ver. 1042. And smoothly skims— These lines in the original are often produced as a striking instance of the sound's being an echo to the sense. Vida, in the 3d book of his poetics, has been very copious on this subject, and has produced many more examples of this beauty from Virgil. There is a celebrated passage on the same subject, in Mr. Pope's Essay on Criticism; which I shall give the reader at large, for the sake of some excellent observations that have been lately made upon it; Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows, And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows; But when loud surges lash the sounding shore, The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar: When Ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw, The line too labours, and the words move slow; Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain, Flies o'er th'unbending corn, and skims along the main. From these lines, laboured with great attention, and celebrated by a rival wit, may be judged what can be expected from the most diligent endeavours after this imagery of sound. The verse intended to represent the whisper of the vernal breeze, must surely be confessed not much to excel in softness or volubility; and the smooth stream, runs with a perpetual clash of jarring consonants. The noise and turbulence of the torrent, is indeed distinctly imaged; for it requires very little skill to make our language rough. But in the lines which mention the effort of Ajax, there is no particular heaviness or delay. The swiftness of Camilla is rather contrasted than exemplified. Why the verse should be lengthened to express speed, will not easily be discovered. In the dactyls, used for that purpose by the ancients, two short syllables were pronounced with such rapidity, as to be equal only to one long; they therefore naturally exhibit the act of passing through a long space in a short time. But the Alexandrine, by its pause in the midst, is a tardy and stately measure; and the word unbending, one of the most sluggish and slow which our language affords, cannot much accelerate its motion. The Rambler, N?. 92.And smoothly skims, unbath'd, along the deeps. From the dispeopled towns and fields repair Men, matrons, maids and youths, to view the fair: The crowds all gaze with transport, to survey Loose in the winds, her purple garments play, Her polish'd bow, her quiver's gaudy pride With arrows stor'd, and glittering at her side: Her shining javelin, wondering they behold, And her fair tresses bound with clasps of gold. The End of the Seventh Book. BOOK the Eihgth. Let the judicious reader weigh the following remark of M. Voltaire. It is a just criticism on Virgil, that the latter part of his poem is less animated than the first; not, that the last six books are entirely languishing, but their milder light is overpowered by the lustre of the others. That great defect is owing to the disposition of the poem, and to the nature of the things. The design of a match between Æneas and Lavinia, unknown and indifferent to each other, and a war raised about a stag wounded by a young boy, could not indeed command our concern, so much as the burning of Troy, and the love of Dido. 'Tis a great mistake to believe an author can soar, when the subject sinks. All the art he employs, shews only that he tills with labour and skill an ungrateful soil. If the natural chain of events in the Æneid, could have allowed Virgil to rise by degrees, in point of sentiment and grandeur; his poem had been as unexceptionable as the bounds of human talents will permit. In short, his fault lies in having reached to the utmost pitch of his art in the middle of his course. Voltaire's Essay on Epic Poetry, pag. 41. The ARGUMENT. The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes: Æneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander, and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Æneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. Now Turnus rous'd all Latium with alarms Ver. 2. To mount—Utque impulit arma. The commentators would make us believe, that Virgil here alludes to a custom of the Roman generals. They used to enter the temple of Mars, and after shaking the shields that were hung round the walls, they then shook the spear of the god himself, and cry'd out, Mars, vigila! But Catrou is of opinion, that Virgil here means simply, they struck their spears against their shields, by way of provoking each other to the fight. Miles feriens scuta, qui habitus iram concitat. Am. Marcel. l. 14. Milton has made a noble use of this hint, Paradise lost, Book 1. He said: and, to confirm his words, outflew Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs Of mighty cherubim; the sudden blaze Far round illumin'd hell; highly they rag'd Against the highest, and fierce with grasped arms Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war, Hurling defiance toward the vault of heaven.To mount the fiery steeds and fly to arms; Fixt on Laurentum's tow'rs, sublime in air, His standard wav'd, the signal of the war: And the loud trumpets, heard from far, excite The generous youth, and call them to the fight. Confederate pow'rs conspire, the war to wage; And the mad nations breathe revenge and rage. Their armies Ufens and Messapus guide, With proud Mezentius who the gods defy'd. From the suspended plough they drag the swains, And for the war dispeople all the plains. To Arpi next sage Venulus they sped To beg the aid of royal Diomed; And charge the hoary envoy to inform The martial monarch of the rising storm; That Troy's proud navy rides in Tyber's floods; Æneas here has fixt his vanquish'd gods; And vaunts himself the prince, ordain'd by fate To sway the scepter of th'Hesperian state; The nations own his cause, his right proclaim, And Latium echoes with his growing fame: That best himself could judge, who knew the foe, From such a war what dread effects may flow; What is his mighty aim, his proud intent; And, should he conquer, what the dire event, Was left for him to weigh; whose state and throne, And fortunes, stood endanger'd like their own. All this the Trojan chief beheld, opprest Ver. 30. With cares that roll'd— Magno curarum fluctuat æstu, is a very sublime and expressive metaphor. Thus Catullus, Prospicit &amp; magnis curarum fluctuat undis. And Lucretius, B. 4. Volvere curarum tristes in pectore fluctus.With cares that roll'd tumultuous in his breast. A thousand thoughts his wavering soul divide, That turns each way, and points to every side. Ver. 33. So from— This simile seems to be imitated from Apollonius Rhodius, Arg.

'Twas night—and, weary with the toils of day, In soft repose the whole creation lay; And last the Trojan prince, opprest with care On the dire prospect of th'approaching war, Sunk, and in balmy slumbers clos'd his eyes; His couch the bank; his canopy the skies. Ver. 45, &amp; seq. When slow—This appearance of Tyber (with some little additional refinement) has, through all succeeding ages, been an original pattern for all those poetical magicians, who are fond of framing spells for raising river-gods. Every one, at least, is sure to have an azure mantle, with a crown of reeds.When, slow-emerging thro' the poplar wood, Rose the majestic father of the flood, Tyber, the guardian god, in open view; A sea-green mantle round his shoulders flew; A wreath of reeds adorn'd his hoary head, And, to relieve his sorrows, thus he said: O long-expected on our blest abodes, Great chief, the true descendant of the gods! Whose conduct brings thy rescu'd Troy once more To rise immortal on our Latian shore; Proceed, and conquer, prince! nor yield to fear; Here lies thy fated home, thy Ilion here. Go!—meet the threat'ning war; thy cares are vain, The gods relent, and heav'n grows mild again. Nor think, an airy vision of the night, A transient empty dream deludes thy sight. Soon thou shalt view, beneath an oak reclin'd, A large white mother of the bristly kind, Ver. 63. With her white— Parere tot oportet porcos, quot mammas habeat. Si minùs pariat, fructuariam idoneam non esse; si plures pariat, esse portentum: in quo illud antiquissimum fuisse scribitur, quod sus Lavini Æneæ triginta porcos peperit albos. Itaque, quod portendent factum XXX annum ut Lavinenses condiderint oppidum Albam. Hujus suis &amp; porcorum etiam &amp; nunc vestigia apparent, &amp;c. Verro, de Re Rus. Hence it is plain, that Virgil inserts this story of the sow, as an ancient superstitious tradition. See note on ver. 143. B. 7. Juvenal alludes to this prodigy; ? Lætis Phrygibus mirabile sumen Et nunquam visis triginta clara mamillis. Sat. 13.With her white numerous brood of thirty young, Who drain her udders as she lies along. There, there, thy town, great heroe, shall ascend, There all thy labours, all thy woes shall end. Heav'n, by this sign, ordains thy royal son, When thirty years in full succession run, Shall build a Alba. city of distinguish'd fame, Which from this omen shall derive her name. But to succeed, pursue what I advise; Ver. 72. Go, make the Arcadian tribes—Arcadia is in the middle of Peloponnesus. [See note ver. 176. B. 8. and Eclog. 4, 58.] From hence came Evander being obliged to fly his country, according to Servius, for killing his father by mistake; or, according to Pausanias, in Arcadicis, he left Arcadia to plant a colony, and placed it upon a mountain near the Tyber, in a small town which he called Palantium, Palantéum, Palatium; which names are derived from Pallantium, a city of Arcadia; whence he came, according to Livy, and others; or from Pallas, an Arcadian king his ancestor, according to Virgil. His mother was named Nicostrata, who, on account of her gift of prophecy [see note ver. 358. B. 8.] was by the Romans called Carmentis. His father is generally allowed to be Mercury. Rome was built on the mountain, called mons Palatinus; and to this day, by the Italians, Monte Palatino. See Ruæus.Go, make th'Arcadian tribes thy firm allies. The race, that own'd of old great Pallas' sway, Hither beneath Evander bent their way; Then rais'd their walls on the tall mountain's crown; And Pallas' name adorn'd the rising town. But soon the Latian race in arms appear; And with the strangers wage a dreadful war. Go, join their forces, and their aid implore, And fear the gath'ring hostile train no more. Rise, son of Venus, rise, employ thy oars; Our self will guide thee to the friendly shores. Soon as the day shall dawn, thy gifts prepare, And vanquish heav'n's revengeful queen with pray'r. Crown'd with success, and all thy foes o'er-aw'd, Discharge to me the honours of a god, To me the sire of this immortal flood: For know, old Tyber stands before thine eyes, Ador'd on earth, and reverenc'd in the skies. I lead, in peaceful pomp, my humid train Along these banks, and bathe the fruitful plain: Ver. 92. And on our sides a city shall be seen Our glorious seat, the world's majestic queen.— This passage has given great trouble to the commentators, to explain it. Ruæus inserts a comma at domus, Hic mihi magna domus, celsis caput urbibus exit. And interprets it, this is my palace, my fountain rises near great cities: celsis urbibus, that is, says Servius. Tuscia, at that time in a very flourishing condition, and mistress of the greater part of Italy. But in his note on the line, Ruæus observes, that the future city of Rome is perhaps here hinted at; in which sense Dr. Trapp, De La Cerda, Segrais, Dryden, and L. Lauderdale, understand it. Dr. Trapp seems to think, that the making use of the present, for the future, it no considerable objection against this interpretation, especially in a prophetical or oracular sentence. And afterwards he adds, “I am clearly of opinion, that Virgil intended the sense I have rendered; yet, not excluding the other; and that he on purpose expressed it ambiguously, because it is prophetical and oracular, as I said before. That the other sense is not excluded, seems probable from what Æneas afterwards says, ver. 75. “Quocunque solo pulcherrimus exis.” But Tanaquil Faber, in his notes on Lucretius, seems to have given a solution to this difficulty, and to have explained the passage with great judgment. He observes, that the god Tyber in this line foretels the future grandeur of Rome; that consequently he must make use of the future tense, in delivering his prediction; and that the line should be read thus— Hic mihi magna domus celsis caput urbibus escit. seu essit, for erit, ????????; and that there is great beauty and propriety in putting an antique word into the mouth of this prophetical god; and that Virgil, who was so fond of the old expressions, could never have introduced one of them on a more suitable occasion. That escit is used for erit, he has the authority of Lucretius, lib. 1. 613. Ergo rerum inter summam minimamque quid escit. And Lambinus, in his note on this line, observes, that superescit is used for supererit, by Ennius— Dum quidem &amp; unus homo Romæ totæ superescit. I think we have sufficient reason, from the foregoing remark of Tanaquil Faber, to restore escit to the text of Virgil: Some ignorant transcriber, not knowing what to make of this old word, and seeing exis a few lines after, probably took a hint from thence to write exit. See Havercamp's Edition of Lucretius, 4?. Vol. 1. pag. 462.And on our sides a city shall be seen; Our glorious seat; the world's majestic queen! The god then plung'd beneath his oozy bed; And with the night the hero's slumber fled. He rose, and strait his joyful eyes survey The purple splendors of the dawning day; Then water in his palm devoutly took, Rais'd to the skies, and thus with transport spoke: Ye nymphs, Laurentian nymphs! from whose supplies And watry stores the swelling rivers rise; And thou, old Tyber! my propitious guide, Receive Æneas on thy sacred tide; From every ill defend him, as he goes, And look with pity on his endless woes. Then from whatever source thy streams survey The golden light, and murmuring spring to day; O thou, the greatest of the watry gods, Majestic prince of all th'Hesperian floods! Still to thy name due honours will I pay, And gifts unceasing on thy altars lay. But oh! be present with thy aid divine, Display, and then confirm the promis'd sign. Ver. 114. He said; then arm'd, &amp;c.— Æneas is not absent so long, as he generally seems to have been, when he went to get allies to assist him against Turnus. This expedition is as quick, as it was necessary. He goes from his camp near Ostia, about 15 miles up the Tyber, to Rome; thence 20 by land to Cerveterre; and thence to his camp again, about 35 by sea. He sets out (Æn. 8, 86.) by night, gets as far as Rome (ibid. 97.) about noon; and rests at Evander's (ibid. 369.) the next night. The second day he sets out for Cerveterre; comes in sight of Tarcon, and his army; and stops in the wood of Sylvanus for that night. (ibid. 456, 551, 608.) The third day (Æn. 10, 157.) he is with Tarcon; is join'd immediately by his troops; sets sail that afternoon, (ib. 147, 192, 214, and 216.) and continues sailing all the night. The fourth day in the morning (ib. 257, 260.) he comes in sight of his camp; lands (ver. 301.); and gets a victory over the enemy (ver. 908.) that evening. The two allies Virgil gives Æneas in his war against the Rutilians, are Evander and Tarcon; one, king of that part of the country where Rome was afterwards built; and the other, king of Hetruria; for the same reason that he speaks of Tuscany and Rome together, in so many other particular passages. And as he had a fondness for the place where he was born, he has shewed his address (ver. 203.) in annexing the Troops of Mantua to those of Tuscany, that his native country, which lay out of his line, might not lose the honour of having assisted in establishing Æneas on the throne; and consequently, in making way for the Cæsarean family, so many centuries after. Thus, by this single disposition, he has paid his compliments to Augustus, to Mecænas, and to his country. Holdsworth, and Spence.He said, then arm'd his Trojans, and supply'd Two barks with oars, to stem the yellow tide. When lo! the promis'd omen was display'd; The large white dam lay stretch'd along the shade, With all her snowy young, in open view; Ver. 119. To Juno slew—I could not, says Mr. Dryden, turn the word enim into English with any grace. Tho' it was of so much necessity in the Roman rites, that a sacrifice could not be performed without it. 'Tis of the same nature (if I may presume to name that sacred mystery) in our words of consecration at the altar. That enim was of any necessity in the Roman rites, never was observed, I believe, but by Mr. Dryden; who, if he had consulted Servius, would have learned that enim is redundant, and merely ornamental—vacat, &amp; tantum ad ornatum pertinet.Whom, with her brood, the prince to Juno slew. Now while the ships with equal strokes they row'd, Ver. 121. All night old Tyber— Mr. Spence observes, that there is something of the mixed metaphor (or rather mixed allegory) in this passage; and I know no occasion (continues he) in which the ancients are so apt to fall into it, or at least to border upon it, as when they are speaking of rivers or river-gods. Polymet. Dial. 20. not. 20. To this remark I shall beg leave to subjoin, that the moderns, as well as the ancients, are apt to fall into this mixed allegory; not only in speaking of rivers and river-gods, but in other subjects, where the deity presiding over, and the thing presided over, are confounded and put indiscriminately the one for the other. Thus, Thomson: Crown'd with the sickle and the wheaten sheaf, While Autumn. ? Thus far we have some idea of a personage representing the season Autumn crown'd with a sickle (which by the way is odd) and the wheat-sheaf. But what follows? ? Nodding o'er the yellow plain Comes jovial on. ? Here nodding, applied to the god Autumn, is plainly an epithet belonging to the corn, over which he presided. See the speech of Tellus, Ovid Metam. B. 2. which affords numberless instances of this absurd mixture.All night old Tyber calm'd his swelling flood. The slumbering streams no mingling murmurs make, Smooth, as the glassy level of the lake. With joyful shouts the sable gallies glide, Ver. 125. Easy and light— Ergo iter incæptum peragunt rumore secundo, Servius seems inclined to read rumone secundo, i. e. favente fluvio, an easy tide. The Tyber was called rumon, on account of the ficus ruminalis near the banks of it, under which the wolf gave suck to Romulus and Remus. This fig-tree was called ruminalis, a præbendo rumen, i. e. mammam. Plin. 15, 18. I think rumone a good reading, as the most easily construed; but Virgil undoubtedly wrote rumore secundo, in imitat Mox auferre domos populi rumore secundo, With prosperous omen, as Dr. Trapp very justly translates it. Upon this omen of the white sow, the soldiers had a current report, that the event would be prosperous. Fabricius observes, that rumore secundo was proverbially used among the ancients, to signify the good success of any business.Easy and light, along the floating tide. Surpriz'd, the forests and the floods beheld Bright arms and vessels on the watry field. All night, all day, they ply their busy oars Along the mazes of the winding shores, And gently move beneath the waving scene Of groves, that paint the checquer'd floods with green. Now had the sun's bright coursers whirl'd on high His fiery chariot to the mid-day sky:— When lo! the distant tow'rs the train descries; And walls and intermingled houses rise; Evander's homely state—where now appears Immortal Rome, advanc'd above the stars! Thither they turn the prow without delay, And to the city bend their eager way. Ver. 140. Before the town—There is something very engaging in the disposition of this scene. A sacrifice performed in a wood, by the king, the prince, and all the court. In the midst of so peaceful a solemnity, they are suddenly encountered with the sight of ships, and armed men just ready to land upon them. This is likewise a fine and natural introduction to the noble episode of Cacus; whose death was the occasion of the festival which they are now celebrating. Trapp.Before the town, within the gloomy woods, To great Alcides and the favouring gods, It chanc'd, that day, th'Arcadian monarch paid A solemn offering in the secret shade. Pallas his son, the rural senate round, And the chief youths the flaming altars crown'd: With fuming incense in their hands they stood, And the red pavement blush'd with sacred blood. Soon as they saw the ships in silence move, And shine between the openings of the grove; A sudden dread strikes cold thro' every breast; They start, they rise, and leave th'unfinish'd feast. Ver. 152. But Pallas— This is a fine opening to the character of Pallas. This young prince, who is afterwards to make so considerable a figure in the Æneid, is instantly alarmed at the hostile appearance of the ships, snatches up a javelin, and with great boldness and ready courage, demands the business of the Trojans. Any of the rest of the company might with almost equal propriety have made this demand; but Virgil very judiciously takes this opportunity of prepossessing our opinions in favour of this hero. The brevity of his address is admirable: Et procul e tumulo: Juvenes, quæ causa subegit Ignotas tentare vias? quò tenditis, inquit? Qui genus? unde domo? pacemne huc fertis, an arma. The epithet of Pallas in this place is audax, which Servius observes, Virgil always makes use of when he represents a man brave, but unfortunate. Thus, audacem ad Turnum, Book 7.But Pallas bids the guests the rite pursue, Then snatch'd a javelin, and impetuous flew— Resolve me, stranger, (from a point he calls,) Who, whence you are, and why approach our walls? What urg'd your voyage to these shores, declare? Speak, speak your business—bring you peace or war? High on the stern the Trojan heroe stands, And held a branch of olive in his hands. Behold, he cries, the far-fam'd sons of Troy; These swords against the Latians we employ; The perjur'd Latians; whose unjust alarms Force us to fly to great Evander's arms. Go, tell your king, the Dardan chiefs appear, And beg his potent succour in the war. Ver. 166. Whoe'er thou art—Virgil attributes a high degree of civility and complaisance towards a stranger, to Pallas. There is something which discovers a most humane disposition in those words, Egredere o quicunque es. Taubmannus rightly observes, that the modesty of Pallas on this occasion is remarkable; who, like a youth of ingenuous birth and breeding, refers Æneas to his father for an answer. See Scalig. B. 3. c. 19 de moribus.Whoe'er thou art, approach, he cries with joy, (All fir'd to hear the glorious name of Troy;) To my great father be thy suit addrest, And grace our mansions as a friend and guest. Ver. 170. Prince his hand—Tacitus tells us, that it was the custom of princes, when they would strike a league, to join their right hands, and as it were to bind and squeeze their fingers together. Pollices inter se vincire, &amp; nodo constringere.With that he gave the Dardan prince his hand, And led the godlike heroe from the strand: Then to the sacred grove their way they took; And thus the Trojan to the monarch spoke: Best of the Greeks! to whom devoid of fear, Constrain'd by fate, these types of peace I bear. Ver. 176. Tho' from Arcadia's hostile bounds—The Arcadians belonged to Greece, whose cities (which were generally independent) were united by one common tye, like the Swiss Cantons, which compose the Helvetic body. So that the Arcadians, as a people of Greece, were enemies to the Trojans.Tho' from Arcadia's hostile bounds you came, Ally'd to both the kings of Atreus' name, Yet hither did thy fame my steps incline, My own fixt choice, heav'n's oracles divine; And the mixt glories of our kindred line. For know we both from mighty Atlas trace, Who props th'etherial spheres, our ancient race. Our father Dardanus, a glorious name, From his fam'd daughter, fair Electra, came. His beauteous Maia, on Cyllene's height, Disclos'd your sire, great Mercury, to light. Thus from that common source divided run Our sacred lines, as first they met in one. Rais'd by these hopes all caution I disown, And sent no envoys to address thy throne, But came, unguarded, fearless, and alone. Our Daunian foes, with equal rage, destroy Your suff'ring subjects and the sons of Troy; And hope, if they expel the Dardan train, From sea to sea to propagate their reign. Then in a league let either nation join, For know, our Trojans are a martial line, Valiant and bold, and season'd to alarms, True to their leagues, and exercis'd in arms! Thus he—the monarch roll'd his eager eyes O'er his majestic form, and thus replies: On all thy features how I dwell with joy: Welcome, thrice welcome, glorious prince of Troy! How in thy face, my ancient friend I see! Anchises looks, and lives, and speaks in thee! Well I recall great Priam's stately port, When once he sought his Hesione. royal sister's court On Salaminian shores, with all his train; And took his way thro' our Arcadian plain. Then, but a youth, I gaz'd the strangers o'er, And much admir'd the chiefs, their monarch more; But most Anchises; for, supremely tall, Thy graceful godlike sire outshin'd them all. Eager I long'd in friendship's sacred bands To hold the chief, and join our plighted hands, Led him to Pheneus' ancient walls, carest Th'illustrious prince, and claim'd him for my guest. On me, at parting, generous he bestow'd Two golden bridles, that refulgent glow'd, (A glorious present by my son possest,) With a rich quiver and embroider'd vest. The peace you ask, we give; our friendship plight, And, soon as morn reveals the purple light, Ver. 224. With our confederate troops—The action of the Æneid (says Catrou) is simple, like that of the Iliad. Both those poems end without a peripetie, or at least without a remembrance. But that which Virgil omitted in the recital of his general action, he has given us in an accessory incident. He feigns that Æneas is recognis'd by Evander, and this produces a new situation in the affairs of the Trojans. He affords him an ally, who procures him a second alliance with the Etruscans. Upon the whole, this remembrance is made in a manner the least affected in the world. The adventure which brought Evander hither, and the ancient friendship between him and Anchises, have a certain heroic Naivete, which is very pleasing. Nevertheless the mind is still kept in suspence, concerning the issue of this interview between Æneas and Evander. The one is an Arcadian, [see note on ver. 176. B. 8.] and consequently an enemy of the Trojans. We are sollicitous to know how Æneas will bring himself off. I only wish that the success of this voyage of Æneas, had not been previously related by the god of the Tyber. The surprize would have been much greater, and the marvellous more strongly displayed.With our confederate troops, a martial train, Safe I'll dismiss thee from these walls again. Now, since as friends you honour our abode, Ver. 227. Assist, and pay—Sacra—quæ differe nefas. It was a very lucky circumstance for Virgil, that the ancients were under an indispensable obligation of continuing the sacrifice, when they had once begun. By this means the poet finds an opportunity of introducing the praises of Hercules, and the noble episode of Cacus, without any inconsistency. See the commentators, concerning the Piaculum; and note, ver. 2. B. 11.Assist, and pay due offerings to the god. With us pursue the solemn annual feasts, And from this hour commence our constant guests. He said; the bowls replac'd in open view, The joyful train the holy rites renew; The hoary king dispos'd his guests around, And plac'd the Trojans on the verdant ground. But for their prince an ample couch was spread; A lion's spoils adorn'd the rural bed. Now brought the chosen youths and priests again The sacred banquet to the stranger train; Dispens'd from canisters the bread around, And with the foaming wine the goblets crown'd: The Dardan prince and every Trojan guest, Reclin'd at ease, partake the solemn feast. But when the rage of craving hunger fled, Thus to the chief the hoary monarch said: 'Tis not for nought we pay these rites divine To great Alcides' ever-honour'd shrine; Our worship springs from gratitude sincere, Not heady zeal, nor superstitious fear: Nor are our tribes by blind devotion aw'd; But, sav'd by Hercules, adore the god. For lo! in air yon' hanging rock behold! See heaps on heaps, on ruins ruins roll'd! See yon huge cavern, yawning-wide around! Where still the shatter'd mountain spreads the ground. Ver. 254. Grim Cacus—This celebrated episode is not entirely fictitious. Livy and Dionysius Halicarnasseus relate the story, (I mean the bare circumstances) as we find it in our poet. Catrou remarks, that all the beauties requisite to form a complete narrative, are here united. In the hands of an Italian poet, says he, this episode would have made one entire canto; but here no circumstance is drawn out beyond its due bounds. The spirit with which the combat between Hercules and Cacus is told, is beyond imitation: it is so grand, that one would be almost inclinable to think the poet has offended against nature, in putting such sublime terms into the mouth of the old Evander, whose imagination is supposed to be more rude and uncultivated.—But this last remark is most affectedly refined; for it is well known by readers of ancient history, that Evander possessed the talent of eloquence in so eminent a degree, that he was deemed the son of Mercury. Besides, we are not to suppose that Evander was unable to relate any grand subject with dignity, because he was situated among wild rocks and woods. Catrou subjoins, that Virgil generally reserves the beauties of versification for his episodes: These are, as it were, the refreshments of the reader, and the poet should give them all the graces of his art.—Upon the whole, this episode is a part of the Æneid, which, taken by itself, will appear entirely finished; and Virgil certainly gave it his last hand. Thus, in Shakespeare, we frequently find particular scenes worked up to the highest pitch of perfection, (con amore, as the Italians say) and absolutely complete; when the whole play, perhaps, is incorrect in general.That spacious hold, grim Cacus once possest, Tremendous fiend! half human, half a beast! Deep, deep as hell, the dismal dungeon lay, Dark and impervious to the beams of day. With copious slaughter smoak'd the purple floor; Pale heads hung horrid on the lofty door, Dreadful to view! and dropp'd with crimson gore. The fiend from Vulcan sprung; and, like his sire, The mighty monster breath'd a storm of fire. So fierce he rag'd; till time at length bestow'd The presence, aid, and vengeance of a god. For now Alcides left the realms of Spain, Proud of the spoils of huge Geryon slain. To these fair shores the bellowing droves he led; Along the banks and flow'ry vales they fed. The fiend resolves to bear the prize away By fraud or force; and meditates the prey. Four beauteous heifers, four fair bulls he took, Inclos'd and lodg'd them in the gloomy rock; But by their tails the struggling prey he drew, And thought to puzzle the deluded view. The turning tracks, inverted, where they tread, Back from the monster's darksome cavern led. Mean time the mighty drove the heroe leads To fresher pastures, and untrampled meads. The parting herds spread wide, and roar around; Fields, woods and hills, rebellow to the sound. When lo! a heifer heard her love complain, And roar'd responsive from the cave again; From vault to vault the sound in thunder flew, And the detected fraud appear'd in view. Alcides seiz'd his arms, inflam'd with ire, Rage in his looks, and all his soul on fire; Fierce in his hands the pond'rous club he shook, And, mad for vengeance, mounts th'aërial rock. Then, first appall'd the monster we descry, Death in his cheek, and horror in his eye. Ver. 291. Swift—It is but common justice to observe, that the translator hath kept up the fire and energy that fill the original, in the animated description of this combat.Swift as the wind, with terror wing'd, he fled, And in the gloomy cavern plung'd his head. The pond'rous rock, impenetrably strong, On solid hinges by his father hung, To guard the dreadful dungeon, down he drew: The shatter'd chains and bursting barriers flew. Scarce had the fiend let down th'enormous weight, When fierce the god came thund'ring to the gate. He gnash'd his teeth with rage, the passes try'd, And roll'd his eager eyes on every side; Now here, now there, a fiery glance he threw, Ver. 302. Round the mountain—Aventini montem, says the original. How greatly the Romans must have been delighted with this story, as the scene of it lies on a spot they every day beheld!And thrice, impetuous, round the mountain flew; Thrice strove to storm the massy gates in vain; And thrice, o'erspent, sat panting on the plain. A pointed rock behind the cavern stood, That to the left frown'd dreadful o'er the flood, Black, rough, and vast; a pile of wond'rous height, A solemn haunt for every bird of night. This, from the right, the god incumbent shook; Fierce from the solid base he heav'd the rock. Then push'd convulsive with a frightful peal, The smoaking steep rolls thund'ring down the vale. To the loud din, earth, air and heav'n reply; The banks start wide; and back the surges fly. Expos'd to sight the monster's dungeon lay, And the huge cave flew open to the day. Ver. 317. So, if the bolts—Madam Dacier and Mr. Pope seem to be mistaken, in imagining this simile is copied from Homer. The Greek poet is speaking of the agitation all nature was in, while the gods took the field. Among the rest of the confusion, Pluto is represented leaping from his throne, and afraid, lest Neptune (the shaker of the earth, []????????) should open the ground, and discover the regions of darkness. Dr. Trapp observes, that Pluto trembled, and even then, it was not because the earth was opened, but for fear it should be. But he no where makes use of this image for a simile, as Virgil does; and the application is excellent. In fact, here is only one piece of a verse translated from Homer, Diis invisa is plainly Homer's ????????? ???? ???, a very immaterial circumstance in both poets: and by this it appears, that Ruæus and others, are wrong in rendering invisa by inaspecta, never seen by the gods, for, hated by the gods.So, if the bolts of Jove should burst the ground, And opening earth disclose the vast profound, The solemn secrets of the dark abodes, Hell's dreadful regions, dreadful ev'n to gods; Full on the black abyss the beams would play, And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day: As pale (his dungeon storm'd) with wild affright, Glares the dire fiend, surpriz'd in open light. He roars aloud, while thund'ring from above, Full on the foe the furious heroe drove. With every vengeful instrument in view, Whole trunks of trees and broken rocks he threw. Now round the cavern, in despair of flight, Th'enormous monster breathes a sudden night; To blind or blast his mighty foe, expires Thick clouds of smoke, and all his father's fires. With that, the vengeful god in fury grew, And headlong thro' the burning tempest flew. Fierce on the fiend, thro' stifling fumes he came, Thro' streams of smoke and deluges of flame; There, while in vain he breath'd the fires around, His trembling prize the great Alcides found; Limb lock'd in limb, from earth his feet he rends, And on the ground his monstrous bulk extends; Strangled the struggling foe with matchless might, And from their caverns tore the balls of sight. Thus the huge fiend, exhausted, breathless, tir'd, Loud bellowing, in th'Herculean grasp expir'd. The god then burst the gates; and open lie The den's vast depths, all naked to the sky. Th'expanded caves dismiss th'imprison'd prey, From the black darksome dungeon to the day. Forth by the feet the crowds the monster drew; Ver. 350. On his huge size— Thus Belphæbe, after having killed the salvage man, Spenser's Fairy Queen, B. 4. c. 7. §. 32. Yet over him she there long gazing stood, And oft admir'd his monstrous shape, and oft His mighty limbes, whilst all with filthy blood The place, there overflowne, seem'd like a sudden flood.On his huge size they feast their eager view; His shaggy limbs, his dreadful eyes admire, And gaping throat, that breath'd infernal fire. From that blest hour th'Arcadian tribes bestow'd These solemn honours on their guardian god. Potitius first, his gratitude to prove, Ador'd Alcides in the shady grove; And, with the old Pinarian sacred line, Ver. 358. These altars rais'd—Aram—quæ maxima semper. Livy, B. 1. thus relates Evander's address to Hercules. “Jove nate Hercules salve! te mihi mater, veridica interpres deûm, aucturum cœlestium numerum cecinit, tibique aram dicatam iri, quam opulentissima olim in terris gens maximam vocet, tuoque ritu colat.” Dexterâ, Hercules, datâ, accipere se omen, impleturumque fata, arâ conditâ atque dicatâ, ait. “Hail Hercules, son of Jove! my mother, a true interpreter of heavenly things, has predicted that you will increase the number of the gods, and that an altar will be dedicated to you; which, in future times, the most potent nation upon earth shall call maxima, [greatest] and serve with your own rites.” Hercules, joining hands, answered, he received the omen, and would fulfil the prophecy by building and consecrating an altar. Ovid. Fast. 1, 585. tells us, that this altar stood in the Forum Boarium.These altars rais'd, and paid the rites divine, Rites, which our sons for ever shall maintain; And ever sacred shall the grove remain. Come then, with us to great Alcides pray, And crown your heads, and solemnize the day. Invoke our common god with hymns divine, And from the goblet pour the generous wine. He said, and with the poplar's sacred boughs, Like great Alcides, binds his hoary brows; Rais'd the crown'd goblet high, in open view: With him, the guests the holy rite pursue, And on the board the rich libation threw. Now from before the rising shades of night, Roll'd down the steep of heav'n, the beamy light. Clad in the fleecy spoils of sheep, proceed The holy priests; Potitius at their head. With flaming brands and offerings, march the train, And bid the hallow'd altars blaze again; With care the copious viands they dispose; And for their guests a second banquet rose. Ver. 378. The Salii dance—The Salii were instituted by Numa. They were twelve in number, and born of Patrician families. Their number was doubled by Tullus Hostilius. They danced in armour to the music of pipes, shaking a small kind of shield called ancile: their name is derived a saliendo. Tho' the Salii were instituted long after Evander's time, yet Virgil has not scrupled to introduce them; vim nominis (says Ruæus) non rationem temporis spectavit. See note ver. 765. B. 7. and Macrob. Sat. B. 3. cap. ult.The fires curl high; the Salii dance around To sacred strains, with shady poplars crown'd. The quires of old and young, in lofty lays, Resound great Hercules' immortal praise. Ver. 382. How first his infant hands—For an account of the labours of Hercules, see Ruæus's note on ver. 288. in the original; or rather, Mr. Spence's Polymetis, Dial. 9. Book 3.How first, his infant hands the snakes o'erthrew, That Juno sent; and the dire monsters slew. What mighty cities next his arms destroy, Th'Oechalian walls, and stately tow'rs of Troy. The thousand labours of the hero's hands, Enjoin'd by proud Eurystheus' stern commands, Ver. 388. Thy matchless might— This transition from the third person to the second, and from a mere relation to a panegyrical address, is very artful. Milton, in his evening hymn, has finely imitated this; Mr. Addison seems not aware that it was borrowed from our poet: Thus at their shady lodge arriv'd, both stood, Both turn'd, and under open sky, ador'd The God that made both sky, air, earth and heav'n, Which they beheld; the moon's resplendent globe, And starry pole:—Thou also mad'st the night, Maker omnipotent! and thou the day! Parad lost, B. 4. 1720. There is likewise a judicious copy of this way of speaking, B. 3. ver. 55. of Leonidas, in the hymn which the Persians sing to Oromasdes— ? If the hand Of Oromasdes on precarious life Shed wealth and pleasure, soon th'infernal god With wild excess or avarice blasts the joy. Thou, Oromasdes, victory dost give. By thee with fame the regal head is crown'd.And Jove's revengeful queen. Thy matchless might O'ercame the cloud-born Centaurs in the fight; Hylæus, Pholus sunk beneath thy feet, And the grim bull, whose rage dispeopled Crete. Beneath thy arm the Nemean monster fell; Thy arm with terror fill'd the realms of hell; Ev'n hell's grim porter shook with dire dismay, Shrunk back, and trembled o'er his mangled prey. No shapes of danger could thy soul affright; Nor huge Typhœus, towering to the fight, Nor Lerna's fiend thy courage could confound, With all her hundred heads, that hiss'd around. Hail mighty chief, advanc'd to heav'n's abodes! Hail son of Jove; a god among the gods! Be present to the vows thy suppliants pay, And with a smile these grateful rites survey. Thus they—but Cacus' cavern crowns the strain, Where the grim monster breath'd his flames in vain. To the glad song, the vales, the woods rebound, The lofty hills reply, and echo to the sound. The sacred rites complete, the numerous train Back to the city bend their course again. Trembling with age, slow moves the monarch on, Between the heroe and his blooming son. They pass with pleasure the remains of day In various converse, that beguiles the way. Around th'illustrious stranger darts his sight, And views each place with wonder and delight: Curious each ancient monument surveys, And asks of every work of ancient days, Half sunk in ruins, and by age o'ercome— When thus, the founder of majestic Rome: Know, mighty prince, these venerable woods, Ver. 421. Of old—Livy tells all this story in the same manner, L. 1, 7. Virgil is exact throughout, and follows the historians or tradition closely.Of old, were haunted by the Sylvan gods, Ver. 422. A rugged race, &amp;c.—It was a practice (says Eustathius) among the heathen, to expose those children which they would not, or could not educate. The places where they deposited them, were generally caverns, or hollow oaks. These children being frequently found, and preserved by strangers, were said to be the offspring of those trees or rocks where they were found. Hence the poet's fable, that men were born of oaks, &amp;c.And savage tribes; a rugged race who took Their birth primæval from the stubborn oak. No laws, no manners form'd the barbarous race; But wild, the natives rov'd from place to place; Untaught and rough, improvident of gain, They heap'd no wealth, nor turn'd the fruitful plain. Their food, the savage fruits the forests yield, Or hunted game, the fortune of the field. Till Saturn fled before victorious Jove, Driv'n down and banish'd from the realms above. He by just laws embody'd all the train, Who roam'd the hills, and drew them to the plain; There fixt; and Latium call'd the new abode, Whose friendly shores conceal'd the latent god. These realms in peace the monarch long controll'd, And blest the nations with an age of gold. A second age succeeds, but darker far, Dimm'd by the lust of gain, and rage of war. Then the Sicanians and Ausonians came, And Saturn's realm alternate chang'd her name. Successive tyrants rul'd the Latian plain; Then stern, huge Tybris held his cruel reign. The mighty flood that bathes the fruitful coast, Receiv'd his name, and Albula was lost. I came the last, thro' stormy oceans driv'n From my own kingdom by the hand of heav'n. My mother goddess and Apollo bore My course at length to this auspicious shore. Ver. 450. The gate and altar shews—Either the ara maxima of Hercules, spoken of above, or the altar of Carmentis near the gate called by her name, under the mons Capitolinus; in which last sense our translator understands it.This said, the prince the gate and altar shows, That to his parent, great Carmenta, rose; Whose voice foretold, the sons of Troy should crown With everlasting fame the rising town. Ver. 454. Here Pan—A place in the Palatine mount, where the Arcadians under Evander consecrated a temple to Pan, god of Arcadia. An annual festival in honour of Pan was here celebrated by young men who ran naked, with whips made of goat-skins, striking every one they met; more particularly women; who thought these strokes contributed to give them an easy delivery. They were called Luperci.Here, Pan, beneath the rocks thy temple stood; There, the renown'd asylum, in the wood. Ver. 456. Now points the monarch—'Tis a great fault in descriptive poetry, to describe every thing. The good ancients (but when I nam'd them, I meant Virgil) have no long descriptions: commonly not above ten lines, and scarce ever thirty. One of the longest in Virgil is, when Æneas is with Evander; and that is frequently broke by what Evander says. Mr. Pope.Now points the monarch, where, by vengeful steel, Ver. 457. His murder'd guest—Nemus Argileti, Varro thinks this place was called Argiletum ab argillosâ hujus loci terrâ, from the nature of the soil, which was clay; or from Argus, who Fabius Pictor tells us, was the guest of Evander. The commentators in general agree, that Argus was murder'd, without the knowledge of Evander, by the Arcadians; from a suspicion of his aspiring to the throne. Evander buried him in this place, with great pomp; and here, Virgil says, Evander testatur locum, that is (says Ruæus) he, as it were witnesses, or swears on the spot of ground, that he was not guilty of violating the laws of hospitality by his death.His murder'd guest, poor, hapless Argus fell! Ver. 458. Next to the capitol— There were two Capitolium's at Rome. The former of these was built by Tarquinius Priscus, near the place where the Barbarini palace now stands, and was called Capitolium Vetus; the other by the second Tarquin, on the hill which was thence called the Capitoline hill. Mr. Pope. Nothing was ever more sublimely conceived than this image! The mountain on which in ages to come the Capitol was to be built, was even now, while in its original desolate state, filled with religious horror, and supposed by the wild Arcadians to be the residence of some deity; they imagined they had seen even Jupiter himself descending upon it in storms and clouds, shaking his black ægis. Dr. Trapp observes, that the heathen religion was, in a great measure, a corrupt imitation of the Jewish. Thus the god had already chosen this place for his residence; like that of the holy scriptures; “Ye shall serve God upon this mountain,” Exod. iii. 12. And, in another place, “The Lord has chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself; he has longed for her. This shall be my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein,” Psalm cxxxii. 13. It is to be remembered, that the Romans imagined Jupiter to be present in the capitol, as fully and in as much glory as in the highest heavens. Plin. Paneg. sub init.Next, to the Capitol their course they hold, Then roof'd with reeds, but blazing now with gold. Ev'n then her awful sanctity appear'd; The swains the local majesty rever'd. All pale with sacred horror, they survey'd The solemn mountain and the reverend shade. Some god, the monarch said, some latent god Dwells in that gloom, and haunts the frowning wood. Oft our Arcadians deem, their wondering eyes Have seen great Jove, dread sovereign of the skies; High o'er their heads, the god his ægis held, Ver. 469. And blacken'd heaven with clouds— The poet chuses to describe the appearance of Jupiter in all the majesty of clouds and darkness. ? Cum sæpe nigrantem Ægida, &amp;c. ? May I take the liberty of adding here, that the same sort of idea is used more strongly by the great poet of our own nation? ? How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark, doth heav'n's all-ruling sire Chuse to reside, his glory unobscur'd? And with the majesty of darkness round Covers his throne. ? Parad. lost. 2. ver. 268. And that it is expressed in the greatest dignity of all, in the Holy Scripture? There are numerous instances of this kind; but I shall mention only two of them. Moses's account of the presence of God, on mount Horeb; where he says, “That the mountain burnt with fire unto the midst of heaven; with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.” Deuter. iv. 11. And that most sublime description of the Psalmist; “The earth trembled and quaked; the very foundations of the hills shook, and were removed.—There went a smoke out of his presence, and a consuming fire out of his mouth.—He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and it was darkness under his feet. He rode upon the Cherubims, and did fly: He came flying upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion, round about him; with dark water, and thick clouds, to cover him.” Psalm xviii. 7, 11. —Indeed the idea of darkness in itself is exceedingly fit for majesty: perhaps even more so than the glare of light, which most people are so apt to make their heaven of. There is scarce any thing of a more solemn and venerable turn, than the profound stillness of midnight; and this probably, was yet more striking to the Heathens of old; for they (besides what they felt from nature as well as we) used to look upon darkness as one of the most ancient, and most respectable, of all their deities. Spence's Polymet. B. 6. D. 13. pag. 212.And blacken'd heaven with clouds, and shook th'immortal shield! In ruins there, two mighty towns, behold, Rais'd by our sires; huge monuments of old! Janus' and Saturn's name they proudly bore, Their two great founders!—but are now no more! Thus they converst on works of ancient fame, Till to the monarch's humble courts they came; Ver. 476. There oxen stalk'd— It was certainly a very pleasing contemplation among the Romans to look back upon their original; to compare the magnificence of Rome, with the rural and unadorned state of things which formerly appeared on the very spot where it was built. No less than two poets besides Virgil, in the Augustan age, have made this comparison, Tibullus, El. 5. L. 2. Sed tunc pascebant herbosa palatia vaccæ Et stabant humiles in Jovis arce casæ. Lacte madens illic fuberat Pan ilicis umbræ Et facta agresti lignea falce Pales At quà Volabræ regio patet, ire solebat Exiguâ pulsus per vada linter aquâ, &amp;c. See also Propertius, Lib. 4. El. 4. and Lib. 4. El. 1.There oxen stalk'd, where palaces are rais'd, And bellowing herds in the proud Forum graz'd. Ver. 478. Lo! said the good old king—I fear there are some readers of such false delicacy, as to be disgusted with the simplicity and plainness of Evander, and his court. But let us be ingenuous (to use the words of a fine writer) and confess, that while the moderns admire nothing but pomp, and can think nothing great or beautiful, but what is the produce of wealth, they exclude themselves from the pleasantest and most natural images that adorned the old poetry. State and form disguise man; and wealth and luxury disguise nature. Their effects in writing are answerable; a lord-mayor's shew, or grand procession of any kind, is not very delicious reading, if described minutely and at length; and great ceremony is at least equally tiresome in a poem, as in ordinary conversation. The Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer, pag. 25.Lo! said the good old king, this poor abode Receiv'd great Hercules, the victor god! Ver. 480. Thou too, as nobly— Never was a nobler welcome into any palace, than this. The simplicity, and, at the same time the sublimity of this sentiment of Evander, admirably verifies an observation of Scaliger: Neque enim in mole frequentiâque orationis, sed in caslitate atque frugalitate magnitudo constat. Poetic. Lib. 5 c. 2. Virgil, says the amiable Fenelon, who had a full view of all the Roman magnificence, has yet given a beauty to king Evander's poverty, and made it an ornament to his poem.—The shameful corruption of our manners hinders us from raising our views, to admire the genuine sublimity of these words: Aude, hospes, contemnere opes ? Archbishop of Cambray on poetry. Letter to the French Academy, pag. 319.Thou too, as nobly, raise thy soul above All pomps, and emulate the seed of Jove. With that the hero's hands the monarch prest, And to the mansion led his godlike guest. There on a bear's rough spoils his limbs he laid, And swelling foliage heap'd the homely bed. Ver. 486. Now awful—The poet, with infinite art, takes this opportunity of filling up the vacancy of night and sleep, by introducing Venus applying to Vulcan for a shield for her son, together with his formation of it. By this artifice, the business transacted between Æneas and Evander is related with less interruption and embarassment, neither is there any time lost or taken up in relating what passes between Venus and Vulcan, with his compliance, and execution of her request.Now awful night her solemn darkness brings, And stretches o'er the world her dusky wings; When Venus, (trembling at the dire alarms Of hostile Latium, and her sons in arms,) In those still moments, thus to Vulcan said, Reclin'd and leaning on the golden bed; (Her thrilling words her melting consort move, And every accent fans the flames of love;) When cruel Greece and unrelenting fate Conspir'd to sink in dust the Trojan state, As Ilion's doom was seal'd, I ne'er implor'd, In those long wars, the labours of my lord; Nor urg'd my dear, dear consort to impart, For a lost empire, his immortal art; Tho' Priam's royal offspring claim'd my care, Tho' much I sorrow'd for my godlike heir. Now as the chief, by Jove's supreme command, Has reach'd at length the destin'd Latian land; To thee, my guardian pow'r, for aid I run; A goddess begs; a mother for her son. Oh! guard the heroe from these dire alarms, Forge, for the chief, impenetrable arms. See, what proud cities every hand employ, To arm new hosts against the sons of Troy; On me and all my people, from afar See what assembled nations pour to war! Yet not in vain her sorrows Thetis shed, Nor the fair Aurora. partner of Tithonus' bed, When they implor'd my lord of old to grace With arms immortal an inferior race. Hear then, nor let thy queen in vain implore The gift, those goddesses obtain'd before. This said; her arms, that match the winter snows, Around her unresolving lord she throws; Ver. 520. More rapid than the lightning flies— Spenser, Fairy Queen, B. 6. c. 7. has finely copied this short simile. Glaunc'd swiftly by—like to that heavenly sparke, Which glyding through the aire, lights all the heavens darke. Stanza 17.When lo! more rapid than the lightning flies, That gilds with momentary beams the skies, The thrilling flames of love, without controul, Flew thro' the sooty god, and fir'd his soul. With conscious joy her conquest she descry'd; When, by her charms subdu'd, her lord reply'd: Why all these reasons urg'd, my mind to move; When such your beauties, and so fierce my love! Long since, at your request, my ready care, In Troy's fam'd fields, had arm'd your son for war. Nor did the high decrees of Jove and fate Doom to so swift a fall the Dardan state; But, ten years more, old Priam might enjoy Th'imperial scepter, and the throne of Troy. Yet, if our queen is bent the war to wage, Her sacred cause shall all our art engage. Ver. 536. The noblest arms— Æneas, as well as Achilles, has arms of a cœlestial make, and temperament. One of the great tenets of the old poets is, that “Man can do nothing without the gods assisting or impelling him:” And they carry this so far, as to attribute such an action of a man to such a deity, as in the case of Palinurus, B. 5, 860. But this was not imagined by them to lessen the guilt of the man in bad actions, or draw any thing from his glory in good ones. All power of action was supplied from the gods; but the manner of acting, and the choice of it, was in the man's own determination. In judging of the ancients, we should go by the ideas which prevailed among them; and not those, which prevail now. The emperor Aurelian, in his letter to the senate, giving an account of a victory obtained by him over his enemies, mentions the assistance of his gods towards it, as a credit to him, rather than a discredit. Neque enim indecorum est diis juvantibus vincere; sic apud majores nostros multa finita sunt bella, multa sunt cæpta. Vopiscus, cap. 23. And in those honorary columns erected at Rome, in memory of the victories of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, the gods are represented as assisting them to gain these victories. Spence.The noblest arms our potent skill can frame, With breathing bellows or the forming flame, Or polish'd steel, refulgent to behold, Or mingled metals, damask'd o'er with gold, Shall grace the chief: thy anxious fears give o'er, And doubt thy interest in my love no more. He spoke; and, fir'd with transport by her charms, Ver. 543. Clasp'd the fair goddess in his eager arms— The decency of Virgil on this occasion, is remarkable and worthy imitation. A. Gellius thus speaks of the passage, B. 9. cap. 10. Annianus poeta, &amp; plerique cum eo ejusdem musæ viri summis assiduisque laudibus hos Virgilii versus ferebant: quibus Volcanum &amp; Venerem junctos mixtosque jure conjugii rem lege naturæ operiendam verecundâ quâdam translatione verborum, quum ostenderet demonstraretque protexit. Optatos dedit amplexus, &amp;c. &amp;c. Minùs autem difficile arbitrabantur in istiusmodi re dicendâ, verbis uti uno atque altero brevi tenuique eam signo demonstrantibus.—Tot verò, &amp; tam evidentibus, &amp; tam non prætextatis, sed puris honestisque verbis, venerandum illud concubii secretum neminem quemquam alium dixisse. It will not be impertinent to add, that Milton has preserved an equal degree of decency, on a like occasion. Parad. lost, B. 4. 740. Montagne thinks this passage of Virgil full of obscenity. See Essay on some verses of Virgil, Vol. 2.Clasp'd the fair goddess in his eager arms; Then pleas'd, and panting on her bosom lay, Sunk in repose, and all dissolv'd away! But rose refresh'd, impatient from the bed, When half the silent hours of night were fled: Ver. 548. What time—Fulvius Ursinus is mistaken, in saying this simile is copied from Apollonius Rhodius, Book 3. ver. 291. There is something very pleasing in such a comparison, taken from common life.What time the poor laborious frugal dame, Who plies the distaff, stirs the dying flame; Employs her handmaids by the winking light, And lengthens out their task with half the night; Thus to her children she divides the bread, And guards the honours of her homely bed: So to his task, before the dawn, retires From soft repose the father of the fires. Amid th'Hesperian and Sicilian flood All black with smoke, a rocky Hiera. island stood, The dark Vulcanian land, the region of the god. Here the grim Cyclops ply, in vaults profound, The huge Æolian forge, that thunders round. Th'eternal anvils ring, the dungeon o'er; From side to side the fiery caverns roar. Loud groans the mass beneath their ponderous blows; Fierce burns the flame, and the full furnace glows. To this dark region, from the bright abode, With speed impetuous flew the fiery god. Th'alternate blows the brawny brethren deal; Thick burst the sparkles from the tortur'd steel. Huge strokes, rough Steropes and Brontes gave, And strong Pyracmon shook the gloomy cave. Before their sovereign came, the cyclops strove With eager speed, to forge a bolt for Jove, Such as by heaven's almighty lord are hurl'd, All charg'd with vengeance, on a guilty world. Beneath their hands, tremendous to survey! Half rough, half form'd, the dreadful engine lay: Three points of rain; three forks of hail conspire; Three arm'd with wind; and three were barb'd with fire. The mass they temper'd thick with livid rays, Ver. 580. Fear, wrath— I cannot forbear transcribing a very elegant parody of this passage, from a beautiful burlesque poem, entitled, the School-mistress, [see Dodsley's Miscel. vol. 1.] speaking of the rod [Stanza 6.] the author has these lines: And in her hand, for sceptre, she does wield Tway birchen sprags; with anxious fear entwin'd, With dark distrust, and sad repentance fill'd; And stedfast hate, and sharp affliction join'd, And fury uncontroul'd, and chastisement unkind. This composition of Virgil's is partly natural, and partly poetical. The natural ingredients of it, are clouds, wind, fire, rain, and hail; for his imber tortus seems to signify the same, as durus imber does in Columella. (De cultu hort. ver. 329 &amp; 330.) The word tres, so often repeated in it, may have some relation to the epithets trifidium and trisulcum, so often given to fulmen by the poets, and so very well agreeing with the figures of it, in most antiques; as the epithet of alitis, may have some reference to the wings given to it, in some of them. The poetical ingredients were, fear, wrath, and terror. Polymetis, Dial. 6. p. 55.Fear, wrath and terror, and the lightning's blaze. With equal speed, a second train prepare The rapid chariot for the god of war; The thund'ring wheels and axles, that excite The madding nations to the rage of fight. Some, in a fringe, the burnish'd serpents roll'd Ver. 586. Round the dread ægis— Homer thus describes this terrible shield, Il. B. 5. speaking of Minerva, ???? ? ?? ??????? ????? ?????? ????????????? ? ?????, ?? ???? ??? ????? ????? ??????????, ?? ? ????, ?? ?? ???? ?? ?? ???????? ????? ?? ?? ?? ??????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ????? ??, ?????????, ???? ????? ?????????. O'er her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield, Dire black, tremendous! round the margin roll'd A fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold: Here all the terrors of grim war appear, Here rages Force, here trembles Flight and Fear, Here storm'd Contention, and here Fury frown'd, And the dire orb portentous Gorgon crown'd. Pope, 911. This description is much fuller and more picturesque, than that of our author. But it is to be remember'd, that Homer makes use of this shield in the action of his poem; whereas in Virgil it is only occasionally mentioned, as part of the work which some of Vulcan's assistants were forging at this time; so that a slight and transitory sketch of it was sufficient.Round the dread ægis, bright with scales of gold; The horrid ægis, great Minerva's shield, When, in her wrath, she takes the fatal field. All charg'd with curling snakes the boss they rais'd, And the grim Gorgon's head tremendous blaz'd. In agonizing pains the monster frown'd, And roll'd, in death, her fiery eyes around. Ver. 593. Throw, throw your tasks—The poet in this place artfully dignifies his hero, and marks out his importance. The lightning of Jupiter, the chariot of Mars, the ægis of Minerva, are all laid aside for the shield of Æneas. The instruments of the most powerful deities are instantly deserted, and left unfinished, that a mortal hero may be furnished with armour. This is an artifice of Virgil, tending to the true sublime; and in this respect the Greek poet, Iliad 18. is infinitely surpassed by the Roman.Throw, throw your tasks aside, the sovereign said; Arms for a godlike hero must be made. Fly to the work before the dawn of day; Your speed, your strength, and all your skill display! Swift as the word, (his orders to pursue,) To the black labours of the forge they flew; Vast heaps of steel in the deep furnace roll'd, And bubbling streams of brass, and floods of melted gold. The brethren first a glorious shield prepare, Capacious of the whole Rutulian war. Some, orb in orb, the blazing buckler frame; Some with huge bellows rouze the roaring flame: Some in the stream the hissing metals drown'd; From vault to vault the thund'ring strokes rebound, And the deep caves rebellow to the sound. Exact in time each ponderous hammer plays; In time their arms the giant brethren raise, And turn the glowing mass a thousand ways. These cares employ the father of the fires: Mean time Evander from his couch retires, Ver. 613. Call'd by, &amp;c.— There is a beautiful simplicity in these lines, as well as in the thing described. Fulvius Ursinus insists upon it, that the matutini volucrum cantus, means the swallow; and quotes an ode from Anacreon, where the poet complains of being wak'd from a pleasing dream by the unseasonable cries of this bird. But this is descending to particulars, without reason. We are certainly to understand by volucrum cantus, the singing of birds in general, as our translator understands it. ? The shrill matin chant Of birds on every bough ? As our first father was awaken'd. Milton, Par. lost, B. 5. ver. 7.Call'd by the purple beams of morn away, And tuneful birds, that hail'd the dawning day. First the warm tunic round his limbs he threw; Next on his feet the shining sandals drew. Around his shoulders flow'd the panther's hide, And the bright sword hung glittering at his side. Ver. 619. Two mighty dogs— It was customary for princes and heroes of old, to be attended with dogs. Thus Telemachus, Odyss. B. 2. ??? ????, ??? ???? ??? ????? ????? ??????. “He did not go out alone, but was followed by two domestic dogs.” And Syphax, in Livy, Syphax inter duas canes fians, Scipionem appellavit. Syphax standing between two dogs, addrest Scipio. Iliad, B. 23. Achilles is described with nine large dogs at his board. Poetry, says Dacier, is like painting, which draws the greatest beauties from the simplest customs: and even in history, we receive a sensible pleasure from the least circumstance that denotes the customs of ancient times. It may be added, that the poet, as well as the painter, is obliged to follow the customs of the age, of which he writes or paints. A modern dress would ill become Achilles or Ulysses; such a conduct would be condemned as an absurdity in painting, and ought to be so in poetry. To blame the ancient poets for copying nature faithfully, (says Fenelon) is to find fault with M. Mignard and M. Rigault, for drawing exact pictures. Ought Momus to be drawn like Jupiter? Silenus like Apollo? Alecto like Venus, &amp;c.? Must our present court be painted with the ruffs and beards used in former reigns?—Archbishop of Cambray's letter to the French Academy, pag. 317.Two mighty dogs, domestic at his board, (A faithful guard,) attend their aged lord. The promis'd aid revolving in his breast, The careful monarch sought his godlike guest, Who with Achates rose at dawn of day, And join'd the king and Pallas on the way. Their friendly hands exchang'd, their seats they took Amid the hall; and first Evander spoke: Great prince, the guardian of the Trojan state! Who, safe in thee, defies the frowns of fate; Small is our force, and slender our relief; Far, far unworthy such a glorious chief. For here, old Tyber bounds our lands; and there The stern Rutulians gird our walls with war; Yet to our court kind fortune led thy way; And mighty aids the willing fates display; By me whole nations, in thy cause ally'd, Whole hosts in arms shall gather to thy side. For near these walls, amid the Tuscan lands, Seated on rocks, proud Agyllina stands, Rais'd by the Lydian train, sublime in air, A martial race, and terrible in war. For ages flourish'd this distinguish'd town; Vast was her wealth, and glorious her renown; Till stern Mezentius made her sons obey His lawless arms, and arbitrary sway. Ver. 645. What tongue—The abhorrence which this good old king expresses for the cruelties of Mezentius is extremely natural, and they are artfully mentioned by the poet to raise our hatred of his barbarous character, which makes a fine contrast to Evander's.What tongue can such barbarities record, Or count the slaughters of his ruthless sword? Give him, ye gods! if justice you regard, Give him, and all his race, the due reward! 'Twas not enough, the good, the guiltless bled; Still worse;—he bound the living to the dead. These, limb to limb, and face to face he join'd, (Oh! monstrous crime of unexampled kind!) Till choak'd with stench the lingring wretches lay, And in the loath'd embraces dy'd away. At length, their patience tir'd, his subjects rose, Besiege the tyrant, and his walls inclose, Subdue his guards, destroy his friends, and aim Full at the regal towers the vengeful flame; While for defence to Turnus he withdrew, And safe, thro' all the cloud of slaughter, flew. But arm'd by just revenge, the Tuscan band To death the royal fugitive demand. Ver. 663. At once Etruria— Etruria anciently had two kings; the seat of one of them was as Cæris, or Cervetere; and of the other at Coritum, or Cortona. There were twelve chief cities in Etruria: the deputies from each of which met, to elect these kings. Their establishment had an air of freedom. In Æneas's time, Mezentius was the king, at Cæris; and Tarchon, at Cortona. Hence Silius Italicus, L. 8. 474. seems to comprehend under the names of these two cities, all Etruria. Lectos Cære viros, lectos Cortona superbi Tarchontis domus ? Where, by the way, superbus seems to be used in a good sense (as it is often in the Latin, populum latè regem, belloque superbum, Æn. 1. 21. of the Trojans; and superbæ virtute &amp; factis animæ, S. Ital. 10. 573. and the languages derived from it,) because Tarchon assisted in helping Æneas to the throne; and consequently towards the establishing of the Cæsars. This alliance of Æneas and Tarchon is pointed out by Virgil so early as in the third book of the Æneid: where his great gods tell him, “That Crete is not the place he is to fix at: no; he is to go on for Italy, and Cortona.” —Coritum, terrasque require Ausonias, Æn. 3. 171. Spence.At once Etruria fires her martial train, And all her sons embattled spread the plain. By me dispos'd, shall march these mighty hosts Beneath thy conduct, from their native coasts. For now, ev'n now their fleets have reach'd the land, And the tall ships are rang'd along the strand; They wait the signal, for the fight prepare; But thus a sage retards the moving war: ‘Ye chosen martial train, the glorious grace ‘And flower of all our old Mæonian race. ‘Tho', by just rage inspir'd, your hosts are led ‘To pour full vengeance on your tyrant's head, ‘No Latian chief these armies must command; ‘Chuse some brave general from a foreign land.’ With that, their forces stop'd in these abodes, Struck with this awful warning of the gods. To me, their chief bold Tarchon sent, before, The crown, and every type of regal pow'r; Me they request to lead their armies on, Accept the sway, and fill the vacant throne. But for these silver hairs 'tis far too late To mix in battles, or the cares of state; Vain were the thoughts, so great a war to wage; Too rough the task for unperforming age: My son had led them, but his race withstood; Born half a native by the mother's blood. But thou, great prince, whose years and godlike line Stand well approv'd by every pow'r divine, Go thou; the high imperial task sustain; Go; to sure conquest lead the vengeful train: And let my Pallas by thy side engage, Pallas, the joy of my declining age. Beneath so great a master's forming care, Let the dear youth learn every work of war; In every field thy matchless toils admire, And emulate thy deeds, and catch the glorious fire! Beneath his standard rang'd, a chosen force I send, two hundred brave Arcadian horse; And, to support the gathering war, my son Shall lead an equal squadron of his own. He said; the prince and friend, in cares profound, Long fixt their eyes with anguish on the ground, Sad, and dejected at the short supply; Till Venus gave a signal from the sky; Ver. 707. Swift from the opening heavens with awful sound, &amp;c.— Mr. Dryden in this place, without any authority from Virgil, represents Venus as thundering: But his bright mother from an opening cloud To chear her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud. ver. 692. Tho' it is true, says Mr. Spence, that the augurs of old did sometimes attribute the power of casting forth lightnings to all the twelve great gods (in an inferior sense, to what was attributed by them to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva,) yet I do not imagine, that Virgil here speaks of Venus's casting forth the lightning: and much less, of her thundering. The passage indeed, is difficult; so difficult, that most of the commentators quite pass it by. But if they had of old in Italy, that phænomenon which we call the aurora borealis, and you were to view this passage in that light, it might perhaps be easy enough. That darting brightness; the rushing of the heavens; even the hearing of strange noises, and the fancied appearance of arms; I remember, were all things talked of, on the appearance of the extraordinary phænomenon of this kind, in all our northern parts of Europe in the year 1716. Polymet. Dial. 20. n. 25. To this remark I shall beg leave to add, that these phænomena are a fine preparative and introduction to the presenting the armor, and those who are shocked at their being præternatural, are to remember that they are brought about by a goddess. The thought of Venus shewing her son the armor, as it were from heaven, and shaking it among the clouds, is most sublimely conceived, and occasions that noble speech of Æneas, which is as fine a piece of poetical enthusiasm as any thing in our author. Upon the whole it will be necessary to observe, that tho' intonat, and tonare, are here made use of, yet it cannot be inferred from either of them, that it thundered. The iterum fragor intonat ingens, implies, that the noise was loudly repeated; but if the word intonat seem to some critics, who are fond of literal meanings, to signify actual thunder, I shall take this opportunity of informing them, that no less than fourteen approved copies read increpat; and among the rest the Vatican, and that valuable one of the Medici. The pulsa tonare, means the clashing of the armor; and in this place Pierius tells us, that some very old books read sonare. Servius, after a very peremptory manner, explains the cum sonitu venit—tonitrús scilicet, and adds, that the poet with his usual exactness, makes the lightning precede the thunder. But I refer it to the impartial reader, whether we are obliged by the vibratus ab æthere fulgor, to understand precisely the natural phænomenon of lightening.Swift from the opening heavens, with awful sound, A sudden splendor broke, and blaz'd around. A rolling general din they heard from far; And the loud Tyrrhene trumpets rend the air. While thus, amaz'd, they gaze with wondering eyes, Peal after peal runs rattling round the skies. At last bright clashing arms the train behold, That flush the skies, and fringe the clouds with gold. But soon Æneas knew the loud alarms, The promis'd present of immortal arms. To me alone, my royal friend, he cries, This sign belongs, an omen from the skies. My mother promis'd these portents in air, On the first opening of the wasteful war. To me she brings, thro' yon' etherial road, Those glorious arms, the labour of a god! Oh! what a gathering storm of slaughter spreads On yonder hosts, and blackens o'er their heads! How shalt thou, Turnus, my full rage deplore! How shall thy waves, old Tyber, smoke with gore, When all thy streams, incumber'd with the slain, Roll shields, and helms, and heroes to the main! Now let the perjur'd train their arms prepare; Since 'tis their wish, I'll give a loose to war! He said; and from the sylvan throne retires; Then on Alcides' altar wakes the fires. Glad he returns, the offering to renew, And to the houshold gods the victims slew. To the same rites return, with equal joy, The hoary monarch and the youths of Troy. Then to the ships he bends his course again, There culls the flower of all the warrior train, To wait him to the field; the rest he sends With the glad tidings to his son and friends. Smooth o'er the waves the painted vessels glide, And with the stream move gently down the tide. Steeds are prepar'd to mount the Trojan train, And speed their progress to the Tuscan plain. But to their prince a courser was assign'd, Of matchless spirit and superior kind. The bounding steed a lion's spoils infold, With paws dependent, sheath'd in shining gold. Strait thro' the city flies the loud report Of troops advancing to the Tuscan court. The shrieking matrons weary heav'n with pray'r; Near and more near they view, in wild despair, The horrid image of gigantic war. The good old monarch then embrac'd his son, And with a flood of tender tears begun: Ver. 756. Oh would almighty Jove—This speech has two parts; and both of exquisite beauty. In the former, this old king, at seeing Æneas and his son with the troops going forth to battle, is filled with the heroic ideas of his youth; and wishes he was now equal to those brave exploits which he had formerly atchieved. In the latter, he turns the discourse to his son, and assures him, that tho' opprest with age and misfortunes, he will be content still to live, so that his dear Pallas returns safe. But how pathetically does the poet prepare the incident of Pallas's death, by making Evander afterwards suppose the other alternative, and in the midst of this supposition representing him as fainting away, and carried off by the attendants! How much this last circumstance would shine on the stage, need not be insisted on.Oh! would almighty Jove once more renew That vigorous strength of youth, which once I knew; When, by this hand, beneath her rocky wall, Præneste saw her vanquish'd armies fall; When, victor of the field, and crown'd with fame, With piles of hostile shields, I fed the flame, Ver. 762. Great Herilus—Herilus king of Præneste opposed the coming of Evander into Italy. Evander slew him and his followers, and burnt their shields, Servius imagines, that the poet alludes to Tarquinius Priscus burning the shields of the Sabines, as an offering to Vulcan.And sent great Herilus, of matchless might, Their martial monarch, to the shades of night; On whom, descended from celestial blood, Three lives his goddess Feronia. mother had bestow'd. Wondrous to tell! the warrior thrice was slain, As oft reviv'd, and arm'd, and fought again. Thrice, tho' renew'd for fight, the monarch bled, And thrice, of all his arms I stripp'd the dead. Such were I now—not all these dire alarms, Dangers, or deaths, should tear me from thy arms: Nor had Mezentius thus his slaughters spread, Thus heap'd with wrongs thy father's aged head; Nor thus unpunish'd stretch'd his rage abhorr'd O'er towns, dispeopled by his wasteful sword. But hear, ye gods! and heaven's great ruler, hear, With due regard, a king's and father's pray'r! My dear, dear Pallas, if the fates ordain Safe to return, and bless these eyes again: With age, pain, sickness, this one blessing give; On this condition I'll endure to live. But oh! if fortune has decreed his doom, Now, now, by death, prevent my woes to come; Now, while my hopes and fears uncertain flow; Now, e'er she lifts her hand to strike the blow; While in these feeble arms I strain the boy, My sole delight, my last surviving joy! E'er the sad news of his untimely doom Must bow this hoary head with sorrow to the tomb! Ver. 790. With these last—The pause in the original at the first word in the line, vulneret:—judiciously represents the king's stopping short, and fainting away.With these last words he swoon'd, and sunk away: His servants to the couch their breathless lord convey. Now thro' the opening gates the warriors ride, Æneas first, Achates by his side. The Trojan chiefs succeed: amid the train Young Pallas towers, conspicuous o'er the plain. All bright his military purple flow'd; His polish'd arms with golden splendors glow'd. So, bath'd in ocean, with a vivid ray Flames the refulgent star, that leads the day: Wide thro' the sky, before the sacred light Break, and disperse the scattering shades of night. High on the battlements the mothers stand, And, from the towers, survey the martial band. Thro' the thick woods, embody'd in array, The glittering squadrons take the nearest way. Loud shouts arise; the thundering coursers bound Thro' clouds of dust, and paw the trembling ground. A mighty grove, rever'd for ages stood Ver. 809. Where Cære views— Livy styles this city, Sacrarium populi Romani, diversorium sacerdotum, ac receptaculum sacrorum, L. 1. Virgil here makes an elegant poetical use of the religious character of the place, in describing a venerable grove of firrs, which stood near it. In the Old Testament frequent mention is made of consecrated groves among the followers of idolatry. Thus, 2 Chron. xxiv. 18. ‘And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served groves and idols.’ And, 2 Chron. xiv. 3. ‘He brake down the images, and cut down the groves.’ The Jewish law forbad the planting groves near God's altar, as a part of the Pagan superstition. Deuteron. xiv. 21. ‘Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the Lord thy God, which thou shalt make thee.’Where Cære views with pride her rolling flood: Hills clad with firr, to guard the hallow'd bound, Rose in the majesty of darkness round. In times of old, the pious Argive train, The first possessors of the Latian plain, To the great Sylvanus. guardian of the fields, had made For ever sacred, the devoted shade, And, on his solemn day, their annual offerings paid. Not far from hence the Tuscan host dispread Their mighty camp, with Tarchon at their head. From the tall towering point in full survey, Stretch'd o'er the vale, th'embattled army lay. Hither Æneas, with his band, succeeds; The train refresh'd release the panting steeds. Mean time his beauteous mother, from on high, Had brought the blazing present down the sky. By the cool stream the heroe she survey'd Within the winding vale, and thus she said: Behold the promis'd arms; in every part By Vulcan labour'd with immortal art. Now dare thy foes, collected in thy might, Now call the haughty Turnus to the fight. Then the fair queen her joyful son embrac'd, And, by an oak, the radiant burthen plac'd. Ver. 833. The wondering— When Jason brings the golden fleece from the grove to the ship, in Apollonius Rhodius, Book 3. the Argonauts gaze on it with infinite surprize and delight; every one takes a pride in handling it, and turning it round. Virgil seems here to have had that beautiful passage in his eye. Thus Sir Tristram, in Spenser's Fairy Queen, Book 6. Canto 2. Stanza 39. But Tristram then despoyling that dead knight Of all those goodly ornaments of praise, Long fed his greedy eyes with the fair sight Of the bright metall, shining like sunne rayes; Handling and turning them a thousand wayes.The wondering chief with sudden rapture glow'd, Struck with the glorious labours of the god. Astonish'd at the blazing arms he stands, And, one by one, he pois'd 'em in his hands. The sword, with death all pointed, he admires, And the proud helm, that shoots a length of fires. The mighty corslet cast a vivid ray; With scales of brass and sanguine colours gay; And, like a flaming cloud, refulgent shone, Pierc'd with the glancing glories of the sun. The polish'd greaves his manly thighs infold, With mingled metals wrought and ductile gold. With joy the weighty spear the prince beheld; But most admir'd the huge mysterious shield; For there had Vulcan, skill'd in times to come, Display'd the triumphs of immortal Rome; There all the Julian line the god had wrought, And charg'd the gold with battles yet unfought. Here in a verdant cave's embow'ring shade, Ver. 852. The fostering wolf— Virgil, says Servius, was careful to express the particular attitude, which we see in statues of this wolf. Mr. Spence, in his Polymetis, observes, that she is often to be seen in this attitude, in gems and relievo's. The poet is obliged to Ennius for the ? Gemineique huic ubera circum Ludunt pendentes pueri ? Annal. L. 1. The tereti cervice reflexum, is Tully's, De Nat. D. L. 2. 42.The fostering wolf and martial Romulus and Remus. twins were laid; Th'indulgent mother, half reclin'd along, While at her dugs the sportive infants hung, Look'd fondly back, and form'd 'em with her tongue. Next Rome appear'd; here shriek the Sabine dames, Surpriz'd, and ravish'd at her solemn games. In arms the Cures with their king appear, And wage with infant Rome a sudden war. At length agreed, from fight the monarchs cease, And, at the shrine of Jove, conclude the peace. Each king beside the bleeding victim stands, With lifted eyes, a goblet in his hands. Here the mad coursers flew the forest o'er, And, limb from limb, the perjur'd Metius tore. As vengeful Tullus drags him thro' the wood, The sculptur'd trees are all bedrop'd with blood. Here proud Porsenna, with his martial train, Bids Rome receive her banish'd Tarquinius Superbus. king again. Her noble sons, surrounded with alarms, Fly, in the cause of liberty, to arms. While glorious Cocles all his host withstood, And Clœlia broke her chains, and swam the flood, With furious looks, tremendous to behold, The raging monarch frown'd, and storm'd in gold. There, for the capitol, brave Manlius strove, Fought like a god, and look'd a second Jove. There stood thy palace, Romulus, (decreed Ver. 879. Roof'd with homely reed— The regia, or palace here mentioned, cannot be understood of the capitol, which, when it was besieged by the Gauls, was a magnificent building; and that a thatch'd covering, and golden (or gilded) portico's are most absurdly inconsistent, is obvious. The commentators in general understand, that regia specifies the original palace of Romulus thatch'd with straw, and preserved in the capitol as a relick. De La Cerda observes, that this house was from time to time repaired by the Romans, whence it is here called recens. In these days of luxury, we can scarce conceive any such thing, as a thatch'd house to have been a palace; or of great men and princes having no other beds than a heap of straw: and yet the latter was not so far from our times, as we may be apt to imagine.—Thus Camden, in speaking of Edburton, (a little village near Ailesbury, in Buckinghamshire) says, that it was a manor-royal; and that several yardlands were given to it by the king, on condition, “That the holders thereof, should find litter, that is straw, for the king's bed, whenever he should come hither,” [Britan. p. 280. Ed. 1695] Ramus, in speaking of the reformation of the university of Paris, mentions the following allowance there, pro tapetis &amp; stramine quodlibetariæ, triginta solidi. In cardinali pro tapetis &amp; stramine triginta solidi. There is a street in part of the university of Paris, now called La Ruë de Fouarre; and formerly called La Ruë de Fourrage; where the straw-market was kept formerly, to supply the students with fresh litter. Menage's Dict. vol. 1. Fourrage. Their schools were littered with straw too, when they held their Quodlibets, or any other great disputations. 'Twas so in Dante's time, according to Naudé. [Add. a l'Hist. de Louis XI. p. 175.]—Hence when Rablais makes his Pantagruel dispute against all comers, he makes him hold his disputations in the Ruë du Fouarre: De faict, par tous les carrefours de la ville mist conclusions, en nombre de neuf mille, sept cens, soixante &amp; quatre, en tout sçavoir; touchant en icelles les plus fortes doubtes, qui fussent en toutes sciencès: et premierement en la Rue de Feurre tint contre touts les Regents, Artiens, &amp; Orateurs; &amp; les mist tous de cul. (Liv. 2. chap. 10.) Where his commentator says; Les accula tous, &amp; les obligea a se rasseoir sur leur Paille. [note 3.] The word litter probably comes from the French word for a bed, lit: The French still generally use a pallaisé, or strawbed, under their feather-beds. Spence.The seat of empire,) roof'd with homely reed. Ver. 880. Here fled the silver goose thro' courts of gold— The antithesis of auratis and argenteus at first sight may appear inconsistent with the simplicity of Virgil; but we are to remember, that he is describing a piece of art, in which the portico's were represented in gold, and the geese (agreeable to their natural colour) in silver. Thus afterwards (ver. 905.) the ocean is represented in gold, and the dolphins in silver. Servius observes, that the poet in the epithet argenteus, alludes to a silver goose, which was kept in the capitol, in memory of its being preserved by the noise of these birds.Here fled the silver goose thro' courts of gold, And, cackling loud, th'approaching Gauls foretold. Thro' the thick forest move the hostile pow'rs, And, favour'd by the night, invade the tow'rs. Fair golden tresses grace the comely train, And every warrior wears a golden chain. Embroider'd vests their snowy limbs infold; And their rich robes are all adorn'd with gold. Two Alpine spears with martial pride they wield, And guard their bodies with an ample shield. The Salii next in solemn garbs advance; And naked here the mad Luperci dance. The pledge of future empire from the sky, The sacred targe strikes dazzling on the eye. In stately cars the pious matrons rode, Who sav'd their country, and appeas'd the god. Far hence remov'd, appear the realms below, The horrid mansions of eternal woe; Where howl the damn'd; where Cataline in chains Roars from the dark abyss, in endless pains; Sees the grim furies all around him spread, And the black rock still trembling o'er his head. But in a separate space the just remain; And awful Cato rules the godlike train. Full in the midst, majestically roll'd The solemn ocean wrought in figur'd gold: But hoary waves curl high on every side, And silver dolphins cut the sable tide. Amid the flood, two navies rose to sight With beaks of brass; th'immortal Actian fight! Ver. 910. Boiling billows—Fervere, says the original. The critics tell us, that Virgil uses fervere short, that the sound may agree more with the sense of the word; whereas his true reason was, his imitating the practice of the ancients, who, as we learn from Quintilian, used fervo, and ferveo, indifferently. Many of these old words in Virgil, have probably been altered by the transcribers. Pictai vestis, &amp; aquai, Virgilius amantissimus vetusiatis carminibus inseruit. Quintil. Inst. Or. L. 1. Polymetis, pag. 21.All charg'd with war the boiling billows roll'd, And the vast ocean flam'd with arms of gold. Here leads divine Augustus, thro' the floods The sons of Rome, her fathers and her gods: From his high stern the martial scene surveys, While streaming splendors round his temples blaze; His sparkling eyes a keener glory shed, Than his great father's star, that glitters o'er his head. Next, with kind gales, the care of every god, Agrippa leads his squadron thro' the flood. A naval crown adorns the warrior's brows, And fierce he pours amid th'embattled foes. There brings proud Antony his various bands From distant nations, and from barbarous lands. Dispeopled Egypt fills the watry plain, And the whole Eastern world o'erspreads the main. But O!—the curse of Rome, the shame of war, His Cleopatra. Pharian consort follows in the rear! Rush the fierce fleets to fight! beneath their oars And clashing beaks, the foaming ocean roars! All big with war the floating castles ride, In bulk enormous, o'er the yielding tide; The frothy surge like moving mountains sweep; Or isles unrooted, rolling round the deep. Spears, darts and flames fly furious o'er the main; The fields of Neptune take a crimson stain. The beauteous queen, amidst the dire alarms, With her loud timbrels calls her hosts to arms, Ver. 938. Nor heeds the snakes—The commentators in general understand simply, by necdum etiam, &amp;c. she did not perceive her death approaching. As she was to die by the bite of asps, says Trapp, it is here elegantly supposed, that Vulcan had engraved them behind her, to shew what was to be her destiny; tho' she was not then apprehensive of it.Flies to the fight, nor heeds the snakes, that wait And hiss behind, dread ministers of fate! Against great Neptune, in his strength array'd, And beauteous Venus, and the blue-ey'd maid, Engage the dog Anubis, on the floods, And the lewd herd of Ægypt's monster gods. Ver. 944. In polish'd steel—Virgil makes use of three different metals in the relievo of this shield, and each is applied not without reference to the colour or nature of the thing represented: mention has been already made of silver and gold; and here the poet, with great propriety, figures the image of the god of war in steel.In polish'd steel, conspicuous from afar, Amid the tumult storms the god of war. Her robes all rent, with many an ample stride, Grim Discord stalk'd, triumphant o'er the tide. Next, with her bloody scourge Bellona flies, And leads, in fatal pomp, the furies of the skies. Mean time, enthron'd on Actium's towering height, The God of day surveys the raging fight, And bends his twanging bow. With sudden dread, At the dire signal, all Arabia fled: At once retire, in wild confusion hurl'd, Egypt, and all th'assembled Eastern world. Amid the slaughters of the fight was seen, Pale with the fears of death, the Pharian queen; Aghast, she calls the kind propitious gales To speed her flight; and spreads her silken sails. The god display'd her figure, full in view, As o'er the floods with western winds she flew. While sunk in grief, the mighty Nile bemoans The shame and slaughter of his vanquish'd sons. He saw the rout; his mantle he unroll'd, Spread forth his robes, and open'd every fold, Expanded wide his arms, with timely care, And in his kind embrace receiv'd the flying war. Now moves great Cæsar (all his foes o'ercome,) With three proud triumphs thro' imperial Rome; And pays immortal honours to the skies: Behold at once three hundred temples rise! The streets resound with shouts and solemn games; And to the temples throng the Roman dames With ardent pray'rs: high altars rise around; And with the blood of victims smokes the ground. He sits enthron'd in Phœbus' Parian fane; In ranks before him pass the vanquish'd train, While he accepts the gifts that crown his toils, And hangs on high the consecrated spoils. Before the victor move the mighty throngs, Ver. 981. Discordant Tongues—It has been objected to the poet that he hath made Vulcan represent nations that spoke different languages; a thing impossible to be expressed in sculpture. But Mr. Pope has vindicated him by observing, that, if a painter should put into a picture, one town of France, and another of Flanders, might not one say, they were two towns that spoke different languages?—Thus Pliny says of Apelles, that he painted Clytus on horseback, going to battle, and demanding his helmet of his squire; of Aristides, that he drew a beggar whom he could almost understand, pæne cum voce: of Ctesilochus, that he had painted Jupiter bringing forth Bacchus, and crying out like a woman, et muliebriter ingemiscentem; and of Nicæarchus, that he had drawn a piece, in which Hercules was seen very melancholy on reflecting upon his madness, Herculem tristem, insaniæ pænitentiâ. No one sure will condemn those ways of expression, which are so common. Pope's Observations on the Shield of Achilles, from M. Dacier, B. 17.With different habits and discordant tongues. Here pass, distinguish'd by the god of fire, The sons of Afric in their loose attire; The Carians march; the bold Numidians ride; The Gelons shine with quivers at their side. Here croud the Daæ; and the nations, there, From earth's last ends assembled to the war. Here with diminish'd pride Euphrates mourns; There the maim'd Rhine bemoans his broken horns: And fierce Araxes, bridg'd of old in vain, Now bends, submissive, to the Roman chain. Such was the glorious gift in every part By Vulcan finish'd with immortal art: (The forms unknown, that grac'd its ample field;) The prince with joy surveys the story'd shield; Aloft he bears the triumphs yet to come, Ver. 997. The fortunes of his race—Attollens humero, in the original. This verse, says Mr. Addison, is perhaps the wittiest in Virgil. There is doubtless a mixture of ideas in it, very much in the manner of our modern writers, who make one part of their descriptions relate to the representation, and the other to the thing that is represented.The fortunes of his race, the fates of mighty Rome. The End of the Eighth Book. END of the Third Volume. VOL. IV. THE NINTH BOOK. This book is more particularly remarkable, because the hero has nothing to do in it; and it is the only one thro' all the poem, of that kind. The moderns have taken too much liberty in this point; for how many entire books are there in Tasso's Jerusalem, where Godfrey never appears? Not that the poet is always under a necessity of following his hero, without so much as quitting him once; on the contrary, it is proper that the poet should sometimes magnify the valour of the enemy, to render that of his hero more conspicuous. But by the episode of Nisus and Euryalus, we may perceive how deficient those Episodes are, which depart entirely from the subject; and have no connection, either with the action, or the fable. Such are the amours of Rinaldo and Armida, and the greater part of the adventures of Tancred, Erminia, and Clorinda; as F. Mambrun has judiciously remarked. It is not a fault to depart sometimes from the hero; but it is necessary, that all which passes in his absence should have some connexion with the principal action, or at least with the fable, as may be seen from this book. The action of this poem is the arrival of Æneas in Italy, and the foundation of a city; there is no doubt but that all which Turnus performs against this action, is part of the action itself: Because it is necessary, that this action should have a beginning, middle, and end; and of all these the fable or subject is composed; which is no more than the action, and its ornaments, or episodes; and which are so much the more beautiful, as they fall in more naturally with the subject. It is the very essence of episodes, that they may be taken away without hurting the subject; not that they should have no manner of connexion with the subject. Virgil observes all this exactly; but we are to consider, that the poet makes those episodes, where the hero does not much appear, far shorter than those where he has the principal part. For instance, the recital which Æneas makes of the taking of Troy, and his amour with Dido, are much longer than the history of Cacus related by Evander, or the adventures of Nisus and Euryalus which the poet himself relates. This last example of generous friendship, was an ornament not to be neglected: it is the chief beauty of this book; but it is not the only passage where the poet exerts himself: the complaints of the mother of Euryalus, the invectives of Numanus, and the attack of the camp in which the poet makes Turnus perform so many brave exploits; are all beyond imitation. Segrais. Dr. Trapp observes, that this book has the most fighting of any, and by that circumstance is likewise distinguished from the rest, and that in this too is the beginning of the warlike action. The Argument. Turnus takes advantage of Æneas's absence, attempts to fire his ships (which are transformed into sea-nymphs) and assaults his camp. The Trojans, reduced to the last extremities, send Nisus and Euryalus to recal Æneas, which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship, generosity, and conclusion of their adventures. In the morning, Turnus pushes the siege with vigour; and, hearing that the Trojans had opened a gate, he runs thither, and breaks into the town with the enemies he pursues. The gates are immediately closed upon him; and he fights his way through the town to the river Tyber. He is forced, at last, to leap, arm'd as he is, into the river, and swims to his camp. Thus while the prince collects auxiliar hosts, And leads new armies from the Tuscan coasts; Dispatch'd by heav'n's great empress from the skies, The goddess of the bow to Turnus flies; Where, cover'd with the shade, he made abode In his old grandsire's consecrated wood; There, as at ease reclin'd the godlike man, Her rosy lips she open'd, and began: Turnus, this kind auspicious hour bestows What scarce a god could promise to thy vows: For lo! the Trojan chief has parted hence, And for new succours courts th'Arcadian prince. Thence to the Tuscan coasts his course he bends, And leaves expos'd his walls, his fleets, and friends. Now, while the Lydians in his cause unite, And the raw peasants gather to the fight; Call, call the fiery coursers, and the car; Fly—storm his camp—and give a loose to war. This said; with levell'd wings she mounts on high, And cuts a glorious rainbow in the sky. He knew the fair; his lifted hands he spread, And with these words pursu'd her as she fled: Bright beauteous goddess of the various bow, What pow'r dispatch'd thee to the world below? What splendors open to my dazled eyes! What floods of glory burst from all the skies; And lo! the heav'ns divine, the planets roll! Thick shine the stars, and gild the glowing pole! Call'd by these omens to the field of blood, I follow to the war the great inspiring god! Raptur'd he said, and sought the limpid tide, Where gurgling streams in silver currents glide; There cleans'd his hands, then raising high in air, To ev'ry god addrest his ardent pray'r. And now, all gay and glorious to behold, Rich in embroider'd vests, and arms of gold, On sprightly prancing steeds, the martial train Spread wide their ranks o'er all th'embattled plain. The van with great Messapus at their head; The deep'ning rear the sons of Tyrrheus led. Brave Turnus flames in arms, supremely tall, Tow'rs in the centre, and outshines them all. Silent they march beneath their godlike guide: So mighty Ganges leads, with awful pride, In sev'n large streams his swelling solemn tide: So Nile, compos'd within his banks again, Moves in slow pomp, majestic, to the main. Troy saw from far the black'ning cloud arise: Then from the rampart's height Caïcus cries: See, see, my friends, yon dusky martial train, Involv'd in clouds, and sweeping o'er the plain. To arms—The foes advance—Your swords prepare; Fly—Mount the ramparts, and repel the war. With shouts they run; they gather at the call; They close the gates; they mount; they guard the wall. For so th'experienc'd prince had charg'd the host, When late he parted for the Tuscan coast; Whate'er befel, their ardor to restrain, Trust to their walls, nor tempt the open plain. There, tho' with shame and wrath their bosoms glow, Shut in their tow'rs, they wait th'embattled foe. 62. But mighty Turnus rode, &amp;c.] The character of Turnus is all thro' continu'd, qualis ab incepto processerat. I do not remember, that Virgil flags once in describing the resolute impetuosity, which this young hero every-where exerts. He here begins the siege with a most spirited exclamation, Ecquis erit mecum, o juvenes, qui primus in hostem? He attempts every pass and avenue, as a hungry wolf in a tempestuous night tries to enter a fold, his rage and hunger being still exasperated by the bleating of the lambs within: and, tho' he finds at last the fortress of the Trojans impregnable, he does not desist; but instantly makes an attempt to burn the ships. This character is conducted with a truly poetical sire. The above simile is taken from Apollonius Rhod. Argonaut. B. i. 1243.But mighty Turnus rode with rapid speed, 63.—dappled Thracian steed.] Virgil, says Catrou, seems to be particularly fond of Thracian horses, mark'd with spots of various colours. He has before mentioned this breed, ? Quem Thracius albis Portat equis bicolor maculis. Speaking of young Priam's horse, the son of Polites. See Turneb. L. 23. C. 14And furious spurr'd his dappled Thracian steed; Eager before the tardy squadrons flew To reach the walls; and soon appear'd in view (With twice ten noble warriors close behind); His crimson crest stream'd dreadful in the wind. Who first, he cry'd, with me the foe will dare? 69. Then hurl'd a dart, &amp;c.] The throwing a javelin into the air, was a ceremony practised by the Romans, when they declared war against any nation. This they derived from the Greeks. Before this was done, it was unlawful to commit any acts of hostility. This declaration was made by the pater patratus, who was chief of the fæciales. He us'd to pronounce with a loud voice the reasons for going to war, and then threw a javelin into the country of the new enemy. Numa was the first who introduc'd this custom. The declaring war was called clarigatio.Then hurl'd a dart, the signal of the war. Loud shout his train; deep wonder seiz'd them all, To see the Trojans skulk behind their wall; Safe in their tow'rs their forces they bestow, Nor take the field, nor meet th'approaching foe. Now furious Turnus, thund'ring round the plain, Tries every post and pass, but tries in vain. As, beat by tempests, and by famine bold, The prowling wolf attempts the nightly fold; Lodg'd in the guarded field beneath their dams, Safe from the savage, bleat the tender lambs; The monster meditates the fleecy brood; 81. Now thirsts for blood.] The original is siccæ sanguine fauces; where the word siccæ is elegantly us'd for vacuæ, with an ablative case.Now howls with hunger, and now thirsts for blood; Roams round the fences that the prize contain, And madly rages at the flock in vain: Thus, as th'embattled tow'rs the chief descries, Rage fires his soul, and flashes from his eyes: Nor entrance can he find, nor force the train From the close trench to combat on the plain. But to their fleet he bends his furious way, That, cover'd by the floods and ramparts, lay Beside the camp—He calls for burning brands, And rais'd a pine all-flaming in his hands. His great example the bold troop inspires; They rob the hearths; they hurl the missive fires; The black'ning smokes in curling volumes rise, With hov'ring clouds of cinders, to the skies. O say, ye muses, what celestial pow'r Preserv'd the navy in that dreadful hour, And stopp'd the progress of the furious flame? The tale is old, yet of immortal fame! The Trojan chief, prepar'd to stem the tide, 101.—Hills of Ide.] Æneas built his fleet at Antandros, which was at the foot of the Phrygian, not the Cretan Ida. ? Classemque sub ipsa Antandro, &amp; Phrygiæ molimur montibus Idæ. Æn. 3.Had built his fleet beneath the hills of Ide; When thus to Jove, in heav'n's supreme abodes, Spoke the majestic mother of the gods; Hear, and our first request, my son, accord, The first, since heav'n has own'd you for her lord. To our great name, and honour'd by our love, On lofty Ida tow'rs a stately grove; Tall firrs and maples there for years have stood, And waving pines, a venerable wood! 110.—I bestow'd with joy.] Virgil here, very artfully, saves Æneas from the imputation of impiety, which he certainly must have been guilty of, had he cut down Cybele's trees, without her consent. Catrou.To build his navy, I bestow'd with joy The hallow'd forest on the chief of Troy. Now anxious fears disturb my soul with care; But thou, my son, indulge a mother's pray'r: Bid seas and tempests spare the ships divine; Be this their safety, that they once were mine. Thus she—and thus replies her son, who rolls The golden planets round the spangled poles: What would our mother's rash request intend? To turn the fates from their determin'd end? How! an immortal state would you demand For vessels labour'd by a mortal hand? And shall the chief in certain safety ride, O'er rocks, o'er gulphs, and o'er th'uncertain tide? A pow'r so high we never yet bestow'd; No—'tis a pow'r too boundless for a God! But this we grant—when, all his labours o'er, The Trojan prince shall reach the Latian shore, Whatever ships the friendly strand shall gain, Sav'd from the storms, and the devouring main, Know, we will take the mortal form from these; Each ship shall launch, a goddess of the seas; And with her sister Nereids shall divide The silver waves, and bound along the tide. This said; the lord of thunder seal'd the vow By his dread brother's awful streams below; By the black whirlpools of the Stygian flood; 137. Then gave the Sanction.] Dixerat, idque ratum Stygii per flumina fratris Per pice torrentes, atraque voragine ripas; Annuit, &amp; totum nutu tremefecit Olympum. Virgil, it must be own'd, has not here given us the same noble image of Jupiter nodding, which we find in his great Grecian pattern. Mr. Pope observes, that he has preserv'd the nod, with its stupendous effect, the making the heavens tremble. But he has neglected the description of the hair, and the eye-brows, those chief pieces of imagery, from whence Phidias (as Macrobius informs us) took the idea of a countenance proper for the king of gods and men, when he made his Olympian Jupiter. Phidias, cum Jovem Olympium fingeret, interrogatus de quo exemplo divinam mutuaretur effigiem, respondit archetypum Jovis in his se tribus Homeri versibus invenisse: ? [] ?????????, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Nam de superciliis &amp; crinibus totum se Jovis vultum collegisse; quod utrumque videtis a Virgilio prætermissum Macrob. Saturnal. B. 5. Chap. 13. Scaliger's answer to Macrobius is very remarkable. Aut ludunt Phidiam, aut nos ludit Phidias: Etiam sine Homero puto illum scisse, Jovem non carere superciliis &amp; cæsarie. Mr. Spence would compound the matter between the two poets, by allowing (which is the very truth) that Virgil on this occasion has described Jupiter in the properest manner that could be among the Romans, and that Homer has described him in the noblest manner that could be among the Greeks. Polymet. D. 6. B. 2.Then gave the sanction of th'imperial nod; The heav'ns all shook, and fled before the god; Now was the hour arriv'd, th'appointed date, Fixt by the high eternal laws of fate; When the great mother of the thund'rer came To guard her sacred vessels from the flame. 143. First from the glowing orient.] The previous appearances with which Virgil ushers in this metamorphosis, are beautifully imagined, and finely painted. As to the metamorphosis itself, he undoubtedly introduced it, as an old tradition among the Romans: Prisca fides facto. I cannot but observe, that Virgil, in relating this transformation, has very judiciously avoided that affectation of conceit and witticism to be found in Ovid's description of it, Met. 14. 535. &amp; seq.First from the glowing orient they descry A blazing cloud that stretch'd from sky to sky; The golden splendors doubly gild the day, And high in air the tinkling cymbals play. At length, with wonder, and religious fear, A deep majestic voice the list'ning nations hear: Forbear, forbear, ye sons of Troy, nor lend Your needless aid, our vessels to defend. The proud Rutulian shall, with greater ease, Burn to their beds profound the watry seas; Launch you, my ships; be Nereids of the floods; So wills the mighty mother of the gods! Swift at the word, the sacred ships obey, From their loose anchors break, and bound away; Like sportive dolphins plunge beneath the main, Then (wondrous!) rise in female forms again. So many nymphs launch swiftly from the shore, As rode tall gallies in the port before. The fierce Rutulians shook with wild affright, Ev'n brave Messapus trembled at the sight, Nor could he rule his steeds, nor check their rapid flight. Old murm'ring Tyber shrunk with sudden dread, And to his source the hoary father fled. All, but the valiant Daunian hero, shook, Who rais'd their drooping souls, while thus he spoke: 168. These omens threat our foes, &amp;c.] The abruptness of the original is very remarkable. Trojanos hæc monstra petunt:—his Jupiter ipse Auxilium solitum eripuit.—Non tela, nec ignes Expectant Rutulos.—Ergo maria invia Teueris; Nec spes ulla fugæ.—Rerum pars altera ademta est: Terra autem in manibus nostris.—tot millia gentes Arma ferunt Italæ, &amp;c. &amp;c. The whole speech is a noble instance of Turnus's violent temper. 168. These omens threat our foes.] Thus the Trojans Il. B. 15. falsly interpret Jupiter's thunder in favour of themseves. Mr. Pope observes, that this self-partiality of men, in appropriating to themselves the protection of heaven, has always been natural to them. History (continues he) furnishes many instances of oracles, which, by reason of this partial interpretation, have proved an occasion to lead men into great misfortunes: It was the case of Crœsus in his wars with Cyrus; and a like mistake engaged Pyrrhus to make war upon the Romans.These omens threat our foes (O glorious day!): Lo! Jove has snatch'd their last relief away! Lo! from our dreaded arms their ships retire, And vanish swift before our vengeful fire; To Troy, imprison'd in yon narrow coast, The watry half of all the globe is lost. Their flight, the seas and hostile armies bar; The land is ours; and Italy from far Pours forth her sons, by nations, to the war. Her favouring oracles let Ilion boast; On Turnus all those empty vaunts are lost. To 'scape the seas, and reach the Latian land, Was all, their fates or Venus could demand. My fates now take their turn; and 'tis in mine, For my lost spouse, to crush the perjur'd line. Like brave Atrides, I'll redeem the dame, The same my cause, and my revenge the same. 185. Will Troy then venture.] Never were finer instances of a malicious sneer, than in this speech; “One would think the Trojans had enough of women; as they have already lost so much by them. Can they imagine a slight trench will protect them? It is not long since they saw their own Troy, which was built by the hands of Neptune, burnt to the ground. Let us hasten to the attack; I believe, we can easily overcome 'em, tho' we have not the advantage of a thousand ships, and arms forged by Vulcan. We'll deal fairly with them, they need not be afraid of our stealing their palladium, or concealing ourselves in the belly of an horse. We disdain a conquest in the dark; we'll set their fortress on fire in broad day-light. They'll soon find themselves engaged with a more powerful enemy, &amp;c. See Note on ver. 508. B. II.Will Troy then venture on a rape once more, Who paid so dearly for the crime before? Sure, they have long ago the thought declin'd, Forsworn the sex, and curst the costly kind! Fools! will they trust yon feeble wall and gate, That slight partition betwixt them and fate, Who not long since beheld their Troy renown'd, Their god-built Troy, lie smoking on the ground? Fly then, my friends, and let us force the foe; Seize, storm the camp, and lay their ramparts low. Nor want we, o'er these dastards to prevail, Arms forg'd by Vulcan, and a thousand sail; Though to support their desp'rate cause, should join Arcadia's sons with all the Tuscan line: Nor need the wretches fear, with vain affright, The sacred thefts or murders of the night, A robb'd Palladium, and an ambush'd force Lodg'd in the caverns of a monstrous horse. A conquest in the dark my soul disclaims; No—let us gird by day their walls with flames. Soon shall they find no Argive host appears, Whom Hector baffled ten revolving years. Now go, my valiant friends, and pass away In due repast the small remains of day: But rise, rise early with the dawning light, Fresh from repose, and vig'rous for the fight. Meantime it falls to great Messapus' care, The ramparts to surround with fire and war. Twice sev'n Rutulian leaders head the bands; An hundred spears each valiant chief commands: Proudly they march, in gold and purple gay, And crimson crests on every helmet play. They watch, they rest by turns; and, stretcht supine On the green carpet, quaff the gen'rous wine. The fires gleam round, and shoot a ruddy light; In plays and pleasures, pass the jovial night. This scene the Trojans from their trenches view; All seiz'd their arms, and to their ramparts flew; In wild affright to guard the gates they pour, Join bridge to bridge with speed, and tow'r to tow'r. Thus while th'endanger'd bulwarks they maintain, Mnestheus and brave Serestus fire the train. (The prince had left to their experienc'd care, If aught befel, the conduct of the war.) Now all the soldiers to their posts were flown, And in their turns, successive, guard the town. 231. The valiant Nisus.] The Poet (says Dr. Trapp) with great judgment naturally slides into this episode, without any formal preparation. He was speaking of the several posts which were defended: and among the rest, one was committed to the care of these two friends, whose characters he here judiciously gives us. Nisus erat portæ custos, &amp;c. &amp;c. Et juxta comes Euryalus, &amp;c. &amp;c.The valiant Nisus took his lot, to wait Before the portal, and defend the gate. From Ida's native woods the warrior came, Skill'd with the dart to pierce the flying game: With him Euryalus, who match'd in arms Troy's bravest youths, and far excell'd in charms; So young, the springing down but just began To shade his blooming cheeks, and promise man. These boys in sacred friendship were ally'd, And join'd in martial labours, side by side; In ev'ry danger, ev'ry glory shar'd; And both alike were planted on the guard. Has heav'n (cry'd Nisus first,) this warmth bestow'd? Heav'n? or a thought that prompts me like a god? This glorious warmth, my friend, that breaks my rest? Some high exploit lies throbbing at my breast. My glowing mind what gen'rous ardors raise, And set my mounting spirits on a blaze! See the loose discipline of yonder train; The lights, grown thin, scarce glimmer from the plain: The guards in slumber and debauch are drown'd; And mark!—a gen'ral silence reigns around. Then take my thought; the people, fathers, all, Join in one wish, our leader to recall. Now, wou'd they give to thee the prize I claim, (For I cou'd rest contented with the fame—) 257. An easy road methinks.] This obscure hint of his design comes with much more grace than if it had been deliver'd in full and plain terms, as it implies a decent and ingenuous diffidence in so young a warrior.An easy road, methinks, I can survey Beneath yon summit to direct my way. The brave Euryalus, with martial pride, Fir'd with the charms of glory, thus reply'd: 261. And will my Nisus] Euryalus, suspecting that Nisus had but a mean opinion of his martial abilities, as he does not at first propose to admit him a sharer in his intended adventure, breaks forth into this beautiful vindication of his own courage. A noble instance this, of the delicate sensibility of true friendship!And will my Nisus then his friend disclaim? Deny'd his share of danger, and of fame? And can thy dear Euryalus expose Thy life, alone, unguarded to the foes? Not so my father taught his gen'rous boy, Born, train'd and season'd in the wars of Troy. And, where the great Æneas led the way, I brav'd all dangers of the land and sea. Thou too canst witness that my worth is try'd; We march'd, we fought, we conquer'd side by side. Like thine, this bosom glows with martial flame; Burns with a scorn of life, and love of fame; And thinks, if endless glory can be sought On such low terms, the prize is cheaply bought. 275. Let no such.] Nisus replies, that he never suspected his friend's courage; but as the undertaking seemed to be attended with no small danger, he would not chuse that his friend's life should be expos'd—Te superesse velim: and adds, that his younger years are a reason why he should not engage in so hazardous an enterprize; Tuo vita dignior ætas: which words, Dr. Trapp remarks, are extremely well contriv'd to add a pathos to the whole; the more manly prudence and care of the one being oppos'd to the youthful fire and sprightliness of the other. But (says Nisus by a most beautiful transition) if you remain, there will then be one, who will redeem my body from the enemy, and bury it; or at least build a tomb to my memory. Besides, continues he, think of your poor mother! what must she feel for the loss of you, to accompany whom she left the rest of the Trojan matrons with Acestes! Nec matri miseræ tanti sim causa doloris. There is a kind of anticipation in what Nisus objects concerning Euryalus's mother, which is inexpressibly fine.Let no such jealous fears alarm thy breast: Thy worth and valour stand to all confest. But let the danger fall (he cries) on me: For this exploit, I durst not think on thee! No:—as I hope the blest ethereal train May bring me glorious to thy arms again! But should the gods deny me to succeed, Should I—(which heav'n avert!) but should I bleed; Live thou;—in death some pleasure that will give; Live for thy Nisus's sake; I charge thee, live. Thy blooming youth a longer term demands;— Live, to redeem my corse from hostile hands; And decent to the silent grave commend The poor remains of him who was thy friend: Or raise at least, by kind remembrance led, A vacant tomb in honour of the dead. Why should I cause thy mother's soul to know Such heart-felt pangs? Unutterable woe! Thy dear fond mother, who, for love of thee, Dar'd every danger of the land and sea! She left Acestes' walls, and she alone, To follow thee, her only, darling son! In vain, he cry'd, my courage you restrain; My soul's on fire, and you but plead in vain. Haste—let us go—He said—and rais'd the guard; By turns their vacant posts the centries shar'd. With eager speed the gen'rous warriors went, Inflam'd with glory, to the royal tent. 303. In silence.] This is a beautiful military night-piece. Every thing is hush'd in sleep and silence, except the Trojans, who, leaning on their spears, are consulting how to recal their absent prince: in the midst of this consultation, these two young adventurers are introduced, who voluntarily offer their service in the point debated. The reply of Alethes to their proposal is very moving; and the contrast between youth and age, produced in his speech and embrace, has a fine effect.In silence hush'd the whole creation lay, And lost in sleep the labours of the day. Not so the chiefs of Ilion, who debate 306. In solenn council.]— Consilium summis regni de rebus habebant. This verse is borrow'd from Lucilius: Consilium summis hominum de rebus habebant.In solemn council on th'endanger'd state; Propp'd on their spears, their bucklers in their hand, Amid the camp the hoary fathers stand, And vote an instant message may be sent To their great chief, their ruin to prevent. The friends now beg admission of the court, The business arduous, and of high import. The prince commands them to inform the train; And first bade Nisus speak, who thus began: Attend, nor judge, ye venerable peers! Our bold adventure by our tender years. As yonder bands in sleep and wine are drown'd, We, by kind chance, a secret path have found, Close by the gate, that near the ocean lies; The fires are thinn'd, and clouds of smoke arise. If you permit, since fair occasion calls, Safe can we pierce to great Evander's walls. Soon shall our mighty chief appear again, Adorn'd with spoils, and striding o'er the slain, Lord of the field; nor can we miss the road, But know the various windings of the flood; For, as we hunt, we see the turrets rise, Peep o'er the vales, and dance before our eyes. Then thus Alethes, an illustrious sage, Renown'd for wisdom, and rever'd for age: Ev'n yet, ye guardian gods, your pow'rs divine Will spare the relics of the Trojan line, Since you the bosoms of our youths inspire With such high courage, such determin'd fire. Then in his arms the boys by turns he took With tears of joy; and, panting, thus bespoke: Oh! what rewards, brave youths, can be decreed, What honours, equal to so great a deed? The best and fairest, all th'applauding sky, And your own conscious virtue, shall supply; The next, our great Æneas will bestow, And young Ascanius' riper years shall owe. Whatever boon such merit can receive, The friend, the monarch, and the man, will give. And I, brave Nisus! crys the royal boy, Swear by the sacred guardian pow'rs of Troy, My hopes, my fortunes, are repos'd in you; Go then, your gen'rous enterprize pursue. Oh! to these longing eyes my sire restore; From that blest hour my sorrows are no more. Two silver bowls, whose ample margins shine, All rais'd with costly sculpture, shall be thine; The same my conqu'ring father brought away, 354. When low in dust.] These words Devicta genitor quæ cepit Arisba, are falsly understood by most of the interpreters. They suppose, that Arisba was taken and pillaged by the Trojans: on the contrary, it was a Trojan town, and one of the new dynasties of Priam's kingdom. Virgil means, that these two bowls were sav'd by Æneas, out of the sacking of Arisba, when it was taken by the Greeks. Catrou. Dr. Trapp translates it,—Which my father took from sack'd Arisba.When low in dust the fair Arisba lay: Two glitt'ring tripods, beauteous to behold, And two large talents of the purest gold: With these a goblet, which the queen of Tyre Bestow'd in Carthage on my royal sire. 359. And when these vanquish'd kingdoms.] This presumption of Ascanius, that Æneas would certainly succeed in gaining this new kingdom, is quite consistent with the warmth and levity of a young mind.And, when these vanquish'd kingdoms are our own; When my great father mounts the Latian thorne; When our victorious hosts by lot shall share The rich rewards, and glorious spoils, of war; 363. What late though saw'st.] A beautiful horse, and fine armour, were objects which must naturally have made an impression on the mind of one so young as Ascanius. He therefore promises these, as esteeming them a very great reward.What late thou saw'st, when Turnus took the field, His prancing courser, helm, and golden shield; That courser, shield, and helm, of skill divine, Exempt from lot, brave Nisus, shall be thine. My sire will give twelve captives with their arms; Yet more—twelve females of distinguish'd charms; And, to complete the whole, the wide domain Of the great Latian lord, a boundless plain. But thee, dear youth, not yet to manhood grown, Whose years but just advance before my own, No fortune henceforth from my soul shall part, Still at my side, and ever at my heart, My dangers, glories, counsels, thoughts, to share; My friend in peace, my brother in the war! All, all my life, replies the youth, shall aim, Like this one hour, at everlasting fame. Tho' fortune only our attempt can bless, Yet still my courage shall deserve success. 381. But one reward.] The filial piety which Euryalus so passionately expresses, endears him to us, and prepossesses us greatly in his favour; and by that means, contributes to interest us so much the more in the success of his adventure.But one reward I ask, before I go, The greatest I can ask, or you bestow. My mother, tender, pious, fond, and good, Sprung, like thy own, from Priam's royal blood; Such was her love, she left her native Troy, And fair Trinacria, for her darling boy; And such is mine, that I must keep unknown From her, the danger of so dear a son: To spare her anguish, lo! I quit the place Without one parting kiss, one last embrace! By night, and that respected hand, I swear, Her melting tears are more than I can bear! For her, good prince, your pity I implore; Support her, childless; and relieve her, poor; Oh! let her, let her find (when I am gone), In you, a friend, a guardian, and a son! With that dear hope, embolden'd shall I go, Brave ev'ry danger, and defy the foe. 399. Charm'd with.] What an affecting picture is here! The brevity and simplicity of ? Perculsa mente dederunt Dardanidæ lacrymas ? is inimitable. And how artfully does the poet, from this instance of Euryalus, take an opportunity of extolling the filial piety of Ascanius! Virgil, beside the other proofs of his humanity and good-nature, appears to have a strong idea of that swell in a good man's breast, which fills the eye with tears, on his hearing any great or good moral action or resolution: ? Perculsa mente, &amp;c. And this is the more remarkable, because it is scarce ever mentioned or described by any other of the antient writers. Mr. SpenceCharm'd with his virtue, all the Trojan peers, But more than all, Ascanius melts in tears, To see the sorrows of a duteous son, And filial love, a love so like his own, I promise all, heroic youth! he said, That to such matchless valour can be paid; To me, thy mother still shall be the same Creüsa was, and only want the name. Let fortune good or ill success decree; 'Tis merit, sure, to bear a son like thee! Now by my head, my father's oath, I vow, Whate'er rewards I purpose to bestow, When safe return'd, on thee, the same shall grace Thy mother, and thy whole surviving race. So spoke the prince; and, weeping at the word, 414. Gave to the pious youth.] Humero simul exuit ensem. Because the belt hung from his shoulder, tho' the sword by his side. So Book 8. ? Lateri atque humeris Tegeæum subligat ensem.Gave to the pious youth his costly sword: The sword with wondrous art Lycaon made; An ivory scabbard sheath'd the shining blade. To Nisus, Mnestheus gave a lion's hide; And a new helm Alethes' care supply'd. Thus arm'd, they quit the tent; th'assembly waits, With high applause, their progress to the gates. Mature in wisdom, far above his years, The fair Iülus in the train appears, And sends his father many an ardent pray'r; All lost in wind, and scatter'd wide in air! Now, favour'd by the shade, the warriors go, Pass the deep trenches, and invade the foe. But, ere their dang'rous enterprize is o'er, With what large slaughter shall they bathe the shore! 429. Immers'd in wine.] This whole description of the camp (the medley of debauch and war, as Mr. Dryden calls it), and of the slaughter in it, is a most masterly piece of painting. These strokes particularly: ? Passim vino somnoque per herbam Corpora fusa vident; arrectos littore currus, Inter lora rotasque, viros: simul arma jacere, Vina simul. ? ? Ense superbum Rhamnetem aggreditur; qui forte tapetibus altis Extructus, toto proflabat pectore somnum. ? Truncumque reliquit Sanguine singultantem: atro tepefacta cruori Terra, torique madent. ? ? Rhætum vigilantem, &amp; cuncta videntem; Sed magnum metuens se post cratera tegebat. Pectore in adverso totum cui cominus ensem Condidit assurgenti, &amp; multa morte recepit: Purpuream vomit ille animam, &amp; cum sanguine mista Vina refert moriens. ? Especially in that verse, Condidit assurgenti, &amp;c. we see his breast rising full against the point of the sword, and meeting it half way. But may not an objection be urged against this conduct? It is certainly none, to say (as some do) that it was cruel to kill so many men in their sleep: they were enemies in war, and but two against a whole army. The difficulty is in point of probability; how they were able to do it, without being discover'd. 'Tis strange that the whole army should be dead drunk, or fast asleep; however debauched they had been. Nay, we are told, one was actually awake, and saw it all. 'Tis much he should not cry out to alarm his friends; at least after he was stabb'd, if he was afraid before. It is likewise very strange, that these two adventurers themselves should not think they would come off very well, if they could get safe thro' the enemy's camp; without taking it into their thoughts, to do so much execution among them. To all this I have nothing to answer, but that the thing, tho' very strange, is possible: and possible and probable in heroic poesy signify much the same. If we deny it this boldness, we take away its greatest beauty; which is, the marvellous and surprising. Trapp.All drench'd in wine and sleep, lie stretch'd around, The careless soldiers on the verdant ground, Amidst a pile of traces, wheels and reins, And empty cars, incumbring all the plains. Here lie the scatter'd arms; the goblets there; A mad confusion of debauch and war. Now, now, cries Nisus first, thy courage call; The place, the hour, my friend, demands it all. Here lies our road: while I the passage find, Stay thou, and cautious watch the foe behind. From side to side, whole squadrons will I slay, Thro' death and horrors op'ning wide thy way. With that, the youth in silence drew his sword, And stabb'd proud Rhamnes, a distinguish'd lord; In ev'ry deep prophetic art approv'd, A king and augur, and by Turnus lov'd. On the rich couch in slumbers deep he lay, And, labouring, slept the full debauch away. The fate of others he had still foreshown, But fail'd, unhappy! to prevent his own. Then on the 'squire of Remus fierce he flew; And, as they slept, his three attendants slew. The driver next; and cut his neck in twain, As, midst the steeds, he slumber'd on the plain; Last on their lord employ'd the deadly steel; Swift flew the head; and mutter'd as it fell. The purple blood distains the couch around; The welt'ring trunk lies beating on the ground. Next Lamyrus and Lamus meet their doom: Serranus last, in all his sprightly bloom: By the large draught o'erpow'r'd, outstretch'd he lay, Full half the night already spent in play; Far happier had it been, if lengthen'd to the day. Thus o'er th'unguarded fence, by hunger bold, Springs the grim lion, and invades the fold. All dreadful, growling in the midnight hours, The trembling flock he murders and devours; While wrapt in silence lies the fleecy brood, The savage rages in a foam of blood. Nor with less rage Euryalus employ'd The deadly sword; but nameless crouds destroy'd. Hebesus, Fadus, as they slept, he goar'd; But wakeful Rhæsus saw the slaught'ring sword: Behind a goblet he retir'd in vain; For as the foe, detected, rose again, The furious youth, with all his force imprest, 475. Plung'd the whole sword.] ? Et multa morte recepit. Dr. Trapp's translation is remarkable, ? And with abundant death Receiv'd him ? All the commentators (but one) apply recepit to the sword, not to the man, i. e. retraxit ensem multa morte, i. e. multo cruore tinctum. But the image is much nobler, and the expression far more poetical, as Dr. Trapp understands it, recepit [Rhætum] multa morte. The other was rising up towards him, and he receives him with abundance of death; meaning the full stroke which he had at his breast. Which (as observed in the foregoing note) is described by the very sound of the verse, as rising full against the point of the sword, and meeting it half way. La Cerda is the only expositor, who interprets this expression like Dr. Trapp, Recepit dira hospitalitate. Some read inulta, for which there is the authority of one MS. in Italy, as we are told by Waddelius, in loc.Plung'd the whole sword, deep-bury'd in his breast; With blended wine and blood, the ground was dy'd; The purple soul came floating in the tide. So vents the youth his vengeance on his foes, And scatters death and slaughter as he goes. Now when to brave Messapus' tents they came, The fires just glimmer'd with a quiv'ring flame. The train lie scatter'd, while the steeds, unbound, Expatiate wide, and graze the verdant ground. Then Nisus warn'd him; for he saw the boy Too fierce for blood, too eager to destroy; Enough of death—our swords have hew'd the way— We stand detected by the dawning day. They part; and leave, in piles confus'dly roll'd, Bright arms, embroider'd robes, and bowls of gold. But yet the fond Euryalus would stay, Resolv'd to seize one rich distinguish'd prey; The shining trappings Rhamnes' coursers bore, And the broad golden belt the monarch wore. 494. Of old, to Remulus.] It was antiently a custom, says Mr. Pope [note ver. 313. Il. 10.], to make these military presents to brave adventurers. So Jonathan in the first book of Sam. stript himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David; and his garments even to his sword, and his bow, and his girdle chap. viii. v. 4.Of old, to Remulus was sent the prize By Cædicus, the pledge of social ties; 496. Which with his grandson.] Ille suo moriens dat habere nepati. This is a Greek mode of speaking, as ?? ???? ?????.Which with his grandson at his death remain'd, And last by war the fierce Rutulians gain'd. This belt he bore, exulting, from the plain, And in gay triumph wore, but wore in vain! Next, with Messapus' helm, his brows he spread, Adorn'd with plumes, that nodded o'er his head. Then, flush'd with slaughter and the glorious prey, They quit the camp, and seek a safer way. Meantime, the Daunian hero to support, Advanc'd a legion from the Latian court; Three hundred horse, while slow the foot succeed, Fly swift before, with Volscens at their head. Now to the camp the warriors bend their way, And, on the left, the hapless youths survey. 510. Euryalus' bright helm.] The discovery of our adventurers is finely conducted. They are detected merely by so slight a circumstance, as that of an helmet reflecting the moon-beams. What can be more natural than this! The beauty of this discovery consists in the slightness of the circumstance which occasioned it. We are to remember too, that they are betray'd by part of the spoil they had been just taking, Messapus's helmet. See note on ver. 621. B. 7.Euryalus' bright helm the pair betray'd, On which the moon in all her glory play'd. 512. 'Tis not for nought.] Haud temere, &amp;c. that is, non otiose, segniter, and consequently not in vain. Some refer haud temere est visum to the poet's narration; but I think it comes with much more advantage from the mouth of this watchful leader.'Tis not for nought, those youths appear; declare (Cries the stern gen'ral) who, and whence you are; And whither bound; and wherefore arm'd for war? Nought they reply, but took their sudden flight To the thick forests, and the shades of night. But the fierce warriors spurr'd their steeds, and stood All round, to guard the op'nings of the wood. O'ergrown and wild, the darksome forest lay, 520. And trees and brakes.] Rara per occultos ducebat semita calles. Servius takes semita for a path made by men; calles for the tracks worn by cattle. Rara semita may signify either paucæ semitæ, according to Rueus; like Rara avis in Juvenal, and rarus emptor in Pliny: or narrow; Dr. Trapp has taken both, ? few narrow paths, &amp;c. Servius says, raro lucens; for, instead of ducebat, some read lucebat, which I think a more elegant reading.And trees and brakes perplex'd the winding way. Hither, incumber'd with his gaudy prize, Distress'd Euryalus for shelter flies; But miss'd the turnings, in his wild surprize. Not so, swift Nisus, who the foes declin'd, Nor knew th'endanger'd boy was left behind; Beyond the once-fam'd Alban fields he fled, Where the fleet coursers of Latinus fed. 528. There stood the mournful youth.] Never was distress more strongly painted than this! He looks back for his best-beloved friend, but in vain: He retraces his steps thro' the mazes of the silent wood, dumisque silentibus, and on a sudden hears the sound of approaching horsemen: At last he perceives his friend surrounded by the enemy. Quid faciat? in this place, is finely introduced by the poet. His prayer to Diana, before he throws his spear, is most affecting, and suitable to his circumstances.There stood the mournful youth; and, from the plain, Cast a long look, to find his friend, in vain! Where is Euryalus, my only joy? Where shall I find (he cry'd) the hapless boy? Then he retrac'd his former steps, and trod, Once more, the winding mazes of the wood. The trampling steeds and warriors pour behind, And the loud cries come thick in ev'ry wind. Here, while he paus'd, a gen'ral shout he heard; And lo! his lov'd Euryalus appear'd, Surrounded by the foe: the gloomy night, And pathless thickets, intercept his flight. With joyful clamours croud the gath'ring train Around the captive, who resists in vain. What can his friend attempt, what means employ, What arms, what succours, to redeem the boy? Or thro' th'embattled squadrons shall he fly, And, prest by hostile numbers, nobly die? Then on the moon he cast a mournful look, And in his hand the pointed jav'lin shook: Great guardian goddess of the woods! (he cries) Pride of the stars, and empress of the skies! If e'er with gifts my father hung thy shrine For his dear son, and sought thy pow'r divine, Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils, And grac'd thy sacred roof with savage spoils; Direct my lance, nor let it fly in vain, But, wing'd with death, disperse the hostile train. This said; with all his strength the spear he threw; Swift thro' the parting shade the weapon flew. In Sulmo's back the point all-quiv'ring stood, And pierc'd his heart, but left the broken wood. He pour'd a purple flood, as prone he lay; While in thick sobs he gasp'd his soul away. 562. The crouds.] This is a fine image, and an elegant expression, Diversi circumspiciunt; it is borrowed from the Medea of Pacuvius, Diversi circumspicimus, horror percipit.The crouds gaze round; when lo! a second flies, Fierce as the first, and sings along the skies. Thro' Tagus' temples, o'er the shrinking train, It flew, and sunk deep-bury'd in the brain. 566. Now, mad for vengeance.] The rage of Volscens, upon the death of his soldiers, heightens our fear. But when Nisus sees him running upon his friend, with his drawn sword, we are almost in as great a fright, and in as much confusion, as he. Trapp.Now, mad for vengeance, Volscens storm'd, nor found The daring author of the distant wound: But thy curst blood shall pay for both, he said; Then rush'd impetuous with the flaming blade Against the trembling boy—with wild affright, All-pale, confus'd, distracted at the sight, From his close covert Nisus rush'd in view, And sent his voice before him as he flew: 574. Me, me, to me alone.] Aristotle advises epic writers to intermix the tragic in their works. It is the epic poem, says he, which furnishes matter for tragedy; and Homer in his two poems has exhibited an infinity of actions, proper for the heroic stage. He says likewise, that the dramatic species has great advantages over the epic. Lastly, the same critic, after having laid it down as a rule, that the epic and the dramatic poem are both an imitation of an action; but that the epopœia imitates by reciting, and the drama by placing before our eyes each particular actor, who has his respective share in the action, adds these words: It is necessary, that a poem which is carried on by narration, and whose imitation is in words, should approach as near as possible to the dramatic manner of tragedy. ??? ???? ?????? ??????? ?? ???? ?????????? []????????? ???????????. Virgil understood the importance of this precept. He has observed it in many parts of his Æneid; but one would think, he had made it his business to give this episode of Nisus and Euryalus all the beauties of tragedy. 1. His narrative is as busy and active, as that of the drama. The poet says but little in his own person, but makes his actors say a great deal. What he says himself, is only to make out the necessary connexions between the speeches which he puts into the mouth sometimes of Nisus, sometimes of Euryalus, and sometimes of his mother. Think that you see each of them delivering their sentiments on the stage. 2. He attributes to his heroes manners intirely agreeable to tragedy. To move compassion for the personages represented in the theatre, it is not proper to form their characters so perfect (says Aristotle), that their misery should provoke the indignation of the spectator against the gods, when he sees them fallen, or ready to fall, into misfortune. Nor must they be painted so vitious, that they may raise rather abhorrence for their persons, than pity for their misfortunes. Foibles and faults of a lighter kind, joined with a good deal of virtue, make the hero of a tragedy deserve our tears. Euryalus is here completely formed to become the object of our most tender compassion. His birth, his beauty, his youth, his valour, his fidelity to his friend; his imprudence in wearing an helmet, by which he is discovered; his loading himself with spoils, that retard his march; so natural for a young warrior; all these circumstances excite a compassion for him, not mingled or dash'd with any other sentiment. 3. All the incidents of this tragic episode are prepared and conducted after the manner of the most regular drama. These two friends do not depart from the Trojan camp, till the poet has taken care to give us an insight into their characters. We are not ignorant of their friendship founded upon virtue, Nisus amore pio pueri, nor of the age of the young Euryalus, Mea quem spatiis propioribus ætas insequitur; nor of his noble birth, his mother being descended from Priam, Priami de gente vetusta. We are informed of the subject of their departure, in which, without doubt, the whole colony is interested,—That of going to seek for Æneas. Thus we have what Aristotle calls, the beginning of the poem, or the protasis; which is employed in acquainting us with the persons interested in the action. Next follows the plot, or complication of circumstances; this is accompanied with peripeties, that is to say, changes in the situation of the heroes. Our two friends march towards the camp of the Rutulians. Nothing is more happy than this beginning. Volscens comes upon them with a party of the enemy; Nisus and Euryalus are discovered: another peripetie changing good into bad. Soon after one of them finds himself in a forest, the night being very dark. Our apprehensions lest these two friends should be slain, are suspended by the hopes of seeing them escape. This is a second part of the drama, which the masters of that art term the epitasis. Lastly, Euryalus is surprised by an ambuscade; his friend endeavours to rescue him from the surrounding soldiers; but, overpower'd by the Rutulians, he dies; and Nisus, to revenge his death, wounds Volscens, who had killed him; himself expires upon the body of Euryalus. This is the unravelling, and the catastrophe. Nothing is wanting to this tragic event, but the pomp of scenery. But that, says Aristotle, does not belong to the province of the poet. The musician and the artificer partake with the poet the honour of the drama, by the decorations, and the harmony of the chorus. Catrou.Me, me, to me alone, your rage confine; Here sheath your javelins; all the guilt was mine. By yon bright stars, by each immortal god, His hands, his thoughts, are innocent of blood! Nor could, nor durst the boy the deed intend; His only crime (and oh! can that offend?) Was too much love to his unhappy friend! In vain he spoke, for ah! the sword, addrest With ruthless rage, had pierc'd his lovely breast. With blood his snowy limbs are purpled o'er, And, pale in death, he welters in his gore. 585. Flow'r.] This simile, copied from Homer, is finely improved by the Roman author (says Pope) with the particulars of, Succisus aratro, and lasso collo. But it may be observed in favour of Homer, that the circumstances of the head being oppress'd, and weigh'd down with the helmet, is so remarkably just, that it is a wonder Virgil omitted it; and the rather, because he had particularly taken notice before, that it was the helmet of Euryalus, that discover'd and occasion'd the death of this young hero, and his friend. Iliad. 8. 371.As a gay flow'r, with blooming beauties crown'd, Cut by the share, lies languid on the ground; Or some tall poppy, that o'er-charg'd with rain Bends the faint head, and sinks upon the plain; So fair, so languishingly sweet he lies, His head declin'd and drooping, as he dies! Now midst the foe, distracted Nisus flew; Volscens, and him alone, he keeps in view. The gath'ring train the furious youth surround; Dart follows dart, and wound succeeds to wound; All, all, unfelt; he seeks their guilty lord; In firy circles flies his thund'ring sword; Nor ceas'd, but found, at length, the destin'd way; And, bury'd in his mouth, the faulchion lay. Thus cover'd o'er with wounds on ev'ry side, Brave Nisus slew the murd'rer as he dy'd; Then, on the dear Euryalus his breast, Sunk down, and slumber'd in eternal rest. Hail, happy pair! if fame our verse can give, From age to age, your memory shall live; Long as th'imperial capitol shall stand, 606. Or Rome's majestic lord.] Pater, parens, and genitor, are often used by the Roman writers for ruler or governor: ? Jupiter arces Temperat æthereas, &amp; mundi regna triformis; Terra sub Augusto; pater est &amp; rector uterque. Ov. Met. 15. 860. Statius calls Domitian Parens Latius, Sylv. 1, 2, 178. ? Cum jam, genitor, lucebis ab omni Parte poli ? V. Flaccum Arg. 1. 17. He had called him sancte pater too before, ver. 11. Thus Ovid to Augustus: Sancte pater patriæ, tibi plebs, tibi curia nomen Hoc dedit; hoc dodimus non tibi nomen eques. Fast. 2. 126. How literally true, see Suetonius, in August. c. 58. The name of reges was generally used with some sort of contempt by the Roman writers. Imperator signify'd the same as a general, with us. Pater signify'd a ruler, a preserver, and father of the people. Augustus was cautious of taking too high a title: Nec aliud discordantis patriæ remedium fuisse, quin ut ab uno regeretur: non regno tantum, neque dictatura, sed principis nomine constitutam rempublicam. Tacitus (where he is speaking for and against Augustus) An. Lib. 1. Virgil in other places uses genitor and pater for governor, Æn. 1. 154. G. 4. 382. These words had long been used in that sense; perhaps ever since the first governments, which were by fathers. It was a mild humane name for a governor; and perhaps has a particular propriety for a Roman governor; for pater used by way of eminence, the senator, or chief senator, and princeps senatus, are almost univocal terms. To this may be added, that one of the most common inscriptions on Augustus's medals is, that of Augustus Pater. Thus Horace uses it of Augustus; Hic ames dici pater atque princeps. Od. 1. 2. 50. And of Jupiter, where too he is complimenting Augustus: Gentis humanæ pater atque custos! Orte Saturno! tibi cura magni Cæsaris fatis data! tu secundo Cæsare regnes. Ib. Od. 12. Spence.Or Rome's majestic lord the conquer'd world command! The victors first divide the gaudy prey; Then to the camp their breathless chief convey: There too a scene of gen'ral grief appears; There, crouds of slaughter'd princes claim their tears. Stretch'd o'er the plain their hapless friends they found, Some pale, in death, some gasping on the ground. With copious slaughter all the field was dy'd, And streams of gore run thick on ev'ry side. All knew the belt and helm divinely wrought; But mourn the fatal prize, so dearly bought. Now, dappled streaks of light Aurora shed, And ruddy rose from Tithon's saffron bed: Then fiery Phœbus, with his golden ray, Pour'd o'er the op'ning world a flood of day. When furious Turnus gave the loud alarms; First arm'd himself; then call'd the host to arms. The chiefs their soldiers to the field excite, Inflame their rage, and lead them to the fight. On pointed spears, a dreadful sight! they bore The heads of both the hapless youths, before; With barb'rous joy survey the bloody prize, And shout, and follow with triumphant cries. The Trojans, on the left, sustain the fight From their high walls; the river guards the right. They line the trenches, and the tow'rs maintain; Thick on the ramparts stand the pensive train, And know the heads too well, tho' cover'd o'er With sanguine stains, and all-deform'd with gore. 635. Now to the mother's ears.] Tho' (says Dr. Trapp) what is commonly and strictly call'd the episode of Nisus and Euryalus, concludes with their death, at ver. 449. Imperiumque pater, &amp;c. yet the lamentation which is made by the mother of the latter, most agreeably brings us back to that subject, when we thought it was entirely ended. And whether we call it a part of that episode, or the sequel of it, is not at all material. However that be, it certainly equals, if not excels, any part of it.Now to the mother's ears the news had fled, Her son, her dear Euryalus, was dead: The vital warmth her trembling limbs forsook, She dropp'd the shuttle, and with horror shook; With hair dishevell'd from the walls she flies, And rends the air with agonizing cries; Breaks thro' the foremost troops in wild despair, Nor heeds the darts, or dangers of the war. 643. And is it thus.] The manner, in which Euryalus's mother is affected, on hearing the fatal news of her son's death, is highly moving; but the speech which she breaks out into on the occasion is still more pathetic; the circumstances of distress are all finely chosen, and exprest in a most striking manner. What a beginning is that! Hunc ego te, Euryale, aspicio? Scaliger (says Dr. Trapp) had reason to be in raptures upon it; for there is nothing in the fourth book itself more moving and pathetical.And is it thus, the comfort of my years, Thus, thus, my dear Euryalus appears? And could'st thou fly, my child, to certain harms? To death (oh cruel!) from thy mother's arms? So fond a mother?—nor thy purpose tell? Nor let me take my last, my sad, farewel? A prey to dogs, alas! thy body lies, And ev'ry fowl that wings the Latian skies! 651. Nor did thy mother.] ? Nec! te tua funera mater. Produxi. ? Catrou translates this passage, “Nor was it permitted me to conduct you.—what have I said? to conduct your corpse to the tomb.” In this interpretation he follows Donatus; who observes, that the afflicted mother is obliged by the violence of her grief, to make this abrupt stop in the middle of her speech Nec te—:Hic quoque aliud dictura fuit, says he. To this explication of Donatus, Catrou subjoins, that she makes here a correction of what she had said, Nec te produxi, I did not conduct you; what have I said? I would have said your dead body, immo tua funera. This interpretation is truly poetical; without recurring to the uncertain explication of the word funera, as some of the commentators have done.Nor did thy mother close thy eyes in death, Compose thy limbs, nor catch thy parting breath; 653. Nor bathe.] Imitated from Ennius, in Cresphonte. Neque terram injicere, neque cruenta Convestire mihi corpora licuit; Neque miseræ lavere lacrymæ salsum sanguinem.Nor bathe thy gaping wounds, nor cleanse the gore, Nor throw the rich embroider'd mantle o'er; The work that charm'd the cares of age away, My task all night, my labour all the day; The robe I wove, thy absence to sustain, For thee, my child;—but, wove, alas! in vain. Where shall I find thee now? what land contains Thy mangled members and thy dear remains? How on thy face these longing eyes I fed! Ah! how unlike the living is the dead! For that, o'er lands and oceans have I gone? Is that, the sole sad relic of my son? That bloody ball!—No more!—ye foes of Troy, Come all, a poor abandon'd wretch destroy; Here, here, direct, in pity, ev'ry dart, Plant ev'ry jav'lin in this breaking heart: Or with thy bolts, o Jove! conclude my woe, And plunge me flaming to the shades below. Strike—and I'll bless the stroke, that sets me free; 'Tis ease, 'tis mercy, to a wretch like me! Her loud complaints the melting Trojans hear, Sigh back her sighs, and answer tear for tear. Their courage slackens; and the frantic dame With her wild anguish damps the martial flame. But young Ascanius, while his sorrows flow, And his full eyes indulge the gush of woe, With great Ilioneus, commands the train To bear the matron to her tent again. 681. Now the shrill.] After this exquisite piece of pathos, and the damp struck into the Trojans by the lamentations of this distracted mother, how are we roused at the sudden sound of the trumpet! At tuba terribilem sonitum procul ære canoro Increpuit. It is to be observed, that the warlike action (I mean what may be called the regular warlike action) begins with these fine lines.Now the shrill trumpet's dreadful voice from far, With piercing clangors animates the war. 683. The deaf'ning clamours rise.] It was customary with the Romans to begin the engagement with loud shouts. This practice was derived from the antient Italians. Livy tells us, that the shouts of the Romans, in engaging the Carthaginians, so frightened the elephants of the enemy, that they turned back upon them.The troops rush on; the deaf'ning clamours rise, And the long shouts run echoing round the skies. 685. Strait, in a shell.] See the testudo described in note on ver. 559. B. 2.Strait, in a Subter testudine. shell, their shields the Volscians threw; And the close cohorts march, conceal'd from view, To fill the trenches which the camp surround, And tug th'aspiring bulwarks to the ground. Where thinly rang'd appear the op'ning pow'rs, They fix their scaling engines in the tow'rs. From far the Trojans missive weapons throw, And with tough poles repel the rising foe; Thus wont, of old, th'advancing Greeks to dare, And guard the ramparts in their ten years war. Long, with huge pointed stones, they strove in vain, To burst the cov'ring of the hostile train. Yet still the bands maintain the fight, below The brazen concave, and defy the foe. At length the Trojans, with a mighty shock, Roll'd down a pond'rous fragment of a rock; Full where the thick-embody'd squadron spreads, Th'enormous mass came thund'ring on their heads, Broke thro' the shining arch, and crush'd the train; And with a length of slaughter smok'd the plain. In this blind fight no more the foes engage, But with their darts a distant combat wage. There with a blazing pine Mezentius came, And tost within the works the dreadful flame; Tremendous chief!—while bold Messapus calls To scale the tow'rs; and thunders at the walls. Ye sacred nine, inspire me to record What numbers fell by Turnus' slaught'ring sword: What foes each hero.] ? Quem quisque virum demiserit orco. This is a translation of Homer's, ?????? ?? ???????? ????? ???? ????????. Virgil seems to have render'd the verb ???????? in this place, by demiserit; which in another place he renders by miserit. Therefore the Greek scholiasts upon Homer are mistaken, who interpret ???????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ?????????? ???????. Fulvius Ursinus.What foes each hero plung'd to hell, declare, Each death display, and open all the war! 715. Those mighty deeds.] Catrou understands by mecum ingentes oras evolvite belli, Conduct me to the end of the war; the expression is drawn from Ennius, Quis potis ingentes oras evolvere belli? Annal. B. 6.Those mighty deeds which you alone can know, Repeat, ye muses! to the world below. Full o'er the wall a turret rose on high, Stage above stage, unrivall'd, to the sky. This fort to gain, the Latians bend their care, Point their full strength, their whole collected war. Vast fragments from above the Trojans throw, And through the walls their jav'lins gaul the foe. A blazing torch the mighty Turnus flung; Close to the sides the flaming mischief hung; Then, thund'ring thro' the planks, in fury grew, Swell'd in the wind, and round the structure flew. With headlong speed th'imprison'd troops retire, Throng'd in huge heaps, before the spreading fire. While on one side their weight incumbent lay, The beams all burst, the crackling walls give way, The pond'rous pile comes tumbling to the ground, And all Olympus trembled at the sound. With the proud structure fall the Trojan train, Wrapp'd in the smoky ruins, to the plain. Their souls crush'd out, the warriors bury'd lie; Or on the points of their own lances die. Sav'd from the gen'ral fate, but two remain, And ah! those hapless two were sav'd in vain! Unbless'd Helenor, most advanc'd in years, At once encompast by the foe appears; 741. His beauteous slave.] Virgil and Apollonius Rhodius (whom Virgil imitates by an odd kind of affectation) attribute more bravery to the illegitimate brother (for they have both introduced two brothers) than to the legitimate one. Catrou.Him to the Lydian king, his beauteous slave Lycimnia bore; unfortunately brave. Tho' born of servile blood, the gen'rous boy In arms forbidden sought the wars of Troy. With glory fir'd he took the dang'rous field; 746. Light was his sword.] The original is, Ense levis nudo. There is a difference to be made (says Catrou) between those troops which were armed with a buckler and javelin, and those which were only armed with a sword. Virgil says above, speaking of a squadron of horse, tercentum scutati omnes: this was for distinction-sake. Helenor was a soldier lightly arm'd, levis, and had no weapon besides his sword; for the word nudo is here to be understood solo. It is true that he wore a round buckler, called parma; but he did not make use either of arrows, or a lance.Light was his sword; and unadorn'd his shield. At first with wild surprize the youth descry'd The gath'ring Latian troops on ev'ry side; Then (bent on death) where thick the jav'lins rise, Fierce on the close embattled war he flies. So the stern savage, whom the train surrounds Of shouting hunters, steeds, and op'ning hounds, On death determin'd, and devoid of fears, Springs forth undaunted on a grove of spears. But swifter Lycus urg'd his rapid way, Tho' jav'lins hiss, and swords around him play; Flies to the walls and battlements again, Leaps high, and reaches at his friends in vain. For close behind the furious Turnus flew: Fool! couldst thou hope to 'scape when I pursue, Tho' swifter than the wind? (aloud he cries) Then by the foot he seiz'd his trembling prize; And, as he hung aloft in dire dismay, Tugg'd him with half the shatter'd wall away. 765. So Jove's.] Helenor is compared to a tiger, or a leopard, who makes his way thro' the weapons of the hunters: Lycas is compared to an hare, or a lamb. These comparisons are proportion'd to the bravery of the one, and the cowardice of the other. Catrou.So Jove's imperial bird, thro' fields of air, Snatches the snowy swan or quiv'ring hare: So the grim prowling wolf, amidst her play, Leaps on the lamb, and rends the tender prey; Wild roams the bleating mother round the plain, Seeks, and laments her slaughter'd child in vain. Now with loud shouts they rend the tortur'd air, Fill the deep trench, and lay the bulwarks bare. Some load with hostile fires their vengeful hands, And at the turrets toss the blazing brands. As to the gates the bold Lucetius came, Tow'r'd in the front, and shook the waving flame; The great Ilioneus with vigour threw A rocky fragment, and the warrior slew. Young Liger's certain spear, Emathion sped; Asylas' shaft laid Chorinæus dead. Ortygius bleeds by Cæneus' fatal steel, But by great Turnus' hand the victor fell; Clonius with him, and Dioxippus falls, And hapless Idas, while he guards the walls. Sagar, the next, with Promulus was slain; And Capys stretch'd Privernus on the plain; First slightly wounded by Themilla's dart; (The shield thrown by) to mitigate the smart, His hand the warrior to the wound apply'd; Swift flew the second dart, and nail'd it to his side: Its fatal course thro' all his vitals held; And the pale corpse lay panting on the field. All-bright in arms, the son of Arcens stood, Bred in the grove of Mars the warrior god; 795. Palicus' loaded altars.] Palicus, or rather the Palici, were two brothers, whom the Sicilians rank'd among the gods; they were the sons of Jupiter and Thalia, one of the daughters of Vulcan; or rather of Vulcan himself, and the nymph Æthna. These Palici gave oracles, and were reputed, in doubtful matters, to have the power of distinguishing between the man who spoke truth, and the impostor. They were very favourable to the Sicilians during a famine, and ever afterwards their altars were loaded with gifts. Macrobius relates the history of the Palici at large, Saturn. B. 5. C. 19.From where Palicus' loaded altars flame, In gold and purple gay, the blooming hero came. Mezentius mark'd him, as he tow'r'd on high; Then seiz'd a sling, and laid the jav'lin by; Thrice whirl'd around, the whistling bullet threw; The glowing metal melted as it flew; Thro' both his temples cut its dreadful way; And, roll'd in dust, the beauteous warrior lay. 803. Then first in fight.] What Mr. Segrais has observ'd concerning the age of Ascanius, does not seem to be satisfactory. Dr. Trapp has, I think, adjusted the matter, whose words I shall transcribe. If the Æneis takes up no more than a year, how could Ascanius, who was a child carry'd in Venus's arms in the first book, be so wise a counsellor, and so considerable a warrior, in the ninth? Mr. Segrais answers the objection at large, in his last remark upon this book; and tho' what he says may be defended, yet I am not wholly of his opinion. He makes Ascanius betwixt thirteen and fourteen years of age, when he was at Carthage. But sure such an one must be too big a boy, and too near a man, to be carry'd to bed in arms, as this prince was by Venus; or kiss'd and dandled upon a lady's lap, as Cupid in his shape was by Dido. Nor is there any necessity of allowing him so many years at that time. It was seven years, says Mr. Segrais, since the destruction of Troy; and then he was big enough to walk by his father's side: this, continues he, cannot be said of a child in a cradle. True; but it may be said of a child of two years old: however, we will allow him three; so that at Carthage, he shall be ten; and in Italy, between ten and eleven. The caresses of Dido may well enough agree with that age; nor is there any thing in the idea, at all incongruous, or unnatural. Venus's carrying him in her arms, and laying him asleep, was upon an extraordinary occasion. At the same age, he might very well be considerable enough to be inform'd of the state of things by his father: Ascanio ferat hæc ? And strong and bold enough to ride a hunting: At puer Ascanius, mediis in vallibus, acri Gaudet Equo. ? And here in Italy, he may be suppos'd (as an extraordinary person, and the son of a demigod) to have discretion enough, to discourse, as he does, upon the expedition of Nisus and Euryalus; and strength and skill enough to draw a bow, and kill a man: the thing is possible; for the rest, it ought to be extraordinary, and was intended to be so.Then first in fight the young Ascanius bore His bow; employ'd on beasts alone before. His vengeful shafts a royal victim found, And stretch'd the bold Numanus on the ground. Not long before the haughty chief had led Brave Turnus' sister to his bridal bed: Now, of his high alliance vain and proud, He stalks before the troops, and vaunts aloud: What shame, ye Phrygians, ye twice-vanquish'd train, To lie beleaguer'd in your walls again! 813. In yon tow'rs.] Morti prætendere muros. Hence Milton's expression, ? Lest that too heav'nly form, pretended To hellish falshood, snare them. ? Par. L. 10. 872.All pale and trembling, in yon tow'rs to wait! That rise, ye cowards, between you and fate! Brave chiefs! bold heroes these!—who come so far To gain their brides by violence and war! From Troy what god, what madness, call'd you o'er, To fall and perish on a foreign shore? Far other foes than Atreus' sons appear; No crafty talking Ithacus is here. We plunge our infants in the hard'ning streams, And season in the frost their tender limbs. Our boys the forest range, and lead the course, Bend the tough bow, and break the prancing horse. Long thirst, long hunger, our bold youths can bear, Plow, fight, or shake embattled towns with war. We live in steel; in arms our hinds appear; And the turn'd jav'lin goads the lab'ring steer. Nor flags our gen'rous warmth, by years declin'd; Still flames the noble ardour of the mind. Ev'n the grave sire with martial vigour glows, And crushes with the casque his hoary brows. All, all, engag'd alike in warlike toils, Subsist on rapine, and divide the spoils. While you, the fugitives, the dregs of Troy, Your hours in pleasures and the dance employ: 837. Warm purple robes.] Homer originally makes use of this kind of scoff, Iliad ?. and Odyss. ?. Milton has put it likewise into the mouth of Satan, where he is speaking against Abdiel, and his party: I see that most thro' sloth had rather serve, Minist'ring spirits, train'd up in feast and song: Such hast thou arm'd, the minstrelsy of heaven. P. L. B. 6. 165.Warm purple robes defend (ye dastard bands!) Your heartless breasts and unperforming hands. Your female souls the manly form disgrace— Hence then, ye women, to your native place— Hence—to your Phrygian Dindymus away!— With eunuchs there on pipes and timbrels play! Go—the great mother's rites attend you there— But leave to men the bus'ness of the war. Thus while he spoke in scornful strains, no more The young Ascanius the proud boaster bore. 847. He fits an arrow.] Diversaque brachia ducens, in the original, very elegantly expresses the disposition of both arms in drawing a bow,He fits an arrow to the well-strung bow; But first to Jove address'd his solemn vow: My bold attempt, almighty sire, succeed; A milk-white heifer at thy shrine shall bleed; Majestic shall he stalk, and paw the ground, Push with his gilded horns, and spurn the sands around. He said—and, to the left, the sire on high Roll'd the big thunder thro' an azure sky. At once his twanging bow Ascanius drew, And, hissing fierce, the feather'd arrow flew; Nor flew the winged wrathful shaft in vain, But pierc'd his head, and stung him to the brain. 859. Go—and once more.] Trajicit. I, verbis virtutem illude superbis. It is remarkable, that we have here a very fair monkish rhyme. A learned critic thinks Virgil designed it, as proper for the mouth of a boy. But I am rather apt to think, that Virgil overlook'd it.Go—and once more a valiant race defy! Thus the twice vanquish'd Phrygians, thus reply. No more he said;—loud shouts and clamours rise; And transport lifts the Trojans to the skies. High on a cloud, inthron'd in open air, Apollo sat, and thence survey'd the war. Then to the conqu'ring royal boy he cries; Rise, glorious youth; in valour ever rise; Rise thus in time to heav'n's supreme abodes, 868. The son, and father.] The gods, from whom Ascanius was descended, were Jupiter the father of Dardanus, and Venus the mother of Æneas: the gods, to whom he was, as it were, to give birth, were Romulus, Julius Cæsar, and Augustus. Diis genite, &amp; geniture Deos, is beautifully concise.The son, and father, of a race of gods! 869. Who, great in arms.] Virgil (says Catrou) takes all opportunities of flattering Augustus. He makes Apollo predict, even in the time of Ascanius, the happiness which the world was to enjoy under this emperor; that he was to put an end to war throughout the world, and shut the temple of Janus. How sublime are those expressions of the Psalmist on the like subject! He maketh wars to cease thro' all the world; he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the spear asunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire. Psalm xlvi. ver. 9.Who, great in arms, victorious by their swords, Shall rule mankind, the world's majestic lords! Go—mount from fame to fame, auspicious boy; Proceed, and scorn the narrow bounds of Troy! He said; then down th'etherial road he flies With rapid speed, and cleaves the liquid skies; Assumes old Butes' figure and attire, Anchises' long-try'd friend and faithful squire In fields of old; and now the chief of Troy Had trusted to his care the royal boy. Like this sage guardian to the youth he came; His voice, his visage, and his arms, the same. Then to the victor boy aloud he cries; Enough, young warrior—Let it now suffice, That unreveng'd the great Numanus dies: Apollo, pleas'd thy first attempts to crown, Gives to thy bow the glories of his own: Now tempt no more the dangers of the war, Too daring youth—he said; and past in air, Past in a moment from his wond'ring eye; And the loose shape dissolv'd into the sky. The sounding shafts the leaders heard, o'er-aw'd With the loud quiver; and confest the god; Then urge the fiery youth, no more to dare, Since great Apollo's voice forbad the war. While, prodigal of life, to fight they fly, All nobly fixt, to conquer or to die; 896. And jav'lins.] By amenta we are to understand thongs, which were ty'd to a kind of javelin, and by which they were darted, and, as it were, slung out of the soldier's hand. Itaque (says De la Cerda) ut fundæ dicebantur torqueri, ita amenta. Catrou renders amenta, darts fix'd to long straps or thongs.Stones, spears, and jav'lins, from the works they flung; From tow'r to tow'r the shouts and clamours rung; Helms clash with helms, the rattling shields resound; Thick fly the darts, and cover all the ground; While loud the battle roars, and thunders all around: Thick, as from western clouds, all charg'd with rain, Pours the black storm, and smokes along the plain; Thick as the gather'd hail, tempestuous, flies O'er the wide main, and rattles down the skies, When all the frowning heav'ns are blacken'd o'er; 906. When Jove discharges.] A noble image is here represented of the Jupiter pluvius dispensing storms and tempests. This is utterly lost in Dryden's translation: Or patt'ring hail comes pouring o'er the main, When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain; Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound, And with an armed winter strew the ground.When Jove discharges all his wrathful store, And, deep from ev'ry cloud, the bursting thunders roar! 908. Pand'rus and Bitias.] Macrobius tells us, that this passage is taken from the 15th book of Ennius's annals. Virgil (says Fulvius Ursinus) has here, according to custom, express'd Homer's verses, in the words of Ennius. The passage of Ennius is lost.Pand'rus and Bitias at the portal stood, Two giant brethren, born in Ida's wood; From great Alcanor and Hiera sprung, The champions rose conspicuous o'er the throng. The mighty champions, of prodigious frame, Tow'r'd like the groves and mountains whence they came. Their prince, when parting from the Tuscan state, Appointed these, the guardians of the gate. Proud of their strength, the daring heroes throw Th'enormous folds wide-open to the foe. Within, all-bright in arms, on either hand Before the tow'rs the haughty warriors stand: On their bright helms sat horror plum'd; on high Their nodding crests float dreadful in the sky. 922. So where the fields.] Imitated from the 11th book of the Iliad. Mr. Dryden's two last lines of this comparison, are, to the last degree, mean and ridiculous. And overpress'd with nature's heavy load, Dance at the whist'ling winds, and at each other nod. This is something in the taste of a Pierrot dance. 922. Fair Athesis.] This is now called the river Adige; which rises in the Tirol, and discharges itself into the Adriatic sea.So where the fields fair Athesis divides, Or Po tumultuous rolls his swelling tides, With heads unshorn, two mighty oaks appear, Wave to the winds, and nod sublime in air! Soon as the foes an open entrance spy, The war breaks in; but soon their leaders fly, Repell'd by hosts; or in the portal die. Quercens, Equicolus all-bright in steel, Hæmon and daring Tmarus, fled, or fell. To dire extremes the rising rage proceeds; The slaughter swells, and the fierce battle bleeds. No more imprison'd in their walls they wait; All Troy at once came pouring to the gate: Now, flush'd with blood, in bold excursion far Rush the stern bands, and mix in closer war. But in a distant quarter long engag'd, Amidst the foes the Daunian hero rag'd: When to the prince a messenger relates, That Troy had open'd wide her massy gates; And, heaps on heaps, the late-imprison'd train Broke forth, and stretch'd the slaughter o'er the plain. This heard, with fury sparkling in his eyes, Fierce to engage the giant chiefs he flies. First, by his lance, Antiphates lay dead, Sarpedon's off-spring by a Theban bed; The whizzing lance, with all his force address'd, Transfixt the foe, and panted in his breast: Warm'd in the lungs the heaving jav'lin stood; Wide gapes the wound, and pours a purple flood. Now Erymanthus, now brave Merops fell; Then sunk Aphydnus to the shades of hell. Next, while he threats revenge with fiery eyes, Beneath the chief the mighty Bitias dies: No vulgar lance the valiant victor tost (In that huge bulk a vulgar lance was lost): A strong, vast, weighty spear, the hero threw, 958. A spear that roar'd.] Catrou renders phalarica, pertuisane, a kind of halberd. Servius tells us, it is a vast dart, with a turned handle; its iron is a cubit long, above which is a kind of ball plated with lead; this sometimes is wrapp'd round with pitch and tow, for firing buildings, &amp;c. with this dart they us'd to fight from a sort of turrets called phalæ. Hence, in the circus, the divisions between the euripi and the metæ, are called phalæ; because turrets were there erected, from whence they fought with this weapon. Juvenal says, Consulit arte phalas, delphinorumque columnas. Hence hasta phalarica, as hasta muralis. It is plain from Lucan, that the phalarica was thrown by slings, or some machine: Hunc aut tortilibus vibrata phalarica nervis Obruat. But Virgil tells us, that Turnus threw it simply with his hand: whence it appears (continues Servius), that this is said by Lucan, to shew that the man aim'd at, was killed in a more violent manner; and that Virgil means to extol Turnus's strength, by saying that he threw it with his hand.A spear that roar'd like thunder as it flew. Not two bull-hides, within the buckler roll'd, Nor double pond'rous plates, and scales of gold, Th'impetuous weapon, wing'd with death, could stay; But stretch'd in dust the giant warrior lay: As the huge champion falls, the fields resound, And his broad buckler thunders on the ground. 965. So from the Baian mole.] Now called Castella di Baia, in the Terra Lavora. It was the place the Romans chose for their winter retreat; and which they frequented upon account of its warm baths. Some few ruins of the beautiful villas that once covered this delightful coast, still remain; and nothing can give one an higher idea of the prodigious expence and magnificence of the Romans in their private buildings, than the manner in which some of these were situated. It appears from a letter of Pliny, book 9. and from several other passages in the classic writers, that they actually projected into the sea; being erected upon vast piles sunk for that purpose. Virgil draws a beautiful simile from this custom, where he compares the massy speak which Turnus let fly at Bitias, to one of those enormous piles thrown into the Baian sea. Melmoth's notes to his elegant translation of Pliny's epistles, p. 510. Perhaps Virgil may mean the sinking the piles upon which the buildings at Baiæ were to be erected, rather than the fall of any edifice already built.So from the Baian mole, whose structures rise High o'er the flood, a massy fragment flies; The rapid rolling pile all-headlong sweeps, With one vast length of ruin, to the deeps; Thick boil the billows; and on ev'ry side, Work the dark sands, and blacken all the tide. 971. The shores of Prochyta resound.] Prochyta alta tremit is difficult enough to be understood. Alta could not be used as an epithet for that island; because it is all one flat: and to understand it of its trembling deeply, or to its foundations, is scarce a true Virgilian way of speaking. Perhaps there was a pharos, or high light-house on that island formerly; and the island itself might be called high from its pharos appearing at such an height, and shewing it at a great distance. The same epithet is used by Ausonius, in speaking of a vale near the Moselle; who adds five or six lines to tell his reader, that he calls that vale high on account of the pharos standing upon it. Tho' I don't know any writer, that mentions the little island of Prochyta's having ever had a pharos on it, 'tis certain, at least that pharos's were common in that part of the Tyrrhene sea. Pliny, Nat. Hist. l. 36. c. 12. speaks of a very considerable one at Puzzuoli: Statius Sylv. lib. 3. 5. 10. of another in the island of Capreæ, which fell down a few days before the death of Tiberius, Sueton. in Tiber. c. 74. And Seneca says there were several destroyed thereabouts a few days after: Vastavit ignis colles, per quos elucebat. Erosit quondam altissimos vertices, solatia navigantium, ac speculas ad humilem arenam deduxit, lib. 14. epist. 92. Spence.The trembling shores of Prochyta resound, And burning Arime shakes wide around; The mass, by Jove, o'er huge Typhœus spread; The giant hears the peal; and, seiz'd with dread, Starts, turns, and bellows on his fiery bed. Now Mars himself inspires the Latian band, Warms ev'ry heart, and strengthens ev'ry hand; And, while he turns their trembling foes to fight, The kindling legions gather to the sight; Danger nor death their furious course controuls, And all the god came rushing on their souls! His brother slain when Pandarus beheld, And saw the changing fortune of the field, He sets his ample shoulders to the weight, And turns th'enormous hinges of the gate; But left, unmindful, as the folds he clos'd, A croud of friends to certain death expos'd; And, with himself, includes the trembling train Of troops, who rush'd tumultuous from the plain. Fool! not to see the dreadful Turnus there, Mix'd with the crouds amidst the flying war; But in the walls the furious chief to hold, 993. Like some fierce tyger.] This puts me in mind of a simile conceived in the genuine spirit of the antients, where Spencer represents the gods looking on Mutability with surprize, ? Like a sort of steers 'Mongst whom some beast of strange and foreign race Unwares is chanc'd, far straying from his peers. Fa. Qu. B. 7. C. 6. St. 28.Like some fierce tyger midst the trembling fold! 994. Loud clash.] This is prodigiously noble: one would have thought that as he was shut in single among his enemies, his courage should, at first at least, have failed him: But instead of that, Continuo nova lux oculis effulsit, &amp; arma Horrendum sonuere, &amp;c. I cannot help observing, that the spirit of the original is fully kept up by the translator. If it be objected, that this, with what follows, is more noble than probable; we must consider, first, that it is allowable to paint bigger than the life: Secondly, that this hero, in his amazing exploits, is assisted by a divine power. Juno vires animumque ministrat. Trapp.Loud clash his arms; and, as he tow'rs on high, Flash the keen flames from his tremendous eye; Nods his proud crest, and formidably plays; And from his shield the streamy lightnings blaze. Too soon, with dire surprize, the Trojans know The dreadful front of their victorious foe. Strait fir'd with vengeance for his brother slain, Springs forth fierce Pandarus, and thus began: Behold the Trojan camp, a fatal scene! No bridal palace of the Latian queen, No native Ardea, prince, you here descry, But hostile walls; and 'tis in vain to sly. In that vast bulk if any soul reside, Come, try thy might (the prince sedate reply'd); Go, and old Priam's trembling spirit tell, A new Achilles plung'd thy soul to hell. Then, first, his knotted spear the Trojan threw; Rough with the bark the pond'rous weapon flew; But mighty Juno caus'd it far to glance, And in the portal fixt the quiv'ring lance. But hope not thou to 'scape this sword of mine, Aim'd by a surer, stronger hand than thine, The hero cry'd—Then flies against the foe With the bright blade; and rises to the blow; Sudden the sword tempestuous cleaves in twain 1019. His cheeks.] Impubes malas. Servius observes, there is a pathos produced by the epithet impubes. Pathos ex ætate movit.His cheeks, and sinks deep-bury'd in the brain. Distain'd with blood, his clashing arms resound, And, as he fell, he shook the purpled ground: There, as the mighty bulk lay stretch'd along, In equal shares the parted visage hung. Pale with new horror at the dreadful sight, On ev'ry side the Trojans urge their flight. Then had the victor broke the barriers down, And call'd his social troops to storm the town, That day had seen their warlike labours o'er; And ruin'd Troy had been a name no more. But the mad chief with boundless slaughter glows, And rage insatiate drives him on the foes. First, valiant Phalaris; next, Gyges fell; Deep thro' his knee he drove the pointed steel. Then from the dead the reeking darts he drew, And in their backs transfix'd the flying crew. New strength, new courage, Juno still supply'd; And now brave Halys and great Phegeus dy'd: 1038. Alcander, Prytanis.] Alcandrumque, Haliumque, Noemonaque, Prytanimque. This is an echo to Homer's line, Iliad B. 5. ????????? ??, ???????, ?????????, ??????????. By which it appears, say Servius, that these names are not real, and taken from history, but introduced merely to fill up the poem, ad ornatum poematis.Alcander, Prytanis, Noëmon fall, With warlike Halius, on th'embattled wall, High on the works engag'd in other fight— Next flew his flaming faulchion to the right, And struck bold Lynceus as he call'd around For aid, and brav'd him on the lofty mound. 1044. At one just stroke.] Cum galea longe jacuit caput. To express the quickness of this action, Virgil makes use of the preterperfect tense, jacuit. Servius.At one just stroke his head and helmet fly Before the sword, and far at distance lie. Then fierce, on Amycus the warrior came, Whose fatal arrow pierc'd the savage game; Who dipp'd th'envenom'd steel with matchless art, And doubly arm'd with death the pointed dart. Next Clytius fell, tho' sprung of race divine; Soft Cretheus last, the darling of the nine; Well was he skill'd, in sacred strains to sing, Tune the sweet lyre, and sweep the trembling string; 1054. Arms, and the toils.] Virgil hints, that this poet and musician did not employ his art in celebrating low and indecent subjects, but those of a sublime and noble nature. Donatus. Upon this account we are more concerned for his death. This puts me in mind of the following fine passage in Glover's Leonidas: Him Dithyrambus lov'd, a sacred bard, Rever'd for justice, for his verse renown'd, Which sung the deeds of heroes, those who fell, Or those who conquer'd, in their country's cause, Th'inraptur'd soul inflaming with the thirst Of glory won by virtue—His high strain The muses favour'd from their neighb'ring groves, And bless'd with heav'nly melody his lyre. No more from Thespia shall his feet ascend The shady steep of Helicon. Book 4. v. 213.Arms, and the toils of heroes, to recite, The plunging furious steeds, and thunder of the fight. Now heard the chiefs, who led the Trojan band, What numbers fell by Turnus' conqu'ring hand; Fierce they advance; when soon appear in sight The slaught'ring hero, and their troops in flight. And where? (great Mnestheus rais'd his voice on high) Where, to what other ramparts would you fly? Shall one, and he inclos'd within your wall, One rash, imprison'd warrior vanquish all? With rage resistless, half an host destroy; And open ev'ry bleeding vein of Troy? Calm you look on, and see the furious foe Plunge crouds of heroes to the shades below: Still shall your king, ye base abandon'd train, Your country, and your gods, demand your aid in vain? Rous'd by these words, they rally from afar, Breathing revenge, and gath'ring to the war: The Daunian chief shrinks backward from the foes, Where round the works the mighty river flows: The Trojans shout; and, with new transport fir'd, Rush on embody'd, as the prince retir'd. As when with tilted spears the clam'rous train Invade the brindled monarch of the plain, The lordly savage from the shouting foe Retires, majestically stern, and slow. Tho' singly impotent the croud to dare, Repel, or stand their whole collected war; Grim he looks back; he rolls his glaring eye; Despairs to conquer; and disdains to fly. 1084. So Turnus.] The retreat of Turnus is noble: tho' attack'd by the whole army of the Trojans, he doth not fly, but moves off by degrees; and still keeps up his courage, till he perceives himself deserted by Juno.So Turnus paus'd; and by degrees retir'd; While shame, disdain, and rage, the hero fir'd. Yet twice, ev'n then, he flew amid the train, And twice he chas'd them o'er their walls again. But now from all the camp their forces ran Full on the chief; an army on a man! Nor longer heav'n's great empress from on high Dares with new strength th'exhausted prince supply: For winged Iris from the realms above Brought the severe decree of angry Jove, That bad, with threats, th'imperial queen recal Her favour'd hero from the Trojan wall. Now his tir'd arm refus'd the sword to wield; Now flew the darts, and planted all his shield. 1098. The stones.] The whole description is copied from Homer, Iliad 16. Ennius has a passage like this: lib. Ann. 15. See Mr. Pope's Note in loc. Undique conveniunt, velut imber, tela tribuno: Confligunt parmam; tinnit hastilibus umbo Ærato sonitu galeæ: sed nec pote quisquam Undique nitendo corpus discerpere ferro. Semper abundantes hastas frangitque quatitque: Totum sudor habet corpus, multumque laborat. Nec respirandi fit copia præpete ferro. Histri tela manu jacientes solicitabant. Tasso imitates it, B. 9. 97. Meantime the soldan in this latest charge, Had done as much as human force was able: All sweat and blood appear'd his members large, His breath was short, his courage wax'd unstable; His arm grew weak to bear his mighty targe, His hand to rule his heavy sword unable: Which bruis'd, not cut, so blunted was the blade, It lost the use for which a sword was made. Fairfax.The stones now rattle; now the jav'lins sing, Indent his arms, and on his helmet ring. A thousand weapons round his temples lay, And strike the honours of his crest away. Thick and more thick the foes their lances sped, With mighty Mnestheus thund'ring at their head. Pale, breathless, faint, and black with dust, in streams The sweat descends from all his trembling limbs. Arm'd as he was (thus press'd on ev'ry side), He plung'd at last, undaunted, in the tide. The sacred river, for the welcome load, Spreads his wide arms, and wafts him down the flood: The hero to his host the surges bear, Cleans'd from the horrid stains of slaughter, blood, and war. THE TENTH BOOK. Those who have carefully perused these last books of the Æneid cannot doubt of the valour of Æneas, as I have already observed; for in these, the poet omits nothing that belongs to the wisdom of a great general, or the courage of a brave soldier, to make the character of his hero complete. I have likewise remarked, how much these matters, tho' similar in general, are nevertheless different in the detail. For tho' these three books contain in general only combats, yet how different are these combats the one from the other? And even how different are the wounds, the deaths, and the surprising events, which happen in this war? This tenth book chiefly is that, wherein the peripeties are the most beautiful. Aristotle, according to F. Mambrun, defines this part of a poem to be, A change of things into their contraries, which happens either probably or necessarily. For tho' the epic writers ought to make use of peripeties more sparingly than the writers of romance, it would nevertheless be a great defect in their works, if these changes were not sometimes to be found there; for instance, if a poet was to represent the party of his hero always triumphant, and every where victorious. Virgil distributes with so much address the favours of fortune, that one cannot enough admire his conduct throughout this whole book. If Æneas conquers on his side, Turnus likewise performs several brave exploits on his. This last kills the young Pallas; who had just killed Halesus, one of the principal leaders, and some other of the bravest, of the Latin army. Æneas immediately hastens to revenge the death of Pallas, and kills Lausus and Mezentius. But as the single combat of Turnus and Æneas must make the unravelling of the poem, the address of the poet is worthy observation; who makes use of the mediation of Juno, to hinder these two men, who were so brave, and so much animated one against the other, from meeting. For without doubt, according to the rules of probability, they should seek for each other; and it would be difficult, that they should not meet, as they are so desirous of it. The complaints of Turnus in the vessel which carries him off, and the two harangues of Juno and Venus, are master-pieces of eloquence: and all that passes in the deaths of Lausus and Mezentius is described with great art. Segrais. The Argument. Jupiter calls a council of the gods, and forbids them to engage in either party. At the return of Æneas there is a bloody battle. Turnus kills Pallas: Æneas, Lausus and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. 1. Now wide unfold.] Dr. Trapp translates omnipotentis everlasting; and remarks, that he could think of no better word to answer it: for it cannot (continues he) be properly translated. Some think that by Olympus is meant Jupiter, and then omnipotentis must be taken in its proper sense. But if by the former be meant heaven; either the latter must be a metonymy (omnipotent heaven, because the omnipotent deity inhabits it), or it is called so, because, according to the heathen doctrine, the influence of the heavenly bodies commands every thing below. Dr. Trapp is for this last, because, in another place, Virgil distinguishes Jupiter from heaven, even where this epithet is added to it: ? Rex omnipotentis Olympi. B. 11. ver. 791. The conciseness of, Considunt tectis bipatentibus, ? and afterwards of, ? Incipit ipse, is very grand. Now wide unfold th'eternal gates of Jove: Th'etherial king convenes the pow'rs above. Beneath his eye, both hosts, in full survey, The spacious world, and vast creation lay; There in the starry courts, inthron'd on high, State the majestic senate of the sky, Rank'd by degrees, along the bright abodes; To whom the king of men, and father of the gods; What discord fires your minds, celestial train? Why was our sacred mandate urg'd in vain? Did not your sov'reign lord his will declare, That Troy and Latium should not wage the war? Why are we disobey'd? What vain alarms Inflame their souls to slaughter, blood, and arms? The destin'd time will wing its fatal way, (Nor need your rage anticipate the day) 17. When Carthage.] Cum fera Carthago Romanis arcibus olim Exitium magnum, atque Alpes immittet apertas. He alludes to Hannibal's forcing his way thro' the Alps, which were (as Livy says) muri vice to Italy. No more can be implied by the word exitium than that Hannibal drove the Romans into very great streights. Dr. Trapp thinks, that we ought to understand by Alpes the inhabitants of the Alps; the place for the people, as ultima Bactra, B. 8. And the word apertas (says he) is added to insinuate the image of Hannibal's bursting them, or opening his way thro' them. Juvenal says of Hannibal, ? Montem rupit aceto. Sat. 10. Our translator strongly expresses what is meant by Apertas, Break the strong Alpine adamantine chains.When Carthage, with her proud victorious pow'rs, Shall burst, like thunder, o'er the Roman tow'rs, Break the strong Alpine adamantine chains, Pour down the hills, and deluge all the plains. Then, with full licence, your unbounded hate And stern revenge may crush the Trojan state. Till then, ye pow'rs, from wrath and discord cease, And let the nations join in leagues of peace. Thus, from the throne, in short, almighty Jove; And thus, at large, the beauteous queen of love: 27. O fire of men.] The art and address which Venus makes use of in her speech, is, finely contrasted by the haughtiness which runs thro' that of Juno. Venus begins with the greatest reverence and modesty, O pater, O hominum, &amp;c. &amp;c. Juno begins like a fury, ? Quid me alta silentia cogis Rumpere? ? This abrupt beginning, in the middle of a verse, is quite in character.O sire of men below, and gods on high! (For to what other pow'r can Venus fly?) Dost thou not see yon fierce Rutulian train? With what success proud Turnus sweeps the plain! Rapt by his steeds, triumphant on his car, The dreadful hero rules the storm of war. Not walls can guard my Trojans now from fate; For, lo! grim slaughter rages in the gate! With hostile bands the walls are cover'd o'er, And the deep trenches float with tides of gore! My son is absent, while his subjects bleed; But must we never from a siege be freed? For, lo, great sire! a second army falls On rising Troy, and thunders at her walls. In Latian fields against the Dardan train, Behold the stern Tydides rise again! Sprung tho' I am from thee, prepar'd I stand To bleed once more—and by a mortal hand! Yet, if against thy will the Phrygian host Have left their Troy, and sought the Latian coast, Withdraw thy potent aid, O sov'reign god! And bid the guilty nation mourn in blood! But since so many signs their course compel, The voice of heav'n, and oracles of hell; Why dares another pow'r thy will debate, Or thwart th'unalterable course of fate? Her boundless vengeance why should I repeat? How on Sicilian shores she fir'd the fleet? How she dispatch'd to yonder world below, With that dire charge, the goddess of the bow? How the grim tyrant of th'Æolian reign Let loose th'imprison'd whirlwinds o'er the main? Hell and th'infernal pow'rs were yet untry'd; All hell now arms, and rises on her side. The fiends, the furies, range the realms above, And act well worthy of the queen of Jove! Thro' all the Latian towns Alecto flies, And her black visage blasts the golden skies! No hopes of empire now my thoughts employ (These were my hopes, when fortune smil'd on Troy). Let Troy and Latium fight on yonder plains, And fall or conquer as thy will ordains: Since to the Phrygian race your haughty spouse No spot, no corner, of the world allows. Yet I implore thy grace, almighty sire, By ruin'd Troy, yet smoking from the fire! Give me, at least, the royal youth to bear (My dear Ascanius) from the rage of war! (And let the father, where your vengeful bride Or fortune points, still wander o'er the tide!) Th'Idalian realm and Amathus are mine; Cythera fair, and Paphos the divine; There he may live defended from the foes, Lost to the charms of fame, in soft repose. Then to Ausonia let proud Carthage come, And hold that empire once decreed to Rome, O'er the wide world extend her boundless pow'r; Our hopes, and Jove's own promises, no more! What now avails it, that my godlike heir Broke thro' the hostile fires, and 'scap'd the war; Led my poor exiles to the Latian plain, And rais'd a city, doom'd to fall again; What has it now avail'd him, to withstand 90. Th'exhausted dangers.] As she began with moving pity, so she concludes. Servius observes, that it is one of the grand rules in rhetoric, to handle the exordium and peroration after the same manner: Ut epilogi &amp; principia pari argumentatione tractentur. This same rule is likewise observed in Juno's speech.Th'exhausted dangers both of sea and land? His lot were happier, had he scorn'd a crown, And slumber'd o'er his ruin'd native town. 93. O! give their Xanthus.] The conclusions of both speeches are as remarkable as the beginnings: ? Xanthum &amp; Simoenta Redde, oro, miseris! iterumque revolvere casus Da, pater, Iliacos Teucris! The humblest and lowest petition (says Dr. Trapp) which could be conceived. How differently does Juno conclude! Tunc decuit metuisse tuis; nunc sera querelis Haud justis assurgis, &amp; irrita jurgia jactas. In those last words (says Dr. Trapp) irrita jurgia jactas, the very cadence of them tells us, that she strikes her hands one against another, and sits down in the same abrupt rage with which she rose. They are distinguished too by this circumstance; that Venus all along applies herself to Jupiter; and reflects upon Juno only in the third person; and that too, but once, only by hints and insinuations; and when she does name her, 'tis as softly, tho' as invidiously, as possible: Si nulla est regio, Teucris quam det tua conjux. Juno attacks her in person.O! give their Xanthus to the wretched train, Give them their Simois, with their wars again! Let Greece in arms her vengeful hosts employ Ten long years more, and storm a second Troy! To whom, with fury sparkling in her eyes, Reply'd the haughty empress of the skies: And why, say, why, O goddess! am I prest To wake the wrath, that slumber'd in my breast? What god, or mortal, bad your son declare, Against the Latian lord, so rash a war? Suppose, fate call'd him to the Latian plains, Or (far more likely) mad Cassandra's strains! Say, did we bid him leave his town behind, And trust the mercy of the sea and wind? Commit the war, and his forsaken Troy, To such an head, an unexperienc'd boy? To court the Tuscans, and with vain alarms To rouse whole nations from repose to arms? What god, or what perverse intent of ours Mov'd the wise prince to leave his rising tow'rs? Say, does the goddess of the bow appear, Or the keen spite of vengeful Juno, here? 'Tis hard, you urge, the Latians should conspire To wrap th'unfinish'd walls of Troy in fire; That Turnus lives, and holds his native place (And yet he sprung from our immortal race): Was it less hard, that Troy embattled came, To waste the Latian lands with sword and flame? O'er foreign realms to propagate her sway, Join fraud to force, and bear their spoils away? From their own lords the plighted brides to tear? To proffer peace, and yet to wage the war? You, from the foe, your darling son could shroud, And, for a man, present a figur'd cloud. You from your navy could the fires restrain, And change your ships to Nereids of the main. Yet in her friends defence is Juno seen? 'Tis a high crime in Jove's imperial queen! Your son, belike, is absent, while the foe Invades his tow'rs;—and let him still be so!— Cythera's isle, and Amathus, are yours; The Paphian realms, and soft Idalian shores. Why shouldst thou then to fights a race incline, Long since inur'd to rougher wars than thine? Did we conspire your empire to destroy? Did we urge vengeful Greece to ruin Troy? We?—or your Paris? your adult'rous boy? Who did that black destructive crime inspire? Who fann'd the flame, that set two worlds on fire? Did the lewd youth, at Juno's call, convey, From injur'd Sparta's walls, his beauteous prey? Did we procure? did we retain the fair? And, for his lust, support a ten years war? Then, partial goddess, then had been your time, To fear for Troy, on that perfidious crime; But now, too late, unjustly you complain, Now vent your anger, and your grief, in vain. Thus spoke the wrathful queen; the gods divide, And in mixt murmurs vote on the either side: 152. So, pent in woods, &amp;c.] Milton has finely improved upon this hint: He scarce had finish'd, when such murmur fill'd Th'assembly, as when hollow rocks retain The sound of blust'ring winds, which all night long Had rous'd the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull Sea-faring men, o'erwatch'd; whose bark, by chance, Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay, After the tempest: such applause was heard As Mammon ended. ? Par. L. B. 2. ver. 284So, pent in woods, at first with sullen sound The wind, low-murm'ring, rolls, the forest round; A dreadful signal to the naval train, Of the loud storms impending o'er the main. Then spoke th'almighty father, as he sate Inthron'd in gold, and clos'd the great debate. 158. Th'attentive winds.] This is truly sublime, but it is taken from Ennius, in Scipione: Mundus cœli vastus constitit silentio; Et Neptunus sævus undis asperis pausam dedit: Sol equis iter repressit ungulis volitantibus: Constitêre amnes perennes, arbores vento vacant.(Th'attentive winds a solemn silence keep; The wond'ring waves lie level on the deep; Earth to her centre shook; high heav'n was aw'd; And all th'immortal thrones stood trembling at the god.) Hear then our sacred will, ye pow'rs above; And mark th'unalterable word of Jove. Since you refuse to bid your discord cease, And join the nations in the bonds of peace; Whatever schemes or hopes the parties frame, Latium and Troy to Jove are both the same; Whether in yon fierce leaguer 'tis decreed That hapless Ilion, or Hesperia, bleed. The stern Rutulians too their toils shall know, And ev'ry hand shall work its weal or woe. Your king, inclin'd to neither side, shall wait The great event, and leave the whole to fate. This by his brother's awful floods he swore, That thro' the black infernal regions roar; Gave the dread signal of the solemn nod, With his bent brows; the sanction of the god! From sky to sky the strong concussion rolls; And all Olympus trembled to the poles. Thus did the sire the high contention close; Then from the throne majestically rose; With him at once the sacred senate rise, And to his palace wait the sov'reign of the skies. Meanwhile, at ev'ry gate, the Latian pow'rs Croud to destroy their foes, and fire the tow'rs. By hosts surrounded, in despair to fly, Close in their trench, the helpless Trojans lie. Yet some undaunted on the ramparts stand, And guard the works; a brave, but slender band. There, sprung from Imbrasus, bold Asius shone: Thymoetes next, fam'd Hicetaon's son. The dread Assaraci their succour bring; With them, two brothers of the Lycian king. Thybris and Castor next, a martial pair, Full in the front repel the rising war. These Acmon join'd, from fair Lyrnessus' shore; With all his strength a broken rock he bore: He match'd his brother Mnestheus' wondrous might, And his great father Clytius in the fight. Some, pond'rous stones, some, pointed jav'lins aim, And gaul the foe with shafts, or missive flame. 202. Amid the train.] How artfully is this graceful description of the appearance of Ascanius introduced, amidst the more tumultuous and ruder scenes of the battle! He is represented bare headed (says Donatus), because he was forbidden by Apollo to fight; Caput detectus, i. e. non pugnaturus. Some commentators think, that Virgil alluded to the custom of the Romans, who were always bare-headed, but during the Saturnalia. I rather think, from the description that follows immediately, that he is painted bare-headed, to make the more graceful appearance.Amid the train, bright Venus' darling care, Ascanius shone; his beauteous head was bare; A golden chain constrains his locks, that deck, In glossy sable curls, his lovely neck: So shines a gem, illustrious to behold, On some fair virgin's neck, enchas'd in gold: So the surrounding ebon's darker hue Improves the polish'd ivory to the view, Thee too, stern Ismarus, O chief divine! A great descendant of the Lydian line, (Born where the peasants turn the costly mould, Enrich'd by bright Pactolus' tides of gold) The hosts admir'd; while fierce thy twanging bow Discharg'd thy poison'd arrows at the foe. Brave Capys next succeeds, a chief of fame, From whom proud Capua since deriv'd her name. Great Mnestheus clos'd the band, of high renown, Since late he cast bold Turnus from the town. These all the rigid toils of fight sustain; Meantime, by night, their gen'ral plows the main. For when the prince had left th'Arcadian coast, And sought the leader of the Lydian host; With pray'rs declar'd his bus'ness, race, and name, And with what force their vengeful tyrant came; How the Rutulian rag'd; what turns of fate And chance of war attend the mortal state; Strait with the league propos'd the chief complies, And joins his forces to his new allies. Now, uncontroul'd by fate, the martial train, Led by a foreign hero, cleave the main. In pomp, before, Æneas' gally past; His lofty stern the Phrygian lions grac'd; 234. Her sculptur'd Ide.] The Roman poets scarce say any thing in a personal manner of mount Ida; unless possibly Virgil may be understood in that manner, where he is speaking of the figures wrought in the fore-part of Æneas's ship, Imminet Ida super, &amp;c. Spence's Polymet. Dial. 15. B. 8.There, banish'd Troy's delight, her sculptur'd Ide, Hangs o'er the foamy surge, and shades the tide. Here sate the chief with various thoughts opprest, The fate of war revolving in his breast; Close by his side th'Arcadian prince inquires Of the swift motions of the heav'nly fires; What seas he measur'd; and what lands he sought; What storms he suffer'd, and what fields he fought, 242. Ye muses! now unlock your sacred spring.] I have observed concerning the Catalogue in B. VII. how different this is from that. Macrobius has made an objection to Virgil, upon the subject of the catalogue in this tenth book. He thinks, that Virgil ought not to have made it without order, as we see it is; and that Homer, having treated of the same thing, passes from one subject to another, according to the neighbourhood of the countries whose inhabitants he has celebrated. Instead of which, Virgil has not observed any rule, but jumps from one subject to another, without any manner of exactness. A certain Jesuit takes Virgil's part on this subject, and justifies him by the example of Thucydides; who, tho' he is an historian, and consequently more ty'd down to the regularity which Macrobius wishes for, has followed it no more than Virgil in many of his descriptions.—This example does not seem to me sufficient for the defence of Virgil; for if he has done wrong, it will be no excuse that Thucydides had done so before him, since we see that Dionysius Halicarnasseus blames Thucydides for this fault. But we may remark, that as the poet seeks to ravish his reader, and above all aims at the beauty of surprize, it is not necessary that he should confine himself to that exactness, which would be of no ornament, but on the contrary, by discovering his own artifice, would take off all the surprize from his narration, so that he would interest the reader the less. For as we observed in Rem. VIII. B. VI. If Virgil had placed in a genealogical order all those heroes, which Anchises celebrates in his prediction, this prediction had been less pleasing. It would be the same with this catalogue; if those who are there mentioned, were ranged according to the order of their respective places, the reader would prevent the artifice of the poet; and would find fewer graces in such an arrangement, than what he finds in this miscellaneous manner, which nevertheless, as we may observe, is without disorder or confusion. Segrais.Ye muses! now unlock your sacred spring, Inspire the bard, and teach him how to sing, What ships, what heroes, what auxiliar hosts, Sail'd with Æneas from the Tuscan coasts. The Tiger first the foamy flood divides, And bears a thousand warriors thro' the tides, Who came beneath great Massicus' command, From Cosa's turrets, and the Clusian land. Close to their sides their polish'd quivers sate; Strung were their bows; their arrows wing'd with fate. Six hundred move beneath fierce Abas' care, From Populonia to the field of war. Rich in her endless beds of steely ore, The rugged Ilva sends three hundred more; All, train'd to fight; all, glorious to behold; And, on the stern, Apollo flam'd in gold. With groves of waving spears, in thick array, From Pisa's walls a thousand took their way; They march embattled from the Tuscan land, And great Asylas leads the martial band; Asylas, skilful sage! whose piercing eyes Discern'd all signs on earth, or in the skies. His heart from entrails certain omens drew, From stars, and birds, and lightnings as they flew. Next beauteous Astur plow'd the watry field, Proud of his bounding steed and sculptur'd shield; From where old Pyrgus' lofty turrets rise, And rank Graviscan marshes taint the skies, Where Cære groan'd beneath Mezentius' reign, And gurgling Minio glitters o'er the plain; Three hundred march beneath the leader's care, Breathing revenge, and eager all for war. Nor thou unsung, brave Cinyras, shalt pass, The martial chief of the Ligurian race; Nor thou, Cupavo, under whose command, Advanc'd to fight a small, but valiant band. White plumes adorn thy crest, and wave above, Expressive of thy Cycnus. sire, transform'd by love. While for his Phaeton his sorrows flow, And soft harmonious strains beguile his woe; While in the dusky poplar grove he made His melting moans, beneath the sisters shade, O'er all the man the snowy feathers rise, And in a tuneful swan he mounts the skies. Now his great off-spring, with his social train, In the huge Centaur plow'd the roaring main. High on the prow the figur'd monster stood, And shook a rocky fragment o'er the flood. The sounding keel the thronging waves disjoin'd, That foam, and whiten, in long tracks behind. 292. Next, warlike Ocnus, &amp;c.] Ocnus built the walls of Mantua; but the colony for whom he built them were by far more antient than his time. This colony was originally made up of Thebans (says Servius) afterwards re inforced by the Tuscans, and lastly by the Gauls, or, as some will have it, by the Sarsinates. This mixture of different nations is implied in the non genus omnibus unum; and hence too the genus illi [Mantuæ] triplex is made out. By the populi sub gente quaterni is to be understood, that beside the city of Mantua, there were three other cities in the Mantuan territories all respectively govern'd by their lucumones, or petty kings; of all these Mantua was the chief,—Ipsa caput populis. But tho' Mantua was composed of three different lucumonies or nations, yet the mightiest of them all were the Tuscans, Tusco de sanguine vires. Thus Virgil in four lines has sketch'd out the present state, and the complicated genealogy, of his country. The Ocnus above-mentioned is Bianor, whose tomb is spoken of in the third eclogue, ? Jamque sepulchrum Incipit apparere Bianoris. ? See Servius and Catrou in loc.Next warlike Ocnus brought his troops along, From prescient Manto and great Tyber sprung; By him, fair Mantua rose; immortal town! And from his mother's name deriv'd her own. Her mighty walls, illustrious founders grace, Of diff'rent countries, and a diff'rent race. Three tribes distinct possess her fertile lands, And four fair cities ev'ry tribe commands. Proud of her Tuscan line, with glory crown'd, She reigns the mistress of the nations round. Next, gen'rous hate to stern Mezentius draws Five hundred more, in freedom's sacred cause. Where, crown'd with reeds, the Mincio takes his course. From old Benacus' venerable source, In one vast ship he pours the warlike train, Down thro' his native chanel to the main. Fierce for revenge, the great Auletes guides Th' enormous bulk, that labours thro' the tides. An hundred pines the boiling ocean sweep, Plow the white waves, and lash the bellowing deep. A mighty Triton, figur'd on the prow, With his loud trump alarms the sea below. Down to his waist the human form descends, But in a whale th'amphibious monster ends. Swift as he swims, the waters fly before; And, dash'd beneath the god, the frothy surges roar. So many chiefs in thirty vessels ride To Troy's defence, and cleave the sparkling tide. Now radiant Cynthia, thro' th'ethereal height, Rode in the solemn chariot of the night. 322. Fixt at the stern.] The leader of a colony (says Catrou) should be equal to every task which that business requires. Æneas does not disdain to pilot his own vessel in the night. This he had done before, after Palinurus fell into the sea. B. 5. ad calc.Fixt at the stern, the helm Æneas plies; No creeping slumber seals his careful eyes. Amid the seas, he meets the wond'rous train Of ships transform'd to Nereids of the main; As many goddesses, as stood before, With brazen beaks, tall vessels on the shore. They know the chief from far, and in a ring The dancing nymphs inclose their wond'ring king. The first Cymodocea., whose eloquence excell'd the rest, Above the waves advanc'd her ivory breast; Held with one hand the stern, while one divides, With many an easy stroke, the silent tides: And dost thou wake, great off-spring of the skies? Wake still, and open ev'ry sail (she cries): Thy ships are we, that once on Ida stood, Now chang'd by heav'n to Nereids of the flood. When the perfidious proud Rutulian came With the dread sword, and the devouring flame, 340. We burst our anchors.] Catrou mentions this part of Cymodocea's speech as a specimen of the politeness of a sea-nymph. Nothing (says this refined Frenchman) can be more polite than the language of this new nymph. She gives Æneas to understand, that she was turned into a goddess sorely against her own will, and that she had rather still have continued in his service under her original shape.We burst our anchors, by the foe compell'd, And sought our master o'er the watry field. These forms the mother of the skies bestow'd, And made each ship a goddess of the flood: Low in the sacred seas our court we keep, And dwell beneath the roarings of the deep. Shut in the town, remains thy royal heir, Midst all the terrors of the Latian war. The brave Arcadian horse, and Tuscan host, Have reach'd the land, and seiz'd th'appointed post. The Daunian chief has sent a squadron down To stop their destin'd progress to the town. Rise, hero! rise; and, with the dawning light, Lead all th'impatient warriors to the fight. With thy Vulcanian orb invade the field, That golden, bright, impenetrable shield. The morning sun (nor think my promise vain!) Shall see vast heaps of fierce Rutulians slain. 358. Tis said; the goddess.] Mr. Dryden justly observes, that the transformation of the ships, as violent a machine as it is, serves here to carry on the main design. These newmade divinities not only tell Æneas what had pass'd in his camp during his absence; and what was the present distress of his besieg'd people; and that his horsemen, whom he had sent by land, were ready to join him at his descent; but warn him to provide for battle next day, and foretel him good success: so that this episodical machine is properly a part of the great poem; for besides what I have said, they push on his navy with celestial vigour, that it might reach the port more speedily, and take them more unprovided to resist his landing.This said; the goddess (for she knew the way) Push'd the light vessel o'er the glassy sea: Swift as a jav'lin, or a storm, she flew; And, wing'd with rival speed, her course the rest pursue. While at the sight the hero stood amaz'd, The prosp'rous sign his bounding spirits rais'd. Then, as he fixt on heav'n his joyful eyes, To potent Cybele the warrior cries: Great guardian queen of Ida's hills and woods, Supreme, majestic mother of the gods! Whose strong defence proud tow'ring cities share, While roaring lions whirl thy mighty car! Oh! kindly second this auspicious sign, And grace thy Phrygians with thy aid divine. Inspir'd by thee, the combat I require, My bosom kindles, and my soul's on fire! He said; and now the bright revolving day Blaz'd o'er the world, and chas'd the shades away; When first the hero bade the train prepare, All rang'd beneath their banners, for the war; Rouse for the charge their courage, and excite Their martial ardor, to provoke the fight. As on his stern the godlike warrior stands, And views distinct his camp and social bands; 382. High in his hand.] Ardet apex capiti, cristisque a vertice flamma Funditur ? Gabriel Faernus conjectures that Virgil wrote, tristisque for cristisque; which (says Fulvius Ursinus) is a very plausible reading, tho' it is not found in the old MSS. I think tristis heightens the sublimity of the description; and it must be allowed that cristis in this place is superfluous. See Homer's Il. B. 5. sub init. ???? ?? ?? ?? ???????, &amp;c.High in his hand the golden shield he rais'd: Wide o'er the flood the strong effulgence blaz'd. Fir'd with new hopes, the joyful Trojans spy The shining orb; their darts and jav'lins fly; And their loud clamours tempest all the sky. Less loud the thick-embody'd cranes repair, In ranks embattled, thro' the clouds of air; When, at the signal giv'n, they leave behind, With rapid flight, the pinions of the wind. Amaz'd stood Turnus, and their Latian foes, Nor knew from whence the sudden transport rose; Till all th'advancing navy they survey, A floating scene, that cover'd half the sea. From great Æneas' crest the lightnings stream, And his bright helmet darts a ruddy gleam; A length of flames the mighty shield displays, Shoots fires on fires, and pours a boundless blaze. 399. So the dire.] Virgil has finely improved this simile from Homer. See Il. ?. Milton has copied it, and exceeded both his originals in sublimity. ? Like a comet burn'd That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge In th'Arctic sky; and from his horrid hair Shakes pestilence and war. ? P. L. B. z. This comparison is applied with greater propriety by Milton, than by either Homer or Virgil, as he is speaking of a being more than human.So the dire comet, with portentous light And baleful beams, glares dreadful in the night: So the red dog-star, when he mounts on high, And with his fatal splendor fires the sky, Scares the pale nations; for his burning breath Darts down disease, blue pestilence, and death. But still, undaunted, Turnus urg'd the train, To seize the shore, and drive them to the main. Lo! what you long have wish'd, to prove your might, The hour!—the place!—the foe!—the promis'd fight!— Your wives, your sons, your country calls you on, Your great forefathers glories and your own. Now while, with slidd'ring steps, to gain the land The Trojans toil; descend we to the strand; Soon as on yonder shore our bands appear, One noble stroke, my friends, shall end the war: The brave command success.—The hero said; Then with himself for one cool moment weigh'd, To the bold task what chosen troops to call, And to what bands entrust the leaguer'd wall. Meantime the hero lands his warlike train; Some watch, impatient, the retreating main; Then vault, and seize the half-recover'd shores; Some slide, more vent'rous, down the bending oars. A place at length the daring Tarchon spy'd, Where in smooth swellings roll'd an easy tide; There, as no waters break, no billows roar, He fears no shoals, but hopes a friendly shore. Thither his vessels from the deep he drew, And eager thus exhorts the naval crew: Now, now, my friends, exert your utmost force, Ply, ply your oars, and urge the furious course. Push, heave your desp'rate gallies to the strand; Plow with your beaks and keels the hostile land. My sole ambition is to gain the coast: And then—no matter—let the ship be lost. So spoke th'impatient chief; and, as he spoke, They ply their oars, and rise to ev'ry stroke. Full on the land the rushing vessels bore, Till with their prows they cleave the sandy shore. 439. Safe to the shelving beech.] Innocuæ, says Ruæus, is here to be taken passively for illæsæ. Thus Lucan, uses the word innoxia, Lib. Phars. 9. ver. 895. speaking of the Psyllæ: ? Gens unica terris Incolit a sævo serpentum innoxia morsu. Catrou thus understands the word.Safe to the shelving beach the gallies run; All 'scap'd the shock, brave Tarchon, but thy own. Thy own amid the shallows rush'd, and there Dash'd on the rock, and sloping hung in air: Prest by a war of waves, her shatter'd sides Burst, and the crew plunge headlong in the tides. They swim, incumber'd with their broken oars: The floods supplant their feet, and bear them from the shores. Meantime against the Trojans, on the coast, Brave Turnus led his close-embattled host. The sprightly trumpets sound with martial strains, 450. When great Æneas charg'd the Latian swains.] By the turmas agrestes, we are to understand, men levied in the country by the Latins. These were much better soldiers than the militia rais'd in towns. The army of the Latins was made up in an hurry, and did not consist of regular troops. Catrou.When great Æneas charg'd the Latian swains; The valiant Theron slew, with matchless might, The first auspicious omen of the fight; A giant chief; his furious course he held Against the prince, the foremost of the field. Fierce thro' his shield and mail (an op'ning wide!) Flew the swift sword, and pierc'd the warrior's side. Then Lycas bled, and stain'd the thirsty shore, To Phœbus sacred from his natal hour; Ripp'd from the womb, the infant 'scap'd the steel; The man, unhappy! by the faulchion fell. Gyas and Cisseus next the hero slew, As their huge clubs whole armies overthrew. Vain was their strength, their bulk, their martial fire, Vain their Herculean arms, and boasted sire, Alcides' friend; whose glorious steps he trod, While earth supply'd new monsters for the god. As, loudly-vaunting, haughty Pharos stood, Fixt in his throat, the jav'lin drank his blood. 469. On Cydon next.] Virgil here observes, that the unnatural passion for boys had well nigh been the cause of Cydon's destruction. I appeal to the impartial reader whether or no the poet does not here insinuate a disapprobation of a vice, of which he has been strongly, and I hope unjustly, accused.On Cydon next, who, fir'd with lawless joy, Fair Clytius courted and caress'd the boy, With all his force the mighty hero drove, And soon had finish'd his prepost'rous love; Soon had the youth, expiring on the shore, Sunk, and indulg'd his guilty flames no more; 475. But Phorcus' sons.] Some critics remark, that Virgil will not suffer the execrable Cydon to die by the hands of Æneas, as so glorious a death would be improper for so dissolute a debauchee, and at the same time be a disgrace to his hero. La Cerda observes, that Virgil saves Cydon on purpose to please Augustus, who, according to Plutarch, was guilty of pæderasty. But I can never be induced to believe, that Virgil was so abject a cringer as to make his flattery subservient to the vitious and immoral part of his patron's character.But Phorcus' sons, sev'n valiant warriors, flew, And all at once their vengeful jav'lins threw; Some from his buckler and his helm rebound, Some, turn'd by Venus, glance upon the ground. Thus press'd, thus compass'd round on ev'ry side, The wrathful prince to brave Achates cry'd; Bring, bring those darts (not one shall fly in vain) That pierc'd the Grecians on the Trojan plain. Then a long lance with all his might he cast; Thro' Mæon's shield the furious weapon pass'd; Thro' the strong cuirass pierc'd the hissing dart, Transfixt his breast, and quiver'd in his heart. The good Alcanor lends his friendly hand, To raise his grov'ling brother from the sand; But, wing'd with death, a second jav'lin flies, Swift as the first, and sings along the skies; Thro' his extended arm the spear was flung; And by the nerves the dying member hung. His brother Numitor the weapon drew From the pale corse, and at the victor threw; The whizzing dart glanc'd innocently by, But slightly rais'd Achates' manly thigh. Next Clausus, flush'd with youthful strength and grace, (Clausus, the leader of the Sabine race) Beheld the mighty Dryops from afar, And launch'd his pointed spear aloft in air, Which pierc'd his throat; the purple hand of death Suppress'd the voice, and stopp'd the vital breath. Headlong he falls; he grovels on the shore, And his pale mouth ejects a flood of gore. Still rushing on, the chief the slaughter spread; 506. Three sons of Boreas bled.] These words Boreæ de gente suprema may have two significations; viz. that these three first Thracians were of the divine family of Boreas; that is to say, sons of Zethus or Calais, who were the offspring of Boreas and Orythiya; but my interpretation is the most simple; viz. That these three brothers were of the most northern part of Thrace, where Boreas reigns. Catrou. As many more, poor hapless youths! expire; Their country Thrace, and Idas was their sire. Against the prince his bands Halesus leads, And fierce Messapus lash'd his fiery steeds. In furious conflict mix'd, both armies stand On the first verge, and margin of the land; They meet, they fight; but neither gain, nor yield; And level hung the balance of the field. As when the winds from diff'rent quarters rise, Pour to the charge, and combat in the skies, In due suspense the struggling tempests keep The balanc'd clouds, and poise the rolling deep; The winds and waves oppos'd with equal might, Still undecided hangs th'aëreal fight: So join both armies in the dubious fray; These scorn'd to yield, nor those can win the day; All, man to man, exert the martial fire; All, foot to foot, or conquer, or expire. But, in a diff'rent quarter, where the floods Had spread the ground with shatter'd rocks and woods, Th'Arcadian squadrons from their steeds alight, And wage on foot an unaccustom'd fight. Now to an open rout their ranks inclin'd, And close their foes came thund'ring from behind. This saw their chief, brave Pallas, with despair; He saw, and strove to stop the flying war; And thus the troops, as headlong they retir'd, With pray'rs he mov'd, or with reproaches fir'd: Wither, ah, whither would you turn your flight? By your past deeds! by ev'ry former fight! By all your triumphs! by your sov'reign's name! By my own hopes to match my father's fame! Trust not your feet; your hands must hew your way Thro' yon black body, and that thick array. Here, here, your country calls you all, to share With your young chief the glories of the war. Rush to the fight; no gods our arms oppose; Men, like ourselves, and mortal, are our foes. In us an equal strength and soul appears, Our hands and spirits are as bold as theirs. Lo! there the foes our bands imprison'd keep! And here th'eternal barriers of the deep! Back on the seas, ye dastards, would ye fall? Or hide your shameful heads in yon beleaguer'd wall? He said; and, rushing on the hostile bands, First in his way ill-fated Lagus stands; Low as he stoop'd, a mighty stone to rear, Full in the reins, descends the pointed spear; Then, as he disengag'd the dart with pain, Fir'd at the sight, bold Hisbon rush'd in vain Against the prince; the prince his bosom gor'd, And plung'd into the lungs his thund'ring sword: Next, lewd Anchemolus his faulchion sped, Who dar'd to stain his stepdame's sacred bed. You too, ye Daucian twins, unhappy pair! Laris and Thymber! perish'd in the war: 563. So like your features.] Thus Claudian speaking of the resemblance between Castor and Pollux, Juvat ipse tomantem Error, &amp; ambiguæ placet ignorantia matri. This description of our poet is simple and chaste enough, considering, that the subject is purely epigrammatical.So like your features, that your parents look On either face, but each for each mistook. Puzzled, yet pleas'd, they gaz'd on either child, And fondly in the dear delusion smil'd. Now clears brave Pallas, in the dire debate, The nice distinction by a diff'rent fate. Thy head, fair Thymber, flies before the sword; Thy hand, poor Laris, sought its absent lord; 571. The dying fingers.] It must be owned, that there is not that great variety of wounds, and different manners of dying, described by our poet as by Homer.The dying fingers, quiv'ring on the plain, With starts convulsive grasp the steel in vain. The Arcadian squadrons, by their prince inspir'd, Rous'd by his words, by his example fir'd. Disdain to fly, and arms to arms oppose; Grief, shame, and fury, drive them on the foes. From Teuthras and from Tyres, on his car Pale Rhœteus shoots impetuous thro' the war; While Pallas his swift dart at Ilus threw, It pierc'd the hapless warrior as he flew. The winged death the hapless warrior stay'd, And for a space, poor Ilus' fate delay'd; He tumbles from the car, distain'd with gore, And, grim in death, lies foaming on the shore. As, when the summer glows with fervid rays, The shepherd sets the forest in a blaze, The groves all kindle, while the winds conspire, And with their breath enrage the roaring fire: Wide and more wide the conflagration flies, Pours o'er the fields, and thunders to the skies: 591. —Sits the joyful swain.] This circumstance, foreign to the comparison, of the shepherd's sitting to look down on the flames, is quite in Homer's manner; and indeed the words seem to be translated from him: ? ?????? ?? ?? ????? ??????.On some steep mountain sits the joyful swain, While the victorious flames devour the plain. So pleas'd, brave Pallas sees th'Arcadian pow'rs, All fir'd with vengeance, sweep along the shores. Halesus flew to meet the conqu'ring foe; Sheath'd in bright arms, he rose to ev'ry blow. First Ladon sunk beneath his pointed steel; Then great Demodocus and Pheres fell. While bold Strymonius flies before the band To seize his throat; the faulchion lops his hand: Hurl'd from his arm, a stone descended full On Thoas' head, and crush'd the batter'd skull. His old prophetic sire, with tender care, Conceal'd, and warn'd Halesus from the war. But when in death he clos'd his aged eyes, 606. The fatal sisters.] Injecere manum parcæ, telisque sacrarunt Evandri. ? Virgil (says Catrou) here alludes to two customs, the one belonging to the civil law, and the other to the pontifices. By the words injecere manum parcæ, we are to understand what the lawyers signify by the manus injectio, that is, seizing or taking possession. The telis sacrarunt, alludes to the practice of the pontifices when they destin'd a victim to the altar.The fatal sisters claim'd their destin'd prize. Now stood the warrior (for his hour drew near) A victim sacred to th'Evandrian spear. His jav'lin Pallas at the victor throws, But first the youth prefers his ardent vows: Of father Tyber! give my winged dart, To fly direct thro' proud Halesus' heart! His arms and spoils thy sacred oak shall bear; So pray'd the youth; the god allows his pray'r. Halesus shields Imaon from the foe, But leaves his breast all-naked to the blow. He fell; his fall alarm'd the Latian host; They wept, and mourn'd the mighty hero lost. But soon brave Lausus rais'd them from despair; Lausus, who shone conspicuous in the war. Stern Abas first he slew, of matchless might, Who stood unmov'd, the bulwark of the fight. Now bled the Tuscan, now th'Arcadian train, And Troy's bold sons, who 'scap'd the Greeks in vain. Fierce to the fight beneath their chiefs they came; Their chiefs, their numbers, and their strength, the same. The rear close-pressing to the dire alarms, Th'incumber'd troops scarce wield their useless arms. 629. Here Pallas fires his train, and Lausus there.] It was natural for the reader (says Dr. Trapp) to think that these two young princes, being so equally matched, and now so near together, must meet and fight. The poet shews us, that he was not unmindful of this; and so starts this idea: but passes from it to a quite different one; and gives us an hint of what would be the fate of them both. This is extremely ingenious and judicious; first, causing in the mind that, which never fails to please it, vicissitude and surprize; secondly, shewing the art of the poet in telling us what he could have done, tho' he does it not. It may be observed too, that it was more glory to these two youthful heroes to be slain, as they were, by enemies so far superior to themselves, than for either to have killed the other, or for both to have been killed by each other. Not to mention the beautiful use, which the poet afterwards makes of their deaths. Thus far Dr. Trapp. In like manner the reader's expectation is raised in B. 4. of the Par. lost, ad calc. where an encounter is like to ensue between Satan and the angelic squadron.Here Pallas fires his train, and Lausus there; In all their charms the blooming youths appear. Poor, hapless youths! alas! your native plain Must never, never bless your eyes again! In vain would you engage! for Jove withstands; Both, both must fall; but fall by greater hands! Now Turnus to the aid of Lausus came, Warn'd by his sister Juturna., the celestial dame; Thro' cleaving ranks he drives his kindling car With furious speed, and thunders thro' the war. Forbear, forbear; nor touch my due, he cries; For Pallas, Pallas is your leader's prize. To me, to me alone, belongs the fight: Oh! could his sire be witness to the sight! He said; and, at the word, th'obedient train At once retir'd, and left an open plain. The youth with wonder saw the parting band, Heard the bold challenge, and the proud command, With many a fiery glance he roll'd his eyes Around his manly limbs, and ample size; And to his haughty foe, in short, replies: Now, by thy royal spoils I will acquire Immortal fame; or gloriously expire! Then vaunt no more; for know, almighty Jove 653. My father stands prepar'd.] Dryden translates pater in this place by Jupiter: Jove is impartial, and to both the same. In this interpretation he is greatly mistaken; for sorti pater æquus utrique, is manifestly an answer to cuperem ipse parens spectator adesset. In his dedication before the Æneis he observes, “how could Ruæus imagine, that it was the same thing to Evander, if his son were slain, or if he overcame? The poet certainly intended Jupiter the father of mankind.” Æquus implies, he [Evander] is able to bear, is equal to, sorti utrique, either chance, my living or dying.Beholds the fight, impartial, from above. This said; amid the field the hero strode; All-chill'd with fear, the pale Arcadians stood. The Daunian chief sprung dreadful from the car, And rush'd on foot, impetuous, to the war; Rush'd, as a lion, from the mountain's height, On some stern bull, that meditates the fight. But soon as Pallas saw the prince appear Within due distance of the flying spear, Tho' far o'er-match'd, the youth his fortune tries; And, ere he threw the dart, invok'd the skies: O great Alcides! by my father's feast, Thyself vouchsaf'd to grace, a glorious guest; Assist his son, and crown his bold design; Let Turnus fall, and own the conquest mine; And, while the victor spoils the bloody prize, View the proud trophy with his closing eyes. His ardent pray'r with grief Alcides hears, And pours a flood of unavailing tears: While in his breast he check'd the rising groan, Th'all-gracious father sooth'd his sorrowing son: To all that breathe, is fixt th'appointed date; Life is but short, and circumscrib'd by fate: 'Tis virtue's work, by fame to stretch the span, Whose scanty limit bounds the days of man. How many sons of gods were doom'd to fall, Great as they were! beneath the Trojan wall? Great as he was! among the mighty dead, Ev'n my own son, the brave Sarpedon bled: Fierce Turnus too the cruel fates attend, And now, ev'n now, his race is at an end.— This said; th'almighty sov'reign of the skies 685. Turns from the scene of blood his sacred eyes.] ? Oculos Rutulorum rejicit arvis. Ruæus is, I believe, singular in the exposition of this passage, retulit oculos ad campos Trojanorum; he turn'd his eyes towards, &amp;c. which says Dr. Trapp, is bad sense, and worse grammar. Catrou remarks, that Jupiter, in turning his eyes from the field of battle, shews, that he will espouse neither party, Trojan or Rutulian, according to his promise. But is not this promise afterward broken, when he sends down a fury, B. 12. ver. 1204. to terrify Turnus? Is not this espousing the Trojans?—Dr. Trapp tells us, that Jupiter turned his eyes away, that he might not see a death, which he would have prevented, and was not able.Turns from the scene of blood his sacred eyes. Now with full force his jav'lin Pallas threw, And from the sheath the shining faulchion drew. The whizzing spear, with erring course impell'd, Flew thro' the ringing margin of the shield, And, glancing, raz'd the shoulder of the foe.— Then Turnus shook the lance; prepar'd to throw: He shook the lance; and see, he cry'd, if mine Reach not the mark; a surer dart than thine! He said, and threw. The spear with forceful sway Broke, thro' the solid shield, its destin'd way; Thro' ev'ry steely plate, and brazen fold, Thro' thick bull-hides, around the buckler roll'd; Thro' the strong cuirass flew the furious dart, Transfix'd his breast, and panted in his heart. From the wide wound in vain the lance he tore, The purple soul came floating with the gore. Down sunk the youth; his rattling arms resound; He spurns, and grinds in blood the hostile ground. Then, as he strode, exulting, o'er the dead, Thus to th' Arcadian train the victor said: Go!—be this message to your master known; Such as the sire deserv'd, I send the son; Unbrib'd, unsought, his relics I bestow, If fun'ral honours can relieve his woe. Dear for the Trojan's friendship has he paid!— Then, with his foot he prest the prostrate dead; Seiz'd his embroider'd belt, a glorious prey! And from his bosom rent the prize away. In this rich belt, with precious gold inlaid, His utmost art Eurytion had display'd. 716. Here, thick embost.] Statius, Theb. 4. gives one of his heroes a shield ornamented with this story: ? perfectaque vivit in auro Nox Danai: sontes furiarum lampade nigra Quinquaginta ardent thalami: pater ipse, cruentis In foribus, laudatque nefas, atque inspicit enses. Which last expression is very picturesque.Here, thick emboss'd, the fifty daughters shed Their consorts blood, and stain'd the bridal bed; The rais'd bold figures, all divinely-bright, Came out, and stood projecting to the sight. This spoil, proud Turnus with triumphant eyes Surveys, and glories in the costly prize. 722. But man, too haughty.] Thus Homer of Chromias and Aretus, Il. 17. In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn, In vain advance, not fated to return! These beautiful anticipations (says Mr. Pope) are frequent in the poets, who affect to speak in the character of prophets, and men inspired with a knowledge of futurity. So Tasso Cant. 12. St. 58. O vanity of man's unstable mind! Puff'd up with ev'ry blast of friendly wind! LIX. Why joy'st thou, wretch? Oh what shall be thy gain? What trophy this, the bold Tancredi rears? Thine eyes shall shed, in case thou be not slain, For ev'ry drop of blood, a sea of tears. Fairfax. Milton makes the like apostrophe to Eve at her leaving Adam, before she met the serpent: ? She, to him, engag'd To be return'd by noon, amid the bower, And all things in best order, to invite Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose. O much deceiv'd, much failing, hapless Eve! Thou never from that hour in paradise, Found'st either sweet repast, or sound repose.But man, too haughty in a prosp'rous state, Grows blind, and heedless of his future fate: The time shall come, when Turnus in dismay, Shall mourn these spoils, and this victorious day; Shall wish, too late! the golden belt unsought, And curse the trophies he so dearly bought! With groans and tears th'Arcadians, on a shield, Bear back their breathless leader from the field. Thus to thy father's arms dost thou retire, Brave youth, the grief and glory of thy sire! O early lost! with strength and beauty grac'd! This thy first day of warfare was thy last: Yet didst thou scatter death thro' half an host; And, ere thy own, a thousand lives were lost. Now by spectators, not the voice of fame, To Troy's great chief these mournful tidings came; That round his friends, on danger, danger grows, Who claim his aid, encompass'd by the foes. With his huge weighty sword, without delay, Thro' bleeding ranks he cleaves an ample way. Thee, Turnus, thee he seeks along the plain, Proud of the spoils of hapless Pallas slain. The genial feast, the son, the sire combin'd, Leagues, friendship, all, came rushing on his mind. 746. Four youths.] Mr. Pope observes, that Virgil expresses no disapprobation of this cruel action, which the Greek poet does in plain terms, speaking of this in Iliad 23. ver. 176. ? ???? ?? ????? ?????? ????. It is not only (says he) the fierce Achilles, but the pious and religious Æneas, whose very character is virtue and compassion, that reserves several young unfortunate captives taken in battle, to sacrifice them to the manes of his favourite hero.—As this is to be consider'd as a religious rite, and not an action of revenge, I do not see why Æneas should discover any detestation of it.Four youths by Sulmo, four by Ufens, bred, Unhappy victims! destin'd to the dead, He seiz'd alive, to offer on the pyre, And sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral fire. At Magus next his furious spear he cast, But o'er his head the quiv'ring weapon past: The wretch embrac'd his knees, and try'd with art, To bend his stern, inexorable heart. By thy dead father's shade, thy suppliant spare! By all the hopes of thy surviving heir! Preserve, victorious prince, this life alone, To glad a longing father and a son! 758. High in my dome.] Thus Adrastus, Hom. Iliad. B. 6. supplicates Agamemnon. Virgil has beautifully improved upon the Greek poet. Nothing, says Mr. Pope, can be a more artful piece of address than the first lines of this supplication, if we consider the character of Æneas, to whom it is made, Per patrios manes, &amp;c.High in my dome are silver talents roll'd, With piles of labour'd and unlabour'd gold. These, to procure my ransom, I resign; The war depends not on a life like mine! One, one poor life, can no such diff'rence yield, Nor turn the mighty balance of the field! 764. Thy talents.] These tender and affecting expressions, with which Magus endeavours to sooth the wrath of Æneas, but without effect, support a charge of great inhumanity against our hero, as well as the slaughter of Liger and Lucagus, the two brothers, who beg their lives of him, and whom he insults in sarcasms that do not become a man of any generosity. These instances, and his unrelenting revenge upon Turnus, raise a strong party against him: but, considering the importane of the objection, it is not to be suppos'd, that I am the first who have appear'd in his defence. Gallutius is very copious in his apology for this poet, Artic. 9. B. 1. where he discusses this important question, whether the man who kills his enemies, that beg their lives, who devotes the four children of Ufens, and the four children of Sulmo, to the manes of Pallas, to be slaughter'd as a sacrifice on his tomb, had any claim to the appellation of just and merciful, by them, as the poet pretends. He goes thro' all these cases, and to every one gives a pertinent answer: I shall just mention his arguments, having already observ'd, that we are not to judge of one age by another, much less of the religion of the antients, by that we profess. Doubtless, according to the precepts and the spirit of a religion so holy as the Christian, every such instance of unrelenting slaughter must be looked upon as the highest and most shocking barbarity. But such a censure makes nothing against Virgil: on the contrary, it proves that he is so far from having been guilty of a fault in this case, that if he had done otherwise, he would indeed have been much to blame, that is to say, if he had made his Pagan hero act like a Christian hero. We see clearly enough, that it was an instance of superstition most astonishing to think of, that the shades of the dead long'd for these bloody sacrifices; and that the greatest misfortune that could befal the soul, was to remain unassur'd of due vengeance for the death of the body. But this superstition was consider'd as a point of religion, and nothing was accounted more inhuman in the living, than to leave the shades of their friends unrevenged. All the works of the antients are full of instances of what I say. Achilles, who refus'd to engage the Trojans out of pique to Agamemnon, stifles this resentment when the death of Patroclus is to be avenged. Lucan says, that the soul of Crassus murmur'd, that he was not revenged upon the Parthians, the Romans not having sent forces to obtain satisfaction for his defeat and death. Ovid introduces Althea putting to death her son Meleager, to revenge the death of her other children. We all know the Greeks, on this account, sacrificed Polyxena at the tomb of Achilles. Dido in her death finds no circumstance more deplorable, than the thought of perishing unrevenged. Moriemur inultæ? And at the same time that Diana, B. 11. sees the death of Camilla as inevitable, she thinks of nothing but revenging it. Upon the whole, as religion was concern'd in this point, we ought to conclude Virgil acted very consistently, and with great propriety; that Æneas would have appear'd destitute of humanity and piety towards his friend, if he had been prevented from avenging the death of Pallas, by a compassion which in that age would have been interpreted weakness. The poet is justified by shewing, that he had reason sufficient for introducing his hero acting in this manner. ? Pallas, Evander, in ipsis Omnia sunt oculis. To the death of Turnus he is actually obliged, by the express words of Evander; if we consider, B. 11. what this anhappy father sends in charge to Æneas, by the men who bear the body of his son: Vadite, &amp; hæc regi memores mandata referte. Quod vitam moror invisam Pallante peremto, Dextera causa tua est; Turnum gnatoque patrique Quem debere vides meritis, vacat hic tibi solus Fortunæque locus: non vitæ gaudia quæro; Nec fas: sed gnato manes perferre sub imos. We must enter therefore into the sentiments that Æneas must be supposed to derive from the morals of his religion, rather than those which the Christian inspires us with: we must figure to ourselves, that it would have been much more inhuman in this hero, to have given less attention to the misery of Pallas (whose soul he believed to be in a state of disconsolate wandering till his death was avenged) than to the prayer of Magus, of Liger, or even of Turnus; when, to remind him of the death of Pallas, the poet so judiciously contrives to make him see the belt which Turnus had spoiled him of; a circumstance not necessary at the deaths of Liger or Magus, as they followed that of Pallas so close. Nay we see the wrath of Æneas carries him so far, as to make him tell Tarquilus (another whom he kills in the heat of the combat), that he should not enjoy the rites of burial, which the antients esteem'd so great a misfortune. This shews how far the piety and affection of Æneas to his friend, and to Evander, could push his courage. Segrais. I cannot forbear adding, that our infidels seem not sufficiently to have consider'd, what a spirit of mildness Christianity hath introduced into the world, and how much it hath softened the minds of men. Witness the insolent and cruel treatment of captives, the exposing of children, the bloody gladiatorian spectacles, the dreadful proscriptions, the massacres of slaves, the frequent poisonings, and many other enormous barbarities, commonly practised by the so much admired Greeks and Romans.Thy talents (cry'd the prince), thy treasur'd store, Keep for thy sons; but talk of terms no more. Your chief, when Pallas he depriv'd of breath, Left no conditions but revenge and death. 768. So deems my living son; my sire below.] In reality the action of Turnus, in killing Pallas, is a piece of cowardice. He challenges to single combat, at the head of two armies, a youth unequal to himself either in strength or experience. On this action Æneas justly founds his revenge. The verse under consideration is not so much a cruel sentiment, as it is an answer to the intercession of Magus, who begs his life in the names of Anchises and Iulus. Lactantius, cited by Catrou, thinks the killing Magus too barbarous a deed for the pious Æneas; but we are to consider, that Æneas has just lost his friend Pallas, and, seeking to be revenged on Turnus, meets Magus: That even at this time, The genial feast, the son, the sire combin'd, Leagues, friendship, all, came rushing on his mind. Ver. 744. sup.So deems my living son; my sire below; And, from this sword, demand the life of ev'ry foe. This said; he seiz'd his helm; and, while he pray'd, 771. Deep-bury'd in his neck.] Virgil had this part of Homer in his view, when he described the death of Magus in the tenth Æneid. Those lines of his prayer where he offers a ransom, are translated from this of Adrastus; but both the prayer and answer Æneas makes, when he refuses him mercy, are very much heighten'd and improved. They also receive a great addition of beauty and propriety from the occasion on which he inserts them: young Pallas is just kill'd, and Æneas, seeking to be reveng'd upon Turnus, meets this Magus. Nothing can be a more artful piece of address than the first lines of that supplication, if we consider the character of Æneas, to whom it is made: Per patrios manes, per spes surgentis Iuli, Te precor, hanc animam serves natoque patrique. And what can exceed the closeness and fulness of that reply to it? ? Belli commercia Turnus Sustulit ista prior, jam tum Pallante peremto. Hoc patris Anchisæ manes, hoc sentit Iulus. This removes the imputation of cruelty from Æneas, which had less agreed with his character, than it does with Agamemnon's, whose reproof to Menelaus in this place, is not unlike that of Samuel to Saul for not killing Agag. Pope's Iliad, B. 6. 57.Deep-bury'd in his neck the flaming blade. Apollo's priest, illustrious Æmon's son, In purple robes and radiant armour shone. The sacred fillets bind his brows in vain! Swift flies the gaudy warrior o'er the plain. Beneath the prince the hapless victim dies, And fate in endless slumber seals his eyes. Serestus strips his arms; a costly load; A trophy destin'd to the Mars. Thracian god. Umbro, the Marsian chief, exerts his might, And valiant Cæculus renews the fight: Against the prince he warms the troops in vain;— He pours, he storms, he thunders thro' the plain; Lops warlike Anxur's arm; the hand and shield Drop down, an useless burden on the field. Before, he vaunted, and he seem'd to rise In his proud thought, exalted, to the skies. But ah! in vain he rais'd his haughty mind, With the fond hope of years on years behind! In arms great Tarquitus all-blazing stood, Sprung from a Dryad and a Sylvan god. Full in the hero's front he dar'd appear; But thro' his shield and corslet flew the spear. Then as he pray'd, and beg'd his life in vain, He lopp'd his head, that roll'd along the plain. The trunk still beating on the ground below, Thus in proud triumph spoke his conqu'ring foe: 798. Lie, mighty warrior, there.] After this manner Hector insults Patroclus: Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee the joy (Thy pride once promis'd) of subverting Troy, But thou a prey to vulturs shalt be made. Pope's H. Il. B. 16. 1003.Lie, mighty warrior, there! no mother's hand Shall now inter thee in thy native land; But hungry beasts thy wretched corse shall tear, The fishes of the flood, and fowls of air. Lycas and brave Antæus next he kill'd, Fierce as they fought, the champions of the field. Numa, and fair Camertes, then he slew, Who from bold Volscens his proud lineage drew, By far the wealthiest of the Latian train; 807. And soft Amyclæ.] Amyclæ, a city of Peloponnesus, is styl'd tacitæ, either because its inhabitants were too modest to resent an injury done them by a neighbouring nation, according to Ruæus; or, as Servius remarks, because they followed the doctrine of Pythagoras, which injoined to keep silence for five years, and never offer any violence to serpents: but this occasioned their destruction; for, upon some of these venomous animals breaking out of a lake near their city, they religiously forbore to attack and kill them, and so were devoured by them.And soft Amyclæ own'd his easy reign. 808. And as, of old.] Æneas in no part of the Æneid appears more formidably great than in this. He rages like the giant Ægeon besieging Olympus with an hundred arms, &amp;c. The poet could not have represented, in a more expressive and lively manner, the terror that attended his hero, than by describing the horses of the enemy as frighten'd at his figure marching along (even when at a distance), and breathing revenge and destruction. Spencer has a very fine image of this kind, F. Q. B. 5. 1. 8. st. 37. &amp;c. Speaking of prince Arthur fighting with the soldan: At last from his victorious shield he drew The veil, which did his pow'rful light empeach; And coming full before his horse's view, As they upon him prest, it plain to them did shew 38. Like lightning flash, that hath the gazer burn'd: So did the sight thereof their sense dismay, That back again upon themselves they turn'd, And with their rider ran perforce away, &amp;c.And as, of old, the huge Ægeon stood Engag'd in battle with the thund'ring god; Shook high Olympus with the dire alarms, And wag'd the war with all his hundred arms; Long flames from fifty mouths the fiend expires Back to the skies, and answers fires with fires; As many shining swords he shook, and held, Oppos'd to ev'ry bolt, a pond'rous shield. So, when his reeking sword in blood was dy'd, Fought the brave prince, and rag'd on ev'ry side. Now fierce he rush'd against Nyphæus' car, Who shone conspicuous in the ranks of war; With wild affright the startled steeds beheld The tow'ring hero blazing o'er the field; Flew back, and cast their master on the plain; Then whirl'd the bounding chariot to the main. Liger and Lucagus next came in view: Drawn by white coursers, thro' the troops they flew; Two haughty brothers; that, the coursers sway'd; This brandish'd high in air the glitt'ring blade. Their threats the Trojan chief disdain'd to bear, Rush'd on, and shook aloft the pointed spear. No Phrygian fields are these (proud Liger said), Nor these the steeds of Argive Diomede; You 'scape not this, as once Achilles' car; Here ends thy life, and here shall end the war! Thus the mad boaster—but, devoid of fear, The prince, in answer, launch'd his whizzing spear. Then, while the brother, bending o'er the horse, With his keen jav'lin urg'd the fiery course, And, with one foot protended, rush'd to fight, The lance, that instant, wing'd its fatal flight; Beneath the shining margin of the shield, Swift thro' the groin the pointed jav'lin held. Down sinks the warrior with a dreadful sound, And, grim in death, lies grov'ling on the ground. The conqu'ring prince beheld him as he bled, 845. And thus, in scornful terms.] Quem pius Æneas dictis affatur amaris. The epithet pius, in this place, seems to be inconsistently applied to Æneas, while he is insulting a dying enemy. Dr. Trapp justly remarks, that some soldierly epithet would have been more proper on this occasion. But the word pius is here introduced as a general epithet, and not meant to convey any particular or circumstantial idea; as ??????? ??????????, ?????????? ??????. With many other of the like nature in Homer.And thus, in scornful terms, bespoke the dead: Nor were your coursers slow; nor vain affright At empty shadows turn'd your steeds to flight; Yourself, brave Lucagus, forsook the car, And, vaulting on the field, declin'd the war! This said; he seiz'd the coursers by the rein; When thus the brother, cast upon the plain, With lifted hands implor'd the chief in vain; Now, by thyself, thy mercy I implore; By those who such a godlike hero bore; This forfeit life, divine Æneas, spare, And with soft pity listen to my pray'r.— In far, far diff'rent terms you talk'd before; Die then (replies the prince), and plead no more; 859. Go! 'tis a brother's part.] ? Haud talia dudum Dicta dabas; morere, et fratrem ne desere frater. Macrobius quotes this passage, among many others, to prove how great a master Virgil is of diversity of stile. I cannot forbear translating the beautiful simile with which he concludes his chapter: “If we diligently survey the world, we shall find a great resemblance between that divine work and this poem. For as the eloquence of Maro is ever fitted to the subject, is sometimes concise, at other times copious; is here reserved, and there florid; sometimes flows like a rivulet, and sometimes like a torrent; and often comprehends at once all these different species's; so the earth itself is here beautified with corn and the green grass; is there rough with rocks and forests; exhibiting in one place sandy desarts; and, in another place, is moistened with fountains; among the rest too is to be seen the vast ocean. Pardon me, continues he, nor call me an enthusiast, who have thus dared to compare Virgil to nature. I should indeed speak beneath the merit of this great poet, if I was to pronounce, that Virgil has blended all the different stiles of the ten rhetoricians which did so much honour to Athens.” Saturn. c. 1. B. 5. The whole chapter is well worth the perusal of the curious critic. Drayton, in his beginning of the second song of the Polyolbion, introduces the above simile.Go!—'tis a brother's part—in duty go, And wait thy brother to the realms below! He rais'd the sword aloft, as thus he said, And in his bosom plung'd the pointed blade. Thus, like a storm or torrent, o'er the ground He rush'd, and spread the slaughter wide around; Till from their works, so long besieg'd in vain, Break forth Ascanius and the Trojan train. 867. While thus the battle bled.] We begin to be tired with so many deaths. Virgil, therefore, very artfully shifts the scene. The introducing divinities on these occasions is an excellent practice in an epic poet. Catrou.While thus the battle bled; imperial Jove Address'd his consort in the realms above, As both from heav'n survey'd the deathful scene: Say, sister-goddess, and my beauteous queen, Still, is it still your thought, that Venus' care Supports her favour'd Trojans in the war? See! how the martial bands increase in might! Strong from their wounds! and vig'rous for the fight! Can such brave heroes, who such dangers prove, Depend for succour on the queen of love? And why, my lord, submissive, she rejoin'd, These words severe, to rack my anxious mind? Did still your love (as sure it should) remain, A wife and sister might not plead in vain, That from the field poor Turnus may retire, Exempt from death, and glad his longing sire.— But let him die, since Jove has so decreed!— To glut the Trojan vengeance, let him bleed!— And yet his birth might some distinction claim, Since from our own celestial line he came. To thy great name due honours has he paid, And rich oblations on thy altars laid. Thus spoke the suppliant queen; and thus replies, In brief, th'almighty sov'reign of the skies: If 'tis your pray'r to spare his forfeit breath, By a short respite of approaching death; Snatch him this instant from the fatal hour. This grace we grant him;—and we grant no more. For if you beg his destin'd life to spare; Or turn the course and fortune of the war; Vain your request, and vain your hope appears— To whom once more, the pensive queen, with tears: And what, my lord, if you reverse the doom? Spare the dear youth, and save him from the tomb! Ev'n from your soul this grace if you will give, (Which scarce you promise) that he yet may live! Ah! now I see, or in my fears portend, The guiltless youth approaching to his end! But may those fears, my sov'reign lord, be vain, And your almighty pow'r recal his doom again! This said; with momentary speed she flies, Wrapt in a winged whirlwind, down the skies; In sable storms she drives the clouds before; Then to the fields of fight her course she bore: 911. There, in Æneas' shape.] This fiction is imitated from Homer, Il. B. 5. where Apollo raises a phantom in the shape of Æneas. There the spectre is raised by Apollo, or the sun; and here by Juno, or the air; both equally proper, says Mr. Pope, to be employed in forming an apparition. Whoever will compare the two authors on this subject, will observe with what admirable art, and what exquisite ornaments, Virgil has improved and beautify'd his original. Spenser, F. Q. B. 3. 1. 8. seems to have improved this imagination in the creation of his false Florimel, who performs all the functions of life, and gives occasion for many adventures. This formation is described with the utmost luxuriancy of fancy: St. 6. The substance whereof she the body made, Was purest snow in massy mould congeal'd, Which The witch. she had gather'd in a shady glade Of the Riphæan hills, to her reveal'd By errant sprites, but from all men conceal'd; The same she temper'd with fine mercury, And virgin-wax, that never yet was seal'd; And mingled them with perfect vermily, That like a lively sanguine it seem'd to the eye. 7. Instead of eyes two burning lamps she set In silver sockets, shining like the skies; And a quick-moving spirit did arret To stir and roll them like a woman's eyes: Instead of yellow locks she did devise With golden wire to weave her curled head; Yet golden wire was not so yellow thrice As Florimel's fair hair; and in the stead Of life, she put a sprite to rule the carcase dead.There, in Æneas' shape, a figur'd shade Of light impassive air, the goddess made. A Trojan spear the spectre seem'd to wield, Wore a proud crest and imitated shield; And spoke with empty words, in vaunting strain, And, like the chief, came tow'ring o'er the plain. (Such are the fleeting forms in visions bred, And such the gliding spectres of the dead.) The threat'ning phantom made his bold advance, On Turnus call'd, and shook his airy lance. The Daunian prince his sounding jav'lin threw; While, with dissembled fear, the phantom flew. Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled, Burn'd with new hopes, and thus, exulting, said: Flies then Æneas, to his fears resign'd, And leaves a princess' royal bed behind?— The land, for which he cross'd the stormy wave, This arm shall give—and here he finds a grave! Then shook his sword, and chas'd him thro' the war; But his short triumph soon was lost in air! By chance a ship stood anchor'd by the shore, (Which late, from Clusium, king Osinius bore) Close-shelter'd by a rock, that breaks the tides; The planks were laid, to climb her lofty sides. Swift to her darksome hold the shade withdrew; As swift glad Turnus to the vessel flew. That instant Juno cut the cords away, Unmoor'd the bark, and launch'd her on the sea. Meantime Æneas seeks his absent foe, And sends whole squadrons to the ghosts below. No more for shelter now the phantom flies, But mounts aloft, and mixes with the skies. While Turnus far in open ocean sails, (The vessel wafted by the rising gales) Many a long look, back on the battle bends, And hears the cries of his forsaken friends; On such hard terms abhors to live, and rears His hands and voice, in anguish, to the stars: What are my crimes, almighty Jove, that claim This endless infamy to blast my name? This dreadful doom is too severe by far; This load of life is more than I can bear! Whence came I here? and whither am I borne? How could I fly?—ah! how shall I return? Oh! with what eyes can I behold again Yon regal walls, or yon deserted train? How will my friends pursue my name with hate? By me, their worthy chief, expos'd to fate! Those friends (ye gods) I left on yonder plain, In my curs'd cause and quarrel, to be slain! Ha!—now I see 'em fly, or bite the ground!— I hear, I start at ev'ry dying sound. What, what can now be done?—on land or sea 964. What gulf will open.] It may perhaps seem inconsistent, that Turnus, who is here on board a vessel, should wish the earth would open and swallow him. Turnus is worked up into a very high fit of phrensy, so that he has not3 leisure to consider his situation, and therefore makes use of this exclamation so common to persons in distress. Servius understands the passage, that “even the wishes of the wretched are taken from me, and I can here find no earth that will open and swallow me.” Quæ jam satis ima dehiscat terra mihi? But this seems to be a far-fetch'd interpretation. Turnus, after having made this inconsistent wish, immediately corrects himself, and, sensible of his circumstances, invokes the winds to drive his vessel on rocks, and quicksands. Servius seems to contradict his first exposition of the passage, by observing, that the ima terra, the bottom or centre of the earth, contains and sustains the sea. Our translator by using the word gulf, which may be applied either to land or sea, in some measure softens the inconsistency of the wish.What gulf will open for a wretch like me? Ye winds, ye storms, your pity I implore, Drive, drive my bark on some rough rocky shore, Where, nor my friends, nor fame, may ever find me more! This said; the prince debates, by shame oppress'd, Whether to plunge the faulchion in his breast; Or from the vessel leap amid the main, Swim back and mingle in the fight again. Thrice on each bold resolve his soul was bent; And thrice great Juno check'd the rash intent. The goddess wafts him down, secure from harms, Lands, and restores him to his father's arms. Mezentius now, inspir'd by Jove's commands, Succeeds the chief, invades the Trojan bands. On him, and him alone the Tuscans ran, With all their darts; an army on a man. But, like a rock, the dire alarms he stood; A rock, whose sides project into the flood; That hears, above, the furious whirlwind blow, And sees the frothy billows break below; But stands unmov'd, majestically high, And braves the idle rage of ocean and the sky. First Hebrus. Dolicaon's son the monarch slew; Next on the trembling Latagus he flew; Fierce in his hand a pond'rous stone he took, And on his visage dash'd the broken rock; Then drove thro' Palmus' knee the pointed steel; And left the warrior grov'ling where he fell. His glitt'ring arms young Lausus' shoulders spread, And the plum'd helmet nodded o'er his head. Next Evas bleeds beneath his vengeful spear, With Mimas, Paris' friend and bold compeer; 996. Theano bore him.] Homer in Il. 6. ver. 299. calls Theano, Cisseis, from her father Cisseus king of Thrace; and there she is mentioned as the wife of Antenor. And in Il. 16. 718. Hecuba is called the daughter of Dymas a Phrygian. Thus Homer and Virgil do not agree in this matter. From hence Ruæus concludes, that Theano was not the sister of Hecuba, and that the Theano here mentioned is a name feign'd by the poet. This passage, from v. 702. to v. 706. is very confused according to the present reading. I shall here give Dr. Bentley's emendation of it, as quoted by Dr. Clarke in his remark on v. 299. Il. 6. Quorum quidem versuum, quum sententia plane nulla sit, neque enim omnino quicquam est, quo ex linguæ Romanæ consuetudine istud occubat referri possit, conjecturâ pulcherrimâ &amp;c certissimâ ita emendavit Bentleius: Ad Horatii epod. ver. 28. ? una quem nocte Theano In lucem, genitore Amyco, dedit; &amp;c face prægnans Occubat; ignarum Laurens habet ora Mimanta. I think, In llucem dedit is more elegant without a dative case, and genitore Amyco has still the same effect. The occubat, according to the common reading is inelegantly, and almost improperly, applied to Paris. The word ignarus has here the same import as ignotus, and so it is frequently us'd (says A. Gellius) by many authors. Thus Ovid, Jamque aderat Theseus proles ignara parenti Pierius reads, Occubat hic; carum Laurens habet ora Mimanta. By hic we are to understand Paris, and by carus the friendship between Paris and Mimas. Catrou thinks the reading of Pierius ought not to be rejected; but I believe the learned reader will prefer Dr. Bentley's to all others.Theano bore him when the queen of Troy, Pregnant with flame, produc'd the fatal boy; Yet in his native land was Paris slain! But hapless Mimas on a foreign plain! And as some mighty boar, who long has fed High on the rough aërial mountain's head, Chas'd by the hounds, shoots down the hanging brow With speed impetuous to the vale below; When on the toils the furious monster flies, O'er his bent back the starting bristles rise; Stopp'd and entangled, now he foams with ire; Now his red eye-balls glare with living fire. The clam'rous hunters, cautious to engage, With shouts and darts a distant combat wage; He turns, he grinds his teeth; and, void of fear, Shakes his huge sides, and sheds the scatter'd war. Thus (tho' inflam'd with just revenge they stand) None dare engage the monarch hand to hand; But from afar their missile darts they fling, And with loud shouts provoke the raging king. Acron, of Argive race, for fame had fled The joys of love, and left the spousal bed. In purple plumes he tow'r'd, with gaudy pride, Grac'd with the favours of his beauteous bride. The Tuscan king beheld him from afar, Scatt'ring the ranks, and glitt'ring thro' the war. As when a lion, that, with hunger bold, Roams grimly round the fences of the fold, Spies a tall goat, the chief of all the train, Or beamy stag, high-stalking o'er the plain; His horrid mane he rears, he runs, he flies, Expands his jaws, and darts upon the prize; The prize he rends, with a tremendous roar, And, growling, rages in a foam of gore: Thus, on th'embattled foes, Mezentius flew, And Acron in the pride of beauty slew. His gushing blood the broken dart distains, And, as he falls, he spurns the hostile plains. Now round the king the growing slaughter spread, Who scorn'd to kill Orodes as he fled; But, with preventive speed, Mezentius ran, Turn'd short, and bravely fought him, man to man; Then press'd him with his foot and lance; and cries; Behold, behold, my friends, no vulgar prize! Lo! vanquish'd by your king, the great Orodes dies. A sudden transport fires the martial train, And shouts of triumph echo round the plain. When thus the dying chief: insulting foe! 1044. Soon, like my own.] Virgil, more than once, makes his dying warriors prophesy. In this he follows Homer, who makes the expiring Hector foretel the death of Achilles his conqueror. Catrou.Soon, like my own, shall thy proud head lie low. Vengeance is on the wing; black fate is nigh; And here, e'en here, art thou fore-doom'd to die— However, die thou first! the king reply'd (All-grimly smiling with disdainful pride); 1049. And let your boasted.] Nunc morere, ast de me divûm pater atque hominum rex Viderit. ? Dr. Trapp would read tu for nunc which introduces a very striking antithesis; this piece of atheistical irony (as he terms it) is highly beautiful. Res suas Jovi ironice commendat, says De La Cerda.And let your boasted Jove for me provide. Then from the corse the bloody dart he drew; The shades of death came hov'ring o'er his view. Slow, in dim mists, the heavy vapours rise, And in eternal slumber seal his eyes. 1054. Now by brave Cædicus.] Virgil (says Catrou) has been censured for not every-where distinguishing who were of the Trojan, and who of the Latin party. It is only observing what names are properly Latin,—such as Cædicus, Sacrator, Rapo, &amp;c. and what are drawn from the Greek, as Alcathous, Hydaspes, Parthenius, &amp;c. and the confusion is easily removed. This is a new proof that the Trojan tongue was derived from the Grecian.Now by brave Cædicus, Alcathous fell: Hydaspes sunk beneath Sacrator's steel; His weighty spear the valiant Rapo threw, And mighty Orses and Parthenius slew. Clonius the next by Neptune's son was slain, And Ericetes press'd the bloody plain: This, on the ground, the godlike hero kill'd; That, his mad courser cast upon the field. 1062. Next, Tuscan Valerus.] By mentioning Valerus, the poet pays a compliment to the noble Valerian family. The famous Poplicola was of this house. Catrou.Next, Tuscan Valerus, as Agis strode Before the ranks, thy jav'lin drank his blood. Thy faulchion, Salius, pierc'd Atronius' side; The hapless victor by Nealces dy'd, Skill'd or to dart the lance, or bend the bow, And reach from far the unsuspecting foe. The god of war, in equal balance, held The rage, the woes, and slaughters of the field. Fix'd on the spot, the troops disdain to fly; By turns, the vanquish'd and the victors die. From realms of light, th'immortal pow'rs inclin'd Their eyes, and mourn the havock of mankind! Here heav'n's imperial queen, and Venus, there, Lean forward from the sky to view the war; While pale Tisiphone, with dire alarms, Inflames the rising rage, and calls the hosts to arms. Now his vast spear aloft Mezentius held; Haughty and high he moves, and blazes o'er the field. 1080.—When Orion strides.] There is great majesty and sublimity in this figure of Orion, stalking thro' the waves, and it is not borrow'd from Homer.So thro' mid ocean when Orion strides, His bulk enormous tow'rs above the tides: So, when he grasps in his tremendous hand Some mountain oak, and stalks along the land, Above the clouds his ample shoulders rise, And his huge stature heaves into the skies! Æneas mark'd the hero from afar, And thro' the ranks rush'd furious to the war. The hero stands collected in his might, Defies the godlike prince, and waits the fight. Soon as he saw the mighty chief advance Within due distance of his flying lance, Now, now, my spear, and conqu'ring hand, he cry'd, (Mezentius owns no deity beside!) Assist my vows; succeed my martial toils, To strip yon pirate of his bloody spoils. Thou, Lausus! thou, Æneas' arms shalt bear, A living trophy of my deeds in war! He said, and hurl'd the jav'lin o'er the field. That sung, and glanc'd obliquely from the shield; But held its furious course, and, turning wide, Drove deep the point in great Antores' side: The great Antores (an illustrious name), Evander's guest, from antient Argos came; Late in th'Arcadian court he made abode; Alcides' former friend, and partner of the god: But now, unhappy!—by another's wound He bleeds, he falls, he welters on the ground; And, while he cast to heav'n his swimming eyes, Turns his last thoughts on Argos, as he dies! Next, his strong lance the pious Trojan cast; Swift thro' the shining orb the jav'lin past, Thro' linen plaits, a triple brazen fold, And three bull-hides, around the buckler roll'd; Deep pierc'd his groin, and there its fury stay'd— The streaming blood the chief with joy survey'd; Then from the sheath the shining faulchion drew, And furious on the wounded monarch flew. This sees brave Lausus, his illustrious son, Fears for his danger, and forgets his own; And, while grief, rage, and love, his bosom fire, 1121. To disengage his sire.] This alludes to a circumstance in the Roman history. Scipio Africanus, when he was but seventeen years old, protected his father in this manner; nor did he retreat till he had received twenty-and-seven wounds. Servius. Thus Virgil, in Lausus, very artificially gives us an adumbration of a great atchievement of one of his countrymen.Sighs, weeps, and runs, to disengage his sire. Here then, if future times will credit give, Thy praise, heroic youth! shall ever live; Poor, pity'd youth!—in life's first early bloom, Snatch'd from the world, and hurry'd to the tomb! Incumber'd by the spear that pierc'd the shield, With tir'd, slow steps, the monarch quits the field: Forth springs the son against the Trojan lord, And rush'd beneath the long-descending sword; Flies to prevent the meditated blow, And guard his bleeding father from the foe. His friends, with darts, the prince at distance ply, And with their loud applauses rend the sky. The hero rages, as the jav'lins play'd, And lies collected in the buckler's shade. As when the rattling hail, impetuous, pours, And the wide field smokes with the rushing show'rs, To the safe shelving banks the swains repair, Or to some cavern'd rock; and, shelter'd there, Wait till the furious tempest break away; And then renew the labours of the day. So, ply'd by show'rs of jav'lins from afar, The chief sustain'd the tempest of the war On his broad shield; and thus the godlike man Exhorts, and begs, and threats the youth in vain: 1146. Whither, to death.] Pallas is overcome and slain by Turnus, and Lausus by Æneas. These young princes were equal in valour; but there is a wide difference betwixt the bravery of their conquerors. Turnus eagerly seeks the combat, boastfully challenges and insults his youthful enemy, who appeared in the field of battle for the first time. He wishes Evander himself was present, that he might murder the son before the father's eyes. This is the courage and behaviour of an Achilles. Æneas is very far from attacking Lausus in this manner, when he exposes himself for the sake of his father. On the contrary, he would fain save his life; he begs him to retire from the combat; tells him his tenderness for his father Mezentius, will bring on his destruction; and does not attack him with eagerness and fury, till he finds himself obliged to kill him in his own defence. This anger is worthy of Æneas, and is the proper character and behaviour of an hero more valiant than Turnus, but more pious than valiant. The extreme danger with which he sees himself surrounded, does not hinder him from admiring the filial affection of an enemy, who would willingly destroy him. Bossu, 397.Whither, to death, ah! whither wouldst thou run, And tempt an hand far mightier than thy own? Ah! yet, poor Lausus! from the field remove; You fly to ruin, urg'd by filial love. He warn'd in vain; the youth the prince defies; Till all his dreadful wrath began to rise; The fates prepare their sheers; the Dardan lord Unsheaths, and whirls aloft the thund'ring sword: The thund'ring sword, with all his force apply'd, Furious he drove, and bury'd in his side. The thrilling point, with boundless rage impress'd, Pierc'd the light buckler, and the golden vest, 1158. Fond mother.] The introducing his mother in this artful manner, produces a very affecting pathos.Which his fond mother's hands embroider'd o'er; And his fair breast was stain'd with crimson gore: The pensive spirit leaves the corse behind, Flies to the shades, and mixes with the wind. 1162. But, when.] The contrast of character between Lausus and his father, is very striking. We are sorry so good a youth should have so impious a father. How heroic are the sentiments of Æneas on the death of this young prince! The patriæ pietatis imago, may mean, that he is moved by considering how he himself should be affected, if the same thing should happen to Ascanius. Dr. Trapp understands it of the piety of the son to the parent: And then, Æneas is moved with the dutiful behaviour of Lausus to Mezentius, resembling his own to Anchises. Patriæ pietatis, says he, can admit of no other signification in B. 11. and it is probable, that the poet in both places meant the same thing by the same words.But, when the pious god-like prince of Troy Saw the pale visage of the hapless boy In death's last agonies; a groan he drew Deep from his heart; nor cou'd he bear the view. His soul now melts with stern Mezentius' woe, And in the wretched sire forgets the foe. Then to the boy he reach'd his hand, and said; To worth like thine, what honours can be paid? Lamented youth, too early lost! receive The sole reward a gen'rous foe can give: Lo! I restore thy arms, unhappy boy! Thy sword and buckler, late thy only joy: Yet, Lausus, ev'n in death, be this your pride, 1175. That by the great Æneas' hand.] The text is, ? Æneæ magni dextra cadis. It has been a question, whether or no it is consistent with decorum, for the hero to give testimony of himself, and boast as he does likewise in the first book, where the poet makes him say, Sum pius Æneas. ? And there may be found perhaps some other passages like this, to all which I think it necessary to answer once for all, as it is but one question. I say then, that these forms of speaking are not contrary to decorum, as some imagine; and that there are some circumstances, where, without boasting, a man of honour may give that testimony of himself, which is due to him. This advantage is particular to heroes, who, being elevated above the common rank of men, ought to have sentiments agreeable to that elevation. What is necessary, is, that they should speak the truth, and that time and place should require them to do so. For there is no doubt, but that in the passage of B. I. where Æneas is represented overwhelmed with misfortune, bewilder'd in a desert, and wandering in an unknown country, there is no doubt, I say, that the poet makes use of it with dignity, to shew by the discourse which he puts into his hero's mouth, that misfortune cannot debase his sentiments. There is a certain greatness in using it thus; and in this last example, we may answer besides, that the hero who has just perform'd such brave exploits, and in the whole course of the poem is sensible that he is so highly elevated above other men, should from thence conceive great ideas of himself. Camilla, in B. XI. having killed Orinthus, a famous hunter, insults his death, and comforts him nevertheless with the honour of dying from her hand, as Æneas does the son of Mezentius: Manibus hoc referes, telo cecidisse Camillæ. These sentiments have something of a poetical enthusiasm in them; and if poets are allowed to boast of themselves, this liberty may well be allowed their heroes. Quintilian allows poets this privilege, Oportet poetam bene de se semper sentire: and indeed, provided the manner in which the poet expresses himself be elegant and noble, an expert critic will never find fault with him. Montagne says, upon the same principle, a great man may speak what is true of himself, when there is no reason to suspect him of affectation; and blames Tacitus for having said of himself, “It was at a time when I was prætor, which I say without vanity.” Montagne perhaps, as being a Gascon, thinks that a man ought not to make any scruple of speaking of his good fortunes: he says, that so great a man as Tacitus ought not to have made use of this corrective; and that he ought not to have imagined there could be any vanity in saying what was true, tho' to his own advantage, since it was necessary to bring it as an instance by the circumstances of his discourse. It is only affectation therefore which makes boasting improper in persons of lower conditions. On the contrary, there is sometimes a magnanimity in publishing what a man has most meritorious, either belonging to himself, or his ancestors; that is to say, when our enemies, or adverse fortune, have lower'd us; and above all, when a man says nothing that is not true: such are the charms of truth, that she even gives a value to words which might be suspected of ostentation! So much liberty does a noble courage assume, when it takes her for a guide in all its actions. Segrais.That by the great Æneas' hand you dy'd. Then round the corse he calls his social train, 1177. And rears himself the warrior from the plain.] Catrou observes, that Virgil's conduct is admirable, with regard to the difference of character discovered by Turnus and Æneas in killing Pallas and Lausus. The bravery which Turnus exerts in fighting with Pallas, is equal to that of Æneas in conquering Lausus. But the valour of the Trojan is accompanied with good-nature and gentleness; that of the Rutulian with hard-heartedness and cruelty. Turnus seeks out Pallas, while Lausus falls into the hands of Æneas. Turnus exclaims, that the destinies had reserved Pallas for himself, soli mihi Pallas debetur; but Æneas, conscious of the inequality of the combat, cries out, quo, moriture, ruis? to the young Lausus. Pallas is afraid of Turnus, which is one reason why he should have spar'd him; whereas, in the presence of Æneas, Lausus behaves with so forward and menacing a spirit, that Æneas is oblig'd to fight him against his own will. Turnus insults his wounded antagonist: I will give an account to your father, says he, of your behaviour and abilities. Æneas compassionates Lausus for the misfortune which he had drawn on himself by his own obstinacy. The Rutulian returns the body of Pallas to his father, on no other account than to distress the good old king, Haud illi stabunt Æneia parvo hospitia: but the Trojan returns the body of Lausus to be buried among his ancestors, Teque parentum manibus, &amp; cineri, si qua est ea cura, remitto. Turnus takes away Pallas's belt; but Æneas suffers all Lausus's arms to remain with him. This is an atchievement of the same nature: the polite courage of Æneas is opposed to the cruel behaviour of Turnus.And rears himself the warrior from the plain. But ah! how chang'd!—with blood disfigur'd o'er; And his fair tresses all-deform'd with gore! 1180. Meantime.] This is a fine subject for the canvass. The mixture of martial and pastoral circumstances is highly beautiful. What a noble principal figure would this old tyrant make, reclin'd, among his attendants, at the trunk of a large oak on the banks of a river, with the utmost anguish and despair in his countenance; and yet, at the same time, seeming to receive some refreshment from the coolness of the shore; his helmet hung on the boughs, and the rest of his armour scatter'd, confusedly, around him! We are pleased to find some parental tenderness in Mezentius, whom we have hitherto look'd upon as a most unnatural monster, Multa super Lauso rogitat ? is artfully thrown in. See Hector wounded, Iliad 22.Meantime, retir'd to Tyber's flow'ry bounds, In the cool stream to bath his glowing wounds, The wretched father (father now no more!) In sullen sorrow rested on the shore; Lean'd on an oak, with pain and anguish stung, And from a bough his brazen helmet hung. His heavier arms lie scatter'd o'er the plain; Round the sad monarch wait the duteous train: As (o'er his breast his hoary beard declin'd) The chief enjoy'd the freshness of the wind; 1190. Much of his Lausus asks the pensive sire.] The strong paternal love of Mezentius finely softens his savage character. There is no person, probably, however vicious and depraved, but who hath some spark of virtue, and some good qualities in his heart. The furious and inexorable Achilles is endued with generosity, the warmest friendship, and a noble contempt of death. And it has been observed, that Milton would not paint the devil without some moral virtues; he has not only valour and conduct, but even compassionate concern: Thrice he essay'd, and thrice, in spite of scorn, Tears, such as angels weep, in grief, burst forth. B. 1. 619. Upon these principles (says Mr. Upton) I cannot defend such a character as Shakespear's Richard III. as proper for the stage: but much more faulty is the Jew's character in the Merchant of Venice; who is cruel without necessity. These are not pictures of human creatures, and are beheld with horror and detestation. Man is of a mixed nature; virtue and vice alternately prevailing; it being as difficult to find a person thoroughly vitious, as thoroughly virtuous. See this reasoning confirmed in Upton's Observations on Shakespear, pag. 81.Much of his Lausus, asks the pensive sire; Sends oft in vain, and warns him to retire. When lo! his soldiers bear him on a shield, Pale, stretch'd in death, and breathless, from the field. Deep in his side appear'd the grizly wound; His groaning friends attend, and mourn around. Far off, that peal of groans the father knew, And dust o'er all his hoary locks he threw; To heav'n, in agonies of anguish, spread His hands; and, hov'ring o'er, embrac'd the dead: 1200. And oh! can life.] This speech of Mezentius, over his son's dead body, is perhaps as fine a piece of pathos as any in our poet. It is highly aggravated by the confession of his guilt. The pangs of the exile, and of the childless father, at once rush upon him. The one is awakened and augmented by the other. However, revenge soon reassumes its station in his violent temper; and, notwithstanding his wound, he resolutely marches out to meet Æneas.And oh! can life (he cry'd) such pleasure give? And bleeds my Lausus, that his sire may live? Have I then lost thy life, and sav'd my own? Sav'd by the death of my dear murder'd son! In my defence could such a son expire? A son like him, for such a guilty sire! Now, now, I feel an exile's woe; the smart Of this deep wound lies raging at my heart. 'Tis keen, 'tis sharp, 'tis terrible at last! Nor half the bitterness of life is past! On thy fair fame, my son, I left a stain, Driv'n by my people from my native reign; To them, to thee, my murder'd child! I owe All, all the deaths such guilt shou'd undergo. And yet I live, and see the golden light! But soon will leave it, for I loath the sight! This said; with rage, and valour boiling high, The monarch rear'd him on his halting thigh; And, tho' his wound retards him in his speed, He calls, impatient, for the warrior steed; The steed, his pride, his solace, and delight, That bore him still victorious from the fight. Then, as he droop'd, and hung his pensive head, He clapp'd the gen'rous horse, and thus he said: 1224. Rhœbus, we long have liv'd.] An hero of a different character would have invoked the assistance of the gods, in this adventure; but Mezentius, as an atheist, addresses, and puts all his confidence in, his horse. See Mr. Pope's nineteenth observation on the eighth book of the Iliad.Rhœbus, we long have liv'd (if length there be In mortal life)—'tis now too long for me! Soon shalt thou bear me from the bloody fray, And bring Æneas' head and spoils away; With thy lov'd lord on yon detested plain, Avenge my son, my darling Lausus slain And share together, in the dire debate, One common conquest, or one common fate. For thou wilt scorn, I trust, the rule abhorr'd, And the base burden, of a Phrygian lord. This said; the hero mounts the gen'rous horse, And to the foe directs his furious course. High on his head the crested helm he wore, And in his hands the steely jav'lins bore. 1238. His conscious valour.] This cruel king is not without his virtues; we are here almost apt to pity him. No character should be painted uniformly vile: perhaps there is no such thing in nature, as monstrum nulla virtute redemtum. As the most virtuous man has his vices, so the most vicious man has his virtues.His conscious valour, his recoiling shame, Grief, wrath, and fury, set his soul on flame. Thrice on Æneas' name he calls from far, Who hears the challenge, and accepts the war. 1242. So may great Jove.] This address of Æneas to the gods is a fine contrast to the impiety of Mezentius, who acknowleges no other divinity than his own arm; Dextra mihi deus. It is to be observed, that this prayer is very short; the presence of a furious enemy would not permit him to say more. Homer has not always this reservedness. Catrou.So may great Jove, and he, the god of light, Inspire thy soul, to stand the proffer'd fight! The hero cry'd; then made his bold advance, Fierce o'er the field, and shook the flaming lance. And why, reply'd the king, this vaunting strain? The father perish'd, when the son was slain! Strike then, and use thy present fortune:—strike— Death, and the fabled gods, I scorn alike. No more—I came to die; but first bestow This parting present on the murd'rous foe. Swift as the word, the vengeful dart he sped; Lance after lance, in swift succession, fled; Then, in a spacious ring, he rode the field, And vainly ply'd th'impenetrable shield; Thrice round the chief in rapid circles flew, And at each flight a pointed jav'lin threw. Collected in himself, the hero bears, On the broad shield, a rising grove of spears. But now the prince, impatient of delay, So long to tug dart after dart away, Press'd and fatigu'd with such unequal fight, (At length determin'd to display his might) Springs forth; and aims his jav'lin's furious course Betwixt the temples of the fiery horse. Stung to the brain the horse begins to rear, Paw with his plunging feet, and lash the air. Headlong at last, and madding with the steel, Full on the shoulder of his lord he fell. The hosts with clamours tempest all the skies. With his drawn sword the fierce Æneas flies: And where is now the lofty strain (he cry'd) Of stern Mezentius, and the scornful pride? With half-recover'd life, the king replies (And, as he speaks, stares wildly at the skies); Why, why, insulting foe, this waste of breath To souls determin'd, and resolv'd on death? In that fond hope to battle did I fly; And fought far less to conquer than to die. My son, when slaughter'd in the martial strife, Made no such contract for his father's life; A worthless gift, to live at thy command! Nor wou'd I take it from his murd'rer's hand! But, if a vanquish'd foe this grace may crave, 1285. Oh! let me find the refuge of a grave!] Notwithstanding Mezentius's former contempt of all religious rites, his praying to Æneas for sepulture is highly natural. We see every day, says Segrais, the most resolute and harden'd change their opinions and language at the hour of death; so natural is it for man to acknowlege the power of a deity in spite of himself; and so difficult is it intirely to efface the first impressions of religion. We should likewise remember, that the antients thought it was the most severe misfortune to be deprived of the rites of burial: as we have seen in the instance of Palinurus, and which might be proved from a thousand passages among the antients. To this observation of Segrais I must add a most judicious remark of F. Brumoy: Theatre des Grecs, Tom. 4. pag. 201. Les Phœniciennes.Oh! let me find the refuge of a grave! Too well my subjects vengeance have I known; Then guard my corse; and lay me by my son. Grant, grant that pleasure, ere I yield my breath, To share his dear society in death! This said; the willing warrior to the foe Extends his throat, and courts the fatal blow. The sanguine stream his radiant armour dy'd; The soul came rushing in the purple tide. The last act of this tragedy of Euripides may, at first sight, appear to be, in some measure, ascititious, as well as the last of the Ajax of Sophocles, if the reader does not frequently reflect on what I have so often insinuated, that not to be buried was by the antients esteemed a more dreadful punishment than death itself. Hence it came to pass, that the deaths of the heroes of the theatre were, by no means, a sufficient unravelling of the plot. It was necessary to add the honours or want of sepulture to render the action complete. And this, without doubt, gives us a key to all the antient denoüemens both of epic poetry, as in Homer's description of the funeral rites for Hector and Patroclus; and of tragedy likewise, as in the Ajax, the Phœnicians, and many others; the unravellings of whose plots will always displease, if we forget the principles and notions received by antiquity. THE ELEVENTH BOOK. The Argument. Æneas erects a trophy of the spoils of Mezentius, grants a truce for burying the dead, and sends home the body of Pallas with great solemnity. Latinus calls a council to propose offers of peace to Æneas, which occasions great animosities between Turnus and Drances. In the meantime, there is a sharp engagement of the horse; wherein Camilla signalizes herself; is killed; and the Latin troops are intirely defeated. 1. Now, o'er the waves.] This book, says Segrais, is adorned with the episode of Camilla, as the ninth is with that of Nisus and Euryalus. There are but few books, which are intirely taken up in relating the affairs belonging to the main subject; but we may observe how these ornaments differ the one from the other. Indeed, all the books have, for the most part, one circumstance common to all; the first, sixth, seventh, and eighth, excepted; that is, says Scaliger, they conclude with a death. Some suppose, that this was done designedly by the poet; and others, that such a distribution came by chance, and that Virgil died without determining how to begin his books. However, one may well judge, for example, that he intended to begin his second book, with the recital of taking Troy; but it is, by no means, certain, that he had determined to begin all the other books with those very verses which we now read at their several beginnings: insomuch that it is still a dispute among the critics, whether it would not be better to begin the sixth book with this line, Obvertunt pelago proras, tum dente tenaci. than with the following, Sic fatur lacrymaes, &amp;c. And indeed it seems, that the second line, Et tandem Euboicis Cumarum allabitur oris, would have been a good conclusion, and would have been well placed at the end of the fifth book. But as this is not a proper place to dispute this point, I refer to the commentators. And as to each book's ending with a remarkable death, I content myself with observing, that they have no resemblance the one with the other. For if the second book ends with the death of Creusa, it is easy to see, that the death of Anchises, which ends the third, has no relation either to her death, or to that of Dido at the end of the fourth, and still less to Palinurus's death, with which the fifth is ended. Besides one may observe, that these four deaths, described in the first part of the poem, have no resemblance with those which happen in the second; namely, that of Mezentius, Camilla, and Turnus. And these latter, tho' very near each other both in time and place, and by the subject which renders them alike, are still so diversify'd by the manner in which they are described, that one cannot sufficiently admire the poet's art. The three last books, which are intirely of war and combats, prove what I advance: and 'tis very difficult not to fall into the contrary fault, from the resemblance of warlike actions which must necessarily be described. The harangues of Turnus and Drances, the lamentations of Evander and Æneas on the death of Pallas, the little history of Camilla, the attack of her cavalry compar'd so happily to the flux and reflux of the sea, and lastly, the general defeat of the Latins after the death of Camilla; all these, I say, are inimitable pictures. And when I consider how many excellent passages are to be found in these last three books, I cannot possibly imagine how the learned M. Guyet could think they were not written by Virgil. I find few of the learned are of his opinion. It may be granted, that the versification of these last books is not so close and prest, as that of the former.—But I don't know whether one might not affirm, that the subject-matters which they contain, are not more diverting, and at least more accommodated to our present manners. Actions of valour, and wonders of the sword, and different incidents, extremely delight the reader, who loves to see continual changes of fortune: and 'tis this which the authors of romances of chivalry perpetually aim at: but this must be determined by the reader. Now, o'er the waves, Aurora rais'd her head: 2. The chief, tho' eager.] It was a custom of the Romans, never to sacrifice when they were polluted with the rites of burial: but if it so happen'd that any one died, and there was at the same time a necessity of performing a sacrifice, the friends of the deceas'd always strove to go thro' with the sacrifice, before they buried him. Thus, when it was told to Horatius Pulvillus, while he was consecrating the capitol, that his son was dead, he cried out, Cadaver sit: nor would he engage in his funeral, till he had finished the consecration. According to this custom, Æneas is here introduced paying his vows to heaven, before he celebrates the sepulture of Pallas, and his companions. See note, v. 227. B. 7. And Macrob. Sat. B. 3. C. 1. on the accuracy with which Virgil has expressed the rites and terms of sacrificing.The chief (tho' eager to interr the dead, And to the wretched father's arms to send The relics of his dear departed friend) First to the gods discharg'd a victor's vows, And bar'd an oak of all her verdant boughs. High on a lofty point the trunk he plac'd, Which with Mezentius' radiant arms he grac'd; The shiver'd lances that the monarch bore, The plumy crest that dropp'd with recent gore; The cuirass next; transfixt in ev'ry part By the keen jav'lin, or the flying dart. Then on the left, the brazen shield was ty'd; And the dread sword hung glitt'ring at the side. Thus the rich spoils he rais'd aloft in air, A trophy sacred to the god of war. Then to his friends, a glad triumphant train, Assembled round their chief, the prince began: Dismiss your fears; the high exploit is o'er; The great, the stern Mezentius is no more! Lo! where an omen of success he stands, The glorious trophy of your leader's hands! When heav'n permits, our standard to display, To yon proud town, intrepid, break your way; And let your eager hopes, devoid of care, Fore-run the happy fortunes of the war. Now let our slaughter'd friends in earth be laid, The last, last honours we can pay the dead! On those brave souls be fun'ral rites bestow'd, Who bought this country with their dearest blood: But first the cold remains of Pallas send To his sad father, our unhappy friend; Since the dire chance of war, in early bloom, Condemns the valiant hero to the tomb! 35. To the tent.] Recipitque ad limina gressum, Corpus ubi ? &amp;c. The Greeks as well as the Italians, placed their dead in the porches of their houses. Thus Achilles, speaking of ?? ??? ??? ?????? ? ?????? ??? ???????? ???????????. Who lies in my tent with his face turned towards the door. Thus Persius, in portam rigidos calces extendit; and Suetonius, of the body of Augustus,—Equester ordo suscepit, urbique intulit, atque in vestibulo domus collocavit.Then to the tent his hasty course he sped, Where old Acœtes sits, and guards the dead. Evander's 'squire of old, in fields he shone: A far less prosp'rous comrade to the son! His friends, his soldiers, and the menial train, With tears bemoan the blooming hero slain. With lamentable cries, and hair unbound, 42. The Trojan dames.] Why does the poet represent Trojan dames surrounding the body of Pallas, since he gave us to understand before, that they all remained behind in Sicily, and that the mother of Euryalus alone had courage enough to follow her son into Italy? Solis e matribus ausa. Servius understands female slaves in this place, has Æneæ ancillulas; but why are they term'd Iliades? This is certainly a little oversight in the poet, which would have been corrected, if he had lived to put the last hand to his poem.The Trojan dames in order stand around. 43. Soon as Æneas.] At the appearance of Æneas their grief and lamentations are renewed; a circumstance imitated by Statius Theb. B. 6. v. 42. ? Mox ut mœrentia dignis Vultibus Inachii penetrarunt limina reges, Ceu nova tunc clades, &amp; primo saucius infans Vulnere, lethalisve irrumperet atria serpens; Sic alium ex alio quanquam lossata fragorem Pectora congeminant, integratoque resultant Accensæ clamore fores. ? Catrou remarks, that it was a ceremony among the antients, to renew their lamentations at the approach of a king, or person of distinction.Soon as Æneas past the lofty door, With louder groans the warrior they deplore: They beat their breasts; tears gush from ev'ry eye; The rich pavilions to their shrieks reply. His head now rais'd; the pious prince of Troy Saw the pale features of the hapless boy; Saw the wide wound amidst his ivory breast; And, with a flood of tears, the dead address'd. Lamented youth! could fortune then intend To bless my arms, but rob me of my friend? My friend, I hop'd, (but ah! that hope was vain!) Wou'd share the glories of my op'ning reign, And, gay with conquest, glad his sire again. Far other promise to that sire I past! Nor thought thy first, first warfare was thy last: Then, when he sent me to my high command, The good old king, at parting, grasp'd my hand, And told, with all a friend's and father's care, With what fierce nations we must wage the war. Now for his son, perhaps, he loads the shrine, And decks the fane of ev'ry pow'r divine; While, with vain pomp and many an empty rite, We bring him back his Pallas from the fight, Pale, stretch'd in death; and, in his latest hour, Disclaim'd by ev'ry ruthless heav'nly pow'r! Now, for these triumphs, must thy mournful eye See the sad fun'ral of thy son go by! Such, hapless monarch, are the spoils we send! Such, the vain boast and promise of thy friend! And yet he fell, by Turnus' arms oppress'd, 73. His wounds all fair, and honest, on the breast.] ? Non, Evandre, pudendis Vulneribus pulsum aspicies ? That is, when Evander your father comes forth to meet your dead body, he shall find your wounds honourable; of which Ælian ??????. ?????. L. 12. C. 21. “The matrons of Lacædæmon, when they received the news that their sons were slain in battle, were wont to come forth, and inspect their wounds, both before and behind; and when they found the greater number was before, they conducted the bodies of their children to the monuments of their ancestors, with great solemnity, and a kind of stern pride in their countenances: but if they perceived any wounds behind, weeping and blushing for shame, they departed with the utmost secrecy, leaving the dead bodies to be interr'd in the common sepulchre; or carried them away by stealth, to be privately buried at home.”His wounds all fair, and honest, on the breast! Better, than to prolong by shame his breath!— Then hadst thou curst thy age, and wish'd for death! Ah! what a chief have our confed'rate host, And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost! Thus, while a stream of tears he shed in vain, He bids them raise the body of the slain. A thousand warriors from the host he chose, To wait the pomp, and share the father's woes, The due funereal honours to complete; A slender solace for a loss so great! Soft bending twigs they weave; with care they spread The swelling foliage o'er the verdant bed, And decent on the bier dispose the dead. There like a flow'r he lay, with beauty crown'd, Pluck'd by some lovely virgin from the ground: The root no more the mother earth supplies; Yet still th'unfaded colour charms the eyes. Two rich embroider'd robes Æneas brought, Robes, which of old the Tyrian princess wrought. One, round the body of the youth he spread, His last, last gift! and one adorn'd his head, Drawn o'er his face, that when the flames aspire, With the fair locks may feed the crackling fire. Next, in a line, darts, helms, and steeds, appear, Won by himself; the prizes of the war. Then with their pinion'd hands the captives came, 100. Youths.] Human sacrifices were common on these occasions among the antients.Unhappy youths!—devoted to the flame! With fair inscriptions of the foes he slew, The noblest chiefs, his glorious trophies drew. Supported by his friends, with woes oppress'd, Acœtes rends his locks, and beats his breast; This moment, pauses; then, in sorrow drown'd, Breaks from their arms, and grovels on the ground. All cover'd o'er with blood, succeeds a train Of hostile cars, in honour of the slain. 109. Stripp'd of his trappings.] This is a most affecting image. It is drawn from Iliad 17. where Achilles's horses weep for their master. Aristotle and Pliny inform us, that these animals often lament their masters when killed in battle, and even shed tears for them. Ælian reports the same of elephants, when they are carried from their native country. Suetonius, in Vit. Cæs. tells us, Proximis diebus, equorum greges, quos in trajiciendo flumine Marti consecrârat, ac sine custode vagos dimiserat, comperit pabulo pertinacissime abstinere, ubertimque flere, Cap. 18. “The next day the horses, whom in passing the Rubicon he had consecrated to Mars, and turned loose on the banks, were observed to abstain obstinately from food, and to weep abundantly.”Stripp'd of his trappings, and his head declin'd, Æthon, his gen'rous warrior-horse, behind, Moves with a solemn, slow, majestic pace; And the big tears run rolling down his face. These, the young hero's lance and helmet bear; 114. The rest, the victor.] This is artfully introduced: ? Nam cætera Turnus Victor habet ? The poet takes care to remind us, that some of Pallas's insignia remained with Turnus, which afterwards proved so fatal to him.The rest, the victor seiz'd, the spoils of war. The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian train Trail their inverted jav'lins on the plain. The pomp all past; thus good Æneas said, With a deep groan, low bending o'er the dead; 119. Hail, mighty spirit, hail!] The sentiments of this farewel-speech have a noble simplicity; the conciseness of it is admirable, and highly proper to the occasion. With what detestation does this pious prince speak of war in those lines! Hinc ad lacrymas eadem horrida belli Fata vocant. Salve æternum mihi, &amp;c. is plainly the ????? ???, ? ???????, of Homer, Iliad B. ?.Hail, mighty spirit, hail!—with dire alarms, The fates recal us to the rage of arms, And to new scenes of woe thy friends compel:— Farewel, brave prince, a long and last farewel. This said; the mournful chief, without delay, Back to the lofty ramparts bent his way. Now from the Latian court a train were sped, With wreaths of verdant olives on their head; Who ask a truce, to search th'ensanguin'd plain, And decent in their graves dispose the slain: Beg, that his wrath in conquest may be laid, Nor wage a war, relentless, with the dead; But spare their nation, late by social ties, By plighted love, and friendship, his allies. The godlike hero grants their just request; And in these words his gen'rous soul express'd: What fate, ye Latians, urg'd your minds so far, To shun our friendship, for this wasteful war? Glad would I grant the truce, you ask for those Who dy'd in fight, to my surviving foes.— Had not the fates assign'd these realms before, I had not sail'd to your Hesperian shore; I wage the war but in my own defence; Not with your people, but your perjur'd prince. First, from his league, perfidious he withdrew; Then to proud Turnus' arms for refuge flew. But let proud Turnus stand ('tis just and right) 146.—In single fight.] It ought to be observed, that Æneas, in this passage, makes the first proposal of deciding the war by a single combat.The terrors of this arm in single fight. Would he repel the Trojans from the land? Ev'n let him meet their gen'ral hand to hand! Soon would be known, in combat when we strive, Which heav'n ordains to perish, or survive. Go then, and burn your slaughter'd friends, that spread The purple fields; I war not with the dead. 153. Struck.] It is very judicious to represent the Latins, as deeply affected with the great humanity of Æneas's speech, and, in consequence of it, highly prejudiced in his favour. And equally artful is the compliment, that Drances pays the hero, in the following lines, proceeding more from his implacable hatred to Turnus, than from his love to Æneas. This short speech prepares us for the striking part he is about to act in this book.Struck with the gen'rous speech, they stood amaz'd, And on each other, fixt in wonder, gaz'd; When Drances, senior of the rev'rend train, Th'invet'rate foe of Turnus, thus began: How shall my tongue so great a prince proclaim, Whom fame renowns; whose deeds transcend his fame! Whose force and wisdom, or in war or peace, Thought scarce can equal; and no words express! Thy answer will we soon report, and bring To thy alliance our deluded king. And let rash Turnus other courts implore His sinking cause and int'rests to restore; While we will lend our lab'ring hands with joy, To raise this fated town, this second Troy. He said; the rest assent with equal praise, And fix the truce for twelve succeeding days. Meantime the Latins and the Trojans rove Safe o'er the hills, and mingle in the grove. Now the tough ash the sounding axes ply; Th'unrooted pines turn upward to the sky. The wedge divides, with many a vig'rous stroke, The scented cedar, and the pond'rous oak. And, nodding o'er the cars, (a mighty load!) The length'ning elms roll lumb'ring down the road. Now fame, the messenger of sorrow, bears The death of Pallas to the father's ears; That on triumphant wings with pride, before, The glorious tidings of his conquests bore. Strait rushing thro' the gates, the people stand In ranks, a fun'ral torch in ev'ry hand. The mingling blaze a dreadful splendor yields, Flames to the skies, and lightens all the fields. The Phrygian train approach, a solemn show! And join the mourners in the public woe. Loud shriek the matrons, as the corse appears, And the whole city seems one scene of tears. But nought the wretched father can restrain: He breaks, all-frantic, thro' the parting train; Then on the bier his aged body threw, And kiss'd his son, as to the corse he grew: While from his eyes the gushing sorrows flow, Fixt in a long dumb agony of woe. 195. He strove to say.] This grief for a considerable time, imply'd in the words vix and tandem, stopt the passage of his voice, and at length open'd it; both these are true as to different parts of time: excess of sorrow first makes us dumb, and then makes us speak. Trapp.A thousand things in vain he strove to say, But scarce could these for anguish find their way: 197. Is this thy promise then?] Ariadne breaks out into an apostrophe of this sort, in that pathetic poem of Catullus, intituled Argonautica: At non hæc quondam blanda promissa dedisti Voce mihi; non hoc miserum sperare jubebas: Sed connubia læta, sed optatos Hymenæos, Quæ cuncta aerii discorpunt irrita venti. Ver. 123, &amp;c.Is this thy promise then, my child, with care And cool reserve, to mingle in the war? Too well, alas! I knew how honour's charms Wou'd fire thy youth to seek the rough alarms, In these thy first essays, and rudiments of arms! Oh! dire essays!—too fond was thy delight To learn the dreadful lessons of the fight! Where now are all my vows (my Pallas), where? Ah! the stern gods grew deaf to ev'ry pray'r! How blest art thou, dear partner of my bed, Free from this stroke, among the happier dead! Thee, heav'n in mercy snatch'd to shades below; Thee, death deliver'd from this scene of woe! 210. I, in the dregs.] A true pathos reigns throughout this whole speech of Evander. The various turns of passion, and the alternate addresses to the living and the dead, are the very language of sorrow. The circumstances of tenderly reproaching him for being too forward and eager in the battle; the envying his wife for dying before she could be witness to so great a calamity; the image of this misfortune's happening to him in extreme old age, when he is by nature incapacitated to struggle with it; the wishing he had died in his son's stead; need not, I hope, be pointed out to any reader of sensibility, and a feeling heart. There is something very noble and heroical in his saying, that he will not accuse the Trojans of being the occasion of his son's death, and that he will never reproach himself for entering into a league with them. The only circumstance that can possibly administer any consolation, is, that he died like a true hero; “his wounds all fair, and honest, on the breast.” He concludes by saying, that he is ashamed to have so long detained, by his sorrow, the soldiers from the fight; and hopes only to live long enough to see his enemy Turnus punished for his cruelty.I, in the dregs of age, O cruel doom! Usurp on nature, and defraud the tomb; Still live, and drag a load of sorrows on! Live—and (more terrible!) survive my son! Me, in the battle, if the foes had slain, When, with my force, I join'd the Trojan train, I (as I should) had perish'd; and this state On the dead father, not the son, shou'd wait! Nor yet will I impute my murder'd boy To you, O warriors! or my leagues with Troy: 'Twas not your crime, my friends, he fell so young; No!—'tis the father's, who has liv'd so long, With his slain son to blast his closing eye, And wish, in bitterness of soul, to die. Yet, tho' before his time the fates requir'd My dear, dear boy; he gloriously expir'd! Yet to the destin'd shore his friends he led, And pil'd the ground with mountains of the dead: Ye gods! I'm satisfy'd—he perish'd well! His father thanks you; for in fight he fell! Nor will I add more honours to the boy, Than those design'd him by the prince of Troy, Those, the bold Tuscan hosts and heroes gave, To wait the corse triumphant to the grave: With those, his own bright trophies be his share, Trophies of chiefs, he vanquish'd in the war. Ah! to thy years, proud Turnus, had he ran, Till age confirm'd the hero in the man, Ev'n thou hadst stood conspicuous to the sight, The most distinguish'd trophy of the fight. But why with tears so long have I with-held (Wretch that I am!) the soldiers from the field? Go—tell your prince, that yet I breathe below, And bear the world, a spectacle of woe! (Robb'd of my age's pride, my only joy!) 'Tis, that I wait his vengeance for my boy, His vengeance on proud Turnus' guilty head, Due to the sad survivor and the dead. 'Tis all, himself, or fortune, now can give; 'Tis for that only, I endure to live. Life has no joys for me; but I should go Pleas'd with these tidings to my boy below! And now, to wretched men, the dawning ray Restor'd their round of labours, and the day. The Tuscan chief and Trojan prince command, To raise the fun'ral structures on the strand. Then to the piles, as antient rites ordain, Their friends convey the relics of the slain. From the black flames the sullen vapours rise, And smoke in curling volumes to the skies. The foot thrice compass the high-blazing pyres; Thrice move the horse, in circles, round the fires. Their tears, as loud they howl at ev'ry round, Dim their bright arms, and trickle to the ground. A peal of groans succeeds; and heav'n rebounds To the mixt cries, and trumpet's martial sounds. Some, in the flames, the wheels and bridles throw, The swords and helmets of the vanquish'd foe. Some, the known shields their brethren bore in vain, And unsuccessful jav'lins of the slain. Now round the piles the bellowing oxen bled, And bristly swine; in honour of the dead, The fields they drove; the fleecy flocks they slew, And on the greedy flames the victims threw. Around their friends the pensive warriors stand, And watch the dying fires along the strand; Many a long look they cast with streaming eyes, And wait till dewy night had spangled o'er the skies. Nor with less toil the busy Latian train Erect unnumber'd structures for the slain; Some, to their graves, with pious care commend; Some to their native coasts and cities, send. Some, of distinguish'd rank and high renown, Are borne with fun'ral trophies to the town; The rest, unhonour'd, to the fires they yield; The huge promiscuous carnage of the field! From the thick piles, the streaming flames arise, Blaze o'er the fields, and kindle half the skies. When the third morn disclos'd the dawning day, They search'd the heaps, and bore the bones away: In the warm ashes their remains they found, Quench'd with their tears, and bury'd in the ground; Then o'er the relics rais'd a lofty mound. But more tumultuous shrieks and clamours ring Thro' the wide town, and palace of the king: Boys, mothers, wives, and sisters, there complain For fathers, children, lords, and brothers, slain. All with one gen'ral voice the war abhorr'd, And the dire nuptials of the Daunian lord. Let him, whose boundless and ambitious pride Aspires to gain a crown, and regal bride, Let Turnus (they exclaim) in arms appear, And with his single sword decide the war. This, Drances still inflames; and adds, with spite; His godlike foe has dar'd him to the fight.— But Turnus to his side a number draws, Who warmly plead the blooming hero's cause: He stands supported by his former fame; And the queen's favour shades his injur'd name. 'Midst these debates the pensive envoys bring The final answer of th'Ætolian king.— Nor pray'rs, nor gifts, avail; but all the cost, With all the fruitless embassy, was lost. New succours must be sought; or peace implor'd, In terms submissive, of the Trojan lord. The Latian king, surrounded by his foes, Sinks in despair, and bends beneath his woes. The wrath of heav'n, the recent tombs, that spread The fields, o'ercharg'd and peopled with the dead, 319. The Trojan chief, ordain'd by fate.] By the words fatalem Æneam, the commentators in general understand, that Æneas would prove fatal or destructive to the Trojans. Our translator, with great justice, follows the interpretation of Catrou: Fatalem Æneam, that Æneas destin'd or call'd by the fates to marry Lavinia, &amp;c.Point out the Trojan chief, ordain'd by fate To sway the sceptre of the Latian state. He calls a council; at the sov'reign's call, The peers, assembled, croud the regal hall: There, 'midst the rev'rend fathers of the state, With mournful looks the hoary monarch sate; The monarch bids th'embassadors report, Distinct, their answer from th'Ætolian court. Then, while attention held the solemn train, With rev'rence due, sage Venulus began: Ye peers, a length of lands and perils past, We saw the royal Diomede at last; And touch'd, with wonder and respectful joy, The mighty hand that ras'd imperial Troy. There, blest with ease, the happy victor builds A second Argos in the Gargan fields. Strait to the court admitted, we begun, And in submissive terms address'd the throne; Present our gifts, our names and land disclose; What war requir'd his aid; and who his foes. When, with soft accents and a pleasing look, Thus, in return, the gracious monarch spoke: Ye blest Ausonians! blest, from times of old, By righteous Saturn, with an age of gold! What madness rous'd you now with vain alarms, From long hereditary peace, to arms? 345. All, all.] There is something vastly pleasing to the mind in seeing this old hero, whom we remember to have beheld so active and fierce in the Iliad, retiring from war in his old age, and exhorting the embassadors to peace.All, all our Argive kings, who dar'd employ Their swords to violate the tow'rs of Troy (Those chiefs I pass that under Ilion dy'd, Or Simois whelm'd beneath his roaring tide), Toss'd round the world, in ev'ry distant clime, Atone the guilt of that presumptuous crime. From that dire war our desp'rate course we bore, Each driv'n by tempests on a diff'rent shore. Such scenes of sorrow not a foe cou'd hear, 354. Nor Priam's self relate without a tear.] This sentiment seems to be drawn from a verse of Pacuvius, preserved by Servius: Si Priamus adesset, &amp; ipse ejus commiseresceret.Nor Priam's self relate without a tear. 355. This truth.] The following lines contain an epitome of the sufferings and adventures of all the Grecian chiefs, that assisted at the siege of Troy. 'Tis very natural to make this old hero dwell at large on the misfortunes which had happened to his companions in the war.This truth Minerva's vengeful storm can tell, When on Caphareus' rocks Oïleus fell. The Menelaus. Spartan lord, a banish'd wretch, was hurl'd To Egypt. Proteus' pillars, in a distant world. Ulysses, on the dread Sicilian coast, Saw the grim Cyclops; and his comrades lost. From Crete, Idomeneus, an exile, fled; In his own realm, unhappy Pyrrhus bled. To Libyan shores, the Locrian squadrons fly; To flaming suns, that scorch the mid-day sky. The Agamemnon. king of kings, ill-fated! lost his life, Stabb'd in his palace, by his traitress wife. There the great victor of all Asia bled; 368. Adult'rer.] Ægysthus. See the Orestes of Sophocles; and the Agamemnons of Æschylus, and Thomson; and Odyssey, B. 11. 423. for a most noble and pathetic description of this event.The proud adult'rer mounts his throne and bed. Then, what long woes were mine? by heav'n deny'd To see my native realm, and beauteous bride? For that blest sight, sad omens shock my eye; Transform'd to birds, my comrades mount the sky. Oh dire inflictions!—Now they wander o'er The fishy floods, or scream along the shore. From that curs'd moment all these woes were due, When, fir'd with rage, against the gods I flew; And, in the fight, my daring lance profan'd 378. Mad as I was.] Diomede imputes his misfortunes to his rashness in having wounded Venus: which circumstance gives a weight and importance to this goddess, the mother and protectress of Æneas. 'Tis observable he does not mention his having wounded Mars.(Mad as I was) immortal Venus' hand. When Ilion fell, my vengeance then was o'er; And with her ruins will I war no more. My soul, now calm, no longer dwells with joy On those misfortunes which we brought on Troy. Bear back the presents, and the gifts you bring, ('Tis far, far safer) to the Trojan king. For well, too well, the mighty chief I know, And met in rigid fight the god-like foe; Dreadful in arms he tow'r'd before the host; 388. Heav'ns! with how.] The testimony of such an enemy as Diomede, concerning the prodigious strength and courage of Æneas, greatly exalts our hero's character; and is a fine stroke of art in the poet. The compliment is much heighten'd by comparing him afterwards with Hector.Heav'ns! with how fierce a spring the lance he tost! How, like a whirlwind, hurl'd it o'er the field! How high he shook the sword, and rais'd the pond'rous shield! 391. Had Troy.] The panegyric on Æneas rises here still higher; especially at ver. 402. advising them to make peace with such a formidable enemy.Had Troy produc'd two more of equal fame, Their conduct, courage, strength, and worth, the same; All Greece had trembled thro' her hundred states; Troy, with a tide of war, had turn'd the fates; Pour'd o'er her plains, and thunder'd at her gates. His conqu'ring sword, and Hector's valiant hand, So long of old repell'd the Grecian band: Their single valour sav'd their native wall, And ten whole years suspended Ilion's fall. Æneas shone his equal in the field; 401. But in his rev'rence to the gods excell'd.] This comparison of Æneas with Hector is no exaggeration of Virgil, in favour of his own hero. This Homer had done before him. The goodness and clemency of Æneas, which followed from his piety, are a reason why the Latins should hope for peace. Catrou.But in his rev'rence to the gods excell'd. Make peace, my Latian friends; but oh! forbear To tempt so terrible a foe to war.— This is the sum, great king, of what he said, And this th'advice of royal Diomede. Thus, of their charge, the legates made report; Strait ran a mingled murmur thro' the court. So when by rocks the torrents are withstood, In deep hoarse murmurs rolls the imprison'd flood; Beats on the banks; and, with a sullen sound, Works, foams, and runs in circling eddies round. Soon as the noise was silenc'd; from the throne, 413. Heav'n first invok'd.] It was a custom of the antient orators to usher in their harangues, with an address to the gods; at least when the subject had any concern with the state. Thus Demosthenes, in the beginning of his speech De Corona: ?????? ???, ? ?????? ????????, ???? ????? ??????? ???? ??? ??????? In the first place, O Athenians, I pray to all the gods and goddesses. All the speeches of Cato and Gracchus, says Servius, begin in this solemn manner.(Heav'n first invok'd) the hoary prince begun; I wish, O rev'rend fathers, we had sate, Before these perils, on th'endanger'd state: Far better than a council now to call, When Troy's embody'd pow'rs surround our wall! An host of heroes to the fight we dare, And wage with demigods a fatal war. No toils their fiery ardor can restrain; Tho' vanquish'd, strait they fly to arms again. Our hopes of great Tydides' aid are flown; And now must centre in ourselves alone: Nor these how slender, need I here relate, Since your own eyes behold our dang'rous state. Not but, I grant, all fought with all their pow'r; Arms, strength, and courage, could perform no more. In the dire war, has labour'd ev'ry hand, With the whole force and numbers of the land. But still in vain our efforts have we try'd; Heav'n fights for Troy, and combats on her side. Then hear attentive what my thoughts suggest— 433. A length of lands.] This proposal of Latinus, concerning the cession of lands to Æneas, is founded on history, Cato mentions it, and gives us the length and situation of the ground. It consisted of seven hundred acres [jugera], and extended from the Trojan camp to the city Laurentum. This piece of ground was call'd antiquus, because it was the ancient domain of the Latin kings. Cato reports that Æneas accepted of these proposals. Catrou.A length of lands, far-stretching to the west, Against Sicania, near the Tyber, lies; Where, high in air, the tow'ring hills arise. These tracts, th'Auruncians and Rutulians plow, And feed their flocks along the bending brow. These, with their woods, the Trojans shall possess, 439. And both the nations join.] Latinus does not propose to admit the Trojans as tributaries or vassals, but to establish them on a complete equality with the other kings of the country. This is the force of those words: ? Fœderis æquas Dicemus leges. ? Catrou.And both the nations join in leagues of peace. Since such their wish, ev'n let the warlike band Raise a new town, and settle in the land. But wou'd they leave our Latian shores again, And for some other region cross the main, Twice ten strong vessels let us build, or more (For thick the forests grow along the shore): The form and number let themselves assign; The work, the rigging, and the cost, be mine. Yet more;—with peaceful olive in their hand, An hundred peers and princes of the land, To firm the sacred league, in solemn state, With ample presents on their prince shall wait; Rich gifts of gold, and polish'd ivory bear, The robe of purple, and the regal chair. Ye peers! with freedom these high points debate; Speak, speak your minds, and save the sinking state. 456. Then Drances rose.] It has been imagined by some critics, that under the character of Turnus M. Antony is represented, and that Cicero is shadowed by Drances. The circumstances quo pulchrior alter non fuit; of avis atavisque potens; of a sarcastical vein, and ironical turn; of an heat and impetuosity of temper, painted by the epithets turbidus, amens, furens; have been all alleged by a late writer as strong characteristics of Antony; as the four following lines seem to exhibit the unfavourable idea which the courtiers of Augustus entertained of Tully: Largus opum, &amp;c. down to ferebat. See Catrou, and an anonymous pamphlet intituled, Turnus and Drances. The reader is left to judge of this conjecture. Such kind of interpretations are sometimes ingenious, but ought to be advanced with caution. A refin'd critic might discover in the Æneid parallels for all Augustus's courtiers. Virgil certainly seems to be no friend of Cicero's. He does not mention a word of him in his view of the most considerable Romans, in B. VI. nor in the VIII. though he speaks there of Catiline, ver. 668. Spence. One may add, that there are not to be found, even in Tully himself, higher strokes of oratory than in these speeches of Drances and Turnus. They have the most dramatic air of any part of Virgil.Then Drances rose, a proud distinguish'd name, With envy fir'd at Turnus' spreading fame. His mother's blood illustrious splendors grace, By birth as gen'rous, as his sire was base. Potent and rich, in factious counsels skill'd; Bold at the board; a coward in the field; Loud he harangu'd the court; and, as he rose, These vile reproaches on the warrior throws: What you propose, great monarch, is so plain To all the synod, that replies are vain. But none dares speak; tho' all can understand The sole expedient our affairs demand. Let him, by whose unhappy conduct led, For whose curs'd cause, so many chiefs have bled, So many princes of our land lie low, Till our whole city wears one face of woe, Him, who pretends to storm a host, but flies, While the proud boastful coward braves the skies; Let Turnus (for I must, I will, pursue The public good, tho' death is in my view) Grant that high favour to this rev'rend train, At least, of these our suff'rings to complain! O king! to those rich gifts design'd before For the great Trojan, add one present more: One that your duteous senate must request, And one he values more than all the rest. By fear or violence no longer sway'd, Give to so brave a prince th'imperial maid; By that sure pledge a lasting peace obtain; Or know, the peace, without the pledge, is vain. But should our king so bold a step disclaim, Aw'd by the terrors of his rival's name; To dreadful Turnus we prefer our pray'r For his permission, to bestow the fair, And to our prince and country to restore Their rights, and bluster on the throne no more. Why, for thy pride, our lives should we expose, O fatal chief! the source of all our woes? 'Tis a destructive war; but, to be free From these long ills, we humbly sue to thee; To thee, for peace are all our pray'rs apply'd; And, the sole pledge of peace, the royal bride. And first, myself, thy fansy'd foe (a name I scorn alike to own, or to disclaim), Ev'n I, a suppliant, beg thy grace, to spare Our bleeding country, and forsake the war. In pity, prince, this wond'rous favour yield: 'Tis time, when routed, to renounce the field! Too long have we bemoan'd our slaughter'd hosts, Our lands dispeopled, and our wasted coasts. If love of glory has thy soul possest If fame inspires, or courage warms thy breast; 508. If none can please thee.] Mr. Dryden, in the dedication before his Juvenal, might have cited many instances of Virgil's satirical turn by far more severe than that of the Non tu in triviis, indocte, solebas stridenti miserum stipula dispergere carmen? Some of Turnus's exclamations are bitter to the highest degree. In this dispute between Turnus and Drances, our poet shews himself a great master of artful and elegant abuse: I have often thought, that K. Henry V. as drawn by Shakespeare, greatly resembles Turnus, in a kind of majestic scornfulness, and as it were an heroic ill-nature. For a proof of this, I refer the reader to some of his speeches, life of Henry V. Act 4. S. 8. S. 13. &amp;c. &amp;c.If none can please thee, but a princess—go— Meet in the listed field thy gen'rous foe. Sure! if our worthy chief a queen can gain, For us—no matter—we may well be slain! Unwept, unbury'd; to the fowls resign'd; The world's last dregs; the refuse of mankind! We, worthless souls! were born for him alone, And, from our necks, he mounts into the throne! But go, proud warrior, if one spark remains Of courage in thy soul, and warms thy veins; Go—meet thy rival—answer his demand— Go—fight the Trojan hero, hand to hand. Yet the vain boaster soon, I trust, will fly, Nor stand the terrors of that deathful eye! These scornful words the haughty youth engage In all the fiery violence of rage; Then, while a groan of indignation broke Deep from his heart, the wrathful hero spoke: 526. Drances, that tongue.] There is a great deal more dialogue in Homer than in Virgil. The Roman poet's are generally set speeches, those of the Greek more in the way of conversation. What Virgil does by two words of a narration, Homer brings about by a speech; he hardly raises one of his heroes out of bed without some talk concerning it. There are not only replies but rejoinders in Homer; a thing scarce ever to be found in Virgil: the consequence whereof is, that there must be in the Iliad many continued conversations, a little resembling common chit-chat. This renders the poem more natural and animated, but less grave and majestic. Pope.Drances, that tongue a stream of words can yield; Then, when our hands are wanted in the field, First in debate! but sure 'tis safer far With words to flourish, than to wage the war; To deal in long harangues, while walls inclose Thee and thy fears; and guard thee from the foes. Remov'd from danger, you can talk aloud, And mouth and bellow to the list'ning croud. Proceed then, dastard, in thy wonted strain; Throw forth a storm of eloquence again: With all thy malice, all thy art, declaim, And brand with cowardice my injur'd fame! Since the full triumphs of the day are thine, And thy own trophies stand as high as mine! Try, try, this hour, thy courage; see! the foes Advance, approach us, and our walls inclose: Lo! in the battle all the troops are join'd! Why halts the fiery Drances yet behind? Shall all thy valour, wretch! consist so long In those swift feet, and in that swifter tongue? I routed, monster! and compell'd to fly?— Who but thyself could forge that shameless lye? Say, was I routed on yon deathful plain, When Tyber's streams ran purple to the main? Where, wretch, didst thou sit brooding o'er thy fear, When Pallas bled beneath my vengeful spear? When, all in heaps, his vanquish'd troops retir'd Before this arm, or round their lord expir'd. Or where?—when both the giant brethren fell; When thousands more my faulchion plung'd to hell In one victorious day, tho' compass'd round With foes, and press'd within the hostile mound? All, all, but thou, stood witness to the sight! Nor didst thou dare look out upon the fight! 'Tis a destructive war—Go, dastard go, And preach that rule you practise, to the foe; At once avow that int'rest you embrace: Go, and alarm our friends, our arms disgrace; But praise and honour a twice-vanquish'd race. Tell, tell the croud, how ev'ry Argive lord And monarch trembled at the Phrygian sword; That Tydeus' son, that Peleus' baffled heir, Retir'd from Hector, nor cou'd stand his war; That Aufidus himself, with sudden dread, When on his banks Æneas rais'd his head, Ran back, astonish'd, to his native bed. Such are his base suggestions, which appear 573.—or his dissembled fear.] Vel cum se pavidum contra mea jurgia fingit. Quintilian, B. 9. C. 3. produces this verse as containing an ?????????, which at present we have no marks of. Heinsius is inclined to read mis according to the emendation of J. Marius Matius in his forty-ninth chapter of annot. various authors: ? Contra mis jurgia fingit. Mis is the old genitive case of ??? ego, according to Festus; and is a word used more than once by Ennius. Quintilian informs us, that mis is used by Virgil; but it is not at present to be found in any part of his works. Cum sint autem verba propria ficta tralata, propriis dignitatem dat antiquitas. Nam &amp; sanctiorem &amp; magis admirabilem efficiunt orationem, quibus non quilibet usurus: eoque ornamento acerrimi judicii poeta Virgilius unice est usus. Olli enim &amp; quianam &amp; mis &amp; pone pellucent, &amp; aspergunt illam, quæ etiam picturis est gratissima, vetustatis inimitabilem arti auctoritatem. B. 8. C. 3. See Vossius concerning Virgil's obsolete terms, Inst. Orat. 4. p. 15. Some think that vel is the obsolete term hinted at by Quintilian in this passage. I shall beg leave to close this dry remark with Mr. Pope's admirable sentiments on the use of old words: “A just and moderate mixture of old words may have an effect like the working old abbey-stones into a building, which I have sometimes seen to give a kind of venerable air, and yet not destroy the neatness, elegance, and equality, requisite to a new work; I mean without rendering it too unfamiliar, or remote from the present purity of writing, or from that ease and smoothness which ought always to accompany narration or dialogue. In reading a stile judiciously antiquated, one finds a pleasure not unlike that of travelling on an old Roman way: but then the road must be as good, as the way is antient; the stile must be such in which we may evenly proceed, without being put to short stops, by sudden abruptnesses, or puzzled by frequent turnings and transpositions: no man delights in furrows and stumbling-blocks: and let our love to antiquity be ever so great, a fine ruin is one thing, and an heap of rubbish another.” Postscript to the Odyssey. Milton and Philips, and perhaps some other writers of blank verse, have used too many obsolete and antiquated words; and, as B. Johnson says of Spencer, for that reason, Write no language; I mean in such parts of their poems as are stuffed with such expressions. Mr. Pope has well observed, that the imitators of Milton, like most other imitators, are not copies, but caricatura's of their original; they are an hundred times more obsolete and cramp than he, and equally so in all places: whereas it should have been observed of Milton, that he is not lavish of his exotic words and phrases every-where alike; but employs them much more, where the subject is marvellous, vast, and strange, as in the scenes of heaven, hell, and chaos, than where it is turned to the natural and agreeable, as in the pictures of Paradise, the loves of our first parents, the entertainments of angels, and the like.False as himself; or his dissembled fear Of my revenge: that vanity resign; Such blood shall never stain a sword like mine! Still may thy soul dismiss that idle care, Lurk in that abject breast, and tremble there!— But to resume, O king! our great debate (Your dread commands), the solemn cares of state: Since on our arms no farther stress you lay, But lose at once all courage, with the day; If, on this one defeat, our hopes are o'er; If all our future prospects are no more; Gods! let us raise these coward hands, to gain Peace, pardon, life; and court the victor's chain! Yet, O ye princes! did the least remains Of our bold fathers courage warm our veins; Those I shou'd ever deem the truly great, Those, who in fields of battle brave their fate; Those, who, to 'scape that shame, with glory fir'd, Bled; and, at once, triumphantly expir'd! But since a yet-unbroken force we find, Confed'rate towns, and nations still behind; Since Troy, so nobly by our troops withstood, Has bought her glory with her dearest blood; Since, in their turn, the tempest threatens all; Since, with the vanquish'd, the proud victors fall; Why, on our first attempt, this low despair? This flight, before the trumpet calls to war? 600. Time oft has succour'd, &amp;c.] What the critics call sentences or moral reflections, should be rarely introduced in an epic poem. The poet should instruct by the circumstances of his narration, and the noble behaviour of his hero, and not by direct and downright precepts. The sentences of Virgil seldom exceed one verse: Most of them, says Segrais, are still shorter, and thrown into the form of a transition; but are most frequently put into the mouth of some hero. Young readers, who are charmed with this figure of speaking, accuse Virgil for what is a great instance of his judgment. This is what Petronius observes in the beginning of his satire; he attributes the decay of eloquence to the declaimers; and says, that they infected the youth of Rome with a false taste; nunc rerum &amp; sententiarum vanissimo strepitu hoc tantum perficiunt. If they read an author, they retain only such passages; and the taste which they have for this sort of beauty, makes them not reflect on the propriety of the time and place in which it is introduced: whereas all that constitutes ornament may become deformity. If the most beautiful nose in the world, or the finest eye imaginable, was out of its proper place, what would it become? One should understand then, what a sentence is. F. Mambrun has largely treated on it in his dissertation on the epopœia. He defines it according to Aristotle, Enuntiatio non de singularibus, sed universalibus. He tells us it ought to consist principally of three qualities: the first is, that it should be deliver'd in plain and general terms; the second, that it be short; the third, that it regard the manners. The reason of the first quality, that it should be general and evident, is, because it doth not instruct otherwise, and would be without any weight; of the second, because it would be tedious, and insipid. And, lastly, it should treat of the manners, in order to exclude all precepts and maxims relating to arts more foreign and abstruse, which conduce nothing to the instruction of a man of honour, which is the end of the epic poem. I must add to this remark of Segrais, that the affectation of moralizing, and stuffing in sentences and reflections on human life, has greatly disfigured our English modern tragedy. Then crush'd by rules, and weaken'd as refin'd, For years the pow'r of tragedy declin'd; From bard to bard the frigid caution crept, Till declamation roar'd, while passion slept. Yet still did virtue deign the stage to tread; Philosophy remain'd, tho' nature fled. Mr. Samuel Johnson. It will not be improper to conclude this note with some excellent observations of N. Heinsius, in his preface before Val. Flaccus: Perpetuus [Lucanus] declamator, &amp; sine ullo judicio, inanes quasdam sententias, ut scholasticus, infarciens, tumore &amp; fastu solo conspicuus est.—Nam non moramur perversum illorum hominum judicium, qui omnis disciplinæ poeticæ ignarissimi, statim scriptorem venerantur, &amp; laudibus in cœlum vehunt, ubi graves quasdam de moribus sententias, &amp; longas de vitiis &amp; virtutibus disputationes, versibus comprehensas offendunt. —And afterwards; speaking of the action of a poem: Omne autem poetæ munus sola heroicæ istius actionis narratione absolvitur, quæ per omnes epici carminis leges &amp; partes producta, vicem inanium disputationum implet; &amp; non tam ex sententiarum pondere, &amp; dictorum gravitate, quam ex ipsa actione lector ea addiscere debet, quæ poeta docere animo suo proposuit. Ipsa illustria veterum heroum gesta, sive quæ gessisse finguntur, animos legentium afficere &amp; attrahere oportet.—Inspice omnium consensu habitum poetarum principem Virgilium, &amp;c.Time oft has succour'd an endanger'd state By some new change, and snatch'd her from her fate! Some kingdoms strange vicissitudes sustain; Now crush'd by fortune, and now rais'd again! What tho' th'Ætolian monarch has deny'd To arm, and bring his forces to our side, Yet, with Messapus, on our part appears Tolumnius, still successful in the wars; And many a glorious chief, who lead their bands, Impatient for renown, from distant lands. Besides our Latian youth, of matchless might, With glory fir'd, and eager for the fight, The Volscian princess leads her valiant train, All sheath'd in brazen armour, to the plain. But since my foes and friends the fight demand; The public peace no longer I withstand: Full well the way to victory I know; In that high hope, I'll dare this dreaded foe, This new Achilles, to the listed field, In all his heav'nly arms, and huge Vulcanian shield! Nor shall my deeds my ancestry disgrace, Nor once degen'rate from my glorious race. For you, O king! for you, my friends, for all, Behold your self-devoted Turnus fall!— Me does my rival to the fight demand? Grant, O ye gods! the challenge still may stand; 626. Nor let.] Though Turnus had recovered his temper a little, during the time of his addressing part of his speech to the king, yet he cannot conclude without falling once more into passion, and giving a severe stroke to Drances.Nor let yon wretch, however you decide My fate, the danger or the fame divide. Meantime Æneas, 'midst the high debate, Leads on his eager troops to seize the gate. The Trojan squadrons, and the Tuscan train, March from the flood, embattled, o'er the plain. Before the godlike prince, the loud report Flew swift, and scar'd the city and the court; The crouds all kindle at the dire alarms, And, fir'd with martial fury, fly to arms. The youth rush forth to war; the sires complain, And strive to stop the growing rage in vain. From either side the diff'rent murmurs rise, And their tumultuous clamours rend the skies. So ring the forests with the feather'd brood, A thousand notes re-echoing thro' the wood: So scream the swans on fair Padusa's bounds; And down the waters float the mingling sounds. Is this an hour, cool methods to devise, And talk of peace? the fiery Turnus cries; Declaim, ye dastards, talk, ye triflers, on, While the proud Trojan arms, and storms the town! He said; and rush'd impetuous to the plain; Lead, lead, brave Volusus, our Ardean train, And summon to the fight the Volscian force; 651. Thou, thou.] This fierce and spirited speech of Turnus judiciously begins at once, without any introductory inquit, or ait.Thou, thou, Messapus, range th'embattled horse, And join great Coras, and his brother's care, Wide o'er the field to spread the op'ning war. All, all, be ready; with divided pow'rs Guard you the passes; you defend the tow'rs. Bend you to battle; and, in firm array, Attend your gen'ral where he leads the way. The troops obey; and, gath'ring at the call, Pour in tumultuous heaps to guard the wall. 660. The pensive father.] The king's accusing himself too late, for having listened to the counsel of Amata, is a fine stroke of nature.The pensive father of the Latian state (Confus'd, amaz'd) suspended the debate; And his own conduct blames, that he resign'd To the queen's counsel his compliant mind; On such wrong motives rais'd an impious war, And robb'd the Trojan of the promis'd fair. To sink a trench before the gates, they run, Fix the strong pile, and roll the pond'rous stone. Alarm'd, and summon'd by the trumpet's sound, Boys, maids, and matrons, croud the ramparts round. All aids these dire extremities demand, Fire ev'ry heart, and strengthen ev'ry hand. Now, with the queen, the matrons in a train 673.—To Minerva's fane.] It was a privilege of the Roman ladies (says Catrou) to be carried in a chariot to the gates of the temples. Virgil alludes to this custom in representing Amata and Lavinia carried to the temple of Pallas. But the worship of this goddess was introduced into Italy by Æneas; and the poet speaks of a temple dedicated to her, already existing at Laurentum. However, these anachronisms are allowable in poetry. The prayer to the goddess is translated from Homer: O awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid! Troy's strong defence, unconquer'd Pallas, aid! Break thou Tydides' spear, and let him fall, Prone on the dust, before the Trojan wall. Pope, Iliad 6. v. 380.Ride with large presents to Minerva's fane: Lavinia grac'd her side; the royal fair; The guiltless cause of this destructive war. To earth her streaming eyes the maid inclin'd; In sad procession move the croud behind. They burn rich odours at the sacred shrine, And seek, with suppliant pray'r, the pow'rs divine: Against the Phrygian pirate, lend thy aid, O queen of battles! great Tritonian maid! Break, break his jav'lin; let him meet his fate, And grind the dust beneath our lofty gate! Meanwhile in arms the furious Turnus shone: 685.—Drew the corslet on.] Macrobius, B. 5. c 20. and 6. 7. and A. Gellius, Noc. Att. c. 6. read rutilum thoraca. Thus V. Flaccus, B. 7. 620. ? Prior ense sequaci Æquat humo truncos, rutilum thoraca secanti, Aut primas a matre manus ? But we have Argivum ensem, Æneid 2. and, in another part of Virgil, Cuspidem Ausoniam; Cytæam cassidem in V. Flaccus, B. 5. and Cassidem Auruncam in Silius Italicus. Heinsius.First, the brave hero drew the corslet on; Thick scales of brass the costly work infold: His manly legs he cas'd in greaves of gold. Bare was his face; and, with a martial pride, The starry sword hung glitt'ring at his side. Bold and exulting, with a dauntless air, The mighty chief anticipates the war; In his fond hopes already has he won The field, before the battle is begun. The golden splendors, dazling to the view, Flash'd from his arms, and lighten'd as he flew. 696. So the gay.] Mr. Pope very justly observes, that this simile is better apply'd by Homer to Paris, than by Virgil to Turnus. Yet, take the simile as a desription abstractedly, Virgil's is by far the most noble: ?????? ?????? ???????? ????????. Is a most harmonious echo to the sense: but, as Dr. Trapp observes, Emicat, arrectisque fremit cervicibus alte Luxurians, luduntque jubæ per colla, per armos, will perhaps be a match for it. Ennius has imitated this simile from Homer, Lib. 2. Annal. Et tum sicut equus qui de præsepibus altis Vincla suis magnis animis abrupit; &amp; inde Fert sese campi per cœrula, lataque prata, Celso pectore, sæpe jubam quassat simul altam: Spiritus ex anima calida spumas agit albas. It is a great pity, that so much of Ennius is lost: Virgil, we find, has closely imitated him in many passages which are preserved; and we may with reason suppose, that he has improved upon numberless passages in Ennius's poems, which are now perished. Where Ennius imitated a fine passage from Homer, it was customary with Virgil to refine (as I have before hinted) upon Ennius's imitation. Tasso (says Mr. Pope) has improved the justness of this simile in his 16th book, Stan. 28. where Rinaldo, returning from the arms of Armida to battle, is compared to the steed that is taken from his pastures and mares, to the service of the war; the reverse of the circumstance better agreeing with the occasion. I shall transcribe the passage, in Fairfax's translation: As a fierce steed, for age withdrawn from war, Wherein the glorious beast had always won, That in vile rest, from fight sequester'd far, Feeds with the mares at large, his service done, If arms he see, or hear the trumpet's jar, He neigheth loud, and thither fast doth run, And wishes on his back the armed knight, Longing for justs, for tournament, and fight. There is a very elegant simile in Spenser, F. Q. B. 2. C. 3. Stanza 36. which, tho' the subject of it be different from this, yet as its circumstances bear some relation to it, I hope the reader will excuse my transcribing: As fearfull fowle that long in secret cave, For dread of soaring hawke herself has hid, Not caring how, her silly life to save, She her gay painted plumes disorderid, Seeing at last herself from danger rid, Peeps forth, and soon renews her native pride; She gins her feathers foule-disfigured Proudly to prune, and set on ev'ry side, So shakes off shame, ne thinks how she herselfe did hide.So the gay pamper'd steed, with loosen'd reins, Breaks from the stall, and pours along the plains; With large smooth strokes he rushes to the flood, Bathes his bright sides, and cools his fiery blood; Neighs as he flies; and, tossing high his head, Snuffs the fair females in the distant mead; At ev'ry motion, o'er his neck reclin'd, Plays his redundant mane, and dances in the wind. Him, at the gate, thus issuing to the plain, Camilla meets with all her female train; Leaps in a moment from her gen'rous steed; The beauteous band alight with equal speed: Prince, if the bold and brave (she cries) may dare Trust their own valour for success in war; Myself, with these, will stand the Trojan force; Myself will vanquish all the Tuscan horse. Guard thou the city; be that province thine; But let the dangers of the field be mine. O queen! thy country's pride, the chief replies (And on the dread virago fix'd his eyes); To such uncommon worth, heroic maid! What thanks are due? what honours can be paid? Since those, and death, you scorn with equal pride, With me, the labours of the day divide. The Trojan, bent his fraudful scheme to frame (In this my spies confirm the voice of fame), Has sent, before, his active troops, who wield The lighter arms, to scour the open field. Meantime himself, along the lofty crown Of yon steep mountain, hastens to the town. But, in the wood, an ambush I prepare, And try to foil him in the wiles of war. He lies imprison'd in that narrow streight; And, if he moves, he rushes on his fate. Go thou, supported by our Latian force, Go—with spread ensigns meet the Tuscan horse. Great Tybur's brothers, both renown'd in might, With brave Messapus, wait thee to the fight. Beneath thy care, shall march the martial band, Fir'd by thy high example and command. This said; each chief he rous'd to arms, and goes With eager speed to circumvent the foes. A winding vale there lay, within the shade Of woods, by nature for an ambush made. To this, a rough and slender passage led; Above, a smooth and level plain was spread, Unknown, and stretching o'er the mountain's head. There safe, the soldier, to the left or right, May dare th'ascending war, and urge the fight; Roll rocky fragments from the craggy brow, And dash the pond'rous ruins on the foe. Hither the prince (for well he knew the way) Flew, seiz'd the post, and close in ambush lay. But now Latonia, in th'ethereal sphere, For her Camilla touch'd with anxious fear, Bespoke swift Opis, in a mournful strain, A nymph, and one of her own virgin train: Alas! dear Opis, my Camilla goes To seek the fatal war, and brave the foes; See! where she rushes to the deathful plain, And proudly wears Diana's arms in vain! Still from my soul the darling maid I lov'd; And time the growing fondness has improv'd; 759. E'er since stern Metabus.] Tasso has applied this story of Camilla to Clorinda, as it is related by her eunuch Arsetes: he has introduced many additional and romantic circumstances. See B. 12. Stanza 20. &amp;c.E'er since stern Metabus, her hapless sire, Forc'd by his rebel subjects to retire, Fled from Privernum, his imperial town, And lost his old hereditary crown. Safe he convey'd, thro' crouds of raging foes, His babe, the dear companion of his woes, And call'd Camilla, from her mother's name; And in his flight thro' wilds and deserts came; The savage hills and woods he wander'd o'er, And in his arms the lovely burden bore; While with their jav'lins, in an endless tide, The Volscians press'd their prince on ev'ry side: 771. When lo!] There is something exceedingly wild and romantic, and very amusing to the imagination, in this part of the story of the infant Camilla. The circumstance in line 776. is very tender.When lo! old Amasenus' streams delay His course, and foam across the warrior's way: For late, the flood, increas'd with sudden rains, Had burst the banks, and floated half the plains. First he resolves to swim, and gain the shore; But love retards him, and the charge he bore. Thus, while a thousand schemes divide his breast, Sudden, on this, he fixes as the best: His mighty pond'rous spear, of knotted oak, Long harden'd in the flames, the monarch took; To this strong lance the tender babe he bound, 782. With cork.] There is a large wood of cork-trees just on the other side of Piperno (see v. 540. in the original); and the tree is common about all those parts. Spence.With cork and pliant osiers wrapt around. Then pois'd the loaded spear, in act to throw; But for my favour first address'd his vow: To thee, chaste goddess of the forest wild, Behold! a father dedicates his child; She flies for refuge to thy pow'r divine, And the first weapons that she knows are thine. Thus then I send, to thy protecting care, Thy little suppliant thro' the fields of air. This said; with all his force the lance he threw; High o'er the roaring waves Camilla flew; Then the bold warrior, press'd on ev'ry side By his fierce foes, plung'd headlong in the tide, The flood surmounted, and the jav'lin tore, Charg'd with the sacred infant, from the shore. Each town with stern unhospitable hate, Against the wand'ring monarch shut her gate: Nor could he bear (his scorn was grown so high) To stand distinguish'd by the public eye. From all society of men he fled; A shepherd's life among the mountains led; There with his daughter past the hours away, In dens of beasts, and savages of prey; 805.—Sought ev'ry foster-mother.] ? ? ?? ??? ???????? ??????? ????? ???????? ? ??? ???? ????? ??????? []???? ???????? ?????, ???? ??????? ???????? ???? ??????? ???????? ???? ?????????? ?? ????????, ??????? ?? ????????? ??????? ?????? ?????. ? Pindar.Sought ev'ry foster-mother of the wood, And in her lips distill'd the milky food. Soon as the little Amazon could go; He on her shoulders hung a slender bow: A small light quiver at her side she wore, And in her hand a pointed jav'lin bore. No rich embroider'd robes her limbs enfold, Nor were her waving locks adorn'd with gold. The spoils of some fierce tyger wrapt her round, That, from her head, hung trailing to the ground: Ev'n then her tender hand the dart could fling, Or whirl the pebble from the sounding sling, Strike the long crane, or snowy swan, on high, And fetch the tow'ring quarry from the sky. Her charms surpris'd the Tuscan matron train, Who court the huntress for their sons in vain. Not all their courtship, nor their pray'rs, could move The maid, from sworn virginity, to love. With Dian's love content, she keeps her vow; She shoots my arrows, and she bends my bow. Ah! from my soul I wish, the hapless fair Had never mingled in the direful war! Then still my darling might the maid remain, The pride and glory of my virgin train! But, since her doom is seal'd, her fate is nigh, Descend, my nymph, this instant from the sky. To yonder plain, impetuous, bend thy flight, Where, see! in arms she rushes on the fight. Here, take my bow; and, from this dreadful sheath, Draw forth the winged messenger of death. And, who the sacred virgin shall destroy, Or of the Latian bands, or sons of Troy, With this keen arrow make my vengeance good; Let him atone the sacrilege with blood. Then will I bear the breathless maid away, Her spoils and body in a cloud convey, To the dark grave commend her dear remains, And safe dispose 'em in her native plains. The goddess said; the nymph obedient flies, Wrapt in a sounding whirlwind, down the skies. 845. Now to the walls.] The infantry conducted by Æneas advanced towards the city by narrow passes; and the Etruscan cavalry, under the command of Tarchon, march'd to Laurentum over the plains. Catrou.Now to the walls (a close-embody'd force) March the swift Trojan and the Tuscan horse; Beneath their valiant chiefs, in thick array, The troops embattled urge their fiery way. Aloft the foaming coursers prance and bound, Press on the rein, and proudly paw the ground. Trembling for joy, they hope the dire alarms; The fields gleam dreadful with their waving arms. Spears, nodding helms, and shields, with mingled rays, Flame round, and set the region in a blaze. Nor with less speed, beneath Messapus' care, 856. The Latian troops.] ? Celeresque Latini. He alludes to the Roman soldiery; Romulus had three hundred horsemen, which were called celeres, either from their swiftness [celeritate]; or from their leader Celer, who is said to have slain Remus: for which action Romulus made him a tribunus equitum, and he was called tribunus celerum. Servius.The Latian troops pour furious to the war. Full in the front the mighty Coras came, With bold Catillus, to the field of fame. O'er all distinguish'd in the martial scene, Rode with her female train the Volscian queen. Fierce to the sight the valiant troops advance, Protend, and poise, and shake the flaming lance. Thick clouds of dust their trampling feet excite; Th'impatient coursers neigh, and snuff the distant fight. At length, within a jav'lin's reach appear Both hosts; and, shouting, join the horrid war; Rouse to the fight their gen'rous steeds, and pour Their darts incessant, in a rattling show'r. In one dark storm the sounding lances fly, Shade the bright sun, and intercept the sky. First, horse to horse, and man to man, oppos'd, The bold Aconteus and Tyrrhenus clos'd; Each eager warrior hurl'd the pointed spear, And urg'd his courser in a full career; The steeds, encount'ring with a thund'ring sound, Shock; and Aconteus tumbles to the ground. Swift, as discharg'd from the loud engine flies The glowing stone, or lightning from the skies; So swift the warrior, from his courser far, Shoots with a spring, and breathes his fiery soul in air. Now all the Latian horse disorder'd run, (Their shields slung back) tumultuous, to the town. The chace with cries the joyful Trojans led, With great Asylas thund'ring at their head. Soon as they reach'd the walls, the rallying train Rein round their steeds, and face the foes again. Then, in their turn, the vanquish'd Trojans wheel'd, And, pale with terror, measur'd back the field. 882. Thus, in alternate.] These are some of the most laboured and spirited lines in this 11th book. The simile is not borrowed from Homer; yet is, notwithstanding, great and sublime; as is likewise the description, that immediately follows, of the hurry and tumult of the battle; particularly, Tum vero et gemitus, &amp;c.Thus, in alternate tides, o'er all the strand Swells the vast ocean, and invades the land. Wave after wave, the waters mount on high, Till o'er the rocks the foamy surges fly. Then headlong, in her turn, the roaring main Rolls back, impetuous, to her bounds again; Rolls back, as rapid as she came before, With all the floating trophies of the shore. Twice the Rutulians to the city flew; And twice they rally, and the foes pursue. Till in the third assault the hosts engage; Then burns the fight with unextinguish'd rage. All, man to man, and breast to breast, oppos'd, In one dire shock the charging squadrons clos'd. Then bled the battle; and a load of slain, Shields, helms, and jav'lins, cover'd wide the plain. In a red deluge all the fields lie drown'd; And cries and agonizing groans resound Of wounded warriors, lab'ring out their breath, And coursers plunging in the pangs of death. With cautious eyes, Orsilochus from far Observ'd strong Remulus, and mark'd for war; Nor durst approach the chief; but hurl'd the spear, With all his strength, beneath his courser's ear. Stung with the stroke, and madding with the wound, He rears, and paws in air, with many a bound, And casts his hapless master on the ground. Next bled Iolas by Catillus' steel; 917. Herminius lies.] The name Herminius is taken from the Roman history: Herminius and Lartius opposed the Tusci, when the Pons Sublicius was broken down. Servius.By the same hand the huge Herminius fell: All pale in death the mighty hero lies; Vain were his giant arms, and giant size: Th'intrepid chief (his head and shoulders bare, Tall, and distinguish'd by his golden hair) Tow'r'd in the front, the mark of all the war! Thro' his broad shoulders past, the deadly wound Contracts, and bends him double to the ground. Now all the fields with crimson streams are dy'd: And the vast carnage smokes on ev'ry side. The charms of honour ev'ry bosom fire, To win the day; or gloriously expire. Her breast half-naked, thro' the direful scene Of blood and slaughter flew the Volscian queen. The shafts and quiver at her side appear, The polish'd bow, and all Diana's war. Now the swift dart with matchless might she cast; Now with her ax she laid the battle waste: Ev'n when she flies, she bends the backward bow, And sends the winged vengeance at the foe. Around, in pomp, her sister warriors ride, All-bright in arms, and combat side by side. 939. There, Tarpeia wields, &amp;c.] Servius, and after him, Catrou, tells us, that the names of Camilla's companions, are all drawn from the Roman history, and are here introduced as a compliment to some illustrious families in Rome.Her brazen pole-ax, there, Tarpeia wields; And, here, Larina glitters o'er the fields; Italian virgins; her supreme delight; In peace her friends; her comrades in the fight. 943. So round their queen.] In this simile (says Dr. Trapp) the ideas seem too near a-kin; it is almost comparing a thing to itself.—The poet, it must be owned, compares Amazons to Amazons; yet at the same time, an image intirely new is represented. Virgil, that he may give us as grand an idea as possible of this female hero, attended by her companions, tells us that she resembled Hippolyte or Penthesilea, the most renowned of Amazons, marching o'er the banks of Thermodoon; the pictis armis, the Martia curru se Penthesilea refert, the magno ululante tumultu, the flumina Thermodoontis, and the peltis lunatis, are circumstances which sufficiently clear the simile from Dr. Trapp's imputation. Besides (as Catrou remarks) Camilla is not really an Amazon, in the true sense of the word; that is, her left breast was not sear'd off for the convenience of drawing the bow: she is indeed a female warrior, as were the Amazons; and, like them too, has the left side uncover'd in fight. The true Amazons were those of Thrace only, and spoken of in this comparison. Ruæus tells us, that the Amazons inhabited not the European, but the Asiatic Thrace. But, after all, I much doubt the story of the Amazons being so call'd from having one breast cut off; because, in all the numerous antique figures of Amazons now remaining, there is not one instance of any such thing.So round their queen, Hippolyte the fair, Or bold Penthesile's refulgent car, Move the triumphant Amazonian train, In bright array, exulting, to the plain. Proudly they march, and clash their painted arms, And all Thermodoon rings with proud alarms; With female shouts they shake the sounding field; And fierce they poise the spear, and grasp the moony shield. 951. Who first, who last.] Thus Homer, Il B. 16. turns his discourse to Patroclus: Who first, brave hero, by thy arm was slain? Who last beneath thy vengeance press'd the plain? Pope, 847. He does not accost his muse, as it is usual with him to do; but inquires of the hero himself who was the first, and who was the last who fell by his hand. This address, says Mr. Pope, distinguishes and signalizes Patroclus (to whom Homer uses it more frequently than I remember on any other occasion) as if he was some genius, or divine being; and at the same time it is very pathetical, and apt to move our compassion.Who first, who last, by thy victorious hand, Heroic maid! sunk breathless on the sand? First, Clytius' son, the great Eumenius, dies; Thro' his broad breast the quiv'ring jav'lin flies: Grimly he grinds the dust, distain'd with blood, And rolls and welters in the crimson flood. Liris and Pagasus at once are kill'd, And both, transfix'd, fall headlong on the field: One stoop'd, to reach his wounded courser's rein; One flew, to prop his sinking friend, in vain! Now Hippotas' brave son Amastrus fell; And now she threatens, with the pointed steel, Tereus the swift, Harpalycus the strong; And drove in heaps the hostile chiefs along. Demophoon, Chromis, fled her dreadful spear; She pours, and hangs tempestuous in the rear. Thus thro' the ranks of war she rag'd, and slew A Phrygian foe with ev'ry dart she threw. The mighty hunter, Ornytus, from far, On his Apulian courser sought the war: A bull's black hide his ample shoulders spread; A wolf's rough spoils grinn'd horrid o'er his head: A bended spear he brandish'd in his hand, And tow'r'd conspicuous o'er the martial band. With ease, as all the troops confus'dly fled, She slew the foe, and thus insults the dead: Me, Tuscan, didst thou deem thy destin'd prey, Like hunted game, the fortune of the day? Lo! by a woman's arm, this fatal hour, That boast is answer'd, and thy vaunts no more! Go!—let thy sire the glorious tidings know; Camilla sent thee to the shades below! Then on two Trojan chiefs, of giant size, Butes, and tall Orsilochus, she flies. But Butes, face to face, she brav'd in war; Swift thro' the neck she drove the pointed spear, Where the bright helm and corslet left a part, To let in fate, wide-open to the dart. From fierce Orsilochus the virgin wheel'd At first, in flight dissembled, round the field: But, in a ring still lessening, to delude The furious chief, she fled, till she pursu'd: Then while, in vain, her circumvented foe Implores his life; high-rising to the blow, Cleaves his broad front with a redoubled wound; The blood and brains rush smoking to the ground. The son of Aunus cross'd her in her way, And for a while stood trembling in dismay; A wretch, that, like his own Ligurian line, Could cheat, while fortune favour'd the design. Soon as he found it vain to shun by flight The female warrior, or maintain the fight; Resolv'd to circumvent the hostile maid, Thus to the queen the low dissembler said: Where is the mighty praise, to vaunt the force, And trust the swiftness, of your rapid horse? Dismiss your steed, vain maid! and let us stand Engag'd in single combat, hand to hand. Soon shall be known, proud princess, what you can, When, on these terms, a woman fights a man. Thus he:—the queen springs furious on the plain From her fleet steed, and gives him to the train. On foot she dares the dastard to the field, 1014.—And grasps her maiden shield.] By the pura parma Catrou understands, that Camilla had never made a campaign, and had as yet atchieved no action, to be painted or engraved on her shield.Draws her bright sword, and grasps her maiden shield. Flush'd with gay hopes, to find his fraud succeed, He turns, he flies, and, to his utmost speed, With goring spurs provokes his smoking steed.— Deluded fool! (she cries, in lofty strain) On me thy little arts are try'd in vain; Nor hence, ev'n yet, in safety shalt thou run, To please thy sire with falshoods like his own. 1022. And, springing with a fiery course.] This action of Camilla, in which she is represented on foot, outrunning an horse at full speed, and seizing his bridle, would have appeared too incredible to the reader, had not the poet judiciously prepared him for it in those celebrated verses at the close of the seventh book, where the surprising swiftness of our heroine is described. Catrou and Segrais.She said; and, springing with a fiery course, The raging maid out-stripp'd the flying horse; Turn'd, seiz'd the reins; oppos'd in battle stood; Then gluts her vengeance with his reeking blood. 1026. Not with more ease.] Spenser has, I think, improved this image, F. Q. B. 2. Cant. 11. St. 42. ? adown he kest This lumpish corse unto the senslesse ground, Adown he kest it with so puissant wrest, That back again it did aloft rebound, And gave against his mother earth a groneful sound. 43. As when Jove's harnesse-bearing bird from hie Stoupes at a flying heron with proude disdain, The stone dead quarry falls so forcibly, That it rebounds against the lowly plain. The disuse of falconry among us renders this simile not so striking, as it must have been in the age of the poet.Not with more ease the falcon, from above, Shoots, seizes, gripes, and rends, the trembling dove; All stain'd with blood, the beauteous feathers fly, And the loose plumes come flutt'ring down the sky. Meantime th'almighty sire of men and gods, Inthron'd in high Olympus' bright abodes, Surveys the war; the Tuscan chief inspires With gen'rous rage, and fills with martial fires. Thro' all the cleaving ranks, with eager speed, Flies the bold Tarchon on his rapid steed; Calls on each chief by name; adjures the train, Leads, rallies, and inflames the troops again. Ye scandal of your race, your country's shame! Warm'd with no honour, no regard of fame! What fear, ye cowards, ev'ry breast controuls, Un-nerves your limbs, and chills your trembling souls? Thus then, from one flies all our scatter'd band! Gods!—but from one, and from a female hand! Oh! cast away the sword, the shield and spear; The idle pomp and pageantry of war!— Yet were you never recreants to delight, Nor to the softer battles of the night! When pipes proclaim the sacred revels nigh, How swift, how eager, to the feast you fly! In the full bowls you centre all your love; Pleas'd, when the priest invites you to the grove, You run, and riot in the rich repast; The first at banquets, but in fights the last! He said; and, bent on death, in deep despair, Rush'd on his steed amidst the thickest war: Then urg'd at Venulus his furious course, Seiz'd him at once, and snatch'd him from his horse, 1058. Thus in his arms, with matchless strength, he bore.] This action seems to be impossible; but Servius gives us an example of its possibility, drawn from the ephemerides of C. Cæsar. Julius Cæsar himself us'd to relate, that he was lifted up [after this manner] by a Gaul; who as he was carrying him along, met in his way with another Gaul who knew Cæsar, and cried out lecos Cæsar. These words by good luck meant, in their language [says Catrou], laisse le aller, let him go. The Gaul instantly dropp'd his prey out of favour to his brother soldier. Plutarch reports the same thing of a Roman.Thus in his arms, with matchless strength, he bore, Fierce as he rode, the hapless chief, before. His troops behold the scene with strange surprize, And peals of shouts run rattling round the skies; While with his captive, all in open view, O'er the wide field the fiery hero flew. The point then breaking from the warrior's dart, The chief explores a penetrable part, And meditates the wound; the struggling foe Defends his throat, and disappoints the blow. 1068. As when th'imperial.] Macrobius prefers to this simile that in Homer, Il. B. 12. for a reason which proves he misunderstood the aim and application of it. Virgil simply compares two warriors struggling with each other to an eagle, &amp;c. But Macrobius observes, Virgilius solam aquilæ prædam refert, neque Homericæ aquilæ omen advertit; quæ &amp; sinistra veniens vincentium prohibebat accessum, &amp; accepto a captivo serpente morsu prædam dolore dejecit; factoque tripudio solistimo cum clamore dolorem testante prætervolat: quibus ominibus victoriæ prævaricatio significabatur. His prætermissis, quæ animam parabolæ dabant, velut exanimum in Latinis versibus corpus remansit. This simile is certainly drawn from Homer; but what is here a simile, is a narrative in the Greek poet; the not considering which misled the judgment of Macrobius.As when th'imperial eagle soars on high, And bears some speckled serpent thro' the sky: While her sharp talons gripe the bleeding prey, In many a fold her curling volumes play; Her starting brazen scales with horror rise; The sanguine flames flash dreadful from her eyes: She writhes, and hisses at her foe, in vain, Who wings at ease the wide aëreal plain; With her strong hooky beak the captive plies, And bears the struggling prey, triumphant, thro' the skies. So with the chief the mighty Tarchon flew; And, kindling at the sight, the troops their prince pursue. Now Aruns on the Volscian princess waits (Aruns the destin'd victim of the fates); Wheels round, and seeks with ev'ry wily art The favouring moment to discharge the dart. Where-e'er the furious maid her steps inclin'd, The wretch in silence follows close behind: When from the conquer'd foes she bends her course, Thither th'insidious warrior turns his horse; Oft shifts his place; runs anxious to and fro: Flies round the circuit; and, in act to throw, Aims his sure jav'lin at the beauteous foe. 1091. Chloreus, the priest.] It is to be observed (says Catrou), that those priests of the gods, who are introduced as warriors in the Æneid, are distinguished by dresses, &amp;c. of an uncommon magnificence.Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far Shone in bright arms amid the crouded war. Magnificently gay, he proudly press'd A prancing steed, in stately trappings dress'd; Rich scales of brass and gold, inwrought with art, Grac'd with a mimic plumage ev'ry part. Himself, in purple clad, amid the foe Sent his swift arrows from a Lycian bow. Gold was the bow, that from his shoulder sounds, And gold the helmet, that his head surrounds. His robes, with many a rustling silken fold, With care were gather'd, and confin'd in gold: His crimson tunic was embroider'd o'er; And purple buskins on his legs he wore. This chief she singles from the warring crew, And, blind to danger, thro' the squadrons flew; With the rich spoils to deck Diana's shrine; Or that herself in Trojan arms may shine. All, all the woman in her bosom rose! 1110. For this bright prize, &amp;c.] Mr. Addison observes, that Virgil has very finely touched upon the female passion for dress and shew, in the character of Camilla; who, though she seems to have shaken off all the other weaknesses of her sex, is still described as a woman in this particular. The poet tells us, that after having made a great slaughter of the enemy, she unfortunately cast her eye on a Trojan, who wore an embroidered tunic, a beautiful coat of mail, with a mantle of the finest purple. The Amazon immediately singled out this well-dressed warrior, being seized with a woman's longing for the pretty trappings, that he was adorned with: ? Totumque incauta per agmen Fœmineo prædæ &amp; spoliorum ardebat amore. This heedless pursuit after these glittering trifles, the poet, by a nice concealed moral, represents to have been the destruction of his female hero. Spectator, No. 15. This remark of Mr. Addison seems to be taken from Bossu 4. 11.For this bright prize, she plung'd amid the foes! When, from his covert, Aruns launch'd his spear; But first to heav'n preferr'd his suppliant pray'r: O Phœbus! guardian of Soracte's woods, And shady hills; a god above the gods! To whom our natives pay the rites divine, And burn whole crackling groves of hallow'd pine; Walk o'er the fire, in honour of thy name; 1118. Unhurt, unsindg'd.] Pliny, B. 7. tells us, Haud procul urbe Roma familiæ sunt paucæ, quæ vocantur Hyrpiæ quæ sacrificio annuo, quod fit ad montem Soractem Apollinis, super combustam ligni struem ambulantes, non comburuntur. Varro, who is ever inveighing against religious rites (says Servius), mentions a kind of medicinal preparation, which these people made use of, in passing thro' the fire, Eo, uti solent Hirpini ambulaturi per ignem, medicamento plantas ungunt. Aruns belonged to this people or sect.Unhurt, unsindg'd, and sacred from the flame; Give to my favour'd arms, to clear away The deep dark stains of this disgraceful day. Nor spoils nor trophies from the maid I claim; No—to my future life I trust for fame. If by my hand this raging pest be slain, I ask no honour; but retire again, Pleas'd, tho' inglorious, to my native plain. The god consents to half his warm request, But in the fleeting winds dispers'd the rest. Camilla's death was granted to his pray'r; His safe return was lost in empty air. Now as the jav'lin sings along the skies, All to the Volscian princess turn their eyes. 1132. The fair rush'd on.] Our heroine, eagerly engaged in the pursuit of Chloreus, that she may adorn herself with his fine armour, and rich trappings, is intirely regardless of all danger, and so hurried away by the transports of female vanity, that she does not hear the fatal dart of Aruns hiss along the air. Catrou. ? Nihil ipsa neque auræ, Nec sonitus, memor ? Catrou prefers illa to ipsa, as more harmonious; not without the authority of some MSS.The fair rush'd on, regardless of the sound, Till in her pap she felt the fatal wound. Deep, deep infix'd, the pointed weapon stood Full in her heart, and drank the vital blood. Swift to her succour fly her female train, And in their arms the sinking queen sustain; 1138. But far more swift.] Virgil draws the character of Aruns with great propriety; he attacks Camilla not openly, like an hero of true bravery; but secretly and by stratagem, insidiis, &amp; tempore capto; and after having killed her, he does not await the event of his victory, but skulks away like a guilty person.But far more swift affrighted Aruns fled, With fear and joy, nor turn'd his guilty head: Back he retires, all-trembling and dismay'd; Nor cou'd he bear, in death to view the dreadful maid! As when a prowling wolf, whose rage has slain Some stately heifer, or the guardian swain, Flies to the mountain with impetuous speed, Confus'd, and conscious of the daring deed, Claps close his quiv'ring tail between his thighs, Ere yet the peopled country round him rise: Not less confus'd, pale Aruns took his flight; Shunn'd ev'ry eye, and mingled in the fight. The dying queen, in agonizing pain, Tugs at the pointed steel, but tugs in vain. Deep-riveted within, the rankling dart Heav'd in the wound, and panted in her heart. 1154. She sinks, she swoons.] Catrou, from the authority of Donatus, has here alter'd the text, from Labitur exanguis, to Labitur et sanguis. Camilla does not fall from her horse till some time afterwards: ? Simul his dictis linquebat habenas, Ad terram non sponte fluens. ? ver. 827. infra. However, this remark may be too refin'd. Labitur exanguis, may very probably mean, she droop'd her head, she swoon'd away at the deadly stroke, tho' she did not then fall from her horse. Our translator seems to have thus understood the passage.She sinks, she swoons, she scarcely draws her breath, And, all-around her, swim the shades of death. The starry splendors languish in her eyes, And from her cheeks the rosy colour flies. A maid she calls, the partner of her cares, Her friend in peace; her sister in the wars. Acca; no more;—for mortal is my wound; A dizzy mist of darkness swims around: The victory was mine; but ah! 'tis past! This hour, this fatal moment, is my last! 1164. Go, and my dying words.] Wonderful (says Dr. Trapp) is the magnanimity of this short speech. She makes no womanish complaints; but employs her last breath in giving orders for the battle: Effuge, &amp; hæc Turno mandata novissima perfer: Succedat pugnæ, &amp;c.Go, and my dying words to Turnus bear; Bid him, this instant to the field repair; This instant, from the town the foe repel:— And now, dear friend, a long and last farewel! With that the queen, expiring, dropp'd the rein, And from her courser sunk upon the plain. In thick short sobs the vital spirit flies, Her head declin'd, and drooping as she dies! Her radiant arms bestrew the field of fight: Her soul, indignant, sought the realms of night. Then, from the hosts the doubling clamours rise, And shouts tumultuous echo to the skies. The Trojan band, a firm determin'd force, The Tuscan chiefs, with all th'Arcadian horse, Rush furious to the field; the slaughter spread; The tumult deepen'd, and the combat bled. Meantime fair Opis, from a mountain's brow, A while unmov'd survey'd the fight below. But when from far she saw Camilla slain, And, round the corse, the shouting hostile train, Deep from her heaving ivory bosom broke A mournful groan, and thus the goddess spoke: Too, too severely, much-lamented maid, For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid! 1188. In vain made.] This sentiment of Opis is by no means injurious to the character of Diana, as if she had not sufficiently protected her votress: it was Camilla's own fault, that she forsook the harmless pleasures of the chace, to engage in martial pursuits. Catrou.In vain made sacred by thy virgin vow To Dian's name, and grac'd with Dian's bow! Nor yet in death thy goddess will disclaim Her favour'd maid, but crown with endless fame! Thy praise shall round the nations be display'd, And to thy fate due vengeance shall be paid. This moment will I make that vengeance good; The guilty wretch shall render blood for blood. Beneath a hill, Dercennus' tomb appears, A potent Latian lord in former years; A grove of venerable oaks display'd, Wide round the monument, a gloomy shade. Hither the goddess took her rapid flight, And spy'd gay Aruns from the tow'ring height. There as the youth exults, and swells with pride, Whither, poor dastard, wouldst thou fly? (she cry'd) Turn, wretch—this moment for thy guilt atone; And for Camilla's death receive thy own. Go—to the shades of hell, her victim, go— A prize unworthy of Diana's bow! She said; and instant from the golden sheath Drew forth the feather'd messenger of death. 1210. Fierce in her rage.] Homer, Il. B. IV. gives us a very minute and circumstantial description of Pandarus drawing his bow against Menelaus; which passage the Roman poet here imitates. But as the shot of Pandarus was of so much importance, as it was the ???? ???????, the foundation of future woes, Homer thought fit, says Mr. Pope [note on ver. 144.] not to pass it over in a few words, like the flight of every common arrow; but to give a description somewhat correspondent to its importance; and afterwards observes, that Virgil has not failed to copy it with the greatest happiness imaginable.—But why should the drawing a bow to kill Aruns, an incident of little consequence, be described with so much circumstantial exactness? All that can be answer'd is, that tho' the death of Aruns be of little consequence, yet in itself it is a grand incident, as it is a revenge for the death of an heroine who has performed so many remarkable exploits. In short, this minute description renders the death of Camilla more significant.Fierce in her rage, the circling horns she bends To the full stretch, and joins the doubling ends. One hand approach'd the point; one drew the bow, And to her breast strain'd the tough nerve below. At once the murd'rer heard the sounding dart, And felt the steely vengeance in his heart. He lies deserted by his social train, Pale and expiring on a foreign plain! While, from the field, triumphant Opis flies, And on spread pinions mounts the golden skies. First fled Camilla's band (their princess kill'd); Then the Rutulians, routed, quit the field. 1222. The chiefs, and armies, run.] ? Desolatique manipli. That is, says Servius, the standard-bearers were deserted. The Roman generals were particularly careful, that the standard-bearer should be well attended with soldiers; as we read in Sallust.Atinas' self, the chiefs, and armies, run, And spur their smoking coursers to the town. Nor can the troops sustain, nor dare oppose The slaught'ring swords of their victorious foes; Athwart their backs th'unbended bows they slung; 1227. And with.] This line, in the original, is usually quoted as an instance of Virgil's adapting the sound to the sense. The translator has done it justice.And with their trampling steeds the sounding champain rung. The city now th'advancing host appalls: A cloud of dust, thick-gath'ring to the walls, 1230. From the tall tow'rs.] Tumult, confusion, and distress, are painted with great force and spirit, and many pathetic strokes, from hence to verse 1252. of the translation. The circumstance of the women renewing their rage at the sight of Camilla's dead body is well imagined.From the tall tow'rs the trembling matrons spy; And female shrieks, tumultuous, rend the sky. Mixt with their foes, rush headlong thro' the gate The Latian squadrons, nor can shun their fate; In vain for shelter to their houses fly; Ev'n there transfixt, in heaps the wretches die. Some close the gates, exclude their social train, Who beg admission to the town in vain. While these defend th'endanger'd posts, and those Rush on their swords, a dreadful slaughter rose. With piercing shrieks, and lamentable cries, The children bleed before their parents eyes. While close behind advanc'd the thund'ring foe; Some leap down headlong to the trench below; Some with loose reins, abandon'd to their fate, Spurr'd their impetuous steeds against the gate. But, when Camilla's corse appear'd in view, Warm'd by their country's love, the women flew, And from the walls a storm of jav'lins threw. With harden'd clubs th'advancing foe they dare, And with tough staves repel the rising war. Fierce they rush on: they glow with martial fire, And for their native walls with joy and pride expire. Meanwhile to Turnus, ambush'd in the shade, The careful nymph the dismal news convey'd; That in the fight the Volscian queen was slain; That the proud foe pursu'd the vanquish'd train, Who, flush'd with full success, rush'd furious on, And spread the growing terror to the town. The chief, (for so his adverse fates requir'd!) Struck with the tidings, and with anger fir'd, All headlong leaves the guarded hills again; But scarce descended to the subject plain, Ere the great Trojan seiz'd the vacant road, Climb'd the tall hill, and issu'd from the wood. By the black clouds of dust, Æneas found The Latian host embattled wide around: And Turnus knew the Dardan chief was near, From the loud shouts, that thicken'd on his ear; 1269. Perceiv'd the footsteps.] The throwing in such lively and minute circumstances is what chiefly distinguishes poetry from history, and renders the former a more close and just representation of life than the latter.Perceiv'd the footsteps of the trampling foe, And heard distinct the fiery coursers blow. Soon had the heroes join'd the horrid fight; But now the sun roll'd down the rapid light; And plung'd, beneath the red Iberian sea, The panting steeds that drew the burning day. Before the city, camp th'impatient pow'rs; These to defend; and those to storm the tow'rs. THE TWELFTH BOOK. I have forborn hitherto (says Segrais) to speak of one of the principal beauties of this poem; which is, the unity and simplicity of its action, and to shew, that it ought to terminate happily; because it seemed to me, that the reader would be more capable of judging of this beauty, when he came to the end of the poem, than when he had not so much as begun it. This rule, that the action should be one and simple, is founded on the authority of Aristotle, and the opinion of all his commentators. But the reasons of this practice are clear of themselves: for if, in general, poetry be an imitative art, there is no doubt, but that the imitation of an object is much more perfect when it is simple, than when not. In the second place, if the poet write to divert, it is as evident, that he will divert and amuse the reader so much the less in bewildering him in a variety of things which he proposes for his subject, than if he had kept only one point in view. The great beauty which springs from this truth, is visibly manifested by the faultiness of its contrary; so that one need only survey the absurdities which arise from a confusion of the subject, to have a just idea of the excellencies of those maxims, which Virgil and Homer have laid down for their patterns. But let us now particularly examine this beauty in the poem before us. Virgil has chosen for the action of the Æneid, the arrival of the hero Æneas in Italy: there is nothing more simple, and at the same time (so great the art of this poet) there is nothing but what is contained in this action, whether past, present, or to come. For tho' Æneas is tost by a tempest; tho' he arrives at Carthage, and relates the history of Troy, and his different adventures; tho' he is beloved by Dido, so that she kills herself for grief at his departure; tho' he afterwards celebrates games at the tomb of his father, descends into hell, and, in fine, comes to make war against the most brave people of Italy; all this doth not fall into the action which is declared in the poet's proposition; and yet, at the same time, what can be more simple, what more truly one, than this action? If you consider the consequence of this action, simple as it appears, it is the foundation of the most illustrious nation, and the most famous empire, that ever existed: and by the incredible address, and wonderful genius, of Virgil, what is there in this divine work derogatory from that grandeur? Or what is there more absurd, than to imagine, that this poem is not complete, because the nuptials of Lavinia are not consummated? There is no need to observe, that the nuptials are not mentioned in the proposition of the poem. Indeed there is much more reason to find fault with Ascanius's not founding the kingdom of Alba; for it must be owned, that the poet says, that the arrival of Æneas in Italy gave rise to the kings of Alba: Albanique patres, atque altæ mœnia Romæ. But we may plainly perceive, that these kings of Alba are not in the action, but a consequence of it; and the poet speaks of them, only to shew the importance of that action. And yet, the same art which Virgil has made use of, in bringing in so apropos every circumstance preceding the arrival of Æneas in Italy, and all that could add to the beauty of his fable, or his subject, has so conducted the matter, that there is nothing omitted, which was subsequent to the action of Æneas, whether it regarded himself, or had any reference to the grandeur of the Cæsars, or the glory of Rome. It is impossible to attempt any supplement to this work, without being obliged to repeat what Virgil has already said; for whether we bring the apotheosis of Æneas, or his unhappy death, and his reigning but three years after having conquer'd Turnus, as a proof of what I have advanced; all this is mentioned in the poem, and each circumstance has its proper place allotted it. In the imprecations which Dido utters against Æneas, 'tis plain that she hints at the misfortune which will befal him, where she says; ? Nec, cum se sub leges pacis iniquæ Tradiderit, regno aut optata pace fruatur: Sed cadat ante diem, mediaque inhumatus arena. And what befel Lavinia, when she was deliver'd of Sylvius, surnamed Posthumus, after the death of Æneas, is plainly expressed in the prediction of Anchises, B. VI. Sylvius, Albanum nomen, tua posthuma proles, Quem tibi longævo serum Lavinia conjux Educet sylvis regem, regumque parentem: Unde genus longa nostrum dominabitur Alba. And, by the way, I must observe, that the word longævo does not signify, that Æneas was then very old (as all the commentators have it); but that he was immortal, as the gods, who are so called, because their life is without end. And this very apotheosis is promis'd by Jupiter in the prediction which he makes B. I. by way of consolation to Venus for the troubles which Æneas was to suffer. And this is again confirmed by what he says to Juno herself, B. XII. Indigetem Æneam scis ipsa, &amp; scire fateris, Deberi cœlo, fatisque ad sidera tolli. In a word, every thing subsequent to the fight between Turnus and Æneas; for instance, the peace made with the Latins by the means of the nuptials of Lavinia; the union of the two nations; and the extinction of the Trojan name; all this, I say, is plainly expressed, in the treaty which Jupiter and Juno make, B. XII. So that, on the whole, we must necessarily conclude, that the action is not only simple, and one, but that it is likewise intirely perfect. All the commentators on Virgil have made the truth of this evidently appear, by giving such strong reasons for it, that it is needless to add any thing farther on this head: and, indeed, the reasons are so self-evident, that the foregoing plain remark will be sufficient to give the reader a clear insight into the whole. The reason why the action should end happily, may be accounted for in the same manner: Since the design in proposing every action is to excite brave men to great and glorious enterprizes, should it be previously known, that it would necessarily end unhappily, it would be rather a means of deterring from, than exciting them to the execution of any grand exploit. I will only add, that, among all the books of the Æneid, there is not one, where the poet has conducted that part which concerns the marvellous, with greater art and address. Surprize and admiration are so frequently raised in this book, that one must quote every passage, if one would remark all that is calculated to raise our wonder and astonishment. Among numberless instances, let us just examine the turns and changes of fortune: A peace is concluded upon; an augury breaks it: A battle ensues: The Trojans are victorious: Æneas is wounded: The Latins repulse the Trojans to their camp; Venus heals Æneas in a miraculous manner: The hero relieves his own party: He cannot oblige Turnus to renew the engagement: He prepares to attack the town of the Latins: At last Turnus is compelled to fight him in single combat: And every thing which happens during this combat, all these taken together, compose the different peripeties of this book; and which detain the reader in such a manner, that it is impossible to desist till he has gone thro' the whole. The Argument. Turnus challenges Æneas to a single combat. Articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutulians, who wound Æneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, and forces Turnus to a duel; with whose death the poem concludes. When Turnus saw the Latians, in despair, Sink with the weight of unsuccessful war, Himself the object of the public spite Mark'd out, and summon'd to the promis'd fight; The furious prince the single combat claims, And conscious courage sets his soul in flames. As, pierc'd at distance by the hunter's dart, The Libyan lion rouses at the smart; And loudly roaring traverses the plain; Scourges his sides; and rears his horrid mane; Tugs furious at the spear; the foe defies; And grinds his teeth for rage, and to the combat flies. So storm'd proud Turnus; and, in wrathful strain, Thus to the king th'impetuous chief began: 15. Where is this Trojan foe.] No contrast can be more finely managed, than the fierceness, the fire, and hastiness, of Turnus's speech (consisting of short, broken sentences, unconnected with particles), oppos'd to the cool reasoning, the sober sedateness, of the good old king Latinus's answer, which immediately follows. The poet himself, to mark this opposition more strongly, has artfully added the preparatory epithet sedato, and introduces Turnus's speech with ? Ita turbidus infit.Where is this Trojan foe, so bold and brave? Would he retract the challenge that he gave? My soul can brook no more delays; I yield To his own terms, and dare him to the field. Renew the truce, perform the sacred rite; This hour, this moment, I demand the fight. This hand shall wipe our late disgrace away (Our hosts may sit spectators of the day!) This trusty sword the dastard shall destroy, And plunge to hell that fugitive of Troy. If not—I'll own him victor of the war, And to his arms resign the royal fair. So spoke the furious prince, with scornful pride. The king with mild benevolence reply'd: The more, brave youth, thy try'd, distinguish'd might And valour drive thee headlong to the fight, The more it should concern our royal care, To weigh the perils and events of war; This fond and youthful ardor to asswage With the cool caution of consid'rate age. How many vanquish'd cities are thy own, Besides a fair hereditary throne! Me too these wealthy warlike lands obey:— Thus both may reign with independent sway. Our realm, brave Turnus, other virgins grace, Of blooming features, and illustrious race. Then, undisguis'd, this truth with patience hear, Tho' harsh and wounding to a lover's ear. All pow'rs forbid, the human and divine, To match our daughter in the Latian line. Won by thy birth, my consort's tears and cries, And my own love, I broke all sacred ties; Robb'd the great Trojan of the plighted fair; Then flew to arms, and wag'd an impious war. From that dire source to tell what mischiefs flow, Would be to mention, what too well you know: Fights, deaths, defeats, that speak the wrath divine; Where all the sad pre-eminence is thine. In two fierce battles routed and o'erthrown, Scarce our last hopes are shelter'd in the town: Huge heaps of bones still whiten all the shore, And the full streams of Tyber smoke with gore. Where am I borne, irresolute and blind? What changeful phrensy turns my wav'ring mind? If, on thy death, the Trojan is my friend, Sure in thy life the stern debate may end! How would all Italy my name disgrace! How all my kindred of thy royal race! Shouldst thou (which heav'n avert!) by me be led To death, the victim of my daughter's bed! If I should hasten to so sad an end My child's fond lover, and my gen'rous friend! Think on the turns of fate, and chance of wars; Pity thy rev'rend father's silver hairs, Who mourns thy absence in thy native town, Nor knows the danger of so dear a son! But no success these warm intreaties found: The proffer'd med'cine but inflam'd the wound. Scarce cou'd he speak for rage, disdain, and pride; But thus at length the fiery youth reply'd: O best of fathers! all this needless care For Turnus' life, at his request, forbear. Life is a trifle I with scorn disclaim, For the bright purchase of immortal fame. This hand, these weapons too, are fatal found; And the blood flies, where Turnus deals the wound. Nor in this combat shall his mother shroud The recreant Trojan in an airy cloud, Nor shield the coward with her aid divine:— This day, ye gods! this glorious day, is mine. But now the frantic queen, on these alarms, Half-dead with fear, hung trembling on his arms: Oh! grant me, Turnus, grant this one request; If ever love or rev'rence touch'd thy breast For lost Amata, to these sorrows yield! Nor meet thy rival in the fatal field. Regard, dear youth, regard my streaming tears, Thou only prop of my declining years! Our sinking house relies on thee alone; On thee, our fame, our empire, and the throne. In thy misfortune must Amata join; Her fate and welfare are involv'd in thine. With thee to death, for refuge, will I run, 98. Nor live a captive.] Virgil here prepares the first part of the unravelling of his poem. This consists in the death of Amata, who obstructs the execution of the marriage of her daughter with Æneas. This obstacle could not be removed, but by the death of this queen. Catrou.Nor live a captive to a Trojan son. 99. With pity touch'd.] This picture shews how great a master Virgil is of grace. Lavinia, strongly affected with the queen's pathetic address to Turnus, weeps for the danger to which he is going to expose himself; and at the same time blushes, and looks downward, from a consciousness of his loving her. Her tears and blushes inflame him afresh with love; he gazes on her with the utmost ardency, and is still more desirous of engaging with Æneas. It is to be observed, that Turnus speaks to the dear object of his wishes with a look only: what eloquence is there implied in figitque in virgine vultus! He gazes only at Lavinia, but speaks his resolution to Amata in express terms. Spenser has borrowed his image of Shamefacedness from this appearance of Lavinia.With pity touch'd, the fair Lavinia hears Her mother's cries, and answers with her tears. A lovely blush the modest virgin warms, Glows in her cheek, and lights up all her charms. So looks the beauteous iv'ry, stain'd with red; So roses, mixt with lilies in the bed, 105.—Then, gazing on the fair.] What Dr. Trapp, in this place, calls a new nominative case, is, I think, extremely elegant: Illum turbat amor, figitque in virgine vultus. He had no occasion to say, Turnum turbat amor; every reader must see Turnus implied in the word illum, as it was for him Lavinia blushed and wept.Blend their rich hues—Then, gazing on the fair, The hero rag'd, more eager for the war. 107. And thus—O royal mother!] Turnus does not stay for an answer from Amata, but instantly goes to arm himself for the fight. This is quite agreeable to his impetuous temper. His pride and pleasure at seeing his steeds approach him instantly after having called for them, is conceived in a most lively manner. As this is the last time of his going to battle, the last decisive day, the poet describes the armour he is putting on, more minutely, and particularly. The image of his snatching, or as it were, violently catching at, his vast spear, which always stood against a massy pillar in the old hall of Latinus, is nobly drawn. This is imitated (but highly improved in every circumstance) from Homer's Odyss. B. I. His address to the spear, while he is shaking it, is quite in character. See Hector arming himself, Il. XIX.And thus—O royal mother! cease your fears, 108. Nor send me.] Tears and apprehensions of danger were deemed, among the antients, bad presages, when the people were going out to war; as a false step, when one is setting out on a journey. Catrou. Jason speaks in the same manner to his mother, Apollon.Nor send me to the fight with boding tears. 'Tis not in me, if heav'n has fix'd my date, To check th'unalterable course of fate. Go, faithful herald, go! and instant bear This dreaded message to the Phrygian's ear: Soon as Aurora's rays the mountain gild, He need not lead his forces to the field: Our single valour shall dispute the day (The hosts in peace the combat shall survey). Thus shall his death or mine the war decide, And the proud victor gain the royal bride. He said; and furious to the palace speeds; There, at his call, rush forth the fiery steeds, Of matchless spirit, and immortal kind, White as the snow, and swifter than the wind. 123. Of old, to great Pilumnus.] How could Orithyia (say the commentators), who was of Attica, and carried by Boreas into Thrace, give these horses to Pilumnus, who was an Italian? Catrou observes, that the fiction is a little forced; and urges, in defence of Virgil, that Pilumnus was a god, and Orithyia a goddess. They had opportunity of knowing each other in the assemblies of the gods; and Pilumnus might receive from her this breed of horses that came from Thrace, where Orithyia reigned.Of old, to great Pilumnus, bold and brave, The sires of these Erectheus' daughter gave. Before their lord the gen'rous coursers bound, Neigh, foam, and fly, and paw the trembling ground; The grooms with combs their flowing manes divide, And gently stroke their chests, and sooth their noble pride. Meantime the hero drew his armour on; With gold and burnish'd brass the cuirass shone. The glitt'ring helmet, next his temples spread; The crimson crest plays dreadful o'er his head; He grasps the pond'rous shield, and flaming blade, The sword that Vulcan for his father made, Of matchless temper; which the fiery god Had plung'd red-hissing in the Stygian flood. Last the bright spear he seiz'd, large, strong, and tall, Propp'd on a column 'midst the lofty hall; The mighty Actor's spoil. The hero shook The beamy jav'lin; and with fury spoke: My trusty spear, still faithful to my hand! Still wing'd with death, to answer my command; Which once brave Actor's arm was wont to wield! And mine now throws; the terror of the field! In this great moment fly, nor fly in vain, But stretch yon Phrygian eunuch on the plain: Oh! give me, thro' his heart thy point to thrust, And soil his scented tresses in the dust, The costly cuirass from his breast to tear, And by one noble stroke to terminate the war! Thus, fir'd with fury, to the fight he flies; Keen flash the flames, and lighten from his eyes. So the fierce bull, collected in his might, Roars for his rival, and demands the fight; Impatient for the war, with fury burns, And tries on every tree his angry horns; Bends his stern brows, and pushes at the air; And paws the flying sands, the prelude of the war. As fierce and eager for the dire alarms, The Trojan blazes in celestial arms; To meet his rival in the field prepares, Pleas'd with the fight to terminate the wars. He sets his sorrowing friends and son at ease; Expounds the fates' unchangeable decrees; 165. Expounds the fates.] The destinies had determined, that Æneas should be established in Italy, and that he should lay the first foundations of the Roman empire. Turnus was fated to fall a victim to this establishment. Catrou.And instant bids the messengers report The terms of combat to the Latian court. 167. Scarce had the morn.] With what magnificence does the poet represent the sun rising on this important decisive day! Sciendum, says Servius, nunquam diem sic potenter decripsisse Virgilium. One would think it surprising, that the spirit of alteration and correction, extravagant as it is, should so strangely infatuate some commentators, as to persuade them to read è latis for elatis; to destroy a fine image, for the sake of becoming the authors of a various reading, however insipid, and inconsistent with the spirit of true poetry.Scarce had the morn (all beauteous to behold!) Tipt the blue mountains with a gleam of gold; The sun's fierce steeds, high-bounding o'er the sea, From their wide nostrils snort the beams of day; When for the chiefs they drew a line around, And in just limits close the listed ground: Then verdant altars raise to all the pow'rs Of earth or heav'n, whom either host adores. In linen robes, with vervain crown'd, they bring The sacred fire, and water from the spring. Here, with bright lances, all th'Ausonian train Pour thro' the op'ning portals to the plain: The Trojans there, and Tuscans in array, And ranks embattled, bend their eager way. Amid the thousands with a grace divine, In gold and purple gay, the leaders shine. Here, tow'ring o'er the troops Asylas stood; Great Mnestheus there, of Troy's imperial blood: There, brave Messapus, of immortal strain, Sprung from the mighty monarch of the main. 187. The sign.] It was highly proper to introduce so solemn and important a thing as this league, on the keeping which sacredly, the whole action was to turn, with all the pomp and solemnity described from hence to verse 250.The sign now giv'n thro' each impatient host, Each chief retires to his appointed post. At ease the soldiers fall their pond'rous shields, And pitch their idle jav'lins in the fields. Old sires and matrons, with the vulgar throng, Lean'd o'er the walls, and from the turrets hung. With longing eyes the great event they wait, And crouds on crouds press forward thro' the gate. 195. Albano's shady brows.] The particularizing this mountain must have been highly pleasing to the Roman readers of this poem.But from the fam'd Albano's shady brows, (Tho' then without a name the mountain rose) The queen of heav'n the Latian town beheld, The hosts embattled, and the crouded field. 199. Then to brave Turnus' sister.] The sister of Turnus was called Juturna. Virgil here relates the accident which was the occasion of her being ranked among the gods. What gave Virgil an opportunity of forming this fiction was, that near the river Numicus sprung up a fountain, which was called Juturna a juvando, because its waters were of a salutary nature. To this nymph a temple was dedicated, and a feast instituted in honour of her, call'd Juturnalia. Catrou. See the story of this nymph in Ovid Fast. 2. 585. Aristotle observes in his poetics, that there are fewer good than bad women, and that they do more mischief than service in the world: Virgil hath but too exactly follow'd this opinion. Venus indeed, the mother and protectress of Æneas, appears in an amiable light throughout the poem. The Sibyl assists our hero. Cybele and Andromache have no ill qualities ascribed to them; but they appear but little. To outweigh this small number of good women, there are many others, represented as bad characters, and very unfavourable to the hero. Juno is his grand enemy; she employs Iris, Juturna, and Alecto, to oppose his designs. Dido endeavour'd to destroy him at Carthage; and calls to her assistance, her sister, her nurse, and a magician. The harpyes drive him from their island. Helen is a pest, that has ruined both Trojans and Greeks; the Trojan women, Æneas's own subjects, set fire to his fleet. Amata despises the commands of the gods, and the will of the king her husband; and, with the Latin women, is the first who kindles the war. Hostilities are commenced at the instigation of Sylvia. Even the women, who were dearest to our hero, involved him in great difficulties and sorrows. At the end of the second book we see his affliction for the lost Creusa. And Lavinia is the cause of all the evils he suffers in the last six books. Bossu, p. 307. The ladies, I hope, will despise these cruel and groundless reflections on their virtuous and amiable sex, since they were made only by a solitary priest, condemn'd to celibacy, and utterly unacquainted with their excellencies.Then to brave Turnus' sister, who presides O'er lakes and streams, and awes the roaring tides, (On the fair nymph, that province was bestow'd For her lost honour, by the thund'ring god) Her fears the goddess of the skies express'd; And thus the regent of the floods address'd: Queen of the founts and streams, and far above The race of Latian nymphs in Juno's love, Those nymphs, who, by my wand'ring lord misled, Presum'd to mount our own imperial bed; Yet thee I suffer'd in his grace to rise, And share th'immortal honours of the skies. With deep concern sad tidings must I bear, What I must grieve to speak, and you to hear. The Latian state and Turnus, in the war, While fortune favour'd, were my constant care. Now his inevitable hour draws nigh; 216. Doom'd to die.] It must be own'd, that this line injudiciously anticipates the important event of Turnus's death, concerning which the reader should have been kept in suspense.On terms unequal is he doom'd to die. But from the fatal field, th'appointed fight, 218. Lo! I retire.] Juno was prohibited to concern herself in this war. All she does is done indirectly, and by the agency and ministry of Juturna. Catrou.Lo! I retire; nor can I bear the sight. If thou canst save him yet from death, descend: Some better fate thy efforts may attend; Fly—and exert the sister and the friend. She said; Juturna wept, by grief opprest, 223. Her iv'ry breast.] Honestum is used for beautiful, Geo. II. 392.Thrice tore her hair, and beat her iv'ry breast. Fly, Juno cries, and stop the dire debate, Fly, fly, and snatch him, if you can, from fate. Nor waste the hours in tears, and vain despair; Break, break the truce, and wake the slumb'ring war. On me discharge the crime.—The goddess said; And left involv'd in doubts the mournful maid. Now came the kings: four stately coursers bear, In pomp, the Latian lord's imperial car. 232. Twelve golden.] The twelve spikes, in the corona radialis, were supposed in general to allude either to the twelve signs of the Zodiac, or the twelve labours of Hercules. Here they bear a particular allusion to the lineage of Latinus, who was descended from the sun.Twelve golden rays around his temples shone, To mark his glorious lineage from the sun. Young Turnus next appear'd; two spears he held, And two white coursers drew him to the field. Æneas then advanc'd, with grace divine, 237. The illustrious father of the Roman line.] Virgil is ever looking back on his principal action, that is, the foundation of a Trojan colony in Italy; from whence the Romans were originally derived. This action, I think, is the end of the poem, and the object to which all is referr'd. Critics are divided concerning the main design which the poet ought to have in view, when he undertakes an epic poem. Some pretend that it is the sole business of the poet to model an hero of his own, in whom every heroic virtue must be centred, for the instruction of those persons, who by their birth or rank are destined to heroic employments. If this was the case, Homer, the first inventor of the epic, might be esteem'd the destroyer of it; the examples of his heroes contribute much less to form the manners, than to corrupt them. This Horace was aware of, when, in his epistle to Lollius, he represents the vices of the chiefs who signaliz'd themselves in Seditione, dolis, scelere, atque libidine, &amp; ira, Iliacos intra muros peccatur, &amp; extra. Others imagine, that some particular moral truth is the object of an epic poem: as in the fables of Æsop, some one maxim and precept for the conduct of life is inculcated in each story. But it appears from Aristotle, that the action is what constitutes the essence of the epopaia, and is the chief object of the poet's design. The re-establishment of the peace of a family and kingdom, which had been disturbed by the importunate suitors of Penelope, is one action; the foundation of a Trojan colony in Italy, and, by means of that, the foundation afterwards of Rome itself, is another action. This is therefore the principal design of the Greek and Latin poet. 'Tis true, each of these actions convey some particular moral; and what action does not? One may moralize on every subject in the world. In a word, what Aristotle says is expresly this:—The poets do not feign an action for the sake of the manners; but the instruction of the manners follows the action. Catrou. A sensible writer observes, that, although we cannot fix upon one single moral lesson, as the sole intention of the Iliad, Odyssey, and Æneid; it ought not from hence to be concluded, their authors had no design at all, farther than to compose an amusing story. If we consider the immense variety of useful observations, which may be drawn from a diligent examination of every part of the conduct of the several persons in the Iliad only, it is not to be conceived, how the writer by mere accident, and without any express design, could possibly lay together so copious a fund for the most instructive moral reflections. The distinction which ought here to be made, is between allowing, in these poems, no other intention than to exemplify some general maxim relating to mens conduct, and the more extensive design of exhibiting some finish'd picture of life, wherein may be exposed to view, not only the natural consequences of human actions, but the tempers and the passions of men, with the internal motives both to good actions, and to those deviations from the general principles of virtue, which we daily see and lament in the world. Pemberton on epic poetry, p. 19.Th'illustrious father of the Roman line; High in his hand the starry buckler rais'd; And in immortal arms the hero blaz'd. With him his son Ascanius took his place, The second hope of Rome's majestic race. Slow the procession moves: the sacred priest Stood by his altar, in the linen vest; A tender lamb for sacrifice preferr'd, And a young victim from the bristly herd. They turn their faces to the dawning day; The salted cakes with solemn rev'rence pay; The victims sign'd; the foremost hairs they drew, And on the hearth the first libations threw. Then the great Trojan prince unsheath'd his sword, And thus with lifted hands the gods ador'd. 252. Thou land, for which I wage the war, and thou, Great source of day, be witness to my vow!] In this solemn manner the oath of Calypso is introduced, Odyss. B. V. ??????? ???? ????, ??? ??????? ????? ???????. But hear, o earth! and hear, ye sacred skies! Pope. Rapin allows this to be an instance of true sublimity; and I must confess, that there is something more awful in it, than in Virgil's copy. The like expression is found in Deuteronomy, “Hear, o heavens, the words that I speak, and let the earth hear the words of my mouth!”Thou land, for which I wage the war, and thou, Great source of day, be witness to my vow! Almighty king of heav'n, and queen of air (Propitious now, and reconcil'd by pray'r); Thou Mars, inthron'd on great Olympus' height, Lord of the field, and master of the fight; Ye springs, ye floods, ye various pow'rs who lie Beneath the deeps, or tread the golden sky; Hear, and attest! if, victor in the fray, The Daunian leader gains the glorious day, My son his claim of empire shall release; My Trojan subjects shall depart in peace. But should the conquest prove my happy lot, (For so I think, and heav'n confirm the thought!) The Latians never shall my rule obey; Already I disclaim th'imperial sway. From fight let each unconquer'd nation cease, And join in leagues of everlasting peace. To king Latinus I resign the care, The pomp of state, with all concerns of war, And ev'ry regal claim;—the rites divine, And the religious province, shall be mine. For me my Trojan friends a town shall frame, And grace the tow'rs with fair Lavinia's Name, Thus he. Then old Latinus lifts his eyes, And his right hand, with rev'rence, to the skies. By the same oath, by heav'n, and earth, and main, And all the pow'rs, that all the three contain; Latona's twins, that grace the bright abode; Janus, the mighty, double-fronted god! Th'infernal monarch, and the fiends below, And Jove, whose bolts avenge the broken vow! To sanctify my word, behold! I stand, And on these hallow'd altars lay my hand: Whate'er ensues, misfortune or success, No time shall break this solemn league of peace, Nor shake my purpose; but intire, and whole, I'll keep the sacred tenor of my soul; No art shall win me, and no pow'r compel; Not, tho' the golden skies should plunge to hell; Yon starry splendors from their spheres should fall, And ocean spread his waters o'er the ball. Firm is the sword, and sure the oath I swore; 295. Sure, as this sceptre.] I agree with Mr. Pope, that this passage does not come up to the spirit and propriety of that in Homer, from whence Virgil copied it. Scaliger, on a comparison of the diction only, gives the preference to Virgil, B. V. Poet. c. 4. But, says Mr. Pope, it fails in a greater point than any he has mentioned; which is, that being there us'd on occasion of a peace, it has no emblematical reference to division, and yet describes the cutting of the wood, and its incapacity to bloom and branch again, in as many words as Homer. It is borrowed by Valerius Flaccus; in his third book; where he makes Jason swear, as a warrior, by his spear: Hanc ego magnanimi spolium Didymaonis hastam, Ut semel est avulsa jugis, a matre peremta, Quæ neque jam frondes virides neque proferet umbras, Fida ministeria, &amp; duras obit horrida pugnas, Testor ? And indeed, however he may here borrow some expressions from Virgil, or fall below him in others, he has nevertheless kept to Homer in the emblem, by introducing the oath upon Jason's grief for sailing to Colchis with Hercules; when he had separated him from the body of the Argonauts, to search after Hylas. Ruæus observes, that Virgil should have spar'd so minute and particular a description of the sceptre. What he means by this is, I suppose, the Artificis manus ære decoro inclusit. But that circumstance adds to the impossibility of its ever sprouting again, and should be look'd upon as mentioned by Virgil on that account. Aristotle, Polit. 3. tells us, that it was customary for kings to swear by their sceptres. Hamlet, according to the antient custom of his country, swears by his sword. See Upton upon Shakespeare.Sure, as this sceptre ne'er shall flourish more; No more its verdant honours shall renew, Lopt from the mother-tree where once it grew; Now by the artist's hand adorn'd with brass, 299. And worn successive.] In the simplicity of the earlier ages of the world, the sceptres of kings were really no other than long walking-staves; and thence had the very name of sceptre, which now sounds so magnificently (???????? ??? ??? ??????????). The old sceptres being as long as an hunting-pole, may serve to explain some expressions in Virgil, relateing to king Latinus's sceptre; which would not be so proper, if applied to a truncheon, or a modern sceptre: Ut sceptrum hoc, &amp;c. ? It was a whole young tree, cut from the root, and stript of its branches. Polymetis, Dial. 6. p. 51.And worn successive by our regal race! The princes thus the solemn compact bound By mutual oaths, with all the peers around. The priests before the fires the victims slay; Eager the smoking entrails rend away; And, on the altars rang'd, the loaded chargers lay. But the Rutulians griev'd, by fears opprest, And various tumults work'd in ev'ry breast. Long since they saw their prince o'er-match'd in might, And curs'd the terms of such unequal fight. Their dread increases, as the chiefs draw near, And Turnus' looks augment the gen'ral fear. Trembling, aghast, he moves with silent pace: A deadly paleness spreads o'er all his face. Close by the altar's side, in care profound, His pensive eyes he fixt upon the ground. Soon as the sister saw the giddy croud Had chang'd their minds, and spoke their fears aloud; In great Camertes' form, of high renown For birth, his father's valour and his own, Her flight amidst the murmuring bands she took, Inflam'd their rage, and thus the host bespoke: What shame, Rutulians, valiant as we are, On one to lay the whole success of war! Behold the utmost force the foe can boast, The few poor relics of their shatter'd host. Heav'ns!—can we shrink from such a slender pow'r! Are not our men the same? our numbers more? Should our whole army to the fight repair, Scarce all their troops would half employ our war! 'Tis true, your hero to the gods shall rise, A self-devoted victim to the skies. Yet the brave chief eternal praise shall claim, And live for ever in a length of fame: While we, O shame! a base degen'rate host, Look tamely on, and see our country lost! Stretch our vile hands to servitude abhorr'd, And court the bondage of a foreign lord! This fiery speech inflam'd the list'ning train; Thro' all the host the gath'ring murmur ran. Now chang'd, the Latians wish for peace no more, But long to break the league they sought before. They pity Turnus' fortune, and prepare With eager ardour to renew the war. His sister sent (the tumult to improve) A false delusive omen from above. 345. In pomp a tow'ring eagle.] This augury was necessary, to make so sudden, and, at the same time so irreligious a change, the more probable, and suitable to truth. Virgil never fails of a due decorum. The words mentes Itelas should be particularly observed; the Italians were more credulous with regard to augurie, than other nations. The manner of divining events by the flight of birds took its rise, it is said, from Etruria. Catrou.In pomp a tow'ring eagle soars on high, And sudden, shooting from th'ethereal sky, Drives a vast flock of watry fowls before, On sounding wings, along the winding shore; Then, where the floods in soft meanders ran, In his huge talons truss'd a silver swan. Th'astonish'd Latian bands in courage rise, When lo! the flock (more wond'rous to their eyes) Turn, and pursue the victor thro' the skies. Prest by the foe, incumber'd with the prey, He drops the prize, and wings th'aëreal way; With shouts the Latians hail th'auspicious sight, Range all their troops, and hasten to the fight. 'Tis what I wish'd, the long-expected sign, 359. Tolumnius cry'd.] To shew the force of this omen, Virgil represents the augur himself as deceived by it, and as the first man who begins an act of hostility. The conduct of Virgil is admirable in feigning him to kill one out of the nine Arcadian brethren, who were rang'd together; as they must consequently revenge his death, in doing which a commotion is naturally raised, sufficient to involve both armies in a general engagement. The eight men are instantly interested in the death of one man. If any common one of no connexions, vilis aliquis (as Servius terms it), had been killed, his death might have been consider'd as a circumstance too trifling to be the occasion of breaking so solemn a league.(Tolumnius cry'd) I thank the pow'rs divine. Rise, follow me, my friends, your aid supply, Forc'd by the foe, like yonder birds to fly; While thro' your wasted shores the victor sweeps; Who now shall soon rush headlong to the deeps. Haste; save your leader from the fatal fray; Close, close your ranks; engage; and win the day. He said; sprung forth; and 'midst the Trojans threw His furious dart, that whistled as it flew. Tumultuous shouts pursue the parting spear, And all now grow more eager for the war. Nine brave Arcadians at their squadrons head, Gilippus' offspring by a Tuscan bed, Shone in the front; the spear impetuous flew Amidst the brothers, and the youngest slew; A lovely blooming youth; with fury cast, Beneath the belt the steely jav'lin past, Transfix'd the stripling with a deadly wound, And stretch'd him pale, and gasping, on the ground. All fir'd with vengeance for their brother slain, Fierce to the combat fly the martial train. Some draw the glitt'ring sword, and some advance With the broad spear, and shake the flaming lance. With equal speed, their ardor to oppose, Pour forth in endless tides the Latian foes. As swift th'Arcadian troops, with sculptur'd shields, Rush'd on with Troy, and delug'd all the fields. Strait to their ensigns the bold bands repair, Impatient to decide the great event by war. The madding croud the sacred rites confound; Strip the bright altars; toss the fires around; And seize the goblets; while the jav'lins fly In iron storms, and tempest all the sky. The good old king, affrighted, from the plain Bears back his violated gods again. Some yoke the coursers to the car with speed, Some vault, impetuous, on the snorting steed. Some to the field the kindling troops excite, Draw their bright swords, and headlong rush to fight. Eager to break the peace, with all his force, The fierce Messapus spurr'd his thund'ring horse Full on Aulestes, with a furious spring, Who wore the royal ensigns of a king: O'er the high altars as the chief gave way, Headlong he plung'd in dust, and grov'ling lay. There at his length, extended on the plain, He pleads for mercy; but he pleads in vain! Th'impetuous victor flew with rapid speed, Shook his huge spear, and, bending from the steed, Transfixt the monarch; then, insulting, cries; He bleeds!—this victim sure must please the skies! The joyful Latians, eager for the prey, Strip the warm corse, and bear the spoils away. Then, as the mighty Ebusus drew near, 413. And at bold Chorinæus.] Mr. Pope, in his observations on Homer's catalogue of ships, justly censures Virgil for not having in some places sufficiently distinguished his heroes who have the same name. Thus in B. IX. ver. 571. orig. a Chorinæus is killed by Asylas; and here a Chorinæus kills Ebusus: a Numa is found among the slain, after the expedition of Nisus and Euryalus; and another Numa is pursued by Æneas, B. X. v. 562. Homer (says Mr. Pope) is constantly careful to distinguish two of a name, so that one shall not be mistaken for the other, as Ajax Oileus, and Ajax Telamonius.And at bold Chorinæus shook the spear, He rush'd against him with a furious pace, Snatch'd a red brand, and dash'd it on his face. Thro' ambient air a noisome scent expires, As the long beard shrunk crackling in the fires. Stunn'd as he stood with sudden darkness round, The raging victor drags him to the ground; Then seiz'd his locks; his forceful knee apply'd, And plung'd the vengeful faulchion in his side. From Podalirius, eager to pursue, Thro' the first ranks, the shepherd Alsus flew; Then turn'd, and, with his ax descending full, Cleaves at one dreadful stroke his shatter'd skull. With blood and brains his arms are cover'd o'er; The thirsty sands are drench'd with streams of gore. An iron sleep came swimming o'er his sight, And wrapt the warrior in eternal night. 430. But the just.] The character of Æneas is well supported by this circumstance, of making him exclaim with grief, and eager concern, at the breaking the league.But the just Trojan prince, amidst the band, Without his helmet rush'd, and stretch'd his hand: Whither, my friends, ah! whither wou'd you run? The terms stand fixt; the combat is my own. Dismiss your fears; nor my revenge pursue; For Turnus, Turnus is your gen'ral's due. That victim, these religious rites demand, Already sacred to this conqu'ring hand. While yet he spoke; loud-hissing thro' the skies, With thirsty rage, a feather'd arrow flies; And reach'd the hero with a certain aim; But from what hand, was never told by fame. None knew, what fortune, or assisting god, So proud a triumph on the foe bestow'd, Nor one in all the mighty host was found, Who claim'd the merit of so base a wound. 446. The chiefs astonish'd, Turnus now beheld.] The absence of Æneas revives the courage of Turnus. He is once more a conqueror, as he was before when Æneas was in Etruria. This is what may be called an indirect praise of the hero, which Virgil learn'd from Homer. The absence of Achilles gives the victory to the Trojans in the Iliad; as the Latins, in the Æneid, are always masters of the field, when Æneas is absent. Catrou.The chiefs astonish'd, Turnus now beheld, And the brave prince retiring from the field: High hopes of conquest in his bosom rise; Strait for his coursers, and his arms, he cries; Vaults, with a furious bound, into the car, Shakes the loose reins, and rushes to the war. Raging he spreads the growing slaughter round: Some foes expire; some welter on the ground: Some fly—vain! for, swifter than the wind, His winged lance arrests 'em from behind. Fierce o'er the prostrate foes the hero rolls His whirling wheels, and crushes out their souls. 458. As when on Hebrus' banks.] I cannot help giving the reader an opportunity of comparing Dryden's translation of Thus on the banks of Hebrus freezing flood The god of battles, in his angry mood, Clashing his sword against his brazen shield, Lets loose the reins, and scours along the field: Before the wind his fiery coursers fly; Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky: Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair, Dire faces and deform'd, surround the car, Friends of the god, and followers of the war. These lines partake of the fire of the original: but the ? Gemit ultima pulsu Thraca pedum, is a circumstance unluckily omitted. And here it will not be improper to observe, that Mr. Dryden has given a much more labour'd and correct translation of this book, than of any of the former. In his postscript to the reader he tells us, “If the last Æneid shine among its fellows, 'tis owing to the commands of Sir W. Trumbull, one of the principal secretaries of state, who recommended it as his favourite to my care; and for his sake particularly I have made it mine.” And afterwards, “Being invited by that worthy gentleman Sir W. Bowyer, at Denham Court, I translated the first Georgic at his house, and the greatest part of the last Æneid. A more friendly entertainment no man ever found: no wonder therefore if both those versions surpass the rest, &amp;c.” From hence we may reasonably conclude, that want of leisure and the conveniences of life occasioned many of the negligencies and inaccuracies to be found in his translation: but at the same time, it must be own'd, that an unwearied spirit, and a fire truly poetical, runs thro' the whole. It will perhaps be superfluous to add, that Shakespear seems to have had this image of Mars in his eye, in the prologue to Henry V. ver. 5. Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels, Leasht in like hounds, should Famine, Sword, and Fire, Crouch for employments. ? The circumstance of Famine, Sword, and Fire, submissively waiting the orders of their master, when they should be let loose to action, is new and sublime. On occasion of this fine simile, I would observe from Mr. Pope, that this is one of those comparisons that draw along with them some foreign circumstances. We must not often expect from Homer and Virgil, those minute resemblances in every branch of a comparison, which are the pride of modern similes. If that which one may call the main action of it, or the principal point of likeness, be preserved; they affect, as to the rest, rather to present the mind with a great image, than to fix it down to an exact one. They are sure to make a fine picture in the whole, without drudging on the under parts; like those free painters who (one would think) had only made here and there a few very significant strokes, that give form and spirit to all the piece.As when on Hebrus' banks the god of war Flies to the combat on his rattling car; Frowns, shouts, and, clashing on his dreadful shield, Lashes his fiery coursers to the field; The steeds devour the ground, out-strip the wind, And leave the pinions of the storm behind: Thrace feels thro' all her realms their furious course, Shook by the prancings of the thund'ring horse; Fear, Fraud, and Force, and Flight, a ghastly train Of horrid fiends, attend him to the plain. So drove stern Turnus with resistless might, His smoking coursers o'er the field of fight; Their rapid hoofs thro' heaps of carnage tore; Plung'd deep into the sands, distain'd with gore; O'er piles of dead and dying warriors bound, And, as they fly, they dash the bloody dust around. Now hapless Thamyris and Pholus fell, And now he sent bold Sthenelus to hell. These, hand to hand, he slew, approaching near; The last, at distance, with his pointed spear: At distance both th'Imbrasidæ expire, Train'd in fair Lycia, by their valiant sire: In closer fight, the dauntless warriors join'd; Or distanc'd with their steeds the winged wind. There with high vaunts rush'd proud Eumedes on, Foredoom'd to fate, ambitious Dolon's son. Base as his father, with his grandsire's name, The recreant soldier sought the field of fame, But with the luckless fortune of his sire, Who claim'd Pelides' coursers for his hire, When sent the Grecian army to explore; Vain fool! he ventur'd, but return'd no more; Slain by Tydides' hand, resign'd his breath, And shar'd a juster recompence in death! Him when the Daunian hero spy'd from far, First a light dart he launch'd in open air, Stops the fleet steeds, and, furious, quits the car; Stood o'er the Trojan, prostrate as he lay, Trod on his neck, and wrench'd the sword away. Then thro' his throat the deadly faulchion thrust, And thus insults him grov'ling in the dust: Lie there! possess the land thy valour gains! And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains! Such, such deserv'd rewards I still bestow, When call'd to battle, on the vaunting foe; Thus may you build your town, and thus enjoy These realms, ye proud presumptuous sons of Troy! Next, by his flying spear Asbutes bled: A second lance laid mighty Chloreus dead. In Dares' breast he plung'd the pointed steel, And sent the bold Thersilochus to hell: Then pierc'd Thymœtes with a fatal wound, Whose flound'ring steed had cast him to the ground. As o'er th'Ægean deeps when Boreas roars, And rolls the waves tumultuous to the shores, The driving clouds before the whirlwind fly, And break, and scatter, thro' the ruffled sky: So where bold Turnus rush'd, inflam'd with ire, Their orders scatter, and whole hosts retire. Whirl'd on his rapid car, the hero gains New rage, new vigour, as he sweeps the plains. High o'er his helm his crimson crest, inclin'd By ev'ry breath, nods dreadful in the wind. No more, in proud disdain, cou'd Phegeus bear To see the hero rule the tide of war; But, rashly furious, to the car proceeds, Seiz'd the loose reins, and turn'd the flying steeds. Him, as suspended on the yoke he hung, By the swift chariot dragg'd in dust along, Thro' the bor'd corslet, the sharp jav'lin found, And ras'd the warrior with a slender wound. Yet with his shield oppos'd he dares the blow, And with his brandish'd sword assaults the foe. The whirling wheels, with fiery speed impell'd, Soon shoot him headlong on the sanguine field. Swift Turnus follow'd; and his faulchion drew; Between the cuirass and the head it flew: The gushing blood distains the sands around, And the pale trunk lay grov'ling on the ground. Thus while the conqu'ring chief his progress held, Rag'd, storm'd, and reign'd the master of the field; Achates, Mnestheus, and the royal heir, 540. Attend the Trojan prince.] The reader is alarmed at our hero's being wounded at so critical a time. His impatience to be healed, and to rush again to the battle, and the turn his presence gives to the army, deserve to be particularly admired.Attend the Trojan prince with duteous care 541. As propt, and leaning on the spear, he went.] This is a true interpretation of nitentem. The epithet longa undoubtedly improves the image, which Dr. Trapp was not aware of, who translates longa hasta ashen spear. This line seems to have been an hint to Milton, in his description of Satan walking over the burning soil of hell: His spear, to equal which, the tallest pine; Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast Of some proud ammiral, were but a wand, He walk'd with, to support uneasy steps Over the burning marle. ? Par. L. B. I.(As propt, and leaning on the spear, he went); And plac'd the bleeding hero in the tent. The steel, deep-riveted, with eager hands He tugs impatient, and their aid demands, More wide to lay the wound, a passage bare, Unroot the dart, and send him to the war. Now came Iapis to relieve his pain, Of old by Phœbus lov'd, nor lov'd in vain. On whom the god had proffer'd to bestow 550. His lyre, his bays, his prescience, and his bow.] Augurium, citharamque, dabat, celeresque sagittas. Mentioned by Callimachus, in Hymn. Apollin. ????? ??? ??? ????? ???????????, ??? ?????, ?????? ?? ????? ??? ??????? ? To Apollo belongs the bow, and the art of music; and his are the stones made use of by soothsayers.His lyre, his bays, his prescience, and his bow. But (to prolong his drooping father's days) The youth refus'd his arrows, lyre, and bays, And prescient skill; but chose the healing part, A silent, useful, tho' inglorious art. Unmov'd with all the sorrow and the care Of friends, attendants, and the royal heir, His mighty spear, th'impatient chief sustains, Who grinds his teeth for rage, nor heeds the glowing pains. The sage now hastens to the task assign'd, And first dispatchful tucks his robes behind; Tries all the vegetable pow'rs around, To cool the smart, and mitigate the wound. His hands solicit now with tender art; Now tug in vain with vigour at the dart. At length he pray'd; nor Phœbus heard the pray'r; And nearer every moment pour'd the war. Thick and more thick the growing horrors rise; A cloud of dust involves the golden skies. 569. Foes drew nigh.] This circumstance heightens our wounded hero's impatience; as the uneasiness he expresses, shews his warmth and eagerness to return to battle.The trampling steeds, the thund'ring foes, drew nigh, And 'midst the camp the show'ring jav'lins fly. The mingling cries from ev'ry part resound; Some shout, some groan, some gasp upon the ground. Now, touch'd with pity for the hero's pain, Descends the goddess mother on the plain. 575. A branch of sov'reign dittany.] The text is here much controverted. The common editions read dictamnum genetrix, &amp;c. Catrou reads, for dictamnum, Ipsa manu genetrix, in which he follows Donatus. His reasons for such a reading are; 1. Because the word dictamnum is useless here; for why should the poet mention the proper name of a plant, which he makes a particular description of, sufficient to distinguish it from any other? 2. We should read (if we would mention the proper name at all) dictamni caulem. 3. Ipsa manu gives us a stronger idea of maternal care; she cropt this salutary plant with her own hand.—All these reasons (says Catrou), strengthened by the authority of Donatus, who affirms, that some manuscripts read so in his time, have induced me to choose this reading. It must be added, that there is an objection made to the word dictamnum, drawn from the description here given of it. Pliny reports, Flos nullus [dictamno] est, aut semen, aut caulis: Theophrastus gives it flowers; Dioscorides, c. 32. l. 3. tells us, that it is a Cretan plant of an harsh taste: that it is soft, and like the pulegium, penyroyal; but with larger leaves, and those wooly or downy; that it has neither flower nor seed; that the juice of it heals wounds made with iron. But Catrou mentions some other botanical writers, who describe it according to our poet. For the rest, see Atterbury's Dissertation at the beginning of this book.A branch of sov'reign dittany she bore, From Ida gather'd, on the Cretan shore. Luxuriant leaves the taper stalk array; The stalk in flow'rs; the flow'rs in purple gay. The goats, when pierc'd at distance by the dart, Apply the med'cine to the wounded part. This juice, while clouds conceal her radiant face, The queen infuses in the golden vase; Tempers with scented panacee the whole, And with ambrosial liquors crowns the bowl. Nor knew the sage the succour that he found, But with the balmy mixture bathes the wound. At once the throbbing anguish past away; Stanch'd was the blood, and in the bottom lay. The dart, tho' deeply rooted, at command Moves up, and answers the physician's hand. His former vigour now succeeds to pain, And life burns bright in all her pow'rs again. Iapis first perceiv'd th'immortal art, That cool'd the raging pangs, and clos'd the part. Raptur'd he saw the cure; and first impell'd The prince, renew'd in courage, to the field. Arms for the chief, he cries; prepare his arms; And instant send him to the dire alarms. This cure, great hero, is no work of mine, Nor mortal art; but done by hands divine. Thy life some guardian god has made his care, Who sends thee back to fight, and conquer in the war. 603. Had cover'd o'er.] He had already done it, incluserat: he had not lost a moment's time.The fierce, impatient prince, had cover'd o'er His manly legs with golden greaves before. Now, all on fire, his mighty lance he took, And in his hand the pond'rous weapon shook. High on his arm the heav'nly shield he rais'd; And, on his breast, the radiant cuirass blaz'd. Then, with a close embrace he strain'd his son; And kiss'd him thro' his helm, and thus begun. 611. From me true courage, and in camps to dare, From others, learn, my son, success in war.] Virgil seems to have borrowed this sentiment from the Ajax of Sophocles, ver. 553. ? ???, ?????? ?????? ????????????, ?? ?? ???? ??????, ??? ??????? ?? ?????. There is something highly pleasing in this scene of Sophocles, to behold the stern and rugged Ajax melted into tenderness at the sight of his child, whom he begs to see when he is just recover'd from his madness: the whole is extremely pathetic, and puts one in mind of that fine stroke of nature in Lucretius, B. V. ? Puerique parentum Blanditiis facile ingenium fregere superbum. Fulvius Ursinus observes, that Attius, in his Judgment of the Armour (a play copied from Æschylus), makes use of the same sentiment: Virtuti sis par, dispar fortunis patris.From me true courage, and in camps to dare, From others learn, my son, success in war. I go to labour in the bloody fray, To fight, and guard thee, in the dreadful day; To crown thee with a bright immortal name; To teach thy youth the glorious paths to fame. Thou, in thy riper years, the virtues trace, And copy all the worthies of thy race. Thy soul may Hector and Æneas fire, Thy godlike uncle, and thy martial sire! So spoke the hero, and, by rage impell'd, Tow'r'd from the tent, majestic, to the field; Shook an huge jav'lin in his vig'rous hand; And with their chief pour'd forth the martial band. Antheus and Mnestheus led th'embattled train, And all rush'd furious to the deathful plain. Beneath the warriors groans the trembling ground, And clouds of dust involve the region round. Now Turnus and his host the foe beheld From a high mound, advancing o'er the field. Th'astonish'd troops a gen'ral fear confounds; But first his sister heard the dreadful sounds. Too well she knew the dire alarms from far, And trembling fled before the moving war. Fierce, with their leaders, march the Trojan train; And the black squadrons darken all the plain. 637. As when some tempest.] From Homer Iliad. B. iv. 275. ?? ?? ??? ??? ??????? ????? ????? ??????? ????, ????????? ???? ?????? ??? ???????? ????, ?? ?? ?? ??????? []? ?? ?????????? ???? ??? ??????? ??? ???? ??????, ???? ?? ?? ??????? ??????, ??????? ?? ????, ??? ?? ????? ????? ????. Thus from the lofty promontory's brow A swain surveys the gath'ring storm below; Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise, Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies, Till black as night the swelling tempest shews, The cloud condensing as the west wind blows. He dreads th'impending storm, and drives his flock To the close covert of an arching rock. Pope, V. 314. The image of the shepherd on the mountain, seeing the storm rising from the sea, is beautiful, as is the close of this comparison. But in the Greek poet, the soldiers, thickening their files, are compar'd to a storm; in the Roman, the general Æneas is compared to a destructive tempest. There seems to be a kind of prosopopœia in those words: ? Dabit ille ruinas Arboribus, stragemque satis; ruet omnia late. As if the husbandmen, on seeing the storm approach, cried out, “this will destroy our trees, our corn, &amp;c.”As when some tempest o'er mid ocean roars, And, wing'd with whirlwinds, gathers to the shores; With boding hearts the peasants hear from far The sullen murmurs of the distant war; Foresee the harvests levell'd with the ground, And all the forests spread in ruins round; Swift to the land the hollow grumbling wind Flies, and proclaims the furious storm behind. So swift, so furious, great Æneas flew, And led against the foes the martial crew. The thick'ning squadrons, wedg'd in close array, In one black body win their desp'rate way. By Mnestheus slain, in dust Archesius lies, And by Thymbræus' sword Osiris dies. Next Gyas' lance the mighty Ufens sped, And Epulo by brave Achates bled. Ev'n curs'd Tolumnius fell, whose fatal spear, Launch'd at the Dardan host, renew'd the war. A peal of shouts, tumultuous, tore the sky, And o'er the field the pale Rutulians fly. But with disdain the Trojan hero glows; Nor wastes his vengeance on inferior foes. He scorns to fight the few, who stand their ground, Or in their backs the flying crouds to wound: Turnus, and him alone, he calls aloud To fight, and hunts him thro' the dusty cloud. On this, his anxious sister, seiz'd with fear, 664. Hurl'd from his lofty seat the charioteer.] This fiction is imitated from Homer, where Minerva takes the She said, and, to the steed approaching near, Drew from his seat the martial charioteer. The vig'rous pow'r the trembling car ascends, Fierce for revenge; and Diomed attends. The groaning axle bent beneath the load, So great an hero, and so great a Minerva. god. She snatch'd the reins, she lash'd with all her force, And full on Mars impell'd the foaming horse. But first, to hide her heav'nly visage, spread Black Orcus helmet o'er her radiant head. Pope's Hom. Il. B. V. 1028. This description, it must be confessed, as much exceeds Virgil's, as Minerva is a more potent divinity than Juturna.Hurl'd from his lofty seat the charioteer, Metiscus the renown'd; tost far away, The wond'ring chief beneath the harness lay. Herself assumes his armour, voice, and air; Snatches the reins, and vaults into the car. 669. As the black swallow.] This rural simile has a good effect in relieving the mind of the reader from the bloody and busy scenes he has just been engaged in.As the black swallow, that, in quest of prey, Round the proud palace wings her wanton way, When for her children she provides the feast, To still the clamours of the craving nest; Now wild excursions round the cloyster takes; Now, sportive winds, or skims along the lakes: So flies the goddess on the rapid car, From side to side, and traverses the war: Now here, now there, she brings the chief to sight; But still she turns him from the fatal fight. Nor less the prince unravels all her ways, And hunts his foes thro' ev'ry various maze; Thrids all the shifting course, and breaks the croud With furious speed, and calls the chief aloud. Oft has he spy'd him, and approach'd the car; As oft his sister plung'd amid the war. Where-e'er the Trojan hero bends his course; Averse, the goddess turns the flying horse. What should he do? a thousand thoughts divide His wav'ring soul, that points to ev'ry side! When, lo! Messapus cross'd him in the field, And in his hand two shining jav'lins held. One, at the prince, with levell'd aim, he threw: Beneath his shield the cautious prince withdrew; Low bending on his knee, secure he lay; But the swift jav'lin strikes his plume away. Then, when the meditated fraud he view'd, That still his rival fled, as he pursu'd; He first invok'd the thund'rer to redress The rites profan'd, and violated peace; 699.—No check, nor bound His Fury knew]— ? Irarumque omnes effundit habenas. Ennius, from whom Virgil borrowed this metaphor, is still bolder: Irarumque effunde quadrigas. An expression quite in the Asiatic spirit, and so sublime, that it borders upon extravagance. Virgil has judiciously softened this metaphor, and by using the word habenas, has brought it nearer to common sense, and consequently render'd it more pleasing to the generality of readers, who are apt verbum aliquod ardens notare. Mr. Dryden call'd such, his prose-critics.Then rush'd amid the train; no check nor bound His fury knew, but stretch'd the slaughter round. The faithless foes he thinks it vain to spare, And, fir'd with vengeance, gives a loose to war. 703. What god.] This address of the poet begging some deity to assist him in describing the ensuing battle, adds great dignity and importance to the narration, and awakens the reader's curiosity and attention. The expostulation with Jupiter likewise, ver. 708. exceedingly heightens the subject.What god will now inspire me, to display The rage of death, and horrors of the day? What crouds of heroes perish'd on the plain, By mighty Turnus, and Æneas, slain! Was it thy will the nations should engage (Great sire of heav'n) with such unbounded rage? So soon from war and violence to cease, Leagu'd in a bond of everlasting peace? Æneas first slew Sucro in the fight, Whose sword had turn'd the Trojan troops to flight. With a swift stroke, and all his force apply'd, He plung'd the deadly faulchion in his side. Then, with his brother, Amycus was kill'd, Cast from their steed by Turnus on the field. With the long lance, this tow'ring chief he gor'd; Thro' that, impetuous, drove the pointed sword: Then, on his chariot hung, in triumph bore Their heads aloft, that dropp'd with livid gore: Next, at one charge, on three bold chiefs he flew; Talos, and Tanais, and Cethegus, slew. With them, of Theban race, Onytes fell, Fair Peridia's son; and sunk to hell. Then bled two brothers, who from Lycia come; Nor their own Phœbus could prevent their doom. Next poor Menœtes by his arm was slain, Who shunn'd so long the dreadful war in vain; 729. A skilful angler.] The addition of this circumstance is quite in the spirit of Homer; who generally diversifies and softens the descriptions of his battles, by distinguishing (as Mr. Pope observes) the profession, business, age, office, nation, family, &amp;c. of every warrior that is slain. One is a blooming youth, whose father dissuaded him from the war; one is a priest, whose piety could not save him; one is a sportsman, whom Diana taught in vain; one is a native of a far distant country, who is never to return; one is descended from a noble line, which is to end in his death; one is made remarkable by his boasting, another by his beseeching; and another, who is distinguish'd by nothing else, is mark'd by his habit, and the singularity of his armour. One has left an aged father, another a palace unfinish'd, or a wife he was fond of, or children that will be made captives.A skilful angler; once he made abode, Bless'd with content, by Lerna's plenteous flood. There dress'd his father, to the great unknown, A stranger field, and furrows not his own. 733. As the fierce flames.] The accumulation of comparisons carries in it a fine poetical enthusiasm. The principal image (says Mr. Pope, Il. B. XIV.) is more strongly impress'd on the mind, by a multiplication of similes, which are the natural product of an imagination labouring to express something very vast; but finding no single idea sufficient to answer its conceptions, it endeavours by redoubling the comparisons to supply this defect. We have several instances of this sort even in so castigated and reserved a writer as Virgil. There is a noble chain of such similes in Tasso, Canto IX. Stanza 22. Rapido si che torbida procella De cavernosi monti esce piu tarda; Fiume, ch' alberi infieme e case suella; Folgore, che te torri abbatta, &amp; arda: Terremoto, che'l mondo empia d'horrore, Son picciole sembianza al sub furore.As the fierce flames thro' the tall forest fly, This way and that, and kindle all the sky; Or rapid torrents from the mountains sweep, Roar down the sides, and thunder to the deep; With weight resistless, and destructive sway, O'er half a ruin'd country break their way: So thro' the field, in diff'rent parts engag'd, As swift and fierce the rival heroes rag'd. They burst with wrath; they rise to ev'ry blow; They send their souls with ev'ry lance they throw. A rock's vast weight the great Æneas threw: Th'enormous fragment like a whirlwind flew, And hurl'd Murranus on the ground, who brings His vaunted lineage from the Latian kings. Headlong the warrior from the chariot flies Amidst the harness, and incumber'd lies: The coursers startle at the flaming sword; Paw down, and trample on their dying lord. On Hyllus, Turnus rush'd with all his might, As, fir'd with rage, the chief advanc'd to fight. Full at his golden helmet, o'er the plain The jav'lin flew, and stung him to the brain: Nor thee, the bravest of the Grecian band. 756. Thy valour, Creteus.] A Creteus is likewise kill'd, B.IX. v. 1050. This seems to be a little oversight in the poet.Thy valour, Creteus, sav'd from Turnus' hand! Next fell the priest Cupencus in the strife, Nor his own gods could guard his sacred life: Full in his breast Æneas plung'd the dart, That pierc'd the shield, and quiver'd in his heart. Then bled great Æolus, by Turnus kill'd, And sunk, a bulk enormous, on the field! Whom not the Grecian heroes could destroy, Nor all their armies, in the wars of Troy, Nor great Achilles with his vengeful steel, Tho' by his arm the Phrygian empire fell. Here ends his life; his stately palace stood Beneath fair Ida's consecrated wood: There liv'd the mighty man; his cold remains At length lie bury'd in the Latian plains. Now in all parts the martial squadrons wage A gen'ral war, with undistinguish'd rage. The Latian, Trojan, and Rutulian force, The Tuscan cohorts, and Arcadian horse, Beneath their chiefs, embattled, spread the plain; Here Mnestheus, there Serestus, fires the train; Here great Asylas swept the field; and there Storm'd brave Messapus, the renown'd in war. Each fights, as in his arm the mighty day, With all the fate of his great gen'ral, lay; No stop, no check the fiery warriors knew; With their long toils their kindling ardor grew, And with fresh vigour to the combat flew. But Venus now inspires her godlike son To leave the field, and storm th'imperial town. As following Turnus thro' the ranks he flies, From side to side he darts his eager eyes; When, lo! before him, in a full survey, Exempt from war, the fenceless city lay. He views the promis'd prize with stern delight; His soul takes fire, and kindles at the sight. 792. Sudden the hero calls his chiefs around, With all his bands, and mounts a rising ground.] It was a custom of leaders, to harangue their troops from some eminence. This appears from their figures on medals, where we find the inscription, Adlocvtio; the soldiers being represented in arms.Sudden the hero calls his chiefs around, With all his bands, and mounts a rising ground. Then, as they rais'd their ample shields, and shook Their pointed lances, their bold leader spoke. Attend, and instant these commands obey; Inspir'd by favouring Jove, who points the way: All speed this noble enterprize demands, Claims all your care, and urges all your hands. This day, this hour, unless the Latians yield, And own your chief the victor of the field, Ev'n from the lowest stone my rage shall tear Yon town, the source of this destructive war. Yon perjur'd court my vengeance shall confound, And those proud tow'rs lie smoking on the ground. Twice have we vanquish'd the Rutulian train; Still must I wait till Turnus will be slain? No!—at yon walls the sure destruction aim; Revenge the broken league with sword and flame; Your arms against the guilty city bend: There the dire war began, and there shall end. 812. All wedg'd.] One of the figures in which the Romans drew up their battle, was called cuneus, when an army was rang'd in the form of a wedge; the most proper to pierce and break the order of an enemy. This too was sometimes called, caput porcinum, which in some measure it resembled.Rous'd at the word, all wedg'd in firm array, Strait to the town the squadrons urge their way. They toss the brands, the scaling engines rear, And round the ramparts rose the sudden war. Some to the portals fly with speed, and slay The guards or citizens, who cross their way. Some hurl the vengeful darts; the jav'lins fly In dusky clouds, and intercept the sky. Æneas rais'd his hand, amid the croud, Calls, and upbraids the Latian prince aloud, 822. Compell'd.] This circumstance artfully justifies the hero's undertaking.Obtesting heaven, that, wounded, and compell'd By his perfidious foes, he took the field; That twice the rites of peace their arms profane, And from their impious rage a second war began. But mad confusions in the city rise: 'Tis tumult all; for all at once advise. These arm, and fly to guard the walls; and those, More loud, demand admission for the foes. Some, to renew the peace, with clamours bring Ev'n to the gates the helpless hoary king. 832. So when.] This simile is taken from Apollonius Rhodius [Argonautic. L. I. v. 130.]; a poet, says Catrou, very rich in beautiful comparisons. ?? ?? ??????? ?????? ???? ???????????, ?? ????????? ????? ??? ???????????, ?? ?? ??? ????? ??? ??????? ? ??? ?????? ???????? ??????????, ??? ??? ?? ?????????? ????? ????????? ?????? ???? ???????. Which I have here attempted to translate: As when the swains, of honey studious, strive To chase the swarms from some deep cavern'd hive, Sudden, impatient of the rising fumes, Thick and more thick, they press within the waxen rooms; Then from their smoky cells tumultuous pour, And to the skies, releas'd, in airy circles tow'r. Virgil, according to custom, has heighten'd every circumstance. Trepidæ rerum, says Dr. Trapp, is a delicate poetical elegancy. for Solicitæ de rebus suis. Our poet never speaks of his favourite bees without a seeming pleasure, and in a labour'd stile.So when the swain invades, with stifling smoke, The bees close-cluster'd in a cavern'd rock, They rise; and, trembling for th'endanger'd state, Inflam'd with wrath, with fell revenge and hate, This way, and that, in loud tumultuous swarms, Fly o'er their waxen town with hoarse alarms. The steams offensive roll the cells around; Their sullen murmurs thro' the rock resound; While, thick'ning, thro' the cleft the smokes arise, And in a length of vapours mount the skies. But to complete and aggravate their fears, A new mischance involv'd the town in tears. For, when the wretched queen beheld on high O'er the proud domes the fiery tempest fly; The ramparts storm'd; th'exulting Trojans near; Nor Turnus' troops before the town appear; Many a long look she cast, but cast in vain! And in her fears concludes the hero slain; She raves against the gods in wild despair; She calls herself the auth'ress of the war: A thousand plaints she vented o'er and o'er, And in her rage her purple garments tore. 854. Then on a lofty beam.] Some nicer critics are highly offended, that Virgil should send Amata out of the world in so vulgar a manner. But this objection is owing to a want of considering the notions and manners of different ages and countries. In Apollonius Rhod. Argonaut. B. I. Clyte, wife to Cyzicus king of the Dolonians, hangs herself, v. 1063, &amp;c. as does Jocasta in the eleventh book of the Odyssey. In the Oedipus of Sophocles likewise Jocasta dies in the same manner: ?? ?? ????????? ??? ??????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????. ver. 1286.Then, on a lofty beam, the matron ty'd The noose dishonest, and obscenely dy'd. 856. Soon thro'.] The circumstances of the distress consequent upon Amata's death, are finely chosen, especially Lavinia's grief. The picture of the old pious monarch weeping, tearing his robes, and spreading dust over his hoary head, is very affecting; and with how much consistency of character does he attribute this disaster, to his own neglect of the oracle, and refusing Æneas for his son!Soon thro' the court the dreadful rumour ran; With frantic sorrow rave the female train. Struck with superior grief, Lavinia tears Her blooming rosy cheeks, and golden hairs. To their loud shrieks the palace-walls reply; Thence thro' the town the fatal tidings fly. All feel the stroke; and all, the loss lament; His royal robes the rev'rend monarch rent. In wild despair, with furious hands he spread A cloud of dust o'er all his hoary head; And weeps and mourns aloud (a moving scene!) His ruin'd empire, and self-murder'd queen. Oft, but in vain, he blam'd himself alone, That rashly he refus'd the Trojan for his son. But now more slow his progress Turnus held, 871. Chas'd.] The languid flow of the lines in the original (says Dr. Trapp) expresses weariness and dejection.And chas'd a few poor stragglers o'er the field. With heartless chear, dejected, he proceeds; And with their master flag the fiery steeds. 874. He hears the tumult.] From this confusion in the city, with what address does the poet return to the battle! He makes Turnus, who is in the field, hear the cries and confus'd noise of the distressed city at a distance; by this means the poet gains an opportunity of bringing us back to the action. The expressions, cæcis terroribus, and confusæ sonus urbis, &amp; illætabile murmur, are so forcible, that they cannot surely escape the most unfeeling reader.He hears the tumult in the walls behind, Shrieks, cries, and shouts, that thicken in the wind. Alas! he cries, what clamours strike my ear! What sounds distressful from the town I hear! Then to the hero, as the steeds he stay'd, Thus in the driver's form the sister said; This way, my lord, your former course pursue, And urge your conquest o'er the hostile crew. Your friends defend the town; th'Italians there Wage with the Dardan chief an equal war. Against his Trojans let us bend our way, As num'rous, valiant, and renown'd, as they. Sister, the chief replies, whom well I knew (Tho' in a mortal form conceal'd from view) When you dissolv'd the league, by art with-held The single fight, and mingled in the field, O say! what pow'r dispatch'd thee from the skies, With this sad scene to shock thy mournful eyes? To share the labours of the dire debate, A weeping witness of thy brother's fate? That brother soon must perish on the plains! For ah! what chance, what beam of hope remains? I saw my dear Murranus yield his breath. Who call'd on Turnus in the pangs of death; Ev'n yet I see the warrior bite the ground, And the soul rushing thro' the mighty wound! I saw, where, stretch'd in dust, brave Ufens lay, Nor liv'd, this scene of ruin to survey, But shut out bondage from his closing eyes; His corse and arms remain the victor's prize. And shall I see the city wrapt in flame? What else was wanting to complete my shame? How will the Latians hoot their hero's flight! Gods!—how will Drances point them to the sight! But oh!—shall Latium see her hero fly?— 909. Is it so terrible.] Great is the spirit and gallantry of this speech; but 'tis excelled by the following sentiment of Pindar: ? ?????? ?? ????? ?????? ?? ?? ??? ???????? ????? ?? ????? ????????? ???? ?????, ??????? ????? ???????? Pindar. Olymp. Od. I. Epod. 3.Is it so terrible but once to die?— Hear me, oh hear me, all ye gods below! Since ev'ry pow'r celestial is my foe; Lo! I descend to your infernal coast, From realms of light, a great and glorious ghost, White, and unsully'd with that dire disgrace, Nor stain the splendors of my regal race! While yet he spoke, athwart the war with speed Flew bleeding Sages on his foamy steed. 918. Full in his face.] Virgil takes all opportunities of beautifying and enriching his poem with images, and such strokes as would have a fine effect in painting. Thus he could not omit the circumstance of the arrow sticking in the face of the messenger, who comes to inform Turnus of the dangerous situation of his friends, and the success of the enemy. In a picture, which is proverbially stil'd mutum poema, this arrow would produce an admirable expression, artfully calculated to shew distress and danger, and bespeaking bad news.Full in his face a feather'd arrow stood; And to the Daunian chief he calls aloud. Turnus, on you, our last, last hope depends; Oh! haste in pity, and relieve your friends: For, raging, to the town Æneas pours, To level with the dust the Latian tow'rs. See! o'er the roofs the fires tempestuous rise! Hark!—how they roar, and thunder in the skies! All eyes are fixt on you, and you alone: The king himself stands doubtful which to own, You, or your Trojan rival, for his son. Yet worse—his queen, till now your chief support, Self-murder'd, fills with terror all the court. Messapus only with Atinas stands, To guard the gates, and animate the bands; Whom in wedg'd ranks the hostile troops inclose, And round them thick an iron harvest grows; While you, for whom they fight, neglect the train, And idly wheel your chariot round the plain! 937. Thoughts confound the chief.] The preceding and following circumstances, viz. Turnus's hearing the distant, confused cries of the distrest city, and stopping to listen to them more distinctly; his mind presaging some sad misfortune; his pathetic lamentation for the death of many of his best and dearest friends; and his apprehensions of the bitter sarcasms Drances would cast upon him; the approach of Sages, who discovers to him that the city is reduced to the last extremity and that the queen has murder'd herself; and his reproach to Turnus for his ill-tim'd absence; his silent and inexpressible sorrow and surprize at this fatal news, Obstupuit varia confusus imagine rerum; and as soon as he returns to himself, his seeing, for the first object, the city in flames; his telling his sister that he is now resolved to perish; and his leaping out of the chariot, and rushing to the fight; are all circumstances, so strongly and naturally conceived and painted, that one can scarce speak of them with that calmness of approbation, which perhaps just criticism demands.A thousand various thoughts confound the chief, He stood; he gaz'd; his bosom swell'd with grief: Pride, conscious valour, fury, love, and shame, At once set all the hero in a flame. Soon as his soul recover'd from the stroke; Soon as, dispers'd, the cloud of passion broke; Back from his car, the ruin to behold, His eager eyes the mournful warrior roll'd, Where the fierce fires in burning torrents rise O'er the tall roofs; and, curling to the skies, Had wrapt a tow'r in flames, sublime and strong, Rais'd by himself, that roll'd on wheels along; Whence the bold soldier broke the war below, And rain'd an iron tempest on the foe. Now, sister, fate prevails; no more delay; I'll go where rigorous fortune points the way. Prepar'd the bitterness of death to bear, I'll meet this Trojan hand to hand in war. No more those eyes shall view thy brother's shame, Pursu'd, and flying o'er the field of fame; Give, give me, goddess, in this martial fire, This high-wrought blaze of fury, to expire. He said; and sudden, with an eager bound, Leap'd from the trembling chariot to the ground; Leaves his lamenting sister, in despair; Springs thro' a storm of darts, the prince to dare; And bursts impetuous thro' the ranks of war. 964. As when, by age.] This simile is drawn from B. XIII. of the Iliad; and it is justly esteem'd one of the noblest in all Home. Tasso has copied it, B. XVIII. St. 8z. As an old rock, which age, or stormy wind, Tears from some craggy hill, or mountain steep, Doth break, doth bruise, and into dust doth grind Woods, houses, hamlets, herds, and folds of sheep; So fell the beam, and down with it all kind Of arms, of weapons, and of men, did sweep. Fairfax, from whom this translation is taken, has omitted the last line, which is more sonorous than Italian is generally thought to be: Tremar le mura, e rimbombaro i colli. Mr. Pope prefers Homer's simile to both Virgil's and Tasso's; and observes, that they have taken the image without the likeness. In Virgil (continues he) it is only the violence of Turnus in which the whole application consists; and in Tasso it has no other allusion, than to the fall of a tower in general. If we compare separately the circumstances of Hector's violent descent from the wall, his being pushed on by Jupiter, his meeting with, and being stopp'd by, the phalanx of the Ajaxes, and the immobility of both, when so stopp'd (the enemy being as unable to move him back, as he is to get forward), with the separate circumstances of the simile itself, we cannot but agree with Mr. Pope, whose translation of it is well worth the reader's perusal, since he has in it so strongly imag'd the violent bounding of the stone, the crackling of the wood, the shock, the noise, the rapidity, the irresistibility, the increase of force in its progress, and at last its sudden stop.As when, by age, or rains, or tempests, torn, A rock from some high precipice is borne; Trees, herds, and swains, involving in the sweep, The mass flies furious from th'aëreal steep; Leaps down the mountain's side, with many a bound, In fiery whirls, and smokes along the ground; So to the city, thro' the cleaving train, Thro' streams of blood, that drench the purpled plain, While round his head the whistling jav'lins play, As swift, the raging hero breaks his way. Then from afar, he beckons with his hand, And loudly thus bespoke his social band: To me, ye Latians, the whole war resign, All, all the fortune of the field is mine. 'Tis just, ye warriors, that your chief alone Assert the compact, or its breach atone. I claim, I claim the right, in single fray, To meet my rival, and decide the day. Back at the word the squadrons are compell'd, And for the champions form an open field. Now the great Trojan chief, at Turnus' name, Fierce from the town in all his terrors came; Leaves ev'ry second work of war behind; Joy, pride, and courage, raise his daring mind. All-flush'd with hopes, and glorying in his might, The godlike prince moves forward to the fight: He burns impatient for the dire alarms; And thunders in the bright Vulcanian arms. With vast gigantic strides, he tow'rs on high, 993. And looks a second Athos.] This simile is sublime to a great degree. Milton has imitated it, Par. L. B. IV. ? On th'other side Satan alarm'd, Collecting all his might, dilated stood; Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd: His stature reach'd the sky, and on his crest Sat horror plum'd. ? There is a very great strength and beauty in the conciseness and simplicity of, Quantus Athos, aut quantus Eryx; and it must be confess'd, that the Cum fremit ilicibus, quantus, and the gaudetque nivali, &amp;c. exceed any thing we find in Milton's comparison. Indeed, our great countryman would convey an idea different from Virgil's; he insists upon the fixedness of Teneriff or Atlas; whereas Virgil would represent Æneas enraged, and accordingly mentions the oaks on the top of the Apennines, as resounding with tempests; the gaudetque, &amp;c. means a triumphant boldness, a daring pride, and a rejoicing in his might. All these circumstances are implied in the verse preceding the simile: Lœtitia exultans, horrendumque intonet armis.And looks a second Athos in the sky; Or Eryx, that in heav'n his forehead shrouds; Or father Apennine involv'd in clouds, When with a depth of snows his brows are crown'd, And all his nodding groves, majestic, wave around. Meantime the warriors, who defend the town, Or with huge engines break the bulwarks down, And all the nations, studious of the sight, Their arms unbuckled, to survey the fight. Ev'n death stands still; and, o'er the crouded plains, Thro' the long ranks, a solemn silence reigns. 1004. Nor less amaz'd.] This reflection of Latinus is natural, and agreeable to the bienséance or decorum of the manners. Old men are very susceptible of impressions of this kind. It was certainly something wonderful and extraordinary, that two rivals, the one from Asia, and the other born in Italy, should be disputing for his daughter by force of arms. Catrou.Nor less amaz'd, the Latian lord beheld Two chiefs engag'd in combat on the field, By love, fate, honour, and ambition, led To try their title to his daughter's bed. Soon as each army from the field withdrew, Fierce, to the fight, the mighty heroes flew. They launch their spears; their clashing shields resound: Beneath their fury groans the trembling ground. Then their bright swords the raging champions drew, And with repeated blows the charge renew. Courage, and chance, and strength, in both unite; And the bold chiefs maintain an equal fight. 1016. As, where proud Sila's.] Tho' perhaps we have had too many comparisons drawn from lions, and tigers, and bulls, and wolves, and other savage animals, too nearly resembling each other; yet the passage before us, comparing the two heroes fighting for Lavinia, and the empire of Latium, to two bulls contending for the mastery of the meadows, and for the favourite heifers, contains such an exact point of likeness, as cannot but please the reader of taste.As, where proud Sila's tow'ring summits rise, Or huge Taburnus heaves into the skies, With frowning fronts two mighty bulls engage: A dreadful war the bellowing rivals wage: Far from the scene the trembling keepers fly; Struck dumb with terror, stand the heifers by; Nor know which lord the subject herds shall lead, And reign at large the monarch of the mead. Fierce strokes they aim, repeated o'er and o'er; Their dewlaps, necks, and sides, are bath'd in gore; The mountains, streams, and woods, rebellow to the roar. So to the fight the furious heroes fly, So clash their shields, and echo to the sky. 1029. Now Jove suspends.] This fiction is originally drawn from Homer, Iliad VIII. where the fates of Hector and Achilles are weigh'd. Milton introduces the Almighty weighing the fate of Satan and Gabriel: Th'Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray, Hung forth in heav'n his golden scales, yet seen Betwixt Astræa and the Scorpion sign; Wherein all things created first he weigh'd; The pendulous round earth, with balanc'd air, In counterpoise, now ponders all events; Battles, and realms: in these he puts two weights, The signal each of parting and of fight: The latter quick up flew, and kick'd the beam. Par. Lost, B. IV. ver. 996. This description may with justice, says Mr. Pope, be preferr'd both to Homer's and Virgil's, on account of the beautiful allusion to the sign of Libra in the heavens, and that noble imagination of the Maker's weighing the whole world at the creation, and all the events of it since; so correspondent at once to philosophy, and the stile of the Scriptures. Macrobius, Saturnal. B. V. cap. 13. aptly remarks, that these scales are not so justly applied by our poet, as by the Greek. We knew before, that Turnus would certainly perish, according to Juno's prediction: Nunc juvenem imparibus video concurrere fatis; Parcarumque dies, &amp; vis inimica propinquat. After this declaration, which unfortunately forestals the event, there was less reason for weighing his fate with that of Æneas.Now Jove suspends his scales; two diff'rent weights He cast in both, and try'd the warriors fates. This, light with conquest, to the gods ascends; That, charg'd with death, sinks downward to the fiends. With his drawn faulchion Turnus strikes the foe On his full stretch, and rises to the blow. Loud shouts and groans succeed; each army bent Their eager eyes, and wait the great event; When lo! all-shatter'd flies the traitor sword, And in the stroke deserts the Daunian lord. A stranger hilt he spies, and shakes in vain: All, all his hopes in flight alone remain; And, swifter than the wind, he darts along the plain. For when the chief first vaulted on the car With headlong haste, and rush'd into the war, He left his father's temper'd sword, 'tis said, And seiz'd his charioteer Metiscus' blade; And, ev'n with this, the growing slaughter spread, While from his rage the trembling Trojans fled. But when the mortal steel a stroke bestow'd On heav'nly arms, the labour of a god! The faulchion, faithless to the warrior's hand, Broke short—the fragments glitter'd on the sand. O'er the wide field distracted Turnus springs, And flies with wild affright in mazy rings: For here he views th'embattled Trojan pow'rs; Here a vast lake; and there the Latian tow'rs. But still his foe, tho' tardy from his wound, Treads all his steps, unrav'ling ev'ry round. 1058. As the fleet stag.] Virgil drew the close of this comparison from Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. B. II. ver. 278. but has finely improved it by the beauty of his diction: ?? ?? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ?????????? ????? ? ????? ??????? ?? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ?? ???????????? ???????? ????? ?? ???????? ???? ???????? ???????. As when the sagacious dogs trace out in the groves the horned goats or stags, the extremity of their jaws approach, and almost touch the hunted animal from behind, and they snap their teeth together in vain. The other circumstances are taken from a simile of the like subject, Homer's Iliad XXII.As the fleet stag, by the staunch hound pursu'd, Now bounds above the banks, now shoots along the flood; Now from the meshy toils with terror springs, Scar'd by the plumes, that dance upon the strings: He starts, he pants, he stares with wild amaze, And flies his op'ning foe a thousand ways. Close at his heels, the deep-mouth'd furious hound Turns, as he turns, and traces all the ground. On his full stretch he makes his eager way, And holds, or thinks he holds, the trembling prey. Forth darts the stag—his foe, cast far behind, Catches but empty air, and bites the wind. The hunters shout; the streams, the rocks, reply; And the tumultuous peals run rattling round the sky. Thus, flying in distress, the Daunian lord Calls on his friends; demands his trusty sword. But the great Trojan, with a lofty cry, Forbids the bands the weapon to supply; Denouncing death, and threat'ning all around, Th'imperial town to level with the ground. 1078. O'er ten large circuits, with a rapid pace, This hero leads, and that pursues the chace.] Tho' Hector in the Iliad has much more reason to fly from Achilles, than Turnus from Æneas, yet this flight of Turnus will not, I believe, appear an act of cowardice, if we consider his pressing circumstances, ver. 1037. The sword which he uses against Æneas (which was that of his charioteer Metiscus, and unluckily snatch'd up for his own by mistake) is broken in pieces, upon the celestial armour of the Trojan hero. Thus Turnus is at once disarmed, and naturally betakes himself to flight: on the one side is the Trojan army, on the other a broad lake; on another the walls of Laurentum. He calls out on his friends, to give him his own sword from the city, which Æneas forbids them to do with loud menaces. Thus distressed, he is obliged to suffer himself to be hunted, as it were, by Æneas, to the number of ten rounds. But, notwithstanding this behaviour, having regained his sword by the assistance of Juturna, he turns, and attacks Æneas. And thus the courage and fierceness of his character are justly supported. Mr. Pope, speaking of the flight of Hector, Iliad XXII. note on ver. 180. has these words. “If the reader, after all, cannot bring himself to like this passage for his own particular; yet to induce him to suspend his absolute censure, he may consider that Virgil had an uncommon esteem for it, as he has testify'd in transferring it almost intirely to the death of Turnus; where there was no necessity of making use of the like incidents: but doubtless he was touch'd with this episode, as with one of those which interest us most of the whole Iliad, by a spectacle at once so terrible, and so deplorable. I must also add the suffrage of Aristotle, who was so far from looking on this passage as ridiculous or blameable, that he esteem'd it marvellous and admirable.” [The passage is almost intirely applicable to the present case.] “The wonderful, says he, ought to have place in tragedy, but still more in epic poetry; which proceeds in this point even to the unreasonable: for as in epic poems one sees not the persons acting, so whatever passes the bounds of reason, is proper to produce the admirable and the marvelous. For example; what Homer says of Hector, pursued by Achilles, would appear ridiculous on the stage; for the spectators could not forbear laughing to see, on the one side, the Greeks standing without any motion; and, on the other, Achilles pursuing Hector, and making signs to the troops not to dart at him. But all this does not appear, when we read the poem; for what is wonderful is always agreeable; and, as a proof of it, we find, that they who relate any thing, usually add something to the truth, that it may the better please those who hear it.” The same great critic vindicates this passage in the chapter following: “A poet, says he, is inexcusable, if he introduces such things as are impossible according to the rules of poetry: but this ceases to be a fault, if by those means he attends to the thing proposed; for he has then brought about what he intended; for example, if he renders, by it, any part of his poem more astonishing or admirable. Such is the place in the Iliad, where Achilles pursues Hector.” Aristot. Poet. chap. 25, 26.O'er ten large circuits, with a rapid pace, This hero leads, and that pursues the chace. No light reward must crown their eager strife; The long-contended prize is Turnus' noble life! 1082. An olive stood.] The true poet dignifies every the meanest object. The trunk of an old tree, in which Æneas happen'd to stick his spear, was an olive, says Virgil, consecrated to Faunus, which the Trojans had with great impiety (as Turnus says, to cast odium on his enemies) lately cut down.To Faunus sacred had an olive stood: The shipwreck'd sailors, on the hallow'd wood, Hung their devoted vests in honour of the god. But late, to leave the field for combat free, The Trojans fell'd the venerable tree. Full in the root, Æneas drove his spear: The dart, deep riveted, stood trembling there: The hero, struggling with incessant pain, Now bends to disengage the lance again; And with his dart, at least, o'ertake the foe, Who, frighted, to the god preferr'd his vow. Thy suppliant's pray'r, in pity, Faunus, hear, And thou, kind mother Earth, detain the spear; If still I honour'd with a pious hand Your plant, by guilty Troy with steel profan'd. Thus he; the god attends his humble strain; The Trojan labours at the root in vain: There as he tugs the lance with all his might, Fierce, and impatient to renew the fight, Once more Juturna to the chief restor'd (In brave Metiscus' form) his temper'd sword. This heav'nly Venus view'd with high disdain, And from the root releas'd the dart again. 1105. The tow'ring chiefs advance.] Just as we expected the heroes would engage in a decisive combat, the poet stops short, and introduces a dialogue betwixt Jupiter and Juno on this important action. Such unexpected pauses are highly judicious, awaken and raise the reader's attention, and make him impatient for the event.Renew'd in might, the tow'ring chiefs advance; One shook the sword, and one the flaming lance. Their heaving bosoms swell with stern delight, Pant for the combat, and demand the fight. Then to his consort, who the war survey'd Thron'd on a golden cloud, the Thund'rer said: What schemes, my queen, are left, with vain debate, Ev'n yet to check the ripe events of fate? You know, and own, Æneas soon must rise From earth, already sacred to the skies. Long since, those glories to the chief are ow'd, And heav'n now opens to receive the god. To what fond purpose then this fruitless care? To linger in the clouds, and urge the war? Say, was it just, to wake the dire alarms? To violate a god with mortal arms, When the bold sister to the chief restor'd, By thy assistance, his paternal sword? (For what without thy succour could she dare?) And sent the vanquish'd Turnus to the war? At length, at length, the needless strife give o'er; At my request, indulge your rage no more; Nor let revenge, dire enemy to rest, For ever prey on that immortal breast. Oh! let thy lord thy secret sorrow share, Or, more than share it, give me all thy care! To their last sacred point the fates are come; Here, here they fix th'unalterable doom. The Latian court in ruins could you lay, And drive the Trojans o'er the land and sea; Profane with blood the holy bridal rite, Rekindle war, and urge them to the fight; This we indulg'd: now give thy efforts o'er At our command; and thwart the fates no more. So spoke th'imperial sov'reign of the skies; 1140. And, in submissive.] Virgil, we have seen, has divided his poem, as Homer did his Odyssey. The first part contains the voyage and arrival of Æneas in Italy; the second his establishment there. But he has connected these two great events better than Homer, by giving them a common intrigue or plot. He did not introduce, for the first part of his intrigue, a deity who could act no-where but by sea, as the Neptune of Homer; but makes choice of Juno, the goddess of the air, who had an equal power over sea and land. She at first vigorously opposes the voyage of our hero, and afterwards his settlement. This opposition then is what constitutes the general intrigue of the whole action. The solution of the plot or intrigue begins, when the anger of Juno is soften'd, and she is appeas'd by Jupiter, as she appears to be in this passage of the twelfth Book of the Æneid. Bossu, B. II. c. 13.And, in submissive terms, the queen replies: Great sire; because thy sacred will I know, I left my Turnus to his doom below. Nor had I sat, but at the will of Jove, Disgrac'd and pensive, in the clouds above; But in the front of fight my foes engag'd, And, wrapt in flames, through all the battle rag'd; I bade Juturna mingle in the strife, Nay, venture more, to save a brother's life. That charge I own; but not to bend a bow, Or hurl a single jav'lin at the foe. This, this, I swear, by the black Stygian floods, The sole dread sanction of th'immortal gods: Now back to heav'n, great father, I repair, And from this hour renounce the hateful war. But yet I beg, O sov'reign of the sky! What not the hardest laws of fate deny; For your own Latium I implore this grace, This honour for your own majestic race; When by these nuptials both the realms combine, And in firm leagues of peace and friendship join; Still may thy Latians, still remain the same, Nor take from Troy their language, garb, or name! May the great race of Alban monarchs reign; Kings after kings the regal line sustain; And from th'Italian blood may Rome arise, In all her pride and glory, to the skies. But may a long oblivion quite destroy The last, last ruins, with the name of Troy! The goddess spoke; and, with a smile replies The sire of men, and monarch of the skies: Can Saturn's other heir, who reigns above, Th'imperial sister, and the wife, of Jove, With endless schemes of vengeance break her rest? Why burns such wrath in a celestial breast? Cease, cease, at length, and lay your anger by, Since with your wish, my empress, we comply. 1177. Th'Ausonians.] Here the poet gives a most artful reason why the Romans did not retain more of the Trojan customs, and names, and habits, than they were known to have done.Th'Ausonians ever shall remain the same In customs, garb, religion, and the name; And the lost Trojan race forget from whence they came: In manners, laws, and language, shall they join, And Ilion shall increase the Latian line. From hence a pious godlike race shall rise; 1183. The first of men, &amp;c.] Supra homines, supra ire Deos, &amp;c. Virgil (says Catrou) puts a very poignant satire into the mouth of Jupiter, against the gods. But I think we should not understand this passage exactly according to the letter. It is common among the poets, in describing exalted merit, to extol it above the gods. Notwithstanding this, Virgil should have remembred whom he introduced speaking.The first of men; the darlings of the skies. Nor all the nations of the world shall pay 1185. More glorious honours to thy name than they.] Juno was highly worshiped among the Romans; particularly by women of the first quality. She had a magnificent temple dedicated to her service, on the Aventine mount. Scipio brought her statue from Carthage to Rome. Catrou.More glorious honours to thy name, than they. Then, pleas'd and reconcil'd, the queen of Jove Flies to her palace, in the realms above. 'Twas then th'eternal sire of heav'n expell'd The watry goddess from the fighting field: 1190. Two hideous monsters.] It is to be observed (says Catrou), that Pluto is not the only deity who has furies under his jurisdiction. Jupiter has his likewise. Thus the gods were feign'd to punish crimes in this and the next life. In this noble passage, I think our translator has equall'd his original. Tho' Virgil's images are great, yet how much more terrible, and with what a greater degree of sublimity, are the agents and instruments of Jehovah described in the sacred writings, when he is angry! Read particularly the following passage, Samuel 2 Book, chap. xxiv. And when the angel of the Lord stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people; It is enough!—stay now thine hand!—Two hideous monsters wait obsequious by, Tremendous fiends! the furies of the sky; Hell-born and horrible, they sprung to light, With dire Megæra, from the womb of Night. Huge wreaths of serpent spires their temples bound: Their wings in whirlwinds drove the air around. When bent the minds of mortal men to scare With the black horrors of the last despair; When for the guilty world the god prepares Woes, death, disease, blue pestilence, and wars; In pomp terrific, frown the fiends abhorr'd, 1201. Before the throne.] After this manner Satan appears in heaven; the book of Job, chap. i. ver. 6.Before the throne of heav'n's almighty lord; To wreak his vengeance, in his courts they stand, Watch his imperial nod, and fly at his command. Of these the swiftest from the skies he sent, To fright the goddess with the dire portent. Fir'd with her charge, the fiend, with rapid flight, Shot in a whirlwind from Olympus' height. As when the Parthian dips, with fatal art, And doubly arms, with death, th'envenom'd dart; He draws the circling bow; the quiv'ring string Twangs; and the weapon whizzes on the wing: So swift to earth the baleful fury flew, Till Turnus and the hosts appear'd in view. 1214. Who lo! contracted.] Alitis in parvæ. The epithet parvæ seems improperly applied to an owl, which the bird here spoken of, is supposed to be. Cunningham tells us, that pravæ is to be found in Cod. Markiano. This word pravæ has the same import as obscœnæ, obscœnœque volucres, Virg. B. XII. and Ovid calls this bird profana avis, Met. B. VIII. 543. Johan. Pierius, who gives us most of the various readings of our author in his castigation. Æneid. Virgil. takes no notice of this word. The reader will observe the fine effect of the spondee in the fifth place, in the following line, culminibus desertis, which strongly represents the melancholy image intended.When lo! contracted, to the bird she turns, That hoots o'er desolated piles and urns, Whose piercing strains the midnight hours invade, And break the solemn silence of the shade. Chang'd to this form obscene, the fury flies Round Turnus' head, and chills him with surprize; This way and that she flutters o'er the field, And screams his death, and beats his sounding shield. His inmost soul a sudden horror stung; 1223. Stiff rose his hair.] However simple this circumstance may appear, yet the antients who so faithfully represent the genuine feelings of nature, always mention the erection of the hair as a strong mark of dread and terror. Sophocles, in that wonderfully sublime scene, where the death of Oedipus is described, after telling us how loudly he and his daughters lamented on their taking leave of each other, adds—A silence ensued: when suddenly a certain voice called out, Oedipus, aloud, so that the hairs of all present were erected with fear; ?? ??? ?????, ?????? ?? ???????? ????? ?????? ?????, ???? ?????? ?????? ?????? ???? ???????? ???????? ??????. I would beg the reader to peruse the whole scene from verse 1666. to 1727. of the Oedipus Coloneus; for I know no piece of dramatic poetry that excites terror to so great a degree, except perhaps the Macbeth of Shakespear.Stiff rose his hair; amazement chain'd his tongue: But soon, too soon, the goddess knew the sound Of the black fury as she flies around: She tore her beauteous face in wild despair, Beat her white breast, and rent her golden hair. Ah me! she cries, in this unequal strife, How can thy sister now defend thy life? What can I more to lengthen out thy date, (Wretch that I am!) and stop the course of fate? How can I stand that hideous fiend of night? Hence, hence, ye furies!—lo, I quit the fight. Your threats, ye baleful birds of night, forbear, Nor fright a trembling goddess to despair. Too well I know your pinions clatt'ring round.— 1237. There was a scream.] This is a most lively, and animated translation of Lethalemque sonum; its being put into an exclamation, occasions one to think one hears the very sound! and cannot avoid making the reader tremble with horror!There was a scream!—Hell, hell is in the sound! You came (I know) commission'd from above, Sent by the high command of haughty Jove. This then, is this the sole reward bestow'd, For my lost honour, by the grateful god? Ah! why this lengthen'd life must I endure? Deny'd the taste of death, its only cure! Curs'd with the fruitless honours of the sky! Condemn'd to bear impos'd eternity! Pleas'd, with my brother wou'd I yield my breath, And share his fate, unprivileg'd from death. Joy is no more; and nothing Jove bestows In life immortal, but immortal woes! Earth! earth! thy inmost centre open throw, And rest a goddess in the shades below! Then in her azure robes she wrapt her head, Sigh'd, sobb'd, and plung'd into her watry bed; Her last low murmurs, as the stream divides, Work up in air, and bubble on the tides. Now at the foe, the Trojan hero shook His pointed spear, and sternly thus bespoke: What methods, Turnus, yet remain for flight? 'Tis strength, not swiftness, must decide the fight. Try all thy arts and vigour to escape Thy instant doom, and vary ev'ry shape; Wish for the morning's rapid wings, to fly; Shoot down to hell; or vault into the sky.— Not those insulting empty vaunts I dread, Reply'd the mournful chief (and shook his head); No—but the gods with fear my bosom move, 1267. And he, my greatest foe, almighty Jove?] We are now come to the conclusion of the poem, and to what the critics term the unravelling. It is necessary to make some difference between the action and the unravelling, whether it be of the epopœia in general, or of the Æneid in particular. The action here is the establishment of a Trojan colony: its unravelling is the cessation of all those obstacles which obstruct this establishment. Aristotle prescribes, that the action of the poem ought to have an historical verisimilitude; and that it is faulty when it admits the machinery of gods. In fact, would it not be fool-hardiness in an hero to attempt an action, from whence it would be impossible for him to escape safely, without a miracle? If then the fury is here introduced, it is as a circumstance belonging to the unravelling, and not to the action. As to the action, it is concluded, in the Æneis, in the most natural manner imaginable. Both parties engage in a sacrifice, and oaths are mutually sworn, that the Trojans shall be received in Italy, and that it shall be permitted them to make a settlement there, supposing that Æneas conquers Turnus. History has nothing more simple, or agreeable to truth. No deity forces or over-rules their sentiments; it is with the utmost freedom that the Trojans are admitted to compose a joint people with the Latins. But after all, a complication of circumstances still subsists. Turnus, yet living, is still an obstacle to the reception of the Trojans into the Latian territories. His death alone can be an unravelling of these complicated circumstances. But it is lawful to introduce gods for the unravelling, tho' it is contrary to rule, to make them contribute any thing to the action. The fury then contributes to remove the obstacle which Turnus forms against the establishment of the Trojans; and Juturna assists in prolonging the execution of his attempts. In this point Virgil's conduct is not contrary to the rules of art. In fine, the unravelling of the Æneid is of the number of those which Aristotle calls simple. He admits of two sorts, the simple and the implex. The simple is that which is carried on without a peripetie or remembrance. Thus, in the Iliad, the death of Hector removes all those obstacles which hindered the taking of Troy: and in the Æneid, the death of Turnus cuts off all those difficulties which kept back and detain'd the establishment of the Trojans. On the contrary, in the Odyssey, the unravelling is implex. This is always accompanied with a remembrance or discovery. Ulysses, disguis'd under the dress of a beggar, after having put to death the troublesome suitors of his wife Penelope, makes himself known to her. From the peripetie, the situation of both is suddenly changed for the better. Penelope ceases to be a prey to those princes who paid their addresses to her; and Ulysses, after a long absence, enjoys domestic tranquillity. It is to be own'd (with Aristotle), that the implex unravelling of the Odyssey is more complete than that of the Iliad, and consequently than that of the Æneid: but, the unravelling excepted, the Iliad infinitely surpasses the Odyssey and Æneid both. Catrou. I own I am of a contrary opinion, and do not think the Iliad exceeds the Odyssey, so much as some critics would persuade us: the moral of the latter is certainly more useful, and the images it contains, tho' of a milder and more domestic nature, are as strongly painted as any of the more fierce and glowing battle-pieces in the Iliad; and there is indisputably a much greater and more entertaining variety of accidents, events, and scenes, in the Odyssey. Mr. Pope has, I think, satisfactorily proved that Longinus is mistaken, in thinking this poem savours of the old age of Homer. It should be remembred, that the rule of Horace (so often quoted) Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus, relates intirely, and only, to dramatic poetry. Whoever has been conversant in the Greek tragedies, knows how many of their plots are unravelled by the interposition of some deity. See the Alceste of Euripides, the Philoctetes of Sophocles, and many others.And he, my greatest foe, almighty Jove! The warrior said; and cast his fiery eyes, Where an huge stone, a rocky fragment, lies; Black, rough, prodigious, vast!—the common bound For ages past, and barrier of the ground. Scarce twelve strong men the pond'rous mass could raise, Such as disgrace these dark degen'rate days. 1274. This in his trembling hand.] In B. XXI. of the Iliad, Pallas throws an huge stone at Mars. Mr. Pope observes, that the action in a mortal [Turnus] is somewhat extravagantly imagined: what principally renders it so (says he) is an addition of two lines to this simile, which Virgil borrows from another part of Homer; only with this difference, that, whereas Homer says no two men could raise such a stone, Virgil extends it to twelve: ? Saxum circumspicit ingens, Saxum antiquum, ingens, &amp;c, ? There is a beauty in the repetition of Saxum ingens in the second line; it makes us dwell upon the image, and gives us leisure to consider the vastness of the stone: Vix illud lecti bis sex cervice subirent, Qualia nunc hominum producit corpora tellus. May I be allowed to think, too, these lines are not so well introduced in Virgil? For it is just after Turnus is described as weaken'd and oppress'd with fears and ill omens: it exceeds probability; and Turnus, methinks, looks more like a knight-errant in a romance, than an hero in an epic poem. Thus far this great poet and critic, from whom in this case I shall beg leave to dissent. That Turnus was oppress'd with fears, and ill omens, is certain; but we are to consider this action as the last effort of a despairing man; and it is well known, that extremity of circumstances will call forth all a man's strength, and provoke him to exert all his abilities in a most suprising manner.This in his trembling hand he heav'd to throw. Ran with the load, and hurl'd it at the foe: But ran all-giddy with affright, nor knew Which way he took, nor what a weight he threw. His loose knees tremble, nor support their load: Round his cold heart congeals the settling blood. Short of the mark, and guiltless of a wound, Th'unwieldy mass came thund'ring to the ground. 1282. And, as when slumber.] The like simile is applied to Hector by Homer, Il. XXII. There is a certain listlessness and impotence in that line, Velle videmur, and in Mediis conatibus ægri, which finely corresponds with the weak and fruitless essays we seem to make in dreams.And, as when slumber seals the closing sight, The sick wild fancy labours in the night; Some dreadful visionary foe we shun With airy strides, but strive in vain to run; In vain our baffled limbs their pow'rs essay; We faint, we stagger, sink, and fall away; Drain'd of our strength, we neither fight nor fly, And on the tongue the struggling accents die The chief so labours, but with fruitless pain; The fiend still thwarts him, and he toils in vain! Amidst a thousand doubts, he stands opprest, A thousand terrors working in his breast. Now to the Latian battlements on high, Now to his friends, he turns his trembling eye, Now to the threat'ning lance, already wing'd to fly. No friendly aid, no glimm'ring hopes appear, No car, no steeds, nor goddess charioteer! With levell'd eye the Trojan mark'd the part; Then whirls with all his force the whizzing dart. A stone disploded, with less fury far, Flies from the brazen enginry of war: And wrap'd in flames, far less enrag'd and loud, Bursts the big thunder from the breaking cloud. Swift as the whirlwind sweeps along the skies, The jav'lin, charg'd with sure destruction, flies; Its rapid progress thro' the sev'n-fold shield, And the thick mail, with matchless fury held; Thence, thro' his thigh, drove deep the griding wound, And bent the hapless warrior to the ground. With peals of groans the pale Rutulians rise: The groves and mountains ring with mournful cries. His eyes and hands the vanquish'd hero rear'd, And to the chief his moving pray'r preferr'd: 1315. Prince.] 'Tis extremely judicious in the poet to make Turnus himself (whom perhaps we have been inclined to pity) fairly own, that he deserves to die, and that he has nothing to plead against his fate: the motive he makes use of to work upon the compassion of Æneas, by putting him in mind of his father Anchises, will appear the best chosen imaginable, if we recollect the tenderness and piety of our hero, so predominant in his character: and Turnus's solemn resignation of Lavinia, tua est Lavinia conjux, points out to us, and reminds us of, the occasion of the war, and of the combat which was to decide it.Prince, I deserve, nor deprecate my death: Then, use thy fortune; take my forfeit breath! Yet, if a parent's woes thy soul incline, Think what thy father was; then pity mine! Think at thy feet the hoary monarch thrown, Grov'ling, and pleading for an only son! Then save the son! in him the father save! Nor bow his age, with sorrow, to the grave! Or, oh! at least, this mercy I implore, My breathless relics to my friends restore. Thine is the conquest; lo! the Latian bands Behold their gen'ral stretch his suppliant hands! Restrain thy farther vengeance; I resign My former claim; the royal fair is thine. A while, the hero, touch'd with gen'rous woe, Repress'd his hand, and gaz'd upon the foe. 1331. His melting words to mercy now inclin'd.] The humanity of the hero is kept up and supported to the last. He pities, and is dispos'd to spare, his rival and inveterate enemy Turnus, till he accidentally casts his eyes on the spoils of his friend. This circumstance instantly awakens his anger, and gives justness to his indignation: and our judicious poet, by artfully putting the word immolat into the mouth of Æneas, suggests to the reader, that the death of Turnus is not a murder, but a sacrifice.His melting words to mercy now inclin'd, Still more and more, the victor's noble mind; When lo! by chance, the golden belt he spy'd, The belt of Pallas, glitt'ring at his side; Which from the dying youth the warrior tore, And the refulgent prize in triumph wore. His eyes, fierce-flaming, o'er the trophy roll, That wakes the slumb'ring vengeance in his soul. Then with loud accents, and a dreadful look, Stern and terrific, to the prince he spoke: Thou! wretch accurs'd! canst thou to grace pretend? Clad in the spoils of my dear murder'd friend? Go then, a victim to his spirit, go; 'Tis Pallas, Pallas, gives the fatal blow. Thus is his ghost aton'd.—The hero said; And bury'd in his breast the furious blade. With a deep groan the dying warrior fell, 1348. Plung'd to hell.] Virgil closes the whole scene of action by the death of Turnus, and leaves the rest to be imagin'd by the mind of the reader; he does not draw the picture at full length, but delineates it so far, that we cannot fail of imagining the whole draught. For it is evident, that the fall of Turnus, by giving Æneas a full power over Italy, answers the whole design and intention of the poem: had he gone farther, he had overshot his mark. Pope. Thus the action of the Æneid ends, according to the rules laid down by the best critics, where the mind is left in repose, without expectation of any farther event.And the majestic soul disdainful plung'd to hell. Thus have I endeavour'd to point out, in the foregoing notes, some of Virgil's capital beauties; in which it will be perceiv'd, that I have intended to consider him as a poet, rather than to play the grammarian and commentator. I am sensible, that I have not taken notice of every excellency that might be produc'd; but have left room for the reader to admire for himself: Virgil is an inexhaustible fund for observation, and different passages may strike different minds. I hope I have not often been guilty of blind panegyric, or fallen into a rapturous applause, without giving a reason. I rather fear I shall be censur'd by some, for the liberties I have sometimes taken in finding fault. However, it is with great diffidence of my own judgment, that I submit what I have done to the candour of the public, on which I rely. But, by way of conclusion to the whole, I would beg leave to recommend to such readers of the foregoing translations and remarks, as may be too much inclin'd to mistake malignity and censure for criticism and taste, the following excellent observations of the penetrating and judicious author of the Rambler. “Some (says he) seem always to read with the microscope of criticism, and employ their whole attention upon minute inelegance, or faults scarcely visible to common observation. The dissonance of a syllable, the recurrence of the same sound, the repetition of a particle, the smallest deviation from propriety, the slightest defect in construction or arrangement, swell before their eyes into enormities. As they discern with great exactness, they comprehend but a narrow compass; and know nothing of the justness of the design, the spirit of the performance, the artifice of connexion, or the harmony of the parts: they never conceive how small a proportion that which they are busy in contemplating bears to the whole; or how the trivial inaccuracies with which they are offended, are absorbed and lost in general excellence. “Others are furnished by criticism with a telescope. They see with great clearness whatever is too remote to be discovered by the rest of mankind, but are totally blind to all that lies immediately before them. They discover in every passage some secret meaning, some remote allusion, some artful allegory, or some occult imitation, which no other reader ever suspected; but they have no perception of the cogency of arguments, the contexture of narrations, the various colours of diction, or the flowery embellishments of fancy: of all that engages the attention of others, they are totally insensible, while they pry into the worlds of conjecture, and amuse themselves with phantoms in the clouds. “In criticism, as in every other art, we fail sometimes by our weakness, but more frequently by our fault. We are sometimes bewildered by ignorance, and sometimes by prejudice; but we seldom deviate far from the right, but when we deliver ourselves up to the direction of vanity.” The END.</field>
