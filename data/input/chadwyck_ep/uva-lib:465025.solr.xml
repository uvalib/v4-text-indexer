      <field name="fulltext">ALRICK and ISABEL: OR, THE UNHAPPY MARRIAGE. A POEM. In vain we forge coercive Chains, to bind The strongest, noblest Passion of the Mind: In vain with formal Laws we fence it round; Love, swift as Thought, impatient, leaps the Bound, And to its own congenial Object flies, Disdaining to be held with human Ties: For tho' extorted Vows may oft controul The Body, yet they cannot bind the Soul. This certain Truth my tragic Tale displays; Ye tender Parents, listen to my Lays; Nor force your Children into Hymen's Chain, For Titles, Honours, Dignities, or Gain: Indulge them with a voluntary Choice, As Love directs; for Love is Nature's Voice. So shall they live secure from jealous Cares, Divided Lodgings, and domestic Wars; In mutual Bliss enjoy the married State, Nor feel poor Isabel's unhappy Fate. Young Isabel from French Extraction sprung, Whose Charms supply'd a Theme for ev'ry Tongue: Her Face and Mind adorn'd with equal Grace; Bright was her Mind, and beautiful her Face: Genteel her Shape, majestic was her Air; As Cynthia chaste, nor less than Venus fair. Knights, wealthy Counts, and noble Dukes essay'd Their various Arts to win the beauteous Maid: But all their various Arts too feeble prove To win the Maid, or warm her Breast with Love. 'Tis Raymond only can her Heart inflame: Raymond, a gallant Youth of martial Fame. Yet tho' a Youth, he frequently had shown A Courage that procur'd him high Renown; And on the purple Plain had often stood The first in Danger for his Country's Good. Handsome he was, polite, and noble-soul'd; For Nature cast him in her choicest Mould; Compos'd his Body of the finest Clay, And warm'd his Mind with a diviner Ray; Blest him with Beauty, Wit, and pleasing Art, And ev'ry Grace to gain a Lady's Heart. But Fortune plac'd him in too low a State, Too small his Wealth, and Isabel's too great. Yet knowing none, but those who bravely dare Deserve the Palm in Love, as well as War; He, conscious of his Worth, resolves to try If Merit might the Want of Wealth supply; If Isabel would keep her Sex's Rule, To wed some glitt'ring Fop, some wealthy Fool; Or chuse a Man who grounded his Pretence On Virtue, Honour, Courage, Truth, and Sense. Some Distance from her Father's Dwelling stood An ancient, gloomy, venerable Wood; For many Years a solitary Grove, But now frequented by the Queen of Love: Who hither oft invites the beauteous Dame, And martial Youth to breathe his am'rous Flame. Here, while sweet Venus prompted what he said, And taught him how to win the list'ning Maid, Her watchful Son was ready to improve The lucky Time, and wounds the Nymph with Love: Nor wounds her only with a single Dart, But empties all his Quiver on her Heart. Soon spreads the pleasing Poison thro' her Veins, Soon heaves her Breast with strong contending Pains. She knew her vain ambitious Father meant To match her with a Man of high Descent: And tho' her Bosom burnt with warm Desire For Raymond, yet her Duty check'd the Fire. As when the Lightning flashes o'er the Fields, The ripen'd Harvest to its Fury yields; Now glow the Flames, and now descending Rains Repel their raging Heat, and cool the Plains: Thus Love and Duty rule her Soul by Turns; And now to this she yields, and now with that she burns. When Night her Sleep-inviting Curtain spread, And ev'n her Slaves repos'd themselves in Bed, More wretched than her Slaves, the waking Dame In sad Soliloquy would thus exclaim: O cruel Love! O disobedient Fire! Thus to controul my Duty to my Sire! More cruel Sire! whose hard Commands controul The Love which fiercely glows within my Soul! It rages daily with increasing Pain; I strive to quench it, but I strive in vain. In vain I call in Reason to my Aid, I feel my Reason for my Passion plead. It tells me, gallant Raymond is possest Of all the Charms that make a Woman blest. What tho' an equal Fortune Heav'n deny? Our gen'rous Love will all Defects supply. Yet happier, had the partial Hand of Fate Sent him a greater, me a less Estate: On Terms allow'd we then had join'd our Hands, And willing Parents blest our nuptial Bands. While nightly thus complain'd the doubtful Maid, Her mournful Words her hapless Flame betray'd. Close-list'ning at her Door, the Maiden Aunt (Dread Foe to Youth and Love!) observ'd her Plaint; And to her Sire the hateful Tidings bore, Discover'd all she heard, and added more: How Isabel, regardless of her Fame, Would quit his House to gratify her Flame; To wed a Youth of undistinguish'd Birth, And stain his noble Blood with vulgar Earth. As when a cautious Miser has been told, Some Thief intends to steal his hoarded Gold, He fortifies his Doors with Bolts and Bars, And wastes the sleepless Night in anxious Fears, To guard his Treasure: Thus the Father strove To guard his Daughter from the Felon, Love. When Morning came, he doom'd th'unwilling Fair To be the Consort of a noble Heir, Descended from a Race of ancient Fame; A wealthy Lord, and Alrick was his Name: Of large Possessions, but of narrow Soul; Suspicious, proud, impatient of Controul: His Form ungraceful, and so fitly join'd To a revengeful, crooked, barb'rous Mind, He seem'd a Foil in Isabella's Sight, And shew'd her Raymond in a fairer Light. Now Phœbus, wrapt in gloomy Clouds, arose, As if unwilling to behold her Woes: Her Father bids her for the Match prepare, Deaf to her flowing Tears, and fruitless Pray'r. In vain she would protract her nuptial Day; Her cruel Sire admits of no Delay, Compels her to obey his stern Commands, And join with Alrick her reluctant Hands. What Pencil now can paint her deep Distress? What Muse her sad conflicting Thoughts express? For when the Priest the sacred Rites began, And ask'd, If Isabel would wed this Man? She, trembling, pale, and speechless, knew not how To form her Voice, and speak the binding Vow. Yet, tho' her Heart, presaging future Ill, Forbad her fault'ring Tongue to say, I will; She made her fault'ring Tongue at length comply; She said, I will, and gave her Heart the Lye. Soon as the fatal Knot was firmly ty'd, Into her Room withdrew the Virgin Bride: Where copious Floods of Grief began to rise, That burst the crystal Sluices of her Eyes. In Sorrow, Rage, Confusion and Despair, She beat her throbbing Breast, and tore her Hair: Yet mindful of the sacred Vow she made, By honest Fame, and conscious Duty, sway'd, To check the glowing Passion of his Breast, She thus to Raymond writes her last Request: Unhappy Youth! suppress thy am'rous Flame, Or fix it on a more deserving Dame; Nor e'er indulge another Thought of me (Ah! could I ne'er indulge a Thought of thee!): My wretched Person never must be thine, For now, alas! it is no longer mine. This Morning forc'd into the Marriage State, I'm bound, from thee I love, to him I hate; Compell'd to be the wealthy Alrick's Bride. Such was my Father's Will—and I comply'd. Henceforward must I banish from my Heart All former Love—And thus we ever part. This Letter, by a trusty Hand convey'd, The Youth receives, and smiles before he read: His Heart dilates with rising Joy; for well He knew, and kiss'd the Love-expressing Seal; Expecting 'twas a Messenger to bear The welcome Vows of Isabel the fair; To tell him when she would resign her Charms, And make him happy in her faithful Arms. But when the broken Wax disclos'd the Scene, He trembles at the dreadful News within. As when, in Spring, a rural Nymph explores The gayly-spangled Mead for fragrant Flow'rs, Beneath the fragrant Flow'rs a Serpent lies; She sees, she starts, she trembles with Surprize: So trembles frighted Raymond, when he views The Letter which convey'd the fatal News. The Springs of Life, a while, suspended stood, Till Rage, at length, impell'd the purple Flood. And then he rail'd against the beauteous Dame, And curs'd the fickle Object of his Flame: Unsheath'd his Sword to pierce his tortur'd Breast; For Life was hateful, Death he counted best. But rous'd with nobler Thoughts, the Warrior chose To die amidst an Host of martial Foes; By some heroic Action end his Care, And fall beneath the Thunders of the War. Determin'd bravely thus, without Delay, To the Pannonian Plains he posts away. Beholding there the German Eagle yield, Chas'd by the Turkish Crescent o'er the Field, He lends th'Imperial Troops his timely Aid, Reform'd the Errors which their Leaders made; Rallies their Squadrons with judicious Care, Renews the Fight, re-animates the War. As when, on Phrygian Fields, Minerva fir'd Her routed Grecians, and their Hearts inspir'd With more than mortal Courage; Raymond so Inspir'd the German Troops to meet the Foe. Profuse of Life, and prodigal of Blood, He combats where the thickest Legions stood; Spreads Death and Desolation o'er the Plain, And strews the purple Field with Heaps of Slain. Where-e'er he turns, a destin'd Warrior bleeds: The Germans emulate his glorious Deeds: All feel new Ardour warm their martial Souls; Back on the Turks the Tide of Battle rolls. So, when the silver Queen of Night has cast Her wond'rous Influence o'er the wat'ry Waste, The wat'ry Waste, which lowly ebb'd before, Returns, and foams, and smoaks against the Shore. Brave Raymond breaks their close-compacted Lines, His flaming Falchion like a Comet shines, Which terrifies Beholders from afar, And threatens Famine, Death, and dreadful War. But what great Actions he perform'd; how well The Hero fought, how gloriously he fell; Let others sing: Enough for me to say, He bravely turn'd the Fortune of the Day. Mean while, young Isabel, the wretched Wife, Endures, but not enjoys, a marry'd Life. For tho' her Husband glows with fond Desire, She ever wish'd to shun his am'rous Fire; And tho', averse, she takes him to her Arms, No mutual Flame her languid Bosom warms. Thrice happy Creatures! often would she say, Who free by Nature, Nature's Laws obey! The fleecy Flocks, which round the Meadows rove, Are never bound to those they cannot love. The feather'd Songsters chuse themselves a Mate, Not cruelly confin'd to one they hate. Pleas'd with their Choice, they seek the shady Groves, And sweetly warble forth their little Loves: Or on their verdant Carpets sport and toy, With mutual Innocence, and mutual Joy. Whilst I, a Wretch of Reason! am confin'd To forc'd Embraces, hateful to my Mind: Compell'd to please the Man I least approve, Compell'd to shun the Man whom most I love. Bewilder'd thus in Reason's winding Maze, She pass'd her joyless Nights, and mournful Days; Till from her pining Cheek the Roses fade, The Lilies wither'd, and her Health decay'd. A pensive Gloom o'ercast her troubled Mind; And Alrick, jealous grown, now grew unkind. He fansy'd Raymond had possess'd her Charms: Hence all her cold Indiff'rence to his Arms. Corroding Thought! injurious to the Dame, Who still preserv'd her Virtue, and her Fame! How vain is Man! how fruitful to invent Imaginary Scenes of Discontent! As if the real Ills of Life were few, His restless, tort'ring Fancy, forges new, Pain he would shun, and Pleasure would obtain; Yet flies from Pleasure, and embraces Pain; Neglects the genuine Good which Heav'n bestows, While empty Shadows fright him from Repose. Thus vain Chimera's haunted Alrick's Breast, Disturb'd his Days, and robb'd his Nights of Rest. He wishes, tho' he fears, a Proof to find: As yet, 'twas only Doubt perplex'd his Mind: Till on a fatal Day, before his Gate, He saw the faithful Page of Raymond wait. The Page he knew, and fearing lest he came To act the Pander of his Master's Flame, Commands him to be search'd; and found he brought A Box to Isabel, with Powder fraught; A Letter, which confirm'd his jealous Pain, And quite inflam'd the Fever of his Brain. Villain! he cries; Is this your Master's Art, With Drugs to taint my Isabella's Heart? Is it with Philtres, and bewitching Charms, The Wretch deludes her to his lawless Arms? If e'er—But hence! begone!—avoid my Rage! He said; and calmly thus reply'd the Page: This Passion, Sir, your Reason quite disarms; I bring no Philtres, no bewitching Charms. Nor shall my Master (Master now no more!) E'er give you Cause for one uneasy Hour. These Eyes beheld the gallant Raymond fall, 'Midst Heaps of slaughter'd Turks, near Buda's Wall. There the brave Warrior in my Arms expir'd; Me, mournful Charge, his dying Voice requir'd, His Heart to Ashes turn'd, with Speed to bear The sacred Dust to Isabel the fair. My Heart, he said, belongs to her alone, And 'tis but just she should receive her own. Behold it there!—The Letter which you found, He writ with Blood, fast-flowing from his Wound: Bear it to Isabel, he fainting cry'd; Bear it to Isabel. He said, and dy'd. This have I brought, obedient to his Word; Forgive my Duty to my dying Lord. Trembling with Rage, the Letter Alrick read; The Letter suits with what the Servant said; And thus the bloody Testament display'd: Since Fate forbids me longer here to live, To you, dear Isabel! my Heart I give; That faithful Heart, which formerly has flown On eager Wings of Love, to meet your own. 'Twas then a Present worthy you to take; Now bleeding, and expiring, for your sake. Yet ev'n in these dread Moments fondly true; I die with Pleasure, since I die for you. As when the hollow Winds, portending Rain, Work up in rising Waves the level Main: The Sailor trembles: Soon the Tempest roars, And raging Billows shake the sounding Shores: Thus Alrick's Breast, suspicious of the Fair, Late rouz'd, and toss'd with Gusts of jealous Care, Is now all Storm; conflicting Passions roll, Distract his Reason, and o'erwhelm his Soul. Yes! yes! he cries; the base, disloyal Dame, Has sure, too sure, repaid her Raymond's Flame. But softly—Let me not forget to bear The Villain's Present to the faithless Fair— 'Tis well!—Now, sweet Revenge, perform thy Part! His Heart he sends her—She shall have his Heart. And now, to vent the Malice of his Breast, Cruel as Atreus at his bloody Feast, He makes his Cook an horrid Dish prepare, A Dish of Raymond's Heart; inhuman Fare! Which, mixt and drest with Skill, for Supper came; When thus his artful Words deceiv'd the Dame: My dearest Isabel! my duteous Wife! I grieve to see your melancholy Life. It fills my Bosom full of tender Care, To find your Health and Appetite impair. Your drooping Spirits richer Food require; Some cordial Meats, that sprightly Thoughts inspire. I have, To-night, prepar'd a choice Repast; A chearful Dish, and grateful to the Taste. Oblige me, Charmer; prove it, eat, and crown My Life with Joy, by cherishing your own. The Wife, obedient to her Husband's Will, (For tho' not loving, she was duteous still) Void of Suspicion, innocently eat, And eating, said, 'Twas sav'ry, pleasant Meat; And if it made her drooping Spirits light, She would have such for Supper ev'ry Night. Perfidious Woman! cries her cruel Lord; Could Raymond's Breast another Heart afford, That Heart another Supper should become, And in your faithless Bosom find a Tomb. But know, your Paramour has met his Fate: Know, 'tis your Minion's sordid Heart you eat; Which, if you doubt, this Letter shall disclose. He said, and Raymond's dying Letter shows. As when a baneful Basilisk conveys Destructive Poison in his visual Rays, The stupid Gazer motionless remains, The cold Blood stops, and curdles in his Veins: Not less astonish'd Isabella sate, Soon as the Letter told her Raymond's Fate. And chill'd with Horror of the barb'rous Feast, The vital Spring scarce moves within her Breast. But, as a Taper, ready to expire, Flames in the Socket with a brighter Fire: So she her last and greatest Effort made; Catch'd up the Dish again, and smiling said: Welcome, ye dear Remains! My bounteous Lord Has with a glorious Supper grac'd his Board. Had Epicurus search'd all Nature round, A nobler Feast he never could have found. 'Tis Height of Luxury! and pity 'twere To lose a Grain of this delicious Fare. Nor shall a Grain of Raymond's Heart be lost. This said, invoking his departed Ghost, She eat, as if delighted with the Taste, Nor left one Atom of the dire Repast. My Fate, she cries, is now propitious grown, To place my Lover's Heart so near my own— She ceas'd. The tort'ring Hand of hasty Death, In strong convulsive Pangs, suppress'd her Breath. Her wretched Father now laments too late His vain Ambition, and his Daughter's Fate. From hence let avaricious Parents know What Evils from unwilling Matches flow. In vain we for our Children make a Feast, If loathing Nature sickens at the Taste. Nature is free, and cannot force approve In any kind; and least of all, in Love. For Love's a God tenacious of his Right, Whom only voluntary Vows delight. If then we rob him of the noblest Part, And offer him our Hands, but not our Heart; He scorns our Off'ring, punishes the Cheat With Houshold Quarrels, Jealousy, and Hate; And shews us Marriage, when compell'd by Force, Proves not a Blessing, but the keenest Curse.
