      <field name="fulltext">Di rozzo inerto, evil, fa spesso amore. Generoso, et cortese, vn nobil core. The Argument. Loe heere, the fierie force of loue, redeemes the worthy wit, From seruile yoake: beinge drownde in sincke and stinkyng muddie pytte. Beholde how Reason yeldes to loue, and Uertue geueth place: The Ruler, blinded by desire, his noble fame deface. And see how wauering Fortune turnes, with euery blast of winde: First, gentle face, then frowning frets, she casts on longyng minde. From lowryng lookes, to smilyng cheers she eftsoones flittes againe: The lingring louer thus shee feedes, with hope his loue to gaine. And then from top of whirlyng wheele, she throwes him in the suddes: The captiue thence to raunsome then, with aide in haste she scuddes. And graunts at length his wisshed pray and onely hartes delight: Which he enioyed against the force, of forreine foes despight. A pleasant and most delightful Historie, of GALESVS, CYMON, and IPHIGENIA. An Ilande standes in TRITONS reigne, that CYPRVS hath to name: A Seate somtime, of Kingdomes nyne renowmde with lastyng fame. And for the great Amenitie, and fertilnes of soyle: Not subiect, or of value lesse, then any Occean Ile. Wherin, recorded lieth in time, of aged Fathers dayes: Amonst the Auncient Chronicles, and Monumentes of praise. This Historie, so rare to heare, as pleasant to be read: Of such as can with skyll peruse the same, with iudgyng head. There whilom was a noble man, that ARISTIPPVS hight: Whom Fortune deckt w? worldly giftes aboue eche other wight. So that, both tearmed well, he might and iustly happie bee: If his good hap not clouded were with Fortunes Tirrannie. For many Sonnes he had, yet one in beauty bare the Bell: In seemlynes of stature, eke dyd others farre excell. For all these giftes of nature, yet a meycocke wretch, was he: Whose name, his Parents first assignde, GALESVS for to bee. But sithe, he neither could conceiue, by Tutours learned mouthe: The documentes of PALLAS Arte, nor Muses skyll in youthe. Ne yet his fathers, graue Aduise, nor industrie of guide: Could make him leade a Courtiers lyfe or from his folie slide. And (for his speache was grosse, &amp; thicke and he enclined more To beastly, rude behauiour, then to ciuyll Courtly lore.) He was of all men (SIMON) callde, in iest, in sporte and game: Which word inferth, in Cyprian tongue a vyle, reprochefull name. And when his idle sluggish life, was griefe, to fathers harte, And of redresse, he saw all hope: was plainly laide aparte. And fearyng, least he should be vexte with dayly present woe: Sent CYMON, to vplandysh soyle, farre from his sight to goe. And Husbandrie to practise there. amongste the Clownish sorte: Of suche as delue, w? Spade &amp; Sholue, not lyke to Cytie sporte: Whiche thing, delighted Cymons heart (for one so rude, as he, Do ioye in Swinish maners more then in Cyuilitie.) Whylste he therfore, in Countrey toile and trauayle spendes the day: In tearyng vp with tusked Ploughe, the Lande, (that doth repay Twice toulde, and yearely, treble gain) his minde he doth conuerte: In lieu of liberall Sciences, of Tilthe to learne the Arte. It chaunc'de therfore vpon a daye, at after noone, as hee Was walkynge, through his Fathers fielde his Meades, &amp; Groues to see. Alone with walkynge staffe in hande he entred in a wood: But small: yet passyng sweete of all, that in the Countrey stoode. And (for it was the Month of May) and temperate pleasant Ayre: Beyng clothd w? greene delightful boughes it seemde to CYMON faire. Where vainly stalkyng vp and downe, with gazing heere and there: To view the pleasure, of the place, (Fortune his guide) came neere: And foote by foote, he passed through, a litle Meadow Plotte: Which hugie Trees, with loftie toppes, had compast, as a Moate. And through the place, a Riuer ranne, whose springyng Siluer Streames Did flow with coole, &amp; glisteryng ebbes, against sir PHEBVS Beames. Not farre from which, vpon the grasse he viewd, with fixed eye: A Uirgyn there, surprisde with sleepe, of Beautie great, to lie. The Garment, wherwith she was clad, was thinne, and shonne so bright, That almost no parte, of her Corps, was hid from CYMONS sight. And she was girtte, below the waste, with Lynnen, white as Skies: Nigh her two handmaides, tooke their rest an Eunuche, slept likewise. When Cymon first, this Uirgyn viewd amazde, he stoode in minde: Lyke as if he, in all his dayes, had not seene Womankinde, And leanyng on his knaggy Staffe, beholdes her Courtly grace: And speachlesse restes, and marketh wel the Beautie of her face. With diligence he prieth aboute, with neuer winkyng eye: Tyll all proporcions of her face, he dyd directly spie. Then foorthwith, in his sencelesse head, and grosse polluted minde: (Which no step of Urbanitie, by vertisment of frinde, And thousand gentle documentes, could pearce, before this tyme.) This new deuise, is risen now, this thought, his fancie clime: Which musing, he in blockish braine, to reason thus began: And beyng brutish as he was, in troubled head, dyd scan The fulgent brightnesse of her face, and (oh what thing,) said hee, Is equipollent, in this worlde to her formositie? Then pondred be with iudgyng eye, her amiable looke: And view'd the Uirgyns seemelinesse, in lieu of Psalter Booke. And noated all her lineamentes, of perfecte forme and shape: And praised greatly in his heart, in Natures Arte, hir happe And first her Heade, like goulden wyre, he painted foorth with praise, And fully was resolued in minde, they shonne as PHEBVS rayes. And then her forehead, nose, &amp; mouthe, her necke, her Armes and breast: To laude in heart, and muse theron in mynde, he neuer ceaste. Thus he, a rude, vplandish man, in twincklyng of an eye: Is now become of Beautie Iudge, to scan of Phisnomie. His greatest care, was now to see, her splendent glisteryng eye: Whiche drownde with sleepe &amp; drowsie dreames fast closde w? lids, did lie. Whiche, (CYMON) that he might beholde was minded to awake: From sleepe, this Damsell bright y? hee the view therof might take. But sithe she fairest seemde of all that earst he sawe with eye: He gan to feare, leaste that she were a Goddesse in the Skie. And (for he was so blunt of witte, that well he did not know: If heauenly things, more worthy were then thinges an earth that grow. Therfore somwhat, he brideled lust, and staide a time to see, If that her eyes, of owne free wyll would wake, or opened bee. And though this pawsinge seemed long, and griefe it was, to staye Unwonted pleasure, heald his hearte from partyng yet awaye: Thus CYMON gazyng styll, and yet enioyng lybertie In gaze: out of her sleepe, behould she waketh by and by. Her name hight IPHIGENIA, (so Parentes did deuise:) Whiche, when she lifted vp her head, and opened wide her eyes: And CYMON leanyng on his staffe, before her stande, she see: Amazde in minde, these wordes, or lyke to hym then vttered shee. (For Cyprians, knew their CYMON well, for his simplicitie: And partly for his Fathers wealthe, and great Nobylytie.) What seekste thou CYMON in this wood, at this tyme of the daye? Why wandrest thou so farre from home what causeth thee to staye? But Answere CYMON rendred none to IHPHIGENIA: But fixt his staryng eyes, on hers, not lookyng once away. For sure (he thought) a passyng smell, and great suavitie Proceeded from the fulgent light, of pleasant pearcyng eye. Which warmd his heart w? present sight and sodeine, wontlesse ioy: (A soueraigne salue to Maladies, to Cares, the chiefe annoye.) But when the Uirgyn well had markd his neuer winkyng looke: A chillyng horrour shakd her limmes and feare her Sences tooke. For doughte, least his vnciuill lyfe, with Clounish maners fraught: Might cause suspect, of Uirgyns vaunte that he, the pray had caught. (Whiche seyng, might without desert, redownde to her reproche: And knowyng well, how sclaunderous tongs on Uirgyns fame encroche:) In haste her handmaides she awakte, in purpose to departe: And farewell (CYMON) then she said, Adieu with all my harte. Th? answered CYMON in this sorte, my heart shall wayte on thee: (My Ioye) my selfe where ere thou go, shall beare thee companie. And though she flatly dyd refuse, his offred curtesie: Yet could she not reiect her Mate, vntyll with open eye He viewd, the stately dwellyng place, of her that made him thrall: Whose Aunsweres were to him more sharpe then taste of bytter gall. For when that swellyng heate of loue did boyle within his breast: And flamyng fire, did burne his lymmes and rage his hart opprest. And that he crau'de of her, (to quench his drowgh,) one droppe of grace: She spewd foorth spiteful ta?ting glikes at him, with frownyng face. And yet that moste procur'd his griefe, was partyng from her sight: That had attachd his Sences all with view, of liuely light. For (when she past, with stealyng steps, her Fathers hugie Gate:) She bard the same w? might &amp; mayne, against her friendly Mate. Then booted not, he knew right well, with showtyng cryes to call: And then perceiued, she scornd his loue, yet he remainde her thrall. A thous?d thoughts then hemd his wits in Caue and stricke of woe. And sundrie fancies framde, in hym, the roote of griefe to grow: His Brayne was eke, besiegde w? care, what wayes he might deuise: To conquere hate: and gaine the loue, of hir, that bleard his eyes. Thus musing now in minde, he standes in studie colde as Ice: And styll deuising how he may atchiue his enterprise. At length determinde, to reuerte, vnto his mansion place: And styll he hoopde, in tracte of time, to looke for better grace. And tumbled now, on carefull couche, in Countrey Cabyn lay: Inuentyng seuerall wayes, now this, now that, he did assay. But (sundrie consultacions passde,) in ende, he dyd conclude: To liue exilde from Countrey soyle, (for Countrey Clownes are rude.) Therfore, to Courte in haste, he hyes hym, to his Fathers howse: And stoutely to his Parentes sweares that he wyll hould the Plowes No longer now, or digge, and delue, and be a Countrey Slaue: But loathyng Countrey life, begyns, a ciuill lyfe to craue. Then newly gan his Fathers cares, and treble, wonted woe: His Friends, and Kinsmens griefe likewise began agayne to grow. Yet purposde they, a while to stay, the perfecte cause, to know: Of sodeyne chang, that forc'de this man his former guise forgoe. Therfore: wh? Cupids shaft, had perc'de this CYMONS restles hart: Through which could neuer penetrate, one iote of learned Arte. When CYMONS, sence was rauished with IPHIGENIAES face. Whose pulchritude of liuely looke, his glimpse of eye, did daze.) He, was not he, but chang'd his coate, his maners he began To change likewise, and was be come from thence, an altred man. This chang, to Courtiers seemed strang a wonder, to his feeres: An admiration, to his kinne, a ioy to fathers yeares. Then of his Father, first he crau'd, to be apparaild braue: As others of his Breethren were, and lyke Attire to haue. His Father graunted his request, and streight began he then To matche himselfe, in felowshyp, of Courtly Gentlemen: With diligence, he searchde, what things were, to a Louer fitte: And now in studiyng Tha'rte of Loue, did exercise his witte. And (whiche is merueilous to tell,) in momentarie space: To studie, geuyng hole delight, he learnynge did embrace. Amongste the wise Philosophers, he gayned likewise, fame With musing mou'd, to all mennes minds that knew of CYMONS name. The cause, of all this sodeyne change, was IHPHIGENIAS loue: Whiche made him banish lobbish lyfe, and rudenes to remoue. For (loue his guide) he did refourme, the stuttyng of his tongue: And of a dusked lisping voyce, his speache moste sweetely ronge In vttryng pleasant wordes, and hee of Musicke learnde the Arte: Of skyll in strydyng tramplyng Steedes, he had likewise, his parte. And skylfull was in feates of Armes, and Actes of Chiualrie: In warfare, well experienc'd too, by lande, and eke by Sea. And briefly, leaste his qualyties, and vertuous deedes, I shew: First this, then that, particularly, as in his hert they grew. In fine, I say: in foure yeares space: he warde a wiser man: And of more tried towardnesse, then any Cyprian. So that, more eloquent in wordes, and graue in countinaunce: He was esteemde, then Courtiers all, whom Fame, with prayse did haunce. What shall I therfore, speake of loue? my Pen how shall I frame? To yelde to him, deserued prayse? or blase his worthy fame? For when the fatal Starres, had dewde this CYMONS gentle heart: With Gentleman lyke qualyties, and skyll in Muses Arte. Disdainfull nature, causde the same within his hearte, to lie. Fast bownde &amp; chainde w? fettered linkes in LETHE waues, to die: And drowne for aye, in whirlepools huge yet Loue vntwounde the knotee: And vanquisht nature with his force, as foe, to luckie lotte. For Loue, oftimes is wonte to raise from duskish drowsie dreames: The drowned wittes, in sincke of slouth, and Graue of LETHE streames. And wrapt in clowdie darkenesse thick, CVPIDO bringes to light, The Sences: renting seruile yoacke, (suche is his vayle, and might And causeth them w? glimeryng beames, eftsoones, for to appeare: And shew so bright, to all mens sight, as PHEBVS gleming Spheare. And rauns?mes ofte, the noble heartes, from beepe, and darksome denne: And brings th?, with his glittering rayes vnto ELISIOS fenne. Therfore, while swelt?g heat, of loue did thril through CYMONS hert And he did (as the amorous sorte,) from right and reason starte: Yet ARISTIPPVS was content, what euer CYMON dyd: And toyed to see his sonne, so chaungde, which from his brest hath tyd All noysome cares: for that by loue his CYMON now became: From first, a sheepe, and clownish lowte a cyuill Gentylman. The Father, dayly addeth Spurres, vnto his Sonnes desire: And willes him neuer stay, tyll he vnto his lustes aspyre. When CYMONS minde conceu'd the truth his name GALESVS hight: Remembring IPHIGENIA, callde hym, CYMON, in despight. It greeu'd his hearte, and then his care was, to excirpe that fame: And out of memrie, roote and weede, that lewde despightfull name. And studiyng diuerse times, to quenche, his parchyng Brondes, of loue: (Whose fierie flakes, his heart assaylde, and mirth to mew had droue.) Of IPHIGENIAS father, he (who CYPSEVS hight) did craue. In gaynyng or his doughters loue, his friendly wyll to haue. But he affirmthe, a former graunte, is now alredy paste: And his consent, to PASYMONDE, before was fully plac'de. And said, he would not falsifie to him, his plyghted trouthe: (This PASMONDE was a Gentlem? of RHODES and flower of youthe. And now the time, to celebrate Thespousels, draweth neere: The Bridegrome sent, to fetch the Bride with gladsome merie cheere: All this, when CYMON had reuolu'd and pondred in his brest: The time approcheth now, thought hee, to purchase quiet rest. Yf euer, now: he mindes to shewe to IPHIGENIA: The scorching heate, of broylynge loue, that in his brest did staye. And now with diligence, to prooue his vowed Loyaltie: With mightie hande, for to withstande, her partynge from his eye. For thee, (he said) I frie and swelt, in Fornace, of desire: For of a Beaste, to manly shape thou madste mee to aspire. Yf that the Gods wyll graunte, that I to wyfe, may thee enioye: And thy Societie, to embrace, that shall my cares destroye. And doubtlesse, would I thinke in ioye; to passe my goulden yeares: And for to leade an Angelles lyfe, amongst the Princelie Peeres, And certes, Death shall ende my dayes, with dint of bloudie knife: But I, in spite of hatefull foes, wyll winne thee to my wyfe. He (reasonyng thus, in troubled brayne,) his friendes by stealth dyd call: (Suche as were borne, of noble bloud, to know what should befal.) To priuate counsell, whiche he helde, and opened there his minde: To them, &amp; what he woulde haue done, he leaueth not behinde. A Ship, then closely, he prepares, and deckes with furniture: Meete for the warre by Sea: and longe against his foes, to dure. Whiche vittailde well, and armed then he enters in the Ship. And cuttes the Seas, and sayle, &amp; sterne, to EOLVS doth commyt. The restless Tide, that beares his Barke with waltryng waues on Sea: Rowes wambling foorth: w? hope &amp; mirth were fedde his Mates and he, Away, the meerie Mariner hales, deuyding fomyng streames: The braggyng Boy, hies vp to toppe of Mastes loftie Beames. The waueryng Flag for Ioy is vaunst, the Seas begyn to swell: And he in hope amidst the stormes, of surgyng Seas, do dwell. And there, for IPHIGENIAES Sayle, he purposde then to staye: In whiche the Rhodians, to her Lorde to Rhoodes, shoulde her conuaye. And now the Father of the Bryde, receyu'd with courtesie: And honor greate: the men of Rhoodes whiche from her Husbande bee: To Cyprus sent, to that intent, to fetche her home in peace: Whiche shortly leaue, the fertyll lande, and lanche vnto the Seas. And towards Rhoodes, their Sayles they bende and Mastes they do directe: But CYMON lo, whiche to that ende, (therof not once suspecte.) Had warely watchde, with wakyng eye, the morowe vexte appeere: When PHEBVS banished, mistie clowdes and shonne in Skies full cleere. And with his garnisht Barcke for warre adournde with Armour bright: Encountred IPHIGENIAS Hulke, not distant farre from sight. And standynge formost in the front of swiftie Nauies Snoute: To IPHIGENIAS companie, he cryeth with clamour stoute, And saith: abide ye men of Rhoodes, and quickly strike ye Sayle: Els none shall scape the Gulphe of Seas (excepte my heart mee fayle. Then drew his foes, their shin?g Blades and armde themselues for fight: With courage stoute, and force, for to withstande sir CYMONS might. Wherto, when CYMON had respecte, he threw with manly might, A Grapple in the Rhodians Shippe, to let the same from flight. Wherwith, he staide their Barke: &amp; then most firmely fastned it Unto his Ship, with stemmes of Brasse, armde for the purpose fitte. And lyke the maned Lyon then, not crauynge aide of Mates: Alone he leapes into their Ship, and troubleth all estates. For (loue, augmentyng then his force,) he runnes with valiant hearte: Upon his foes, with bytyng Glayue, and playeth the Tigers parte. And lyke the Calydonian Boare, or LERNAS Lyons fierce: Whom ere he ratcht, w? Transfer bryght their faintyng lyms, did pearce. From some, he caru'd the shoulder boane, from others, made to slyde The legges: from others, he lykewyse dyd heade from Corps deuide. And when of them were diuers slayne, and many wounded sore: And heere did one, another there, lye sprawlyng in the floore. The Rhodians, then perceyuyng well, their force, was farre vnlyke: And halfe despeyryng, in their strength, thought bootelesse was to stryke, Or make resistance: and they sawe by flight they could not scape. To him did yelde their captiue corse, to whome, thus CYMON spake. Ye men of Rhodes, not want of wealth nor greedinesse of praye: Nor cancred hate, restes in my hearte, or towardes you do staye: That mou'd mee come, from Cyprus soyle: and you vnarmde, inuade, In midste of Seas: beyng armde my selfe, with keene and caruyng Blade. But this is cause, that force mee thus, and seemeth great, to mee: Whiche to atchieue, I make accompte, a recompence to bee. In guerdon of my former toyle, and hyre of trauayle paste, Whiche easely, and with quyet, you may graunt: (and purchase rest. Myne IPHIGENIA, she it is, who dearer is to mee: And gratefull more, then hande or lyfe, is her socyetie. Whome, when by gentle meanes I could not of her Father gayne: Loue forc'de me th? with Shield, w? Speare and Swoorde, her loue obteine. And armde with glitteryng Helme, &amp; creste by violence her to take From you: For so my mynde is bent, my Spouse and feere to make Her. And in lieu of PASYMONDE his function execute: Wherfore, deliuer her to mee, in haste, withoute pursuite. And NEPTVNE guidyng well your sayles to passe the swellyng Seas: Reuerte into your natiue lande, and hence departe with peace. The Rhodians then, whom force c?straind not franke, and free good wyll: With weepyng eyes, the Uirgyn yeldes Sir CYMON now vntyll. Which, when she saw her Corse was pledg and ransome for the rest: The trickling teares, like flowing stremes distylled downe her brest. Then (gentle Uirgyn) CYMON said, blurre not thy face with teares: But drie thine eyes, and cease thy griefe, there is no cause of feares. I am thy CYMON, that long time, haue lou'd thee in my hearte: And more deserue'd thee, to my wife, then PASMONDE, for his parte. For broylyng brands, of lawlesse loue, haue pearc'd for thee, my brest: And PASMONDE onely claymeth thee by reason of beehest And couenaunt, which thy father made, (this said) he doth returne, Unto his Mates; whiche in the Shippe, did all that time, soiourne. And brought his IPHIGENIA to Ship with him by hande: Unspoylde of stuffe, the Rhodian Ship he sent to Rhodian lande. Then CYMON, which on lyue, did think himselfe the happiest wight: Enrichde with suche a Royall pray, and precious to his sight. Deuised with his felowes nowe, their voyage to directe: On Seas, not to the Cyprian Soyle: but backewarde to reflecte. By commen counsel holden, they agreed, to Creete to sayle: Where all, &amp; chiefly CYMON thought, their foes coulde not preuayle. Against them there, for that they had both friendes and kinsmen too: So now, by all mens full consent, to Thyle of Creete, they go. Then lanche they foorth, &amp; hoiste vp Sayle (O TRITON be their guide: And brynge them safe to wisshed Porte, their face from foes to hide.) But see how waywarde Fortune now, begyns to turne her wheele: And grutchyng at his good successe, her crooked Spyndelles reele. For she that CYMON gratified, with IPHIGENIA: As noble, famous Goddesse? now hath tornde her face away. And changde his Ioyes, &amp; goulden happe, in moment of an howre: To soakyng sighes, to waplynge grones, of frownyng Fortunes lowre. Be packynge Muses, to your Mownte, your helpe is bootelesse, heere: I must amongst the Hellish shades, go seeke, to finde MEGERE. ALECTO, flie from LIMBO lake, and scudde from PLVTOS denne: And with your aide, assiste my Uerse, directe my rugged Penne. Twice, ij. houres, scarcely ended were sithe Rhodians home returne: But night with dimming darkenesse came, and mistie cloudes by turne Appearde in Skies: to CYMONS hearte, a ioyfull wisshed night. Which shuld be pleas?t more, he thought to him: then euer chanc'de to wight. But loe, a stormie tempest rise, the Skies with cloudes are blacke: And wauie Seas, with whirlyng winds, do tosse the Shippes to wracke. This hurly burly, blindes their eyes, and dulles their Sences so: That of them all, not one man knew, what thynge was best to doo. For all men, then began to feare, forgettyng Shipmens skyll: But who can paint with proper tearmes or plainly Pen, with quyll. What griefe y? tyme, gripte CYMONS hart for Goddes would not regarde: He thought, the force of flamyng loue, and sithe before he sparde Not: lyfe to lose, his loue to winne, in thought, then sure, said he:) With sharper stinge of death, the Gods, wyll take reuenge on mee. Now Cymons Mates, do weepe &amp; wayle But IPHIGENIA Aboue the rest shed bitter teares, and ofte cried wellawaye. And gulffde w? gripyng fittes, did quaile at euery blaste of winde: And euery storme of wallowing waues, opprest with wo; her minde, And drownde her eyes, with saltish teares, she vtterlye deteste: Sir CYMONS loue, and bouldnesse, that had purchaste her vnreste. As though, that stormie whirlwindes, not of other cause dyd swell: But by the wrathfull ire of Goddes, to wreacke with furie fell His boulde attempte: And wyllyng not that CYMON shoulde enioy The rauishte Uirgyn, quietlye, or free, without annoye. But sure she thought, by sentence iuste, of Gods, they both shoulde die: And ende their wretched direfull dayes, in wofull myserie. Amongst these Girlysh waylynges, then, and anguish of the minde: The watermen, and Maryners, were wauerynge as the winde, And doubtfull muche, whiche way to turne their Shyp, and them to saue: And (styll the windes begynnyng more, with boysteous blastes, to raue. Their bark, was driu? to the Ile of Rhodes whiche for the tempest, they Could not discerne, and know to bee, vpon the Rhodian Sea. And studiyng now, for onely healthe, they put their helpyng hande: Both all, and some to leaue the Seas, and bringe their Ship to lande. Where (as the Constellacions wrought) they landed at that place To whicke the Rhodians came before, whiche CYMON let to passe. And yet they knew not that they were arru'd at Rhodes, before That SOL displaide his splendent beames next morow on the shore. For then they sawe, the Ship at Hauen, whiche they did let departe: The day before: not distant more, from them, then throw of Darte. Wherfore, Sir Cymon pensiue now, leaste that shoulde chaunce did feare To him, whiche happed presently, as you shall after heare Then he commaundes with diligeuce the Ship from thence remoue, In haste: not caryng to what Porte, their Tacklynges els they shooue: For well he knewe, all other Portes, from daungers more were free: And SCYLLAS wombe, lesse wrackfull, then where now they landed bee. The Shipmens painfull trauayle, and his Mates endeuour now Were bootelesse: For the thrillie windes, styll backewardes dyd them blow. And by their force and sturdie strength, are driuen vpon the shore: Against their wyll, for wrastlyng styll, to turne from thence their Ore. The windes did land them, at the Hauen of Rhoodes: where by and by: The Rhodian Shipmen, knew right wel and did them streight descrie. Then of them one, did hastely ronne, to Towne, not distant farre: Where al the route, of Gallantes stoute, that tyme assembled ware. And orderly, reuealth to them, that IPHIGENIA: And CYMON, blowen w? stormie blasts tost on the roaryng Sea. Are now arriu'd at Rhodian lande, and all the circumstaunce, He shewes to them: And all thinges els, that hapte to them, by chaunce. (Which heard) the lustie youth of Rhodes did leape for present ioye: Euen lyke, as dyd the valient Grekes, at ouerthrow of Troy. And rushyng forth, lyke ragyng route, they mustred many men: And then with speede, vnto the Seas, they flockmeale, all dyd renne. Wher CYMON, hasting now his flight with IPHIGENIA: The Rhodians, him in midst of course preuente, and make to staye: Yet fayled not his noble hearte, to stande in his defence: Against the Rhodian warlyke Troupe, for first, he did dispence With lyfe: And wyllyng was to spende, his bloud vpon his foe: And many, by his Knightly force, their Sences dyd forgoe. And through his prowesse, some did yelde to ATROPOS their breathe: And some were maymde, and other slayne with direfull darte of Death. Yet vayled not, his valiant Actes: and chiualrous Renowne: For taken, hym, they Prysoner ledde, to next adioynyng Towne. Then thither came LISYMACHVS, whiche in that yeare by chaunce: Was Maiestrate: And in that Ile had chiefest gouernaunce. Beyng garded with a warlyke route, c?maundes, that CYMON, then And all his Aidantes, shoulde be throwen to deepe, and darksome denne. For PASMONDE, and the Senate eke of Rhoodes appointed so. When they, how all the matter stoode, effectuallie did know. Now hath th'unhappy Louer, loste his IPHIGENIA. Whome he had gainde not muche before, by fight vpon the Sea. Of whome he neuer tasted sweete, besides a litle hope: For hire of paynes allredy paste, to reape the goulden croppe. Saue that, he collde her lillie necke, and kist her rosie lippes: And claspte her ofte in foulded Armes, agayne: her Corps he clyppes. But all this sodayne ioye, is turnde agyne to wonted woe: His IPHIGENIA, now he must against his wyll forgoe. Thus wandrynge wide, to seeke for rest, in stormie tydes is trapte: And labouryng long, through Gulphes of waues, in care vnwares, is wrapte. Then fawnyng Fortune framde (he said) with painted face for shee: O brittle cursed Fate, that forc'de my state to alter so. The chiefe, and auncient Matrones, then receiu'de her courteously: And cherisde her with nourishmentes: And of captyuitie: Beyng partly sadde, her gulpyng griefe with solace, they appease: And partly weried, with the toyle, and trauayle on the Seas. And there abode she styll with them, vntyll th'appointed day. To celebrate Thespousell rites, had chasde the night awaye. To leade a captiue Prisoners lyfe, the Senate graunted now To CYMON and his Mates, for that some fauour they did show Unto the Rhodians: (for they gaue them, licence to departe: With bagge, and baggage, free fr? death) But PASMONDE, for his parte, With instant suite, did vrge that they, in pryson might be slayne: To whiche, they were condemnde for aye to leade their lyues in payne. Where they should ende their wretched dayes (as Reason did require:) Whyle breath doth last, depryu'de of hope to pleasures to aspyre. The meane whyle now, when PASYMOND for Nuptialles doth prepare: And all prouision needefull, he prouides with carkyng care. Beholde, how Fortune mou'd with ruthe of former acte repente: And now for CYMON, healthfull ayde the frendly doth inuent. Thus, loe: in gripe of death is lyfe, in Hell mouthe, helpe is founde: And LACHESIS, the knot half losde, hath fast, and firmely twounde. For entryng in, at PLVTOS doore, and yeldyng vp the Ghoste: With gaspyng oft for breath, see how his vertue, Death hath loste. And lyfe begynnes in him againe, to runne his wonted race: So, Death is banishd, and lyfe restorde by Fortunes gentle grace. This PASMONDE, had a Brother, namde HORMIDAS, yonge of yeares: But yet not lesse, in valiantnesse then PASMONDE, or his peeres. Which (long deliberation had) decreed to take to wife: A Uirgyn callde CASANDRA: and with her to leade his lyfe. And for she was, of seemely shape, adournde with Courtly grace: LISYMACHVS the Senatour did coueit to embrace. With stretched Armes, her comly Corps, whom with affection: hee Lykde in suche sorte, that he desirde her Louer for to bee. For restlesse rage, of scorchyng loue, tormented sore his hearte: Being clapt vnwares in VENVS clawes and stong with CVPIDS darte. Now PASIMONDE, solempnizyng, the Nuptiall iolytie: With sumptuous preparations, as was meete for his degree. Thought good, his Brother HORMIDAS, for to perswade, that they Might (entryng both in IVNOES Rites,) be Bryde groomes on a daye. So shoulde they saue, the double charge, and coastes, of Mariage feaste: Yet meante he, that of both their charge, his Brothers should be leaste. He therfore, w? CASSANDRAES frends the matter doth debate: And of her father crau'd, to graunte her, to be feere, and mate Unto his Brother HORMIDAS: and geuen to him, to wyfe: They shoulde be ioynde in sacred bondes, of wedlocke, all their lyfe. And that same daye, as he do wedde his IPHIGENIA: His Brother should be maryed too his Ladie CASSANDRA. These consultacions, corsyes were, vnto LISYMACHVS hearte: For (wanne of hope: and comfortlesse) from ioyes, he dyd departe: Yet with perswasions, fancie feedes hym, that CASSANDRA wyll, Be linckd with hym, in IVNOES lawes, and his desire fulfill. If that HORMIDAS wedde her not, and take her to his wyfe: These, and suche lyke occursions, then in mazed minde were ryfe. But as a prudent man should doo, (that claymes of wisdome parte:) He closely keepes, his dolour deepe: encheinde, within his hearte. And compassyng in swarming brayne, what wayes he might with speede Disturbe this Mariage, could not finde a lawfull meanes, in deede. Therfore, agrees he with him selfe, and fully doth conclude: To winne by force, the Uirgyns grace, and cares so to exclude. Which, wel (he thought,) he might atchiue and playnly bryng to passe: For that he bare the chiefest sway, and honor in that place. On thother parte, his dignytie and tipe of highe renowne Reuockte him, from that enterprise, whiche to his shame, should sowne. For that his shining Fame, doth adde dishonor to the facte: The more, yf one of his estate, committe so lewde an acte. But after muche aduisement had, Sir Loue, did gayne the place, Of honestie: and Reason too, to luste, did yelde his trace. And now LISYMACHVS, dothe haste with danger of his health: Yea: and with losse of lyfe: to take his praye awaye by stealthe. And roulyng oft in searchyng head, what order he might take: Or what assistentes he might vse, an ende therof to make. And bryng the matter to good passe, bethought himselfe anone: (As hap would haue, and Fortune gaue) of CYMON that dyd mone His thraldome, beyng closely clapte, in Gayle, and Dungeon deepe: Where straitly, hym, and all his mates, the Wardeyne styll did keepe. He, therfore pondryng well, the cause with, hearte, and hande agree: Unto this sentence: which, he mindes should ratyfied bee. That no man could be founde more true, or of fidelytie: This weightie charge, to take in hande then CYMON was, whome he The nexte night after, brought by stelthe, from deepe, and Hellike lake: Unto his Chamber, bossde with Goulde, and thus to him he spake. ORATIO LISYMACHI AD CYMONEM. Euen as (sir CYMON) Gods are b?t and alwayes redy bee. To geue their gracious gifts to men with store abundantly. So doo they too require of them, both paynfull industrie: And valiantness with diligence. and whom againe they see Strong harted, in calamity, to suffer crabbed chaunce: Those they, as worthy, manlyke men to honors great aduance. The Gods wolde, of thy courage stoute, a greater triall take: And more experience, of thy might. (more gloryous it to make. Then thou thy selfe, in Fathers house, of riches heapde with store:) Couldst make to shine, &amp; shew it selfe lyke bright, &amp; glistring ore, And (as the Fame flieth through y? town) the Goddes, haue framed thee: Of dull, and sencelesse blocke: a wyse, and wittie man to bee Besides: withe Fortune wrastlyng now, and thrall to filthy gayle. The Gods wyl trie thee, if thy strength, within thy hearte do quayle. Or if thou be that man, as earste, when thou with manlyke mighte: Obteinde the happie conquest: and didste wynne thy pray by fight: For if thou shew thy selfe the same, (as late thou were,) to bee: The Goddes, dyd neuer geue to man, more mirthfull iolytie. Or wisshed pleasure, and more Ioye then now they do entende: To graunt and yelde vnto thy hearte, thy heaped cares to ende. And what that is, I wyll in briefe, and fewe wordes, tell to thee, That thou maiste gather wonted hearte, and animositie. The glad and ioyfull PASYMONDE at thine vnhappie chaunce: And chiefe procurour of thy death, makes haste himselfe t'aduaunce. In mariage, to thy rightfull Bryde, thyne IPHIGENIA: Thespouselles eke to celebrate, appoinctes a solempne day. That therby, he might taste the sweete, of that thy conquerde praye: Whiche smylynge fortune, gaue to thee, and frownynge tooke awaye. And well I know, what corsie this should bee vnto thy hearte: If in thy brest, of scaldyng heate of loue, thou feale the smarte. HORMIDAS loe: that selfe same daye, intendes lyke iniurie: And wronge to mee, and lyke despyte, with hatefull Tirranie. For he wyll wed CASSANDRA, whom I minde to take to wyfe: Whose sight, so deare is to my hearte, as is to mee my lyfe. To take reuenge, of this reproche, and contumelious wronge: Fortune, hathe onely manhoode lefte to vs: as Fortresse stronge. Go too therfore, and (she our guide) let vs with naked Blade: Make violent way, and valiantly resistynge Foes inuade. To seconde rauisshement, for thee plucke vp thy noble hearte. And firste for mee, let force be found, To play his wonted parte. Yf thou wylt stoutly folow me, the Captayne, of this Acte: And guide of famous enterprise, and glorious shyning facte. Beholde, I yelde into thy handes, both auncient lybertie: And IPHIGENIA, I wyll giue, thy lawfull wyfe to bee. The which two thinges, thou oughtest to craue none earthly Treasure more: (For heartes delight, all men prefere. and healthe, their wealthe before.) These saynges of LISYMACHVS, did CYMONS hearte reuiue: And trylled, through his crased Corse, where Death, with lyfe did striue: And hope, hath vanquished now despeyre, and wilshed quiet rest. Enioyes within his hearte, the place, that dolors once possest. Then presently without delaye, vnto LISYMACHVS: Sir CYMON, framde his filed tale, and then, he answered thus. (LISYMACHVS) thou shalt not finde a hardier man then mee: Or of more tried faithfulnesse, or greater Constancie. To compasse this thy stoute attempte, yf so (as thou doest saye: That Fortune shall puriue the facte, in yeldyng graunted praye. Therfore, what charge vnto my lot, thou wilte assigne, forsee: And looke what office thou appoincte, shall gratefull bee to mee. And I wyll treade what pathe thou wilte and venture lyfe, to treade Amidste the steppes, of enemies Tentes, or yeldyng Serpentes heade. Say on therfore, not heartlesse, I or dreadyng fumyng foes: Wyll folowe thee my Captayne, thoughe my lyfe therby I lose: To this LISYMACVS replyed, within two dayes, saide he: Our foes concluded to proceede, vnto Solemnytie. In mariage of thy wife and mine, and then they shall be broughte: Unto their Bridegroomes mansion place, loe: thus I haue bethought. We armde, with other trustie Mates, at firste watche of the night: Shall rushynge in the house, conuey them from the feaste, by might. And rauishde: brynge them to a Ship, whiche for that purpose, I Haue made: &amp; hoouerynge causde on seas, not distant farre, to lye And no man wyll wee spare, of those, that wyll our purpose staye: Or our intent, with violence let, forestallynge vs, the waye. The order, to accomplysh thus the matter, pleasde him well: Whiche in the Pryson, tyll that daye, dissemblynge wise dyd dwell. And now hath PYROEIS, EOVS eke, with AETHON, and PHLEGON, Drawen foorth in Skies, the golden waine of bright, and glisteryng Sonne. And loe: AVRORE, her purple doores, hath opened in the easte: And LVCIFER, hath chasde the starres, and LVNA takes her rest. The day assignde, for mariage rytes, of louers wishde, is come: Which gorgeouslie, solemnizde were, with pompe: of all, and some While all the house, of brothers bothe, with regall ryot, shyne: And they in midste of costly cates, and quaffyng BACCHVS wine: The mene whyle, now LISYMACHVS not sleapyng his entente: Appointed well, with nedefull thinges, to due accomplishment. Of late decreed enterprice, his carued Blade doth hide: Within his Garment: so the rest, for feare, leaste they be spyde. Sir CYMON then, &amp; CYMONS men, and his men, he deuide: To three wynges: lottyng to eche ranke, a Captayne, and a guide. For some by stealthe, vnto the Hauen, LISYMACHVS hath sent: Least Rhodians, state their purpose, and of shyppyng them preuente. Some in y? Porch of PASMONDS house he closely causde to staye: For feare ther foes, their passage stoppe, or enterclude their waye. He, with the rest, and CYMON too, aboute prefired tyme: And as agreement was before, the Brydale house do clyme. They scale the walles, and win the Forte then enter they with force: The suppyng Ch?ber, where the Brides, refreshd with foode their Corse. Amongste them, other Ladyes sate, by order, in degree: At royall Table, richely dight, and garnishde sumptuouslie. With massie Bowles, of golden Cuppes, bedecte with Pearle, and Stone: With other G?mes, APOLLOS beames not muche vnlike that shonne. And furnishde well with speciall cates, and daintie Princelike fare: Yet CYMON and LISYMACHVS, for nought their purpose spare. But Tables headlong downe they hurle, and rush with reuell coyle: And take their Ladies, eche his owne, deuidyng so the spoyle. And to their Pages them commyt, which to that ende dyd staye: To brynge with speede vnto their shippes their longe desired praye. The Brides, and other Matrones then complete with howlynge cryes, With waylings huge, &amp; clamours great, do fyll the hautie Skies. Now CYMON and LISYMACHVS, with bloudie Blades in hande: Do make them waye, for no man dare, with force against them stande. Descendyng swiftly downe, they passe the Stayers with hastie foote: For (gainde their bootie) there to staye, they thought it was no boote. Where PASMOND mette w? them, and mazde with all this rustlyng broyle: And troublous rufflyng: purposde then, to rescue conquerde spoyle. And armde him with a hugie Staffe, and rashly wantynge might: To CYMON ranne with headlong pace, to vanquish hym by fight: But all in vaine, with peised stroke, well aymed at his head: He feld hym, where he staggeryng laye. before his feete for deade. HORMIDAS too, endeuouryng now, to quitte his Brothers death: Through CYMONS wo?d, lieth on the ground and gaspeth for his breathe. And diuers other reelde to th'earth, that by his might were slayne Which hand to hand, durst ieobard lyfe, the Combatte to darrayne. Thus haue these Louers, won w? Sword, and ventred lyfe to gayne Their Ladies. And withstanders all before their feete are slayne. And then, they leauynge PASMONDES house reflowynge all with bloud: (Whereof the great effusion staynde the grounde, where as they stoode. And bellowyng oft, with weepyng grones and boysterous stearyng prease) Without disturbers, all arryue, in safetie, at the Seas. And setlynge in the Brigantine, the Uirgyns wonne by force: And clymbynge w? their Mates, the Ship, they take the Sea, perforce. Committyng to the winde, their Sayles, and vsing Shipmens Arte: And actiue diligence: with speede, from shoare, they all departe. Which presently was stoorde with suche, as satsome aide dyd brynge, Unto the captiue Damselles: that for woe, their Ioinctes did wringe. But they cam safe to Th'ile of CREETE, where, of their friendes, they were And kinsmen: Gestwise entertainde, with gentle, curteise cheere. Where at their entre in the Towne, the Belles for ioye were ronge. And thousandes came by heapes to meete, Sir CYMON, and his thronge. And after duetie done, they cryed all, with consentyng voyce: And sayde: The Goddes (Sir CYMON) graunt thee euer to reioyce. And spende the rest of vitall dayes, in heaped store of myrth: Tyll ATROPOS shal cause thy Corse entumbde to lye in earth. For thou haste tasted soppe of gall, before thou dyd obteyne: In hyre of restlesse, tossyng toyle, the longe desired gayne. Where, after fewe dayes spent in sportes and showiyng pleasant playes: And solempne feastes, to mighty MARS for yeldynge happy prayes. They celebrate the Nuptiall ioyes, and wed their wisshed wyues: Enioyng of that rauine myrthe, contynuynge both their lyues. Amongste the RHODIANS, CYPRIANS eke, great discorde did aryse: And troublesome incumbrance spronge twixte them in hatefull wyse. But finally, on eyther parte, entreatie of their feendes: And kynsmens medyacion, tournde their foes obdured mindes. And stablishde then: that (for a tyme, susteyned briefe exyle: And banishment from natyue lande, to last a lytle whyle.) With IPHIGENIA, CYMON should, at CYPRVS Soyle soiourne: And with CASSANDRA home to Rhodes LISYMACHE might returne. Eche to his Countrey backe agayne, in shorte tyme to reuerte: Where, w? their wiues, they lyu'd in ioye with glad and merie hearte: For when the stormes of cancred hate, were ouerblowen and past: And scorneful spight, had spewde his gall on Seas by whyrlynge blaste. And Enuies belching Iawes were stopde by VENVS louynge Boye: And tracte of time, ware out of mynde, all gnawyng cares anoye. And LETHE gulffde in drenchyng brink the death of PASIMONDE: And IPHIGENIA, now dischargde of former vowed bonde. Did yelde at length with willyng mynd, to CYMONS gentel hearte: And by the graunte of wisshed grace, deuorc'de his former smarte. And thus they passde their happy dayes, in neuer diynge blysse: Of whiche, I craue of God, for aye good Ladies neuer misse. FINIS.
