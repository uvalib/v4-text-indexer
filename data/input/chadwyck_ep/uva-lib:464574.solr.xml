      <field name="fulltext">Heyr begynnys the proloug of Virgyll prynce of Latyn poetis in hys twelf bukis of EneadosSquare brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. compilit and translatit furth of Latyn in our Scottis langage by ane right nobill and wirschipfull clerk Master Gawyn Dowglas provest of Sanct Gylys Kyrk in Edinburgh and person of Lyntoun in Louthiane quhilk eftyr was bischop of Dunkeld. Incipit Prologus in Virgilii Eneados Lawd, honour, praysyngis, thankis infynyte To the and thy dulce ornat fresch endyte, Maist reuerend Virgill, of Latyn poetis prynce, Gem of engyne and flude of eloquens, Thow peirless perle, patroun of poetry, Royss, regester, palm, lawrer and glory, Chosyn charbukkill, cheif flour and cedyr tre, Lantarn, laid stern, myrrour and A per se, Maister of masteris, sweit sours and spryngand well Wyde quhar our all rung is thyne hevynly bell— I meyn thy crafty warkis curyus Sa quyk, lusty and maist sentencyus, Plesand, perfyte and feilabill in all degre, As quha the mater beheld tofor thar e, In every volume quhilk the lyst do wryte Surmontyng fer all other maner endyte, Lyke as the royss in Iune with hir sweit smell The maryguld or dasy doith excell. Quhy suld I than with dull forhed and vayn, With rude engyne and barrand emptyve brayn, With bad, harsk spech and lewit barbour tong Presume to write quhar thy sweit bell is rung Or contyrfate sa precyus wordys deir? Na, na, noth swa, but kneill quhen I thame heir. For quhat compair betwix mydday and nycht? Or quhat compair betwix myrknes and lycht? Or quhat compar is betwix blak and quhyte? Far grettar difference betwix my blunt endyte And thy scharp sugurate sang Virgiliane, Sa wysly wrocht with nevir a word invane. My waverand wyt, my cunnyng febill at all, My mynd mysty, thir may nocht myss a fall— Stra for thys ignorant blabryng imperfyte Besyde thy polyst termys redymyte. And netheless with support and correctioun, For naturall lufe and frendely affectioun Quhilkis I beir to thy warkis and endyte— All thocht God wait tharin I knaw full lyte— And that thy facund sentence mycht be song In our langage alsweill as Latyn tong— Alsweill? na, na, impossibill war, per de— ?it with thy leif, Virgile, to follow the, I wald into my rurall wlgar gross Wryte sum savoryng of thyne Eneados. But sair I dreid forto disteyn the quyte Throu my corruppit cadens imperfyte— Disteyn the? nay forsuyth, that may I nocht; Weill may I schaw my burall bustuus thocht Bot thy wark sall endur in lawd and glory But spot or falt condyng etern memory. Thocht I offend, onwemmyt is thy fame; Thyne is the thank and myne salbe the schame. Quha may thy versis follow in all degre In bewtie, sentence and in grauite? Nane is, nor was, ne ?it salbe, trow I, Had, hass or sal haue sic craft in poetry. Of Helicon so drank thou dry the flude That of thy copioss fouth or plenitude All mon purches drynk at thy sugurit tun; So lamp of day thou art and schynand son All otheris on forss mon thar lycht beg or borrow; Thou art Vesper and the day stern at morow, Thow Phebus lightnar of the planetis all— I not quhat dewly I the clepe sall, For thou art all and sum, quhat nedis more, Of Latyn poetis that sens was, or befor. Of the writis Macrobius sans faill In hys gret volume clepit Saturnaill. Thy sawys in sic eloquens doith fleit, So inuentive of rethorik flowris sweit Thou art, and hass so hie profund sentens Tharto, perfyte but ony indigens, That na lovyngis ma do incress thy fame, Nor na reproche dymynew thy gud name. Bot sen I am compellit the to translait, And not only of my curage, God wait, Durst interpryd syk owtrageus foly, Quhar I offend the less reprefe serve I; And that ?e knaw at quhais instans I tuke Forto translait this maist excellent buke, I meyn Virgillis volume maist excellent, Set this my wark full febill be of rent, At the request of a lord of renown Of ancistry nobill and illustir baroun, Fader of bukis, protectour to sciens and lair, My speciall gud Lord Henry, Lord Sanct Clair, Quhilk with gret instance diuerss tymys seir Prayt me translait Virgill or Homeir, Quhais plesour suythly as I vndirstude As neir coniunct to hys lordschip in blude So that me thocht hys request ane command, Half disparit this wark I tuke on hand Nocht fully grantand nor anys sayand ?ee, Bot only to assay quhou it mycht be. Quha mycht gaynsay a lord so gentill and kynd That euer had ony curtasy in thar mynd, Quhilk besyde hys innatyve pollecy Innatyve is alsmekil to say as inborn, or that quhilk cumis till ony person be thar natural inclinatioun of kynd throw thar forbearis. Humanyte, curage, fredome and chevalry, Bukis to recollect, to reid and se, Hass gret delyte as euer had Ptholome? Ptholome kyng of Egipt, the famous gret clerk, astronomer and discryvar of the warld, that causit lxxii interpretouris to translait the Bibill, had sa gret plesour and delyte of bukis that he gadderit togidder in ane librar xxxvi thousand volummys. Quharfor to hys nobilite and estait, Quhat so it be, this buke I dedicait, Writtin in the langage of Scottis natioun, And thus I mak my protestatioun. Fyrst I protest, beaw schirris, be ?our leif, Beis weill avisit my wark or ?he repreif, Consider it warly, reid oftar than anys; Weill at a blenk sle poetry nocht tayn is, And ?it forsuyth I set my bissy pane As that I couth to mak it braid and plane, Kepand na sudron bot our awyn langage, And spekis as I lernyt quhen I was page. Nor ?it sa cleyn all sudron I refuss, Bot sum word I pronunce as nyghtbouris doys: Lyke as in Latyn beyn Grew termys sum, So me behufyt quhilum or than be dum Sum bastard Latyn, French or Inglys oyss Quhar scant was Scottis—I had nane other choys. Nocht for our tong is in the selwyn skant Bot for that I the fowth of langage want Quhar as the cullour of his properte To kepe the sentens tharto constrenyt me, Or than to mak my sayng schort sum tyme, Mair compendyus, or to lykly my ryme. Tharfor, gude frendis, for a gymp or a bourd, I pray ?ou note me nocht at euery word. The worthy clerk hecht Lawrens of the Vaill, Amang Latynys a gret patron sans faill, Grantis quhen twelf ?heris he had beyn diligent To study Virgill, skant knew quhat he ment. Than thou or I, my frend, quhen we best weyn To haue Virgile red, vnderstand and seyn, The rycht sentens perchance is fer to seik. This wark twelf ?heris first was in makyng eyk And nocht correct quhen the poet gan decess; Thus for small faltis, my wyss frend, hald thy pess. Adherdand to my protestatioun, Caxton faltes. Thocht Wil?ame Caxtoun, of Inglis natioun, In proyss hes prent ane buke of Inglys gross, Clepand it Virgill in Eneadoss, Quhilk that he says of Franch he dyd translait, It hass na thing ado tharwith, God wait, Ne na mair lyke than the devill and Sanct Austyne. Haue he na thank tharfor, bot loyss hys pyne, So schamefully that story dyd pervert. I red his wark with harmys at my hart, That syk a buke but sentens or engyne Suldbe intitillit eftir the poet dyvyne; Hys ornate goldyn versis mair than gilt I spittit for dispyte to se swa spilt With sych a wyght, quhilk trewly be myne entent Knew neuer thre wordis at all quhat Virgill ment— Sa fer he chowpis I am constrenyt to flyte. The thre first bukis he hass ourhippyt quyte Salfand a litill twychyng Polidorus And the tempest furth sent by Eolus, And that full sempilly on hys awyn gyss; Virgill thame wrait all on ane other wyss, For Caxton puttis in hys buke owt of toyn The storm furth sent by Eolus and Neptune, Bot quha sa redis Virgill suythfastly Sall fynd Neptune salf Eneas navy. Me lyst nocht schaw quhou thystory of Dydo Be this Caxtoun is haill pervertit so That besyde quhar he fenys to follow Bocass, He rynnys sa fer from Virgill in mony place, On sa prolixt and tedyus fasson, So that the ferd buke of Eneadon, Twichand the lufe and ded of Dido queyn, The twa part of his volume doith conteyn That in the text of Virgill, trastis me, The twelt part scars contenys, as ?e may se. The fyfte buke of the festis funerall, The lusty gamys and plays palustrall, That is ourhippit quyte and left behynd— Na thing tharof ?he sall in Caxtoun fynd. The saxt buke eyk, he grantis, that wantis haill, And, for tharof he vnderstude nocht the taill, He callis it fen?eit and nocht forto beleif; Sa is all Virgill perchans, for by hys leif Iuno nor Venus goddessis neuer wer, Mercur, Neptune, Mars nor Iupiter; Of Fortune eik nor hir necessite, Sik thingis nocht attentik ar, wait we, Nor ?it admittis that quent philosophy Haldis sawlys hoppys fra body to body, And mony thingis quhilkis Virgill dyd reherss, Thocht I thame write furthfollowand hys verss. Nor Caxtoun schrynkis nocht siclyke thingis to tell As nocht war fabill bot the passage to hell, Bot trastis weill, quha that ilke saxt buke knew, Virgill tharin ane hie philosophour hym schew, Vnder derk poetrye is hid gret wisdome and lerning. And vnder the clowdis of dyrk poecy Hyd lyis thar mony notabill history— For so the poetis be the crafty curys In similitudes and vndir quent figuris The suythfast materis to hyde and to constreyn; All is nocht fals, traste weill, in cace thai feyn. Thar art is so to mak thar warkis fair, As in the end of Virgill I sall declair. Was it nocht eik als possibill Eneas As Hercules or Theseus tyll hell to pass, Quhilk is na gabbyng suythly nor na lie, As Ihone Bocas in the Genealogie Of Goddys declarys, and lyke as ?he may reid In the Recolles of Troy quha lest tak hed. Quha wait gyf he in visioun thydder went By art magike, socery or enchantment, And with hys fader sawle dyd speke and meyt, Or in the lyknes with sum other spreit, Lyke as the spreit of Samuell, I gess, Thistory of Saul and the spreit of Samuel rasyt by the Phitones is in the first Buk of Kyngis, in the xxviii c. Raysit to Kyng Saul was by the Phitones? I will nocht say all Virgill beyn als trew Bot at syk thyngis ar possibill this I schew, Als in tha days war ma illusionys By dewillich warkis and coniurations Than now thar beyn, so doith clerkis determ, For blissit be God, the faith is now mair ferm. Enewch tharof; now will I na mor sayn Bot onto Caxtoun thus I turn agane. The namys of pepill or citeis beyn so bad Put by this Caxtoun that, bot he had beyn mad, The flude of Touyr for Tibir he had nocht write: All men may knaw thar he forvayt quyte. Palente the cite of Evander kyng, As Virgill playnly makis rehersyng, Stude quhar in Rome now stant the cheif palyce; This sam buke eyk in mair hepit malyce On the self ryver of Touyr says playnly Eneas dyd hys cyte edify. Thus ay for Tibir Touyr puttis he, Quhilk mony hundreth mylis syndry be, For sykkyrly, less than wyss authoris leyn, Ene saw nevir Touyr with hys eyn, For Touyr diuidis Grece from Vngary And Tibir is cheif flude of Italy, Touyr is kend a grayn of that ryver In Latyn hecht Danubium or Hyster— Of gyf it be Tanais he clepis sa, That flude diuidis Europ from Asia. In lyke wyss eik this Caxtoun all invane Crispina clepis Sibilla Cumane, That in the text of Virgill, trastis ws, Hait Deiphebe douchtir of Glawcus, Quhilk was Eneas convoyar to hell. Quhat suld I langar on hys errouris dwell? Thai beyn so playn and eik sa monyfald The hundreth part tharof I leif ontald. The last sax bukis of Virgill all inferis, Quhilk contenys strang batalis and werys, This ilk Caxtoun so blaitly lattis ourslip I hald my tung for schame, bytand my lyp. The gret afferis of athir host and array, The armour of Eneas, fresch and gay, The quent and curyus castis poeticall, Perfyte symylitudis and exemplis all Quharin Virgill beris the palm of lawd, Caxtoun, for dreid thai suld hys lippis scald, Durst nevir twich. Thus schortly for the nanys. A twenty devill way fall hys wark atanys, Quhilk is na mair lyke Virgill, dar I lay, Than the nycht owle resemblis the papyngay. Quharfor, ?ou gentill redaris, I besich Exhortatione to the Reder. Traste on na wyss at this my wark be sich, Quhilk dyd my best, as the wyt mycht atteyn, Virgillis versys to follow and no thing feyn. ?he worthy noblys, redis my wark for thy And cast this other buke on syde far by, Quhilk vndir cullour of sum strange Franch wycht So Franchly leys, oneith twa wordis gais rycht. I nold ?he trast I said this for dispyte, For me lyst with nane Inglis bukis flyte, Na with na bogill nor browny to debait, Nowder ald gaistis nor spretis ded of lait, Nor na man will I lakkyn nor dispyss My warkis till authorys be sik wyss, Bot twichyng Virgillis honour and reuerens, Quha euer contrary, I mon stand at defens; And bot my buke be fundyn worth sik thre Quhen it is red, do warp it in the see, Thraw it in the fyre or rent it euery crum. Twichand that part, lo, heir is all and sum. Syne I defend and forbiddis euery wight Admonitione vnto vnlerned peopill, quhase rudnes can nocht onderstand Vyrgill. That can nocht spell thar Pater Noster rycht Fortill correct or ?it amend Virgill, Or the translatar blame in hys wlgar stile; I knaw quhat payn was to follow hym fut hait Albeit thou think my sayng intricate. Traste weill to follow a fixt sentens or mater Is mair practike, deficill and far strater, Thocht thyne engyne beyn eleuate and hie, Than forto write all ways at liberte. Gif I had nocht be to a boundis constrenyt, Of my bad wyt perchance I couth haue fenyt In ryme a ragment twyss als curyus, Bot nocht be twenty part so sentencyus. Quha is attachit ontill a staik, we se, May go na ferthir bot wreil about that tre: Rycht so am I to Virgillis text ybund, I may nocht fle less than my falt be fund, For thocht I wald transcend and go besyde, Hys wark remanys, my schame I may nocht hyde. And thus I am constrenyt als neir I may To hald hys verss and go nane other way, Less sum history, subtell word or the ryme Causith me mak digressioun sum tyme. So thocht in my translatioun eloquens skant is, Na lusty cast of oratry Virgill wantis; My studyus brayn to comprehend his sentens Leit me nevir taist hys flude of eloquens. And thus forsuyth becauss I was nocht fre, My werk is mair obscur and gross per de, Quharof, God wait, Virgill hass na wyte— Thocht myne be blunt, hys text is maist perfyte. And ?it persave I weill, be my consait The kyng of poetis ganys nocht for rurall estait Nor hys fresch memor for bowbardis; he or scho Quha takis me nocht go quhar thai haue ado— The sonnys lycht is neuer the wers, traste me, All thocht the bak hys brycht bemys doith fle. Greyn gentill ingynys and breistis curageus, Sik ar the pepill at ganys best for ws; Our werk desiris na lewyt rebalddaill, Full of nobilite is thistory all haill. For euery vertu belangand a nobill man This ornate poet bettir than ony can Payntand discryvis in person of Eneas— Not forto say sikane Eneas was ?it than by hym perfytely blasons he All wirschip, manhed and nobilite, With euery bonte belangand a gentill wycht, Ane prynce, ane conquerour or a val?eand knycht. In luffis cuyr eneuch heir sall ?he fynd, And schortly Virgill left na thing behynd That mycht hys volume illummyn or crafty mak. Reid quha hym knawys, I dar this vndertak, Als oft as ?e hym reid, full weill I wait, ?he fynd ilke tyme sum mery new consait. Thoght venerabill Chauser, principal poet but peir, Hevynly trumpat, orlege and reguler, In eloquens balmy, cundyt and dyall, Mylky fontane, cleir strand and royss ryall, Of fresch endyte, throu Albion iland braid, In hys legend of notabill ladeis said That he couth follow word by word Virgill, Wisar than I may faill in lakar stile. Sum tyme the text mon haue ane expositioun, Sum tyme the collour will causs a litill additioun, And sum tyme of a word I mon mak thre, In witnes of this term “oppetere.” Oppetere is alsmekil to say as ore terram petere, lyke as Seruius exponys the sammyn term, quhilk to translate in our tung is with mowth to seik or byte the erd. And lo, that is ane hail sentens for ane of Virgillis wordis. Eik weill I wait syndry expositouris seir Makis on a text sentens diuerss to heir, As thame apperis, accordyng thar entent, And for thar part schawis ressonys euident. All this is ganand, I will weill it swa be, Bot a sentens to follow may suffice me. Sum tyme I follow the text als neir I may, Sum tyme I am constrenyt ane other way. Besyde Latyn our langage is imperfite Quhilk in sum part is the causs and the wyte Quhy that of Virgillis verss the ornate bewte Intill our tung may nocht obseruyt be, For thar be Latyn wordis mony ane That in our leyd ganand translatioun hass nane Less than we mynyss thar sentens and grauyte And ?it scant weill exponyt. Quha trewys nocht me, Lat thame interprit “animal” and “homo” As for animal and homo in our langage is nocht a propir term, and thai be bot bestis that exponys animal for a beste. Ane beste is callit in Latyn bestia and pecus, and animal betakynnys all corporall substans that hass ane saull quhilk felis payn, ioy or ennoy. And vndyr animal beyn contenyt all mankynd, beist, byrd, fowll, fisch, serpent, and all other sik thingis at lyfis and steris, that hass a body, for al sik and euery ane of thame may be properly callit animal. And thus animal is ane general name for al sik maner thingis quhatsumeuer. Homo betakynnys baith a man and a woman, and we haue na term correspondent tharto, nor ?it that signifyis baith twa in a term alanerly. With many hundreth other termys mo Quhilkis in our langage suythly as I weyn Few men can tell me cleirly quhat thai meyn. Betweyn “genus,” “sexus” and “species” Genus is that thing quhilk is common and may be verefyt of mony other thingis different in kynd or of diuerss kyndis; as this word, a beste, may be verefeit and is common till al and syndry kynd of bestis, for a horss is a beste, ane ox a beste, a scheip a beste, a dog a beste, and swa of otheris. Species is that thing or word that is common and may be verefeit of mony thingis different in numbir, as this word, a man, may be verefeit and is common till al maner of man particular, for Iohne is a man, Thomas a man, Wil?am a man, and furth of otheris. Syk lyke, this word, a horss, is common to this horss, and that horss—the gray is a horss, the blak a horss, the quhite a horss. Sexus is the discretioun, diuersitie or differens in schap, betwix the mail and the female in al maner corporal creatouris, for thocht a man and a woman beyn baith of a kynd and natur, ?it ar thai different and diuerss in thar schap. Rycht swa is ane horss fra a mair, quhilk ar bath of a kynd; siklyke a cok from a hen, a kow from a bull, and swa is of all kyndis quhar the mail is distinct fra the femell. Diuersyte in our leid to seik I cess. For “obiectum” or “subiectum” alsswa He war expert couth fynd me termys twa, Quhilkis ar als ryfe amangis clerkis in scuyll As evir fowlis plungit in laik or puyll. Logicianys knawys heirin myne entent, Vndir quhais boundis lurkis mony strange went Quharof the process as now we mon lat be. Bot ?it twychyng our tungis penuryte, I meyn into compar of fair Latyn That knawyn is maste perfite langage fyne, I mycht also percace cum lyddir speid For “arbor” and “lignum” intill our leid To fynd different proper termys twane And tharto put circumlocutioun nane. Richt so by aboutspech oftyn tymys And semabill wordis we compile our rymys. God wait in Virgill ar termys mony a hundir Fortill expone maid me a felloun blundir. To follow alanerly Virgilis wordis, I weyn, Thar suld few vndirstand me quhat thai meyn. The bewte of his ornate eloquens May nocht al tyme be kepit with the sentens. Sanct Gregor eik forbyddis ws to translait Word eftir word bot sentence follow algait: “Quha haldis,” quod he, “of wordis the properteis Full oft the verite of the sentens fleys.” And to the sammyn purpos we may apply Horatius in hys Art of Poetry: “Press nocht,” says he, “thou traste interpreter, Word eftir word to translait thi mater.” Lo, he reprevis and haldis myssemyng Ay word by word to reduce ony thing. I say nocht this of Chauser for offens, Bot till excuss my lewyt insufficiens, For as he standis beneth Virgill in gre, Vndir hym alsfer I grant my self to be. And netheless into sum place, quha kend it, My mastir Chauser gretly Virgill offendit. All thoch I be tobald hym to repreif, He was fer baldar, certis, by hys leif, Sayand he followit Virgillis lantern toforn, Quhou Eneas to Dydo was forsworn. Was he forsworn? Than Eneas was fals— That he admittis and callys hym traytour als. Thus, wenyng allane Ene to haue reprevit, He hass gretly the prynce of poetis grevit, For, as said is, Virgill dyd diligens But spot of cryme, reproch or ony offens Eneas for to loif and magnyfy, And gif he grantis hym maynsworn fowlely, Than all hys cuyr and crafty engyne gais quyte, Hys twelf ?heris laubouris war nocht worth a myte. Certis Virgill schawys Ene dyd na thing This argument excusis nocht the tratory of Eneas na his maynsweryng, considering quhat is said heir afoir in the ii c. of this prolog, that is, Iuno nor Venus goddes neuer war, Mercur, Neptun, Mars nor Iupiter, Of Forton eik, nor his necessite, Sic thingis nocht attentik ar, wait we. It followis than that Eneas vroucht nocht be command of ony goddis, bot of his awyn fre wyl, be the permission of God, quhilk sufferis al thing, and stoppis nocht, na puttis nocht necessite to fre wyll. He falit than gretly to the sueit Dydo, quhilk falt reprefit nocht the goddess diuinite, for thai had na diuinite, as said is befoir. From Dydo of Cartage at hys departyng Bot quhilk the goddis commandit hym beforn, And gif that thar command maid hym maynsworn, That war repreif to thar diuinyte And na reproch onto the said Enee. Als in the first, quhar Ilioneus Spekis to the queyn Dido, says he nocht thus, That curss by fait was set tyll Italy? Thus mycht scho not pretend na iust causs quhy Thocht Troianys eftir departis of Cartage, Sen thai befor declaryt hir thar vayage. Reid the ferd buke quhar Queyn Dido is wraith, Heir he argouis better than befoir. Thar sal ?he fynd Ene maid nevir aith, Promyt nor band with hir fortill abyde: Thus hym tobe maynsworn may nevir betyde, Nor nane onkyndnes schew forto depart At the bydding of Iove with reuthfull hart, Sen the command of God obey suld all And vndir his charge na wrangwyss deid may fall. Bot sikkyrly or resson me behufis Excuss Chauser fra all maner repruffis In lovyng of thir ladeis lylly quhite He set on Virgill and Eneas this wyte, For he was evir (God wait) all womanis frend. I say na mair, but, gentil redaris heynd, Lat all my faltis with this offens pass by. Thou prynce of poetis, I the mercy cry, I meyn thou Kyng of Kyngis, Lord Etern, Thou be my muse, my gydar and laid stern, Remittyng my trespass and euery myss Throu prayer of thy Moder, Queyn of Blyss. Afald godhed, ay lestyng but discrepans, In personys thre, equale, of a substans, On the I call, and Mary Virgyn myld— Calliope nor payane goddis wild May do to me na thing bot harm, I weyn: In Criste is all my traste, and hevynnys queyn. Thou, Virgyn Moder and Madyn, be my muse, That nevir ?it na synfull lyst refuss Quhilk the besocht deuotly for supple. Albeit my sang to thy hie maieste Accordis nocht, ?it condiscend to my write, For the sweit liqour of thy pappis quhite Fosterit that Prynce, that hevynly Orpheus, Grond of all gude, our Saluyour Ihesus. Bot forthirmor, and lawar to discend Forgeif me, Virgill, gif I the offend. Pardon thy scolar, suffir hym to ryme Sen thou was bot ane mortal man sum tyme. In cace I faill, haue me not at disden?e, Thocht I be lewit, my leill hart can nocht fen?e, I sall the follow; suld I tharfor haue blame, Quha can do bettir, sa furth in Goddis name. I schrynk nocht anys correkkit for tobe With ony wight grundit on cherite, And glaidly wald I baith inquire and leir And till ilke cunnand wight la to myne eyr. But laith me war but owther offens or cryme Ane brimell body suld intertrike my ryme. Thocht sum wald swer that I the text haue vareit, Or that I haue this volume quyte myscareit, Or threpe playnly that I come nevir neir hand it, Or at the wark is wers than evir I fand it, Or ?it argue Virgill stude weill befor, As now war tyme to schift the werst our scor; Ellis haue I said thar may be na compar Betwix his versis and my stile wlgar. All thocht he stant in Latyn maist perfyte, ?it stude he nevir weill in our tung endyte Less than it be by me now at this tyme. Gyf I haue fal?eit, baldly reprufe my ryme. Bot first, I pray ?ou, grape the mater cleyn, Reproche me nocht quhill the wark be ourseyn. Beis not ourstudyus to spy a moyt in myne e, That in ?our awyn a ferry boyt can nocht se, And do to me as ?he wald be done to. Now hark, schirris, thar is na mair ado; Quha list attend, gevis audiens and draw neir, Me thocht Virgill begouth on this maner: I the ilk vmquhile that in the small ait reid Tonyt my sang, syne fra the woddis ?eid And feildis about taucht tobe obesand (Thocht he war gredy) to the bissy husband, Ane thankfull wark maid for the plewchmanis art, Bot now the horribill stern dedys of Mart, The batalys and the man I will discryve. &amp;c The Contentis of Euery Buke Followyng The first contenys quhou the prynce Ene And Troianys war dryve onto Cartage cite. The secund buke schawis the finale ennoy, The gret myscheif and subuersioun of Troy. The thryd tellith quhou fra Troys cite The Troianys careit war throu owt the see. The ferd rehersis of fair Queyn Dido The dowbill woundis and the mortale wo. The fyft contenys funerale gemys glaid And how the fyre the navy dyd invaid. Into the saxt buke syne doith Virgill tell Quhou that Eneas went and visseit hell. The sevynt Ene bryngis to hys grond fatale, And how Italianys Troianys schup to assale. Ontill Eneas gevis the auchten buke Baith falloschip and armour, quha list luke. Dawnus son Turnus in the nynte, tak tent, Segis New Troy, Eneas tho absent. The tent declaris by the cost atanys The batale betwix Tuscanys and Rutulanys. In the ellevynt Rutulyanys beyn ourset By the decess of Camylla downebet. The twelft makis end of all the weir, but dowt, Throu the slauchtir of Turnus, stern and stowt. The last, ekit to Virgillis nowmyr evyn By Mapheus, convoys Ene to hevyn. The Rubric in the Formast Cheptour of the First Buke The poet first proponyng his entent Declaris Iunois wreth and mailtalent. The batalis and the man I wil discrive Virgille reherssis not Eneas naim, bot callis him “the man” be excellens, as thocht he said “the mast soueran man.” Fra Troyis boundis first that fugitive By fait to Ytail come and cost Lavyne, Lavyn, Lavinium, Lawrentum stud viii mylis fra the mowth of Tibyr, and was cyte of the king Latynus, of quham eftyr in the vii buyk, quhill the end of this volume.

Lo quhou gret cure, quhat travell, pane and dowt Was to begyn the worthy Romanys blude! And as the Troianys frakkis our the flude, “And as the Troianys, &amp;c.” First abuyf the poete proponis his entent, sayand, “The batellis and the man, &amp;c.”; nyxt makis he inoucation, calland on his muse to tech hym thar, “O thou my Muse, &amp;c.”; and ther, lyke as his muse spak to hym, declaris the caussis of the feid of Iuno, sayand, “Ther was ane anchient cyte hecht Cartage.” Now heir thridly proceidis he furth on his narration and history, and beginnys at the sevint ?eir of Eneas departyng of Troy, as ?e may se in the end of this first buyk, and efter the decess of his fadir Anchises, quham he erdit in Sycill at Drepanon, as ?e haf in the end of the thrid buyk. The remanent of his auenturis beyn reseruyt, be craft of poetry, to the banket of Queyn Dido, quhar thai be then lenth rehersit by Eneas in the secund and thryd. Skarss from the sycht of Sysilly the land, With bent sail full, rycht merely saland, Thar stevynnys scowrand fast throu the salt fame, Quhen that Iuno, till hir euerlestand schame, The etern wound hyd in hir breist ay greyn, Ontill hir self thus spak in propir teyn: “Is this ganand that I my purposs faill As clene ourcum, and may nocht from Itaill Withhald this kyng of Troy and hys navy?

This offence was the ravising of Cassandra furth of the tempill of Pallas, as ?e haue in the vij cheptour of the secund buke following. And sum says this Aiax oppressit hir in the tempill; quhilk Aiax was son to Kyng Oylus, prince of Locria, or Locrida, and his pepyll beyn nammyt Locri or Locranys.

And ferther as twychyng this Iuno, hir other namys and proprieteis, I refer to Iohn Bocass in the Genealogy of gentille Goddis, onto the nynt buyk thereof, and first c. of the sammyn. With a pepill sa feill ?heris weir sall lede, Quha sal from thens adorn in ony stede The power of Iuno, or altaris sacryfy, Gif I ourcummyn be thus schamefully?” Quhou Dame Iuno tyll Eolus cuntre went And of the storm on the Troianys furth sent. And on this wyss, wyth hart byrnyng as fyre, Musyng alone, full of malyce and ire, Tyll Eolus cuntre, that wyndy regioune, The cuntre or realm of Eolus, clepit Eolia, lyis betwix Sycill and Italy, vii ilandis in the sey, of quham thir be the namys: Lipara, Hiera, Strogile, Didyme, Eriphusa, Phenycusa and Evomynos. And for alsmekyll as thir ilis bein full of cavernys, wyth bryntstan blawand and byrnand onder the erd, that therby throw the swouch of the fir may be persauyt a day or twa befor fra quhat part or art the wynd is fortocum; and this Eolus kyng therof, as an naturall man, first be experiens persauyt this, and wald schaw the pepill therby, weill two or thre dais befor, the wynd was to blaw from syk an art, for the quhilk rayson, with the rud pepill, was he nammyt kyng or god of windis. And thai put that he had vi sonnys and vi dochtiris, quhilkis ar nocht ellis bot the xii wyndis, of quham the [namys], to begin at the est and go round abowt, bein thir: Subsolanus, Ewrus, Nothus, Auster, Affricus, ?ephyrus, Fauonius, Circius, Chorus, Boreas, Aquilo and Wlturnus. A brudy land of furyus stormy sowne, This goddis went, quhar Eolus the kyng In gowsty cavys the wyndis lowde quhissilling And braithly tempestis by hys power refrenys, In bandis hard schet in presoun constrenys, And thai heirat havand full gret disdeyn, Quhill all the hill resoundis, quhryne and plene About thar closouris brayng with mony a rare.

To quham as than lawly thus Iuno said: “Eolus, a pepill onto me ennemy Salis the sey Tuscane, cariand to Italy Thar venquyst hamehald goddis and Ilion; Ilion, or Ilium, was the cyte of Troy, havand his naym fra King Ilus, fadir to Laomedon.

And thus heir the thre principall gret windis contrarius blew attanys apon thaim, and the north wind also in the nyxt c., “A blastirrand bub owt from the north braying &amp;c.” Quhilkis est, south and west wyndis hait with ws.

Quhou that Ene was with the tempest schaik And quhou Neptune his navy salvyt fra wraik. Belive Eneas membris schuk for cald, (1) Her fyrst namys Virgill Eneas. (2) This cald, sais Seruyus, coym of dreid; nocht that Eneas dred the ded, bot this maner of ded; and alsso he that dredis na thyng, nor kan haf na dred, is not hardy, but fuyll hardy and beistly. And murnand baith his handis vp did hald Towart the sternys, with petuus voce thus gan say: “O sevin tymys quhou happy and blissit war thai Vnder hie wallis of Troy, by dynt of swerd, Deit in thar faderis syght, bytand the erd!

Quhy mycht I not on feldis of Troy haue deit And by thi rycht hand ?aldin forth my sprete Quhar that the valiant Hectour losit the swete On Achillis speir, and grisly Sarpedon, Sarpedon, son of Iupiter and Laodomya, dochtyr to Bellerophon, was kyng of Lycia; of huge statur, and slan by Patroclus. And ondyr flude Symois mony one With scheld and helm stalwart bodeis lyis warpit?” And al invane thus quhil Eneas carpit, A blastrand bub out from the north brayng Gan our the forschip in the baksaill dyng, And to the sternys vp the flude gan cast. The aris, hechis and the takillis brast, The schippis stevin frawart hyr went gan wryth, And turnyt hir braid syde to the wallis swyth.

And thir schald bankis of sand heir nammyt bein the twa dangeris of the sey Affrican, callit Syrtis, the mair and the less; mar perellus than ?airmuth sandis or Holland cost. And othir thre Eurus from the deip wallis Cachit amang the schald bankis of sand— Dolorus to se thame chop on grond, and stand Lyke as a wall with sand warpit about. Ane othir, in quham salit the Lycianys stowt, Quhilum fallowis to Kyng Pandor in weir, And Orontes, Eneas fallow deir, Off Orontes and Lewcaspis sum thing in the v c. of the vi buyk, and of this Pander or Pandarus in the ix c. of the v buyk. Befor his eyn from the north wynd Ane hydduuss sey schippit at hir stern behynd, Smate furth the skippar clepit Lewcaspis, His hed doune warpit, and the schip with this Thryss thar the flude quhirlit about round, The swokand swelth sank vnder sey and drond. On the huge deip quhoyn salaris dyd appeir; The Troianys armour, takillis and othir geir Flet on the wallis; and the strang barge tho Bair Ilioneus, and scho that bair also Of this Ilioneus and the otheris Troianys heir nammyt beyn oft benath maid mension. Forcy Achates, and scho that bair Abas, And scho quharin ancyant Alethes was, The storm ourset, raif rovis and syde semmys— Thai all lekkit, the salt watir stremmys Fast bullerand in at euery ryft and boyr. In the meyn quhile, with mony rowt and royr The sey thus trublit, and this tempest furth sent Felt Neptune, and his watir movit and schent, Neptun or Neptunus, brother to Iove and Pluto and son to Saturn. For that the partis of his heritage lay in Creit by the sey cost, and for he vsit mekill salyng and rowyng, and fand the craft or art therof, therfor is he clepit god of the sey. He was alsswa an the first tawcht to dant and taym horsss; and onto hym beyn consecret the fundment of wallis, for alsmekill as it is said he biggyt the wallis of Troy, or than becauss the watyr inclusyt ondyr the erth is oft tymys causs of erdqwkyng and trimbillyng or moving of the erth, as we se by experiens in watyr brekis. And perchanss thir thre poweris signefeis the thre granyt ceptour, quhilk his statw in ald days bair in hand, lyk a crepar or a graip wyth thre granys. Tha discryve hym rydand in a cart, quhilk betakinnys the weltyng our of the sey wallys, that rollys, hurlys and brais lyke cart quhelis. Quha lykis mair of him, go reid Bocas, in the first c. and tent buyk of the Genealogy of Goddis. The deip furth?et in schaldis heir and thair. Gretly commovit, out of the sey gan stair His plesand hede, rasit on the hyast wall, Lukand about, behaldis the sey our all Eneas navy skatterit fer ysundir, With fludis ourset the Troianys and at vnder By flaggis and rayn dyd from the hevin discend: Iunois dissate and ire full weill he kend. He callis till hym Eurus and ?ephirus, Tha est and west wyndis, and said thame thus: “Ar ?e sa gretly assurit in ?our hie kyn, ?e wyndis,” quod he, “but my leif durst begyn Baith erd and ayr to move on this maneir And eik the sey with sa stowt stormys steir?

Hys douchter Cymothoe and hys son Tryton Cymothoe, as sais Seruyus, is in Grew alss mekyll to say in our language as the flowand or rinnand flud, quhilk may be clepit a ganand dochtir to Neptun, god of seys. Tryton, as sais Bocas, is the bruyt or rowtyng of the wally sey: quharfor iustly is he fen?eit trumpet to the occian and son to Neptun. Netheless, Plynyus in his Naturall History reherssis that Triton is a verray monstre of the sey, and that in the tym of Tyberius the emperour syk an was hard and seyn. His schap and portatour is discryvit in the x buyk in the iiii c., and he slais Mesenus in the iii c. of the vi buyk. Enforsis thame the Troianys schippis onone To rayss and lift of the scharp rolkis blynd; The god hym self gan hesyng thame behynd With his byg ceptour havand granys thre, Oppynnys schald sandis and temperis weill the see, Ourslidand lychtly the croppis of the wallis. And as ?e se, oft amangis commonys fallis Noyte Virgill in this comparison and symilytud, for therin and in syk lyke baris he the palm of lawd, as I haf said in my proheme. It is to be considderit alsso that our all this wark, he comparis batell tyll spayt or dyluge of watyr, or than to suddan fyr, and to nocht ellis. Stryfe and debait in thar wod fulych ire, Now fleys the stanys and now the broyndis of fyre (Thar greif and fury mynysteris wapynnys plente), Bot than percace gif thai behald or se Sum man of gret autorite and efferis, Thai cess and, all stil standand, gevis him eris; He wyth his wordis gan slaik thar mynd and swage. On the sammyn wyss fell all the seys rage. Cristoferus Landynus, that writis moraly apon Virgill, says thus: Eneas purposis to Italy, his land of promyssion; that is to say, a iust perfyte man entendis to mast soueran bonte and gudnes, quhilk as witnessyth Plato, is situate in contemplation of godly thyngis or dyvyn warkis. His onmeysabill ennymy Iuno, that is fen?eit queyn of realmys, entendis to dryve him from Italle to Cartage; that is, Avesion, or concupissence to ryng or haf warldly honouris, wald draw him fra contemplation to the actyve lyve; quhilk, quhen scho falis by hir self, tretis scho with Eolus, the neddyr part of raison, quhilk sendis the storm of mony warldly consalis in the iust manis mynd. Bot, quhoubeyt the mynd lang flowis and delitis heirintyll, fynaly by the fre wyll and raison predomynent, that is, ondirstand, by Neptun, the storm is cessit, and, as followis in the nyxt c., arryvit in sond havin, quhilk is tranquilite of consciens; and fynaly Venus, in the vi c. following, schawis Ene his feris recouerit again, quhilk is, fervent lufe and cherite schawis the iust man his swete meditationys and feruour of deuotion, quham he tynt by warldly curis, restorit to hym again, and all his schippis bot on, be quham I ondyrstand the tyme lost. Quhou Eneas in Affrik dyd arryve, And thar with schote slew sevin hartis belyve. Eftyr that the fader of the fludys Neptune Had on sik wyss behaldyn the seys abone, Vndir the stabillit hevin movit in his chare, Slakking his ren?eis with prosper courss and fair, Eneas and his feris on the strand Wery and forwrocht sped thame to the nerrest land, And at the cost of Lyby arryvit he. Ane havyn place with a lang hals or entre Thar is, with ane ile enveronyt on athir part, To brek the wallis and storm of euery art; Within the watir in a bosum gays. Baith heir and thair stant large craggis and brais.

Bot thai bein taken wyth poetis for goddessis of woddis, wildirness, fludis or wellis, and Nympha is a generall naym to all syk. Nymphis of wellis bein callit Naydes; of hillis or montanys, Oreades; of woddis and forestis, Dryades; of salt fludis, Nereides; of flouris, Napee; and Hamadriades ar fen?eit to grow and de wyth the tre, as quha wald say the sawll of the tre. Perbrakit schippis but cabillis thar mycht ryde, Nane ankyr nedis mak thame arest nor byde. Of all his navy thidder Eneas brocht Bot sevin schippis. With gret desyre and thocht Tobe on grund, Troianys sped thame to land, As thai desyrit set softly on the sand; Thare lethis and lymmys in salt watir bedyit Strekit on the cost, spred furth, bekit and dryit. Bot first Achates slew fyre of the flynt Keppit in dry leiffis as tunder, quhil thai brynt; Syne stikkis dry to kyndil thar about laid is, Quhil al in flambe the bless of fyre vp bradis. Than was the quhete (with fludis chaffit and wet) And instrumentis to purge it swith out set. For skant of vittal, the cornys in quernys of stane Thai grand, and syne buke at the fyre ilkane. In the meyn quhile, Eneas the bank on hie ?e sall ondirstand Virgill in all partis of his prosess, quhat maner or fasson he discrivis ony man at the begynnyng, sa continewys he of that samin person all thro, and Eneas in all his wark secludis from all vylle offyce; bot as twychand materris of pyety or devotion, thar labowris he euer wyth the first, as ?e may se in the beginyng of the vi buke. Has clummyn, widequhar behaldand the large see Gif ony schip thar on mycht be persavit Quhilk lait tofor the wyndis had bewavit, Or ony Troiane galay, bark or barge, Antheus, Capis or Caicus stremeris large Wavand or schawand from thar top on hycht. Na schip he saw, bot sone he gat a syght Of thre hartis waverand by the cost syde, Thocht sum wald say, perchans, that in Affrik bein na hartis, therto answeris Landinus that, albeit perchans now ther be nain, in tha days tha war not to seyk, or thocht in the ferther partis of Affrik be nain, in the hiddir partis, quharto was Eneas dryve, ther beyn mony. Quham at the bak, throu out the gravis wide, The mekil herdis followit in a rowt And pasturit all the large valle about. Tharat he styntis and hynt his bow in hand; Swift fleand arowis fast by him had berand The traist Achates; and first the ledaris thre, or gydaris. Quhilk on thar hedis bair the tyndis hie, Smertly he slew, syne al the rangald persewis With grundyn arowis amang the thik wod bewis, And styntis not with dartis thame to bete Quhil he to grond had brocht sevin hartis grete, And with his schippis thar nowmyr equale maid.

The wyne thar with in veschell gret and small, Quhilk til him gave Acestes, his ryall host, Acestes, kyng of Sycilly; of quham in the first c. of the thrid buke.

Hys feris has this praye ressauyt raith And to thar met addressis, it to graith, Hynt of the hydis, maid the bowkis bair, Rent furth the entralis, sum in tail?eis schare, Syne brochit flykerand, sum gobbettis of lyre Kest in caldronys, and othir sum bet the fyre; Thame to refresch thus all the cost on lenth Sped thame with fude to recover thar strenth, On the greyn gers sat doune, and fillit thaim syne Of fat venyson and nobill auld wyne.

Quhen hungir thus with metis was chasit away And dischis drawin, than with lang sermond thai Bewalit thar feris lossit on the flude: Betwix gude hope and dreid in dowt thai stude Quhidder thai war levand or tholit extreme ded all; Thai answer nocht set thai oft pleyn and call. Bot principally the pietefull Eneas Regratis oft the hard fortoune and cace Of stern Orontes new drownyt in the sey, And now Amycus harm complenys he, Now hym alone the cruel fate of Lycus, Now strang Gyan, now stalwart Cloanthus. Quhou Iove beheld the large costis on fer And how Venus carpis with Iupiter. Gone was the day and all thar lang sermoun Quhen Iupiter, from his heich speir, adoun Iove or Iupiter by the gentillis was clepit the mast soueran god, fader of goddis and men, and all the otheris war bot haldyn as poweris dyuerss of this Iupiter, callit “iuuans pater,” the helply fadir; bot quham we cleip swa I haf writyn in my proloug of the x buyk. Of Iupiter, as writis Sanct Augustyn in his volume clepit the Cyte of God, in the vii buke and ix c. therof, thus writis poetis: Iupiter omnipotens, regum rex ipse, deusque, Progenitor genitrixque deum, deus vnus, et omnes. “Iupiter omnipotent, king of kingis, and god, fader and moder of goddis, an god, and all the goddis.” Of him largly spekis he alsswa, reprevand the gentile opinionys, in the sam volum, in the first buk and xi c. therof; and in the xii c. repreuys the opynion of Plato, that haldis God the sawll of the warld. Of Iupiter sais the poet Lucan: Iupiter est quodcunque vides, quocunque moueris. “Iupiter is all that euer thou seis, and all that euer movis.” Bot quhou ther beyn thre syndry Iupiteris, reid Iohn Bocas in his Genealogy of Goddis, in the first c. of the xi buyk, quhar he tretis of Iupiter, kyng of Crete, quhilk was Iupiter the thrid; and ther at the full of all the fiction and fabillis therof, and quhy he is clepit gret god, and of this Iupiter in the recollectis of Troy. Of the secund Iupiter, kyng of Archad and syne of Athenes, quhilk slew Lycaon and was fadyr to Dardanus, of quham cam the Troianys, he writis in the first c. of his v buyk. And of Iupiter the first, callit Lysanyan, and kyng Athenes, in the ii c. of his ii buke, quhar he tretis the proprieteis of Iupiter the planeyt. And now to speyk of Iupiter the planete, quhilk is secund in ordour, and vnermaste nyxt Saturn. He is gentyll and meyk, and full of gud influens, and profitabill aspectis, in sa fer that gif he conionys with a frawart planete, sik as Mars or Saturn, he meysis ther wreth. Gif he conionys with a meyn planete, as the Sone, the Moyn or Mercury, he drawis thaim and makis inclyn to his gudness. Quhen he conionys wyth Venus, or is participant wyth her, as he stud in the ascendent at this tym of Eneas landyng, quhilk is fen?eit the commonyng betwix hym and Venus, than, as heir apperis, batakynnys all gud; for Iove is clepit “Fortuna maior,” and Venus “Fortuna minor.” He completis his curss in xii ?eris, and by this constylation betwix him and Venus, Seruius ondirstandis felicite tocum be a woman, as followis be Dido. And that Venus was sorofull, that is to knaw, discendent, and nocht in hir strength, signifeis the sorofull departyng and myschans of Dido. Blent on the sailrife seys and erth tharby, With pepill dwellyng on costis fer syndry, Heich in the hevynnys top he baid hoverand And of Lyby beheld graithly the land. Within his breist on diuerss curis as he thus Musys and thynkis, ontill hym spak Venus All dolorus, hir eyn full of brycht teris: “O thou,” quod sche, “quhilk governys, rewlis and steris Baith goddis and men be thyne etern empyre, And oft affrays with thundyr and wyldfyre, Quhou mycht myne Ene sa gretly the offend?

Bot to schaw his innocens, lat vs induce the mast nobill and famus historian and mylky flud of eloquens, gret Tytus Lyuius, quhilk of Anthenor and Eneas sais thir wordis in his beginning: “It is weill wyt that, Troy beand takin, in all the otheris Troianys crudelite was exersit, exceppand twa, Anthenor and Eneas, to quham the Grekis did na harm, bot abstenyt fra all power of batall as twichyng thaim, becauss of the rayson of hospitalite, for thai had beyn ther ald hostis, and all tymys thai war solistaris and warkkaris to rendyr Helen and to procur paice.” Now I beseik ?ow, curtess redaris, considdir gif this be punctis of traison, or rathar of honour, and wey the excellent awtorite of Virgill and Tytus Lyuius wyth ?our pevach and corrupt Gwido. Landinus sais als of this Anthenor that, for his sone Glaucus followit Paris, he depechit him of him, and for that sam caus, quhen he was aftyr slan by Agamenon, he maid na duyll for his ded. Of Grekis, and perss the soundis Ilyria, Ilyria hes his naym fra Illyrus, son to Polyphemus, and, as sais Sextus Rufus, it contenys xvii provyncis. It extendis endlang all the gret flud Danubyum, callit Hister, on bayth the sydis, and in it is Vngary, Pannony, Sclauony, Bohem, Denmark and Macydon; and this Lyburnya is bot a part therof, contenand certan ilis. Timauus is a flud in Lumbardy, in the Venytian landis, that cumis furth of the Duch montanys at ix beginnyngis, quhilk all rynnys in a loch, quham the pepill adiacent callis a sey, and from this loch cumys the flud that rynnys to Padva, byggit be Anthenor, as heir ?e may se. Bot it is tobe notyt that Virgill sais abuf, in the first c., Eneas coim fyrst fra Troy to Italy, and heir it apperis Anthenor caym befor him: to that sais Seruyus, tha partis quhamto coym Anthenor beyn not haldyn of Italy, bot of Lumbardy, callyt Gallia Cysalpina. Or mayr evidently may we say that Ene was the fyrst coim to Italy by fait, and at the goddis command. Anthenor coym at his awin auentur, and nocht be destine. And sovirly pass the strait regionys alswa Of Liburnanys, and our Tymavy the flude, Quharat nyne movthis rynnand as it war wode The hillis resoundis, sa rudly doith it rowt, And like a sey bettis on the brays abowt; Thar netheless of Padva the cite A dwelling place for Troianys biggit has he, And nemmyt the pepill efter hym, and full ?or The armys of Troy has set vp in memor: Bot we thi blude, thi kynrent and ofspring, To quham in hevin thou grantis a place to ryng, Schame forto say, all throw the feid of ane, Has lossit our schippis, and ar betrasit ilkane, And fer from Itale bene withhaldin eik— Is this reward ganand for thame ar meik?

Quhen thre someris in Latium or Itail And thre wynteris he rungyn has all haill Fra tyme Rutilyanys bene subdewit in fecht, That the ?ong child, quhilk now Ascanyvs hecht Iulus is thre sillabis, spellit wyth i per se and v per se. And to surname clepit Iulus sans faill, For he in Ilion was of the blude ryale, Quhill that of Troy and Ilion stude the ryng, Thretty lang twelfmonthis rolling our sal ryng, From Lavyne realm the seyt translait alswa And forcely wall the cite lang Alba. The cite Alba, biggit by Ascanius son of Creusa, eftyr Virgill had his naim fra the quhite swyn, as ?e may se in the first c. of the viii buk; and was clepit Lang Alba for it was set endlang the band or ryg of a law hill, as writis Tytus Lyuius, and wass distroit by Tullus Hostilius, thrid king of Rom, and tharof in the xi c. of the xiii buke. Thar sal thre hundreth ?eris togidder remane The ryng vnder the pepill Hectoriane, Pepill Hectorean, hardy as Hector, or of the kinrent and blud of Hector, for this Ascan?us was his fift son. Quhil Ilya, nun and dochter of a kyng, Consavit of Mars, twa twynnys do furth bring; Than with the glitterand wolf skyn our his aray, Cled in his nuryss talbert glaid and gay, Romulus sal the pepill ressaue and weld, Of Romulus ?e sall knaw, that Porcas, the xi kyng of Alba or Albanys, gat twa sonys, Numytor and Amulyus, betwyx quham he dividit his realm. Bot this Amulyus banyst his brother Numytor, and slew his son Lawsus; and his dochtir, callit Ilya or Rhea, consecrat a nun onto the goddes Vesta, to that effect scho suld haf na succession, for in tha dais sik nunis, gif tha brak ther virginite, war eyrdit qwyk. Bot this Ilia consauyt and brocht furth twa childyr mayll, quham thai fen?e to haf beyn engendyrit of Mars, becauss thai war bellicoss and chevalruss, and bygettin of sum dowchti man. And than this Amulyus gart put this Ilia to ded and bad kast tha childyr in Tybyr. Bot the flud bean speyt was flowyn sa far our the brays thai mycht nocht wyn to the crocis of the water and thus war thai left on the bra. And ane Faustus, an hyrd, had thaim haim to his howss, and maid Acca his wyf, other wyss callyt Lupa, nuryce thaim; and for that Lupa betakinnys a wolf and scho was callit Lupa, therfor is it said a wolf fosterit Romulus and Remus. And becauss this said Acca or Lupa maid Romulus hir ayr, therfor sais Virgill he was cled in his motheris or nuryce tawbart. And eftyr, quhen thai worth men, thai becam for the nanys briggantis of the wod, and by a maner pollycy or practyk convenyt that the tayn of thaim suld tak his brother and all his complicis, and sa thai did, and brocht him befor ther vncle the kyng Amulyus, as thocht he wald accuss him of a dedly cryme. And quhen thai war in presens cumin, thai bayth attanys rayss apon Amulyus and slew him, and ther declaryt ther blud and genealogy, and therefter brocht haim thar grandsyr Numytor, and restoryt to him his realm, syn went ther way and for thaim selvyn biggit Roym and wallyt fyrst. And for thai war bayth of a byrth, thai beguyth debait for the naim of the cyte. Than was appunctyt that on the morn quha saw the mast nobyll syng or takin augurian suld geif the cyte his naym. And Remus fyrst saw vi gripis, and Romulus eftyr hym xii gripis. Than said the tayn his takyn was most nobyll for that he saw thaim first; and the tother na, becauss he saw ma; bot quhiddir it was for that debait, or for the goyng our the wallis, as otheris will say, Remus was slayn be Fabyus, chyftan of weyr to Romulus, and the cyte clepit Roma eftyr Romulus. And quhou or quhy that he is callit Quyrites, and of his dowtsom end, and of the sonnis eclips the tym of his ded, and quhy he was repute a god, reid Titus Lyuius, Iohn Bocas in the last c. of the Genealogi of Godis in the ix buke, and Augustyn in the Cyte of God in the xv c. of the iii buke. And sum thing heir eftir in the xiii c. of the vi buke and the x c. of the viii buyk. And he the mercial wallis of Rome sal beld, And efter his name cal the pepill Romanys. To thir folkis quhou lang thar ryng remanys, Nowder term of space nor boundis of sen?eory Sanct Augustyn in his volum clepit De Verbis Domini, in the xxix sermond, mokkis at this word, sayand: “?it is not the end, and the empyr is translat to the Almanys. Bot Virgill was crafty,” sais he, “that wald not on his awyn byhalf rehers thir wordis, bot maid Iupiter pronunce thaim—and as he is a half fen?eit god, swa is his prophecy.” Nane wil I set, for to thame grant haue I Perpetual empyre, bot end to lest, Apirsmert Iuno, that with gret onrest Now cummyrris erd, sey and ayr,” quod he, “Sal turn hir mynd bettir ways and with me Fostir the Romanys, lordis of al erdly geir, And Latyne pepill kepe bath in payce and weir. This is determyt, this lykis the goddis, I wyss. Eftyr mony lustris and ?eris ourslydyn is, The tyme sal cum quhen Anchises ofspring The realm of Pthythia in bondage sal doune thring, Pthytia was the cuntre of Achilles; Myce or Mycene, the realm of Agamenon; Arge, the realm of Kyng Adrastus, pertenyng eftir to Diomed be raison of his moder, and it is oft tane for all Grece, and the Grekis therfra bein oft clepit Argiui, or pepill of Arge. And eik of Myce subdew the regioune large, And vndir thar lordschip dant al Grece and Arge, Cesar of nobill Troiane blude born salbe, Quhilk sal thempyre delait to the occiane see, And to the sternys vpspring sal the fame Of Iulius, that takyn haith hys name Of Iuliuss Cesar, quhen I behald his Commentareis, and the gret volum of Lucan, and quhat of hym writis Swytoneus, I thynk bettyr hald styll my pen than wryt lytill of sa large a mater and sa excellent a prynce. Bot ?e sall knaw that the principall entent of Virgill was to extoll the Romanys, and in specyal the famyllye or clan Iulyan, that coim from this Ascanyus, son to Eneas and Crevsa, otherwais callyt Iulus; becauss the empryour August Octavyan, quhamto he direkkit this wark, was of that hows and blud, and sistyr son to Cesar Iulyus. And therfor, quhen Cesar was slayn by the Sanatouris, Octavyan had revengit his deth, and rang passabilly at the byrth of our Salviour, quhen the starn of Bethliam apperit. Than to pless Octavian, said the Romanys that was the sawll of Cesar quhilk was deifyit, and this opynion heir twischis Virgill and alss in his Bucolyqueys. From Iulus, thi nevo, the gret kyng, As prince discend of his blude and ofspring, Quham, efter this, sovir of thyne entent, Chargit with the spul?e of the orient, Amang the nowmyr of goddis ressaue thou sall, And as a god men sal him clep and call. The cruel tyme sone therefter sal cess, And weris stanche, al salbe rest and pess; Ancyant faith and valiant knychthed, With chaste religioune, sal than the lawys led; The dreidful portis salbe schet, but faill, Off the stek and of closyng of the tempill of Ianus in tym of weyr and of pace, ?e haf in the vii buyk in the x c. And this tempill of Ianus was twyss closit befor Octauian: anys be Numa Pompilius, and the secund tym be Tytus Manlyus, and thriss be Octavyan. And this tym heyr markyt was the last tym, at the cumyng of Cryst, quhen all the warld was in pace. In wytnes therof the angellis sang pace in erd, the tym of bryth: the ii c. of Sanct Luke.

In this cheptir ?e haf that Eneas met his moder Venus in lykness of a virgyn or a mayd, by the quhilk ?e sall vndirstand that Venus is fen?eit to be modyr to Eneas becaws that Venus was in the ascendent and had domynation in the hevyn and tym of his natyvite; and for that the planet Venus was the signifiar of his byrth and had domination and speciall influens towart hym, therfor is scho fen?eit to be his mother; and thus it that poetis fen?eis bein full of secreyt ondyrstandyng ondyr a hyd sentens or fygur. And weyn nocht for this, thocht poetis fen?eis Venus the planet, for the causs foirsaid, tobe Eneas mother, at thai beleve nocht he was motherless, bot that he had a fayr lady to his moder, quhilk for hir bewte was clepit Venus. And that Venus metis Eneas in form and lykness of a maid is tobe onderstand that Venus the planete that tym was in the syng of the Virgyn, quhilk betakynnyt luf and fawouris of wemen. And of Venus and hir son Cupyd I sall say sum thyng in the x c. of this sam buke. So that of Cartage baith realm and new cite To luge the Troianys suld all reddy be, Less than Dido, the destany mysknawand, Wald thame expell hyr boundis or hyr land.

Bot al this nyght the reuthfull Eneas, That in his mynd gan mony thyng compass, Belive as that the hailsum day wolx lycht Dressit him furth to spy and haue a sycht Of new placis, fortil serss and knaw To quhatkyn costis he with the wynd was blaw, Quha thame inhabit, quhidder wild bestis or men— For al semyt bot wilderness til hym then— And as he fand schupe till hys feris to schaw, Hys navy dern amyd the thyk wod schaw, Vnderneth the holkit hyngand rochis hie, Dekkit about with mony semly tre, Quhois schaddowis dyrk hyd weill the schippis ilkane. And he bot with a fallow furth is gane, With traste Achates; in athiris hand yfeir Mony expondis Achates for thochtfull cuyr or solicitud, quhilk all tymys is feyr and compan?eon to princis and gret men. The braid steil heid schuke on the huntyng speir. Amyd the wod hys moder met thame tway Semand a maid in vissage and aray The madynnis of Sparta bene the Amasonys. With wapynnys like the virgynys of Spartha Or the stowt wench of Trace, Harpalica, Harpalica douchter to Ligurgus kyng of Trace, hir fader beand tane be the pepil of Getya, assemblit hir power and with sa gret haist persewit thame that scho semyt in swiftness to forryn the swiftast flude of Trace, callit Hebrun; and with mair agilite and hardyment than is almaste tobe belevit, reskewit hir fader and ourcome hir aduersaris. Hastand the horss hir fadir to reskew, Spedyar than Hebrun, the swyft flude, dyd persew; For Venus eftyr the gyss and maner thar Ane active bow apon hir schuldir bar As scho had bene a wild hunteress, With wynd waving hir haris lowsit of tress, Hir skyrt kiltit til hir bair kne, And first of other, onto thame thus spak sche: “Howe, say me ?ongkeris, saw ?e walkand heir By aventur ony of my sisteris deyr, The cayss of arrowis tachit by hir syde, And cled in to the spottit lynx hyde, Or with lowd cry followand the chayss Eftir the fomy bayr, in thar solace?” Thus said Venus, and hir son agane Answeris and said, “Trewly, maide, in plane Nane of thi systeris dyd I heir ne se. Bot, O thou virgyne, quham sal I cal the? Thy vissage semys na mortale creatur Nor thi voce sovndis not lyke to humane nature: A goddess art thou suythly to my syght.

Sik honour certis, quhilk feris me nocht to haue, For to the madynnys of Tyre this is the gyiss To beir a cayss of arowis on this wyss, With rede botynys on thar schankis hie. This is the realm of Punyce quhilk ?e se, The pepill of Tyre, and the cite, but mor, Belt be the folk discend from Agenor. Of Agenor ?e sal knaw that Iupiter engendrit Ephaphus, quhilk gat Belus the first, that engendrit this Agenor, and he begat Phenix, fra quham the realm of Tyre was namyt Phenycia and the pepil bath of Tyre and Cartage Phenycianys or Punycianys. This Phenix begat Belus the secund, otherwyss callit Methres, and he was fader to this Pygmaleon and Queyn Dido, otherwyss nemmyt Elissa. This ilk Phenix also engendrit Philistenes, quhilk begat this Sycheus, otherwyss callit Sicarbas, spouss to this ilk Dido and gret preste to Hercules. ?he bene in the merchis of Lyby, sans faill, Inhabit with pepill ondantabill in bataill, Quhar Dido quene rewlis the empyre, Hydder, for hir brodir, fled from the realm of Tyre; Lang war the iniuris, the dowtis lang tobe tald, Bot I the vmaste of the mater sall hald. Ane husband, quhilk Sycheus hecht, had sche, Rychast in all the grond of Phenyce And strangly luffit of the silly Dido, For be hir fader, as was the maner tho, By chans scho was in cleyn virginite Weddit to hym. Bot of Tyre the cuntre In heretage held Pigmalyon hir brodir, In wikkitnes cruel abufe all othir, Quhilk, but offence or occasioun of greif, For blynd cwatyce of gold throu his myscheif, Befor the altar, slely with a knyfe, Or he was war, reft Sycheus the lyfe, And, of the gret luf of his systir suyr, Concelyt this cruel deid lang vndir cuyr— That fals man, by dissaitfull wordis fair, With vaynhope trumpit the wofull luffar. Bot of hir husband bygravit the ymage To hir apperis in sleip, with pail vissage, On mervellus wyss, and gan at lenth declare Quhou he was cruelly slane at the altare. He schew the knyf outthrow hys breist threst, And all the hyd cryme of hir howss manyfest, Syne in gret haist exortis hir to fle And leif hir native land, and tak the see, And, forto help hir onwart by the way, Vnder the erth quhar ald hurdis hyd lay, Of siluer and gold revelit a huge weght. Dido, heirat commovit I ?ou hecht, For hir departing falloschip reddy maid; Togidder conuenys but ony langar abaid All thai quhilk hatis the cruell tyrrantis dedis, Or ?it his fellon violence sair dredis. The schippis that on cayss war reddy thar Thai tuke, and chargit full of gold but mayr. The tresour of the wrachit Pigmaleon Is thus caryit our the sey onone. A woman captane is of all this deid. To ?one place ar thai cummyn, thou may tak heid, Quhar now rysis ?one large wallis stowt Of New Cartage, with hie towris abowt. Als mekill grond thai bocht at the first tyde Sum sais scho gave alss mekyll gold as wald gang in a bul hid for this grund; sum haldis opynyon that in thai dais the monye was mad of cuyrbul?e or leddyr, and this castell hes his naym therfra, for in the langage of Affrik, “byrsa” betakynnys leddyr or a hyd. Bot Seruyus is of Virgillis opynion, sayand Dido maid carve the bull hid in sa small twhangis that it cumpassyt abowt the spass of xxii stageis, that is, thre myllis quarter less. As thai mycht compas with a bullis hyde; ?ondir cheif castell standing on the bra Into thar langage clepit is Byrsa, And of this deid his name beris witnes ?it. Bot quhat be ?he, finaly wald I wyt? Or of quhat cuntre cummyn? Or pass wald quhar?” Sche sperand this, Eneas sichand sair, The voce drawand deip from his breist within, Said, “O thou goddess, gif I suld begyn And tell our labour from the formast end, To heir our storyis set thou myght attend, Or I maid end, Vesper, the evyn starn brycht, Suld cloyss the hevin and end the days lycht. We ar of ancyant Troy (gif euer ?e The name of Troy has hard in this cuntre), And caryit throuowt diuerss seys alswa, And now by fortoune to cost of Lybia Drevyn with tempest. Rewthfull Ene am I, That Eneas heyr commendis his self, it is not to be tayn that he said this for arrogans bot forto schaw his styll, as a kyng or prince onknawin in an onkowth land may but repreif reherss his estate and dygnite to mak him be tretyt as afferis. And alss, becauss he trastyt he spak wyth a goddess, that scho suld nocht aschaym to remayn and talk wyth hym therfor; and becauss scho was a woman, he schew that he was a man of autorite, wyth quham thai nedis nocht ascham to speyk, for he was that man quhilk by the common voce was clepit Eneas full of pyete. And for that Virgill clepis hym swa all thro this buyk, and I interpret that term quhylys for “rewth,” quhils for “devotion” and quhilis for “pyete” and “compassion,” tharfor ?e sall knaw that pyete is a vertw or gud deid be the quhilk we geif our dylligent and detfull lawbour to our natyve cuntre and onto thaim beyn conionyt to vs in neyr degre. And this vertw, pyete, is a part of iustyce and hes ondyr hym twa other vertwys: amyte, callyt frendschip, and liberalyte. That Troiane golddis tursys in my navy, Quham fra amyd our ennemyss I rent. My fame is knaw abufe the eliment. I seik Itale and our auld cuntre fer And lynage cum from hyast Iupiter. With schippis twyss ten the Phyrgyane see, My modir a goddes techand the way, tuke we, Varo sais that Eneas, fra his departing of Troy quhil he coym in the feldis of Lawrentum, all the day saw the starn of Venus, and quhen he was thiddir cummyn he saw it na mair, quharby he ondirstud that was his grund fatayll. Followand destany quhilk was to me grant. Of all our floyt, from wynd and wallys skant Sevin evil perbrakit salue remanys with me. Onkend and mysterfull in desertis of Lybe I wandir, expellit from Europ and Asia.” Venus na mair sufferit hym pleyn or say; Amyd hys dolorus playntis thus spak sche: “Quhat evir thou art, I trast weill at thou be Favorit with the goddis, and drawis this hailsum ayr, Quhilk is the spreit of lyfe, to thy weilfair, Sen thou art cummyn to Cartage the cyte.

Now pass thy way evyn furth that sammyn went.” Thus said sche, and turnand incontinent, Hir nek schane lyke onto the royss in May, Hyr hevynly haris glitterand brycht and gay, Kest from hir forhed a smell gloryus and sweit, Hir habyt fell down coveryng to hir feit, And in hir passage a verray god dyd hir kyth. And fra that he knew hys moder alswith With sik wordis he followys as scho dyd fle: “Quhy art thou cruell to thy son,” quod he, “Dissavand hym sa oft with fals sembland? Quhy grantis thou nocht we mycht ioyn hand in hand And fortill heir and rendir vocis trew?” Thus he reprevys, bot sche is went adew. Than to the cyte he haldis furth the way, Bot Venus with a sop of myst baith tway And with a dyrk clowd closyt rownd abowt, That na man suld thame se nor twich but dowt, Ne by the ways stop or ellis deir, Or ?it the cawsis of thar cummyn speir. Hyr self vplyft to Paphum passyt swith To vissy hir restyng place, ioly and blith; Thar is hir tempill into Cypir land, Quharin thar doith ane hundreth altaris stand, Hait byrnnyng full of Saba sens all howris, And smellyng sweit with fresch garlandis of flowris. Eneas, at his moderys commandment, Cled with the mysty clowd, to Cartage went. Thai in the meyn tyme hastit furth thar way As the rod led thame, quhil ascend ar thai The hill fer rysand abuf the town on hycht, Quhar all the cite forgane thame se thai mycht. Eneas wondrit the gretnes of Cartage, Quhilk lait tofor had beyn ane smal cotage; The fair portis alsso he ferleit fast, And of the brute of pepill tharat inpast, The large stretys paithit by and by. The byssy Tyrryanys lauborand ardently, Ane part haistis tobeild the wallys wight, And sum to rayss the gret castell on hyght And welt vp stanys to the wark on hie, Sum grathis fast the thak and rufe of tre, And sum abowt delvys the fowsy deip, Sum chesis officeris the lawys forto kepe With counsalouris and senatouris, wyss folkis, ?onder othersum the new havyn holkis, And heir alsso, ane other end fast by, Lays the fundament of the theatry, And otheris eik the huge pillaris grete Out of the querrellys gan do hew and bete Fortill adorn that place in all degre In tyme cummyng quhar gret triumphe suldbe— Lyke to the beys, in feildis floryst new, Gaderyng thar wark of mony diuerss hew, In soft somyr the brycht son hait schynyng, Quhen of thar kynd thame list swarmys furthbryng, Or in camys incluss thar hwny cleyn And with sweit liquour stuffis thar cellis scheyn, Or ressavys the byrdyngis from othir tharowt, Or fra thar hyve togyddir in a rowt Expellis the bowbart beist, the faynt drone be; Thar labour is bissy and fervent forto se, The hwny smellys of the sweit tyme seid. “O,” quod Ene, “full happy ar ?he in deid, Quhais large wallis rysys thus on hie!” A quhile he visseit the boundis of this cite, Ane wonder thyng, coverit with a clowd about: He entrys syne amyd the thikast rowt, Amang the men he thrang, and nane hym saw. Amyd the cite stude ane semly schaw, With hys maist plesand sobir schaddowis, quhar, As the Punycianys first vpwarpit war Efter the stormys blastis and seys rage, Thai delvand fand the takynnar of Cartage, Ane mekill horss hed that was, I weyn, As Iuno had schaw tofor, of goddis queyn, That signyfyit the cite excellent in batale, And plentuus eik al tymys of vittale. In the ilke place, the Sydonas Dido Begouth to byg a prowd tempill of Iuno With dowreis seir and gyftis of rychess And eik the goldyn statw of the goddes. The entre rayss with hie stagis of brass, With brass alsso the cupplys festynnyt was; The brassyn durris iargis on the marbill hirst. In this tempill, seir novelteis first Schawin till Eneas mesyt gretly hys feir: The first assurance of comfort was heir And hope of releif eftir aduersite, For as he went diuerss thingis to se, Rowmyng about the large tempill scheyn Fortobehald the cummyng of the queyn And of the cite the gret prosperite, The mony warkmen and thar craftis sle, In dew proportioun, as he woundrit for ioy, He saw perordour all the sege of Troy, The famus batellis, wlgat throu the warld or this, Of Kyng Pryam and athir Attrides, Kyng Agamenon and Duke Menalay. And, baldar than thame baith, the ferss Achil. He styntis, and wepand said Achates tyll: “Quhou now, quhilk place is this, my frend,” quod he, “Quhat regioun in erd may fundyn be Quhar our mysforton is nocht fully proclame? Allace, behald, se ?ondir Kyng Priam, Lo, heir his wirschip is haldin in memor. Thir lamentabyll takynnys passit befor Our mortal myndis aucht to compassioun steir. Away with dreid, and tak na langar feir! Quhat, wenys thou na this fame sall do the gude?” Thus said he and fed hys mynd, quhar he stude, With thir plesand fen?eit ymagery, Murnand sair and wepand tendyrly, The flude of terys halyng our hys face, For as he lukit on the wark percace, He saw porturate quhar in sik a place The Grekis fled and Troianys followis the chace Abowt the wallys of Troy as thai dyd fyght. At ?ondir part the Troianys tak the flycht, With creste on hed Achillis in hys chair Persewand strangly. Not far thens saw he quhar The quhite tentis of Kyng Rhesus, evill kepe, Betraisit war apon the first sleip, Quhar with gret slauchter bludy Diomeid Distroyt all, and till hys tent gan leid The mylk quhite horssis, fers, swift and gude, Or evir thai taistit ony Troiane fude Or drunkyn had of the flude Exanthus. And ?ondir, lo, beheld he Troilus Wantyng his armour, the fey barn fleand, Fortill recontyr Achilles onganand, The horss hym harland behynd the void cart Hyngand wyde oppyn, and hys hed dounwart; Supposs he held the ren?eis fast but faill, Hys nek and harys on the erd gan traill, The speir ourturnyt in the duste dyd write. The sammyn tyme, the Troian madynnys quhite, With hair doun skalit, all sorofull gan pass Onto the tempill of the grevit Pallas To ask supple; with thame a wympill bair thai, With handis betand thar breistis by the way: This fremmyt goddess held hir eyn fixt fast Apon the grund, nocht a blenk list thame cast. Abowt the wallis of Troy he saw quhat wyss Achilles harlyt Hectoris body thryss; The ded corps syne for gold he saw hym sell. Law from his breist murnand he gave a ?ell, Seand the void cart and spul?e of the knycht And the corps of his derrest frend sa dight. Priam onarmyt streke furth handis dyd he spy From Achilles hys sonnys body toby. Him self alsswa mydlit persavit he Amang princis of Grece in the melle. The orient hostis knew he one by one, And Vlcanus armour on blak Menon.

Heir to the tempil cummys Queyn Dido Quhar that Eneas his feris fand alsso. Quhill as the manfull Troian Eneas To se thir nyce figuris thocht wonder was, And as he musyt, studyand in a stair Bot on a sycht quhar on he blenkit thar, The queyn Dido, excellent in bewte, To tempill cumis with a fair men?e Of lusty ?yngkeris walkyng hir about.

Bot suddandly persavis Eneas Quhar with gret haist com rynnyng Antheus, Sergest he seis, and stalwart Cloanthus, With diuerss otheris of the Troian men?e, Quham the blak storm had skatterit on the see And at ane other cost drevyn to the land.

Achates half estonyst stude in affray; With feir and ioy smyttin baith war thai, And langit sair to schaik handys; bot thar hart The onkouth cace amovit in sum part Forto dissymyll, as na thing seyn thai had, And with the dyrk clowd hyd, to spy thai baid Quhou it stude with thar ferys, or chansyt eft, Or on quhat cost thar navy thai had left, Quhat thai desyrit, for, as full weill thai saw, From thar schippis per ordour thai com on raw, Besekand grace and peax fast, as thame thocht, And to the tempill with gret clamour socht. Fra thai war enterit in the tempill tho And licens grantit thame to speke alsso, The gretast oratour, Ilioneus, With plesand voce begouth his sermond thus: “O hie princes, quhamto Iupiter hass grant To beld ane new cyte, and to dant The violens of prowd folk by iust law, We wrachit Troianys, with the wyndis blaw Throu strange stremys and mony diuerss see, Forbyd ?on cruell fyre, besekis the, Suffir not to byrn our schippis in a rage, Haue reuth apon our petuus auld lynage. Considir frendly our mater quhou it standis: We com nocht hiddir with drawyn swerdis in handis To spul?e templis or rychess of Lybia, Nor by the cost na spreth to dryve away. Sik violens nane within our myndis is, Nor sa gret stowtnes to venquyst folk, I wyss. Thar is a place quham the Grekis, thai say, Onto hys name clepis Hesperia, Ane nobill land, richt potent in bataill, And fructuus grond, plentuus of vittalle, By Kyng Onotryus inhabit first, we trow, Bot in our days laitly, the fame is now, Eftir thar duke it is namyt Italy. Thidderwart our courss was laid, quhen suddanly The flude boldnyt, and stormy Orion Amang blynd bankis cachit ws onon; The byttir blastis, contrarius al ways, Throw wallis huge, salt fame and wilsum wais, And throw the perrellus rowkis gan ws dryve; Hidder at ?our cost ar few of ws arryve. Quhat kynd of pepill duellis heir?” quod he, “Quhou beyn sik thewis sufferit in this cuntre? We ar defendit to herbry on the sand, Prouokyt eik to batale, and, drevyn to land By forss of storm, the slyke thai ws deny. Albeit the strenth of men ?he set not by And mortal weris contempnys and comptis nocht, Belevis weill ?it than and haue in thocht The goddis sall remember, traistis me, Baith of gud dedis and iniquite. To ws was kyng the worthy Eneas, Ane iustar man in all the warld nane was, Nor mair reuthfull, nor wisar into weir, And mair valiant in dedis of armys seir, Quham gif the fatis alyve conservit haith To tak this hevinly ayr and draw his braith, And not with cruell gostis hyd vnder erd, We neid not dreid, sall nocht mak ws efferd, Nor thou sall neuer repent the sykkyrly To schaw ws first frendschip and curtasy. Into the realm of Sycill als haue we Frendis and citeis, with armyt men plente, And of the Troian blude Acestes kyng. Gyf ws war levit our flote on land to bryng, That with the wynd and storm is all to schaik, And grantit eik wod leif to hew, and take Tymmyr to beit ayrris and other mysteris, So that our kyng we mycht fynd and our feris, Blithly we suld hald towart Italy, And to the cost of Latium seik inhy. Bot gif our weilfar and beleve cleyn gayn is, And the, maist souerane fader of ws Troianys, The Lybian sey withhaldis, gif thou be gone, Nor of Ascanyus comfort remanys none, Than suythly, at the leste, the Sycill see And placis reddy fra quham hidder drevin ar we, We sall seik, and to the kyng Acestes.” Thus said Ilioneus, and sa can he cess, Bot than the noyss rayss amang the Troianys— Thai murmuryt and complenyt all at anys. Than schortly Dido spak with vissage doun cast: “Remove all dreid, Troianys, beis nocht agast, Pluk vp ?our hartis, and hevy thochtis dovn thring. Ane hard myschans and novelte of this ryng Constrenys me sik mastry forto schaw, And with discurriouris kepe the cost on raw. Quha knawys nocht the lynnage of Enee?

Quhiddir ?he will to gret Hesperia, The grund of Saturn, quhilk now is Italy, Or to the cost of Sycill fast tharby, And at the kyng Acestes lyst ?ou be, Thidder sall ?he suyrly pass with my supple; I sal support ?ou with all geir may gayn. And pless ?he with me in this realm remane, The cite quhilk I byg is ?ouris fre; Bryng in ?our schippis hidder from the see; Betwix a Troiane and ane Tyrriane Na differens—all sall I rewle as ane; And with this sammyn wynd hidder blaw in feir Wald God Enee ?our kyng war present heir! Endlang the costis and far partis of Lyby I sall forsuyth exploratouris send to spy In ony wod gyf that he be vpdryve, Or ?it perchance at ony cyte arryve.” Quhou Eneas with all his rowt bedene War thankfully ressauyt of the queyn. Uith thir wordis the spreit of Eneas And of the strang Achates reiosyt was, Gretly desyryng the clowd to brek in tway. Bot first Achates till Enee gan say: “Son of the goddes, quhat purposs now,” quod he, “Rysis in thy breist? All is sovir, thou may se, Thyne navy and thy ferys recoverit beyn, Wantand but ane, amang the fludis greyn Quham we saw droun. All other thingis, thou knawis, Is now conform onto thy moderis sawys.” And scarsly haith he all thir wordis spokkyn, Quhen that the clowd abowt thame swith was brokkyn And vanyst tyte away amang the ayr. Vp stude Enee, in cleir lycht schynyng fair, Lyke till ane god in body and in face For his moder grantit hir son sik grace, Hys crysp harys war plesand on to se, Hys favour gudly, full of fresch bewte, Lyke till ane ?ongker with twa lauchand eyn— Als gracyus fortobehald, I weyn, As evoir boyn by craft of hand weill dycht, Or as we se the burnyst siluer brycht, Or ?it the quhite polist marbill stane schyne Quhen thai beyn circulit about with gold sa fyne. Or evir thai wist, befor thame all inhy, Onto the queyn thus said he reuerently: “Hym quham ?e seik behald now present heir, Enee the Troian, delyverit from danger Of storm and wallys of the Libiane see. O thou only, quhilk rewth hess and piete On the ontellabill pyne of the Troianys, Quhilk ws, the Grekis levyngis and remanys, Ourset with all maner necessiteis And euery perrell baith be landis and seis, Within thy cyte ressauys till herbry And to famyliar frendschip and ally; To quyte the, rendring ganand thankis rycht, That lyis nocht, Dido, intill our mycht, Nor all the laif of the Troian men?e, Throw out this warld skatterit quhar euer thai be, Bot the hie goddis, gif ony deite takis tent To thame at petuus beyn and pacient, For iustice eik gif euer reward beis get, And rychtwyss myndis ramembrit and nocht for?et, Thai ilke goddis mot dewly reward the Accordyng thy desert in all degre.

The queyn Dido, astonyst a litill wie At the first syght, behaldand his bewte, Awondring be quhat wyss he cummyn was, Onto him thus scho said with myld face: “Son of the goddes, quhat hard aduersite Throw owt so feill perrellis hass catchit the? Quhat forss and violens drave the hyddir till ws, Apon thir costis that beyn so dangerus? Art thou not theilk compacient Eneas That apon haly Venus engendrit was Be the Troian Anchises, as thai say, Besyde the flude Symois in Phrigia? Weill I remembir, to Sydon the cyte Sen Tewcer com, banyst from his cuntre, Sekand supple at Belus, and sum new land; My fader than, Belus, I vndirstand, The rich realm of Cipir wastit by weir, And wan it syne and gave it to Tewcer, And evir syne of Troy, that gret cyte, The distructioun hass beyn weill knaw to me, Thy name alsso, and pryncis of Grece sans faill With quham thou faught seir tymys in batale. This ilk Tewcer hys ennemys of Troy Rusyt and lovit, and with excellent ioy Full oft him self extoll and vant he wald Of Troiane blude tobe discend of ald. Tharfor haue done, gallandis, cum on ?our way, Entir within our lugyng, we ?ou pray. Siclike fortoun, throu mony feill danger, At last onto this land hass dryve me heir; Thus, nocht mysknawand quhat payn is ennoy to dre, I lernyt to help all tholis aduersyte.” Rehersyng this, convoys sche Eneas Towart the place quhar hir ryche palyce was, And tharwith eik commandis halyday, Throwe owt the cyte all suldbe game and play. And netheless, the sammyn tyme sendis sche Down to his folkis at the cost of the see Twenty fed oxin, large, gret and fyne, And ane hundreth bustuus bowkis of swyne, Ane hundreth lammys and thar moderis tharby, With other presandis, and wyne habundandly. The place within maist gloriusly and gay Adornyt was all our with ryall array; Amyd the hie rufe of the mekill hall For the banket mony rich claith of pall Was spred, and mony badkyn wonderly wrocht. Of siluer playt ane huge weght furth was brocht To set on burdis, and veschell forgit of gold Quharin was grave (maste curyus tobehold) The val?eant dedis of forfaderis past by Sen first begynnyng of thar geneology, Man eftir man lyke as thai dyd succeid, In lang rememberans of thar worthyheid. Ene, for that his faderly piete Wold nocht suffir hys mynd in rest tobe, In haist Achates to the schippis send To schaw Ascaneus all fra end till end, Onto the cite that he onon war brocht; On ?ong Ascaneus was haill the faderis thocht. Seir gyftis eik he bad bryng with him syne, Hynt and deliuerit from the Troian rewyne— Ane rych garmont brusyt with stife gold wyre, The purpour mantill and rycht quent attyre That pliabill was with the gilt bordour large, Sum tyme array of Helene, queyn of Arge, Quhilk from the realm of Myce with hir sche brocht, Quhen scho to Troy forbodyn hymeneus socht, This wondrus gift gottin at hir moder Lyda; And forthir eik, of fair Illionya He bad hym bryng with hym the ceptre wand Quhilum Priamus eldast douchter bair in hand, The collar pight with orient peirlys als That sche vmquhile wair about hir hals, Off gold alsso the closs or dowbill crown Set full of precyus stonys enveroun. To do his charge, Achates bissely The way towart the schippis socht in hy. Quhou that Venus, all perrellis to seclude, Send Cupide in Ascaneus similitude. In the meyn tyme, Venus a sle wile socht By new consait in hir mynd quhou scho mocht, In form the vissage of sweit Ascaneus tho Transformyt, send hir awin son Cupido To beir thir presandis, so that the amorus queyn He mycht inflambe, within hir banys greyn The hoyt fyre of lufe to kyndill and steir: For in hir mynd scho had a maner feir Of this lynnage waverand and ontrew (Tyrrhyanys dowbill tongit weill sche knew); Of cruell Iuno the dreid brynt hir inwart, With mony thocht ran hastely tyll hir hart. Onto the weyngit god of luf, but weir, For thy scho spak, and said on this maner: “O thow my child, my strenth and my gret mycht, O thou my son, quhilk only art so wight That thou the dartis of Iupiter dar ganestand, Quharwith he slew Typhon, the fell gyand, To the I cum, to the I seik,” quod sche, Of Typhon or Typheus, in the xi c. of the ix buke. “Lawly askyn thy power and supple. Quhat wyss thy broder Eneas, but dowt, Is blawyn and warpit euery cost about, Of wykkit Iuno throu the cruell invy, All this to the is manifest, weill wait I, For quhen I wepit tharfor, thow murnyt also. Now hym withhaldis the Phenycian Dido And cul?eis hym with slekit wordis sle, Bot to quhat fyne, richt sair it dredis me, Sall turn this plesand gestnyng in Cartage, Quhilk is the burgh of Iuno—for in hir rage As is begun the mater sall not remane. Quharfor I ombethynk me of a trane This queyn first forto cawch in luffis lace, And so with flambe of amouris till enbrace That by na mycht tharfra scho may remove, Bot strangly sall with me Eneas lufe.

Hym sall I sownd slepand steill away And hyde apon the hight of Citheray Or in Idalium, my hallowit schaw, That our dissait he nowder persave ne knaw, Nor onprovisitly cum thidder, thocht he mycht.

Bot Venus to this ilke Ascaneus The sweit vapour of plesand sleip and rest On all the membris of his body kest, And softly the goddess in hyr lap hym bair Amyd hyr schaw of Idalium, quhar Tendir mariolyne and sweit flowris thar out With thar dulce smell hym schaddowit rownd about. Of the banket, and of the gret deray, And quhou Cupyd inflambis the lady gay. Now passys furth Cupyd, full diligent Fortyll obey hys moderis commandment, Berand with hym the kyngly gyftis scheyn Quhilkis suldbe present to the ryall queyn, Blythly followyng hys ledar Achates. And as thai come, the quene was set at dess Vndir hir gloryus stentit capitale; Amang provd tapetis and mych rych apparale Hir place scho tuke, as was the gyss that tyde, Ourspred with gold amyd a beddis syde. Abuf all othir the fadir Eneas, And syne ?ong gallandis of Troy, to mete set was Apon rich beddis sydis, per ordour, Ourspred with carpettis of the fyne purpour. To wesch thar handis seruandis brocht watir cleir, Syne breyd in baskettis, eftyr thar maner, With soft serviatis to mak thar handis cleyn. Fyfty damycellis tharin seruyt the queyn, Quhilkis bair the cure eftir thar ordour haill On purvyance of howshald and vittaill, To graith the chalmeris and the fyris beld. Ane hundreth madynnys had scho ?ong of eld And elyke mony of the sam age ?ong swanys The cowrsis and the mesys, for the nanys, To set on burdis, sik as we call sewaris, And to fill cowpys, goblettis and eweris. And mayratour, the Tyrryanys halely At the blith ?ettis flokkis to the maniory, And as thai come, thai war down set onone On brusyt or payntit tapetis eueryone. Thai mervellit the rich gyftis of Eneas; Apon Ascaneus feill awondrit was, The schynand vissage of the god Cupyte And hys dissemblit slekit wordis quhite, The precyus mantill and quent garmond also; Bot principaly the fey onsylly Dydo, For the myscheif to cum predestinat, Mycht not refreyn nor satisfy hir consait, Bot ardently behaldis all on steir, Now lykand weill the child, and now the geir. As Cupyd hyngis about Eneas halss, Enbrasit in armys, fen?eand luf full fals, By semlant as he his fader had beyn, Full slely than he blent apon the queyn. Scho with hir sycht and all hir mynd rycht thar Hym to behalf sat musand in a stayr; Sumtyme onwar hym in hir bosum held sche, Mysknawand, allace! by fals subtilite, Quhou the gret god of luf with all hys mycht Wachit forto dissave hir, wofull wight.

The gyld and ryot Tyrryanys dowblit for ioy, Syne the rerd followit of the ?onkeris of Troy. Onhappy Dido alsso set all hir mycht With sermondis seir forto prolong the nycht, The langsum lufe drynkand inwart ful cald. Full mony demand of Priam speir scho wald And questionys seir twichyng Hector alswa; Now with quhais armour the son of Aurora Come to the sege, and now inquir wald sche Quhat kynd horss Diomede had in the melle, Quhou large of statur was ferss Achillis. “Haue done, my gentill gest, sone tell ws this Per ordour,” says scho, “fra the begynnyng, all The dissait of the Grekis and the fall Of ?our pepill and of Troy the rewyne; Thi wandring be the way thou schaw ws syne, For now the sevynt symmyr hyddir careis the, Wilsum and errant, throu euery land and see.” Eneas first excusys hym, and syne Addressis to reherss Troys rewyne. Thai cessit all atanys incontinent With mouthis closs and vissage takand tent. Prince Eneas, from the hie bed, with that, Into hys sege ryall quhar he sat, Begouth and sayd, “Thi desyre, lady, is Renewing of ontellabill sorow, I wyss, To schaw how Grekis dyd spul?e and distroy The gret rychess and lamentabill realm of Troy, And huge mysery quhilk I thar beheld (Quharof myself a gret part bayr and feld), Quhat Myrmydon or Gregion Dolopes Or knycht wageor to cruel Vlixes— Sik materis to reherss or ?it to heir, Mycht thame conteyn fra weping mony a teir?

In haymly wordis to wss thus carpis he: ‘Haist ?ou, matis, quhat slewth tareit ?ou thus lait? Our other feris rubbis, tursyng away fut hait The spreith of Troy, quhilk now is brynt to gledis, And ?e, fyrst from ?our schippis now ?ou spedis.’ Thus said he, quhen that suddanly and onone He felt hym self happynnyt amyd his foyn, For we hym gave answer not traist enewch. Estonyt with the word, abak he drewch, As quha onwar tred on a rowch serpent Lyggyng in the buss, and for feir bakwart sprent, Seand hir, reddy to stang and to infek, Set vp hir vennamus ?allo boldyn nek: On the sammyn wyss, Androgeus, of our syght Gretly effrayt, fled in al his mycht. On thame we schot, and in thar myd rowt duschit, Hewit, hakkit, smate down, and al to fruschit Tha fey Gregionys, on ilk syde heir and thair, With dreid ourset, and wist not quhar thai war. The first lawbour thus lukkit weil with wss. Ioyus in hart of this chance, Chorebus, ‘O ?e feris, hald furth this way,’ quod he, ‘Quhar forton first has schawyn ws sik supple, Hald thidder quhar our manhed has ws taucht.

Syklyke dyd Rypheus, my self eik, and Dymas, And all the other ?ongmen at thar was, Ful glaidly in that recent spul?e warm Belyf ilk man dyd thame self enarm. Amang the Grekis mydlit than went we, Nocht with our awyn takyn nor deite; Mony debatis and onsettis haue we done, And, throu the silens of the nycht, ondone Feil of the Grekis, and send to hell adown. Ane other men?e fled fast out of town To thar schippis and tha traist coistis nyce; Sum part alsso for schaymfull cowartyce Clam vp agane in the gret horssis maw And hyd thame in that belly weilbeknaw. Allace, onleiffull is ony man to weyn (Contrar the plesour of goddis) ocht may sustene. Lo, Priamus dochtir, the virgyne Cassandra, Was from the tempill and sete of Mynerva Drawyn forsabilly bairhed, with hayr down schake, Reuthfully invane behaldand hevyn, alake, With glotnyt eyn, for baith hir tendir handis War stren?eit sayr, ybondyn hard with bandis.

Heir war we fyrst tofruschit and hard byset, With dartis and with stanys all tobet By owr awyn feris from the templis hycht— A miserabil slauchtir thar begouth that nycht; The portratour of armys was mysknaw, All war bot Grekis tymbrellis at thai saw. Als quhat for walyng of irus wordis fell Agane reskewit said by the damycell, Grekis flokkis togidder heir and thar And ombesettis cruelly and sayr, The fellon Aiax and othir Atrides And al the rowtis clepit Dolopes. Lyke as sum tyme the fers wyndis ?e se, ?epherus, Nothus and Eurus, all thre Contrarius blaw thar bustuus bubbys with byr, The woddis rerdis, bath ayk, elm and fyr Ourturnys to grond and Nereus the fomy From the sey grond wod wraith is cachit in hy: On siklyke wyss the Grekis wss invadit, For than thai alls that fled war and evadit, Throu the dyrk nycht, quhen sum thar feris slew we, And thame had chasit throw owt all the cite, Thai war the first come now to do wss deir; Our fen?eit scheildis, wapynnys and other geir Ful weil thai knew, and by our vocis eik Thai notyfy that nane of wss was Greik. By multitude and nowmyr apon wss set All ?eid to wraik, thar war we hail doune bet. And first of all, down smyte is Chorebus By the rycht hand of Greik Peneleus Befor the altare of armipotent Pallas; Rypheus down fell, ane the maist iust man was, Amang Troianys best kepand equite— Bot other ways the goddis thocht suldbe; Hypanys eik and Dymas than alssua War by thar fallowis throwgyrd bath twa; Nor ?it the, Panthus, quhen that thou fell down, Thy gret pety and godly religioun Nor habyt of Apollo hyd from skaith.

Bot with the press we war relit of that sted, Only with me Hyphitus and Pelyas— For age Hyphitus waik and febill was, And Pelyas slawly mycht onethis go, By Vlixes for he was woundit so.” Quhou to the kyngis palyce speid Ene, That syne was take, thar helpit na suple. “Onone onto the palyce of Priamus The schowtis and the cryis callys wss. Thar was ane hydwyss batale forto seyn, As thar nane other bargane ayr had beyn, Lyke as nane slane war throu all the cite, Sa wod ondantit melle thar we se: The Grekis ruschand to the thak on hyght, So thik thai thrang about the portis all nycht That lyke a wall thai ombeset the ?ettis.

And other sum, law down within that hald, With drawyn swerdis stude reddy to kepe the ?et; In a thik rowt tharat was mony set. Our spretis war restoryt, and curage grew The kyngis palyce to succur, and reskew The men tharin with all help and supple, To strenthing thame war venquyst neyr, we se. A smal wykket thar was or entre dern, A litil ?et clepit a postern, On the bak half Priamus palyce almaist, Amang byggynnys stude desolate and waist, Quharat was wont alane Andromocha To entir oft to Priam and Hecuba, And Astyanax, hir ?ong son, with hir bring Onto his grandsyre Priamus the kyng. Tharat I enterit, and to the wallys hyght Vpwent, quhar wrachit Troianys as thai mycht Threw down dartis, thocht all was bot inwaist. We start ontil a hie turate in haist, The top vpstrekand to the starnys hie, Quharon we wont war al Troy forto se, The Grekis schippis and thar tentis eik. With instrumentis of irne we pyke, and seik Round al about quhar the ionyngis war worn, Reddy to fall, and corbalys al to torn; We holk and mynd the corneris for the nanys, Quhil down belive we tumbil it al atanys. A fellon rusch it maid, and sownd with all, And large on breid our Grekis rowtis dyd fall, Bot sone ane other sort start in thar stedis— Nowder stanys, nor quarellis with scharp hedis, Nor na kynd of wapynnys war sparit than. And first of al, befor the porch inran Hard to the entre, in schynyng plait and mail, Pyrrus, with wapynnys fersly to assaill, Lyke to the edder, with schrewit herbis fed, Cummyn furth to lycht and on the grond lyis spred, Quham wynter lang hyd vnder the cald erd, Now slippit hir slowch with schynand skyn new brerd, Hir slydry body in hankis rownd al run, Heich vp hir nek strekand forgane the son, With forkit tong intyll hir mouth quytterand. To the assalt with Pyrrus come at hand Periphas, and Automedon his squyer Was wont to govarn Achilles cart in weir, And al the fensabill men of Scyrrya Bownys our the wallis and howss hedis alsswa, And fyre blesis abuf the rufe garris fle. Bot first of al, ane stalwart ax hynt he, The stern Pyrrus, to hew and brek the ?et, And furth of har the stapillis has he bet, And bandis all of brass yforgyt weill: Be that in twa the master bar ilk deill Is al tofruschit, syne the hard burdis he hakkis, And throu the ?et ane large wyndo makkis, By the quhilk slop the place within apperis, The wyde hallys wolx patent al infeiris Of Priamus and ancyant kyngis of Troy; Secret throwgangis ar schawyn wont tobe quoy; Armyt men se thai stand at the first port. Bot than throw owt the inner palyce, at schort, With duylful scryke and walyng al is confoundit; The holl howsis ?owlit and resowndit For womentyng of ladeis and wemen— The clamour vpstrak to the starnys then. The woful moderis ran frayit on athir syde Ful lamentabil throw out the chawmeris wyde, Brasand the postis in armys, and durris cald, And feil syss with mowthis kyss thame wald. Instantly Pyrrus assail?eis with al his mycht, By naturale strenth of his fader the wight, That nowder closeris, nor barryt ?ettis stowt, Nor ?it the keparis may hald thame langar owt. Oft wyth the ram the port is schaik and duschit, Down bet ?et chekis and bandis al tofruschit. The way is maid by forss, and entre brokkyn; Grekis insprent, the formaste haue thai stokyn And slane with swordis; the large hald heir and thar Was fyllit full of Grekis our alquhar. Not sa fersly the fomy ryver or flude Brekkis our the bankis on spait quhen it is wode, And, with hys brusch and fard of watir brown, The dykis and the schoris bettis doun, Ourspredand croftis and flattis with his spait, Our al the feildis that thai may row a bayt, Quhil howsys and the flokkis flyttis away, The corn grangis and standand stakkis of hay. I saw my self thair Neoptolemus Mak fellon slauchtir, wod and furyus, And athir brodir of Atrides alswa. Eldmodir to ane hundreth thar saw I Hecuba, And Priamus at the altar quhar he stude, All our bysprent and sperklyt ful of blude Of sacryfice, quhamto he bet the fyre. Fyfty chawmeris held that rial syre Quhar warryn his gude dochteris, ladeis ?yng, Syk fayr beleif is lost of his ofspryng. The prowd gestis and durris gilt with gold Of barbary wark, and hungyn mony fold With richess and spul?e of seyr nationys, Sa far as from the fyre onbet adoune is The Grekis occupyis haly—al is tharis, Quhat so thame lyst tospil is nane that sparis.” Into this nixt cheptour ?e may attend Of Priam, kyng of Troy, the fatale end. “Peraventur of Priamus wald ?e speir Quhou tyd the chance. Hys fait, gif ?e lyst, heir: Quhen he the cite saw takyn and downbet, And of his palyce brokyn euery ?et, Amyd the secret closettis eik hys fays, The auld grayth, al for nocht, to hym tays Hys hawbryk quhilk was lang furth of vsage, Set on his schulderis trymlyng than for age; A sword but help about hym beltis he And ran towart hys fays, reddy to de. Amyd the closs, vnder the hevyn al bayr, Stude thar that tyme a mekil fair altare, Neyr quham thar grew a rycht ald lawrer tre Bowand towart the altare a litill wie, That with his schaddow the goddis dyd ourheld. Hecuba thyddir with hir childer for beild Ran al invane and about the altare swarmys, Brasand the godlyke ymage in thar armys, As for the storm dowis flokkis togidder ilkane. Bot quhen scho saw how Priamus has tane His armour, so as thocht he had beyn ?yng: ‘Quhat fulych thocht, my wrachit spowss and kyng, Movis the now syk wapynnys forto weld? Quhidder hastis thou?’ quod sche. ‘Of na sik beld Haue we now mystir, nor syk diffendouris as the, The tyme is nocht ganand tharto we se, In cace Hectour war present heir, my son, He mycht nocht succur Troy, for it is won, Quharfor I pray the syt doune and cum hydder And lat this altare salue wss al togidder, Or than atanys al heir lat ws de.’ Thus said scho and with sik sembland as mycht be Hym towart hir has brocht, but ony threte, And set the auld doune on the haly sete. Bot lo, Polytes, ane of Priamus sonnys Quhilk from the slauchter of Pyrrus away run is, Throw wapynnys fleyng and his ennemyss all, Be lang throwgangis and mony voyd hall; Woundit he was, and come to seik reskew. Ardently Pyrrus gan him fast persew, With grondyn lance at hand so neir furthstrekit, Almaist the hed hym twichit and arekit, Quhil at the last, quhen he is cummyn, I weyn, Befor his faderis and his moderis eyn, Smate hym down ded in thar sycht quhar he stude, The gaist he ?ald with habundans of blude. Priamus than, thocht he was halfdeill ded, Mycht nocht conteyn his ire nor wordis of fed, Bot cryis furth: ‘For that cruell offens And owtragyus fuyl hardy violens, Gif thar be piete in the hevin abone Quhilk takis heid to this at thou has done, The goddis mot condyngly the for?eld, Eftir thi desert rendring sik gayn?eld, Causit me behald myne awyn child slane, allace, And with hys blude fylit the faderis face. Bot he quhamby thou fenys thi self byget, Achil, was not to Priam sa hard set, For he, of rycht and faith eschamyt eik, Quhen that I come hym lawly tobeseik, The ded body of Hector rendrit me, And me convoyit hame to my cite.’ Thus sayand the ald waykly, but forss or dynt, A dart dyd cast, quhilk with a pyk gan stynt On his harness, and in the scheild dyd hyng But ony harm or other dammagyng. Quod Pyrrus, ‘Sen always thou saist swa, To Pellyus son, my fadir, thou most ga. Beir hym this message, ramembir weil thou tell Him al my warkis and dedis sa cruell— Schaw Neoptolemus is degenerit cleyn. Now salt thou de.’ And with that word in teyn The ald trymlyng towart the altare he drew, That in the hait blude of his son, sched new, Fundrit; and Pyrrus grippis hym by the hayr With his left hand, and with the tother albayr Drew furth his schynand swerd, quhilk in his syde Festynnyt, and onto the hyltis dyd he hyde. Of Priamus thus was the finale fait— Fortone heir endit his gloryus estait, Seand Ilion albyrn in fryis brown And Troys wallis fall and tumlyt down. That ryal prince, vmquhile our Asya Apon sa feil pepil and realmys alswa Ryngnyt in welth, now by the cost lyis ded Bot as a stok and of hakkit his hed, A corps but lyfe, renown or other fame, Onknawyn of ony wight quhat was his name.” Quhou Venus gan to Eneas appeir, And of his fader and other materis seyr. “Fyrst than the grysly dreid about me start: Astonyst I wolx, for sone prent in myne hart The ymage of my deir fader, quhen I The kyng his evyneild beheld sa cruelly By deidly wound ?aldand vp the spreit.

Na, na, nocht swa, I wyss, that sal scho nocht; And set it be nocht lovabill nor semly thocht To punyss a woman, bot schameful hir to sla, Na victory, bot lak, followyng alswa, ?it netheless I aucht lovit tobe Vengeans to tak on hir deservis to de.

Than terribil figuris apperis to my sycht Of gret goddis, semand with Troy agrevit; And tho beheld I al the cite myschevit, Fayr Illion all fall in gledis down, And, fra the soyll, gret Troy, Neptunus town, Ourtumlyt to the grond—so as ?he se The lauboreris into the montanys hie With steil axsis byssely hak and hew A mekil ayk that mony ?eir thar grew; The tre branglis bostyng to the fall, With top trymlyng, and branchis schakand all; Quhil finaly it get the lattyr straik, Than with a rair down duschis the mekil aik, And with his fard brekis down bewis about.

Fader, sen that we may na langar byde, Tak vp tha haly rellykis in thi hand, And our penates or goddis of this land— It war onleiffull and wykkitnes to me From sa gret slauchter, blude schedding and melle Newly departit, to twich thame, for the blude, Quhil I be weschyn into sum rynnand flude.’ And sayng thus, I spred my schulderis brayd, Syne our my nek, abuf the wedis, laid A ?allow skyn was of a fers lyoun, And tharapon gart set my fader down; Lytil Iulus grippis me by the hand, With onmeit payss his fader fast followand: Neir at our bak Crevse my spowss ensewys: We pass by secret wentis and quyet rewyss. And me, quhan laitly na wapyn, nor dartis kast, Nor press of Grekis rowtis maid agast, Ilke swowch of wynd and euery quhispir now And alkyn sterage affrayt, and causyt grow, Baith for my byrdyng and my litil mait. Quhen we war cummyn almaist to the ?et, And al danger we thocht eschapit neyr, A fellon dyn belyve of feit we heir; My fader than lukand furth throw the sky, Cryis on me fast, ‘Fle, son! fle, son, in hy, Thai cum at hand! Behynd me I gat a sycht Of lemand armour and schynand scheildis brycht.’ Thar knaw I nocht quhat fremmyt god onkynd So me astonyst, and reft fra me my mynd, For throu the secrete stretis fast I ran Befor the laif, as weil bekend man, Allace to me catyve! I wait neuer quhydder My spowss Crevse remanyt or we come thydder, Or by sum fait of goddis was reft away, Or gif scho errit, or irkit by the way, For nevir syne with eyn saw I hyr eft, Nor neuer abak, fra scho was lost or reft, Blent I agane, nor perfyte mynd has nummyn, Quhil to the mote of Ceres war we cummyn. And fynaly, quhen we beyn gadderit thidder, Fast by the haly tempil al togydder, Scho was away, and betrumpit suythly Hyr spowss, hir son and all the cumpany. Than wod for wo, so was I quyte myscaryit That nowder god nor man I left onwaryit: For quhat mair hard myschance, quhen Troy down fell, Apperit to me as that, or sa cruell? Ascanyus tho and my fader Anchises, And eik our Troiane goddis penates, Onto my feris betauch I for to keip And hyd thame darn within a valy deip. To town agane I sped with al my mycht, Claspit ful meit into fyne armour brycht, Wilful al aventuris newlyngis to assay, And forto serss Troy, euery streit and way, And eik my hed agane in perrell set. Bot first the wallis, the darn entre and ?et, Quharat we yschit furth, I seik agane, Haldyng bakwart ilk futstep we had gane, Lukand and sersand about me as I myght. The vgsumnes and silens of the nycht In euery place my spreit maid sayr agast. Fra thyne ontil our lugyng hame I past To spy perchance gif scho had thidder returnyt; It was with Grekis beset and hail ourturnyt, Alhail the howss with thame sa occupyit; Belyve the fyre al waistand I espyit Bless with the wynd; our the rufe, heir and thar, The flambe vpsprang and hait low in the ayr.” Quhou Eneas socht hys sposs, al the cost, And how to hym apperis hir gret gost. “To Priamus palyce eftyr socht I than, And syne onto the tempil fast I ran, Quhar at the porchis or clostir of Iuno, Than al bot waist, thocht it was gyrth, stude tho Phenix and dowr Vlixes, wardanys tway, Forto observe and keip the spreth or pray.

By schip thiddir our sey careit was I, Quhar, at the bayand costis syde of the see, Begouth I first set wallis of a cite, Althocht my foundment was mysfortunat: The toune I nemmyt efter myne estait And fra my name it clepit Eneadas. Onto my moder, of Dyona douchter was, Sacrifice I maid, and to the goddis all Quham for new warkis men happy helparis call; And to the kyng of hevinly wightis that tyde A quhite bull slew I by the costis syde. On cace, thar stude a litil mote neirby, Quhar hepthorn buskis on the top grew hie, And evin saplynnys of myrthus, the tre funerale. Thiddir I went, greyn bewis doune to haill, Hard by the grond myne altare forto dycht With burgyonys and with branchis al at rycht: A grysly takyn, feirful to tell, I se.

Tharfor, to Polidorus vp a beyr We erekkit, and of erd a gret fluyr Kest in a hepe abuf his sepultur; Syne, in ramembrance of the sawlis went, The dolorus altaris fast by war vpstent, Crownyt with garlandis al of haw sey hewis, And with the blaiknyt cypress dedly bewis.

The serymoneis endit, blyth and glaid To my fader per ordour al I said As ?e haue hard (quhat nedis tell agane?), And of this mater maid hym ful certane. Onone he knew our elderis dowtis ilk deill, And of our clan the dowbill stok full weill: He grantis the onkouth errour hym dissavit Of ancyant placis, quhilk he not persavit. Syne said he, ‘Son, thou irkit art algatis By the contrarius frawart Troiane fatis; Now I remembir only quhou Cassandra Ful oft maid mensioun of Hesperya And oft als of the realm hait Italy, Thir materis me declaring by and by.

Italy!’ fyrst cryis Achates, Syne al our feris of clamour mycht nocht cess, Bot with a voce atanys cryis, ‘Itaill!’ And hailsyng gan the land with hey and haill. Than my fader, ammyral of our flote, A mekil tankart with wyne fild to the throte, And tharon set a garland or a crown, And to the goddis maid this orysoun, Sittand in the hie eft castell of our schip, With ful devote reverens and wirschip: ‘O ?e’ quod he, ‘goddis haldis in pouste Weddir and stormys, the land eik and the se, Grant our vayage ane esy and reddy wynd, Inspyre ?our favouris that prospir courss we fynd.’ Scars this wes said quhen, evyn at our desyre, The sessonabil ayr pipis vp fair and schyre; The havyn apperis, and thiddir nerrar we draw, And of Mynerva the strang tempill saw Set in the castell apon ane hillis hycht. Our fallowis fangis in thar salys tyght, And towart the cost thar stevynnys dyd address. A port thar is, quham the est fludis hess, In maner of a bow, maid bowle or bay, With rochys set forgane the streym ful stay, To brek the salt fame of the seys stour. On athir hand, als hie as ony towr, The byg hewis strekis furth lyke a wall; Within the hawyn goith lown, but wynd or wall, And at the port the tempill may not be seyn. Heir fyrst I saw apon the plesand greyn A fatale takyn, fowr horssis quhite as snaw Gnyppand gresys the large feildis on raw. ‘Ha! lugyn land, batale thou ws pretendis,’ Quod my fader Anchiss, ‘for as weil kend is, Horssis ar dressit for the bargane feil syss; Weir and debait thir stedis signyfyiss. Bot, sen the sammyn four futtit bestis eik Beyn oft vsyt, ful towartly and meik, To draw the cart and thoil brydill and ren?e, It is gude hope pace follow sal,’ says he. Than wirschip we the godhed and gret mycht Of Pallas, with clattering harnes ferss in fyght, Quhilk heth ws first ressauyt glaid and gay: Our hedis befor the altar we array With valys brown, eftir the Troiane gyss, And onto Iuno of Arge our sacryfyss Maid reuerently, as Helenus vss bad, Obseruyng weil, as he commandyt had, The serymonys leill. Syne, but langar delay, Fra that perfurnyst was our offerand day, Onon the nokkis of our rays we writh; Down fallys the schetis of the salys swith; The Gregionys herbry and fronteris suspek We left behynd, and efter, in effek, Of Taurentum the fyrth we se but less (Biggit, as thai say, by worthy Herculess), And, our forgane the tother syde alsso, Rayss vp Lacynya the tempill of Iuno, Of Cawlon cite eik the wallys hie, And Scyllacium quhar schipbrokyn mony be. Syne, far of in the flude, we gan aspy The byrnand Ethna into Sycilly, And a fell rage rowting of the sey Alang way thens, and on the rolkis hie We hard the iawpys bete, and at the cost A hydduus brayng of brokyn seys bost— Apon schald bankis boldynnys hie the flude; The stowr vpbullyrris sand as it war wode. My fader than cryis, ‘Howe! feris, help away, Streke aris atanys with all the forss ?e may! No wondir this is the selkouth Caribdis; Thir horribbill rolkis and craggis heir, I wyss, Helenus the prophete ful weil dyd ws declare.’ The sammyn wyss as thai commandyt ware Thai dyd onon, and Pallynurus fyrst Hard halys the schete on syde, and fast gan thryst The forschip to the wallis and the tyde, Saland on bawburd towart the left syde; Towart the left, with mony heyss and haill, Socht all our flot fast baith with rowth and saill. The swelland swyrl vphesyt ws til hevyn; Syne wald the waw swak ws doun ful evyn, As it apperit, vnder the sey to hell. Thryss the holkyt craggis hard we ?ell, Quhar as the swelch had the rolkis thyrlyt; And thryss the fame furth spowt, that so hie quhirlyt It semyt watir the starnys, as we thocht. Be this the son went to, and ws forwrocht Left dissolat; the wyndis calmyt eik. We, not bekend quhat rycht courss mycht we seik, War warp to seywart by the outwart tyde Of Ciclopes onto the costis syde. The port quhamto we cappit wes ful large, And fra al wyndis blast for schip or barge Sovir al tyme, but netheless fast by The grisly Ethna dyd rummyll, schudder and cry, Sum tyme thrawing owt, heich in the skyis, The blak laithly smoke that oft dyd ryss As thunderis blast, and rekand as the pyk, With gledis sparkand as the hail als thik. Vpspring the blesis and fyry lumpis we se, Quhilk semyt forto lik the starnys hie; Sum tyme it rasyt gret rochys, and oft will Furth bok the bowellis or entralis of the hyll, And lowsyt stanys vpwarpys in the ayr Rownd in a sop, with mony crak and rayr: The stew of byrnand heyt law from the grond Vpstrikis thar, that doith to hevyn rebound. The rumour is doun thrung vndir this mont Enchelades body with thundir lyis half bront, And hydduus Ethna abufe his belly set. Quhen he lyst gant or blaw, the fyre is bet, And from that furnys the flambe doith brist or glide: Quhou oft he turnys our hys irkit syde All Sycil trymlys, quaking with a rerd, And vgly stew ourquhelmys hevyn and erd. That nycht, lurkand in woddis we remane, Of feirfull monstris sufferand mekil pane; Bot quhat causyt syk noyss na thing we saw, For nowthir lycht of planetis mycht we knaw, Nor the brycht poyll, nor in the ayr a starn, Bot in dyrk clowdis the hevynnys warpit darn; The moyn was vndir walk and gave na lycht, Haldyn ful dym throu myrknes of the nycht.” Of the Greik clepit Achemenydes Rehersyng Ene the natur of Ciclopes. “The secund day be this sprang fra the est, Quhen Aurora the wak nycht dyd arest And chayss fra hevyn with hir dym skyis donk; Than suddanly, furth of the woddis ronk, We se a strange man, of form onknaw— A lenar wight na mayr pynyt I ne saw, Nor ?it sa wrachitly beseyn a wy; Towart the cost, quhar that we stude in hy, Hys handis furth he strekis askand supple.

My fader Anchiss na ma wordis wald byde, Bot furthwith gaue that ?ong man his rycht hand, And assurys hys spreit with that presand; He at the last this dreid has done away, And on this wyss begouth to carp and say: ‘Of the realm Itachia I am, but less, And of the cumpany of fey Vlixes, And Achemenydes onto name I hait, Cummyn onto Troy with my fader of lait, Bot a puyr wageour, clepyt Adamastus— Wald God ?it the same forton remanyt to wss!

Allace, thy dolorus cayss and hard myschance! From blys to wo, fra sorow to fury rage, Fra nobylnes, welth, prudens and temperance, In brutell appetite fall, and wild dotage; Danter of Affryk, queyn foundar of Cartage, Vmquhil in rychess and schynyng gloyr ryngyng, Throw fulych lust wrocht thine awyn ondoyng. Lo! with quhat thocht, quhat byttyrnes and pane, Lufe onsylly bredis in euery wight! Quhou schort quhile doith hys fals plesance remane, Hys restless blyss how sone takis the flicht!

To stynt al thing salue thine awyn appetite So wes in lufe thi frawart destane— Allace the quhile thou knew the strange Ene! And sen I suld thy tragedy endyte, Heir nedis nane othir invocatioun: Be the command I lusty ladeis quhyte, Be war with strangeris of onkouth natioun Wyrk na syk woundris to thar dampnatioun; Bot til attayin wild amouris at the thai leir: Thy lusty pane begouth on this maneir. Heir endis the preambill and begynnys the ferd buke The thochtfull queyn, with mony amorus clawss Till hir systir complenys in luffis cawss.

Annes, I grant to the, sen the decess Of my sory husband Syche, but less, Quhar that our howss with brodyrris ded wes sprent, Only this man hess movit myne entent, And heth my mynd inducyt to forvay: I knaw and felis the wemmys and the way Of the ald fyre and flambe of luffis heit.

Quharfor the nedis beseik goddis of thar grace, With sacrifyce, tobe favorabil in this cace. Do set alhaill thi cure and diligence To causyng hym mak with the residence, And fen?e causys to tary hym and wythhald, So lang as thus, duryng the wyntir cald, The sey ragis throu watry Orion, And quhil the stormys be al our blawyn and gon; And quhil hys schippis, with the tempest schaik, Be bet, byd spair nowthir fyr, elm nor aik.” Dido enflambyt in the lusty heyt, With amorus thochtis trublys al hir spreit. Wyth thir wordys the spreit of Dido queyn, The quhilk tofor in lufe wes kyndlyt grene, Now al in fyre the flambe of lufe furth blesys; Hir doutsum mynd with gude hope so scho esys That al the schame and dreid wes blaw away; And to the tempill furth held tha baith tway.

Behald onhappy Dido of Cartage In this meyn sesson byrnyng hait as gleyd: The secrete wound deip in hir mynd gan spreyd, And of hoyt amouris the subtell quent fyre Waistis and consumys merch, banys and lyre. Our all the cite enragyt scho heir and thar Wandris, as ane strykkyn hynd, quhom the stalkar, Or scho persave, from far betis with hys flane Amyd the woddis of Creyt, and lattis remane The braid hed, onknaw the beste wass hyt; Scho skypping furth, as to eschew the byt, Gan throu the forest fast and gravys glyde, Bot evir the dedly schaft stykkis in hir syde. Sum tyme the queyn Ene with hir dyd leid Throu owt the wallys onto euery steid, The tresour al and richess of Sydony Schawyng to hym, and offerit al reddy The cite of Cartage at hys commandment: Begyn scho wald to tell furth hir entent, And in the myd word stop and hald hir styll. And quhen the evyn come, it wes hir will To seik ways hym to feste, as scho dyd ayr; And, half myndles, agane scho langis sayr For tyll enquyre and heir the sege of Troy, And in a stair behaldis hym for ioy. Eftir all wes voydyt, and the licht of day Ay mair and mair the moyn quynchit away, And the declynyng of the starris brycht To sleip and rest persuadis euery wight, Within hir chalmyr alane scho langis sayr, And thocht al waist for lak of hir luffar. Amyd a voyd bed scho hir laid adoun, And of hym absent thinkis scho heris the sown; Hys voce scho heris, and hym behaldis sche, Thocht he, God wait, far from hir presens be: And sum tyme wald scho Ascanyus, the page, Caucht in the figur of hys faderis ymage, And in hir bosum brace, gif scho tharby The lufe ontellabill mycht swik or satisfy. The wark and wallys begun ar not vpbrocht, The ?onkeris dedis of armys excersis nocht, Nothir fortress nor turettis suyr of weir Now graith tha mair, for al the wark, but weir, Cessis and is stoppyt, baith of pynnakillis hie, And byg towris, semyt to ryss in the skie. Tyl Venus carpys Iuno the goddess, And of thar spech and sermond, mar and less. Alsswyth as Iuno, with syk maleyss ourtane, Persauyt hir deir frend that remeid was nane, Nothir fame ne honour the rage resyst mycht, Saturnus douchtir with syk wordis on hyght Begouth to carp onto Venus, I wyss: “A huge honour and lawd ?e sal of this Raport, and richt large spul?e beir away, Thou and thi child forsuyth”, quod scho, “bath tway: O Lord, quhou gret power and notabil mycht, Gif that, of twa hie goddis throu the slycht, A sylly woman sal ourcummyn be!

Lat ws thir pepill to ws common, for thy, Be frendly favouris govern equaly; So that it lesum be Dido remane In spousage bund, and serve a lord Troiane, And suffir Tirreanys, and al Lyby land, Be geif in dowry to thi son in hand.” Than Venus (knawing hir spech of fen?eit mynd, To that effect scho mycht the Troiane kynd, And werys tocum furth of Itail alsswa, With hald and kepe from boundis of Lybia) Answerd and sayd: “Quhat wikkyt wyght wald euer Refuyss syk proffyr, or ?yt with the had levir Contend in bataill or stand at debait, Gif that, as thou rehersis, the deid algait Als sovirly mycht follow fortunabill?

Eneas and onsilly Dido, baith tway, To forest grathis in huntyng furth to wend, To morow, als fast as Titan doith ascend And our the warld gan hys bemys spreid. Quhen that the rangis and the faid on breid Dynnys throu the gravys, sersyng the woddis wyde, And setis set the glen on euery syde, I sal apon thame a myrk schour down skaill Of weit and wynd, mydlit with fellon haill, And al the hevyn with thundyrris blast sa steir That all thar falloschip sall withdraw for feir Enclosyt with a myst als dyrk as nycht. Dido and eik the Troiane duke full rycht, Alanerly, bot be thame selvyn twane, Togiddir sal entir in a cave of stane: Thar sal I be reddy, and, but delay, Gif thi mynd be ferm tharto the ilk day, In sovir wedlok I sal conioyn hir thar, Tobe his propir spouss for euermair: Apon this wyss thar wedding salbe wrocht.” Affermys all hir wil, contrarying nocht, Of Cetheron Venus the goddes brycht, Lauchyng scho fund had so controvit a slycht. Quhou that the queyn to huntyng raid at morow, And of the first day of hir ioy and sorow. Furth of the sey, with this, the dawyng spryngis. As Phebus rayss, fast to the ?ettis thringis The choss gallandis, and huntmen thame besyde, With ralys and with nettys strang and wyde, And huntyng sperys styf with hedis braid; From Massilyne horsmen thik thiddir raid, With rynnyng hundis, a full huge sort. Nobillys of Cartage, hovand at the port, The queyn awatys that lang in chawmyr dwellys; Hyr ferss steyd stude stampyng, reddy ellys, Rungeand the fomy goldyn byt gynglyng; C marginal note Gnyppand. Of gold and pal wrocht hys rych harnasyng. And scho at last of palyce yschit owt, With huge men?e walking hir abowt, Lappyt in a brusyt mantill of Sydony, With gold and perle the bordour al bewry, Hyngand by hir syde the cayss with arowis grund; Hir bricht tressis envolupyt war and wond Intil a quayf of fyne gold wyrin threid; The goldyn button claspyt hir purpour weid— And furth scho passyt with all hir cumpany. The Troiane pepill forgaderit by and by, Ioly and glaid the fresch Ascanyus ?yng, Bot first of all, maist gudly, hym self thar kyng Enee gan entir in falloschip, but dout, And onto thame adionyt hys large rowt. Lyke quhen Apollo list depart or ga Furth of hys wyntring realm of Lysya, And leif the flude Exanthus for a quhile, To vissy Delos, his moderis land and ile, Renewand ryngis and dansys, mony a rowt; Mixt togiddir, hys altaris standing about, The pepil of Creit, and thame of Driopes, And eik the payntit folkis Agathirces, Schowtand on thar gyss with clamour and vocis hie: Apon thi top, mont Cynthus, walkis he, Hys wavand haris, sum tyme, doyng doun thryng With a soft garland of lawrer sweit smellyng, And vmquhile thame gan balmyng and enoynt And into gold address at full gude poynt, Hys grundyn dartis clattering by hys syde— Als fresch, als lusty dyd Eneas ryde, With als gret bewte in hys lordly face. And eftyr thai ar cummyn to the chace, Amang the montanys in the wild forest, The rynnyng hundis of cuppillys sone thai kest, And our the clewys and the holtis, belyve, The wild beistis doun to the dail thai dryve. Lo! thar the rays, rynnyng swyft as fyre, Drevyn from the hyghtis, brekkis out at the swyre; Ane othir part, syne ?ondyr mycht thou se The herd of hartis with thar hedis hie, Ourspynnerand with swyft courss the plane vaill, The hepe of duste vpstowryng at thar taill, Fleand the hundis, levand the hie montanys. And Ascanyus, the child, amyd the planys, Ioyus and blith hys startling steid to assay, Now makis hys rynk ?ondir, and now this way Now prekis furth by thir and now by thame, Langyng, amang faynt frayt beistis ontame, The fomy bair, doun from the hyllis hycht, Or the dun lyoun discend, recontyr he mycht. In the meyn quhile, the hevynnys al about With fellon noyss gan to rummyll and rowt. A bub of weddir followyt in the tayll, Thik schour of rayn myddillit ful of haill. The Tyriane men?e skalis wydequhar, And al the gallandis of Troy fled heir and thar, And eik with thame the ?ong Ascanyus, Nevo to Kyng Dardan and to Venus. For feir, to diuerss stedis throu the feildis, Thai seik to haldis, howsis, hyrnys and beildis: The ryveris rudly ruschit our hillis bedene. Within a cave is entrit Dido queyn, And eik the Troiane duke, al thame alane, By aventur, as thai eschewyt the rane. Erth, the first moder, maid a takyn of wo, And eik of wedlok the pronuba Iuno, And of thar cuplyng wittering schew the ayr: The flambe of fyreslaucht lychtnyt heir and thar And on the hillys hie toppis, but less, Sat murnand nymphis, hait Oreades. This wes the formaste day of hir glaidnes And first morrow of hir wofull distress. For nother the fasson nor the maner sche Attendis now, nor fame ne honeste, Ne from thens furthwart Dido ony mor Musis on lufe secrete, as of befor, But clepis it spousage, and with that fayr name Clokyt and hyd hir cryme of oppyn schame. Of Fame that monstre, and Kyng Hyarbas fury And how fra Iove wes send the god Mercury. The fame heirof, belyve, gan walx and spreid Throu cheif citeis of all Affrik on breid: Fame is myscheif, quham na harm vndyr the lyft In motioun nor sterage is mair swyft. Movand scho growis, and, passand our alquhar, Hir strenth encressis and walxis mair and mayr. Lytil, for feir, the fyrst tyme semys sche, Sone eftir rysys to the starnys on hie; Apon the grond scho walkis fra sted to sted, And vp amang the clowdis hydis hyr hed. Throu greif of goddis commovyt, and nocht glaid, Erth, the gret moder, bayr this child, as is said, Last systir to Ceyos and Enchelades, Ane huge, horribill and strange monstre, but less, Spedy of fut, and on weyngis swyft as wynd. Quhou mony fedderis bene on hir body fynd, Als mony walkryfe eyn lurkis thar vndir, Als feil tongis, that for totell is wondir, With als feil mouthis carpis sche and beris, Als mony hess scho prik vpstandand eris. By nycht scho fleys amyd the hevyn throu owt, Circuland the schaddow of the erth about With huge fard, nother cuyr gevand nor keip Hir eyn anys to rest nor tak a sleip; Al day scho syttis, wachand byssely, Apon the top of nobillis howsis, to spy, Or on thir princis palyce with towris hie, And with hir noyss gret citeis affrays sche— Als weil ramembring fen?eit and schrewit sawys As scho the treuth and verite furth schawis. Thys ilke wensch, that tyme, with mony a taill, Glaidly this rumour gan throu the pepill skaill, Telland the thing wrocht, and not wrocht, togiddir; Quhou of the Troiane blude wes cummyn thiddir Ene, with quham the fair Dido be wed Dedenyt, and as husband go to bed; And how the wyntir sesson betwix thame tway Thai spend in lang reffell, lust and play, Of thar realmys na thing remembring, In fowle delyte ybond by Cupyd kyng. Thys menskless goddes in euery mannys mouth Skalys thir newis est, west, north and sowth. Hir courss, onon, but langar tarying, Addressys scho ontill Hyarbas kyng, With hir sawis his mynd inflambyng as fyre, Prouokand hym to wreth and fellon ire. To Amon he wes son, beget alswa Apon the maid revist Garamantida; Within his large realmys huge braid Ane hundreth tempillis to Iupiter he maid, Ane hundreth altaris, quharon the walkryfe fyre He dedicate, altymys byrnand schyre, Set wachis in honour of goddis perpetuelly, Of beistis blude the fat grond nevir dry, Strowit with garlandis and flowris of diuerss kynd. This ilke kyng, wod wroith, half owt of mynd, And for thir schrewyt rumouris sor ammovit, In presens of the goddis quhilk he luffit, Befor the altar, to Iupiter, as thai say, Hevand vp handis, devotly thus gan pray: “Almychty Iove”, quod he, “quhamto, feill syss, On brusyt beddis hie fest and sacryfyss Of Mawrusya the pepill hantis thus, Offeryng to the the honour of Bachus, Consideris thou this? or quhidder, fader, gif we For nocht the dredis, quhen thou lattis thundir fle?

And, with the weyngit solys of hys feyt, As he of Cartage fyrst tred on the streyt, Eneas foundand towris he gan aspy, And garrand beild new lugyngis byssyly: Belt he wes with a swerd of mettale brycht Of quham the scawbart with brown iasp wes pight; His rych array dyd our hys schuldris hyng, Bet of a purpour claith of Tyre glittering, Fettysly stykkit with prynnyt goldyn thredis; Of mychty Didois gift wrocht all his wedis. Mercur recontris hym and said onon: “Of Cartage now the prowd wallis of stone Thou foundis,” quod he, “and biggis at al devyce A cite, excersyt intill a wyfis seruyce, Thyne awyn materis and realm for?etting, allace! Hiddir onto the, from his bricht hevynly place, The governour of goddis heth me sent, Quhilk rewlys at will erd, hevyn and elyment; He bad me throw the skyis bair this charge: Quhat beildis thou heir in Lyby or Cartage? Or to quhat fyne or beleif takis on hand To waist thi tyme into this fremmyt land? Gif that na lavd ne honour move the list Of sa hie thingis as ar to the promyst, Nor thi selvyn thou wil not occupy To purchess thine awyn renown ne glory, ?yt than behald Ascanyus vpwalxing, And the gret hope of his seid and ofspring, Quhamtil the realm and kynryk of Itaill, With Romys boundis, beyn destinate, sans faill.” On syk wyss thus carpys Mercuryus, And in the myddis of his sermond, thus, He vanyst far away, I wait nevir quhar, Furth of this mortale syght, in the schyre ayr. Quhou Eneas hym grathys to depart To quhom Dido heir carpys with sayr hart. Bot than Ene half mad and dum stude als, Vpstart his hair, the voce stak in his hals. Sayr he langis to fle and to depart; And that sweit cuntre, on the tother part, To leif ful laith wes hym, or go at large. Astonyst he wes to syt sa hie a charge— Or dysobey the gret godis beheste (Allace! quhat suld he do? oneth he wist); Or with quhat wordis suld he now assay The amorus queyn forto requir and pray; Or on quhat wyss hys taill he mycht begyn; Baith to and fra compasyng, hys breist within, Feill purpossys for euery part about. And, at the last, thus as he stude in dout, Thys resson hym semyt fynaly the best: He callys to hym Mynestheus and Sergest And strang Cloanthus, and bad thai suld in hy Do graith hys schyppys and navyn secretly, And gaddir hys folkis towart the cost togydder, Armour and al thyng necessar bring thyddir, And to dissymyll, gif ony axit quhy Thai thus addressyt thar geyr sa suddanly. Hym self, he said, the meyn quhile, suld assay To purches leif to pass and go away, And wait hys tyme to speke tharof maist habill, Quhen that the queyn Dido, maist honorabil, Suld not beleif sa sone he kouth depart, Nor sa gret luf dissyvir mycht be na art. At hys command thai al glaidly furth went And bissely begouth speid hys entent. Bot sone the queyn persavyt al the slycht— Quhay may begile a luffer, day or nycht? Thar departing at hand fyrst scho aspyis, Dredyng all sovir thing, as is the gyss Of euery luffar altyme to stand in feir. This ilke cursyt Fame we spak of eyr Bair to the amorus queyn noyss and gan rown, “The schippis ar grathand, to pass thai mak thaim boun.” Quharfor, inpacient and myndles in hir rage, Scho wyskis wild throu the town of Cartage, Syk wyss as quhen thir nunnys of Bachus Ruschis and relis our bankis, brays and buss, Quhen, euery thryd ?eir, on thar payane gyss, Thar goddis feist thai hallow with lowd cryis, That, al the nycht, the mont of Cytheron Resoundis of thar clamour, quhar thai gone. And at the last, ?it thus, of hir fre will, Eftir lang musyng, scho spak Eneas tyll: “With dissymulance wenyt thou, onfaithfull wight, Thou mycht haue hyd fra me sa fals a slycht, And, myne onwyttyng, steill furth of my land? That nothir our gret lufe, promys, nor rycht hand Gevyn me vmquhile, may the heir withhald, Nor cruel deth of Didois corss so cald! Gif thou depart (and forthir quhat wald thou do, In wyntir sesson press graith thi navy, lo!) And the address to pass throu the wod see, Myd tyme quhen stormys and wyndis blaw maist hie— Art thou sa cruel?

Quhat! wilt thou fle from me? allace! allace! Be all thir teris trygland our my face, And be that rycht hand vmquhile thou me gave (Sen to my self nocht ellis left I have, Now wrachit catyve), be our treuth plychting eyk, And be our spowsage begunnyn, I the beseik, Gif euer ony thank I deservit towart the, Or ocht of myne to the wes leif”, quod sche, “Haue mercy of our lynnage reddy to spill; Gif tyme remanys ?yt thou heir prayeris will, This fremmyt mynd, I pray ?ou, do away. For the I haue beyn hatyt, this mony a day, With all the pepill of Affrik, and with the kyng That rewlys the land of Numyda and ryng; For the myne awyn Tyrianys ar with me wraith; For the is womanheid went and wirschip baith, And my first fame, lavd and renownye, Quharby I wes rasyt to the starnys hie.

Bot, at the leist, tofor thi wayfleyng, Had I a child consavyt of thyne ofspryng, Gif I had ony ?ong Eneas small, Befor me forto play within my hall, Quhilk representit by symylitude thi face, Than semyt I nocht, thus wyss, allace! allace! Aluterly dissauyt nor dissolate.” Thus said the queyn Dido, in febil estate. Bot, apon Iovis message fermly he Stude musyng so, he movit nocht ane e, Refrenyt his will, hydand in hart his thocht, And, at the last, thir few wordis hess furth brocht: “O gentil queyn, that sall I nevir deny, Thy gude deid and desart is mair worthy Than thou with wordis or tong may expreme; Nor it sal nevir me irk, na ?yt mysseym, The worthy Dido to hald in fresch memory, So lang as that my self remembir may I, Or quhil the spreit of lyfe this body steris.

Als oft as day is gone, and the dyrk nycht With hir donk schaddow hydis of the erth the sycht, Als oft as schynyng starnys doith vpryss, My faderis gost, Anchises, als feil syss Into my sleip mannasis me tharto fast, And oft his feirfull ymage doith me agast; And in lyke wyss the child Ascanyus, Quhais deir hed suffir iniurys is hard to ws, Quham of the realm of Itail I defraud, And fra the grond to hym promyst withhawd. Be athir of our hedis this I sweir; Now laitly eik of goddis the messynger, From hie Iupiter in hasty message sent, Down throu the ayr brocht the ilk commandment: On fair day lycht, myne awyn self dyd I se Mercur the god entyr in this cite, And his wordis with thir sam eris hard I. With thy complayntis ony langar, forthy, Lat be to vex me, or thy self to spyll, Sen I seik nocht to Itale with fre will.” Of the scharp wordys Queyn Dydo dyd say, And how Eneas bownys fast away. Dydo, aggrevit ay quhil he his tayl tald, With acquart luke gan towart hym behald, Rollyng vmquhile hir eyn, now heir, now thar, With syght onstabil waverand our alquhar, And all enragyt thir wordis gan furth braid: “Nothir wes a goddes thy moder, as is sayd, Nor ?yt Kyng Dardanus cheif stok of thi kyn, Thou treuthless wyght, bot of a cald, hard quhyn The clekkyt that horribill mont, Cawcasus hait— Thou sowkyt nevir womanis breist, weil I wait, Bot of sum cruel tygir of Araby The pappis the fosterit in the wod Hyrcany.

Bot ?yt, althocht the reuthful Eneas The dolorus queyn to meyss ful bissy was, To do hir comfort, and hir dyseyss asswage, And with hys wordis return hir sad curage, Bewalyng mekill hyr sorow and distress, Proplexte in mynd by gret lufe; netheless, The command of the goddis, by and by, He execut, and vysseys hys navy. Than byssely the Troianys fell to wark, And mony gret schyp, ballyngar and bark Langis the cost brocht in and bet full weill. Now fletis the mekil holk with tallonyt keyll.

Be than the auld Meneyt our schipburd slyde, Hevy, and al his weid sowpyt with seys, Skars from the watir grond vpboltyt he is, Syne swymmand held onto the craggis hycht, Sat on the dry rolk, and hym self gan dycht.

Than, rowmyng to and fra hys schyp our all, Mynestheus gan hys feris exhort and call: “Now, now, ?e vailliant feris of worthy Hector, Hail stoutly vp ?our arys; thynk on ?our glor; Thynk quhou, the lattir rewyne of Troy, ?ou I Haue walyt, and brocht with me in cumpany.

Do lat thame bruke the mastry and the pryce, Quhamto Neptune lyst grant at hys devyce. Bot gret lak war to return altharlast: Deir frendis, defend ?ou fra that kankyrryt kast, And do ourset sa schaymful hard myschance!” With al thar forss than at the vtyrance, Thai pynglyt arys vptobend and haill, With sa strang rowthis apon athir wail, The mychty karvell schuddryt at euery straik, Down swakand fludis vndir hyr brayd bilge of aik; So clappys the braith in breistis with mony pant, Quhil in thar dry throtis the aynd worth skant, And swait down triglys in stremys our alquhar. Betyd a chance that ilk tyme fell thame fair, And grantyt thame that honour tha desyryt; For as Serfest, with fers muyde half enfyryt, Turnyt hys stevyn towart the rolk our neir, Ontil a wykkyt place hys schip dyd steir, Quhil on the blynd craggis, myschewsly, Fast stykkis scho, choppand hard quhynnys inhy, And on the scharp skelleis, to hir wanhap, Smait with syk fard, the arys in flendris lap; Hir forschip hang, and sum deil scoryt throu owt.

And fyrst Sergest behynd sone left hess he, Wreland on skelleys and ondepys of the see, With brokkyn aris lerand to haist agane, And cryand, “Help!” bot that was al invane.

Quhou Eneas onto the maryneris Gaif euery man thar reward, as efferis. Anchises son Eneas than, ful wyss, Callys thame forrowth hym al, as wes the gyss, And, with ane harraldis lowd voce, gan declare Cloanthus victour was, and on hys hair Gart set a crown, was of the lawrer greyn, And bad onto thar schippis bair bedeyn Thre ?ong oxin onto euery barge, Presandis of wyne, and of siluer a charge.

Now, hand to hand, the dynt lychtis with a swak; Now bendis he vp hys burdon with a mynt, On syde he bradis fortil eschew the dynt; He etlys ?ondir hys avantage to tak, He metis hym thar, and charris hym with a chak; He watis to spy, and smytis in al hys mycht, The tother keppys hym on hys burdon wycht; Thai foyn at othir, and eggis to bargane. Lychtar on fute and agil was the tane And in hys lusty ?outh sum deil ensuris; The tother of lymmys byggar and corss mair stuyr is, Bot hys faynt schankis gan for eild schaik; Hys gowsty cost and membris, euery straik, The febil braith gan to bete and blaw. Thir hardy kempys, al in waist, leyt draw, Athir at other, mony rowtis grete; On holl sydis feill dowbill dyntis gan bete And on thar breistis lychtis with huge sownd; Oft in the ayr about thar hedis rownd Thar handis waveryt, and the straik went myss; Hard halffettis clappyt oft vndir the dynt, I wyss. Entellus standis styf and grave of corss, Not movyng from hys fyrst stand in a forss, And, with hys body only and walkryfe e, The strakis onfar enchewys and keppyt he. Bot Darhes walkis about rycht craftely, Of hys fyrst purposs frustrat, to espy Sum avantage, with diuerss assaltis algait Hym ombesetting sair and handland hait— Lyke as by gret engynys quha sa wald A strang cite assail or stalwart hald, To wyn that strenth, or ?yt by craftis sle To mynde the castell on the rochys hie, Lurkand in harness wachis round about; Now this tocome, now by that way gan lowt, Quhar best he may cum to hys purposs sone, Avysand weil the place maist oportone. Entellus raxit hym and hevis on hycht Hys rycht hand for tosmyte in al hys mycht; The tother, seand the dynt cum, gan provide To eschew swyftly, and sone lap on syde, That al hys forss Entellus gan apply Into the ayr, so that hys grave body, All hym alane, with huge weght and sayr, Ruschyt flatlyngis to the grond with a rair— So as, quhilum, the mekil kosch fyr tre, On Erymanthus the mont of Archade, Or in the wod of Ida, with a sownd Vp by the rutis rent, ruschis to grond. The ?ongkeris tho of Troy and Sycilly Gan starting all on fut delyvirly; The clamour rayss, quhil all the hevyn dyd ryng, And fyrst to hym ran Acestes the kyng, And for compassioun hess vphynt in feild Hys frend Entellus, onto hym evyn eild. Bot, nother estonyst nor abasyt heiron, Mair egyrly the vaillyant campion Agane to bargane went als hoyt as fyre. Hys strenthys now encressis al of ire; For schame, alsso, and for that weil he knew Hys auld prowes, hys forss dowblyt and grew, And ardently, with fury and mekil boist, Gan Darhes kach and dryve our al the cost; Now with the rycht hand, now with the left hand, he Dowblys dyntis, and but abaid leyt fle, That nother rest nor quyet may he tak. Als fast as rayn schour rappys on the thak, So thyk with strakis this campioun maist strang, With athir hand, feil syss at Darhes dang, And drave to and fra with mony rowt. The prynce Eneas than, seand this dowt, Na langar suffer wald sik wreth procede Nor ferss Entellus mude thus rage and sprede, Bot of the bargane maid end but delay, And wery Darhes hess withdrawyn away. With wordys hym to mesyng thus he said: “Onsylle wight, quhou dyd thi mynd invaid Sa gret wodness? Felys thou not ?yt,” quod he, “Othir strenth and mannys forss hes delt with the? Seys thou not weil thi self at thou art fey? Tharfor to God thou ?eild the and obey; The power of goddys ar turnyt in thy contrar; Obey to God.” And with that word, but mair, The bargane he dissolvyt. And than Darhess Hys trew compan?eonys ledis of the press, Harland hys wery lymmys dolf as led, For sorow schakand to and fra hys hed, And schaddis of blude furth spyttand throu hys lyppys, With bludy gammys, led hym to thar schippys; The helm and eik the sword with thame hess tane, As thai commandyt war, and left alane The bul ontil Entellus—sa was defynd. He victour than, and abufe in hys mynd, Prowd and reiosyt of this bull, gan say: “Son of the goddes, and Troianys, I ?ou pray, Behald, and knaw by this takyn and syng, Quhat strenth was in my corss quhen I was ?yng. Se fra quhat ded Darhes is savyt onslane,” Quod he, and standand the bullys face forgane, Quhilk of thar dereyn was the pryce and gre, Hys stern burdon behynd hys bak onhie With hys rycht hand gan tayss and mesour swa, It smait hym evyn betwix the hornys twa, Persyt the harn pan, draif out the brayn inhy; Down duschit the beist ded on the land gan ly, Sprewland and flekkyrand in the ded thrawys. And he abufe hym furth warpys syk sawys: “For Darhes ded, Erix, lo, this,” quod he, “A far mair ganand sawle, I offer the; And victour eyk my craft and wapynnys fair Vprendris heir, for now and evir mair.” Into this nixt cheptour ?e may espy Nyse craft of schotyng and of archery. Onon Eneas induce gan to the play, With arowys forto schute quha wald assay; The pryce tharfor ordanys; and syne, but let, With forss of mennys handis vp hess set Amyd the greyn Sergestus schippys mast; Apon the top tharof gart fessyn fast A fleand dow intil a cord, quharat Thai suld thar arowys schuyt.

Nixt scharp Mynestheus, war and avysye, Onto the hed hess halyt vp on hie Baith arow and eyn, etland at the mark. Bot it was reuth, the fowle, for al hys wark, Ne mycht he twich; and netheless ?yt quyte The bandis and lyamys in twa dyd he smyte, Quharwith, by baith the feyt, thar fast was sche Attachit at the mastis top onhie; Sche in the ayr and dyrk skyis flaw onon.

Acestes now alane stude all reddy To schute, quhen that the pryce was tynt and won; And netheless to schuyt he hess begun, And threw ane arow in the ayr on hycht, Schawand hys craft, and hys byg bowys mycht, That lowsyt of the takill with a spang. And sone betyd and in thar sychtis sprang A fellon grysly monstre and wondryng, As weil was knaw syne at the endyng; The feirfull spa men tharof pronosticate Schrewyt chancis to betyde and bad estate. For quhy, this schaft, fleand in the moyst ayr, Brynt in a bless, and the randoun alquhar With low and flambys gan do notyfy, And al consumyt vanyst in the sky, As doys oft starnschoit fallyng fra the hevyn, Drawand thar eftyr a taill of fyry levin. Estonyst in thar myndis, abasyt stude The folk of Sycill and all the Troiane blude; And netheless maist douchty Eneas Reffusyt nocht the takyn, bot gan embrass Acestes glaidly, and rych gyftis hym gave, Syne said hym thus: “Tak, fader myne, ressaue Sik favorabill aspectis benevolent As the gret kyng of hevyn heth to the sent, That lyst with onkouth syngnys honour the.

Than al tha folk quhilk list bide in that land, For this new cite titil thai and writis; The matronys first, and sik as nocht delytis Nor hess in cure desyre of hie renoun, Thai deput, and thai ordand for this town. Thar hechis and thar ourloftis syne thai beit, Plankis and gestis gret, squair and meit, Into thar schippis ionand with mony a dynt, In sted of thame war with the flambys brynt; Thar cabillis new, and thar hed towis reparis, And gan to forge newly wrayngis and ayris. In numbir war thai bot a few men?e, Bot thai war quyk and vailliant in melle. In the meyn tyme, Eneas with a pleuch The cite circulit, and merkit be a seuch; By cavillys syne the tenementis dyd depart; Heir ordanys Ilion, and, in ?ondir art, Of Troy commandis beld othir memoriallis. Of this new cite and thir frendly wallis Glaid wolx Troiane Acestes, and, but mair, Did mak proclame thar merkattis and thar fair, And all the hedismen gadderis and set doun, Stabillis thar lawys and statutis for that town. Syne, on the top of Erix the montane, Full neir the lift, thai found, of marbill stane, A tempil to Venus of Idalia, And about Anchiss sepultur alssua Ane hallowit schaw on breid as sanctuar Plantit thai haue and stabillit prestis thar. Eneas gan depart, and quhou Venus Maid for hir son request to Neptunus. Be this hass al the pepil, euery hyne, The feste continewit fully days nyne, And on the altaris, as was tho the gyss, Thar offerandis endit and hie sacrifice. The stabil ayr hass calmyt weill the see, And sowtht pipand wyndis fair on hie Challancis to pass on burd and tak the deip. Bot quhen thai moste depart, lord, quhou thai weip! Quhat huge waling rayss all the costis bay! Brasand and halshand thai dwel al nycht and day. And now thai moderis and thai onweldy men, Quhom til, vmquhile, forto behald and ken The seys figur was abhominabill And eyk the forss tharof intollerabill, Now wald thai wend, for all the seys rage, Reddy to thoill al travale in vayage; Quhom curtas Eneas with wordis frendly Comfortis, and syne, wepand full tendirly, Betaucht ontil Acest his cousing deir. Thre velys tho, as was the auld maneir, In wirschip of Erix he bad down quell, And a blak ?owe to god of tempestis fell; Syne chargit hail thar cabillis vp belyve. Hys awin hed warpit with a snod olyve, Heich in a schippis forcastell dyd stand, Haldand a cowpe of gold intil hys hand, The bestis entralis in the see can swak, And ?et the cleir wyne furth in fludis brak. From the eft schip vprays onone the wynd And followit fast the see fararis behynd; Eyk al the flote smate fast with arys the flude, Kempand to welt our wallys as thai war wode. In the meyn sesson Venus, al onflocht, Amyd hir breist reuoluand mony a thocht, Spak to Neptune with sik petuus regrate: “Neptune,” quod scho, “the fel ire and consate Of Queyn Iuno, with mynd insaciabill, Constrenys me to condiscend thus stabill In all maner of request and prayeris; The quhilk Iuno nowdir lang days nor ?eris, Nor na divyne sacrifice, may appless; Scho restis nevir, nor may scho leif at eyss, Albeit the power and charge of Iupiter Resistis scho wait, and fatis ar hir contrar. Scho thinkis it nocht eneuch and sufficient By wikkit malice to downbet and schent And for euer put to distructioun Master of the pepil of Frigia, Troys town, And fortobe wrokin, be alkin panys, Apon thar sary levingis and remanys; Bot euer in ane ?it stil persewis sche The ded banys and cald assys to spul?e Of silly Troy, quhilk is to rewyne brocht. A wondyr quhou scho may, intil hir thocht, Of sa gret furour half the causys consaue! Thi self is witnes quhou, laitly, our the laif, Sa masterful storm amyd the Libiane see Scho rasit sone, quhil vp to hevynnys hie The fludis kachit war, and sair opprest, Throu help of Eolus wyndis and tempest— Sa gret wrang in thi realme durst scho excerss! O this detestabil wikkitnes to reherss! Lo, hes scho nocht, newlingis, sa schamefully, The Troiane matronys maid byrn thar navy, By hir wod rage? and ar, for falt of schippis, In onkouth land left from thar falloschippis? In tyme cummyng, I the beseik,” quod sche, “Schaw thi mychtis, that salfly throu the see It may be leifful thai thar salys set: Grant at thai may alsso atteyn, but let, The flude Tybir, throu Lawrent feildis slydis, Admyt myne askyn, gif so the fatis gydis, Or gif that my desyre may grantit be, Or ?it werd sisteris list geif thame that cuntre.” Saturnus son Neptunus tho, I wyss, That of the deip see fludis dantar is, Ansuerit and said: “Citherea the fair, It is resson, and ganand euermair, Thou be assurit to rest at thi lyking In my boundis and throw out al my ryng, Quharfra thou hess thi first original, As thi kynd grund and cuntre natural. In othir placis als, furth of my land, I haue deseruit thankis at thi hand, And oft tyme hess sa gret curage, thou knawis, Dantit baith of see and bustuus wynd at blawis. To witnes draw I of this at I say, Exanth and Symois, Troiane fludis tway, That I na less cuyr tuke of thine Ene, To salue him on the land, than on the see. For quhen the ferss Achil persewit sair, Chasand affrayt Troianys heir and thar, The gret rowtis to the wallis thrymland, Tofor his face half ded for feir trymland, And mony thousandis on the grund layd ded, The ryveris dittit with ded corpsys wolx rede, Vndir bodeis bullyrrand; for sik multitude Of slauchtir he maid, quhil Exanthus the flude Mycht fynd na way to ryn onto the see; Than, apon cace, with Achillis Ene Matchit in fecht, nowdir of strenth or mycht Equale be far, nor ?it sa weil at rycht Favorit of the goddis as Achillis, perfay, By a dyrk clowd I staw thi son away; Quhoubeit, the ilk tyme, my desyre was set Law fra the grond al Troy forto down bet, Tha maynsworn wallis biggit with my handis. As twichand Ene, quhou evir the chance standis, The sammyn wyss ?it perseueris my mynd: Haue thou na dreid, I salbe ?it als kynd. Onto tha havynnys he sal cum sovirly, As thou desyris, and furthir him eyk sal I Ontil Avern, clepit the louch of hell. Ane sal alanerly be loste, I the tell, Quham thou sal seik amang the fludis, dede; For help of mony thar salbe gevin a hede.” Eftir that with sik wordis Neptunus Had mesit the mude of the goddes Venus, Tho kan this fader of the see, but mair, Hys horssis ?ok to draw his cart or chair, With fomy bridill danting tha ferss bestis; Thar ren?eis and thetys, at thame arestis, With hys awin handys leit do slyp and slakkis, And lichtly our the fludis croppis frakkis Hys watry chair, furth fleand with a sownd, Quhil al the wallis dowkis to the grownd; Vndir the brayand quhelis and assiltre The fludis strekis plane our al the see; The bubbis and wyndy clowdis, heir and thar, Gan fle onon furth of the large ayr. Than of his court apperit figuris seir; The hydduus quhalys, and al the rowtis in feir Of agit Glaucus with his cannos hair, And Palemon, Inoes son and ayr, The swift Tritones with trump playand thar spryng, Phorcus with al his falloschip and ofspryng, And on hys left hand furth haldis Thetis, With al the Nymphis hait Nereidis, Sik as Melite, Spyo, Penopea, Cymodoce, Nyse and Thalia. Throu owt the flude merely salys Ene, And Palynurus drownys in the see. Glaidnes and comfort than, in to sum part, Begouth to kittil Eneas thochtful hart. “Heyss heich the cross,” he bad, “al mak thaim bown, And fessyn bonnettis beneith the mayn sail down.” Than al sammyn, with handis, feit and kneis, Dyd heyss thar sail, and trossyt down thar teys; Now the le schete, and now the luf, thai slak, Set in a fang, and threw the ra abak; Baith to and fra al dyd thar nokkis wry; Prosper blastis furth careis the navy. Befor the laif, as lodis man and lard, And al his salis vp with fellon fard, Went Palynure; and hail the remanent Was chargit hald the sammyn courss and went. Be than the donk nycht had run almaist evin His myd courss or methis in the hevin, And euery maryner, but langar kepe, Thar bodeis restis with the plesand sleip, Endlang the hechis lyand heir and thar is, Or in thar hard settis lenand on ayris; Quhen that the swift god of sleip gan slide Furth of the starnyt hevin, by nychtis tide, And dyd away the dirknes of the ayr, Removing schadowit skyis maid al fair; Onto the, Palynurus, hess he socht, And the, al innocent, soroful slepis brocht. Heich in the eftschip dyd this god appeir, In figur of Phorbantus, a maryneir, And frendfully gan warp sik wordis owt: “Iasyus son, Palynur, luke about; The sobir seys beris sownd our navy; The wyndis blawis ful evin and rycht makly; Thou may sovirly tak the ane howris rest, Leyn doun thi hede and sleip, for that is best Thi wery eyn thou prevely withdraw From langsum laubour, and sleip a litil thraw, And I my self sal glaidly in thi place Beir thyne office, and steir a litil space.” To quhom Palynur, skars liftand his eyn, Ansuerd and said: “Quhat thing wald thou meyn? Byddis thou me be sa nyce I suld mysknaw This calm salt watir, or stabil fludis haw? Wilt thou I traste this monstre perellus? Or quhat in wyndis sa dissaitful til ws, And this cleir hevin sa oft hes trumpit me, Wald thou I lippynnyt the maist nobil Ene?” Sik wordis he said, grippand the helmstok fast, Lenand tharon, and by na way nor cast Wald part tharfra, haldand his eyn ful evin Ay tobehald the starnys in the hevyn; Quhen lo! this god smate bath his tymplis twane With a ful sleipry and bedyit grane, Wet in the myndles flude of hell, Lythe, And sowpit in Stix, the forcy hellys see; Hys glotnyt and fordovirrit eyn two He closyt hes, and sound gart sleip alsso. Bot scarsly gan the first rest of sleip, Or he was war, thus on his membris creip, Quhen on him lenys this god, and tho he kneld, And with a swak, as that the schip gan helde, Ourburd him kest amyd the flowand see, Richt al togidder with the helmstok of tre; Than al for nocht apon his feris he cryis. This god flaw vp lyke a bird in the skyis. And nocht the less the schip held furth hir went, As scho did ayr, throw the calm seys sprent, But ony harm, and al the navy sone, By the promyss of the fader Neptune. With this almaste thai careit ar infeir Onto the rochis and skelleis weill neir Of Syrene, that we Marmadynnys clepe, Dangerus vmquhile, for a mekil hepe Of dede banys lay tharon ful quhite; So gan the salt iawpis ythandly smyte The holl rolkis, maid a sownd ful hayss. Quhen Prince Ene persauyt, by his rayss, Quhou that the schip dyd rok and tail?eve For lak of a gude sterisman on the see, Him self hess than sone hynt the rudyr in hand And throu the fludis steris the schip to land, Bewaland gretly in his mynde pensyfe, For that his frend was fal and lost the lyfe. “Allace! our mekil thou lippynnyt hess,” quod he, “Into the stabillit hevin and calmyt see: Bair and onerdit, in ane onkouth land, Palynurus, sal thou ly on the sand.” Thus wepand said, and leyt his flote go large, Quhill at the last, baith ballyngar and barge Apon the cost that hait Ewboica Arryvit neir the cite of Cuma. Than to the streme thai turnyt thar forschip, Kest down thar bewchit ankyrris, ferm of grip, Into the raid, endlang the costis bay Thar eft castellis gan mustyr in array. And al the ?ongkeris spedis hastely Onto the schore of Hisperia fast by. Sum smytis fyre furth of the hard flynt stane; Sum spedely to the thik wod ar gane, In dern dennys, quharin wild bestis dwellis; And sum dyd schaw the new fund springand wellis; To beit thar mystir al bissy for the nanys, Sum to this turn, sum to that, start atanys. Heyr endis the fyft buke of Virgil in Eneados and begynnys sum preambleis in the sext buke tharof and first twiching the opinionys that the poetis and ald philosophouris had of hell and placis tharof The Proloug of the Saxt Buke Pluto, thou patron of the deip Achiron, Fader of tormentis in thyne infernal see, Amyd the fludis, Stix and Flagiton, Lethie, Cochite, the watyris of oblivie, With dolorus quhirling of furyus sistyris thre, Thyne now salbe my muse and drery sang: To follow Virgil in this dyrk poyse Convoy me, Sibil, that I ga nocht wrang. Quhat wenys fulys this saxt buke be bot iapis, Al ful of leys or ald ydolatryis? O hald ?our pace, ?e verray goddis apis! Reid, reid agane, this volume, mair than twyss: Considir quhat hyd sentence tharin lyis; Be war to lak, less than ?e knew weil quhat; And gif ?ou list not wirk eftir the wiss, Heich on ?our hede set vp the foly hat. “All is bot gaistis and elrich fantasyis, Of browneis and of bogillis ful this buke: Owt on thir wandrand speritis, wow!” thou cryis; “It semys a man war mangit, tharon list luke, Lyke dremys or dotage in the monys cruke, Vayn superstitionys aganyst our richt beleve; Quhat of thir fureis, or Pluto that plukkit duke, Or cal on Sibil, deir of a revyn sleif?” Wald thou I suld this buke to the declare, Quhilk war impossibil til expreme at schort? Virgil is ful of sentence our all quhare, Bot heirintil, as Seruius gan proport, Hys hie knawlage he schawis, that euery sort Of his clausys comprehend sik sentence, Thar bene tharof, set thou think this bot sport, Maid gret ragmentis of hie intelligence. In all his warkis Virgil doith discrive The stait of man, gif thou list vnderstand, Baith lif and ded in thir fyrst bukis fyve; And now, intil this saxt, we haue on hand, Eftir thar deth, in quhat plyte saulis sal stand. He writis lyke a philosophour naturall; Twichand our faith mony clausis he fand Quhilk beyn conform, or than collaterall. Schawis he nocht heir the synnys capital? Schawis he nocht wikkit folk in endless pane, And purgatory for synnys venyall, And vertuus pepil into the plesand plane? Ar al sik sawis fantasy and invane? He schawis the way, evir patent, down to hell, And rycht difficil the gait to hevin agane, With ma gude wordis than thou or I kan tell. Heir tretand vertu, taxis he pane for vyce, Feil woful turmentis of wrachit catyvis sary, Notabil histories, and diuerss proverbis wyce, Quhilkis to reherss war our prolixt a tary; Al thocht he, as a gentile, sum tyme vary, Ful perfitely he writis seir misteris fell, As quhou thir heithin childir thar werdis wary, Wepand and waland at the first port of hell. And, thocht our faith neid nane authorising Of gentiles bukis, nor by sik heithin sparkis, ?it Virgil writis mony iust clauss conding, Strenthing our beleve, to confound payan warkis. Quhou oft rehersis Austyne, cheif of clarkis, In his gret volume of the Cite of God, Hundreth versis of Virgil, quhilk he markis Agane Romanys, til vertu thame to brod! And of this saxt buke walis he mony a scor, Not but gude resson, for, thocht Criste grund our faith, Virgil sawis ar worth to put in stor. Thay aucht not be hald vagabund nor waith— Ful riche tresour thai bene and precius graith: For oft by Sibilys sawis he tonys his stevyn; Thus faithfully in his Bucolykis he saith, The maide cummyth bringis new lynnage fra hevyn. As twiching hym writis Ascencyus, Feil of his wordis bene like the appostilis sawis; He is ane hie theolog sentencyus, And maste profound philosophour he him schawis, Thocht sum his writis frawart our faith part drawis. Na wondir! he was na Cristyn man, per De, He was a gentile, and levit on payane lawis, And ?it he puttis a God Fader maste hie. We trow a God, regnand in personys thre, And ?it angellis hevinly spiretis we call; And of the hevinly wightis oft carpis he, Thocht he belevit thai war not angellis all. Quhil Cristis passioun, of Adam from the fall, All went to hell, thocht all war nocht in pane: Or Criste he wrait this buke, quhar reid ?e sall Distinit in hell specialy placis twane, And principaly the sted of fell tormentis, With seyr departingis in that laithly hald, Ane other place quhilk purgator representis, And, dar I say, the Lymbe of faderis ald, With Lymbus puerorum, as I haue tald— Schawis he not eik, by werkis meritory, Quhou iust pepil, in welthis monyfald, Raiosys, syngand sangis of hevynly glory? And, as he twichis greys seyr in payn, In blys, elike wyss, syndry stagis puttis he. Quhat sal I of his wondir warkis sayn? For al the plesance of the Camp Elyse, Octauian, in his Georgikis, ?e may se; He consalis nevir lordschip in hell desyre, Bot evir in hevin, intil sum his degre, To cheyss his place, and not amang the fyre. Quhat Cristyn clerk kouth hym haue consalit bettir? Al thocht he was neuer Catholyk wight, He hess writtin ful mony attentik lettir. In that ilk buke he techis ws ful richt, The warld begouth in veyr, baith day and nycht; In veir he says that God als formyt man, The son, the mone and all the starnys bright: We grant in veir that first the warld began. “Happy war he knew the causs of all thingis, And settis on syde all dreid and cuyr,” quod he, “Vndir his feyt at treddis, and down thryngis, Chancis ontretabill of fatis and destane, All feir of ded, and eik of hellis see.” Happy he callys sik wightis, and sa do I. Quhar may we swa optene felicite? Neuer bot in hevin empire abone the sky. Tyll write ?ou all hys tryit and notabil verss Almaist impossibil war, and half invane, For me behuffyt repeting and reherss In seir placis the sammyn wordis agane. This may suffice, I wil no mor sane: Ane movar, ane begynnar puttis he, Sustenys all thing, and doyth in all remane, And, be our faith, the sammyn thing grant we. I say nocht all hys warkis beyn perfyte, Nor that sawlys turnys in othir bodeys agane, Thocht we traste, and may preif be haly write, Our sawle and body sal anys togiddir remane. At thar bene mony goddis I wil not sane, Thocht haly scriptur iust men “goddis” clepe. Quhom cal I Pluto and Sibilla Cumane, Hark; for I wil na fals goddis wirschepe. Sibilla, til interpret propirly, Is clepit a maid of goddis secret preve, That hes the spiret divyne of prophecy. Quha bettir may Sibilla namyt be Than may the gloryus moder and madyn fre, Quhilk of hir natur consavit Criste, and buyr All haill the mysteris of the Trinite, And maist excellent wark had vnder cure? Thow art our Sibill, Crystis moder deir, Prechit by prophetis and Sibilla Cumane; Thou brocht the hevynly lynage in erd heir, Moder of God, ay virgyne doith remane, Restoring wss the goldin warld agane. Sathan the clepe I, Pluto infernall, Prynce in that dolorus den of wo and pane, Nocht god tharof, bot gretast wrech of all. To name the God, that war a manifest le; Is bot a God, makar of euery thing— I favour nocht the errour of Manache. Set thou to Wlcane haue ful gret resembling, And art sum tyme the minister of thundring, Or sum blynd Ciclopes of thy laithly wra, Thou art bot Iovys smytht, in the fyre blawing, And dyrk fornace of perpetuall Ethna. Thou wrocht na thyng, bot maid thi self a devill, And that was not to mak, bot rather fail?e, For Austyne says syn, myscheif or evill Is nocht at all. For quhy? Thai nocht avail?e. The dym dongeoun of Ditis till assail?e, Or in the lyknes this mysty poetry, Help me, Mare; for certis, vail que vail?e, War at Pluto, I sal hym hunt of sty. Heir endis the proloug and begynnys the saxt buke of Eneados Ene aspyis Dedalus wark express, And with Sibilla spak, the prophetess. Qwil on this wyss ilk man occupyit was, Reuthful Eneas bownys him to pas Onone to serss the strenth and tempil tho Dedicat ontil the myghty Apollo, That feirfull gowsty cave far from the way, And secret hald of Sibilla the may, Quhais hait memor and resson oft infyrit Delyus, the prophet divyne, and so inspirit That scho the secretis fortocum did knaw. With this thai entrit in the hallowit schaw Of the thrynfald passynger Dyane, And howss of brycht Apollo gold bigane. The fame is so, that Dedalus, the wright, Furth of King Mynos realm takand his flycht, Sa bald was with swift fedrame, and happy To aventur hym self heich in the sky, And by a quent onvsyt way to knaw, Towart the frosty poil artik he flaw; Bot, at the last, softly he gan alicht Of Chalcydonys apon the castell hicht; And rendrit fyrst into thir landis, he Offerit and hallowit, Phebus, onto the, The fard and flycht of baith hys weyngis two, And thar grathit a fair tempil alsso. Apon the portis dyd he carve and grave Androgyus slauchtir, falsly brocht to grave, And for hys deth the vengeance and the wrake; Quhou of Athenes commandit war, alake, Twyss sevyn childir onto Creyt be send, Perpetualy ilk ?eir, a sair presand; The dedly vrn stand porturat mycht thai knaw, Owt of the quhilk the lottis warrin draw. Forgane Athenes, a litil our the see, The ile of Crete he wrocht, musterand ful hie (The kingis cite thar hecht Gnosya), Quharin he porturit als ful, wallowa! The lufe abhominabill of Queyn Pasyphe, Quhou pryvely with the bul forlane was sche; The blandit kynd, and birth of formys twane, The monstruus Mynotawr, doith thar remane, Ane horribill takin of schrewit Venus wark. Thar was alsso craftely schape and mark That namekouth howss, quhilk Laborynthus hait, Ful of wrynkkillit onreturnabil dissait. Bot, netheless, Dedalus, cawcht piete Of the gret luf of fayr Ariadne, That was the kyngis douchtir, tawght ful rycht Of this quent howss fortil omdo the slycht— Quhou by a threid the subtell wentis ilkane Thai myghtin hald, and turn that way agane. And thou alsso, the ?ong child Icharus, Quhilk son was onto this ilk Dedalus, A gret part of this wark suld haue beyn thyne, Gyf that the dolour and the huge pyne Had sufferit hym to kyth his craft on the: In gold to grave thi fall twyss etlyt he, And twyss, for rewth, fail?eis the faderis handis. Eneas tho, and al at with hym standis, This sculptur al espyit had on breid, Ne war Achates, quhilk befor him ?eid, Be than returnyt was, and with him brocht The religyus woman quham thai socht, Baith consecrate to Dyane and Phebus, Hait Deiphobe, the douchtir of Glawcus, Quhilk to the king sone spak apon this wyss: “This tyme,” quod scho, “to stair and to devyss, Govand on figuris, is not necessary. Mair neidfull now it war, but langar tary, Sevin ?ong stottis, that ?ok bur nevir nane, Brocht from the bow, in offerand brittin ilkane, And alsmony twyntyrris, as is the gyss, Chosyn and ganand for the sacrifyss.” On this wyss till Eneas spak Sibill, And Troianys tareis nocht forto fulfill Hir commandment, that, but langar delay, The sacryfyis and offerand done haue thai; And syne the nun to the hie tempill thame brocht, Quhilk in maner of ane gret cave was wrocht, Of Cuma holkit in the hillis side. Ane hundreth entreis had it, large and wyde, Ane hundreth durris tharon stekit closs, Out at the quhilkis ruschit alsmony a voce, Gevand responss onto this Sibilla. Tho to the dur threswald cummyn ar tha, Quhen that this virgyn said: “To ask answeris Now is the tyme; lo, lo, the god me steris!” And as scho gan sik wordis say and cry, Without the entre standand, suddanly Nowdir vissage nor cullour, as thai war air, Remanys than, nor hir weil dressit hair, Bot fast hir breist the breth dyd clap and bete; Hir fers hart boldynnys vp ful grete, Enragit of the sprete divyne alsso, That of mair statur gan scho semyng tho; Hir voce ne sovndis lyke a mortale wight; For, with the goddis maieste and myght Twichit and smyte, that drew hir mynde ful neir, Hir hart pipis gan to flekkir and steir. “Blyn nocht, blyn nocht, thou gret Troiane Ene, Of thi bedis nor thi prayeris,” quod sche, “For, bot thou do, thir gret durris, but dreid, And grisly ?ettis, sal nevir warp on breid.” And, with that word, scho cessit and no mor said. The cald dreid gan tho Troianys invaid, Thirland throu owt hard banys at euery part; The king hym self than inkirly from his hart Maid this oryson, and devotly said: “O bright Phebus, that evir reuth has had On Troys hard aduersite and wo, Thow quhilk direkkit the Troiane dartis so In Achillis body, schot by Parys hand; This see, at goys about mony gret land, Thou beand my gidar, entrit haue I, And eyk the wilsum desert land Masylly, Quhar the schald sandys strekis endlang the schor; Now at the last, that fled ws evir mor, The forther cost of Ital haue we kaucht, Thocht, hiddertillis, hard fortoun hass omberaucht The Troianys, and persewit onfrendfully. Now all ?e goddis and goddessis, quham by Vmquhile was thocht gret Ilion ful of ioy, And the schynand gloryus town of Troy Semyng resist and gaynstand ?our godhede, Lesum it is to desist of ?our fede, And now to spair the puyr pepil Troiane. O thou maist haly prophetess souerane, Quhat is to cum hess knawlage of all thingis, Grant at Tewcranys may dwel in Ital ringis, For I ne ask na land, nor realm algatis, Bot quhilk is grantit to ws by our fatis— Schaw and declar for our goddis errand, That cachit bene our mony see and sand, Quhar sal thar resting place be to remane, So eftir that to Phebus and Diane Of sownd marbill tempillis beld may I, And festual days for Appollo gar cry. To the alsso, within our realmys, salbe Mony secrete closet and revestre, Quharin thi warkis and fatale destaneis, Thi secret sawis, and thi propheceis, Endite of my kyn and genolegy, I sal gar kepe and obserue reuerendly; And, O thou blissit woman, onto the Wyss walit men sal dedicate and sacre; So that thou write nocht on the levis thi wordis For dreid al turn bot til a mok or bourdis, Gif that the wynd thame skattir and blaw away. Pronunce it with thyne awin mowth, I the pray.” Tharwith he held hys pace and said no mor.

As the divyne fury gan first sessing, And eik hir ragiand mowth begouth to rest, Godly Eneas begynnys als prest, And said: “Virgyn, na kynd of pane may ryss Onknaw to me, of new that may me gryss; Or now I am warnyt of al sik chance, And hess thame rollit in my remembrance.

Of Mysenus entyrment at was slane, And quhou Eneas fand the goldin grane.

Sum tyme he was ane of gret Hectoris feris; About Hector evir hantit he the werys, Now blawing with hys trump maste craftely, Now with a speir ionand hys mastir by. Eftir Achil reft him the lyfe in wer, Til dowchty Ene this forcy chyvaler Adionyt hess him self in falloschip, A man of na less prowes nor wirschip. Bot now, percace, with his boyss trump as he Went onprovisitly blawand by the see, To stryfe prouoking the goddis with his springis, Gif it be lesum to trast sa schameful thingis, Triton the god, havand tharat dispite, Or he was war, hym hyntis and dyd smyte Amang the fomy rolkis law adown, And in the salt wallys the man gan drown. Quharfor about his corps with gret clamour The Troianys stude murnand, and maid dolour; Bot principaly the rewthfull Eneas. Sibillais heste, as he commandit was, Tho sped in haist forto perform weping; For the sepulcre funerale fyre or byng, Ane hepe of treis thai press onone to dycht, And vp onto the hevynnys rayss on hight. Ontil ane ancyent forest socht thai then, Entrand in mony dern wild bestis den; Ful of roset down bet is the fyr tre, Smyte with the ax dyd rayr the akis hie, Gret eschin stokkis tumlys to the grond, With weggeis schydit gan the byrkis sovnd, The felloun elmys weltis down the hillys. Ene him self alsso, with ful gude willys Into sik warkis, with the first, al day For tobe bissy gan hys feris pray, With lwme in hand fast wirkand lyke the laif; And in hys breste gan to and fra consaif, Ful hevely, thir materis war betyde, Behaldand the large wod on athir syde, Thar as he stude thus makand hys prayer: “Wald God ?on goldyn branch list now appeir, And kyth the self to ws in this forest! Sen lo, al thing the prophetes exprest Of the, Mysenus, ar our trew, allace!” Skars war thir wordis said, quhen, in that place, A payr of dowis fra hevin come with a flycht, And richt forgane the mannys face dyd lycht, And on the grene sward thar place tuke law. This rial prynce, alssone as he thame saw, His moderis byrdis knew, and blithly than Hys orison hess maid, and thus began: “O haly fowlys, gif the way may be went, Be ?e my gydis to compleit myne entent.

And ?e, my blissit moder, that our beild is Into this dowtsum cace, be nocht away: I ?ou beseik be favorabill to our way.” And prayand thus, efter the spamen werd, He prentit baith his futsteppis in the erd, Behaldand redly quhat syngnys thai schaw, Or quhidder thai mark, etand, pasyng on raw. Thai at the last gan flychtir furth a space, Half stalkand on the grond a soft pace, Sa fer befor Achates and Ene As thai mycht weil behald thame with thar e. And alssone as thai come to the entre Of Avernus, that stynkand hellys see, Vprayss thai swyftly, and in the moste ayr Flaw furth, and syne gan alycht and repair Apon thar segyss, quhar thame list tobe, Of diuerss naturis perkit on the tre, Throw quhais branchis, of seir hewis mony ane, The brycht glittyrrand goldin cullour schane. Lyke as ful oft, in chil wyntiris tyde, The gum or glew, amyd the woddis wide, Is wont to seym ?allow on the grane new, Quhilk nevir of that treis substance grew, With saffron hewit frute doyng furth sprowt, Circulis and wymplis rownd bewis abowt— Siklyke was of this gold the figur brycht, That burgionyt fayr on the rank akis hycht. Evir as the branch for pypand wynd reboundit, The goldin schakeris ratlis and resoundit. Eneas smertly hynt the grayn at schone, And but delay hess rent it dovn anone; Desyrus to compleit hys way alssua, Bair it onto the hald of Sibilla. And netheless Troianys, this ilk tyde, Mysenus deth bewalit at the cost syde, Onto the dolorus onsilly body Funeral seruyce completand by and by. At the begynnyng first vp hie thai beild A huge munge or byng amyd the feild, Of dry ayk schydis and fat roset treys; Al sydis tharof, als fer as ony seys, Was dek and coverit with thir dedly bewis, And wild cipress, the tre of mortall hewys; The top abufe arrayt was at richt, And adornyt with schynand armour bricht. Sum spedis to graith hait watir bissely In caldronys playand on the fyre fast by; The cald ded corps is weschin and invnct, Enbalmyt with rich gummys euery iunct. Thai schowting, gowling and clamour abowt him maid; The body syne bewalit haue thai laid In a soft bed, and thar abuf was spred Purpour robbis, quharwith he wont was cled. Sum on thar schulderis the gret beir vpbair, A dulful office, with mony sob and rayr, And, as the maner of tendir frendis is, For sorow thar facis writhis away, I wys, Puttand the kyndling in with hait fyre brand. Gret hepis of censs vpblesit fra hand to hand; Cowpis and goblettis, warpit in the fyre, Ful of oyl dolyve, brynt vp brycht and schire. Efter all was fallin in puldir and in ass, And the gret heit of flambis quynchit was, The reliqueis and the dry ammeris syne Thai sloknyt, and gan weschin with sweit wyne. The banys, walit by and naitly chosit, Choryneus in a brassyn twn hess closit; And this ilk man his feris al, but dowt, With cleyn watir clengit thryss abowt, Strinkland a litil dewing, as was the gyss, With the branch of a happy olyve thryss; He purgit and aspergit weil the men, The lattir word, “Al in done!” said he then. Eneas tho gart vp erekkit be A sepultur, of ful huge quantite, In takynnyng of the mannys instrumentis, Ane ayr and eik a trumpet tharon prentis, Vndir the mont, vmquhile Aeryus Was clepit, quhilk now is hait Mysenus, Eftir his name callit perpetualy, That evir sal his memor testify. Of Eneas sacrifyis be nycht, And quhou to hel he tuk the way ful rycht. This beand done, Sibillais commandment Ene addressis perform incontinent. Thar stude a dirk and profound cave fast by, A hidduus hoill, deip gapand and grisly, All ful of cragis and of thir scharp flynt stanys, Quhilk was weil dekkit and closit for the nanys With a fowle layk, als blak as ony craw, And skuggis dym of a ful dern wod schaw, Abufe the quhilk na fowle may fle but skath. Exalationys or vapouris blak and laith Furth of that dedly golf thrawis in the air, Sik wyss na byrd may thiddir mak repair; Quharfor Grekis Avernus clepis this sted, The place bot fowlis to say, or pyt of ded. Heir first Ene, at this ilk entre vyle, Fowr ?ong stottis addressit, blak of pyle; The nun Sibilla ressauys thame, and syne Amyd thar forhedis quhelmyt on cowpis of wyne, And of thar top, betwix the hornys twa, The ovirmast haris hass scho pullit awa, And in the haly ingil, as was the gyss, Kest thame, in maner of the first sacrifice, Apon Hecate cryand, with mony a ?ell, Mychtful in hevin and dym dungeon of hell. Sum slevit knyvis in the bestis throtis, And otheris, quhilk war ordand for sik notis, The warm new blude keppit in cowp and peyss. Ene him self a ?ow was blak of flece Brittnnyt with hys sword, in sacrifice ful hie Onto the moder of the fureys thre, And hir gret systir; and to the, Proserpyne, A ?eld kow all to trynschit; and eftir syne To the infernal kyng, quhilk Pluto hait, Hys nycht altaris begouth to dedicate; The hail bowkis of bestys, bayn and lyre, Amyd the flambys kest and haly fyre; The fat oly dyd he ?et and peyr Apon the entralys, to mak thame byrn cleir. Bot lo, a litill befor the son rysyng, The grond begouth to rummyss, croyn and ryng, Vndir thar feyt, and woddy toppys hie Of thir hillys begyn to move thai se; Amang the schaddowys and the skuggis mark The hell hundys hard thai ?owl and bark, At cummyng of the goddess Proserpyne. Sibilla cryis, that prophetess dyvyne; “All ?e that bene prophane, away, away! Swith, outwith al the sanctuar hy ?ow, hay! And thou,” quod sche, “hald on thi way with me. Draw furth thi swerd, for now is neid, Ene, To schaw thi manheid, and be of ferm curage.” Thus far scho said, smyte with the godly rage, And tharwith entris in the oppynnyt cave; Eneas onabasit, fra all the lave, Followis his gide with equale pays ful rycht. O ?he goddis, in quhais power and mycht The sawlis beyn, and ?he dern skuggis dyrk, Confusyt Chaos, quharof all thing beyn wirk, Skaldand hellis flude, Flagiton, but lycht, Placis of silence and perpetuall nycht: Mot it be leful to me for to tell Tha thyngis quhilkis I haue hard said of hell, And, by ?our myghtis, that I may furth schaw Seir thingis drynchit in the erd ful law, And deip envoluyt in myrkness and in myst! Thai walking furth sa dyrk, oneth thai wyst Quhidder thai went, amyd dym schaddowys thar, Quhar evir is nycht, and nevir lyght dois repar, Throwout the waist dongion of Pluto kyng, Thai voyd boundis, and that gowsty ryng— Siklyke as quha wald throw thik woddis wend In obscure licht, quhen moyn may nocht be kend As Iupiter, the kyng etheryall, With erdis skugg hydis the hevynnys all, And the myrk nycht, with hir vissage gray, From every thing hess reft the hew away. Befor the porch and fyrst iawys of hell, Lamentatioun and wraikfull Thochtis fell Thar lugyng had; and thar at dwellis eyk Pail Maladeis that causys folk be seik, The feirful Dreid, and als onweldy Age, The fellon Hungir with hir ondantit rage; Thar was alsso the laithly Indigence, Terribill of port and schameful hir presence, The grysly Ded at mony ane hess slane, The hard Laubour, and diseysful Pane, The slottry Sleip, Dedis cousyng of kynd, Inordinat Blithnes of peruersit mynd: And in the ?et forganyst thame dyd stand The mortal Batall with hys dedly brand, The irne chalmeris of hellys Fureys fell, Witless Discord, that wondryng maist crewell, Wymplit and buskit in a bludy bend, With snakis hung at euery harys end. And in the myddis of the vtyr ward, With braid branschis spred our al the sward, A rank elm tre stude, huge gret, and stok ald— The wlgar pepil in that sammyn hald Belevis thir vayn dremys makis thar duellyng; Vndir ilk leif ful thik thai stik and hyng. Thar beyn eik monstreis of mony diuerss sort: The Centawres war stablit at this port, The dowbil porturat Scilla with thame infeir, Bryareus with ane hundreth formys seyr, The bysnyng best, the serpent of Lerna, Horribilly quhysland, and quent Chymera With fyre enarmyt on hir toppys hie, The laithly Harpyes, and the Gorgones thre; Of thrynfald bodeys gaistly formys dyd grone, Baith of Erylus and of Geryon. Eneas smartly, for the hasty dreid, Hynt furth hys swerd in this place, and, gud speid, The drawin blaid he profferis thar and heir Onto tha monstreis, evir as thai drew neir; And war not his expert mait Scybilla Tawcht him thai war bot voyd gaistis all tha, But ony bodeis, as wandrand wrechys waist, He had apon thame ruschit in gret haist, And with his bytand brycht brand, all invane, The twme schaddowis smyttyn to haue slane. Tyll hellys fludys Ene socht neddyrmar, And Palynurus, hys sterysman, fand thar. Fra thyne, strekis the way profund onone Deip onto hellys flude of Acheron, With holl bysme and hydduus swelch onrude, Drumly of mud, and skaldand as it war wod, Popland and bulrand furth on athir hand Onto Cochitus all his slyke and sand. Thir ryveris and thir watyris kepit war By ane Charon, a grisly ferryar, Terribil of schap and sluggart of array, Apon his chyn feil cannos harys gray, Lyart feltrit tatis; with burnand eyn red, Lyk twa fyre blesys fixit in his hed; Hys smottrit habyt, owr his schulderis lydder, Hang pevagely knyt with a knot togiddir. Hym self the cobill dyd with hyss bolm furth schow, And, quhen hym list, halit vp salys fow. This ald hasart careis owr fludis hoyt Spretis and figuris in hys irne hewyt boyt, All thocht he eildit was, or step in age, Als fery and als swippir as a page; For in a god the age is fresch and greyn, Infatigabill and immortall as thai meyn. Thiddir to the bra swarmyt all the rowt Of ded gostis, and stud the bank abowt, Baith matronys and thar husbandis all yferis, Ryal pryncis, and nobill chevaleris, Smal childering, and ?ong damysellis onwed And fair springaldis laitly ded in bed, In fader and moderis presence laid on beir. Als gret numbir thiddir thikkit infeir As, in the first frost eftir hervist tyde, Levis of treys in the wod doys slyde; Or byrdis flokkis owr the fludis gray Onto the land seikand the nerrest way, Quhom the cald sesson cachis owr the see Into sum benar realm and warm cuntre. Thar stude thai prayand sum support to get, That thai mycht with the formast owr be fet, And gan vp heving petuusly handis twa, Langand tobe apon the forthir bra.

Quha ar onbereit ane hundreth ?er mon bide, Waverand and wandrand by this bankis syde; Than, at the last, to pass owr in this boyt Thai beyn admyt, and costis thame not a grote, And frely may behaldyn or espy Tha lakis, quhilkis thame langis to vissy.” Anchises son tho styntis a litil stownd, And baith his futsteppis fixit in the grond, Musyng in mynd sum deil, sad in a part, And of this hard forton kauch rewth in hart. Thar saw he, dolorus and wofull of cheir, But funeral seruyce, nevir laid on beir, Lucaspes and Orontes, baith twane, Quhilum masteris of the schyp Lyciane, Quham baith yfeir, as said befor haue we, Saland from Troy throw owt the wally see, The dedly storm ourquhelmyt with a quhiddir, Baith men and schip welt vnder flude togyddir.

And skarsly as he, Ene, gan hym espy, Amang dirk skowgis standand full drery, First he him gretis, sayand to him thus: “Quhilk of the goddis, O Palynurus, The ws bereft, and drynt amyd the see? Quhow tyd that cace? Declar me, I pray the. For certis, bricht Apollo nevir or now Was fals to me; bot I wait neuer how Of hys answer twiching the he ravyt, And hess my mynd tharin al hail dissavit; That schew thou suld hailskarth owr the see Onto the grond of Ital cum,” quod he. “Se, thus his lawte and promyt is keip!” The tother answeris with a petuus peip: “Maist worthy duke, Anchises son sa deir, Nowder hath the of Phebus the answer, Vndir his secrete cortyne, so dissave, Ne ?it na god sa far hass me bywave, Nor drownyt in the deip, as ?e beleve. Bot, as I slaid our burd to my myscheve, The helmstok, or gubernakil of tre, Quharwith I rewlit owr courss throu the see, Lenand tharon sa fast, per cace it threw, And rent away owr burd with me I drew.

Quhen that he had thir wordis said express, Syk answer til hym maid the prophetess: “Palynurus,” quod scho, “thou sary syre, Quhiddir is becummyn sik ondantyt desyre To the, and ferss will sa onressonabill?

Quharfor Eneas and Scybill, baith tway, As thai begunnyn had, held furth thar way. Owr Stix the flude quhou that Ene dyd fair, And Cerberus in cave hard ?ell and rayr. And as thai gan approch toward the flude, This churlych boyt man, on Stix quhar he stude, Alsswyth as he persavit thame cum swa Throw the darn wod, and draw nerar the bra, First with sik bustuus wordis he thame grat, And, but offence, gan thame chidyng thus plat: “Quhat evir thou be, that cummys enarmyt so Towart owr fludis, quhiddir etlys thou go? For quhat causs come thou hyddir? Tell me tyte; Stand styl thar as thou art, with mekill syte. Press na forthir, for this is the hald richt Of gaistis, schaddowys, sleip, and dovyrrit nycht: Onlefull war, and ane forbodyn thing, Within this passyngear our Stix to bryng Ony levand wight. Certis, in myne entent, I am nocht glaid ?yt of the last sa went, Nor that I careyt Hercules owr this layk, Ne Thesyus, and Pyrothous hys mayk, All thocht thai war cummyn of goddis lynage And invynsibill of strenth and vassallage. For this ilk Hercules, with hys stalwart handis, The grym wardane of hell strenyt in bandis, And drew hym trymlyng from the kyngis trone. The tother twa gret violence wald haue done; The fresch Proserpyne, Plutois lady gay, Furth of hir bowr begouth to led away.” To hym agane this answer maid express Of Amphrisya Phebus prophetess: “Do all suspicioun furth of thy consate; Heir is,” quod scho, “nane sik gyle nor dissate; Na violence owr wapynnys doith pretend. Weill lykis ws, it doith ws not offend, Thocht in hys cave ?our hydduus portar ?owland affray the ded gaistis evyrmar; We stand content, it sufficyth ws alssua, That ay remane the chaste Proserpina Within hir fader broderis boundis and ryng. Bot heir is cummyn, of Kyng Troas ofspring, Eneas, full of piete and knychthed, To vissy hys luffit fader, quhilk is ded, Discendit to the law skuggis of hell.

The rageand hart, all ful of wraith and ire, Than wolx appesit of this laithly syre, And but ma wordys or langar delay, Awondryt of the presand fresch and gay, Thys fatale wand sa precyus was, I meyn, That he tofor a lang tyme had nocht seyn, Hys watry hewyt boyt, haw lyke the see, Towart thame turnys and addressis he, And gan approch onto the bra in haist, Syne othir sawlys expellit hess and chast Furth of hys bayt, quhilk sat endlang the wayll. He strekyt sone hys ayris, and grathis his saill, And tharwithall the byg weghty Ene Within his veschell boddum ressavis he. Vndir the paysand and the hevy charge Gan grane or geig full fast the saymyt barge, Sa ful of ryftys, and with lekkis perbrake, Scho suppit huge watir of the layk. Bot, at the last, owtour the flude ?it than Salfly scho brocht baith prophetess and man, And furth thame set amyd the fowl glar, Amang the fawch ryspys harsk and star. Cerberus, the hydduus hund, that regioun Fordynnys, barkand with thre mowthis sown, Onmesurabill in hys cave quhar he lay Richt owr forgane thame in the hie way; Quhom till the prophete, behaldand quhou in hy Hys nekkis wolx of eddyrris all grysly, A sop, stepyt intil hunny alsfast, And of enchantit cornys maid, gan cast. For hungyr wod, he gapys with throtis thre, Swith swellyand that morsell raucht had sche, And tho hys terribyll body with a rerd He tumlys owr, liggyn on the erd; Of huge statur and fellon quantite, Our all the cave furth strekit him hess he. The circulyt ways in hell Eneas saw, And fand Queyn Dido in the myr tre schaw. Thus quhil the portar in sleip sowpit lyis, The entre tho Eneas occupyis, And owr the fludis bank ful swyftly sprent, Quhais passage is onreturnabill went. Onon thai hard seir vocis lamentabill, Gret walyng, quhympring, sprachis miserabill. In the first cyrkill, or the vtyr ward, ?ong babbys sawlys weping sor thai hard, Quhom the hasty and blak duylful day Sowkand thar moderis pap had reft away, From the swete lyfe twynnyt ontymusly, As cayrful corps plungit in grave gart ly. Nixt thame, the secund place tha folkis hess Wrangwysly put to ded for cryme sakless. Nor, sykkyrly, thir settis to ilke wight War nocht assignyt but iuge, doym and rycht, For Kyng Mynos, inquistour and iustice, The fatale vrne and ballance at device Rewlys equaly, and be discretioun steris To consale and to iugement as efferis; The silly gostis callys in that secret cage, Baith of thar life and crymys takkand knawlage. Syne eftir thir, al sory and full of cayr, The thryd place haldis, and sal evir mayr, Giltles folk, that for disdene, wo or fed, With thar awin handis wrocht thar self to ded, And irkit of the life at thai war in, Thar sweit sawlys maid fra the body twyn. O, quhat penuryte and hard distres infeir Wald thai now suffir tobe in this warld heir!

Nocht far from thens, wide quhar on euery syde, Thai mycht behald the large fieldis wyde And boundis of Complaynt, all voyd of lycht (Sa beyn thai clepit properly at rycht), Quharin war all by strang lufe in thar days With sik crewel infectioun wastit away is, The hydlys held thai and the roddis darn, A myr tre wod about thame lowkyt ?arn; Thar paynfull musyng and thar hevy thocht, Eftir thar ded alsso, for?et thai nocht. Thar was Phedra, the spowss of Theseus, And Procrys eyk, the wyfe of Cephalus; In that ilke sted was trist Eryphyle— Hir crewell sonnys wondis schawys sche; Evadne he beheld, and Laodomya, And Pasyphe in falloschip with tha, And Ceneus, first a wench and syne a man, In hyr ald schap eftir ded changit than. Amang otheris the Phenyssyane Dido Within the gret wod walkis to and fro, The greyn wound gapand in hir breist all new, Quhom as the Troiane barroun nerrer drew, And throw the dyrk schaddowis first dyd knaw— Sikwyss as quha throw clowdy skyis saw, Or, at the leist, wenys he heth do se, The new moyn quhen first vpwalxis sche. The terys leyt he fall, and tendyrly With hartly lufe begrat hir thus in hy; “O fey Dido, sen I persave the heyr, A sovir warnyng, now I knaw ful cleir, Was schawin me, at thou with swerd was slaw, Byreft thi self the lyfe, and brocht of daw. Allace, I was the causar of thy ded!

Do stynt thy payss! Abide, thou gentil wight, Withdraw the not sa sone furth of my sight! Quham fleist thou? This is the lattir day, By werdis schape, that with the speke I may.” With sik wordis Eneas, full of wo, Set him to meyss the sprete of Queyn Dido, Quhilk, all inflambit, ful of wreth and ire, With acquart luke glowand hait as fyre, Maid him to weip and sched furth teris wak. All fremmytly frawart hym, as he spak, Hir eyn fixit apon the grond held sche, Moving na mair hir curage, face nor bre, Than scho had bene a statu of marbil stane, Or a ferm rolk of Mont Marpesyane. Bot finaly, full swyft scho wiskis away, Aggrevit fled in the darn woddis gray, Quhar as Sycheus, hir first spowss, ful suyr Corespondis to hir desyre and cuyr, Rendring in lufe amouris equiualent. And, netheless, fast eftir hir furth sprent Ene, perplexit of hir sory cace, And weping gan hir follow a weil lang space, Regratand in his mynd, and had piete Of the distress that movit hir so to fle. The ward of worthy weyrmen now Ene Beheld, and heir with Deiphobus spak he. Wyth al his speid fra thens he tuk the gayt That was ontil him grantit by hys fayt. And sone thai warin cummyn to the plane And lattir wardys, quharin dois remane Valyant folkis in feild and chevalry, Tha secret stedis hantand by and by. Heir him recontrit Parthenopeus, And intil armys valyant Tedeus, The pail gost eik of Adrastus the king. Thar saw he als, with huge greyt and murnyng In mydlerd oft menyt, thir Troianys Duryng the sege that into batale slane is, Quhom as he gan behald wydequhar on raw, Ful tendirly complenyng, thar he saw Glawcus, Medontus and Thersylocus, Anthenoris thre sonnys, and Polybetus Onto the goddess Ceres consecrate; Ideus saw he in his ald estate, Baith rewland ?it his cart, and wapynnys weildand. Onto Eneas left side and rycht hand The sawlys flokkis, circulyt in a rowt. Not sufficyt thame to spy him anys abowt, Bot, desiring he tareit evir mair, Furth with him forto walkin and repar Weil lykis thame, towart him fast to thring, And to inquire the causs of his cummyng. The nobillis eik of Grekis, one by one, With the gret rowtis of Agamenon, Alssone as thai the stalwart Troiane saw In brycht armour amyd the schaddowis law, Gretly afferd war smyte with fellon dreid. Sum gave the bak, takand the flycht gude speid, As quhilum thai onto thar schippis socht; Sum rasyt a cry with waik voce, as thai mocht; Bot al for nocht, thar clamour was ful skant, The sovndis brak with gasping or a gant.

With gret difficulte he him skarsly knew, Trymlyng for lak, eschamyt red of hew, As that he mycht, hydand hys fellon woundis. Ondemandit, with frendly wordis and sovndis Ene hym grat, sayand: “Of gret renown, Deiphobus, armypotent champyoun, Quha hess, allace! the marthyrit swa and slane By sa crewel tormentis and hydduus pane?

This ilk tyme me, with hevy curis lang Of irksum weir and sad, slumrys strang Oppressyt, for my walkyn mony fald, My fey chalmer gan my body hald. Fordoverit as I lay in to that sted, In swete profound rest of sleip lyke soft ded, That notabil spowss furth of hir lugyng place, This meyn sesson, al armour dyd arrace; My trasty sword fra vnder my hed away Stall scho, and in the place brocht Menelay; The chalmer durris oppynnyt scho in hy Wenyng to wyrk a hie plesour tharby To hir first luffar, and hir ald schame Tharthrou to quynche, and recovyr gud name.

Bot say me this agane, frend, altogidder, Quhat aventur hess brocht the levand hydder? Quhidder wavyt wilsum by storm of the see, Or at command of goddis, cum thou?” quod he, “Or quhat fortoun doith the cach and steyr, That to this sory hald thou cummys heir, To vissy this trublyt dym regioun, Quhar evir is nycht, and nevir son ?it schon?” Sibilla carpand tyl Ene gan tell The tormentis of deip drery paynful hell.

The myd declynyng of hir cowrss was went, And thai, percace, on sik wyss mycht haue spent The tyme compleyt was for thar iourne grant; Bot sone hym warnys Scibilla the sant, His trew marrow gan schortlie to him say: “The nycht, Eneas, slydis fast away; Weping the howris we consume and waist; Heir is the place quhar owr passage inhaist Departit is, and sched in stretis twane. This way, towart the rycht hand, strekis plane To the hie wallys of Schir Ditis kyng; It is our reddy went, quhilk sall ws bring Onto the plesand playn of Elyse. This other gait, on the left hand ?e se, Convoys onto the sted of fell torment, Quhar dampnyt schrewis in Tartarus ar sent In woful pyt perpetual to remane.” Than Deiphobus maid this answer agane: “Beis nocht agrevit, souerane nun, I pray, I sal no langar dwel, bot go my way: I sal compleyt my numbir furth,” quod he, “And to dym schaddowis rendrit sall I be. Pass on, pass on, our wirschip and renown, Mair prosper chance to hant go mak the bown!” Thus fer spak Deiphobus, and, with that saw, About turnyt hys payss, and gan withdraw.

And lo, ane other sort, ful blyth and glaid, On athir hand behaldis Eneas, At bankat on the greyn herbys set was, In loving of the goddis ioyusly Ympnys of pryce, triumphe and victory All syngand glaid togydder in falloschip And pryncipaly Apollo to worschip; Within a wod of lawrer greyn thai dwell, Fragrant of sweit odour and hailsum smell, Quhar throw the schawis scheyn in strandis seir Erydanus, the hevynly ryver cleyr, Flowys contyrmont and vpwart to the lift. Within this place, in al plesour and thryft, Ar hail the pissance quhilk, in iust batal, Slane in defens of thar kynd cuntre fell; And al thai preistis and religius wightis Quhilk levyt chaste cleyn lyfe, as to thame rycht is; And al godlyke devote prophetis trew, That suythfast thyng worthy to Phebus schew; And thai quhilkis, by thar craftys or science fyne, Fund by thar subtel knawlage and engyne, Thar lyfe illumynat and annornyt cleir; And tha by merytabil dedis and gyftis seir That maid otheris hald thame in memory— Of al thir war the tymplis by and by Arrayt with a fresch garland snaw quhite. And as thai flokkit abowt Ene, als tyte Syk wyss onto thame carpys Sibilla, Bot principaly to Museus, ane of tha, Was stad amyddis of the mekill rowt, As sche beheld hym with big schulderis stout: “O ?he so happy sawlys, tellith me, And thou, maste souerane poet, schaw,” quod sche, “In quhat regioun and place bene Anchises? Hyddir for his saik come we, and with gret press Hess oursalit of hell the gret fludis.” This ryall lord in few wordis concludis, And ansuerit thus: “Frend, certane dwelling nane In this cuntre haue we, bot all ourane Walkys and lugis in thir schene wod schawys, Endlang thir ryver bankis all on rawys; Thir bene our settis, and beddis of fresch flowris In soft bene medowis by cleir strandis all howris Our habitatioun is and residens. Bot gif ?our mynd langis to haue presens Of Anchises, pass vp ?one swyre fut het, I sall ?ou lyghtly in the hie way set.” And sayand thus, befor thame furth went he, And can thame schaw, apon the hill on hie, The schynand planys full of all plesance. Agane returnys he, and thai avans, Fra thyne discending from the hillis hyght, Quhar thai at last of Anchises gat syght. Quhou that Eneas with hys fader met, And athir othir with frendly wordis gret.

And sone as he persavys quhar that went Forganyst him, cumand throu gresy sward, Hys derrest son Ene with hasty fard, Baith his handys ioyfull furthstracht he than; The teris trynglyng our his chekis ran, And fra his mouth slydis thir wordis myld: “Thou art cummyn at last, my deir child! Thy gret piete, and kyndnes weil expert Onto thy fader, causyt the and gart This hard vayage venquyss and ourset! Quhat, is it grantit me? Ha, sall I get A verray sight, luffit son, of thy face?

Grant me, fader, now grant me by and by, We athir may with other handis schaik— Fra myne embrasyng withdraw the nocht, allaik!” And sayand thys, tendyrly wepit he, Baithyng hys face in terys gret plente. On this wyss talkyng, or thar wordis sessit, With hys lang armys thryss Eneas pressit About hys halss hym forto haue belappit, And thryss, invane, hys handys togidder clappit: The figur fled as lyght wynd, or son beym, Or mast lykly a waverand sleip or dreym. Duryng this tyme Eneas gan aduert Within a vail fer thens closyt a part, Quhare stude a wod with swouchand bewys schene, The flude Lythee flowand throu the fair grene; About the quhilk pepill onnowmerabill And silly sawlys fleys fast, but fabill, Quhil all the feildis of thare dyn resoundis— Lyke as, in medowys and fresch florist boundis, The bissy beys in schene symmeris tyde, On diuerss colorit flouris skalit wide, Flokkis about the blomyt lylleis quhite, And other fragrant blosummys redymyt. Mysknawyng quhat this ment, Eneas wight Becam abasit of the soddane syght, And can inquir the causys of this cace, Quhat war tha fludys far befor hys face, Or quhat bene tha men in syk numbyr swa With so gret fard flokkit to athir bra.

And efter that Anchises, hand in hand, Had thus his son led our all that land, And his curage inflambit by and by With the gret fame tocum and hie glory; Syne to this val?eant man he rekkynnys heir, Per ordour, all the batalis and the wer Quhilk eftir this he had to ber on hand; And of the pepill eik in Latyn land, And of the cite of the kyng Latyne, He him instrukkis; and tharefter syne Taucht him quhat wyss he myght sustene or fle Evir hard danger or aduersite.

Heir endis the sext buke of Eneados And heir begynnys the proloug of the sevynt buke [The Proloug of the Sevynt Buke] As bryght Phebus, scheyn souerane hevynnys e, The opposit held of hys chymmys hie, Cleir schynand bemys, and goldyn symmyris hew, In laton cullour alteryng haill of new, Kythyng no syng of heyt be hys vissage, So neir approchit he his wyntir stage; Reddy he was to entyr the thrid morn In clowdy skyis vndre Capricorn; All thocht he be the hart and lamp of hevyn, Forfeblit wolx hys lemand gylty levyn, Throu the declynyng of hys large round speir. The frosty regioun ryngis of the ?er, The tyme and sesson bittir, cald and paill, Tha schort days that clerkis clepe brumaill, Quhen brym blastis of the northyn art Ourquhelmyt had Neptunus in his cart, And all to schaik the levis of the treis, The rageand storm ourweltrand wally seys. Ryveris ran reid on spait with watir brovne, And burnys hurlys all thar bankis dovne, And landbrist rumland rudely with sik beir, So lowd ne rumyst wild lyoun or ber; Fludis monstreis, sik as meirswyne or quhalis, Fro the tempest law in the deip devalis. Mars occident, retrograde in his speir, Prouocand stryfe, regnyt as lord that ?er; Rany Oryon with his stormy face Bewavit oft the schipman by hys race; Frawart Saturn, chill of complexioun, Throu quhais aspect darth and infectioun Beyn causyt oft, and mortal pestilens, Went progressyve the greis of his ascens; And lusty Hebe, Iunoys douchtir gay, Stude spul?eit of hir office and array. The soyl ysowpit into watir wak, The firmament ourcast with rokis blak, The grond fadyt, and fawch wolx all the feildis, Montane toppis slekit with snaw ourheildis; On raggit rolkis of hard harsk quhyn stane With frosyn frontis cauld clynty clewis schane. Bewte was lost, and barrand schew the landis, With frostis hair ourfret the feldis standis. Seir bittir bubbis and the schowris snell Semyt on the sward a symylitude of hell, Reducyng to our mynd, in euery sted, Gousty schaddois of eild and grisly ded. Thik drumly skuggis dyrknyt so the hevyn, Dym skyis oft furth warpit feirfull levyn, Flaggis of fire, and mony felloun flaw, Scharpe soppys of sleit and of the snypand snaw. The dolly dichis war all donk and wait, The law valle flodderit all with spait, The plane stretis and euery hie way Full of floschis, dubbis, myre and clay. Laggerit leyis wallowit farnys schew, Brovne muris kythit thar wysnyt mossy hew, Bank, bra and boddum blanchit wolx and bar. For gurl weddir growit bestis hair. The wynd maid waif the red wed on the dyke, Bedowyn in donkis deip was euery sike. Our craggis and the front of rochis seir Hang gret ische schouchlis lang as ony speir. The grond stud barrant, widderit, dosk or gray, Herbis, flowris and gersis wallowyt away. Woddis, forrestis, with nakyt bewis blowt, Stude stripyt of thar weid in euery howt. So bustuusly Boreas his bugill blew, The deyr full dern doun in the dalis drew; Smale byrdis, flokkand throu thik ronys thrang, In chyrmyng and with cheping changit thar sang, Sekand hidlis and hyrnys thame to hyde Fra feirfull thuddis of the tempestuus tyde; The watir lynnys rowtis, and euery lynd Quhislit and brayt of the swouchand wynd. Puyr lauboraris and bissy husband men Went wait and wery draglit in the fen.

Repatyrrit weil, and by the chymnay bekyt, At evin be tyme dovne a bed I me strekyt, Warpit my hed, kest on clathis thrynfald, Fortil expell the peralus persand cald; I crosyt me, syne bownyt forto sleip, Quhar, lemand throu the glass, I dyd tak kepe Latonya, the lang irksum nyght, Hir subtell blenkis sched and watry lycht, Full hie vp quhirlyt in hir regioun, Till Phebus ryght in oppositioun, Into the Crab hir proper mansioun draw, Haldand the hight all thocht the son went law. Hornyt Hebowd, quhilk we clepe the nycht owle, Within hir cavern hard I schowt and ?owle, Laithly of form, with crukyt camscho beke, Vgsum to heir was hir wild elrich screke; The wild geiss claking eik by nyghtis tyde Atour the cite fleand hard I glyde. On slummyr I slaid full sad, and slepit sound Quhil the ori?ont vpwart gan rebound. Phebus crownyt byrd, the nyghtis orlager, Clapping his weyngis thryss had crawin cleir; Approching neir the greking of the day, Within my bed I walkynnyt quhar I lay; So fast declynys Synthea the moyn, And kays keklis on the ruyf aboyn; Palamedes byrdis crowpyng in the sky, Fleand on randon, schapyn like ane Y, And as a trumpat rang thar vocis soun, Quhois cryis bene pronosticatioun Of wyndy blastis and ventositeis; Fast by my chalmyr, in heich wysnyt treis, The soir gled quhislis lowd with mony a pew: Quhar by the day was dawyn weil I knew, Bad beit the fyre and the candill alyght, Syne blissyt me, and in my wedis dyght, A schot wyndo onschet a litill on char, Persauyt the mornyng bla, wan and har, With clowdy gum and rak ourquhelmyt the ayr, The sul?e stythly, hasart, rouch and hair, Branchis bratlyng, and blaknyt schew the brays With hirstis harsk of waggand wyndill strays, The dew droppis congelit on stibbill and rynd, And scharp hailstanys mortfundeit of kynd Hoppand on the thak and on the causay by. The schot I closit, and drew inwart in hy, Chyvirrand for cald, the sesson was so snell, Schupe with hayt flambe to fleym the fresyng fell. And, as I bownyt me to the fyre me by, Baith vp and down the howss I dyd aspy, And seand Virgill on a lettron stand, To write onone I hynt a pen in hand, Fortil perform the poet grave and sad, Quham sa fer furth or than begun I had, And wolx ennoyt sum deill in my hart Thar restit oncompletit sa gret a part. And to my self I said: “In gud effect Thou mon draw furth, the ?ok lyis on thy nek.” Within my mynde compasyng thocht I so, Na thing is done quhil ocht remanys ado; For byssynes, quhilk occurrit on cace, Ourvoluyt I this volume, lay a space; And, thocht I wery was, me list not tyre, Full laith to leif our wark swa in the myre, Or ?it to stynt for bitter storm or rane. Heir I assayt to ?ok our pleuch agane, And, as I couth, with afald diligens, This nixt buke following of profond sentens Has thus begun in the chil wyntir cald, Quhen frostis doith ourfret baith firth and fald. &amp;c.

Tho gan the sey of bemys walxin red, And heich abuf, dovn from the hevinly sted, Within hyr rosy cartis cleirly schane Aurora vestit into brovn sanguane. Eftir the wyndys lownyt war at will, And all the blastis pacefyit and still, Out our the calm streym of marbill gray With ayris palmys sweip thai furth thar way. And suddanly heir from the stabillit see A large semly schaw beheld Enee, Amyddis quham the flude he gan aspy Of Tybir flowand soft and esely, With sworland welis, and mekill ?allow sand, Into the sey dyd entyr fast at hand. The byrdis seir of mony diuerss hewis, About the watir, abuf vp in the clewis, On bankis weilbyknaw and fludis bay, Wyth wryblis sweit and myrthfull sangis gay Gan meyss and glaid the hevynnys and the ayr, And throu the schaw went fleand our alquhar. To turn thar courss he gan his feris command, And stevin thar schippis to the sammyn land; Ioyfull and blith thai entring in the flude, That dern about skuggyt with bewis stude. Now, thou my muse, Erato, I the pray, Do schaw me this, at I may scharply say Quhatkynd process of tyme was, and quhat kyngis In ald Latium, and in quhat stait all thingis, Quhen first this strange army or falloschip In Italy gan arryvyn, euery schip: I sall declar all, and reduce fut hait, From the begynnyng of the first debayt. O thou sweit goddes, O thou haly wight, Convoy and tech thy poet to say ryght! I sall the horribill batellis schaw and tell, The bludy ostis, and the feildis fell; Quhou, throw thar curage, douchty kyngis seir As ded corpss becum war, and brocht on beir; The power hale of all Tuscany, And all the gret rowtis of Italy Assemblit into armys on the land. Per ordour now thar risis apon hand Fer largear materis forto treit and write, A grettar wark begyn we to endyte. Tha boundis, with thar lusty citeis all, By lang proces of peax, in stait riall The king Latinus held in governyng; Or than full agyt was this nobill kyng, Quham, as we haue hard tald ful long agone, By Kyng Fawnus engendrit was apon The mayd or nymphe of Lawrent, Marica. And to this Fawnus fader was alssua Picus the kyng, quhilk doith the represent, Saturnus, for hys fader and parent: Thou was the fyrst gan all thar blude begyn, The first fundment and cheif stok of kyn. By dispositioun of the goddis dyvyn, Son nor manchild nane had Kyng Latyn, For alsmekill as his ?ong son, a page, Discessit was within his tendir age. The kyngis palice and all that riall hald, All hyr allane, a douchtir dyd with hald, Now reddy for a man, and cum to age In grene ?heris to compleit mariage. Full mony nobillis into Latium Axit hir to wyf, throu Itale all and sum: Turnus hir axis, cummyn of hie parage, Abuf all other maste gudly personage, And tharto rich of frendis, and myghty Of eldris gret and riall anchestry, Quham Kyng Latinus spowss, Queyn Amata, With diligens dyd procur, day by day, That he adionyt war thar son in law. Bot feirfull syngnys by the goddis schaw, And syndry terrouris gan tharto ganestand. Amyddis of the palyce closs dyd stand, With blisfull bewis, a fair grene lawrer, Haldyn in dreid and wirschip mony a ?er, Quham this ilk prynce and fader Latinus Dyd consecrat and hallow to Phebus, For that he fand it growand in the feild Quhar he hys ryall palyce first dyd beild: The indwellaris of the grond, efter this tre, Lawrentes onto name clepit hes he. Betyd a wondir takynnyng for to say: A gret flight of beys, on a day, Careit our the sey heich throu the moist ayr, With lowd bemyng gan alycht and repar On the hie top of this forsaid lawreir; Intill a clud ful thik togidder infeir, Thar feyt al sammyn knyt efter thar gyss, A swarm, or ony wyst quhou or quhat wyss, Hang from a florist branch of this ilk tre. Incontinent the spaymen cryis: “We se A strange man tocum onto thir partis With a gret rowt, and, fra the sammyn artis Quharfra ?on beis cam, sal hidder seik; Quhilk, for hys bonte and his thewis meke, Sall weild this palice and hie sen?eory.” Abuf this, eik, betyd a mar farly: As Kyng Latinus kyndillis, on thar gyss, Apon the altaris for the sacrefyis, The clene schidis of the dry fyre brandis, Quhar that also fast by hir fader standis Lavynya the maid, his douchter fair; A selcouth thing to se, in hir syde hair It semyt the hait fyre kyndillit bricht, And hir gay clething al with lowis lyght Gan gleit, and sperkland birn vp in a bless; Hir ryal tressis inflambit, evil at eyss; Hir crownel, picht with mony precyus stane, Infyrit all of byrnand flawys schane; And efter that semyt this gudly wight Tobe involuyt in ?allo reky lyght, And furth our al the place and rufe on hie The fyre blesys, thame semyt, skattirris sche. Certis, this was reput with ?yng and ald A grisly thing and wondrus to behald, For the diuinys declaris by and by Quhat this feirful takyn dyd signyfy: That is to knaw, at this ilk maid suld be Of fame excelland and felicite Bot to the pepill pronosticatioun cleir Of suddane batale and of mortal wer. Bot than the king, thochtfull and al pensyve Of sik monstreis, gan do seik belyve Hys fader Fawnus orator and answar, Quhilk couth the fatis for tocum declar; And gan inquiryng responsions alssua In the schaw vndre hie Albunea, Quhilk is a cheif gret forest, as thai tell, And namyt from a haly rowtand well, Quhar, from the erth, in dern wentis heir and thar, A strang flewyr thrawis vp in the ayr. Thiddir hail the pepil of Italia, And al the land eik of Onotrya, Thar dowtsum axyng tursis for ansuer, And thar petitions gettis assol?eit heir. The kingis offerand and rich sacryfyss The preist thidder gart bring, as was the gyss, And, vnder silence of the dirk nycht, On scheip skynnys, weil spred and couchit rycht, Quhilk slane war in the sacrifice that day, He strekis him adovne and tharon lay, Demandand swevynnys and visions til appeir. On mervellus wyss, thir fleand schaddoys seir And figouris nyss dyd he se and aspy, And diuerss vocis hard he eik fast by, And gan the goddis carping bruke and ioys, With speche of thai spretis that beyn ycloss In Achyron, the depest pyt of hell, And thame that far doun in Avernus dyd dwel. The kyng alsso, that tyme, atour the laif, Heir wald him self his answer ask and craif: Ane hundreth wollit wedderis, weil ganand, In sacryfyss he brytynnys for offerand, On quhais soft flesys, weil and dewly spreid, The kyng down liggis for that nyghtis bed. And suddanly, furth of the schawys closs, Sayand him thus, thar com a hasty voce: “O thou my child, cummyn of my stok, Adress the nevir to knyt into wedlok Thi dochter til a man of Latyn land; Lyppin nocht in ?on allyance reddy at hand. Tobe thi mawch sal cum ane alienar, That of his blude sal gendir sik ane air, Quhilk sal our name abufe the starnys vpbring; Of quhais stok the nevoys and ofspryng Vnder thar feit and lordschip salbehald All landis sterit and rewlit as thai wald, Als fer as that the son, circuland we se, Behaldis baith the est and westir seye.” Efter Eneas com to Itale land, Maid sacryfice to the goddis with offerand. The kyng thir ansueris of his fader Fawnus, And admonitions be nyght gevin thus, Ne hydis nocht nor closys in his moutht; So that the fame tharof walkis full couth Our all the citeis of Italy wyde quhar, Quhen as the ?onkeris of Troy arryvit war, And at the schor, vndre a gresy bank, Thar navy can thai ankyr fast and hank. Eneas, and othir chiftanys gloryus, And the fresch lusty springald Ascanius, Vndre the branchis of a semly tre Gan lenyng dovn and rest thar bodeys fre, And to thar dyner dyd thame all adress On grene herbis and sonkis of soft gerss. The flowr sconnys war set in by and by, With othir mesis, sik as war reddy; Syne bred trynschouris dyd thai fyl and charge With wild scrabbis and other frutis large. Betyd, as was the will of Iupiter, For falt of fude constrenyt so thai war, The other metis all consumyt and done, The paryngis of thar bred to mowp vp sone, And with thar handis brek, and chaftis gnaw, The crustis and the coffyngis all on raw; Ne spar thai not at last, for lake of met, Thar fatale four nukit trynschour forto eyt. “Och!” quod Ascanius, “quhou is this befall? Behald, we eyt our tabillis vp and all!” He said na mair bot this, half deil in board. Thame thocht thai hard a fatale voce or word, Quhilk was as finale end of thar vayage. Hys fader first of all, with glaid curage, The word reft from his mouth as that he spak, And followis on the answer stupefac: “All hail thou grond and land,” quod he, in hy, “By the fatis onto me destany, And ?e, O trast Penates,” said Enee, “Alhail our natyve goddis, weil ?e be! Heir is our dwelling place quhar we sall leynd, Forto remane heir is our cuntre heynd. Certis, now I ramembir my fader Anchyss Syk secret takynnys of fatis on this wyss Schew and rehersit, sayand this to me: ‘Son, quhen in sik hungyr thou stad salbe, As thou art careit till a strange cost, That, all the mesis etyn, done and lost, Thou art constrenyt thy burdis gnaw and fret, Than thou, al irkyt, may thar beleif to get A sovir duelling sted perpetualy. Ramembir, in that place, or neir fast by, To found thy first cite with thi hand, Dychit with fowsys and wallys hie standand.’ This was that hungir tareit ws so lang, This sall mak end of our myschevis strang. Quharfor, tomorow ayrly, I ?ou pray, First as the son vpryss, we glaidly may Serss and inquir quhat place and land is this, Or quhat maner of pepill tharin duellis, And of thys kyth quhar standis the cheif cite; Lat ws seik syndry ways fra the see. Now mak we mery, away dolf hartis dull, Now skynk, and offer Iupiter cowpis full, And in ?our prayeris and orisons infeir Do call apon Anchyss, my fader deir! Bryng wyne agane, set in tharof plente!” And sayand thus, with a grene branch of tre He dyd involup and aray his hed, And Genyus, the god of that ilk sted, He dyd wirschip, and gan in prayeris call Erth, the gret moder and first god of all, The nymphis and the fludis ?it onknaw, The nycht syne, with hir syngnys al on raw, And Iupiter Ideus of Ida, And Cibylla the mother in Phrigia; He gan also beseik, quhar that thai dwell, Athir of his parentis baith in hevin and hell. The fader than almychty with cleyr lycht Gan thundir thryss dovn from the hevynnys hycht; And schakand in his hand, quhar as he went, A byrnand clowd schew from the firmament, With fyry sparkis lyke to goldyn bemys Or twynkilland sprayngis with thar giltin glemys, And tho belyve dywlgat round abowt is The noyss and rumour throu the Troiane rowtis, The day was cummyn, and the place quhar thai Thar cite promist suld beld and array. For ioy thai pyngill than fortill renew Thar bankettis with all obseruancis dew, And, for thir tithingis, in flacon and in skull Thai skynk the wyne, and wauchtis cowpis full. Quhou Eneas ambassatouris dyd send To Kyng Latyn with rewardis and commend. The nixt morow, with his goldin lamp bryght As the cleir day dyd ayr and erth alycht, Thai boundis, costis and the cheif cite Diuerss spyis went furth to serss and se, And fand ane stank that flowyt from a well Quhilk Munycus was hait, and eik thai tell This was the flude of Tibir thai had fund, And strang Latyn pepill inhabyt this ground. Thar with Anchises son, the wyss Enee, Per ordour chosyn of euery degre Ane hundreth gay ambassatouris dyd waill, To pass onto the kyngis sted riall, Bad bair the prynce rewardis for the nanys, And him beseik of peax to the Troianys. With fresch garlandis and branchis all thai be Arrayt of the olyve of Pallas tre; And but delay, as he thame chargit had, With swyft payss thai on thar message glaid. And he into the meyn tyme fast can spur Bot with a smal sewch, or a litill fur, To mark the fundment of his new cite; And fast by the ilk costis syde of the see Hys first mansioun, in maner as it had bene Ane ost of tentis stentit on the grene, With turettis, fowsy and erd dikis ilk deill, He gan address to closing wonder weill. Be this the ?ong men send furth in message Sa far has sped furthwart thar vayage, That thai the towris and the turettis hie Of Kyng Latyn the cheif chymmys gan se. Vndre the cite wall childir and pagis And lusty springaldis, al of tendir agis, Thar horssis and thar stedis dyd assay, And dantit cartis in the dusty way; And sum thar big bowis dyd bend and draw, Sum with armys leyt trymland dartis thraw, Baith with swyft curss and schuting so thai wirk, Ilkane bissy his party forto irk. Than, careit on ane horss, a messynger Brocht tithingis to the ancient kyngis eyr, A gret men?e of sturdy men war cum, Cled in a strange habyt all and sum. The kyng bad bryng thame in his palyce sone, And set hym self amyd his eldris troyn. Thar stude a gret tempill or sail ryall, Of Lawrent cite seyt imperiall, Belt with a hundreth staitly pillaris hie, Of Kyng Picus the chymmys cheif to se, With semly schawys circulit, and lang hald In wirschip and reuerence be faderis ald; Quhar was statut by the consent common The kyngis suld ressaue ceptur and crovn, And of iustice other ensen?eis seir, And thar the baner fyrst rayss for the weir. In this tempill held thai curt on raw; That was the set eik by thar gentil law Deput for hallowit fest and mangeory; And heir full oft at burdis by and by The heris war wont togidder syt all sam, Quhen britnyt was, eftir thar gyss, the ram. And forthir eik, per ordour mycht ?e knaw Within the cheif deambulatour on raw Of forfaderis gret ymagis dyd stand, Of ald cedir carvyt with crafty hand: Kyng Italus, and fader Sabinus That first the wyne tre plantit, stok or buss (The crukyt huke vndre hys weid held he); The ancyent kyng Saturn thar mycht thou se, And Ianus statur eyk with dowbill face, With other pryncis porturyt in that place, From the begynnyng of thar first discens, Quhilk, of thar natyve cuntre for defens, In marcyal batale sufferit woundis sair. Apon the postis alsso mony a pair Of harnes hang, and cart quhelis gret plente, From ennemys war wonnyn in melle; The bowand axis, helmys with hie crestis, Of rich citeis ?ettis, stapillis and restis, Gret lokkis, slottis, massy bandis sqwair, Dartis and scheildis hyngis heir and thar, And stalwart stevynnys, baith of irne and tre, Reft from thir schippis fechtand on the see. The ymage porturit was of Kyng Pycus, Dantar of horssis, in chair sat gloryus, Cled in a ryal rob auguriall, And in his hand a ceptre wand riall, And in his left hand haldand a bukleir; Quham, revist for his luf, throu vennomys seir, Circes hys spouss smate with a goldin wand, And in a byrd hym turnyt fut and hand With sprutlyt weyngis, clepit a Speicht with ws, Quhilk in Latyn hait Pycus Marcyus. Kyng Latyn speris the causs of thar cummyng, And Ilioneus maid gudly ansueryng. In sik a tempill of goddis Latyn kyng, Amyd his faderis set ryall sytting, Gart fech the Troianys to his presens heir, And as thai entrit, and befor him wer, With glaid semlant and vissage ful benyng Thir wordis first to thame carpis the king: “Say me, Troianys, quhat ?e desire,” quod he, “For weil we knaw ?our lynage and cite, And it is alsso cummyn to our erys ?e set ?our courss our se thir mony ?eris; Schaw for quhat causis, or quhat necessite, ?our schippis our sa feill haw stremys of see Beyn hiddir to this cost of Italy Careit or dryve, or quhidder ?our navy Has errit by thar courss, and far gone will, Or ?it by forss of storm catchyt hiddertill, As oft wil happin by the frawart tyde To marynaris on fludys deip and wyde.

Be al Eneas destaneis I sweir, Hys trasty faith, or rycht hand into weir Sa val?eand at onset and defens, And by his lang wse and experiens Of armys, quhilk he hes in batale hantit: Ful mony pepil, victoryus, ondantit, Desirit ws in frendschip and ally, And tobe ionyt in thar sen?eory; Nor lichtly not forthy our frendly proffer, Quhilk of our fre will onrequirit we offir, With wordis of request and of trety, The takynnys in our handis born vp hye; For oft the fatis of the goddis seir Hass ws compellit by thar strang power Onto ?our landis and thir costis seik.

And forthir eik our prince hes to the sent Of his ald fortoun bot a smal present, The sobir levyngis reft from Troys fyre. Into this cowp of gold Anchiss hys syre At the altar was wont to sacrify; And of the gret kyng Pryam, mast douchty, This was the cheif dyademe our the laif, With quham he crownyt sat and domys gaif; Hys ceptre als, and eik his tyar hat, Hallowit quharwith at sacrifice he sat; And this was eik hys precius rob ryall, By Troiane ladeis wrocht and brusyt all.” Herand sic wordis of Ilioneus, Ful stil his vissage haldis Latynus; Hys syght onmovyt to the erd dyd he prent, Witht eyn rollyng, and erys rycht attent. The brusyt purpur movis hym na thing, Nor Priamus ceptour sa sar steris the kyng, As that he musys thochtfull gretumly Apon his douchteris spousage and ally, And in his mind gan cumpas oft infeir His fader Fawnus responss and answer, Thynkand this ilk Eneas semyt tobe The self stranger, quham fatale destanee Signyfeit tocum furth of ane vncouth sted, Tobe his son in law, and forto led Equale dignite with him in that ryng, Ful of souerane vertu, quhais ofspring By thar power suld ioys and occupy The haill warld vndre thar sen?eory. And at the last, efter ful lang musyng, Witht ioyus cheir on this wyss said the kyng: “The goddis ?our begynnyng furthir and speid, And thar pronosticatioun manifest in deid.

Ontil Eneas als, thar prynce absent, A ryal chair richly arrayit he sent, With twa stern stedis tharin ?ok infeir, Cummyn of the kynd of hevinly horssis wer, At thar neyss thirlys the fyre fast sneryng owt; Of the ilke stok and stude sprungyn, but dowt, Quhilk Circes, crafty and engenyus, And mar subtell than evir was Dedalus, Be a quent way fra hir awin fader staw, Makand his stedis byleip meris onknaw, That by hir sle consait and wily mynd Sik maner horss engendrit of bastard kynd.

Quharfor the mar sobirly furth with all, Eftir the common custum and vsage Of ald matronys in thar wyld dotage, With huge complaynt for hir dochter and regrate, And Troiane wedlok contrar hir consate, Thus said scho weping, and that ful petuusly: “O fader Kyng Latyn, quhy wilt thou, quhy?

As sum tyme sclentys the round tap of tre, Hyt with the twynyt quhip dois quhirl, we se, Quham childyr dryvis bissy at thar play Abowt the closs and voyd hallis all day, Scho smyttyn with the tawys dois rebound, And rynnys about, abowt, in cirkill round: The wytless sort of forsaid babbys ?yng Studeis awondrit of sa nyce a thing, This turnyt tre so all that berdless rowt Ferleis to se swa sleip and quhirl abowt, And all thar mynd settis it to cach and dryve— Na slawar went Amata, the kyngis wife, Throw owt the myd citeis of Latyn land, And throu the ferss pepill, fra hand to hand. And forthir eik, onto the woddis grene With swyft fard catchys furth this quene, Fen?eand the rage of Bacchus, and gret mycht, A mar myschefe forto controve and slycht, And grettar fury swyth scho can begyn; Hyr douchter hyd thir woddy hillys within, Tharby the Troiane spousage to delay, Stop and prolong thar fest and brydell day.

Alecto thus, amang the woddis dern, Mony wild bestis den and depe cavern, Into sic rage this ilk Queyn Amata With Bacchus fury catchis to and fra. And efter that this wikkit fals goddes Thocht scho had scharpit weill eneuch, I gess, The first fury of sa dolorus rage, Fortyll distrubbill the forsaid mariage, And quyte pervert or turnyt top our taill Latynus howshald, purposs and counsale, But mar delay, with wallowit weyngis sche Wiskis from thyne onto the wallis hie Of the curageus Rutiliane Turnus, Quhilk cite the douchter of Acrysyus, Fair Danas, fundyt for hir men and hir, Drevin to that cost with the south wyndis bir; Quhilk sted was sumquhile clepit Ardea, Fra Ardea, a fowle, ?it namyt swa, And, to this day, the forsaid riall hame Be fortoun brukis of Ardea the name. Within tha hyghty boundis Turnus rycht Lay stil at rest amyddis the dirk nycht. Alecto hir thrawin vissage dyd away, Al furyus membris laid apart and array, And hir in schap transformyt of a trat, Hyr forret skorit with runclys and mony rat, And with a vaill ourspred hir lyard hair, A branch of olyve tharto knyttis ?ar; Of Iunoys tempill semyt scho tobe The nun and trattes, clepit Calybe. Befor the visage of this stowt ?ong knycht Present hir self, with thir wordis on hicht: “Turnus, quhat, wylt thou suffir this ondocht, Thy lang travale and laubour be for nocht, And thy ceptre and crown delyuerit be To ?on banyst new cum Troiane men?e?

Lat Kyng Latynus feil to his awyn harmys, And haue experiens of the, Turnus, in armys, Bot he the grant to wife his child Lavyne, And kepe to the hys promyss and convyne.” The ?yng man mokkand at the prophetes, Herand sic speche, answeris with mouth express: “It standis not so as thou wenys, but weris: The messynger is nocht gone by myne erys, Full lang or now, quhou that a strange navy Arryvit in this Tibris streme fast by. Fen?e na cawsis me fortill effray: Weyn not me list my purposs leif na nay, Nor ryall Iuno, quene of realmys all, List our querrell for?et, nor thoil we sall. Bot, O ald dame, thy vile onweldy age, Ourset with hasart hair and faynt dotage, Quhilk voyd is of all treuth and verite, In sic curys invane occupyis the, And the dissavis, as prophet, be fals dreid, That gevis thi mynd tharon thou has na heid, As forto treyt of batalis betweix kyngis. Thyne occupatioun standis on othir thingis, Quhilk suld haue cure of nocht alanerly Bot goddis tempillis and ymagis to spy: Thoill men of pess and wer carp and rehers, Quhamto pertenys the batalis to exers.” At sic wordis Alecto, hait as fyre, Brynt in hir fury rage and felloun ire, So that, the ?ong man spekand, suddanly The trymlyng hynt all membris of his body; His eyn stud abasyt in his hed; This hellis monstre, full of wreth and fed, Hyssyt and quhislyt with sa feill eddir sondis, And hir figour sa grysly gret abundis, With glowrand eyn byrnand of flawmys blak. Turnus awondryng styntis and drawis abak, And, as he purposit mekill mar to say, Insted of haris scho rasit vp serpentis tway, And of hir scurge the sound scho made him heir; With rageand mouth syne said and fellown beir: “Behald, is this my vile onweldy age, Ourset with hasart hair and faynt dotage, Quham eild, void of al trewth and verite, Be fals dreid dissavys so?” quod sche. “As forto treyt of batale betwix kyngis, Behald gif it so be, consider thir syngis! Lo me present, ane of the sisteris thre, Infernal fureis of feirfull hellis see! Se, I bar in my handis and power The ded of batalis and the mortale wer.” And sayand thus, at this ilk fers ?yng knycht Ane hait fyre brand kest scho byrnand brycht, And in hys breste this furyus lemand schide With dedly smok fixit deyp can hyde. The huge dreid with this dissoluyt his slepe, Our all his body bristling furth dyd crepe The warm swait throw euery lith and bane, And all enragit can eftir harnes frane; Armour all wytles in his bed sekis he, Armour our all the lugyng law and hie. The gret curage of irne wapynnys can waid Cruell and wild, and all his wyt invaid In wikkit wodnes batale to desire, Quharon he byrnys hait in felloun ire— Lyke as quhen that the ingill of stikkis dry With blesand sownd is layd to by and by, About the sydis of the pot playing, The licour sparklis for the heyt bulyng; Within, the fervent bullyr violent Of watir makyng reky froith vpsprent; So swellis vp the skum and bellis bedene, The veschell may na mar the broth contene, Bot furth it poplys in the fyre heir and thar, Quhill vp fleys the blak stew in the air. And for alsmekill as Turnus thus was stad, The gretast of hys chiftanys go he bad To Kyng Latyn, and him declar, but wer, The paix was brokyn, and he wald move the were; To graith thar armour fast commandis he, To defend Ital, and of thar awin cuntre Thar ennemyss expell and dryve; as ?it He was eneuch for baith, he leyt thame wyt, Baith to recuntyr the Latynys and Troianys. Quhen this was said, and, on sik wyss as ganys, The goddis callit tobe in thar helping, Than bissely Rutilianys, our all thing, Can athir othir fast exhort and pray On thar best wyss for werfar to purvay. Sum the maste semly farrand personage Tistys to the feild, to preif his grene curage, Sum on his ?outhed, and his thewes gude; Sum is movit throw hys ryall blude, For hys progenitouris noble kyngis wer; And sum war eik inducit to the weir For hie prowes knawin in ilke landis, And dedis wrocht maste knychtly with his handis. Ascanyus huntand hass a taym hart hurt, Quhilk was the first moving of strife and sturt. Quhill Turnus on this wyss, about all partis, In the Rutilyanys rasys hardy hartis, Alecto towart Troianys, but mair tary, With hir infernall weyngis furth can cary. By ane new slycht a place spyit hes sche, Quhar, for the tyme, by the cost of the see, The ?yng semly Ascanyus at solace Dyd hunt the wild deir, followyng the chace. Thar suddanly this hellis wench infest Ane hasty fury on his hundis kest; Thar ness thirlys with a sover sent Scho fillis so, that bissely thai went Eftir the fute of a taym hart, quhilk thing Was the first causs of weirfar and fechtyng, And first sterit the wild fosteris fell To move debait, or mak thame for batell. This hart of body was baith gret and squar, With large hed, and tyndis burnyst far, Quham childir of ane Tyrrheus thame amang, Reft from his moderis pap, had nurysit lang; Tyrrheus thar fader was fee master and gyde Of studis, flokkis, bowis and heirdis wide, As storour to the kyng, dyd kepe and ?ym, Of the large plane all trast was gevin to hym. Full dantit and full taym at thar command Was so becum this best, that, but demand, Siluya thar sister with all diligens Arrayt hym of flowris sweit as sens; Oft plet scho garlandis for his tyndis hie; The deir also full ofttyme kem wald sche, And feil syss wesch intil a fontane cleir. Full weil sufferit hir handis the tame deir, And was accustomyt so quhen he list eyt, At his awin masteris burd to seik his meyt. Our all the woddis wald he raik ilk day, And at evin tide return hame the strecht way Till hys lugyng weilbekend, fute hait, All by him self, war the nycht neuer so lait. This hart, errand far from hys resset, Ascanyus wod hundis ombeset, As that, per cace, for the hait sonnys gleme, He held doun swymmand the cleir ryver streme, To cuyll hys heyt vnder a gresy bra. Ascanyus the child hym self alssua, Byrnyng in desire of sum notable renown, With nokkyt bow ybent all reddy bown, Wenand hym wilde, leyt sone ane arow glide; The goddes was all reddy fast besyde, That can hys hand address but waveryng; The flane flaw fast with a spang fra the stryng; Throw owt the wame and entrellis all, but stynt, The scharp hedit schaft duschit with the dynt. The deir, so dedly woundit and to laym, Onto his kynd resset can fleyng hame, And entrys in his stall, and that onon, All blude besprent, with mony grank and gron, And like a man besocht help and supple; With hys plenyng all the howss fillis he. Siluya, the eldast sister, with a schowt, Hir handis clappyng fast hir schulderis abowt, Cryis efter help, and can togidder call The landwart folkis and dowr foresteris all. Thai tho assemblit to the fray in hy And flokkis furth rycht fast onwarnystly, For the ilk fury pestilenciall that hour Full prevely in the dern wod dyd lowr To cast on thame slely hir feirfull rage, That furth vpstartis bath wife, man and page, He with a burdon of ane lang stif tre, The poynt scharpit and brynt a litill we, He with a knotty club and knorry hed; Quhat ilk man fand first reddy in that sted, Sekand a swerd, new rynnand fra the pleuch, Thar greif maid that thing wapyn gud eneuch. Tyrrheus, the master storour, in a rowt The churlys all assemlyt hym abowt, Quhar as, per cace, byssy with weggis he Stude schidand a four squarit akyn tre, With mony pant, with fellon hauchis and quakis, Als oft the ax rebundit of the strakis. This cruell goddes, feirful Alecto, Fortill ennoy hir tyme espyit tho, And spelis vp ful sone, as scho war wod, Apon a heich stabill quhar that bestis stude. Right bustuusly apon the rufe on hie The hyrdys ensen?e lowd vp trumpis sche, And in a bowand horn, at hir awin will, A feyndlich hellis voce scho liltis schill, At quhais sovnd all trymlyt the forest, The dern woddis resondit est and west, The blast was hard thens mylis mony ane At the deip lowch of Triuia or Dyane; The dyn was hard eik ellis quhar ful far At the sulphuryus quhite ryvar callit Nar, And at the laik or fontane of Velyne. Baith to and fro our all the cuntre syne Wemen and moderis, effrayt of this cace, Thar ?yng childring fast to thar brestis dyd brace. Than spedely, with haste and bissy far, The laubouraris ondantit heir and thar Hynt wapynnys, and assemlyt on euery side Towart the sovnd, quhar as the trump that tyde With dedly voce blew this feirfull syng: The Troiane power alsso can furth thring With haill rowtis, Ascanyus to reskew. The batalis war adionyt now of new, Nocht in maner of landwart folkis bargane With hard blokkis raschand all ourane, Nor blunt steyngis of the byrsillit tre, Bot with scharp scherand wapynnys maid melle. The grond blaknyt and feirfull wolx alssua: Of drawyn swerdis sclentyng to and fra The brycht mettale, and othir armouris seir, Quharon the sonnys blenkis betis cleir, Glitteris and schane, and vnder bemys brycht Castis ane new twynklyng or a lemand lycht. This stour sa bustuus begouth to ryss and grew, Lyke as the sey changis first hys hew In quhite lippiris by the wyndis blast; Syne peiss and peys, the flude boldnys so fast, Quhill finaly the wallis vprysis mar, That fra the grund it warpis vp in the air. At the first cuntre into this bargane Almon, Tyrrheus eldast son, was slane, A fair ?yng springald, quhilk caucht dedis wond Throw dynt of arrow schot with felloun sound, That smate hym rycht evin in at the halss bone; The loppirrit blude stoppyt hys aynd onone, And closyt in of lyfe the tendir spreit. Abowt hym fell down ded, and lost the sweit, Mony of the hyrdmen, amangis quham was ane, The eldar Galesus, as that he allane Offerit hym self amyd the ostis tway, To treit concord of pess and of the fray, Quhilk was the iustast of a rurall man And mychtyast in hys tyme levyng than; Our all the boundis of Ausonya Hys fyve flokkis pasturyt to and fra, Fyve bowis of ky ontil his hame reparit, And with ane hundreth plewis the land he aryt. Fra the first slauchter maid apon this wyss, Turnus and al the pepill for batal cryis. And as this bargane on this maner ?eid In plane feld and evinly batale sted, This hellis goddes, ioysing at hir will Hir promys, quhilk scho hecht forto fulfill, Alssone as was this gret melly begun, The erth littyt with blude and al ourrun, And the first slauchter was commyt and done In dedly weir; than Italy alssone Scho levis, and with swift fard can do fle Throw owt the skyis to the hevynnys hie, Haiffand hir purpos, said with woce ful prowd, Onto Iuno thus spak scho throw a clowd: “Lo, now, discord perfornyst, as thou wald, With schrewit batale and carys monyfald! In tender frendschip lat thame now convene, Knyt vp allyance and falloschip bedene, Sen that I haue the Troianys all bysprent With blude of the Italyanys, or I went, And, gif thi mynd be ferm tharto with me, I sal thus mekill eik to my wark,” quod sche, “Fortill induce the citeis adiacent Onto the bargane, or that I hyne went.

Weill ar perfurnyst causys of this weir perfay: Thai feght togidder mydlit on the land, Baith face for face, with drawin glavis in hand, And new sched blude littis thar armour cleyr, Quhilk thai by fortoun cawch haue first in weir. ?on worthy squyer of Venus blude and kyn, And King Latynus, now lat thame begyn Sik wedlok to contract and spousale feste.

Gif ony chance restis mar tobedone, I sall my self that mater rewle and gy.” Thir wordis spak Iuno; and scho tharwith in hy Hir dowbill weyngis with edder sound dyd bete, Levand the hevynnys, socht to hir hellis sete. Amyddis Itall, vnder hillys law, Thar standis a famus sted weil beknaw, That for his bruyt is namyt in mony land, The vail Ansanctus hait, on athir hand Quham the sydis of a thik wod of tre Closis full dern with skowgy bewys hie. A rowtand burn amydwart tharof rynnys, Rumland and soundand on the craggy quhynnys, And eik forgane the brokkyn brow of the mont Ane horribill cave with braid and large front Thar may be sene, a thyrl or ayndyng sted Of terribill Pluto, fader of hell and ded; A ryft or swelch so grysly for to se, Till Acheron revin dovne, that hellis see, Gapand with his pestiferus gowle full wide; At quhais bysme the fury can down slyde, This hutit goddes, and by that discens Delyverit hevyn and erd of hyr presens. And netheless, duryng the meyn sesson, The queyn hir self, Saturnus get, onon Set to hyr hand, and ondyd the batell. Off hyrdmen all the rowtis with a ?ell Ruschit fra the feild to the cite but tary, The sclane bodeis away with thame dyd cary— Almon the child, and ded Galesus als, With blud bysparkyt vissage, hed and halss. Thai thyg vengeance at the goddis, and syne Thai raym and cry fast on the kyng Latyne. Turnus was by, and amyd this deray, Thys hait fury of slauchtir and fell affray, The terrour dowblis he and feirfull dreid, That sik forloppyn Troianys at this neid Suld thankfully be resset in that ryng, Or Phrigiane blude confiderat with the kyng, And he furth of tha boundis tobe expellit. The self tyme eyk, for the matronys at ?ellit And roundis sang so in thar wilde dotage, In the dern woddis, smyttyn with Bacchus rage, Gret rowtis dyd assembill thyddir in hy, And rowpyt eftir batale ernystfully; Thar the detestabill weris euer in ane, Agane the fatis all, thai cry and rane, Contrar answeris and dispositions all Of goddis, for the weir thai clepe and call. Led by the power and frawart godhed Of cruell Iuno with ald ramembrit fed. Full fast thai thryng about the kyngis palyce, Bot this ilk Latyn, knawand thar malyce, Rasistis onmovit as a rok of the see, Quham, with gret brute of watir smyt, we se Hym self sustenys by hys huge wecht Fra wallis feill, in all thar byr and swecht Iawpyng about hys skyrtis with mony a bray; Skelleis and famy craggis thai assay, Rowtand and rarand, and may not empar, Bot gif thai sched fra his sydis the wair. So, eftir that the kyng mycht nocht resist Thar blynd purpos, for as evir Iuno list The mater went, all set to cruelte; Full mony goddis and the hevynnys hie To wytnes drew he, all was by his will, Bot all for nocht, na tent was take thartill. “Allace,” he said, “we ar tobroke and ryve By the fatis, by storm catchit and dryve. O, O, ?e wrachit pepill!” gan he cry, “With cruell pane full deir ?he sall aby This wilfull rage, and with ?our blude express The wrangis of sic sacrilege redress. O Turnus, Turnus, full hard and hevy wraik And sorofull vengeance ?it sal the ourtake, Quhen, al to lait, in thy helpyng thou sall With prayeris on the goddis clepe and call. For I had fund my rest and eyss,” quod he, “Now at the dur deth reddy bydis me, Quhar now of happy pompis funeral I spul?eit am, and sik triumphe riall.” Na mor sayng, with that ilk word fut het Ful closs within his palice he him schet, Of all sik thingis gaue our the cure and charge, Sen na better mycht be, to go at large. The portis of weir to twich the prynce refusis, Quhilkis Iuno brekis, syne al for batal musis. The maner than was, and the ald custum Within the land of ancyent Latyum, Quhilk blissit vsance efter mony a day The citeis and faderis of Alba kepit ay, Now the gret master souerane cite dyng Of Rome kepis and hantis the self thing; That is to knaw, quhen first thai move or steir The marciall ensen?eis for the wer, Quhidder so thai list to set with ostis plane On the Gethys, pepill Tartareane, With dolorus and with ful lamentable wer In Hyrcany or Araby to steir, Or fortil ettill in to Inde furth eik, Towart the dawyng and son rysyng to seik, Or ?it til ask and reduce hame agane Thar standartis from the dowr pepill Persane. Twa portis beyn of batale and debait, So thai war clepit to thar name, and hait, Haldyn in religioun of haly reuerence Of Martys cruel dreid and his offence; A hundreth brasyn hespis thame claspit queym, And strenthy irne slottis, that dyd seym Tobe eternal and inconsumptive; Nor Ianus, kepar of this entre of strive, Was no quhile furth of this ilk hallowit hald. Bot quhen the ferm sentens of faderis ald Was ony tyme determyt to move weir, Than he that was cheif duke or consuler, In rob ryall vestit, that hait Quyryne, And rich purpour, eftir the gyss Gabyne, Gyrd in a garmont semly and fut syde, Thir ?ettis suld vp oppin and warp wyde; Within that girgand hirst alsso suld he Pronunce the new weir, batale and melle; Quham all the fensabill men suld follow fast, With plane assent and brasyn trumpis blast. The kyng Latyn furthwith command thai than On this maner, as prince and grettast man, To proclame weir and decrete the melle Agane Troianys, thidder cum with Ene, And warp tha sorofull ?ettis vp on breid. The prynce refusyt to do sa vile a deid, Ne list not anys thame twich, nor brek his heist, Sor agrevit planely ganestud thar requeste, And in his secret closet hym withdrew. Than from the hevin downe quhirland with a quhew Come Queyn Iuno, and with hir awin handis Dang vp the ?ettis, brak but delay the bandis: This cruell douchter of the ald Saturn The marbill hirst can weltir and ourturn, And strang ?et chekis of weirfar and batell Strake down, and rent the gret irne postis fell. Onsterit lang tyme, and onmovit, Ital Now byrnys into fury bellicall. Sum grathis thame on fut to go in feild; Sum hie montit on horsbak vnder scheld The dusty pulder vpdryvand with a stour, And euery man socht wapynnys and armour; Thar schynand scheildis sum dyd burnys weill, And sum polist scharp speir hedis of steill, To mak thame brycht with fat creisch or same, And on quhitstanys thar axis scharpis at hame; To beir pynsellis it gladis thame vp and dovne, And ar reiosyt to heir the trumpettis sovne. Fyve the grettast and maist cheif citeis, Thar wapynnys to renew in al degreis, Set vp forgis and steil styddeis fyne; Rych Atyna, and the prowd Tyburyn, Ardea the cite, and Crustumere, And eik Antemne with strang towris he And weirly wallis battellit about, The sikkyr helmys penys and forgis owt; Thar targettis bow thai of the lycht sauch tre, And boss bukleris coverit with cuyrbul?e; Sum steil hawbrikis forgis furth of playt, Burnyst flaukartis and leg harnes, fut hait, With latit sowpill siluer weill annelit; All instrumentis of pleuch graith, irnyt or stelit, As cultyris, sokkis and the somys gret, With sythis and al hukis at scheris quhet, War thidder brocht and tholis temper new. The lust of all sik wark lomys was adew: Thai dyd thame forge in swerdis of mettel brycht, Forto defend thar cuntre and thar rycht. Be this, thar armour grathit and thar geir, The draucht trumpet blawis the brag of weir; The sloggorn ensen?e, or the wach cry, Went for the batale all suldbe reddy. He pullis down his sellet quhar it hang, Sum deill effrayt of the noys and thrang; He dryvis furth the stampand horss on raw Onto the ?ok, the chareottis to draw; He clethis hym with his scheld, and semys bald; He claspis hys gilt habirgyon and thrynfald; He, in his breistplait strang and his byrne, A sover swerd beltis law down by his the. The poet makis to goddis his prayer, Dewly to compt the folkis grathis for this weir. ?he Musys now, sweit goddessis ichone, Oppyn and onschet ?our mont of Helycone, Reveil the secretis lyand in ?our myght, Addres my stile, and steir my pen go rycht, Entone my sang, and til endyte me leir Quhat kyngis dyd remufe furth to this weir, Quhat rowtis followit euery prynce in feild, With ostis braid that dyd the plane ourheld, With quhat maner of val?eand men sik ways The happy grund Ital flurist tha days, With quhatkyn armys it enflambit schane: Furthschaw thir ancyent secretis euery ane. ?he blissyt wightis forsuyth ramembris weill All sic thingis, and, quhar ?ou list, may reveill, Thocht scarsly, for the process of lang ?eris, Be smal rumour tharof cum tyl our erys. First, from the land and costis hait Tyrreyn, Onto the batale bownys stern and keyn Me?entius the kyng, that in hys day Contempnar clepit was of the goddis ay. The gydar of hys army and hys rowt Was hys son Lawsus, val?eant and stowt, Abuf all other the maste semly wight, Except the person of Turnus the gentil knycht, Quhilk was the flour of all the Lawrenteis. This Lawsus was weil taucht at all degreis To dant gret horss, and as hym list arrest, Hunt and doun bet the deir and ilk wild best. A thousand men he led of hys convyne From Corete the cite Agilyne. Worthy he was to rewle a gret empyre, And tobe cummyn of sum mar happy syre Than of Me?entyus, banyst and indyng, Bot to haue beyn sum emperouris son or kyng. The lusty Aventynus nixt in press Hym followis, the son of worthy Hercules. Throu gresy planys hys char with palm ryall Was rollit furth by horss victoriall, Quhilk, in hys musteris, schew he in the feild Hys faderis takynnys merkit in his scheld, Ane hundreth eddris and other snakis in sete Lynkit abowt of Larn the serpent gret; Quhom the nun Rhea and woman dyvyne In the dern wod of the mont Aventyne Bair and brocht furth onto this warldis lycht. Ful prevely, onknaw of ony wight, The woman mydlit with the god went bond, Eftir this ilk Hercules had brocht to grond And venquyst Gereon with prowd bodeis thre, Syne in the feild besyde Lawrent cite Was entrit as hym lyst to tak his rest, Hys Span?e oxin, quhom hym likit best, Dyd bathing and refresch, to mak thame clene, In Ital strandis at the cost Tyrrhene. This Aventinus followis in thir werys, Bair in his handis lans stafis and burrel speris And dangerus facheonys into staffis of tre; With round stok swerdis faucht thai in melle, With poyntalis, or with stokis Sabellyne. Thar capitane, this ilke strang Aventyne, Walkis on fut, hys body wymplit in A felloun bustuus and gret lyon skyn, Terribill and roucht, with taty lokkyrrand haris; The quhite tuskis, the hed and clowis thar is: And on sik wyss, grym and awfull to se, Within the kingis gret palyce entris he, Our his schuldris hyngand, as said is plane, His faderis talbart cote Herculeane. Twa brederyng to this batale bownys syne, Furth of the wallit cite Tiburtyne, Ledyng thai pepill namyt, ane and other, Fra Tiburtus, that was thar eldar brother; And thai war clepit, the tane Catillus, And tother Coras, strang and curageus, Stowt ?yng men, Grekis born of Arge bath twane. Befor the formast ostis in the plane Amyd a buss of speris in raid thai, Generit of the clowd lyke to Centaures tway, Quhen, fra the montane top of Homolane, Or snawy Otryn hill, downe to the plane, With felloun fard and swift curss he and he Can do discend, levand the holtis hie; The large wod makis placis to thar went, Buskis withdrawys, and branchis al to rent Gan rattillyng and resound of thar deray, To red thar renk, and romys thame the way. Nor Ceculus was not absent, trast me, The foundar of the cite Preneste, Quham all eyldis reputis and schawis ws Engendrit was by the god Vlcanus, And by the fyre syd fund, a ?yng fundlyng, Our landwart bestis syne wolx lord and kyng. A hail legioun in a rowt followis hym Of wild wod men, quhilk doys thir catel ?ym; All thai pepill on breid, baith he and he, That inhabitis the heich tovn Preneste, And thai that occupyit the feildis alsso Of Gabyne, quhilkis ar dedicat to Iuno; And thai that duellis langis the chil ryver Of Anyene, and thai alsso infeir Amang the dewy strandis and craggis remanys Of Hernyca, in the Sabyne montanys; And thai alsso that bred and fosterit be In boundis of rich Anagnya cite; And eik thai pepill dwelling fair and bene In Champan?e, on the flude Amasene. Amangis al thir pepill na brycht armyng Mycht thou heir sovnd, nor scheild our schulder hyng, Or cartis clattir, bot of thame the maste part To schut or cast war perfite in the art, With leyd pellokis from engynys or staf slyng By dyntis bla thar famen doun to dyng; Sum dowbill dartis castyng in handis buyr, And for defens, to keip thar hedis suyr, A ?allow hat woir of a wolfis skyn, For thai waldbe lyght bodyn ay to ryn. Thar left fut and all that leg was bair; Ane rowch ryllyng of raw hide and of hair The tother fut coverit weil and knyt. Neptunus son list tho na langar syt, Hait Mesapus, bot bownys furth to gang; Dantar he was of stedis wild and strang, Quham na man with steil wapyn forgit brycht, Nor byrnand fyre, onto his ded mycht dycht. Now hastely in armys callys he The rowtis of hys pepill and men?e, Quhilkis lang tofor dysvsit had the weir With curage dolf that idill lay thar geir; Thar swerdis now and burnyst glavys gray He maid thame furth bedraw and oft assay. With hym thai folk in falloschip led he That inhabitis Fascenyum the cite; And the iust pepill, clepit Falyscy; And thame that duellis in Saracte fast by, A strang cite, and hie situat, Onto the god Appollo dedicat; And thai that in Flavynya feildis dwell, Or that wonnys besyde the layk or well Of Cymynyk, vndre the montane bra, Or ?it amang the schawys of Capua— In gudly ordour went thai and array, And of thar kyng sang bellettis by the way. Syk wyss as sum tyme in the skyis hie Throw the moste ayr doys snaw quhite swannys fle, Quhen thai fra pastur or fedyng dois resort To seik thar solace, and on thar gyss to sport; Weill soundyng wriblys throw thar throtis lang Swouchyng makis in maner of a sang, That of thar bruyt resoundis the ryveir, And all the laik of Asya fer and neir— So, in like wyss, on far was nane mycht ken That rowt had bene ane ost of armyt men, Bot of the swouchand swannys suld he wene A sop fleand in the ayr thai had bene, Quhilk chasyt, or affrayt, iolely Socht crowpyng to the costis syde fast by. ?it comptis the poet the chiftanys al and sum, Aganys the Troianys sal in weirfar cum. Lo, Clausus eik, that douchty was and gude, Discendit of the ancyent Sabinis blude, A mekil rowt furth ledis to the weir, As gret man worthy syk ane ost to steir; Fra quham the clan and pepill Claudyane Is cummyn our all the boundis Italiane, Eftir that Rowme was gevin and maid fre To the Sabynys, as thar proper cite. Togiddir can assembill a huge rowt That fra the cite Amatern flokkis owt; The ancyent Sabynys hait Quyrites then, And of Erety all the fensabill men, Of Mystisca, quhilk now heicht Tribule, Quhar growys of olyve treys gret plente; All thai that dwellis in cite Momentyne, Or rosy feildis besyde the laik Velyne, Or on the scharp craggy rochis hie, Quhilk for harsknes ar clepit Tetryce, With hyngand hewys and mony a skowland bra; Thidder held the cite of Casperia, Thai that inhabittis Forolas that towne, Or on the flude Hymella vp and downe; All thai that drynkis of Tibir the ryver, Or Fabarus that rynnys fresch and cleir; And thai that wynnys in Nursya so cald, And of Ortyne the navy gret and bald; The Latyne pepill alsso, and all tha Quhar the onhappy flude of Allya Flowis throw the boundis and bedyis thar land.

The ennemy to Troiane name onon, The bastard son of Kyng Agamenon, Hait Halesus, can with ferss mud acwart Adioyn hys horss forto draw his cart, And, in the aid of Turnus and supple, A thousand ferss folkis assemlyt he: Thay quhilkis with rakis ourturnys euery bra Fertyll of wynys in the mont Massica; And thame alsso dwelland in hillys he, Send from the ald faderis of Arunca cite; And thai that dwellis hard on the sey bray Besyde the cite of Sydycina, Or come fra Cales into Champany, With all tha pepillis into cumpany Inhabitant the schauld flude Wlturnus, And frawart folkis, hait Saticulus, Togiddir eik with the haill multitude Of Oscores, that pepill stern and rude.

On fut he startis, and onon can he se Furth of the orient in the brycht mornyng The sonnys hevynly bemys newly spryng, And in the holl lufis of his hand quhar he stude Dewly the water hynt he fra the flude, Syne to the hevyn thus wyss his prayeris maid: “O nymphys all of fludis blith and glaid, And O ?e haly nymphys of Lawrentum land, Quham fra this fresch ryveris, and euery strand That flowys rynnyng as we se sa cleir, Hess thar begynnyng furth of sowrssys seir; And O thou haly fader Tiberyne, With Tybris eyk, thy blissyt flude dyvyne, Ressaue Eneas to ?ow onbekend, And now at last from all perrellys defend.

Bair hym this message, and declar hym plane, That chosyn men discend from Kyng Dardane Beyn hyddir cummyn, besekyng hys frendschip, To knyt vp band in armys and falloschip.” Pallas, estonyst of sa hie a name As Dardanus, abasyt worth for schame: “Cum furth,” quod he, “quhat evir thou be, bern bald, And say befor my fader quhat thou wald, And entyr in our lugyngis the to rest, Quhar thou salbe ressauyt welcum gest.” And furth onone he hynt hym by the hand, A weil lang quhile hys rycht arm embrasand; Syne furth togiddir rakyt thai on raw, The flud thai leif, and entris in the schaw. Eneas tho, with frendly commonyng, Spak curtasly, thus sayand to the kyng: “O thow maste curtass prynce, and best in neid That evir was byget of Grekis seyd, Quhamto fortoun wald I suld cummyn heir, The lawly to besekyng and requir, And wald alsso I suld furth reke to the Wippyt with bendis the branch of olyve tre, In takyn that of thy supple I neid; Forsuyth, I caucht na maner feir ne dreid, Thocht thou a capitane of the Grekis be, Yborn alsso of Arcad the cuntre, Of blude coniunct to the Atrides tway, I meyn onto Agamenon and Menelay: Bot myne awin vertu, and haly oracleis Of the goddis be devyn miracleis, And our forbearis all of a kynred, Thy fame dyuulgat into euery sted, Hess me fermly adionyt onto the; The fatis eik tharto inducis me, That wilfully I obey thar command. Schir Dardanus, the kyng first in our land That belt the cite Troy or Ilion, Our cheif fader, as Grekis grantis ilkone, Born of Electra, Atlas douchter ?yng, Careit be schip come first to Troys ryng; And this Electra gret Atlas begat, That on hys schuldyr baris the hevynnys plat. Mercur is fader of ?our clan alssua, Quham the schene madyn, the fair fresch Maya, Apon the frosty hillys top all bair, Quhilk Cillenus is hait, in Arcad bair; And this ilk Maya suythly, gif that we Ony credens to it we heir or se May geif, Atlas bygat, that sam Atlas That rollys the hevynly starrit speir cumpas; So baith our kynrentis, schortlie to conclud, Devidit ar furth of a stok and blude. Quharfor, havand confidens in thir thyngis, Nothir by ambassat, message nor writingis, Nor other craft, thy frendschip first socht I; Bot myne awin self in person com in hy, That onto the submittit has my hed, And the to pray socht lawly to this sted. For the ilk pepill vnder Dawnus kyng, That the Rutilianys has in governyng, Quhilk ledis weir aganys thi cuntre, With cruell batal now persewis me; And gif thai mycht expell ws of this land, Thai weyn tharby that nocht may thame ganestand, Bot at thai sall vnder thar sen?eory Subdew alhaill in thraldom Italy, And occupy thai boundis oriental Quhar as the ovir see flowys alhaill, And eik thai westir partis, trastis me, Quhilkis ar bedyit with the neddir see. Ressaue and knyt vp faith and ferm cunnand, Tak our promyt and geif ws treuth and band; Strang bodeis til abyde bargane haue we, With hardy myndis in batal or melle, Exercit in weir, and expert at sik nedis, In lusty ?outh likly to do our dedis.” Thus said Eneas, and Evander than, Fra tyme that he first forto speke began, Hys eyn, hys mowth, and all hys body rycht Gan to behald, espying with hys syght, Syne schortly maid hys ansuer thus agane: “O quhou glaidly the, mast forcy Troiane, I do ressaue as tendir frend and feir! Quhou blythly now I knaw and weil may heir The voce, the wordis and the speche, but less, Of thy fader, the gretast Anchises! And full perfytly now I draw to mynd The vissage of that worthy knycht maste kynd. For weill I do ramembir, lang tyme gone, Quhou Priamus, son of Laomedon, To vissy hys sisteris land Hesiona, Socht to the cite hait Salamyna, And at the sammyn rayss hys vayage maid Throu the cald frosty boundis of Arcaid. My grene ?outh that tyme with pilis ?yng First cled my chyn, or berd begouth to spryng; I ioyt to se the Troian dukis ilkone, And on the son of Kyng Laomedone, That is to say, this ilk ?ong Priamus, Forto behald was mervel gloryus; Bot thy fader Anchises, quhar he went, Was hyar far than all the remanent. My mynd brynt, of ?outhed throu desire, To speke and common with that lordly syre, Tobe acquentit, and ioyn hand intil hand, Cunnand to knyt, and bynd fordwert or band. To hym I went desyrus of frendschip, And sped that sammyn so in falloschip, Within the wallys of Pheness I hym led, And quhen he dyd depart, or thens hym sped, Ane courtly quavir full curyusly wrocht, With arowis, maid in Lycia, wantand nocht, Ane garmond he me gaue, or knychtly weid, Prynnyt and wovyn full of fyne gold threid, Twa goldyn bridillis eik, as he dyd pass, Quhilk now my son occupyis, ?ong Pallas. Quharfor our allyance, faith and richt hand, As ?e desire, ar ellys adionyt in band— We bene of ald confideratis, perfay: Quharfor to morn, alssone as the brycht day Begynnys allycht the landis and the sky, With succurss and suppovell blythly I Sal ?ou fra hyne hame to ?our army send, And with my gudis and my mobillis amend. And in the meyn tyme, sen, my frendis deir, Onto our sacrefyis ?e be cummyn heir, Quhilk ?eirly vsyng we as anniuersary, That bene onlefull to defer or tary: Tharfor with ws do hallow our hie fest, And with glaid semlant blythly maste and lest Accustom ?ou from thens, and now instant Our tabillis as ?our frendly burdis hant.” Quhen this was said, mesis and cowpis ilkane, Quhilk war away tak, bad he bring agane, And he hym self the Troiane men fut het On sonkis of gresy scheraldis hes doun set. Thar pryncipal capitane syne, Ene, Beside hym self on dess ressauys he; The benk, ybeldyt of the grene holyne, With lokkyrrit lyoun skyn ourspred was syne. Than ?ong men walit bissy heir and thar, And eik prestis of Hercules altar, The rostit bullys flesch set by and by, The bakyn breid of baskettis temys in hy, And wynys byrlys into gret plente. Eneas, sammyn with hys Troiane men?e, Dyd of perpetual oxin fillettis eyt, And purgit entralis, clepit clengyng meit. Evander tellith till Eneas, but baid, The verray causs quhy this sacerfice was maid. Eftir that stanchit was the hungris rage, And appetit of meit begouth asswage, Said Kyng Evander: “Na superstitioun vayn, Nor mysknawlage of goddis ancyane, Thys hie fest and gret solempnyte, Nor this bankat and mesys, as ?e se, Hes institut to ws, and this alter Of sa excelland maieste standyng heir; Bot, my deir frend and nobill gest Troiane, We, preservit from cruel peralus pane, Hantis this seruys apon sik maner, As proper det and observans ilk ?er. First, do behald ?one schorand hewchis brow, Quhar all ?on craggy rochis hyngis now, Quhou the huge weghty brays bene dovn cast, The holkit fows in the mont syde left waste, Quhar as the craggy quhynnys, dovn declyne, Has drawyn of the hill a huge rewyne. ?on was a cavern or cove in ald days, With gousty entray far furth of all ways, A grisly den and ane forworthyn gap Of Cacus, that na mar had bot the schap Of mannys form, for skant half man was he Throw cruel dedis of iniquyte, That in ?one fendlich hole dwelt hym allane— A hellis byke, quhar sonnys beme nevir schane, Quhar the vile flur evir lew warm was spred With recent slauchter of blud newly sched. Befor that tyrrandis ?et of men that ded is Affixit stud mony dolorus hedis, With vissage blaknyt, blude byrun, and bla, The laithly ordur or filth stilland thar fra. Onto this hutyt monstre, this Cacus, The god of fyre was fader, Wlcanus; And at hys mouth, a wondir thing to se, Hys faderis reky flambe furth ?iskyt he. As to hys body, quhar so evir he passit, Of bustuus statur lyke nane other was it. Proces of tyme at last hess ws inspirit, And send ws help, as we full lang desyrit, Be cummyng of the mychtful goddis presens; For the danter of monstreis, our defens, The maste redoutit Hercules, com at hand Be aventour onto this ilke land, New from the slauchter into stern melle Of Geryon, the quhilk had bodeis thre. With prowd spul?e arryving triumphal, This conquerour maid thyddir dryve and call Hys bullys and hys oxin huge gret, And eik hys ky, to pastur and to eyt Endland ?one valle that is large and wyde, And tuk thar lugyng on this ryver syde. Bot the ondantit fury mynd of this theif, Schrewit Cacus, all way ful of myscheif, By his frawart engyne and sle consait So that no maner wikkytnes nor dissait Mycht be, that he ne durst nocht tak on hand, Ne onassayt leif, out from thar stand Four semly oxin of body gret and squar, Als mony tendir quyis excedand fair, Of all tha catal away with hym drave. And, that thar tred suld na way be persaue, Onto hys cave ay bakwartis by the talys To turn thar futsteppis he thame harlys and tralys; And thus his spreith he had ontil his in, And with a queym stane closyt hes the gyn. Sik way he wrocht that, quha thar tred list goif, Na takynnys suld convoy thame to his coif. In the meyn quhile, as all the bestis war Repatyrit weil efter thar nychtis layr, At morow ayrly first as thai removit, For Hercules depart from thens behuffit, The catal gan to rowtyng, cry and rar; The woddis rang of thar sound our alquhar, And with thar noys dynnyt hillis and knowys, Quhil in the caif as that a quyok lowis, With lowd voce squeland in that gousty hald, All Cacus trast reuelit scho and tald. Bot tho in greif this worthy Hercules, Alceus nevo, the douchty Alcides, That so oft syss was clepit commonly, Within hys skyn begouth to byrn and fry In brym fury of his bitter gall; Hys wapynnys and his armour hynt withall, Hys weghty burdon, or his knorry mayss, And to the hillys hycht held in a rayss. Than was the first tyme that ony in this erd Of our pepill persavyt Cacus efferd, Within his hed trublit his eyn tway. Swyft as the wynd he fled and gat away, And to his cave hym sped with ery spreit— The dreid adionyt weyngis to his feyt. And fra he had hym self sesyt tharin, A stane of huge weght for to closs the gyn He leyt do fall, and with sic haist doun thrang, The chen?eis brak quharwith it festnyt hang, That forgit war by hys fadris engyne; With gret irne slottis schet the entre syne. Bot lo, in haist Hercules come at hand With furyus mynd careyng our the land, Passage and entre sekyng bissely, Now heir his eyn, now thar, rollyng in hy, Graslyng hys teith and byrnand full of ire. Of Aventynus hill thryss all the swyre He sersys our, and thryss assays he To brek and rent that craggy stone entre, Bot all for nocht, thocht he was nevir sa wight; So, thryss irkyt, doun from the hillys hyght To rest hym is he to the valle gone. Thar stude a pynnakill of quhyn or flynt stone, Apon the baksyde of this cavern cald, That rayss on end rycht hie fortobehald, For wild fowlys of reif a ganand sted, That rent raw flesch of bestis bonys ded; The craggis all about this rolk war worn, With wedderis blast to holkyt and to torn: And as it stud on schor sweyand that tyde, Down with the bank towart the watir syde, Hercules it smytis with a mychty towk Apon the rycht half, forto mak it iowke, Inforsyng hym to welt it our the bra; And sa rudly it branglys to and fra, That from the rutis he it lowsyt and rent, And tumlyt dovn fra thyne, or he wald stent. The large ayr dyd reirding with the rusch, The brays dyndlit, and all dovn can dusch; The ryver wolx effrayt with the rak, And demmyt with the rokis, ran abak. Than this gret cove, of Cacus sail ryall, Was discoverit; hys inwart cavernys all, Wont tobe dyrk, worth patent now and knaw— Non otherwyss than quhen the erd ourthraw By fors of thundyr, or erdquake with a clap, Ryvys vp a terribill sewch or grisly gap, Oppynnand the hellis mansioun infernall, And onclosys that dyrk regioun paill Quhilk of the goddis al abufe is hayt; Or thocht the hellis bysme in sik estait War oppynnyt, that his bodum se men mycht, And dampnyt sawlys effrayt of new lycht. Quharfor this worthy stalwart Hercules, That on this wyss had Cacus set in press, And fund onwarnyst by this lycht suddane, Quhar he was closyt in a cave of stane, Fast rumesand apon a strange maner; This campyoun with dartis fell of weir Gan down tobet, and in his wod fury Eftir all kynd wapynnys can do cry, With branchis rent of treis, and querral stanys Of huge weght dovn warpand all at anys. Bot this ilk Cacus, quhen that he dyd se Fra this danger thar was na way to fle, Furth of his throt, a wondruss thing to tell, A laithly smok he ?iskis blak as hell, And all the houss involuyt with dyrk myst, That sone the syght vanyst, or ony wist, And reky nycht within a litill thraw Gan thikkyn our al the cavern and ourblaw, And with the myrknes mydlit sparkis of fyre. The hie curage of Hercules, lordly syre, Mycht this na langar suffir, bot in the gap With hasty stert amyd the fyre he lap, And thar as maist habundyt smokis dyrk, With huge sop of reyk and flambis myrk, So that the caif dyd glevyn of the heyt, Thar hass he hynt Cacus, that wikkyt spreit, That all invane hys hait kyndlyng furth gaspyt; For as a ball he hym in armys claspyt, And so stren?eis hys throt, furth chirt hys eyn, Hys hals worth dry of blud. Than mycht be seyn This mirk dungeoun and onsemly hald: The entre oppynnyt Hercules the bald, Bet doun the closeris, and syne brocht to the lycht Hys oxin fra him reft by subtel slycht; And by the feyt furth harlyt was onon Of Cacus the deformyt carion. The hartis than and myndis of our men?e Mycht nocht be satisfyit on him to luke and se, As to behald hys vgly eyn twane, Hys terribil vissage, and hys grisly gane, The rouch byrsys on the breist and creste Of that monstruoss half deil wilde beste, And in his gorge stikkand the sloknyt fyre. Evir sen that tyme, to Hercules the gret syre We haue this honour mayd and sacrifice; Al our ofspring and ?ong men on this wyss This day kepis solempnyte, as ?e se. Potitius first master heir with me, And the famyll of Pynaria the bald, The cheif keparis of Hercules hallowyt hald, ?on altar in this cuthyll dyd vpbeild, That onto ws in euery tyme of eild Is clepyt maist solempnyt and hie altar, And salbe reput gretast euermar. Tharfor haue done, ?ong gallandis; now in hy In wirschip of this fest and mangeory, Of greyn branschis plet for ?our hed garlandis, Do waucht and drynk, bryng cowpys full in handis, Call on our patron common god dyvyne is, And with gud will do skynk and birl the wynys.” Thus sayand, the party popill grayn Heldit his hed with skug Herculyane, The levis from the plettis dovn hyngand, Ane haly cowp fillit in hys rycht hand. Than ilk man smertly tastis the wyne at tabill, Prayand thar goddis fortobe aggreabill. In lovyng of the douchty Hercules The pepill syngis hys warkis mar and less. In the meyn sesson Hesperus drew neir, Throw the declynyng of the hevynly speir: Tharwith the prestis of the sacryfyis, Gyrdyt in skynnys, eftir thar auld gyss, Gan trasyng furth togidder in a rowt, And formest went Potityus the stowt, All do thai beir the byrnand hait fyre brandis, And, to renew the bankat, with thar handis Ful delicat danteis for the secund mete Thai dress onone, and furth of platis gret With paysit flesch plenyst the altaris large, Tharon bestowyng in hepis mony a charge. Syne the menstralis, syngaris and danseris, To syng and play with soundis, as afferis, Abowt the kyndlit altaris, quhil thai brynt, Assemblit ar ful swyth, and wald nocht stynt, With poppil tre hattis buklyt on thar hed. The ?onkeris ?onder in ane other sted Led rowndis, dansys and fresch caralyng; Other agit persons thame addressit to syng In ympnys, ballettis and lays, throu the press, The lovabill gestis of mychty Hercules: Quhou the first monstreis of his stepmoder sle, Lugyng a bab in creddill, stranglit he; That is to knaw, twa gret serpentis perfay, The quhilk he wyrreit with hys handis tway; And how this ilke Hercules of renovn The ryall citeis assegis and bet dovn, Of Troy, and eik the strang Echalia, A thousand hard iourneis sufferyng alssua, Vndre the kyng clepit Euristeus, By Iunoys frawart will mast envyus. And thus thai syng: “Invyncybill weriour, That bair of strenth and hardyment the flour, The stern Centawres thou slew and dovn bet, Dowbill of form, and on the clowd byget; Thow brytnys eik and with thi hand hess slane Pholus and Helyus, stalwart gyantis twane; Of Creit the monstreis dantis thou at full, The savage bestis, as wild bair and bull; Vndre a roik, Nemee forest within, Thou slew and rent the hydwyss lyoun skyn. The laik off Stix trymlyt for dreid of the; The grisly portar of the hellys see, Lugyng in caif on ded banys half gnaw, Dyd quaik for feir, quhen he thy vissage saw. Na kynd of bysnyng figour dyd the gryss, Nor byg Typheus, that agane Iove oftsyss Movyt batell, with wapynnys fell in hand Mycht the affray, nor thy gret strenth ganestand; Nor the serpent of Lern, thou put to ded, Fand the want nowder wysdom nor manhed, Thocht scho, of hedis with hir mekil rowt, The dyd assail and ombeset about. Hail, verray child of Iove; hail, honour hie Adionyt to the goddis in maieste! Baith ws and eik thi sacrifyce infeir We pray the wissy, at thou may cum heir With prosper presens and ful happy fut, In our helpyng fortobe our bute.” In sic sangis thar fest thai sanctify, And Hercules hie lovyng syng and cry. Bot principaly, and last of the laif, Thai maid mensioun of Cacus slane in caif, And quhou that he the flambis furth dyd blaw. The wod resoundis schill, and euery schaw Schowtis agane of thar clamour and dyn, The hillys rerdis, quhil dyndlis roik and quhyn. Syne, quhen dyvyne seruys was at end, To the cite bownys ilk man to wend. Furth held the kyng onweldy in ald ?eris, Fast by hym haldand, as his frendis and feris, The prynce Eneas and his ?ong son Pallas, And, quhil thai thus towart the cite pass, With syndry sermondis schortis he the way. Eneas awondris of that he dyd say, And kest his eyn about delyuerly, Thai stedis all to serchyn and espy; Sa fair placis to se and vissy tyte This strange knycht caucht plesance and delyte, And glaidly can inquiryng euery thing, And hard the answer of the agit kyng, Quhilk teching him perordour to him tald Memorialis of seir forfaderis auld. Quhou Kyng Evander rehersis til Enee In eldris days the rewle of that cuntre. Thys kyng Evandrus than, the first foundar Of Romys burgh or palyce, can declar And dyd reherss ontil his gest Enee: “Thir woddis and thir schawis all,” quod he, “Sum tyme inhabyt war and occupyit With nymphis and fawnys apon euery syde, Quhilk fairfolkis, or than elvys, clepyng we, That war engendryt in this sam cuntre, That with ane kynd of men yborn, but leys, Furth of ald stokkis and hard runtis of treis; Quhilkis nowder maneris had nor polecy, Na couth thai eir the ground, nor occupy The plewis, nor the oxin ?ok infeir, Nor ?it had craft to conquyss nor wyn geir, Nor kepe thar moblis quhen it gadderit was; Bot, as thir bestis, or the doillit ass, Thar fude of treis dyd in woddis fet, Or of the wild veneson scharp to get. First from the hie hevynnys into this land Saturnus com, fleand gret Iovis brand, Hys realmys reft, and banyst eik was he; Bot tha ontaucht pepill of this cuntre, That skatterit dwelt in hie hillis greyn, He maid forgadder togidder and conveyn, Gaue thame lawys and statutis thame to lede, And wald also this regioun euery sted War callit Latium, and clepit to hyss name, For that he surly lurkyt in the same. And as thai tel, and redis in mony ryme, Of gold the warld was in that kyngis tyme; Sa lykandly, in paix and liberte, At eyss his common pepill governyt he; Quhil, peiss and peiss, the elde syne war and war Begouth to wolx, that cullour fading far, As, in the sted of paix, the rage of wer Begouth succeid, and covatyss of geyr. Syne the pissance com of Ausonya, And the pepill Sycany hecht alsswa, By quham the land of Saturn, war and wyss, Hes left and changit his ald name oftsyss.

And me also to duel within this cost, Banyst and flemyt of my natyve land, Strang destany, quhilk may nocht be gaynstand, And fortoun eik, clepit omnipotent, Throu all extremys of sey hes hydder sent. The reuerend alss and dreidfull monysyngis Of Carmentes my moder, in mony thingis Expert as nymphe and prophetes dyvyne, And the autorite of god Appollyne, Hes me constrenyt to dwel in this hald.” Scarss hes Evandrus all thir wordis tald, Quhen, walkyng thens furth bot a litil space, He can do schaw the altar and the place Quhilk in the langage Romane ?it, sans faill, Is to this day clepit port Carmentaill, Quharby ramemmorit is in the ilk tovn This ald Carmentes wirschip and renovn, Quhilk was baith nymphe and fatale prophetes, That first declarit, in hir sawys express The gret pryncis fortocum of Ene, And of Pallanteum the nobilite. The kyng syne schew him to the haly schaw, Quhilk strang Romulus dyd reduce and draw In maner of franches or of sanctuary. He schew him eik, but ony langar tary, Vnder the frosty bra, the coif, was call Ful mony ?eris in thar leid Lupercall, Efter thar gyss of Arcaid and estait, To Pan the god of Lyce consecrait. He schew alsso the wod hait Argilete, That to the man of Arge, thar lost the swete, Was dedicat, and drew to witnes that sted That he was nevir culpabill of his ded, And can to him declar the mater plane, Quhat wyss his gest, this man of Arge, wess slane. Fra thyne, to mont Tarpeya he him kend, And beknyt to that sted, fra end to end, Quhar now standis the goldin Capitoll, Vmquhil of wild buskis rowch skroggy knoll, Thocht, the ilk tyme, ?it of that dreidfull place Ane feirfull reuerent religioun, per cace, The ery rural pepill dyd affray, So that this crag and scroggis wirschippit thai. “In ?on schaw, on this woddy hillis top That skowgit is with mony buskis crop,” Quod Evander, “tharon a god dois dwell, Bot quhat god at he be can na man tell: My pepill that bene cummyn from Arcaid Wenys thai saw ?onder, as thai me said, Gret Iove hym self, as he ful oft at large Dyd schake his tawbart, or his beknyt targe, And with his rycht hand dyd assembill and steir The watry clowdis, that makis thundris beir.” And furthir eik he said ontill Enee, “?on twa town stedis thou behaldis,” quod he, “With barmkyn down bet and euery wall, Of forfaderis thai bene memoriall: This cite beldit our ald fader Ianus, And ?onder cite fundit Saturnus: Ianiculum this hecht, myne awin leif brother, And Saturnya clepit was that other.” Amangis thame with sic carpyng and talk, Towart Evandrus pur lugyng thai stalk: The catal eik behald thai raik on raw, And in that sted thar pasturand thai saw, Quhar now in Rome is the cheif merkat platis, Baith squeil and low in thai ilk plentuus gatis Quhilk sum tyme hecht Caryne, fair and large, Quhar the howsis war like a turnyt barge. And quhen thai cummyn to the palice wer, Quod Evander, “At thir ilk ?ettis heir The conquerour entrit, douchty Hercules; This sobir manss ressauyt hym, but less. My gentil gest, enforss the and address To lern to dar contemp welth and richess, And do thi self compone, and schaw in deid In goddis steid worthy to succeid, With thame equal ressauyt in sic herbry; Amang smal geir now entris bowsumly.” And sayand this, the myghty gret Ene Within hys narrow chymmys ledis he, And maid him sytting doun apon a bed, That stuffit was with levys, and ourspred With the rouch skyn of a bustuus wild beir In Affrik bred befor mony a ?er. Ontil Eneas Venus armour requiris Fra Wlcanus, quhilkis grantis hir desiris. The nycht approchis with hir weyngis gray, Ourspred the erd and put all lycht away, Quhen Venus moder till Ene efferd, And not but causs, seand the felloun rerd, The dreidfull bost and assemly attanys Aganys hir son of pepill Laurentanys, To Wlcanus, hir husband and gud man, Within hys goldyn chalmyr scho began Thus forto spek, and with hir wordis the fyre Of dyvyne luf can towartis hym inspire. Quod sche: “Quhil that the kyngis of Grece and Arge Down bet the Troiane wallys wyde and large, That destinat war, bath towr, town and wall, Of ennemyss be flambys to down fall, Na help onto thai wrachit folkis I socht, Nane armour axit, nor thy craft besocht, Nor the, my deirest spowss, exerss bad I Thy craft, nor wark invane wald occupy, Albeit that to the childring of Pryam kyng I was bedettit into mekill thing, And the ontollerabill laubour of Ene Bewalit oft wepand ful sair,” quod sche, “Quhilk now by Iovys power stad remanys Within the boundys of Rutilyanys.

Venus hys spowss, confiding in hir bewte, Ful glaid persavys that hym caucht had sche. The fader than Vulcanus, god abuf, Lokkyt in the eternal cheyn of luf, Answerd and said: “Quharfor, myne awin hart deir, Sa far about thou glosys thy mater? Why axis thou nocht planely thy desire?

At this tyme first apperis in hir syght A new takynnyng of gret plesand lycht, And a braid schynand clowd thai dyd aspy Cum from the est, rynnand our all the sky; The rowtis eik onone thai gan behald Of Ideanys, tha wightis that in the hald Ar of the moder of the goddis closs; Dovn throu the air eik come a feirful voce, And fillit all the ostis baith atanys Of Troiane pepill and Rutulianys, Sayand: “Troianys, dreid na thing, haist ?ou nocht Fortill defend my schippis, albeit ?e mocht, For that causs tak na wapynnys in ?our handis, For rather, now as that the mater standis, Sal it be lefull Turnus fyre the see, Or that he byrn my bargis maid of tre. O ?e my schippys, now to ?ou I say, Go fre at large quhar ?ou list away, Go furth and swym as goddessis of the see; The moder of goddis commandis so tobe.” And, wyth that word, als tyte furth from the bra Ilk barge bownys, cuttand hir cabyll in twa, Lyke delphyn fysch onon as thai tuke kepe, Thar snowtis dowkand held vnder the deip.

Mnestheus stern and eik Serestus stowt Ful bissy war to walk and go abowt, Tyll ordinance forto put every thing, For thame Eneas at his departyng Had deput rewlaris to hys ?ong son deir, And master capitanys of hys ost in weir, Gyf so betyd ony aduersyte Or aventour befor hys returne. Ane haill legioun about the wallis large Stude wachyng, bodyn with bow, speir and targe; The danger was by cuttys sone decyde, At euery corner quha, or quha, suld byde, And euery man his curss abowt dyd sleip, Quhill that his fallow had his ward to keip. Nisus, Hirtacus son, that tyme was set, As for hys stand, to byde and kepe the ?et, As he that was in armys bald and stowt, Ane the maist val?eant intill all that rowt, Quham Ida hys moder, ane huntryce, In falloschip send with Ene ful wyss; To cast dartis nane sa expert as he, Nor forto schoyt swyft arrowys half sa sle. Euryalus, hys fallow, stude hym by, Of all Eneas ost nane mair gudly, Nor ?it mar semly cled in Troiane armys, Stowt, of hie curage, dredand for na harmys; Hys florist ?outh ravest hys vissage ?yng, ?it nevir schavyn, with pilis newly spryng. To thir twa was a will in vnyte, A lust, and mynd in vniformyte; Sammyn thai ?eid to mete, to rest or play, And baith togidder in batale ruschit thai; Now sammyn eik thai war in statioun set, As baith in feir to kepe the common ?et. Nisus thus spekis: “O brothir myne Ewrylly, Quhiddir gif the goddis, or sum spretis sylly, Movys in our myndis this ardent thochtfull fyre, Or gif that euery manis schrewit desyre Be as his god and genyus in that place, I wait nevir how it standis; bot this lang space My mynd movys to me, heir as I stand, Batale or sum gret thyng to tak on hand.

Thar fyris now begynnys schyne full schire, Sowpyt in wyne and sleip baith man and syre At quyet lugyng ?ondyr at thar will; Queym silens haldis the large feildis still.

Suld I the send allane in sik danger? My fader, Opheltes, the quhilk all hys days The weris hantit, nevir apon that ways Instrukkit me, nor tawcht sik cowardy.

Heir is, heir is, within this corps of myne, A forcy spreit that doith this life dispyss, Quhilk reputtis fair to wissyll, apon sik wyss, With this honour thou thus pretendis to wyn, This mortale stait and life that we bene in.” Nisus ansueris: “Forsuyth, my broder dyng, Of the, God wait, ?it dred I nevir sic thing, For so to think in faith onlefull wer. So hail and feir mot salf me Iupiter, And bryng me sowund agane with victory, As euer ?it sic consait of the had I.

Eurialus, to fulfill hys entent, With Nysus furth can hald hys way onon, And to the prynce Ascanyus ar gone. Quhou at the consal the fornamyt two Ontill Eneas purchest leif to go. Apon the erth the othir bestis all, Thar bissy thochtis sessyng, gret and small, Ful sownd on sleip dyd cawcht thar rest be kynd, All irksum laubour for?et owt of mynd; Bot the cheif ledaris of the Troiane rowt, And flowr of fensabill ?yng men stern and stowt, In the meyn tyme sat at wyss consell For common weill and materis hie befell, Consideryng wisly quhat ado thar was, Or quha suld message beir to Eneas; Amyddis thar tentis, in feild quhar thai stand, With scheildis schrowd, apon thar speris lenand.

Ascanyus first, seand thar hasty way, Admittit thar desire, and bad thame say. Than this Nisus, Hirtacus son, thus said: “Gentill Troianys, with equal myndis glaid Ressaue my wordis, for this thing,” quod he, “Quhilk I ?ow tell may nocht considerit be With sik as ws, nor men sa ?ong of ?heris, Bot to ?our wisdomys till avyss efferis.

But the, na glorius act in my materis Salbe exercyt, nother in paix nor weris: In euery thing, baith into word and deid, The maist trast salbe geif the for thy meid.” Ewrialus maid this answer for hys syde: “That day sal neuer cum, nor tyme betyde, For my defalt onworthy sall I be Fortyll attene sa souerane dignyte. Lat fortoun send ws gude luk, gif scho lest, Or mysaventour, I sal do my best— Lo, this is all, na mair I may promyt.

Bot principaly lusty Ascanyvs, The ymage of hys faderly piete Prent in hys mynde, hym strenys swa that he Wepand answerd, and said: “My brother deir, I promyss all thou desiris, out of weir, For thy commancement and stowt begynnyng Is sa douchty I may the nyte na thyng.

Syne Mnestheus a bustuus lyon skyn, That rowch and weirlyke tawbart na thing thyn, To Nysus gave; and the traste Alethys With hym hes helmys cosyt, and gaue hym hys.

Of smytis he, quhill all the bed wolx weyt; Lyke a ded stok the corps wantand the hed Lay bullerand, al besprent with sprayngis red, And als the erth grew warm with teppet blude. Attour he stekit hes eik, quhar he stude, Twa forcy men, Lamus and Lamyrus, And als the lykly ?ong child, Serranus, That all the fornycht in ryot and in play Had spendyt as he lyst, and now he lay With membris strekit, and plesand vissage brycht, Ourset with god Bachus mekill of myght: Ful happy and weill fortunat had he be, In sport and gam on the sam wyss gif he All the remanent of that nycht had spent, Quhil the lycht day, and tyl hym self tane tent. Lyke as the empty lyoun, lang onfed, Be nychtis tyde quhen all folk sleip in bed, Trubland the fald full of silly scheip, The wod rage of hys hungir is so deip That he constrenyt is sik wyss to fair; He ryvis and he harlys heir and thar The tendir bestis, that for awfull feir Of hys presens dar nowder bleyt nor steir; He rummysis with bludy mowth and brays— So dyd Ewrilly, and none other ways, And na less slauchter maid he in the plane, Of ire inflambyt in his wod brane. A multitude of commonys of birth law, By quhilk resson thar namys ar onknaw, He ombeset and put to confusioun, And Fadus syne with Hesebus dang he down, And Arabys also onwarnystly, And Rhetus eik, lay walkand hard thame by Behaldand all thar sterage and deray, Bot, of the stowt Ewrialus for affray, Behynd a wyne bote or a pype hym hyd, Quham Eurialus, as the cace betyd, Keppyt on hys swerdis poynt, that all the blaid Hyd in hys cost vp to the hyltis glaid— To ded he duschis down bath styf and cald, And vp the purpour spreit of lyf he ?ald, And blude and wyne mixt he can furth schaw, At he last drank owt ?eskis in the ded thraw. And, by sik slyght full brym, thus he enforcis To mak huge slauchtir of onweldy corpcis, Etlyng wightly to the nixt stude fast by. Thar as Mesapus feris all dyd ly, And the last fyris almaste quynchit owt, The horss, per ordour, tyit weill abowt, Etand thar meit he mycht behald and se; Quham schortly Nysus bad sess and lat be, For he persauyt Eurialus by his feris Had our gret lust to slauchter, and dangeris Persauyt nocht quhilkis war apperand eft. “Desist,” quod he, “this mater mon be left, For the day lycht, quhilk is to ws onfrend, Approchis neir, we may na langar lend. Gret harm is done, eneuch of blude is sched, Throw owt our fays a patent way is red.” And sayng thus, thai sped thame on thar way: Behynd thame, for vptakyng quhar it lay, Mony brycht armour richly dyght thai left, Cowpys and goblettis, forgyt far, and beft Of massy syluyr, lyand heir and thar, Prowd tapysry, and mekill precyus war; Salf that Eurialus with hym tursyt away The rial trappouris, and myghty patrellys gay, Quhilkis war Rhamnetes stedis harnessyng, And, for the mair remembrance in takynnyng, Ane rych tysche or belt hynt he syne, The pendentis wrocht of burnyst gold maste fyne (Quhilk gyrdill ane Cedicus, that was than Duryng his tyme ane the myghtyast man, Bereft a strang Rutiliane, as thai tell, Quham he venquyst in singular batell, And send it syne to ane Remulus hes he, That duke was of the Tiburtyne cite, In syng of frendschip and ferm acquentans: Thus athir absent ionyt allyans; Syne this ilk prynce, into hys legacy, That tyme apon hys ded bed dyd he ly, This gyrdill left to ?ongar Remulus, Hys tendyr nevo, that is heir slane thus); Euryll, as said is, hess this iowell hynt, Abowt hys sydis it brasyng, or he stynt— Bot all for nocht, supposs the gold dyd gleit.

Quhou capitane Volscens, cumand Turnus till, Recontrit Nysus and hys fallow Ewrill. In the meyn quhile, as this other army Thus at the sege gan in the feildis ly, From Lawrentum, Kyng Latinus cite, War horsmen sent to Turnus, forto se Quhat he plesyt, and the kyngis entent Tyll hym to schaw; thre hundreth men furth went With scheild on schuldir vndre capitane Volscens, And be this cummyn war to the distens Neir to thar ost, and, as the cace dyd fall, Thai held fast vnder this new cite wall. Quhar as on far towart the left hand thai Turnand thar curss bakwart persauyt tway (For the brycht helm in twynkland starny nycht Mythis Eurilly with bemys schynand lycht, Quhilk he, onwar, persauyt nocht, allace!), And as thai scars war thus aspyit on cace, Volscens the capitane, from amyd his rowt, Said, “Stand, fallowis,” and cryis with a schowt, “Quhat is the causs of ?our cummyng,” said he, “That rydis thus enarmyt? Quhat ?e be, And quhidder ar ?e bown, ?e schaw ws plane.” The tother twa maid nane ansuer agane, Bot in the woddis hyis at the flicht, Assurit gretly in dirknes of the nycht.

The wod was large, and rowch of buskis ronk, And of the blak ayk schaddowis dym and donk, Of breris ful, and thyk thorn ronnys stent— Scarsly a strait rod or dern narow went Tharin mycht fundyn be that men mycht pass, Quharthrou Eurialus gretly cummyrrit was; Quhat for myrknes, thik buskis, branch and breir, And weght also of the new spul?eit geir, Tharto the hasty onset and affray Maid hym gang will in the onknawin way. Nysus wes went, and by this chapyt cleir Hys ennemys, onwar quhar was hys feir: And as he stude at that sted, efter syne From Alba cite clepit was Albyne, Quhar, for the tyme, this forsaid Latyn kyng Hys horss at pastour held in stabillyng, He blent abowt to se hys frend so deir, Bot all for nocht, thar was na man hym neir. “Ewrill,” quod he, “allace onhappely In quhat part of this land the left haue I?

Suld he or not aventour hym self heir, And rusch amyd hys ennemys in that sted, To procur in haist by wondis ane honest ded? Vprasys he onon hys arm bakwart To thraw a gevillyng or a castyng dart, And, lukand vpwart towart the cleir moyn, With afald voce thus wyss he maid hys boyn: “O Latonya, goddes of mekill myght, Mastres of woddis, bewte of sternys brycht, Be thou present, and send me thy supple, Address my wark, be directrix,” said he: “Gif euer that Hirtacus, my fader deir, Offrit for me sum gift at thy alter; Or gif that I of my huntyng and pray Ekyt thy honour ony maner way, Or, at thy standart knoppit post of tre, Thy haly tempillys rufe, or bawkis hie, Gif evir I hung or fixit ony thyng, Wild bestis hed, wapynnys or armyng; Thoil me to trubbill this gret rowt of men, Do dress my dartis in this wilsum den, So that my schote and myssour may go rycht Throu the dyrk ayr and silens of the nycht.” Thus sayand, with al forss of hys body The grundyn dart he leyt do glyde in hy. The fleand schaft the nycht schaddoys devydis, And rycht forgane him on the tother sydis It smate Sulmonys scheild, hang on his bak, Quharin the querral al in schuldir brak; Bot with the dynt the rynde is revyn swa, Hys hart pipis the scharp hed persyt in twa. Down duschis he in ded thraw all forlost, The warm blude furth bokkand of his cost, And for the cald of deth hys lungis lap, With sobbys deip blawys with mony clap. Hys ferys lukis about on euery syde, To se quharfra the grundyn dart dyd glyde. Bot lo, as thai thus wondrit in effray, Thys ilk Nysus, worthin provd and gay, And baldar of this chance swa with hym gone, Ane other takill assayt he onon, And with a sownd smate Tagus, but remede, Throu athir part or tymplis of his hed; In the harn pan the schaft he hes affixt, Quhil blude and brane al togidder mixt. The felloun capitane, Volscens, neir wod wendis, Seand na man quhamof to get amendis; He mycht do stanche his ire, and syth his thocht, For quha that threw the dartis saw he nocht. “Thou, not the less,” quod he, “that standis by, With thy hait blude for baith twa sal aby The pane for this myscheif.” And with that word, He ran apon Euryll with drawyn sword. Than Nisus, dredand for his fallow kynd, Begouth to cry, all wod and owt of mynd, Nor na langar in dern hym hyde he mycht, Nor of his frend behald sa reuthfull syght: “Me, me, ?e sla; lo, I am heir,” he said, “That dyd the dede; turn hidder in me ?our blaid And swerdis all, O ?e Rutilyanys! All be my slycht now ?our feris slane is; That silly innocent creatour so ?yng Myght, nor ?it durst, on hand tak sic a thing— Be hevynnys he, and all the starnys, I swer, That ws behaldis with thar bemys cleir.” Sik wordis said he, for on sic maner, And sa strangly, his frend and fallow deir, That sa myschancy was, belovit he, That rather for hys life him self list de. Bot thar was na remedy nor abaid: The swerd, wightly stokit, or than was glaid Throu owt hys cost—allace, the harmys smart! That mylk quhite breist is persyt to the hart. Down ded ruschit Eurialus ryght thar. The blude bruschand outour his body fair, And on hys elbok lenand a litill on wry, Hys hed and hals bowys hevely— Lyke as the purpour flour in fur or sewch, Hys stalk in two smyt newly with the pleuch, Dwynys away, as it doith faid or de; Or as the chesbo hedis oft we se Bow down thar knoppis, sowpit on thar grane, Quhen thai be chargyt with the hevy rane.

Bot netheless thame stowtly he assalit, Not amovit, as na thing him had alit, And euer his schynand swerd about him swang, Quhil at the last in Volscens mouth he thrang, As he, forgane him standand, cryit and gapit. Allace, quhat reuth was it he not eschapit! For he deand bereft his fa the life; Stekit and hurt sa oft with speir and knyfe, Fell down abuf his frendis ded body, Quhar best him likit ded to rest and ly. O happy baith, O fortunat and dyng! Gif myne endyt or stile may ony thing, Nevir day nor process of tyme sal betyde, That ?our renown sal owt of memor slyde, Quhil the famyl and ofspring of Enee The stane immovabill of the Capitolie Inhabitis, and sa lang as Romanys bald The monarchy of the empyre sal hald.

And na less murnyng hard thai in that sted For Rhamnetes, fund hedless, pail and ded, Togiddir with samony capitanys, And gret herys, so wrachitly as slane is, Serranus ?yng, and the gentill Numa, And nobill corpsis brytnyt mony ma.

Bot Ilioneus that tyme dyd doun dyng With a gret quhyn, or roch of cragy stone, Ane Lucetyus, and brak hys nek bone, As that he dyd approche towartis the ?et, The hait flammys of fyre tharin to set. Liger a Troiane from the wall also Doun bet a Rutiliane hait Emathio. A Phrigiane eik, Asylas, stern and stowt, All tofruschit Choryneus withowt, Quhilk was in dartis castyng wonder sle; On far to schute scharp flanys and lat fle Nane mar expert than this Emathio.

Capys, a Troiane, bet doun Pryverne, Quham Themyllas with a scharp casting dart Had newly hurt and wondyt in sum part; And he hys hand plat to the wound in hy, Hys scheild besyde hym swakkand fulychly, So that the fedderit arrow furth dyd glyde, And nalyt hys hand plat to the left syde; The schaft and hed remanyt in hys cost, Be dedly wound the lyfe thus hes he lost. Arcens, Arcentis son, stude on the wall, In brycht armour ful semly schynand all, Hys mantill of the purpour Iberyne, With nedill wark brusyt rych and fyne, Of vissage was he plesand forto se; Hys fader Arcens send him with Enee; Fostyrrit he was and vpbrocht tendirly Within hys moderis hallowyt schaw, fast by The flude Symethus into Sycill land, Quhar as the plentuus fat altar dyd stand Of the placabill goddis, Palycy hecht. Ane gret staf slung byrrand with felloun weght Hynt Me?entius, hys scheild syne by hym lays, The stryngis thryss abowt hys hed assays, And this ilk Arcens standyng hym forgane Hes smertly with a ledyn pellok slane; Hys harn pan and forhed al to claif, Quhil at the led in sondir brak and raif, That he ourtumlys speldit on the sand. Thus gret slauchtir was maid fra hand to hand. Heir ?yng Ascanyus the strang Numanus slew, Quhill wordis owtragyus to the Troianys schew. Ascanyus this ilk tyme, as is said, That wont was with his schot bot to invaid The wild bestis, quhilkis cowth do not bot fle, First heir in bargane leyt swyft arrowys fle, And by hys handis slew strang Numanus, That was to surname clepit Remulus, Had laitly Turnus ?yngast systir wed, As for hys spowss, and brocht ontill hys bed. This ilk Numanus Remulus in that sted Befor the frontis of the batell ?eyd, Furth schawand mony diuerss sawys seir, Baith ganand and onganand forto heir, Rycht prowd and hely in his breist and hart That newlyngis of the kynrik was a part To him befall. His gret estait this wyss Woustand he schew with clamour and lowd cryis: “Aschame ?e nocht, Phrigyanys that twyss taik is, Tobe inclosyt amyd a fald of stakis, And be assegit agane sa oft syss With akyn spilis and dikis on sik wyss?

On Dyndyma top go, and walk at hame, Quhar as the quhissill rendris soundis seir, With tympanys, tawbronys, ?e war wont to heir, And boss schawmys of turnyt buschboun tre That grew in Berecyntia montane hie, Onto the moder of Ida dedicat, Callys efter ?ou to danss, and nocht debait: ?eld ?ou to men, and leif al ?our armyng, Rendir ?our swerdis, and all wapynnys resyng.” Ascanyus ?yng, byrnand for proper teyn, Sa gret owtrage of wordis mycht not sustene, Herand sa hie avant of pompus pryde, And sik dispyt blawyn owt apon hys syde. Hys bow with horss sennonys bend hes he, Tharin a takill set of sovir tre, And tasand vp his armys far in twyn, Thus onto Iove lawly dyd begyn To mak hys first petitioun and prayer: “Omnipotent hie Iupiter, me heir Assist to this hardy commancement. My self onto thy templis sal present Solempnyt gyftis, maste gudly may be get, And eik befor thyne altar sall I set A ?oung bullok of cullour quhite as snaw, With goldin schakaris hys forhed arrait on raw; The best salbe full tydy, tryg and wight, With hed equale till hys moder on hycht, Can all reddy with hornys fuyn and put, And scrape or skattyr the soft sand with his fut.” The fader of hevin exceppit hys prayer, And, on that part quhar the lift was maist cler, Towart the left hand maid a thundyrryng; All sammyn soundyt the dedly bowys stryng. Quhyrrand smertly furth flaw the takill tyte, Quyte throw the hed the Remulus dyd smyte; The grundyn steill outthrowch hys tympillys glaid. “Hald on thy ways in haist,” Ascanyus said, “Thy self to loif, knak now scornfully With prowd wordis all at standis by. Sik boydword heir the twyss takyn Troianys Sendis for hansell to Rutylianys.” Thus far spekis Ascanyus, and na mair. Bot the Troianys rasyt a scry in the ayr With rerd and clamour of blithnes, man and boy, That to the starnys thar curage sprang for ioy, Ascanyus extolland abuf the skyis. And, as thai mak this ryot on sik wyss, Down from the regioun of the hevin tho The brycht curland haryt Appollo, Apon a clowd sittand quhar he wald, The ostis of Italianys can behald, And eik new Troys cite, with cheir glaid Till Iulus the victor thus he said: “Eik and continew thy new vail?eand dedis, Thou ?ong child, for that is the way the ledis Vp to the starnys and the hevynnys hie, O thou verray goddis ofspring,” quod he, “That sall engendir goddis of thy seyd. In the, be verray resson and of neid, All batalys, quhilkis by werd ar destinate Agane Assaracus howss to move debait, Salbe appasit, and to quyet brocht. This litill town of Troy, that heir is wrocht, May nocht withhald the in sik boundis lyte.” And sayand thus, from the heich hevin als tyte Discendis he, movand the hailsum ayr, And to the child Ascanyus socht rycht thar; Hys figur changit that tyme as he wald In lykness of ane Butes, hayr and ald, That pursevant tofor and squyer had be To Troiane Anchyss, fader of Enee, And trasty kepar of hys chalmyr dur; Now had Ene committ to hym the cur For tyll attend apon Ascanyus ?yng. Lyke to this ancyent Butes in al thyng Furth steppys Phebus, baith in voce and hew, With lokkis quhite and armour na thing new, Rowsty, and with a felloun sound clattring, And sic wordis spak to Iulus ?yng, That otherwyss is hayt Ascanyus, With ardent mynd of bargane desyrus: “Eneas verray douchty son and ayr, It may suffice, the nedis do na mair, Sen, thou onhurt, with thy schote in this sted The strang Numanus thou hess dung to ded. This first loving and eik hie renownee The souerane Apollo grantys the, Nor na disdene at the sal haue, suthly, Tobe hys peregall intill archery. Leif of, my child, and of sic batale cess; Na mair at this tyme; draw the owt of press.” On this wyss carpys the brycht Appollo, And in the myddis of hys sermond tho He vanyst far away, I wait neuer quhar, Furth of this mortal sycht in the schire ayr. The nobillys, and the Troiane capitanys trew, Be thir takynnys the god Appollo knew, And hard hys arrowys clatterand in hys cace. Tharfor thai haue withdraw furth of that place Ascanyus, at brycht Phebus mychty charge, And wald no langar thoill hym go at large; All thocht to feght he had desyre and ioy, Hame to hys innys dyd thai hym convoy; Syne to the bargane hess thame sped agane, In oppyn perrellys, dangeris and all pane Thar personys and thar lyvys for thar town Offerand, and for defens maid thame bown. Quhou Pandarus and Bitias, brethir twane, Kest vp the ?ettis, and thar was Bytias slane.

Alsswith as the Rutylianys dyd se The ?et oppyn, thai rusch to the entre, Quercens formast, and Equycoly, A lusty knycht in armys rycht semly, Wight Tynarus, ferss myndyt to assaill, And bald Hemon, with curage marcyall.

A messynger to Turnus come that tyde, That wondir fersly at ane othir syde The town assal?eis; and thar he til hym schew Quhat hait slauchter hys fays maid of new, And sik a port had all wyde oppyn set. Hys first purposs he left, and to that ?et, With felloun ire movit, furth sprent he tho, Towart the Troianys and prowd brethir two; And fyrst hes slane byg Antyphates, That him on cace met formest in the press, Son to the bustuus nobill Sarpedon, In purchess get a Thebane wench apon. Hym smate he down with the cast of a dart; The fleand schaft Italian to his hart Glydand, throw owt the schire ayr duschit sone, The stomok persyt, and in the cost is done. The how cavern of his wond a flude Furth bruschit of the blaknyt dedly blude; So deip the grundyn steill hed owt of sycht is, Ful hait and warm it festnyt in his lychtis. Syne Meropes and Erymanthus he And Aphydnus slew with his hand al thre; And efter that, with a stern mynd full teyn, Slew Bytias, for al his glowrand eyn, Bot that was nother with dart, swerd nor knyf (For na sik wapyn mycht him haue reft the lyfe), Bot with ane hydduus byssand fyry speir, That clepit is “phalarica” in weir, Quhilk with sa vehement fors this Turnus threw That as the thundris dynt at him it flew, Quham nowder scheld of twa bull hydis thik, Nor ?it the dowbill malyt traste hawbrik, All gilt with gold, mycht it resist nor stynt. The bustuus body down duschit of the dynt, Quhil all the erd to granyt with a rattill; The hydduus scheild abufe him maid a brattill— Lyke as the hie pillar of marbill stone Standand apon the cost Euboycon, Vmquhile besyde Bais, the rych cite, With grysly swecht down duschit in the see; Quhilk was of ald of massy stanys a byng, And by the fludis sik wyss doun was dyng, Hys fall drew down the cite quhar it stude, And ruschit in a fer way in the flude; The seys mixt ourran, and all ourhed Blak slyke and sand vp poplit in the sted; Quhill of the feirfull sovnd the ilandis twa Trymlyt, Inaryme and eik Prochita; Quhil Inaryme, at Iupiteris command, Full hard bed is to Typheus the gyand. At this tyme Mars, the god armypotent, Ekyt the Latynys fors and hardyment, With felloun ire prikland so thar myndis That as hym lyst he turnys so and wyndis; And makis the Troianys tak the flycht gud speid, On thame he kest sik feir and schamfull dreid. The Latyn pepill flokkis on euery syde Quhen thai beheld the port sa oppynnyt wyde, Seand thai had a rowm to fecht at will; The god of stryfe thar curage steris thartill. Quhou Turnus the byg Pandarus smat doun, Lyke a wod lyoun past within the town. Pandarus, seand hys brotheris corps at erd, And on quhat wyss thus fortune with thame ferd, And quhou the chance of batale ?eid al wrang, Full forcyly with hys braid schuldris strang He thristis to the levys of the ?et, And closyt queym the entre, and furth schet Without the port a gret sort of hys feris, In hard bargane amyd the mortal weris; And of hys ennemyss sum inclosyt he, Ressavand all at thrang to the entre. A fuyll he was and wytles in a thyng, Persauyt not Turnus, Rutilian kyng, So violently thryng in at the ?et; Quham he onwar within the cite schet, Lyke as ane rageand wild tygyr onstabill Amang the febill bestis onfensabill. Sone as Turnus hym hess inclusyt seyn, A glowand new lyght brystis from hys eyn, Hys armour ryngis or clattris horribilly; Hys crystis trymlyt on hys hed in hy, That in hys sanguane bludy scheild als straucht Kest schynand fyry bemys lyke fyre flaucht. All suddanly, affrayit Eneadanys Hys face onfrendly persauit and byg banys. The hydduus Pandarus than hym self furth schew, That wonder fervent in hys furour grew; Hys broderis slauchter to revenge in will, Thus austernly he spekis Turnus ontill: “Thys is not Queyn Amatais cheif cite, Suld the begeif into dowry,” said he, “Nor ?it the myddis of Ardea cite bald, Thi faderis burgh, Turnus, doith the withhald. Thou seys thy fays strenth and wallys wyde; ?eild the for thy, thou may eschape na syde.” Turnus agane, with curage blyth and glaid, Nocht abasyt, ful baldly to hym said: “My frend, begyn, gif thou hess hardyment, And mach with me allone apon this bent, And hand for hand, gif at it be thy will, Thou sal schaw Pryam heir thou hes fund Achill.” The tother tho a huge speir of haill tre, With bark and knottis altogidder, leyt fle In al his forss, bot the dynt dyd no deir; Nocht bot the ayr was wondyt with the speir, For wikkyt Iuno, the ald Saturnus get, Choppyt by the schaft, and fixt it in the ?et. “Ha!” quod Turnus, “sa sal thou not astart Thys wapyn now in faith or we depart, Nor on sik wyss eschape this bytand brand, Quhilk my gret forss thus rollys in my hand; For he that aw this swerd, and wond sal wyrk, Is not sa faynt, ne sa sone sall nocht irk.” And with that word, standand on hys typtays, Hevyng hys swerd, heich hys hand dyd rayss; Down with the dynt duschit the steil blaid keyn Amyd hys forhed, hard betwix hys eyn, Hys berdless chekis or hys chaftis rownd In sondyr schorn hess with a grysly wound: Sa felloun sownd or clap maid this gret clasche, That of hys huge weght, fell with a rasche, The erd dyndlyt, and all the cite schuke. So large feild hys gowsty body tuke, That fer onbreid ourspred was all the plane, Hys armour sparkyt with hys blude and brane. Baith to and fra, apon hys schuldris tway, Hys hed clovyn in equale halfis lay. Of dreidfull raddour trymlyng for affray, The Troianys fled rycht fast and brak away, And gif Turnus had than incontinent Ramembryt hym, and kauch in mynd to rent The lokkis vp, and oppyn the ?ettis wyde, So that hys feris without the port that tyde Mycht haue entryt, and cumyn in the cite, The last day of the batale that had be, And latter finale end to the remanys Of Phrigiane folkis and pepil Troianys. Bot sic ardent hie furour marcyall, And of slauchter desire insaciall, Draif hym to follow thame that hym gaynstandis; And first he kyllit Phalarys with his handis, And ane other, that Gyges hecht, alssua, Of quham the howchys bath he smate in twa; Syn speris rent and hynt vp all on raw And at the flearis bakkis fast dyd thraw, That wondir was to se hym quhar he went, For Iuno ekyt hys strenth and hardyment. Syne ane Hales onto the corpsis ded In cumpany he ekyt in that sted; And Phegeas doun brytnys in the feld, Spetit throw owt the body and hys scheld; Alchandrus syne, and the prowd Halyus, Nemonas eik, and keyn Prytanyus, Quhilkis mysknew Turnus was within the wall, And to the bargan dyd that feris call, Apon the grund onon al ded he layd, In bargan full expert; syne dyd invaid With schynand swerd, hard at the dykis syde, Ane Lynceus, the quhilk the sammyn tyde Resistys, as he myght, with fell afferis, And efter help cryis apon hys feris; Bot with a strake he smate hys nek in twa, Baith helm and hed flaw far the body fra. And, efter thir, ane Amycus he slew, That bayn had beyn to wild bestis enew; Was nane other mair happy nor expert To graith and til invnct a castyng dart, And with vennom to garnys the steil hedis. By Turnus handis the ilk tyme done to ded is Eolus son, hait Clytius, the heynd, And Creteus also, was the Musys frend— Creteus, poet to Musys famyliar, That in hys mynd and breist all tymys bar Sangis and gestis, musyk and harpyng; Apon hys stryngis playd he mony a spryng, Lays and rymys on the best awyss, And euermar hys maner and his gyss Was forto syng, blason and discryve, Men and stedis, knychthed, wer and stryve. The Troianys set on Turnus dyntis rude, Quhill at he fled, and lap into the flude. At last Mnestheus and strang Serestus, The Troiane capitanys, herand quhow that thus Thar pepill slane war doun, dyd convene; Thar feris fleand pail and wan haue thai sene, And thar cheif ennemy closyt in thar wallys. Mnestheus on thame clepys thus and callys: “Quhar ettill ?he to fra hyne? Quhidder wald ?he fle? Quhar other wallys seik ?he, or cite? Quhat haue ?e other strenth or forteress? O citesanys, behaldis heir express Nane bot a man standand ?ou aganys, Closyt within ?our dykis and wallys of stanys, Onrevengit, sa gret occisioun And huge slauchter sal mak within ?our tovn, Or sa feill val?eand ?yng capitanys kend, Onresistit, thus down to hell sall send! O maste onworthy cowartis, ful of slewth, Of ?our onsilly cuntre haue ?he na rewth, Nor piete of ?our ancyent goddis kynd? Think ?he na lak and schame into ?our mynd, To do sa gret owtrage to strang Enee, In hys absens thus catyfly to fle?” The Troianys by sik wordis as he said In curage grew, and fermly all abaid, Abowt thar fa man flokkand in a rowt. Turnus a litil, thocht he was stern and stowt, Begouth frawart the bargane to withdraw, And sattil towartis the ryveris syde a law, Ay peyss and peyss, to that part of the tovn, Was closyt with the ryver, rynnand dovn. Troianys, that seand, the mar apertly Assal?eit hym with mony schowt and cry, And thikkyt fast abowt hym inveroin. As quhen abowt the awfull wild lyoun, With thar invasibill wapynnys scharp and squar, Ane multitude of men bilappyt war, And he full fers, with thrawin wlt, in the start, Seand the scharp poyntis, recullys bakwart, Bot forto gif the bak and fle away Nowder hys greif nor curage suffir may; And, thocht he wald, for all hys mekill mycht, Agane samony men and wapynnys brycht To press fordwart may he cum na speid. Nane other wyss Turnus, at sik a neid, Steppys abak with huly payss full still, Hys mynd scaldand in greif and egir will; And forthir eik amyd hys fays he Twyss ruschit in, and schuddrit the melle; And twyss also that onrebutit knycht Endlang the wallys put thame to the flycht. Bot al togidder, intyll ane convyne, Apon hym haill the town assemlyt syne, Nor Saturnus get, Iuno, in that fyght Agane thame durst him minster strenth nor mycht; For Iupiter had from the hevynnys fair Send dovn Iris, quhilk duellis in the ayr, Onto hys spouss and sister thar at hand Ful scharp chargis bryngis and command, Less than Turnus, quhou evir the chance befallis, Withdrew hym fra the fatale Troiane wallys; Quharthrow this val?eand campioun ?ong and keyn Nowder with his scheild sa mekil mycht sustene, Nor sic defens mak with his hand, as ayr. With dartis at him swakkit heir and thar On sik wyss is he quhelmyt and confundyt, That euer in ane hys boss helm rang and soundyt, Clynkand abowt hys halfheddis with a dyn; Hys sovir armour, strang and na thyng thyn, Is brokkyn and byrsyt with feill stonys cast; So thik war dyntis, and strakis smyt so fast, That of his helm down bettyn war the crestis; Sa sair the bosys of hys target prest is, Hys scheild na langar mycht sik rowtis sustene; The Troianys, with this Mnestheus, in thar teyn Dowblys thar dyntis at hym with speris cast, As it had bene the hydduus thundris blast. Our all hys body furth ?et the swait thik, Lyke to the trynland blak stremys of pyk; Ne gat he laser anys hys aynd to draw— The febillit brath ful fast can beit and blaw Amyd hys wery breist and lymmys lasch. Than at the last, al suddanly, with a plasch, Harnes and al togiddir, quhar he stude, Him self he swakkis and lap into the flude. With giltyn stremys hym keppyt the ryver, And bar hym vp abuf hys wallis cleir, Syne blithly careit to hys feris bedene; All blude and slauchter away was weschyn clene. &amp;c Explicit liber nonus Sequitur prologus in decimum Incipit prologus libri decimi He plasmatour of thyngis vniuersall, Thou renewar of kynd that creat all, Incomprehensibill thy warkis ar to consave, Quhilk grantyt hess to every wight to haue Quhat thing mast ganys onto hys governall. Quhou mervellus beyn diuisions of thy gracis, Distribut so to ilk thing in all placis! The son to schyne our all and schaw hys lyght, The day to laubour, for rest thou ordanyt nycht, For diuerss causys schupe seir sessonys and spacis, Fresch veir to burgioun herbys and sweit flowris, The hait symmyr to nuryss corn all howris And breid all kynd of fowlys, fysch and beste, Hervist to rendir hys frutis maste and leste, Wyntir to snyb the erth with frosty schowris. Not at thou nedyt ocht, all thyng thou wrocht, Bot to that fyne thou maid al thing of nocht, Of thy gudnes to be participant; Thy Godhed na rychar, nor ?it mar skant, Nowthir now nor than, set thou ws wrocht and bocht. Thy maist supreme indiuisibill substans, In ane natur thre personys, but discrepans, Regnand etern, ressauys nane accident; For quhy? thou art rycht at this tyme present It at thou was, and evir sal, but varians. Set our natur God hass to hym vnyte, Hys Godhed incommixt remanys perfyte, The Son of God havand verray naturis twane In a person, and thre personys all ane In deite, natur, maieste and delyte. The Son the self thing with the Fader is, The self substans the Haly Gaist, I wyss, Is with thame baith; thre distinct personage, Ar, war and be sall, euer of ane age, Omnipotent, a Lord, equale in blyss, Quhilk souerane substans, in gre superlatyve, Na cunnyng comprehend may nor discryve; Nowther generis, generat is, nor doith proceid, Allane begynnar of euery thing, but dreid, And in the self remanys etern on lyve. The Fader, of nane generat, creat ne boir, Hys only Son engendris evirmor; Not makis, creatis, bot engendris all way Of hys substans; and all tyme of baith twa Procedis the Haly Gaist, equal in glor. Of baith, from ane begynnyng, procedis he; So bene the warkis of the Trinite Maist excellent, and wondirfull to consave— ?it thame to traste the mair meryte we have, That be na manys rayson prevyt may thai be. The Fader knawys hym self, quhilk knawlege spredis Be generatioun etern, that evir bredis Hys Son, hys word and wysdom eternall: Betwix thir twa is luf perpetuall, Quhilk is the Haly Gaist, fra baith procedis. Not at the Faderis natur mynyst is, Of hys substans he generis his Son in blys; Ne so the Son of hys kynd is ybor, That he a part hess tharof, and na mor; Bot all he gevys hys Son, and all is hys. The ilk thing he hym gevis, that he remanys: Thys syngill substans indifferently thus ganys To thre in ane, and ilkane of tha thre The sammyn thing is in a maieste, Thocht thir personys be seuerall in thre granys: Lyke as the sawle of man is ane, we wait, Havand thre poweris distinct and separate, Vndirstandyng, rayson and memor; Intelligens consideris the thing befor, Rayson discernys, memor kepys the consait. As thai beyn in a substans knyt all thre, Thre personys ryngnys in a Deite. We may tak als ane other similytude, Grosly the sammyn purposs to conclud; Flambe, lyght and heit bene in a fyre we se. Quhar euer the low is, lycht and heit bene thar, And had the fyre bene byrnand euermar, Evyr suld the flambe engendrit haue hys lyght, And of the byrnand low the flambys brycht Perpetualy suld heit haue sprung alquhar. So generis the Fadir the Son with hym etern, From baith procedis the Haly Gaist coetern. Thus rude exemplys and figuris may we geif; Thocht, God by hys awin creaturis to preif, War mair onlikness than liknes to discern. Frend, farly nocht, na causs is to complene Albeit thy wyt gret God may nocht attene, For mycht thou comprehend be thyne engyne The maist excellent maieste dyvyne, He mycht be reput a pretty God and meyn. Considir thy raison is so febill and lyte, And hys knawlage profund and infynyte, Considir quhou he is onmensurabill: Hym, as he is, to knaw thou art not habill; It sufficis the beleif thy creid perfyte. God is, I grant, in all thing nocht includyt; Gevis all gudness and is of nocht denudyt; Of hym h?ss all thing part, and he nocht mynyst; Hail he is alquhar, not diuidit ne fynyst; Without all thing he is, and nocht excludit. O Lord, the ways beyn investigabill! Sweit Lord, thy self is sa inestimabill, I can write nocht bot wondris of thy mycht, That lawyt sa far thy maieste and hyght Tobe born man intill ane oxis stabill. Thow tuke mankynd of ane onwemmyt maid, Inclosyt within a virginis bosum glaid, Quham all the hevynnys mycht nevir comprehend; Angellis, scheiphyrdis and kyngis thy Godheid kend, Set thou in cryb betwix twa bestis was laid. Quhat infynyte excellent hie bonte Abufe thy warkis all, in wonderfull gre, Lord, quhen thou man wrocht to thyne awyn ymage, That tynt him self throu hys fulych dotage! Thou man becam, and deit to mak hym fre. Maid thou not man first president vnder the, To dant the bestis, fowlys and fysch in see, Subdewit to him the erth and all tharin, Syne paradice grantit hym and all his kyn, Gave him fre will, and power nevir to dee, Enarmyt him with raison and prudence, Only bad hym kepe thyne obediens, And to hym suld all creatouris obey? Bittir was that fruyt for his ofspryng, and fey, Maid deth onknawin be fund, and lyfe go hens. O thyne inestimabill luf and cheryte Becam a thrall to mak ws bondis fre, To quykkyn thy sclavys tholyt schamfull ded maste fell! Blissyt be thou virginal frute, that hereit hell, And pait the pryce of the forbodin tre! Thocht thou large stremys sched apon the rude, A drop had bene sufficient of thy blude A thousand warldis to haue redemyt, I grant; Bot thou the well of mercy wald nocht skant, Ws to provoik to lufe the, and be gude. Our all this syne, thyne infynyte Godhed, Thy flesch and blude in form of wyne and bred, Tobe our fuyd of grace, in plege of glor, Thou hest ws geif, in perpetuall memor Of thy passioun and dolorus paynfull ded. Quhat thankis dew or gan?eld, Lord benyng, May I, maist wrachit synfull catyve indyng, Rendir for this souerane peirles hie bonte? Sen body, saule and all I haue of the, Thou art my pryce, mak me thy praye condyng. My makar, my redemar and support, Fra quham all grace and gudnes cumis at schort, Grant me that grace my mysdedis til amend, Of this and all my warkis to mak gud end: Thus I beseik the, Lord, thus I exort. From the begynnyng and end be of my muse: All other Iove and Phebus I refuss. Lat Virgill hald hys mawmentis to him self; I wirschip nowder ydoll, stok nor elf, Thocht furth I write so as myne autour dois. Is nane bot thou, the Fader of goddis and men, Omnipotent eternal Iove I ken; Only the, helply Fader, thar is nane other: I compt not of thir paygane goddis a fudder, Quhais power may nocht help a haltand hen. The scripture clepys the God, of goddis Lord; For quha thy mandat kepys in ane accord Bene ane with the, not in substans, bot grace, And we our Fader the clepys in euery place: Mak ws thy sonnys in cherite, but discord. Thow haldis court our cristall hevynnys cleir, With angellis, sanctis and hevynly spretis seir, That, but cessyng, thy glor and lovyng syngis: Manifest to the, and patent, bene all thyngis, Thy spowss, and queyn maid, and thy moder deir. Concord for ever, myrth, rest and endles blyss, Na feir of hell, nor dreid of ded, thar is In thy sweit realm, nor na kynd of ennoy, Bot all wilfair, eyss and euerlestand ioy; Quhais hie plesance, Lord, lat ws neuer myss! Amen Explicit prologus Incipit liber decimus &amp;c. Quhou Iupiter the court of goddis dyd call, And Venus makis complaynt amangis thame all.

In the meyn sesson, the Troiane Ene Begouth hys folkis from thar schippis hie On bryggis and on plankis set on land: Mony abaid the ebbyng of the sand, Quhill the swarf fard wallys abak dyd draw, Than in the schaldis dyd thai leip on raw; And sum with ayris into coggis small Etlyt to land. But tho amang thame all The prynce Tarchon can the schor behald, Thar as hym thocht suldbe na sandis schald, Nor ?it na land bryst lyppyrryng on the wallys, Bot quhar the flude went styll, and calmyt all is But stowr or bullyr, murmour or movyng; Hys stevynnys thydder steryng gan the kyng, And on this wyss hys ferys dyd exort: “Now, O ?e walyt flour of weir, at schort, Bend vp ?our ayris styth, and rayss ?our schippys. Haist owr the flude, bair to the schoyr with skyppys, And with ?our stelyt stevynnys, ane and all, Thys ground onfrendly to ws and inimicall Do scheir and cleif in sundyr lyke a stok, Lat euery barge do prent hir self a dok: Na forss I not in sik port by this meyn To brek the schyp, sa we the land atteyn.” Fra Tarchon had thir wordis said, but mair Hys feris startis ilk man till ane ayr. The stowrand famy bargis dyd rebound, Inrowand fast towart the Latyn grond, Quhyl that thar stammys tuke the bankis dry, And thar kelys stak in the slyke fast by, Bot ony harm or danger, euery one. Bot sa tyd not onto thy schyp, Tarchon, For in the schald scho stoppys, and dyd stand Apon a dry chyngill or bed of sand, A lang tyme all to schakyng with the flude, Quhill fynaly, thar rokkand as scho stude, To brystis scho, and ryvys all in sondyr, Warpyt the men amyd the faym thar vndir; The plankis, hechis and mony brokyn ayr, That on the streym went flotand heir and thar, Maid to thar landing gret impediment, And slyddry glar so from wallys went That oft thar feyt was smyttyn vp on loft; Bot finaly, all drowkyt and forwrocht, Thai salwyt war, and warpyt to the cost. Than na delay of sleuth nor feir ne bost With held Turnus, bot with hys haill armee Aganyst Troianys by the cost of the see He dyd array all sammyn in that stound. The trumpettis blew thar bludy weirlyke sownd. And fyrst, in syng of gud luk in the weris, Ene the rowtis of the lauboreris, Or rurall husbandis, invadis and ourset, And hess the Latyn commonys haill doun bet, By slauchter fyrst of thar chiftane, Theron, Amang all otheris the biggast man of one, Quhilk set apon Eneas or he wyst; Bot he throw owt hys syde hys swerd hes thryst, Persyt the stalwart platit scheild of steill, And throw the schynand hawbrek euery deill; The giltyn mail?eis makis hym na sted, For in the cost he tholys dynt of ded. Syne smate he Lychas, and hym hess al to torn, That of hys ded moderis waym was furth schorn, And onto Phebus god was consecrait, And was sa chancy in hys ?ong estait That he the swerd eschapit by hys hap; Bot not at this tyme so the dedis clap. And not far thens this douchty Eneas Kyllyt the dowr and stalwart Cysseas, And put to deth the bustuus Gyas strang, That with hys burdoun down haill rowtis dang: Thar strenthy handis helpyt thame na thyng, Nowder Hercules wapynnys nor armyng Mycht thame defend, nor ?it thar syre, that heght Melampus, and compan?eon was in feght To Hercules in hys sair iourneis feill, Quhil he in erth was levand and in heill. And lo, as Pharon cryis and dois rowst With haltand wordis and with mekill woust, Eneas threw a dart at hym that tyde, Quhilk, as he gapyt, in hys mowth dyd glyde. And thou also, the fey Greyk, Cydon, Quhilk strangly luffyt thir ?ong childer ichone, As thou the ?yng Clytius dyd persew, Quhais ?allow berd begouth to spryng of new, And was alhaill thy new lust and desyre, Be the rycht hand of this ilk Troiane syre Thar had bene maid end of thy amouris greyn, And wrachitly had lyin ded, I weyn, War not the brethir of the clan Phorcanys Apon Eneas assemblit all atanys; In numbyr sevyn thai war, and dartis sevin Alsammyn thai kest, forcy as fyry levin, Of quham sum dyd but harm or other deir Stot from hys scheild, his hewmet or hed geir, And sum, that wald haue hyt hys corpss in hy, Venus hys haly moder choppyt by. Than to the traist Achates said Ene: “Reik me dartis and castyng speris,” quod he, “That in the Grekis bodeis fixit stude, Quhylum in Troys planys bedyit with blude, And my rycht hand sall thraw thame so ilkane On Rutulanys, that nane sal fle invane.” A bustuus schaft with that he grippyt hass, And incontrar hys aduersaris gan tayss Quhilk flaw towartis Meonyus fast by; Owt throw the scheild platit with steill in hy Duschyt the dynt, and throw the corslettis glydis, Gyrd throw the cost persyng baith the sydis. Onto hym startis Alcanor, hys brothir, To beir hym vp, quhen that he saw hym schuddir, With hys rycht arm, bot throw hys gardy sone The grundyn hed and bludy schaft ar done, Furth haldand the self randoun as it went; The ryght arm, from the schulder al to rent, Apon the mankyt sennonys hyngis by, As impotent, quyte lamyt, and dedly. Than Numytor furth of hys brotheris corps Ruggis the trunschon, and with all hys forss It swakkis at Ene, bot he na mycht Had till attane ne wond the nobill knycht; ?yt with the dynt the gret Achates thee He hurt and stren?eit hass a litill wee. With this come Clawsus, full of vassalage, Confidand in hys ?outh and florist age, The Curytanys with hym brocht in the press, And with a lang styf speir ane Dryopes Smate in the halss, vnder the chyn, sa sair That hym byreft was in the place rycht thar Baith voce and spreit of lyfe, and that na wonder, For hys nek bayn and throte war carf in sondir, That doun he duschys with a felloun rerd, Quhil that hys forret raschit on the erd, And of hys mouth, a petuus thing to se, The lopprit blude in ded thraw voydis he. Thre otheris syne this ilk Clawsus hass slane, Born into Trace of the clan Boryane; And thre com fra the cite of Idas, And other thre of cite Ismaras, By diuerss chancis put he al to ded. Alesus hym recontris in that sted, And all the barnage com from Aurunca, That auld cite; and thame followys alssua To that melle the son of Neptunus, That is to knaw, the worthy Mesapus, Quhilk into horsman craft was maist expert. Now presys this syde, and now ?onderwart, To reill abak and to expell in fyght Thar aduersaris, and mak thame tak the flycht. Thus by the cost Ausonya that tyde Hard wolx the batale apon athir syde. As thocht sum tyme amyd the large ayr The contrar wyndys stryvys heir and thar, With brethfull blastis in thar equale nychtis, Nane lyst obey tyll other, all sa wight is, Nowder thai amang thame self, nor ?it the clowdis, Ne ?it the rageand seys, quhilkis sa lowd is; So that the bargane lang standis in dowt, Quha salbe victor, and quha vnderlowt, Sa forcyly remanys the elementis Contrary otheris to thar awin ententis— Nane other wyss the Troiane hostis in feild, And Latyn rowtis ?okkit vnder scheild, Metys in the melle: ionyt sammyn than Thai fewtyr fut to fut, and man to man. Quhou Pallas confortis his ost of Archadye, Quhilkis gave the bak and tuke purposs to fle. Bot quhen that Pallas at ane owtyr syde Persavyt hys Arcad army that tyde In sic a place had takyn land attanys, Quhar as a burn had warpyt rowand stanys, And buskis with the brays down had bet, That thai war in sa hard myscheif ourset, As men nocht vsyt forto go feght on fute, And than, constrenyt, knew nane other buyt, For scharpness of that sted, bot leif thar horss; That weil persauyt he how that on forss Thai gave the bak, and schupe to tak the flycht, The Latynys followand thame in all thar mycht: Than, quhile with prayer, now with wordis sowr, Thar curage he enflambis to the stowr, Quhilk maner havyngis, suyth as is the creid, As vtir poynt remedy at sik a neid. “My ferys,” say he, “quhidder do ?e fle? I ?ou beseik, be ?our gret renowne, And be ?our forcy dedis done of ald, And by ?our pryncis fame, Evander bald, And be the ostis and mony victoryss That ?e in weir and batale wan feill syss, And be my gude beleif and hoyp, that now With haill confidens restis fixt in ?ow, As to atteyn onto my faderis glor, To ondertak sik dedis done befor; Do nevir, for schame, onto ?our self that lak, To lyppyn in speid of fute and gyf the bak.

Behaldis, quhou the sey with obstakill gret Inclusys ws, and at our bak can bet; On land is left ws heir na place to fle. Quhat, wald ?he ryn to Troy owt throw the see?” Thus said he, and furthwith, or he wald cess, Amyd hys fays ruschit in the press, Quhar as the rowtis thikast war in stowr. And first of other, to hys fatale howr, Hym metys Lagus, a Rutilyane, Quham fyrst ourrollyt with a mekill stane, Throw gyrd hys cost syne with a castyng dart, Persyng hys rybbys throuch, at the ilk part Quhar beyn the cupplyng of the ryg bone, And the ilk schaft stak in hys corss onone. Pallas it ioggillit, and furth drew in hy; Quham ane Hysbon, standand neir tharby, Wenyt to have kawcht, bot the gryp he falyt; For as onwar he stowpyt, and devalyt Wod wroth for wo of this myschewss ded Of hys deir fallow, in the ilk sted Pallas hym keppyt syk wyss on hys brand That all the blaid, vp to the hylt and hand, Amyd hys flaffand longis hyd hass he, On sik maner that na man mycht it se. Syne Pallas set apon Anchemolus And Sthenelus, that of the kyng Rhetus Prynce of Marrubyanys, ancyent pepill, beyn; The quhilk Anchemolus was that ilk, I weyn, Defowlyt hys faderis bed incestuusly, And had forlayn hys awyn stepmoder by. And ?e alsso, stowt gemel brether twa, Childir and sonnys onto hym Dawcya, Tymber, I meyn, and thy brother Laryde, Amyd the feild Rutiliane dyd abyde; ?e war sa lyke in form and symylitude Nane mycht decern betwix ?ou quhar ?e stude (Quhilk maner errour, or sik mysknawyng, To fader and mother is oft plesand thyng. Seand thar childer resembill ane lykness); Bot at this tyme hass Pallas, as I gess, Markyt ?ou swa with sic rud differens, That by hys keill ?e may be knaw fra thens. For swa stud with the, Tymber, thou art ded, Evandrus swerd hess swepyt of thy hed; And thy rycht arm of smyttyn, O Laryd, Amyd the feild lyis the besyde, And half lyfless thi fyngyrris war sterand, Within thy neif doys gryp and faik the brand. Than schame and dolour, mydlit baith ourane, Baldis the pepill Arcad eueryane To the bargane aganyst thar ennemyss, For Pallas wordis maid thar curage ryss, And eik, for thai beheld befor thar eyn Hys dowchty dedis, thai hym love and meyn. For Pallas than throw gyrd Rhethus the kyng, As he on cace glaid by on char fleyng: Na mair space was of tary ne delay That Ilus deth prolongit the ilk day; For as agane the, Ilo, with fell feir Pallas addressyt had a stalwart speir, Rhetheus start in betwix, and cawch the dynt, As he on cace was fleand ferss as flynt From thy handis, the maist forcy Teutras, And thy brother Tyres, that by the was: Ourweltis Rethus in ded thrawys atanys, And with hys helys smayt the Rutilian planys, Tumlyt from hys hie cart chargit quhar he sat, And on the grund rebundis with a sqwat. And lyke as sum tyme in the symmyris drowth, Quhen wyndis rysys of the north or sowth, In seir placis the hyrd, at hys desire, Amang the scroggy rammell settis the fyre; Wlcanus hostis of brym flambys red Spredand on breid, vpblesys euery sted; Than he that set the kyndillyng glaid and gay Behaldis quhou that the low doys mak deray, Blesand and crakand with a nyce reuery— Non other wyss, the Archadanys in hy All sammyn socht in feild with all thar mycht, And maid debait to help Pallas in fyght. Bot tho Alesus, keyn into batale, Thame to recontyr etlys, and assaill, And gan hym self weil schrowd vnder his scheild, Syn manfully ruschit amyd the feild, Quhar that he slew ane Lacon, and Pheres, And Demodocus eftir in the press As hym Strymonyus by the gorget grippyt, With hys brycht brand hys rycht hand he of quhyppyt; And Thoas syne sa smayt apon the hed With a gret stane, quhil myxt of blud all red The harnys poplit furth on the brayn pan. Thys ilk Alesus fader, as witty man, Forto eschew hys sonnys fatys strang, Hyd hym prevely the thik woddis amang; Bot, fra the auld Alesus lay to de, And ?eldis vp the breth with wawland e, The fatale systeris set to hand onon, And can this ?ong Alesus so dispon, That by Evandrus wapynnys, the ilk stownd, He destinat was to caucht the dedis wond; Towart quham Pallas bownyt hass ful sone, And in hys renk on this wyss maid hys boyn: “Now grant, thou god and fader Tyberyne, Gude chance and forton to this hed of myne The quhilk I tayss apon this castyng speir, That it may throw Alesus body scheir; And ?on harness, cote armour and spul?e brycht, Quhilk now sa weirly schynys on ?on knycht, Sall hyng apon ane ayk fast by thi bra.” The god hys askyn hard as he dyd pray, For quhil Alesus onavisytly Cled with hys scheild Imaonus, hym by, That was to hym hys frend and fallow deir, Hys breist stud nakyt, but armour or geir, Quharin he Pallas dedly schaft ressauyt. Bot Lawsus, wilfull hys syde to haue savyt, As he that was a gret part of the ost, And lyst not suffir, with sik feir na bost, Or slauchter maid be Pallas and deray, At his cumpan?eis suld caucht mair affray, Ruschit in the melle; and first in hys teyn Slew Abas, that gret bargane dyd sustene. The thikast sop or rowt of al the press, Thar as maist tary was, or he wald cess, Thys Lawsus alto sparpillyt and invadys: Down bettyn war the barnage of Archadyss, Down bettyn eik war the Hethruryanys, And ?he also, feil bodeis of Troianys, That war not put by Grekis to vtyrrans. Than all the ostis semlyt with speir and lans, The chiftanys all ionyt with hail poweris, The hyndmast wardis swarmyt al yferis; So thik in staill all marryt wolx the rowt, Oneyss mycht ony turn hys hand abowt To weild hys wapyn, or to schuyt a dart. Full douchtely Pallas on the ta part Inforcis hym to greif hys fays that tyde; Lawsus resistis on that othir syde. Thar agis was not far indifferent, And of maist semly statur, quhar he went, Thai war excellent of bewte baith tway; Bot so it stude, at fortoun, walloway, Wald nother suffir to hys realm resort. And netheless to meyt sammyn at schort, As into feild to preif thar hardyment, The governour of hevyn omnipotent Lyst na way thoill; for, belyve eftir this, To athir of thame thar dedly fatys, I wyss, To ane far grettar aduersar remanys, As heir onon doys follow vnder anys. Quhou that ferss Turnus has ?ong Pallas slane, For quham hys folkis makis gret dolour and mayn. Duryng this fervour of the bargane swa, The haly nymphe, clepit Iuturna, Hir brother Turnus dyd monyss and exhort To succur Lawsus, and hys folk support; The quhilk Turnus, as in hys spedy char The myd rowtis went sloppand heir and thar, Beheld hys ferys debatand with Pallas: “Lo, now is tyme to desist, and lat pass All sic bargane,” quod he, “cessis in hy; For I will set on Pallas anerly; Only to me, and to nane other wight, The victory pertenys of sik a knycht; Glaidly I wald hys fader stude heirby, This interpryss to dereyn and aspy.” Thus said he, and hys feris at command Voydit the feild, and all plane left the land. Than ?ong Pallas, seand Rutylianys Withdraw the feild sa swith, and rovm the planys, At the prowd byddyng of thar prynce and kyng, Amervellit full gretly of this thing, And farly can on Turnus to behald, Our all hys bustuus body, as he wald, Rollyng hys eyn, and all hys corps in hy With thrawyn luke on far begouth aspy; Syne movyng fordwart, with sic wordis on hie, To answer Turnus speche, thus carpys he: “Owthir now”, quod he, “for ay be lovyt I sall Of rych kyngly spul?e triumphall, Quhilk heir I sall rent from myne aduersar, Or than salbe renownyt evirmar Of ane excellent end moist gloryus. Do wa thy bost and mannance maid to ws, For my fader, quhom thou desyris besyde, Reputtis all elyke, quhou evir the chance betyde.” And sayand thus, amyd the plane furth startis: The blude congelyt abowt Archadyane hartis. Turnus down lepys from hys twa quhelit char, And bownys fast towartis his aduersar. Lyke as ane lyoun from the hillys hycht, Amyd the valle had scharply gottin a sycht Of sum prowd bull, with hys horn in the plane Addressand hym reddy to mak bargane, Cummys bradand on the best fast in a lyng— On siclyke wyss was Turnus tocummyng; And quhen that Pallas saw hym cum sa neir He mycht areke to hym a casting speir, Formast he bownys to the ionyng place, Gyf sa betyd that forton, of hir grace, Hys interpryss for stowt ondertakyng Wald help, or hym support in ony thing, As he that ?ong was, and of strenth all owt Na wyss compeir to Turnus stern and stowt; And to the gret goddis in hevyn abone Apon this maner prayand said he sone: “I the beseik, thou myghty Hercules, Be my faderis gestnyng, and the ilk dess Quhar thou strangear was ressauyt to herbry, Assist to me, cum in my help in hy, To perform this excellent fyrst iourne, That Turnus in the ded thraw may me se Bereif fra hym hys bludy armour red, And ?aldand vp the breth in the ilk sted, Mot with hys eyn behald me hym befor In hie tryumphe, with ourhand as victor.” Gret Hercules the ?ong man hard onon, And from the boddum of hys hart can gron, Hydand hys smart for rewth of Pallas ?yng, Seand the fatys wald haue hys endyng; And for ennoy salt terys, all invayn, Furth ?ettyng our hys chekis thyk as rayn. Tho Iupiter, hys curage to astabill, Thus to hys son spak wordys amyabill: “Tyll euery mortale wofull wight, perfay, Determyt standis the fixit lattir day; Ane schort and onrecoverabill term is set Of lyfe, quhen all most neydlyngis pay that det: Bot, to prolong thar fame by nobill dedis, Fra vertuus wark that cumys and procedis. Quhou mony sonnys and deir childryn,” said he, “Of goddis kyn, vnder Troy wallys hie War done to ded, and brytnyt blude and bone, So that amangis all otheris Sarpedon, My tendir get, my kyn and blude, lyis slane. Forsuyth also, I say the into plane, The fynale fayt awatis Turnus in feild, The dait and methis approchis of hys eild.” Of this wyss spak gret Iove to Hercules, And with that word, hys eyn towart the press On the Rutilian feild addressis he. And, the ilk stownd, ?ong Pallas lattis fle With mekill forss at Turnus a gret speir, And syne onon hys brycht brand burnyst cleir Hyntis furth of the scheith to mak debait. The schaft flaw towart Turnus, and hym smait Apon the schulder, abuf the gardis hie That rysys vmast therapon we se, And throw the bordour of the scheild swa persyt Quhill fynaly in sum deill it traversyt, And hurt a part of Turnus byg body. Than Turnus smyttyn, full of felony, A bustuus lance with grundyn hed ful kene, That lang quhile taysyt he in proper teyn, Leyt gyrd at Pallas, and thus wyss said he: “Considir ?ongkeir, gyf our lancis be Bettir of tempyr and mair penytratyve.” And, with the word, the schaft flaw furth belyve, So that the scharp poynt of the brangland speir Throw owt amyddis of the scheild can scheir, Persand sa mony platis of irne and steill, And sa feill plyis of bull hydis ilk deill, All sammyn cowchit in hys target strang, The bustuus strake throw all hys armour thrang, That styntit na thing at the fyne hawbryk, Quhil throu the cost thyrlyt the dedly pryk. Pallas, nocht schrynkand for the mortale dynt, Invane the hait schaft of hys wond hess hynt, For al togidder by the sammyn way The blude and sawle passys hyne bath tway. Apon hys wond onon he ruschis down, Abuf hym rang hys harness with a sovn, And that onfrendly erth ennymycall That in hys deth he suld not scryk nor call, As was the gyss, with bludy mowth bait he. Turnus, abufe hym standand, carpys on hie: “O ?he pepill of Arcaid, takis tent, And my wordis do reherss and present To Kyng Evandar, sayand hym playnly, That hys son Pallas to hym send haue I In sik array as that he hess deservyt; And, of my gentryss, wil he be preservit To all estait and honour funerall, With all solace pertenyng beryall Of tumbe and of entyrment, as efferis. Na lytill thyng, perfay, into thir weris Hes hym bycost the frendschip of Ene.” And sayand thus, with hys left fut hes he Pallas ded corps ourwelt, or euer he stent, And syne abowt hys sydis sone hass rent Hys goldyn gyrdill, pasand a gret deill, Quharin was gravyn craftely and weill Of Danavs douchteris the iniquyte, Quhou that the fyfty ?ong men, schame to se, War fowlly murthuryt on the first nycht, As thai war spowsyt to thar ladeis brycht; The chalmeris portyrit war bysprent with blude; Quhilk historeis Eurition, warkman gude, Had carvyt weill and wroch full craftely In weghty platis of the gold massy, Of quhais spul?e now is Turnus glaid, Ioyfull and blyth that he it conquest had. O manis mynd, so ignorant at all Of thingis tocum and chancis quhilkis may fall! Vpheit sone in blynd prosperyte, Can not be war, nor myssour hald with the! The tyme sall cum quhen Turnus sall, perfay, Hait and wary this spul?e and this day, Desyrand he mycht by for mekill thing That he had nevir twichit Pallas ?yng. Abowt the corps assemblit tho his feris, With mekill murnyng and huge plente of terys; Apon a scheild Pallas body thai laid, And bair hym of the feild, and thus thai said: “O Pallas, quhou gret dolour and wirschyp To thy fader, and all hys falloschip, Sall thou rendir and bryng hame,” said thai. “Thys was to the in weyrfar the first day, Quhilk first in bataill dressyt the to go; The ilk for ay hass the bereft tharfro! And, not the less, thy swerd leiffis in the planys Gret hepys ded of the Rutilianys.” The rich Magus na ranson mycht reskew, And preist Hemonydes, baith Eneas slew. Tho nane incertane rumour nor demyng, Bot sovyr boydword cam thar, and warnyng, Ontill Eneas of this gret myschance, Schawand quhou that his folkis stud in ballance, As bot in litill distans all from ded; The tyme requiryt forto set remeid, And succur Troianys quhilkis had tane the flycht. Than, as wod lyon, ruschit he in the fight, And all quham he arekis nerrest hand Without reskew dovn mawis with his brand; The bytand blaid abowt hym inveroum Amyd the rowtis reddis large rovm. Enragit and inflambit thus in ire Throw owt the ostis Turnus, that prowd syre, Quhilk had this new slauchtir maid, socht he, Ay prentand in his mynd befor hys e The gudly Pallas, was sa stowt and ?yng, And the gret gentryce of Evander kyng, The cheir and fest hym maid bot a stranger, Per ordour all thing, quhou and quhat maner He was ressauyt and tretit thankfully, Syne of hys band of frendschip and ally With athis sworn and interchangit handis, Remembryng tho his promyss and cunnandis. Amovit in this heit, or euer he stynt, Four ?ong men quyk he hess in handis hynt, That born was of the cite hecht Sulmon; Alsmony syne he takyn hass onon Bred and vpbrocht besyde the flude Vfens, Quham that he etlys forto send from thens To Pallas lykewalkis and obsequeis, To strow his funeral fyre of byrnand treis, As was the gyss, with blude of presoneris, Eftir the ald rytis into mortale weris. Syne hynt Eneas a perellus lance in hand, And it addressis far furth on the land To ane Magus, that subtell was and sle, And iowkit in vnder the speir hass he; The schaft schakand flaw furth abufe hys hed; And he Eneas in that sammyn sted Abowt the kneis grippyt humylly, With petuus voce syne thus begouth to cry: “By thy deir faderys gost I the beseik, And be that gud beleif quhilk thou hass eik Of Ascanyvs vprysyng to estait, Thys silly sawle of myne, sa faynt and mayt, Thow salf to my a son and fader deir.

All interchange and ransonyng, perfay, In this batale Turnus hess done away, Now laitly slayand ?ong Pallas, allace!

Not far thens stude Hemonydes allane, Prest onto Phebus and the thrynfald Dyane, On quhais hed wympillit holy garlandis With thar pendentis lyke to a mytyr standis, Hys habyt as the scheyn son lemand lycht, And all hys armour quhite and burnyst brycht; Quham Eneas assalyt myghtyly, And gan to chayss owt throw the feld in hy, That fleand stummyrryt and to grond went sone; The Troiane prynce down lowtis hym abone, And with hys brand hym brytnys at devyss, In maner of ane offerand sacryfyss. The large schaddow of Eneas in feild Dyd haill the ded corps of this preist ourheld. Serestus sortis vp hys armour gay, And on hys schuldris careit hess away, To hyng as trophe or syng victoriall Tyll Mars the god, quhilk Gradyus is call. Quhat douchty chiftanys of the Latyn land That day Eneas kyllit with hys hand. Ceculus, discendit of Wlcanus blude, And Vmbro eyk, the stalward chiftane rude, That cum was fra the montanys Marsyane, The bargane stuffis, relevand in agane. Bot Eneas, discend from Dardanus, Ganstandis thame, ful brym and furyus, And onto ane, hech Anxurus, in the feild Of strak the left arm all dovn with the scheld; Quhilk had maid sum gret vant, spekand prowdly, Wenyng that in hys sawys by and by Thar had bene gret effect and hardyment, As thocht he wald extoll in hys entent Hys manhed to the hevyn and starnys hie, And promyss to hym self, for hys bonte, Agit cannos hayr and lang process of ?eris: Lo, now he lyggis law, for all hys feris! Syne baldly with glaid curage, as I gess, Agane Eneas can Tarquytus dress, In schynand armour wonder prowd and gay, Of Dryope born, the nymphe or schene may, To Fawnus wonnyng in the woddis greyn; And, to recontyr Ene inflambyt in teyn, Kest hym selvyn; bot the tother, but feir, Buyr at hym mychtyly with a lang speir Throw owt hys scheild of payss and hawbrik fyne, That to the grund gan dovn hys hed declyne; All thocht he than full humylly hym besocht, And schupe to say mekill, all was for nocht; Hys pallat in the dust bedowyn stude, And the body baithit in the hait blude Ene ourweltis, sayand thir wordis withall, With trublit breist and mynd inimicall: “Now ly thou thar, that wenyt the so wight That thou was feirfull ontill euery wight. Thy best belovit mother sall the not haue To erd, as custum is, nor delf in grave, Na do thy bonys honour with sik cuyr As thame to lay in fadyrris sepultur; Bot salbe left to the wild bestis fuyd, Or than the spait watir of this flude Sal bair the in the deip, and thar on raw With empty throtis sal thy banys gnaw Thir sey monstreys in thar wod rage, And lape thy blude thar hungir to asswage.” Syne, but delay, Antheus and Lycas, Quhilkis that of Turnus first ward ledaris was, Persewys he, and also Numa bold, And Camerthes, brycht schynand all of gold, Son of the manly Volscens capitan; In all the fertill grond Ausonyane The richast man, and kyng was this Volscens Of Amyclys the cite of silens. And lyke as Egeon, the kyng of gyandis, Quhilk had, thai say, ane hundreth armys and handis, And fyfty mowthys, of quham the fyre dyd schyne, As he into the batale gigantyne Incontrar Iovis thundir and fyre flaucht With alsmony scharp drawyn swerdis fawght, Clatterand in bargane with samony scheildis— The sammyn wyss, enragent throw the feildis Went Eneas, as victor with ourhand, Fra tyme that anys bedyit hys burnyst brand And wet he had in hait Rutiliane blude. So that alsso, in this ilk fury wod, He draif at Nypheus amyd the breste bane, Set in hys fourquhelit chariot allane; Bot fra the horss on far dyd hym aspy Sa grym of cheir stalkand sa bustuusly, For feir thai start abak, and furth can swak The duke Nypheus wyd oppyn on hys bak, And brak away with the cart to the schor, With stendis feill and mony bray and snor. The self stound, amyd the press fut hoyt Lucagus entyris in hys chariote, With quhyte horss drawyng wonder lustely, Hys brother Lyger sittand neir hym by; This Lyger led the ren?eis with hys hand, Bot bald Lucagus swakkis a burnyst brand. Eneas mycht nocht suffir nor sustene Of thame sic fervour in thar felloun teyn, Bot ruschit furth, and with a gret speir Forganyst thame can into feght appeir; Quhamto this Liger carpys upon hie: “Thou seys nocht Dyomedis stedis heir,” said he, “Nor ?it Achillis char persavis draw, Thocht athir venquyst the in feild, we knaw; Nor ?it the Troiane planys behaldis thou. The end of thyne age and of bargane now Salbe maid in thir landis on this grond.” Sic wordis vayn and omsemly of sovnd Furth warpys wyde this Lyger fulychly, Bot the Troian barroun onabasitly Na wordis pressis to rendir hym agane, Bot at hys fa leyt fle a dart or flayn, That hyt Lucagus, quhilk, fra he felt the dynt, The schaft hyngand into hys scheild, but stynt Bad dryf hys horss and char al fordwart strecht, As he that hym addressit to the fecht, And strekit furth hys left fut in hys char; Bot sone Eneas speir was reddy thar, Beneth hys schynand scheild reversyt law, So that the grondyn hed the ilk thraw At hys left flank or leisk persyt tyte, Quhill clar owt our the charyot is he smyte, And on the grond weltis in the ded thrawys; Quham on this wyss with sowr wordis and sawys The petuus Eneas begouth to chyd: “Lucagus,” said he, “forsuyth as at this tyde Na slaw curss of thy horssys onweldy Thy cart has rendryt to thyne ennemy, Nor ?it na vayn wrathys nor gaistis quent Thi char constrenyt bakwart forto went, And malgre thyne withdraw thi fays gryppys; Bot lo now, of thy fre will, as thou skyppys Owtour the quhelys of thy cart, God wait, Levand the renys and horss all desolat.” Thys beand said, the horss renys he hynt. The tother fey brother, or evyr he stynt, Lap fra the cart, and kneland petuusly, Vphevand hys bayr handis, thus dyd cry: “O Troiane prynce, I lawly the beseik, Be thyne awyn vertuus and thy thewys meyk, And be thy parentis maist of renowne, That sik a child engendryt hess as the, Thow spair this wofull sylly sawle at lest, Haue rewth of me, and admyt my request.” With wordis feill as he thus can requer, Ene at last on this wyss maid answer: “Syk sawys war langer furth of thy mynd. Sterve the behuffis, less than thou war onkynd As for toleif thy broder desolait All hym allane, na follow the sam gait.” And tharwithall the hyrnys of hys gost He rypyt with the swerd amyd hys cost, So tyll hys hart stoundis the pryk of deth; He weltis our, and ?aldis vp the breth. Thys Dardane prynce as victor thus in weir Samony douchty corpsis brocht on beir, Amyd the planys reddand large gait, As doys a rowtand ryver red on spait; That for hys dyntis wolx hys fays agast, As for the feirfull drumly thundris blast; Quhil fynaly Ascanyus the ?yng page, And the remanent of Troian barnage, Quhilk war, as said is, besegyt invane, Thar strenth hess left and takyn hess the plane. Iuno rycht quayntly causys Turnus to fle, Ane fen?eit figour persewand of Enee. The ilk stound, of hys awyn fre volunte, Iove callys Iuno, and thus carpys he: “O thow my syster german and my feir, My best beluffyt spowss, most leif and deir, Thyne opynyon hass not dissauyt the, As thou belevyt: now may thou not se Quhow Venus doys susteyn and fortyfy The Troiane rowtis and pyssans by and by? Nane actyve handis, nor stowt myndis, I weyn, Nor bodeys reddy all perrellys to sustene, Haue thai, thou may se be experiens.” Quhamto Iuno, with humyl reverens, Answeryt: “My sweit and mast gudly husband, Quharto lyst the renew my sorow at hand, As cayrfull wight, that lykis nocht sic bourdis? All efferd of thy fatal dreidfull wordis I am bestad; bot war I now, I weyn, Als strangly belovyt as I sum tyme haue bene— Thocht ?it, God wait, accordyt so tobe Baith to myne honour and thy dignyte— I say, war I beluffyt as I was ayr, Thou Iove almyghty ryngand euermar Suld not deny me sa sobyr a thyng, Bot at I mycht withdraw, at my lykyng, Furth of the feild Turnus, and hym save Onto hys fader Dawnus, that our the lave Belovyt hym, as rayson wald,” quod sche. “Now sall he perysch, and now sal he de, And sched hys gentyll blude sa pacient, In grewss panys be Troianys tort and rent; And netheless hys kyn origynall Is renownyt of godly stok ryall, Discendit of our seid and hevynly clan, Fra god Pylumnus to rekkyn the ferd man; And eik thow wait, full oft with large hand, With mony oystis and ryght fair offerand, Thy templys and thyne altaris chargit hass he, In wirschyp of thy myghty maieste.” The souerane kyng of hevyn imperiall In few wordis maid answer thus at all: “Gif thow askis a resput or delay, Bot for a tyme or tyll a certane day, Of thys evident deth of Turnus ?yng, Desyrand I suld grant the sik a thyng, All thocht he mortale be rycht sone we knaw, I leif the to remove hym and withdraw, And from this instant perrellus hard fayt Steill hym away, and gyde hym by the gait, For so lang space ?yt restis at will of me To lenth hys lyfe, quhilk I the grant,” quod he. “Bot gif sa beys, that vndre thy request Mair hie pardon lurkis, I wald thow cest; For gif thou wenys that all the victory Of the batale, and chancis by and by, May be reducyt and alterat clar agane, A mysbyleve thou fosteris all invane.” To quham Iuno on this wyss said wepyng: “Quhat harm mycht fall, thocht be sum takyn or syng Thow schew thy mynd, and grantit that,” quod sche, “Quhilk be thy wordis of fatale destane Now grunschis thou to geif or to conceid? That is to say, quhat forss, thocht thou in deid Waldyst appreif and ratyfy agane That Turnus lyfe a lang tyme suld remane? Bot now approchis to that innocent knycht A feirfull end—he sal to ded be dicht, Or than my sawys ar voyd of veryte. And O, wald God at rathar sa suldbe That I dissauyt war bot with fals dreid, And at thou list, as thou has mycht in deid, Thy fatale promyss and thy statutis strange In bettir purposs to translait and change!” Fra scho thir wordis had said, the ilk tyde Dovn from the hevyn scho leyt hir selvyn slyde, Befor hyr dryvand a tempestuus wynd, And all abowt, befor and eik behynd, Within a clowd of myst circulyt cleyn: So throw the air bownyt furth this queyn Towart the Troiane hostis in the planys, And to the tentis socht of Lawrentanys. Thys goddes than furth of ane boyss clowd In lyknes of Ene dyd schaip and schrowd A voyd figur, but strenth or curage bald, The quhilk wondyrus monstre tobehald With Troiane wapynnys and armour grathis sche, With scheild and helm and tymbret set on hie, Be semlant lyke Eneas godlyhed; And tharto ekis scho in euery sted Quent fen?eit wordis, fant and contyrfait, With voce, but mynd, or ony other consait; And fen?eis eik hys concernans and pacis (Syklyke as that, thai say, in diuerss placis The wraithis walkis of goistis that ar ded, Or as the slepy dremys, fra sted to sted Fleand in swevyn, makis illusionys, Quhen mennys myndis oft in dravillyng gronys); And all befor the forfront of the feild Richt haltandly, as curageus vnder scheild, Musturis this ymage, that with dartis keyn Aggrevyt Turnus, and dyd hym chyde in teyn, Prouocand hym to bargane and tyl ire. And Turnus tho als hoyt as any fyre Thys figur dyd invaid, and tharat he In gret dispyte a quhirrand dart leyt fle; Bot this ilk schaddo, as sum deill addred, Turnyt abowt, and gaif the bak and fled. Than Turnus, wenand Ene had tane the flycht, And al awondryt of that selcouth syght, Within hys mynd a vayn comfort kawch he, And cryis lowd: “Quhydder fleys thou now, Ene? Leif nevir, for schame, thus dissolait and waist Thy new allyans promyst the in haist, Of Lavynya the spousyng chalmyr at hand, And all this ilk regioun and this land, Quhilk thou sa far hass socht owt our the se: My rycht hand sal the saysyng geif,” quod he. With sik wordis he schowtand dyd persew, And ay the glymmyrand brand baith schuke and schew, Nathyng persavand quhou this myrth and blyss Away quyte with the wynd bewavit is. On cace thar stude a mekill schip that tyde, Hyr wail ionyt til a schor rokis syde, With plankis and with bryggis layd on land, The entre reddy grathit weill thai fand; In the quhilk schyp Osynyus kyng, I wyss, Come laitly from the cite of Clusys. Thydder went this wrath or schaddo of Ene, That semyt, all abasyt, fast to fle, And hyd hyr dern vndre hychis tharin. Na slawar Turnus hastis hym to ryn, That but delay he spedis to this schyp, Ran owr the bryg, and inwith burd can skyp; And scars was entrit in the forcastell, Quhen Saturnys douchter saw hir tyme befell; Than soyn the cabyll in sondir smytis sche, And fra the schor draif the schip throu the see. Bot Turnus absent thus that sammyn howr Eneas seyrssys throw amyd the stowr, And in hys renk quham euer be met lay ded; Full mony a man he kyllit in that sted. And tharwithall hys lycht and fen?eit gost, Fra tyme the schip was chargyt fra the cost, No langar sekis hyrnys hir to hyde, Bot flaw vp in the ayr the sammyn tyde, And al dissoluyt into a dyrk clowd. The meyn sesson, can forss of wyndis lowd Turnus far furth amyd the deip sey dryve; He dyd behald abowt hym tho belyve, All ignorant quhat wyss this chance was wrocht, And of hys lyfe salvyng na thyng he rocht; With handis iunct vphevit towart hevyn, Syk wordis he furth braid with drery stevyn: “Almychty fader of the hevynnys hie, Hass thou me reput on sic wyss tobe Confusyt in this schame for myn offens? And will I suffyr syk torment and pennans? Quhidder am I dryve, and from quhens am I cumyn? Quhat maner eschewyng or fleyng haue I nummyn? In quhat estait sall I return agane? Sall I evir se the wallys Lawrentane, Or evir eft my tentis sall I se? Quhat may ?on ost of men now say of me, Quhilkis my querrell and me followit to feild, Quham now, allace, lo, feghtand vnder scheild ?ondir (schame to say the harm) sa wikkytly Reddy to myschews deth beleft haue I? Lo, I behald thame fleand paill and wan, And heris the granyng of mony douchty man In my defalt falland fey to grond. Quhat sal I do, allace the wofull stond, Or quhilk land (thocht a thousand tymys I stervit) May swelly me sa deip as I haue servyt? Bot, O ?e wyndis, rathar haue mercy, On rowkis and on craggis by and by Do swak this schyp, sen heir na erth I se, And haue of wrachit Turnus sum pyete, Quhilk of hys fre will, stad in this maner, Besekis ?ow with all hartly prayer; Do warp my body on the schaldis onkend, Far furth on Syrtys at the warldis end, Quhar Rutilyanys me nevir fynd agane, Sa that na fame nor rumour may remane Eftir my deth of this schaymfull trespass.” And, sayand thus, in mynd dyd he cumpass Full mony chancis rolland to and fro, Quhiddir gif he suld, for proper lak and wo, Into this fury smyte hym with hys brand, And thryst the bludy blaid in with hys hand Throw owt hys rybbys and sched his hart blude, Or than to swak hym self amyd the flude, Swymmand to seik the nerrest costis bay, In feild agane the Troianys to assay. Athir way till assay thryss presyt hes he, And thryss hym styntis Iuno, queyn mast hie, Havand compassioun of this ?ong man bald, And can asswage hys mynd, and hand withhald. Furth held the schip, slydand owt our the fludis, With prosper wynd and followand tyde sa gude is, Quhill he is careit suyrly throw the see Tyll Ardea, hys faderis auld cite. In Turnus sted Me?entius dyd succeid, Killyt doun his fays, and spul?eit of thar weid. Durand this quhile, in fatis marciall, Me?entyus movyt with ardour bellycall, Be instigatioun of Iove in that neid, Can to the batale in hys place succeid, And the Troianys to invaid na thing sparis, That semyt prowd as all the feild war tharis. Than sammyn to recontyr hym atanys Semlyt haill ostis of Hethrurianys, And all assail?eit Me?entyus allon; Aganyst a man thai rowtys euery one, Inflambyt all in malyce, maid persutys, And thik as haill schour at hym schaftis schutis. Bot he, lyke to a ferm rowk, quhilk we se Strekyt on lenth amyd the large see, Sytuat aganys the rageand wyndis blast, And brym wallys boldynnand wondyr fast, From all that violens doys hym self defend, And haill the forss sustenys to the end Baith of the hevynnys and byr of seys rage, Remanand onremovyt ferm in hys stage: Als stern standis Me?entyus in that stound. And first he hes fellit and laid to the grond Hebrus, the son of ane Dolycaon, And hym besyde Latagus slew onon, And Palmus eik, accustumat to fle: Bot with a stane Latagus brytnyt he Quhilk of a montane semyt a gret nuke, With quham hym on the vissage he ourtuke; And Palmus howgh sennonys smait in tway Maid hym sa slaw he mycht nocht fle away; Thar armour syne to Lawsus gevyn hess he To weir on hys schuldris, and crovn on hie Thar creistis set, the quhilk sa rychly schane. He slew also Evantus a Troiane, And Mynas syne he kyllys in the feild, Quhilum to Parys compan?eoun and evin eild; Quham on a nycht Theana, gude and fair, To hys fader Amycus in Troy bair, Quhen Heccuba, douchter of Cisseus, Dremyt scho was gret, the story tellis thus, With a fyre broynd, and the self samyn nycht Was delyver of Parys, the fey knycht, Quhilk in hys natyve cite maid hys end: Bot thir feildis Lawrentan ombekend Withhaldis now the body of Mynas. So brym in stowr that stond Me?entyus was, Lyke to the strenthy sangler or the bor, Quham hundis quest with mony quhryne and ror Down dryvyng from the hightis maid discend, Quhilk mony wyntyr tofor had hym defend In Vesulus, the cauld montane hie, That is ourheldyt with mony fyr tre; Or than the bustuus swyne weil fed, that bredis Amang the buskis rank of ryspe and redis, Besyde the layk of Lawrens, mony ?heris, Quham that he is betrappyt fra his feris Amyd the huntyng ralys and the nettis, Standis at the bay, and vp his byrsys settis, Grasland hys tuskis with astern fyry eyn, With spaldis hard and harsk, awfull and teyn, That nane of all the huntmen thar present Hym to engreif hass strenth or hardyment, Nor dar approchyng within hys byt neir, Bot standand far on dreich with dart and speir, Assoverit of hys reik, the beste assays, With felloun schowtis, bustuus cryis, and brays. Nane other wyss stud all the Tuscane rowt This stalwart knycht Me?entius abowt, And, thocht thai iust cawss had of wreth and feyd, Thar was nane of thame durst hym put to ded, Nor curage had with drawyn swerd in hand Hym till assaill, nor mach apon the land; Bot with takillis and castyn dartis on far Thai warp at hym, bot durst not ane cum nar, And with huge clamour hym infestis that tyde; He, onabasyt, abowt on euery syde Behaldis, gyrnand full of proper teyn, And with hys scheild choppyt by schaftis bedene. Furth of the ancyent boundis of Coryt tho Was cum a Greik, quhilk clepyt was Acro, That fugityve into his lusty heyt Had left hys spowsal trewth plicht oncompleit; Quham as Me?entius saw amyd the rowt Hym grevand soir, as weriour stern and stowt, And saw the plesand plomys set on hycht Of hys tymrell, and eik the purpour brycht, Quhilk of his trewthplycht lufe he bair in syng; Than lyke a hungry lyon rumysyng, Constrenyt by hys rageand empty maw, The beistis dennys circuland all on raw, Gif he on cace aspyis a swyft ra, Or the ?yng hart with spryngand tyndis twa, Ioyful he bradis tharon dispytuusly, With gapand gowle, and vprasys in hy The lokkyrris lyand in his nek rowght, And all the bestis bowellis thrymlys throwght, Hurkylland thar on, quhar he remanyt and stude, Hys gredy gammys bedyis with the red blude— On the sammyn wyss, Me?entyus rycht baldly Mydwart hys fays rowt ruschit in hy; Down smytis fey Acron amyd the ost, That in the ded thraw, ?aldand vp the gost, Smate with hys helys the grond in maltalent, And brokkyn schaftis with hys blude bysprent. This ilk Me?entius eik deden?eit nocht To sla Orodes, quhilk than was onflocht, That is to knaw, quhill frawart hym he went, And reput na wyss, as by hys entent, Syk ane fleand to wond into the bak, Onawarnyst, quhen he na defens mycht mak, Bot ran abowt and met hym in hys rayss; Than athir man assemblit face for face. Orodes mair of prattik was all owt, Bot the tother in dedis of armys mair stowt, That to the erth ourthrawyn he hess his feir, And possand at hym with hys stalwart speir, Apon hym set hys fut, and thus he said: “O now my feris, beys blyth and glaid; Lo, a gret party of this weir, but less, Heir lyis at erd, the douchty Orodes.” Hys feris sammyn rasyt vp a cry, With ioyus sound in syng of victory, And blew the pryss triumphall for his deth; Bot this Orodes, ?aldand vp the breth, Onto Me?entyus carpys thus on hie: “Me onrevengit, thou sal nocht victour be, For weill I wait that sone I salbe wrokyn, Na, for all thy prowd wordis thou hass spokkyn, Thow sall nocht lang endur into sik ioy; Bot siclyke chancis and semblant ennoy Abydis the, thocht thou be nevir sa bald, Thys sammyn feild sall thy ded corps withhald.” To quham Me?entyus smyland said in teyn: “Thou sall de first, quhat evyr to me forseyn Or previdyt hass myghty Iove,” quod he, “Quham fader of goddis and kyng of men cleip we.” And sayand thus, the schaft the ilk thraw Furth of hys wond and body dyd he draw. Tho Orodes the hard rest doith oppress, The cauld and irny slepe of dethys stress, And vp the breth he ?ald onon rycht With eyn closyt in evir lestand nycht. Cedicus altotrynschit Alcathous, And Sacrator to grund laid Hydaspus; Rapo, ane Arcaid, hass Parthenyus slane, And Orses, wondir byg of blude and bane; And Mesapus kyllyt the stowt Clonyvs, And Erycates with Lychaonyus; The formast lyggand at the erd he ourraucht, That by hys hedstrang horss a fall had cawcht, And Lychaonyus eik, a fut man, he Lyghtit on fut and slew in the melle. Aganys hym than went a man of Arge, Hait Lycyus, bodyn with speir and targe; Bot by the way Valerus, gude in nedis, Nocht inexpert in douchty eldris dedis, Recontryt hym, and put hym to the ded; Salyus a Troiane in that sammyn sted Atronyus slew; and Nealces, expert To schut the fleand arrow or castyng dart, Quhilk invadis a man or he be war, Slew Salyus with schot, beand on far. Quhou Eneas the ?ong Lawsus hass slane, Quhilk fred his fader hurt in the bargane. Thus awfull Mars equaly with hys brand The sorow rasyt apon athir hand: Huge slauchter mayd was and seir woundis wyd, Thai kyll and ar bet down on euery syde, That sammyn in the feild thai fall infeir, Baith the victouris, and thai that venquyst weir, And nother party wist, nother he nor he, To salf hym self quhar away to fle: So that the goddis in Iovys hevynly hald Had compassioun and rewth for tobehald The wroith and ire of athir in the fightis, That sik distress rang amang mortal wightis. Venus towart the Troiane syde tuke tent; Aganyst quham, all full of maltalent, Saturnus douchter Iuno, that full bald is, Towart the party aduersar behaldis; And the pail furour of Tysiphone Walkis wod wroth amydwart the melle. Bot pryncipaly Me?entyus all engrevyt, With a gret speir, quharwith he feill myschevit, Went brangland throu the feild all hym allon; Als bustuus as the hydduus Orion, Quhen he on fut woyd throu the mekill see, Scherand the streym with hys schuldris hie, Abufe the wallys of the flude apperis; Or lyke ane ancyent ayk tre, mony ?heris That grew apon sum montane toppys hycht, Semand so hie to euery manis sycht, Quhilk, thocht hys rutis spred in the grond all sydis, Hys crop vpstraucht amyd the clowdis hydis— Syk lyke Me?entius mustyrris in the feild, With huge armour, baith speir, helm and scheild, Aganyst quham Eneas fast hym hyis, Fra tyme amyd the rowt he hym aspyis. The tother, onabasyt, all reddy thar The cummyng of hys douchty aduersar Abydis stowtly, fermyt in hys forss, And massely vpstude with bustuus corss: And, mesurand with hys e als large spaiss As he mycht thraw a castyng speir, thus says: “My rycht hand, and this fleand dart mot be, Quhilk now I tayss, as verray God to me! Assistyng to my schot I ?ou beseik; For I awow, and heir promittys eyk, In syng of trophe or triumphall meith, My lovit son Lawsus forto cleith With spul?e and all harness rent,” quod he, “Of ?ondir rubbaris body, falss Enee.” Thus said he, and fra hys hand the ilk tyde The castyng dart fast byrrand lattis glyde, That fleand sclentis on Eneas scheild, Syne, standand far onrovm ?ond in the feild, Smate worthy Anthores the ilk thraw, Betwix the bowellys and the rybbys law: Anthores, ane of gret Hercules ferys, That com from Arge into hys lusty ?heris, Inherdand to Evander the Arcaid, And had hys dwellyng and hys residens maid In Palentyn, cite Italian, Onhappely now lyggis thus down slane, All of a wound and dynt quhilk in the fycht Addressit was towart ane other knycht. ?it, deand, he beheld the hevynnys large, And can ramembir hys sweit cuntre of Arge.

Eneas tho, quhilk was expert in fyght, Ioyfull quhen that Me?entius blude saw he, Furth hynt hys swerd at hang law by hys thee, And fervently towart hys fa can pass, Quhilk, for the dynt, sum deill astonyst was. Quhen Lawsus saw this aventour of weir, He wepyt wail sair for hys fader deir; Sa wobegone becam this lusty man That salt teris fast our hys chekis ran. Forsuyth, I sall not ourslyp in this sted Thy hard myschance, Lawsus, and fatale ded, And thy maist dowchty actis bellycall: O fresch ?ongker, maist dyng memoriall I sall reherss, gyf ony faith may be Gevyn to sa gret dedis of antiquyte. With this Me?entyus men?eit drew abak, Harland hys leg quharin the schaft stak, That quhar he went he baris our the feild Hys ennemyss lance fixit in hys scheild. Betwix thame ruschys in the ?ong Lawsus, Amyd thar wapynnys, stern and curagus, Hym self hass set forto sustene the fyght; Vnder Eneas rycht hand rasyt on hycht, That reddy was to smyte a dedly wond, In steppis he, and baldly the ilk stound The bytand brand vphevyt keppyt he, And can resist and stynt the gret Enee. Hys feris followys with a felloun schowt; Quhill that Me?entius of the feild wan owt, Diffend and coverit with hys sonnys scheild, Thai cast dartis thikfald thar lord to held, With schaftis schot, and flanys gret plente, Perturband thar stern aduersar Ene, That all enragyt hys sovir targe erekkit, And thar vndre hym haldis closly dekkyt. And lyke as sum tyme clowdis brystis attanys, The schowr furth?ettand of hoppand hailstanys, That all the plewmen and thar hynys inhy Fleis of the croftis and feildis by and by; And eik the travellour ?ond vnder the wald Lurkand withdrawys to sum sovir hald, Owdir vnder watyr brays and bankis dern, Or in sum craggis clyft, or deip cavarn, So lang as that the schour lestis on the plane, That he may, when the son schynys agane, Exers hys iourne, or hys wark alsfast— Syk wyss Ene with schoit and dartis cast Was all ourheld, and ombeset ilk syde, Quhil he the press of batale styntis that tyde, And all thar forss sustenyt and deray; Reprevand Lawsus, thus begouth to say, And mannansyt hym with brand of blude all red: “Quhidder hastis thou sa fast apon thy ded? Or quhou dar thou ondertak into fyght Syk interpryss, quhilk is abuf thy mycht? Thou art nocht wyss; thy tendir hart,” quod he, “And rewthfull mynd all owt dissavis the.” Bot for all thys ?ong Lawsus, vail que vaill, Wald no wyss cess Eneas till assaill. Than hyear rayss the wraith and felloun ire Of the ilk manfull Troiane lordly syre, And eyk the fatale sisteris tho in deid Had wymplyt vp this Lawsus lattyr threid: For so Eneas stokis hys styf brand Throw owt this ?ongker, hard vp to hys hand, That swerd, befor maid mannansyng and bost, Throw gyrd that gentill body and hys cost, Hys target persand and hys armour lycht, And eik hys cote of goldyn thredis brycht Quhilk hys moder hym span; and, to conclude, Hys bosum all is fillyt of hait blude; Sone efter is the spreit of lyfe furth went Down to the goistis law with sad entent, And left the body ded, and hyne dyd pass. Bot quhen Anchises son, ferss Eneas, Beheld hys wlt and contenans in deyng, Hys sweit vissage sa in the ded thrawyng Becummyn wan and paill on diuerss wyss, He sychit profundly owder twyss or thryss, And drew abak hys hand, and rewth hass hynt; For sa into hys mynd, eftir the dynt, The ymage of hys faderly piete Imprentit wass, that on this wyss said he: “O douchty ?ynglyng, worthy tobe menyt, Worthy tobe bewalyt and complenyt, Quhat sall the reuthfull compacient Ene For sa gret lovabill dedis rendir the? Or quhat may he the ?eld sufficient For sik natural and inborn hardyment? Thyne armour, quharof sumtyme thou reiosyt, With the I leif, for ay tobeyn eniosyt; Onto thy parentis handis and sepulcre I the belief tobe entyrit,” quod he, “Gyf that sic maner of triumphe and cost May do thame plesour, or eyss onto thy gost. Bot thou, onsilly child, sa will of red, Do comfort heirwith thy lamentabill ded, That thou ourmatchit art and thus lyis slane By the gretast Eneas handis twane.” Syne he hys feris can repreif and chyde That thai sa lang delayt hym besyde, Makand na haist to bair hys corps away; And he hym self betwix hys armys tway The ded body vplyftis fra the grond, That with red blude of his new grene wond Besparklyt had hys ?allow lokis brycht, That ayr war kemmyt and addressyt rycht. Fra Me?entius knew ?ong Lawsus decess, Hym to revenge his lyfe lost in the press. The meyn sesson, hys fader with his feris, Down at the fludis syde of Tyberis, Stanschit his wondis with watyr by and by, Weschand the blude and swait from hys body. Hys helm of steil besyde hym hang weil ne Apon a grayn or branch of a grene tre; Hys other weghty harness, gud in neid, Lay on the gyrss besyde hym in the meid; Hys trasty chosyn verlettis hym abowt; And he ful sor wondyt, all in dowt, Stude lenand with hys wery nek and bonys, Owt our a bowand tre, with sair gronys; Hys weil kemmyt berd, hyngand ful straucht Apon his breist, onto hys gyrdill raucht; And feill tymys on Lawsus menys he, Prayand full oft he mycht hym salfly se, And mony messyngeris onto hym hess send, To withdraw hym the feild, and to defend That he abyde na langar in bargane And schaw quhat sorow for hym hys fader had tane. Bot than Lawsus ded owt of the feild Hys wofull feris careit apon a scheild, Wepand sa gret a man was brocht to grond, And discumfyt with sa grysly a wond. Me?entius mynd and consait, the ilk tyde, Suspekand the harmys quhilkis war betyde, Onfar considerit the causs of thar murnyng, And on hys canos hair the dust gan slyng, With mekill powdir fyland hys hasart hed; And baith hys handis in that sammyn sted Towart the hevin vphevis in a fary, And he the goddis and starnys fast dyd wary; Syne, lenand on hys sonnys corps, thus cryis: “O my deir child and tendir get heir lyis! Had I sa gret appetit and delyte Onto this wrachit lyfe, sa ful of syte, That I the sufferit to entyr in my sted Vndre our fays hand, and with thy ded My lyfe is salfit? Ha, I thy fader heir, Quhilk the begat, my only son sa deir, Suld I be salf and lyfand eftir the, Throu tha sa grisly wondis that I se? Allace, onto me, wrachit catyve thing, Myne exill now at last and banysyng Becummyn is hard and insufferabill! The stound of deth, the panys lamentabill, Is deip engravyn in my hart onsound; Now am I smyttyn with the mortal wond! I, the self man was the causs of thy ded, With my trespass, my child, in euery sted Filyt the glor and honour of thy name, Thy hie renovn bespottand with my schame, As I that was, by invy and haitrent Of my awin pepill, with thar haill assent, Expellit from my ceptre and my ryng, And was adettyt, for my mysdoyng Onto our cuntre, till haue sufferit pane: I aucht and worthy was to haue bene slane, And to haue ?ald this wikkyt sawle of myne Be all maner of turment and of pyne, Fortill amend myne offencis and fed. Ha, now I lyf, allace, and thou art ded! ?it want I not off men the cumpany, Nowder lyght of lyfe, ne cleirness of the sky, Bot soyn I sal thame leif and part thar fra.” And sayand thus, sammyn with mynd ful thra He rasyt hym vp apon hys wondit thee, And determyt to revenge hym or de; For thocht the violens of hys sair smart Maid hym onfery, ?it hys stalwart hart And curage ondekeit was gude in neid. He bad go fech Rhebus, hys ryall steid, Quhilk was hys wirschip and hys comfort haill, And hys support hys fays to assaill; For by this horss in euery gret iourne Hame fra the feild victour eschapit he. Quhamto Me?entyus, but mair abaid, Seand the steid drowpand and sad, thus said: “Rhebus, we twa hess levit lang yfeir, Gyf that to mortal wightis in this erd heir Ony tyme may be reput lang,” quod he. “Owder this day beys thou revengear with me Of Lawsus dolorus deith, and wrek our schame, And sall as victour with the bryngyn hame ?on bludy spul?e, and Eneas hed; Or, gif na fors nor strenth into that sted Will suffir ony way that it be so, We sal in feild sammyn de baith two. For, O moist forcy steid, my lovyt foill, I can na wyss beleif at thou may thoill Tobe at ony otheris commandment, Nor that the list dedeyn, gif I war schent, Till obey ony master or lord Troiane.” And sayand thus, ful towartly onane The steid bekend held to hys schulder plat, And he at eyss apon hys bak doun sat, And baith hys fystis fillyt with dartis keyn, With helm on hed burnyst brycht and scheyn, Abuf the quhilk hys tymbret buklyt was, Lyke till a lokryt mayn with mony fass. And into sik array with swyft curss he Furth steris hys steid, and draif in the melle. Deip in hys hart boldynnys the felloun schame, Myxit with dolour, angir and defame; The fervent luf of hys son ?yng of age Gan catchyng hym into the furyus rage; Tharto alsso persuadis to the fyght Hys forss weil knawin, hys hardyment and mycht; And, in sik poynt, throw owt the rowtis all With mychty voce thryss dyd Eneas call. Eneas hard hym cry, and weil hym knew, And glaid tharof can towartis hym persew, And prayand says: “The fader of goddis hie, And eik mychty Apollo, that grant to me, Thou wald begyn in bargan on this land To mell with me, and to meyt hand for hand.” Thus carpyt he, and with stern lance, but tary, Furth steppys forto meyt hys aduersary. Bot Me?entius, seand hym cumand, Cryit to hym onon and bad hym stand: “O thou maist cruell aduersar,” said he, “Quhat wenys thou so to effray and bost me, Sen thou my son hass me bereft this day, Quhilk was only the maner and the way Quharby thou myght ourcum me and distroy? Now, sen that I haue tynt all warldis ioy, Nowdyr I abhor the ded, to starve in fycht, Nor rak I ocht of ony goddis mycht. Desist, and cess to bost me or mannass, For I am cum to de in this ilk plass; Bot first I bryng the thir rewardis,” quod he. With that word, at his fa a dart leyt fle, And efter that ane other hass he cast, And syne ane other hass he fixit fast, About hym prekand in a cumpas large: Bot all thir dyntis sustenyt the goldin targe. Thryss on the left half fast, as he war wod, About Eneas raid he quhar he stude, Thik with hys handis swakkand dartis keyn; And thryss this Troiane prynce our all the greyn, Intil hyss stalwart stelyt scheild stikand owt, Lyke a hair wod the dartis bair abowt. At last, as he ennoyt of this deray, This irksum traysyng, iowkyng and delay, And cumryt wolx samony dartis invane Thus oft to draw furth and to cast agane, As he that was matchit that tyme, but faill, With hys fa man in bargane inequale, Quhilk ay was at avantage and onflocht, Full mony thing revoluyt he in thocht; Syne on that weirman ruschit he in teyn; In the forhed, betwix the horsys eyn, He kest hys speir with all his fors and mycht. Vpstendis than the stalwart steid on hycht, And with his helys flang vp in the ayr; Down swakkis the knycht sone with a fellon fair, Foundris fordwart flatlyngis on hys spald, Ourquhelmyt the man, and can hys feit onfald. Than the Latynys, and eik pepill Troianys, The hevynnys dyndlit with a schowt at anys. Eneas gyrd abufe hym with a braid, Hynt furth hys swerd, and forthir thus he said: “Quhar is he now, Me?entius, sa stern? Quhar is the ferss stowt curage of that bern?” Quhamto Me?entius, this ilk prynce Tyrrheyn, Fra that he mycht alyftyn vp his eyn To se the hevynnys licht, and draw hys braith, And hys rycht mynd agane recoverit haith, Thus answeris: “O thou dispetuus fo, Quharto me chydis thou reprochand so, And mannancis me to the ded by and by? Of my slauchter I think na villany, Nor on sik wyss heir com I not in feild, That I stand aw to swelt vnder my scheild; Nor, I beleif, na frendschip in thy handis, Nane syk trety of sawchnyng nor cunnandis, My son Lawsus band vp with the, perfay. Bot of a thyng I the beseik and pray, Gif ony plesour may be grantit or beld Till aduersaris, that lyis venquyst in feild; That is to knaw, suffir my body haue Ane sepultur, and with erd be bygrave. I knaw abowt me standand in this sted My folkis byttyr haitrent and gret feid: Defend me from thar furour, I requeir, And grant my corps, besyde my sonnys infeir, Into sum tumbe entyrit for tobe.” And sayand thus, knawand at he most de, Befor hys eyn persavyt the burnyst brand, That throuch hys gorge went from Eneas hand; Within hys armour, schortly to conclude, Furth bruschit the sawle with gret stremys of blude. Be this the son declynyt was almost, So that the Latynys and Rutilian ost, Quhat for the absens of thar duke Turnus, And new slauchter of bald Me?entius, Withdrew thame to thar raset in affray, And Troianys went onto thar rest quhil day. Explicit liber decimus Eneados Sequitur prologus in Vndecimum eiusdem [The Proloug of the Elevint Buke] Thow hie renown of Martis chevalry, Quhilk gladis euery gentill wight to heir, Gif thou mycht Mars and Hercules deify, Quharfor beyn nobillys to follow prowes swer?

To speke of moral vertuus hardyment, Or rathar of dyvyne, is myne entent; For warldly strenth is febill and impotent In Goddis sight, and insufficient. The Psalmyst says that God is not content In mannys stalwart lymmys nor strenth of corss, Bot into thame that trastis in hys forss, Askand mercy, and dredand iugement. Strang fortitud, quhilk hardyment cleip we, Abuf the quhilk the vertu souerane Accordyng pryncis, hecht magnanymyte, Is a bonte set betwix vicis twane: Of quham fuyl hardynes clepit is the tane, That vndertakis all perrellis but avice; The tother is namyt schamefull cowardyce, Voyd of curage, and dolf as ony stane. The first is hardy all owt by mesur, Of tyme nor rayson gevis he na cuyr, No dowt he castis, bot all thinkis suyr, Nocht may he suffir, nor hys hait endur; The tother is of all prowes sa puyr, That evir he standis in feir and felloun dreid, And nevir dar vndertake a douchty deid, Bot doith all curage and all manheid smuyr. The first soundis towart vertu sum deill, Hardy he is, couth he be avyse; Of hardyment the tother hass na feill: Quhou may curage and cowardys agre?

Lyff in thy flesch as master of thy corps, Lyf in this warld as nocht ay to remane; Resist the fendis slycht with all thy forss, He is thy ancyent ennemy, werst of ane; A thousand wylys he hess, and mony a trane, He kendillis oft thy flesch in byrnand heit, He causys wrachit plesans seym full sweit, And, for nocht, of this fals warld makis the fane. He is thy fa and aduersar principall, Of promyssioun wald the expell the land, For he the sammyn lost, and caucht a fall; Enfors the strangly contrar hym to stand. Rayss hie the targe of faith vp in thy hand, On hed the halsum helm of hoip onlace, In cheryte thy body all embrace, And of devoit oryson mak thy brand. Stand at defens, and schrynk not for a schor; Thynk on the haly marthyris at ar went, Thynk on the payn of hell, and endless glor, Thynk quhou thy Lord for the on rude was rent, Thynk, and thou fle fra hym, than art thou schent, Thynk all thou sufferis ontyll hys paynis nocht is, Thynk with quhou precyus pryce as thi sawll bocht is, And ay the moder of grace in mynd enprent. Feill beyn thy fays, fers and full of slycht, Bot be thou stalwart campioun and knycht; In feild of grace with forsaid armour brycht Thou may debait thame lyghtly in ilk fyght: For of fre will thyne acton is sa wight Nane may it perss, wilt thou resist and stand; Becum thow cowart, crawdoun recryand, And by consent ory cok, thy ded is dycht.

Syk promyss hecht I not the lattir hour To thy fader Evandrus, quhen that he At my departyng last embrasyt me, And send me to conquyss a large empyre; And, dredand syk for the, that lordly syre Vs monyst tobe war and avyse, Becauss the men quhamwith to do had we War bald and stern; said we had wer at hand With bustuus folk that weill in stryfe durst stand.

O fey onhappy kyng Archadian! Now thy sonnys ded corps crewelly slane Thou salbehald: allace, the panys strang!

Bot, O Evander, beys not with me wraith; Thou sall not se thy son was dryve abak With schamefull wondis that he caucht in the bak; Ne thou hys fader, war he alyve this day, Suld nevir haue lak of hym, ne for hym pray For hys desert he deit a schamefull deth; And now with honour hess he ?ald the breth. Bot, netheless, quhat harm, ful ways me! Quhou large support, hey, quhat beld or supple In hym hess tynt Ausonya the ryng, And quhou gret deill hess lost Ascanyus ?yng!” ?ong Pallas corps is till Evander sent, With all honour accordyng hys tyrment. Quhen he bewalyt had on this maner, This wofull corps he bad do lyft on beir, And with hym send a thousand men in hy Walyt of euery rowt and cumpany, Forto convoy and do hym falloschip At hys last honour and funeral wirschip, And tobe present at the lamentyng Of hys fader, to comfort hys murnyng; Thocht smal solace was that to hys regrait, Quhilk was sa huge, bot to hys estait Accordit weill that sik thingis suld be, Quhen all wightis mycht rew on hym to se. Sum of Eneas ferys bissely Flakis to plet thame presys by and by, And of small wikkyris fortobeld a beir Of sowpill wandis and of bronys seir, Bund with the syonys or the twystis sle Of small rammell or stobys of akyn tre. Thyr beddis beldyt, or funeral lytteris, Syk tumbys as for ded corpss efferis, With greyn burgionys and branschys fair and weill Thai gan ourheld, and stentys euery deill: Amyd the quhilkis, of blumys apon a byng Strowyt full hie, thai laid this Pallas ?yng; Lyggyn tharon als semly forto se As is the fresch flowris schynand bewte, Newly pullyt vp from hys stalkis smaill With tendyr fyngeris of the damysaill, Or the soft violet that doys freschly schyne, Or than the purpour flour, hayt iacynthyne; Quham all thocht the erth hys moder with sap Hym nurys not, nor comfortis on hir lap, ?yt than hys schene cullour and figur glaid Is not all went, nor hys bewte defaid. Eneas syne twa robbys furth gart fold Of rych purpour and styf burd of gold Quhilk vmquhil Dydo, quheyn of Sydones, Of sik laubour full byssy tho, I gess, As at that tyme to pless hym wonder glaid, With hir awyn handis to hym wrocht and maid, Wovyn full weill, and brusyt as rych wedis, Of costly stuf and subtell goldyn thredis; And with the tane of thir full dolorusly Eneas cled the ?yng Pallas body, Tobe hys finall and hys last honour; Hys lokkis and hys harys the self hour, Quhilkis war forto be brynt in assys cald, Into the tother habyt dyd he fald. Abuf all thys, rewardis mony ane, Yconquest in this batall Lawrentane, In haill hepys with hym hess he send, And bad thai suld tak gud kepe and attend To leid the pray per ordour pompusly. Feill horssys als he gaue thame by and by, With wapynnys eik, and other precyus geir, That he had reft hys fa men in the weir; The presoneris alsso, quham he had tak, He sent with handis bund behynd thar bak, Quhilkis, at the obsequeis or entyrment, To the infernal gostis suldbe sent, And with thar bludis sched, as was the gyss, The funerall flambe strynkyll in sacrifyss. He bad the capitanys and the dukis all, In syng of trophe or pomp triumphall, Gret perkis bair or treyn saplyng that squair is, Cled with the armour of thar aduersaris, To wryte and hyng tharon baith all and sum The namys of thar ennemyss ourcum. Furth led was the onsilly Acetes, Ourset with age, and sorow mycht nocht cess; Now bludyand hys awyn breist with hys fystis, Now with hys nalys hys face rentis and brystis, And oft down fallys spaldit on the erd, With mony gowl, and a full petuus rerd. And furth war led rych cartis for the nanys, Besprent with blude of the Rutylianys. And eftir com Aethon, hys werly steid, Dispul?eit of hys harnessyng and weid; Wepand he went for wo, men mycht haue seyn With gret terys floddyrrit hys face and eyn. Ane bair hys helm, ane other bair hys speir; For the remanys of hys harness and geir, Syk as hys rych gyrdill and cotarmour, Turnus victor byreft hym in the stour. Furth haldis syne the drery cumpany Of Troianys, and Tyrrheyn dukis thame by; And wofull Archadis, in syng of dolour, weris Scheldis reversyt, and doun turnyt thar speris. And efter that, per ordour, by and by, Thai beyn furth passyt euery cumpany, Eneas tho can styntyng and abaid, And with a petuus regrait thus he said: “The horribill batellys of thir sammyn weris Tyll otheris funerall womentyng and terys Callys ws from thens; we may nocht follow the, Thyne entyrment forto behald and se. Adew for ay, Pallas, beluffyt best, Fair weill for evyr intill eternall rest!” Na mair he said, bot went towart New Troy, Entrand tharin with terys of ennoy. Quhou Eneas onto the Latynys gave Twelf days of respyt the ded corpsis to grave. Be this war cum fra Kyng Latynys cyte Ambassatouris, with branch of olyve tre, Besekand favouris and benevolens; That he wald suffir tobe careyt from thens Tha corpsys ded, quhilkis on the feldis broun Lay strowyt heir and thar, with swerd bet down, And thame restor agane of hys gentre, To suffyr thame begravyn fortobe; Assuryng hym, thar mycht be led na weir On venquyst folkis, that lyfless mycht not steir, And prayt spair thar pepill at syk myschans, Quhylum clepyt hys frendis and acquentans. Quhen that Eneas, heynd, curtass and gud, Thar peticioun sa ressonabill vndirstud, As man that was fulfillyt of bonte, Thar hail desyre full glaidly grantit he, And forthir eik onto thame thus he said: “O Latyn folkis, quhat mysfortoun onglaid Hass ?ou involuyt in sa onhappy weir That ?he chayss ws away, ?our frendis deir? Desyre ?he paix bot for thame that bene lost By marcyall fayt, and slane into this ost? And I, forsuyth, tyll all that levand be Wald glaidly grant the sammyn, I say for me. Neuer hyddyr had I cummyn, wer not, perfay, Into this sted the fatys hecht for ay Our restyng place providit and herbry; Ne na weirfar with ?our pepill led I.

Gif he pretendis in batale with a brand To end the weir, or Troianys of this land Forto expell, heir semyt hym vnder scheild With wapynnys to recontre me in feild, That nane bot ane of ws war left levand, Quhais lyfe God lyst withhald, or hys rycht hand. Now haldis on, and all the lyfless banys And corpsis of ?our wofull cite?anys Do byrn and bery efter ?our awyn gyss,” Says Eneas, the Troiane war and wyss. Than of hys speche so awondrit war thai, Kepit thar silens, and wist nocht quhat to say; And athir towartis otheris turnys, but mayr, And can behald his fallow in a stair. The eldast man amang thame, finaly, Clepyt Drances, that had full gret envy At ?yng Turnus, all way to hym infest For ald malyce or of cryme manyfest, Begouth to speke and ansuer thus agane: “O huge gret is thy fame, thou duke Troiane, Bot far grettar all owt we may aspy Thy dedis of armys and thy chevalry; With quhat lovyngis equaill may I compair The to the goddis in hevyn abuf the ayr? Quhidder sall I fyrst extoll, and wonder in the, Thy gret gentryce and sa iust equyte, Or thy gret fors and laubour bellicall?

Twelf days of trewys thai band, to stanch debait, Forto kepe paix, and werys sequestrate; Than throu the woddis and thir holtis hie Troianys and Latynys sammyn, he and he, Quhar so thame list, wandris but danger. The heich eschis soundis thar and heir For dyntis rude of the scharp stelyt ax; Down weltit ar with mony granand strakis The fyrrys rekand to the sternys on hie; The mekill syllis of the warryn tre With weggis and with proppis beyn devyd; The strang gustand cedyr is al to schyde; Na cess thai not apon the iargand wanys The gret akys to turss away atanys. The kyng Evander complenyt sor and wareit, Quhen his son Pallas ded was to hym careit. Than Fame with this, alsfast as scho mycht spryng, As messynger of sa gret womentyng, Flaw furth, and all with murnyng fillys sche Evander kyng hys palyce and cyte, Quhilk layt tofor had schawyn that Pallas In Latyum landis sa victoryus was; Now says sche, “Lo, is he brocht on beir!” The Archadis ruschit to the portis in feir, And euery wyght in handis hynt als tyte Ane hait fyre broynd, efter the ald ryte, In lang ordour and rabill, that all the stretis Of schynand flambys lemys brycht and gletis, Quhil all the large feildis of the light Myght seueraly be raknyt at a sight. The Troiane rowtis, on the tother hand, With thame adionys thar folkis sair wepand, Quham as the matronys beheld on sik wyss So duylfully wend to the kyngis palys, The dolorus town in euery streit and way With petuus scrykis and gowlyng fyllit thai. Than was na fors Evander mycht refreyn, Bot in amyddis thame with gret disdene He ruschis, plenand on wofull maner, And fell on growf abuf ded Pallas beir, Wepand and waland as his hart wald breke; Embrasyt hym, bot no word mycht he spek And scars at last with gret difficulte The cundytis of his voce war lowsyt fre. Quhen he mycht speke, than thir hys wordis was: “This is nocht thy last cunnand, son Pallas, Thou promyst not so vnto thy fader deir, Bot at thou suld pass mair warly in weir, And not in danger of the cruell Mart. Owr weill I wist, with harmys at my hart, Quhat aventour, and of quhou mekill mycht Till ony ?ong man, the first feld in fight, Was gret desire of new loif or glory, And how sweit was renown of chevalry.

Ne byd I nocht ?ou, Troianys, to argew Of amyte and allyance bund of new, Ne our rycht handis and promyss, quhilkis we In frendschip knyt and hospitalyte: This mysfortoun is myne of ald thirlage, As tharto detbund in my wrachit age. Bot had this hasty ded, sa ondigest, Haue sufferit bot my son a stound to lest, Quhill of Rutilianys he had slane thousandis, And investit the Troianys in thar landis, That is to say, in Latyum or Lavyn, Weill lykyt me that he had endyt syne. And forthir eik, Pallas, my son so deir, Na mair rychly cowth I the lay on beir, Nor with mair wirschip list me entyre the, Than is providit be reuthfull Enee, Be myghty Troianys and pryncis Tyrrheyn; For all the Tuscane men?e, as heir is seyn, Gret trophe and rich spul?e hydder bryngis, On perkis rychly cled with thar armyngis Quham thy richt hand in feild had put to ded.

Pass haym in haist, and remember to say Thir my desiris to ?our prynce, I ?ou pray: Evander says that thy ryght hand, Ene, Is all the cawss that he delays to de, Or that this haitsum lyfe sustene he wald, Sen now is lost hys son Pallas the bald: Sa till hym that he oblist is of det, Baith to the son and the fader, to set ?on Turnus slauchter for owr recompens: To the Eneas only, but offens, And to fortoun, remanys this iournay ?it, Quharwith thou may thankfully be acquyt. Tell hym, na lust to lyf langar seyk I; Onlesum war syk plesour I set by; Bot for a thraw desyre I to lest heir, Turnus slauchter and deth with me to beir, As glaid tithandis onto my child and barn, Amang the gostis law in skowgis dern.” Heir athir party takis byssy cuyr The ded bodeis to graif in sepultur. The meyn sesson Aurora rasyt hir lycht, Richt confortabill for euery mortall wight, Rendryng agane the oportunyte Of laubour and of wyrkyng, as we se. The prynce Eneas, and the kyng Tarchon, Gret byngis hass of treys mony one Vpbeldyt, by the bowand costis bay. Thydder euery ane dyd cary, but delay, Efter thar eldris gyss, onto that sted The corpsis of thar frendis that war ded, As fortodo thar observans of det; And thar vnder the smoky fyre hass set, Quhill that the hevynnys hye dyd walxin dirk, Involuyt with the reky stewys myrk. And thryss on fut all sammyn euery man In schynand armour abowt the fyris ran, And thryss the wofull funerall inglys thai Circulyt abowt on horsbak in array, With gowlyng and with vocis myserabill; Quhill that of trigland terys lamentabill The feildis strowyt war in euery place, Armouris all wet with wepyng, and thar face. The clamour of the men and trumpys stevyn Gan spryngyng vp on hight onto the hevyn. Syne cumis sum, and in the fyre dyd slyng The weirly wedis, spul?e and armyng Rent from the Latynys slane into the weir, As helmys, scheildis, and rych swerdis seir, Brydillys, and all thir stedis trappouris fair, The hasty hurland charyot quhelys squair; Ane other sum kest in the fyre syk geir As weilbekend the corps was wont to weir, Thar awyn wapynnys, and thar onsilly scheildis, Quhilk mycht thame nocht defend into the feildis.

Quhy quakis thus our membris vp and dovn, Befor the bludy blast and trumpis sovn? For tyme, feill syss, and eik the variant chance Of our onstabill lyfe hung in ballance, Reducit hess full mony onlykly thyng To bettir fyne than was thar begynnyng; And fortoun interchangabill with blenkis quent Full mony ane dissauyt hess and schent, Syne efter in a thraw, this weill I wait, Restoryt thame agane to thar ferm stait.

Quhill thai thus at gret altricatioun wer Amangis thame self in dowtsum thingis seir, Eneas all his ost and haill army Hess rasyt, trumpyng to the town in hy. A messynger com ruschand in with haist, Amyd the rowtis ran as he war chaist, That with huge rumour and a feirfull dyn Fillit onon the kyngis riall in, And with gret dreid the cite stuffit alquhar; Schawand quhou that thar fays cummyn war In plane batale arrayt, to conclud, The Troiane barnage from Tibir the flude, With ordinance of Tuscan, that dyd spreid In forfront al the large feildis on breid. Onon the pepillis hartis effrayt wer, And commonys breistis proplexit all for feir; In sum, the greif and ire dyd fast habund, Rasyt with brethfull stangis full onsond, And with a felloun dreid all on steir Thai hynt to harnes, and cryis eftir thar ger: “Harness, harnes,” all the ?ong cite?anys With fellon brute and noys schowtis atanys; The febill and agyt faderis wobegone Can pleyn and weip with mony a petuus grone. In euery part the gret clamour and cryis In diuerss opinionys rayss vp to the skyis— Nane other wyss than as sum tyme we knaw The flycht of byrdis fordynnys the thik schaw, Or than the rawk vocit swannys in a rabill, Sondand and swouchand with noys lamentabill Endlang the bemand stankis and stremys cleir Of Padusa, sa full of fyschis seir. Turnus, that fand hys tyme sa oportune, Now baldly says he: “Cite?anys, haue doyn; Do call ?our consale, takis avysment, Sittand at eyss ilkane say his entent, Carpys of paix, and ruyss it now, lat se, Quhen that thai ?onder invadis ?our cuntre, ?our mortale fays enarmyt ?ou to assaill.” Na mar he said, but startis vp sans faill, And of the cheif palyce ischit furth in hy, Thus carpand to the noblys stud hym by: “Go tyte, Volusus, to the banereris Of the Volscanys, and thame that standartis beris; Charge thame thar ensen?eis forto rayss on hycht, And in thar armour adress thar men to fyght: And ?he, Mesapus, Coras, and ?our broder, The horsmen all enarmyt, ane and other, Convoys furth onto the feildis braid.

Sum tho, thar cite entre forto kepe, Befor the portis delvis trynschis deip; Sum to the ?ettis weltis weghty stonys, And sum gret iestis and sillys for the nonys; The bass trumpet with a bludy sovn The syng of batell blew our all the tovn. The wallis than thai stuffit rownd abowt With diuerss sortis of mony syndry rowt, Baith wifis, barnys, childer, men and page (Na kynd of stait was sparit tho, nor age); The heyast poynt and lattir resistens Callit euery wight to laubour and defens. The queyn also, Amata, furth can hald Onto the tempill and Pallas souerane hald, Born in hir char, and walkyng hir abowt Of matronys and nobil wemen a rowt; Offerandis and gyftis brocht with hir scho had; Nixt hand hir went Lavynia the maid, The causs of all this harm and wofull teyn, That dovn for schame dyd cast hyr lusty eyn. The matronys entris in the goddis presens, And smokis the tempill with sweit vapour and sens, And reuthful vocis warpis lovd on hie. Alssone as thai attenyt the entre, “O thou,” said thai, “Pallas armipotent, Tritonia clepit, maid, and president Of batale and of weris eueryone, With thy virginal handis breke onon ?on Troiane revaris wapynnys and his speir; Hym self als tyte dovn to the grund thou ber, Vndre our portis and our wallis hie Down warp hym ded, that we that sycht may se.” Heir Turnus and Camylla gan devyss Practikis of weir, the Troianys to suppryss.

And, as he bradis furth apon the bent, The maid Camylla cumis hym agane, Accumpaneit with hir ostis Volscane. Befor the portis dovn lyghtis the queyn, Quham all the rowt hess followyt bedeyn, Discendand from thar horssis esely; Syne on sic wyss this lady spak in hy: “Turnus,” says sche, “gif ony hardy wight May traste or assur in thar awyn mycht, I vndertak, and dar promyss, allane To mach in feild the ostis Eneadane, And baldly dar recuntir in melle All the horsmen of the Tuscane men?e.

Bot this Metabus, quhen that he dyd se The gret press of hys fays cum sa neir, Na langar duelt, bot swam throu the ryver; And cummyn to hys purposs blyth and glaid, The speir onon, sa buklyt with the maid, In presand onto the thrynfald Dyane, Furth of the gresy sward he has vp tane. Na rurall byggyngis, nor ?it na strang cite, Wald hym ressaue within thar wallys he, Nor, thocht thai wald hym to harbry haue tane, Hys fers mynd couth not subdew to nane; So that, in maner of hyrdis in pasturage, On wild montanys he wonnyt all his age; Quhar that his dochtyr, amang buskis ronk, In dern sladis and mony scroggy slonk, With mylk he nurist of the beistis wild, And with the pappys fosterit he his child Of savage stude meris in that forest; Oft tymys he thar pappys mylkit and prest Within the tendir lippys of his get. And, fra the child myght fut to erd set, And with hir solis first dyd mark the grond, With dartis keyn and hedis scharply grund Hir fystis and hir handis chargyt he; And at hir schuldir buklyt hess on hie Ane propir bow and litil arow cace; And for hir goldyn garland or hed lace In sted eik of hir syde garmont or pall, Our the schuldris fro hir nek down with all The grisly tygrys skyn of rent dyd hyng. The self tyme ?it sche bot tendir ?onglyng Thir dartis and the takillis swyft leit glyde; And oft abowt hir hed the ilk tyde Wald warp the stryngis of the stowt staf slyng, Quhar with feill syss to grund ded wald scho dyng The cran of Trace, or than the quhite swan. For nocht scho was desirit with mony a man, And moderis feill throu the townys Tuscane Desirit hir thar gud douchter, invane; For scho only, full ferm in hir entent, Of Diane, goddes of chastyte, stud content, And list to hant evyr in woddis with me The dartis schutyng, and love virginyte, Remanand incorrupt and a cleyn maid. I wald, forsuyth, at this tyme scho abaid, And had not hastit to sic chevalry, Forto molest the Troianys stowt army; Bot that ane of my ferys scho suld be, As scho that is at all tyme deir to me. Haue done onon, thou nymphe Opys,” scho said, “With wikkyt fatis sen bestad is ?on maid, Thou slyde down from the hevyn, and that inhy; The Latyn feildis thou vissy and aspy, Quhar, in the wofull batale and melle, To ane onhappy chance betaucht is sche.

My self thar eftir the reuthfull corps in hy Amyd a boyss clowd sall cary away, Onspul?eit of hir armour or array, And hir bygrave, reducit to hir cuntre, In sepultur full gloryus,” said sche. Than Opys lyghtly of the hevynnys glad, Throw owt the skyis sowchand fast doun slaid, Persand the ayr with body all ourschrowd And dekkyt in a watry sabill clowd. Quhou that Eneas with hys haill power Towart the cyte wallys drawis neir. Dvryng this quhile, the Troiane power all Approchys fast towart the cite wall, The Tuscane dukis and horsmen rowtis alhaill Arrayt in batale, euery ward and staill, Our all the planys brays the stampand stedis, Full gal?art in thar bardis and weyrly wedis, Apon thar strait born brydillis brankand fast, Now thrympand heir, now thar, thar hedis can cast: The large grond worth grysly onto se Of steill wapynnys and scharp speir hedis hie; And as the fyre all byrnand schayn the feildis Of brycht armour, heich helmys, and braid scheildis. Aganyst thame alsso onon apperys The bald Mesapus, val?eant in werys; The agill Latyn pepill with hym was, And duke Catyllus, with his brother Coras, And eik the weyng of Wolscane pepill in feild With the stowt wench Camylla vnder scheild; And furth thai streik thar lang speris weill far, Drew in thar armys with schaftis chargit on far, Tasyt vp dartis, taclys and fleand flanys; The contyr or first tocome for the nanys Full ardent wolx, and awfull forto se, The men byrnand to ioyn in the melle, And furour grew of stedis sterand on stray. Now thai, approchyng sammyn in array Within ane arow schot on athyr syde, Syne maid a litill stop, and still dyd byde; Rasyt vp a schowt, bad on thame with a cry, Quhil bruyt and clamour fordynnyt the sky. Thar fers stedis dyd for the bargane cheir; On athir half thai mak a weirlike feir; And tharwithall at anys on every sydis The dartis thik and fleand takyllys glydis, As doith the schour of snaw, and with thar flycht Dyrknyt the hevynnys and the skyis lyght. Tyrrhenus tho, ane of the Tuscane rowt, And Acontevs, a Rutilyane full stowt, Togidder semblyt with thar speris ran, To preif the first fall sammyn, man for man. Thai meit in melle with a felloun rak, Quhil schaftis al to schuldris with a crak; Togiddir duschis the stowt stedis atanys, That athyris contyr fruschyt otheris banys. And Aconteus, lyke to the thundris blast, Smyte from hys sadill a far way was cast, Or lyke a stayn warpyt from the engyne, That altofruschit dovn he dyd declyne, With sik rebund and rewyne wonder sair That he his lyfe hes sparpellit in the ayr. All suddanly the Latynys tuke affray And gaue the bak bedeyn, and fled away, Thar scheldis our thar schuldris kest behynd, And to the tovn spurris als ferss as wynd. The Troianys dyd persewyng on the chayss, And fast invadis thame Prynce Asyllas. Quhen thai approchyng to the portis neir, The Latyn pepill returnys all infeir, Thar weill dantit horss nekkis quhelit abowt, Syne gaue a cry, and on thame with a schowt: The tother party than hess tane the flight, Leit ga the brydill, and fled in all thar mycht. Lyke as the flowand sey with fludis rude Now ruschis to the land, as it war woyd, And on the skelleys at the costis bay Vpswakkis fast the fomy wallys gray, And with his iawpys coverys in and owt The far sandis our the bay abowt; Now with swyft fard gois ebband fast abak, That with hys bulrand iaschis and owt swak With hym he sowkis and drawys mony stayn, And levis the strandis schald and sandis plane— The Tuscane folk the Latynys on sik wyss Onto the cite wallys chasyt twyss; And twyss thar self dyd fle and gif the bak, With scheldis at defens behynd thame swak. Bot tharefter the thryd assay thai mak, The ostis sammyn ionyt with a crak, That euery man hess chosyn hym his feir. And than, forsuyth, the granys men mycht heir Of thame that stervyn and dovn bettyn beyn, That armour, wapynnys, and ded corpss bedeyn, And stedis throwand on the grond that weltis, Mydlit with men quhilk ?eld the gaste and sweltis, Bedowyn lay full deip in thar awyn blude. The stowr encressis furyus and woyd. Orsilochus, a Troiane, with all his forss Dressis his lans at ane Remulus horss, For hym to meit he stude a maner feir; The hed remanyt vnder the horssis eyr, The steid enragit for the cruell dynt, And lansys vp on hycht als fers as flynt, As he that was inpacient of hys wond, That Remulus down weltis on the grond. Catillus, ane of the brethir Tyberyne, Iollas down bet, and thareftir syne The gret Hermynyus, wondir byg of corps, Bot far byggar of curage and of fors; Quhais hed and schuldris nakyt war and bar, And on his crovn bot lokrand ?allow hair; And thocht he nakyt was, and voyd of geir, Na wond nor wapyn mycht hym anys effer; Forgane the speris so bustuus blomyt he, That this Catillus stalwart schaft of tre Throw gyrdis baith hys stalwart schulder banys, And with the dynt stud schakand all at anys, Transfixit so, and persand euery part, It dowblis and renewys the manis smart. The blaknyt dedly blude on athir syde Furth ruschis owt of warkand wondis wyde; The swerdis baithit wolx in bargane red; Feill corpsis kyllit in the feild fell ded, And caucht a douchty end to swelt in fycht, By hurtis feill forto manteym thar rycht. Quhou Camylla hir fays doun can dyng, And venquyst Awnus, for all his fair flechyng. The awfull maid Camylla the ilk tyde, With cace of arrowis tachit by hyr syde, Amyd the slauchter and melle apon hyr foyn Prowdly pransys lyke a wench Ama?on, That, forto hant the bargane or assay, Hyr rycht pap had cut and brynt away. And now the sowpill schaftis baldly sche On ather sydis thik sparpellis and leit fle; Now, not irkyt in batale stith to stand, Ane stalwart ax scho hyntis in hir hand; Apon hir schulder the giltyn bow Turcas, With Dyanys arowys clatterand in hyr cayss. And gif that so betyd into that fight Hyr ferys gave the bak and tuke the flycht, Into the chaiss oft wald scho turn agane, And, fleand, with hir bow schuyt mony a flane. Abowt hir went hir walit stalwart feris, The maid Laryna and Tulla ?ong of ?heris, And Tarpeia, that stowtly turnys and swax With the weil stelit and braid billit ax; Italyanys born; quham the nobil Camylla Had to hir lovyng and honour deput swa, Tobeyn hir servandis in ganand tyme of paix, And in batale to stand by hir in press. Lyke as of Trace the wenchis Ama?onys Dyndillis the flude Thermodoon for the nonys, As in thar payntit armour do thai fycht, Owder abowt Hippolita the wight, Or by the weirlyk maid Penthesile, Rolland hir cart of weir to the melle; The wemen rowtis baldly to the assay, With felloun bruyt, gret revery and deray, Furth haldis sammyn our the feldis sone, With crukyt scheldis schapyn like the moyn. O thou stern maid Camylla, quhat sal I say? Quham first, quham last, thou smait to erth that day? Or quhou feil corpsis in the batale sted Thou laid to grond, ourthrew and put to ded? With the formast, Ewmenyus, that was one Son to Clysius; quhais braid breist bone With a lang stalwart speir of the fyre tre Throw smyttyn tyte and persyt sone hes sche; He cavis owr, furthbokand stremys of blude, And with his teith eik, schortly to conclude, The bludy erd he bait; and, as he sweltis, Apon hys wond oft writhis, tumlys and weltis. Abuf this nixt scho ekis other two, Lyris, and ane Pegasyus alsso, Of quham the tane, that is to say, Lyris, As that he fordward stowpand was, I wys, To hynt hys horssis reyn that gan to fundir, And the tother present, to kep hym vndir, Furth straucht his febill arm to stynt his fall, To grund togidder ruschit ane and all. And to thir syne the son of Hyppotes, Amastrus hait, ded scho adionyt in press; And lenand fordwart on hir lance of tre, Terreas and Harpalicus chasys sche, Persewand eik full bustuusly onon The bold Chromys, and strang Demophon: Quhou feill dartis with hir hand kest this maid, Alsmony Troianys ded to grund scho laid. Ane Ornytus, ane huntar, far on raw, In armour and in cognycens onknaw, Raid on a curser of Apul?e throu the feild; Hys braid schuldris weill cled war and ourheld With a ?ong bullis hyde newly of hynt; Hys hed coverit, to salf hym fro the dynt, Was with ane hydduus wolfis gapand iowis, With chaftis braid, quhyte teith and bustuus powis. To mak debait, he held intill his hand A rural club or culmas in sted of brand; And, quhar he went, amyd the rowtis on hie Abuf thame all his hail hed men myght se. Camylla hym at myscheif hess on set, Scho bair hym throw, and to the grund dovn bet; Nor na gret curage, forsuyth, was that, na mycht, For all his rowt tofor had tane the flycht. Bot forthir eik this forsaid Camylla, With mynd onfrendly, can thir wordis sa: “Thow Tyrrheyn fallow, quhat, wenyt thou tobe In woddis chasand the wild deir?” quod sche. “The day is cummyn that ?our prowd wordis hait A womanis wapyn sal resist and debait. And, not the less, na litill renowne From thens thou sal do turss away with the, And to our faderis gostis blythly schaw That with Camyllais glave thou art ourthraw.” Incontinent this madyn eftir thys Slew Orsilochus, and ane that hait Butys, Twa biggast men of body and of banys Of all the ost and fallowschip Troianys. Bot this ilk Butys, standand hir befor, Outthrou the nek dyd scho perss and bor, Betwix the hawbrig and the helm inhy, Quhar that his halss scho dyd nakyt aspy; For our his left schulder hang his scheld. Bot this Orsilochus fled hir in the feild, And gan to trump with mony a turnyng went; In circulis wyde scho drave hym our the bent, With mony a curss and iowk, abowt, abowt; Quhar euer he fled scho followis in and owt; And at the last scho hess ourtak the man, And throw hys armour all, and his harn pan, Hir braid poll ax, rasyt so on hie, With all hir forss and mycht syne strykis sche; As he besocht for grace with gret request, Scho dowblit on hir dyntis, and so hym prest, With feil wondis his hed hass tort and rent; Hys harnys hait our all his vissage went. Than Awnus son, quhilk also Awnus hait, On cace betyd approche in the debait Towart this maid, and, alsone he hir saw, Abasyt huvis still for dreid and aw: Into the mont Appennynus dwelt he, Amang Liguriane pepill of his cuntre; And not, forsuyth, the lakest weriour, Bot forsy man, and rycht stalwart in stour, So lang as fatis sufferit hym in fycht To excerss prettykis, iuperty or slycht. This Awnus, fra that weil persavit he Na way to fle nor eschew the melle Nor mycht eschaip the queyn stude him agane, Than he begouth assay hir with a trayn, And with a sle dissait thus first he said: “Quhat honour is till a stowt wench or maid Fortill assur and trast in a strang horss? Leif thy swyft steid, and traste in thyne awyn forss; At nane avantage, quhen thou lyst to fle, Lyght on this plane, and hand for hand with me Address ws to debait on fut allone: Thar sall thou se, thar sall thou knaw onon, Quhamto this wyndy glor, voust, or avantis, The honor or, with payn, the lovyng grantis.” Thus said he, bot scho than als hait as fyre, Aggrevit sor, inflambit in felloun ire, Alycht, and to hir mait the horss betaucht; At his desyre onon on fut vpstraucht, With equale armour bodyn wondir lycht, The drawyn suerd in hand that schane full brycht, And onabasyt abaid hym in the feild, Abyl?eit only bot with a quhite scheild. The ?ong man, wenyng with his sle dissait He had begilit hir be his consait, Abowt his bridill turnyt but mar delay And at the flycht sprent furth and brak away, And feil syss leit the horss sydis feill The scharp irne spurris prik apon his heill. “O,” quod the maid, “thou fals Liguriane, Our wanton in thy prowd mynd, all invayn; O variant man, for nocht perfay,” quod sche, “Hess thou assayt thy cuntre craftis sle! Dissaitfull wight, forsuyth I to the say, Thy slycht and wylis sal the nocht beir away, Nor haylscarth hyne do turss the hame fra ws Onto thy faderis howss, the fals Awnus.” Thus said the wench onto this other syre, And furth scho sprent as spark of gleid or fyre; With spedy fut so swyftly rynnys sche, By passyt the horssis renk, and furth can fle Befor hym in the feild with gret disdeyn, And claucht onon the curser by the reyn; Syne set apon hym baldly, quhar scho stude, And hir revengit of hir fays blude— Als lychtly as the happy goishalk, we se, From the hycht of a rokis pynnakill hie With swyft weyngis persewis wonder sair The silly dow heich vp into the ayr, Quham finaly he clippis at the last, And lowkyt in his punsys sarris fast, Thristand his tallans sa throu hir entralis Quhill at the blude abundantly furth ralys; And, with hir beik deplumand, on al sydis The lycht downys vp to the skyis glidis. Tarchon, gret chiftane of the Tuscan ost, The fleand folkis to turn agane can bost. The fader of goddis and men with diligent eyn Hass all hir dedis vnderstand and seyn, And, situat in his hevynly houss on hie, Inducis and commovis to the melle Tarchon, of Tuscanys pryncipall lord and syre, In breithfull stoundis rasyt brym as fyre; So that amyd the ful myschewoss fyght, The gret slauchter and rowtis takand the flycht, On horsbak in this Tarchon baldly draw, Wilfull his pepill to support and saw; The wardis all of euery natioun With admonitions seir and exhortatioun And diuerss wordis tystis to feght, for schame, Clepand and calland ilk man be his name, Quhill thai that drevyn war abak and chaste Relevys agane to the bargane in haist. “O Tuscane pepill, quhou happynnys this,” said he, “That ?he sal evir sa doillyt and bowbartis be Onwrokyn sik iniurys to suffir heir? O, quhat be this? Quhou gret a dreid and feir, Quhou huge dolfnes and schaymful cowardice Hes ombeset ?our myndis, apon sik wyss That a woman allon, and thus belyve, Apon sik wyss sal scattir ?ou and dryve, And gar sa large rowtis tak the flycht?

The Tuscanys rasyt a clamour to the sky, And Latynys all thar eyn abowt dyd wry. This Tarchon, ardent as the fyry levyn, Flaw furth swyft as a fowle vp towart hevyn, Berand with hym the armour and the man; And fra his speris poynt of brak he than The stelit hed, and syne seyrsis all artis, Euerilk entre, and all the oppyn partis, Quhar he mycht fynd into sa litil stovnd A place patent to geif hym dedis wond. And, be the contrar, Venulus full wight Maid all debait and obstakill at he mycht, And can hys hand from hys throt oftsyss chop With all hys strenth, hys violens to stop. Lyke as, sum tyme, the ?allo egill be sycht The eddir hyntis vp and careis on hyght, Syne, fleand, in hir feit stren?eis sa fast That oft hyr punsys outthrow the skyn dois thrast; Bot the serpent, wondyt and al toschent, In lowpyt thrawys wrythis with mony a sprent, Hyr sprutlyt skalys vpset grysly to se, With quhisland mouth strekand hir hed on hie; All thocht scho wreill and sprynkill, bend or skyp, Evir the sarar this ern strenys hys gryp, And with hys bowand beik rentis grewsly, Sammyn with hys weyngis soursand in the sky— Noyn othyr wyss, this Tarchon tursys hys pray Throw owt the Tyburtyn rowtis glaid and gay. The pepill Tuscane, quhilum cum fra Lyde, Seand the exempill and prosper chans that tyd Of thar stowt duke, followys hys hardyment, And with a rusch sammyn in the bargane sprent. Quhen as ane Aruns, by hys mortal fait Onto myschewos ded predestinate, Circulis at the wait, and aspyis abowt The swyft madyn Camyll, of all the rowt In honest fait of armys maist expert, And best betaucht to schute or cast a dart; He sekis by quhat ways or fortoun To fynd the fassoun and tyme oportune Maist esely this lady to assaill; And all the wentis and renkis, sans faill, This furyus maid held mydwart the melle, The sammyn gait and passage haldis he, And prevely hir futsteppys dyd espy; And quhar scho dyd return with victory, With fut bakwart frawart hir aduersar, This ilk Aruns was ful reddy thar, And thyftuusly onon the sam way he Withdrew hys payss, and held on hir hys e; Lurkand at wayt, and spyand rownd about, Now this tocome, now that onset, but dowt, At euery part thys pevech man of weyr, And schuke in hand hys oneschewabill speir. Aruns the preist slays Camylla be slycht, Syne cowartly onon takis the flycht. Per chans that tyde Choreus, of gret estait, Ane spiritual man blissyt and consecrat, That to Cybele sum tyme preist had be, A weill lang space ?ond in the melle Abil?eit rychly and full gloryus schane In pompus armour and array Phrygiane: Furth dryvys he the fomy sterand steid, With weirlyke bardis cled, and sovir weid Of coyrbul?e or leddir with gilt nalys, Cowchyt with plait of steill als thik as skalys; And he hym self, in brovne sangwane weill dycht, Abuf hys onkouth armour blomand brycht, Schaftis he schot, and takillys wrocht in Creyt, With Lycyane bow nokkyt with hornys meyt, And clattryng by hys schuldyr for the weir Hys gan?e cays and goldyn awblaster; The helm of gold schane on the prestis hed; Of safron hew, betwix ?allow and red, Was hys rych mantill, of quham the forbreist lappys, Ratlyng of brycht gold wyre, with gyltyn trappys Or cordis fyne was buklyt with a knot; Of nedill wark all brusyt was hys cote; Hys hosyng schane of wark of barbary In porturatour of subtell brusery. Thys man only of all the mekyll rowt The maid Camvlla followis fast about; Quhyddir so it was that Troiane armour shce Lyst hyng in tempill for memor of trophe, Or than desyryt this wantoun hunteress In goldyn attyre hir selwyn to address, Quhilk scho in feild byreft hyr aduersar; Throw owt the ost onwarly went alquhar, Blynd in desyre this Troiane to assay, In womanly appetyt ardent of this pray, This precyus spul?e, and array sa prowd, Quharwith, as said is, was this preist yschrowd. Thys forsaid Aruns liggyng at the wait, Seand this maid onflocht at sik estait, Chosys hys tyme that was mast oportune, And towart hir hys dart adressyt sone. With voce express hys prayer thus maid he: “O brycht Apollo, souerane god mast hie, Of haly mont Soractis the wardane, Quham pryncipaly we wirschip euery ane, Quhamto the fyry smok of sens, we se, Blesys in the kyndillit byngis of fyr tre; As we that wirschippis the with obesans, Be support of thy devoyt observans, Oft with our futsteppys and our nakyt solys Down thryngis feil hait syndris and fyry colys; Grant me, fader almychty, now I pray, With our wapynnys this schame to do away. I ask na trophe, nor the pomposs weyd Of this maid dovn bet or repulsyt in deid, Nowder byd I therof spul?e nor renovn; My other dedis syne mot mak me bovn To report honour and lawd efter this; Bot at this tyme I byd na mair, I wyss, Salf that this wench, this vengeabill pest or trake, Be bet dovn ded by my wond and smert strake, And syne that I may to my kynd cite Bot ony glor return alyve,” quod he. Phebus hym hard and grantit to fulfyll Of hys axin a party, at hys wyll; Bot for the tother part, suyth to say, He leit do waif with the swyft wynd away; Consentand that he suld doun bet and sla By hasty ded the awfull Camylla; Bot, at hys cuntre hailscarth haymwart brocht Suld se hym eftir that, he grantit nocht; And in the clowdy blastis of the sky That voce and wordis flaw away in hy. So that, als fast as from hys hand, that stond, Thirland the ayr this takill gaue a sound, The rowtis can aduert and takis tent, Turnand thar syghtis, ilk wight, with a blent Towart the queyn, thar lady, this Camyll; Bot scho nane heyd nor tent hess tane thartill, Nowder of the hasty motioun of the ayr, Nor ?it the byrrand sovnd this flycht maid thar, No ?it persavyt this awfull schaft of tre Discendand swyftly fra the hevyn on hie; Quhill that the lance hir smate and hurt, perfay, Quhar that hir pap was schorn and cut away, And weggyt deip within hir cost stude, Furth sowkis largely of this madynnys blude. Hyr complicis alsammyn in this neyd Start to thar lady in affray and dreid; And sone thai claucht and lappyt in thar armys This queyn, that funderand was for hir smart harmys. Bot fyrst of all, for feyr and fell affray, Thys Aruns fled full fast and brak away, With blythnes mydlyt havand paynfull dreid: For he na langar durst into this neyd Assur forto debait hym with hys speir, Na ?it abyd the virgynys wapyn, for feyr. And lyke as that the wild wolf in hys rage Knawand hys recent falt and gret owtrage, Quhen that he hass sum gret ?ong oxin slane, Or than weryit the nolt hyrd on the plane, Tofor hys fays with wapynnys hym persew, Onon is he to the heich mont adew, And hyd hym self full far owt of the way; Hys taill, that on hys ryg befor tymys lay, Vnder hys waym lettis fall abasytly, And to the wod can hast hym intill hy— Nane other wyss Aruns, that fleyt wight, Fled, and belyve withdrew hym owt of sycht; Content only to gyf the bak and fle, Amang the thikast press hym hyd hess he. And this Camylla, stervand the ilk stound, The schaft hass pullyt of hir dedly wound With hir awyn hand; bot ?it amang the banys The scharp steill hed fixt to the rybbys remanys In a full deip wond and a grewos sayr. All paill and bludles swarthis scho rycht thar, And in the deth closys hir cald eyn; The rudy cullour, vmquhile as purpour scheyn, Blaknyt, and fadys quyte owt of hir face; And, ?aldand vp the gost in the ilk place, Onto ane of hir damysellis and ferys, Clepyt Acca, that had beyn mony ?heris Only maste trast, and hald in speciall To Camylla abuf the otheris all, That knew alhaill the secretis of hir hart, With quham hir thochtful curys wald scho part, That tyme scho spak, and said on this maner: “Acca, Acca, my leif systyr deyr, Onto this hour I haue done at I myght; Bot now this dolorus wond so hess me dycht That all thyng dymmys and myrknys me abowt. Go fast thy way, and hy the of this rowt; Schaw Turnus thir my last commandis,” quod sche, “Byd hym entyr in fecht in sted of me, And fra the cite thir Troianys dryve away. Adew for evir!

Behald the chance of batale variabill, Persave of weir the fykkill ward onstabill: Haue reuth and mercy of thy fader ald, Quham Ardea now, hys cuntre, doys withhald, Diuidit far and disseuerit from the, And for thy saik quhou wobegone is he.” Thus said the kyng, bot the violent curage Of Turnus hie mynd bowit neuer a stage; Quha wald with cuyr of medycyne hym meyss, The moir encressys and growys hys mail eyss; And, eftir that he first mycht speke agane, Thus he began expreym with wordis plane: “O thou maist souerane fader, I the pray, To salue my honour, thou wald do away Thir curis, thochtis and solicitude For me thou takis; and, schortly to conclude, Suffir me forto plege my deth in wage, For gloryus renovn of vassillage; For we, fader, can swak dartis and brandis, Nocht with febill bot stalwart rycht handis, And of our wondis the red blude ruschis owt. To ?onder provd Troiane, clepit sa stowt, Hys moder at this tyme salbe far to seik, Quhilk goddes with hir subtell slychtis eik Hir son, accustumat to tak the flycht, Was wont to dek, and to hyde owt of sycht Within a wifly clowd, as for a trayn, And heild hir self alsso in schaddois vayn.” The queyn perswadis Turnus fra stryfe desist, Bot he for batal can agane resist. Be than the queyn Amata, all in feir Of this onkouth and new maner of weir, Wepyng full soir, all dedlyke, full of harmys, Hyr son in law Turnus hynt in hir armys, That was sa fervent in his ardent desyre. “Turnus,” said scho, “thou best belovit syre, Be thir ilk wofull terys I the pra, And be the wirschip thou aw till Amata, Gyf ony honour of hir or thy kyn Twichys or movis into thy breist within, I the beseik a thyng, myne awyn knycht; Desist and cess to mach Troianys in fight.

The hait luf trublys sor the knyght, That on this maid he fixis all hys sycht, And all the mair he byrnys in desyre Of bargane into armys, hait as fyre; Syne to the queyn Amata, but abaid, In few wordis on this wyss he said: “O my deir moder, of thy wepyng ho, I ?ow beseik, do not, do not so, Persew me not thus with ?our grete and teris, Nor quhen I pass onto thir mortall werys, In marciall bargane contrary my fo, Do wa to present me sik takyn of wo: In Turnus myghtis lyis nocht,” quod he, “The chance of deth to mak hym selvyn fre, I say, gyf deth this way be to me schaip, Now may I not astart, nor it eschape, For at this tyme instant my messynger, Idmon clepyt, my credens hecht tober Now to ?one Troiane tyrrand, rehersyng My wordis, quhilkis lykis hym na thyng, That is to knaw, to morow, als ayrly As brycht Aurora in the orient sky With rosy chariot lyftis vp hir hed, The firmament schrowdyng in cullour red, That he move not aganys Rutilyanys, Hys ostis, nor nane army of Troianys, Bot athir half fra batale, for the best, Baith sall Troianys and Rutilianys thame rest; And lat ws twa, this bargane to conclude, Betwix ws only dereyn with our blude, And into ?onder feld, in stalwart stryfe, Lat athir seik Lavinia to hys wyfe.” Fra this was said, fast to hys in he spedis, And bad onon do lat hym se hys stedis: Behaldand thame reiosys he in hart, To se thame stand sa fers with curage smart; Quhilk kynd of horss quhilum, as thai say, Orythia, the lusty fresch may, Of Athenis the kyngis douchter and ayr, As ane maste ryall presand, wonder fair, Send from hir cuntre to Kyng Pilumnus, Was forgrandschir onto this ilk Turnus; The quhilk stedis, schapyn at all delyte, Excedit far the snaw in cullour quhite; To speke of speid, thar swyftnes was ontald, For thai the wyndis blast forryn wald.

Fra thens onto hys chalmyr went he syne; Abowt his schuldris assays hys halbryk fyne, Of burnyst maill, and schynand rychely Of fynast gold and quhitly alcomy. Tharwith alsso hys swerd addressis he, Quhat way he wald it oys in the melle; Hys sovir scheld assays he alsso, And eik hys tymbret helm with crestis two; Quhilk swerd was maid onto Dawnus hys syre Be Wlcanus, the myghty god of fyre, That forgyt this blaid and temperit with hys handis, Hait glowand dyppyt in the Stigiane strandis. Syne with gret fors, enarmyt in all hys geir, Full lychtly vp he hynt hys stalwart speir, Quhilk tho amyddis the hall lenand stud Vp by a pillar huge squar and rude, Quhilum the spul?e he byreft from ane Clepyt Actor, a capitane Auruncane; The schaft he schuke and branglys lustely, Tharto with lowd voce thus can he cry: “O now thou speir, that nevir fail?eit thy deid Quhen I the callyt to my desyre in neid, Quhilum the weldit Actor, mast douchty knycht, Now the in hand withaldis Turnus wight; Now is the tyme that I maste myster the; Forto dovn bet the corps thou grant to me Of ?ondir Phrigiane, is skant half a man, That with my stalwart handis I may than Hys halbrik of hys body to arrass, Hakkyt and rent and persyt in mony place, And in the dusty puldyr heir and thar Suddill and fyle hys crispand ?allow hair, That ayr maid creyss, and curlys now sa weill, Yplet ilk nycht on the warm broch of steill, Dekkyt and donk, on hys wifly maner, Of fragrant myr and other envnctmentis seir.” With sykkyn fury rage catchyt is he, That thus he carpys till a schaft of tre; And from the vissage of this ardent syre The sparkis glydis as the hait fyre, For veray fervour of the feirfull teyn Schynys and brystis furth of baith hys eyn— Lyke as the bull, that bargane begyn wald, Gevis terribill rowstis and lowis monyfald, Or than aggrevit, bustuus and furthborn, Presys hys ire to assay with hys horn, Lenand hys spald to the stok of a tre, And with hys dynt the wynd torentis he, Or, forto mak debait apon the land, With hys hard clufe vpwarpys fast the sand. In the self tyme, na less of curage, Enee, Cled in hys moderis armour awfull to se, Scharpys hym self in furour marciall, Rasand hys greif for ardour bellicall, And ioyus wolx of weir to mak ane end By syk proffer and poyntment as was send. Syne comfortis he hys ferys dolorus, And mesyt the dreid of sad Ascanyus, Declarand thame the fatale ordinans, Thar destyne, and goddis purvians; And to the kyng of Lawrenteis, Latyn, Twychand this forsaid trety and convyne, Bad the messyngeris bair hame but delay Sovir answer, as thai desyrit alway, And of the peyss and trewys, as thai spak, Proclame articulis and lawys of contract. Iuno, knawand Turnus last day at end, To stop the bargane hass Iuturna send. Scarsly vpsprang the nixt day followyng, Scheddand the bemys of hys bryght mornyng Apon the toppis of the montanys hie, As Phebus stedis first of the deip se Rasyt thar hedis and noyss thirlys on hight, Our all the feildis blawand the cleir lyght; Quhen that the Troianys and Rutilianys The grund myssouris, evynnys, dichtis and planys, Vndir the wallys of the cheif cite, Thar as the feild and fechtyng place suldbe; Amyddis quham the harthis vp thai set, Quharon the fyris suldbe maid and bet, And to the common goddis eik bedeyn The altaris coverit with the scherald greyn.

Thydder all the Troianys wardis, by and by, And Tyrrheyn ostis ruschis hastely, Bodyn full weill in nobill armour seir; Nane otherwyss with wapynnys and with geir Arrayt for the batale all at rycht, Than thocht the fury of Mars thame callit to fycht. Amyd the thousandis swyftly throw the planys Furth sprentis lustely thir capitanys, In rich purpour arrayt and fyne gold brycht, Assaricus sonnys and Mnestheus wight, And on the tother part strang Asilas, And bald Mesapus also with hym was, Neptunus son, expert in horss dantyng. And eftir that the trumpet blew a syng, Than euery partyment bownys to thar stand, And gan thar speris stik doun in the land, Set by thar scheildis, to behald the fyne. The wemen wedois and the matronys syne, Desyrys forto se the bargane stowt, Of childyr and of commonys mony a rowt That couth na wapynnys weld, nor armour weir, With the onweldy agit folk infeir, Clam on the hight and hedis of the towris, The wallys all and howsis ryggyngis flowris; And sum abufe apon the portis hie Ascendit ar to behald the melle. Bot Iuno tho dovn from the hycht, I wyss, Of the montane that Albane clepit is Now in our days (set than this hyllys dovn Had nowder name, honour nor renovne), Scho dyd behald amyd the feildis plane Athir batellis and the ostis twane, Baith of the Troianys and the Laurenteis, And Kyng Latynus cite eik scho seys. Onon to Turnus systyr vp on hie, That clepit was Iuturna, carpys sche, Thys goddes to that haly nymphe, mastres Of wellys, stankis and rowtand stremys express, Quhilk honour Iove, the kyng of hevynnys hie, Hyr gave for the byreft virginite, Said: “O thou nymphes, wirschip of fludis cleir, That to my saul is hald maste leif and deir, Thow knawys weill, I the preferrit ay To all the otheris damysellys, perfay, Of Latyn cuntre, quhat so evir thai wer That wrangwisly ascendit or drew neir The bed onprofitabill of Iupiter mast hie; And glaidly eik haue I not stakyt the Intill a party of the hevyn alssua?

Nowder this bargane ?onder on the greyn Nor confideratioun may I se with eyn. Pass thou on, for thy deir brothir germane Gyf thou dar suffir ony mar dreidfull pane; To the this semys and pertenys,” quod sche, “Gyf that, perchans, ony bettyr may be, Or eft betyd onto ?on catyvis kend.” Scars had Iuno thir wordis brocht to end, Quhen that the nymphe Iuturna bedeyn Plente of terys furth?et from hir eyn; Hyr fair quhite breist, thar as scho dyd stand, Thryss or four tymys smait with hir awyn hand. Saturnus get, this Iuno, says: “Tha terys Na wyss to this tyme pertenys nor efferys. Hast the, gyf that thou can be ony way Withdraw thy brother from the deth away; Or than do mak the ostis baith on steir, Provok the batale, and thame move to weir, And this convyn and trety, new consave, Do brek, disturb and with the wynd bywave.

On this wyss Iuno can this nymphe exort, And left hir hail in weir and dowt, at schort, With mynd full tryst, wobegone and onsound, Full deip smyttyn with the sorowfull wound. Heir followis the sacrifyce and prayer Fyrst of Eneas, syne Kyng Latyn infeir. In the meyn tyme, the kyngis of athir rowt From thar citeis and strenthis ischis owt. Amyd a four quhelit char Latyn that thraw With huge pomp by stedis fowr was draw, Quhais haris and hys tymplis war weil dycht With ryall crown of fyne gold burnyst brycht, Quharon stud turrettis twelf, lyke bemys scheyn, As it ane rych enornament had beyn Of cleir Phebus, that was hys grandschir hald: Nixt quham furth rollyt was Prynce Turnus bald Within a twa quhelyt chariot of delyte, That drawyn was with stedis twa mylk quhyte; In athir hand held he, in feir of weir, The braid hed brangland on the ievillyng speir. The fader Eneas alsso furth withall, Of Romane lynnage the originall, Apon the tother half com thame agane, With byrnyst scheild that brycht as starris schane, And hevynly armour lemand all of lycht: Besyde hym raid Ascanyus the sweit wyght, That semyt weil, till euery manis doym, Ane other gude beleif and hope to gret Roym. Furth come the preste, quhamto accordyt mak The sacrifice of concord and contract, In vestment cleyn, for syk religioun wrocht, And a ?ong byrsyt swyne befor thame brocht, With a rowch twyntyr scheip sammyn infeir, Quhais woll or fleyce was neuer clyp with scheir; The bestis furth hess tursyt this ilke syre Onto the altar blesand of hait fyre.

With drawyn swerd syne the reuthfull Enee Hys orison furth maid, and thus he said: “O thou brycht son, with thy scheyn bemys glaid, Be wytnes now till my behest, I pray; And this ilk grund mot testyfy quhat I say, For quham sa gret payn and aduersyte I sufferit haue feill syth on land and see; And thou almychty Iove heir my prayer; Saturnus douchtir, thou hys spowss sa deir, Now mor benyng than thou was of befor, Sweit goddess, heir me now, I the implor; And gentill Mars now takis tent heirtill, That withhaldis and writhis at thy will Every batale, stryfe, weirfar or debait Vndyr thy hie power deificait; All fludys I call, fontanys and stremys cleir, And all maner of reuerend goddis seir Abuf the hevyn ydred and starrit sky; And ?ow eik, blissyt wightis, I testify, That vnder erth or law in hell doun beyn, Or in the fomy seis stremys greyn: Gif so betyd, that fallys the victory To Turnus on the Ausonyan party, It is conuenient, and we grant to fle, As venquyst folk, till Evandrus cite; Ascanyus sall als tyte thir feildis withdraw, Nor Eneadanys neuer, from the ilk thraw, Aganyst ?ou sall rebell nor move weir, Ne with na wapynnys eft thys cuntre deir.

Suffir my Troianys than, as we ar bovn, For me to beild a strenth and wallyt tovn, And to this cite, quhar we sall duell at hame, Lat the madyn Lavinia gif the name.” Thus first Eneas said, and efter syne Apon this wyss hym followys Kyng Latyn, Behaldand towart hevyn quhar he dyd stand, And to the starnys vphevyis hys rycht hand: “By this ilk erth, seys and starnys hie, I sweir inlike wyss onto ?ou, Enee, And by Latoneis byrth, or twynnys twa, The brycht Apollo, and chast Diana, And by the dowbill frontit Ianus, and all The pyssans of the goddis infernal, And by the dyrk sanctuary, blak as sabill, Of grevoss Pluto, that god revengeabill: The hie fader abuf mot heir my cry, That dois with thundir sik concord ratify.

And onto this opinioun the ilk thraw Helpit mekill, that with still payss so slaw This Turnus musand towart the altar past, And it lawly adournyt with face doun cast, With chekis walxin leyn, to thar semyng, Quharon the soft berd newly dyd furth spryng, As all to ?yng with sic ane till haue daill, Thai thocht hys vissage all becummyn paill.

Full grewos grew the bargane in all stedis: Sum ran to the wyn flacconys for gret ire, And sum hynt vp the furnace full of fyre. The kyng hym self, Latinus, for the affray, Fled to the cite, and tursyt with hym away Hys goddis and hys mawmontis, drevyn abak With a schamefull rebute and mekill lak, Left the concord ondone, not brocht till end. Sum brydillys stedis and cartis vp dyd bend, And sum in haist with a lowp or a swak Thame self vpcastis on the horsys bak, And war all reddy in the stowr at hand With drawyn swerd and nakit burnyst brand. Mesapus, full desyrus in the press Fortill confund the trety and the pess, A kyng Tyrreyn, Aulestes, in that sted With kyngis ensen?eis and with crown on hed, Affrays sor, at hym dryvand hys steid; The tother drew away for feir and dreid, And bakwartis fallys on hys schuldris and crovn, Onhappely, apon ane altar dovn, Quhilk stud percace behynd hym on the land. Mesapus than, full ferss, with speir in hand Apon hym drave, thocht he besocht hym fair, And with this schaft, that was als rude and squar As it had beyn a cabyr or a spar, Dovn from hys stowt cursor, na thyng skar, Smait hym a grewoss wond and dedly byt, And syne thir wordis said: “Ha, art thou hyt? Ha, that thou hass! This is, be myne avyss, To our gret goddis mair ganand sacrifyss.” Italianys hurlys on hym in a floyt, Spul?eit hys corps, hys membris ?it all hoyt. Chorineus tho, that was a stowt Troian, To meit ane Ebusus, com hym agan, That wald haue smyt hym with a bustuus dynt, And on ane altar a byrnand schide hass hynt, And gan it rycht amyd hys vissage stair, That blesyt vp hys lang berd of hair, Quhilk, scaldit thus, a strang fleur dyd cast. And forthir this Chorineus alsso fast Ruschit on hys fa, thus fyrefangit and onsaucht, And with hys left hand by the hair hym claucht, Syne with hys kne hym possit with sic a plat That on the erd he spaldit hym all flat, And with hys styf stok swerd in sik estait Throu baith the sydis at the first dynt hym smait. And Podalirius with drawyn swerd list not cess Alsus the hyrd to persew throu the press, Quhilk ruschis abak for feir, hys life to save, In the vangart, throw mony a poyntit glave; Bot quhen he saw his fa sa neir invaid That he na wyss mycht eschew nor evaid, Vphesit he hys braid ax rude and squair, And akwartly strake at hys aduersar, Quhilk from amyd hys forhed, neir hys crovn, Onto hys chyn the egge dyd carvyn doun, That far onbreid hys armour, quhar he stude, Was all bysprent and blandit full of blude. Tho Podalirius the hard rest dyd oppress, Or cald and irny sleip of dethis stress, And vp the breith he ?ald into thar sycht, With eyn closyt in euerlestand nycht. Enee sair wondyt of the feild dyd pass, In quhais absens Turnus mair cruell wass. Than the reuthfull and pacient Eneas, Behaldand quhou all wrang the gem dyd pas, Hys rycht hand onenarmyt to stynt thar fed, Furth strekis and oncoverit hess hys hed, And cryis and clepis on his pepill tho: “My frendis deir, quhidder now hurll ?e so, Ilkane aganys other? Quhou may this be? Quhat hess movit this hasty discord?” quod he, “O, stanch ?our wraith for schame, or all is lorn! The payce and concord now is twichit and sworn, And the articulis and the lawys dyng Appunctit vp, and promist euery thing. Of det and ryght I aucht apon this land Allane Turnus recontyr, hand for hand: Suffir me perform my dereyn by and by, And do away all dreid and villany. I sall with my hand sone make ferm and stabill Our appoyntment, for evir onvariabill, For this ilke sacrifice violate in this sted Sall rendir onon Turnus to me ded.” Amyd sic sawys, as he thir wordis said Forto asswage thar mynd, but mar abaid A quhirrand arrow, lo, with fedderit flycht At swift randon dyd in hys the bayn lycht, Oncertane fra quhat hand that it was sent, Quhat kynd of schote, nor of quhat instrument. The hie glory of sa notabill a deid Is hyd, that nane knew quha it dyd but dreid, Nor wist quha wrocht had to the Rutilianys Sa gret wirschip and lovyng for the nanys; Quhidder it betyd on cace and aventur, Or of sum god be dispositioun suyr; Nor nevir person eftir, he nor he, Dyd hym avant he wondit had Ene. Quhen Turnus all the chiftanys trublit saw, And Eneas sair wondit hym withdraw, Than, for this hasty hope als hait as fyre, To mell in feght he caucht ardent desyre; He askis horss and harnes baith atanys, And haltandly in hys cart for the nanys He skippis vp and musturis wantonly, Furth sprentand throu the feildis by and by, And at his will, quharso hym list tobe, With hys awyn hand the ren?eis rewlis he; And dryvand furth thus into his ire Laid feill corpsis ded and mony bald syre, Down strowand eik vnder fut in the plane Diuerss otheris ?it throwand and half slane: Owder with his cart the rowtis he drave away, Or, as thai tuke the flycht for gret affray, Castyng speris and dartis scharp hynt he, And leit thame thik amang his fays fle. Sik wyss as bludy armipotent god Mars, Besyde hys frosty flude Hebrum in Trass, Full hastely bownand to batale feild, Makis gret bruyt and clatteryng with hys scheild, Quhen he list movyng weir mast chevalrus; Furth steris hys stedis, ferss and furyus, Quhilk fleys furth sa swith with mony a stend Owtour the planys at large quhar thai wend, That thai forryn and goys befor alway ?ephyrus and Nothus, swyftest wyndis tway; And, with the dyn of thar feyt and hys cart, All Trace gronys onto the ferthar part; Abowt hym walkis, as hys godly feris, Dreid with paill face, Debait, and mortale Weris, The Wraith, and Ire, and eik fraudfull Dissait, Lyggyng vndir covert at enbuschment or await— Turnus siclike, als chery, prowd and lycht Amyd the batale catchys to the fycht Hys stedys, rekand of swete quhar thai raid, And sa baldly hys fays dyd invaid, With sik slauchter, that piete was to se; And sik deray hass maid in the melle, That hys swift stedis hovys, quhar thai went, Spangit vp the bludy sparkis our the bent, Quhil blude and brane, in abudans furth sched, Mydlit with sand vndir horss feit was tred. For he, or now, hess doun bet Sthelenus, And kyllit eik Thamyrys and Polus (The formast twa he slew machit at hand, And this Polus, as he far of dyd stand); On far eik slew he of Imbrasyus The sonnys twa, Glawcus and Iasus, Quham this Imbrasyus fosterit had, baith twa, Into the far cuntre of Lycia, And thame instrukit had full equaly In fait of armys, and to hant chevelry, Owder till assaill befor, or ?it behynd, Or with swift horss fortill forryn the wynd. ?ond, in ane other part, amyd the feild The ferss Eumedes walkis vnder scheild, Quhilk was the son and air, as that thai tell, Of agit Dolon val?eant in batell: The name he bair of hys forgrandschir wight, Bot the strang handis and stowt curage in fight Of hys awyn fader, this Dolon, he bair; Quhilk at Troy vmquhile, as the sege lay thar, And was of sa stowt curage and hie will That he durst ask the chariot of Achill To his reward, for that he sa baldly The Grekis tentis tuk on hand to aspy; Bot the son of Tedeus, Diomed, Ane other fasson hess hym quyt his meid For sa stowt ondyrtakyn, and hym slewch; And ?it for all his renovn, provit eneuch, Ne durst anys pretend, for all hys dedys, That he was worthy to weld Achillys stedys. Bot to our purposs: this forsaid Eumedes As Turnus dyd behald ?ond in the press, On the plane feld thar as he dyd ryde, First weill a far way at hym leyt he glyde A fleand dart; and furth with that, rycht thar, Gan stynt hys horssis and his quhirland char, And ferely dyd lepyng from hys cart, And sone apon hys aduersar astart, Quhilk tho was fall to grond, and half deill ded; Syne with hys fut doun thryst in the ilk sted Hys fair nek bayn, and owt of hys rycht hand Richt austernly hass he thrawyn the brand, Quhilk schynand brycht into hys throte he wet, And tharto ekyt thir wordys wondyr het: “O thow prowd Troian, lyggand thar at grond, Now may thou myssour the feld at thou hass fund; Lo heir the bundis, lo heir Hesperia, Quhilk thou to seik in weirfar was sa thra! Thys is the bontay tha sal bair away That dar with wapynnys or armour me assay.” To hym in feir also hass he laid With a scharp castyn hed, but mar abaid, Ane Butys, and eftyr hym ane Chloreus, Syne Sybar, Dares, and Thersilocus, And Thymetes, a man of full gret fors, Castyn from hys staffage, skeich and hedstrang horss. And as the blastis with thar bustuus sovn From mont Edoin in Trace cumis thuddand doun On the deip sey Egean fast at hand, Chasand the flud and wallys to athir land; And quhar the wyndis assalys, the suyth to say, The clowdis fleys fast our the hevyn away— The sammyn wyss, quhat way at Turnus went, The rowtis red hym plane rovm on the bent, And all the ostis fast abak dyd fle, For with sik forss and fard furth dryvys he, Hys bissy movand tymbrell euery art Catchis the wynd and ayr forgane hys cart. Phegeus, a Troiane, seand Turnus all mad Sa instantly assaill with strakis sad, Na langar mycht hym thoill, bot with bald hart Hym self kest in the way to meit hys cart; And he the renys in hys ryght hand hynt, Syne writhit hess about, or euer he stynt, The fomy mowthis of the hasty stedis. And as this douchty man, sa gud at nedis, Thus hang and harlyt was in euery art By the lymmouris and hamys of the cart, That he hys body mycht nocht kepe nor held, To covyr with hys armour and his scheld, The speir hym followis with scharp hed and braid, And rent hys hawbrik of dowbill plyis maid, Hurt his body sum deill, nocht fully sond, Persand the hyde, and maid a litill wond. He, nocht the less, agane hys fa furthsprent, With hys braid scheild or target evir vp stent, And in hys hand held drawyn the burnyst blaid, Cryand for help his aduersar till invaid; Quham tho (allace, gret piete was to se!) The quhirland quheill and spedy swyft extre Smate doun to grond, and on the erd lay plat; And, as he fell, Turnus followis with that, And evyn betwix the helm can hym arrass And vmast roll or hem of hys curass, Smait of his hed clenly with hys brand, And left the corps lyke a stok in the sand. Na mannys cuyr nor craft of surrurgyne Mycht heill Eneas, bot Venus medycyn. And as Turnus thus in the batale sted With the ovirhand sa feil corpsis laid ded, The meyn quhil Mnestheus and traste Achates Hess led the bald Eneas of the press, Ascanyus ?yng with thame in cumpany, And to the tentis brocht hym all bludy, With steppis slaw furth stalkand all in feir, Lenand ilk payss on a lang poyntit speir. Wod wroith he worthis, for dysdene and dispyte That he ne mycht hys ferys succur als tyte. He wrythis, and enforsys tyll owt draw The schaft in brokkyn, and the hed withall: He axis help at all thar standand by, Quhat was the nerrest way and maist reddy, And bad thai suld with a scharp knyf that tyde Scheir doun the wond, and mak it large and wyde, Rype to the boddum weill, and tak gude tent To serss the hyrnys quhar that the hed was went, That thai mycht hast thame self, but mair delay, To the batale, forto stynt this effray. Now was thar than present in the press Iapis, that was son of Iasides. Abuf all otheris to the god Phebus he Was best belovyt and haldyn in dante; With quhais favour vmquhile strangly caucht, This god Appollo gladly hass hym taucht Hys craftis and hys officis, by and by, Of diuinatioun or of augury, The musik tonys to play on harp waill sle, And forto schute and lat swyft arrowis fle. Bot this Iapis, fortill prolong, perfay, Hys faderis fatis, quhilk as bedrall lay Befor hys ?et, of hys lyfe in dispar, Had levyr haue knawyn the sciens and the lair, The myght and forss of strenthy herbys fyne, And all the cunnyng of vse of medycyne, And with sik secrete craftis prevely To leid hys lyfe and tyme mair esely. Eneas standis byttyrly chidand, Lenand apon a bustuus speir in hand, Amyd gret confluens of thir childer ?yng, And eik his son Ascanyus sair wepyng; Bot he na thing hym movit at thar terys. Than this Iapis, sage and ald of ?heris, With habyt schapyn on surrugyn mak, Vprollit weill and wymplit far abak, Richt bissely with hys nait handis tway Begouth fortill exem, and till assay The wond with mony crafty medycyn, And mychty herbys taucht be god Appollyn; Bot all for nocht his travale and hys pane. Oft with hys rycht hand sersis he, invane, To rype the owtgait of the wond sa wyde, And forto seik the schaft on euery syde, With hys wynrys and grippand turcas sle To thrist the hed, and draw furth, pressis he; Bot, for na chance that evir betyd may, Wald forton dress hys hand the sovir way. Na thing avalyt hys crafty medycyne, Nor ocht hym helpys his master Appollyn. And now the grisly dreid, ay mair and mair, Our all the feildis walkis heir and thar, Nerrar drawys the perrell and effray, So that all dyrknyt wolx the cleir day Of dusty puldir in the hevyn dyd stand; The horsmen all approchis fast at hand, That dartis thik amyd the tentis fell. Wofull clamour with mony cry and ?ell Went to the skyis of ?ong men faucht in feild, And thame that swelt, sair wondit vnder scheild. Venus hys moder tho, this pane to meyss, Caucht rewth and piete of hir sonnys dyseyss, And from the wod of mont Ida in Creit Vp hess scho pullit dittam, the herb sweit, Of levis rank, rypit and wondir fair, With sprowtis, sprayngis and vanys our alquhar, As that we se on sik verdour spryngand, And on the top a purpour flour curland: Sik gresis gude beyn nowyss onknaw To the wild bestis, quhen that ony thraw Thai with the fleand arrow beyn ourtake, The hed stikand owther in syde or bak. Thiddir brocht Venus this herb (and scho was schrowd, Baith face and body, in a watry clowd), And with the herb alsso mydlit hess sche The hailsum thryfty watir wondir sle, That from hir brycht lippys scho ?et inhy; And temperis and enbalmys prevely The plastyr tharwith, strynkland all ourane The hailsum ius of herb ambrosian, And the weill smelland herb hait panaces. This ancyent surrigian, Iapes, With sik watir or ius, that he nocht knew, The wond mesys, and softnyt hes of new; And suddanly the payn vanyst als cleyn Of hys body, as thocht it had beyn Bot a dyrlyng or a litill stond; All blud stanchit and stud in the deip wond. Tharwith baith hed and schaft com owt droppand, But ony pull followyng of manis hand, That strenth and fors of new to mak debait Restoryt war onto thar ald astait. “Harnes, harnes, bryng hym hydder in hy! Quhy stand ?e sa?” Iapis gaue a cry, And with this word aganyst thar fays he Hess first thar spreit inflammyt to melle. “O Eneas,” quod he, “I mak ?ou suyr, Throw manis mycht was neuer wrocht this cuyr, Nor be na mastir craft of medycyne: Thou art not helyt by this hand of myne, Bot be sum grettar god, full weill I se, The quhilk to grettar warkis preservis the.” Eneas tho, desyrus of bargane, Hys lymmys in legharnes gold begane Claspyt full closs and dyd hym self array, Bad speid in haist, for he hatit delay; He schuke and branglit fast his speir that tyde. And eftir hys active scheild was by his syde Cowchit full meit, and on his bak full thik Seysit his curace or his fyne hawbrik, Ascanyus ?yng tendirly the ilk place, With all his harness bilappit, dyd embrace, And throw his helmys vental a litill we Hym kyssyt hass; syne on this wyss said he: “O thou my child, do lernyng, I the pray, Vertu and verray laubour till assay At me, quhilk am thy fader, as thou wait; Desyre tobe chancy and fortunate As othir pryncis, quhilkis mair happy beyn. Now sall my rycht hand thy querrell susteyn, And the defend in batale by and by, To mak the partis man of gret sen?eory. Do thou siclyke, I pray the, myne awyn page, Als fast as thou cumis to perfyte age, Ramembir heiron, and revolue in thy mynd Thy lynage, thy forbearis, and thy kynd; Exempill of prowes in the steris frendis befor, Baith fader Eneas and thyne vncle Hector.” Iuturna gydys hir brotheris cart rycht sle Frawart the batal, he suld nocht mache Enee. Quhen this was said, furth at the portis hee, Schakand in hand a gret speir, ischit he. With hym also to the feild ruschis owt Anteus, Mnestheus, and ane full thyk rowt: Alhaill the barnage flokkis furth atanys, Left voyd the tovn and strenth with wasty wanys. Than was the playn ourset, quha com behynd, With dusty stew of puldyr maid folk blynd, And, for stampyng and fell dynnyng of feyt, The erd movit and trymlyt euery streyt. Turnus, apon the party our rycht forgane, Persauyt thame thus sterand throw the plane, Thame saw also the pepill Ausonyanys, And the cald dreid for feir ran throw thar banys. First of the Latynys all, this ilke maid Iuturna thame knew, and was not glaid; Scho hard the soundis and the fell deray, And quakand fast for feir hess fled away. Bot this Eneas, full bald vndyr scheld, With all hys ost drave throw the plane feld, And with hym swyftly bryngis our the bent A rowt coill blak of the stew, quhar he went. Lyke as the bub or plaig of fell tempest, Quhen that the clowdis brekis est or west, Dryvys by fors throw the sey to the land, Doand the cayrfull husbandis vnderstand The gret myscheif tocum and felloun wraik; Quhilk, with sair hartis quakand, “Allake, allaik!” Says, “Lo, ?on bub sall stryke dovn growand treys, Doun bet our cornys, and by the ruyt vpheis, And far onbreid ourturn all doys vpstand: Hark, heir the swouch cumis brayand to the land”— On siclyke wyss this ilk chiftane Troian The corsy pasand Osyris hess slane. Mnestheus kyllyt Archet, and Achates Byhedit hass the wight Epulones; Gyas doun bet Vfens the gret captane; Dovn fell also the gret augurian, Tolumnyus him self, that the ilk day Threw the first dart hys fays till assay. Vprysis than the clamour, and a scry Quhilk semyt wend onto the starnyt sky. Thar curss abowt than the Rutilianys Hess tane the flyght, and gave the bak atanys, Skatterit throw owt the feildis heir and thar, Quhil stovr of puldir vpstrikis in the air. Bot the chiftane, this vail?eant Ene, Deden?eit nane doun bet as thai dyd fle, Ne thame invaid that met hym face for face, All thocht thai fawght with wapyn, swerd or mace; Bot throw the thikast sop of dust in hy Only Turnus went to seik and aspy, And hym allane, accordyng the tretye, He askis and requiris into melle. With dreid heirof the mynd was smyttyn so Of Iuturna, the verray virago (Quhilk term to expone, be myne avyss, Is a woman exersand a mannys offyss); Amyd the lyamys and the thetis thar Doun swakkis scho Metiscus the cartar That Turnus char had forto rewle on hand, And left hym lygand far ?ond on the land, Fra the cart lymmowris warpit a gret way; And scho in sted hyss office dyd assay. And with hir handis abowt writhis sche The flexibill renys frawart the melle, Berand the lyknes in all maner thing Of Metiscus voce, person and armyng. Als feill wrynklis and turnys can scho mak As dois the swallow with hir plumys blak, Fleand and seirsand swiftly thar and heir Our the gret lugyngis of sum myghty heir, Apon hir weyngis scummand euery syde Thir heich hallys, bene full large and wyde, Gadderand the small morcellis est and west To bair hir byrdis chepand in thar nest; Now into gowsty porchis doith scho fle, Now by the donky stankis soundis sche: In siclike wyss this Iuturna belyfe Throw owt the ostis gan the horssis dryfe, Circuland abowt with swift fard of the cart The feildis our allquhar in euery art, And schew hir bruthir Turnus in his char, Now brawland in this place, now voustand thar; Na be na way wald scho suffir that he Assembill hand for hand suld with Enee; Bot fled hym far, and frawart hym held ay, Writhand hir cartis curss ane other way. In na less haist Eneas on the bent Hys quhelys turnys and writhis mony a went; The man he seirsis throw the effrait rowtis, And on hym callis with lowd cry and hie schowtis. And als feill syss as he his eyn kest Apon his fa, al tymys he hym adrest To chass hym with swyft curss throu the melle, On horssis that semyt ryn as fowle dois fle; Bot evir als oft Iuturna ane other art Awaywart turnys and writhis hyr broderis cart. And thus Eneas remanys all on flocht In syndry motioun of ire, bot all for nocht. Allace, ne knawis he not now quhat to do: Diuerss thochtis and seir consatis, lo, Hys mynd in mony contrar purposs sent. And as he thus was trublit in entent, Mesapus, that on cace was neirhand by, And in hys left neif haldis all reddy Twa sowpill castyng speris hedit with steill, Of quham that ane full sovirly and weill Towart Ene addressit leit he glyde. Eneas hovit still the schote to abyde, Hym schrowdand vndir his armour and his scheild, Bowand hys howch, and stude a litill onheld; And, netheless, this speir, that scharply schar, Of hys basnet the tymbrell quyte doun bair, And smait away the creistit toppis hie. Than mair in greif and ire vpgrowis he, Seand hym catchit with dissait and slycht, Quhen that he hess persauyt in his sycht Turnus horssis furth drevyn ane other art, Awaywart turnyng sa feill syss his cart: Tho mony tymys lowd did he testify Gret Iupiter, quhou that sa wrangwisly He was iniurit, and constrenyt to fight; To witness drew he als with gret onrycht The altaris of confiderans violate; And now at last, full furyus and hait, The mydwart of his ennemyss dyd invaid. With prospir chance of batale, sa onglaid And terribill to his fays walxis he, That hail, but ony differans of degre, All goith to wraik, for na man list he spair: A cruell slauchter he hess rasit thar. All kynd of wreth and breithfull ire now he Leyt slyp at large, but brydill, with ren?eis fre. Heir followys of the slauchter monyfald Maid by Turnus and be Eneas bald. Quhat god sall now me techyng to endite Samony wondis and this cairfull syte, Or quha me lern in metyr to declar Sa feill and diuerss slauchteris as was thar, And gret decess of dukis in that sted, Our all the feildis strowyn lyggis ded, Quham euery ane sammyn hys curss abowt Now down bet Turnus, now Eneas stowt? O Iupiter, was it plesand to the, With sa gret motioun of crudelyte Athir pepill suld rusch on other in press, Quhilkis eftir suldbe ane in etern pess? Eneas first, that tareit not to lang, Smate ane Sucron, a Rutilian strang; A grevouss wond he hyt hym in the syde, Throw owt hys rybbys can the stif swerd glide, Persyt hys cost and breistis cundyt inhy, Thar as the fatale deth is maste hasty: This bargane first fermyt Troianys to stand, That langeir fled Turnus fra hand to hand. Tho Turnus hass rencontyrit in the press Amycus, and hys brother Diores, Quham, fra thar horssis on the grond doun bet, On fut in feild strangly he ombeset; And the formast with a lang stif speir Smate ded, and with a swerd the tother in feir, Syne baith thar hedis hakkit of in hy, And at his cart thame hyngis by and by, The blude tharfra dreipand, tursys away. The self stound Eneas at ane assay, Or ane onset, hess kyllit Tanaus, Talon also, and the stowt Cethegus; Syne, eftyr thame, he kyllyt in the press The sad and ay sorofull Onytes, Renownyt of Thebes blude, and the ofspryng Discendyng down from Echion the kyng, And of hys moder born, Peridia. This othir chiftane, Turnus, killit twa, That brethir war, and owt of Lycia send, Appollois cuntre, Troianys to defend; And efter thame ane Meneit hess he slane, A ?ong man that was born ane Archadane, That all his days evir hatit the melle, Bot all for nocht, for he most neid thus de— About the laik of Lern and fludis gray Hys craft was forto fysching euery day; A puyr cote houss he held, and buyr hym law; Rewardis of rich folkis war to hym onknaw; Hys fader eyrit and sew ane peyss of feld That he in hyregang held tobe his beild. And lyke as that the fyre war new vpbet, And in sum dry wydderit wod vpset, Baith heir and thar, at diuerss partis seir, Amyd the sovndand buskis of lawrer; Or quhar the fomy ryveris, red on spait, Hurlys doun from the month a large gait, With hydduus bruyt and felloun fard atanys, Thar as thai ryn ourflowand all the planys; Ilkane distroys, wastis and dryvis away All that thai fynd befor thame in the way— Na slawar baith this Turnus and Ene Hurlys and ruschis ferss throw the melle. Now, now, the brethfull ire and felloun thocht Within thar myndis boldynnys all on flocht, And tha breistis, can na wyss venquyst be, Now bristis full of greif and cruelte; Now lasch thai at with bludy swerdis brycht, Fortill mak wondis wyd in all thar mycht. The tane of thame, that is to know, Enee, Kyng Murranus, of anchestry mast hie, Sovndand the name of his forfaderis ald, Our all the clan of Latyn kyngis bald Observyt man by man onto his day, Furth of hys cart hess smyttyn quyt away, And bet hym doun onto the erd wyndflaucht, With a gret roik or quhirrand stane ourraucht; That this Murranus the renys and the thetis, Quharwith hys stedis ?okkit war in thretis, Vndyr the quhelis hess do weltit doun, Quhar, as he lyggis in hys mortall swoun, Of hys awyn stedis abuf hym rap for rap The sterand hufis, stampand with mony clap, Ourtreddis and doun thryngis thar master law, And gan thar lordis his estait mysknaw. And Turnus hess recontryt ane Hilo, That ruschand hurlit throw the melle tho, Full ferss of muyd and austern of curage; Bot this Turnus, for all hys vassalage, At hys gilt halffettis a grundyn dart dyd thraw, That fixit throu hys helm the schaft flaw, Persand hys brane, quhill owt bruschit the blude. Nor thy rycht hand, Creteus, sa gude, Thou forcyast Greik, cumyn from Archad land, Mycht the deliuer from this ilk Turnus brand. Nor all hys goddis Cupencus in the plane Myght defend from Ene, com hym agane, Bot at hys breist with the steill poynt is met, That thirlyt hes throu all, and hym doun bet, That nother scheild nor obstant plait of steill This catyvis breist hes helpit neuer a deill. O Eolyn, the feildis Lawrentan Hess the behald tharon dovn bet and slane, And with thy braid bak in thy rich weid The grund thou hess byspred rycht far onbreid: Thar lyis thou ded, quham Gregioun ostis in fycht Nother venquyss nor to the erth smyte mycht, Nor ferss Achilles to the grund couth bryng, That was ourquhelmar of Kyng Pryamus ryng: Heir war thy methis and thy term of ded: The houss and famyll or the nobill sted Of thy kynrent stant vndir mont Ida, In the gret cyte of Lyrnessia, Bot in the feildis of Lawrentane sul?e Thy sepultur is maid for ay tobe. Apon this wyss the ostis and wardis haill On athir part returnyt in bataill, Aganyst othir to feght sammyn attanys, All the Latynys and alhaill the Troianys; Duke Mnestheus, and the stern Serestus, And, on the tother half, Prynce Mesapus, That of gret horss the dantar clepit was, And with hym eik the stalwart Asylas, The Tyrreyn rowtis semblit all atanys, And Kyng Evandrus army Archadianys: Euery man for hym self, as he best mycht, At the vtyrrans of all hys forss gan fyght. No rest nor tary was, thai so contend, Sum to confundyng all, sum to diffend. Quhou Eneas segit the tovn agane, And Queyn Amata hir self for wo hass slayn. At this tyme, the bargane induryng thus, Eneas moder, the farest dame Venus, Into hys mynd scho hass put this entent, To hald onto the wallys incontinent, And steir hys ost the cyte till assay With hasty onset and suddane affray, At gret myscheif the Latynys to effeir, Quhilk of hys cummyng tho onwarnyt wer. And as at he held movyng to aspy Turnus throu syndry rowtis by and by, On euery syde he hass castyn hys e, And at the last behaldis the cite, Saikless of batale, fre of all syk stryfe, But payn or travale, at quyet man and wyfe. Than of a grettar bargane in hys entent All suddanly the figour dyd imprent: He callys Mnestheus and eik Sergestus, Chiftanys of hys ost, and strang Serestus, And on a lytill mote ascendit inhy, Quhar sone forgadderit all the Troian army, And thik abowt hym flokkyng can, but baid; Bot nother scheld nor wapynnys doun thai laid. And he amyddis on the knollis hight Onto thame spak thus, herand euery wight: “Heir I command no tary nor delay Be maid of my preceptis, quhat I sal say, Nor se that na man be sweir nor slaw to ryn; Till our hasty onset we wil begyn, Sen Iupiter assistis onto our syde. Now harkis quhat I purposs do this tyde: This day I sal distroy and cleyn bet doun Of Lawrent haill the cite and the tovn, Quhilk is the causs of all our werying, And quyte confund the kyng Latinus ryng, Less than thai wil ressaue the bridill at hand, Be at obeysans, and grant my command; And ?on hie turrettis, and tha toppis hie Of rekand chymnais ?ondir, as we se, I sal mak plane and equale with the grond. Quhat suld I tary or delay a stond, Abydand heir into sik plyte,” quod he, “Quhil Turnus lyst feght with ws in melle; Or quhil that he, ane other tyme agane Ourcum and venquyst into batale plane, May haue refuge to this tovn to releif, Syne efter in feild vs recontyr and greif? O cite?anys, the hed is this cite Of our weirfair, and cheif of iniquyte: Turss thiddir inhy the hait byrnand fyre brandis, And with the blesand flawmys in ?our handis Renewys and requir agane,” said he, “The trety sworn and promyst ?ou and me.” Quhen this was said, thai put thame in array, Togiddir all the cite tyll assay: Thai pyngill thraly quha mycht formest be With dowr myndys onto the wallys hie: Knyt in a sop, with gret pissans thai thrist The leddyrris to the wallys, or ony wist, And hasty fyre blesis dyd appeir. Sum otheris of the Troianys ruschit infeir Onto the portis, and the first thame met Hes kyllyt at the entre and doun bet: Sum otheris schotis dartis, takillis and flanys At thame quhilkis on the barmkyn hed remanys, That with the flycht of schaftis heir and thar Thai dyrknyt all the skyis and the air. Ene hym self with the formast can stand Vndyr the wallys, puttand to hys hand To the assalt, and with lowd voce on hie The kyng Latinus fast accusys he, Drawand the goddys to wytnes, quhou agane He is constrenyt on forss to move bargane, And quhou at the Italianys thus twyss At syndry tymys schew thame hys ennemyss, And how falsly that day thai brokyn had The secund confideratioun sworn and maid. Amang the cite?anys, into gret affray, Vpraiss discord in mony syndry way: Sum bad oncloss the cite, and als fast Warp vp the portis, and wyde the ?ettis cast To the Troianys, and thar gret prynce Ene Ressaue as for thar kyng in the cite; Otheris start to thar wapynnys and thar geir, Forto defend thar tovn in feir of weir. As we may geif a symylitude, wail lyke Quhen that the herd hess fund the beys byke, Closit vnder a dern cavern of stanys, And fillit hess full sone that litill wanys With smoik of sowr and byttir rekis stew; The beys within, affrayt all of new, Ourthwort thar hyvis and walxy tentis rynnys, With mekill dyn and bemyng in that innys, Scharpand thar stangis for ire, as thai wald fycht— Swa heir the laithly odor raiss on hycht From the fyre blesis, dyrk as ony roik, That to the ruffis toppys went the smoik; The stanys warpit in fast dyd rebund, Within the wallis rayss gret bruyt and sound, And vp the reik all void went in the air, Quhar as na tenementis stud nor howsis war. Betyd alsso to thir wery Latynys, Quhilk so irkit at sik myscheif and pyne is, Ane chance of mysfortoun, that all the tovn With womentyng straik to the boddum doun. For as the queyn Amata saw syk wyss The cyte ombeset with ennymyss, The wallys kyndlyt be with flambys heit, The fyre blesis abuf the ruffis gleyt, Na Turnus army cumand thame aganys, Nor ?it nan ostis of Rutilianys; Scho, full onhappy, in the batell sted Wenyt ?ong Turnus feghtand had bene ded; And tho for verray sorow suddanly, Hyr mynd trublit, gan to rame and cry, Scho was the causs and wyte of all this greif, Baith crop and ruyte and hed of sik myscheif; And in hir dolorus fury thus myndless, All enragit for duyll tho dyd express Full mony a thyng, and reddy to de with all Rent with hir handis hyr purpour weid ryall, And at ane hie balk teyt vp scho hass With a lowp knot a stark cord or a lass, Quharwith hir self scho spilt by schamefull ded. And fra the Latyn matronys, will of red, Persavit hess this vile myschewoss wraik, Thai rent thar hair, with, “Harrow,” and, “Allaik!” Hyr douchter first besyde the ded corps standis, Ryvand hyr gyltyn tressys with hir handis, Hyr rosy chekis to tor and scartis sche; Than all the laif, that piete was to se, Of ladeis that about the ded corps stud, Rentis and ruggis thame self as thai war wod, That of thar gowlyng, greting and deray The large hald resundis a far way, Quhill from the kyngis palyce inveroin Dywlgat went and spred our all the tovne The fey onhappy fame of sik a deid; Than euery wight tynt hart for wo and dreid. With habyt rent Kyng Latyn on the gait Walkis wobegone, astonyst of the fait Of hys deir spouss, and of the cite syne, That semyt brocht onto fynall ruyne: Hys cannos hair, sair movit in hys entent, With onclene puldyr has he all bysprent, And mony tymys hym selvyn hess accusyt, That he sa lang had lachit and reffusyt To ressaue glaidly the Troiane Ene; Repentyng sair, for weill of the cyte, That he had nocht requirit hym, and draw Or than tobe his mawche and son in law. The quenys decess fra Turnus cleirly wist, Went to the sege Eneas to resist. In the meyn tyme, as weriour vnder scheild, Turnus ?ond at the far part of the feld A few men?e persewand our the plane, Quhilk at the stragill fled in all thar mayn, Sum deill or than walxis dolf this syre, Seand his horssis begyn to sowpe and tyre; That euer the less and less ioyus was he Of thar renkis and gait throu the melle. Tharwith the wynd and sowchquhyng of the air This feirfull clamour brocht to hym rycht thar, Mixt with oncertane terrour and affeir; The confusioun of sovnd smait in his eyr, Com from the cyte, of fellon murmuryng, Rycht onglaid bruyt of cayr and womentyng. “Ha, ways me!” he said, “quhat may this be? Quhou beyn the wallys trublit of this cite With so gret duyll and sorrow as I heir? Or quhou thus ruschis so fellon noyss and beir And clamour from the tovn at euery part?” Thus hass he said, and can do stynt his cart, And all enragit tyt the ren?eis abak; Quhamto his sistir tho Iuturna spak (As scho that was turnyt, as I said air, In semlant of Metiscus the cartar, That horssis, ren?eis, sydrapis and cart dyd sche Rewle and direct amydwart the melle), With sic wordis scho ansueris hym fute hait: “Turnus, lat ws persew Troianys this gait, Quhar victory ws schawis the reddy way; Thar beyn enew otheris, be my fay, Forto defend and weill manteym the tovn. ?on is Eneas makis the brute and sovn, That can invaid Italianys, as ?e heir, Mydlit in batale on sik feir of weir. Tharfor lat ws with cruell hand in this sted Lay als feill corpsis of the Troianys ded; For with na less numbir slane vnder scheild, Nor less honour, sall thou wend of the feild.” Turnus answeris: “O thou my sistyr deir, I knew full weill at it was thou, langer, That be thi craft and quent wylis sa sle Our confideratioun trublit and trete, And entrit in this batell quhilk thou wrocht: And now, goddes, thy wylis ar all for nocht. Bot quha was that send the from hevyn so scheyn, So huge sturt and travell to susteyn? Quhidder gif thou com to that entent to se The cruell deth of thy fey brother?” said he. “Quhat sall I do, lat se, quhar sall I now? Or quhat succurss promittis fortoun, and quhou? I saw my self befor myn eyn langeir Gret Murranus, quham nane mair leif and deir Onto me was that levand is this day, Swelt on the grund, and with lowd voce, perfay, On me dyd call, quhar as he lay onsound At erth discomfyt with ane grisly wond: And lo, doun bet and slane in hys defens Is not alsso the stowt capitane Vfens, That he suld not our lak and schame behald? Hys corps and armour doys Troianys baith withhald. Sall I als suffir thame doun the cyte dyng? Of our myscheif thar restis bot that a thing. Nor sall I not with this rycht hand inhy Confund Schir Drancis langage onworthy? Sall evir this grund behald or se sik lak, That I sall fle, or Turnus gif the bak? Is it all owt sa wrachit thing to de, That, or thai stervyn, men suld rathar fle? ?he Manes, clepit goddis infernal, Beis to me frendly now, sen that all The goddis myndis abuf ar me contrar; Be ?he benevolent quhen that I cum thar. Ane haly saule to ?ou discend sall I, Saikless of all sic cryme or villany, Na wyss onworthy namyt fortobe With my eldris and forfaderis mast hie.” Scars hess he said, quhen, lo, throu the plane Ruschand amyd hys fays, com hym agane Ane Sages, montit on a fomy steid (And he was wondit sair, and gan to bleid, In the face with ane arrow vnder the e), Cryand, “Help, Turnus, be his name, quhar is he? Turnus,” quod he, “in the and thy twa handis The extreme help and lattir weilfar standis: Haue reuth and piete of thyne awin men?e. Now, as the thundris blast, faris Enee In bargane, so enragit he doith mannayss The cheif cyte of Italy doun to arrayss, And into fynal ruyne to bet doun The principall palyce and all the ryall tovn; And now onto the thak and ruffis hie The flambys and the fyre blesys doys fle. In the thar wltys, in the thar eyn, but faill, The Latyn pepill dressyt hess alhaill: The kyng hym self Latinus, the gret heir, Quhispyris and musys, and is in maner feir Quham he sal cheiss or call, into this thraw, Tobe hys douchteris spouss, and son in law, Or to quhat frendschip or allyans fyne Is best hym selwyn at this tyme inclyne. And forthirmor, Amata the fair queyn, Quhilk at all tymys thyne afald frend hass bene, With hir awyn hand doith sterve, now liggand law, And for affray hir self hess brocht of daw. Only Mesapus and Atynas keyn At the portis doys the stour susteyn: Abowt thir twa on athir syde thik standis, Arrayt rowtis, with drawyn swerdis in handis, Full horribill and austern athir barnage, Cled in steill weid with wapynnys, man and page; And thou, thus rollyng furth thy cart bedene, Walkis at avantage on the void grene.” Turnus astonyst stude dum in studeyng, Smyt with the ymage of mony diuerss thyng: Deip in hys hart boldynnys the felloun schame, All mixt with dolour, angyr and defame; Syne fervent luf hym catchit in fury rage, And hys bykend hardyment and curage. As first the schaddois of pertrublans Was dryve away, and hys rememberans The lycht of resson hass recoverit agane, The byrnand sycht of baith his eyn twane, Sor aggrevit, towart the wallis he kest, And from hys cart blent to the cyte prest. Bot lo, a sworll of fyre blesys vpthraw! Lemand towart the lyft the flambe he saw, Amang the plankis and the loftis schire Stremand and kyndland fast the hoyt fyre, That caucht was in a mekill towr of tre, Quhilk towr of sillys and gestis gret belt he, And thar vnder, to roll it, quhelis set, With staris hie and batelling weirly bet. “Now, now, systir,” quod he, “lo, all and sum The fatis hass vss venquyst and ourcum: Desist tharfor to mak me langar tary; Lat ws follow that way, and thiddir cary, Quhar God and this hard fortoun callys me. Now standis the poynt, I am determyt,” quod he, “Eneas hand for hand fortill assaill; Now standis the poynt, to suffir in bataill The bittir ded and all paynfull distress. Na langar, sistir germane, as I gess, Sall thou me se schamefull onworthy wight. Bot, I beseik the, manly as a knycht Into this fervent furour suffir me To go enragit to batale, or I de.” Thus hass he said, and from the cart inhy Apon the land he lap deliuerly, And left his sistir trist and dissolate; Thrist throu hys fays and wapynnys all, fute hait, And with sa swift fard schot throu the melle That the myd rowtis and wardis schuddris he. And like as the gret roch crag with a sovn From the top of sum montan tumlyt doun, Quhen at it is our smyt with wyndis blast, Or with the drumly schowris spait doun cast, Or than be lang process of mony ?heris Lowsyng tharfra the erd, and away weris, Is maid to fall and tumbill with all his swecht, Lyke till a wikkit hill of huge weght, Halding his fard the discens of the bra With mony skyp and stend baith to and fra, Quhill that he schut far on the plane grund, And all that he ourrekis doith confund; Woddis, heyrdis, flokkis, catale and men Our welterand with hym in the deip glen— Towart the wallys Turnus ruschit als fast Throw owt the rowtis, by hys fard doun cast, Quhar tho the grund wet and bedyit stude A weill far way with effusioun of blude, And large on breid the skyis and the ayr For schaftis schot dyd quhissilling heir and thar: A bekyn with hys hand to thame maid he, And sammyn eik with lowd voce cryis: “Lat be! Stynt, ?e Rutilianys, se ?he feght na mair, And, ?he Latynys, ?our dartys castyng spar; Quhou evir the forton standis at this tyde, The chance is myne, the fait I mon abyde. It is mair iust and equale I allane For ?ou sustene the payn was ondertane, And purge the cryme, so happynnyt now of lait, Of this confideratioun violate: Lat me stand to my chans, I tak on hand Forto derene the mater with this brand.” Than euery man amydward thame betwene Can draw abak, and maid rovm on the greyn. Eneas feghtis and Turnus, hand for hand, And Turnus fled, for he had brokkyn his brand. Thys fader than, this gret prynce Ene, Herand the name of Turnus cryit on hie, The wallys left, and fra the tovn went away Richt hastely, secludand all delay; Styntis all the wark that he begunnyn had, And hoppit vp for ioy, he was so glaid; The huslyng in his armour dyd rebund, And kest a terribill or a feirfull sound. Vpraxit hym he hess amyd the place, Als byg as Athon, the hie mont in Trace, Or heich as mont Erix in Scycily, Or than the fader of hillys in Italy, Clepyt mont Apennynus, quhen that he Doith swouch or bray with roky quhynnys hie, And ioys to streik hys snawy top on hycht Vp in the ayr amang the skyis brycht— That is to say, amang all other wightis Eneas semyt to surmontyn in hyghtis The remanent of all the mekill rowt, As thir montanys excedis the knollys abowt. And than, forsuyth, Rutilianys egyrly, And all the Troian ostis or army, Towart thar dukis dyd return thar eyn; The Rutilianys, I say, and eik bedeyn All the Latynys that on the wallys stud, And all thai als tofor as thai war woid The barmkyn law smait with the rammys fast, Now of thar schuldris can thar armour cast. The kyng hym self, Latyn, abasyt to se Twa men sa byg of huge quantite, Generit and bred in realmys far insundir Of seir partis of the warld, that it was wondir Twa of sik statur, onmysurly of hycht, Fortill assembill sammyn into fyght, Or forto se thame, matchit on the greyn, Dereyn the bargane with thar wapynnys keyn. And than athir thir campionys vndir scheild, Quhen voydit weill and rowmyt was the feild That patent was the plane a weil large space, With hasty fard on far hess tane thar rayss, And can thar speris cast, or thai cum neir, Quhil scheildis soundit and all thar other geir; Ane marcial batale thai begyn, but baid, And athir sternly dyd hys fa invaid. So dyd the strakis dyn on thar steill weid, The erd granys and dyndlys far onbreid, Syne raschit togidder with swerdis, or euer thai stynt, And rowtis thik thai doublit, dynt for dynt; With fors of prowess and fatale aventur Mydlit sammyn the bargane thai endur. Lyke as twa bustuus bullys by and by, On the hie month Taburn in Champany, Or in the mekill forest of Syla, Quhen thai assembill in austern bargane thra, With front to front, and horn for horn, attanys Ruschand togiddir with cronys and feirfull granys, That fe masteris and hyrdmen, euery wight Abasyt gevys thame place, so brym tha fight; For feir the bestis dum all standis by, And all in dowt squelys the ?ong ky, Quha salbe master of the catal all, Or quhilk of thame the bowys follow sall; Thai twa bullys, thus stryvand in that stond, By mekill forss wyrkis other mony a wond, And duschand festynnys fast thar hornys stowt, Quhill that abundans of blude stremys owt, That can do wesch, bedy, or all to baith, Thar grym nekkis and thar spaldis baith; That of thar rowstyng all the large plane And woddis rank rowtis and lowys agane— Nane other wyss Ene, the Troian heir, And Dawnus son, Turnus, sammyn infeir Hurlys togiddir with thar scheildis strang, That for gret raschis all the hevynnys rang. Thus Iupiter hym self hess atheris chance A weill lang space to hungyn in ballance Be equale myssour, and pasyt hess alsso The fatis diuerss of thame baith two; Quham the stowt laubour suld deliuer fre, And quham the pasand wecht ourwelt to de. Turnus at this tyme walxis bald and blyth, Wenyng to caucht a stound hys strenth to kyth But ony danger or aduersyte; He raxis hym, and hevis vp on hie Hys bludy sword, and smait in al hys mayn. A gret clamour gave the pepill Troian, And eik the Latynys quakyng gaue a schowt, Full prest thame tobehald stud athir rowt. Bot this ontraste fals blaid is brokyn in sundyr, And ardent Turnus brocht hess in gret blundir; For it amyddis of hys dynt hym falys, And dissolet hym left, that nocht avalys To hym hys strenth, hardyment and mycht, Less than he tak for hys defens the flycht: ?a, swyftar than the wynd he fled, I gess, Quhen that he saw hys rycht hand wapynless, And persauyt the plummet was onknaw. For so the fame is, at the ilk thraw Quhen he first ruschit in hys cart inhy, And gart do ?ok hys stedis by and by To go onto the batale the sam day, That, for the suddand onset and effray, The cartar Metiscus sword hynt in hand, And all for?et hys faderis nobill brand; And this ilk swerd was sufficient a lang space, Quhill that he followit the Troianys in the chaiss, That gaue the bak, as we haue said or this; Bot alsfast as it twichit and matchit is By dyvyn armour maid by god Wlcan, And tharon smyttyn in al Turnus mayn, This ontrew temperit blaid and fykkill brand, That forgit was bot with a mortal band, In flendris flaw, and at the first clap, As brukkill ice, in litill pecis lap, Quhill the small partis of the blaid brokin in twa As glass gletand apon the dun sand lay. Quharfor this Turnus, half myndless and brane, Socht diuerss wentis to fle throu owt the plane; With mony wyndis and turnys, all on flocht, Now heir, syne thar, onsovirly he socht. Troianys stude thik bylappit inveroun In maner of a conpass or a crovn; And on the ta half eik a laik braid Hym so inclusyt that he mycht nocht evaid, And on the tother syde fermyt als was he With the hie wallys of the cheif cyte. And thocht the wond tareis Ene sum deill, Wrocht to hym by the takill with hed of steill, To weild hys kne maid sum impediment, That he mycht nocht braid swiftly our the bent, With na less press and haist ?it, nocht for thy, He, fute for fut, persewys him fervently. Lyke as, sum tyme, quhen that the huntar stowt Betrappit hass and ombeset about With hys ralys and with hys hundis gude, The mekill hart swymmand amyd the flude, Quhilk thar inclusit neidlingis mon abyd; For he may not eschape on nother syd, For feir of hundis, and that awfull bern Baryng schaftis fedderit with plumys of the ern; The rynnyng hund dois hym assail in threte Baith with swift rayss and with hys questis grete; Bot this hart, all abasyt of thar slycht, And of the strait and stay bankis gret hycht, Can fle and eik return a thousand ways; Bot than the swypir Tuscan hund assays And nerys fast, ay reddy hym to hynt, Now, now, almaste lyke, or euer he stynt, He suld hym hynt, and, as the beste war tak, With hys wyd chaftis at hym makis a snak, The byt oft fal?eis for ocht he do mycht, And chakkis waist togiddir hys wapynnys wycht— Right so, at this tyme, apon athir syde The clamour rayss, that all the laik wyde And brays abowt thame answerd, so thai ferd, The hevyn our all eik rumlyt of ther rerd. And Turnus, fleand, sammyn fast can call Rutilianys, chidand baith ane and all, Every man clepand by hys proper name, To reke hym hys trast swerd for schame; And by the contrar, awfully Ene Can thame mannans, that nane sa bald suldbe, And schew present the deth all reddy heir To thar ondoyng, gif that ony drew neir, And quakyng for affeir maid thame agast, Schorand the cite to distroy and doun cast, Gif ony help or supple to hym schew, And, thocht he sair was, fersly dyd persew. Thus fyve tymys round intill a rayss About the feild can thai fle and chaiss, And alss feill syss went turnyng heir and thar, Lyke as befor the hund wiskis the hair. And na wondir, for sa the mater lyis, To na bowrdyng twichit thar interpryss, Na for small wagis thai debait and stryfe, Bot apon Turnus blude schedding and lyfe. On cace, amyd this feild had grow of lait Ane wild olyve to Fawnus consecrait, Quharon grew bittyr levys, and mony ?heris Was hald in wirschip with all maryneris; At the quhilk tre, quhen thai eschapit had The stormys blast, and wallis maid thame rad, Tharon thar offerandis wald affix and hyng Onto this god vmquhile of Lawrent kyng, And tharon eik the clathis bekend vpstent. Bot tho the stok of this tre doun was rent By the Troianys, mysknawand it hallowit was, To that entent to plane the batale place. Eneas byg lance or hys castyng speir Percayss apon the poynt was stykand heir; Thiddir this schaft the gret fors of his cast Had thraw the ilk stund, and thar fixit fast, Amang the grippill rutis fast haldand, Weggit full law the lance on end dyd stand. The Troiane prynce it grippis in that sted, Willyng in hand to pull owt the steill hed, With cast tharof to follow hym at the bak, Quham he throw speid of fut mycht nocht ourtak. Bot than Turnus, half mangit in effray, Cryis: “O thou Fawnus, help, help, I the pray! And thou Tellus, mast nobill god of erd, Hald fast the speris hed by ?our werd; As I that evir hass wirschipit on thir planys ?our honour, that be the contrar Eneadanys Hess violet and prophanyt be stryfe,” quod he, “With blude scheddyng, and down hewyn ?our tre.” Thus said he, and no thyng invane, I wyss, The goddys help he axit, for, at hys wyss, A full lang tyme wrelis and tareis Ene Furth of the teuch rutis of this ilk tre Hys speir to draw, and bytis on his lip; Bot festynnyt sa is in the war the gryp, That by na maner forss, thocht he was wight, Furth of the stok the schaft vp pull he mycht. And as he brymly thus inforcis fast To draw the speir, this goddess at the last, I meyn Iuturna, douchter of Dawnus kyng, Owt throu the feld com rynnand in a lyng, Changit agane, as that befor scho was, Into Metiscus semlant and lyknes, And to hir brother hess hys swerd betauch; Quhar at Dame Venus gret disden?e caucht, Sik thyng suldbe tholit this bald nymphe to do; Than suddanly to the speir rakis scho, Baith schaft and hed onon, or evir scho stent, At the first pull from the deip rute hess rent. Than athir restit and refreschit weill Baith in curage and scharp wapynnys of steill, He trastand in hys swerd that weill wald scheir, And he full prowd and stern of hys byg sper. Incontrar otheris baldly lang thai stand In marciall batale athir resistand, Ilkane full wilfull otheris till ourthraw, At sic debait that baith thai pant and blaw. Quhou Iupiter and Iuno dyd contend Eneas stryfe and Turnus fortill end. The fader almychty of the hevyn abuf, In the meyn tyme, onto Iuno his lufe, Quhilk tho down from a watry ?allow clowd Beheld the bargane therof na thing prowd, Thus spak and said: “O my deir spouss, quhat now?

Thir wikkit schrewys reddy sal ?e fynd Befor the troyn of Iove, and eik also Within the wanys of cruell Kyng Pluto.

At Eneas Turnus a stane dyd cast, Bot Eneas hass slane hym at the last. Ene with this instantly list not cess Forto recontyr Turnus in the press, And hys big speir apon hym schakis he, Quhilk semyt rude and squar as ony tre, And with a bald and bustuus breist thus spak: “Quhat menys this langsum delay ?he mak? Quhy tary ?e for schame, Turnus, all day? Quharto withdrawis thou the so away? We pyngill not for speid na curss to ryn, Bot we debait suld, this barress within, With wapynnys keyn and with our burnyst brandis, Togiddir met dereyn it with our handis.

Bot sa confundit is this douchty man That he ne knew hym selvyn in that sted, Nowder quhar that he ran, nor quhar he ?ed, Nor felt hym self liftand on the land The mekill stane, nor steir it with his hand. Hys kneis stummerit and hys lymmys slydis, The blude congelit for feir within his sydis, So at the stane he at his foman threw Fayntly throwowt the voyd and waist air flew, Ne went it all the space, as he dyd mynt, Nor, as he etlyt, perfornyst not the dynt.

Quhat evir to do by hys strenth etlyt he, Scho maid obstakill; all that ganestandis sche. Than in hys mynd becom his wittis strange And begouth forto vary and to change; And oft he dyd behald Rutilianys, And oft the cite with all that ryall wanys. He hovirris all abasyt for dreid and feir, And gan do quaik, seand at hand the speir; Ne can he fynd quhiddir away to wend, Nor on quhat wyss hym self he may defend, Nor with quhat strenth assaill hys aduersar, Nor be na ways persaue hys cart or char, Nor se hys sistir, that had hys cartar be. And as he stud on hovyr thus, Ene The fatale dedly speir in hand gan tayss, And with hys eyn markit and walit hass Ane place be fortoun to smyte oportune, And with the hail fors of hys body soyn Furth from hys hand weil far the lance gan thraw.

Lyke the blak thud of awfull thundris blast Furth flaw the schaft to smyte the dedly straik, And with it brocht cruell myschewos wraik; Quhilk throu the hawbrik skyrtis persyt hass, And the extreme bordour gan arrass Of hys strang scheild, cowchit of sevyn ply, And quhirrand smait hym throw the thee in hy, That with the dynt huge Turnus, full onsound, With faldyn howchis duschit to the grund. Vpstart Rutilianys sammyn complenyng With a ?elloch and cairfull womentyng, Quhill all the hillys rumysit thame abowt, And far on breid thyk woddis gaue a schowt. And Turnus, than, quhar he at erth dyd ly, Addressis furth full humyll and lawly Towart Ene hys syght and eyn tway, And strekis eik hys rycht hand hym to pray, And thus he said: “Forsuyth I haue deserve The deth, I knaw, and of thy hand to sterve, Ne wil I not beseik the me to spair. Oyss furth thy chance: quhat nedis process mar? Bot gif that ony cuyr or thocht,” quod he, “Of ony wofull parent may twich the, Haue rewth and mercy of Kyng Dawnus the ald (Thou had forsuyth, as I haue hard betald, Anchises, sik a fader as is he), And me, or than, gif bettir lykis the, My body, spul?eit and the life byreft, Onto my folkis thou may rendir eft.

Bot eftir that Eneas with hys eyn Sa cruell takynnys of dyseyss hess seyn, And can sik weid byreft thar aspy, All full of furour kyndlys he inhy, Full brym of ire and terribill thus can say: “Sall thou eschape me of this sted away, Cled with the spul?e of my frendis deir? Pallas, Pallas, with this wond rycht heir Of the ane offerand to the goddys makkis, And of thy wikkit blude punytioun takkis.” And sayand thus, full ferss, with all hys mayn, Law in hys breist or cost, lay hym forgayn, Hys swerd hess hyd full hait; and tharwithall The cald of deth dissoluyt hys membris all. The spreit of lyfe fled murnand with a grone, And with disdeyn vnder dyrk erth is goyn. etc. Explicit liber duodecimus Virgilii in Eneados Heir begynnys the Proloug of the Threttene and last Buk of Eneados ekit to Virgill be Mapheus Vegius Towart the evyn, amyd the symmyris heit, Quhen in the Crab Appollo held hys sete, Duryng the ioyus moneth tyme of June, As gone neir was the day and supper doyn, I walkyt furth abowt the feildis tyte, Quhilkis tho replenyst stud full of delyte, With herbys, cornys, catal, and frute treis, Plente of stoir, byrdis and byssy beys, In amerant medis fleand est and west, Eftir laubour to tak the nychtis rest.

Eneas tho with plesand voce furth braid And, standand abuf Turnus, thus he said: “O Dawnus son, quhou com this hasty rage Into thy breist with foly and dotage, That thou mycht nocht suffir the Troianys, Quhilkis at command of goddis onto thir planys And by power of hie Iove ar hiddir cary, Within the bundis of Italy to tary, And, all invane, thame so expellyng wald Of thar land of behest and promyst hald? Lern forto dreid gret Iove, and nocht gaynstand, And to fulfyll glaidly the goddis command; And for thar greif weill aucht we tobe war: Sum tyme in ire will grow gret Iupiter, And oft remembrans of the wikkit wraik Solistis the goddis tharof vengeans to take. Lo, now of all sik furour and effeir The lattir meith and term is present heir, Quhar thou aganyst reson and equyte, Aganyst lawte, and brokyn all vnyte Of confideratioun sworn and bund or now, The Troian pepill sair trublit hess thow.

Now cumis heir, Rutilianys, but delay, The body of ?our duke turss hyne away. I grant ?ou baith the armour and the man: Hald on, and do tharto all that ?e can, As langis onto the honor of bereyng, Or tobewaill the deth of sik a kyng.

And netheless now, ?e Italianys, That otherwyss be clepe Ausonyanys, Ramembir heirof, and lern in tyme cummyng With bettir aspectis and happy begynnyng To move and tak onhand debait or weir; For, be the blyssit sternys brycht I sweir, Neuer nane ostis nor ?it armour glaidly Aganyst ?ou in batal movit I, Bot constrenyt by ?our fury, as is kend, With all my forss I set me to defend The Troian party and our awyn ofspryng, As, lo, forsuyth this was bot lesum thing.” No mor Eneas said, bot tharwithall Addressys hym towart hys cite wall, And throu the feildis socht full ioyusly To hys new Troian reset and herbry. Sammyn hym followis all the rowt atanys, The pissans haill and ?ynkeris of Tewcranys, And our the planys, glaid and wondir lycht, Thar swyft stedis, as the fowle at flycht, Throu speid of fut assays by and by, And oft with bittir mouth dyd crying, “Fy!” And can accuss the Latyn pepill all, Oft fant folkis and sleuthfull dyd thame call; That with thar rerd and bemyng, quhar thai fair, For the deray full heich dynnys the air. Quhou Eneas, glaid of hys victory Lovyt the goddis, and can tham sacryfy.

And furth thai ?et the wyne in cowpis glaid, God Bachus giftis fast thai multiply; With platis full the altaris by and by Thai can do charge, and wirschipis with fat lyre; The smelland sens vpblesis in the fyre. Than throu that hald thai fest and mak gud cheir, Vprayss the mery rerd and ioyus beir: Thai dyd extoll and lovyng with gret wondir Gret Iupiter, the feirfull god of thundir; And Dame Venus thai wirschippit alsso; And the, Saturnus douchter, Queyn Iuno, Now pacifyit and bettir than befor, Ane huge lawd thai ?ald to the tharfor; And eik hym self Mars, the gret god of armys, Thai magnyfy as wrekar of thar harmys; Syne haill the remanent of the cumpany Of the goddys thai name furth by and by, With hie vocis and with lowd cryis Lovit and born vpheich abuse the skyis. Befor thame all maste gracius Eneas Hys handis twa, as tho the custum was, Towart the hevyn gan vplift and arays, And syne the child Ascanyus dyd embrass, Sayand a few wordis, that all mycht heir: “O thou my son and only child mast deir, In quham only restis thy faderis beleve, Quham throu samony laubouris of myscheve I careit haue, catchit full mony gatis Be the hard fortoun and the frawart fatis, Lo, now our rest and quyet fund for ay!

Fra that Dawnus his son Turnus saw ded, Huge lamentatioun maid he in that sted.

The fader Eneas astonyst wolx sum deill, Desyrus this syng suld betakyn seill; Hys handis baith vphevis towartis hevin And thus gan mak his boyn with myld stevin: “O Iupiter, gif euer ony tyme,” said he, “The Troian pepill, baith by land and see, Thyne admonitions, command and impyre Obeyt hass, page, man or syre; Of gif that I ?our power and godhed Dred, and adornyt intyll ony sted ?our altaris, or ony wirschip dyd tharto; And be that thyng ?it restis forto do, Gif ony thyng behynd ?it doith remane— With this ?our happy takyn augurian ?eld ws ?our plesand rest and ferm pess, Mak end of all our harmys and causs thame cess.” As he sik wordis warpys owt that tyde Hys goldyn moder apperis hym besyde, Confessand hir tobe the fair Venus, And with hir blissyt mowth scho carpis thus: “Son, do syk thocht and dreid furth of thy mynd, Ressaue thir godly syngis in bettir kynd, And ioyusly enioys, myn awyn Enee, The gret weilfar fra thens sal betyd the. Now is thy rest and quiet fund and kend, Now of thy harmys is cummyn extreme end; Now at the last, as thou desyris, perfay, This warld with the sal knyt vp peax for ay. Abhor thou nocht the fyre and flambis brycht, From thy deir spowsys hed glaid to the hycht, Bot constantly thy mynd thou now address; It salbe scho, I the declar express, That sall with blude ryall the douchty name, Thy successioun, renown and nobill fame, And Troian pryncis, of thy seid discend, Abufe the clowdis hie and sternys send. Scho sall of thy lynnage, my son Enee, Bair childryng full of magnanymyte, Of quhais ofspryng sik men sal succeid That all this large warld far onbreid With thar excelland wirschip sall fulfill, And by thar mychty power, at thar will, As conquerouris, vnder thar sen?eory Subdew and rewle this warldis monarchy; Of quham the schynand souerane glor sall wend, And far be?ond the occean see extend, Makand thame equale with the hevynnys hie; Quham, finaly, thar ardent gret bonte And soueran vertu, spred sa far onbred is, Eftir innumerabill sa feill douchty dedis, Sall mak thame goddis and thame deify, And thame vpheiss full hie abufe the sky. This flambe of fyre the wirschip and renovn Doith signyfy of thy successioun; The god almychty from his starrit hevin Hass schawin tharfor this syng of fyry levin: Tharfor, in recompens of sykkyn thyng, And samekill wirschip of hir sal spring, This cite, quhilk thou closys with a wall, Eftir thy spowsis name clepe thou sall. And forthir eyk, the goddis quham thou hynt Of Troy, that tyme quhen it in flambys brynt, Penates, or the goddis domesticall, Thou set alsso within the sammyn wall: Tharin thou gar thame soyn be brocht inhy In hie honour, and tyme perpetualy Thar to remane, eternaly to dwell. I sall to the of thame a wonder tell: Thai sall sa strangly luf this new cyte, That, gyf thame happynnys careit fortobe Tyll ony other sted or place tharby, All be thame self agane full hastely Thai sall return to this ilk town of thyne, That thou beildis in boundis of Kyng Latyn; ?a, quhou oftsyss that thai away be tayn, Thai sal return haymwart agane ilkane. O happy cyte and weil fortunat wall, With quham sa gret rellykis remane sall, Quharin thou sall in tyme tocum, but leyss, Govern the Troian folk in plesand pess! Eftir this at last Latyn, thy fader in law, Wery of hys lyfe and far in age draw, Doun to gostis in the campe Elyse Sall wend, and end his dolly days, and de: Onto hys ceptre thou sall do succeid, And vnder thy sen?eory, far onbreid, Sall weld and led thir ilk Italianys, And common lawis for thame and the Troianys Statut thou sall; and syne thou sall ascend, And vp to hevyn glaidly thy self send: Thus standis the goddis sentens and decreit.” Na mair scho said, bot, as the gleym doith gleit, From thens scho went away in the schyre ayr, I wait nocht quhidder, for I com neuer thar. Enee astonyst, havand hys mynd smyte With syk promyss of renown and delyte, Hys blissyt moderis command gan fulfill: And now at plesand rest, at hys awyn will, The Troian pepill rewlit he in pess. With this the kyng Latynus can decess And left the ceptre vacand to hys hand; Than the reuthfull Ene our all the land Of Italy succedis in hys sted And gan full large bundis in lordschip led, That halely obeyt to hys wand, And at hys lykyng rewlit all the land. Now equaly of fre will euery ane, Baith pepill of Troy and folk Italian, All of a ryte, manerys and vsans, Becummyn ar frendly but discrepans; Thar myndis and thar brestis in amyte, In ferm concord and gret tranquylite, Gan leif at eyss, confiderat in ally, As vnder a law sammyn coniunct evynly. Quhou Iupiter, for Venus causs and lufe, Hass set Eneas as god in hevyn abufe. Venus with this, all glaid and full of ioy, Amyd the hevynly hald, rycht myld and moy, Befor Iupiter down hir self set And baith hir armys abowt hys feyt plet, Enbrasand thame and kyssand reuerently; Syne thus with voce express scho said inhy: “Fader almychty, that from thy hevynly ryng At thy plesour rewlys and sterys al thyng, That manis dedys, thochtis and aventuris Reknys and knawys, and therof hess the curis; Weill I ramember, quhen that the pepill Troian With hard onfrendly forton was ourtane, Thou promyst of thar laubouris and distress Help and support, and efter dyseyss soless. Nowder thy promyss, fader, nor sentens Hess me dissauyt, for lo, with reuerens All the faderis of Italy hess se, But discrepans, fully thir ?heris thre, In blyssyt peax my son enioyss that land; Bot certis, fader, as I vndirstand, Onto the starnyt hevynly hald on hie Thou promyst rayss the maste douchty Enee, And, for hys meryt, abufe thy schynand sky Hym forto place in hevyn and deify. Quhat thochtis now doith rollyng in thy mynd, Sen, ellys, doith the vertuus thewys kynd Of this reuthfull Eneas the requyr Abuf the polys brycht to rayss that syre?” The fader tho of men and goddis all Gan kyss Venus hys child, and tharwithall Thir profund wordis from hys breist furth braid: “My deir douchtir Citherea,” he said, “Thow knawys quhou strangly the mychty Ene And the Eneadanys all of hys men?e Ithandly and onyrkyt luffyt haue I, On se and landis catchit by and by In perrellis seir, and quhou that ofttyme eik, Havand piete of the my douchtir meik, For lufe of the, for thar dyseyss was wo; And now I haue, lo, finaly alsso All thar harmys and ennoy brocht till end, And maid Iuno, as that full weill is kend, Fortobecum frendly and favorabill: Now lykis me, forsuyth, all ferm and stabill My sentens promyst to compleit,” quod he, “Quhen that the riall Troian duke Ene Amang the hevynnys institut I sall, And hym to numbyr of the goddis call: All this I grant with gud willis per fay, Tharfor, se that thou clenge and do away, Gif thar be in hym ony mortall thyng, And syne abuf the starnys thou him bryng: I sall alsso heich ony of hys kyn, Quhilk of thar proper vertu lyst do wyn Perpetuall lovyng by dedis honorabill, And doith contemp the wrachit warld onstabill; Thame in lyke wyss abufe the hevynnys hie I sal do place and deify,” quod he. The goddis abuf alhaill gave thar consent, Nor ryall Iuno, at that tyme present, Lyst not contrary, bot gan perswaid full evyn To bryng the gret Ene vp to the hevyn, And frendly wordis of hym carpys thar. Than Venus slaid discendand throw the ayr And socht onto the feildis Lawrentan, Neir by quhar that Numycus throu the playn, That fresch ryver, flowys to the see, Dekkyt abowt with redis growand hie; Quharin the body of hir son sa deir Scho maid do wesch, and vnder the stremys cleir All that was mortale or corruptibill thyng Gart do away; and syne, at hir lykyng, The recent happy sawl with hyr hynt sche And bair it vp abuf the ayr full hie Onto the hevyn, quhar reuthfull Eneas Amyd the starnys chosyn hass his place; Quham the famyll and kynrent Iulian Doith clepe and call amangis thame euery ane Indigites, quhilk is alsmekill to say As god induellar, at thar sudiornys ay; And, in remembrans of this ilk turn, Thai gan hys templis wirschip and adorn. etc. finis Explicit liber decimus tertius Eneados Conclusio Now is my wark all fynyst and compleit, Quham Iovis ire, nor fyris byrnand heit, Nor trynschand swerd sal defass ne doun thryng, Nor lang process of age, consumys al thyng.

Thus vp my pen and instrumentis full ?or On Virgillis post I fix for evirmor, Nevir, from thens, syk materis to discryve: My muse sal now be cleyn contemplatyve, And solitar, as doith the byrd in cage, Sen fer byworn is all my childis age, And of my days neir passyt the half dait That natur suld me grantyn, weil I wait. Thus sen I feill down sweyand the ballans, Heir I resyng vp ?yngkeris observans: Adew, gallandis, I geif ?ou all gud nycht, And God salf euery gentill curtass wight! Amen.

Ressave gude will, quhar that my cunnyng falys, And gyf within this volume ocht avalys, Or is onto ?our plesour aggreabill, Than is my laubour sum thyng profytabill. Quhar I offendit, or mysteris correctioun, Vndir ?our salfgard and protectioun I me submyt; ?he be my scheld and defens Aganys corruppit tungis violens, Can nocht amend, and ?it a falt wald spy: Quhen thai bakbayte, quhen evir thai clepe and cry, Gyf neyd beys, for ?our kynysman and clerk Than I protest ?e ansuer, and for ?our wark. Gyf thai speir quhy I dyd this buke translait, ?he war the causs tharof, full weill ?e wait; ?he cawsyt me this volume to endyte, Quharthrow I haue wrocht myself syk dispyte, Perpetualy be chydit with ilk knak, Full weill I knaw, and mokkyt behynd my bak. Say thai nocht, I myne honeste haue degraid, And at my self to schute a but hess maid? Nane othir thyng, thai threpe, heir wrocht haue I Bot fen?eit fabillys of idolatry, With sik myscheif as aucht not namyt be, Oppynnand the gravis of smert iniquyte, And on the bak half wrytis wyddyr synnys Plente of lesyngis, and ald perversyt synnys. Quhar that I haue my tyme superexpendyt, Mea culpa, God grant I may amend it, With grace and space to vpset this tynsell; Thocht not be far sa largely as thai tell, As that me semys, ?it offendit haue I; For weill I wait, our wark to mony a wy Sall baith be plesand and eyk profitabill, For tharin beyn seir doctrynys full notabill; It sal eik do sum folk solace, I gess, To pass the tyme, and eschew idylnes. Ane othir proffit of our buke I mark, That it salbe reput a neidfull wark To thame wald Virgill to childryn expone; For quha lyst note my versys, one by one, Sall fynd tharin hys sentens euery deill, And al maste word by word, that wait I weill. Thank me tharfor, masteris of grammar sculys, Quhar ?e syt techand on ?our benkis and stulys. Thus haue I not my tyme swa occupy That all suld hald my laubour onthryfty; For I haue not interpryt ne translate Every bural ruyd poet dywlgait, Na meyn endyte, nor empty wordis vayn, Common engyn, nor stile barbarian; Bot in that art of eloquens the flude Maste cheif, profund and copyus plenitud, Surss capitall in veyn poeticall, Soverane fontane, and flum imperiall; Quham gif I haue offendit, as thai meyn, Deym as ?e lyst, quhen the wark is ourseyn. Be as be may, ?our frendschip, weill I wait, Wrocht mair at me than dyd myne awyn estait; For kyndnes so myne eyn almaist maid blynd, That, ?ow to pleyss, I set all schame behynd, Offeryng me to my weriouris wilfully, Quhilk in myne e fast staris a mote to spy. Bot quha sa lawchis heirat, or hedis noddis, Go reid Bochas in the Genolygy of Goddis; Hys twa last bukis sall swage thar fantasy, Less than na resson may thame satysfy. I rak nocht quhidder fulys hald me devill or sanct, For ?ou maid I this buke, my Lord, I grant, Nowder for pryce, det, reward nor supple, Bot for ?our tendir request and amyte, Kyndness of blude grundyt in natural law.

Bot as twychyng this our wark now in hand, Quhilk oft is said was maid at ?our command, To quhat effect, gyf ony wald inqueir; ?he may ansuer, thocht I neid nocht ?ow leir, That Virgill mycht intill our langage be Red lowd and playn be ?our lordschip and me, And other gentill compan?eonys quha sa lyst; Nane ar compellit drynk not bot thai haue thryst: And quha sa lykis may tastyng of the tun Onforlatyt, new from the berry run, Reid Virgill baldly, but mekill offens Except our wlgar toungis differens, Kepand na facund rethoryk castis fair, Bot haymly playn termys famyliar, Na thing alterit in substans the sentens, Thocht scant perfyte observyt beyn eloquens; I will weill otheris can say mair curyusly, Bot I haue said eftir my fantasy, I covait nocht to prefer ony wight, It may suffice I said na thing bot rycht; And, set that empty be my brayn and dull, I haue translait a volum wondirfull: So profund was this wark at I haue said, Me semyt oft throw the deip sey to waid; And sa mysty vmquhile this poecy, My spreit was reft half deill in extasy, To pyke the sentens as I couth als playn, And bryng it to my purposs, was full fayn; And thus, becauss the mater was onkowth, Not as I suld, I wrait, bot as I couth. Quha wenys I say thir wordis bot invane, Lat thame assay als lang laubour agane, And translait Ovid, as I haue Virgill; Perchans that wark sall occupy thame a quhile: ?it haue I hard oft said be men na clerkis, Tyll idyll folk full lycht beyn lukand warkis. To ?ou, my Lord, quhat is thar mair to say? Ressaue ?our wark desyrit mony a day; Quharin also now am I fully quyt, As twichand Venus, of myn ald promyt Quhilk I hir maid weil twelf ?heris tofor, As wytnessith my Palyce of Honour, In the quhilk wark, ?he reid, on hand I tuke Forto translait at hir instance a buke: Sa haue I doyn abufe, as ?e may se, Virgillis volum of hir son Enee, Reducit, as I cowth, intill our tong.

My Lord, all thocht I dyd this wark compyle, At ?our command, intill owr wlgar style, Suffir me borrow this a word at the leist, Thar with to quyte my promyss and beheste, And lat Dame Venus have gud nycht adew, Quhamto sum tyme ?he war a servand trew.
