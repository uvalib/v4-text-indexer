      <field name="fulltext">FIRST SERIES SONG [This peach is pink with such a pink] This peach is pink with such a pink As suits the peach divinely; The cunning colour rarely spread Fades to the yellow finely; But where to spy the truest pink Is in my Love's soft cheek, I think. The snowdrop, child of windy March, Doth glory in her whiteness; Her golden neighbours, crocuses, Unenvious praise her brightness! But I do know where, out of sight, My sweetheart keeps a warmer white. CUPID Love, I met thee yesterday, With an empty quiver, Coming from Clarinda's house By the reedy river. And I saw Clarinda stand Near the pansies, weeping, With her hands upon her breast All thine arrows keeping. When the dewdrops came like stars, Full of little flashes, All Clarinda's tears I kissed From her shining lashes. A PETITION Once in the daring days, Born out of strife, Gods of my fashioning Sprang into lifeâ Gods of high flight that scorn Death as he plods, Wonderful, winged and wild, Glittering gods! Yet were they weak as reeds, Bending for this, Only a woman's eyes, Only her kiss. Then did a god in me, Youngest and fair, Bind me with luminous Tangles of hair; Drave me to roam at night Under the moon Till it was winter-time Even in June! Then in his treachery, Traitor and spy! Snared her away I loved, Left me to die. Soon when he deemed that I Pardoned the smart, Lo, he, importunate, Cried at my heart! Shelter I gave him not, Nought of my breast E'en though he fainted there Bleeding, oppressed. Then did each god in me Powerless seem, And at his altar changed Into a dream! What has a man to do? Toil and grow old, Breaking his heart to gain Silver and gold: Happy to-day with one Dearest and wife; Ruined by lives that spring Out of his life! Wrinkles and heavy eyes, Vanishing graceâ Rags on the girl he loved, Want on her face! But if his shallop speed Safe on the sea, Laden with spice and pearls, Laughter and glee, Fortune but blesses him When he is grey, When the love-light is faint, Stealing away; So that his quiet years, Passed in his chair, Lack the fine fire to kiss Love's loosened hair! Gods, shall I yearn to stay Stoop and grow sad, Poor, since no riches buy Aught that I had? Never again to speed Over the lawn, Over the hills to catch Sparkles of dawn! Never again to wait Down by the brook, Wait for her coming feet, Long for her look! Gods that have fashioned me, Take me again, Take me, forgiving me Error and stain; Spare them that love me yet, Find them a faceâ Find them a heart and life Dear in my place; And when the swallows' wings Whispering sweep Leave me a little while Dreaming asleep! There for my covering Grant me, I crave, Armies of rapid weeds Storming my grave! Regiments with grassy spears Marching along Chanting for me alone Snatches of song! And let the friends who come Seeking me start Birds from my resting feet, Birds from my heart. Here in the dewy moss, Here lay me down, Far from the smoke and dust, Far from the town; Out of the breaking hearts, Terrors and tears; Out of the selfishness, Folly and fears; Far from the bitter wrong Waiting for right; Into the cold and dark Looking for light! SONG [Wait but a little whileâ] Wait but a little whileâ The bird will bring A heart in tune for melodies Unto the spring, Till he who's in the cedar there Is moved to trill a song so rare, And pipe her fair. Wait but a little whileâ The bud will break; The inner rose will ope and glow For summer's sake; Fond bees will lodge within her breast Till she herself is plucked and prest Where I would rest. Wait but a little whileâ The maid will grow Gracious with lips and hands to thee, With breast of snow. To-day Love's mute, but time hath sown A soul in her to match thine own, Though yet ungrown. A SIN I met a woman in the street The angry wind seemed blowing through: I halted, for the way she trod Reminded me of you. She turned and spake in tones that matched Her soft, tear-clouded eyes of blue: I gave her bread because her voice Reminded me of you. But as I went upon my road The sin flashed full upon my viewâ In that I only gave to God In memory of you! A GREAT MASTER Here in the valley Lyric with love, Singing to slumber Redpoll and dove, Who's the musician Hid in the fruit, Lulling each velvety Vocalist mute? Milkmaid and shepherd List in the hush, List to the fairyland Flute of the thrush! Hark to his quavers, Hark to his breves, Shaking the cherries, Thrilling the leaves! Mellowly pouring Out of the tree Starlit impromptus, Laura, for thee; Golden allegros Flow from his heart, Throstle Beethoven, Spohr or Mozart! A PASTORAL The last cow's milked, and Mary's free To cool her face so warm; She pats old Ginger tenderly And lends her comely arm To hoist the pail Across the rail, And foots it homeward to the farm. The bodice of her dairy-dress Is full of milk-white loveliness, And in her cheek there vies The wild rose with the snowdrop small That makes a deeper blue of all The violets in her eyes! With fearful hope and happy fear She listens for Jock's tread, And when his whistle proves him near She does not turn her head Because her face May show the trace Of love too great till she is wed! The bodice of her dairy dress Goes up and down in dear distress, And in her conscious cheek The snowdrop changes to a rose, And in her eyes each violet shows The love it cannot speak! A SONG [I will not say my true love's eyes] I will not say my true love's eyes Outshine the noblest star; But in their depth of lustre lies My peace, my truce, my war. I will not say upon her neck Is white to shame the snow; For if her bosom hath a speck I would not have it go. My love is as a woman sweet, And as a woman white; Who's more than this is more than meet For me and my delight. RENUNCIATIONS Dan Cupid, get thee gone! I will no more endure theeâ Thy wailings and thy fun, Thy promisings to cure me! So shy and shrewd, So pure and lewd, So full of shade and sun, I can no more endure theeâ Dan Cupid, get thee gone! O woman, get thee gone! No more shalt thou undo meâ Of whims and vapours spun, Thou shalt not come unto me! Both dry and dew, Both false and true, Budge, wench, and run, run, run! No more shalt thou undo meâ O woman, get thee gone! HOLY GROUND Shy maids have haunts of still delight, The lover glades he never tells; And one is mine where mass the bright And odoured chimes of foxglove-bells. A dewy, covert, silent place Where surely long ago God walked Close to His creature's blinded face, And for his finer moulding talked. There hawthorn glows as if, white-hot, God present, it were sacred found To preach a creed too oft forgotâ That all we tread is holy ground. Ah, could we but remember this, Our thoughts would spring as purely up To labour for our fellows' bliss As doth to heaven a snowdrop's cup! A SHEPHERD'S SONG Come, sweetheart, do not cry! Our love was born to die; For Love's a nimble fellow Who rarely stays to mellow. Some lusty shepherd swain Will pinch your cheek again When these fresh tears are dryâ Come, sweetheart, do not cry! Why, Delia, do not pout! A flame must e'en go out, And honest lads would falter To pledge the fool won't alter! Let's be as friend to friend, Kiss once, and homeward wend With hearts both wise and stoutâ Why, Delia, do not pout! A SONG [I need some music for my brain] I need some music for my brain As pansies need the dew; Sing that heart-breaking song again, And let my play for you. Of old a sigh betrayed your breast, The courier of your pain; And just one tear-drop, unrepressed, Came, shone, and fled again. You loved me then. And when you ask If I can play it yet, I sit and sound the tender task I never may forget. And if you falter at the part Where long ago you sighed, Remember we are heart to heart Serenely satisfied. IN SPRING April's sweet upon the hill, Streamlets, full with rainy fee, Flow in silvery adventure Out to sea. Cherry is the hedge's bride, Marriages are made by sun; Here's a downy habitation Just begun! Love, when thou hast come to seek In my sweetheart's side for rest, Wake for me a Spring as fragrant In her breast! COURAGE When you kneel to-night, and pray God to keep the house you love, Think of me so far away, Think of me, my dear and dove. For to-night, when I shall call Blessings on the house I love, I shall ask for joy to fall On your heart, my dear and dove. Let us trust a Father's care, Looking to a Father's love; He will only bid us bear What we can, my dear and dove. A LOVE SONG Some may praise thy wondrous tresses With a poet's golden speech; Some may muse within their meshes On thy cheek, so soft's the peach; Some may sing that stars above thee Wait for thee to light their skies; I can only sayâI love thee, With my lips and with mine eyes. Some may call thee true and tender In an ode upon thy face; Or may hymn thy bosom's splendour, Snow beneath its snowy lace! Some may sing that saints above thee Are less pure in Paradise; I can only sayâI love thee, With my lips and with mine eyes. WERE I A BIRD Were I a bird, I would not pipe Save when my love was near the tree, That I might watch her lips so ripe Half-open in delight at me. And I would sing a song divine, Would make her clasp her heart in pain, Yet never tire, and always pine To hear me carol it again. A song so full of tears and ache, Of such fair sadness and unrest, That she her homeward path should take, And yearn to lodge me in her breast. Were I a bird, I would not sing Save when my love was near the tree, That I might watch my music bring Her maiden blood in praise of me. A SONG [The shyest blooms are best. The hidden bird] The shyest blooms are best. The hidden bird Can make a midnight melody of wrong; And sweetest far the Love that is not heard Before a kindred soul demands its song. How luring she that's simple-souled and staid! And love is ever rarest half-afraid. The maytree has its white, the rose its red, The brook gold lilies, and the pool its rush; The graveyard has its unforgotten dead, And life has beauty waking to a blush. But Love has tenderness and all sweet things, And throbs alike for cotters and for kings! NASEBY EVE Here's to men who pluck a blade, Whirling it for Charlie! Here's to ev'ry willing maid Blushing in the barley! Pest befall the trooper knave Cheats her of a crown, Sirs, Chant him as a miser slaveâ Let us sing him down, Sirs! Then let each morion be a cup, And drink, my night-hawks, drink Till Noll shall prick his dog's ears up To listen to the clink! Troll a stave for Mistress Plump Carving at the pullets, While our cans the board bethump In the praise of bullets! Brown October gaily hums In our ringing sconces As we give the hymn that comes Cavalier responses! Then let each trooper of you all Drench beards again and drink, Till ev'ry Barebones, great and small, Can catch the ditty's clink! Death to Reuben Snufflenoseâ Scores of canting thinkers Soon to taste the burly blows Rained by lusty drinkers! Here's to trumpet, sword, and glove, Wenches' lips at pleasure, While the varlet Roundheads prove Souls the only treasure! Then let our morions be the cups, And shout, my night-hawks, shout Till from his tent where Satan sups, Noll push his brewer's snout! A PATIENT He watches her the livelong day, A household spirit, star and stay; He bends upon her till he dies The still devotion of his eyes. O God, who took from him we see The talent of activity, To him mysteriously bereft How much in charity was left! A woman bent beneath the load, And sang along the sacred road; Faith showed a still unshaken spire, Love lit the cot with tenfold fire! REQUIESCAM The churchyard yews may murmur on Monotonous o'er me, But that incessant dirge which sounds So very wearily May to the thistled grass make moanâ I shall not hear beneath my stone. Friends' faces shine not now again, And I have breathed my last; The pulse of love, the grip of scorn, The ache, the stir are past: Life was my only deep distressâ Sleep is my crown of happiness. Of all I lose the loss is most Of hearing birds no more; Of no more hearing rebel waves Insurgent on the shore; The hedges, harvests, all are goneâ My little dream of daylight's done. A MAID'S HOLIDAY The deep and silent undergrowth Shall be my home this summer day; The idle bird and breeze shall both Entrance me with their lay: How cool to lie where shadows toss In revelry upon the turf, And press my fingers in the moss, And be no more a serf! No more a slave to pen and ink; No more a slave to aching dread; Released from cages where I think To win my daily bread. O little blade of grass so soft, My heart is glad to find you hereâ To find your slender lance aloft, With all your comrades near! Is then your regiment, bright, alert, In marching order, cooled by dew, Camped here to watch that none may hurt The speedwell's speck of blue? Or do you guard the foxglove bloom That rings a chime it never tells, Round which the bees in concert boom And rumble in its bells? 'Tis sweet indeed to lie and watch Faint figures in the open glades; To see the pressing sweethearts snatch A tribute from the maids! To hear the clink of milking-pails; The brisk and angry crack of whips That startle Colin by the rails From touching Cicely's lips! But best of all, with eyes devout, To gaze in silence at the sky, And wonder if the dead look out Upon me as I lie: Across my patch of firmament So many angels seem to roveâ So many friends who died and went, Tho' not beyond my love! I will not wrong their happiness, Nor lust to bring them back again, For God will give fresh joy to ease The iron of my pain: He sends me lilacs, pansies, pinks, This deep and silent undergrowth, And sometimes, when my spirit sinks, The peace of utter sloth. THE HAPPY DEAD Some lie in their spices and linen unshrunken, Their weariness, wonder, and waiting are past; They feel not the cold and their cheeks are scarce sunken, They dream of a light that may wake them at last; But though it should shine not, these figures repine not, They sleep in their peace with the world overhead; And who shall disturb them, or who shall perturb them? Yea, they are the happy ones, they who are dead. I turn me away from the noise of the street filled With footfalls of merchants and faces of thieves; My treasure-house stands in the gold of the wheat-field, My books are the bushes with millions of leaves. The poppy stares up in my face as she bears up Her sleep-giving cup of imperial red, But Death could enchant me far more would he plant me Too deep down for poppies, dead dust with the dead. The nuts slip their leashes and couch in the mosses, The over-ripe berry falls into the pond; The butterfly's floating magnificence crosses Our lawn for a moment, then flutters beyond: And likewise we flutter a moment, and utter The laugh and the moan that together are wed; But tho' we must weep well, God give we may sleep well Deep down in the silences next to the dead. Come, Merciful Sleep, where the balmy wind passes Not far from the slopes where anemones grow; Perchance I shall learn the soft secret of grasses, And hear when the world's heart begins to beat slow. But set up no token, and leave me unspokenâ My name and my virtues and aught I have said; The few who have kissed me, and she who has missed me, Need nothing to guide them to where I am dead. If bird-dreams and shade-dreams be all unavailing, Grant slumber in one of the many green graves; Give peace in sea-gardens spread under ships sailing Far, far from the shoreward quick tramp of the waves: Cold comrades to sleep with, but never to weep with, Stark brides that come down to us sinking as lead: And well if Time hold us where Ocean has rolled us, Unmeshed by the drag-net that draws in the dead! THE KISS Beneath his eyes a fringe of lace Upon her bosom strangely stirs, For she had seen herself in his, And knew he saw himself in hers. So, like a new-born star that fears Its own magnificence of light, Those dark blue glories of her face Seemed clouded over by the night. Yet in that glance she found her place Was by his sideâher all in allâ As clearly as Belshazzar saw The hand that wrote upon the wall. And wisdom lit her leaping heart More swiftly than the swallows skim; Whereas the King dropped down his cup To call interpreters to him. And soft as mother's earliest word Unto her babe a moment old, His kiss, with Midas-touch, at last Came down and turned her life to gold. THE REASON That I, all loveless, sing of love Is passing strange: What can I know except that love Knows how to change? O Fortunate, if it be true Love bends his roseleaf cheek to you! That he should make divine her eyes Was nought, Love felt; He snowed on woman's heart a snow That could not melt, Although the slopes whereon it lay Were warm as rainless April day, Love lent me angel eyes a while, And O! a breast Of stainless snow's fresh-fallen hue For dreamy rest! Wherefore, unkissed, my lips still move With songs to praise the Ghost of Love. A SONG [Love, with a crocus in his cap] Love, with a crocus in his cap, Came past the streams and springs, His quiver full of faithlessness And sweet imaginings, In snowdrop time And primrose prime. Love, with a rosebud in his cap, Came o'er my meadowlands; His gold-tipped bow he bent at me With only idle hands In tulip time And pansy prime. Love, with a dead leaf in his cap, Outspread his velvet wings, Nor gathered he the arrows shot From off the silver strings. Ah, tearful prime Of winter-time! A SONG [Maid of the yet unconquered heart] Maid of the yet unconquered heart, My siege to thee alone is set; Love hath no secret shaft or dart, No web of smiles, no cunning net, But I will storm his arsenal To make thy virgin fortress fall. Maid of inviolate snow, beware! With trench and mine and ev'ry test To lull the foe, or speak her fair, I march to my desire of rest: Nor shall the clang of war's alarms Hush till I find me in thine arms! HOPE The flush that gathers in thy cheeks Sweeps down thy neck in scarlet wealth, And in a realm of tenderness Shakes roses on the snow by stealth. Because I say, â'Twere sweet enough To suffer Fortune's sharpest test So there were refuge for my head Among the lilies of thy breast.â For this the sword of Damocles Its point above my head might swing, And I would joy as lovers do Who walk and whisper in the Spring. Hate has no goblin at his beck Whose scheming brain could ever cope Against man's finest heritageâ The immortality of hope. And all my share in this shall cling Round thee, pure angel of my dream; That when thy mating moment's here, When Loves surprise thee by the stream, Filling thine eyes with softer lightâ Painting thy lips a deeper hue,â My absence shall be poisoned thorns, My presence, bloom and fruit and dew! AN EPITAPH He sang a simple forest song; To him the day was never long Amid the blooms and feathered throng He loved with all his heart: He took the hand he knew was pure; He preached the faith he felt was sure; God taught him how he should endure And gird him to depart. A ROSEBUD Love's a little rosebud, Speak not of the thorn! Only watch the rosebud Open in the morn. Maiden, on the milk-white Beauty of thy breast Give the little rosebud Rest. VERSES You will not kiss me, O my love, my love! You will not kiss me, but you cannot spare My lips for others, nor in comfort list If haply they should laud strange eyes and hair. The violets and roses of my choice Must in your garden grow, or you are sad; And if I cease to smile, come shining tears To buy fresh smiles, whereat your heart grows glad. Thus in austere simplicity our lives Are sunshine, sunshine, sunshine without heat; And it is witness to your nameless charm That I must starve in patience at your feet. SONG [We walk together, you and I] We walk together, you and I, And dream the world is ours to-day; So bright the sun, so blue the sky, And then the cloudsâso far away! So present is our paradise That both our hearts it scantly grieves To know that Death beyond the hedge Is leering through the leaves. Love, when I stoop to kiss your hand, Across your face warm blushes pass Like shadows floating o'er the land, Elusive islands on the grass: And when my lips essay your own, And all your breast insurgent heaves, Wide eyes of Death may stare in vain When looking through the leaves. The corn on yonder yellow hill Has that ripe colour of your hair; To-morrow men will whistle shrill, And neither corn nor poppy spare. To-day, at least, the field shall glow; To-day, at least, our fate reprieves; So love me, dearest, spite of Death, Who leers between the leaves! [Who will may take Love's pipe from out my fingers] Who will may take Love's pipe from out my fingers, Who will may sing the songs I used to sing; No more where dying daylight shyly lingers Will I, made musical, salute the Spring. No more my sheep shall crop the grass around me, Browsing the rings where Queen Titania trips; No more I shame the leaves and birds that found me Once as a shepherd praise Clarinda's lips. O woodland nymph, whose amber-coloured tresses Held me so long where love-lyres woo and ache, Now I desert the soul of thy caresses, Struggling, all dazed, from thine enchanted brake! Lie still, lost Love! Young blood will come to woo thee, Blood that shall leap to find thee flushed and fair; Heroes of fire, young kings of verse, shall sue thee, Nest on thy heart that shines beyond compare! But from my pipe hath poured its first love's splendour, Now will I dare the steep that bounds the plain; Teaching my soul its duty, stern and tender, Singing the truth that only comes through pain. APPENDIX It was the author's intention to omit some verses from this new issue of âA Country Muse,â but it was pointed out to him that the present book could hardly pretend to be a second edition if it did not contain all that was in the first. Consequently the poems he would prefer to leave out are printed in this Appendix. A SONG [I kissed thee once.] I kissed thee once. No deep distress, No bitterness Of piercing word or silent bird Can cloud with strife This joy of lifeâ I kissed thee once. I kissed thee once. When wings apace Towards thy face The robber bee to plunder thee, Not first he sips Thy honeyed lipsâ I kissed thee once! TO A MAID SLEEPING ON THE LAWN Gold and roses, Roses, gold! Not a thorn to Prick the bold! She reposes, As of old, Gold and roses, Roses, gold. Love and kisses, Kisses, love! Whiter-breasted Than a dove! When she misses This her glove, Love and kisses, Kisses, love, Sweet and lily, Lily, sweet, I will throw me At her feet In this stilly Rose retreat, Sweet and lily, Lily, sweet!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECOND SERIES MY COUNTRY LOVE If you passed her in your city You would call her badly dressed, But the faded homespun covers Such a heart in such a breast! True, her rosy face is freckled By the sun's abundant flame, But she's mine with all her failings, And I love her just the same. If her hands are red they grapple To my hands with splendid strength, For she's mine, all mine's the beauty Of her straight and lovely length! True, her hose be thick and homely And her speech is homely, too; But she's mine! her rarest charm is She's for me, and not for you! A THIEF There goes Love across the meadow, And I know his errand sweet; Hark! the God is softly singing To the music of his feet; For he speeds to kiss Clarinda As she milks the mottled kine; O the thief, to steal before me To the mouth that's only mine! A DEAD FRIEND It hardly seems that he is dead, So strange it is that we are here Beneath this great blue shell of sky With apple-bloom and pear: It scarce seems true that we can note The bursting rosebud's edge of flame, Or watch the blackbird's swelling throat While he is but a name. No more the chaffinch at his step Pipes suddenly her shrill surprise, For in an ecstasy of sleep Unconsciously he lies, Not knowing that the sweet brown lark From off her bosom's feathery lace Shakes down the dewdrop in her flight To fall upon his face. A SONG [Coward heart, to dream of yielding] Coward heart, to dream of yielding When the fray is scarce begun! 'Tis not Spring alone that's gladdened By the shining of the sun; Late in Autumn's riper days Love is bornâand more, he stays! What's a sea to Love if Hero Wait upon the other side? Never came a rosebud's beauty But the guarding thorn was tried! 'Tis when hope seems spent and past Cupid comes this way at last. IN THE GLADE From bush to bush I followed her, A bird that piped and flew beyond, I saw the little branches stir, I saw her shadow in the pond; And still she lured me to the wood With cunning notes so round and ripe; I followed in a dreamy mood This feathered Orpheus and her pipe. We passed a slope where cowslips shook Their yellow blossoms in the breeze; We passed the shallows of the brook, And reached the temple of the trees: And still her music onward went Through hazel-alleys, beechen groves, Where doves with lulling voices sent Soft salutations to their loves. So down these verdant colonnades I still pursued the woodland note, O'er lawny islands of the glades That echoed to the blackbird's throat. And as I neared one bright expanse A cool oasis clothed with green, A perfume, sweeter than romanceâ Than love that only might have been Came, with a stripling breeze for aid, To stay a moment, stay and pass; Another step. I spied a maid, Or goddess, sleeping in the grass. Around her in an amber stream There flowed the marvel of her hair, The ransom for a world, the dream To fill the morning with despair: The pink of apple-bloom possessed The virgin cheeks unkissed by man; And round her throat the sun had pressed To clasp it with his ring of tan: Her lips, half-opened, had the light Of cherries bathed by drops of rain; Reproachless was the dome of white Unblemished brow without a stain. Then in my heart that love did cry Which from my life shall never pass; And bitterly I longed to lie Beside her beauty in the grass. The doves in spires of elm and oak Cooed softly in the afternoon, And sometimes from a bush there broke A whitethroat's tenderness of tune. The air was full of nameless joy! And, daring all, I threw me down As innocently as a boy Beside her scented film of gown. Now if some secret charm in her Across my aching heart did sweep, Some magic in her bosom's stir, I know notâbut I fell asleep, And when the day, a patient bride, Was parting from her love, the sun, The girl, or goddess, from my side Had gently risen, and was gone! REFUSAL Clarinda's shy. She's mute, the rogue, and says me nay Whate'er I ask. Yet all I need is but to touch The velvet of her hand, to hear The rosebud call me Shepherd dearâ Clarinda's shy. Clarinda's shy. The rosebud pouts and bids me hence Whate'er I ask. Yet all I need is but to hold, For she has never been embraced, The living circle of her waistâ Clarinda's shy. Clarinda's shy. Her pinky ears, those lovely shells, Whene'er I speak She floods apace with rain of gold. Yet all I ask is only this, To melt upon her snow a kissâ Clarinda's shy. LOVE'S SHARE Cupid coming through the wood Met me, and his eyes were bright, So I knew the god had seen Sweet Clarinda's red and white: Love had nestled all day long In a haunt of lace and bliss; Round his mouth the dimples came, Thinking of Clarinda's kiss. Welcome, Love! Thine eyes may drink What she has of shy and rare; Thou a captive lie content In the tangles of her hair. I will share her breast with thee; Then shall never sorrow come When Clarinda's footstep makes Music in my cottage home. TO THE WORLD Give me my Love's enchanted eyes, The right to lie where'er she lies, And muse on her in wonder; But never speak a single word Shall harm us more than song of bird, Or rive our souls asunder. CONTENT Though singing but the shy and sweet Untrod by multitudes of feet, Songs bounded by the brook and wheat, I have not failed in this, The only lure my woodland note, To win all England's whitest throat! O bards in gold and fire who wrote, Be yours all other bliss! THREE MAIDSChlorisâ Here's Cupid sleeping on a bank! Let's steal his bow and break his arrows, Or pinch him till he promises To shoot them only at the sparrows! Why, what a charming rogue it is, And what a tempting mouth to kiss!Clarindaâ Shame fall on any plan to snatch The rosy god's most sacred arrows! While this my bosom's loveless still, Pray Cupid spare the world of sparrows! I have a target soft and fair That longs to feel his arrow there!Doraâ Unless his dart he aim apace Our skin will wear from pink to yellow, And not a maid as wife will sleep Beside some strapping shepherd-fellow! Wherefore my lips the god shall buss That he may wake and shoot at us! ON SEEING A TRAIN START FOR THE SEASIDE O might I leave this grassy place For spreading foam about my feet! The splendid spray upon my face, The flying brine itself were sweet If I might hear on Cromer beach The freedom of Old Neptune's speech! Ah, never language like to this For those whose ears can understand! Sometimes the coming of a kiss To mate the ocean with the strand; Sometimes the nameless oath is heard The sea-god thunders through his beard! I have a sea of blue on high, I have a sea of green beneath; For me sweet inland birds do cry Until with joy I hold my breath; But Ocean's harp of wave and stone Is bird and leaf and stream in one! Upon my dancing apple-sprays The blackbird whistles melodies; Half through a mellow run he stays And flashes to a neighbour's trees: He's rare, but rarer now would be The strident pebbles of the sea. And is it strange that round the shore The lyric water should rejoice? Ah no! for ever more and more The happy dead are in its voice. Majestic poet! might I be As full of song, as finely free! THE GIPSY KING'S SONG Moths may flutter round a lamp, Stars may haunt the skies; Bees may plunder roses' heartsâ Give me Laura's eyes! Delve for gold, ye misers, delve In the priceless west; Snatch the diamond from the darkâ Leave me Laura's breast! Argonauts, upturn the gems, Guard them home in ships, Cast them in a silken lapâ Leave me Laura's lips! Fortune, wreck a kingdom set In the blue above; Play at bowls with hemispheresâ Leave me Laura's love! MY CHERRY-TREES O children of the smoke and fog, With faces pinched by early care, Would God you might adventure forth To breathe this country air! Would God your ears might drink the song Of grasses, birds, and singing trees! Would God your eyes grew round to see My wealth of cherry-trees! A hundred thousand shining lamps To light the glory of the green! The rubies of my orchard hang The sturdy leaves between; The blackbird pecks them at his will, The brazen sparrow with his beak Attacks some swaying globe of fruit And stabs its ruddy cheek. But in the Covent Garden roads You see the sluttish cabbage-leaf In air that steals away your strength, God's bounty turned a thief! How happy is my growing boy That here in grass which pricks his knees He roams his world so shy and clean Beneath my cherry-trees! I often lift him to a branch That burns with cherries redly ripe; A startled thrush in flight displays The shrillness of his pipe; And down to mother's upturned mouth His baby hand so plumply fair He reaches full of fruit, or drops A cherry in her hair! Apollo gave my rustic Muse Her artless shepherd-songs to sing; The sorrel charms her, and the gloss Upon the swallow's wing; But often dreaming in the wood, When comes the evening gift of dew, Her soul flies forward to your souls, And, children, thinks of you. Your naked feet within this grass Should learn some simple country dance; Upon your hearts should flash at last The colours of romance. O empty purse of mine, alas That such a happy vision flees! That all these urchins may not romp Beneath my cherry-trees! LOVE'S AWAKENING Chloris singing through the wood Cupid spied a-sleeping; Long the troubled maiden stood At the archer peeping: On his pink and perfect cheeks, From the branches shaken, Sprinkled tiny drops of dew, But he would not waken. Chloris in her homespun gown Shyly came a-creeping; And she bent her beauty down O'er the god a-sleeping: âSoftly, velvet kiss,â she saidâ How her heart was shaken!â âMelt upon this ruby mouth That the Boy awaken!â A FORTUNATE ISLAND Across the hills, across the sea, Across the land that lies beyond, An islet slumbers in the waves As languid as a lilied pond: There roses keep a festival Of breaking bud and scented breath; And on the hills and by the sea There is no dream of death. Festoons of princely purple hang, And crimson creepers to and fro Move to the whisper of the winds That lull to linger, lift to go: The golden birds on blooms of fire, The lowlier larks on flaming heath, Trill, for their happy hearts are sure There is no dream of death. Here are the summer sights and sounds Of untempestuous summer seas; The strand that as a vast harp rings To foamy fingers' melodies. And all who find this quiet isle Across the hills, across the sea, Across the land that lies beyond, Shall live eternally. THE RIVULET Here I come and cast me down, Shining rivulet, beside thee; And thy birds shall sing the frown Off my brow the while I hide me On thy sloping banks that fall In a cataract of grasses, Till the blades can softly call Secrets to the leaf that passes. Let the music of thy speed, And the mist of sacrifices Rising from the stilly mead Sweet with wildwood blossom-spices Teach that Nature's quiet priests Here within her sacred spaces, At the coming of her feasts Cast all care from off their faces. Me my mother ofttimes bore Here, O rivulet, to view thee; Here I learned the song-bird's lore, Here I loved and here I knew thee; What thou spakest to the cress Found an echo in my spirit, And I heard in happiness Foxglove bells that tinkled near it. Good it is to find thee still Faithful to the distant river; Sweet to think the fruitful hill Grant its help to thee for ever: Constant height and constant stream, Shall I find where last we parted, Her I love, my hope, my dream, Just as fair and gentle-hearted? Am I dreaming? She is dead. Death in envy of her tresses Stole her wealth of white and red, All her bosom's lovelinesses; Then the skies of duller blue And thy lessened music taught me, Stream, the abundance and the hue Of the harvest Time had brought me. Loveless now I come apace, Shining rivulet, revealing To thy bright familiar face What can find no truer healing? Nature by her mother's skill, Where the greensward's cool and slanting, Soothes me with the wood and hill And the slumber in thy chanting. On thy breast I cast my love! Let it float adown thy reaches Past the fluting of the dove, Thymy banks and silver beeches: Chance may steer it to those isles Where the tearless walk together In a paradise of smiles, Tenderness and golden weather. A COURTSHIP 'Twas breakfast-time; the noisy house Constrained the antics of the mouse; The nursery window, opened wide, Let in the scents of morning-tide. The sun looked in with jolly face; He saw some youngsters saying grace; He turned the teapot to a gem, He found the spoons and goldened them. The under-nurse industrious sat, And stitched the brim of Baby's hat; The sun grew fond about her head, Her needle married shining thread. Her gown, receptive of the sun, Seemed wonder-wrought and fairy-spun. O golden tailor! golden trade So to befrock a rosebud maid She worked; a tiny sparkling globe Fell on the bosom of her robe; The sun perceived the liquid fear, And made a topaz from the tear. And thus sweethearting with his mote, He ringed the beauty of her throat, And on her fruitful bodice prest He boldly warmed her comely breast. The winking buttons on her gown Shone like the lamps of London Town, And on her slippers, black and bright, There fell the wooing lips of light. At last the sun began to make The old mistake, the old mistake! And then the nurse, a modest maid, Rose and departed to the shade! MY CONTENT What's my content? I love the bird, I love the blue That deepens in the firmament, The grass to mate them, and the hush Before the warble of the thrush: At morn and evening from the brake All sweet-throat minstrels choicely make A rare content. How God is good!â He lends the song, He lends the sky! And O, my heart has understood The spider's fragile line of lace, The common weed, the woody space! These miracles that bring me bliss, And one sweet English girl to kiss, Make my content. REFLECTIVE LOVE The wiser few who snap a thumb At youth when he is hot to tie, Passed through the flame, not seldom come On love mature that cannot die. The helpmeet with her quiet treadâ That constant music, sweet, assuredâ Moves round him till his need is fed By love in use, by care outpoured. Unshaken by the heats of youth, The spikes of passion and their smart, Man probes the soul of woman's truth And hugs contentment to his heart. A SONG [When maids with easy lips consent] When maids with easy lips consent To feed us all on Cupid's pillage, And daring eyes are fondly bent On strangers even in the village, 'Twere well to pack, my masters, packâ Forget the road, and ne'er come back! But if our fate is not to miss Some lovely slip among the brambles, Who pouts away the proffered kiss When resting from our woodland rambles, Let others trudge, my masters, trudgeâ Here's one wise fool who will not budge! A SONG OF THANKS Leaning from my window In the fragrant air Chantings morn and evening, Melodies I hear; For the beak that's yellow Sings me without fear Lyrics in the lilacs, Lyrics in the pear. In the roaring city Sparrows' voices lend Something of the country To the hearts that spend Season after season There, and never hear Blackbirds in the apple, Blackbirds in the pear. But my orchard yonder Is an orchestra; Birds and leaves and breezes Make in concert there Music of enchantment Country folks may hear, Lyrics in the plum-tree, Lyrics in the pear. THE TRAVELLER'S SONG Whilst Laura lingers by my side With all her woman's help and graces, Nor ever is the look denied She pours upon our children's faces, Equal to Fate my soul shall proveâ Sirs, take my pence, but not my love! But if her whims and altered brow Should stifle joy, and tart responses Be fruit of faith and marriage vow, Or blows bethump the youngsters' sconces, Come, pleasant chance, to lure her henceâ Sirs, take my love, but not my pence! LAST WORDS Of you, dear friends, who come to tend A dying man with final love, I ask but thisâthat none may seek Me purer than I was to prove. Strive not with anxious pen to make Some follies pose as good and sage; Nor with the knife of tenderness Scratch out the blots upon my page. Oh, as I lie and idly count The paper roses on the wall, Of all my eyes begin to see This is the clearest sight of allâ That sometimes when my chance was come To speak a helpful word and kind, My hasty tongue too often served The early promptings of my mind. If ever word of dying man Can long direct the friends who stay, Leave larger issues to your God, But trebly guard the instant day. The cultivation of your souls May warp you as you sit apart! March out into the light and heal (For all can heal) some broken heart. Think of yourselves as those in whom The gift of miracles is set; For in his circle each can work These miracles. Do not forget! So when you hide me in the earth, And put aside my vacant chair, Do not be prone to polish o'er The faults I pray you not to spare. But thinking clearly what I was, Review the history of my days, And if you smile on any deeds I may be grateful for your praise. Write:âHe had made a finer man And left increased renown behind, If he had only shut his books To read the chapters of mankind! For, prisoned 'mid his lexicons, He paced along a narrow way, His life contracting, till he grew Less human-hearted day by day. So when the chance of changing tears To brilliant smiles was lent to him, The mood was foreign from his mind, The energy was strangely dim. Wherefore upon his bed of death, His eyes with boundless vision wide, He ministered to other souls With wisdom until then denied; Knowing the crown of penitence Was not alone a vague regret, But rather, the activity Of teaching others to forget (Since a late learner, growing mute, May not remain to purge his heart) The cluster of remembrances That pander to the selfish part. Long was I careless of my path, Till Faith descended broad and bright; And looking out across the world I felt a spirit in the light, And in a forest-temple found The impulse of a great desire To rear an altar, and to burn My heart in sacrificial fire. But this was only yesterday, And ere you pluck my altered fruits The axe in Death's unswerving hands Is laid against my stronger roots! Yet I, if I have done aright, Though straying from the usual road, May meet with willing love to ease My shoulders of their heavy load, Howe'er it be, I go in peace, A man whose lips have been desired; A man who held his Love a space, Then lost her. I am very tired. L'ENVOI O mother, if the lyric god Have touched my lips with country song, Or if these simple airs are caught From Music as she sings along I care not, so their piping find A comfort for your heart and mind. O sweet for mothers growing old To know their boys approach success! And sweet for me if what I bring Can flood your face with tendernessâ Can well-nigh make you hear again Birds warbling in a Surrey lane.</field>
