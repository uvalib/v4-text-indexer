TO THE NINE FRIENDS WHO ACCOMPANIED ME TO PALESTINE, THIS RECORD OF A DELIGHTFUL TOUR, MADE MORE DELIGHTFUL BY THEIR UNVARYING KINDNESS AND PLEASANT SOCIETY, IS AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR. EGYPT. April 5. I. Egypt, whose birth hid in the ages lies, Could thy strange history be fully told, What wonders to the world would be unrolled! Who built thy Pyramids that grandly rise, Thy temples vast, colossal, in their size? Who carved the tombs where rest the great of old,â Heroes, and warriors, and statesmen bold, And sages who could read the starry skies? Gazing upon thy monuments, we seem To live within the years when thou wast great, Borne back upon Time's immemorial stream To ages past when thou didst bear the weight Of empire worthily,âthy power no dream,â But ruling kingdoms in most royal state. II. O dusky land, where Pharaohs lived and died, And shepherd-kings bore uncontested sway, And Memnon sweetly sang at break of day, Where the lone Sphinx o'erlooked the desert wide, And birds were worshipped, bulls were deified; Thy fascination never can decay, Thy memories, surviving change, abide; They have not passed, nor shall they pass away. Here Joseph lived midst evil, undefiled And Moses dared against a king to stand, And CÃ¦sar fought, and Cleopatra smiled, And fruitful Nile flowed through the arid sand. But dearer far, O Land, that Mary mild Found shelter in thee for the Holy Child. JUDEA. Blue hills of Judah rising from the plain, We gaze on you with eyes that yearn with love, As azure skies, without a speck or stain, With tenderness lean o'er you from above. I count it, O Jerusalem, a joy, A life's great privilege to gaze on thee; This hope I fondly cherished from a boy, And thou art now a very part of me. Thou art enthroned for ever in my mind, And blent with all that's strongest in my faith, For ever in my heart of hearts enshrined, A memory to hold my thoughts till death. How fair the vision opening on the eye, As coming from the East o'er Olivet, You see the grand old Haram wall arise From Kedron's gorge, o'er which 'tis proudly set. A city richer far than words can tell, In memories that set the soul on fire; No other spot on earth has such a spell To thrill the heart and satisfy desire. On this hoar mount He stood, and walked those streets Knelt in that garden, gazed upon that sky, In whom the manhood and the Godhead meets, Blended in one to all eternity. Sorrows are thine, supreme beyond compare, For that thy streets the Christ, rejected, trod, Who o'er thee wept tears of a great despair, Because He failed to win thee back to God. Yet Christian hearts will hold thee sacred still, And pilgrims flock to thee as to a shrine; And dear shall be each dale, each stream, each hill, Since here both lived and died the Christ Divine. Nor will I e'er despair of thee; the light Of the prophetic word breaks through my fears, And o'er the future sheds a rainbow bright Which spans the torrent of my flowing tears. âBeulahâ again shall be thy rightful name, Never shalt thou be called âforsakenâ more, And all the world shall gladden at thy fame, And echo sound thy praise from shore to shore. O Jesus, O Jerusalem, O God! O tenderness Divine, O human tears! O mercy deep as ocean, and as broad! O grace as boundless as the boundless spheres! Though Justice, Truth, and Righteousness Divine Are marked on mouldering tower and crumbling wall, Yet God's compassions judgment far outshine, As seen in tears from Jesu's eyes that fall. Christ! I would know Thee only by Thy grace, Thine infinite and all-embracing love; Oh, lift on me the shinings of Thy face, And give me foretaste of Thy heaven above! GETHSEMANE. Saturday, April 17. It is a place for solemn thought, for solemn thought and prayer, For bended knee, and humbled heart, head reverently bare; Here in Gethsemane's dark shade the Saviour knelt to pray, That if it were but possible the cup might pass away. This Garden saw the passion of God's Incarnate Son, Who came by toil and tears and death, to save a world undone; From His pale face great drops of blood fell down upon the earth, Where for the sinful souls of men He travailed sore in birth. Here take thy shoes from off thy feet, for this is holy ground; No spot so sacred on this globe from farthest bound to bound; Approach it with a heart subdued, and with a filial fear, A contrite spirit fitteth all who fain would enter here. The rapt apostle who in trance beheld a throne in heaven, Before which burned, like lamps of fire, the holy Spirits seven, Says there was silence half an hour before the face of God, And angels, prostrate near the throne, were stilled, subdued, and awed. So when the host of angels o'er the Passion Garden hung, No song was heard through heaven's courts, their harps were all unstrung; And every voice was hushed and still'd, no hymn or anthem heard, As in His great dire sweat of blood lay the Incarnate Word. He prayed, He wept with crying strong, and called on God above: Father,â He said in filial tones, of deep submissive love,â âFather, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me; Yet not as I, but as Thou wiltâas seemeth good to Thee.â Then to His lips He took the cup, its bitterest drops to drain, That none of Adam's sons might taste that draught of awful pain; That none the dread desert of sin might ever feel, or know The bitter anguish and the grief, the horror and the woe. O love Divine, so high, so deep, so boundless and so broad! O matchless love and measureless, so worthy of our God! Lo, in my heart stir mingled thoughts, some joyous and some sad, For sins remembered, sorrowful; for sins atoned for glad. Ah, sad to think that sins of mine should barb the thorns He wore; Ah, sad to know it was my guilt that pierced and stung Him sore; But sweet, surpassing sweet, to know that all sin is forgiven; Oh sweet, supremely sweet, to think for me He opened heaven. THE WAILING-PLACE OF THE JEWS. Friday, April 16. This is a place of wailing, wailing and bitter tears, Of mourning for the glory of the past and bygone years, When Zion sat in queenly pride, the joy of all the earth, And all the world in praises proclaimed aloud her worth. Alas! she now has fallen from her high and proud estate, And lieth widowed in the dust, discrowned, disconsolate, We weep for her in bitterness; we cannot choose but weep: Our sorrow for her sorrow is as true as it is deep. Oh, wasted with thy misery, despised and trodden down, The feet of Gentiles spurn thee, their hands tore off thy crown; A nation peeled and scattered, cast out, oppressed, forlorn,â A by-word and a hissing, a finger-mark for scorn; A people without country, a race without a home, Scattered like fragments of a wreck upon the ocean's foam; Without a king or altar, beneath a curse ye bow, And âIchabodâ in flaming fire is written on your brow. Wail on, wail on, O people; press your faces gainst the wall, And beat your breasts in anguish, and let the hot tears fall; Cry, cry aloud for mercy, force heaven's door by prayer; Give words to your great sorrow, voice to your deep despair. But as ye weep, inquire ye the cause of all your shame, The crime which stains your nation, brings a shadow on your name. Remember how Jerusalem rang with the awful cry, Which in a storm of murderous hate rose up to God on high, As your fathers haled the Nazarene to the shameful cross of wood: âOn us and on our childrenâon us, O God, His blood!â For this has judgment followed you through all the weary years, For this your God's rejection, man's scorn, your ceaseless tears. With wicked hands they crucified the Holy One and Just; Oh, clothe ye then in sackcloth, and sit down in the dust. Repent, believe, turn to the Christ, for yours the curse of Cain, God's righteous indignation, and man's pitiless disdain; Against you cries a Brother's blood, it rises loud and clear, It calls for vengeance on your head, and enters in God's ear. Oh! look to Him whom ye have pierced; oh! weep ye now and mourn, And surely God in mercy will to your lost race return. BETHLEHEM. Deep purple shadows veiled the earth, The sleeping world was still, Save where some shepherds watched their flocks, By valley, stream, and hill. The firmament was sown with stars, That shook and throbbed with light; And the great golden moon on high Shed radiance o'er the night. Amongst the ancient orbs of heaven Appeared a stranger star, That blazing in the Western sky Led wise men from afar; And on the forehead of the night It shone with lambent flame, To herald Him who for our weal In tender mercy came. For now the Virgin Mother held Upon her maiden breast, Her God, her Lord, the Prince of Peace, Hushed in a tranquil rest. No wonder that the Seraphim, In burning ranks of fire, Filled all the list'ning night with songs, In sweet harmonious quire. There rose a sudden burst of song, That thrilled along the air, And glowed the lambent skies at once With angel faces fair; A lustre crowned their radiant brows, Joy flashed from out their eyes, As with the splendour of their wings They cleft the midnight skies, âGlory to God,â they thus began The sweet and solemn strains; âGlory to God,â down swept the song O'er Bethlehem's holy plains, âGlory to God in highest heavens,â The world's great Lord and King; âPeace on the earth, good will to men,â Thus with one voice they sing. Never did song so sweet as this Float o'er the weary earth, Since sang for joy the morning stars Over this planet's birth, Since shouted all the sons of God, To holy rapture stirred, As they beheld a world rise up At God's creating word. O happy dawn of this great day! O first blest Christmas morn! Which unto men the message brought The Saviour Christ was born. Glad tidings of great joy indeed, None richer could be given, And none more welcome God Himself Could send to us from heaven. Lo! in this humble manger lies God's own incarnate Son! He comes to save from sin and death A world outcast, undone, Wisdom and love, and power divine, In that weak Babe you see; Eternal life with Him was born, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Shall angels chant a Saviour's birth, And sing to see Him come, And Christian hearts not burn with love, Or Christian lips be dumb? No! we will celebrate His name, And gladly hymn His praise; With hearts attuned to joy and bliss, We will the anthem raise. âGlory to God, to God on high;â This, this shall be our song, Till heaven shall catch the echo sweet, And earth the strain prolong; âGlory to God, and peace on earth, To sinful men goodwill;â Publish the tidings far and near, Till all the world they fill. âGlory to God, and peace on earth;â Spread this from pole to pole, And let the sounds from cast to west In waves of mercy roll. Let young and old, and rich and poor, Raise high their festal lay, And chant in grateful praise to God That Christ was born this day. CHRIST WEEPING OVER JERUSALEM. A mighty crowd down Olivet's green slopes Marches in triumph to the Holy Gate, A thousand tongues confirm the nation's hopes As Jesus, riding, comes in royal state. Jerusalem in sunshine lies aglow, Stirred to the heart to meet her coming King; While through her streets the surging people flow, And make the air with loud Hosannas ring. Men cut down branches from the feathery palms, And strew their garments on the dusty street; From women's throats there rise clear thrilling psalms, While children join their voices fresh and sweet. And so they bear Him onward to His crown, And march with tramp of freemen firm and strong, As though their feet trod Rome's proud eagles down In vengeance dire for many a deed of wrong. Oh, for His mother, what a glorious hour! For His disciples, what a day of pride! For now the Son and Master takes His power, And shall wield David's sceptre far and wide. This is the one brief triumph in His day, Across His troubled sky a transient gleam, A brilliant meteor, soon to pass away, A glittering bubble on the shining stream. He knows this well: that soon to bitter hate This show of love and reverence shall turn, And that in anger deep and passionate They'll drive Him forth with mockery and scorn. Like to some fickle child that takes its toy And dashes it in fury to the ground, Passing at once to hatred deep from joy,â So swift will be a people's mad rebound. So, as the eager crowd the city nears, A shadow passes o'er His thoughtful brow, And from His heart there well the burning tears, Which fill His eyes until they overflow. There beautiful in siteâjoy of all landsâ Fair Zion stretches out before His eyes, Each tower and temple in its beauty stands, Bathed in the glory of the mid-day skies. White marble palaces rise pure as snow, That shines on Salmon, or fair Hermon's height; And, yonder, cool Siloam's waters flow, Flashing and sparkling in the golden light. He pauses on the mountain's brow, and weeps, Gazing upon the city, all so fair, And o'er His God-like face a shadow creeps,â The tender sadness of Divine despair. âIf thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, E'en thou, the things belonging to thy peace, But now all hidden from thine eyes are theyââ His broken words are lost in sobs, and cease. For now from out the future's gathering gloom, Visions of horror rise to grieve His sight, With prescient eyes He sees the city's doom,â Its glory gone, and sunk in shades of night:â He sees contending factions, bitter feud,â The famished mother feeding on her child, The brother's hand in brother's blood imbrued, And hears the roar of battle rising wild: He sees proud CÃ¦sar thundering at the wall, Streets choked with festering bodies of the dead; Tall tower and temple tottering to their fall, O'ertaken by a judgment just as dread. And hence the pathos of the saddest cry That ever wailed up from a human heart, His anguish as the pageant passes by, The tears that to His eyes unbidden start. Ah, does the Saviour weep and sorrow still, O'er man's impenitence and reckless sin, The dark rebellion 'gainst His righteous will,â Weep that His mercy fails hard hearts to win? Forbid it, Lord, that I should cause Thee pain, Deny Thee, or renounce Thee to Thy face, Afresh should crucify Thee, or again Put to an open shame Thy matchless grace. Here where Thou wept, I give myself to Thee, Here in the city blessed by love Divine; I would Thy child, disciple, servant be, Body, and soul, and spirit wholly Thine. Jerusalem, April 17, 1886. AT BETHEL. Wednesday, April 21. Oh, let me sleep where Jacob slept And dreamed of bliss and heaven, Where angel forms around him swept, And watch and ward God o'er him kept Upon that tranquil even. Let me in dreams ascend to-night And pass the golden door Where dazzling visions meet the sight, And seraphs flash on wings of light Across the crystal floor. That I to heavens of love might soar, And night become so dear That I might wish 'twould ne'er pass o'er, But hold me tranc'd for evermore, And I to wake should fear. There holy anthems ever sweep The courts of heaven along In harmonies subdued and deep, There hearts ne'er ache, and eyes ne'er weep, And all is light and song. But though I may not yet attain The world for which I crave, This world shall ne'er my heart enchain With bonds of pleasure or of gain, Or be my spirit's grave. My thoughts, O God, shall all be there Where, with a raptured eye, Jacob upon that night so fair Saw angels mount the starry stair That leadeth to the sky. Jesus my ladder I shall make, By Him shall I ascend; And when from deathly sleep I wake, And when the morning bright shall break, That dream shall never end. NAZARETH. April 25, 1886. I. A city girdled by the mountains steep, Which open like the petals of a rose Which to the summer all its beauty shows, Down to its crimson heart that lies so deep 'Midst the sweet leaves which rise around to keep And safely guard it from approach of foes,â So these green hills fair Nazareth enclose, And fold it as a shepherd folds his sheep. But 'tis not beauty that this town endears, This rather,âChrist dwelt here from Boy to Man; That here He lived unknown for thirty years, Repressed Himself as only the greatest can, And as the weeks and months in silence ran, Prepared Himself for pain, and blood, and tears. II. Mysterious years! We know what might have been; For when within the Temple's holy ground He by His troubled parents late was found, He but a boy who just twelve years had seen, Fronted the doctors with a brow serene, And all His words were with such wisdom crowned That scribes and Pharisees who gathered round, Astonied gazed upon the wondrous scene. He might have shown His greatness, yet was still, Strange wonders might have wrought to win men's praise, And deeds that were with Godhead all ablaze, For heaven and earth were subject to His will; But self-restrained He lived in hidden ways, Wishful alone God's purpose to fulfil. GALILEE. April 23. This is the place. Here on this strand He left His footsteps in the sand, Here walked the waters of the sea That laves thy shores, O Galilee, And waves grew still at His command. Here to His little faithful band He spake of truths sublime and grand, And opened up eternity. This is the place. Thrice happy are mine eyes to see The ground once trod by Deity: This is to me enchanted land, At Heaven's gate I seem to stand; I bow the head, I bend the knee. This is the place. THE LAKE OF GALILEE. Fair Lake, whose sapphire waters lave a shore Holy as any in this Holy Land, 'Twill be a sacred joy for evermore, That I have stood upon thy shell-strewn strand. On many a ruined shrine and fallen tomb, The gorgeous flower in wild profusion grows, âBlood drops of Christ,â and cyclamen's pale bloom, And amaryllis blue their sweets disclose. The oleander near the water's brink Makes thee its mirror, beautiful and calm; And lo, the wave reflects the glowing pink Of blossoms filling all the air with balm. Birds hover near the shore with plumage bright, Amber, or blue, or striped with crimson bars; Some like winged jewels, purple as the night, But night when shining with a thousand stars. And here grow fragrant lilies of the field, Nourished on dews, and sunshine, and sweet air, Whose inner meanings were by Christ unsealed, And from them taught a loving Father's care. Here on this lake when rushed the sudden storm, And angry winds blew fiercely at their will, Christ rose majestic with commanding form, And to the tossing billows said, âBe still.â Then at His word the waters were a glass, To catch the glories of the upper sphere, And mirror all the planets as they pass, And be a second heaven, all calm and clear. On yonder hill 'neath stars and planets bright, While slept the silver lake in peace below, He passed the watches of the lonely night, And His whole heart in prayer did overflow. At morn, amid those upland solitudes, When all the people gathered round to hear, He spake those high and sweet beatitudes, God's benedictions for the listening ear. Here came the rich, the sinful, with a cry For health, for pity, and for pardoning grace; And looking on them with a loving eye, He blessed them with the shinings of His face. Here the poor sinner from Magdala came, And, trembling, brought to Christ her guilt and fears, And in the tumult of her sin and shame, Wept bitterly, and washed His feet with tears; Then took the treasures of her golden hair, Erstwhile her crown, her glory, and her pride, Which men had praised when they had called her fair, And for her favours and her smiles had sighed; And wiped the tears that fell upon His feet, And broke her box of nard, and on His head Outpoured the ointment, precious, fragrant, sweet, Which through the chamber richest odour shed. She loathed her sin, and felt that she was vile, Yet to lie there was like a very heaven, For on her beamed the Saviour's pitying smile, As rang the words that told she was forgiven. So I would lie down in the very dust, Conscious of sin and my unworthiness, Yet filled with one great doubt-dispelling trust, That Thou, O Christ, wilt comfort and wilt bless. Tiberias, April 30. PALESTINE. Dear Palestine! There is no place That wins us with a charm like thine; Thou cradle of a noble race; Thou birthplace of the Man Divine: A land of glory and renown, Of all the earth the joy and crown! The mountains near Jerusalem Stand round about her strong and tall; They crown her like a diadem, They guard her like a massive wall; But o'er her hangs a pall of gloom, Symbol of judgment and of doom. Her sages once in wisdom taught, Here angels walked and talked with men, And glorious visions here were brought Within the reach of human ken; The rock became a springing well, And manna from the heavens fell. Hereâwondrous thought!âthe King of kings, For whom stars form a glittering train, And with whose praise all heaven rings, Whose voice restrains the boundless main, Was born, and lived, and wept, and died, Was mocked, and scourged, and crucified. Fair Carmel's excellence is gone, The Rose of Sharon blooms no more, The curse of barrenness rests on The hill so rich in days of yore; Burning for beauty, blight for bloom, For life, the silence of the tomb. O Land of Prophet, Priest, and King O Land of men inspired by God, O Land where Psalmists used to sing, And seers by solemn visions awed,â My heart grows sore to look on thee, And think of all thou used to be. Heroes and martyrs once fought here The mighty battles of the Lord, Nor ever counted life as dear, Nor quailed before the cruel sword; This but their wish, their one desire, To honour God, though 'twere by fire. A land of stones, with scarce a tree To lift on high its grateful shade,â Oh, say! can this the country be Where God Himself a Temple made? For all may see upon its brow, That âIchabodâ is written now. God's curse is seen from hill to strand; Beulahâwas this indeed its name? For now it wears a burning brand Of sorrow, misery, and shame; By Gentile feet 'tis trodden down,â Low lies in dust its ancient crown. Where are thy silvery olives now, Thy valleys standing thick with corn? Thy vines that clothed each terraced brow, Thy grapes more purple than the morn? And echo sadly answers, âWhere?â The land is desolate and bare. And is this Bethlehem, where the Star Flashed brightly in the Eastern skies, And brought the wise men from afar To hail the Child with wondering eyes, And lay down at His sacred feet Their gold, and myrrh, and incense sweet? O sons of Judah, once so blest, Inheritors of this fair land, Burns there no longing in your breast To wrest it from the Turkish hand? Or are the glories of your race Forgotten in its foul disgrace? Remember you the great of old, Who fought for altar and for throne, The patriot, hero, warrior bold, Who died that ye might hold your own? In story lives each honoured name: Is not your blood and theirs the same? Joshua, Gideon, Barak, all Who served their country and their God, Who rose at once at freedom's call And broke the strong oppressor's rod, Their names live on from age to age, Embalmed within the sacred page. And other heroes, valiant, strong, The prince of royal David's race, Great MaccabÃ¦us, who the wrong Done to the people did efface, And freed the land from every foe, The proud oppressor laying low. O lost to country and to home, O wanderers, scattered everywhere, Are ye content for aye to roam, As outcasts from this land so fair? Which now is trampled on, and sold, Although it bred your sires of old. Your names are great on 'Change, I own; Colossal fortunes you can make; All nations flock to you for loan; A kingdom's credit you can shake. Was it for this God chose your raceâ For this? The very thought is base. O God! 'tis time for Thee to work, Make bare Thine arm, arise in power, Drive from the Holy Place the Turk, And hasten on the promised hour; Firm as the heavens Thy word doth stand, Judah once more shall own this land. Thy wildernesses shall rejoice, Thy deserts blossom as the rose, The little hills lift up their voice To sing the end of Judah's woes,â Heard ringing all around shall be The voice of joy and melody. For briars shall spring forth the vine, The myrtle shall supplant the thorn, The vats shall overflow with wine, The valleys bristle all with corn; Rich copious showers shall fall again, The early and the latter rain. A crown of glory in God's hand Jerusalem shall be once more; A royal diadem the land, Whose praise shall reach from shore to shore; Her Holy Places be again A witness true for God with men. Speed on the time, O Lord, I pray; O come, and with Thee blessings bring; The glories of the latter day, The dawn of an Eternal Springâ When IsraÃ«l, as Thou hast said, Shall be to all life from the dead.
