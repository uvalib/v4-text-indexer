      <field name="fulltext">THE TITLARK'S NEST. A PARABLE. “Introite, nam et huic deii sunt.” Apud Gellium. 1 Where o'er his azure birthplace still the smile Of sweet Apollo kindles golden hours, High on the white peak of a glittering isle A ruin'd fane within a wild vine's bowers Muffled its marble-pillar'd peristyle; As under curls, that clasp in frolic showers A young queen's brow, her antique diadem's Stern grandeur hides its immemorial gems. 2 The place was solitary, and the fane Deserted save that where, in saucy scorn Of desolation's impotent disdain, The revelling leaves and buds and bunches born From that wild vine along a roofless lane Of mouldering marble columns roam'd, one morn A titlark, by past grandeur unopprest, Had boldly built her inconspicuous nest. 3 And there where girt by priests and devotees A god once gazed upon the suppliant throng, Wild foliage waved by every wandering breeze Now shelter'd one small bird; to whose lone song, Companion'd by no choral minstrelsies, An agèd shepherd listen'd all day long. Unlearn'd the listener and untaught the lay, But blithe were both in their instinctive way. 4 Thither once came a traveller who had read Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, and had all The terms of architecture in his head, Apophyge, and plinth, and astragal. He, from below, had in its leafy bed Spied out the carcass of an antique wall, Keen as, from heaven, the hovering condor spies Where, in the pampas hid, a dead horse lies. 5 “Pelasgian? Nought doth old Pausanias say About this ruin, and I find no plan Or note of it in learnèd Caylus; nay, I doubt not it was miss'd by Winckelmann. The prize is mine. No joke, this hot noon-day, To climb yon hill! But Science leads the van Of Enterprise; and now's the chance to shame The English Elgin's cheaply-purchased fame. 6 “Ho, you there, yonder in the bramble-bush!” The tired explorer to the shepherd cried, “A drachma for thy guidance, friend!” But “Hush!” The grey-hair'd herdsman of the hills replied. Then, pointing upward to the leafage lush That rippled round the ruin'd fane, with pride He added “Hark, where yonder leaves are swinging, The god's voice from his sanctuary singing!” 7 The traveller laugh'd. “'Tis a curruca small, The Orphea, I surmise, whose note we hear. Her nest is haply in yon temple wall. An earlier songstress she, and sings more clear, Than her small northern cousin whom we call Atricapilla Sylvia. But I fear, My worthy friend, we must not deem divine Each vagrant voice that issues from a shrine.” 8 “Yet,” said the old man, with a pensive smile, “I heard my mother tell when I was young (And she, Sir, was a daughter of this isle) How everything that's here had once a tongue, In the old times. Myself, too, many a while Have heard the streamlets singing many a song, And, tho' their language was unknown to me, The reeds were moved by it, as I could see. 9 “Sir, when I was a boy I pastured here My father's goats which now, Sir, are mine own. For he is underground this many a year, But he had lived his life, and Heaven hath shown Much goodness to us, and my children dear Are all grown up; and, musing here alone, Oft have I wonder'd ‘Could this temple break Long silence, in what language would it speak?’ 10 “Full sure was I that if it spoke to me, Whate'er its language, I should understand. Then, I was young: and now, tho' old I be, When sweet in heaven above the silent land That voice I hear, my soul feels glad and free, And I am fain to bless the god's command, With welcome prompt responding to the voice He sends from heaven to bid my heart rejoice. 11 “Ah, not in vain its message have I heard! And, Sir, tho' it may be, as you aver, The voice comes only from a little bird, Whose name, indeed, I never heard of, Sir, And tho' I doubt not aught by you averr'd, For you, Sir, seem a learnèd traveller, Yet still the temple that contains the song A temple is, and doth to God belong. 12 “And haply to the little bird I hear He may have said ‘I am myself too high For this poor man. Speak to him thou, speak clear, And tell him, little bird, that he may lie On consecrated ground and have no fear, But listen to thy messages, and try To understand.’ And I have understood, For when I listen, Sir, it does me good.” 13 “Humph!” said the traveller, “Worthy friend, live long Ere yet thy children lay thee underground! Pasture thy goats in peace, and may the song Of many a titlark make thee pleasant sound, Warbled all day thy cottage eaves among. Such simple songs where simple hearts abound Fit place may find, but not in halls where hoar Poseidon haply held high state of yore.” 14 “Ay, Sir, it is but right,” the old shepherd said, “The little bird should to the god give place Whenever he returns. But where is fled The sacred Presence that once deign'd to grace These lonesome haunts so long untenanted? Roam where you will, the sanctuaried space Is vacant, voiceless, priestless, unpossest, Save for the bird that in it builds her nest. 15 “Yet into this dead temple's heart hath flown A voice of life, and this else-silent shrine The bird whose nest is built in it hath known How to make vocal. Thro' the trembling vine Hark, the fresh carol! Till to claim his own The god returns in all his power divine, Still unforbidden let me hail the strain That haunts with living song the lifeless fane.” LEGENDS OF EXILE. FIRST SERIES. MAN AND WOMAN. “Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels.” Psalm viii. I. THE LEGEND OF POETRY. Adam and Eve, cast out of Paradise, Wander'd along the wilderness forlorn, Till all its unfamiliar sands and skies Were one dim solitude without a bourne. Then Eve, outwearied, sank upon the ground; And, where she fell, motionless she remain'd. Adam had climb'd a little barren mound A few steps farther. There he stood, and strain'd His backward gaze to the forbidden bound Of Eden. Still their banisht lord could see, Though faint in fading light, the happy bowers Where nevermore his fallen mate and he Might roam or rest, renewing griefless hours; And Adam groan'd. Meanwhile, unheard, unview'd, Jehovah's arm'd Archangel, from the gate He had shut forever, adown the solitude And darkness of that world all desolate The footsteps of the fugitives pursued. Sudden he stood by Adam's side, and said, “Man, thou hast far to go. It is not good To look behind thee. Forward turn thy head! Thither thy way lies.” And the man replied “I cannot.” “What thou canst thou knowest not,” The Archangel answer'd, “for thou hast not tried. But trial is henceforth Man's earthly lot, And what he must he can do.” Adam cried “What must I?” “Thou hast set aside God's word, But canst not,” said the Angel, “set aside Necessity; whose bidding, tho' abhorr'd, Obey thou must.” And Adam ask'd in awe “Is then Necessity another Lord?” The Angel answer'd “'Tis another Law.” “Another Law! But me thy sweeping sword Hath left not,” Adam mutter'd, “hap what may, Another Paradise to forfeit still. What if that other Law I disobey?” “Thou canst not,” sigh'd the Seraph, “for thy will Hath lost its freedom, which was yesterday A part of Paradise. For good or ill Necessity controls it. Wretch, thou art Weary already, and thou fain wouldst sleep, Yet sleep thou dost not, tho' thine eyelids smart With the unwilling vigil they must keep; 'Tis thy necessity to think and wake. To-morrow, thou wouldst wake and think. In vain! Slumber unwill'd thy thoughts shall overtake, And sleep thou shalt, tho' sleep thou wouldst not. Pain Thou wouldst avoid, yet pain shall be thy lot. Thou wouldst go forth—Necessity forbids, Chains fast thy weakness to one hated spot, And on thy shut wish locks her iron lids. Thou wouldst know one thing, yet shalt know it not. Thou wouldst be ignorant of another thing, Yet canst not choose but know it. Unforgot To thy reluctant memory shall cling What thou wouldst fain forget, forgotten fleet From foil'd remembrance on evasive wing What thou wouldst fain remember. Change or cheat Necessity, thou canst not.” Shuddering Adam crouch'd low at the Archangel's feet, And cried “Whate'er I must be, and whate'er I can be, aid, O aid me, to forget What I no longer may be! Even this bare Inhospitable wilderness might yet To unremembering eyes seem all as fair As Eden's self, nor should I more repine Were I once more unable to compare.” “Poor wretch,” the Angel said, “wouldst thou resign All that remains to thee of Paradise?” “Of Paradise is anything still mine?” Sigh'd Adam, and the Angel answer'd “Yes, The memory of it.” “Thence, ”he groan'd, “arise My sharpest torments. I should suffer less If I could cease to miss what I survive.” “Wouldst thou the gift, then, of forgetfulness?” The Seraph ask'd. And Adam cried, “Give! give!” With looks uplift, that search'd the deeps of heaven, Silent the Angel stood, till, as it were, In response from the source of glory given To that seraphic gaze, which was a prayer, Reörient thro' the rifted dark, and high O'er Eden, rose the dawn of such a day As nevermore man's mourning eyes shall bless With beauty that hath wither'd from his way, And gladness that is gone beyond his guess. The panting Paradise beneath it lay Beatified in the divine caress Of its effulgence; and, with fervid sigh, All Eden's folded labyrinths open'd wide Abysm within abysm of loveliness. Thither the Archangel pointed, and replied: “Adam, once more look yonder! Fix thine eye Upon the guarded happiness denied To the denial of its guardian law. Contèmplate thy lost Eden—the last time!” And Adam lifted up his face, and saw Far off the bowery lawns and blissful streams Of Eden, fair as in his sinless prime, And fairer than to love forbidden seems The long'd-for face whose lips in dreams requite Adoring sighs that, save in passionate dreams, Are disallow'd idolatries. Dark night Elsewhere above the lifeless waste was spread, As o'er a dead face the blindfolding pall. “Seest thou thy sinless past?” the Angel said. And Adam moan'd, “All, all! I see it all, And know it mine no more!” His helmèd head, As in obedience to some high command Deliver'd to him by no audible word, The Archangel bow'd. Then, with decisive hand, He seized and drew his formidable sword. Thro' night's black bosom burn'd the plunging brand; Two-edgèd fires, the lightnings of the Lord, Flasht from its fervid blade, below, above, And, where their brilliance thro' the darkness broke, Clear from the zenith to the nadir clove Man's sunder'd universe. At one dread stroke The Archangelic sword had hewn in twain The substance of Eternity. There ran The pang and shudder of a fierce surprise Thro' Adam's soul; and then he slept again As he had slept before, when he (likewise In twain divided—Man and Woman) began His double being. Upon the night-bound plain, In two vast fragments, each a dim surmise, Eternity had fallen—one part toward man, The other part toward man's lost Paradise. The light of Eden by its fall was crost, And in its shadow vanisht—save one gleam Of faintly-lingering glory that was lost In Adam's slumber, and became—A Dream. Adam had lost his memory by the stroke Of that celestial sword's transfixing flame, And so forgot his dream when he awoke. Yet did its unremember'd secret claim Release from dull oblivion's daily yoke In moments rare. He knew not whence they came, Nor was it in his power to reinvoke Their coming: but at times thro' all his frame He felt them, like an inward voice that spoke Of things which have on earth no utter'd name; And sometimes like a sudden light they broke Upon his darkest hours, and put to shame His dull despondency, his fierce unrest, His sordid toil, and miserable strife. These rare brief moments Adam deem'd his best, And call'd them all The Poetry of Life. II. THE LEGEND OF MUSIC. In that dread instant when Eternity Was by the Angel's sword asunder riven, There sounded from the starry deep a cry That shook the constellated poles of heaven: “Elohim! Elohim! what hast thou done, Whose sword hath hewn Eternity in twain? One part of it is now the Past, and one The Future (phantoms both, exempt from pain By lifeless unreality alone!) And the pang'd Present, like an open wound, Between them gapes, lest aught should close again What thou hast cloven.” To this poignant sound The Seraph, leaning on his sword down-slanted, Listen'd, and in compassion or disdain Smiled gravely, as he murmur'd “It is well. The Reign of Time begins, man's prayer is granted.” Then loud he call'd to the Abyss of Hell, “Stunn'd rebels, rouse your swooning hosts, and rise, Tho' thunder-smitten, from the Penal Pit! Time's ravageable realm wide open lies For your invasion, and the spoils of it To you no more Eternity denies. Find in its painful fields your pasture fit, Be every pulse of consciousness your prey, And chase the panting moment as it flies!” Hell to the invocation answer'd “Yea!” And, pour'd in surge on surge of flame-pulsed cries, The fervid rush of her Infernal Powers Sounded like roaring fire, tho' sightless they As midnight storms. “Eternity is dead! And Time, the quivering corpse of it, is ours! And from Eternity's death-wound,” they said, “Fast, fast, the life-drops fall—days, minutes, hours, Drop after drop, with world on world, away— Into the final nothingness at last! To-day sinks swooning into yesterday, The future disappears into the past. Eternity lies lost in what hath been And is no more, or in what is not yet; For all the rest is but a sigh between A hovering fear and a forlorn regret. And every moment but begins in vain A world that is with every moment ended; For broken is Eternity in twain, And never shall Eternity be mended.” This sullen pœan waked, where'er it went Around the rolling world, responsive sounds Of wrath and pain; as if all passions pent In some titanic soul had burst the bounds Of individuality, and blent Their personal essence with the mindless might Of universal forces. First, there came Ominous suspirations, tremours slight Of sleepy terror, from the shuddering pores And joints and sockets of earth's giant frame; Anon, Behemoth, bellowing, with fierce roars Shook all his chains. The mountains, rack'd and pang'd By earthquake, thunder'd from their fiery cores; From smitten crag to crag the cataracts clang'd; The sharp rain hiss'd; the ocean howl'd; the shores Shriek'd; and the woods tumultuously twang'd Their wailing harps. But what was felt and heard Thro' all that uproar's dissonant hurricane Was not the inarticulate noise alone Of winds and waves and woods and mountains stirr'd To screaming storm; there was a mystic strain Of spiritual agony, a tone Of conscious torment, mingled with the train Of those unconscious sounds,—the personal moan Of some invisible being's passionate pain. Wild as the roar of an uprooted world Wrench'd from its orbit, round the Dream of Man This swarm of demon discords roll'd and swirl'd. Thro' Adam's slumber, as it hurtled by, Its sounds were scatter'd; and his dream began Dimly to shape beneath his sleep-shut eye Weird wavering images that were, or seem'd, The echoes of those sounds made visible. So that to Adam's soul the dream he dream'd Was even as if on some vast curtain fell Troops of stupendous shadows in the glare Shed o'er it from a mighty furnace, lit Behind the back of one who, to his chair Fast chain'd, with wistful eyes peruses it, Wondering what sort of unseen beings are those Whose phantoms thro' the glory come and go: For of them nothing more the watcher knows Than the huge shadows they, in passing, throw Athwart the lurid curtain; nor whence flows The light those shadows darken, doth he know. Plato.—Republic. Book vii. Still smiled the Seraph. Slow, in circuit wide, Around the sphere of Adam's dream he drew The solemn splendours of his sword, and cried “Thus far, no farther!” The Infernal Crew In vain to storm that aëry circle tried, And round it hoarse their grovelling hubbub grew, Reluctantly beginning to subside In sullen howls and stifled bellowings. Then cried the Angel, “Waken, also, you That slumber in the silence of sweet things, Voices of Consolation! and pursue From hour to hour with your fond welcomings That promise fair the fleeting hours renew! Come hither from the hidden heavens that are Your homes on earth! Come, with the south winds, hither From rosy kingdoms of the Vesper Star! Come, with the sunrise, from the golden ether! Come with the cushat's goodnight coo, from bowers Bathed in the tender dews of eventide, Or with the hymn that to the matin hours The laverock sings in glory unespied! Ripple light music of the restless breeze Thro' murmurous haunts of sylvan oracles, And loose the secrets lisp'd by summer seas Into the husht pink ears of blushing shells! Come, with remember'd sounds of warbling stream, And whispering bough, from woodland cloisters! Come, Consolers! Enter here, and let the Dream That Man is dreaming be henceforth your home!” To this appeal the answer linger'd long, And not a sound upon the darkness stirr'd Save the faint moanings of the Demon Throng. But a strange note, not theirs, at length was heard, A single timorous note of distant song, Like the first chirrup of a callow bird. Then, one by one, from here and there, arose Clear in the far-off stillness of the night (As from the bosom of the twilight grows Star after star) a multitude of light But thrilling tones, a choral harmony Of silvery voices in symphonious scale; Whose heavenward anthem peal'd from sky to sky, As “Hail!” they sang, “Benignant Elohim, hail! The living soul of dead Eternity Thy rescuing sword hath free'd. From its dark prison Released at last, on pinions glorious Behold, that radiant Spirit is now arisen! And hark, how sweet the song it sings to us! How sweet the song, how fair the face! for fled The hovering frown erewhile its aspect wore, And lo, the frigid features of the dead Are flusht with spiritual life! No more Those eyes are cold, no more those lips are dumb, And ‘Fear no more,’ they sing, ‘to gaze on me! Ye call'd me Fate when I was frozen numb In the cold silence of Eternity, And then ye fear'd me: but my living home Henceforth is in the hearts of all who live. Fear me no more, then, for to you I come With an eternal gift that shall survive Fate's despot rule o'er Time's brief horoscope: Eternity is still the gift I give To all who trust me, and my name is Hope.’” And “Ave! ave!” sang the Voices. “Thee We welcome, holy Hope, that from afar Dost bring the promise of sweet things to be, Forever sweeter than all things that are! Born flying, thy fair flight thou canst not stop, But into the sad hearts it leaves behind Thou dost, in passing, from thy pinions drop One spotless plume that, cherisht, keeps in mind The dear remembrance of its passage. We, What can we give thee in return for this? Take at their best, to save them, take with thee Our sweetest joys, our holiest hours; whose bliss, To thy far kingdom borne away, shall be Better and brighter, holier still, and higher! Take also, Spirit of Eternity, What Time made ours, to make it thine—Desire!” Closer and clearer the sweet Voices grew, Borne floating on their own song's rhythmic stream, Flutter'd round Adam's slumber, downward flew, And settled in the bosom of his dream. “Rest there, Consolers!” the Archangel said, “And you, Disturbers, strive as you have striven, And thou—dream on, poor Dreamer!” Then he spread His spacious pinions, and return'd to heaven. Out of the depths of Adam's dream, and clear All round it, those Consoling Voices pour'd Pure strains of silver sound, that fill'd the sphere Traced by the circuit of the Angel's sword. The Demon Powers, resentful, roused again Their turbulent cohorts to the overthrow Of this melodious bulwark, but in vain; For there Hell's surges broke, and hoarse below Roll'd in tumultuary undertones Their weltering waves of passion and of pain, Goaded and groaning, as the smit sea groans When the storm's lash is on its livid mane. Those sounds were heard in Heaven; and, down the light Of all the listening stars, celestial streams Of song flow'd, mingling with the troubled flight Of their fierce tones—as, while the torrent screams, The calm moon, shining thro' a cloudless night, Belts his tost bosom with her tranquil beams. And all these Voices, with the sounds that were Their instrumental slaves,—the Voices sweet Of Man's Consolers, hymning praise and prayer, The Voices of the Passions of the Pit, Earth's dread disturbers, clarions of despair, And the pure Voices of the Stars—contending With one another, pour'd the importunate tide Of their sonorous strife, in strains ascending Beyond the visible spheres, to where it sigh'd About the elemental boundary wall Which never, to the other unseen side, The swarming senses that man's soul enthral May overpass. For shrouded there, serene And irresponsive to the strife of all The worlds of passion and of sense—unseen, Unheard—He dwells, Who is, and wills, and knows. And there, its clamour calm'd, its vehement play Of contradictions quench'd in the repose Of a sublime accord whose spacious sway Husht its wild course to an harmonious close, Slowly the sounding tumult died away. So, when all storms are spent, and Ocean's sleep Leviathan's loud voice invades no more, The wearied winds into the silent deep Drop the last echoes of his dying roar, And fold their heavy wings, and faintly creep To rest on some lone island's desert shore; Where the huge billows in low waves subside, And the low waves in rippling shallows cease, While the lull'd halcyon on the slumbrous tide Broods, and the breathing stillness whispers “Peace!” When Adam waked, the sounds that in his dream Dream-woven forms had worn still haunted him. Not only to have heard them did he seem, But even to have seen them, in a dim Indefinite world that of life's earthly scheme The phantom protoplast appear'd. For there Some bliss beyond possession was the prize Relentless wrestlers strove to seize or share; And o'er a battle-field of boundless size Hope and Desire with Terror and Despair, And Love and Faith with Hate and Doubt, contended; Importunately rolling to and fro, In restless contradiction never ended, A Yes reverberated by a No. Infinite longing, infinite resistance, Infinite turmoil! gaining now, now losing, And then again with passionate persistance Speeding the clamorous chase thro' vast, confusing, Inextricable mazes; but still ever, Beyond the strife of discords and the cry Of conflict, with inveterate endeavour, Tending towards a far off harmony. And MUSIC was the name the dreamer gave To that dream-world's mysterious sounds. In vain, However, for long years did Adam crave To hear, in this world, that world's sounds again. And everywhere on earth he sought to find Or fashion images that might express The echoes of them lingering in his mind, But nought resembled their mysteriousness. His sons grew up. Memorial words they wrote On sun-dried river-reeds in cunning rhymes, Or graved them on the rocks, that men might note Who went before them in the after times. He praised their scripture, but he shook his head. “The higher language still lies out of reach, And sweet your rhymes, my sons; but, ah!” he said “They are not music, only sweeter speech.” His sons took clay, and kneaded it with skill Into the images of beasts, and men, And gods. But “Music,” Adam murmur'd still “In form alone I find not.” Colour then To form they added—colour squeezed and ground From herbs and earths—and pictures rich they wrought Of man, his doings, and the world around. But not in these was found what Adam sought. “Things seen and known,” he said, “they mimic well, But all things known and seen are, I surmise, Themselves but pictures of invisible, Or echoes of unheard, infinities. Definite are words, forms, and colours, each: Music alone is infinite.” And none Of Adam's offspring understood that speech, Save Jubal only. Jubal was the son Of Lamech, whose progenitor was Cain. His life's ancestral consciousness of death Stretch'd each sensation to a finer strain; Into his listening ear earth's lightest breath An infinite mystery breath'd; in every sound That mystery sent a message to his soul; Nor could he rest till definite means he found Its messengers to summon and control. And what he sought by wistful ways unnumber'd, Searching, at last he found in things where long Had Music on the breast of Silence slumber'd, Waiting his summons to awake and throng The bronzen tubes he wrought with stops and vents, Or shells with silver lute-strings overlaid. When Jubal play'd upon these instruments A visionary transport, as he play'd, Rose in each listener and reveal'd to him The beauty and the bliss of Paradise, The songs and splendours of the Seraphim. Albeit these transports from a mere device Of wind-blown pipes in order ranged arose, Or strings that, smitten, render'd response sharp. And Jubal was the father of all those Whose hand is on the organ and the harp. III. THE LEGEND OF LOVE. Eve had heard all, but nothing had she seen: For, ere the Archangel's sword was drawn, dividing The oneness of Eternity, between The gates of Eden fraudulently gliding, Athwart the wilderness the Snake slid near. And, where beneath the weight of one day's ill Fallen she lay, into the woman's ear He whisper'd, “Look not! utter not! lie still!” Eve heard, and at his bidding still she lay, Nor look'd, nor utter'd. In the woman's eyes Thus linger'd a reflection of what they Last look'd on ere she closed them—Paradise. For all the Archangel's weapon shore away From Man's perception was what lay before The gaze of Adam when that sword's sharp ray (Rending his cloven consciousness in twain) Parted the Present from the Past. But o'er The loveliness that in their looks had lain When last on Eden from afar she gazed, The lids of Eve were fallen ere (for bane Or blessing) Adam's granted prayer erased For ever from the records of his brain Each memory of Paradise. And there, In Eve's shut eyes whate'er on earth is left Of Eden—faint reflections of it, fair Fallacious phantoms of a bliss bereft Of all reality—escaped the stroke That from remembrance all the rest dispell'd. So Adam in Eve's eyes, when he awoke, Vague semblances of Paradise beheld; And that lost gleam of Eden's light that still Dreamlike and dim in his own being dwelt Responded to them with a mystic thrill, Tho' Adam understood not what he felt. And still Eve's daughters in their looks retain Those mirror'd mockeries their mother's eyes Bequeath'd them, tho' the Paradise they feign Is now a long-forbidden Paradise. Reveal'd in Woman's gaze Man seems to see The wisht-for Eden he hath lost. He deems That Eden still in Woman's self must be, And he would fain re-enter it. His dreams Are kindled, by the mystic light that lies In these sweet looks, to fervid wishfulness; And, missing what he ne'er hath known, he sighs For what, itself, is but a sigh—the bliss Which there he seeks, and there is lost again. No more, O nevermore, those steps of his, Whose progress is but a progressive pain, The Paradise they seek may reach and rove! Yet still the search is sweet, albeit in vain; It lasts for ever, and men call it Love. IV. THE LEGEND OF THE IDEAL. When, at the archangelic bidding (blest With one brief vision of his happy past In all the lost delights of Eden drest) Adam on Paradise had look'd his last, There every form of loveliness beloved Whose beauty, dear to his adoring eye, Had breathed delight thro' all the haunts of yore, And clothed in gladness all the days gone by, The man beheld, save one. For Eve no more Among the abandon'd bowers of Eden moved. Eden was Eveless. Thus, Man's memory Of Woman as in Paradise she was The archangelic sword had not transfixt. This memory made in Adam's mind, alas, A visionary image, vaguely mixt With that stray glimpse of Eden's light that fell Into his slumber, and became a dream, The dream of Adam's life. And there, too well Remember'd, with her beauty's phantom gleam Mocking him, moved the Eve of Paradise; Immeasurably fairer than the Eve That walk'd by Adam's side with sullen sighs And faded cheek—condemn'd, like him, to grieve And to grow old; like him, to brave the bleakness Of life's long desert; and, with him, to share The weight of many a burden, borne in meekness Or borne in bitterness, still hard to bear; An earthly woman, with a woman's weakness, A woman's faults. That phantom, faultless fair, (The unforgotten Eve of Paradise, Beautiful as he first beheld her there, Ere any tear had dimm'd her glorious eyes) Long after Paradise itself had been By him forgotten, haunted Adam's gaze. And Adam made comparison between The faithful partner of his faultful days, Who stray'd, and sinn'd, and suffer'd by his side, And that imagined woman. With a sigh, Her unattainable beauty, when he died, Adam bequeath'd to his posterity, Who call'd it The Ideal. And Mankind Still cherish it, and still it cheats them all. For, with the Ideal Woman in his mind, Fair as she was in Eden ere the Fall, Still each doth discontentedly compare The sad associate of his earthly lot; And still the Earthly Woman seems less fair Than her ideal image unforgot. And Adam slept and dream'd and waked again From day to day, from age to age. Apace Time trod his self-repeating path. To Men Man grew, and Adam became Adam's Race. The Race of Adam, by his granted prayer Born as it was oblivious of life's source, Went onward, lighted only here and there And now and then, along its eyeless course, By visionary flashes brief and rare Of unexplain'd remembrance, that appear'd Vague prescience. For the goal whereto Man goes Is his recover'd starting-point—tho', rear'd In a profound forgetfulness, he knows No longer whence or whither winds the track His steps have enter'd, and so lives like those Who, dreaming, dream not that sleep leads at last To waking, that to wake is to come back, And that what seems the Future is the Past. But round that Ghost of Human Loveliness Which over Human Life's unlovely way Hover'd afar, evading the caress It still invoked, the reminiscent ray Of Eden's glory (lost in Adam's Dream And mingled with his soul) so shone and glow'd, That on Man's spirit the reflected gleam Of its divine effulgence oft bestow'd A supersensuous potency of sight, Piercing, without an effort of his will, The Universal Veil that dims the light Of Universal Truth. A teeming thrill Of recognition thro' his senses ran From things that power reveal'd to him: and he To Nature cried, “Behold thy missing plan! For is not this what thou hast tried to be?” Whereto, from all her conscious deeps, to Man Nature responded, “Yes!” In toil and pain At other times, by other ways, Man's wits Search after knowledge, but can ne'er attain The flying point that on before him flits. For he is as a voyager in vain Sailing towards horizons that recede From phantom frontier lines of sky and main, With furtive motion measured by the speed Of their pursuer. But wherever shines That sudden ray of reminiscence rare, There, and there only, the convergent lines Of the orb'd Universe shut fast, and there Man's knowledge rests, untravell'd, at the goal. For, be it ne'er so trivial, ne'er so mean, The one becomes the All, the part the Whole, When, thro'them both, what each conceal'd is seen. And age by age, man after man essaying To fix for endless worship and delight, In shrines of permanence for ever staying, These gleams of truth for ever taking flight, Men fashion'd forth new forms of Time and Space, Idealising both. The work they wrought In Space was Beauty, and in Time 'twas Grace. These two ideals everywhere they sought; But the ideal human form and face Were still the fairest, still the loveliest. And still thro' human action, human thought, And most of all thro' human love, men's quest With fondest fervour roams to find the sphere Of that Ideal World wherein the part Includes the Whole, the one the All. For there Men are to Man transform'd, and life to Art. SECOND SERIES. MAN AND BEAST. “Thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field.” Psalm viii. I. THE LEGEND OF THE ELEPHANT. One day when Adam, as he dug the ground, Lifted his forehead to wipe off the sweat That dript upon his labour, gazing round He saw (and at that sight his fear was great) A mountain moving toward him. Sore afraid, Adam fell prostrate and began to pray. For every time that Adam fear'd he pray'd, And every thing he fear'd he worshipt. Grey And great, this formidable mountain made Gravely along the plain its gradual way, Till over Adam hover'd its huge shade. Then, in a language lost for ever and aye, The Mountain to the Man, reproachful, said— “Dost thou not know me, Adam?” “Mountain, nay,” The Man replied, “nor did I ever see A mountain move, as thou dost. Yesterday I met a mountain, but 'twas unlike thee, Far larger, and it lay athwart my track, Nor moved altho' I bent to it my knee, So on I pass'd over the mountain's back. Was that a sin? So many sins there be! And art thou come to punish it, alack, By marching on mine own back over me?” “Adam,” the Mountain answer'd him, “arise! Not at my feet thy place is. Whence this dread? Alas, when we were still in Paradise Fast friends were we.” But Adam hung his head, And mutter'd, “Friends? I know not what that is. Why dost thou persecute me, and pursue? Is Paradise a wilderness like this? I know it not, and thee I never knew.” “Well didst thou know me once, when we were there,” The Mountain answer'd, “nor canst thou deny 'Twas thou who gavest me the name I bear.” But Adam, crouching, cried, “It was not I! I never gave thee anything at all. What wouldst thou? worship? sacrifice? roots? grain? Take, and begone! Mountain, my store is small.” And sullenly the savage turn'd again To the hard labour of his daily lot. By this the pitying Elephant perceived That Adam in the desert had forgot His happier birthplace. The good beast was grieved; And “Those,” he said, “whom thou rememb'rest not Remember thee. We could not live bereaved Of thy loved presence, and from end to end Of Eden sought thee. When thou didst not come We mourn'd thee, missing our great human friend, And wondering what withheld him from his home. I think the fervour of our fond distress Melted the battlements of Paradise. They fell, and forth into the wilderness We came to find thee. For who else is wise As thou art? and we hold thee great above Our greatest. Why hast thou forsaken us For this drear desert? Was not Eden best? Unsweet the region thou hast chosen thus! Yet less forlorn than loss of human love Hath left the bowers by love in Eden blest. So where thou dwellest shall our dwelling be, Since joy from Eden went when thou wert gone, And where thou goest we will go with thee. To tell thee this the others sent me on.” Adam look'd up alarm'd, and trembling cried, “What others? Then I am indeed undone! More Elephants like thee?” The beast replied, “Alas, hast thou forgotten everyone Of thine old followers, the blithe beasts that were Thy folk in Paradise? which for thy sake We have abandon'd, and are come to share Thy labour, and near thine our lodging make. For Man completes us all, whate'er we be, And to his service faithfully we pledge Our several forces. Leaves unto the tree They garment, feathers to the wing they fledge, Wings to the bird they bear, and hands to thee, Belong not more than we for Man were made. So if thou sufferest we will suffer too, And if thou toilest we thy toil will aid, And we will be thy loving servants true, And thou shalt be our master.” Adam said Nothing. A mist that, melting, turn'd to dew Was in his eyes. He could not speak a word. That wretched savage grovelling in the dust, Whose rebel will had disobey'd the Lord, Whose coward heart had lost both love and trust, Whose dull despair had from his blinded eye Effaced the Past, and to the Present left Nothing but degradation utterly Of nobler reminiscences bereft, What could he answer? Nothing did he say; But sank down silent on the desert earth, And, sinking, flung the rough-hewn flint away, Wherewith he had been digging its hard dearth. Then closer to the gentle beast he crept, And hid his face between his hands, and wept. II. THE LEGEND OF THE ASS. The Elephant then lifted up on high His waving trunk, and trumpeted a clear Sonorous summons. With responsive cry To that glad signal, all the beasts drew near, And stood round Adam who was weeping still. Not one faint word of welcome did he say; But all to comfort him employ'd their skill, And each beast gave him some good gift. For they, When forth from Paradise they went to find Its unforgotten lord, had brought away As many of the treasures left behind By Man as each could carry. So that day (Thanks to the beasts, who had preserved them) he Some precious fragments of himself at length Recover'd, and became in some degree Human again. Proud consciousness of strength The Lion gave him. Honesty of heart The Dog. A vigilance that's never dull The Lynx bestow'd. The Beaver brought him art, The Eagle aspiration. Tenderness The Dove contributed, the Elephant Benign sagacity, the Fox address. He gain'd a sturdy courage from the Bull: And, all combining to supply Man's want, Each beast and bird in tribute bountiful, Gave Adam something he had lack'd before. He took whate'er they gave him, and began, As gift by gift he gather'd up the store, Slowly to feel himself once more a man. One beast there was who let the others pass, Each with his tributary offering, Before him, patiently. It was the Ass. And when his turn came some good gift to bring, He seem'd to look for something in the grass, But did not offer Adam anything. Caressingly, like an importunate child, Adam approach'd the Ass, whose shaggy head He fondled. “Gentle are thy looks and mild, Hast thou not brought me any gift?” he said. The Ass replied, “My gift is all unfit To offer thee.” Adam was vext, and frown'd. The Ass resumed “I am ashamed of it, Although in Paradise this gift I found. No other beast to take it had a mind, And if I had not pick'd it from the ground I think it would have there been left behind.” The Man heard this not wholly without shame; But still he answer'd from a greedy heart, “No matter! give it to me, all the same.” Then said the Ass, “If of a mind thou art To share with me mine all, I do but claim To keep a portion of it. Choose thy part” And in two parts he portion'd it. But those Two parts appear'd unequal. With the zest Of selfishness, Man, naturally, chose The biggest, thinking it must be the best. But Adam, as his wont it was, chose wrong For what the Ass (with a prophetic sense Perchance of his own need of it ere long) Had saved from Eden was Benevolence. When thus partition'd between Man and Beast, Benevolence its primal beauty lost; And Adam's portion proved to be the least Benignant, tho' he fancied it the most. This fraction of Benevolence began, When mingled with Man's character, alas, To be Stupidity; and, scorn'd by Man, 'Tis Patience that has rested with the Ass. III. THE LEGEND OF THE DEAD LAMBS. Death, tho' already in the world, as yet Had only tried his timorous tooth to whet On grass and leaves. But he began to grow Greedier, greater, and resolved to know The taste of stronger food than such light fare. To feed on human flesh he did not dare, Till many a meaner meal had slowly given The young destroyer strength to vanquish even His restless rival in destruction, Man. Meanwhile, on lesser victims he began To test his power: and in a cold Spring night Two weanling Lambs first perish'd from his bite. The bleatings of their dam at break of day Drew to the spot where her dead Lambkins lay The other beasts. They, understanding not, In wistful silence round that fatal spot Stood eyeing the dead Lambs with looks forlorn. Adam, who was upon the march that morn, Missing his bodyguard, turn'd back to see What they were doing; and there also he Saw the two frozen Lambkins lying dead, But understood not. At the last he said, “Since the Lambs cannot move, methinks 'twere best That I should carry them.” So on his breast He laid their little bodies, and again Set forward, follow'd o'er the frosty plain By his bewilder'd flocks. And in dismay They held their peace. That was a silent day. At night he laid the dead Lambs on the grass. That night still colder than the other was, And when the morning broke there were two more Dead Lambs to carry. Adam took the four, And in his arms he bore them, no great way, Till eventide. That was a sorrowful day. But, ere the next, two other Lambkins died, Frost-bitten in the dark. Then Adam tried To carry them, all six. But the poor Sheep Said, “Nay, we thank thee, Adam. Let them sleep! Thou canst not carry them. 'Tis all in vain. We fear our Lambkins will not wake again. And, if they wake, they could not walk—for see, Their little legs are stiffen'd. Let them be!” So Adam left the Lambs. And all the Herd Follow'd him sorrowing, and not a word Was spoken. Never until then had they Their own forsaken. That was the worst day. Eve said to Adam, as they went along, “Adam, last night the cold was bitter strong. Warm fleeces to keep out the freezing wind Have those six Lambkins thou hast left behind; But they will never need them any more. Go, fetch them here! and I will make, before This day be done, stout garments for us both, Lest we, too, wake no more.” Said Adam, loth To do her bidding, “Why dost thou suppose Our Lambs will nevermore have need of those Warm fleeces? They are sleeping.” But Eve said, “They are not sleeping, Adam. They are dead.” “Dead? What is that?” “I know not. But I know That they no more can feel the north wind blow, Nor the sun burn. They cannot hear the bleat Of their own mothers, cannot suffer heat Or cold, or thirst or hunger, weariness Or want, again.” “How dost thou know all this?” Ask'd Adam. And Eve whisper'd in his ear, “The Serpent told me.” “Is the Serpent here? If here he be, why hath he,” Adam cried, “No good gift brought me?” Adam's wife replied, “The best of gifts, if rightly understood, He brings thee, and that gift is counsel good. The Serpent is a prudent beast; and right! For we were miserably cold last night, And may to-night be colder; and hard by Those dead Lambs in their woolly fleeces lie, Yet need them not as we do. They are dead. Go, fetch them hither!” Adam shook his head, But went. Next morning, to the beasts' surprise, Adam and Eve appear'd before their eyes In woollen fleeces warmly garmented. And all the beasts to one another said, “How wonderful is Man, who can make wool As good as Sheep's wool, and more beautiful!” Only the Fox, who snift and grinn'd, had guess'd Man's unacknowledged theft: and to the rest He sneer'd, “How wonderful is Woman's whim! See, Adam's wife hath made a sheep of him!” IV. THE LEGEND OF EVE'S JEWELS. From that day forth Eve eyed with tenderness The Serpent, to whose craft she owed her dress. But “More,” he whisper'd in her ear one day, “Thou still mayst owe me, if it please thee. Say, Wouldst thou be fair?” The woman smiled, “Behold me! Am I not fair already?” “Who hath told thee That thou art fair?” the Serpent ask'd. Again Eve smiled, and answer'd, “Adam.” “Ah, but when?” He ask'd. And, this time sighing as she smiled, She said, “Before the birth of our first child.” “I thought so,” said the Serpent. “Long ago!” Eve's eyes grew tearful. She replied, “I know It was but yesterday I chanced to trace Reflected in a mountain pool the face That he had praised; and I was satisfied That certainly, unless the water lied, Adam was right.” “Was right,” the Serpent said, “So was last summer sweet.” “Doth beauty fade?” Eve murmur'd. “Ay, with youth,” said he. “And thou Canst make me young again?” “Not that. But how, When young no more, to make thee fair again I know a way.” “What way?” said Eve. “Explain!” “It is,” he answer'd, “by adorning thee.” “And what wouldst thou adorn me with?” said she. “Myself!” he whisper'd. Then the Serpent roll'd His ruby-colour'd rings and coils of gold Around the form of Eve: her neck enlaced, And was a necklace; girt her pliant waist, And was a girdle; with elastic bound Above her knee his wistful clasp enwound, And was a garter; with repeated twist Of twinkling chain entwined her tender wrist, And was a bracelet. Last of all, her brow He crown'd, and cried, “Man's Queen, I hail thee now!” Eve blusht. The sense of some new sexual power Unknown to all her being till that hour, Within it kindled a superb surprise. Back, with half-open'd lips and half-shut eyes, She lean'd to its rich load her jewell'd head. And at her ear again the Serpent said, “By the bright blaze of thine adornment, see What in the years to come thy sex shall be! Mere female animal, much weaker than The male its master, not the Queen of Man, Scarce even his mate, that sex was born; but more Than it was born shall it become. Such store Doth in it lurk of secret subtilty, Such seed of complex life, as by-and-by Shall grow into full Woman; and, when grown, The Woman shall avenge, tho' she disown, The Female, her forgotten ancestress. Mother of both, my glittering caress Now wakes beneath thy bosom's kindled snow Whole worlds of Womanhood in embryo! A penal law controls Man's fallen state. It's name is Progress: and, to stimulate That progress to its destin'd goal, Decay, Woman, with growing power, shall all the way Its course accompany—from happiness And ignorance to knowledge and distress; From careless impulse to contrived device; From spontaneity to artifice; From simple to sophisticated life; From faith to doubt, and from repose to strife. Whilst, still as Progress doth its prey pursue, The weaker shall the stronger-born subdue, Man subjugating first those monsters grim Whose strength is more than his; then, Woman him; Tho' he born weaker than most beasts, and she Born weaker even that man's own weakness, be. So shall the Feminine Force that set him on Still keep him going till his course be done. Far hath he yet to travel his long way, But thou hast started him. And on the day He lost that Paradise he ne'er had won, Here was his progress, thanks to thee, begun. That was Man's first step forward. I perceive He (thanks again to thee) is on the eve Of yet another. Good advice to him Thou gavest, whence he got his winter trim, So warm and stout. But at that fleecy coat The beasts, his unprogressive friends, I note, Begin to look suspiciously askance. And thence do I predict his next advance. 'Twixt Man and Beast the inevitable strife Must needs enforce 'twixt Man and Man a life More artificial. And therefrom shall rise The Future Woman; form'd to civilize, Corrupt, and ruin, raise, and overthrow Cycles of social types that all shall owe To her creative and destructive sway Their beauty's blossom, and their strength's decay. Behold, then, in thyself the primal source Of Human Progress, and its latest force! For, since from thee shall thy fair daughters, Eve, A subtler sex than all thy sons receive, Their beauty shall complete what thine began, Thou crown'd Queen Mother of the Queens of Man!” V. THE LEGEND OF FABLE. With many a plume and tuft of brilliant dye, And blushing berries twined in belt and tress, Eve on her clothing had begun to try What ornament could add to usefulness From day to day. But, as the days went by, The more she prized her borrow'd charms, the less She loved their owners who, approving not Those pilfer'd splendours, with resentful eye Beheld them all. For out the secret got, How from the bodies of the dead were torn The garments Eve and Adam gloried in: And to the beasts, who were as they were born, It seem'd a scandal and a sort of sin That their own wool and fur should thus be worn By limbs not theirs. “Let each defend his skin!” They said to one another. In those days There was a little animal Eve yet Loved passing well; for it had pleasant ways, Was smooth, and soft, and sleek, and seem'd to set A grateful store on her capricious praise. Curl'd in her lap 'twould nestle without fear, And let her stroke its back and bosom white, Until to Eve this beast became so dear That in its confidence she took delight. But, when the Herd discover'd that her dress Was stolen from their plunder'd kith and kin, Eve's little favourite fear'd each fresh caress Her hand bestow'd on it, and felt within Its frighten'd heart a sharp mistrustfulness, For “If she took a fancy to my skin?” The creature mused. And ever from that date Its thoughts and looks were all alert to find Some means whereby it might escape the fate Whose horrid prospect hover'd vague behind Eve's fondling fingers. Once, when peering round, Inquisitively careful to explore All nooks and corners till such means were found, It spied a heap of fish-bones on the floor. Then, from Eve's lap down-sliding to the ground, It roll'd itself among them o'er and o'er Till it became a Porcupine. And “How To guard my skin,” it chuckled, “nevermore Need I henceforth take any pains, for now My skin it is that will henceforth guard me!” So in this unapproachable condition Secure it lived: for its security Was even the same as Man's was—Arm'd Suspicion. Suspicion everywhere! No peace could be On earth henceforth. To war suspicion led. Long ages is it since that war began, And seas of blood have been on both sides shed, Yet still it lasts. In servitude to Man Some captived beasts survive. The Dog is one. But, just because the Dog to Man is true, From his approach his former comrades run, Deeming him traitor to their cause. Some few (The fiercest and the savagest alone) An intermittent and unequal strife Around their dens in desert lands pursue, And they and Man are enemies for life. Nor they and Man alone: for, confidence Once gone, the beasts upon each other prey'd Like beasts, without the plausible pretence Of good intentions by Man's nature made For his bad doings in the grim campaign 'Twixt him and them. This so revolted her, That Justice from the world-wide battle-plain Fled blushing. Pity's flight was tardier: But, after lingering long in vain appeal From heart to heart, she follow'd Justice too, Where only bloodstains left behind reveal The paths whereby she fled from mortal view. And they, the gentle Beasts of Paradise That were Man's once familiar intimates, Far from the menace of his murderous eyes Whither, O whither are they gone? The gates Of Paradise are shut for ever, and there No refuge for Man's victims, nor for him, Remains on earth. But, from the bowers that were With Eden lost, the pitying Seraphim Sow'd in the waste one seed. A forest fair Sprang from it—giant trees of lusty limb, Long vaults of bloom and verdure never bare, Where forms, half-bird half-blossom, flash and swim From bough to bough, and, husht in windless air, Soft shadows flutter from the whisperous wings Of half-awaken'd dreams; while all things there Seem slowly turning into other things, As, down the bowery hollows to the brim Of immemorial seas, melodious springs From undiscoverable sources bear Primeval secrets. Deep into the dim But deathless shelter of that blest repair Those gentle beasts departed, and became Forthwith imperishably fabulous. For History, that doth so loud proclaim And with such curiosity discuss Man's perishable life and course unstable, Of them and theirs knows nothing, and the name Of their unfading Forest Home is Fable. Far off, and ever farther off from us, That Forest and the dwellers in it seem, As far and farther on we travel fast, And more and more like a remember'd dream Becomes the glimmering wonder of the Past. But, o'er a wingèd and four-footed folk Whose unsophisticated nature yields Spontaneous service to her even yoke, There Justice reigns revered; there Pity shields An else defenceless flock; and there do they Their joint tribunal hold, where every cause That in this human world hath gone astray, And honest trial miss'd, by lovelier laws Than ours is welcomed to impartial test, All cases pleaded, be they what they may, All rights establish'd, and all wrongs redress'd. How far away it seems, how far away! Yet one step only from the trodden track That to its daily pilgrims, every one, Appears to be the very zodiac The universe itself is travelling on, Let any man but turn aside, and lo! Around whatever path he chance to pace With steps unconscious of the way they go Far-reaching Fable's million-branch'd embrace Doth its unfathomable influence throw. To him who tells these tales such chance befell Once on a time: and in that Forest old ('Tho' how he enter'd it he cannot tell) With one whose face he may no more behold Or there or here, he was beguiled to dwell Full many a month. But few of his own kind, Among the folk who there safe dwelling have, To greet him or to guide him did he find. Of these, the wisest was a Phrygian slave, The holiest Assisi's tender Saint. Phœdrus upon the borders of the land Sat listening; and to him came echoes faint From voices far within. His careful hand On tablets smooth deliberately wrote In unimpulsive verse, correctly plann'd, All that thus reach'd him from a source remote. But there, without restraint, from place to place And led by none, tho' follow'd by a band Of Loves and Graces whose light steps kept pace With his inimitably varied lay, Free-footed went the witty Fabulist Of social France. And there our English Gay, Methodically playful, neither miss'd Nor much advanced his unadventurous way. Howbeit along that dim and vast domain From the discourse of any one of these Scant guidance did its last explorer gain. There were so many more instructors! Trees, Rocks, rivers, rainbows, clouds, dews, wind, and rain, No less than birds and beasts, that live at ease An unmolested life by hill and plain Throughout its vocal realms (where all that is Is all alive) have tongues, and talk as well As men or books; nor do they take amiss The questions ask'd them, nor refuse to tell Their secrets to the souls that, lingering there, Have learn'd their language. What this listener heard, There lingering long, he may not here declare. But many a tale to him by beast and bird In Fable Land imparted (if time spare The life of any purpose long deferr'd, Or to postponed occasion, when 'tis won, Recall an errant will's disbanded powers) Fain would he tell beneath the lingering sun Of months unborn, that hide midsummer hours Whose golden gossamers have not yet spun Their shining clues to still-unblossom'd bowers. L'ENVOI. AD ÆSOPUM. 1 Say, Æsop, wast thou born a slave, Who dost so freely speak? Thy thoughts so upright and so brave! Thy back so bent and weak? So ugly and so coarse thy face? And, in thy fancies all, such grace! 2 Did thy rude comrades play thee pranks, Thy master beat thee sore, Yet live to own with grateful thanks Thy wit had saved his store? How fail'd such wit thyself to save From an unjust and cruel grave? 3 Hadst thou, indeed, a stammering tongue, Splay foot and limping walk, Whose children are so fair and strong? Didst thou with Solon talk? And didst thou sup with Crœsus too At Sardian feasts? Is all that true? 4 Vain questions! Not to us nor thee, Dear Sage, it matters now If true or false the stories be Of what thou wast: for thou Art what we are: and all thou art We all receive, and all impart. 5 Of thee, who knewst the world so well, Not much the world hath known: Thy voice to us doth only tell Our secrets, not thine own: But thou before us everywhere Hast been, and still we find thee there. 6 Great Sire of Fable! Age to age Extends, from north to south From east to west, thine heritage, That grows from mouth to mouth. And, with its growth still growing thus, Thou art thyself grown fabulous. POEMS. TRANSFORMATIONS. (A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.) 1. “Here at last alone, You and I together! All the night our own, And the warm June weather! Not a soul in sight! What we will, we may. Nothing is by night As it was by day. Look around you! See, All things change themselves. Blossom, bower, and tree Turn to Fays and Elves; Trivial things and common Into rare things rising. Why should man and woman Be less enterprising? Fashion's formal creatures We till now have been, With prim-pattern'd features And a borrow'd mien. Now the mask is broken, Now the fetters fall, Wishes long unspoken Now are all in all! Wondrous transformation Now, for you and me, Waits our invocation. Say, what shall we be?” 2. “What you will,” said She. 3. “Look, then, and listen! For you must be waiting, Behind a high grating, The sound of my signal. Along the wild land I have gallop'd full speed on my coal-black steed To free my love from my foeman's hand, And lo! in the moonlight alert I stand Close under the castle wall. Look out, I am here! Leap down, nor fear! For into my rescuing arms you fall, Safe and free. They are round you, see! One saddle must serve us, so cling to me well, And away, and away, thro' the night we flee! But hark! 'Tis the clang of the 'larum bell. Our pursuers awake. For dear life's sake Cling to me closer, and closer still! And speed, speed, my coal-black steed! They are hurrying after us over the hill. But clear'd is the river, and cross'd is the heath, Deep into the sheltering woods we dart, And O what a ride! for I feel your breath, And how hot it burns! and I hear your heart, And how loud it beats! as I laugh ‘We part No more, come life come death!’” 4. “No, no,” She sigh'd, “not so! Too fiercely fleets your coal-black steed, And pleasure faints in passion's speed, And the bliss that lingers the best must be,” Sigh'd She. 5. “Listen, then, and look, once more! We are sailing round a southern island. Fragrant breathes the dusky shore, Folded under many a moonlit highland. Fragrant breathes the dusky shore, And where dips the languid oar Wavelets dimple flash and darkle, Odours wander, fireflies sparkle: Thro' them all our bark is gliding, Gliding softly, gliding slowly: Not a cloud their sweetness hiding, All the heavens are husht and holy: Midnight's panting pulse uncertain Faintly fans the heaving curtain O'er the silken-pillow'd seat Where you lie with slipper'd feet, Tresses loosed, and zone unbound; While, my ribbon'd lute unslinging, I, your troubadour, beside you, O'er its chords, that trembling sound, Pour the song my soul is singing: List, and let its music guide you, Till the goal of dreams be found!” 6. “Ah, stay so!” She murmur'd low, “Song and stream forever flow! And, if this be dreaming, never Let me wake, but dream for ever, Dreaming thus, if dream it be!” Then He: 7. “As night's magic blends together Moonbeams, starbeams, odours, dews, In a hush of happy weather, Earth and heaven to interfuse; So my song draws softly down All your soul into mine own, Bounteous gift on gift bestowing: First, that heaven, your face; and then Heaven's divinest stars, those eyes Under dewy lashes glowing; Last, those lips, whose smile caresses All their breath beatifies; And the fragrance o'er me flowing From those downward-shaken tresses, Whose delicious wildernesses Hide such haunts of happy sighs!” 8. “Rise, ah rise!” Faint She whisper'd. “Hold me fast! For away the fixt earth flies, And I know not where we are. What is coming? What is past? Bursting, flashing, fleeting, see, Swiftly star succeeds to star Till .... in what new world are we?” “Love's,” said He. 9. “Song and lute the spell obeying, Cease in silence sweeter, stronger, Than song-singing or lute-playing: And, entranced, I know no longer Whither are my senses straying: But I feel my spirit blending With the bliss of thine, and ending Tremulously lost in thee!” 10. “Hush!” sigh'd She, “Lest this dream, if dream alone And no more than dream it be, By a breath should be undone. For ah,” She sigh'd, “I and thou, what are we now?” And He replied, “Thou art I, and I am thou, And we are one!” NORTH AND SOUTH 1 Far in the southern night she sleeps; And there the heavens are husht, and there, Low murmuring from the moonlit deeps, Faint music lulls the dreamful air. No tears on her soft lashes hang, On her calm lips no kisses glow. The throb, the passion, and the pang Are over now. 2 But I? From this full-peopled north, Whose midnight roar around me stirs, How wildly still my heart goes forth To haunt that silent home of hers! There night by night, with no release, These sleepless eyes the vision see, And all its visionary peace But maddens me. ATHENS. (1865.) The burnt-out heart of Hellas here behold! Quench'd fire-pit of the quick explosive Past, Thought's highest crater—all its fervours cold, Ashes and dust at last! And what Hellenic light is living now To gild, not Greece, but other lands, is given: Not where the splendour sank, the after-glow Of sunset stays in heaven. But loud o'er Grecian ruins still the lark Doth, as of old, Hyperion's glory hail, And from Hymettus, in the moonlight, hark The exuberant nightingale! CINTRA. (1868.) 1 In the brake are creaking The tufted canes, And the wind is streaking With fugitive stains A welkin haunted by hovering rains. 2 Low lemon-boughs under My garden wall, In the Quinta yonder, By fits let fall Here an emerald leaf, there a pale gold ball, 3 On the black earth, studded With droplets bright. From the fruit trees, budded, Some pink, some white, And now overflooded with watery light. 4 For the sun, thro' a chasm Of the colourless air, With a jubilant spasm From his broken lair Upleaps and stands, for a moment, bare! 5 But a breath bewilders The wavering weather; And those sky-builders That put together The vaporous walls of the cloud-bound ether 6 From the mountains hasten In pale displeasure To mortice and fasten The bright embrasure, Shutting behind it day's innermost azure. 7 On the bleak blue rim Of the lonesome lea, Shapeless and dim As far things at sea, Mafra yon nebulous clump must be! 8 Across the red furrows To where in the sides Of the hills he burrows (As a reptile hides) The many-legg'd, long-back'd, aqueduct strides. 9 Just over the pines, As from tapers snuff'd, A thin smoke twines Till its course is luff'd At the edge of the cliff, by the breeze rebuff'd; 10 Whence, downward turning A dubious haze, (From the charcoal-burning) It strays, delays, And departs by a dozen different ways. 11 The chestnuts shiver, The olive trees Recoil and quiver, Stung by the breeze, Like sleepers awaked by a swarm of bees. 12 Down glimmering lanes The grey oxen go; And the grumbling wains They drag onward slow Wail, as they wind in a woeful row, 13 With fruits and casks To the seaside land, Where Colares basks In a glory bland, And from gardens o'erhanging the scented sand 14 Great aloes glisten And roses dangle. But listen! listen! The mule-bells jangle, Rounding the rock-hewn path's sharp angle. 15 As their chime dies out The dim woods among, With the ghostly shout And the distant song Of the muleteers that have pass'd along, 16 From behind the hill Whence comes that roar, Up the road so still But a minute before? 'Tis a message arrived from the grieved sea shore. 17 And, tho' close it seems, Yet from far away It is come, as in dreams The announcements they To the souls that can understand convey. 18 For whenever you hear, As you hear it now, That sound so clear, You may surely know Foul weather's at hand, tho' no wind should blow. 19 But the cork wood is sighing, It cannot find rest; And the raven, flying Around his black nest, Hath signall'd the storm to the Sierra's crest. 20 Plaintive and sullen, Penalva moans; The torrents are swollen; The granite bones Of Cruzalta crackle with split pine cones; 21 Roused and uproarious The huge oaks yell Till the ghost of Honorius Is scared from his cell, Where not even a ghost could in quietude dwell; 22 For the woods all round Its cork-clad walls Are storm'd by the sound Of the waterfalls That have shatter'd their mountain pedestals. 23 On the topmost shelf Of the Pena, fast As the rock itself, In a cluster vast Stood castle and keep but a moment past; 24 Now, in what to the sight Is but empty air, They are vanisht quite, And the sharp peak, bare As a shaven chin, is upslanted there. 25 Can a film of cloud, Like the fiat of Fate, In its sightless shroud Thus obliterate The ponderous mass of a pile so great? 26 'Twas a fact, yet a breath Has that fact dispell'd. So truth, underneath A cloud compell'd To hide her head, is no more beheld. 27 The achievement of years, By a minute effaced, Departs, disappears, And is all replaced By a cold blank colourless empty waste. 28 All forms, alas, That remain or flee As the winds that pass May their choice decree, Stand faster far than have stood by me 29 The man I served, And the woman I loved. But what if they swerved As their faith was proved, When a mountain can be by a mist removed? SORRENTO REVISITED. (1885.) On the lizarded wall and the gold-orb'd tree Spring's splendour again is shining; But the glow of its gladness awakes in me Only a vast repining. To Sorrento, asleep on the soft blue breast Of the sea that she loves, and dreaming, Lone Capri uplifts an ethereal crest In the luminous azure gleaming. And the Sirens are singing again from the shore. 'Tis the song that they sang to Ulysses; But the sound of a song that is sung no more My soul in their music misses. FRAGRANCE. (A SPRING BALLAD.) DEDICATION TO ? Here Spring with her gifts is come. She hath given white buds to the hedge, To the wandering swallow a home, And a rose to your window ledge. In return for the gifts she gave A gift for herself she sought, And I, of the best I have, Gave to her a single thought. That thought was a thought of you, Spring laid it the leaves among, There fed it on light and dew, And return'd it to me in a song. So the twice-given gift, as to me Spring brought it, to you I bring: For this song is the child of three, Us two, and our playmate, Spring. BALLAD. 1. The soul of all the souls that have become Sweet odours, I am Fragrance from afar. Deep hid in Beauty's bosom was my home, And known to me her inmost mysteries are. 2. I know the secret of the Rose. She blushes, I know the reason why. A hopeless passion in her heart she hushes For the bright Beetle-Fly. He was a bold and brilliant cavalier: He woo'd her in the love-time of the year A livelong summer day: He woo'd her, and he won her: then betray'd her, And, breaking all the vows that he had made her, Upon a sky-built sunbeam sail'd away. 3. Then the Rose wisht for wings to follow him, But all her wishings were of no avail. What she could do, she did. In pilgrim trim From bower to bower she wander'd down the dale, And climb'd and climb'd, and peep'd into the dim Nest of the Nightingale. 4. The Nightingale beheld her, and averr'd That she was fairest of the fair. He said, “Fair crimson-wingèd creature, be a bird! And I with thee, and none but thee, will wed.” His amorous song the Rose resentful heard, And shook her head. 5. Into that amorous song there slid a tear. The Rose was weeping, sad at heart was she. But still the Nightingale with song sincere Sang to her in the twilight from the tree. “O wert thou but a bird! thou art so dear, Thee would I mate with, and wed none but thee!” “Nay,” sigh'd the Rose, “I seek mine absent fere, A lover bold and born of high degree, My heart is sad because he is not here, Sir Scarabæus he!” 6. The Evening Wind pass'd by, and heard her boast, And to the Rose he whisper'd, laughing low, “Poor Rose, thine absent lover thou hast lost, For he is faithless, and forsaken thou! I met him on my travels at the Court Of Queen Spiræa of Ulmaria. The Meadow Queen is she, and all amort Sir Scarabæus, for her sake, that day Had sworn to break a lance. The tilt was short, I left him lying wounded in the dust, And only know that, by the last report, Thy gallant had received a mortal thrust. Now all the common flowers that far and wide Have envied thee because thou art so fair Are laughing at thee. But whate'er betide, Come thou with me, and I will bring thee where Thou yet mayst find him in his fallen pride.” The poor Rose hung her head, and, in despair, “Had I but wings!” she sigh'd, “Had I but wings!” 7. With laughter light again, “Thou hast them,” that perfidious Wind replied, “And I will show thee how to use them.” Then He breathed upon the Rose, and, undenied, Pluckt from her one by one her petals fair; But, soon dissatisfied With his sweet theft, along the thankless air He tost the stolen petals here and there, And off he hied. 8. Me for himself he would have kept. But I Beheld thee, as the Evening Wind went by Bearing me with him. To the Wind I said “Wait for me!” and I slid into thy soul. When the Wind miss'd me he believed me dead, And so went on without me to his goal, Which he shall never reach, for every hour It changes. From that moment I became The inmate of thy thoughts. I have the power To perfume all the paths they haunt. My name Another's lips must teach thine own to spell. Untold I leave it, lest the Evening Star Should guess it in thine eyes. With thee to dwell, And thine to be for ever, from afar I come with secrets laden, I can tell To none but thee. So sweet my whispers are, That with their fragrance fill'd is every thought That I have breathed on. Maiden pure and fair, A paradise of perfumes I have brought That thy sweet soul may breathe in sweetest air. Ah, keep it! The Soul's Fragrance lost, can aught That loss repair? LINES These lines are the result of a slumber, not induced by any narcotic, from which the writer awoke under an extraordinarily vivid impression that he had composed in his sleep a poem of considerable length. Of the purport of the poem he retained only a vague and shadowy notion; but more than a hundred lines of it were lingering (as it seemed to him) so distinctly in his recollection that he hastened to write them down. His memory however (or the illusion which had usurped the function of memory) suddenly and completely failed him at the point where this fragment breaks off. He has never been able to complete it; and it is printed here, without alteration, as a psychological curiosity. COMPOSED IN SLEEP. This is the place. Here flourish'd Wicked Deeds And wither'd, in a world without a name, Buried ere ours was born. Fierce troops of Crimes Weapon'd and crown'd, athwart a desert land Of wasted loveliness, to reach this place Travell'd in pomp: here settled, and here died, Grown old and weak: and, dying left behind No chronicle upon the bare rock graven Of what they were or what they did. The lives They cramm'd with evil, all their wicked loves, Their wicked hates, Death and slow Time have turn'd Into a sly grey silent ghostliness, A stealth-footed Fear, that prowls for prey, Creeps on the wretch who wanders here unwarn'd, Catches him, with long fingers, by the head, Nor lets him go till all his mind is gone. This was their city's tower'd acropolis, This sprawling hoop of roofless ruin huge Whose heart is hollowness. These broken ribs Of crumbled stone and mounds of rippling grass Were walls whose builders, when those walls were built, Kings put to death, that none the plan might tell Of secret chambers cruelly contrived For lust and murder: and therein were born Abominable pleasures. Round them now Rank ivy rustles with the revelry Of spangled reptiles. Down in a dry well There hath been dwelling for three thousand years An old white newt, whiter than leprosy. He only knows the long-forgotten names Of those strong scarlet blossoms on the brink That once were Sins. PROMETHEIA. (FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS, ET CÆTERA.) Mephistopheles (ad spectatores) “Am Ende hängen wir doch ab Von Creaturen die wir machten.”— Faust.—Second Part. (Birth of the Homunculus.) PART THE FIRST. “God of the Gods, and Lord of Heaven! Since now Repentant Power rejects not Reason's use, Here on the Path of Progress stay not thou Thy steps by me well-counsell'd!” (Thus to Zeus Prometheus spake.) “From Earth's primordial womb Mute to the birth her progeny are brought. To death they go, as into life they come, Condemn'd to suffer all and utter nought. Read in the language of their longing eyes The passionate petition of the dumb, And grant the long'd-for gift, mere life denies, A voice to Will, to Feeling, and to Thought!” But Zeus, mistrustful, murmur'd “To what end?” “No end of ends,” he answer'd, “and in each A fresh beginning! for with better fraught Is every best, as world on world ascend, In ceaseless self-upliftings, life's immense Capacities of growth. Voice leads to speech, Speech to intelligence, intelligence To liberty, and liberty” .... “To what?” Zeus interrupted. “Ever out of reach Thy thoughts run on, and all thy language still Sounds revolutionary.” “Still! why not?” Prometheus laugh'd. “We share the imputed crime. From revolutionary fountains flow Fresh streams of force; and, tho' enthroned sublime On spoil'd Olympus, what thyself wert thou Without the Revolution, Son of Time?” “Titan,” the God, with darkening aspect, sigh'd, “It was to ravish, not retain, a throne That on the Revolution we relied; Wherein thy services have every one Been well requited.” “Ay,” Prometheus cried, “Witness Mount Caucasus!” “What's done is done,” Zeus answer'd. “Not till thou hadst turn'd our foe And filch'd our fire, did we retaliate thus. But witness also thou, that (long ago Recall'd with recompense from Caucasus) Thee hath our later friendship favour'd so, That thine is now copartnership with us In all our own Olympian empery, By thy weird wisdom guided. Why discuss The unalterable past? Nor thou nor I Fresh conflict crave. This much concede.” “I do,” Prometheus mutter'd, “and the reason why Full well, Fate-driven Thunderer, I know! For thy reluctant power perforce obeys The strict compulsions of Necessity.” “Her iron yoke,” replied the God, “she lays On Gods and Titans both, and none can close, None ope, her hidden hand. Forget the days That disunited us, nor indispose A confidence that fain would rest assured Rather in him sage Themis loves to praise, Than in the perjured Titan who abjured The cause of his own kindred.” “And for whose, Ungrateful God?” “Nay, my Prometheus, mine The cause, I know, for which thou didst change sides.” “Not thine,” the indignant Titan cried, “not thine! Nor thine nor thee, Monarch of Parricides From Sire to Son, I sought! In god or worm I care not where the sign of it I see, But let me find, beneath the poorest germ, Some promise of improvement, that to free A hinder'd progress to a higher term Needs all the aid a Titan can afford, And mine shall not be wanting to confirm The effort that aspires to overcome!” Zeus, shaking his sheaved thunders at the word, Exclaim'd, “Inveterately venturesome! Whom should the upstart overcome? Not me?” “And why not thee,” Prometheus cried, “new lord Of a usurpt dominion? Why not thee, Thee and thy kindred all, whose starry home To Kronos once belong'd, if its endeavour Of higher worth than thine and theirs should be? Kronides, never have I flatter'd, never Deceived thee, or betray'd! Forget not thou That in the Race of Uranus for ever Power hath been lost and won by overthrow. Unoverthrown, wouldst thou preserve it, dare To rule without oppression! Fearless now, Fling the lone scepter of a world-wide care Into the lap of Freedom! Safest thus Shall its supremacy remain, for there Rebellion breathes not. Had not Kronos pent Our Giant Brotherhood in Tartarus, His might have been (thy treason to prevent) The hundred-handed help he lack'd of us. Confide in Liberty, the friend of all, And live by all befriended! With her, grow From growth to growth, in a perpetual Increase of growing greatness! So shalt thou, Still onward borne with all that's onward going, Be never by-gone, never out of date! 'Tis at the price of ever greater growing Eternity is granted to the great.” Zeus answer'd with an indecisive sigh. “Prophet,” he said, “who, in the hoary Past Where the old Gods and the old Ages lie, Sole of thy kindred didst the hour forecast Which thou alone survivest, prophecy (If still the gift of prophecy thou hast) What destiny for me, should I deny The gift thou cravest, is reserved by Fate?” “The sadness of immense satiety,” Prometheus murmur'd. “Pause and meditate!” He added. “I, the Spokesman of the Dumb, Am also Seer of the Unseen.” “But what,” Zeus sigh'd again, “will they next crave, to whom The voice to crave it hath been granted?” “That Shall they themselves inform thee by and by,” Exclaim'd the surly Giant, and thereat His shoulders huge he shrugg'd. Without reply Zeus mused awhile; but, spying Eros pass Full-quiver'd for a chase of sweeter cry Than Cynthia leads along the moonlit grass, When, thro' the rustling grove and glimpsing sky, Thin shadows, fast pursued by shadows, flee, The God, impatient, glanced at Earth's mute mass; Then waved an acquiescent hand, as he Turn'd from the Titan with a faint “Alas, Prometheus, thou art compromising me!” PART II. Leaving in haste the Olympian Council Hall, The apostate Titan down to Earth convey'd The grudged concession wrung from Zeus. There, all In conclave multitudinous array'd, His clients he together call'd (from man In fair Apollo's faultless image made, To man's close copy, made on the same plan, The flat-faced ape) and all the bars undid Which had till then lock'd mercifully fast The innumerable voices that, unchid, Now into riotous utterance rush'd at last. This done, preferring to appreciate The concert from a distance, he return'd To the Olympians—in whose looks irate A relisht indignation he discern'd. The Gods and Goddesses, the Demigods And Demigoddesses, all demi-nude, (As Classic Art's correctest periods Prescribed to each the appropriate attitude) Were listening, with more wonder than delight, To the new noisiness of earthly things. For quick and thick each animal appetite Throbb'd into sudden sound from the loud strings Of throats in thousands loosed; and left and right Chirrupings, crowings, howlings, bellowings, And barkings—bass and treble of mingled mirth And pain—were now profusely vomited In vehement hubbub from the vocal Earth. Meanwhile, as with sloped shoulder, shuffling tread Evasive, mien morose, and furtive eye, Thro' Heaven's bright groups the burly Titan sped, Their comments were not complimentary. “Please to explain,” resentful Herè said, “This new caprice, or stop that peacock's cry! My bird will be a byword and a scoff If this continues!” “Ah, Fair Majesty, This new caprice is an old debt paid off,” Prometheus answer'd. “Fops in pomp array'd Must now reveal what's in them, to the ear, Who, to the eye, have heretofore display'd Only what's on them. But have thou no fear, Thy favourite makes an admirable show— From one so beautiful exact no more!” Eos complain'd of the cock's clamorous crow, Superfluously sounded o'er and o'er. “Prometheus might at least,” she said, “for me Have managed to contrive a less absurd And indiscreetly strepitant minstrelsy Than the loud shriek of that ridiculous bird!” “Sweet Cousin, thine indulgence,” he replied, “For the cicala's strains (I grant that these Have not as yet been duly deified) Leaves to less plaintive notes small chance to please An ear compassionately prejudiced. Sleep sounder, and wake later! What hath drawn Thy blushing charms, untimely thus enticed, O rosy-finger'd Daughter of the Dawn, From that soft couch Love's self were fain to lie on? Is it the memory of Cephalus, Or else the expectation of Orion?” With jests sarcastic curtly answering thus The just reproaches of the Gods, that great Ungainly Titan strode from spot to spot, Superbly heedless of the scorn and hate His course provoked. Olympus loved him not, Despite his ancient birth and lineage high; And even the new-made Deities, whose past Was but of yesterday, with sidelong eye Look'd on him as a god of lower caste. The restless spirit that from his peers in Heaven Ever aloof the unquiet Giant held Had to his strenuous Titanism given A tone incongruously coarse. Impell'd By unintelligible vehemence, His uncouth grandeur grieved the fluent grace Of the Olympian Quiet with intense Abrupt explosive ardours; as apace On its swift course, all rough with rocks and roots, And fiercely fluttering with volcanic fire, Some ravaged morsel of a mountain shoots Across the cloven crystal of a lake In whose clear depths stars and still clouds admire The lucid forms their own reflections take. Sole, Aphroditè (she, that Fairest Fair, Whose sacred sweetness from its rancorous tooth The Titan's biting wit was pleased to spare, —She for whose solitary sake, in truth, The sullen menace of his face at whiles A fond mysterious fervour unavow'd Made soft and luminous with hovering smiles, Like summer lightnings thro' a sleeping cloud) Sole, Aphroditè found a curious charm In this grim God-born Mocker of the Gods; And, waving to Prometheus her white arm, She beckon'd him with amicable nods. Submissive to her signal he drew near, And with a questioning gaze the Goddess eyed. “Titan, well done!” she whisper'd in his ear; “What long on Earth I miss'd thou hast supplied. I love the lion's roar, the ring-dove's coo: By both alike love's needs are well express'd: The amorous bull's deep bellowing charms me too. But why hast thou withheld the last and best Of all thy gifts from those who, tho' but few, Most claim on thy solicitude possess'd?” Prometheus, by astonishment tongue-tied, An interrogatory eyebrow raised. “Those larks and nightingales that yonder hide,” The Goddess answer'd as on Earth she gazed, “Inaudible and invisible to all! Darkling they haunt the shadows round them furl'd, Silent amidst the universal brawl And babble of the emancipated world. Yet heaven is husht to hear their minstrelsy: For these the moon and stars are not too sweet, For those the sun himself is not too high: And shall they have no listeners? Hearts that beat With base emotions find ignoble voice, Wrath, and Unreason, and Vulgarity Speak loud. Stupidity and Spite rejoice In utterance unrestricted. Say, then, why (Where Folly's fife with Envy's clarion vies) Must these alone, the darlings of the Spring, Whose souls are fill'd with lyric ecstacies, Unheard, or even if heard unheeded, sing?” The Titan's eye, with a soul-searching glare, Sounded the secret dwelling undescried In those small bosoms. “And what seest thou there?” The Goddess ask'd him. Sighing he replied “What I should have foreseen!” “But what is that?” Full on the glorious beauty of her face Prometheus gazed. “O Goddess, ask not what! Thou who, supreme in beauty and in grace, Art by adoring worlds proclaim'd divine, What kindred could thy confident godhood trace In a shy loveliness so unlike thine? A loveliness of its own self afraid, A Bastard Beauty, fearing to be seen, Yet fainting to be loved, that seeks the shade!” The Goddess laugh'd “What doth my Titan mean? What bastard is he speaking of?” And he, “Ay, 'tis a Beauty bastard-born, and not Authentically certified to be, A Beauty surreptitiously begot From Heaven's embrace of Earth, and breathing, see, Between them both in secrecy and shame An unacknowledged life!” “But what,” said she, Is this poor Heaven-born Earth-child's luckless name?” “Its name,” Prometheus sigh'd, “is Poesy.” “A woman?” “No.” “A man, then?” “Ah, still less!” The glorious sexual Goddess blush'd outright, “Is Hermes, then, a father?” “Nay, my guess “Divines not Hermes.” “Zeus, then? am I right?” “I doubt...” “If there's a doubt, 'tis Zeus! Suppress The father's name, however. Well we know The mother is the love tale's text, of course, The father but the pretext. Name the mother!” “But thou wouldst not believe me...” “Worse and worse! 'Tis Herè, then?” “Not Herè.” “There's no other Of whom the thing's incredible—unless Perchance 'tis Pallas?” “No alas, not she!” “And why alas?” With keen suggestiveness, For sole reply the Titan glowingly Gazed on the Goddess, till she blush'd again, “Matchless impertinent!” But he, unmoved, “Goddess, I warn'd thee that thou wouldst not deign To give me credit...” “For such pert unproved Assertion? Fie, to say it to my face!” “But I said nothing.” “And yet all implied. What next, I wonder!” “Queen of every grace And all that's beautiful,” Prometheus cried, “Tell me thy parents!” “Known to all are they, Zeus and Dione, both of them divine.” “They!” cried the Titan, “they thy parents? Nay, Great and dear Goddess, beauty such as thine Had nobler birth! Those stupid Gods are not The true begetters of a deity Above their own. 'Twas otherwise begot. Slid from the starry bosom of the sky, A single drop of sacred ichor pure, The mystic blood of Uranus, contain'd In one bright bead thy whole progeniture: Hid in the heart of Ocean it remain'd Till there it brought thy wondrous self to birth: And, even so, one glimpse of Heaven unstain'd, That fell reflected in a glance from Earth To Heaven uplifted, this new Beauty bore— Which hath no sex, no mother, and no sire, No kin on Earth, no home in Heaven—nay more, 'Tis neither man nor woman, but the soul, Of the wide world's unsatisfied desire. And thro' the universe, without a goal, Its hungering heart must wander high and higher, Till from the Gods it gain (as I, for those Poor mortals yonder, snatch'd from Zeus his fire) The immortality they dread to lose.” “But this new Beauty, do those bosoms small Enshrine it?” ask'd the Goddess. “Ah, subdued,” Prometheus murmur'd bitterly, “by all The vulgar voices of the multitude That loves its own monopoly of noise, No homage hath the homeless one on Earth! And vainly its unanswer'd song employs The gift I gave. In darkness and in dearth, By noise and glare engirt, unheard it sings, Unseen it stirs. For this, from Zeus I craved, What he denies me still, the gift of wings— For birds—birds only—that in some sweet bird Life's sweetest voice, from Earth's loud hubbub saved, Might soar in song to Heaven, and there be heard. Never while man breathes mortal breath shall he, The Earthborn, hand or foot from Earth withdraw: For there uplifted must his kingdom be By agelong labour. Language, there, and Law Hath he to found; create, for social power And spacious trade, the Senate and the Mart; Establish Science in her starry tower, And mint the glowing miracles of Art. Such is the task by me for man design'd! But ever, as on Earth his task he plies, Higher than foot and hand must heart and mind, Uplifted o'er the earthly labour, rise. Let mind and heart, then, heavenward pathways find Upon the wings of every bird that flies, While hand and foot stay fast to Earth confined; Lest Earth should haply lose her fairest prize, The hand of man: whose fingers five shall bind Together all that his five wits' rejoice To wrench from Time's tenacious treasuries, As, guided onward by a wingèd voice, Earth's wingless lord to his high future hies!” PART III. The Titan quiver'd. Strenuous tremours ran Thro' his huge limbs, rocking their heaviness Like wind-rack'd oaks; and his deep eyes began To glow with a prophetic passion. “Yes! And then,” he murmur'd, “then the Race of Man (Taught by that wingèd voice) perchance may guess The giant purpose, the stupendous plan That, brooding o'er its cloudy cradle, I Have for the infant fashion'd. Changeless Gods, What profits you your immortality? Thro' endless self-repeating periods To be the same for ever, is to be For ever lacking life's divinest gift, The faculty of growth. No inch can ye Your future o'er your present selves uplift. What good in such prolong'd ineptitude? But to be ever growing young again, From age to age eternally renew'd With breath new-born, and ardour to attain Goals ever new, by courses never done, —This gift, to gods ungiven, or given in vain, My forethought hath reserved for man alone! Death was the blind condition jealous Zeus, To balk my purpose, on mankind imposed, But Death my purpose serves: for Death renews Man's youth, whose course old age might else have closed. Unprescient God, 'tis well thou couldst not guess That to these hands the fetter forged by thee Gave all required by their inventiveness To shape the sword that cuts each fetter free! Mankind must die! The fiat forth is gone. Die? When I heard that word of doom proclaim'd, More self-restraint I needed to suppress A shout of joy, than when my strangled groan Burst not the bitten lips its anguish shamed, And not a cry revealed the dumb distress Of my Caucasian martyrdom. By Death The Race of Man shall be from age to age Replenisht with the perdurable breath Of endless birth, and vigour to engage In ventures new. Death's sickle, as it reaps The old grain, to the young the soil restores, And still the harvest springs, and the soil keeps Still fresh for growth its disencumber'd pores. A man is dead, long live Mankind! From soul To soul each life's acquest triumphantly Passes in sure succession. Ages roll, And in a hundred ages (what care I How many births as many deaths succeed?) Man's Race, enrich'd a hundredfold thereby, Remains as young as ever. Oft with heed Have I the Ocean watch'd, and watch'd the shore. The sand, rejected by the wave's wild shock, Gathers in heaps and, growing more and more, And high and higher, hardens till at last The wave returning breaks upon a rock, And is itself rejected. Tost and cast By Time's recurrent waves, son after sire, From death to death, like that sea-driven sand, Grains of Humanity, with past on past Your greatening future pile, and high and higher, Based on each others' buried shoulders, stand!” “What art thou muttering?” Aphroditè said. “Mysterious dreamer, dost thou meditate The Gods' destruction?” High his shaggy head The Titan lifted, and replied elate, “Not thine, Anadyomenè, not thine! Passion's imperishable autocrat, Thee only of the Gods I deem divine, And permanent is thy sweet power as Fate. Receive mine oath, and aid me!” “How? In what?” “Inspire in Zeus the wish to be a bird That he may woo a mortal.” Letting fall Sweet lids o'er sunny eyes as this she heard, The Goddess smiled, and answer'd “Is that all?” PART IV. Pretentious patrons of mankind, what pranks However monstrous has your pride disdain'd For pushing forward its own purpose? Thanks To your activity, what tears have stain'd The trophies of man's progress! What a sea Of blood, to float your cockle-boats, been shed! Your fellow man from prejudice to free, Your fellow man's incorrigible head Have you chopp'd off with philanthropic glee, By basketfuls, benign Philanthropists! And, promising a better life instead, This life have you, evangelising Priests, With penance fill'd! Your famed philosophies, By way of throwing light on what men find Compassionately dark, burn out their eyes, Vaunting Philosophers! In vain mankind For refuge from its benefactors sighs. His purposes humane the Titan's mind Found less inhuman means to realise. He merely made a god ridiculous. When Zeus had, for the sake of Ganymede, Assumed an eagle's form, succumbing thus To Aphroditè's influence, thro' that deed The Son of Asia and Iäpetus His end attain'd. For how thenceforth could Zeus (Plagued by the importunate solicitings Of such a crafty counsellor) refuse Even to the meanest bird a pair of wings? Promiscuous benefits can rarely claim A better origin. To elevate One favourite, lest it should incur the blame Of personal preference in affairs of State, Some dozen mediocrities as high The Crown must needs advance. If, still irate, The Public Voice protests, to brave its cry There are at least thirteen instead of one: The wrong, moreover, that is done thereby To no one in particular is done: 'Tis but a general calamity, And that is an indignity to none. Yet vast and irremediable was The failure of Prometheus. From the day He universalised the voice, alas, Whilst every vulgar brute could say his say, To souls refined and delicate remain'd No refuge from the hubbub all around But their own silence: and such souls refrain'd (Dumfounded quite by a disgust profound) From audible utterance. The loquacious zest Of Earth's coarse crowd had in the finer few Life's highest note unknowingly suppress'd. That was the Titan's first mistake. A new And worse one he fell into, in his quest Of means to mend it: for he did but brew A base resentment in the human breast By giving wings to birds. Man's envy drew Between the smallest sparrow and himself Comparisons, from one grudged point of view, Displeasing to the self-conceited elf. A third mistake Prometheus might have then Committed, and from Zeus in some weak mood The envied gift of wings for envious men Perchance obtain'd, had Man's Ingratitude Not prematurely ended his career. Mortals, and mortals to a man agreed In censuring all attempts to interfere With their mortality, men first decreed The Abolition of the Gods: and here, Prometheus held their sacrilegious deed Was justifiable, altho' severe: But men no sooner from the Gods were freed, Than of a Titan's aid so sure they were Their godless freedom had no further need, That they forthwith proclaim'd it everywhere Mankind's Titanic Patron had become To man no more than an enormous myth; The monstrous trance of dreaming Heathendom, Not to be any longer trusted with Traditional influence on the human mind. Thus, having fail'd to benefit the few, And by the ungrateful multitude malign'd, A sad self-exile, seeking to eschew The sight of his own failure in mankind, Prometheus from man's fatuous world withdrew. But first to his lame brother he resign'd His slighted scepter. Epimetheus sought To avenge Prometheus, and rebuke men's blind Ingratitude for gifts that cost them nought. Strict penalties to granted prayers he join'd, And punish'd with a knowledge dearly bought The pride that had disdainfully declined Gratuitous instruction. Afterthought Succeeded Forethought as the Ruling Power Of Progress, and the Race of Man was taught A painful prudence by Pandora's dower Of ever unanticipated woes From wishes born. The formidable place Of his first martyrdom Prometheus chose For his last refuge from a thankless race. There, wandering far and farther out of sight, Along waste ways indefinite as those Traced by the shadows travelling in the flight Of silent clouds o'er solitary snows, “Rash Race of Suicides!” he mused in scorn, “You to your own precocious appetite Have fall'n a prey: your future yet unborn You have devour'd: and, fumbled ere unfurl'd, Broken is all its promise in the bud! No more can I redeem you from a world Where Genius, bringing fire, found only mud Wherefrom to make an image of itself. Ah, what to you is left for which to live, To toil, to suffer? Perishable pelf, Lust without love, coarse pleasures that contrive Their own defeat, and joy that never stays! What with those aspirations will you do, Which should have been as pinions to upraise Humanity above the Gods? Pursue The trivial tenour of your thankless days From things desired to things possest in vain, But there my gifts can aid you not, I know! Alas, and what will now be their worse pain, In whom those gifts their glowing poësies With aching pangs commingle? Woe to you, Poor children of my frustrate enterprise! Poets, can you be silent?” That austere And somber martyr's reminiscent eye Survey'd the snow-ribb'd crags around him there, And the lost Titan murmur'd, with a sigh Soon frozen in their freezing atmosphere, “If not .... well, learn to suffer, even as I!” A SIGH. The Passion and the pain of yore Slow time hath still'd in vain, Since all that I can feel no more I yearn to feel again. NECROMANCY. Why didst thou let me deem thee lost for years, Youth of my heart? And, now that I have shed O'er thy false grave long-since-forgotten tears, And put away my mourning for the dead, And learn'd to live without thee half content, What brings thee back alive, tho' in disguise? For thou, with this fair stranger's beauty blent, Art smiling on me thro' another's eyes. URIEL. (A MYSTERY.) DEDICATION. To you, the dead and gone, bright-eyed Desires Whose beauty lights no more my dwindled day, Here, sitting lone beside forsaken fires, I dedicate this lay. 1. I heard a Voice by night, that call'd to me “Uriel! Uriel!” The night was dark, and nothing could I see, Yet knew I by the Voice that it was She Whom my soul loves so well That when She calls Her follower I must be, Whether She call from Heaven or from Hell. 2. Then to the Voice “What is thy will?” said I. But for sole response thro' the darkness fell, Repeated with the same importunate cry, Mine own name only, “Uriel! Uriel!” I could not sleep nor rest upon my bed, So I rose up, and thro' the husht house pass'd With steps unlighted (for my lamp was dead) Out on the heath. 3. That Voice flew onward fast, Still calling, and still onward after it I follow'd, far outsped: for there, beneath The moonless heaven, not even a marsh-fire lit Night's fearful sameness; and athwart the heath, Not fast and free as flew the Voice that led, But halting oft, my steps went stumblingly. Each footstep, as it fell, recoil'd with dread From what it toucht; and, tho' I could not see, I felt that, where I trod, the plain was spread With corpses. Heap'd so thick they seem'd to be, That I, at every moment, fear'd to tread Upon a dead man's face. Yet, undeterr'd, My feet obey'd a will not mine, whose spell Their course constrain'd. For still that Voice I heard, And still the Voice call'd “Uriel! Uriel!” 4. At last a livid light began to grow Low down in heaven. It was the moon that, pent Behind a slowly crumbling cloud till now, Athwart thin flakes of worn-out vapour sent A filmy gleam. And I could see thereby The corpses that lay litter'd on the heath. Each white up-slanted face and unshut eye Was staring at me with the stare of death: Harness'd in rusty mail from head to heel Was each dead body: and each dead right hand Grasp'd by the hilt a blade of bloodstain'd steel, But broken was each blade. And, while I scann'd Those dead men's faces, I began to feel A sadness which I could not understand: But unto me it seem'd that I had seen, And known, and loved them, somewhere, long ago: Tho' when, or where, and all that was between That time and this (if what perplex'd me so With mimic memories had indeed once been) I knew no longer. On this fatal plain Vast battle must have once been waged, so keen That none was spared by the relentless foe For unmolested burial of the slain. 5. And, as I gazed upon them, wondering why These unrememberable faces seem'd Mysteriously familiar to mine eye, The cloudy light that on their corselets gleam'd Grew clearer, and a sound began to swell Moaning along the heath: the swarthy sky Was scourged by a strong wind: the moonlight stream'd, Flooding the land: and on the dead men fell Its frigid splendour. Then stark upright rose Each dead man, shouting “Uriel! Uriel!” And in the windy air aloft all those Arm'd corpses waved their shatter'd swords. 6. I cried, “What are ye? and what name is it you bear? Corpses or ghosts? Is Life with Death allied, To breed new horrors in this hideous lair Of Desolation?” And they all replied “Thine is our name, for thine our Legions were, And thine would still be, if thou hadst not died. But corpse or ghost thou art thyself, and how Should we thy death survive? It is not well When the dead do not know the dead, nor know The date of their own death-day, Uriel! Our leader bold in many a fight wast thou, And we fought bravely. But thy foes and ours Were strongest. And the strife is over now, And we be all dead men. And those tall towers We built are fallen, all our banners torn, All our swords broken, all our strong watch fires Quencht, and in death have we been left forlorn Of sepulture, tho' sons of princely sires, Born to find burial fair with saints and kings, Where, over trophied tombs, the taper shines On tablets rich with votive offerings, And priestly perfumes soothe memorial shrines. And that is why we cannot find repose In the bare quiet of unburied death; But ever, when at night the wild wind blows Upon the barren bosom of this heath, Our dead flesh tingles, and revives, and glows With the brief passion of a borrow'd breath, Breathed by the wind: and on as the wind goes Go with the wind we must, where'er that be, A lonesome pilgrimage along the night, Till the wind falls again, and with it we. Farewell!” 7. The wild wind swept them from my sight Even as they spake, and all the heath was bare. Sighingly the wind ceased. The night was still. The dead were gone. Only the moonlight there Upon the empty heath lay clear and chill. Then I remember'd long-forgotten things, And all my loss. I could no farther fare Along that haunted heath; for my heart's strings Were aching, gnaw'd by an immense despair. Flat on the spot where last they stood I fell, And clutch'd the wither'd fern, as one that clings Fast to a grave where all he loved lies dead, And wept, and wept, and wept. “Rise Uriel,” The Voice I knew still call'd, “and follow me!” But I could only weep, so vast a well Of tears within me flow'd. At last I said “What heart or hope have I to follow thee? Are not the Legions lost, that at thy call To mine own overthrow and theirs I led? For I have seen again their faces all, And death was all I saw there.” “Let them be!” The Voice replied. “The dead shall live again When we have reach'd the goal whereto I go, And there shalt thou rejoin them. Nor till then Canst thou thyself return to life, for thou Thyself art also fall'n among the slain. But look upon me, faithless one, and know That I am life in death, and joy in pain, And light in darkness.” 8 I look'd up, and saw, In glory that was not of mere moon light, (Glory that fill'd me with a great glad awe) Shining above me, Her my soul loves well, Like a white Angel, And along the night Her voice still call'd me “Uriel! Uriel!” Again I follow'd. And it seem'd that days And nights, and weeks, and months, and years went by, As on we went by never-ending ways Thro' worlds and worlds. And ever was mine eye Fixt on that beckoning Form with faithful gaze. And seasons little cared for—shine or shade, Or heat or cold—pursued us. Many a Spring, And many a Summer, many an Autumn, stay'd My panting path, and round me strove to fling Their fervid arms, and many a Winter made His frozen fingers meet and fiercely cling In lean embrace that long my course delay'd, And Pain and Pleasure both essay'd to wring My purpose from me. But still, sore afraid Lest I should lose my Guide by tarrying, Forward I press'd whenever the Voice said “Uriel! Uriel! linger not!” 9. At last We reach'd what seem'd the end of a dead world. Wall'd round it was by mountains bare and vast, And thro' them one thin perilous pathway curl'd Into an unknown land of ice and snow, Where nothing lived, nor aught was left to freeze But frost. There was a heap of bones below; Above, a flock of vultures. Under these, Hard by a stream that long had ceased to flow, A miserable, squalid, lean old man, Nursing a broken harp upon his knees, Sat in the frozen pass. His eyes were wan, But full of spiteful looks. She my soul loved, Fair as a skyward Seraph on the wing, Before me up that perilous pathway moved, Calling me from above, and beckoning. But he that sat before the pass began To twang his harp, which had but one shrill string, (Whose notes like icy needles thro' me ran) And with a crack'd and creaking voice to sing “O fool, infatuated fool, forbear! For yonder is the Land of Ice and Snow, And She is dead that beckoneth to thee there, And dead forever are the dead I know.” Whilst thus that lean old man, with eyes aglare, Sang to his broken harp's one string below, The vultures scream'd above in the bleak air “Dead are the dead forever!” 10. “What art thou, Malignant wretch?” I cried. The old man said “I am the Ancient Porter of this Pass, Beyond which lies the Land of Ice and Snow. And all the dwellers in that land are dead, And dead forever are the dead I know. And this, my harp—I know not when, alas! But all its strings were broken long ago, Save one, which time makes tough. The others were Of sweeter tone, but this sounds more intense. And, for my name, some say it is Despair, And others say it is Experience.” Thereat he laugh'd, and shook his sordid rags, And his wan eyes with sullen malice gleam'd. And loud again, upon the icy crags, In that bleak air above, the vultures scream'd. SCORN. 1 Dim on its slighted altar died The sacred fire no victim fed: The god, who craved a gift denied, His own dread image seized instead: And headlong he hurl'd it the flames among, Thus choosing rather self-immolation Than a form that in vain to a faithless throng From his shrine appeal'd for a grudged oblation. The flames around it wreathed: The image was consumed, And into ashes fell. The god upon them breathed, Their fading spark relumed, And utter'd this oracle:— 2 “Go, dust wherein my power hath dwelt, Avenge on man a wrong divine, And the proud pain a god hath felt In some poor human soul enshrine!” The roused ashes arose and went forth on the wind: The divinity hid in them, high and low Hovering, sought where its force might find Means to greaten, and grow, and glow. A soul it found at last, A great soul wrong'd by fame, A grandeur grown forlorn: Into that soul it past Burningly, and became Wrong'd Grandeur's angel, Scorn. STRANGERS. (A RHAPSODY.) Children are born, about whose lucid brows The blue veins, visibly meandering, stream Transparent: children in whose wistful eyes Are looks like lost dumb creatures in a crowd, That roam, and search, and find not what they seek. These children are life's aliens. The wise nurse Shakes her head, murmuring “They will not live!” A piteous prophecy, yet best for them The death that, pitifully premature, Remits the pitiless penalty of birth; Letting the lost ones steal away unhurt, Because unnoticed, from a world not theirs. Strangers and star-born strayaways forlorn, Who come so careless of the outlandish wealth You carry with you, dropping as you go Treasures beyond the reach of Orient Kings, What seek you here where your unvalued gifts Shall leave you beggars for an alms denied? Earth yields not their equivalent. No field So profitless but some poor price it hath; A spurious picture or a spavin'd horse May find in time their willing purchasers; But never for its worth shall you exchange A soul's unmarketable opulence. And when at last, of those who (unenrich'd By your impovrishment) the gift forget, Your thirst and hunger crave a broken crust, A drop of water from the wayside well, Stripes shall correct such importunities. Linger not! live not! give not! Hide your gifts, Ungiven, deeper than Remembrance digs Among the haunted ruins she explores For riches lost. And if abrupt mischance Their buried store reveal, without a blush Disown it, for a lie may sometimes save A miser's life. The truth would serve as well, Were truth not unbelievable; for, stored In coin not current here and gems unprized, Your treasures are worth nothing to the wretch They tempt to make them, by a murder, his. But this the assassins know not, and ill-arm'd, Ill-arm'd and worse than weaponless, are you! To whose inefficacious grasp was given In solemn mockery the seraphic sword That only archangelic hands can hold. Your own have clutch'd it by the burning blade, And, when you wield it, 'tis yourselves you wound. You that have Feeling, think you to have all? Poor fools, and you have absolutely nought! In reckonings of this world's arithmetic Everything else is something by itself, Feeling alone is nothing. Could you add That nothing to what counts for anything, Forthwith a tenfold potency perchance The unreckonable zero might bestow Upon the reckon'd unit. But what boots A value so vicarious? Yours the spell Whose all-transfigurating sorceries Convert the dust man grovels in to gold; Robing the pauper royal in the pomp Of princely exultations, changing night To morning, death to life, the wilderness To paradise; beatifying pain, Cleansing impurity, and strewing thick The gulphs of Hell with starry gleams of Heaven. But use it not! Unsanction'd miracles Are sentenced sins. Writ large for all to read, About the world's street corners Reason posts “Beware of the Miraculous!” Whereto Prudence appends, the placard to complete, “Miracles are forbidden!” Use it not, Your gift unblest! Lo, Virtue's High Priest comes, Calls the Sanhedrim's long-phylacteried train, Consults the scriptured scrolls, within them finds No warrant for the wonders you perform, And them and you doth anathematise. Linger not! live not! give not! All your gifts Shall turn to stones and scourges in the hands That crave them, and to live is to be lost. Thou starry snowflake, whose still flight transforms The frozen crystal's constellated crown To an ethereal feather, seek not here, Celestial stranger, seek not here on earth, Where Purity were nameless but for thee, The warmth that wastes, the fervours that defile! Upon our wither'd branches hang not thou Thy votive wreaths, nor our bleak paths invest With thy pale presence! Vainly dost thou cling About our fasten'd casements, vainly spread So close beside our doors thy spotless couch. Behind them dwells Ingratitude. The voice That welcomed thine arrival will anon Resent thy lingering, and exclaim “Enough!” Trust not the looks that smile, the lips that sigh, “I love thee!” For to-day those words mean “Come!” To-morrow “Go!” Men's words are numberless, And yet in man's speech only the same word Means “No” to-morrow that meant “Yes” to-day. Linger not, live not, give not, you forlorn Gift-laden strangers! With your gifts ungiven, And so at least undesecrated, die! What fills with such invincibility The frail seed striving thro' the stubborn soil? The sun so long one herbless spot caress'd, That in the darkling germ beneath it stirr'd A tender trouble, and that trouble seem'd A promise. “Can it be, the Sun himself Hath sought me? He so glorious, he so great, And I so dark, so insignificant! Dear Sun, with all the strength thy love reveal'd, Responding to thy summons, I am here!” And the rich life of granaried Lybia glows Revelling already in a single grain. Doth the Sun answer, “Little one, too much Thou hast responded, now respond no more”? No, for throughout the illimitable heights And deeps of boundless Being, to attain It scarce suffices, at the most and best, To tend beyond the unattainable, And too much love is still not love enough. The Sun may set, but all his rising wrought To life's enraptured consciousness remains. The Sun disowns not, even when he deserts, What he put forth his fervours to evoke. Man's love alone its doing disavows, And makes denial of its dearest deed. Beneath a dead bird's long-uncared-for cage, That hangs forgotten in the cloister'd court Of some lone uninhabitable house, From the chink'd pavement slowly creeping comes A thin weak stem that opens like a heart, And puts forth tenderly two tiny hands Of benediction to that cage forlorn, Then dies, as tho' its little life had done All it was born to do. The flint-set earth Requites the dead bird's gift—one casual seed, And from her stony breast a blossom blows. But, pouring forth Uranian star-seed, strew Incipient heavens thro' all the hollowness Of human gratitude for gifts divine, And nothing from the sowing of such seed Shall blossom but the bitterness of death. O that the throbbing orb of this throng'd world, The sun-led seasons, the revolving years, Day with his glory, night with all her stars, The present, and the future, and the past, And earth, and heaven, should but a bauble be! The unvalued gift of an extravagant soul, Given undemanded, broken by a breath, The sport of one exorbitant desire, The easy spoil of one minute mischance, And all for nothing! What? the unheedful flint Spares room to house the blossom that requites A chance seed fallen from a dead bird's cage, And nothing, nothing, in the long long years, That bring to other losses soon or late The loss of loss remember'd, shall arise? Nothing, not even a penitential tear, A fleeting sigh, a momentary smile, The benediction of a passing thought Of pitiful remembrance—to repay The quite-forgotten gift of too much love! All other loss comparison avails To lessen, and all other ills worse ill May mitigate. Defeated monarchs find Cold comfort left in Cæsar's legions lost: The ruin'd merchant in the bankrupt State: The bedless beggar in the bed-rid lord. The sight of Niobe dries many tears, And by the side of open graves are graves Long seal'd, like old wounds cicatrised by time. But this is an immitigable ill, A lastingly incomparable loss, A forfeiture of refuge that exiles Its victim even from the lonest lodge Where Misery's leprous outcasts may at least Commiserate each other. The excess Of one o'erweening moment hath ursurpt The whole dominion of eternity; Yet even the usurpation was a fraud, For what seem'd all was nothing; and its dupes, Who mourn that moment's loss, have with it lost The right to say that it was ever theirs. Sceptic, approach and, into this abysm Of torment gazing, tremblingly believe! Behold in Hell the soul's appalling proof Of her dread immortality! What else Could for a moment undestroy'd endure The least of such annihilating pangs? Transmute them into corporal sufferings. Hurl Their victim from the visionary top Of some sky'd tower, and on its flinted base Shatter his crumpled carcass: if the heart Still beats, lay bare each lacerated nerve And sear with scorching steel the sensitive flesh: Or lift the bleeding ruins of the wretch, Lay them in down, bandage with cruel care The broken limbs, and nurse to life again Their swooning anguish: then from eyes that burn Chase slumber, and to lips that parch deny Release from thirst. It boots not! Flesh and blood Death to his painless sanctuary takes, And life's material mechanism stops. The first pang is the last. But all these pangs (And add to these what worse, if worse there be, The torturer's teeming art hath yet devised) Attain not the tenth part of those endured Without cessation by the soul that loves, When love is only suffering. What escape, What refuge, from self-torment hath the soul? Or what for love is left unoverthrown By love's own overthrow? The growth of love, Outgrowing the wide girdle of the world, Hath in itself absorb'd sun, moon, and stars, Life, Death, and Thought's illimitable realm, Leaving in Time no moment, and in Space No point, its omnipresence kindles not To palpitant incandescence—and what then? A word, nay not so much, a breath unbreathed, A look, and all this universe of love, Cramm'd with the curse of Tantalus, becomes A pitiless infinitude of fierce Importunate impossibilities, Where nothing is but what may never be. Fond wretch, with those insatiable eyes, Among the ruins of a world destroy'd What art thou seeking? Its destroyer? Look! He stands before thee. And thou knowst him not. The traitor of thy perisht universe Hath perisht with it. Nay, that world and he, Whose creature and creator was thyself, Save in thyself existed not. Away, Disown'd survivor of what never was! There is a sigh that hath no audible sound, And, like a ghost that hath no visible form, Breathing unheard thro' solitudes unseen, Its presence haunts the Desert of the Heart. Fata Morgana! Fair Enchantress, Queen Of all that ever-quivering quietness, There dost thou dreaming dwell, and there create Those fervid desolations of delight, Where dwell with thee the joys that never were! And, when in darkness fades the phantom scene, The wizard stars that nightly trembling light That undiscover'd loneliness are looks From eyes that love no longer. All the winds That whisper there are breaths of broken vows And perjured promises. The pale mirage That haunts the simmering hyaline above Is all the work of ghosts, and its bright wastes Teem with fantastic specters of the swoons Of prostrate passions, hopes become despairs, And dreams of bliss unblest. In that weird sky There is no peace, but a perpetual trance Of torturous ecstasy. Vext multitudes Of frantic apparitions mingle there, And part, and vanish, waving vaporous arms Of supplication—to each other lured, And by each other pantingly repulsed. The goblin picture of a passionate world Painted on nothingness! And all the sands, Heaved by the sultry sighings of the heart Of this unquietable solitude, Are waves that everlastingly roll on O'er wrecks deep-sunken in a shoreless sea Whose bed is vast oblivion. Out of sight, Into that sea's abysmal bosom pour'd, Flow all desires unsatisfied, all pains Unpitied, all affections unfulfill'd, And sighs, and tears, and smiles misunderstood. There all the adventurous argosies that sail'd In search of undiscover'd worlds, reduced To undiscoverable wrecks, remain. And there perchance, at last, no more estranged From all around them, since not stranger they Than all things else, where all things else are strange. In that wide strangeness unrejected rest The world's rejected strangers—loves unloved, And lives unlived, and longings unappeased. ALLEGRO, ANDANTE, ADAGIO. 1 A Sage had thro' the world fared far and wide: And what had made on him the most impression, Friends ask'd him: to whose question he replied By this confession: 2 “A traveller, whom it was my chance to meet Departing and arriving. For this man Mounted upon a fiery steed and fleet His way began; 3 And yet more eager even than his horse The man himself. With whip, and spur, and cry So fast he urged it on its rapid course That by and by 4 The horse, o'er-ridden, on the road expired. To go afoot its rider was constrain'd; But now the man, although himself untired, From haste refrain'd; 5 And, turning neither to the left nor right, He with deliberate stride began to wend Right onward, resolute to reach ere night His journey's end. 6 A peasant proffer'd him an ass for sale: That mode of travelling seem'd not to his mind: Scornful he scann'd the beast from head to tail— 'Twas lame and blind: 7 But, since no better means remain'd, he bought And mounted it. The ass at a snail's pace Jogg'd onward awkwardly, not caring aught For speed or grace; 8 Yet, all ungoaded, ere the day was done It brought the traveller to his place of rest. 'Twas there I met him, when the sinking sun Was in the west. 9 Mean was the hostel, but of wide resort. He ask'd me how 'twas named, then sigh'd ‘Already?’ As tho' to him the journey seem'd too short, The pace too steady. 10 Whereat I marvell'd that a man who show'd Such haste at starting, and arrived so late, Should sigh to quit the sorry beast he rode, When reach'd the gate.” 11 The listeners, when this trivial tale they heard, Found nothing in it to impress their mind: For such things happen daily, they averr'd, To all mankind. 12 “And for that reason, and because you say That such things happen in the common range Of every man's experience every day, I find it strange,” 14 The Sage replied, “Upon his journey bound, That traveller started on a steed all fire And mettle; yet too slow its space he found For his desire; 15 And when, no longer by his courser carried In headlong haste, but free to pause or stray, He might have sometimes turn'd aside, or tarried To admire the way, 16 Less haste was not more leisure: the man still Kept the main road, nor paused to pluck a flower, Or snatch a solace from the wayside rill, The woodland bower; 17 Desiring only ere the day was done To reach, tho' with diminisht speed at best, By pertinaciously still plodding on, His destined rest: 18 Yet when his sole means left were those combining The sloth and weakness of a grizzled ass, He found the pace too swift, and sigh'd, repining, ‘So soon? Alas!’” 19 “Your traveller was a fool,” the listeners cried, “But what of that? 'Tis nothing strange or new.” “My traveller was a man,” the Sage replied, “Like all of you.” 20 “For some of you are riding,” said the Sage, “A swift horse, your still swifter spirits spurn: And some an ass some walk. Youth, Manhood, Age, Each in its turn, 21 Are but the means that bring man, slow or fast, Whither he grieves to be. The slowest pace He finds the swiftest, as he nears at last His resting place. 22 And only one of all the things I've seen More moves my wonder than this traveller's lot.” “And what is that?” they ask'd. “Yourselves, I ween, Who wonder not.” THE END.</field>
