      <field name="fulltext">Thy story of Iacoby and his twelue sones. All yonge and olde that lyste for to here Of dedes done in the olde tyme By the holy patryarkes that there were Whiche descended of olde Adams lyne Often the sonne of grace on them dyde shyne For to rede this story it wyll do you moche good Of Abrahams sone that was syth Noes flood Unto one Rebecca this Ysaac was maryed Of aege the byble sayth he was .xl. yere In dede his maydenhede so longe with hym taryed And yet in longe tyme his wyfe no chylde bere Than to our lorde god he made his prayere For to sende hym fruyte this worlde to multeply And than his wyfe conceyued as scrypture dooth specyfy Two chyldren in dede had Rebecca in her body And whan they were quycke oftentymes they fought This good woman than meruayled gretely What it myght be and toke grete thought Than mekely our lorde god she besought To haue some knowlege what it myght sygnefye She toke so grete sorowe that the teres fell fro her eye Our lorde that all knoweth sawe how she fared With sobbynge and syghynge euermore cryenge Of his grete goodnes vnto her he appered And sayd woman cease thy grete wepynge Two maner of people ben in thy body spryngynge That shall be delyuered fro thy wombe shortly Of the whiche the feble shall ouercome the myghty At the laste her tyme neyghed very nere The throwes sore thrylled her thrugh with payne All her body was faynt apalled was her chere So delyuered she was of fayre chyldren twayne The fyrst that yssued was rough Esau called by name Than folowed Iacob his brothers fote holdynge Fast in his hande this was a meruaylous thynge Whan that they drewe to aege these two brether Esau was a plowman a tyller of londe And for pleasure ofte wolde be a hunter To walke erly and late with bowe in his honde Iacob was so symple at home wolde he stonde Alwaye with his moder for she loued hym better Than euer she hyde Esau a thousande tymes swetter Esau was best beloued yet with the fader Bycause he ete ofte of the venyson that he toke And Iacob was in fauour with Rebecca his moder Thus may ye it fynde yf that ye wyll loke Esau wente a huntynge thus sayth the boke All a daye togyder without mete or brede That whan he came home for hunger he was nye deed Whan he came to the hall he sawe Iacob stande There to his dyner than was Esau fayne Holdynge a dysshe of potage in his hande Alacke sayd Esau for hunger now do I complayne In all this worlde is no greter payne I praye the brother of thy potage let me ete with the Nay ywys quod Iacob thou getest none of me But yf thou wylte sayd Iacob sell me thyn herytage Ifayth of these thou getest neuer a dele And yf thou wylte do so holde here this potage For fayntnes than Esau to the grounde fell And sayd rather than dye my patrymony wyll I sell No thynge wolde it profyte me yf I dyed for honger For my bely weneth my throte is cut asonder I am content sayd Esau that thou it take for thy potage Well than quod Iacob yf thou wylte resyne I wyll haue the swere that as for thyn herytage Thou shalte neuer clayme and here lye hande in myne Poore Esau thought it longe or that he myght dyne And sayd vnto Iacob now take it for euer Thy potage in my hande haue had I leuer This bargayne was knytte bothe partyes were gladde Esau ete the potage therof he was fayne And I trowe Iacob had no cause to be sadde His broders herytage there dyde he clayme These promyses made bytwene them twayne And than Iacob thought to lyue full meryly With the londe that Esau dyde set full lytell by At the last theyr fader wexed blynde and myght not se And on a daye he called Esau his sone Ysaac sayd chylde Esau come hyther to me For my lyue dayes be nere hande done Therfore go forth and fette me some venysone And as soone as thou doost it home brynge Come to me and thou shalte haue my blessynge Esau dyde on his harneys for drede of beestes wylde By his gyrdell arowes and in his hande a bowe And than by his owne moder Esau was begylde For as soone as Rebecca dyde it knowe Forth she called Iacob and to hym dyde showe All togyder and sayd sone yf thou wylte do after me Esau shall lese his faders blessynge for he shal gyue it the Go thou to the flocke and fette me kyddes twayne The best that amonge them may be founde Than Iacob of this counseyle was full fayne To the felde hasted hym swyftly in that stounde And chase the best that were goynge in that grounde Than home to his moder he them brought So poore Esau was begyled that no falshede thought Than of the kyddes flesshe Rebecca sodde grete plente And made Ysaac ete in stede of venyson Loo the blynde often drynketh many a flye Than the moder made Iacob to take the kyddes skyn To wrappe his handes his face and his necke therin Well sayd Rebecca yf thy fader fele the rough of here He wyll byleue none other but that thou Esau were Olde Ysaac the blynde began to wexe hongry And called Rebecca and sayd that he wolde ete Suche as she had prayed her swyftly Hote or elles colde hym for to gete Rebecca answered and sayd ye shall haue mete For Esau hath brought plentye of venysone Why quod Iacob is he come home so soone Ye sayd Rebecca he is come ywys Flesshe hath he brought I sawe neuer none better In all my lyfe neuer fatter than it is Syth ye were borne neuer ete ye swetter I am gladde sayd Ysaac I loue hym the better Than Rebecca fette therof Ysaac for to please He was hongry and ete fast and made hym well at ease Than Iacob spake to his fader for his blessynge And on the grounde he kneled on his kne Fader he sayd this venyson home dyde I brynge Now I haue fulfylled that whiche ye badde me Why sayd Ysaac arte thou Esau/and he sayd ye To fele thy skynne quod ysaac I haue grete lust And yf thou be Esau I shall the knowe I trust Than Iacob rose and wente to his fadere And sayd to hym wyll ye fele my hande Than Ysaac felte it rough all of here He wende it had ben Esau that by hym dyde stande But alas he wandred ouer the lande Amonge busshes and brambles he dyde ron And no knowlege had he of this grete treason I knowe well sayd Ysaac that thou arte Esau And by speche I wolde take the for Iacob Now blessyd be this daye that euer I it knewe For thou shalte be mayster of many a lande brode And haue the blessynge of the heuenly lorde Therfore come hyther let me kysse thy mouth All men shall obey to the bothe by north and south Where euer thou become thou shalte haue plente All the trybes shall euer worshyp thy name With the peas wyll dwell and all prosperyte They that the curseth shall be cursed agayne The for to please men wyll be full fayne And the sones of theyr moders shall bowe to the Batayles many thou shalte wynne bothe by londe &amp; see Than Iacob rose and wente his waye With that came Esau that moche venyson brought And bare it to his fader and thus dyde he saye Fader this flesshe full ferre haue I sought So sodeynly Ysaac was smyten with a thought And sayd what arte thou fro whens doost thou come Forsothe I am Esau your fyrst begoten sone Ysaac meruayled more than may be thought credybyll And longe or he myght speke in a traunce laye As the mayster of the story sayth so dyde he lye styll Lyke as the soule from the body had ben awaye Whan he dyde speke/o good lorde dyde he saye Thy wyll is that Iacob sholde haue my blessynge Yet loued I Esau aboue all erthly thynge Who was that sayd Ysaac that brought me the venysone Euen now that I had therwith dyde I dyne I wende it had ben Esau myn owne sone Alas sayd Esau fader that blessynge sholde be myne Iacob hath me begyled now the seconde tyme Longe agone also for a mese of potage He had my patrymony that was myn herytage Alas sayd Esau my herte is very woo And sayd fader haue ye not one blessynge for me I truste that all from me be not agoo Ysaac sayd sone there is no remedye I haue ordeyned hym to be thy lorde ouer the Thou shalte obey thy broder and lyue by thy swerde All that beholdeth thy face shall be aferde Rebecca wende that Esau Iacob wolde haue slayne And badde hym hye and go out of his daungere Unto thyn owne vncle that dwelleth in arayne For and thou taryest thy lyfe standeth in fere Esau wyll the kyll I herde hym so swere Therfore in all the haste Iacob be gone And whan his angre is past agayne come home Than Iacob departed from Barsabe And wente full faste towarde arayne Ysaac and Rebecca wepte full pyteously So Iacob hyed ouer hethe and playne The sonne drewe downe/his rest he wolde haue fayne And as he slepte hym thought that he dyde se A longe ladder stretchynge to the skye Aungelles goynge vpwarde he sawe also And in the myddes almyghty god dyde stonde That sayd to hym I wyll blysse the where euer thou go And to thy sede I wyll gyue this londe That thou doost on slepe it shall be in thy honde For I am the god of Abraham that thou doost se And I caused Ysaac his blyssynge to gyue the Than Iacob rose on the mornynge erly And sayd that there was the gate of heuen Of all the erth that place was moost holy And thanked god for that whiche he had sene And vnder his heed a stone that was full clene He rered vp and set it on the ende There prayed he god good fortune hym to sende Than Iacob wente forth in to the eest Tyll he came to a grete pyt of water Thre flocke of shepe with many an other beest He sawe how they laye all in that corner Than he thought they wolde drynke of that water And custome men had to roll awaye the stone The beestes sholde go in and drynke euerychone Iacob sawe shepeherdes fro hym not very for And asked of whens they were/and they sayd of Arayne Knowe you Laban quod Iacob sone of Nachor They all answered ye we knowe hym for certayne Loo syr yonder cometh Rachell we tell you playne That is Labans doughter with his flocke of shepe God saue that kynrede sayd Iacob &amp; fro care them kepe Than Iacob wente and kyssed Rachell full swetely And tolde her that Rebecca was his moder Rachell was gladde of that tydynge truly Eche of them made grete Ioye of other Of curtesy Iacob coude do none other With strength pulled the stone fro the pyttes brynke That Rachelles shepe therof myght drynke Than Rachell bare tydynges to her fader That Iacob Rebeccaes sone was come Laban was gladde that tydynge to here And for to mete hym hastely he dyde ronne The foules were neuer gladder of the lyght of the sonne Than were they twayne for eche salewed other For Laban was Iacobs vncle Rebeccas owne brother There Iacob dyde them playnly to vnderstonde That he had wonne his faders blessynge The gladder was Laban to haue hym in that londe He thought that plente sholde growe of euery thynge Bothe corne and grasse grete plente wolde sprynge Laban prayed Iacob there to lede his lyfe And he wolde gete hym Rachell to be his wyfe There Iacob promysed to serue them .vij. yere With hym to abyde and be bothe true and playne And for to haue Rachell to be his fere Eyther of that bargayne was full fayne All his yeres he serued bothe in colde and ra[yne] And on a day Laban maryed Iacob to Rachel his childe But as they were in bedde brought Iacob was begylde The elder doughter that was called Lea They brought to Iacobs bedde vnknowynge To hym and all nyght by his syde laye But whan he sawe her in the mornynge He sayd there was vnkynde delynge To brynge hym Lea for fayre Rachell Iacob sayd to Laban this dede lyketh me not well Fayre syr sayd Laban it is the lawe of this lande That the elder doughter fyrst maryed sholde be Bothe Lea and Rachell thou shalte haue in thy hande But other seuen yere thou must dwell with me Therto I gra?t quod Iacob these yeres wyll I serue the And the nexte weke agayne wyll I be maryed Unto fayre Rachell for her longe haue I taryed To bothe was he maryed Rachell bode longe barayne But Lea conceyued and bare her chylde Rubyne For Iacob loued Rachell in euery vayne Better than euer he dyde Lea for all her chyldren For she was somwhat blere eyed and had sore eyen Yet she bare hym .x. sones the boke sayth playne Where as Rachell brought hym forth but twayne Iacob thought in that countre he had longe taryed With labour he bode out full .xiiij. yere Than whan his hole terme he had out serued He sayd to Rachell I wyll tary no lenger here Now to Barsabe wyll I go I nede not to fere As for Esau my broder I trust wyll be my frende What euer me betyde to my countre wyll I wende Iacob sayd to Laban that to barsabe he wolde Laban badde hym byde with hym that yere And what euer he asked haue it he sholde I desyre quod he the lambes of dyuers coler And yf thou wylte graunt me that to my hyer With all other beestes that blacke spotted be And for all this twelue monethes I wyll byde with the Bothe beestes and lambes I gyue the sayd Laban All that euer blacke spotted be Clayme them for thyn whan they come fro the dame Than sayd Iacob for this hyre I wyll abyde with the In fayth sayd Laban it shall not be broken for me So Iacob pylled roddes where the shepe sholde gone Bestes &amp; lambes were spotted that yere nye euerychone The nexte yere after Laban sayd he wolde Haue all the spotted and Iacob than the whyte To his parte in dede he haue sholde Our lorde for Iacob shewed his myght That all the beestes or lambes that fell daye or nyght They were clene whyte the moost parte ywys Than was he wroth that his flocke was bygger than his Iacob spyed that Laban frowned of chere And tolde pryuely his wyfe Rachell That he wolde be gone for he Laban dyde fere Than he conuayed all his herdmen softely and styll And bad them hye with theyr beestes to galard y? hye hyll Bothe with asses and camelles thyder make hyenge And my wyues with my .xij. sones after wyll I brynge So forth wente Iacob bothe with good and catell And sent worde that he was comynge to Esau his broder Laban myssed Iacob and had grete meruell He knewe that he was gone and se it wolde be none other Yet wolde I kysse my doughters for I am theyr fader It was tolde hym by a man of that countrey That Iacob was at mo?tgalard/of .vij. dayes Iourney. Than Laban rode after thus sayth the boke On a good camell bothe nyght and daye Yet at the laste he Iacob ouertoke He asked of hym whether he wolde that waye Unto my countre sayd Iacob who wyll saye naye Not I sayd Laban by my chyldren kysse I wolde And thy twelue sones also I loue better than golde There of all his kynrede Laban toke his leue And asked Iacob why he wente so hastely You were wrothe quod Iacob and that dyde I preue Yet twenty yere I haue serued the besyly In colde and in rayne attende to thy husbandry And to go from the sodeynly. I was full fayne Lest thou by some treason me wolde haue slayne Nay nay sayd Laban I wolde not do so But for all the treasour in Egypte I am sory that thou wylte from vs go With thy asses camelles and thy shepe I praye the Iacob my doughters well to kepe And I trust than our lorde god wyll blysse the That thy gr?dfader worshypped (one) in stede of thre So Iacob and Laban toke leue eche of other And
