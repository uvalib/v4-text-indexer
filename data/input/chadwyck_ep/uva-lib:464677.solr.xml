      <field name="fulltext">The first part consisting of Hymns Occasionall The pagination of the source document has been followed. Hymne. I. A generall Invitation to praise God. This Hymn stirreth up to the praise of God, by a Poeticall Invitation of the Creatures to the performance of that Dutie according to their severall Faculties and Dignities. And, it is a preamble to the following Hymns. [1] Come, oh come in pious Laies, Sound we God-Almighti's praise. Hither bring in one Consent, Heart, and Voice, and Instrument. Musick adde of ev'ry kinde; Sound the Trump, the Cornet winde. Strike the Violl, touch the Lute. Let nor Tongue, nor String be mute: Nor a Creature dumb be found, That hath either Voice or Sound. 2 Let those Things which do not live In Still-Musick, praises give. Lowly pipe, ye Wormes that creep, On the Earth, or in the Deep. Loud-aloft, your Voices strain, Beasts, and Monsters of the Main. Birds, your warbling Treble sing. Clouds, your Peales of Thunders ring. Sun and Moon, exalted higher, And bright Stars, augment this Quire. 3 Come ye Sons of Humane-Race, In this Chorus take a place; And, amid the mortall-Throng, Be you Masters of the Song. Angels, and supernall Powr's, Be the noblest Tenor yours. Let in praise of God, the sound Run a never-ending Round; That our Song of praise may be Everlasting as is HE. 4 From Earths vast and hollow wombe, Musicks deepest Base may come. Seas and Flouds, from shore to shoare, Shall their Counter-Tenors roare. To this Consort, (when we sing) Whistling Winds your Descants bring. That our Song may over clime, All the Bounds of Place and Time, And ascend from Sphere to Sphere, To the great All-mightie's eare. 5 So, from Heaven, on Earth, he shall Let his gracious Blessings fall: And this huge wide Orbe, we see Shall one Quire, one Temple be; Where, in such a Praise, full Tone We will sing, what he hath done, That the cursed Fiends below, Shall thereat impatient grow. Then, oh Come, in pious Laies, Sound we God-Almighties praise. Hymne. II. When we first awake. It is Gods mercy that our Sleep is not to Death: and, therefore whensoever we awake, it becometh us to lift up our hearts to God in this, or in the like Meditation. Sing this as the 25. or 67. Psalmes. [1] Dear God! that watch dost keep Round all that honour Thee. Vouchsafing thy Beloved sleep, When Rest shall needfull be: My Soul returns thee praise, That thus refresh'd I am; And that my tongue a voice can raise, To praise thee for the same. 2 As now my Soul doth shake Dull Sleep, out of her eies; So let thy Spirit me awake, That I from sin may rise. The Night, is past away, Which fill'd us full of fears; And we enjoy the glorious Day, Wherein thy Grace appears. 3 Oh! let me, therefore, shun All Errors of the Night. Thy Righteousnesse let me put on, An walk as in the Light. And guard me from his powre, (Since I on thee relie) Who walks in darknesse to devour When our Long-sleep draws nigh. 4 Yea, when the Trump shall sound Our Summons from the Grave, Let this my Body from the ground, A blessed Rising have. That (whatsoe're the Dreames, Of my Corruption be) The Vision of thy Glorie's Beames, May bring full Joyes to me. Hymne III. When Day-light appears. When we first behold the renewed Light, our thoughts should be lifted up to the Father of Lights, by whose mercy we escape the perils of Darknesse: And it would become us, otherwhile to praise him, and instruct our selves, in this, or the like Meditation. Sing this as the 51 Psal. or the Lamentation, &amp;c. [1] Look forth mine eye; look up and view How bright the Day-light shines on me. And as the Morning doth renew, Mark how renew'd Gods mercies be. Behold, the Splendors of the Day, Disperse the shadows of the Night; And, they who late in Darknesse lay, Have now the comforts of the Light. 2 Nor Twilight-plagues, nor Midnight-Fears, Nor mortall, nor immortall Foes, Had powre to take us in their snares; But safe we slept, and safe arose. And to those Daies which we have had, He that is Lord of Day and Night, Another Day vouchsafes to add, That our lost houres redeeme we might. 3 It is too much to have made voide So many daies already past: Let this, therefore, be so employ'd, As if we knew it were our last. Most Creatures, now, themselves advance, Their Morning-Sacrifice to bring; The Heards do skip, the Flocks do dance, The windes do pipe, the Birds do sing. 4 Lord, why should these, who were decreed, To serve thee in a lower-place, In thankfull-Duties, us exceed, Who have obtain'd the highest grace? We are oblig'd much more then those Our voice in thankfull Sounds to raise: Therefore oh God! our lips unclose; And teach our Tongues to sing thy praise. 5 Let heart, and hand, and voice accord, This Day, to magnifie thy Name: And let us ev'ry Day, oh Lord! Continue to performe the same. So when that Morning doth appear, In which thou shalt all Flesh destroy; We shall not be awak'd with fear, But, rise and meet thy Son with Joy. Hymne IIII. When we put on our Apparell The putting on of our Apparell, may occasion many considerations, helpfull to keep us mindfull of our Frailties; of our Wants; and of some Caveats preventing errors and snares, whereinto we may, els, fall er'e the Day be past. Sing this as the Magnificat, or Te Deum. [1] Lord, had not man sought out by sin, What should have been unknown; His nakednesse unfelt had bin, And, wiser he had grown. But, in the stead, of what he thought By lawlesse means, to know, The knowledge of that want, was taught, Which brings the sense of woe. 2 Had he as forward striv'd to be, The Fruit of Life, to taste, As on the Death-procuring-Tree, A lustfull Eye to cast; The Blesse which was for him prepar'd, In Soul, he had obtain'd: And in his Body, also shar'd The Blessing, preordain'd. 3 But, since the Flesh, did presse to see Her wants before the time; Both Soul and Flesh afflicted be For that presumptuous Crime: And, cumbred so, with pains and care, To purchase Cloth and Food; That little their endeavours are, To seek their Chiefest-Good. 4 Lord! with a Robe of Innocence, Thy Servant so aray, That, it may take the painfull sense, Of outward wants away. Yea, let thy Justice cloth me so, That I incurre no blame; Nor through my sin so naked grow, As to augment my shame. 5 And let the Garments which I weare, My tender Flesh to hide, Be neither made a lustfull-snare, Nor Ensignes of my pride. But, rather be a means to show The folly of that Deed, By which man fell; and fell so low, As these poore Toyes to need. Hymne V. A morning Hymne. Many dangers hang over us all the Day. Therefore, before we adventure forth to follow our Affaires we might be the more safe, if we were first charmed by such Invocations as these. Sing this as the Pater-noster. [1] Since thou hast added, now, ô God! Vnto my life, another Day; And giv'st me leave to walk abroad, And labour in my lawfull way: My Walks and Works, with me begin; Conduct me forth, and bring me, in. 2 In ev'ry powre my Soul injoyes Internall Vertues to improve; In ev'ry Sense that shee employes, In her externall Works to move, Blesse her ô God! and keep me sound, From outward harme, and inward wound. 3 Let Sin nor Sathans fraud prevaile, To make mine eye of Reason blind, Or Faith, or Hope, or Love to faile, Or any Vertues of the Minde; But, more and more, let them encrease; And bring me to mine end, in peace. 4 Lewd Courses, let my Feet forbeare; Keep thou my Hands from doing wrong: Let nor Ill-Counsels pierce mine Eare, Nor Wicked-words defile my Tongue. And keep the windows of each Eye That no strange Lust climbe in thereby. 5 But, guard thou safe my Heart, in chief, That neither Hate, Revenge, nor Feare; Nor vain-Desire, vain-Joy, or Grief, Obtain Command or Dwelling, there: And Lord, with ev'ry saving-Grace, Still, true to thee, maintain that Place. 6 From open-wrongs, from secret-hates, Preserve me, likewise Lord this Day: From slandrous Tongues, from wicked Mates, From ev'ry Danger in my Way: My Goods to me, secure thou, too; And prosper all the Works I do. So, till the Evening of this Morn, My Time shall then so well be spent, That, when the Twi-light shall return, I may enjoy it with content; And to thy praise, and honour say, That this hath prov'd a happy-Day. Hymne VI. A Hymne whilst we are washing. Though Water be a common Blessing; yet we receive many great Benefits thereby, and cannot live conveniently without it. If, therefore, we sometimes remember to be thankfull in the use of it, and to sanctifie it with such like Meditations, as these, it will become Holy-water unto us. Sing this as the 1. 4. or 30. Psalmes. [1] As we by Water wash away Vncleannesse from our flesh, And, sometimes, often in a day, Our selves are faine to wash: So, ev'ry Day, Thoughts, Words, or Deeds, The Soul do sully, so, That often, ev'ry day, she needs Vnto her Cleanser go. 2 Our Sins purgation doth require, Sometime, a Flond of Teares; Sometime the painfull purging-Fire, Of Torments, Griefs, or Fears: And all this Cleansing will be lost, (When we our best shall do) Vnlesse we by the Holy-Ghost, May be baptized too. 3 Lord, by thy Sanctifying-Spirit, And, through my Faith in thee, (Made acceptable by thy Merit) Purge, Wash and Cleanse thou mee. And, as this Water purifies My Bodies outward blots, So, cleanse thou, by thy Blood, likewise, My Souls internall spots. 4 And, since this usefull Element, Thou freely dost afford, (In using it) let me present Due thanks to thee ô Lord! And, then, accept that Sacrifice, (Though cheap, and mean it be.) And, do not those Requests despise, Which I preferre to thee. Hymne VII. When we enjoy the benefit of the Fire. Fire is a Creature, both beneficiall and harmfull, (according to our heedfulnesse, and Gods blessing.) Therefore, this Hymne serves both to remember us to be thankfull for the good received; and to beseech Gods protection from the dangers of it. Sing this as the 2. 6. or 7. Psalmes. [1] Bvt that, no wonders, Things appear, Which ev'ry Day we see, This Fire, whose warmth our flesh doth chear, A wondrous-thing would be: For, while by Fewell it is fed, (Which we therefore provide) Arayd in shining White and Red, It will with us abide. 2 But, when the same we do neglect, It quickly flies away; And sometime (for our disrespect) Vpon our Goods, doth prey. If guided well, it is a Friend: If not; it proves a Foe, Which bringeth Cities to an end, And Realmes may overthrow. 3 Lord, since this Creature, much we need, And harm'd thereby may be, (Vnlesse we take thereof good heed) From harmes, preserve us free. Yea, thankfull make, for that which warms, And which we now enjoy: And keep us ever from the harms, Of that, which doth destroy. Hymne VIII. Before we begin our Work. When we are preparing towards our daily employments, their Beginnings, would finde the better successefull endings, if we did otherwhile, Sing, Say, or Think somewhat to this purpose. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] Since thou hast Lord, appointed so, That Man by labour must be fed; Loe, with a chearefull mind I go To labour for my daily-bread. I doe not at my Lot repine, (Though others live much more at ease) But, I subject my Will to thine; And thy Good pleasure me shall please. 2 Let what I purpose now to doe, Be fully pleasing unto Thee; And give a good successe thereto, That profit thence may spring to mee. Be thou the Author of each Deed, VVhich now by me shall be begun: VVith me throughout my works proceed; And perfect them, when I have done. Hymne IX. VVhen we are at our Labour. Many use to mitigate the tediousnesse of their Lobours by singing. Therefore (to encourage labouring men at their Works) some Priviledges of a laborious life; and some Petitions, befitting such as live by Labour, are the subject of this Hymn. Sing this as the 14. or 15. Psalmes. [1] VVhy should I grieve that I was made (VVhil'st others take no paine) To labour at a toylesome Trade, My body to maintaine? And, that to compasse Cloth and Meat, My Lot no meanes doth grant, Vntill my Browes or Braines do sweat To get me what I want? 2 Or, wherefore, by a murm'ring Tongue, Should I augment my Care, Because I am not rang'd among Those Drones that Idlers are? For, Labour yeelds me true content, (Though few the same doe see) And, when my toyling houres are spent, My Sleeps the sweeter be. 3 Though Labour was enjoin'd at first, To be a Curse for Sin, Yet Man, by being so accurst, May skrew a Blessing in. And, He that with a patient minde, This pennance doth sustaine, Shall by his paines true pleasures finde, And many comforts gaine. 4 Whilst honest Labours are applide, We vexe our Ghostly Foe; And in our hearts, he is denide, His harmfull Tares, to sowe. A thousand mischiefes we avoyd, When he would us intrap: Which they, who are not so imployd, But rarely do escape. 5 It makes our Bread more sweet then theirs, Who idly spend their wealth: We seldome have so many Cares, And live in better health. If we, at Night, begin to tire, Next Morning, fresh we grow; And for our Meat, or for our hire, To worke againe we go. 6 Men seldome heare us crying out (As Idler Folk have done) By reason of the lazie Gout, The Collick, or the Stone: But, when our strength consum'd we have, That Ripenes doth increase, Which makes us ready for the Grave, And there, we rest in peace. 7 Lord grant me health, and strength to beare The Labours laid on me; And in those Works to persevere, Whereto I call'd shall be. And let me finde, by what thy Grace Hath for my Soul prepar'd, That, he who works in meanest Place, May gaine the best Reward. Hymne. X. After our Worke is done. Lest (when we have accomplished our intended Works) we lose the benefit of our Labours, by Jmprovidence or Vnthankfulnesse; We are hereby put in remembrance to beseech of God that we forfeit not the comfort of them, by our sins. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] That I unthankfull may not be, Now this my worke is fully done, VVith Praises Lord, I come to thee, In whom it was at first begun: For if my Pains hath compast ought, From whence, a profit may redound; Thy Grace, the same in me hath wrought: Else, fruitlesse, had my deeds been found. 2 Let not my Folly, nor my Foe, Nor past, nor future sins, destroy The Labours, which I did bestow An honest profit to enjoy. But, make my Paines, and their Effect, To me, still, prosp'rously succeed; And let me never Lord, neglect To praise thee, both in Will and Deed. Hymne. XI. VVhen we depart from home. When we depart from home, every step is attended with some Hazzard, or Temptation, whereby we may be endangered, if God prevent not. To him therefore, we should lift up our hearts to this effect. Sing this as the 16. or 18 Psalmes, &amp;c. [1] VVho knows, when he to go from home, Departeth from his dore, Or when, or how, he back shall come? Or, whether never more? For, some, who walk abroad in health, In sicknesse, back are brought: And, some, who forth have gone with wealth, Have back-return'd with nought. 2 Lord, therefore now I goe abroad, My Guard, I thee confesse; And humbly beg of thee ô God! My going-forth to blesse. Go with me, whether I would go; Stay with me, where I stay: Do for me, what I ought to do; Speake Thou, what I should say. 3 From taking wrong, from doing harme, From Thoughts and Speeches ill; From Passions rage, from pleasures charme, Vouchsafe to keep me still. Let me abroad, some Blessing finde; And let no curse the while, Befall to that I leave behinde, My honest Hopes to spoile. 4 But let my Going-out and In, My Thoughts, my Words, and Waies, Be alway safe; Still, free from Sin, And, ever to thy praise. And, when my pains effect shall take; Or, Times of stay are spent; With Health, and Credit, bring me backe, With Comfort and Content. Hymne. XII. When we returne Home. Though our Affaires may not permit us to sing upon all such occasions, yet we ought at all times to be thankfull: and we have, at least, leisure enough to Meditate to this purpose, when we returne home. Sing this as the former Hymne. [1] Since, Lord thou hast well pleased bin, (As now it may appeare) To beare me forth, to bring me in, And set me safely here; I, who deserved not this Grace, Should far lesse worthy be, If I repay not in this place, The thanks I owe to thee. 2 My Tongue therfore, Oh Lord (my King) Now soundeth out thy praise: My heart the self same strain doth sing; And, thus to thee it sayes: Thou art my God; and never shall Another God be mine; And Kingdomes, Powers, and Glories, all For ever shall be thine. Hymne. XIII. At Noone-tide. We have usually some refreshings as well at Noone-tide, as in the Mornings and Evenings. Therefore, the singing of a Meridian-Hymne, to this, or the like purpose is not impertinent. Sing this as the former Hymne. [1] Now that the Sun is at his height, And brightest Beames displaies; We to the Father of this Light Will sing a song of praise: For since that Lampe can shine so cleare, And guild so large a Skye, VVhat Splendor doth in him appeare, VVho made that glorious Eye! 2 How happy in the Light, we be VVhich from this Planet flowes, Inform'd we are (in some degree) VVhen from our view he goes: For, Blessings, at the full, receiv'd, Appear not so, at best, As when we are, awhile, depriv'd Of that which was possest. 3 Both for this meanes of outward sight, VVe praise thee Lord, therefore, And, for those Beames of Inward Light, VVhich make that Blessing, more. Vouchsafe, that whilst this happy-Day Of double-grace doth last, My feet may travell in the way Which thou commanded hast. 4 Those works of Darknesse make me shun, Which my chiefe practise were: Those Armes of Light, let me put on, Which I am bound to beare. That when the Night of Death shall close The Daylight of mine Eies, I may without affrights repose; And with true Joyes arise. Hymne. XIIII. At Sun-setting. The singing or meditating to such purposes as are intimated in this Hymne (when we see the Sun declining) may perhaps expell unprofitable musings, and arme against the Terrors of approaching darknesse. Sing this as the former. [1] Behold, the Sun that seem'd, but now, Enthroned over-head, Beginneth to decline below This Globe, whereon we tread: And, he whom, yet, we looke upon VVith comfort and delight; VVill quite depart from hence, anon, And leave us to the Night. 2 Thus Time (unheeded) steales away The life which Nature gave. Thus, are our Bodies ev'ry Day Declining to the Grave. Thus, from us all those Pleasures flie, VVhereon we set our hart: And, when the Night of death draws nigh, Thus will they all depart. 3 Lord! though the Sun forsake our sight, And mortall hopes are vain, Let, still, thine Everlasting Light, VVithin our Soules remain. And in the Nights of our Distresse Vouchsafe those Raies-divine VVhich from the Sun of Righteousnesse, For ever brightly shine. Hymne XV. In cleare Starry Night. By contemplating the Beauty of the Stars (which were created for the service of Man) we are taught to consider the speciall and unspeakable Mercies of God, vouchsafed in Christ Iesv. Sing this as the Lamentation. [1] Lord! when those glorious Lights I see VVith which thou hast adorn'd the Skies; (Observing how they moved bee, And how their Splendor fils mine Eies) Me thinks it is too large a Grace, (But that thy Love ordain'd it so) That Creatures in so high a Place, Should servants be to Man below. 2 The meanest Lampe, now shining there, In size, and luster doth exceed The noblest of thy Creatures, here; And of our friendship hath no need. Yet, These, upon Mankinde attend, For secret Ayde, or publike Light: And, from the Worlds extreamest end, Repaire unto us, ev'ry Night. 3 Oh! had that Stampe been undefac'd VVhich, first, on us thy hand had set, How highly should we have been grac'd! Since, we are so much honour'd, yet? Good God! for what, but for the sake Of thy Belov'd, and Only-Sonne, (VVho did on him, our nature take) VVere these exceeding Favours done? 4 As we by Him, have honour'd bin, Let us to Him, due honours give: Let His uprightnesse hide our Sin; And let us Worth from Him receive. Yea, so let us by Grace improve VVhat thou by Nature, dost bestow; That, to thy Dwelling place above, VVe may be raised from below. Hymne XVI. In a darke Night. Darknes is uncomfortable to all, and very dreadfull to many: Therefore, we prepared this Hymne, that such as are fearefull, may have wherewith to comfort their hearts against the terrors of Darknes. Sing this as the 19, 20, or 21. Psalmes. [1] VVhat though the comforts of the Light, This gloomy Night denies? Though me to trouble, and affright, Vnwelcome Darknes tries. VVhat should I doubt? whom should I feare? Or why disheartned be, Since thou ô God! art ev'ry where, And present, still, with me? 2 VVhat mischiefes hath a Midnight howre, My Terror to procure? VVhat warrant hath a Noon-tide powre My safety to assure? I finde no comforts in the Day, If thou thy presence hid'st; Nor can the Darknes me dismay If near me, thou abid'st. 3 Indeed, the F[illeg.]a that hates the light, Doth oft occasion take, Amid the darknesse of the Night, This Bugge-beare showes, to make: Yet, sure, the Darknesse of our Minds Is that, whereby this Foe, Most frequently, occasions finds, The greatest harmes to doe. 4 Me, from that Darknesse to defend Thy Grace, ô Lord afford. To me th'enlightening Spirit lend, And Lanthorne of thy Word. For then, though Egypts Darknesse had Inclos'd me round about; (Yea, though I sate in Death's blacke Shade) That Light should guide me out. Hymne XVII. An Evening Hymne. Lest Bruit-creatures rise in judgement against us for neglect of thankfulnesse. This Hymne of Praise is tendred to be a Remembrancer, and a Help for the better performance of that Duty. Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandements. [1] Lord, should we oft forget to sing A thankfull Evening-Song of praise; This Duty, they to mind might bring, VVho chirpe among the bushy-spraies. For, to their Pearches they retire, VVhen first the twilight waxeth dim; And, ev'ry night that sweet-voic'd Quire, Shuts up the Day-light with a Hymn. 2 Ten thousand fold more cause have we, To close each Day with praisefull voice; To offer thankfull hearts to thee; And in thy Mercies, to rejoice. For, from thy Ward-robe cloth'd we are: Our Health we do by thee retaine: Our Dayly-bread thou do'st prepare; And givest Ease, when we have paine. 3 Thou mak'st us Glad, when we are greev'd: When we are tir'd, thou bringest Rest: In wants we are by the Releev'd; And Succour'd when we are opprest. These favours, Lord, and many moe, (Ev'n moe then here we can recite) Thou ev'ry Morning do'st bestowe; And them renewest ev'ry Night. 4 Therefore, for all thy Mercies past; For those this Evening doth afford; And which for times to come, thou hast; We give thee hearty thanks, ô Lord! Continu'd let thy Bounties be; And, from our Ghostly Foes despight, (Though we deserve it not from thee) Defend us this ensuing-night. 5 When we shut up, in darknesse, lie, Let not the guilt of any Sin, Appeare, our Soules to terrifie With Frights, which bring Despairings in. But free from harmes and slavish Feare, Let us a Peacefull Rest obtaine; That when the Morning shall appeare We may renew thy Praise againe. Hymne XVIII. Another Evening Hymn. In this Hymne, God is praised, and his protecting and preventing Grace implored, to secure us from the dangers and Temptations of the Night, and it is intended for an Evening-Hymn. [1] Now the cheerfull Day is past, And the Beauties of the Light, Are with shadowes, overcast, By the Mantle of the Night. Thanks to thee, ô Lord! I pay For each Blessing of this Day; Asking Grace for ev'ry Sin, Whereby err'd I have therein. 2 Though the Sun hath left us now, And withholds his Light from me; Lord, From hence depart not thou, Nor in Darknesse, let me be. But the Raies of grace divine, Cause thou round me still to shine; And, with Mercy overspred Both my Person, and my Bed. 3 Chase all wicked Fiends, from hence, That they doe me no despight, By deluding of the Sense, Through the Darknesse of the Night. But, ô Lord, from all my Foes, Let thine Angels me enclose; And protect me in my sleep, When my selfe I cannot keep. 4 Whil'st my Body taketh rest, Let my Soule attend on thee. Let no dreame to me suggest Fancies that unchaste may be. Whether I shall wake or sleep, Me in Mind and Body keep, Not from Acts of Sin alone, But, from dreaming they are done. 5 And since Death and Sleep are said, Some resemblances to have; In my Bed ere I am laid So prepare me for my Grave; That with comfort wake I may, To enjoy the following day, Or, (if Death close up mine eies) Rest in Hope, till all shall rise. Hymne XIX. When we put off our Apparell. Whilest we are putting off our Apparell, the singing of this briefe Hymne, will be neither tedious nor unprofitable; seeing we may thereby prepare aswell our Minds as our Bodies for the better enjoying of a comfortable Rest. Sing this as the 33, or 34. Psalmes. [1] As e're I downe am couched there, Where, now I hope to rest; I, first, from what I daily weare, Begin to be undrest. So, in my Grave, e're I shall be In blest reposure layd, Of many Rags, yet worne by me, I must be disarayd. 2 My fruitlesse Hopes, my foolish Feares, My Lust, my lofty Pride, My fleshly-Joyes, my needlesse-Cares, Must quite be laid aside. Yea that Selfe-Love, which yet I weare More neare me then my skin, Must off be pluck'd, e're I shall dare My last-long-sleep begin. 3 Of These, and all such Rags as these, When I am disarayd My Soule and Body shall have ease, Where ever I am layd: For Feares of Death, nor Cares of Life, Shall then disquiet me; Nor dreaming-Joyes, nor waking Griefe My Sleeps disturbance be. 4 Therefore, instruct thou me ô God! And give me grace, to heed With what vaine things, our selves we lode; And what we rather need. Oh! help me teare those Clouts away, And let them so be loth'd, That, I, on my last-rising-Day, With Glory may be cloth'd. 5 And, now, when I am naked layd, Vouchsafe me so to arme; That nothing make my heart afrayd, Or doe my Body harme. And guard me so when downe I lie, And when I rise againe; That (sleep, or wake, or live, or die) I, still, may safe remaine. Hymne XX. When we cannot sleep. When we cannot sleep at seasonable times, vaine muzings, and want of right meditating on God is frequently chiefe cause of unrest. Therefore this Meditation directeth to the remedy of such untimely watchfulnesse. Sing this as the former Hymne. [1] VVhat ayles my Heart, that in my brest It thus unquiet lies? And that it, now, of needfull Rest Deprives my tired eies? Let not vaine Hopes, griefs, doubts, or feares Distemper so my mind; But, cast on God, thy thoughtfull cares, And comfort thou shalt find. 2 In vaine that Soule attempteth ought, (And spends her thoughts in vaine) Who by, or in her selfe, hath sought Desired peace to gain. In vain, as rising in the morne, Before the Day appeare: In vain, to Bed we late returne, And lye unquiet, there: 3 For, when of Rest, our Sin deprives, When Cares do waking keep, Tis God (and he alone) that gives To his Beloved, sleep. On thee, ô Lord, on thee, therefore, My musings, now I place: Thy free remission, I implore, And thy refreshing grace. 4 Forgive thou me, that when my mind Opprest begun to be, I sought elsewhere, my peace to find, Before I came to thee. And, gracious God, vouchsafe to grant, (Vnworthy though I am) The needfull rest which now I want, That I may praise thy Name. Hymne XXI. A generall thanksgiving. Because the particular Benefits which we receive of God, are so many, that we cannot sing particular Hymns for every Mercy, this generall Thanksgiving is provided for those who need such helps. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] O Lord I faine would sing thy praise, But, know not where I should begin; So often, and so many waies, Thy Favours have conferred bin. No blessing needfull to be had, Are we, by thee debarred from Whereby we happy may be made, On earth; or, in the world to come. 2 I, for my Being, thanke thee first, And, that when I the same possest, I was no Creature of the worst; But, had Endowments of the best. And thy eternall-Providence, I praise, with all the pow'rs in mee, For ev'ry grace vouchsaf'd me since I first receiv'd my life from thee. 3 For ev'ry Sense, for all my Limbs; And, for each Gift, I praise returne, Which outwardly my body trims; Or, me doth inwardly adorne. I praise thee, for my Strength, my Health, My Shape; and also for that share Which I have had of worldly-Wealth, And, of some honest-Pleasures here. 4 I praise thee for my Friends and Foes; (For, both have usefull been to mee) Yea, for thy just-correcting blowes, I render hearty thanks to thee. I likewise magnifie ô God! Thy wisedome, for that goodly Frame, Which over us thou spread'st abroad; And, for this Globe on which I am. 5 For all things in this lower-World; For ev'ry Star, in ev'ry Sphere, Which round about this Orbe is whirld, I praise thee with a heart sincere. But, most of all, I praise thee, Lord, For pardoning what is done amisse; And, for the meanes thou dost afford To bring me to Eternall Blisse. 6 For chusing me, e're time was made; For thy Creating me, in Time; For my Redemption, when I had Well-being lost, by Adams crime. For me inlightning, by those Rayes, Whereby the Paths of Truth I see; For bringing me from Errors wayes; For these things, Lord, I honour thee. 7 I blesse thy Name, that by thy Grace I freely justified am; And, that, when I polluted was, I thereby sanctifide became. I praise thee too, that I abide Preserved in the State of Blisse; And, that, of being Glorifide, My wofull Soule, kept hopefull is. 8 Oh Lord, to sum up all, in One, (In One, which ev'ry Blisse containes) I give thee thanks for Christ thy Son, Who all these gracious Favours daignes. To Him, for whatsoever Hee Hath suffred, said, or done, be praise. And, to that Spirit, who to mee, The meanes of all this Grace convayes. Hymne XXII. When we ride for Pleasure. We make use of God's Creatures, aswell for pleasure, as for necessity. Therefore when we ride forth for pleasure, it will become us to mix, now and then such thankfull Meditations with our lawfull Pleasures, as are in this Hymne. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] My God, how kind? how good art thou? Of Man, how great is thy regard? Who do'st all needfull things allow, And, some for Pleasure, hast prepar'd? With what great Speed? with how much ease? On this thy Creature, am I borne, Which at my will, and when I please Doth forward goe, and backe returne? 2 Why should not I, ô gracious God! More plyant be to thy command, When I am guided by thy word, And gently reined by thy hand. Asham'd I may become to see The Beast (which knowes nor good, nor ill) More faithfull in obeying me, Then I have been, to do thy will. 3 From him therefore, Lord, let me learn To serve thee, better then I do; And minde how much it may concern My welfare to endeavour so. And, though I know, this Creature lent Aswell for Pleasure, as for need; That I the wrong thereof prevent, Let me, still, carefully take heed. 4 For, he that, wilfully shall dare That Creature, to oppresse or grieve, Which God to serve him doth prepare, Himselfe of mercy doth deprive. And He, or His (unlesse in time They doe repent of that abuse) Shall one day suffer for his Crime; And want such Creatures, for their use. Hymne XXIII. For him that undertakes a long-voyage. Many are the Casualties and Hazzards of long-voyages. Therefore, this Hymn puts Travellers in minde of some things pertinent to their safety; and remembers them, whose Protection they ought to seeke. Sing this as the 4. Psalme, &amp;c. [1] Hee that a Voyage undertakes, Had need be well prepar'd; And (when his Countrey he forsakes) Procure an able Gard: For, perils are so rife become, That (e're we be aware) They often ceaze on us at home, When we most watchfull are. 2 My Journey, therefore, in thy Name, I, now ô Lord, begin; That thou maist guide me through the same, And prosper me therein. Be thou my Pilot and my Guide, My Guard, my Staffe, my Stay; And, ev'ry thing for me provide, That's needfull in my way. 3 To Pilgrims, thou, in Ages past, Approv'dst thy selfe a Friend; And, to their Pilgrimages, hast Vouchsaf'd a blessed end. The Father of the Faithfull Race, His Son, and Grand-childe too, Removed oft from place to place, And, Thou didst with them goe. 4 The Patriarchs in Marchantwise, For Food, to Egypt went; Endev'ring their necessities, By Travell, to prevent. Thy blest Apostles (whom the Spheres, Did, therefore figure out) Were universall Travellers, To preach thy Truth about. 5 Yea, when thy blessed Son, ô God! Did in our flesh appeare, (And made amongst us his abode) His Travels, many were. To Egypt, he a voyage made, Ev'n in his tendrest age; And other painfull Journeyes had, To scape the Peoples rage. 6 Lord, make a voyage now with me; Conduct, and guide me, so, As Jsr'el guided was, by thee, In Ages long agoe. Like Iacobs Voyage, make thou mine, With me thine Angell send; And let thy face upon me shine, Vntill my Journies end. 7 Twixt me and ev'ry perill stand, That shall my life assaile Vpon the Water or the Land, And let them not prevaile. Protect from Poyson, Fire, and Sword, From theeves and beasts of prey: From unexpected Sicknesse, Lord, And Stormes upon the way. 8 From all extreames of Cold and Heat; From all Infectious Aires; From Wants or Torments overgreat; From Bondage, and Despaires: From their Despight that Goodnesse hate, And mischiefes doe intend: From Flattrers, and a Faithlesse-mate, Thy Servant, Lord, defend. 9 Preserve me sober, and Discreet, Just, humble, meek and kind; That, such as would ensnare my feet, No powre thereto may finde. Make cleane my heart, and keep my Tongue, That I nor think, nor say, What may be to anothers wrong; Or mine own life betray. 10 Throughout my Travels give me grace Discreetly to avoyd, The Sins, and Errors of the Place, wherein, I am employ'd. And, let me those things only learn, Which to thy praise may be, My Countrys good, someway, concern, Or truly profit me. 11 To these intents, thine Ayd afford; Thy daily blessing, daign, And, bring me in due time, ô Lord, In safetie back again. That, I may joyfull praises give Vnto thy holy Name; And others, (who thy love perceive) Assist me in the same. Hymne XXIIII. For safe return, from a Voyage. Men that are in want and danger (farre from their homes) have many longings for a safe return; But, being arived where they would be, a vain Jollitie, or negligence, puts (oftentimes) out of minde all remembrance of due thankfulnesse; which we desired to prevent by this Hymn. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] How great! how gracious have I found Thy Favours, Lord my God, to mee! How, for thy mercies, am I bound, With all my Powr's, to honour thee? For, that whereto my wish aspir'd, To me thou, timely, granted hast, (As fully as my heart desir'd) And, all my Fears are gone and past. 2 Me, thou hast hither, from a far, Through many Streights and perils brought; And, now, in presence, those things are, Whose Absence, overlong I thought. How often! hath my heart been sad, Whilst Hope did suffer by delay? And, ô! how faine would I have had A sight of what I view this day. 3 The Place desir'd, the Friends belov'd, And, many wished pleasures more, From which I lately was remov'd, Thy Mercie doth to me restore. Nor didst thou, only, thus preserve And blesse me, Lord, beyond desart; But, when disfavour I deserve, My kinde, and constant Friend thou art. 4 Permit not, ô permit thou not These overflowings of thy grace, To be abused or forgot, In any future Time, or Place. But, let me all my life time-long, My Will, my Wits, and Strength bestow As well in Action, as in Song, Thy Wisdome, Powre, and Love to show. 5 And, when those Travels have an end, Which for mine own advantage, here, (Or for thy service) I attend, Make my last Voyage without fear. Yea, when my Iourney I shall take Vnto my last, and longest-Home; A Joyfull Passage, let me make, And, blessed in thy Rest, become. Hymne XXV. When we are upon the Seas. Death is alwaies within a few ynches of those who continue on Ship-bord: yet, most men, in their Sea-passages, are vainly employed, &amp; insensible of their perils. This Hymn, therefore, offers their Condition, and Dutie, to consideration. Sing this as the 48. Psalme &amp;c. [1] On those Great Waters now I am Of which I have bin told, That whosoever thither came, Should Wonders there behold. In this unsteadie place of feare Be present Lord with mee, For, in these Depths of water here, I depths of Danger see. 2 A stirring-Courser now I sit; A headstrong-Steed I ride, That champs and fomes upon the Bit, Which curbs his loftie pride. The softest whistling of the winds, Doth make him gallop fast, And, as their breath increas'd he finds The more he maketh hast. 3 Take thou ô Lord, the Reines in hand; Assume our Masters roome: Vouchsafe thou at our Healme to stand; And Pilot to become. Trim thou the Sailes, and let good-speed Accompany our hast: Sound thou the Channells at our need, And anchor for us cast. 4 A fit and favourable wind To further us, provide; And, let it waite on us behind, Or lacky by our side. From Sudden Gusts, from Stormes, from Sands; And from the raging-wave, From Shallowes, Rockes, and Pirates hands, Men, Goods, and Vessell, save. 5 Preserve us from the wants, the feare, And Sicknesse of the Seas; But, chiefly from our Sins, which are A Danger worse then these. Lord, let us, also safe arive Where we desire to be; And, for thy Mercies, let us give Due thanks, and praise to thee. Hymne XXVI. In a Storme at Sea. Passionate expressions of Fear, intermixt with reasonable considerations do help mitigate our passions in great Extreames; and Lamentations are as properly exprest in Song, as mirth: Therefore this Hymne may profitably, be said or Sung, in a terrible Tempest to beget Courage, and strengthen our Faith. [1] Lord, how dreadfull is this howre? And how sad is ev'ry Eie? Clouds dissolve, the Skies do lowre, Waves are fierce, and windes are high: Wrath, above us frowning sits, Danger, hath enclos'd us round; Fear, of us, possession gets, And, beneath us, Death is found. Lord, awake! awake we pray; Chase this raging Storme away: Els, we perish all to Day. 2 Lord, we know that thou art nigh, Though, as yet, thou seem not near; And are sure thou hear'st our cry, Though asleep, thou dost appear. Let, ô let not any Crime, (Past or present) come in place, To condemn us, in a time, When, so much, we need thy grace: But, ô send us, now, thine ayde; Let not Mercy be delayd: For, thy Servants are afraid. 3 If our Vessell bear ô Lord! Wicked Fraught, or Crying Sin; Help to heave it over-boord, That, Salvation may come in. Bid the Seas, more calme become; Bid the Waves more lowly grow; Check the Winds, and call them home: That, the Deeps they stir not so. Hear, whilst call on thee we may: For, if Thou the Word but say, Winds and Waves will thee obay. 4 More this Tempest doth not rage, Then when Ionah shunn'd thy Face: But, that Storme thou didst asswage, When the Seamen sought thy grace. When in Dangers, like to these, Thy Disciples, grew afraid; Thou didst Then the Winds appease, And, the Tempest was alayd. They for help, invoked Thee. Lord! they Cryde; and so do we: Therefore, saved let us be. 5 Though our Lives, we value dear, And our Goods, too highly rate: Death is not our chiefest Fear, Nor the losse of our estate. More we fear to loose thy Love; More we fear thy wrathfull Frown: For, our Conscience doth reprove; And, to us, our Guilt hath shown. Sense, and Conscience, of our Sin, Is more terrible, within; Then the Storme, without, hath bin. 6 These internall Stormes controul: And, (how er'e our Bodies fare) Speak thou kindly to the Soul, Thy sweet Calmes, vouchsafing there. Then, the Tempest rais'd without, Shall, to us, no Danger bring: But, (repreev'd from Fear, and Doubt) We thy praise, ô Lord! will sing. Yea, though Winds and Waters roare, (Rend the Rocks, and tear the Shore) We will sing thy Praise the more. Hymne XXVII. When a Storme is past, at Sea. Fear compells most men, in times of Danger, to call upon God, whom they seldome remember before they are troubled; and when the perills are past, few return thanks for their Deliverances. Therefore, this Hymne offers it self, to remedy that Forgetfulnesse. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] See, see, the Skie from stormes is clear; More smoothly, now the Waves do flow: The Billows, that above us were, Contented seeme, to lie below. The furious Winds are much alayd; More sober, now, the Ship appears: And, we, who lately were afrayd, To Hopes, have changed all our Fears. 2 Our Vowes, our Prayers, and our Crie, With God, have good acceptance had. He saw our danger, from on hie And, speed to save us, he hath made. Come, let us therefore to his praise, (With joyfull hearts, and hands upheav'd) In thankfull Songs, our Voices raise; And sing of what we have receiv'd. 3 The Fears of Death, inclos'd us round; The Sins of Life, increast that Fear: No means of safetie could be found; Nor did in us, much hope appear. Above our heads, the waves did roul: The Winds did make our Tacklings crack. The Deeps had nigh o'rewhelm'd our Soul: Both Skill and Courage we did lack. 4 Some did the losse of Goods, deplore, (Of which depriv'd they thought to be) Some griev'd, through fear, lest they no more, Should their lov'd Friends, or Country see. Some seeming nigh Destructions brink, (And seeing Danger gape so wide) Opprest with fear, began to think, In how ill-state, they might have dide. 5 There was no Soul among us, here, But, feared more then did befall: For, God, in mercy, doth appeare; And shows compassion to us all. Therefore, let us (now Fear is past) Consider what small Joy or ease, Those things, whereon our hearts were plast, Afford, in dangers, like to these. 6 And, let us purchase, whilst we may, That Grace, whereby we may be fraught With Courage, in a Dreadfull-Day, To set the Worldlings Fears at naught. And, as we joyntly do partake The Mercy, which we now possesse; So, let us joynt-Confession make And thus to thee, our God, confesse. 7 O Lord! our safetie is of Thee. It was thy Powre and love, alone, By which we now secured be; And other Helper, we have none. To Thee, from whom we did receive This Grace (and thousands heretofore) Our Tongues, our Hands, and Hearts we give, To serve and praise thee evermore. Hymne XXVIII. When we come a Shore. It is a Mercy worth acknowledging, when God hath brought us to fixe our feet on firm land again; and that the Winds and Tides have been made serviceable unto us: Therefore, in this Hymn God is praised for that Benefit. Sing this as the former Hymn. [1] I thank thee Lord, I thee adore, With humbled heart, and bended knee, That, thus upon the Stable Shore My Feet in safetie fixed be. I praise thee, that the fickle Seas, For me a Pathway, have been made, Through which unharmed, and at ease, A Passage, hither, I have had. 2 I thank thee that thou didst provide, And serviceable make to mee, The motions both of Winde and Tide; Though I am slack in serving thee I praise thee, that, no Swall'wing-Sands, No Splitting-Rock, no Gulph, or Bar, No Storme, or Bloody Pyrats hands, To ruine me permitted were. 3 For This, and ev'ry other thing, Which by thy Favour I possesse, I thank thee Lord; Thy praise I sing; And thy abounding love confesse. O let thy Grace (which fixed hath My Feet in-safetie on the Land) Preserve me constant in thy Path And, ever true, to thy Command. Hymne XXIX. When we Journey by Boat or Barge. Some who Travell in Boats or Barges, are delighted to employ the time of their Passage in stirring up good Affections in themselves and other Passengers by Hymns, and Spirituall Songs; we have therefore prepared a proper Hymn for that Occasion. Sing this as the 4 Psalme. [1] How are ô God! we Sinners bound To give thee thanks and praise? Who to prevent our pains, hast found And shown us, many waies. By Horse and Coach we at our ease, Ore Hils and Dales may ride; Through Lakes, through Rivers, and through Seas, In Boates, and Ships, we glide. 2 The Waters which unruly are, To serve us, may be won; And forc'd our Burthens home to bear, Which way so e're they run. The Windes, to give our Courser breath, From ev'ry Quarter blow; And, we, within a foot of Death, In ease and safetie go. 3 Vpon the Water, now we passe, And, safe we hope to be, By thy Protection, and thy Grace, Because we trust in Thee. Continue with us, all the way: (Though we are full of Sin) Preserve us, and our Boat, we pray, With ev'ry thing therein. 4 Guide thou this Vessell, trim our Sails; In Danger hear our Cry: And, when our skill, or Courage fails, Those failings Lord, supply. No Passengers, Oresights, or Crime, Lord, (whether great or small) Within this Vessell, at this Time, To question, do thou call. 5 The Foolish Tales, the Lies, and Oathes, That passe among us, here; (And, which the well affected loathes) To mark, be not severe: Nor let the Civill-passenger, The more unsafely passe, Because this Boat, perhaps, doth bear Despisers of thy Grace. 6 And, when that Key or Port, we gain, Whereat we would arive; To Thee, (that safe we may remain) Due Praises let us give. And, while in progresse, thitherward, We are in motion, here, Let us, (if we expect Regard) Continue in thy Fear. Hymne XXX. When we are Walking in a Garden. The Garden is a Place of Delight; and we may take Many Occasions, whilst we are there walking, to meditate things pertinent to God's glorie, and our own Instruction, both to the prevention of Sin, (which may els be committed) and to the sanctifying of our honest pleasures, there: which is intimated by this Hymn. Sing this as the former Hymn. [1] To yeeld us profit with Delights, The Garden was ordain'd: To many Pleasures it invites, Not ev'ry-where obtain'd. And, if we be not well aware, How we converse therein, The Serpent, still, is lurking there, To tempt us unto Sin. 2 Within a Garden, he began His Engines first to lay. There, first he brought a Curse on man; There, he did Christ betray. And, in our Gardens, many times, (Whilst Pleasure we pursue) We are allured to those Crimes, Which afterward we rue. 3 Lord, therefore, sanctifie to me, The Pleasures of this Place; That they may raise my heart to thee, And, minde me of thy Grace. Whilst, here I seek Delights to take, Let me in thought retain, What in a Garden, for my sake, My Saviour did sustain. 4 His Agony, and Bloody-sweat, Shall, then, prevent my pain; His Grief, my Pleasure shall beget, And, ease for me obtain: Of those Requests I shall partake, By which he sought thy grace. And, thou shalt sweet, and harmlesse, make The Pleasures of this Place. Hymn XXXI. When we are walking in the Fields. The Fields are oft frequented both for Pleasure and Profit; and, many times, Idle musings make those things dangerous, which might, els, bring a double Advantage. This Hymn, therefore, offers these profitable Meditations, which become the leisure of that Place. Sing this as the former Hymn. [1] The Fields, for prayer, Isa'ck chose: And, they who trie, shall finde, That for Devotion, they dispose A well-devoted minde. The Blessings which we there espie, Occasions are of praise: The loftie Prospects of the Skie, Are helps our Hearts to raise. 2 When I ô God! behold this Frame, Which is above me plast; How richly thou dost deck the same, How ordred it thou hast: And therewith call to minde, for whom, This Work, by thee, was wrought; Amaz'd it makes me to become, And, thus it moves my thought. 3 Lord, can it be that thou should rear For such poore Wormes as we, A Structure, wherein do appear, Such Glories, as I see? And that there be, (as I have heard) Above that Spatious-Round, Things, far more excellent, prepar'd, Then, here by Sight are found. 4 If so it be, as (without doubt) I do beleeve it so; Why are my Thoughts employ'd about, My vain Designes below? Why do I Fear? why do I love, Or Covet, ought but Thee? And hazard things, in heav'n above, For those that earthly be? 5 O! from these Dung-hils, raise my minde, And, teach it so to mount, That I may best Contentments finde, In things of best Account. Yea, teach me so to raise my Thought, That I may, by Degrees, And, in due time, be thither brought, Where Faith my Place foresees. Hymn XXXII. Before, or at a Feast. Feasts are usefull to cheere our mindes, by a plentifull enjoying of the Creatures, in a neighbourly Societie, when Times, and good Occasions allow the same. And this Hymn offers to Remembrance some Cautions, to sanctifie, and keep harmes from such Refreshings. Sing this as the former Hymn. [1] What Plenties (ô thrice gracious Lord!) Before us, now, appear? How hast thou furnish'd out this Boord, For us, thy Servants here? Thy Fruits are pull'd, Thy Flocks are kill'd, Thy Foules displum'd we see: And by thy bountie, over-fill'd; Our Bowles and Dishes be. 2 Lord, let this meeting now be blest, And, what prepar'd thou hast. In ev'ry morsell of this Feast, Let us thy sweetnesse tast. Grant also, lest our health it marr, That we excesse may shun: And, let among us, neither Jarr, Nor Discord be begun. 3 Chase all prophane Discourse away; Let honest Mirth appear: Let none of us, an evill say, Of those that are not here. But, let each Word, and ev'ry Deed, That shall be said, or done, Be meant, true Mirth and love to breed; And grieve, or injure none. 4 Yea, let us all, so heed those ends, For which good Feasts are made; That, they may keep us loving Friends, And make us, wisely, glad. And, (being filled) let us cheer, The hungry, with supplies: So, shall this Feast, be (as it were) A holy Sacrifice. Hymn XXXIII. A Hymn after a Feast. We are here remembred to be thankfull for our Refreshments; to acknowledge God's Bountie in giving his Creatures as well for Delight as Necessitie; and to use his good blessings with Temperance. Sing this as the former Hymn. [1] VVhen is it fitter to begin The Song intended, now, Then when our Table spread hath bin And Cups did overflow? For, lo; those things which God prepar'd The hearts of men to chear; Have those effects on us declar'd For which, ordain'd they were. 2 Our Wants we now remember not; No Cares oppresse the minde: Our Sorrows, all are quite forgot, No Feares in us we finde. And, if we stay in this Degree Of good and sober mirth, We are ô God! allow'd by thee, These Blessings of the Earth. 3 As well for Pleasure, as for need, Thy Creatures are bestown; As, heretofore, by his own Deed, Thy blessed Son hath shown: For, at a Wedding, where each Guest, Of wine, had drunk, before; It pleas'd him, to inlarge the Feast; And, adde a great deal more. 4 The more thy Bounties we shall see, The more we should beware, That, neither they abused be; Nor we unthankfull are. And, therefore, lest our Appetites, Our Iudgements may confound; To that, in which our Flesh delights, We now impose a Bound. 5 For all Refreshments of this Day, We praise thy blessed Name; We honour it, in all we may, We Sanctifie the same: And, that we may depart in peace, Of thee we humbly crave That, what was done or said amisse, This Day, may pardon have. Hymn XXXIIII. A Hymn before Meat. God is praised for furnishing our Table: he is also pray'd that his good Creatures may be received of us to the enabling of us in performing our Christian duties; and that when we are full, we may be mindfull of the Poore. Sing this as the Magnificat. [1] For spreading Lord, our Table, thus, To thee we thankfull are: O! let it not be unto us, A mischiefe, or a Snare. But, these thy Creatures blesse thou so (Whereon we hope to feed) That we our Duties well may do And gain the Strength we need. 2 Let not thy Plenties make us dull, Or wantonly inclinde: And, Lord, when we ourselves are full, The emptie, let us minde. Preserve thy Church, protect our King, And, all his Kingdomes blesse: That, at our Tables, we may sing, And, eat our Bread in Peace. Hymn XXXV. A Hymn after Meat. God-Almightie having fed our Bodies; is here besought to feed our Soules also; and desired that whether we Feed or Fast, he may be glorified thereby. Sing this as the former Hymn. [1] We praise ô God! we honour Thee, By whom we now are fed! And, we acknowledge, that from Thee, We have our Daily-bread. As with externall Food, ô Lord! Thou fedd'st our Bodies, now; Ev'n so, thy Blest Incarnate-word, Vpon our Souls bestow. 2 And, whilst the Flesh her nourishment, From thy good Creatures takes; Let not, into our Souls, be sent, What, there, a leannesse makes. But, whether want, or thrive we shall, Or Fast, or take our Food; Vnto thy praise, convert it all: And all things to our Good. 3 With Health and Plentie, blesse this Place; From Error keep us free: And, let thy Gospel, and thy Grace Our Portion alwayes be. Preserve thy Church; protect our King; And all his Kingdomes blesse: That, we may at our Table sing, And eat our Bread in Peace. Hymn XXXVI. When we walke to the Church. Such as dwell in the Countrey, a good distance from the Church, may shorten the way, by singing, otherwhile, this Hymn, to praise God for the free libertie of coming to his House; and to prepare their mindes for the Place and Service, toward which they walk. Sing this as the 117. Psalme. [1] How blest are we! who may repaire In peace, and safetie Lord, Vnto thy blessed House of Prayre, And hear thy holy Word? Such Times, thy Saints have lived in, That, thus they could not do; Vnlesse, it had with hazard bin; Of Goods, and Freedome too. 2 Continue, still, through these our Dayes, The Grace which, now, thou show'st; And make us mindfull, thee to praise, For that, which thou bestow'st. Thy Voice so let us hear to Day, And so meek hearted be That thou mayst hear us, when we pray, And, give us Rest in thee. 3 When we into thy House do come, Lord, minde us, evermore, To leave our Worldly Thoughts, at home, And, send our hearts before. Vnto our Footing, let us all Take heed, when we come there, And; on the Pavement, humbly fall Before thy Face, with Fear. 4 Our Sins, there, let us open lay, And, there, our State condole; Till thou shalt pleased be to say, Your Faith hath made you whole. In Peace, then send us back again, And, give us powre to see, That, in thy presence we remain, Where ere our Bodies be. Hymn XXXVII. When we walk from Church. We are hereby put in Remembrance that we endeavour to become profitable Hearers, by practising in our lives that which we are taught; and to beseech God, to enable us thereto. Sing this as the former Hymn, or as the 4 Ps. [1] Lord, let the Words we heard this day The Heart so deeply peirce; That, in our lives we practise may Their meanings to reherse Let not thy holy Seed, be found Dispers'd abroad in vain; By falling on a Stony-ground, That yeelds no lasting-gain. 2 Permit thou not those Aiery-hopes, Which Ill-suggestions breeds, To rob us of celestiall crops, By rav'ning up the seeds: Nor, let the Thornes of Worldly Cares So choke them up, we pray, That, they produce unfruitfull eares, Or wither, quite away. 3 But, teach us to receive thy Word, Like such a fruitfull mold, As to the Sower doth afford, Sometime, a hundred fold. And, let us none of those become, Who formall Hearers are; But seldome practise that, at home, Which in the Church they hear. Hymn XXXVIII. When kindred meet together. The love of kindred is grown cold; and many unkindnesses and neglects are among them. Therefore, when they visite each other, this Hymn being sung, may remember them, to cherish that Amity which ought to be between them. Sing this as the 133. Psalme. [1] How happy is it, and how sweet, When Kindred kind appeare! And, when in Vnity we meet, As we obliged are? Each Blessing, which on One doth fall, Will multiplied be; And prove a Blessing to us All, As long as we agree. 2 As from high Hils, a show'r of Raine Along the vallies trils; And, as they vapour up againe A moystning for those Hils: So, Kindred (whether poore or rich) If truly kind they prove; Each other may advantage much, By interchange of Love. 3 The slendrest Threds together wound, Will make the strongest Band; And, smallest Rods, if closely bound, The Benders force withstand. But, if we those asunder take, Their strength departs away; And, what a Gyant could not breake; A little Infant may. 4 So, if in Concord, we abide, (If true in heart we prove) We may the more be fortifide, By interchange of Love. Let us, therefore, who now have met, Observe this Lesson, so, That we do not the same forget, When we apart shall go. 5 Let none of us delight to tell, Or pleasure take to heare, Wherein his kinsman doth not well; Or, faulty may appeare: But, let each of us, our owne Crimes, With others Errors weigh; And, seek the fittest means, and Times, To mend them what we may. 6 If Malice injure any One, To whom allide we are, Let us repute the wrong as done To ev'ry Person here. Yea, if a Grief, a Losse, a shame, To one of us befall: Let us be tender of the same, As grievous to us all. 7 So, we that are, but linked, yet, In Bands of common kind; Shall, at the last, be nearer knit, By Vertues of the Mind. And, when the Ties of carnall-kin, By death, shall be undone; We, that have so allied bin, Shall be, for ever, One. Hymn XXXIX. When Kindred depart from each other. Kindred having visited each other, and being to returne to their severall habitations, doe in this Hymn praise God for their Meeting; and pray him to blesse them in their separation. Sing this as the former Hymn. [1] To bid each other now adue Time, warnes us to prepare; And, that those Callings we pursue To which oblig'd we are. To thee therefore, by whom we came Each others weal to know: We render praise: And in thy Name, Asunder Lord, we go. 2 Though us, ô Lord! to live apart, Our Fortunes do compell; Keep us united, still, in hart, Where ever we shall dwell. A Dweller, in our Dwellings be: Vs, there, depart not from. And let us meet againe, in Thee; When we together come. 3 Alliances are seldome good; And, rarely kind they are, Who nothing have, but Flesh and Blood, To make, and keep them Deare. Therefore, let us endeavour so, That we, by Grace, may be More nearly knit, and thereby grow, Vnited all to thee. 4 Preserve among us honest Mirth: At least, when we shall mourne, Make Sorrow midwife to the Birth, At which, true Joyes are borne. And, of our Meetings, here below, If this the last shall prove; Our Conversation, forme Thou so, That we may meet above. Hymne XL. A Hymn at Seed-time. Husbandmen when sowing-time is ended, have (in some places) their seed-Cake, or some other extraordinary Allowance to refresh them in their Labours, and it would not be without profit if they sanctified those Refreshings with this or the like Meditation. Sing this as the 4 Psalme, &amp;c. [1] No Time, to trifle forth, in wast, For us, allow'd hath bin; But, alwaies, when one work is past, Another doth begin. Each day, a daily labour brings, For us to work upon: And ev'ry yeare, hath many things, That must be yearly done. 2 Assoon as Harvest in is borne, The Seed-time doth insue; And, they, in order, still, returne, Our Labour to renewe. That, which the Season doth befit, We, now (in hope) have sown: And Lord! we unto thee commit, What we abroad have thrown. 3 When Isa'ck tilled in that place, Where, he a Stranger liv'd; A hundred-fold, the profit was Which he from thee receiv'd. Then, since it is as easie, Lord, As pleasing let it be, A Benediction to afford Vpon my Pains and me. 4 To us, a Pow'r thou dost allow To water and to plant; But, thou a Blessing must bestow, Or, we our Hope shall want. Vnto our Labour, therefore adde The Supplement, it needs; Lest (missing that) the Soile be made A Stepdame, to our Seeds. 5 Command the Earth to wrap them close; Let Moisture, Warmth and Aire, Their vertues into them dispose; That, nothing them impaire. And, when they forth to sight are sprung, Them, likewise blesse thou so, That no disasters do them wrong; Till they to ripenesse grow. 6 Then grant that me (or they to whom Our portion shall descend) May fetch their Crops, with gladnesse, home; And, them with comfort spend. Grant, also, that the seeds of Grace, (Sown in our hearts, by Thee) Prove not lesse fruitfull in their place, Then Earthly Fruits may be. Hymn XLI. When Harvest is come home. When we have housed the fruits of the Earth, It becometh us (in stead of the rude jollities used in some places) to praise God's mercy for vouchsafing to us the fruit of our Labours, to pray for continuance of his blessing both on them; and on us, in the use of them; Jn which duties this Hymn assisteth. Sing this as the former. [1] Some, have a Custome, when they bring The last of Harvest home, To make the fields with Ecchoes ring, And, joyfull to become. Which was at first (though chang'd we have, This Joy, to brutish mirth) A Triumph to his praise, that gave The Blessings of the Earth. 2 In stead of brutish Clamors, then, That Custome we renew; And (as becometh Christian men) Our selves would thankfull shew. For, that which we, in hope have sown; And, till'd with costly pain, We, by Gods grace, have Reap'd and Mown; With likelihood of gain. 3 The dangers of cold Winters blast, Of Springs offensive hours, And, of that Summers drougth is past, Which Corn and grasse devours. The Fruits, for which we delv'd and plough'd, And, toyled long, with care; In Barnes and Stacks, are hous'd and mow'd; Of which right glad we are. 4 When Winds, &amp; Frosts, &amp; Rains, &amp; Snows, Make barren Grove and Field; When naught on hill, or valley grows, Which, food for man, doth yeeld: We, to relieve our wants, have hope, By thy free Bounty, Lord; And, means to raise a future Crop, By that we up have stor'd. 5 As, when thy Manna downe did fall, So be it also now: Let them, whose gath'rings are but small, Confesse they have enow: Blesse thou our Basket, and our Store; And, when refresh't we be; Let us distribute to the poore, The portion due to thee. 6 But, let us chiefly mind their need, Whose Labours were employ'd, To Till, what them and us must feed; And what is now injoy'd. And, let it more our hearts affect, That we are in thy grace; Then, great Abundance to collect, By Corne, or Wine's increase. Hymne XLII. For a Sheep-shearing. Sheep-shearing, is a Time of rurall Merriment, in which good-cheare is afforded to neighbors and servants; among whose Refreshings, if this or the like Meditation were sometime sung; both Knowledge and Piety, might be increased thereby. Sing this as the 23. Psalme. [1] Vnworthy, though, ô Lord, we are, Of that which thou dost give: Yet, we much more unworthy were, Of what we do receive; If any Blessing we let slip, For which, we do not pay, Such cheap Oblations of the Lip, As we present this day. 2 We, through thy favour now have had The Fleeces of our Sheep; And, they are almost naked made, Our Bodies warme to keep. Before their shearers, dumb they lay, Whil'st from their backs were shorne, Their finest Wooll; and we now may Possesse what they have worne. 3 Deare Lambe of God to thee be praise, Who dost refreshings give, So freely, and so many waies, Thy Servants to relieve. O! let our thankfulnesse appeare, Not in bare Words alone; But, in those Works, which reall are And, needfull to be done: 4 When any of thy Members lacks A Coat his flesh to gard; Let us bestow, ev'n from our backs, As much as may be spar'd. And, as our Sheep do skip, as glad, When they their Fleeces give; So, let us joy that means we had Our Brethren to relieve. 5 Vs, let their Meeknesse mindfull make, (By thinking thereupon) How meekly, thou didst all things take, Which, were to Thee, misdone. That, all we suffer, say, or do, May grow, in some Degree, Reform'd, by thine Example, so, That Blamelesse we may be. Hymn XLIII. A Hymn for a House-warming. The ancient and laudable use of House-warmings is here insinuated: For, in this Hymn, the Friends assembled, are taught to beseech God Almighty to make that habitation prosperous and comfortable to them, and theirs who are newly come thither to dwell. [1] Among those points of neighbourhood, Which our Forefathers did allow; That Custome in esteeme hath stood, Which we do put in practise now. For, when their Friends new-dwellings had, Them, thus they welcome thither made: That, they the sooner might be free, From Strangenesse, where they Strangers be. 2 To this good End, we partly came; And, partly, Friendship to augment. But, if we faile not in the same, This is the prime of our intent: We come, with holy Charmes, to blesse The House, our Friends, do now possesse. In Hope, that God, Amen will say, To that, for which we now shall pray. 2 Lord, keep this place, we thee desire, To these new-Commers ever free From raging Winds; from harmfull Fire; From Waters that offensive be. From gracelesse-Childe, from Servants-ill; From Neighbours, bearing no good-will; And, from the chiefest Plagues of Life, A Husband-false, a faithlesse-Wife. 3 Let neither Theeves, that Rove by Night, Nor those, that sneake about by Day, Have pow'r their persons to affright; Or to purloine their Goods away. Let nothing here, be seen or heard, To make by Day or Night afeard: No sudden Cryes, no fearfull Noise; No Vision grim, or dreadfull Voice. 5 Let on this House, no Curse remain, If any on the same be laid. Let no Imposture pow'r obtain To make the meanest wit afraid. Let here nor Zim, nor Jim be seen; The fabled Fai'rie King or Queen; Nor such Delusions, as are said, To make the former Age afraid. 6 Keep, also, Lord, we pray, from hence, (As much as frailty will allow) The Guiltinesse of each Offence, Which to a Crying-Sin may grow. Let, no more Want, Wealth, Hope, or Feare, Nor greater Griefs or Joyes be here, Then, may still keep them in thy grace, Who, shall be dwellers, in this place. 7 But, that just measure let them have Of ev'ry means, which may acquire The Blessednesse, which they most crave, Who to the truest Blisse aspire. And if Well-wishers absent be, Who better wish them can, then we, To make this Blessing up intire, We thereto adde what they desire. Hymne XLIIII. For a Contract. This Hymn is tendred to those who purpose a Contract of Marriage; in hope it may so remember them, to consider what they intend; that it shall keep them from proceeding farther then they lawfull may; and from professing more then they mean. Sing this as Te Deum. [1] Lord, in thy Name, and in thy Feare, Our Faith we plighted have; And, that our meanings are sincere, Thy witnesse, now, we crave. We come not, only to repeat Our Vowes, before thy face; But, that we may likewise intreat Thy Favour, and thy Grace. 2 For, mutuall helpers whil'st we live, (According to our might) Our selves, we to each other give, So far, as we have right. And, we professe that free we are, (For ought that we do know) To be each others wedded Peer, If thou permit it so. 3 We see no contradicting Cause, But, that we may be join'd, Without infringment of the Laws, Whereby we are confin'd. Nor any such Infirmity In us do we suspect, As that our Marriage-Band, thereby, Shall prove of no effect. 4 We have no guilefull Dealings us'd, Our purpose to acquire: Nor one anothers Trust abus'd, To gaine what we desire. But, our Affections are sincere, And, as they have been true, Vpright those Courses likewise are, By which, we them pursue. 5 If both have, now, ô Lord! profest What may not be denide; Let our Affection so be blest, That, nothing us divide. Let nor by Beauty, Wit or Wealth, By high, or low Degree, By want of Riches, or of Health, Our Hearts estranged be. 6 But if that either of us, now, Hath trod a faithlesse Way; Or, shall infringe this holy Vow, Before our Wedding day; Lord, let the party Innocent, From blame and guilt be free: For, Truth a Contract, never ment, Where, nought but Falshoods be. Hymn XLV. For a Marriage. God is hereby besought to blesse the Marriage solemnized to all there present; and so to prosper the Bridegroome, and Bride, in their Desires and Affections, that the Waters of their Carnall Contentment, may be turned into the Wine of spirituall Delighis. Sing this as the former Hymn. [1] To grace (ô Lord) a marriage Feast, (In Cana, long ago) It pleased thee to be a Guest, And there, thy pow'r to show. For, by a Miracle divine, (When they their Wine had spent) Thou changedst Water into Wine, Which did their want prevent. 2 Lord, let the brightnesse of thy Face Among us now appeare: So let the Bounties of thy Grace, Be manifested here; That neither Bridegroome, Bride, nor Guest, In body, or in mind, Of lesse content may be possest, Then they have hope to find. 3 All Joyes which in a married-life, Well-matched Couples know. On this new-wedded Man and Wife, Vouchsafe thou to bestow. Fulfill their Hopes, prevent their Feares, Grant them their just Desires: Increase that Love, which keeps off Cares, And warmes with lawfull Fires. 4 To Wine, those hartlesse Waters turn, Which in their Vessels be; To give them Comfort when they mourn; And make them glad in thee. And though the pleasures of their Love, Have yet a pleasing tast; Yet, let them daily sweeter prove, And best of all, at last. Hymn XLVI. When a Woman hath conceived. We are all conceived in sinne: yet some have been sanctified in the wombe. Therefore, we cannot begin too early, to pray for the sanctification of the fruit of our Bodies; and that it may be borne to Gods glory, to our comfort, and to a happy being in it selfe: which is desired in this Hymn. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] Lord, if the Signes may trusted be, That Symptomes of Conception are; A living-Soul deriv'd from thee, Within my wombe, I now do bear. Therefore (by her example, taught Who was the Mother of thy Son It well beseeming me I thought, To magnifie what thou hast done. 2 If so it be, as I beleeve; Lord, sanctify, I humbly pray, That, which in Sin I did conceive: And, grant that grace obtain it may. Let not the Part which thou hast made, Subjected to pollution grow, By what it from the Parents had: But let it keep the flesh below. 3 In ev'ry Sense, in ev'ry Part, Perfection to this Creature give; And, sow those graces in the heart, By which the Soul doth truly live. Whil'st I shall bear it in my wombe, Let me likewise, my part fulfill: And, when it forth to light shall come, Instruct it how to do thy Will. 4 O! let me not a Mother be, To fructifie for Hell and Sin; But, let my Fruit be born to Thee, In whom Well-beings do begin. So, whether it shall be design'd Short time, or long, on Earth to stay; A happy portion it shall finde, And give thee all the praise, it may. Hymn XLVII. When a Woman is safe delivered. God is hereby praised for that Miracle in our Nature, which is wrought when a Woman is delivered safely of her Childe; and the Continuance of his Mercy is desired in vouchsafing the Newbirth of Grace, to perfect and felicitate the life of Nature. Sing this as the former Hymn. [1] Among those wonders here on Earth, Which brought to passe, by Nature be, (If rightly, we observe our Birth) In this, her greatest marvels be. Yea, they who fully can conceive, What passe into this World we have, May find it easie to beleeve The Bodies, rising from the Grave. 2 A breathlesse Life, a Living-Tombe, Within our Mothers wombe we had. Through Gates of Death, to Life we come, And, Strength, is out of Weaknesse made. She who in bitter Pangs remains, Disheartned is when they do cease; And they who most bewayle her pains, Desirous are they should increase. 3 Of this thy great Mysterious worke, Experienced, this Day, are we: And, will confesse, that therein lurke More secrets, then our eies can see. But this, ô Lord! we see and know: It was thy Mercy, and thy Pow'r, Which did the timely Ayd bestow, That holp us, in the hoped hou'r. 4 To thee be praise, that now are past The pangs which made us lately sad: To thee be praise, that sent thou hast, These Comforts, which now make us glad. Lord, perfect thou the Grace begun. Give Strength, where Weaknesse yet is found: And, let the Race this Babe shall run, With Everlasting Life, be crown'd. 5 The Life of Nature he hath had: But, let it be new-borne again; The Life of Grace, to Nature adde, And, make him, in that state remain. So (whether, here, an Age he stay, Or, whether Thou translate him, from This Life, within a shorter day) In Christ, he perfect shall become. Hymn XLVIII. When a Childe is baptized. God, is here praised for the great Priviledges vouchsafed by Baptisme: He is prayed also, to enable the Childe Baptized to Do and Beleeve, according to the Conditions of the Covenant made; And he is likewise acknowledged the Author and Finisher of every Holy-Desire, and laudable Performance. [1] Dear God! how great, how large a Grace, Vnto that Soul, this Day, is done, Who, in thy Church, admitted was, To be a Member of thy Son? For, he which was the Childe of wrath, And borne to nothing, but Despaire; The Comforts of thy Favour hath, And of thy Kingdome, is an Heire. 2 Of that great City, where no Sum, A Freedome for him, could have bought, To be admitted, he is come; And, by meer favour thereto brought. Of Christ's most holy Order, now, The faire, and famous Badge he beares; Which will right happy make him grow, If to the Grave, the same he weares. 3 Lord, blessed be thy holy-Name, That thou this Mercy hast bestown: We praise, and love thee for the same, As if the good were all our own. In this estate, preserve him fast, Vntill he fully understands The Covenant, betwixt you past, Thy Promises, and thy Commands. 4 Then, also, leave him not, ô Lord! But grant him thy Assisting-might Thy loving-presence, and thy Word, With ev'ry means to keep him right. To make his Happinesse intire, Be pleased to vouchsafe him too, A Renovation in Desire; And, chearfulnesse thy will, to do. Hymn XLIX. When publike Thanks hath been given for safe deliverance in Child-birth. Though Thanksgivings are publikely exhibited for such Deliverances; yet, the same ought to be privately acknowledged also: and, perhaps, there may be some private Deliverances accompanying the former, which ought to be considered, as this Hymn implyes. Sing this as the 101 Psalme. [1] Although, my God! that Sacrifice, I tendred have to Thee, Which to be made in publike wise, This Church enjoins to me. Yet, if in secret, I forget My private Thanks to Day, A Duty (doubtlesse) I omit, Which I am bound to pay. 2 Besides, the Mercies lately shown, (And which confest have been) Thou, Favours hast on me bestown, Which others have not seen. From Sins within my heart conceiv'd, May greater mischiefs come, Then can be, otherwise, deriv'd, From any Childing-wombe. 3 Lord, therefore, by my Selfe alone, To thee I now repaire, Thy holy-Name, to call upon, In Praises, and in Pray'r. I praise thee, that escap'd I have The Danger, lately past; And, that my Body from the Grave, Thou, yet, preserved hast. 4 I praise thee, that my Tongue I find Now sounding of thy praise: And pray thee, that my heart may mind This Duty, all my Daies. I pray thee too, that from all Sin, I may be purifide; A stricter Course of Life begin; And, in thy Fear abide. Hymn L. A Rocking Hymn. Nurses usually sing their Children asleep; and through want of pertinent matter, they oft make use of unprofitable (if not worse) Songs. This was therefore prepared, that it might help acquaint them, and their Nurse-Children, with the loving Care and Kindnesse of their heavenly Father. [1] Sweet Baby sleep: what ailes my Dear? What ailes my Darling thus to cry? Be still, my Childe, and lend thine ear, To heare me sing thy Lullaby. My pretty Lambe forbear to weep: Be still my Dear; sweet Babie sleep. 2 Thou blessed Soul, what canst thou fear? What thing, to thee, can mischief do? Thy God, is now thy Father dear; His holy Spouse, thy Mother too. Sweet Babie then, forbear to weep; Be still my Babe; sweet Babie sleep. 3 Though thy Conception was in Sin, A sacred Bathing thou hast had. And, though thy Birth, unclean hath bin, A blamelesse Babe, thou now art made. Sweet Babie then, forbear to weep; Be still my Dear; sweet Babie sleep. 4 Whil'st thus, thy Lullabie, I sing, For thee, great Blessings ripening be: Thine Eldest Brother is a King; And hath a Kingdome bought for thee. Sweet Babie then, forbear to weep; Be still my Babe; sweet Babie sleep. 5 Sweet Babie sleep; and nothing fear; For, whosoever thee offends, By thy Protector threatned are, And God, and Angels are thy Friends. Sweet Babie then, forbear to weep; Be still my Babe; sweet Babie sleep. 6 When God-with-us, was dwelling here, In little Babes, he took delight. Such Jnnocents, as Thou, my Dear! Are ever precious in his sight. Sweet Babie, then forbeare to weep; Be still my Babe, sweet Babie sleep. 7 A little Infant, once was Hee: And Strength, in Weaknesse, then was laid Vpon his Virgin-Mothers knee; That, Pow'r to thee, might be convai'd. Sweet Babie, then, forbeare to weep; Be still my Babe; sweet Babie sleep. 8 In this thy frailty, and thy need, He friends and helpers doth prepare, Which thee shall cherish, clothe, and feed: For, of thy weal, they tender are. Sweet Babie, then, forbeare to weep: Be still my Babe; sweet Babie sleep. 9 The King of Kings when he was born, Had not so much for outward ease: By Him, such Dressings were not worn; Nor such like swadling-clothes as these. Sweet Babie, then, forbeare to weep; Be still my Babe; sweet Babie sleep. 10 Within a Manger lodg'd thy Lord, Where Oxen lay, and Asses fed. Warm rooms we do to thee afford, An easie Cradle, or a Bed. Sweet Babie, then forbeare to weep; Be still my Babe; sweet Babie sleep. 11 The wants that he did then sustain, Have purchas'd Wealth, my Babe, for thee: And, by his Torments, and his pain, Thy Rest and Ease, secured be. My Babie, then, forbeare to weep; Be still my Babe; sweet Babie sleep. 12 Thou hast (yet more) to perfect this, A promise and an earnest got, Of gaining everlasting Blisse, Though thou my Babe perceiv'st it not. Sweet Babie, then, forbeare to weep; Be still my Babe; sweet Babie sleep. Hymn LI. Another Rocking Hymn. The Nurse is here taught a forme of Blessing, whereby (she may by faithfully singing, or saying the same) call downe Gods Benediction, both upon her selfe, and her Infant, to the prevention of temporall and spirituall mischiefs. Sing this as Te Deum, or the 1 Psalme. [1] Since now, my Babe, of sleep possest, His lovely eies hath clos'd; To praise the Author of his rest, My heart is well-dispos'd: And, to implore, that God, who makes My Darling, thus to sleep; Would present be, when he awakes, And, him in sleeping keep. 2 Thou, praises from an Infants tongue, Disdainest not to hear: Reject not then, my Blessing-Song; But, Lord, decline thine ear. For, though a single voice I raise, My Offrings, triple be. My Self, my Babie, and my praise, I offer up to Thee. 3 Dear Son of God! who thoughtst no scorn, (To leave thy Throne on high) Of lowly parents to be born, And, in a Crib to lie: On this my Babe, thy Grace reflect; Infold him in thine Armes. From outward perils, him protect, And from internall Harmes. 4 Let not that Feind which ev'ry howre, Doth watch and hover here, To mischiefe us, obtain the Powre; Or cause my Childe to fear. But, let an Angell-guard be nigh, To put that Foe to flight: And, round about his cradle flye, To keep him from despight. 5 As Time, his Body shall increase, Increase his knowledge too; And cause him, ev'ry day in grace With God, and Man, to grow. Preserve him streight in ev'ry Limbe, And sound in ev'ry Sense: Yea, all his life time, keep thou him, From ev'ry grosse offence. 6 To thee, let him be alwayes true, And, ever kinde to those, Who kindnesses to him do shew Er'e Good, or Ill, he knows. And, let not, (for thy passion sake) This Babie (now, so dear) Those vaine, or evill Courses take, Whose end, we justly fear. 7 Oh let not him, whose meanest pain, We can with tears deplore, Be one of those, who shall remain In torments, evermore. But, so to live, and so to die, Vouchsafe him grace, ô God! That, he may rise to live on high, Where thou hast thine abode. Hymn LII. When we receive the Lords Supper. God, is hereby magnified for the great honour, and favour vouchsafed, by the blessed Sacrament of his Body and Blood; and humbly desired thereby to conferre and continue to us his especiall Grace. Sing this as the 148. Psalme. [1] Ovr Voice how should we raise! How should our Songs excell! If God-Almighties praise Our Tongues could fully tell? Sure, whilst we sing, The Starry-Round, of that glad sound, Would loudly ring. 2 That, at thy princely Boord, This Day we feasted be, How great a favour, Lord? Have we obtain'd from thee? And who is able Himself to make fit to partake Of this thy Table? 3 We, whom thy Bountie Feasts, (And, who now sing thy praise) Were called to be Guests, From hedges and high-wayes: And, till we came To taste this chear, we wretched were, Poore, blind, and Lame. 4 But, from our low estates, Now, so advanc'd are we, That, Princes are our Mates, And, Kings our Fellows be, One Cup we have, And, Angels eat no better meat, Then we receive. 5 Perfection of Delights, Is by this Feast bestown. With Him, that us invites The Food, and Guests are One! Faith works it thus, That, thereby, we are found in Thee; And thou in us. 6 And, though our Natures are Vnequall and Distinct; By true beleeving, here, They really are linkt. And, while we bide In Faith, and Love, nought can remove, Or, us divide. 7 Yea, such our Vnion is That, all our Sins are thine; And, ours, thy Righteousnesse Is made by grace divine. Yet, from all staines (Through our Offence) thine Excellence Still, free remaines. 8 Lord, for this love to Man, Pow'r, glory, praise, and Fame, (As fully, as we can) Ascribe we to thy Name. And, we emplore, That, this rich Grace, we may embrace For evermore. Hymn LIII. Another Hymn for the Lords Supper. Gods unspeakable Favour vouchsafed in the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, is acknowledged: The unexpressiblenesse of that Mysterious Communion is Confessed; and those blessed effects are hereby desired also which ought to be endeavoured for, by every worthy partaker of the same. Sing this as the Magnificat, or Te Deum. [1] The Favour Lord, which by thy grace, We have this day possest, Doth our best merits, far surpasse; And, cannot be exprest. Because, we not alone obtain A common-grace from thee; But, thou thy Self dost, also, daign Our food of Life, to be. 2 For which, we nothing have to give, Whereof, thou dost approve So much, as when we do receive Thy kindnesses with love. Therefore, ô Lord! we, now do make This Offring for the same: The Cup of Saving health we take; And, Magnifie thy Name. 3 O! teach us to receive aright, What thou dost here, bestow. And, give us an Informing-light Of what we ought to know. And, when we cannot wade the Deep Of thy unfathom'd Word; Let us a Course, with safetie keep, Along the shallow Foord. 4 This Mysterie we must confesse, Our Compasse to exceed; Our little Faith, is also lesse Then grains of Mustard-seed Therefore, ô Lord! improve it so, That, growth it may receive: And, that we modestly may know; And knowingly Beleeve. 5 Forgive to us our many crimes, Offensive unto thee. Vouchsafe we may in future times More just, more pious be. Vs, render gracious in thy Sight; And, that, which now we do; That, thou maist therein take Delight, And, we have love thereto. 6 No new Oblation, we devise For Sin, preferr'd to be. Propitiatorie-Sacrifice Was made, at full, by thee. The Sacrifice of Thanks, is that (And all) which thou dost crave: And, we our selves, are part, of what We Sacrificed have. 7 In this, no grosse Realities, We carnally conceive; Or, that their proper Qualities, The Bread, or Wine do leave. But, in this holy Eucharist, (By Faith and Grace Divine) We know, we feed on thee, ô Christ! Receiving Bread and Wine. 8 Thy Reall-presence, we avow: But, so; that, we confesse Meere carnall-Reason knows not how That Presence to expresse: Because, thy Flesh we feed on, thus; (Though strange it may appear) That, we in Thee; and thou in Vs; At once, and truly, are. 9 No marvell few can well agree, How this, they should unfold: For, Mysteries, Faiths objects be; Not things at Pleasure told. And, he that would, by Reason, sound The Depths, which Faith perceives, May both himself, and those, confound; To whom, his Rules he Gives. 10 Let us, therefore, our Faith erect, On what thy Word doth say; And, hold their knowledge in suspect, Who new Foundations lay. For, thereby some a cursed Rent Within thy Church have left; And, by thy Peacefull Sacrament, The world of peace bereft, 11 Yea that, which thou to cherish Love, Didst graciously ordain; Contention wrests, debates to move; And Quarrels to maintain. Oh! let us not hereafter so, About meere words contend; The while our craftie Common Foe, Procures his cursed end. 12 But, if in Essence, we agree, Let us, in Love assay To erring Souls, true Guids to be, And to the weake, a Stay. For, Love is that strong Cyment, Lord, Which us must reunite. In bitter Speeches, Fire, and Sword; It never takes delight. 13 Meere carnall Instruments, these are; And, they are much beguild; Who dreame that these ordained were, Our Breaches to rebuild. Therefore, we pray thee, by that love Which us together brought, That thou all Christian-men wouldst move To love, as Christians ought. 14 Let not Self-will our hearts bewitch With pride, or private hate; Or cherish those Contentions, which Disturbe a quiet State. Nor suffer Avaritious ends, Or ignorant despight, To hinder those from being Friends, Whom Love should fast unite. 15 Let those, who (heedlesse of thy word) Suppose, that Fleshly-powre, Or, that the temporary Sword, Can ghostly Foes devoure: Let them perceive, thy weapons are, No such as they do fain; Or, that it is a carnall warre, Which must thy Truth maintain. 16 Confessors, Martyrs, Preachers, Lord, Thy Battailes fight for thee. Thy Holy-Spirit, and thy Word, Their proper weapons be. Faith, Hope, Long-suffering, Praire, and Love, For Bulworks are prepar'd; And, will their fittest Engines prove, To Conquer, and to Guard. 17 For, Babel, doubtlesse, may as well Thereby, be overthrown, As those accursed walls, which fell When Rams-horne-Trumps were blown. This, if we credit; we shall cease The worldlings parts to play, Or, to beleeve Gods blessed peace, Shall come the Devils way. 18 Lord, let thy Flesh and Blood divine (Which now receiv'd hath bin) Our hearts, to Charitie incline: Our Souls refine from Sin. And by this holy Sacrament Make us in minde retain, What thou didst suffer, to prevent Our everlasting-pain. 19 Moreover, let us for thy sake, With one another bear, (When we offences give or take) That, thine we may appear. And, that, when hence we called be, We thither, may ascend; (To live, and be belov'd, of thee) Where Love, nor Life, have end. Hymn LIIII. For Deliverance from Sicknesse. God is hereby praised for delivering us from those Distempers which deprived us of health; he is besought also, to give us grace to employ our future health to his glory, and to the health of our Souls. Sing this as the 4 Psalme. [1] VVhilst we endeavour to obay Our blessed Makers will; All Creatures do the best they may, Our Pleasures to fulfill: But, when we negligent become, In doing what we ought, All things to us are troublesome, And, bring our hopes, to nought. 2 Ev'n that, which is a part of man, (Or, in his Bowels bred) Makes insurrections, now and than, Which wound, or strike him dead. Within my Self, experiment Of this, I lately found; For, inbred-humours, had nigh sent My Body, to the ground. 3 But Drougth, and Moisture, Heat and Cold, Now reconciled be; And, such an equall Temper hold, As, health restores, to me. My fainting Spirits be releev'd; My Tast regain'd I have: My weakned Body is repreev'd, And, ransom'd from the grave. 4 For which, a Sacrifice of praise To thee, ô God! I bring; And unto thee, my voice I raise, A thankfull Hymn, to sing: Confessing, that by thee, ô Lord! And by thy grace, alone, The health and vigour is restor'd, Which I have now put on. 5 So long as here, I do enjoy The Being, I have got, Let me, my Health and Strength employ, Thine honour, to promote: And, when my Life hath reach'd that houre, Past which, I must not stay, Through weaknesse, bring me to that powre, Which, never will decay. Hymn LV. A thanksgiving, for setled Health. It is a great temporall Benefit, to be delivered from Sicknesse, but, it is a greater (if we be not unthankfull) to have a continued Health, yet few men remember to praise God, particularly, for the same. Therefore, to put us in minde of that Dutie this Hymn is tendred. Sing this as the 22. Psalme. [1] In times of Want, we feele what blisse, Our yeers of Plentie be. When War doth rage; the sweets of Peace, The meanest wit can see. And, when with Sicknesse we are pain'd We know it just, ô Lord! To render Praise and Thanks unfain'd; When Health shall be restor'd. 2 Sure then, the many healthfull Daies, And yeers, which I have had, Deserve, that heartie Songs of Praise, Should for the same be made: And, that whilst health and Strength do last, I should the same employ To memorize the Mercies past, And those which I injoy. 3 Whilst others grone with aking bones With wounds, or inward pains; VVith Gouts, or those Tormenting Stones VVhich fret and rend the Reines: Yea, while ten thousands feele the smart, VVhich on the Sick doth cease: In Head, in Body, and in Heart, I am at perfect ease. 4 Lord! ever blessed be thy name For this externall-Grace. Preserve me thankfull for the same, Whilst thou prolongst my Race. And, if to my immortall Blisse, It shall not hindrance be; (Nor Thou thereby, due Glory misse) Thus healthfull, keep thou me. 5 But, if my Patience must be tride, By Sicknesse, and by Pain; Let Sin, thereby be mortifide; And, Vertue strength obtain. Be pleas'd, likewise, that whatsoere Thy Wisdome shall impose, It be no more then I can bear; Though strong, and sharp it grows. Hymn LVI. A Hymn putting us in remembrance of Death. The Remembrance of Death, is judged a good means to make us heedfull so to live in this world, that we may live happily in the world to come; and to that purpose this Memento mori, is provided. [1] Remember Death: For, now my Tongue To sing of Death, shall tuned be. Remember Death, which els, ere long, Will to thy pain remember Thee. Remember Death, whose voice doth say, This night a man, to morrow clay. 2 If Lucre shall thy heart intise, Thy needy neighbour to oppresse: If Pride shall tempt thee to despise, Or sleight thy Brother in distresse. Remember Death: And, then, I know More Just, more humble thou wilt grow. 3 When Lust shall woo thee to commit, What, Soul and Body may defile: VVhen Sloth shall make thee lazie sit, (And let thy Talent rust the while) Remember Death, of old hath bin And is, the wages due to Sin. 4 VVhen Envie shall thy heart possesse; VVhen thou shalt Cheat, curse, sweare, or lye, VVhen thou shalt wallow in Excesse; Thy faith abuse, or God deny: Remember Death, and what attends, On wilfull Sinners latter-ends. 5 Remember, Death no truce hath made, A yeer, a moneth, or weeke to stay. Remember, how thy Flesh doth fade, And, how thy Time doth steal away. Remember, Death, will neither spare Wit, Wealth, nor those that lovely are. 6 Remember, Death foregoes the Doomes Which due to thy Deservings be. Remember this, before it comes. And, (that, Despaire oppresse not thee.) Remembring Death, remember Him; Who doth from Death, and Hell, redeeme. Hymn LVII. A Hymn of Life-eternall. That we may not be deluded by the vain pleasures, or discouraged by the afflictions of this life; The excellencies of Life-eternall are here illustrated, and the Desireablenesse thereof is in some degree expressed by this Hymn. Sing this as In Sad and Ashy weeds. [1] VVhy live I mudling here, In base and fruitlesse works employ'd? As if I knew not where A better Life might be injoy'd? Since I have sought And have been taught, The noblest things to know; Why should I still, Retain a Will, To spend more time below? 2 My Soul, that was not made, Of flitting Aire, or mouldring clay; Intelligence hath had, Of more, then words can well display. The things we see, But shaddows be, Of those, which will appear: Are nothing els But Tipes and Shells, Which Time away will weare. 3 There is a blessed-Place, (If Place, eternall things contain) Whereto, I hope to passe, When here I must no more remain. There is a Life, In which no griefe, No pain, no Fear, is found; And (more then this) It yeelds that Blisse, Which doth admit no Bound. 4 My Hope, and my Belief That of this Life I shall partake, Cures all my present Grief, And, of my Pains, doth Pleasures make. The thought of it, Makes me remit The Spights of those poore-things, Who Dominere On mole-hils, here Like foolish Pettie-kings. 5 VVhen, thither I am gone, The Love of Worldlings, or their Hate, VVill not be thought upon; Nor marr, nor better my estate. To misse, or have, What most men crave, (Who love this lothed Place,) Will, there, to me No Pleasure be; No Honour, or Disgrace. 6 That Life, who ever lives, Not only, blessed therein, is, But, thereby, also, gives Perfection to the Common-blisse. It, open sets The Cabanets, VVherein contained be Those Rarities, Which mortall eies, Shall never come to see. 7 In One, to sum up all, Which of that life, we may declare; Him, there, behold we shall, In, and By whom, all Creatures are: And, not alone, Then, look upon That, most-beloved Sight: But, gain by Grace, His free embrace; With fulnesse, of Delight. 8 Oh! thither; thither, Lord! And to this Life, my Soul convay; From this, which is abhord, And, unto Death, a tedious way. I have gone wrong, From thee, too long; For which I grieved am: And, I shall mourn, Till I return, To thee from whom I came. Hymn LVIII. A Thanksgiving after a dangerous Sicknesse; by one, who was unprepared for Death. This Hymn serves to bring to minde, how terrible Death will be to those who are not ready for it; and personates, by exemplary expressions of Fear and Thankfulnesse, what may be the condition of others, who live unprepared; and how thankfull they ought to be for mercy obtained. [1] Lord! from Death's forgetfull shade, Since I had By thy pow'r, my preservation; I will both with Heart and Tongue, Tune a Song, To thy mercies, exaltation. For, to Thankfulnesse inclinde, So I minde From what Sorrows, I was raised; That, thy Favour, shall of me, Ever be With my chiefest cunning, praised. 2 And, my Fellow-Creatures, all, When you shall Heare what grace, to me, he showeth; Daign, your Thankfulnesse, to joyn, Vnto mine, To discharge the dues it oweth. And, ô Lord! enable mee Vnto Thee, So to render praises-giving; That, all may, who heare the same Blesse thy name, That I breath'd among the living. 3 For, (as yet) me thinks, I see Life in mee, In Her powrs and Senses failing: And my shortned-panting Breath, Yeelding Death, All the Symptoms of prevailing. But, for Death, not well prepared, So I fared, That, much terrour I sustained: And, Vain-longings having, still, Thrall'd my Will; Thus, I fearefully complained. 4 VVhere is now? where is, alas? Time, that was? VVhere are all those hopes bestowed; And those pleasing Dayes, wherein, I have bin Youths beguiling Pleasure showed? Must I! must I, now (thought I) Helplesse Die? And, be carelesse left, to morrow; In a dark, and lonely grave? VVhere none have Sense of Comfort, Joy, or Sorrow? 5 VVill no mortall Wit, or Powre, From this Howre, My Despairing Soul, release? But must ev'ry earthly Thought, Come to nought, And my Hopes for ever cease? Shall I never! never-more, (As before) View the Daies approching Glory? But, must this black Night, nigh past, Be my last? And conclude my mortall-Story? 6 Such, my foolish fancies were, As you hear; And, thus fruitlesly I mourned. But, at last (by Terrors taught) Him I sought, Whose free Grace my Death adjourned. Lord! said I; observe the grones, Hear the moanes, Of a Soul in depth of anguish: And, my humble suit allow, Lest I, now, In an endlesse terror languish. 7 Sins, I have, which numberlesse, Me oppresse. And, so strongly overlay me: That, if yet I should appear, Much I fear Down to Hell, their weight might weigh me. And, Alas! can trembling Dust, So unjust, Stand before the Lord of Thunder? Whilst that Guiltinesse abides, Which divides, Me, and Comforts, far asunder? 8 Lord! I dare not to appear, Till I hear That I am to favour taken. Therefore, thy sad Servant, now, Comfort Thou, Whom all Comfort hath forsaken. Let not thy Compassion, be Lesse to me, Then my Foes despight hath proved. But, oh! let my Fear, and Pain, Once again, Be abated, and removed. 9 Iesu, for thy passion-sake, Daigne to take, From my heart all vain Affections; That, my naturall estate I may hate And delight in thy perfections. Spare; ô blest Redeemer, spare! Let my Fear To so firm a Faith be turned, That it may true Joyes beget; And, oh! let Death be, till that houre, adjourned. 10 Lord! if this, for which I pray, Gain I may; (If to health I may be raised) Of thy Love, my Song shall be: Thou, of me, Shalt, for evermore, be praised. In deep sighs (that spake aloud) Thus I vow'd; With a heart, at large distressed; And, the Spirit, help'd my mones, With such Grones, As may never be expressed. 11 Those Complaints my Saviour heard With regard: As I pray'd, right so befell it: From those Fears, which on me ceas'd, I was eas'd. And, alive I am to tell it. For which Mercy, let no day Passe away, Wherein I forget thy pitty; But till I in earth embra'st, Sleep my last, Let thy Goodnesse be my Ditty. 12 And, although a Slave to Sin, I have bin, Make me truly now abhor it. And, when Death next summons me, Let me be Ev'ry way prepared for it. So, no false, no vain delight, No Affright, From her blisse, my Soul shall sever: But, so love, so live shall I, (Live or die) That, I blest shall be for ever. Hymn LIX. A Hymn encouraging sicke persons to be willing to dye. Sicke-persons are not usually disposed to sing; yet some are somtime desirous to chear up their hearts, and strengthen themselves against the feares of Death, by considering the Priviledges of Life-eternall: And, perhaps they who want strength to sing this Hymn, shall receive comfort to heare these Meditations sung by others in their presence. Sing this as the Pater-noster. [1] If by the Signes foresee we may, When our short Lease of Life is done; Now neer unto me seems the day, In which my Glasse will quite be run: And, I that here, yet lie, and grone, Shall to my resting place be gone. 2 My moisture, and my vitall heat, In me, do now begin to cease. My pulses out of Order beat; Strength failes, and Weaknesse doth increase. Therefore, ere Death all sense bereave, Thus, of the World, I take my leave. 3 First, my Deare Friends, farewell to you, Live blessed in a true belief. Disturbe you not my last adieu, By fruitlesse Teares, or needlesse grief: For, from a prison full of woe, To Bowres of Joy, and Rest I goe. 4 For aye, adue my hopes of health; Farewell to all my vain Desires. I have no pleasure now in wealth: My Soul to better things, aspires. All earthly pleasures are untrue: I, therefore bid them all adue. 5 My flesh, oh! be not thou afraid, To let my Soul depart from thee. Or, when thou all alone art laid, Where thou must quite corrupted be, For since my Saviour lodged there, He from the Grave hath banish'd fear. 6 What though within that lonely place, In darknesse, and in stench thou lie, Where wormes thy feature shall deface, And make thee lothsome to the eie? Thou shalt to life again arise; Renewed in a glorious wise. 7 Thy Soul (of which thou art so fain) Although from thee it shall depart; Will come and find thee out again, However hid, or chang'd thou art. You shall be joined, as before; And, never be divided more. 8 What pleasure in thy life appears, As thou art now deform'd and pain'd? What get'st thou but renewed cares, If Life with Health might be regain'd? This Life is nought but pain and grief: Yea, pain, somtime, without relief. 9 My Flesh then goe; yea, gladly go Of thy last Bed, to be possest. O! wherefore dost thou linger so, In Torments, when thou may'st have rest? Know'st thou, what followes after Death, Thou could'st not love this aiërie Breath. 10 Thou shalt in Beauty passe the Stars; And no defect on thee shall rest. Thou shalt be swifter then the Sphears; And wear perfections of the best. Death is a Gate (though somwhat low) Through which to highest Blisse we go. 11 In Thee, now, Sins and Sicknes dwels, Vncertain hopes, and certain pain: And thou art fit for nothing els, But, thy Corruptions to retain. Thy Mates by Death, shall Angels be, And God himself, shall dwell in Thee. 12 Since nothing more thou canst desire, Now give thy Soul, a free release. To thy Great-Grandames wombe, retire; There, take thy rest, in Hope and Peace: And, God (who formed thee of Clay) Grant thee a Ioyfull rising-Day. Hymn LX. Another Hymn encouraging against the feare of Death. The Sick, are here taught to encourage their Soules to be willing to leave this Life, and enjoy the perfections of the next world. And, to that end, some Jnconveniences of this Life; and some of the Benefits, which the Faithfull enjoy by Immortality, are mentioned in this Hymn. Sing this, as I loved once. [1] My Soul, why dost thou linger so, And in thy prison, seeke to stay? Since thou art summon'd hence to go, By Sicknesse, which prepares thy way? VVhy would'st thou loyter longer here Perplext with pains, and vext with Fear? God cals us hence, Come, come along, And, let us meet him with a Song. 2 VVhy, on this Carkasse dost thou dote, VVherewith, too long thou hast been cloth'd? VVhat have you by your Friendships got, But Sin and Sorrowes to be loth'd? Since, thou hast Licence to be free, No longer now, inthralled be; But, come away; come, come along, And meet thy Maker with a Song. 3 Thy wanton flesh (to thee so Dear) By searching where thy strength was laid; Hath oft (though friendly she appear) Vnto thy Passions, thee betraid. This Troup, with her, still watching lies, To put out Faith's and Reasons eies. These Foes, then stay thou not among; But, fly thou from them with a Song. 4 Consider this unhappie place, How full it is of discontent. Remember well thy noble Race, And from whose Bosome, thou wast sent. There is a place reserv'd for Thee, Where endlesse Joyes and Pleasures be: From thence thou tarriest over-long, Fly, fly thou thither with a Song: 5 Thine Essence, here, becomes impure: But, there, it shall refined grow. Thy knowledge, here, is but obscure: There, ev'ry Secret thou shalt know. Though poore thou art, and sleighted here; Thou shalt be rich, and honor'd there. Therefore, thy Blisse no more prolong: But, fly thou thither with a Song. 6 Here, spightfull men, and wicked Fiends, To marre thy Quiet are inclin'd. There, for thy Fellowes, and thy Friends, Both Saints and Angels thou shalt find. There, thou shalt both behold and know, Thy pious Friends dead long agoe; And Hallelujah, those among, Shall be, thine Everlasting-Song. 7 Moreover, there, thou shalt behold, Those Worthies, whose deserved praise, For vertuous Deeds, in times of old, Hath made them famous in those daies. And, more then this; thou there shalt see The Son of God, who dide for thee. Then, do not here thy stay prolong; But, goe, and praise him in a Song. 8 Go, view the glorie of his face; Go, kisse his wounds for thee receiv'd; Go, and his blessed feet embrace: Go, and possesse what was beleev'd. Go, and confesse with Saba's Queen, That lesse is told, then may be seen: And since Report his Fame doth wrong, Enlarge his Glory in thy Song. 9 Go, and in God, those Ioyes possesse, And, that well-being (without end) Which language never could expresse, Nor Heart of mortall apprehend. There, praise the Founder of that Blisse. And, when thy Body raised is; (Which, God will bring to passe ere long) Praise Him, together in one Song. Hymn LXI. A Lamentation in times of excessive Rain. In this Hymn we lament the miseries like to befall in by excessive Rains and Waters, confessing that plague justly inflicted for our sins; beseeching it may beget in us true penetency; that upon Repentance the plague may be removed; and, that the same being removed, we may be thankfull. Sing this as the Lamentation. [1] Although Transgressors, Lord, we be, (And, thy Displeasure justly fear) To sing a mournfull-Song to thee, Before thy Presence, we appear. Oh! mind thou not our follies past; But, our Submission, daigne to heed. And (since our hope on thee is plac't) Both hear, and help us at our need. 2 For, now ô God! that Aiery-Sphear (Which is to bound the upper Deeps From those that underneath us are) Continuall vapours, on us, weeps. The Floods-beneath do swell more high Then their accustom'd Limits goe; And they which are above the Skie, Do presse, to meet the Deeps below. 3 Thy Servants, therefore, are afraid, That, if thou send not thy Command, Whereby their daring may be staid, Our whole undoing is at hand. For, Lord, by these excessive rains, We lose, not only Time and Cost, But, therewith our laborious pains, And, means of Life, is, likewise lost. 4 Thou wilt we know, permit no more, An universall Over-flowing; Nor frustrate make, as heretofore, The Times of Harvest, or of Sowing. But, Lord! to us what profits it, That, so it promis'd was by Thee; If now the Waters thou permit, The present Spoile of us to be? 5 Or, what to live will it availe, If Raine and Moisture in excesse, Shall make the means of Life to faile, And keep us lingring in distresse? Except in bearing of that Crosse, Which this Affliction may procure, We gain Repentance by the losse, And make some Future Blessing sure. 6 For these great Rains, perhaps are sent To make us heedfull of our Sin, And, with compunction to lament The waies which we have erred in. O! teach us Lord, if it be so, Our grosse offences to bemone: And, let a pleasant Season show That, thy Displeasure quite is gone. 7 Let not thine Vniversall-Grace To us, in speciall be denide: For speciall-Favour, here is place: O! let that also be applide. Dry up, or chase the Clouds away, Whose vapours breed corrupted Aire. Disperse those Fogs, which dim the day, Make thou the Weather clear and faire. 8 To us, vouchsafe, likewise, ô God! The Drought-desired, to prolong; That, we may change this mournfull-Ode, Into a praisefull, Joyfull-Song. And, when the Soile, so dry shall grow, That show'rs will needful be again; In season, Lord! on us bestow The Former, and the latter-Rain. Hymn LXII. A thanksgiving after excessive Raines. When we are delivered from the plague of excessive Rains and Waters; they who desire to sing a Song of Thanksgiving for the same, may musically expresse their gratitude in this briefe Hymn. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] The show'rs which wash'd away almost, The Comfort of our pains; (And fruitlesse made our hopes and Cost) Thy mercy, Lord! restrains, Thy Breath hath purg'd the foggie Aire: The Sun, doth bright appear. The Fields waxe dry, The wayes grow faire; The Skie, from Clouds is clear. 2 We, therefore, turn our mournfull Songs, Into a thankfull Ode, And, we confesse, the praise belongt, To none, but thee, ô God! Accept the service we professe, And, give us grace, ô Lord! To manifest our Thankfulnesse, As well in Deed, as Word. Hymn LXIII. For times of extreame Drougth. Many afflictions accompany excessive Drougths, as may appear by this Lamentation, whereby they who are unsensible of such a Judgement, may be made more sensible of Gods Visitation in that kinde; and such as have a true feeling thereof, may have words whereby to expresse the same to the stirring up of penitence in their hearts. [1] Hear! oh great Almighty King! Who from Earth's extreamest part, Lightnings, Winds, and Rains do'st bring: And, commander of them, art. Thou art he, who sends the Rils, To refresh the fruitfull plains; And bedewes the thirsty Hils, With sweet Show'rs, and wholsome Rains. Hear, and heed thou from on high, This, our loud and wofull cry: For, from thee, we seek relief; Who, hast Cures, for ev'ry Grief. 2 By a wastfull scortching Drougth, We, now Lord, afflicted be; And, the Earth with gaping mouth, Makes a sad Complaint to Thee. Hils, and Dales, and Fields, and Downs, Robes of Sorrow have put on; And in mourning-Ruslet Gowns, Our Distresses do bemone. For (unlesse thou gracious be) Bird, and Beast, and Herb, and Tree, And what e're doth Breathe or Spring, To decay; this Drougth will bring. 3 Lo, the Branch that leaved was, Is become a wither'd Spray. Medowes, lately cloth'd with grasse, Now, are short unmowed-hay. Where much Corne did freshly sprout, All is now consum'd with Heat. And, the Flocks that skipt about, Now do pine, for want of meat. Pain'd by Thirst, the Heards do rore; Hunger makes our cattell poore: And, unlesse thou Mercy show, They that owne them, poore will grow. 4 Earth (whose ever-teeming wombe, Many Births, at once could bear) Now, unfertile is become; And, her Fruits abortive are. At her Brest, the late green plant, Starv'd, by lack of Sap, doth lie. Moisture, now her Furrowes want; And her Clods are stark and drie. Clouds of Dust, in stead of Rain, Overspread both Hill and Plain: From his Banks, the River shrinks; And the standing-water stinks. 5 Lord! with pitty now behold, How distrest thy Creatures be. At such needs, in times of old, Help hath bin vouchsaf'd by Thee When the People thirsty was, Thou from Rocks didst water bring. In the Jaw-bone of an Asse, Thou for Sampson mad'st a Spring. When Elias thee besought, Needfull Rain, was timely brought: And, thou mad'st the water sweet, Which for usage was unmeet. 6 In the Floods, thy Chambers are; They with Clouds be roof'd and wall'd. To attend thy pleasure, there, Dewes and show'rs are still exhal'd. When we serve thee, they are sent. To refresh us in our needs. When we merit to be shent, Thence Correction then proceeds. When thou frown'st, the weather low'rs; And, by Stormes or Drougth devours: When thou smilest, we obtain, Kindly Warmth, and timely Rain: 7 Lord, forgive us that offence VVhich hath stir'd thine Anger thus: Take this wasting Drougth from hence; VVith calme show'rs recomfort us. Let it plentifully Rain, That it may refresh the Aire. Drop thy fatnesse on the plain; And the parched Hils repaire. Mark what mone the Fowles do make; On the beasts, compassion take: Think upon the Widowes need; And, the wants of Orphanes, heed. 8 By the moisture of thy Dew, To the Plants new vigour give. The decayed Herbs renew; And the scorched seeds revive. That the grasse anew may grow, Where withall our Beasts are fed: That, there may be Corn enow, To supply our daily bread. That, to make us also glad, Wine, and oyle may still be had: And, that these Lamenting Laies May be chang'd to Songs of praise. Hymn LXIIII. A Thanksgiving after a Drougth. God is hereby praised for vouchsafing to refresh the scorched Fields with needfull dewes, and showers upon the humble petition of his Servants who had been afflicted by an excessive Drougth. Sing this as the 23. Psalme. [1] So pow'rfull are the faithfull Cries, Which men afflicted raise; That, to ascend the starry Skies, They find out secret waies. And, thou hast Lord, an open ear To ev'ry Soul distrest, Which with a due regard will hear The meanest mans request. 2 The Clouds, oh God! at thy Commands, Did needfull show'rs distill; Whereby the dry and thirsty lands, Have sweetly drunk their fill. That scorching Drougth is now alayd, Which Grasse and Corne destroyes; And, that for which we humbly pray'd, Thine heritage injoyes. 3 As well as to the Just, oh Lord! To us, that wicked be. Thou Raine and Sun-shine dost afford When suit is made to thee. To thee, Love, Wisdome, Pow'r and Fame, Ascribed be therefore. And blessed be thy holy-Name, Both, now, and evermore. Hymn LXV. A Thanksgiving for seasonable Weather in generall. This is a Hymn of Praise for that seasonable Weather whereby we are inabled to receive the fruits of the earth, or continued hopefull of that blessing. Sing this as Te Deum. [1] Lord! should the Sun, the Clouds, the Wind, The Aire and Seasons be To us as froward, and unkind, As we are false to thee; Our Labours would, by Winds or Storms, By Drougth or else by Rain; By Heat, or Cold, by Weeds, or Wormes, Prove Labours all in vain. 2 But, from our Duties, though we swerve, Thou, still, do'st Mercy show; And, us and ours from spoile preserve, That we might thankfull grow. Yea, though from day to day we sin, And thy disfavour gain; Assoon as we to cry begin, Forgivenesse, we obtain. 3 The Weather now, thou changed hast, Which lately made us fear: And, when our hopes were almost past, Sweet comforts did appear. The Heavens, the Earth's complaints have heard: They reconciled be: And, thou such weather hast prepar'd, As we desir'd of thee. 4 For which, with up rais'd hands and eres, (As purely as we may) The due, and easie Sacrifice Of Thanks, we now repay. And since the Aire thou changest thus, That we thereby are eas'd: We pray thee work that change in us, Whereby thou maist be pleas'd. Hymn LXVI. A Thanksgiving after Thunder and Lightning. Thunder and Lightning are terrible in their owne nature; and have oft-times very dreadfull effects: Therefore, we ought to praise God, when we have heard and seene him, in those works of his without the destruction of our Goods &amp; Persons. Sing this as the former. [1] No earthly Terror, Lord, can make A Sinner more to fear Then when in Thunder thou do'st speak, Loud threatnings in his ear. Thee, therefore, we did humbly pray, Thy Stormes aside to blow; And, down thy Thunder-bolts to lay As is vouchsafed now. 2 The dreadfull Sounds, and fiery darts, Which lately us appal'd; And greatly terrifide our hearts, Thy Mercy hath recall'd. Yea, from the scorching sulphurie Blast, Which from those Engines came; Thou us, oh Lord! preserved hast, For which we praise thy Name. 3 In Language, filling us with awe, Thou needest not to speak, If of thy Prophets, and thy Law, More notice we would take. Oh! give us grace, the loving voice Of Mercy, so to hear; That Justice make not such a noise As fils with servile Fear. Hymn LXVII. After a great Winde. The Winde is a serviceable Spirit, which being set at liberty to punish us for our Sins, produceth many terrible effects; Therefore, when the tempestuous fury is alayed, whereby it sometimes threateneth us, we shall doe well to acknowledge Gods mercy for the same. Sing this, as the former. [1] VVhen hearty thanks we render not, For what we do obtain; We merit well to be forgot, When we shall next complain. The blust'ring Winds that fiercely rag'd, And Bowres, and Buildings tore; Are by thy Mercy, Lord, asswag'd, And ruffle now no more. 2 Calm gales they breath; and make it plain, (By these effects we see) That, He who in the Aire doth raign, Subjected is to thee. We magnifie thy Name, therefore, And, will in thee repose Our Trust, and Hope, for evermore, What Winde soever blowes. Hymn LXVIII. After a great Frost or Snow. Great Frosts and Snowes are somtime made the executioners of Gods Justice upon a sinfull Land, that frozen Charity may be unthawed by Repentance: And this Hymn remembers us to be thankfull when God shall remove such a Iudgement from us. Sing this as the former. [1] From Colds, late nipping Herbs and Trees, (Afflicting Man and Beast) And making Lakes and Rivers freeze, Thou, Lord! hast us releast. The Clods are thaw'd; The Ice doth melt; The Creatures, lately griev'd Are eased of the pains they felt; And, from their Fears repriev'd. 2 We praise thee, for this blessed change; And thankfull are to thee, That thou thy help do'st not estrange, When we afflicted be. Let thy Compassion us dispose, (Where we shall need behold) To melt in pitty, towards those To whom our Love is cold. Hymn LXIX. In a Time of Famine. Famine is one of the three great Plagues whereby God usually corrects a sinfull Nation; and by this Hymn we are taught how to addresse our complaints to God, in this Visitation, &amp;c. Sing this as the 22. Psalme. [1] By Mercies and by Iudgements, Lord! We have bin often tride, In disobeying of thy Word, How constant we abide: For, when we gently are chastis'd, We stubborn-hearted be; And, when our longings are suffic'd, We kick, and spurn at Thee. 2 For, which thou quite might'st us refuse, And, say, as heretofore Thou say'st unto the stubborn Jewes: J will correct no more. But, still, thy Love to us is true; And, ev'ry means doth find By which thou maist compassion shew, And, be both Iust and Kind. 3 The Plenties which we lately had, By us, abused were. And, Thou a Scarcenesse now hast made, By which we pinched are. If thou hadst left us to our Sin, By feeding our Excesse; That Vengeance had the greater bin, Though it had seemed lesse. 4 Thou, still, proceed'st with Chastisement In such a loving wise; That we may be the Punishment, Find where our Error lies. And, if we be not hardned quite, We by the Stripes may see That, thou in Mercy hast delight; Though strokes inflicted be. 5 Yea, though this Famine pincheth sore, Good Symptomes we may find, That, thou in Anger evermore Remembrest to be kind, And, still, some blessings are injoy'd, By which we hope retain, That, quite we shall not be destroid, Though we in want, remain. 6 Where Milk and Hony overflow'd Lean Famine breaketh in, When Plenty, late her Bounty shew'd, A Dearth doth now begin. And, they who had the finest bread, The fattest of thy Meat; And were with many dainties fed, Have little now to eat. 7 But Lord, once more to us return, Though we unworthy are: Consider how the poore do mourn, And what the Rich may fear. Forgive the Sins which have bereft, The Plenties which we had; And, let the portion which is left, By thee, be larger made. 8 Oh! hear us, though we still offend, Augment our wasted store: Into this Land, that Plenty send, Which fil'd it heretofore. Then, give us grace, to use it so, That thou mai'st pleased be; And, that when fuller we shall grow, We think not lesse on Thee. Hymn. LXX. A Thanksgiving for Plenty. Plenty is the cure of Famine; and a Blessing, for which we much labour; yet when it is obtained, we many times become so wanton thereby, that we not only abuse that Benefit, but many other Mercies accompanying the same, to prevent which unthankfulnesse, this Hymn was composed. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] How oft, and by how many Crimes, Thee Jealous have we made? And, blessed God! how many times, Have we forgivenes had? If we with teares, to bed, at night, For our Transgressions go; To us, before the Morning light, Thou Comforts dost bestow. 2 This pleasant Land, which for our Sin Was, lately, barren made, Her fruitfulnesse doth new begin, And we our Hopes have had. For which in praisefull Songs, to thee, We raise our voices Lord! And, thankfull, we desire to be For what, thou dost afford. 3 Vouchsafe we wast not by excesse, Thy Blessings like the swine; Or into gracelesse wantonnes, Convert this Grace of thine. But, so let us thy Gifts imploy; And, so refresh the poore: That, in this Land, we may enjoy These Plenties, evermore. Hymn LXXI. In times of Pestilence, or other infectious Sicknesse. This Hymn putteth us in mind (by professing our dependance upon God) that we make him our sole Refuge in times of danger. Confession, is here made also, that our Sins are the Cause of Sicknesse or infectious diseases: and God is humbly besought to be our protector in this danger. Sing this as the 51. Psalme. [1] By trusting unto thee, oh God! And, by reposing in thy shade; A Shelter, and a safe-Abode, In many Dangers, we have had. And, good Assurances we have, That, while on thee we do depend, Thou wilt from publike Danger save; And from all private harmes defend. 2 In Thee, this trust we have repos'd: Thy Succour, therefore, we expect, Now perill hath our Souls inclos'd; And, our Destruction, seems to threat. For, Sins Infections have bin spred, By lewd Examples, now, so far, That those Contagions they have bred, Whereby our lives endanger'd are. 3 Lord! let thy Spirit, from on high, On us, those healthfull Breathings blow, Which may our Climate purifie; And, wholsome Aire on us bestow. And, let our Flesh and Blood, become So purged, by thy sacred Word; That, we may be secured from The strokes of this devouring Sword. 4 Oh! call thy slaughtring Angell home. And (though we merit not such grace) Compassionate, and kind become To us, in this distressed Case. Vouchsafe us hearts that may repent, Those Courses, which do thee displease: And, give us wisdome to prevent The violence of this Disease. 5 Let not the shaft which flies by day, Nor that, which terrifies by night, To slaughter, wound, or to dismay Within our Dwellings, Lord, alight. But, let thy saving-Angell bide About our Persons, ev'ry how'r, A shelter, for us, to provide, Against this plagues malignant pow'r. 6 Or, if this Harbinger of Death, Must in our Flesh, prepare him Room; Let not the losse of Health, or Breath, A mischief, or a plague become. And, let both Death and Sicknes prove A means of everlasting Blisse; And, from these Dangers, us remove To live where no Corruption is. Hymn LXXII. For Deliverance from publike Sicknes. When an infectious Pestilence breaketh in upon us, it is an extraordinary Mercy that we are not all rooted out. Therefore, when God removes the same, we are hereby remembred to acknowledge it to his praise. Sing this as the Pater-noster. [1] Lord, when a Nation thee offends, And when thou would'st correct their l?ds; An Army, still, on Thee attends, To execute thy just Commands. Yea, Famine, Sicknesse, Fire, and Sword; Stand ready to fulfill thy word. 2 And, here, among us for our Sin, A strong Infection lately raign'd Whose Rage hath so malignant bin, As that it could not be restrain'd By any care, or Art of our, Or by a lesse, then heav'nly pow'r. 3 To thee, therefore, our Cries we sent, Thy wonted Clemency to prove: And, our misdoings did lament That Visitation to remove. And, thou thine Angell didst command, To stay his Death-inflicting hand. 4 For which to thee, in humble wise, Both heart, and hand, oh LORD! we raise; And, have exchang'd our former Cries, To Joyfull Songs of thankfull praise: Confessing, that, by Thee, we have Escap'd the Dungeon of the Grave. Hymn LXXIII. A Lamentation in time of War. War, is the last and worst of those Temporall-Plagues, whereby God scourgeth a wicked Nation, and it includeth all other miseries. Therefore, when that Iudgement is sent forth against us, we are warned hereby, so to consider what is fallen upon us; and to become so penitent, that God may be intreated to withdraw that Plague. Sing this as the 51. Psalme. [1] Of all those Judgements which thy Word, For Sin, oh Lord! denounced hath, None are more dreadfull then the Sword; Or, more inform us of thy wrath. Except it be, when men are, quite, To Sin, without Correction left; Expos'd to Sathans worst despight; Or, of a quiet minde bereft. 2 For, when by other plagues we smart, By thine own hand, chastiz'd we be: And, Lord! so pitifull thou art, That, Mercy, still abounds in thee. But, when our Faults thou dost correct, By tyranous and cruell men, A sad event, we may expect; And, hope for little Mercy, then. 3 Oh God! this dreadfull Plague of War, All other earthly Plagues includes: For Dearths, and all Diseases are Attending where this Feind intrudes, Oppressions, and continuall Fears, Wounds, Watchings, Dangers, and unrest, Incessant Griefs, and endlesse cares, By warfare, Kingdomes do molest. 4 War, from the Childe, his Parents takes; And robs the Father of his Childe: Of old, and young, it havoke makes; And, thereby Matrons are defilde. War turns, the Freeman to a Slave: It bringeth Nobles to distresse: And maketh Cutthroat villains brave, With what great Princes did possesse. 5 It goodly Temples overturns; And Acteth Ill, where Good was taught. The fairest Buildings, down it burns; And, sets both God, and Man at naught. Yea, quite it ruins in one day, What many Ages could not rear; And bringeth Cities to decay, Which through the World, renowned were. 6 Chase thou oh Lord! this Tyrant hence: Permit thou not, his hand of Blood, To beare the Scourge of our offence; But, take it to thy Self, oh God! Though many wayes, we have misdone, We none have wrong'd, so much as Thee: Therefore, oh Lord! by Thee alone, Corrected for it, let us be. 7 When but the sounds of War, they hear, The hearts of many, so are strook, That they are overcome with Fear. How, then, Wars presence can they brook? Lord, let thy mercy so provide That, from our Coasts he may be chas'd: That, Peace may in our Borders bide; And, keep our Dwellings undefac'd. 8 And, Lord! since War, such Terrors brings; Such mischieves, and so much distresse; And since perpetually there Springs, Joy, wealth, and ease, from blessed Peace, Let us endeavour to regain This Peace, by what good means we may, And if the same we reobtain Take heed, we fool it not away. Hymn LXXIV. A thanksgiving for Peace. Peace is the nurse of Plentie, and the means of so many other blessings that God cannot be sufficiently praised for it. This therefore is composed, that we who have enjoyed this blessing more then most other Nations might be more thankfull for it here after. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] So cause us, Lord! to think upon The Blessing we possesse, That we may praise what thou hast done, And thy great love confesse. For, we whose Fields in Ages past, With bloodshed were distain'd, Whilst Fire and Sword layd others waste, In safetie, have remain'd. 2 No armed Bands, the Plough-man fears, No Towr's are overturn'd; No Temple shakes about our ears; No Townships now are burn'd. No Father hears his little Childe, In vain, for succour cry: No Husband sees his Wife defilde, Whilst he doth wounded lye. 3 Dear God! vouchsafe to pittie those Who thus distressed be: That, to defend them from their Foes They may have help from thee. For, by thy Mercy we obtain'd These calme and peacefull Dayes; And for this Peace, with hearts unfain'd We, now, do Sing thy Praise. 4 Aswell for our internall Peace, As for that outward Rest, Which by thy Favour we possesse Thy goodnesse, is confest, Oh take not, Lord! this grace away, But, let it still endure And, grant thy mercies make us may, More thankfull, not secure. Hymn LXXV. For Victorie. All Victorie is of God, who is the Lord of Hoasts: therefore to him only belongs the glory of those victories which we shall obtain; and this Hymn remembers us to ascribe all our prevailings to his power and mercy. Sing this as the X. Commandements. [1] Oh Lord! we magnifie thy Might, By whose prevailing grace and pow'r, We are preserv'd from their despight Who sought, that they might us devour. Thou art our Joyfull Triumph-song; Thou art the Comfort of our heart: To thee all Victories belong; And, thou the God of Armies art. 2 It was, alone, thy Providence Which made us Masters of the Field: Thou art our Castle of defence; Our Fort, our Bulwark, and our Shield. Thou taughtst our Hands &amp; Arms to fight; By thee, undaunted we were made: By thee, our Foes were put to flight; By Thee the conquest we have had. 3 For, on what hand soere we went, Great perils, us did round enclose: Our little strength, was almost spent, And fierce and bloody, were our Foes. That, hadst not thou our Captain been, To lead us on, and off again; This happie day we had not seen, But in the Bed of Death had lain. 4 This Hymn, we therefore Sing to Thee: And pray thee, that, as heretofore, Thou wouldst our gracious Refuge be, And our Protector evermore. Yea, to our Foes let it be shown, How to our Cause thou dost incline; And make it unto them be known, That, such as are our Foes are thine. Hymn LXXVI. For Publike Deliverances. God hath vouchsafed unto these kingdomes, many publike Deliverances, which ought never to be forgotten, especially those on the fift of November, and 1588. And this Hymn was intended, to bring those, and such like, oftner to remembrance. Sing this as the Pater-noster. [1] With Isr'el, we may truly say If on our side, God had not been; Of us, our Foes had made a prey, And, we this Light, had never seen The Pit was dig'd, The Snare was laid; And, we with ease, had been betray'd. 2 But, our Opposers, undertook What they did faile to bring to passe. For, he that all things doth or'e look, Prevented what conspired was. We found the Pit; we scap'd the Gin, And saw their Makers caught therein. 3 By Favour undeserved shown From God, this means of safetie came; And, by no wisdome of our own: Oh! let us therefore, praise his name. Oh! praise his Name: for, it was He, That broke the Net, and set us free. 4 With praises let our Temples ring; Let on our Lips, thanksgivings dwell. Let us, unto his honour sing, And, Stories of his Mercies tell. While Sun, and Moon, do rise, or set; His kindnesse, let us not forget. 5 Oh! let us now redeeme the Time: Let us begin to live anew. Let us repent of ev'ry crime, Whereby, displeasure may ensue: Lest he that plagues from us hath took; Return them, with a doubled strook. 6 A true Repentance takes delight To memorize what God hath done: When passed Favours, we recite, It adds more Grace, to grace begun. And, when such vertues do encrease; They promise everlasting peace. 7 But, where Ingratitude we see; And, when so wicked we are grown, That sleighted those protections be, Which God hath formerly bestown, It shall betoken, to this Land That her Destruction is at hand. 8 Lord! let us not be hardned so: Nor let thine Anger so return: But, grant we may our duties do; And for our sinfull Follies mourn: That from our Sorrows, joy may Spring; And we thy praises, gladly Sing. Hymn LXXVII. When we are merry-hearted. Sometimes we are more then ordinarily inclined to cheerfulnesse, and what we should then doe, we are advised by the Apostle Iames. And lest our mirth corrupt into vanity, rather then invite us to sing Psalmes, this Hymn offereth somewhat to consideration, which may preserve, and sanctifie our cheerfulnesse. [1] Methinks I feele more perfect Rest, Refreshing now, my mind; And more contentment in my breast, Then ev'ry day I find. Such Notions there, Begotten are, And forth such thoughts they bring; That though I would My voice withhold, I cannot chuse but sing. 2 Too oft vain musings do dispose My heart, to fruitlesse Mirth. And fill it with such fumes as those Which vapour from the earth. On such a Fit, Sometime, I hit, I know nor how, nor why: And, as the same Vnlook'd for came, Ev'n so away t'will fly. 3 Oh LORD! if this be such a Toy, Let some well-guided thought, Translate it to a better Joy; Or, bring the same to nought. For, such Delights, Are like some Sights, Which in the dark appear: At their first view, They comfort shew, At last, they make us fear. 4 Let those Delights which Fancie fains, To please a crased mind; And, that which Folly entertains With me, no liking find. But, let in me, Increased be, Those Comforts, and those Joyes, Which do not flow From things below: And, which no time destroyes. Hymn LXXVIII. A Lamentation and Petition of the Soule, for and against her flesh. By this Hymn, we are put in mind to be so watchfull over the Infirmities and Corruptions of our Flesh; that we take heed, lest our Sensualitie bring Soul and Body to destruction; and that we beseech Gods assisting Grace, to help the Soule govern as she ought, and to subdue the Flesh, to the Law of Grace, and Reason. Sing this as the 43. Psalme. [1] Ah me! where may I seek a Friend? Or, where have hopes to finde One that is Faithfull to the end; And never proves unkinde? Since mine own Flesh, (and for whose sake, My Self I oft forget) Doth with my cruelst Foe partake; And, is against me set? 2 She, in whose Bosome, I have laid, And, who hath slept in mine; She, with whom, I have often plaid, And, lov'd with Love-divine: She that made show, as if my Grief, Her greatest Grief would be; (And called me, her Ioy, her Life) Is carelesse, now, of me. 3 The more I trust, the more I love, The more my love I show; The more unfaithfull She doth prove: The more she works my woe. Yet, still, my heart upon her dotes; And (through her wanton wiles) My Reason, still, she so besots, That, still, She me beguiles. 4 Sometime, these wrongs I so revolve, That, her I much condemn: And, in my Iudgement, can resolve, Her Fawnings to contemn. I take her Pleasant-things away, Her Longings I restrain; I make her watch, and fast and pray, Vntill she Teares doth fain. 5 To see her grieve, then grieve I too, And loving words apply; Lest to her self, she wrongs may do, Or of the Sullens, dye. And, She no sooner feels my heart Her Freedome to restore; But, she begins to play her part, As falsly, as before. 6 Teach me, my God! teach me the way To make her more sincere; Lest, She, her Selfe, and Me, betray To Him, whose Hate I fear. For, so I love (though plain I see Of me, she carelesse is) That Heav'n would seem a Hell to me, If Her, I there should misse. 7 To be my Darling, she was born: And Nature did provide That, t'wixt us, Friendship should be sworn, Which, nothing shall divide; And, therefore, on each other, so Our welfare doth depend; That, if the One to ruine go, Such is the Others end. 8 Therefore, oh Lord! unlesse thy love Prevent what much I fear, We, to each other, Foes may prove, The worst that ever were. Because, if they who love as we, Their Passions guid not well: On Earth each others plagues they be, And greater plagues in Hell. 9 My God! therefore, thy help again, Thy help, I do implore, That I my Fleshly part, to rein, May be inabled more. My Soul, instruct thou so to guid; So make my flesh obey; That, we true-Lovers may abide, In Vertues harmles Way. 10 And, though all Vertues we had got (Where of the best may boast) Vnto our selves, Lord, leave us not: Lest all, again, be lost. For, till the Flesh be mortifi'd, Her nature, will return; Though she was partly sanctifi'd, When she, anew, was born. Hymn LXXIX. Of the vanity and insufficiency of temporall things. That we may not be evermuch delighted with such Things as perish, to the losse of our portion in things of most Excellency. We are hereby remembred to consider the Vanitie and Insufficiency of Temporall Things. Sing this as a Hermit-poore. [1] What is there Lord Within this Lower Orbe, Which doth afford, A pleasure or content? But may disease, Discomfort or disturbe, Vnlesse thou please Their mischiefs to prevent? No marvell, tho The worst do sorrows bring; Since there is woe, In ev'ry pleasant thing. 2 Wealth bringeth Care Sometimes, as much as Want. Our Honours are Attended with disgrace. When Hopes are best, Our Hearts with Fears do pant. Our daint'est Feast, Is marr'd with btiter sawce. Distrust, to lose The Pleasure, we possesse, Them overthrowes, Or makes their sweetnes lesse. 3 Our Beauties fade, Assoon as they are blown. We Weak are made, E're we are fully strong. We often dote, When wisest we are grown. Youth, frees us not From Griefs, whil'st we are yong. No Age, or State, Condition, or Degree, Can promise that, In which no Changes be. 4 That, which we sought, With all our pow'rs, to win As if we thought, Our chiefest Blisse it were: That, which esteem'd Above our lives, hath hin; And, which hath seem'd Beyond Salvation, dear. That is at last, A thing unpleasing made; And leaves no tast, Of those Contents, it had. 5 They, who in me Their chief Delights did place; Now, senslesse be That e're so fond they were. They, in whose love, I, no lesse pleased was; No liking, move; And Strangers now they are. Yea, what with pain, I sought; I now do lothe, Oh God! how vain Was that, or I, or both. 6 What we despise, Anon, is precious thought. What, we now prize, E're long, we much disdain. This Day we love, Whom, next we set at nought. And fickle prove, Yet shamelesly complain. Their Vanitie, Things mortall publish thus; And certaintie, Ther's none, in them, or Vs. 7 Oh Lord! since we, And, all that here we love, Things changing be; Let us on Thee depend. From Things below, (To reach the things above) Thy Servant show, Which way he should ascend. And, let me there, Live, Love, and loved be; Where Pleasures are, Whose end I shall not see. Hymn LXXX. When a deare Freind is deceased. Some, are so sensible of losing their dearly beloved Friends, that, they are almost swallowed up with grief. Therefore this Hymn was prepared to mitigate their sorrow, by directing them for consolation to Him, in whom they may find againe their deceased friends, and better comforts then they lost. Sing this as, In sad and Ashie weeds. [1] Now my Dear Friend is gon, Ah me! how faint my heart appears! How sad! and how alone! How swoln with sighs, how drown'd with tears! Fain would I tell, What Griefs, what Hell, Is now within my breast. But who doth live, That ease can give? Or bring me wished Rest? 2 Those eares which I would fain, Should once more hear what I would say, Shall never, now again, Vnto their Heart, my Thoughts convay. Nor shall that Tongue, Whose Tones, were Song, And, musick, still to me; To please, or chear, My drouping ear; Hereafter tuned be. 3 Oh Dear! oh gracious God! If in our selves, we blisse had sought; Of Passions, what a lode, Vpon my Soul, had now been brought! How had I found, Within that Round, Wherein, I should have run? The joyfull end, Which doth befriend, Affections well, begun. 4 Had we our Love confin'd To that, which mortall proves to be: Or, had we been so blind, That we death's pow'r could not foresee. Where had been found, When under ground, My Dear-companion lay, A fit Relief, To cure that Grief, Which wounds my Heart, this Day? 5 But, while we liv'd and lov'd, In Thee, each other up we stor'd, My Friend (by Death remov'd) In thee, therefore, I seek, oh Lord! My Losse, by none, But, Thee alone, Repaired, now, can be. What I endure, Admits nor Cure, Nor Ease, except by thee. 6 Be thou to my sad heart, A sweet Relief, now I am griev'd. Be to it as thou wert, When, here with me, my Dearest liv'd. That which I lov'd, Is but remov'd, To Thee, our Perfect Blisse. And that I had Was but the shade Of what my Darling is. 7 In Thee, Behold I shall; In Thee, I shall again enjoy; What thou away didst call, And what thou didst by Death destroy. We, by thy Grace, Shall there, embrace, Where Friends do never part. Which, now I mind, Methinks, I find Sweet hope, relieve my heart. 8 I feel it more, and more, My Soul of Comfort to assure. And, now, for ev'ry sore, I know, and feel, thou hast a Cure. For which my Tongue, Shall change her Song, Thy Goodnes to commend. And, thou art he Who, still, shalt be My best affected Friend. Hymn LXXXI. For Deliverance from Temptation. To be delivered from Temptation, is one of the six petitions in the Lord's Prayer, which we daily repeat; and therefore that God may deliver us from the evill thereof, we shall do well to invoke him by a speciall Jnvocation according as this Hymn putteth us in mind. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] How hard is it for Flesh and Blood, When Lusts the Heart assaile, To wish that Vice, may be withstood; And, Vertue, still prevaile! How hard is it, when we do burn, With evill-kindled Fires, Our Eies from Vanities to turn! Or quench our loose Desires? 2 So hard oh Lord! so hard it is; That few can truly say, They for thy timely ayd (in this) With true Devotion pray. But, rather, many are afraid, (When they to pray are mov'd) Lest by thy Grace, they should be staid, From Sins, too well belov'd. 3 Of this, if others have been free, Thy Mercy, let them blesse: For, that this fault hath been in me, I freely do confesse: And, (seeing better thoughts, I have) Occasion, thereupon, I, now, assume, thine ayd to crave, Before, this Mind be gon. 4 Thy Grace, oh Lord, in me did breed This motion, not in vain. Oh! let it be the blessed Seed Of an immortall Gain. And, Grant, that getting somwhat loose, From Sins imperious hand; My heart with willingnes, may chuse The wayes of thy Command. 5 From Sathans Baits, from Follies Lures, From ev'ry cause of Ill, Preserve me clean, whil'st life endures, In Action, and in Will. At least, when I shall tempted be, Protect thy Servant so, That, evill overcome not me; But, Victor let me grow. 6 Vaile then mine Eies, till She be past, When Folly tempts my sight: Keep thou my Pallet, and my Tast, From Gluttonous Delight. Stop thou mine Ear, from Syrens Songs: My Tongue from Lies restrain. Withhold my Hands, from doing wrongs; My Feet, from courses vain. 7 Teach, likewise, ev'ry other Sense, To Act an honest part; But, chiefly settle Jnnocence, And purenes in my Heart: So, nought without me, or within, Shall work an ill effect; By tempting me to act a Sin, Or, Vertues to neglect. Hymn LXXXVII. A Thanksgiving for the Gospell. The Gospell of Iesus Christ, is a meanes of the greatest Blessing, which was ever conferred on Mankinde. Therefore, that we might be more thankfull for it, then we have been heretofore, we are moved thereunto, by this Hymn. Sing this as the 10. Commandments. [1] Somtime, oh Lord! at least, in show, A thankfull heart, we do professe, When thou such Blessings dost bestow As outward Riches, Health, or Peace. But, for that meanes which may conduce Our Soules, to their true-Blisse, to raise, We make, not verie frequent use Of thankfull words, or Hymns of praise. 2 When Meads are drown'd, or Fields are dry; When Sword, or Sicknesse, harme hath done, To thee for help, sometimes we cry; And thank thee, when those plagues are gone. But, for that Blessed meanes of Grace, Which we have long, at full enjoy'd; (In publike, or in private place) Few Thankfull voices are employ'd. 3 How many soules, in Errors night, Sit sighing their sad hour's away! Whilst we enjoy, the Gospels light, And, therewithall, the wantons play! How many Nations be at strife, For that which we enjoy, at will? How many want that Bread of life, Which we do surfet on and spill? 4 Oh God! Forgive this crying Sin. More wise, more thankfull let us grow, To mend this fault, let us begin: And, Grace obtain, more Grace to show. For, Corne, and Wine, and Oyles increase; A Body-sound; a wittie-braine; A free Estate; an outward Peace; Without this Blessing, were in vaine. 5 They, who observe the same shall see, That, where these Tidings do not sound; (Or where they shall abused be) Inhumane cruelties abound: Yea, we, who often have been school'd, For hearing this blest Voice, in vaine, Shall see our hopes, and wisdomes fool'd; If unrepentant we remaine. 6 Our feares therfore Deare God! prevent; Keep thou thy Gospell in our Land: Our Thanklesnesse, let us repent; And stedfast in thy worship, stand. For, that thy blessed Saving-word, Is purely preached in our Daies We confesse it a mercie, Lord, Which merits, endlesse Hymns of praise. Hymn LXXXIII. For deliverance from persecution, and false Doctrine. The blind and bloody Times, in which our Fathers lived, begin to be forgotten, at least to be so little considered on, that some indeavour to make our deliverance from them, of little moment. To prevent therfore the curse likely to follow such unthankfulnesse, this briefe Hymn calls to mind that mercie. Sing this as the. 22. Psalme. [1] A time so cursed once was here, That, Error bore the sway; And would not let the Truth appeare, Her falshoods to gainsay. But whensoever, she was view'd Her purenesse to disclose; With Fire, and sword, she was pursu'd, By her malicious Foes. 2 By cruell and ungodly men, The Wells of Life, were hid; Or, by corruption poysned, then, Or, at the best forbid. And, they who took the greatest paine, To keep those Fountaines pure, Were either doomed to be slain Or thraldome to endure. 3 We praise thee, Lord, that freed thou hast This Land, from such a curse We praise thee that the dayes are past, Which those Things did inforce, And, humbly we, oh God, implore, Those plagues may not returne, Which vext this Nation heretofore, And made our Fathers mourne. 4 For Senslesnes of mercyes past Vnheeded ushers in, That Thanklesnesse, which brings, at last, Obduratnesse in sin. Then, doth Obduratenesse beget That damned, scornfull pride, Which will at naught, Gods mercy set; And, good-advise, deride. Hymn LXXXIIII. A Coronation Hymn. God is hereby glorified for the Kings exaltation, and implored to perfect his temporall dignitie, by making it, a step to his eternall Glory, and by keeping him a patron of Pietie and Vertue. [1] Lord, let thy pow'r protect the King; Make him his Trust on thee to place: Of thy large Favours let him sing; And, build his Glories, on thy Grace. Confirme him on the Royall-Seat, Whereto, advanced him thou hast; Let thy Salvation make him great; Vnto thy Truth, preserve him fast: And, make oh God! his earthly Throne, An earnest of a heavenly Crowne. 2 Him, over us, for Good, appoint; Ground all his Lawes, on Truth-divine: Let thy good Spirit him anoint; And, his Commands, conforme to Thine. Of Soveraigntie, give him the Globe: Of Peace, let him the Scepter bear: Make Holinesse, his royall Robe: The wreathes of Iustice, let him wear: And in upright, and pious waies, Observe, and serve thee, all his dayes. 3 Him, honour so; and him so crown; Him, so invest; and him so arme: Him, so anoint,; him, so inthrone; And by thy word, him so informe: That to thy Glorie, he may Raigne; To his content, and for our peace: That wickednesse he may restraine, To virtuous Pieties encrease: And, that our King, oh Lord! and we May to each other, Blessings be. Hymn LXXXV. A Funerall Song. This Hymn is intended to comfort the living, (whose Friends are deceased) by putting them in mind of the Resurrection, and of the happie Rest of those who die in the Faith of Christ. Sing this as the 10. Commandments. [1] Forbear to shed excessive tears, Or mourne, as hopelesse Heathens do: For though this Body lost appears, Assured be, it is not so, For, that which now, corrupting lies, In incorruption, shall arise. 2 I am the Life (our Saviour saith) The Resurrection, is through me; And whosoer'e in me hath Faith, Shall live againe, though dead he be: For, no man shall, for ever die; Who doth upon my word relie. 3 He that Redeemed me, doth live. (By Faith, I know that this is true) My God, this Body shall revive; And in my Flesh, I shall him view. Ev'n these mine eyes; these eyes of mine, Shall see his glory brightly shine. 4 We to the world do naked come, We back again unclothed go, And, it is God, alone, by whom We poore are made, or wealthy grow. And, we ascribe unto his name, Pow'r, praise, and glory, for the same. 5 From Heav'n, a Voice came down to me, And, this it will'd me to record; From this time forward Blessed be The Dead departing in the Lord. For, (as the Spirit hath exprest) They, from their Labours, are at rest. Hymn LXXXVI. When a Soul is newly departed. This Hymn comforts us in the death of our friends by offering to consideration the Miseries of this Life, and the happinesse of the next. God is hereby praised also, for calling the Soul departed from this wretched Being; and besought to hasten the accomplishment of our felicity by the generall Resurrection. Sing this as the 23. Psalme. [1] If Joy be made, when men are born, To live on earth below, Why should we vainly weep and mourn, When up to Heav'n they go? To Pains and Griefs, they hither come; And when they hence are gone, Those Troubles they are eased from, Which here they did bemone. 2 Impris'ned in a Living Grave, The Soul, departed, lay: And, ease or quiet, could not have, Till call'd it was away. But, we, now, hope it is at rest, In Him, from whom it came; And, of eternall Joyes possest: For which we praise his Name. 3 We praise thee, for that Being, Lord, And for that means of grace, Which to that Soul thou didst afford, In this inferiour place. And, we, moreover, praise thee, now, That, thou hast set it free, From those Afflictions which below, Avoided cannot be. 4 Oh Lord! be speedy to collect, And hasten, full to make The number of the Souls Elect, That shall of Blisse partake. That we and they, who in thy Fear, And Faith, have liv'd and di'de; In Soul and Body, may appear Where thou art Glorifi'd. Hymn LXXXVII. A Hymn of Instruction for Youth. This is a pious Descant upon the 12. Chap. of Ecclesiastes, and wherein the young man is put in mind to Remember his Creator, before decrepit Age disables him: It offers to consideration the vanity and Transitorinesse of the Beauty, Strength, and Pleasure, wherein youth delights. [1] To those that in Folly, Their youth do mispend, And mind not their Maker Till life shall have end; A Song Instruction, We now have begun, To warn them, and learn them, Destruction to shun. Lord, send them, to mend them, The gift of thy Grace; And Reason, to season A Reasonlesse Race. 2 Thou Yongling, whose glories, And Beauties, appear Like Sun-shine, or Blossomes, In Spring of the year; Whose vigorous Body, Whose Courage, and Wit, Are Jolly, and wholly Vnperished, yet; Come neer me, and hear me Things future foretell; Then, learn thou, Discern thou, The way to do well. 3 Misspend not a Morning So lovely, so faire, A moment may rarest Perfections impaire. The Noon-tide of Life-time, Yeelds little delight; And, Sorrow, on Sorrow, May follow ere Night. Receive then, Believe then, What now I declare; Attend me, and lend me A diligent ear. 4 Thy Beauties, and Features, That grace thee this day, To morrow, may perish, And vanish away. Thy Riches, and Pleasures, Now precious to Thee, My leave thee, deceive thee, And comfortles be. Now come then; oh, Come then! And learn to eschew Those Errors, and Terrors, Which else may ensue. 5 Thy Joints are yet nimble, Thy Sinewes unslack; Thy Marrow unwasted, Yet, strengthens thy back. Youth! keepeth Diseases From crazing thy Brain; Blood rilleth and swelleth, In every vein. Imploy then, enjoy then This vigour of thine, In willing, fulfilling, What God shall injoin. 6 Believe me, it will not For ever be so. Thy sturdy Supporters, Will staggering go. Thy Shoulders well shaped, And strong enough now, Vncomely, and homely, And weaker will grow. Then lengthen, and strengthen, Thy gifts by right use; Possessing each Blessing, Still, free from abuse. 7 Thy Beautifull Forehead Whereon we may view, Neat smoothnes and whitenes, Enamel'd with blew, Shall change that perfection Which youth yet maintains, To sallownes, hallownes, Wrinckles and Stains. Thy liking, and seeking Then, learn to bestow On Pleasures, and Treasures, That perish not so. 8 Thine Eares are now list'ning For Heaven on Earth, And, nothing will please them But Musick and Mirth. And, to thy Corruption No Passage, or Strain, Seems better, or sweeter, Then that which is vain. Oh ! borrow from sorrow, Some penitent dew; Lest, after much laughter, More Sadnes ensue. 9 Those Tresses, whose curling Thy Temples adornes, Will Hassocks resemble In winterly mornes. And, where fresh Vermilion Is mixed with Snow, A sallow, and yellow Complexion will flow. The fuller the Colour, The fouler the Stain. Then boast not; and trust not In things that are vain. 10 Thine Eies, whose bright sparklings, Thy Lovers admire, (And, which with vain longings Set thousands on fire) Shall closed in darknes Vnusefull remain; And, never for ever, See day-light again. Then mind thou, oh mind thou Thy Maker above: Observe him, and serve him If safety thou love. 11 Thy Mouth, whose fair portall Both wears, and incloses The colour and sweetnes Of Rubies and Roses, Shall so be transformed, That no man will care, Perceive, or believe, What perfection was there. Vain Creature, thy feature Then value not so, Take pleasure, in measure, As wisdome will do. 12 Thy Teeth, that stand firmly Like Pearles on a Row, Will rotten, and scatter'd, Disorderly grow. Thy Lips, whose neat motions, Great wonders have wrought; Shall slaver, and quaver, And, lothsome be thought. Then, ever endeavor Those things to eschew; Whence, nothing, but lothing, At last, will ensue. 13 Thy Fancie, that sings thee Vain Dreams of delight; Hereafter, will bring thee A comfortlesse night: And, thou, who yet heedst not How Time, comes, or goes. (With care) wilt give ear, To each Cockrell that crowes. Thy leasure in pleasure, Then do not misspend; Foreslowing, well-doing, Till Time hath an end. 14 Then, Thou who to thousands Do'st gracious appear, To no man shalt either Be welcome or dear. Which, when thou perceivest, Thy Life, unto Thee Vnpeacefull, diseasefull, And lothsome will be. No pow'r of our, This Judgement can shun; Till duly, and truly Our Duties be done. 15 Thy Lusts, and thy Pleasures, (Yet, hard to forgoe) Will leave thee, and leave thee, In sorrow and woe. And, then, in what pleasure Content canst thou have? Of what Rest, be possest, But a desolate Grave? Youths Folly, unholy Learn, therefore, to shun, And ever persever In what should be done. 16 For, when this Lifes vapours Are breathed away, Thy Flesh, new so cherish'd Will rot into clay. And, thy best beloved Thy Body may throw, Where none, thereupon, Compassion bestow. Then, leaving, deceiving Contentments to tast, Prevent and Repent What affected thou hast. 17 A worse thing remaineth, Then, yet, hath been said; If reall Amendment Too long be delai'd. The pains which hereafter, On Sinners attend, Last ever, and ever, And, never have end. Then approving, and loving, The Truth, I have sung, Remember thy Maker, Ev'n whil'st thou art yong. Hymn LXXXVIII. For our Benefactors. We are hereby put in mind to consider why God is otherwhile pleased to make us beholding to the charity of other men for necessary things; and God is here praysed also for this providence, and prayed to reward our Benefactors. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] VVhen we have all things of our own, Whereby our Wants may be suppli'd; Much carelesnes is often shown, And, far lesse thankfulnes then pride. More humble, therefore, me to make; (And that I more discreet may grow) Things needfull, I somtimes do lack, Till others them on me bestow. 2 And when my temper, Lord, I heed, (Though Flesh and Blood thereat repine) I find that I did greatly need This loving providence of thine. Yea, peradventure, if lesse poore, In outward things I had been made; I, other waies, had wanted more, And much lesse comfort might have had. 3 I thank thee, therefore, that my share, Thou hast committed to their Trust, Who so good husbands of it are, And, in their Stewardship so just. Preserve them, Lord, for ever such; And, as my Comforters they be, So, when they need, be thou as much To them, as they have been to me. 4 Their liberality repay With such endowments of the mind, And such Contentments, ev'ry way, That, they true Blessednes may find. And, Lord, of thine especiall grace, This, pleased be, likewise to grant; That, I in Vertues, may possesse, What, I in things-externall, want. Hymn LXXXIX. A Hymn against Pride. Pride is one of the spirituall-wickednesses, which aspires to high-places; and is most dangerous, because it usually enters when the house is cleansed from the grosser corruptions that pollute the Flesh. If this Charme be not strong enough to expell it, use Prayer and Fasting. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] Beware my Heart, thou cherish not This high aspiring Sin, By which that Devill was begot, Who brought all mischiefs in. For, first by Pride those Angels fell, Who (not with Heav'n content) Inhabit, now the Depths of Hell, By Justice, thither sent. 2 Lord, thou thy self didst them oppose, Who lofty-minded be. Profest thou art, a Foe to those, And, they are Foes to thee. Their Pride, therefore, thou do'st abase, Their Plumes thou pullest down: And set'st the humble in that place From which their Pride is thrown. 3 My God! possession of my heart, If this foul Fiend hath gain'd, (Which I much fear he hath in part, Through my default obtain'd) Displace him thence, and let that Room, Be hallow'd so by Thee, That, he no more may thither come, Nor any such as he. Hymn XC. Against Feare. Feare, is a Passion, which being moderated, is very necessary: And if it exceed the meane, becomes a Plague depriving of many Comforts; and beginning our miseries before their time. This Hymn therefore acquaints us with the nature of this Passion, and imploreth assistance against the same. Sing this as the 25. Psalme. [1] Dve Fear, becomes us well; And God ordain'd the same To be a faithfull Sentinell, To watch what perils came. A Heart, that feels no Fear Lies ope to many harmes; And, they that over-fearfull are, Are kil'd by false Alarm's. 2 Lord, be thou pleas'd, therefore, My Heart to temper so, That, I may fear, nor lesse, nor more, Then wise men ought to do. So (being nor amaz'd, Nor dull, through want of Sense) Nought shall omitted be, or caus'd, To hinder my Defence. 3 By false, and servile Fear, Afflictions we begin Before their time; and mischiefs rear, Which else had never bin. Yea, what might wear away, Or, be with ease endur'd; Growes thereby, more then beare we may, And, hardly to be cur'd. 4 For, when the heart of Man Is, once thereby possest, No mortall Pow'r expell it can, Or give that Party rest. Thy Pow'r, oh Lord above, Can from this Tirant save; That, me therefore, he ceaze not on, Thine Aid, alone, I crave. Hymn XCI. Against Despaire. Sometime good Christians (though not overcome of such an evill) are strongly tempted unto Despaire. Therefore, that such as feel any motions, this way, may be warned and assisted, to resist the Devill in his first attempts, inclining to this hellish Passion; We prepared this Hymn. Sing this as Te Deum. [1] What hellish Doubt! what cursed Fear, Is that which now begins, Vnto my Conscience to appear? And threats me for my Sins? In me methinks I somwhat feel, My heart, oppressing so, That Faith and Hope begin to reel, And faint my Spirits grow. 2 Assist me, Lord! for I perceive My Ghostly-Foe intends Of that Assurance to bereave, Whereon my Soul depends. He whispers to my troubled mind, Suggestions of Despaire; And, sayes, I shall no mercy find, Though I to thee repair. 3 But all untruth in him is found, And Truth it selfe doth say; That, Thou in Mercy dost abound And heareft those that pray. Oh ! hear me, Lord! oh hear me now, And (since my God, thou art) Against Despaire, enable Thou, My much oppressed heart. 4 Say to my Soul, thou art her Friend, Her Comfort, and her Aide. From those Distresses me defend, Which make me now afraid. For, weake, and sick, and faint, alas! My Faith begins to be; And LORD, without thy saving-grace, There is no hope for me. 5 My Sinns before my face appear, In their most lothsome Dresse, My Conscience tells me when, and where, And how I did transgresse. Thy Law declares, what for my sins, Thy Justice did foredoome; And, Sathan layes a thousand Gins, That snar'd, I may become. 6 That Hell which in my soule I find, Is to my friends unknowne. The world her owne affaires doth mind And leaves me oft alone; And, but that I to Thee, as yet, Remember to repaire. My Passions would in me beget A mercilesse Despaire. 7 Preserve, oh Lord! preserve in me, (And all men, thus opprest) A hopefull heart to seek from thee, Our much desired Rest. And, still, when Satan snares doth lay, To work our overthrow, Still, frustrate what he doth assay; And, stronger make us grow. Hymn XCII. VVhen Oppressors and wicked men flourish. Many Godly men (as was David) are much troubled and offended to see Tyrants and wicked persons prosper in the world, to the oppressing of Innocents, &amp;c. Therefore this Hymn is provided to comfort such; and to preserve them patient in times of Oppression. [1] My heart, why art thou sad? VVhy art thou pierced thorow? And wherefore art thou Joylesse made, By causelesse Fear and Sorrow? Or why should'st thou repine, (As helplesse, and unblessed) Because in Honours Orbe, they shine, By whom thou art oppressed? 2 What though thou hast perceiv'd That Ryot, Pride, and Folly, Have of their needfull dues bereav'd Endevours Good, and Holy? And, what though thou observe Vnworthy men ennobled? When they which better things deserve, Are for well-doing troubled? 3 Thereat, repine thou not; Nor this vain Fancie cherish; That Righteousnes, is quite forgot, Because the wicked flourish. But, with a constant mind, In doing-well persever; And, profit, thou, e're long shalt find In thy upright endeavour. 4 The Righteous for a space, By troubles are depressed; That, so the precious Fruits of Grace, May be the more increased. And, carnall men obtain, The Portions they have chused; That, they, at last, may know with pain, What Blessings they refused. 5 To seek, thou shalt not need, By searching Times preceding, Or ghesse what will on them succeed, By hear-say, or by Reading: For, if thou patient be, By Sight shall proof be gained, In more, then One, or Two, or Three) What is for such ordain'd. 6 Perdition, they bestride; Yet can they not perceive it: Therefore, Good-Counsell they deride, And, injure them who give it. For which, ev'n in their height, Of Glories, and of Pow'r, They see their Hope, destroyed quite, And perish't in one hou'r. 7 This day (like Phar'ohs Hoast: (Poore harmles men pursuing) Of their large pow'rs they proudly boast, No sign of terror shewing. Anon (with fear enough) They feel their kingdome falling. Their Plumes, and Charriot-Wheels fly off, And, they in mud, are sprawling. 8 Then, vexe no more my heart, Because a Tyrant thriveth. And, that whil'st thou oppressed art, Thy Foe, in Honour liveth. But, thine own waies observe; And, so let them be fram'd, That whatsoever some deserve, We may remain unblam'd. 9 For what will it availe In Courses to persever; Whereby men Joy but for a while, And then lament for ever? Or, why should he complaine Who, for a scratch, procureth That health and saftie to obtaine, Which evermore endureth? Hymn XCIII. For remission of a particular Sin. This penitentiall-Ode expresseth a hearty and passionate sorrow, for a particular sin, with an humble, and earnest desire of pardon; and is offred to help stirre up those affections, when occasion is offred. [1] Oh Lord! in sorrow and Distresse, To thee, I now draw neer; My late offences to confesse, In humble hope, and fear. Mine Errors, With Terrors, Perplexe, And vexe Me so That, to Thee Or, fro Thee, I know Not how To go. 2 But, having heard, and often found, That, thou art he, in whom Compassion, alwaies doth abound; To sue for Grace, I come. Nor chide thou, Nor hide thou, Thy face Or Grace From me. But, hear me, And clear me; Now I Thus cry To thee. 3 Till fully pleas'd with me thou art; And till I may obtaine A Look to re-assure my heart, That, thou art pleas'd again: Nor Treasure, Nor pleasure, Will ease Or please Me more. But, double The Trouble, Which made Me sad Before. 4 What needst Thou Lord, prolong thy wrath, To barr me of my Rest? Enough, a guiltie conscience hath, My Torments to encrease. It smites me, It frights me, Oh Lord, Afforde Releefe. Releeve me; And, give me Thy peace, To cease My Griefe. 5 I have too often heretofore, Been many wayes to blame; And, have obtained, evermore, Remission for the same. Yea, wholly, And fully, Thou hast Releast My Sin; When blamed, And shamed, I might (By right) Have bin. 6 Yet Lord, Forgive; forgive againe, Though I unworthy be: For, Mercy doth to thee pertaine, As much as wrath to me. Remit thou, Forget thou My crime, This time, Therfore. The greater The debter Thy praise Hee'l raise The more. Hymn XCIIII. For Remission of sin in generall. This Hymn is a brief confession of sin, and a prayer for pardon for the same. And it was prepared, to assist their devotion who need such helps; and to be a Remembrancer to those who need them not. Sing this as the .22. Psalme. [1] How many Lord! how foule! how great! Do my offences grow? How have I multipli'd the debt, Which unto Thee I owe? Though ev'ry day thou dost forgive, And wipe great Summs away, Yet, ev'ry day, I do perceive New Summs, new Scores to pay. 2 A Debt my Parents left on me, Which (far) my Stock exceeds: And, though it pardned were by Thee, Much Trouble, still, it breeds. For, thence, my flesh occasion takes, That Fancies to admit; Which, of those Longings, guiltie makes, That Active-Sins, beget. 3 And, when a Sin is once begun, That sin brings others on, The punishments or shame, to shun, Which follow'd thereupon: Till so encreast Offences are, And, Grace defaced so That we have neither Shame nor Fear, Nor sense, of what we do. 4 Lord, that my Sins may never come, To this accursed height; And, at the last, exclude me from Thy Grace, and Favour, quite I come to Thee (while Time I have, And Leave, and heart to pray) Discharge, for all those faults to crave, Wherein I walke astray. 5 By nature, so unsound, and base, My State; my Tenures be; That, for a new estate of Grace, I, now, petition Thee. Ev'n that which my Redeemer bought; And sealed with his Blood. For though my other Deeds be nought, This Deed, I know, is good. 6 This Deed I plead; and by this Deed, Would that Estate renew, Which through my Deeds, is forfeited, Vnlesse, Thou Favour shew. Lord, now, and whensoe're I shall Plead, what is mention'd now: With a Release of Errors, all, My Plea, do thou allow. 7 I guilty am, of many Crimes, Which I did fore-intend: And, twenty thousand, Thousand Times, I heedlesly offend: But, since my self I do condemn, And seek my Peace in Thee; Oh! let compassion cover them, That, they condemn not me. 8 Blot all my Sins out of the Book, By my Accusers writ. Vpon my Follies do not look; My youthfull Crimes remit. My publike Faults remember not; My Secret Failings, hide: And, let not Mercy be forgot, Thy Servant, though thou chide. 9 Yea, though small feeling of my Sins, My Fleshly-Nature hath, Till she by some event begins To feel, or fear thy wrath: Yet, since, in Spirit, I am still Lamenting for the same, Impute not unto me that Ill, For which, I merit blame. Hymn. XCV. Against the World, the Flesh, and the Devill, This Hymn craveth assistance against the VVorld, the Flesh, and the Devill, our most pernitious Adversaries: And perhaps the devout use thereof may be a means to make us become so heedfull of their Natures, that their Temptations may be the better avoided. Sing this as Te Deum. [1] Blest Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, One God, in Persons-three, VVhat is there, whereof man can boast? Except thy Love it be? And, save this Anti-trinitie, The World, the Flesh, the Devill, VVhat Foe, on our Humanitie, Hath pow'r to bring an Evill? 2 Those, though on them, three Names they take (And, things Distinct appear) Do but one Perfect-evill make, And, Fellow-workers are. For, take but One of them away, And, then, the other two, Accomplish not, what else, they may By their damn'd-Vnion, do. 3 To curb the Flesh, and to controule The World, and all things there, Was no great hardship to the Soul, Till Satan did appear. Yea, Satan, and the World had plaid Their pranks on Man, in vain; Had they not by his Flesh assaid, Their purpose to obtain. 4 Without that wanton Dalilah, (Our nearest dearest kin) Their Cunning is not worth a Straw, Their hoped prize to win. And, if she may, by Grace, be brought Her Falshoods to repent, The other two, shall harme us nought, What ever they invent. 5 Lord, Arme us by thy Triple-pow'r; So charme us by thy Grace; So watch their practise ev'ry hou'r, (In ev'ry secret place) That, they may no Advantage have To take us in their Gin; To fright, to mischief, or deceive, By tempting us to Sin. 6 The World reform, the Devill restrain, The Flesh so mortifie; That, we the Blisse may re-obtain, From which, they put us by. Let not our Frailties, or the Spight Of our malicious Foe, Act more against us, then thy Might, And Love, shall for us do. 7 But, since that Grace from thee proceeds, Which doth renew our Will; Lord, ripen it, into those Deeds, Which thy Commands fulfill. At least, let this our Willingnes, Accepted be so well; That, thy Imputed-Righteousnes, Our Failings may conceal. Hymn XCVI. Against Sin, and the first suggestions thereunto. This Hymn putteth us in mind to kill the Cocatrice in the Egge, and not to give willing way to the least appearances, or beginnings of evill, lest, an unresistable Deluge of Sin, break in upon us. Sing this as the former. [1] Take heed, my Heart, how thou let in, (With approbation or Delight) The first Suggestions unto Sin, Or, count the smallest Error, sleight. For, Entrance if that any shall Vnto those Vipers heads permit; (Without perchance) their Bodies all Soon after, in, with ease will get. 2 If Avarice begin to sprout, (Though first it crave but needfull things) The Root and Branch it will put out, From whence all Sin, and mischief springs. And, they who, at the first, had thought A Competence alone to crave; To vast Desires, at last are brought: And, know not when enough they have. 3 With wanton Thoughts, if thou shalt play, (Though thou as Good as David art) Adulteries, and Murthers, may Obtain possession of thy heart. For, Lustfull-musings will proceed To words-unclean; and they do soon Alure to ev'ry lothsome Deed, Which by Vnchastity is done. 4 If Sloth begin on us to ceaze, At first, perhaps, it will pretend, But to desire, a needfull ease, The tired Body to befriend. Yet, if unheedfull we shall grow, We peradventure, may e're long, Or lose, or hide, or misbestow, Our Talents, to our Masters wrong. 5 Moreover, if we take not care Aright, our Liberties to use; The Creatures, which our hearts may chear, We, to our mischief shall abuse. For, he whose Robes are alwaies gay, Doth probably oppresse the more; And, He that feasteth ev'ry day, VVill give but little to the poore. 6 VVhen to be Froward, we begin, A slender fault we reckon that: Yet, Anger thereby, enters in; And, somtime Anger lets in Hate. From Hate, we quickly do commence, Maliciously inclin'd to be; And, may become, by that offence, Offenders, in the high'st Degree. 7 If we our Brethrens gifts envy, We may (as Josephs brethren did) Our own Indowments lose thereby: And, from bad things, to worse proceed. Yea, those Affections which restrain'd VVithin their Bounds Praise-worthy be, Let loose, or overslackly rain'd May by degrees, our mischief be. 8 Therefore, my Soul, fast, watch and pray, The Sins and Engines to avoid, VVhich to intrap thee, in the way Thine Adversary hath imploy'd. And take thou heed, thou let not in, VVith approbation, or delight, The first Allurements unto Sin; Or, count the smallest Error sleight. Hymn XCVII. When our Fancies affright us, with Illusions, or dreadfull Apparitions. Though few are disposed to sing, when they are terrified with fearfull Visions; yet, some have that Christian Stoutnesse: and they who attain not to it, may perhaps be strengthened by meditating this Charme, either amidst their Terrors, or before they appeare. [1] Blesse me, oh God! and be thou near To help me at this dreadfull hou'r. My Heart confirm against my Fear, And, guard me by thy Saving pow'r. I feel my Flesh begins to quake; But, thou my Spirit strengthned hast; My Heart in Thee doth Courage take; Vnto thy Grace, it cleaveth fast. Whereof, since I assured am, My Foe, thus charge I, in thy Name. 2 Foul Fiend avoid, and carry hence, Those vain Impostures, wherewithall Thou seekest to delude my Sense, And bring my Reason into thrall. The Father, Son, and Holy ghost, (One blessed God, in Persons three) Whose Favour, justly, thou hast lost, Commands thy absence, now by me. Depart, and for thy frightfull showes, Expresse his wrath unto his Foes. 3 By that great God, who did not scorn Our Nature; but the same hath took: By Him, that of a Maid was born; By Him, whose pow'r thy head hath broke: By Him, that for my Ransome di'de; By Him, that conquer'd Death, and Hell; By Him, who now is glorifi'd, Where all the blessed Holies dwell: By Him, I charge that thou forbear To Harm, or put my Heart in Fear. 4 Depart with all those Bug-bear Sighs, Whereby thou do'st abuse our Sense, Depart, with all the cursed Sleights, Whereby thou givest us offence. Depart, with all those craftie Gins, Whereby thy malice doth assay, To tempt us to those damned Sins, Which, to destruction, are the way. Depart thou to thy Heards of Swine; And, trouble thou, nor me, nor mine. Hymn XCVIII. For one that hears himself much praised. As Praise is a spurre to Vertue; so it may poyson us with pride, and puffe us up with selfe-conceit, if it be not warily and modestly entertained. Therefore, this Hymn, sheweth with what musings, we should prevent such effects, when we are commended. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] My Sins, and Follies, Lord, by thee, From others hidden are, That, such good words are spoke of me, As, now and then I hear: For sure if others knew me such, Such as my Self, I know; I should have bin disprais'd as much As I am praised, now. 2 By me, some Good, perhaps hath bin Perform'd in publike view: But, what corruptions are within, Asham'd I am to shew. My brutish Lusts, my secret Pride, My Follies, yet unshown; (Which from thy sight, I cannot hide) To others, are unknown. 3 The Praise, therefore, which I have heard Delights not so my mind, As those things make my heart afeard, Which in my self I find. And, I had rather to be blam'd, So I were blameles made, Then for much Vertue to be fam'd, When I no Vertues had. 4 Though Slanders to an Innocent, Sometimes do bitter grow, Their bitternes procures content, If clear himself he know. And when a vertuous man hath err'd; If prais'd himself, he hear, It makes him grieve, and more affeard, Then if he slandred were. 5 Lord, therefore, make my Heart upright, What e're my Deeds do seem; And, righteous rather, in thy sight; Then in the World's esteem: And, if ought good appear to be In any Act of mine; Let thankfulnes be found in me, And, all the praise be thine. Hymn XCIX. For one being Slandred. Herein the bitternesse of a slanderous Tongue is perfectly illustrated, and the party grieved is put in mind to whom he should seek for comfort; and by what means he may be best comforted in such an Affliction. Sing this as the former. [1] So sharp and bitter be the wrongs Which I do now, sustain By slandrous and malicious Tongues, That, needs I must complaine. The keenest Razour cuts not so: The Vipers poysned sting, If that it be compar'd thereto, Will seeme a harmlesse thing. 2 For, these can but the Body slay; The other (more to blame) Therewith, oft likewise, takes away, The life of honest Fame. Yea, many times it makes a Saint, Impatient to appear; And, in his Trials, almost faint, Their stinging words to hear. 3 How then oh God! how can I chuse, But fear, or faint out-right? When slandrous Tongues my name abuse Through malice, and despight? Since, though of that, I guiltlesse am, Which to my charge they lay; My Conscience finds I was to blame, As much, another way. 4 Lord, hide me from their bitter Tongues, Els, hidden let me be From mine own Self, and from the wrongs Which have been done by me. For, I confesse, that, now and then, (In earnest or in Jest) I utter things of other men, Not fit to be exprest. 5 Sometime, through lightnesse, I relate, What Love would not reveal; And pleased am, to here out that, Which Malice, loves to tell. Nay, more then once, or twice, (I fear) Through Envie, I have spoke, Invicious things, which doubtfull were, And, up, on Trust, were tooke. 6 Repay not Lord, my Guiltinesse, According to desart; Since, now, mine errors I confesse, With true repenting heart. But, let the slanders and disgrace, Which causelesse, He did bide, Who by no Sin defiled was; My Shame, and Follies hide. 7 So, by his meeke Example taught, And, by his Justice, clear'd; These Rumors I shall set at naught, Which I have greatly fear'd: And, rather labour to retain Vprightnesse, in my wayes, Then, care to take, what Fooles will fame; Or, what a Villain sayes. Hymn C. For one delivered from deserved Shame. Jt is not one of the least Mercies to be delivered from open Shame, as appears by those, who have heaped one Sin upon another, and at last laid violent hands on themselves, to avoid Shame. Therefore, we ought to be more thankfull for this Favour, and to remember us thereof, this Hymn is tendred. Sing this as the 25. Psalme. [1] Had not, oh Lord, thy Grace, Vouchsafe'd my Vaile to be, Shame and confusion of my Face, Had overwhelmed me. For, though thy Mercies hid The Follies, I have wrought; I do confesse, those things I did Which me to Shame had brought. 2 For, sometimes, all alone, Sometimes, with others, too Those wicked things, by me are done, Which few suspect I do. Nay, otherwhile, perchance, Of Crimes I guiltie am, Where by, my credit I advance, Whil'st others bear the blame. 3 Just cause have I to grieve That by my secret Sin, I those deceive, who do believe My hands have cleaner bin. And, though my Fault none know; Thereat I am so griev'd; That, I the Shame could undergo, From Guilt, to be repriev'd. 4 But, doubtles, to reveal What thou do'st overpasse; And, what thy Mercy doth conceal, Were to despise thy Grace. Therefore, I doe accept, (With meek, and thankfull heart) The Credit, thou for me hast kept, Beyond my due Desart. 5 And for thy Favour-sake Vouchsaf'd, in this to me; I will more heed, hereafter, take How, clear I ought to be. Oh! help me to fulfill, This purpose of my mind; And, though I fail to do thy Will, Lord, fail not to be kind. Hymn CI. For one whose Beautie is much praised. Beautie is a temporarie Blessing, which bringeth advantages and disadvantages, according to their disposition, who possesse it. Therefore this Hymn remembers those, who are beloved or commended, for that endowment; so to behave themselves that God may receive glory thereby, and that it may not become harmfull to themselves, or others. Sing this as the Magnificat. [1] I well perceive, that God hath limb'd My brittle Body, so, And, so my Face with Features trim'd, That, thanks, therefore, I owe: For, though my self to overprize, I, apt enough may be; Yet, what I am, (by others eies) I, somewhat rightly, see. 2 I do confesse, it cheeres my minde, That, I those Beauties have, Whereby my Self belov'd I finde, Where love, my heart would crave: And, I suspect the grief had been Too great for me to bear, Had I my self, so loathed seen, As, oft, my Betters are. 3 Therefore, my God! I were too blame. If Thee I praised not, For making me, the same I am; And, pleased with my Lot. It is no blessing of the least: Nor unbeseems it me That, thus in private, I confesse, What I receiv'd from Thee. 4 For Beautie, is an Oratour, Which pleads with so much grace, That, to prevaile, it hath a pow'r, Almost, in ev'ry place. It creeping through the Lovers eies, Takes prisoner, now and than, A greater, and a fairer prize, Then Wealth, and Wisdome can. 5 I boast of no such Braves as these; But, this I truly say, It makes me with more Joy, and ease, To passe my Youth away. And, yet, I know, tis but a Flowre, Now, faire to look upon; And, in the compasse of an houre, Defaced quite, and gone. 6 Lord, give me grace to prize it so, (And neither more nor lesse) As wisdome would; and hallow, too, The Features I possesse; That, I may minde how fraile, and thin, Those outward Beauties are, Which reach not half way through the skin; Nor long continue there. 7 My Reason, teach thou, to apply Her utmost pow'r, and wit, Mine Inside, so to beautifie, That, I thy love may get. Let me not proudly tirannize, Where I belov'd shall be; Nor those discomfort, or despise, Who lesse adorned be. 8 Let not my Beauties be a mean Mine own base Lusts to feed; Nor others tempt, to an unclean, Or an uncomely deed. But, make my Conversation such, Oh Lord! (I thee implore) That, they, who like my Beauty, much, May love my Vertues, more. 9 So, when my Fleshly Form doth fade, It shall not grieve my Heart, That, things, but for a season made, In their due Time depart. But, I shall rather joyfull grow, To feel my Soul put on That, which, will make a fairer show, Then Flesh and Blood have done. Hymn. CII. For one upbraided with Deformitie. To some this is a very great Affliction, and they who are sensible of other mens Passions, will not thinke it impertinently added; if this Hymn be inserted, to comfort such as are upbraided, or afflicted through their bodily defects, in this kind; and to instruct their Despisers. Sing this, as the former. [1] Lord, though I murmur not, at thee, For that in others Eies, I, so deformed, seem to be, That, me, they do despise: Yet, their contempt, and their disdain My heart afflicteth so, That for mine ease, I now complain, My secret grief, to show. 2 Thou know'st, oh God! it was not I, Who did this Bodie frame, On which they cast a scornfull eie; By whom I flouted am. Thou know'st likewise, it was not they, VVho did their Bodies make; Although on my defects to play, Occasions, oft they take. 3 Then, why should they have Love, or Fame, For what they have not done? Or, why should I have scorn or shame, For what I could not shun? Thy workmanship, I am, oh Lord, Though they do me deride: And, thou, by what they have abhorr'd, Are, some way, glorifide. 4 Therefore, since thou this way hast chose, To humble me on Earth. My Imperfections now dispose, To help my second Birth. Let me in Thee contentment find: And, lovely make thou me, By those perfections of the Mind, Which dearest are to Thee. 5 Since, Features none, in me appear, To win a fleshly Love; Let those, which priz'd by others are, My passions never move. But, quench thou, all those youthfull Fires, Which in my brest do burn; And, all my Lusts, and vain Desires, To sacred motions, turn. 6 So, though in secret grief, I spend The Life that nature gave; I, shall have comforts, in the end, And, gain a blessed Grave; From whence, the Flesh which now I wear, In glory, shall arise; And, fully beautifide appear, In all beholders eyes. Hymn CIII. For one Legally censured, whether justly or unjustly. This Hymn instructeth us to beare patiently our Legall Censures, whether justly or unjustly pronounced; because to Godward, we are alwaies offenders, though sometimes we are unjustly condemned by Men. Sing this as the 4 Psalme. [1] Why should my heart repine at those, By whom I censur'd am? Why should I take them as my Foes, By whom I suffer blame? Were they lesse Just, and, I more cleare, Yet, Righteous were my doome; Since, greater plagues deserved are, Then are upon me come. 2 If God should bring my secret Crimes, And all my faults to sight; My Censure doubled fortie times, Were fiftie times, too light. And, therefore, I with patience bear The pain upon me brought: And, will hereafter, more beware To do the things I ought. 3 For whether they who urg'd the Lawes, Vpright or partiall were, They are not, LORD, th'Efficient-cause, Of that, which I do bear. They are but Instruments for Thee, Thy righteous Will, to doe. I pardon Them. To them, and me, Vouchsafe thy pardon too. If the party be guilty, let this following verse be sung next after the second verse. Lord, I confesse, I have abus'd Thy Justice and thy grace; And, was deservedly accus'd, For what, condemn'd I was. Yet, since my Faults I do repent, Accepted let me be: And, having born the punishment, The Guilt forgive to me. If the party be guiltlesse, let this last verse be left out, and this repeated in stead thereof. I am not guiltie of the Deed For which accus'd I stood: Yet, of Correction I had need, And, this may do me good. Affliction is not sent in vain; Nor, causlesly begins; But, strives to keep off greater pains, Or, to prevent some Sins. Hymn CIIII. After a great Losse. We are hereby remembred to take our Losses patiently, considering that we deserve not thatwhich is left: and (trusting in-Gods providence and love) we leave all things to his good pleasure, without repining. Sing this as, In sad and Ashie weeds. [1] The Talents we possesse, By God's free bountie, we enjoy, And, he doth curse or blesse, As, Well, or Jll, we them imploy. He gives and takes, As best it makes To further his intents. And, to fulfill His blessed Will, Each faithfull Soul assents. 2 In part, I am bereft Of what his Love on me bestow'd: And, yet, in what is left, Great Favour, he to me hath show'd. For, if my Store Should be no more Then my deserts have been. One in distresse More comfortlesse, On earth should not be seen. 3 Which when my heart well weighs, There is no grudging in my mind: But, God I rather praise For what remaineth yet behind, Yea, though for all, He please to call, I'le freely let it go; And trust, that He (As need shall be) Will usefull things bestow. 4 Thus am I now enclin'd To me oh God! assistance grant, That, I may keep this mind, And, thee to friend, in ev'ry want. So, whether I, Sit low, or high, Or, shall be poore or Rich. It shall not keep Mine eie from sleep, Nor discontent me much. Hymn CV. For one that is promoted. We may be made heedfull, and kept mindfull, hereby, from whom Promotion commeth: to what end we should effect it; and with what humility, and thankfulnesse we should possesse it. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] By his Endeavours no man may His own Preferment make; Although, he both an Eastward-way, And Westward-Courses take: For, having used all his Art, His longings to obtain; His Pow'r, his Wisedome, and Desart, Imploy'd may be in vain. 2 Ev'n Kings, who are those Hils, from whom, Promotion seems to flow; And from whose Heights, most Honours come, To those that are below; Ev'n they, who (in supremest place) Preferments use to give; Can us, nor honour, or disgrace, Till God vouchsafes them leave. 3 That, therefore, in this Place, I am Whereto, I, late was rais'd; Who should, but God, from whom it came, For that, by me be prais'd? To whose renowne should I my Place, And new-got pow'r imploy? But unto His, by whose meer Grace, This Favour, I enjoy? 4 Lord, give me wit, both to perceive, And heed (all times) to take, That, I this Grace, did not receive, For mine own Vertue sake: Or, my Ambition to fulfill; But rather, that I might The better execute thy Will, In doing things upright. 5 Let not my heart be puft with pride; Or, brutishly forget By whom I have bin dignifi'd, And, on this height am set: But make me for it, ev'ry day, So thankfull unto Thee, That from things earthly climb I may, To those that heav'nly be. Hymn CVI. When our Hopes are obtained. When our Hopes are accomplished, we are well pleased thereby; and yet are seldome thankfull to him, by whom they are obtained; but ascribe overmuch to our owne wit or Industry. Therefore, to prevent that ingratitude and impiety, this Hymn is rendred. Sing this as the former. [1] My Hope; and those endeavours, now, Which I have us'd therein; Such good effects begin to show, As have expected bin, Therefore, my Thoughts, which many waies Were busie to that end, I recollect to sing his praise, Who did my Hopes befriend. 2 It was not mine own Strength, or Wit, Whereby the same I gain'd: Deservings, which may challenge it, I have not, yet attain'd. For, if my Ill-deserts were weigh'd, With what hath well bin done; The first would prove (I am afraid) More heavie, ten to One, 3 It is, oh Lord, of thy meer Grace, That, what I have desir'd, So happily effected was, And, in due time acquir'd. Since thou art pleas'd, it should be so; Be, likewise pleas'd in this; That, nothing which thou do'st bestow, May be emploi'd amisse. 4 And, as my Vertue did not win, What is conferr'd on me, So, let me not by any Sin, Thereof deprived be. But, whensoever, by Offence, I, Forfeits thereof make; Vouchsafe, to give me Penitence; And, me to Mercy take. Hymn CVII. When our Hopes and Endeavours are made void. This Hymn informeth, that when God frustrates our common and vain hopes, we should not be discouraged, but rather be thankfull for the comfort they were unto us when we had them; and learne to fixe our confidence and Hope on God only. Sing this as the former. [1] Although that Hope is frustrate made, Which lately flatter'd me; I have not lost the Hope I had; Oh Lord, my God in Thee. Nor were those Hopings quite in vain, Which now seem wholy void; For, while in me, they did remain, They kept my mind imploi'd. 2 By that likewise, which is bereft, I have this knowledge won, That many Comforts may be left, When, some one Hope is gone: And, that by Hopes, which profit most, Disprofits are acrew'd. (With great disquiet, pains and cost) If not aright pursu'd. 3 He that will chase with all his might, Each Hope, or new-Desire; Is like to Him, who in the Night Pursues a wandring-Fire. The last, is like to lose his way, (And happie, if no worse) The first, if so escape he may, Shall find an emptie purse. 4 Lord, grant me still (though few succeed) Some Hopes, my Heart to please: For, to have Hopes of what we need, Is, for the Time, an ease. Vouchsafe me Grace, to know how far, Such Hopes may trusted be. And wit likewise, to have a care, Their failings harm not me. 5 So, whether they succeed or not, This, will to passe be brought, That, still some profit will be got, Though, lesse then first I sought. And, by Degrees, I shall attain, To hope in thee, alone. Who makest no mans hopes in vain, If Thee he trust upon. Hymn CVIII. For Deliverance from private Danger. So many visible and invisible Dangers, we are daily liable unto, that without God's continuall protection, we could be not safe one minute. Therefore, that we may be remembred to be thankfull for our infinite Deliverances, this Hymn, is made a Remembrancer. Sing this as the former. [1] A thousand perils, ev'ry day, Ten thousand, ev'ry night, Are over us, and in our way, Which are not in our sight: And us, didst thou not Lord, inclose, And, for our safeties watch; Our Earthly, or our Hellish Foes, Our lives, would soon dispatch. 2 From one apparant perill now, I have bin lately freed. Because, compassion thou do'st show, In ev'ry time of need: For which (since I no Gift can bring More pleasing unto Thee) A Song of Praise, my Tongue shall sing; My Heart, shall thankfull be. 3 Oh! let thine Eie be still upon My purpose and my waies; Lest by my Foes I be undone; Or, by mine own Assayes. For, I confesse, that nothing needs To harme, or work me woe, Save mine own Follies, and the Deeds, Which, I my self, may do. Hymn CIX. When we are oppressed by extream Sorrow. When our Souls are much oppressed with Sorrow, we vainly seeke our Consolation in transitorie things; and they rather more enrage then asswage our Passion, we are hereby therefore, remembred by what means, and by whom, we shall best be comforted. Sing this as Te Deum. [1] My Soul, why do'st thou in my breast, With griefs afflicted grow? Why are my Thoughts, to my unrest, In me, increased so? And in thy Self, by musings vain, Why do'st thou seek for ease? Since, thou still more augment'st thy pain, By such like means as these? 2 When Passion hath enslav'd thy heart, Why seek'st thou Comfort there? When thou depriv'd of Reason art, What Reas'ning cureth Care? The more thy mind by musing thinks From Sorrow's Depths to rise; The further downward still it sinks; The nearer Hell, it lies. 3 Let therefore, hence with speed be thrown Those Thoughts, which thee attend. Before, they thither, presse thee down, Whence, no man can ascend. And let on Him, thy musings dwell Who (in meer love to Thee) Hath div'd the Depths of Death and Hell, That thou might'st eased be. 4 The Sorrowes, he sustain'd, were such, As no mans ever were. His weakest pang, had been to much, For strongest Hearts to bear. His bitter Passion, made him sweat, No lesse then drops of Blood: And, He, when Suff'rings were most great, Seem'd left of Man, and God. 5 Yet, was not He, as (Thou hast bin) The Cause, of his own woe: But, thy Transgression, and thy Sin, In Sorrow's plung'd him so. For shame, therefore bewail thou not The Scratch which thee hath pain'd, And leave those mortall wounds forgot, Which He for thee sustain'd. 6 If his Afflictions, thou shalt mind; Thy griefs, he will regard: And, ease and comfort, thou shalt find, At ev'ry need prepar'd. For, they who thus affected stand, And, cast their cares on him; Have his compassion still at hand, To help and succour them. 7 Sweet Iesu! for thy Passion sake, This Favour shew to me: Out of my heart, the Sorrowes take, Which therein raging be. My Passion calme; my Soul direct, Her thoughts, on Thee, to place: On my much troubled mind, reflect, The brightnes of thy Face. 8 Yea, let Contrition, for my Sin, So purge out carnall grief, That, Ioy-cœlestiall may bring in The fulnes of Relief. So, this my Sorrow shall but adde A relish to my Joy; And, cause contentments to be had, Which nothing can destroy. Hymn CX. For Deliverance from Sorrow. Gods Readinesse to afford Consolation to all that call on him faithfully in their Sorrowes, is here acknowledged. His Deliverance of us from a particular Sorrow, is here also confessed, to his praise; and he is prayed to vouchsafe us the Joyes of the holy-Ghost. Sing this as the former. [1] Experiment, I now have had, Of what I oft have heard; That such as over-night are sad, Next Morrow may be cheer'd. For, I that was with Grief opprest, And overcharged so, That, I had neither Hope, nor Rest, Light-hearted now do grow. 2 My drooping Soul, begins to find My comforts, to increase: Sweet Hopes have repossest my mind: From Teares, and Sighs, I cease. My mournfull Odes, to Hymns of Praise, Shall, therefore, changed be; And, I my voice, oh Lord, will raise, In thankfull Sounds, to Thee. 3 For, Thou hast Cures, for ev'ry Grief; Fit Salves for ev'ry pain: And, wilt vouchsafe them, due relief, Who shall to Thee complain. To me (who lately did lament) A comforter thou art; And, hast a cheerfull Spirit, sent Into my drooping Heart. 4 I wish'd for Death, and could perceive, In Life, no hope of ease: But, now content I am to live Whilst thou, oh Lord, shalt please. And in my Songs I will confesse, (Whilst I have Tongue to sing) That, all the comforts I possesse, From Thee, alone, do spring. 5 That this new-Joy, may not be lost, Those Joyes vouchsafe to me, Which flowing from the Holy-Ghost To all the Faithfull be. So, whatso'ere externall-Grief, My Pilgrimage attends; I shall within, feel that Relief In which, all Sorrow, ends. Hymn CXI. For them who are afflicted by the unkindnesses of their Friends. To them who are of a gentle nature, this is a very great Affliction; therefore, to comfort them who suffer by it; and to take advantage from unkindnesses suffered, to make them sensible of the greater unkindnesses which they offer to Him who suffred for us, this Hymn is prepared. Sing this as Te Deum. [1] Alas! my Heart, what meanest thou With Passion, thus to Ake? Thy Friends unkindnesse, wherefore, now, So sadly dost thou take? Oh! why afflictest thou thy minde, For their neglect of Thee; Since to thy Self, thou art lesse kinde, Then all thy Foes can be. 2 The Follies, which thy conscience knew, Thy ruine would effect; With greedinesse, thou dost pursue; And, safer waies, neglect. And when thy Lovers have advis'd, What, to thy weal pertains. Their kindnesse, thou hast oft despis'd; And scoft them, for their pains. 3 If they whom thou dost well esteeme Have ought unkindly done; Or, if but harsh their words do seem, Thy Case thou dost bemone. Yet, thou forgetst, that thou hast wrong'd Affection, far more true; And, One to whom more love belong'd, Then to all them, is due. 4 Thou hast a Friend, who from thy birth, To Thee hath faithfull been: A better never liv'd on Earth; Nor shall his Peer be seen. From vile estate, he raised thee To that which now thou art; And, by his Death did set thee free, When thou condemned wert. 5 To thee, great Favours he did shew, No other Meed to finde, But, that thy weal thou mightst pursue, And, to thy selfe, be kinde. To this intent, sweet words he said, And, thee, long time did woe; For thee he wept; and, thee, he pray'd Thy Self, not to undoe. 6 Yet, froward, thou to him dost prove, Who this Affection shews; Thy Heart, thy Longings, and thy Love Thou placest on his Foes. And, though he daily seek thy good, (Thy faults forgiving, still) Thou eat'st his Flesh, and drink'st his Blood, And, bear'st him small good will. 7 My God! if thus I be to blame (Which justly I suspect) No marvell if I grieved, am By those, whom I affect. For why should I from others, looke Firme Love, on earth to finde; Since all my vowes, I oft have broke, To one, so truly kinde? 8 Sweet Jesu let my flinty heart, More tender waxe to Thee. Of thy Afflictions, and thy smart, More feeling grant thou me. Yea, let my Friends unkindnesse bring, Those Griefs unto my minde, Which did thy heart, with sorrow sting, When Man did prove unkinde. 9 For, when that he who eat thy bread, Thy precious life betray'd: When all thy Servants from thee fled; When Peter thee denay'd; And, when thy Father hid his face, From Thee, in thy distresse: Ten thousand times more grief it was, Then Tongue shall ere expresse. 10 Lord, for that great Vnkindnesse sake, Which thou didst then sustaine, Those thoughts to me more easie make Which now my heart do pain, And, since Earths-best contentments be So bitter, to my Tast; Teach me, to fixe my heart on thee, Whose Love, still, firm, doth last. 11 For, if our hearts it almost breakes When friends do prove unkinde; What feeleth he, whom God forsakes? What comfort can he finde? Lord! that I never may bewaile This losse; thy Love, still daign; So, though all other Friendships faile, I shall not long complain. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The second Part, consisting of Hymns Temporary. Hymn I. For the Day-present, or the Last-Day. The last shall be first, and the first shall be last. For as the Day-present, is the first of those that are to come; So it is the last of those which are past; and, may be to us, the last Day of all. We have therefore, made it an occasion to remember us of that Last-Day, which no man shall escape. Sing this as the Lamentation. [1] So much who knows, that he can say His Last, this Minute, shall not be? Or, who can tell, but that this Day, Will be the last, his Eye shall see? And, therefore, how far off soe're, The Worlds Last-day from us we place, The morrow next, it will appear, To him, that hath fulfild his Race. And Sorrows Changes he shall Ring; Or Joyes, blest Halelviah, sing. 2 How dull, how blind! how mad therefore, Are we who now this Day enjoy, (And, are not sure of one day more) If we, this time, shall misemploy? If we God's Voice refuse to hear, Now, Vs he cals on, to repent: Anon, perhaps, we shall with fear, Beyond the sounds of Grace, be sent: To be confin'd, where damned-Soules, And Sathan, rages, Roares, and Howles. 3 If Daily, we in Sin waxe old; And ev'ry day grow more to blame; Our Judge how shall we then behold, When Heaven and Earth, are in a Flame? And, if our hearts, no pleasure takes, To heare him, when in Peace he comes, How shall we beare it, when he speaks, In wrath, our everlasting-Doomes. And, saies, in his inflamed Ire, Depart into unquenched Fire? 4 Lord, whilst this Day of Grace, doth shine; Whilst thou dost speak to us, in Love, So let us mark each Word of thine, That, Faithfull Hearers, we may prove. So let us walk; so let us work; Whilst this faire-Day-light, is possest, That, when Deaths Evening waxeth dark, Our Flesh, in Hope, may sweetly rest. Vntill that mortall Night be done; And Day immortall, is begun. 5 And, when, Times Vaile, is rent, away, (Whereby Eternitie is hid) When thou shalt all things, open lay, Which ere we Thought, or Said, or Did; Among Times Ruines, bury so, Our failings (through our Tract of Time) That, from these Dungeons, here below, We to celestiall Thrones may clime, And, there, to our Eternall-King; Forever, Halelviah sing. Hymn II. For the Lords Day, or Sunday. This Day God created the Light; and distinguished Day from Night. Vpon this Day of the week Christ rose from Death; and upon this day, sent down the Holy-Ghost upon his Disciples, &amp;c. and as upon this Day, God rested from the work of Regeneration; therefore the old Sabbath was translated to this Day, with every Dutie which is essentially, and not ceremonially pertaining thereunto. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] Great Lord of Time! great King of Heav'n! Since weekly thou renew'st my Daies, To Thee, shall daily Thanks be given, And, weekly Sacrifice of Praise. This Day, the Light, (Times eldest-born) Her glorious Beames, did first display: And, then, the Evening, and the Morn, Obtained first, the name of Day. 2 The Depth, with Darknesse, black empald, (That, out of which the World was made) And, which Deep-waters, thou hast cald, Vpon this Day, beginning had. And, as upon this Day, it was, On which Creation was begun, So, on this Day, thy Work of Grace, In ev'ry part, was fully done. 3 For, on this Day, thy Christ arose; And, Victor over Death, became. This Day he conquer'd all his Foes, And put them to perpetuall shame. Vpon this Day, it pleased thee, Thy Sacred Spirit down to send; That, men with Gifts might furnish'd be Vpon thy Gospel to attend. 4 This Day, therefore, we set apart, For holy Rest, and holy Rites; And, ev'ry sanctified Heart, To celebrate this Day delights. No common-works, thereto, belong; (Except much need requireth so) Nor will we in a Common-Song, Present the Service which we owe. 5 Therefore, that now to thee ô Lord! The fitter Offring, bring I may, Thus, to thine honour, I record, And sing the Blessings of this Day. So, let me sing; So, minde them, still, And, all my life, so thankfull be; That, when my Course I shall fulfill, Thy Grace may draw me up to Thee. 6 Discretion grant me so to know What Christian Sabbaths do require; And Grace my Dutie, so to do, That, I may keep thy Law, intire. Not doing, what should not be done; Not things omitting which are due; Nor overburdning any One, With Sabbath-Rites, unjust or new. 7 Yea, let me rest my Body so, That to my Soul I do no wrongs; Nor in Devotion heedlesse grow, What to my Bodies Rest belongs. But both in Soul and Body, Lord, Let me so sanctifie this day, According to thy holy Word, That I may Rest in Thee, for aye. Hymn III. For Munday. On Munday, God made the Aierie Firmament, whereby Mankind, and every living Creature upon Earth enjoyeth, all the common Benefits of Nature; and which this Hymn partly commemorateth to the praise of God, for his Mercifull Providence in this Daies-work. Sing this, as the former. [1] This Morning brings to minde ô God! The Making of that Aierie-Spheare, And Spreading of that Skie abroad, Whereby we now Surrounded are. It was that Fabrick which thy hand, Vouchsafed, on this Day to frame, To bound the waters under land, From those which are above the same. 2 This Aierie-Firmament, both keeps All breathing-creatures, here below, From suffocation by those Deeps; And meanes of Breathing, doth bestow. To us, this Firmament convayes Those Dewes and Show'rs, which oft we need; And all those pleasant summer-dayes, Whence profits, or delights proceed. 3 Yea, by this Firmament, we gain The vision of refreshing Light, And thereby do as well obtain The use of Hearing as of Sight. For this dayes workmanship ô Lord, I praise thee now; and humbly pray That I may thankfully record, Thy dayly-Blessings ev'ry day. Hymn IIII. For Tuesday. God is magnified in this Hymn for separating the Land from the Waters, &amp; for graciously furnishing the earth with hearbs and Trees for Mans use For this was that work whereby God manifested his Power and Providence upon this day of the first-week. Sing this as Te Deum. [1] When Land and Sea that mixed were, In one confused Masse, Did first distinguished appeare, As on this Day it was; A creature usefull, then began The waters, first, to be. And, then, a dwelling fit for man, The Land was made by Thee. 2 Thou didst, likewise, the Ground command, All fruitfull Trees to breed. And, cause to spring out of the Land, Each Hearb that beareth seed. The profit which arises thence, On Man thou didst bestow; And, he hath reaped, ever since, The fruits that yearely grow. 3 This Day, therefore, thou praised art, For thy Preparing-Grace, In setting Land, and Sea apart, To give us dwelling-place. For what the Garden, or the Field, Doth for our use afford; And, for what Woods, or Orchards yeeld, I praise thee too ô Lord! 4 And, Lord, I pray thee, since the Land, Is fruitfull still to mee; And faithfull unto thy command, Let me be so to Thee. Yea, since those works are all confest Right good, which thou hast wrought, By me, let one Good work, at least, This Day, to passe be brought. Hymn V. For Wednesday. The Heavens were upon this day first adorned with Stars, and with those two great Luminaries whereby Dayes and Nights, Times and Seasons are guided and Distinguished. And, to praise God for these, and for those many blessings of Pleasure, Profit, and Conveniencie, thereby enjoyed; this Hymn was composed. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] This Day, the Planets in their Spheares, And those faire Stars, which night by night, Have shin'd so many thousand yeares, Receiv'd their Beeing, and their Light. Vpon this day were first begun Those Motions Lord, by which we know, How Dayes do passe, how yeers do run; And, how the Seasons come and go. 2 The Sun was then ordain'd by Thee To rule the Day; and give it light. The Moon and Stars were made to be The Guides and Comforts of the Night. For These, therefore, thy Praise I sing; And, for the blessings, which to Man, The Sun, the Moon, or Stars do bring; Or brought, since first, the World began. 3 For enterchange of Nights and Daies; For Winter, Summer, Spring and Fall. For all of these, I give thee Praise; For, Thou gav'st Beeing to them all. When Sun, or Moon, or Star I view, Let them, so make me think on Thee; That, as Daies, weeks, and yeers renew; I may renew my Thanks to Thee. Hymn VI. For Thursday. The Waters upon this day of the first week were made fruitfull in Fish and Fowle, for an Addition to Mans profit. Vpon this day, our blessed Redeemer, began his most bitter Passion for our sins. This Day he instituted the Sacrament of his Last-Supper: promised the Holy-Ghost our Comforter; prayed for us; uttered many divine Precepts, Counsels, and Caveats for the Instruction and Consolation of his Church; all which are here commemorated. Sing this as the 22. Psalme. [1] Lord! that, there might no vacant-place, In all this world be found; But, that the Riches of thy Grace, Might ev'ry where abound. This Day, the Waters had command, Both Fish and Fowle to breed; That, Sea, and Aire, as well as Land, Might help in time of need. 2 And, as if all these Dainties, Lord! For us, too little were, Which Land, and Sea, and Aire afford, Enlarg'd, thy Bounties are. For, as upon this Day (oh Christ) Thou gav'st thy selfe, to be The Bread of Life, to ev'ry Guest, That shall beleeve in Thee. 3 Thy Promise on this day, was made The Holy-Ghost to send. This Day we many counsells had, From Thee, our Blessed-Friend. The Evening, likewise of this Day, Began thy Bloodie sweat, And, Thee, that night, he did betray, Who feasted on thy meat. 4 Therefore in ev'ry week of Dayes, I just Occasions find, Thee for this fifth Daies works to praise; And keep the same in mind. Lord, let me alwaies mindfull be To praise thee to my pow'r; Since I have cause to think on Thee, And thank Thee ev'ry how'r. Hymn VII. For Fryday. The Beasts of the Earth, and all creeping Things were made upon this Day. Mankind, this day, received being from the dust of the Earth; and upon this day of the weeke, the Son of God suffred on the Crosse for our Salvation; all which are to Gods glory, commemorated in this Hymn. Sing this as the Lamentation. [1] The sixth Daies Light may weekly bring, Such things of moment, still to mind; That, Hymns and Songs of Praise to sing, I many just Occasions find. For, ev'ry little worme I see, And, ev'ry Beast, I looke upon, Remembrances are made to mee, Of that which on this day was done. 2 As on this Day, these, first were made. As on this very day, likewise, That Root, whence I my Being had, Out of the Dust, did first arise. And (though our Grandame was the same, Which Beasts, and Wormes to light did bring) Man, by Gods grace, this Day, became Chief Lord of each created thing. 3 This Day, moreover, when by Sin, Possessions, Honours, Life, and all, For ever, Forfeited had bin, God, had compassion on our Fall. And, that we might not be undone (Without all hope to cure our losse) Vpon this Day, his onely Son, Did suffer for us, on the Crosse. 4 This Day, the Scorn, the spight, the pain, Which I deserved to endure, My blest Redeemer did sustain, That I might Saving-health procure. This Day, with nailes his Flesh was torn; This Day, the Speare did wound his side. This Day, he wore a crown of Thorn. This Day, for me, my Saviour dide. 5 Lord, let the Mercies of this day, No Day, hereafter, be forgot. Let not an houre quite passe away Wherein, thy servant minds them not. At least, vouchsafe, that, whilst I live, I may record them once a week; And, let this Hymn occasion give, That, other men may do the like. Hymn VIII. For Saterday. Vpon this day, God rested from the the Works of Creation. Vpon this Day Christ rested in the Grave after he had finished the painfull works conducing to the Restauration of Man-kind. Therefore Meditations tending to the praise of God, in the Commemoration of these Mysteries, which are the effect of this Hymn. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] He that can in a moment space Build Worlds (as he shall please) And, needeth neither Time, nor Place, To work, or take his ease; This Globe, to Furnish, and to Frame, Did sixe Daies Leisure take: And, having finished the same, A Resting Day, did make. 2 When, likewise, his chief-creature was By Sathans wiles, undone; He limited the work of Grace, A certaine Time, to run. And, he who did regenerate, The self same Day, did rest, Which he who all things did create Had for that Reason, blest. 3 Within his Grave, upon this Day, Our Saviour did repose; And, took the sting of Death away When he from thence arose. This Day, the Rigour of the Law, Began to be alayd, And, that which kept in servile-Awe, Now, makes us not afraid. 4 Vpon this Day, each Jewish-Rite, Both Death and buriall had. Their Sabbath, was abolish'd quite, And uneffectuall made. For, why should we the Tipes embrace Or in their Shades abide, When their true Substance comes in place, Which they but typifide? 5 The Fathers Rest, this meaning had That (while Times course did last) Here, no new-creature, should be made; When sixe Dayes works were past. The Resting of his Blessed Son, Declares, that never more Should either suffred be or done, Offenders to restore. 6 Lord, let me also now begin A holy Rest to make. Let me, from all the works of Sin, My Rest, for ever, take. Let so my Lusts be mortifide; In Christ, so bury me; That, I with him, who for me dide, To life, may raised be. 7 As long as either weekes or Dayes, To me shall be renew'd; Let that, which may advance thy praise, Be still, by me pursu'd. And, when the Evening, and the Morne, My last of dayes hath made; Let me in Peace, to thee returne, From whom, I Beeing had. Hymn IX. For Dayes of Publike, or Private Humiliation. In private, or publike fasting Dayes, some are desirous to expresse their spirituall passions in holy Song; and, because many mens Affections are best mooved to a zealous performance of such devotions, by a Mournfull-Melodie, these following Meditations, are prepared for that purpose. Sing this as the former. [1] Foul-Spirits may, our hearts possesse, (As Christ himself did say) From which no man can us release Vnlesse he Fast, and Pray. And, so, both Sins and plagues there be Whose cure, we may despaire, Vntill, oh Lord, we come to Thee By Abstinence, and Praire. 2 Not that our Suff'rings, Suites, or Cries, Can merit what they crave: But, that we may the better prize The Pitty, we would have. And that, by such a Discipline Our Flesh, the better may Submit unto those Lawes-divine, Which all men should obay. 3 For, what oh Lord, availes it Thee If we Repent, or not? If we, or Full, or Fasting be, What profit hast thou got? That thou art prayd, that thou art prais'd, The good is ours alone; And, that to Joy we may be rais'd, Thou, sometime, letst us mone. 4 Our Paine, thou tak'st no pleasure in; Or, to behold our Teares; But that they might prevent the sin, Which bringeth endlesse cares. To see thy People Feast, or Sing, (And, merrie, still, remaine) To Thee much more Delight would bring, If they could sin refraine. 5 Since thou so gracious art oh Lord! So gracelesse, why are we? And, why so backward to afford, More pleasing Fruits to Thee? Oh! Grant since thou requirest nought From us, but for our Blisse, That nought may more of us be sought, Then, Thanks to yeeld, for this. 6 Forgive then all that is misdone, Neglected, or misayd. Remove the Judgements, now begun: Keep off, the Plagues delayd: And, that thy Mercy justly may Our Fears, and Fall prevent; Sincerely, let us, ev'ry day, Our Dayly sins repent. 7 For, swine-like, to the myrie Bog, If we againe returne, (Or, to our vomit, like the Dog) In vaine, we Fast, and Mourne. Nay, worse will our estate become: For, when Expulsed-sin, Re-enters to a cleansed-Roome, It sev'nfold Guilt, brings in. 8 With us, Lord, let it not be so; But, more upright, each day, More sanctified, let us grow; More warie, in our way. That we may passe our Future Daies, Without Offence, or Blame, In holy Mirth, and Songs of Praise, In honour of thy Name. Hymn X. Another for the like Times. This Hymn containes an humble confession of our Guiltines in the breach of the whole Moral-Law; and in our abuse of the Law of Grace also; with an earnest desire, that God would have mercy upon us. [1] Plung'd in Grief and in distresse, Humbly we intend oh God! Our Transgressions to confesse, In a sadly sounding Ode. At thy Footstoole, we appear, Grieved for our Follies past; And untill our suites thou hear, No refection we will tast. Heed, with gracious eies we pray, Our contrition, Lord, this day; And wipe all our Sins away. 2 Thou oh God! ev'n Thou, art he Who from Egypt mysticall, (When as there, enslav'd were we) Freely, didst Redeem us all. For which grace, a vowe we made, Thee to serve, as God, alone: Yet, we other Gods have had; And, forgot what Thou hast done, We, (as Deities) ador'd. Things, more fit to be abhor'd. Yet, Have mercie on us Lord. 3 Though we know, that on thy Foes, Dreadfull plagues thou dost inflict; And, that thou art kind to those, Who thy just Commands respect. Yet, of Thee, our Fancie faines Likenesses, which like thee not. And Idea's in our braines, To thy wrong, are oft begot. Idol-makers we have bin: Our chiefe zeale we spend therein Lord, have mercie on our sin. 4 In thy Name, we were babtiz'd, And thy Name, oh Christ, we beare. But, that grace we have not priz'd, As thereby, oblig'd we are. We have tooke on us in vaine, That great Name which we professe; And yet seeme in hope, to gaine Thy acceptance, ne're the lesse. Many waies, we are to blame, By prophaning of thy Name, But, oh Lord, forgive the same. 5 In our hearts, it was imprest, (Though corruption blurs it now) That we should to Man, and Beast, Times of needfull Rest, allow. And, lest froward Nature might This great Moral, take away, (To preserve that common-right) Hallow'd was the Seventh-day. But, this Precept, we deprave. This great Law, we broken have; And, for this, we mercie crave. 6 We our Parents honour not, (As thy Precepts do command) Neither those, who us begot, Nor the Fathers, of this Land. Nay, our Ghostly-Parents, oft, (Who, in us, would Grace beget) For their Love, are Jeer'd and Scoft; And, their words at nought are set. Of this Fault, we now have sense: Oh! forgive that great Offence; Lest thy Justice root us hence. 7 We, of Murthers, are not cleare, Though no Blood our hands have spilt; For, in us those Passions are, Which have drawn on us that Guilt. Hate and Wrath, in us are found. Cruell Thoughts, and slandrous Tongues, Which ofttimes, our Neighbours wound, Which no lesse then murdrous wrongs. Double-di'd in blood are we: For, oh Christ, we murdred Thee. Yet, now, pardoned let us be. 8 We Adulterers have been; Lustfull hearts, and wandring Eies, Make us many waies uncleane, Which no sight, but thine, espies. Both by Deeds, and words unchast Soild in Soul and Flesh, we are; And, have greedily embrac't Pleasures, which unlawfull were. Cleanse us, Lord! from ev'ry spot: Youthfull-Sins, remember not: But, oh! let them be forgot. 9 Many waies we rob and Steal, More then ev'ry Neighbour knows; And, with few, so justly deal In performance, as in shows. By Deceit, or els by Force, On our Breth'rens Right we ceaze: And, although they bring a curse, Stolen-waters, greatly please, But, now, Lord we do repent: Therefore, what thy Justice ment, Let thy Mercy, still, prevent. 10 Falshood we have testifide, When the Truth, we should have said. God and Man, we have belide; And, the Righteous-cause betrayd, Whence, to others, often springs Not Losse-temporall, alone; But, in Everlasting-Things: Some, are by our Lies, undone. Lord! we now lament these wrongs: Therefore, pardon what belongs, To False-Hearts, and lying-Tongues, 11 Thanklesly we have repin'd, At what is on us bestown; And, in others Lots, we find More Delight, then in our own. And, such Longings, are the cause, Of increasing our Offence. Yea, the Breach of all thy Lawes, And, all Folly flowes from hence. Lord! with grace our hearts inspire, To confine each loose-Desire; Or, to quench that hell-bred-Fire. 12 We have broke, before thy Face, Not thy Law of works, alone, But, against thy Law of Grace, We have oft, and much misdone. In an humble Fast, this Day, At thy feet, we therfore, fall. Hear us, heed us, Lord, we pray; And, forgive our errors all. Let this Day of Penitence, Blot out ev'ry past offence; And, remove thy Judgements, hence. Hymn XI. For a Day of publike Rejoycing. It is usuall upon dayes of Rejoycing to expresse more folly then Thankfulnes, to him who hath vouchsafed the cause of our Exultation. Therfore to rectifie that oversight, and to direct our mirth to the glory of God, this Hymn is provided. Sing this as the Magnificat. [1] Lord, thou hast fil'd our hearts with Joy And, that hath mov'd our Tongues, Their Tunefull Voices to imploy In singing Praisefull-Songs. Rejoycings, in our dwellings are; With mirth our Cups are crown'd; And Shouts of Gladnesse, ev'ry where, Throughout our streets do sound. 2 Lord! whence comes all this merriment? Whence flows it but from Thee? From whom all pleasant things are sent, To those that Thankfull be. Our Faithfull Hopes, thou hast made good, Thou hast made voyd our Fears: Our Foes desire, thou hast with stood; And, dri'de up all our Tears. 3 Let not this Joy, by Fires, and Bells, By Noise, alone, be known; By Feasts, or Healths; but, someway els, (And better wayes) be shown. Yea, since thy Mercy from on high, This Joy, on us bestow'd; Let Works of Mercie, sanctifie The Gladnesse, we have show'd. 4 Let us, to those that are Distrest A word of Comfort Speake; Relieve the Needy, and Opprest; Add Strength unto the weake. So, God will change our Outward Mirth, To such Internall-Ioy, That, nothing, whilst we live on earth, Our Comfort shall Destroy. Hymn XII. For the Birth day of any Man or Woman. They who observe their Birth Dayes, (which many anciently have done, and some yet do) may hereby be remembred of such Meditations as are pertinent to this Anniversarie; and God may be thereby, the more often praised for our Temporall Being. Sing this as the former. [1] Lord! on this Day, thou didst bestow A breathing-Life on me. This Day, an Actor, here below I, first, begun to be. And, but few Rounds, the Sun hath made, Since, I, that now am here, No portion of an Essence had, Except, in Thee, it were. 2 But, now, there is a part of me, (And, Lord, from Thee it springs) That shall both nam'd, and numbred be With Everlasting-Things. And, that, which Time, doth weare away, Times-Ruine, will restore, To be rejoyn'd thereto, for aye, When Time shall be no more. 3 We, now, are thy Probationers, And, as we run this Race, The Life which is to come, prefers To Honour, or Disgrace. And, they which here, the Pathway misse, That unto Vertue, tends, Shall finde no means, nor Hope of Blisse, When this briefe Life-time ends. 4 Another Yeere is now begun; And yet, I do not see How for the Time, which forth is run, I can Account to Thee. For, I confesse, I have mispent, My Longings, to fulfill, The Times, which unto me, were lent, To execute thy Will. 5 And, in the Dayes which are behinde, (Behinde, if any be) What profit can I hope to finde? What will they pleasure me? Since (though Time-past, I might redeeme) So much that Work will cost As (first or last) my Time will seeme, In hazard to be lost. 6 Lord, let this Day of my First-Birth, Occasion, yeerely, give To keep me Mindfull, why on Earth My Being, I receive. And, of my Second-Birth, likewise, So minde Thou Me, thereby, That, I to Life, may not arise A Second-Death, to die. 7 But, let this Day, and all the Daies, Which I, hereafter, view Employed be to give Thee praise, To whom all Praise, is due. And, thus let no man say of me When I to Dust return; Oh! well with Him, now would it be, If He, had nev'r been born. Hymn XIII. For the fifth of November. This Day we commemorate the admirable Deliverance, of this Kingdome, from the terrible destruction and Massacre, intended by the damnable Powder-Treason, to have been executed this Day of the yeere; and from which God, upon this Day graciously preserved, Prince and People, by discovering the same. To his praise, for that Deliverance, this Hymn is Dedicated: and may be most movingly Sung in Dialogue wise. Voice. 1. Wherefore are the Songs of Praise Which now ev'ry where do sound? Since among the Solemn-Dayes, This, of old, hath not been found? Vo. 2. This is that known Day, wherein Fiends (ascending from below) Raised by the Man of Sin, Sought to slay us at a blow. Both. Taught by their Infernall-Sire Britain's Fall, they did conspire, Both by Sulphur and by Fire. Vo. 1. Wherefore do the People sing, As when they in Triumph are? If so sad, so vile a thing, For this Day designed were? Vo. 2. God, that is this Ilands guard, Did this Day, contrive it so, That, the Net, for us prepar'd, Brought the mischiefe on our Foe. Both. And, this Day, which Hell Rome, Thought to make our Day of Doome; Their Confusion, did become. V. 1. Who were they who had the hopes To effect so black a Deed? V. 2. Twelve Apostles of the Popes True Professors of his Creed. V. 1. For begetting such a birth, To those Monsters, what befell? V. 2. Death-deserved, here on earth; And, what els we cannot tell. Both. If Repentance found no Grace, They are Howling in the Place, Where their Plot, first brooded was. V. 1 How was their damn'd purpose known, Er'e their Ends, they could affect? V. 2. By a writing of their own, Which God made them misdirect. V. 1. When was that base Plot foreseen? And where was that perill found? V. 2. When it should have acted been, In a Dungeon under-ground. Both. None but God, could set us clear, From a Danger, and a Fear, So in Secret, and so near. V. 1. God, and none but God, indeed Could have sav'd a Nation so, V. 2. None but God, at such a need, Could have hindred such a blow. V. 1. None but God shall therefore share, In the Honour of the same. V. 2. None save they who Traitors are, Will refuse to praise his Name. Both. Lord, our Souls desirous be, To ascribe all Praise, to Thee; And, thy Love, confesse will we. Hymn XIIII. For the Kings Day. The first Day of the Kings is yeerly solemnized in this Kingdome; partly, that the People might assemble to Praise God, for the Benefits, received by their Prince; and partly to desire God's blessing upon him and his Government; which duties being well performed no due time would prevent the mischiefs which attend on Tiranny, and Rebellion. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] Lord, when we call to minde these things, Which we should aske of Thee, Remembring that the Hearts of Kings At thy disposing be; And, how, of all those Blessings, which Are outwardly possest, To make a Kingdome Safe, and Rich, Good-Princes are the best. 2 When this we minde; thy Name to praise, Our hearts inclined are; For him, oh Lord, whom thou didst raise The royall, wreath to wear. And, we intreat, that he may raign In peacefull Safetie long, Thy Faith-Defender, to remain, And, shield thy Truth from Wrong. 3 With awefull Love, and loving Dread, Let us observe him Lord: And, as the Members with their Head, In Christian Peace accord: Then, fill Him, with such Princely care, To cherish us, for this; As if his Heart, did feel we are Essentiall-parts of his. 4 Let neither partie struggle from The Duties it should own, Lest each to other, Plagues become, And, both be overthrown. For or'e a Disobedient-Land, A Tirant thou wilt set. And, they who Tirantlike command, Rebellion, shall beget. 5 When that Ill-spirit once is rear'd Which Tiranny doth teach; Or, when that Devill hath appear'd Which doth Rebellion preach. In vain, to either partie, than, Their dangers, we foreshow. Or plead the Laws, of God, or Man, For, blind, and mad they grow. 6 With wilfull Fury they run on To execute their will; Not caring what be said or done; Or, whom they Rob, or Kill. And, setled Peace, we seldome see Return to them, or theirs Till rooted from the Land, they be By Sicknesse, Dearth, or Wars. 7 Permit not, Lord, so sad a Doome, Vpon these Realmes to fall. And, that on us it may not come, Remit our Errors all. Yea, let the Partie-Innocent, Some damage rather take Then, by Self-will or discontent A greater Schisme to make. 8 Teach us, who placed are below Our Callings, to apply; And, not or'e curious be to know What things are done on high. Teach Him uprightly to command, Vs, rightly to obay That, both in safetie, still may stand, And keep a Lawfull way. 9 When Kings affaires we pry into Our Selves we oft beguile; And, what we rather ought to do, Is left undone, the while Whereas, if each one, did attend The Course, wherein they live, And, all the rest, to thee commend Then, all should better thrive. 10 Our minds, oh Lord, compose thou thus And, our dread Soveraign save; Blesse Vs in Him, and Him, in Vs, That, both may Blessings have. Yea grant that many yeers we may This Hymn devoutly sing; And marke it for a happy Day, Wherein, he first was King. Hymn XV. For the Day of the Solemnitie belonging to the Knights of the Gartar. This Hymn was composed for the Festivall, belonging to the Knights of the Garter, solemnized upon the Day anciently dedicated to S. George the martyr. It encourageth to brotherly Love and Vnitie, by a Divine Illustration alluding to that, in the 132. Psalme. [1] See Brethren, what a pleasing Blisse, It is our Lives in love to lead. It like that precious oyntment is, Which once anointed Aarons head, And, thence along his beard did flow Ev'n to his Garment skirts below Oh! Lord, This Chrisome sweet Powre on our Soveraignes crown; Till thence, unto his Feet, The same shall trickle down. 2 Lord, like those droppings let it prove Which did on Hermons, Top distill; And, like the Dews, which from above Descended, once, on Sion-Hill, For Peace and Plenties flourish there, Where-ever, these diffusions are. Lord, therefore let them fall On ev'ry noble Hill; And ev'ry humble Dale With Peacefull Plenties fill. 3 Our Soveraigne is as Hermon Hill; His Princes, are as lower Heights. When Graces down on Him, distill, On them, a blessing, also lights: And, thence they further downward, flow, Refreshing those, that are below. Let thus, for ever, Lord, Thy Grace diffused be; And, let us all accord, In truly Serving Thee. Hymn XVI. For Anniversary Sermon-dayes. Devout Persons have to sundry Places lest meanes to procure Anniversary-Sermons to be there preached; on such, or such Daies of the yeere: And perhaps it might further their Founders good Intentions, if this Hymn were then Sung. Sing this as the 23. Psalme. [1] The Sun, hath since we last were here, Quite through the Zodiack run; And, on this Day, another yeer. Is happily begun. To God therefore, this Anniverse, (In honour of his Name) With Heart and Voice, we do reherse, And, praise him in the same. 2 For, Lord, if Thanks men owe to Thee For those who give them bread, Sure, thou for them shouldst praised be, By whom our Souls are fed. And we desire this Due to pay For them who did prepare The means whereby we meet this Day Thy blessed Word to hear. 3 Blesse thou this means, and suffer not Thy Voice to sound in vain. Let not those Lessons be forgot Which to our Weal pertain. But, so let us improve this Grace, Which yeerly is conferr'd That, we leave that lawlesse Race, In which we long have err'd. 4 For, Dayes, and Yeers if we still add Vnto a wicked Course, We shall proceed from being bad, To be a great deal worse. And, ev'ry Day and Yeer, wherein Thy Grace thou tendred hast, Shall help to aggravate our Sin, And to condemn at last. 5 This, to prevent, let what we hear, And have, this day, been taught, Somewhat improve us, ere this Year, About again be brought. That neither this dayes pious Gift, Nor thy good-seed be lost. But rather by our Christian Thrift, Repay this pains, and cost. Hymn CVII. For Anvniersary Marriage-Dayes. Some Married-Persons take Delight, either alone or with a neighbour or two to commemorate, yeerely, the Day of their Marriage; and for that private Commemoration, this Hymn is prepared. Sing this as the .25. Psalme. [1] Lord, living, here are we As fast united, yet, As when our Hands, and Hearts by thee, Together, first, were knit. And, in a thankfull Song, Now, Sing we will thy Praise, For that thou dost as well prolong, Our Loving, as our Dayes. 2 Together we have now, Begun another yeer; But, how much time thou wilt allow, Thou mak'st it not appear. We therefore, do, emplore, That Live, and Love, we may, Still so, as if but one day more, Together we should stay. 3 Let each of others Wealth, Preserve a Faithfull care, And of each others Ioy and Health; As if one Soul we were. Such conscience let us make, Each other not to grieve, As if we, daily, were to take Our Everlasting-Leave. 4 The Frowardnesse that springs From our Corrupted-kinde, Or from those troublous Outward-Things, Which may distract the minde; Permit thou not, oh Lord, Our constant Love to shake; Or, to disturbe our true accord; Or, make our Hearts to ake. 5 But, let these Frailties prove Affections Exerzise, And, that Discretion, teach our Love, Which wins the noblest Prize. So, Time, which weares away, And ruines all things els, Shall fixe our Love on Thee for aye, In whom, perfection, dwels. Hymn XVIII. For an Anniversarie Funerall-Day. Because there are some, whose Passionate Affections make them resolve to keep private Anniversaries in memoriall of Dear-Friends deceased: This Hymn was intended to direct them to those musings, which at such Times, will make their Commemorations more pious, and more profitable. If it be a Woman which is commemorated, let the word Her, be used instead of Him. Sing this, as In sad and Ashie weeds. [1] The Day is now return'd Which in memoriall of my Friend (When first for him I mourn'd) To set apart I did intend. 'Tis now a year Since for my Dear, This yearly Rite was done; And, I as yet, Do not forget My losses to bemoan. 2 I must indeed confesse That (though to Love, still, true I am) My Passions now are lesse: And, that my Grief is not the same; For, Time assures, More perfect Cures, When Sorrow woundeth man, Then all the pow'rs Of Herbs, and Flow'rs, Or Humane-Reason can. 3 Thy Name, oh God, I praise That, thou, by Time, hast eas'd me so. For, doubtlesse, length of dayes Without thy Mercy, lengthens Woe. When thou do'st please, From Paine, to Ease, We in a Night return. And when we grieve, Thou must relieve, Or, we shall ever mourn. 4 That yeerely Rite, therefore, Which to my Friend, my Passion vow'd; Shall honour him the more, If on thy Praise, it be bestow'd, And, If this Day Will passe away, In thankfull Thoughts of Thee; Which once I meant To have mispent, In Griefs, that fruitlesse be. 5 Nor is my Friend forgot Though thus I turn from Him, to Thee. The lesse I love him not, Though now I sing thy Love to me. Whilst Thee I minde, In Thee I finde My Friend again reviv'd. When Him, alone, I think upon I, for One Dead, am griev'd. 6 The Vertues of this Friend Within my Self, let me improve: And to that noble End, Cause, his memoriall me to move. For, if we stray From their Just-way, Whom we, in life, approv'd; Those whom we seem'd To have esteem'd, We never truly lov'd. 7 Lord, I am drawing neer, To his estate whom I bemone; Yea, neerer by a yeer Then, when this dutie last was done. And, still I come The further from The State, I did deplore; As neerer to That State, I grow Which equals Rich and Poore. 8 Vouchsafe oh God! I pray, That, hence remov'd when I shall be, In Thee, behold I may, All those that were belov'd of me. Yea, let none here, To me be Deare, But, those whom I shall finde Enjoy that Love, In Heaven above, Which they on Earth should minde. Hymn XIX. For the Spring-time. God Almightie in the Spring-time, reneweth the Blessing of the Year, for the Sustentation, and refreshment of our Bodies: And this Hymn teacheth by what Meditations we should sanctifie the Blessings of this Season to God's glory, and the Refreshment of our Souls. Sing this as the 10. Commandments. [1] Although he knows it putrifies, Who can so Faithlesse be, to doubt, His Body shall from Death arise; When Times wid'st Wheele, is whirl'd about? Since, ev'ry time, in which the Sun, His yeerly Progresse doth renew, (And round about the Zodiak run) We many Resurrections views? 2 The Leafelesse-Branch the branchlesse-Root, The Seed that lifelesse seem'd to be, (And lies contemned under foot) Becomes a lively-Springing Tree. Yea, that which was no other thing, But Dung, or Dust, or Mud, or Slime, Takes warmth, and Motion from the Spring, And, lives, at least, all Summer-time. 3 Why pine we then, when we perceive, The Winter of an ill Successe, Of ev'ry Means doth us deprive, That should our daily need redresse? Since we behold each Bush and Bough, That Stormes, or Frosts had plucked bare, Gets leaves again, with blossomes now: And, in their Season, fruit may bear? 4 That, which the Winter wasted had The Spring beginneth to restore: The Promise, which long since, God made, Observe he will, for evermore. The Times of Harvest, and of Seed, Of Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall, Each other duly shall succeed, Whilst Heaven and Earth continue shall. 5 The Groves which lately naked stood, A comely Suit of Green do wear; The meaner Plants, do freshly bud; The Meads with Flow'rs embroydred are: The Sun our Day-light, doth prolong: The Flocks, their younglings forth do bring: The Heat begins to waxe more strong; The Birds, in ev'ry Bush do sing. 6 To Him, therefore, who yeer by yeer, Vouchsafeth to remember Vs; And, for our Profit; ev'ry where, Reneweth his good Creatures thus: To Him be praise: And, I emplore, That as increa'st his Blessings be, So Grace and Vertue, more and more, May ev'ry Day, encrease in Me, Hymn XX. For Summer-time. In this Hymn, God is praised for the Blessings which he vouchsafeth by the Summer-season, and wherein the Yeer is in the height of his Glorie) that by good Meditations, the Pleasures and Profits thereof, may be sanctified and made comfortable unto us. [1] Now, the glories of the Year, May be viewed at the best; And, the Earth doth now appear, In her fairest Garments drest. Sweetly smelling Plants and Flowrs, Do perfume the Garden-Bowrs; Hill, and Valley, Wood and Field, Mixt with Pleasures, Profits yield. 2 Much is found, where Nothing was. Herds, on ev'ry mountain go. In the Meddows, Flowrie Grasse, Makes both Milk and Honey flow. Now, each Orchard Banquets giveth; Ev'ry Hedge with fruit, relieveth; And, on ev'ry Shrub and Tree, Vsefull Fruits, or Berries be. 3 Walks and Wayes which Winter mar'd, By the Winds, are swept, and dride; Moorish Grounds are now so hard, That, on them we safe may ride. Warmth enough the Sun doth lend us; From his heat the Shades defend us; And, thereby, we share in these: Safetie, Profit, Pleasure, Ease. 4 Other Blessings, many more, At this Time, enjoy'd may be; And, in this my Song, therefore, Praise I give, oh Lord, to Thee. Grant that this my free Oblation, May have gracious Acceptation; And, that I may well employ Ev'ry thing which I enjoy. Hymn XXI. For Autumn. God, is here praised, for the Mercies and Benefits, vouchsafed unto us in Autumn, wherein, we reape the chiefe reward of our outward yeerely Labours. And, it becomes us (once at least) in so profitable a Season, to remember so gracious a Benefactor. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] What Spring and Summer did produce, Now, in Perfection, doth appear. For, Autumn ripened hath for us, The Fat and sweetnesse of the Year; And, offers up a timely Crop, To him, that labour'd long, in Hope. 2 The youthfull Freshnesse of the Spring, And Summers Beauties are decay'd: Yet, we have, now, more cause to Sing, Then if they longer time, had staid. For, though the Blossome pleasures had It is the Fruit which makes most glad. 3 Preserv'd from nipping Frosts and Stormes, From starving Droughts, and chilling Rains; From Blastings, and from Weeds, and Wormes, A goodly Portion, yet, remaines: Which (if we loose it not by Sin) Stands ready to be gather'd in. 4 Oh Lord! thy holy Name we blesse, That such faire Likelihoods we gain, Those needfull Profits to possesse, For which, we have bestow'd our pain. Let nothing interpose to marre The Good, whereof we hopefull are. 5 Permit not that which we acquire, Empair'd or spoiled to become By Vermine, Floods, Theeves, Frosts, or Fire; Or, by ill-husbandry at home. Nor let us wastfully destroy, What, we discreetly should enjoy. 6 But, let the Harvest of this yeer, So warn us how the later-end, And, Harvest of our Life, draws neer, That, we our Callings may attend: Employ aright what we receive; And, Thanks, for all thy Blessings, give. Hymn XXII. For Winter. Winter, is an Emblem of Old-Age: And this Hymn remembers that from this Season, we take Occasion to be mindfull of our later end; and to meditate such other things also as may be brought to our Consideration, by this unpleasant Season. [1] Now, the Earth begins to mourn, And hath lost her Summer pride: Her faire dressings lately worn, Now, are wholy cast aside; And the Trees that clothed were, Fruitlesse, leafelesse, naked are. 2 Pleasures from our Groves are gone; No delights the Meadows yield; Little profit now, or none Comes from Valley, Hill, or Field. For the greatest winde that blows Threatneth Floods, or Frosts, or Snows. 3 Earthly things thus passe away; And in compasse of a year, Of a Moneth, a Weeke, or Day, Many Changes do appear. That, in love we might not grow With our Trifles here below. 4 They, who while the Spring doth last, Or, while Summer doth remain, Or, ev'r Harvest quite be past, By their Labours, nothing gain. May in Winter those things need, Which their Flesh should cloth, and feed. 5 They who spend their youthfull prime, In unprofitable waies, And foole out their healthfull time, Till the Winter of their Daies. Shall be sure, when they are old, To be hunger fed and cold. 6 Or, if these, this Plague escape, Live they shall, still, cloth'd, and fed, To incur their worse mishap, Who lament when they are dead: And their Sentence to abide, Who their Talents, lose, or hide. 7 Praise, oh God, I give to thee, That, I likely means have got, Of those things that needfull be, Now the Season yeelds them not; And possesse a warme Abode, When Discomforts are abroad. 8 Still, vouchsafe me, so, thy grace, That, I still endeavour may (Whilst I have both Time, and Place) To prevent an Evill-Day. And, what may not shunned be, To endure, Lord, strengthen me. Hymn XXIII. For Ember-weekes. These are our publique Fasts, kept at the foure Seasons of the yeere, that by a Christian humiliation we might move Almightie God to vouchsafe the needfull Blessings of the Season; to strengthen our constitutions against the Humours then predominant, and to be pleased, that they who are called to the Ministry of the Gospel, may be faithfull and fit Labourers for his Vineyard. For, the Lords Day next every of these Fasts, are the times which were anciently appointed, for Laying-hands on such as were called to that office. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] Thou dost from ev'ry Season LORD, To profit us, Advantage take. And, at their fittest houres afford, Those Gifts for which, requests we make. At Winter, Summer, Fall, or Spring, Thou dost confer each needfull thing. 2 A part, therefore, from each of these Religiously hath been reserv'd, By Pray'rs, and Fastings to appease, That wrath, which often, is deserv'd; Lest els, thou, for our many Crimes, Destroy the Blessings of the Times. 3 Vouchsafe, that our Devotions, may With true sincerenesse be perform'd. And, that we may not for one day, But, all our Life-time be reform'd. And mortifie each Lust and Sin, Which we have lov'd, and lived in. 4 Our Constitutions temper so, That, whatsoever humours raign, They nor impaire nor overthrow, That Health which we might els retain. Or, if the Season, sicknesse brings, Lord, comfort us, in other things. 5 And since these Churches do appoint These Times, their Pastors forth to send, Lord, let thy Spirit them anoint, That they thy Flocks, may well attend. Yea, Lord, let those who called be, And, those that Call, be blest of Thee. 6 Informe the One, oh blessed Lord! Whom they should for thy Service chuse, Confirme the Other, by thy Word, And so, to Both, thy Grace infuse. That, both in Words, and Works, they may Persever in a Blessed way. Hymn XXIIII. For Rogation Weeke. This is called Rogation of Rogando, and from the publique Supplications then made. For about that time Princes go forth to Warre; The hope of Plentie is in the blossome; The Aire is most subject to infection; Voyages by Land and Sea are undertaken; and many other things require that publique Supplications should be made. It is our custome also in many places, to visite our Parish Bounders, that contentious suits may be thereby prevented. And if in such neighbourly Preambulations, this, or the like Meditations were publiquely sung as we walke through the Fields, it would not be an unprofitable practise. Sing this as the Lamentation or X. Com. [1] Lord! it hath pleased thee to say, That when we prayed in thy Name, (And prayed as we ought to pray) We should from Thee obtain the same. We therefore, humbly pray Thee, now, That, to the suits which we do make Thou pleas'd would'st be, thine eare to bow, And heare us, for thy Mercy sake. 2 Let not the Seasons of this Yeer, As they their Courses do observe, Engender those Contagions, here, Which our Offences do deserve. Let not the Summer-wormes impaire The Bloomings, of Herbe, Flowre, or Tree; Nor blastings, or distemper'd Aire, Destroy those Fruits that hopefull be. 3 Domestick Jars, expell thou far; And be so pleas'd our Coasts to guard, That, horrid Sounds of In-brought-war, Within our Confines, be not heard. Continue, likewise here, thy Word; And, make us thankfull Lord, we pray, That Famine, Pestilence, and Sword, Have been, so long, with-held away. 4 As we are heedfull to observe, The certaine Limits, of our Grounds; And (Outward-Quiet to preserve) Walk, yeerly, round our Parish-Bounds. So, let us take a comely Care, Our Souls Inheritance, to know; That, no Encroachments may be, there, Obtained by our Subtle, Foe. 5 What pleasant Groves! what goodly Fields! What fruitfull Hils, and Dales, have we! How sweet an Aire, our Climate yields! How stor'd, with Flocks, and Herds, are we! How Milke, and Honey overflow! How cleare and wholsome, are our Springs! From Ravenous-Beasts, how safe, we go! How free from Poysnous-Creeping-Things! 6 For these; and for our Grasse, our Corn; And, all that Springs from Blade, or Bough: For all those Blessings, which adorn Wood, Streame, or Field, this Iland through. For all of these thy Praise, we sing: And, humbly, we petition, too, That, we to Thee, Fruits forth may bring, As unto us, thy Creatures do. 7 So; in the sweet refreshing shade, Of thy Protection, sitting down, The gracious Favours, which we had, Relate we will, to thy renown. Our Children too, when we are gone, Shall for these Mercies, honour Thee; And, famous make what thou hast done, To those, which after Them, shall be. Hymn XXV. For the Advent Sundayes. The Advent-Sundayes are so called, because at those Times, the severall Advents, or Comings of Christ, were commemorated; and the people were instructed concerning those Advents; and what they are, this Hymn sheweth. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] When Christ our Lord incarnate was, Our Brother, then he came to be. When into us he comes by Grace, To be our Spouse, then cometh He. And Comes, when he shall Come agen To judge both Dead and Living-men. 2 Despaire will then all those confound, That his First Comings disregard. And, those, who till the Trumpet sound, Are misimploy'd and unprepar'd. Yea, cursed Pleasures they will prove, Which out of thought, these Comings drove. 3 The Iewes abjected, yet remain, Because his Advent they dinide. The Foolish-Virgins knockt in vain, Because, they did not Oyle provide. But, they still safe, and blessed are, Who for his Comings do prepare. 4 Lord! so prepare us for that Feast, Which keep our Saviours Birth in mind, That, he with us may be a Guest, And, we with Him acceptance find, When that great Advent shall appear, Which wicked men and Devils fear. 5 Oh! Come Lord Iesv, Come away. And (though the World it shall deter) Let that thy Kingdome come, we pray, Whose Coming, Carnall-men defer. And let us wait for with delight, That Advent which thy Foes doth fright. Hymn XXVI. For the Nativitie of Christ. This Day is worthily dedicated to the memoriall of our Saviours Nativitie, by which unspeakable Mysterie the God-head, and Man-hood appeared admirably united in one person, without confusion of Natures, or possibilitie of Seperation to the unexpressible Benefit of Mankinde; and of that Mysterie somewhat is touched in this Hymn. As on the dawning of this Morn, To Shepherds, blessed Angels told, Where, in a Stable he was born, Whom neither Earth, nor Heav'n can hold. And Bethlem streets, as on this day, Of these most happy Tidings rung. A Troup of Angels in aray, A Hymn of Glory also sung. Chor.With Angels thus therefore siong we, To God on high all Glory be: His Favour let Mankinde obtain, And, let on Earth his Peace remain. Hereby we great advantage had. Vs, to exalt, he low was laid. To strengthen us, he weak was made. To cloath us, he was disaray'd. Our Flesh he took, to cure our Guilt. Our Griefs he felt, to give us Rest; To save our Lives, his Blood was spilt; Our Curse he bore to make us blest. Chor.With Angels thus, therefore, sing we, To God on high, all Glory be. His Favour, let Mankinde obtain; And, let on Earth his Peace remain. The Bush did flame, yet burned not; The Fleece was moist, where fell no Rain: A Son was on a Maid begot, Which did a Virgin still remain. Her Seed hath broke the Serpents head; Whereby, our bruises now are heal'd. The Lambe had of the Wolfe no dread: And God and Man be reconcil'd. Chor.With Angels thus, therefore, sing we, To God on high, all Glory be. His Favor let Mankinde obtain: And let on Earth, his Peace remain. Hymn XXVII. Another for the same Day. Since the God-head vouchsafed to honour the Manhood, as to become united thereunto; we are by this Hymn remembred not to despise those who are of the same Nature with us, but rather humbly to descend to others for their Good; and to endeavour the reparation of our Nature by striving to conforme it unto Christ. Sing this as the 4. Psalme. [1] Since all of us, near kinsmen be, Descended from one Stem, Why brutishly inclin'd are we, Our Brethren to contemn? He, that both Heav'n and Earth did frame, Our Nature, did not scorn: But, being God, a Man became, And, of a Maid was born. 2 This; Men and Angels wondred at; (As with good cause they may) This, therefore, to commemorate, We set apart this Day This Day, we make an Anniverse, That, favour to record; And, to our Children to reherse The Mercies of the Lord. 3 That moment whereon God decreed To do as he fore-said, Enabled was the Womans-SEED, To break the Serpents head. And Iesvs Christ, to satisfie, For our accused Crimes, Vouchsaf'd both to be Borne, and Die, At his appointed Times. 4 By Him, New-born, so let us be; To Sin, so let us Die; That, we may live with Him, where Hee Is now enthron'd on high. As Hee, the God-head, for our sake, With Man-hood did aray; On Vs, his Nature, let us take, As fully, as we may. 5 Whereto, we nearest shall attain, When we do Mercy shew; And, strive those Longings to restrain, Which Flesh and Blood pursue. We are assured oh Saviour Christ! Thine Incarnation may Our Nature, hereunto assist: Assist, therefore, we pray. Hymn XXVIII. For the Circumcision or New years-day. Our Church solemnizeth this day, in memoriall of our Saviours Circumcision; that taking notice how soone he began to shed his blood for us, and to smart for our Sins, we might be the more thankfull for the same: and be provoked to repentance, by considering how easie a Sacrament he hath left for our initiation into his Church, in stead of that Bloody-One. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] Oh Christ! this day, thy Flesh did bleed, Mark'd by the Circumcising-knife; Because the Law, for Mans misdeed Requir'd that Earnest of his Life. Those Drops, presag'd that Show'r of Blood, Which in thine Agonie began; And that great Show'r foreshew'd the Flood, Which from thy Side, next morrow ran. 2 Lord! let thy smart make us repent. And, Circumcised-Hearts desire. Yea, by that milder Sacrament, Which follow'd This, thy Grace inspire: For, He that either is Baptiz'd, Or Circumciz'd in Flesh alone. Is but as one Vncircumciz'd; Or, as an Vn-baptized one. 3 The Year, we now anew begin; And outward-Gifts received be. Renew us, also, Lord, within, And make us New years-Gifts to Thee. So, let us with the passed Year, Our old Affections lay aside; That, we, new-Creatures may appear, And in thy Faith, and Fear, abide. Hymn XXIX. For Twelfe-day, or the Epiphanie. This day is celebrated in remembrance of the admirable manifestation of our Saviours birth; and we therefore called the Epiphanie, or Manifestation. It was first discovered from Heaven by Angels, and an heavenly Hoast. To the Gentiles, by a Star in the East: He was afterward manifested by the Vision of the Holy-Ghost descending on him like a Dove, and by a voice from Heaven. He was also manifested by his Doctrine and Miracles. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] The first which brought the blessed News, That CHRIST, on him, our nature took, Were certain Shepherds of the Jewes, Which did, by night attend their Flock. That they might verifi'd behold What by their Prophets was foretold. 2 The second means, whereby oh CHRIST! The World, of thee inform'd became, Was by a Star, which in the East Inform'd the Gentiles of the same; That Heathen-men might learn to see, The Book of Creatures, shews them Thee. 3 A Voice, and Vision from above, And many wonders wrought below, This wondrous Newes did further prove, And have to all confirm'd it so, That, faithlesse, if we now appear, We, worse then Jewes and Ethnicks are. 4 Lord! let thy Pastors, and thy Grace, Our Guiders, and Directors be, As Angels, and a Star once was To aid, in manifesting Thee. And, let us, Thee confesse oh CHRIST! Our King, our Prophet, and our Priest. [5] With Bethlem-Shepherds, let us feast Our Souls, with Joy, that found thou art. And with the Wise-men of the East Let us expresse a Joyfull heart. The Song of Angels, let us sing; And Presents of Thanksgiving bring. 6 Teares, which from true Repentance drop, In stead of Myrrh, from us receive. For Incense, which they offred up, Vnfained Praises, let us give. And, bring for Gold, each pious-Deed, Which doth from saving-Faith proceed. 7 And, as the Wise-men, never went To visit wicked Herod more, So (finding Thee) let us repent The Course, we follow'd heretofore; And, let us homeward learn to go That way, which thou shalt please to show Hymn XXX. For the Day of the Purification. The blessed Virgin Mary having fulfilled the dayes of her Purification, according to the Law, presented both her Son, and her appointed Off-spring in the Temple. This Anniversarie is to commemorate her exemplary Obedience, and the presentation of our Saviour. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] No doubt but She that had the grace Thee, in her wombe Lord Christ to bear, (And, did all woman-kinde surpasse) Was hallow'd by thy being there: And, sure, the Birth could not pollute Where Holinesse became the Fruit. 2 Yet, in Obedience to thy Law, Her Purifying-Rites were done; That we might learn to stand in awe, How from thy Discipline we run: For Souls they have unpurifi'd; Where due Obedience is deni'd. 3 Oh! keep us Lord, from judging vain, What, by thy Word, thou shalt command. Let us nor censure, nor complain On what we do not understand: And guide thy Church, that she may still, Command, according to thy Will. 4 With pious uniform consent, Let us thy Praises ever sing; And keep that seamlesse-Robe unrent, For which Prophannesse, Lots would fling. Preserve us, in thy Love and Fear, From our pollutions, alwaies clear. 5 And, as thy blessed Mother, went, (That holy and beloved Maid) Thee, in thy Temple, to present, With perfect humane-flesh arraid; So, let us unto thee be brought With heavenly Graces, fully fraught. 6 Yea, let thy Church our mother-Dear (Within whose wombe, new borne we be) Before thee, at her Time appear, To give her Children, up to Thee: And Lord! receive, as hallowed things Her, and that Offring, which she brings. Hymn XXXI. For the Time of Lent. This Observation was first instituted, partly to commemorate our Saviours miraculous Fasting, whereby he satisfied for the Gluttony of our first Parents: partly to coole the Blood, which at this time of the yeare is subject to be inflamed to the endangering of our Health; but it was chiefly ordained to prepare us rightly to meditate the Passion of our Saviour, which is usually commemorated at the end of our Lent. The Abstinence from Flesh at this season, is onely a civill Ordinance for the better increase and preservation of the Creatures upon the land, for our temporall profit. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] Thy wondrous Fasting to record, And our unruly Flesh to tame, A Holy Fast, to thee, oh Lord! We have intended in thy Name. O sanctifie it so, we pray, That Honour may redound to Thee; And so dispose us, that it may To our advantage, likewise be. 2 Let us not grudgingly abstain; Nor secretly, the Gluttons play. Nor openly, for glory vain, This usefull Discipline obey. But, let us Fast, as thou hast taught, Thy Rule, observing, in each part, With such Intentions as we ought; And with true singlenesse of Heart. 3 So, Thou shalt our Devotions blesse, And make this Discipline to be A means those Lustings to suppresse, Which hinder us in serving Thee. And, though our strictest Fastings faile, To merit, of themselves, thy Grace; Yet, they, to make for our availe, By thy Deservings, may have place. 4 True Fastings, helpfull oft have bin, The wanton Flesh to mortifie: But, they take off no guilt of Sin; Nor can we merit ought thereby. It is thine abstinence oh CHRIST! And thine alone, that merit must: For, when our works are at the best, We perish, if in them we trust. Hymn XXXII. For the Anuntiation. The Church dedicates this Day to commemorize the Anuntiation of the Blessed Virgin, who was about this Time of the yeare saluted by the Angell Gabriel. Jt mindeth us to praise God for the unexpressible Mystery of our Saviours conception, which was the happy newes brought unto his Mother, by that Angell Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] Ovr hearts, oh blessed God! incline Thy true Affection to embrace, And, that Humility divine, Which for our sakes uouchsafed was. Thy Goodnesse, teach us to put on As with our Nature thou wert clad; And, so to heed thy Favours done, That, we may praise Thee, and be glad. 2 For, thou didst not alone depute Thy holy Angell from above, An humble Virgin, to salute With an embassage of thy Love; But thou these Glories laying by, Which none hath pow'r to comprehend; Didst also, then, most wondrously, Into that Virgines wombe descend. 3 Vouchsafe thou, likewise, thy Respect, To our despis'd, and low Degree; And Lord! oh, do not us neglect, Though worthy of contempt we be. But, by thy Messengers prepare, And, hallow so, our hearts, we pray, That, thou may'st be conceived there; And, that, Faith's fruits bring forth we may. Hymn XXXIII. For Palme-Sunday. Palme-Sunday is called so, because it commemorates the day, wherein Iesus Christ rode in Triumph to Jerusalem, his way being strewed with Garments, and Branches of the Palme-tree. Jt was indeed, the Day of proclaiming him King (though few considered it) as the Fryday following was the day of his Coronation, and worthily are these Mysteries remembred this Day. Sing this as the Magnificat. [1] VVhen Christ unto Ierusalem, To Suffer, meekly rode; The Waies, and Streets, were then, for Him, With Palme, and Robes bestrow'd. And, though the Steed he did bestride, Was but a silly Asse; HOSANNA to the King, they cri'd, As He along did passe. 2 His Glory, and his Royall-Right, Through Povertie did shine: And shew'd (in Earthly Pomps despight) A Majesty Divine. For, though his greatest Foes did frown, He exercis'd his pow'r, Till He himself did lay it down, At his appointed how'r. 3 Possession of his House he got; The Merchants, thence expel'd: Yea, though the Priests did rage thereat, He, there, his Lectures held. And, they in Wit, or Faith, were dull, Who doubted what He was; When Deeds they saw so powerfull, By Weaknesse, brought to passe. 4 Lord! when to us thou drawest nigh, Thee, let us learn to know; And, to receive Thee Joyfully, Though mean, in outward show. Yea, though the Rich, and worldly-wise, When we thy praise do sing, Both Vs, and Thee, therefore, despise. Declare thy selfe our King. Hymn XXXIIII. For Thursday before Easter. On this Day, Christ instituted the Sacrament of his Last-Supper; washed his Disciples feet; prayed for them, and all the Faithfull; instructed, warned, exhorted, counselled and comforted them before his approaching Death, and Resurrection, &amp;c. In commemoration of these, and other pertinent Circumstances preceding his Passion, we do yearly observe this Day. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] A holy Sacrament, this day, To us, thou didst, ô Lord! bequeath, That, by the same, preserve we may A due memoriall of thy Death: And, that we might thereby, to Thee Misteriously united be. 2 Thy holy-Supper being done. Thou washedst thy Disciples feet; Thereby, informing every one What Lowlinesse for these is meet, Who thy Disciples would be thought. (Thy practise foll'wing, as they ought) 3 This Day, thou didst, moreover spend, To Counsell, Comfort, and to Pray, That, Satan might not gain his end, While Death remooved Thee away. Then, as by thee, it was foresaid; That night, thy Servant, Thee betraid. 4 Yea, they, that night from Thee did fly, Who promis'd constant to abide: Ev'n He, who vow'd for Thee to dye, With Oaths and Curses, thee deni'd. To shew that we soon fall from grace, If in our selves, our Trust we place. 5 Sweet Iesus! teach us to conceive, What Grief thou felt'st, when thou didst hear, Thy vowed Friend, his Faith to leave; And, in thy presence, Thee forswear: That, we our vowes, may better keep; And, for our past-denyals weep. 6 Lord, ev'ry passage of this day, Within our hearts ingrave thou so, That, we thereby remember may, Our duties faithfully to doe; And let our Love, oh God! to Thee, In Life, and Death, unchanged be. Hymn XXXV. For Fryday before Easter. This day we memorize the unsufferable Passion of Iesus Christ, who about this time of the yeare, and on this day of the weeke, was despightfully crucified by Pilat and the Jewes. Every day we ought to meditate the same. But this Day most Congregations meet in a publike Commemoration thereof, to provoke each other to compunction of heart; and to give an occasion to such as are heedlesse or ignorant thereof, to be better acquainted therewith. Sing this as the 51. Psalme. [1] You that regardlesse, passe along, And are unmindfull of this Day: Give eare unto my dolefull Song, And, heedfull be what now I say. A Tragick Story, sing I shall, Which nearly doth concern us all: The like was never heard before; Nor shall be told, for evermore. 2 The noblest Prince that er'e wore Crown, Beyond all basenesse was abus'd: The truest Friend, that er'e was known, Worse then the cruelst Foe was us'd. He, that offended not in ought, (By Deed by Word, or by a Thought) Tormented was, for all the Crimes, Of Present, Past, or Future-Times. 3 They for whose Grief, he sadly wept, Pursu'd his Life, who sought their Good. To mischieve him, strict watch they kept; And, thirsted for his precious blood. Yet, he continued loving, still; To them, repaying Good for Ill Yea, Them, when he might have orethrown; To save their lives, he gave his own. 4 They who most Friendship should have shown With deep unkindnes, peirc'd his heart. He made his dear affection known; And they dispised his desart. For him, they snares and Engines layd; With showes of Love, they him betraid. And, swords and staves (as to a Thief) They brought to apprehend their Chief. 5 Him, they expose to all disgrace; They buffet him, for Just replies; They spit their Filth into his Face; Against him Falshoods, they devise. For being silent, him they blame. For speaking Truth, they do the same. They Jeer, they scorn, they him revile. And, he sits quiet, all the while. 6 His Garments, then, from him, they strip'd (So sad a sight, was never seen) And, their true Prince, with Rods, they whipt, As if a Bondslave he had been. In purple they clothed him; And for a princely Diadem, They crown'd him, with a wreath of Thorn; And, called Him, their King, in scorn. 7 To view him in so sad a plight, In them, it could no pitty breed; But, they rejoyced at the sight, And, in their Malice, did proceed. Away with him; away, they cride. And, call'd to have him crucifide. Yea, rather then they him would save, Vnto a Murthrer, life they gave. 8 A weighty Crosse upon his back, (Late rent with wounds they rudely laid: Which he to bear did undertake, Till him, that Burthen over-weigh'd The Son of God, the life of Men, Vnto that Crosse, they nayled then: And in the view of all the Throng, By his torn Hands, and Feet he hung. 9 Could I in words, his pain relate As to my heart, the same appears; Each hearer would be mov'd thereat, To shed, at least a show'r of Teares. For, when his torments were at height, They still pursu'd him with despight, And, still, what e're they Did or said, To torture Him, for them he pray'd. 10 He was abus'd, or left of all. Some, did his pious works deride: To comfort him, some gave him gall: Some stouted, when to God he cri'd. Few seem'd so touched with his Grief, As was one tender-hearted Thief; And He, who to conclude his smart, Did thrust a Jav'lin to his Heart. 11 Although his Love immortall were, It was our Flesh that then he wore Which could not endles torments bear: Thereon, their Spight prevail'd therefore. And, then the Lambe foretipifi'd By that, which for yong Isaack di'd, Gave up the Ghost, and so defray'd Our debt, which we could nea'r have paid. 12 His Death (though much it mov'd not man) Did make the Sun his Light restrain; The fixed Earth to quake began; The Temple-Vaile was rent in twain: It caus'd the hardest Rocks to crack; The Closets of the Dead it brake; And of their Graves, they did arise, And shew themselves to mortall eies. 13 Then, did his Foes begin to fear Which Fear, in some Despaire begot; Some were amaz'd; some hopefull were, Some raged, and relented not. His Friends, whose Faith this triall shook, Renew'd lost Hopes; new courage took; Yet feared more, then they beleev'd; Till him revived, they perceiv'd. 14 Let all of us, who present be With loving Hearts, this Prince embrace. For by his Death, alive are we; And by his Pains, we gained Grace. In Him, whom Pilat crucifi'd, All this was truly verifi'd; In Him, therefore, so let us live, That, Life-eternall he may give. 15 Our Sins did help (as on this Day) With Whips, and Thorns to make him smart, They help to take his life away. Our want of Love, did wound his Heart. And, though the Iewes despight we blame; We were partakers in the same. Oh! let us, now, partake no more In their offence, as heretofore. Hymn XXXVI. For Easter-Day. This Day is kept in memoriall of our Saviours blessed Resurrection, whereby the Church (as members with their Head) began a Joyfull Triumph over Sin, Death, and the Devill. And this Annuall Commemoration, was thought helpfull, both to stir up Thankfull rejoycings in those to whom this is knowne, and to be a means also to make some take knowledge of it, who are yet Strangers to these Mysteries. Sing this as the 100. Psalme, without the Chorus. This is the Day, the Lord, hath made, And, therein, joyfull we will be: For, from the black Infernall Shade, In Triumph, back return'd is he. The snares of Satan, and of Death, He hath victoriously undone: And his Opposers, forc'd he hath His Triumphs to attend upon. Cho.This is the Day the Lord hath made: Come; let us now, therein be glad. The Grave, which all did once detest, And thought, a Dungeon full of Fear; Is now become the House of Rest, And, no such Terrors harbor there. For Christ our Lord, hath took away The Horrors, of that lothsome Den And, since his Resurrection-Day, The Faithfull find no Fears therein.Cho.This is the Day, the Lord hath made: Come; let us, now, therein be glad. His bitter mocks, his painfull smart, Hath Praise and Ease for us procur'd. And, to our Joy, we may convert, What, he with broken Heart endur'd. His Body, now, is made a Food, Our fainting Spirits to refresh: And, we are by his precious Blood, Refined both in Soul and Flesh.Cho.This is the Day, the Lord hath made: Come; let us, now, therein be glad. His Wounds that were both deep and wide, To us, the Caves of Refuge are. There, from Pursuers, we may hide, And scape our Lifes destroyer there. Now, know we, that (as was foretold) His Flesh did no corruption see: And, that, Hell wanted strength to hold So strong, and blest a Prince as he.Cho.This is the Day, the Lord hath made: Come; let us all, therein, be glad. Oh! let us praise his Name, therefore, Who this renowned Conquest won: For, we had else forevermore, Been everlastingly, undone. Whereas, emboldned now we grow, Triumphantly, to say or sing, Oh Hell! where is thy Conquest now? And, where (oh Death! is now thy sting?Cho.This is the Day the Lord hath made, Come, let us now, therein be glad. Hymn XXXVII. For Ascention Day. After our Saviour was risen from the Dead; and had many times shewed himselfe to his Disciples, he ascended visibly up into heaven in their presence. In memoriall of which Ascention; and, to praise God for so exalting the humane-Nature, we celebrate this Day. Sing this as the 117. Psalme. [1] To God, with heart, and cheerfull voice, A Triumph Song, we sing; And, with true Thankfulnes rejoice In our Almighty King. We to his Glory will record (Who are but dust and clay) What Honour he did us afford, On his Ascention-Day. 2 The humane-Nature, which of late, Beneath his Angels was; He called up, from that estate, Vnto a higher Place. For, at Mans feet all Creatures bow: To him, they subject be: And, at God's right hand, throned now, In Glorie, sitteth He. 3 Our Lord, and brother, who put on Such Flesh as this we wear; Before us, up to Heav'n is gone, Our Places to prepare. Captivitie, was captive then, And, He doth from above, Send Ghostly-Presents down to Men; For Tokens of his Love. 4 Each Doore, and Everlasting-Gate, To him, hath lifted bin; And, in a glorious-wise, thereat, Our King is entred in. Whom, if to follow we regard; With Love, and leave we may: For, he hath all the means prepar'd; And made an open way. 5 Then follow; follow on apace Our Captain to attend; In that supream and blessed Place, Whereto he did ascend. And, for his Honour, let our Voice A shout, so heartie make; That Heav'n may at our Joy rejoice, And Hels foundation shake. Hymn XXXVIII. For Pentecost, or Whitsunday. At the Jewes Pentecost, which was the fiftieth Day after their Pasche, and the Resurrection of Iesus Christ, the Holy-Ghost, our Comforter, was miraculously sent downe upon the Disciples, in a visible Forme; replenishing them with Spirituall Gifts, for the edification of his Church. We therefore observe this Day in remembrance of that Mysterie. Sing this as the former. [1] We do acknowledge thee, oh Lord! Vpright in all thy waies; And, that the firmnes of thy Word, Well merits endlesse praise. For, as by Thee, it was made known, Before thou hence didst goe, Thou sentst thy Holy-Spirit down, Thy Favours, to bestow. 2 While thy Disciples in thy name, Together did retire; The Holy-Ghost upon them came, In cloven-Tongues of Fire. That, in their Calling, they might be Confirmed, from above, As Thou wert, when he came on Thee Descending like a Dove. 3 Whereby, they who unletter'd were, And, fearfull, till that how'r, Inspir'd with prudence, did appear, And, fortifi'd with pow'r. Yea, Gifts he gave, so manifold, That, since Tim's Round begun; A wonder never hath been told, Which did exceed this one. 4 Oh, let this blessed Spirit, Lord! To us thy servants, here, A portion of that Grace afford, Which doth in Thine appear. To us, thy Dovelike meeknes lend, That humble we may be; And by thy pure white wings, ascend Our Saviour CHRIST, to see. 5 Like Cloven-Tongues, vouchsafe we pray So to Descend agen, That, Saving-Grace we publish may; And preach down Sin, in men. Yea, let thy sanctifying-Fire, Inflame us from above: Burn up in us, all vain Desire; And warme our hearts with Love. 6 Be pleased, likewise, to bestow On us, thy sacred Peace; That, Vnitie may stronger grow, And our Debates decrease. Which Peace, if any do contemn, Reformed let them be; That, we may, Lord, have part in Them, And We, and They, in Thee. Hymn XXXIX. For Trinitie-Sunday. After the Arrian Heresie had troubled many with doubts concerning the Mysterie of the Blessed Trinitie. It seemed convenient to some Churches, that one Day should yearly be set apart, both to commemorate, and instruct us concerning this Mysterie. To which end, we observe the Sunday next after Whitsunday, and others, the Sunday next before the Advent. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] They, ô thrice Holy, Three in One! Who seek thy nature to explain, By Means to Humane Reason known; Shall find their Labour spent in vain. And, that they might contain, as well, The British Ocean in a shell. 2 More, therefore, then we may conceive, We will not curious be to know: But rather, when thou bid'st us to believe, Obey, and let uain Reas'ning goe. For, far more sure, Faith's Objects be; Then those, which Reasons eies do see. 3 Yet, as by looking on the Sun, (Though to his Essence, we are blinde) And by the Course, we see him run, We may of him, true Notions find. So; what thy Brightnes doth conceal, Thy Word, and Works (in part) reveal. 4 Most Glorious-Essence, we confesse In Thee (whom by Faith's eies we view) Three Persons, neither moe, nor lesse, Whose Workings, them, distinctly shew: And, sure we are those Persons Three, One God (and but one God-head be) 5 The Sun, a Motion hath, we know, That Motion shews to us his Light. The Heate proceedeth from those two. Each, works his proper Works aright. The Motion drawes out Time, a Line; The Heat doth warm; The Light doth shine. 6 But though this Motion, Light, and Heat, Distinctly, by themselves we take, Each in the other hath his seat; And, but one Svn, these Three do make. For, whatsoe're the One will do, It worketh by the other Two. 7 So, in the God-head, there is knit A wondrous Threefold-Truelove knot; And perfect Vnion fastens it, Though Flesh and Blood conceive it not; And what is by One Person done, Is wrought by all the Three-in-One. 8 Their Works they joyntly do pursue, Though they their Offices divide; And though, as things distinctly due, Some Attributes may be appli'd. For, One in Substance, they are still; In Vertue, One, and one in Will. 9 Eternall all these Persons be; And, yet, Eternall, there's but One. So likewise, Infinite all Three; Yet, Infinite, but One, alone. And, neither, any thing doth misse, Which of the God-heads ESSENCE is. In Vnitie, and Trinitie, Thus (oh CREATOR) we adore Thine ever-praised DEITIE; And, Thee confesse, for evermore, One FATHER, one Begotten SON; One HOLY-GHOST, in God-head one Hymn XL. For All-Saints-Day. This Day we commemorate the Mystery of the Communion of SAINTS, which shall be made perfect, when the holy Trinitie, The Angels and all the HOLIES and blessed Elect of God shall be incorporated into a joyfull, and unspeakable, and inseparable Vnion, in the Kingdome of Heaven, which the Almightie hasten. Amen. Sing this as the former. [1] No Blisse can so contenting prove, As universall-Love, to gaine, If we, with Full-requiting-Love, Could such Affection entertain. But, such a Love, the Heart of Man, Nor comprehend, nor merit can. 2 For, though to all we might be dear, (Which, cannot in this Life, befall) We discontented should appear, Because, we had not Heart for all; That we might all men Love, as we Beloved, would of all men be. 3 For, Love in Loving, Joyes as much, As, Love for Loving to obtain. The perfect Love, is alway such, And cannot part it Self in twain; Or Love receive; but where it may With Truest Love, True-Love repay. 4 Love cannot in it self be two. The Object of True Love, therefore, An Vnite is, which cannot grow To be in ESSENCE, two, or more. In Rivals-Loves, no Love is known. And Love-divided, loveth none. 5 By Love in Fraction, vext are we Whil'st here on earth we do remain; And if in Heav'n such Love could be, Sure Heav'n would be a place of pain, And, Saints, perhaps, would jealous prove, Of Gods, or of each others Love. 6 But, He whose wisdome hath contriv'd, His Glorie with our full content Hath from himself a means deriv'd, Our Loves distractions to prevent. One Body of all Saints he makes; And, for his Bride, that One, he takes. 7 So, ev'ry member doth obtain Full Love from all, returning too, Full to All, of them again, As members of one Body do; None Jealous; but, all striving how Most Love to others to allow. 8 For, as the Soul is All in All, (And, All through ev'ry member too) Love, in that Body-Mysticall; Is as the Soul, and fits it so: Vniting them to God, as near, As to each other, they are dear. 9 The Love they want to entertain Such overflowing Love as his, He adds; which they return again To make up Love which perfect is. That, he may his own Love imploy, And, both find perfect Love and Joy. 10 The seed of this Content was sown, When GOD, the spatious world did frame; And, ever since, that seed hath grown, To be an Honour to his Name. And, when the SAINTS are sealed all, This hidden Truth unseal he shall. 11 Meanwhile, as when Woods, Hils and Seas, In Landskip shadow'd forth, we shew, And, therewithall our Fancies please, Though we their substance do not view: So, Contemplations-Map may shew, Dim sights, of that which we shall know. 12 And, though our Hearts too shallow be, That blest Communion to conceive, Whereof, in Heav'n we shall be free, Let us, on Earth together cleave; Since none shall tast that Blessing, there, But, they who live in Vnion here. 13 There, all those Angels we admir'd, With ev'ry Saint, since Time begun, (Whose Love, and Sight, we have desir'd) Shall joyned be with us, in One; And We, and They, and they, and We, To GOD himself espouz'd shall be. 14 Oh! therefore, let us watch and pray, With Lamps, and Oyle, still so prepar'd, That, on the LAMBS great Marriage-day, We be not from this Wedding barr'd; But, find a free Admittance there, Where GOD, and all his HOLIES are. Hymn XLI. For St. Andrewes-Day. This Day we praise God for the Benefit which his Church obtained by the Calling, and Ministry of his Apostle Andrew; and we are hereby remembred, so to observe his Readinesse to follow and preach Christ, that we may be stirred up to imitate the same. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] Whil'st Andrew, as a Fisher sought From pinching want, his Life to free; CHRIST call'd him, that he might be taught, A Fisher-man of men, to be. And no delay therein, he made; Nor questioned his Lords intent; But, quite forsaking all he had, With him that called, gladly went. 2 Would God, we were prepared so, To follow Christ, when he doth call; And, could as readily forgoe Those Nets, which we are snar'd withall. Yea, would this Fisherman of men, Might us by his example move, To leave the World, as he did then; And by our Works, our Faith approve. 3 But, Precepts and Examples fail, Till thou, oh Lord! thy Grace inspir'st: Vouchsafe it, and we shall prevaile, In whatsoever thou requir'st. Yea, we shall then that Good perceive, Which in thy Service, we may find; And, for thy sake, be glad to leave Our Nets, and all our Trash behind. Hymn XLII. For St. Thomas his Day. We set apart this day, to praise God, for the Ministrie of his Apostle St. Thomas; and that occasion may be thereby given to strengthen our Faith, by an Annuall commemoration of that part of the Evangelicall Story, which mentioneth aswell this Apostles doubtings, as the confirmation of his faith, by a sensible demonstration of Christs Resurrection. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] When Christ from Death, to life did rise, And Thomas heard that wonder told; He said he would not trust his Eies, Though Him, they living, should behold; Till with his Fingers, he had tri'd, His pierced hands, and wounded side. 2 His gracious Master did permit The Proof, his Frailtie sought to take; That, others might assurance get, Of that, whereof he doubts did make. And we more strength by him have got, Then by their Faith who doubted not. 3 Oh! blessed GOD, how wise thou art! And, how confoundest thou thy Foes! Who their Temptations do'st convert To work that End, which they oppose. When Satan seeks our Faith to shake, The former, he the same doth make. 4 Still when to Sins he tempteth us, To his Confusion, let it be; To our Advantage, turn it thus; And, let it bring us home to Thee. Yet, let us hate and shun all Sin, As if, our mischief, it had bin. Hymn XLIII. For St. Stephens-Day. Stephen was one of the seven Deacons mentioned Act. 6. and the first Martyr of Iesus Christ. Hee powerfully maintained the Gospell by dispute, and sealed the Truth with his Blood: For which GOD is gloryed by this Dayes observation, and others by his exemplarie Constancie remembred Sing this as the former. [1] Lord! with what Zeal, did Stephen breath Thy Truth to such as him withstood? How stoutly did he meet his Death, To Seal thy Gospel, with his blood? This Constancie, thy Grace hath Crown'd; And, by so Dying; Life he found. 2 Much Love, did in that Saint appear, When for his Murtherers, he su'd: And, Faith had made his Eye-sight clear, When thee, inthron'd in heav'n, he view'd. In Torments, he true Patience kept; And, di'd, as if he had but slept. 3 With his hot Zeal, our Hearts inflame; So kinde, so constant, let us be: In life, so let us Praise thy Name, In Death, so let us looke on Thee: And, when our Sleep, in Death we take, With Him, to Life, let us awake. Hymn XLIIII. For S. John the Evangelist his Day. We solemnize this Day to praise God for his blessed Evangelist, and beloved Disciple John, who was one of the most powerfull Instruments of the Churches illumination, and Consolation. For, by Him, the Divinitie of Christ, and the most comfortable mysteries of our Redemption, are most evidently witnessed. Sing this as the 10. Commandments. [1] By his Examples, teach us Lord, For whom we honour Thee this Day. His Witnesse, of th'Incarnate-Word, Continue in thy Church, for aye. As he, likewise, beloved was, And, therefore leaned on thy brest; So, let us, Lord, enjoy thy Grace; And, on thy sacred Bosome, rest. 2 Breathe into us, that Life-divine, Whose Testimonie, he intends; About us, cause thy Light to shine; That Light, which no man comprehends. And, let that ever-blessed-word, Which, all things did create, of nought, Anew, create us, now, oh Lord! Who are by Sin, to ruine brought. 3 Our sins, we heartily confesse, Thy pardon, therefore, let us have. Thy Saving-faith we do professe; Vs, to thy Fellowship, receive. And, as to us, thy Servant gives The means to know and honour Thee; So, let oh Lord! our words and lives, Both Lights, and Guides, to others, be. Hymn XLV. For Innocents Day. In honour of the Almightie-Providence, this Day is observed by our Church, who upon this Day memorizeth our Saviours preservation from Herods crueltie, when he slew the Innocent Children in Bethlehem, and the parts adjoyning. And we are thereby put in minde, how vainly, the Devill, and his members, rage against God, and his Decrees. Sing this as the former. [1] That Rage, (as David fore declar'd) Which did the Gentiles Fury shew; By Herod then fulfilled was When blamelesse Innocents he slew. And, madly they pursude in vain, What they had cursedly contriv'd; For, He whom Herod would have slain; Him, and his Malice, overliv'd. 2 Still, thus, vouchsafe thou to restrain, All Tirants, Lord, pursuing Thee. Let ill conceptions, thus, be slain, That, Thou in us, preserv'd mayst be. So, whilst we shall enjoy our breath, We of thy Grace, our Songs will frame; And, as those Infants, by our Death We hope to glorifie thy Name. 3 Those many suffred Death, for One; That One, for them, and others dide. And, what they felt in Act, alone; He, did in Will, and Act, abide. Lord, grant that what thou hast decreed, In Will, and Act, we may fulfill: And, though we reach not to the Deed, From us, oh God, accept the Will. Hymn XLVI. For the Conversion of Saint Paul. Paul, having been a cruell Persecutor, was extraordinarily called, to be an Apostle to Preach the Faith which he had persecuted; and of a Wolfe became a Pastor; and the most laborious in the Vineyard of Christ: which Mercy of God, is here commemorated to his praise, and for our comfort. Sing this as the former. [1] A Convert, and Conversion strange Was made, when Saul, a Paul became: And, Lord, for making such a change, We praise, and glorifie thy Name. For, whilst he went from place to place, To persecute thy Church and Thee; He was reclaimed by thy Grace, A Preacher of thy Truth to be. 2 Lord, when from thee we go astray, Or injure Truth, by blinded Zeal, Vouchsafe to stop us in that way; And, then, thy Will, to us reveal. Disclose that Brightnesse from above, Which proves the Sensuall Eye-sight blind; And, from our Eyes, the skales remove, That, hinder us, thy way to finde. 3 And, as thy blessed Servant Paul, (When thy Disciple he became) Exceeded by Apostles, all, In painfull preaching of thy Name. So, grant, that we, who have in Sin Exceeded others heretofore, The start of them, in Faith, may win; Love, Serve, and Honour thee, the more. Hymn XLVII. For Saint Matthias his Day. This Day is observed in memoriall of Gods Justice, manifested in discovering and punishing Judas Iscariot for abusing his Apostleship; and, for his Mercy in electing Matthias, a faithfull Pastor in his Roome. It gives us Occasion also, to consider what hangs over their heads, who abuse their Divine-Calling. Sing this as the 4 Psalme. [1] When one of thine, did false become, And, his high place abuse; Thou left'st him, Lord, and in his Roome, Didst just Matthias chuse, So, if within thy Church this day, Vnfaithfull Pastors dwell, To them, Repentance grant, we pray, Or, them, with speed, expell. 2 Though, horned like the Lambe they show, Though, Sheep-like, cloth'd they be; Let us their Dragon-language know, And, Woolvish-nature see. And, cause thy Lots to fall on those, (Thy Flocks to undertake) Who shall their manners well compose, And, thereof Conscience make. 3 Let us likewise, his fall, so heed Whose Place, Matthias got; And, with such loving Awe proceed, That, we deny Thee not. For, Titles be they nev'r so high, Rare-Gifts, or Sacred-Place, Shall no mans Person sanctifie, Without thy Speciall-Grace. Hymn XLVIII. For Saint Marks Day. This day is appointed to praise God, for the Glad tidings of his Gospel, delivered to the Church by his blessed Evangelist Mark: by whose Testimony that Saving-Truth, is confirmed and Illustrated unto us. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] For those blest Pen-men of thy Word, Who have Evangeliz'd of Thee, We magnifie thy Name oh Lord! And, thankfull, we desire to be. The Welcome News, thy Gospel brings, With joyfull Hearts, we do embrace; And, prize above all earthly Things, That Precious Earnest of thy Grace. 2 This Matchlesse Jem, that we may buy Let us with gladnesse, Cost bestow, Our vain Self love, let us deny, And, let the Worlds False-honours go. Although from Heav'n an Angel come To preach another Gospel, here, Let us not entertain the same Nor lend thereto a willing eare. 3 Lord, we are now affected thus; But, in performance, we are fraile; Too craftie is our Foe for us, And (if thou help not) may prevaile. Enable us, therefore, to Judge, and know, (When we new-Doctrines do receive) If they agreeing be, or no, To what a Christian should beleeve. Hymn XLIX. For Saint Philip and Jacobs Day. The Church upon this Day taketh Occasion to offer to our Consideration, some of those Mysteries of Saving Faith, which were delivered unto her by the Ministry of the Apostles Philip, and Jacob, that we might the better beare in minde their Counsels, and be thankfull unto God for them. Sing this as the former. [1] By Thee were thy Disciples taught, What they, oh Christ, should do; What, likewise to Beleeve, they ought, Thy Spirit shew'd them too. The Truths which unto them were shown, Have been dispos'd of thus; They, unto others made them known; From Those, they came to us. 2 Thus they have taught; and thus we say; (And, therein will abide) Thou art the Life, and Truthfull-way, Which unto Life doth guide. By Thee, the Father we have known, Whom thou descendest from; And, unto Him, by Thee, alone, We hopefull are to come. 3 This, thou to Philip did impart, (And, this our Faith shall be) That, Thou within the Father art, And, that, He dwels in Thee. Of whom, what ever we in faith, And, in thy Name, require, We shall obtain (thy promise saith) As we ourselves desire. 4 Now, therefore, Lord, of thee we crave, That, we more Fruit may shew Of that which we received have; And, much more thankfull grow. That so the Truth we have beleev'd May not be taken from These Kingdomes; but, be here receiv'd Vntill thy Kingdome come. Hymn L. For Saint Barnabas Day. Barnabas, together with Saint Paul, was by the Holy-Ghost extraordinarily separated for the Ministry of the Gospel, and confirmed in the Apostleship, by the ordinary Discipline of laying on of hands; for which we take occasion to praise God, upon this Day. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] Rich Gifts, and Graces manifold, To many, thou, oh Lord, hast lent, Of late, and in the Dayes of old, To teach us Faith, and to repent. Thy Prophets thou didst first ordain; And, they as Legats did appear. Then, with an Apostolike-Train, In person, thou, a while, wert here. 2 For Legier, when thou went'st away, The Holy-Ghost thou didst appoint, Who, for thy Service (to this Day) From Time to Time, did some anoint. So likewise, brought it was to passe; That, to confirm what had been taught, An Army-royall, pressed was, Of Martyrs, who thy Battels fought. 3 For Those, and Him, for whom we thus Are met to praise thy Name this day, We give Thee Thanks; as they for us, (Before we were) to Thee did pray. And, by this dutie, we declare An evidence, that They and We, (Though we in Times, divided are) Have one Communion, still, with Thee. Hymn LI. For Saint John Baptist his Day. John called the Baptist (by whose Ministry the People were prepared to receive Christ, was prophecied of before his Comming. And this day is appointed both to praise God for the same; and to remember us by his example to prepare our hearts for the entertainment of our Saviour. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] Because the World might not pretend, It knew not of thy Coming-day; Thou didst, oh Christ, before Thee send A Cryer, to prepare thy Way. Thy Kingdome was the News, he brought Repentance, was the Way, he taught. 2 And that his Voice might not alone, Informe us what we should beleeve; His Life declar'd what must be done, By those who shall thy Faith receive. His Doctrine, therefore, let us heed, And in his holy path proceed. 3 Let us not haunt vain-pleasures Courts, With fruitlesse toyes, to feed the minde; Nor moved be with false Reports, Like Reeds, that shake with ev'ry winde. And, let our lives (though lesse austere) At least, be sober, and sincere. 4 Clad in Repentant-cloth of hair, Let us, (oh Christ) to seek out Thee, To those forsaken-walks repair, Which, by thy Saints affected be: And, that our lives we may amend, With true Repentance, us befriend. 5 Instruct us how to feed upon The Honey, of thy Word-divine; The Dainties of the Flesh to shun; Her Cups of Soul-bewitching-wine; And, on our Loines, let us have care The Belt of Temperance to wear. 6 So, thy Fore-Runner, Times last day, By his example, shall prepare Within Mans heart, both Place and Way, To give thee entertainment, there; And, thou to us, and We to Thee, Shall, (when thou comest) welcome be. Hymn LII. For Saint Peters Day. We observe this day, to honour God, in the pious Memoriall of his blessed Apostle Saint Peter, and that it might remember us not to presume on our own strength, by considering his failing, and falling from his over peremptorie Asseveration. We may learn also by his example, to bewaile our escapes, with teares of penitence. Sing this as the 1. Psalme. [1] How watchfull ought, we to become! How zealously to pray! That, Thee, oh Lord, we fall not from Vpon our Triall-day! For, if thy great Apostle said, He would not Thee deny, Yet, Thee, that very night denaid, On what should we relie? 2 Of our owne selves, we cannot leave Our pleasures, for thy sake; No, nor one vertuous Thought conceive Till, us thou able make. For, we not only Thee deny, When Troubles do increase; But, oft from Thee, we likewise fly, When pleasures we possesse. 3 Oh! let those Prayers us availe, Which were for Peter daign'd; That, when the Foe shall us assaile, His purpose be not gain'd. Yea, fixe on us those pow'rfull Eies, Which mov'd him to lament; That, we with Teares, and bitter Cries, Our Follies may repent. 4 And, grant that all, who him succeed (To oversee thy Folds) Thy Sheep and Lambs, may guide and feed, As they of duty should: No Doctrine teaching, saving, what Truth warrants them to preach; And in their Lives, confirming that Which they are bound to teach. Hymn LIII. For St. Iames his Day. This Day we glorifie God for his Apostle James, who was one of the two, for whom their Mother desired that they might sit, the one at his right hand, and the other at his left hand in his Kingdome: And by occasion of that Petition, they and others are taught what they should rather desire to obtain. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] They who their Father had forsook, And follow'd Christ at his command, (By humane frailtie overtook) Did for preferment, seeme to stand. But, by their Master they were taught, What fitteth an Apostles care; What should by them, be rather sought; And, what their chiefest honours are. 2 By them, we see much Folly grows, Where Virtues their best rooting take; And that the man which Wealth forgoes, May not Ambition quite forsake. And fear we may, that Sin resides In many Persons at this day, Who chosen are for Lights, and Guids, To shew to other men their way. 3 To Thee, therefore, oh Lord, we pray, That, humblenesse, in us may dwell, To charm that Fiend of Pride away, Which would thy Graces, quite expell. Vouchsafe thou, chiefly, those to keep From this Delusion of the Foe, Who are the Pastors of thy Sheep, And should each good Example show. 4 For, they who still pursuing be That Greatnesse, which the World respects, Their vanitie do neither see, Nor feel thy Spirits good effects. By them, prophanenesse doth increase; By them, Disunion, is begun, By them, the Church is robb'd of Peace; By them, the World will be undone. 5 He therefore, that will stop the Rent, Which his Ambitious aymes hath made, (Like this Apostle) must repent The vain Desires, which he hath had. For, he which to performe that Place, With Lowlinesse, himselfe applies, Endow'd is, with speciall-grace, And, shall to highest Honours rise. Hymn LIIII. For St. Bartholomews day. This Day is consecrated to the honour of God, in the pious memory of his Apostle St. Bartholomew: and, that (as appeares by a portion of Scripture appointed to be read this day, we might take occasion to praise our Redeemer for the many wonders wrought by his Apostles, to the edification of his Church; and to the confusion of her Foes. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] Exceeding gracious favours, Lord, To thy Apostles have bin shown; And, many wonders, by their word, And, in thy Name, by them were done. The Blind could see; the Dumbe could talk; The Deaf did hear; the Lame did walk. 2 They all Diseases took away; The Dead, to life, they did restore; Foul spirits, dispossessed they; And, preach'd thy Gospel to the poore. Whereby the Truth, still stronger grew, And, her Opposers overthrew. 3 Oh! let their works for ever be An honour to thy Glorious Name; And by thy pow'r, vouchsafe that we (Whom Sin makes deaf, blind, dumb, and lame, May hear thy Word, and see thy Light; And speak thy Truth, and walk upright. 4 Each mortall Sicknes of the Soul, Let thy Apostles Doctrines cure; Let it expell that spirit-foul, Which makes us lothsome and impure: That, we who dead in sin have lain, The life of saving-Faith may gain. Hymn LV. For St. Mathews-Day. St. Mathew was from the Office of a Custome-gatherer (which was odious to the Jewes) called to be an Apostle; and became one of the Evangelists. This day, therefore, is made observable, and set apart that God might be therein praised for the favour vouchsafed to the whole Church by his ministry. Sing this as the former. [1] Let no uncomely Censures passe Vpon those Callings men professe. A Publican, St. Mathew was, Yet, Gods elected nev'rthelesse. And was unto the Church of Christ, Apostle, and Evangelist. 2 For, GOD (who not a whit respects Profession, Person, or Degree) The Saints in partially elects, From ev'ry Sort of men that be; That, all might unto him repaire, And, no more of his Love despaire. 3 For those men, therefore, let us pray, Who seem uncalled, to remain; Not judging them quite cast away, Gods Favour never to obtain; Since, he by them perhaps doth prove, Our patience, and our Christian Love. 4 And, for our selves, let us desire That, Avarice we then may shun, When God that service doth require, Whereby his heav'nlie will is done. And let the remnant of our daies, Be spent in setting forth his praise. Hymn LVI. For the Day of St Michael, and all Angels. This Day we glorifie God for the ministration of his holy Angels, and for the assistance and protection, which he by them vouchsafeth us against the secret assaults and temptations of our spirituall Adversaries. St. Michael, is by St. Jude termed an Arch-Angell; by Daniel, he is called, Chiefe of the Princes; and some doe thinke that this Angel is Christ. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] To praise, oh God! and honour Thee For all thy glorious Triumphs won, Assembled here this day are we; And, to declare thy Favours done. Thou took'st that great Arch-Angels part, With whom in Heav'n the Dragon fought; And that good Armies, Captain wer't, Which cast-him, and his Angels out. 2 We gain'd thereby the firmer peace; Lesse are our dangers; lesse, our Fears; And, to thy, Glories great increase, Thy Kingdomes pow'r the more appears. Yea, now his malice and despight, Who in thy presence, heretofore, Accused us both day and night, Shall terrifie our Souls no more. 3 In honour of thy Blessed Name, This Hymn of Thanks, therefore we sing; And, to thine everlasting Fame Of praise, Heav'ns arched Sphear shall ring. With praise, for thy Essentiall-might, With praise, for all those Angels too, Who thy victorious Battels fight, And, here on Earth, thine Errands do. 4 For, many of that glorious Troop (To bring us messages from thee) Have pleased bin, from Heav'n to stoop; And, cloth'd with humane shape to be. Yea, we believe they watch and ward, About our Persons, evermore, From evill-Spirits, us to guard: And, we return Thee Thanks, therefore. Hymn LVII. For St. Lukes Day. This Day we celebrate Gods praise for the great priviledges vouchsafed to his Church by the blessed Evangelist Lvke, a Physitian both for Body and Soule, and the first and best Ecclesiasticall Historiographer. Hee was a constant companion of St. Paul, and an example of Christian perseverance to all posteritie. Sing this as the former. [1] If those Physitians honor'd be, Who corporall diseases heal; Sure, worthy double praise is he Who seeks both Soul and Bodies weal. Both waies this Blessed Saint excel'd, Both waies, in life he was approv'd; And, by his Gospel hath reveal'd What many Soul-bred pains remov'd. 2 To do him honour, this, beside, A blessed witnes, hath declar'd, That firme in Faith he did abide, When others from the Truth were scar'd. There of the Glorie, Lord, be thine; For, him thy Grace enabled thus: And he received those Gifts divine, To benefit himself and us. 3 By his example, therefore, Lord, Vphold us, that we fall not from The true profession of thy Word, Nor by the World, be overcome. And, grant, his holy Gospel may Yeeld cordiall comforts to the Soul, To drive those maladies away, Which make it faithles, faint, and foul. Hymn LVIII. For St. Simon and Judes day. This day, we honour God for his two Apostles, Simon called Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James, as is manifested by a portion of Scripture, appointed to be read on this day, and by which we are put in minde that we continue in brotherly Love, and in that estate of Grace to which we are called. Sing this as the 23. Psalme. [1] No outward mark have we to know Who, thine, oh Christ, shall be, Vntill our Christian Love doth show, What Soul pertains to Thee. For, some, a Faith can counterfeit, And, likely Virtues fain; But, till true Charitie they get, Their Faith, and Works are vain. 2 Love is that Sum of those Commands, Which Thou, to Thine didst leave: And, for a mark, on them it stands Which never can deceive. For, when our Knowledge, foolish turnes; When Showes, no shew retain; VVhen fiery-zeal to nothing burnes, Then Love shall firme remain. 3 By this, were thy Disciples knit, And, joyned so in One; Their True-Love-knot, could never, yet, Be broken or undone. Oh! let us Lord inserted be Into that sacred Knot; And, be so knit, to them and Thee, That Sin undoe us not. 4 Yea, lest when we thy grace possesse, VVe therefrom fall away, (Or turn it into wantonnesse) Assist thou us, we pray. And, that we may the better find, VVhat heed is to be learn'd, Let us the Fall of Angels mind, As holy Jude hath warn'd. Hymn LIX. For troublesome, and dangerous Times. No Kingdome is alwaies free from troublesome and dangerous Times. Therefore Hymns of consolation; and such as may move to penitence, or preserve the minde patiently contented with GODS Visitations in that kind, are necessary for uncomfortable Seasons, and will no doubt, be both liked, and used by some. Sing this as, VVE praise thee oh God. [1] Now are the Times; These are the Daies, VVhich will those men approve, VVho take delight in honest-Waies, And pious-Courses love. Now, to the VVorld, it will appear, That Innocence of heart, VVill keep us far more free from fear, Then Helmet, Shield, or Dart. 2 A cunning Polititians Brain, A wealthy Merchants-purse, A Princely Style, a Portly Train; (Though with a publike Curse) (In Grace to be with Lords and Kings, And, of their Slaves admir'd) A while agoe, seem'd glorious Things; And, most to be desir'd. 3 But fully Ripe now Sins are come, And bring those Plagues-foretold; Which make the Times grow perilsome, Good-Conscience passeth Gold. And, they the bravest Lots possesse, Which may on earth be had, Who by an Inward-Happines Are safe, and fearles made. 4 As Lions they couragious are, Now mischiefs most increase. And, though still dreadfull newes they hear, Their Courage doth increase. For, now, they see be drawing nigh, And, hast'ning to requite, Their Insolence, and Tiranny, Who did in wrongs delight. 5 And why should Innocencie grieve, That, liv'd it hath to see Fulfilled; what it did believe, And could foretell, should be? Yea, why should it be discontent, That, GOD hath verifi'd His threat'nings, by a sad event, On those who Truth decide? 6 What can it lose, now broiles increase? Or Fear, in Times of blood? Which was opprest in Times of Peace; And Ill receiv'd for Good? Since none doth grudge to see his Field, Stubd up, and set on fire; That usefull Fruits, the soile may yeeld, In stead of Bush and Bri'r. 7 The best which could have hoped bin, By long abused Rest; Was that our Follies, and our Sin, Should more have bin increast. For, though some have bewail'd the Time, And Reformation sought; But, few do sorrow for their crimes, Or, mend themselves in ought. 8 Yea, few had either fear or sense, Of Justice, in their waies; Or favour'd much, that Innocence Which giveth peacefull daies. We, therefore are afflicted thus; And God, hath powred now, A Violl of his wrath on us, That we might wiser grow. 9 Like those Egyptians if we be, Whose hearts obdurate grow, All his old plagues, in store hath he, Our Follies to pursue; But by returning unto him, We, yet may scape the smart, That without Mercy, fals on them, Which have a hard'ned heart. 10 Lord, this effect, vouchsafe to grant In these our Troublous Times. Let our lost Peace, which now we want, Reclaim us from our Crimes. So whether we shall die or live, Till better Daies we see; This Troublous Time we shall perceive, A Time of Grace to be. 11 For Pestilences, Deaths, and War, To them, who shall repent. Not Evill, but Good-Angels are, For their amendment sent: And Righteous men, sometime, by these, In Love, are taken from Those worse, and those more dreadfull daies; Which must on others come. 12 Prepare, and fit me, LORD, therefore, With meek, and humble mind, To meet thy Judgements at the dore; And, take the Lot I find. And, if I shall be one of those, Who for example sake, Must suffer by these publike-woes, On me thy pleasure take. 13 But, LORD, remember Mercy still, (Thy Sword, through Justice drawes) Yea, though to bring this publike Ill, My Sins, in part, were cause; Remember too, that I am one (A Sinner, though it be) Who grieves, for what I have misdone, And put my trust in Thee. Hymn LX. Another for the like Times. The Faithfull are by this Hymn put in mind of that securitie which may be obtained, by depending on God, in Times of publike Calamitie, and remembred also thereby to strengthen their Faith by earnestly seeking Gods assistance, and protection, in such Times of Perill and Feare. Sing this as the 25. Psalme. [1] Inform'd we are, oh LORD! That they who trust in Thee, And, can depend upon thy Word, Shall free from danger be. To those, thou shalt become A strong defensive Tow'r, To save when Times are perilsome, From him that would devour. 2 The Shaft which kils by day, On them shall not alight; The Plague which doth at midnight slay, Shall do them no despight. How e're the Planets move; What ever their Aspects May seem to threaten from above, They shall have good Effects. 3 Their Feet unharm'd shall tread, The Viper, Worme, and Aspe: With Angry Lyons, without dread Or danger, they shall graspe: From Foes, they shall be safe; Though great their Haters be, And at their Furie, they shall laugh Though them enrag'd they see. 4 When Death on ev'ry side, Ten thousands takes away, They shall, by Faith be fortifide; And, live without dismay. Yea, full they shall be fed When hungry Times appear: And, shall of nothing, stand in dread, When they Sad-Rumors hear. 5 Lord, thus, thou dost befriend (When Times of Trouble be) Thy Faithfull Servants, who depend Vnfainedly on Thee. On me, Lord, this high grace, Vouchsafe thou to bestow: For at this Time, and in this Place, Are Fears, and Perils now. 6 Let not my many Crimes, Which have assistance brought To bring thy Judgements on these times, Now bring my Hopes to naught. But, let me so repent, My Courses lewd and vain, That in this publick punishment, I, private Grace may gain. 7 So constant, make my heart; (What ever Newes I hear) That, from no duties I depart, By an unmanly Fear: Nor by a carnall doubt, Those Christian-Hopes forgoe, Whose Losse, may tire my Patience out; Or, Saving-Faith o'rethrow. 8 But, LORD, let me remain To thee, so reconcil'd, That Sobernes I may refrain, Though all the World grow wild. Be thou my blessed Lot, VVhen Outrage doth increase; And, to their Furie leave me not, That are the Foes of Peace. 9 Preserve this Hopelesse Place, And our disturbed State, From those that have more wit, then grace, And prudent Counsels hate: Yea, let the Plagues they cause On those alone descend, Whom neither Grace, nor Vengeance, drawes Their manners to amend. 10 If any Sprouts of mine, Shall these Ill-Times out-grow, To keep them, LORD, for ever thine The life of Grace bestow. And, rather let them die In want, and with disgrace, Then live on earth to multiplie A wicked princely Race. 11 Yea, whatsoever care, Or Troubles we are in, Preserve in us a Conscience clear From ev'ry wilfull Sin. And, in thy Faith and Love, So firme, let us abide; That, by these Troubles we may prove, Like Silver seven times tride. 12 If this I shall obtain, As, I believe I shall; Though Fire and Brimstone down it rain, It should not me appall. For, when each earthly Thing, Burnes round me in a flame. I HALELVJAH hope to sing, In honour of thy Name. Finis secundæ partis.</field>

We that are Britans enjoy many peculiar Priviledges; and have obtained sundry Blessings and Deliverances famously observable. We are therefore obliged to a speciall Thankfulnesse, not only as we are Christian-men, but as we are Britans also. And this Hymn intends the furtherance of that duty. Halelvjah, now I sing.

We presume not to instruct Soveraign Princes, but have only composed, in a brief Hymn, a few of those many things which are pertinent to their considerations; and perhaps an humble Pietie may by this Occasion, otherwhile invite their Excellencies to expresse their devotions in this or some other Hymn. Sing this as the 4 Psalme. [1] By me, or by my Father's house, Deserv'd it could not be; That I, or any one of us, Obtained this degree: But, God who dealeth forth his own, As him it liketh best, On me those honours hath bestown, Whereof I am possest. 2 Great hazards, many undergo Such Titles to acquire; Yet, neither finde content below, Nor means of rising higher. What, therefore, can I lesse repay To him, whose Gift it is, Then, otherwhile, to sing or say, Some such like Hymn, as this? 3 Let me, oh Lord, my Diadem, Vnto thy glory, we are; And, be a blessing unto them, Who my Lieg-people are. Let not thy favours make my heart To swell with wanton pride; Or, from those Precepts to depart, Which ought to be my guide. 4 But, teach me still in minde to beare, From whom, this place I had; And that ev'n they my brethren are, Whose Ruler I was made: Yea, cause me, evermore, to heed That, I, and they, are thine; Although, to serve the publike-need, Their Goods, and Lives are mine. 5 Since ev'ry Subjects Cause, to me, Should equally be dear; In Justice, let the Poor man be As precious, as the Peer. And, lest men snares for me, may make, At my Chief Counsell board, Lord, let me daily Counsell take, From thy Truth-speaking word. 6 Those Traitors chase out of my Court, Who dare pervert the Laws; Or, cause me by a false report, To wrong an honest Cause. And, let thy Judgements them devour, (How strong soere they stand) Who shall abuse my royall powre, To hinder thy Command. 7 Within my Realm, let no man dare My Statutes, to gain-say: And, let me live as much in fear, Thy Laws, to disobay. So, I, and they, whom thou on me, For Subjects, hast bestown; Shall in each other, blessed be, And, keep Sedition down. 8 Preserve to me, my Royall dues: And, Grace vouchsafe me, still, My just Prerogatives, to use, According to thy will. That, Evill men may fear my frown; The Righteous, comfort finde; And, I, obtain a better Crown, When this must be resign'd. Hymn III. For a Subject. Subjects are apt to complain if they seem to suffer by their Soveraigns; but, few examine what cause they themselves are of their own Grievances; as few are thankfull for the Benefits received by Good Princes; for prevention whereof this Hymn is tendred. Sing this as the former. [1] A sov'raigntie, though some obtain, Who use their pow'r amisse; Yet, when the same they shall obtain, Thy Gift, oh God! it is; And, those whom thou dost raise thereto, We, therefore, should obay, In all that Subjects ought to do, To suffer, or to pay. 2 VVhen Tyrants over us are set, They for our Sins are sent; And, righteous-Princes, we shall get, When we our faults repent. But whether good or bad they be; Thy Rod, and Sword, they bear; And, we in them, shall honour thee, If still, we loyall are. 3 Our stubborn hearts, oh Lord! incline This dutie, to fulfill. To ev'ry Substitute of thine, Subject our froward will; But, teach us, chiefly to beware, We grieve nor injure those, Whose Prudence, Justice, love and care, Protects us, from our Foes. 4 Let us afford them all supplies, Which their Affairs may need; Admitting no such Tales or lies, As may suspition breed. But, let us praise, where praise is due; And (when they merit blame) Not prove, like Noahs cursed Son, Divulgers of their shame. 5 So, they our Pietie, shall blesse, VVhen they their error see; And, thou oh God! wilt give us peace, Because we loyall be. For, when a people, conscience makes Their Soveraign to obay; God makes him gracious, for their sakes, Or, takes him, soon, away. Hymn IIII. For a Magistrate. The corruption of Magistrates, is the more frequent through defect of some to remember them of their duties. Therefore, because it is not safe, nor thought comely, for every one to undertake that office, we have added this Hymn, that they might otherwhile, be thereby Remembrancers to themselves. Sing this as the X. Commandements. [1] Fvll well, that person, it beseems, Who should reform the Sinners way, To rid his eyes, of motes, and beams; And, live as blamelesse, as he may: For, he that lewd example shews, The Rod of Rule, in vain doth bear; And with his left-hand overthrows, What, with his Right hand, he doth rear. 2 If, justly, I reprov'd may be, For that, which I in others blame; It is a double-sin in me, That meriteth a double-shame. Or if I should for Friend or Foe, For bribe, for favour, fear, or hate. In doing Justice partiall grow; As great a plague, is due, for that. 3 A Bribe, hath pow'r to fool the wise: Pride, scorns to hear the poor-mans mone: Lust, putteth forth discretions eyes: Hate, cannot see when wrong is done: Self-love, prefers her proper cause: Fear, will his dearest Friend betray. Ambition, will pervert the Laws. And sloth all duties will delay. 4 From these things Lord, preserve me clear; And, from their proud and foolish wit, Who, at offenders, scoffe and Jeer, When on the Judgement-seat they sit. And, this moreover, I desire; Me, from their basenesse still defend, Who dare to publike-place, aspire, That, it may serve a private-end. 5 With wisdom, so my minde indue, That, I my passions may subject; And, by examples, alway, shew What things in others, I expect. With courage, arme, likewise, my heart: That, (having laudably begun) I do not cowardly depart From perfiting, what should be done. 6 And, teach thou me, to temper so Faire-means, with discipline-severe, That, Mercy may with Justice, go; And, in correction, Love appear. Yea, so meek-hearted make thou me, That, when offenders I condemn, My heart may feel how sad they be; And, suffer grief, in judging them. Hymn V. For a member of the Parliament. It is necessary that the Rule whereby things are to be regulated should be streight: and therefore, Lawmakers ought to be VVise and uprightmen, lest the chief Remedy of our Evils, be made worse then the Evils themselves. To the Members of our high Court of Parliament, this is well known; yet, this Hymn, shall perhaps, be a means to remember some of them of that which they know. Sing this as the 4 Psalme. [1] They, no mean place of Trust, receive, VVho by free-choice have gain'd, That Facultie Legislative, VVhich I have now obtain'd. For, they have ample Pow'r, from those, By whom, they chosen be, In Temporall-Things, to binde, and lose, As they just Cause, do see. 2 VVho e're, therefore, they be, that shall Ambiciously Affect, To fill such Roomes, before those call, VVho, freely, should elect; VVho e're those be; they, more presume, Then Justice doth permit; And, more, unto themselves, assume, Then Reason judgeth fit. 3 VVhoe're likewise, for private ends, For Favour, Fear, or hate; To harm his Foes; To please his Friends: Or, save his own Estate: Yea, whosoer'e his dearest Blood, (Or, those by Him, begot) Prefers before the Common-good; This Trust, deserveth not. 4 Law-givers personate a Part, VVhich doth in them, require, A Prudent-Brain, an Vpright-Heart, A rectifide-Desire: For, who beleeves that they can give, To others, Laws-upright? VVho, lewdly Talk, prophanely Live, And, in vain Things delight? 5 Imprudent Legislators, may Much greater Mischiefs cause, And, Innocencie more betray, Then they that break the Laws. For, He that many Laws doth breake, May wrong but one or two: But they which one Bad Law shall make, VVhole Kingdomes may undo. 6 Inspire me Lord with grace, therefore, VVith Wisdom, and Stout Zeal, And, with uprightnesse, evermore, To serve the Common-weale. And, so to serve, that, their offence, (At all times) I may shun, Who serve it so, as if the Prince, And Kingdome, were not one. 7 He that with one of these partakes, Vnto the others wrong, VVhat goodly shew soe're he makes, VVill injure both ere long. Yea, whatsoever such pretend; (VVhat ere they swear, or say) They, will be Traitors, in the end, And, one, or both, betray. Hymn VI. For a member of our Convocations, or Nationall Synods. It is the greatest Bondage, next that of Sin, and the Devill, to be enslaved by Doctrine, or Discipline, repugnant to the VVord of God; and injurious to the Christian Libertie. Therefore, though I presume not to prepare a Hymn, worthy to be sung by so reverend an Assembly: yet, I think it no Arrogancie, to make tender of this Meditation to be, otherwhile, privately sung, or considered, by some Members thereof. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] Since, by Election, I am sent, To be admitted one of those Who shall that Body represent, Which hath a pow'r to bind and lose; That for this work, I fit may be, Lord! let thy Spirit hallow me. 2 Here let me lay each Aime aside, Which to so vain a purposetends. As to advance our Clergy-Pride, Or serve our Avaritious ends: And, me from those things, keep thou far, By which corrupted Synods are. 3 As much as in my pow'r it lies, Let me out of thy Church, exile Not only, those old-Heresies, Which former Ages did beguile; But, with a prudent zeal, pursue Those Errors, likewise, which are new. 4 Let me preserve that sweet accord, Which in such Counsels ought to be. Make thou the Canon of thy Word, In every Cause, a Guide for me: And, let it rule my words and waies, What ever Humane-Reason saies. 5 Confirm in me, a holy Care, To keep thy outward Service pure, From Rites, that superstitious are; Or, which contempt thereto procure. That whil'st Will-Worship I do shun, I may not to prophanenesse run. 6 For no mans pleasure, let me stop, The Christian-Freedomes, GRACE bestowes, Nor giveth Flesh a larger scope Then pious Prudencie allowes; But grant me wisdome, Lord, to know When things-Indifferent are not so. 7 And me, and Them; who in this place To do thee service, now are chose, Inspire, ô God, with ev'ry Grace, Which to thy Saints thou do'st dispose; That, all the Canons we decree, May thy good Spirits dictates be. Hymn VII. For a Courtier. Courtiers are so frequently vitious, that some thinke it impossible they should be virtuous. By the use of this Hymn, the scandall if that censure may be abated, and the honour and honesty of well-deserving Courtiers may be the better preserved. Sing this as the 23 Psalme, or Te Deum. [1] Though Princes Courts defamed are, As blurr'd with ev'ry sin; Yet, men whose Virtues blameles were, Have famous Courtiers bin. In Pharaohs house, chast Josephs waies, Obtain'd a good report; And Obadiah liv'd with praise, In wicked Ahabs Court. 2 Wise Daniell, dar'd the truth to say, Where flatt'ry did abound: Within the breast of Mordecai, An honest heart was found. And many more, of glorious name, Have Love with Honour gain'd; And, kept in Court, a spotles fame, Where evill Princes raign'd. 3 The Calling, therefore, or the Place Makes not our manners ill; But, rather want of heed and grace, To certifie the Will. And, no occasion, place, or time, Wants means, a snare to lay Ill habits to beget in him, That heedeth not his way. 4 Him, had not Obadiah serv'd, By whom, poore Naboth bled, The Prophets had bin slain or starv'd, Whom he in secret fed. And should all Good-men shun that King, Which doth in Vice delight, His Lands to ruine it would bring; And, root out Virtue, quite. 5 Lord, as thou do'st my Will renew, Renew my Reason too; And, Grace vouchsafe me to pursue, What I am bound to doe. Let nor Oppression, Lust nor Pride, (Which rise in Courtiers grow) Allure my heart, or feet, aside From what I purpose now. 6 So, though the Place in which I live, As bad a name had got, As that, which heretofore, did grieve The Soul of Righteous Lot; I shall from ev'ry crying Sin, Abide in Court, as free, As they who being Cloystred in, Securer seem to be. Hymn VIII. For a Master or Mistresse. It is a great happinesse to have good Servants to ease our labours: Wee are hereby therefore put in Remembrance to be thankfull for that blessing, when we have it; and how to behave our selves toward our Servants. If a Woman sing it, let her change the word Master into Mistresse. Sing this as the 100. Psalme. [1] In that a Master, I was made, God's favour doth to me appear, And, sure this grace, I never had, Injuriously to domineer. But, rather that with better ease, I might my Calling undergoe; And, thankfully him seek to please, By whom I am befriended so. 2 How great a blisse do many share, (Without regard what they enjoy) That, they their heavie lodes to bear, The Limbs of others may employ? And, that their pleasures to purvay, (Aswell as for their daily meat) Their Servants travell out the day, And, labour both in cold and heat? 3 Lord! cause me thankfully to mind, This gracious bounty of thy hand; And, to be mercifull and kind, To them, whose bodies I command. Let me remember, that we are One flesh, and branches of one stem. And, that, as well as I, they bear His Image, who redeemed them. 4 When frowardnes in them I see, When they without a cause repine, When negligent or false they be, Or Prodigall of what is mine; Let me by these their failings view, How, in thy service, I offend: How many wayes I am untrue; And, wink at them, till I amend. 5 Far be it, from me to detain My Servants hire; or, to deny Due rest; or, when he shall complain, To grieve him with a harsh reply; But, since thy Servant, Lord I am, To them so gracious let me be, That (though I often merit blame) Thou may'st be mercifull to me. Hymn IX. For a Servant. That Servants may be kept from discouragement in their inferiour Calling; and stirred up to discharge their duties with cheerfulnesse, and singlenesse of heart; this Hymn, or some other such like meditations, may be very pertinent to those that are Servants. Sing this as the former. [1] Discourage not thy self my Soul, Nor murmur, though compel'd we be To live subjected to controule, When many other may be free: For, though the pride of some disdains Our mean, and much dispised Lot; We shall not lose our honest pains, Nor shall our suff'rance be forgot. 2 To be a Servant, is not base; If basenes be not in the mind: For, Servants make but good the place, Whereto their Maker them assign'd. The greatest Princes do no more: And, if sincerely I obay, (Though I am now despis'd and poore) I shall become as great as they. 3 The Lord of heav'n and earth was pleas'd A Servants forme to undertake: By his endurance I am eas'd; And, serve with gladnes for his sake. Though check'd unjustlie I should be, With silence, I reproofs will bear: For, much more injured was he, Whose deeds, most worthy praises were. 4 He was revil'd, yet naught repli'd; And I will imitate the same: For, though some faults may be deni'd, In part, I alwaies faultie am. Content (with meek and humble heart) I will abide in my degree; And, act an humble Servants part, Till God shall call me to be free. 5 Eie-service I resolve to shun; And, when my duty can be known, It shall as faithfully be done, As if the profit were mine own So, whensoever I shall need The service of anothers hand; He shall in heart, in tongue, in deed, Be faithfull unto my command. 6 But, whatsoever, else I find, This will befall to me, at least, That, I shall keep a quiet mind, To give my wearie Bodie rest. And, when those works dispatch I shall, Wherein I must this life imploy, My Lord and Master, me will call, To be a partner of his Joy. Hymn X. For a Gentleman. Many boast of their Gentilitie, who degenerate from their worthy Ancestors, and neglect that which is the essence of Nobilitie. To abate this folly where it is found, and to cherish true worth in the virtuous Gentrie, we have offered this meditation. Sing this as the 23. Psalme. [1] It is the common guize of such Who least deserving be, Of their Descents to prattle much; Or, vant of their Degree; As if, they meerly were begot, To act no other part, Then blazing of their Grandsires coat, Or telling his desart. 2 Of inward Rest, and outward Health, Some Fools themselves bereave; That they may honor'd Names, or Wealth, Vnto their Children leave, Who (many times) when they possesse What others did provide, Consume it all in Idlenes, In Ryot, Lust, or Pride. 3 Yea, that which their dear Souls might cost, Who first enrich'd their name, May to their seed, be worse then lost, And, end their line with shame. For, most who rich or noble grow By that which others won, The value of it, seldome know, Till all, again, be gon. 4 The ancient-marks of gentle-blood, Were well to be imploy'd; To love and follow what was good; And, evill to avoyd: For which God so did blesse the Race, Descended from their Stem, That many Ages, in one place, He hath continu'd them. 5 But, now, each other to outvie In wickednes of life, In pride, or prodigalitie, Is practised in chief. For which Gods wrath so roots them out, That, sign is hardly seen, Before two Ages wheel about, That they on earth have been. 6 Or if their Monuments have been Allow'd a longer date, It is to memorize the Sin, Which ruin'd their estate: That, others heeding in their way, And, what therein ensu'd, The more sincerely labour may, With grace to be endu'd. 7 Oh Lord, incline me to delight In reall-Virtues, more Then, those Achievements to recite, Which my Forefathers wore. And, those whom I in birth exceed, Let me endeavour well, That them, in ev'ry noble-deed, I may as much excell. 8 As thou thy blessings do'st increase, Increase thy Grace in me; With ev'ry reall worthines, Becomming my degree. That, to my self, or to my kin, I bring nor grief nor shame; But live to be (as they have bin) An honour, to my Name. Hymn XI. For a Knight of the Garter. This Hymn was composed for the Knights of the Garter, to be sung in their Chappell at their Festivall. It sheweth how their Honours and civill Triumphs, may be directed to the honour of God, and to the more dignifying of their honourable-Order of Knighthood, &amp;c. Sing this as Te Deum. [1] All praise and glory that we may Ascribe we Lord, to Thee From whom, the Triumphs of this day, And all our honors be. For, of it self, nor East, nor West, Doth honour ebbe or flow; But, as to thee it seemeth best, Preferment to bestow. 2 Thou Christ, art that victorious Knight, Whose order we professe; And our Saint George, to whom in fight Our Cries, we do addresse. The Dragon which thou foil'dst is He, That, would thy Church devour; And, that faire Princesse, LORD, is She, Who scaped by thy pow'r. 3 Thou art that Husbandman, whose care Makes Rich our barren soile. Thou art that valiant Man of War, Who keeps our Coasts from spoile. Vouchsafe that we, who by a Band More bound then heretofore, May to thy Faith's-Defendor, stand Fast Friends, for evermore. [4] Since, by our Soveraigne, chose we are, This Order to put on; And, since we Hieroglyphicks wear, Of that which thou hast done: Lest we forget it, let these tell Why they by us are worn; And inwardly informe, as well As outwardly adorn. 5 So shall our Order unto none A vain Invention seem; Nor our Solemnities be done Without their due esteem. And, they who have the Saint mistook, On whom, we do rely; Shall know, we only Thee invoke; When we Saint George is a Name or Attribute applyed to GOD, Iohn 15. 2. My Father, saith Christ, ? ??????? ???? is the George, or Husbandman: and the story of Saint George rescuing a Lady from a Dragon, is an Allegory setting forth the Churches deliverance from the Devill by her celestiall champion Iesus Christ. And by this application we avoid the scandall which may else be taken by a seeming to invoke, the assistance of some other divine power beside God-Almighty, when in our warlike expeditions we cry (as the English custome is) GOD and Saint George. George do cry. Hymn XII. For Parents hopefull of children. In this Hymn Parents are instructed how they should be affected toward their Children; what endowments they should most desire for them, and what Patrimony they should most labour to procure them. Sing this as the 1 Psalme. [1] The propagation of our kinde, Our Nature moves us to; Yet, few of us, can rightly minde, The end, of what we do. Like brutish Creatures, most fulfill What Flesh and blood desires; But, think not, either good or evill, Of that, which God inspires. 2 And, when our Children reach the birth; Of most, receiv'd they are, Like Sons and Daughters, of the Earth, In whom no Spirit were. For to their flesh more love we bear, Then to that blessed Spark, Which, being gone, their Bodies are Like Dunghils in the dark. 3 If they be faire, and streightly limb'd, Great pleasure we can take: To keep their bodies nearly trim'd, Much needlesse work, we make. That, Rich, or noble they might be, No labours we do spare: And, if of these no hope we see, We seem opprest with care. 4 But of the Soul (that heav'nly seed) So carelesse, many seem, As if it were not worthy heed, Much lesse, of their esteem. And, had not God, from whom it came, His holy Church prepar'd, To be a Mother to the same, Full hardly, had it far'd. 5 Blest Father of that blessed-part, My just request receive, Who beg of thee, with yearning heart, For that which now I crave; Let from my Loines, no fruit descend, That, happy shall not be, By perseverance to the end, In dearly loving thee. 6 I beg not for them, wit, or wealth, Nor long, nor easie life; Nor Beautie, honour, strength, nor health, Nor Husband, Child, nor Wife; These, for themselves, let them request, And, those Requests acquire, As they in proof, to them, are best In furthering this desire: [7] Though Nature longs for somewhat more, Lord, let thy Will be done. I cannot now, for ought implore, Not granted to thy Son; Some other time, perhaps I may For, other things, entreat: And, that obtain, for which I pray, Because, thy love is great. Hymn XIII. For Parents having Children. Parents by this Hymn of praise and prayer, are by the example of holy Job, put in minde to offer daily sacrifices for their Children. A sacrifice of Praise for the Comfort they have of them and a Sacrifice of Prayer for their prosperitie. Sing this as the former. [1] Job's custome, well deserveth praise, Who, for his Childrens sake: Observed solemn offring dayes, Their peace with God to make. And, whether Feast or Fast they shall, The very same, to do, Is, now, as comely, for us all, And, still, as needfull too. 2 Of Praise, and Prayer, therefore, to thee An Offring, Lord, I give: Accepted let my praises be; And, my requests receive. I thank thee that a Parents name, Thy Servant, yet enjoyes, And, that the comforts of the same, No sad mishap destroyes. 3 I praise thee, for the hopes I hold, Of blessings, yet to come, Which (if thy mercie faile me should) My Sins, might bar me from. And, I beseech thee, not to heed, With an aspect severe, The many sins which in my seed, May to thy sight appear. 4 From those ill customes, which beget Habituated Sins; From those ill counsells, which do let The Works that Grace begins; From those lewd Mates, who poyson youth, By sweeting Vices bayts; Lord, keep my Children by thy Truth, From these, and their deceits. 5 From Sathans wiles through ev'ry age, Protected let them be; From crying-sins, from passions rage, Preserve them all so free. And, of the worlds prosperities, Bestow on me and mine; Nor more nor lesse, then may suffice To keep us, alwaies, thine. Hymn XIIII. For Parents who have lost their Children. This consolatory Hymn, may be usefull for Parents, who being deprived of all their Children, are nigh oppressed with grief; for, they are hereby remembred, that (all casualties considered) they may have as much cause to rejoyce as grieve. Sing this as the Lamentation. [1] Qvite lost, are now mine ayerie Joyes, Once promis'd by a fruitfull wombe: For my Dear-issue, Death destroies; And, full of grief, I am become. Those eyes, whereon I lov'd to look; The Voices, which made glad mine eare; Are out of sight, and hearing, took: And, shall no more delight me, here. 2 I am a plant whose leaves are cropt; Whose pleasant fruit is pluck'd away; Whose hopefull branches, down are lopt; And left without a living-Spray. To call me Father none is left; My Songs, to mournfull tunes are made, And, all the pleasures are bereft, Which in a Childe, I might have had. 3 Yet, all rejoycing is not gone; For, in my sorrows, comforts be: Because, the Soul which I bemone, Is found of God, though lost to me. And as those hopes are frustrate made Wherein I would have took delight; Even so the Feares I should have had, Prevented are, and put to flight. 4 By want, by sicknesse, or disgrace, By folly or by wilfull sin, My seed, in this unsteddy place; To me great sorrows might have bin. But I (who now do hope the best And see the worst that can succeed) From all such fears, am now releast; And, from ten thousand doubtings, freed. 5 This, likewise, adds to my content That while I militant shall be, God, his Triumphant-Church, augments, By, thereto, making use of me: I, therefore, with a ready Will, And with our humble heart, resign To him, (his pleasure to fulfill) My Seed; my Self; and all that's mine. Hymn XV. For such as are Barren. Barrennesse, is objected by some as a Reproach, and many are much discomforted thereby This Ode hath for their Comfort, therefore, briefly expressed such things as may be helpfull to prevent, or mitigate, their disconsolation. [1] You, that, in Children fruitfull are, Vpbraid ye not, the barren-wombe; As though, the carnall-seed you bear, Should make you happy to become. Nor let it much afflict thy heart, Who canst not of that blessing boast, As if, (because thou childlesse art) The, best contentments, quite, were lost. 2 In thinking so, we are beguild: For, blisse depends not thereupon. Though Hannah joyed in her childe; By Children, Eli, was undone. Nay she that bare the blessed-birth, (Though in so suffring, blest she were) Had many Sorrows here on earth, Occasion'd by the Childe she bare. 3 If to prolong their carnall care A blisse therein essentiall, had Then, Cain more blest then Abel was, And, Cham a blessed man was made. Then, he, whom Ravens came to feed; And, he, that was by him, fore-shown, Had left behind then carnall seed, And, this way, blessed, should have grown. 4 Yea, he that us by Grace, begot, Did carnall fruitfulnesse neglect, And, therefore, sure, it profits not, The best perfections to effect. Nay, many times it rather lets, That happinesse, which here, is sought: For, man sometimes a childe begets; By whom, to ruine; he is brought. 5 When outward-things away are worn, They shall to us become as dear, Whom others have begot or born, As these whom we beget or bear. And, he effects a greater good, Who gives to one, a ghostly birth, Then he, who gets of flesh and blood, Enough to people all the earth. 6 I, therefore will not grieve nor pine, That in the flesh, I barren seem: But, seek an Off-spring, more divine, And, covet fruit of more esteem. My minde hereafter, I will give The seed of Grace, to entertain, And, that blest issue to conceive, Which needs not to be born-again. 7 The bread, my Children should have eat, The cloth, I purpos'd they should wear, May be the needy Orphanes meat; And, Robes for them, who naked are. The Tendance which they should have had, Vpon the sick, may be bestown. And others may be happy made, By what (perhaps) had mard mine own. 8 Yea, peradventure, to this end, The Wombe is closed unto me; That, I on God, might more attend, And, Parent, to his Children, be. Wherein, if I perform his will; He, that knows what befits us best, Shall then in me his words fulfill; Who said, the barren should be blest. Hymn XVI. For Children, having Parents living. Children consider not as they ought the many benefits which they enjoy by their Parents. Therefore, to beget in them thankfulnesse, dutifulnesse, and a serious heedfulnesse of the blessing, possessed by the life of their Parents, this Hymn is tendred to their use. Sing this as the 4 Psalme. [1] Among these blessings which on me, Thou dost, oh Lord, bestow, For that, my Parents living be, Least thanks, I do not owe. Because, things needfull they provide, My Body, to sustain; And, my unruly youth to guide, Take, hourely, care and pain. 2 As, happie, made, in them, I am; In me, so blesse thou them; That, them I neither grieve nor shame, Nor their advise contemn. But, them so let me still obay, And, so, in grace, encrease; That, long, with comfort live they may; And, end their dayes in peace. 3 The Being, which to me they gave, Do thou, for me, requite; And, that well-being, let them have, In which they shall delight. As in my Childhood, kinde they were, Though often I transgrest) So, with such frailties, let me bear, As may Old Age molest. 4 My Body was in them begun; Their Souls, and mine, in thee: When, therefore, this lifes Round is run, Divided let's not be. But in thy Path, so teach our feet, To travell without blame; That, we, at last, in thee, may meet, From whence, at first, we came. Hymn XVII. For Orphans. In this Hymn, Orphans are taught so to consider their losse and disadvantage in being deprived of their Parents, that it may stir them up to a firm dependance on God, and to be thankfull for his mercifull Providence. Sing this as the former. [1] Bvt that I may on thee, oh Lord, And, on thy help depend, (Because I have thy gracious word, Poor Orphans, to defend) I should become so overprest With sorrows, or with fear, That, of safe-being, or of Rest, Small hope, would now appear. 2 For, they who should from wrong protect; And, needfull things purvay, Yea, they who should my Course direct; Are taken quite away. And snares, oppressions, and deceits, Are multiplied so, That, of their Force, or of their sleights; I still, in danger go. 3 To thee, therefore, in my distresse, My voice, advanc'd I have, Thy former Mercies, to confesse, And, future help to crave. For, meerely of thy love, it was, That, I am undestroy'd; And, that, I thus confesse whose grace, Is thereunto employ'd. 4 Oh Lord! my Guardian, be thou still; Fill thou, my Parents Roome. To do me good, and keep from ill; My Parent, now, become. And, when thy Children called are Their heritage, to take; Let me among them have a-share, For thy dear mercies sake. Hymn XVIII. For a Lover in generall. Most make a jest of that naturall affection which is termed Love; yet, in the well ordering of that Passion, depends the temporall happinesse, or unhappinesse of most men and women. This Hymn was therefore, composed to instruct and remember Lovers how to moderate that Affection, and to invoke divine assistance. Sing this as the 51. Psalme. [1] Take heed my heart, for in my brest; I, kindled feel a warm desire, Which if not ordred or supprest, May prove, at length, a banefull fire, Therewith to play, though few do fear, Yet, they who safely, scape the same, By pow'r-divine, preserved are; As were the Children, in the flame: 2 If (as men call it) Love it be; Love is, me thinks, too much my Foe, In taking, sleep and rest, from me. Who know no cause it should do so. In other thoughts, I spend the day Then, heretofore, I mus'd upon: Mine hours, I often sigh away; I, pleasure take to be alone. 3 And, though, some, this disease deride, Great flouds of teares the same hath cost. Some have been shamed; some, have dide; And, some, thereby their wits have lost. Therefore, that I may take no harm Whilst in my heart, such passions dwell, With faith in God, I sing this charm: And, he, I hope, will speed it well. 4 Lord! since in me, a youthfull heat, Those kindly motions, hath begun, Which nature doth in us beget; And, humane-Reason cannot shun: Grant me thy gracious ayd, I pray; And, for my safegaurd, so provide; That, what I cannot quite allay, I may (through thy assistance) guide. 5 To understand, instruct my wit, How far I may my fancie please: Or, how far forth I should admit, A future pain, for present ease. Let not my heart, be made a prize; To them, who true affections wrong; To wanton smiles, or lustfull eyes, Or, to a tempting Syrens tongue. 6 Let me be neither fool'd nor catch'd; By honour, wealth, or painted skin. Nor with unseemly yeers be match'd; Nor with an evill famed kin. But, chuse thou forth for me a mate, Which, truly, may my equall be In birth, in yeers, and in estate; Or, have what wants suppli'd by thee. 7 Yea, let me my Affections, place, Where, like Affection, may be found; Where, Vertue may be joyn'd with Grace; And, both with equall voice be crown'd, That, thou maist in our love, delight, And, that we may, by Love, ascend, In our Affections, to that height; And, to that Love, which hath an end. Hymn XIX. For Lovers being constrained to be absent from each other. Though this, and the like passions, are little heeded, and lesse pitied, by such as think themselves wise; yet, through want of counsell and means to direct or qualifie such affections, many inconveniences follow, which might be prevented, by this, or some such meditation, as are tendred in this Hymn. [1] Now, that thou and I must part, And, since parting is a pain, Which in ev'ry loving heart, Will, in Loves despight, remain: Charmes of grief, let us provide, Whilst together we abide. And, as gladly as we may, Strive, to sing our care away. 2 Dearest, weep not, sigh not so: For, it is nor Time nor place, That, can much divide us two, Though, it part us, for a space. Neither shall be left alone, When, asunder, we are gone: I, in thee, and thou in me, Shall, for ever, dwelling be. 3 In our flesh, indeed, we finde Sense of that, which we shall misse; But, it is within the minde, Where, the essence of it is. Mindes, may with each other stay, When their Bodies are away; And, since our the same can do, Whither from thee can I do? 4 If thou fear, lest death may bar, From that meeting we desire; Know, that, thou and I (my Dear) Shall, thereby, be brought the nigher: Since, in God, our hearts have met, Death, our meetings, cannot let. Nor can love, like our, begun; Be in life, or death, undone. 5 Therefore, now no more, lament; What avoyded cannot be: But, in him, remain content, Who endear'd me first to thee. To his Armes I thee bequeath, To be found in life, or death: Where, till I review thy face, Rest, my Dear, in his embrace. Hymn XX. For Lovers tempted by carnall desires. From those carnall suggestions, whereby wantons are incouraged to fulfill unchast longings; occasion is here taken, to cherish in true Lovers, rather such affections as beget and continue an everlasting-love. [1] Come, sweet-heart, come, let us prove, Whilst we may the joyes of Love. To each other, let us give All our longings, whilst we live: For, what most we fear to lose, Slowly comes, and swiftly goes; And, the pleasure we delay, May be lost, anon, for aye. 2 Those faire Lamps, which trim the skies, Daily set, and daily rise: But, when we have lost our Light, Everlasting, is our night. We, shall see nor Torch, nor Star, To informe us, where, we are. Therefore, come; come, let us prove, While we may, the Joyes of Love. 3 Thus, the carnall-dotard sings; Woing shades, as reall things: All his hopes, and all his Joyes, Sicknesse, Age, or death destroyes, Fancies-vain, and Foolish-fires, Are the Guides of his Desires: And, his blisse, and chiefest good, Builded is, on Flesh and Blood. 4 But, my Dear, and I, do clime; To Affections, more sublime. Neither wellfare, nor distresse, Makes our love the more, or lesse; Nor have outward things the pow'r, To mislead such love as our; And, it still abides the same, Whether praise it hath or blame. 5 When the Beauties, which adorn Flesh and Blood, away are worn; From those Ruins, which will raise Objects worth more love, and praise: Yea, when Sicknesse, Age or Death, Shall deprive of health and breath, Youthfull Strength, could never yet; Gain the blisse, we then shall get. 6 Therefore, Stars, and Moon, and Sun, Vnenvi'd, your Courses run. We, without distrust or feare, Keep our motions in our Sphere: For, we know, we shall arise, After death puts out our eyes; And, obtain a light Divine, Which will Moon and Sun out shine. Hymn XXI. For one contentedly married. The intent of this Ode is to shew that our naturall Affections are never fully satisfied in the choise of our helpers, untill God bring man and wife together by (as it were) making the one out of the other, through a frequent conversing together, and by observing and approving each others condition; which is never done till these passions are cast into a sleep, which make them dote on wealth, honour, beautie, and such unfit marriage-makers. Sing this as I loved thee once, &amp;c. [1] Since they in singing, take delight, Who, in their love, unhappy be; Why should not I ïn song delight, Who, from their sorrow, now, are free? That, such as can beleeve, may know, What comforts are on earth below. And, prove what blessings may be won, By loving, so, as I have done. 2 When first Affection warm'd my blood, Which was, ere Wit could ripened be; (And, ere I fully understood, What fire it was that warmed me) My youthfull heat, a Love begat; That Love did love, I know not what; But, this I know; I felt more pains, Then many a broken heart sustains. 3 When yeers, inform'd me how to see What had such wandring passions wrought; The more my knowledge grew to be, The greater torment, still, it brought. Then, sought I means to cure loves wound; The more I sought, lesse ease I found; And, milder pangs then I have had, Makes many Lovers, sick and mad. 4 I have a deep indented heart, Which, no content would let me finde, Vntill her proper Counterpart, Should thereunto, be firmly joyn'd. Er'e far I sought, or searched much, I many found, who seemed such: But, them, when I did neerly view, Not one, in heart, was fully true. 5 Alas! thought I; To what I seek Why should so many draw so neer, And, at the last, prove nothing like, To what, at first, they did appear? So much, why do so many please, Since, I was made for none of these? And, why in show, have I been one, Beloved much, yet lov'd of none? 6 Could wealth have bought my marra'ge-bed, Or honour brought me true delight; I could, these wayes, have better sped, Then many do beleeve I might. Nay, Beautie, though none loves it more; Nor proffred Loves, though I had store, Could make me think, now, found is she, That proves a Helper, fit for me. 7 Nor Ease, nor Pleasure could I finde, In Beautie, honour, love, or pelfe; Nor means, to gain a setled minde, Till I had found my second-self. Thus, till our Grandame Eve was made, No helper our first Parent had: Which proves a Wife, in value, more Then all the Creatures, made before. 8 Half tir'd, in seeking what I sought, I fell into a sleep at last: And, God, for me, my wishes wrought, When hope of them, were almost past. With Adam, I this favour had, That, out of Me, my Wife was made: And, when I waked, I espide; That, God for me had found a Bride. 9 How he this Riddle, brought to passe, This curious-world shall never heare. A secret Work, of his, it was, Not fit for ev'ry vulgar eare. Out of each-other, form'd were we; Within a third, our Beings be: And, our Well-being was begun, By being in our selves, undone. 10 I have the height of my desire; In secret, no dislike I finde. Love, warms me with a kindly fire; No Jealous pangs, torment my minde. I breath no sigh, I make no mone, As others do, and I have done; Nor do I mark, nor do I care, How faire, or lovely, others are. 11 My heart, at quiet, lets me lie, And moves no passions, in my brest: Nor tempting-tongue, nor speaking-eye, Nor smiling-lip, can break my rest. The Peer I sought, by me, is found: My earthly hopes, by thee are crown'd; And, I in one, all pleasures finde, That may be found, in women-kinde. 12 Each hath, of other like esteem; And, what that is, we need not tell: For, we are one, though two, we seem; And, in each others heart, we dwell. There, dwels he too embracing us, By whom, we were endeared, thus. He, makes us rich, though seeming poor; And, when we want, will give us more. 13 Lord, let our Love in thee begun, In thee, likewise, continuance have: And, if thy Will may so be done, Together, lodge us in one grave. Thence, on the Lambs great wedding-day, Raise us together, from the clay: And, where the Bridegroom doth remain, Let us both live, and love, again. Hymn XXII. For a Husband. The Knowledge, Conscience, Prudence, and Affection becoming a husband, is here partly expressed in hope, that by the perusall and use of this Hymn; some shall be the better continued in their conjugall amitie; and some become better husbands then they were. Sing this as the 1 Psalme. [1] Confession of the same I owe, And, thanks, oh Lord, to thee. That, thou art pleased to bestow A helper, fitting me. For, they that wed, and then repent, (Though others they condemn) Were cause of their own discontent, And, had what fitted them. 2 A wife sometime, is thought a curse, (And therefore disesteem'd) When, he that ownes her had been worse, If she had better seem'd. As, good examples breed, in some, More vertues, then they had; Some, likewise, better do become, By finding others bad. 3 Lord, let me alwaies mannage well The blessing, I have got; And, so with my companion dwell; That, her, I injure not. Preserve us, to each other kinde, With so much true respect, That, we may no occasions finde, Of doubtings, or neglect. 4 Let me not yeeld up my command, To her, that should obay; Nor, on my pow'r, more strictly stand, Then Love, with Reason may. But, let me still so act my part, And, be so well advis'd; That, I may neither grieve her heart, Nor make my self despis'd. 5 Though other Women may be thought, With more endowments blest, Let me beleeve, that mine hath brought, What shall befit me best. And, at her frailties, if I shall, In word, or thought, repine; Let me consider there withall; What she may think of mine. 6 When other women shall appear, More pleasurefull, to be, Make me suspect that Sathan there, Hath laid a baite for me: And, give me grace the same to shun, And, earnestly to pray, That, ere a folly may be done, Thy Love, prevent it may. 7 Our Saviour Christ, hath signifide, What love, a husband owes, By that, which on his holy-Bride, He graciously bestows. Therefore, so neer, as unto that, Imperfect Love may reach, Lord, give me grace to imitate What his examples teach. Hymn XXIII. For a Wife. Wives, are hereby taught, to seek in and from God, the perfection of their conjugall Amitie; this Hymn endeavours also, to insinuate the Affection and Obedience beseeming, pious and vertuous wives, by teaching their tongues to confesse, and expresse their duties. Sing this as the former. [1] Except, when kindest we appear, (And faithfullest are thought) Our Loves, in God, confirmed are, They quickly come to nought. For, our own Vertue, at the best, Is but a guilded-sin. And, when most friendship is profest, Much falshood, lurks therein. [2] No Joy, or grief, can in this life, More sweet, or bitter be; Then, when the Husband and the Wife, Shall well, or ill agree. Where they shall rightly simpathize, The dearest friendship growes: And, if betwixt them, strifes arise, They prove the greatest foes. 3 Lord, rectifie our hearts, therefore, And sanctifie them so, That, to each other more and more, Endeared we may grow; Vntill our fraile imperfect Love, By steps, up-raised be. From things below, to things above; And, perfected in thee. 4 Betwixt us let no Jarr's be found, Or breach of faith befear'd: Within our walks, let not the sound Of bitter words be heard: But, let the peacefull Turtle dove, In quiet, nestle there, Learn out the Songs of blamelesse-Love, And sing them all the year. 5 Preserve me from those peevish-tricks, Which merit scorn or hate; From all those humours of my sexe, Which wise mens love abate. From gaming-hands, from wandring-feet, From fond and vain attires; From eyes that rowle about the street, And, bring home loose desires. 6 Let this in mind be alwaies had (My husband to prefer) The Woman for the Man was made, And, not the Man, for her. Yea, since thy holy word hath said, The Wife should him obay, As Christ is of his Church obayd; Lord, grant that so I may. 7 And, that my heart may not despise His pleasure to fulfill; Let his commands be just and wise, Discreet, and loving still: For, when the Husband loves the Wife, As Christ example gives; Subjection, yeelds the sweetest life, That any creature lives. 8 It causeth him that is above, The kinder still to grow. It drawes him by the cords of love, To set himself below: And She that his Inferiour was, By Order, and Degree; Through Love, Humilitie, and Grace, His equall, stoops to be. Hymn XXIIII. For a Man in generall. Few men so consider the Priviledges of their Sexe as to be thankfull for the same, by which neglect they sometime abuse their Prerogatives. The amendment of which oversights was aymed at by offering this Hymn to be sometime used. [1] Great (oh Lord) thy favour was, That, a Being I have gain'd. Greater was in this thy Grace, That, therewith I life obtain'd. But, in that, the Soul I had Thou with Reason, hast endow'd; And, to Reason, Faith didst add, Greater Mercy hath bin show'd. 2 These large favours, I confesse; And, consider their esteem. Yet, I value nev'rtheles, Those that lower-prized seem. Therefore, Lord, (in what I can) Thanks I now to thee return, That, I was brought forth a Man, Rather, then a Woman born. 3 Not that I their Sexe despise; Or, too much exalt mine own: For, in these I were unwise; And, more Pride, then Thanks had shown. But (the Truth to thee I'le speak) Though men strongest counted are) I confesse myself too weak, Female Suff'rings well to bear. 4 For, when I observe the pains, Which, pursue a childing-wombe, And, the torments it sustains When the hour of Birth is come; When I heed the nightlie care, Which the nursing-mouths procure, Grievous things, methinks they are, Which a Woman doth endure. 5 To submit my knowing-Soul, (As they oft are fain to doe) To a churl, a fools controul, And perhaps dishonest too. There my Bodie to subject, Where I loath to draw my breath; And, by Nature disaffect, Would be worse to me then death. 6 I will thankfull therefore be, That, at better ease I seem; And, expresse my thanks to thee, In a due respect of them: For, as first a womans blame, Was occasion of our Fall: So; first, by a Woman came That, which makes amends for all. Hymn XXV. For a Woman in generall. Women are otherwhile uncivilly upbraided by imprudent men of the frailties of their Sexe. To comfort against such Reproaches, some things illustrating the worthinesse of their Sexe, are here expressed, and mixt with divine consolations. Sing this as the 1. Psalme. [1] My Grandame Eve, I curst not Lord, Nor vilifie her Name; Though, for her Sin upon record, Her Sons our Sexe defame: For, what without my fault was lost, I may again possesse Repurcha'st at anothers cost, Without my Righteousnes. 2 Our Sexe was first in that offence, For which Mankinde was shent; And, we have suff'red ever since, The greatest punishment. The vilest of our humane race, Vpbrayd us for that Sin, So aggravating our disgrace, As if they cleare had bin. 3 For, giving passage, to our Lust, Thy Curse abideth still. And our Desire, subject we must, Vnto anothers will. In sorrow, our conceptions are; And, oftentimes in vain. With sicknes were our children bore; And bring them forth with Pain. 4 Yet, LORD, we have a Joy in thee, Which none can take away. And Hopes, which cannot frustrate be, Till we our selves betray. The greater Crosses we sustain, (Whil'st in the Flesh we bide) The greater honour, we shall gain, When we are glorifide. 5 Thy meanest Hand-maid in distresse, If she in Faith complains; Shall in her sorrowes find redresse, And, ease for all her pains. Both Hannahs plaints, and Hagars cries, Thou graciously didst heed. And ev'ry Woman, who relies On thee in time of need. 6 Though foolish men our Sexe despise, And hold us in contempt; From thy most holy Mysteries We never were exempt. By some of us, thy Messages, Have to thy Church bin sent; And, men have born with good successe, A Womans government. 7 Yea, by the Womanside he came, Whose grace hath means procur'd To free us from the death and shame, Which all had else endur'd. What e're, to others we may seem, With Him, nor Bond, nor Free, Nor Male, nor Female want esteem, If they shall faithfull be. Hymn XXVI. For Virgins. This Hymn teacheth Virgins to behave themselves with discreet and chaste moderation, according to the gift they have received; neither striving for the Garland of perpetuall Virginity, beyond their power, nor shunning it, being made capable thereof; but, rather submitting both mind and bodie, to what God calls them unto. [1] Zeal to God-Almighties praise, And, his worship to attend, Hallow'd some in former daies, To be Virgins to their end: Virgins, firme in Age and Youth, To the love of spotlesse-Truth: Nor defil'd, nor drawn aside By the baits of Lust, or Pride. 2 These, are they whom Grace ordaines To be present day and night, Where the blessed Lambe remains; And, to wear long Robes of white. Robes, more white then mountain snow; Or, the Lillies, where they grow: Robes more glorious, then those are, Which Earth's greatest Princes wear. 3 LORD, my Bodie yet is free, From a wanton fleshlie touch; Happie will my portion be, If I still may say as much. For, when toyous we begin, Lust will quickly enter in: And though first, the breach be small, That, at last, will ruine all. 4 If a Virgin to remain, For thy service, may be best; Make me able to contain; That no Longings me molest. Let our Pride, nor causlesse Fears, Dread of Want, or outward Cares, To that life, a motive be; But meer Love of serving thee. 5 Though, some skoffingly, upbrayd Those that aged Virgins are; Let not that which fools have said, From a praisefull course deter. Neither let a Virgins name, Make me dote upon the same, Till those raging fires begin, Which provoke to deadly-Sin. 6 To keep chast the marriage-bed, Is a virtue more of worth, Then to keep a maiden-head; Though, some set it fairer forth. ANGELS, Virgins are, they say, So, are Flowers, as well as they; And, as much (for ought I know) Merit praise for being so. 7 If a Helper, help me may, Better to perform thy Will; Such a one, for me purvay, And, be then our Helper still. I desire not to obtain, What meer Fancie seeks to gain; But, in that would spend my daies, Which may most advance thy praise. 8 Some, unfit for Wedlock seem, Others, Virgins cannot live: Ev'ry gift should have esteem, Which it pleases thee to give. Whatsoe're, therefore, it be Which thy Love confers on me, Make me, so my gift to prize, That, no other, I despise. 9 To what state so e're thou hast Me, for time to come, design'd; Keep thy servant ever chast, Both in Body, and in Mind. For, if Chastitie be there, Both estates made equall are: And, ev'n that, which best is thought, Wanting this, proves worse then naught. Hymn XXVII. For a Widower, or a Widow deprived of a loving Yoke-fellow. That such as be deprived of their most deare companions, may not be swallowed up in excessive griefe, and so forget their Christian hopes and duties, this Hymn teacheth a moderate expressing of their naturall Passions; and remembers them of things not to be forgotten in their sorrow. Sing this, as I loved thee once. [1] How neer me, came the hand of Death, When at my side, he struck my Dear! And took away the precious breath, Which quick'ned my beloved Peer? How helplesse, am I thereby made! By day, how griev'd! by night, how sad! And, now my lifes delight is gone, Alas! how am I left alone! 2 The Voice, which I did more esteem, Then musick in her sweetest key; Those eies which unto me did seem, More comfortable then the day: Those, now by me (as they have been) Shall never more be heard or seen; But, what I once enjoy'd in them, Shall seem hereafter as a dream. 3 All earthlie comforts vanish thus: So little hold of them have we, That, we from them, or they from us, May in a moment ravish'd be. Yet, we are neither just nor wise, If present mercies we despise; Or mind not, how there may be made A thankfull use of what we had. 4 I therefore, do not so bemoan (Though these beseeming tears I drop) The losse of my beloved-One, As they that are depriv'd of hope; But, in expressing of my grief, My heart receiveth some relief; And, joyeth in the good I had, Although my sweets, are bitter made. 5 LORD, keep me faithfull to the trust, Which my dear Spouse repos'd in me. To him now dead, preserve me just; In all, that should performed be: For, though our being Man and Wife, Extendeth only to this life; Yet, neither Life nor Death, should end The being of a faithfull-Friend. 6 Those helps which I through him enjoy'd, Let thine continuall ayd supplie; That, though some hopes in him are voyd, I, alwaies may on thee relie. And, whether I shall wed again, Or, in a single-state remain, Vnto thine honour, let it be; And, for a blessing unto me. Hymn XXVIII. For a Widower, or a Widow delivered from a troublesome Yoke-fellow. Because deliverance from a troublesome Yoke-fellow, is a benefit neither to be despised nor undiscreetly rejoyced in; this Hymn teacheth with what moderation, with what tendernesse of heart, and with what desire we should be affected in such cases. Sing this as the Lamentation. [1] Rejoice not without fear, my heart, That, thou by death's impartiall stroke, Discharged from thy Partner art, And, freed from an unequall Yoke. Yea, though by means of this divorce, Thou may'st escape much discontent; Yet, both with pittie and remorse, Consider well, of this event. 2 For, as when first the Jewish-Lawes, Divorcements, tolerable made The hardnes of their heart was cause, That such a Course permission had. So, an obduratenes of thine, Some cause might peradventure, be That God, (who sees when men repine) Hath from thy Mate, released thee. 3 Triumph not, therefore, in thy lot, As if thy merits were the more; But, use the freedome thou hast got, With meeknes; and thy Sins deplore. For, if Gods eye had bin severe In marking how I gave offence, He had prolong'd my torment here; Or else, in wrath remov'd me hence. 4 When Man and Wife shall disagree, Though one of them lesse guiltie prove, Yet, neither of them, quite are free From breaking of the Law of Love. And, to be blamelesse, doth sometimes Those proud, or foolish thoughts infuse, Which make more guiltie, then the crimes, For which we others do accuse. 5 Vnto the Soul-departed, Lord, (Although it often hath transgrest) I hope, thy mercy doth afford, Well-being, in a place of rest. And, for each wrong sustain'd by me, Whil'st in the Flesh it did remain, (As also for my wrongs to thee) I beg thy pardon to obtain. 6 And, that I may conclude my race With lesse offence, and more content; Vouchsafe me thy assisting-grace, Ensuing errors to prevent, And, if thy providence allowes Another helper unto me; LORD, keep us faithfull in our vowes, Both to each other, and to thee. Hymn XXIX. For a Cleargie-man. Though most Cleargie-men know well enough what meditations are pertinent to their Callings; yet, some of them being otherwhile forgetfull of what they know, we have inserted this Hymn to remember them, who shall not despise to be remembred thereby. [1] Whatsoe're my motives were, When this Calling I assum'd, Many times, I greatly fear, Lest I overmuch presum'd: For, whose ablenes of wit, Oh most glorious King of Kings! Or, whose holines, is fit To dispence thy sacred things; 2 When those honours I perceive, Whereto some of us ascend; And, what portions thou do'st give On thine Altar to attend. When I mind my private charge, And, what Audit I must yeeld. For my Calling, LORD, at large, With sad thoughts, my heart is fill'd! 3 Dreadfull is that servants doom, And, accursed is his case, Whom his LORD, when he shall come, Finds unfaithfull in his place. For, at ev'ry Shepherds hand, Who neglects his Flock to keep; Thou wilt strict accounts demand, For the blood, of ev'ry Sheep. 4 Therefore, LORD, for thine own sake, In thy feare, preserve me so, That, I still may conscience make, Of the work thou call'st me to. Yea, preserve me from their sin, Who by fleecing of thy flock, Have both cloth'd and fatted bin, And, thy threat'ned Judgements mock. 5 Let the Doctrines which I preach, Be from errors alwaies free: Let the Truth which I shall teach, By good-life confirmed be. Let me evermore have care, True Devotion, true increase; And of those nice things beware, Which may break the band of Peace. 6 Pardon all which merits blame, In my entrance to this Place; My great failings in the same, Lord, forgive me of thy grace: And, that none of these be lost Which to me committed were, Let his ayd, whose life they cost, Help me, where my failings are. Hymn XXX. For a Laie-man. God usually blesseth a pious and obedient Laitie, with discreet and godly Pastors, and froward Sheep are justly committed to negligent Shepherds. The Laitie, therefore, are by this Hymn instructed to praise God for their faithfull Pastors, to pray for them; and to yeeld them all due honour, obedience and necessary supplies. Sing this as the 25. Psalme. [1] Not in a mean degree, Am I obliged, LORD, For thy enlight'ning grace to me, Vouchsafed by thy Word: Nor lesse oblig'd am I, To sing thy daily praise, That, I have guids to rectifie My knowledge, and my waies. 2 For, through each Age, oh God, Thy Priests thou hast ordain'd, To spread that saving-Truth abrode, Whereby our blisse is gain'd. Yea, they thy Shepherds be, Thy Flocks to feed and keep; And, home to bring, again to thee, Thy weak, and wandring Sheep. 3 LORD, fit them for that place, Which they are call'd unto, By giving them both gifts and grace, Their duties well to do. And, forme in us, we pray, Such fruits of true belief, That, their Accounts they render may, With Joy, and not with Grief. 4 As Messengers from thee, Let me their errants hear, And of their place respective be, Though mean their persons are. And, let me not refuse, Or murmur, to bestow Those honours, or those other dues Which I to them shall owe. 5 Lest Vzzah-like I fare, Let me no medler be, In things that consecrated are; But, as beseemeth thee. (And when thy Word I read (That I may shun offence) Thy grace vouchsafe me to take heed Of Errors private sense. 6 That, I may likewise, heed Truths Path, let me have care, To find their Tents, who feed thy Sheep; And, to continue there. Yea, that to them and thee, The Way be not mistook; Let me still walk, where I may see The Footsteps of thy Flock. Hymn XXXI. For a Lawyer. A Lawyer conscionably affected is a publike blessing, that therefore the use or perusall of this Hymn, may help remember that which most of them very know, we have added this Meditation. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] Keep me throughout my life, oh Lord; In such a Son-like dread of thee, That to the Cannon of thy Word, My practise alwaies may agree. And, since the studie of the Lawes, For my profession was design'd; To patronize the righteous cause, Preserve in me a willing mind. 2 Let nor the gaining of a Fee, Nor Foes despight, nor Friends desart, Nor fear, nor want, enveagle me From faithfull Counsell to depart. Nor let my Practise be like theirs, Who turn the means of righting wrong, Into vexations gins, and snares, Contentious pleadings to prolong. 3 From their base mind preserve me clear, To whom Iudiciall-Courts do seem, As if they only raised were, To help enrich and honour them. And, from their Guilt, preserve me too, Who, their preferments to increase, Forbear not publike wrongs to do, Nor, to infringe the common-peace. 4 Yea, teach me so to know, and minde, How much displeased, Lord! thou art, With him that's wilfully inclinde The Course of Iustice to pervert; That I may never do or say That, which averse to Truth may be; Or, set my Clyent in a way, Which may not well approved be. Hymn XXXII. For a Clyent. Clyents are oft times through wilfulnesse, or indiscretion, needlesse occasions of their owne and other mens molestations. Here therefore, they are put in minde with what sinceritie, warinesse, and prudence they should wage Law, and of whom this temper is to be sought. Sing this as the 23. Psalme. [1] So oft as neighbours disagree, At least, one partie still, Blame worthie shall be found to be, In Judgement, or in Will. Nay, many times, on either side, Law-suits are so begun; That, neither can be justifide In that, which they have done. 2 Self-Love, and Self-conceit, pervert The most approved Lawes; They make, sometimes, an honest heart, Befriend an evill-Cause. And, few men so inclined are Their errors to behold, As when in others names they hear Their own offences told. 3 Therefore, since now engag'd I am, A Clyent to become; And must abide with gain or blame, The Lawes impartiall doom. LORD, grant me grace, to be content The Truth should alway thrive; And, to accept of that event, Which thou art pleas'd to give. 4 Let neither peevishnes, nor hate, Nor pride, my Will deprave: Nor, thirsting to enlarge my state, Endanger what I have. But, grant me wisdome to foresee, (Before I be undone) How mischievous a Suit may be, Which rashly is begun. 5 Preserve me from the mind of those, Who seek by fraud or force, The Acts of Justice to expose; Or interrupt her course. And, lest this mind may me undoe, Assisted let me be, With Lawyers, and with Judges too, From Bribes, and Falshood free. Hymn XXXIII. For a Physitian. It may be some Physitians will not despise to preserve in themselves a Remembrance of their duties, by such a means as this Hymn: howsoever, it is here inserted, that it may purposely or accidentally performe that office. [1] Oh my God! what helpeth lesse To preserve us from the Grave, Then that Art which I professe, If it please not thee to save? And, when sicknes I oppose, By what cunning, could I see In what secret path it goes; If I had not light from thee? 2 By thine ayd I must discern Where my Patients grief doth lie; I, from thee must also learn, What, thereto I should apply: And, when such weak things as these, Leaves, and Roots, of Plants, and Weeds, Shall remove a strong disease, From thy Virtue, it proceeds. 3 Therefore, let thy blessing still, With my Practise, go along; And, so guide, so blesse my skill, That no Patient may have wrong. And, their boldnes let me shun, Who, when Art is at a pawse; Desp'rate Courses dare to run, For their profit, or applause. [4] Let the grievance of the Poore, Be, for Charitie, of me As much tendred, evermore, As the Rich-man's for a Fee. And in me, their mind prevent, Who prolong an easie Cure: And, their profits to augment, Make men griev'd, more grief endure. 5 But, such Conscience let me make (In the Calling I professe) What I give, and what I take, That my Practise thou may'st blesse. And, that when I sick shall be, I no cause may have, to fear That, Revenge will ceaze on me, For neglect of love, or care. Hymn XXXIIII. For a Patient. One cause that sick persons have so little benefit by the Physitians ayd, is their neglect of their own duties to God, and themselves; and for prevention of these negligences, this Hymn was composed. Sing this as, VVe praise thee God. [1] Lord, from the noisome sink of sin, Which through our nature goes, All Suff'rings do at first begin; Thence all our sicknes flowes. And, till the streams of Grace thou daign, To wash that filth away, We labour for that Health in vain, Which else obtain we may. 2 Most wise Physician of my Soul! To purge now, therefore, please That vicious Fount, of humors-foul, Which breedeth my disease. And, when remov'd those Causes be, Which my distempers bring, Cure also those effects in me, Whence my disease doth spring. 3 Thy blessing on that means bestow, Which, now I do intend; And, let my heart in all I doe, On thee, alone depend. Yea, that the means which I receive, May bring my hopes to passe; Give me the due preparative Of penitentiall-grace. 4 For, he that on his Leaches Art, Doth over-much relie: Or, with an unrepentant heart, The means of health, doth trie; Shall either misse the wished ease, Which to obtain, he thought, Or, gain by health, a worse disease, Then that, whose cure, he sought. Hymn XXXV. For a Merchant, or Chapman. By the use of this Hymn, Merchants may be kept heedfull of the snares and temptations which they become lyable unto by their negotiations; and, what peace, and profit, will ensue if they be just and mercifull in their Dealings. Sing this as the 4, 5, or 6. Psalmes. [1] Vnlesse, oh Lord, thy grace thou lend, To be mine hourely guide, In ev'ry Word I do offend; In ev'ry step, I slide. For, earth, us lawfull Course affords, That makes men more to blame, (In fraudfull deeds, and guilefull words) Then that, whereof I am. 2 When strong desires of being rich, With means thereto, are joyn'd; Good-conscience is endanger'd much, And, often, cast behind. Yea, to great wealth men seldom rise Through what, they sell and buy, Except, to vent their merchandize, They, sometime, cheat and lie. 3 The sins, oh Lord, forgive thou me, Which to my trading cleave. Vpright, let all my dealings be; That, I may none deceive. All my Affaires, instruct me so (By prudence) to contrive; That others may, by what I do, See, honest waies, to thrive. 4 Permit, not, Greedinesse of gain, My Conscience to ensnare, Or, lode me, with employments vain, Or, fill my heart with care. Nor make my Goods, a prey to those Who, by dishonest waies, (Or, by pretending all to lose) Themselves, to riches raise. 5 To those, who poor are that way made, Which they could not prevent, Let me no cruell burthens add, In craving what I lent: But, let me do for men distrest, (As my estate may bear) What, at their hands, I might request, If in their plight I were. 6 So, though to povertie I fall, And, needy seem to be; A quiet minde, possesse I shall, With full content, in thee. And, if great wealth, I, do acquire, It will not wast away, Like brushie Fewell in the fire, But, with mine Off-spring, stay. Hymn XXXVI. For a Souldier. The Souldier being taught by this Hymn, to nourish in his heart, the contempt of Bodily perils is withall instructed, or put in minde to be carefull to avoyd the sins usually defiling that profession; to consider the duties of his Calling, and take God for his Leader and Defence. [1] Now, in my self, I notice take, What life we Souldiers lead, My haire stands up, my heart doth ake, My Soul is full of Dread; And, to declare This horrid fear, Throughout my bones, I feel A shiv'ring cold, On me lay hold, And, run from head, to heel. 2 It is not losse of limbes or breath, Which hath me so dismay'd. Nor mortall wounds, nor grones of Death, Have made me thus afray'd. When Cannons rore, I start no more, Then mountains, from their place, Nor feel I fears, Though swords and spears, Are darted at my face. 3 A Souldier it would ill become, Such common things to feare: The shouts of war, the thundring drum, His Courage up doth cheere. Though dust and smoke, His passage choke, He boldly marcheth on, And thinketh scorn, His back to turn, Till all be lost or won. 4 The flashing Fires, the whizzing shot, Distemper not his wits: The barbed Steed, he dreadeth not, Nor him, who thereon sits. But, through the field, With sword and shield, He cutteth forth his way, And, through a flood, Of reaking blood, Wades on, without dismay. 5 That, whereupon, the dread begins, Which, thus appaleth me, Is that huge troop of crying-sins, Which rife in Souldiers be. The wicked minde, Wherewith I finde, Into the field they go; More terror hath, Then all the wrath, And Engines of the Foe. 6 The Rapes, the Spoiles, and Acts unjust, Which are in Souldiers rife, Their damned Oathes, their brutish lust, Their cursed course of life, More dreadfull are, When death draws neer, Then Death it self can be; And, he that knows The fear of those, The mouth of Hell, doth see. 7 Defend me Lord, from those misdeeds, Which my profession shame; And, from the veng'ance that succeeeds, When we are so to blame. Preserve me far, From Acts of War; Where, thou dost peace command; And, in my brest, Let mercy rest, Though Justice use my hand. 8 Those, let me willingly obay, Who my commanders be. Both with my Place, and with my pay, Contented make thou me: And, when I go, To meet my Foe, Let no beloved Sin, In me be found, To make a wound, Without me, or within. 9 Let me no help to those afford, That have a wicked cause; Nor take up Armes, but, where her sword Impartiall Justice draws. Yet, as a blot, Impute thou not, The wast of humane blood; Shed by my hands, At their commands, Who must not be withstood. 10 Be thou my Leader to the Field; My head, in battell arme. Be thou a brestplate, and a shield, To keep my Soul from harme: For, live or dye, I will relye On thee, oh Lord, alone. And in this trust, (Though fall I must) I, cannot be undone. Hymn XXXVII. For a Seaman. The Seaman is here personated instructing himself, by expressing the pleasures; profits, and perils of his calling; and petitioning God to keep him thankfull for his deliverances, and mindfull to performe the vows, he made in times of extream danger. Sing this as the former. [1] We, whom affaires employed keep, Where mightie-waters be, There view the terrors of the Deep; Great wonders, there, we see. And, in that place, Gods helping grace, We tast, so many waies, That none are bound More oft, to sound Their dear Protectors praise. 2 The barren Flood, which Landmen dread, To us, doth pleasures yield; And, we thereby, are cloth'd and fed, As from a fruitfull field. That, we, likewise, Might rightly prize, The blessings we receive; We, ev'ry day, To watch and pray, Some, just occasions have. 3 To cheer us in our painfull trade, The Sea, sometime, doth smile: Strange prospects, there, a means are made, Long journyes, to beguile. A loftie Course, As on a Horse, Vpon the waves we ride; And, then the wind, Attends behind, Or, lackies, by our side. 4 Sometime, again, that, heed we may Gods mercies, and our sin; Black stormes, the skies do overlay; The Seas, to swell begin. The Billows roare, And, on the shoare, They Spit their Snowie-fome, And, perils great, The passage get, Betwixt us, and our home. 5 The raging Winds our tacklings breaks And rends both shrouds and sailes, Our bruized vessell, sprinketh Leaks, And, then, our courage failes. One while, we plow The Sands below; Anon, aloft we rise, As if we went, With an intent, To saile above the skies. 6 Opprest with dangers and with fear, Then, loud we call on God: Who doth vouchsafe our cries to hear, And, calmes the raging Flood. From death and wrack, He plucks us back, By his Almightie hand; And (having lost Our hope, almost) VVe, safe are brought to land. 7 For thy protections Lord, therefore, Still thankfull keep thou me; As well, when I am safe on shore, As where great perils be. Let me not breake, The vows I make, VVhile times of danger last; And, new begin My Course of Sin, Assoone as fears are past. 8 For, he who taketh no regard, What, in distresse he vow'd; Shall cry at length, and not be heard, Nor finde compassion show'd. When, wave nor storme, Can us reform; Nor Mercy, daily shown; Gods wrath, prepares. Far greater fears, To bring presumption, down. Hymn XXXVIII. For a Musician. Many Musicians are more out of order then their Instruments: such as are so, may by singing this Ode, become reprovers of their own untuneable affections. They who are better tempered, are hereby remembred what Musick is most acceptable to God, and most profitable to themselves. [1] What helps it those, Who, skill in Song have found; Well, to compose (Of disagreeing notes) By artfull choice A sweetly pleasing sound; To fit their Voice, And their melodious throats? What, helps it them, That they this cunning know; If most condemn The way, in which, they go? 2 What will he gain By touching well his Lute, Who shall disdain A grave advise to hear? What from the sounds, Of Organ, Fife, or Lute, To him redounds, Who doth no sin forbear? A mean respect, By tuning strings, he hath, Who doth neglect, A rectified-path. 3 Therefore, oh Lord, So tuned, let me be Vnto thy word, And, thy ten-stringed-law, That in each part, I may thereto agree; And, feel my heart Inspir'd, with loving awe: He sings and plaies, The Songs which best thou lovest, Who does and sayes, The things which thou approvest. 4 Teach me the skill, Of him, whose Harp asswag'd Those passions ill, Which oft afflicted Saul. Teach me the strain Which calmeth mindes enrag'd; And, which from vain Affections, doth recall. So, to the Quire, Where Angels musicke make, I, may aspire, When I this life forsake. Hymn XXXIX. For a Husbandman. Vpon the Husbandmans labour the temporall wellfare of all common-weales depends: this Hymn, therefore, teacheth him to sanctifie his endeavours by prayer, and thanksgiving: To seek his profit by Gods, blessing, and so to care for the Body, that the Soul be not neglected. Sing this as the 25. Psalme. [1] Prevent, Lord, by thy grace, The curse that entred in, And on the earth, continued was, For Adams wilfull sin. Let not thy Love permit My cost, my time, or pain, In digging, and in dressing it, To be employ'd in vain. 2 Though thornes and bryers, be The natives of our fields; Yet, when the earth is blest by thee, A pleasant crop it yields. The hils rich pasture, bear; Deep grasse, the meads adorn; The trees with fruits arayed are; The dales are full of corn. 3 Lord, that it may be so, My honest labours blesse; And, grant that what I set and sow, May yeeld a due increase: From Vermine, Fouls, and Weeds; From those who spoil or steal, Both Plants and Fruits, and Crops, and Seeds, Preserve thou for my Weal. 4 From blasting-Ayres defend From Colds, Heats, Droughts, and Rains, Which may deprive me of the end, And, comfort of my pains. And, let in season still, Thy dewes, and fruitfull drops, Vpon the thirstie clods distill, Which else will fail my hopes. 5 What ever thou shalt give, My labours to requite; That, let me thankfully receive, And, in thy love delight. Not seeking (for my gain) A Famine to augment; By needlesse hording up of gain, When hungrie times are sent. 6 And though the Plough and Spade, Dung-Dust, and Miery-clay Are Instruments, and Objects made, My Body to imploy. Yet, suffer not my Soul Affection to bestow, On things that are so mean, and foul, In fading, and so low. 7 But, while my hands do move, In works that earthlie be; Advance my heart, to things above; And, fixe my love on thee: That, when my Flesh, must lie In Earth, from whence it came; My Soul, may to those mansions fly, VVhere, Spirits praise thy name. Hymn XL. For a Labourer. Labouring-men have many discouragements; and if they faint under their burthens, other will feele the weight of it. This Hymn therefore cheares them up in their painfull Calling; and stirs them up also to seek Gods blessing upon their labours. [1] You that enjoy both goods and lands, And, are not forc'd by sweat, And, by the labour of your hands, To earn the Food you eat; Give thanks for this your easie lot And, do not us disdain; VVhose Bread, and Raiment must be got By taking daily pains. 2 For, though our portions mean appear, Contentments, they procure; Whereby, we still, enabled are Our labours to endure. And no man, ever those yet knew, In aged yeers forsook; Who were in youth, to labour true, And honest Courses took. 3 When sicknesse or those wants do come, Wherein we comfort need; God, alwaies moves the hearts of some, Our secret wants to heed. And, without shame, we then receive What charitie bestows: Because, what, at such times men give; The common Treasure, owes. 4 They, who delight from doore to doore, Of hunger to complain; Meere want of honestie, made poore; Or, want of taking pain. They, therefore, lack what needfull is, Their flesh to cloth, and feed: Whereas, we nothing greatly misse; But, what we do not need. 5 Rich men, in this, we do surpasse; To us, our labours are A portion, which in ev'ry place, Things needfull may prepare. Yea, were we rob'd of all today, Or, chas'd from where we dwell; If we can bear our Limbs away, They will maintain us well. 6 Make me without repining, Lord! My lot, to under-go, Till thou shalt larger means afford; And, easie dayes bestow. In health, and strength, preserve thou me, My lively-hood to get; And, when I sick or old shall be, Provide me, cloth and meat. 7 Keep me, (although thou keep me poor) In word, and action, true: And, give me grace, if I have more, That, sloth I may eschew. So, whether povertie or pain, Or wealth, or ease, thou send; Through thee, a passage, I shall gain To blessings, without end. Hymn XLI. For a Shepherd. That Shepherds, might not muse altogether on Drudgerie or impertinent vanities, while they are, all alone, attending their Flocks, we have prepared, for them, a Pastorall-Song, to acquaint and exercise them, with nobler Meditations. Sing this as the Lamentation. [1] Renowned men their Herds to keep, Delighted much in elder dayes: And to attend their Flocks of sheep, Great Princes thought is no dispraise. And, while they so employed were, Sometime, oh God! it pleased thee In wondrous manner, to appear, And, gracious unto them to be. 2 The Joyfullest-news, that ere was told, Was unto Shepherds, first declar'd, And, they did also, first behold The blessing, whereof they, first, heard. Lord! I am thine, as much as they, (Although unworthy such respect) Oh, let thy mercies, glorious Ray, Vpon my low-estate, reflect. 3 Whilst all alone, I here attend This harmlesse Flock; let, into me Thy holy-Ghost, oh Christ! descend; That, I may therewith filled be. And, though my heart a Stall hath bin, Where, Vice at Rack and manger, lay; Vouchsafe thou, to be born, therein: That, better guests possesse it may. 4 Lest Idle-musings, Thoughts beget, That, stir up longings, which are ill; And, make me my endeavour set, Forbidden Actions, to fulfill. Vpon thy Love, and on thy Law, Let me, my lovely houres, employ. That, I may serve with Joy-full-awe; And, love thee, with an awfull-Joy. 5 When I my stragling-sheep behold, Let me conceive, what I had bin; Hadst thou not brought me to thy Fold, And, fed and succour'd me, therein. And, when I well consider those, Who Spoilers, of those creatures be; Me, let it mindfull make, what Foes Do seek, to make a spoile of me. 6 When, likewise, I behold them shorn, And, meekly yeelding up their fleece; Or, when to slaughter they are born, How patiently, their lives they leese: That holy-Lambe, let me, I pray, Thereby, in thankfull minding have, Who, dumbe-before the Shearer lay; And, slaughtred was my life to save. 7 Yea, whilst I watch and guide my sheep; Be thou my Shepherd, and my Guide, Both me, and them, from harm to keep; And, all things needfull, to provide. That, when both Goats, and Sheep, shall stand Before thy face, their doomes to bear; I, may be plac'd at thy Right-hand, And, Joy when I my Sentence hear. Hymn XLII. For a Handicrafts man. All handicrafts being gifts of the holy Ghost, it were fit men did better know it, and more often praise him for it. To that end, this Hymn was devised; and, perhaps, if it were devoutly, and frequently used, Crafts-men, would be more thriftie, and lesse deceitfull, in manufactures then they now are. [1] Thy Gifts most, holy-Spirit, be So great, so manifold, That, what we have receiv'd from thee, No language, can unfold. The meanest Sciences in use, As well as famous Arts, Thy Prudence, did, at first produce; And, still, to men imparts. 2 Embrodry thy Invention was, (Though many think it vain) The skill to Grave in steel, and brasse, We did from thee, obtain. For not Bezalaels hands, alone, Didst thou with cunning fill; But, yet, instructest ev'ry one, That is endow'd with skill. 3 That little which my hand can do, Was learned first, from thee: Thou, first enabled me thereto; And, alwaies work'st with me. My knowledge, more and more encrease, Till perfect it appear: And, let the Science I professe, My needfull Charges bear. 4 Preserve in me, an honest minde, That, well my work be wrought. For, them, whose wares false made, we finde, An evill spirit taught. It may a while encrease their store, But, mischiefs it will breed; And, leave men both defam'd, and poore, In times of greatest need. 5 For all thy Gifts I give thee praise, And, I acknowledge will, That, thou dost ayd me many waies, In my Mechanick skill; Yet, since those Arts vouchsafed be Alike, to Good and Bad; Of thy more speciall-Grace, let me Partaker, Lord! be made. 6 Oh blessed-Spirit, alwaies, daign, That, through thine ayd, I may The sanctifying gifts obtain, Which thine Elect enjoy. Yea, though my Works be not so pure, Thy Censures to abide, Yet let my Faith, so firm endure, That, Grace, be not denide. Hymn XLIII. For a School-master or Tutor. School-masters and Tutors, being sometime more arrogant then learned; and more covetous then industrious; many are much hindred thereby. By this Hymn therefore, they may be remembred to judge themselves, and to seek of God a due qualification, by prayer. [1] Beware my heart, Lest thou too highly deem, Of that small art, Which may appear in me; And, proud become, As Pedants use to be, Because, to some A knowing-man I seem: For, though good-lessons I have taught, Yet, in my self, if I be naught; And, marre Doctrines, by my Waies, Reproofs I merit, more then Praise. 2 If I presume To know, beyond my reach; Or shall assume Large pay, for slender pain: If I neglect Whom I am bound to teach, Or, lesse affect My Dutie, then my gain; I for those wrongs can make small mends, Because, whoever thus offends, Injurious is to Age, and Youth, And guiltie of the worst untruth. 3 My God, therefore, A conscience let me make; To boast no more Then well perform, I may. But, so well heed For what, reward I take; That, I in Deed, May practise what I say. And, lest my labours fruit may want; So water thou, what I shall plant; That, from the pains which I bestow, Both comfort, and increase, may grow. Hymn XLIIII. For Schollers and Pupils. Schollers, and Pupils, are here personated illustrating the Priviledges of learning, and the basenesse of ignorance, praising God for the means of encreasing their knowledge; and praying him, to season and endow them with profitable Sciences. Sing this as the 10. Commandements. [1] Though knowledge must be got with pain, And, seemeth bitter in the Root; It brings, at last, a matchlesse gain; And yeeldeth forth most pleasant fruit. It is the richest kinde of trim, That noble persons can put on; It Reason keeps, from growing dim; It sets a lustre, thereupon. And, raiseth Princes, now and then, Out of the lowest Rancks of men. 2 But, such as do this Jem neglect, Or, seek it not whilst they are young; Grow old in yeers, without respect, And, perish in the vulgar throng. Like brutish beasts, they little know, Save how their bellies they may fill. When others rise they sit below, They see no choice twixt good and ill. And, that which best commends their state, Is, they repent when 'tis too late. 3 I therefore now, do sing thy praise, And give thee thanks, thrice blessed-Lord, That thou in these my youthfull dayes, The means of knowledge, dost afford. Compelled many others are (That knowing men they might become) To pay great sums, and travel far, For that which I may gain at home; Or where, supplyed all things are, As well, as if at home, I were. 4 Vouchsafe me, therefore so much grace, As to endeavour what I may; Whilst I have leisure, means, and space, And wits, to bear this prize away. Be pleas'd, likewise, to season so The knowledge, which I shall attain; That, puffed up I may not grow, Nor fooled be, with Science vain. But let my chief endeavours be, To know my Self, thy will, and thee. Hymn XLV. For young Persons. By using this Hymn, young-persons are made reprovers of their own follies; and taught to affect, and pray for such things as are laudable, profitable, holy, and to the glory of God, &amp;c. [1] Youth is a wild, a wanton thing, Which few can govern well; For when our Blood is in the Spring Our wits are in the shell. We up and ride, Er'e we can guide The Charret of our Will; And, thereupon We hurry on, Ev'n down Perditions hill. 2 When we our Friends lamenting here, The giddy Course we take, We think, that, through a needlesse-care, A causlesse-coyle they make. But, when we view That we pursue What, shame or losse hath brought; We sneaking go, As fools will doe; And say, We had not thought. 3 In virtuous Actions, we are weak; In Vices we are strong: We soon are tir'd, if wisedome speak; And, think vain-tales not long. Lest Tutors may, Our Wills gainsay, Tis now our greatest Fear: And, to provide For Lust and Pride, Is most of all our care. 4 LORD, teach me, therefore, to beleeve What wisedome doth foretell. E're I do smart, or make them grieve, Who truly wish me well. Since, ev'rie day, Behold I may, How evill Courses thrive; Let me forbear, To fleight, or Jeer, Those, who good-counsell give. 5 Vouchsafe me grace and strength to rein My wild and head-strong Will; And all those longings to restrain, Which tempt us unto ill. The Flowrie prime, Of youthfull time, Let me not vainly spend In follow'ng Sin, Which bringeth in Perdition without end. 6 But sanctifie unto thy praise, My Soul and Bodie, Lord: And purifie my youthfull waies, Through thy all-cleansing word. That young and old, When they behold, Thy work of grace in me; May glorifie Thy Majestie, From whom, all blessings be. Hymn XLVI. For old Persons. It is a curse to have youthfull Affections in an aged Body; and a great blessing it is to be wained from the world, as Youth decayes. This Hymn, therefore personates an aged Person rejoycing in the nearnesse of his dissolution, despising the pleasures of Youth; and desiring to be invested with immortalitie. Sing this, as I loved thee once. [1] Now, glad and happie may I be, And carroll forth a Song of praise: For that, so neer at hand I see, The wished harvest of my daies, Mine aged-years to me do shew, What I in Youth could never view. And fading-Sense instructs me more Then perfect-Senses heretofore. 2 Right blest am I, that I have past, The perils of those youthfull times, Which we in fruitles Follies wast, Or (which is worse) in hainous crimes. From Jealous Loves, from Lustfull Foes, From raging fits, from loose desires, Which heretofore tormented me, I now am hopefull to be free. 3 Oh Lord! vouchsafe it may be so: In me let youthfull Follie cease. As I in years more aged grow, Let Virtue more and more increase. Let all my Passions me become, And their base fondnes keep me from, Who youthfull pleasures dote upon, When pleasing Youth, and strength is gon. 4 These Jollie times, which most men praise, (And sorrow when they passe away) Increas'd my torments many waies; And perils in my path did lay. Yea, but for thy assisting-grace, I had bin ruin'd in that race: And therefore, now I praise thy Name, That I have overliv'd the same. 5 As did Lots wife, let not my heart Vnto that Sodome of mine age. Look back, as loth it should depart, Nor thereunto my Soul engage. But make these times as loth'd of me, As aged years of Wantons be. That grace in me, may ev'rie day, Increase as Flesh and Blood decay. 6 Forbid thou then, that (when I have spent My Lust and Love to youthfull Sin) I should make semblance to repent; And, other Follies then begin. At youths escapes let me not rail, Because, that way my strength doth fail; Yet, practise whil'st I them gainsay, Worse evils in a graver-way. 7 Let me not change my vain Excesse, Into an over-sparing-mind, Nor in Old-age grow mercilesse, Because, my Youth was ever kind. Nor let me love, as many do, To make vain brags (with lying too) Of youthfull tricks now I am old, Which are not seemlie to be told. 8 But, such let my endeavours be, As may my place and years beseem; That Youth may good example see; And Age continue my esteem; For, when a comely part we play, It keeps in Age, contempt away. And (though but weak, our Bodies are) Our Looks will keep strong men in fear. 9 As this my carnall-Robe growes old, (Soil'd, rent, and worn, by length of years) Let me, on that, by Faith, lay hold, Which man in life immortall wears. So sanctifie my daies behind; So let my manners be refinde; That when my Soul and Flesh must part, There lurk no terrors in my heart. 10 So shall my Rest be safe and sweet, When I am lodged in my grave; And, when my Soul and Bodie meet, A joifull meeting they shall have. Their Essence, then, shall be divine; This muddie Flesh will star-like shine: And, God, shall that fresh-Youth restore, Which will abide for evermore. Hymn XLVII. For a blind Person. To mitigate their discomforts who are deprived of Bodilie-Sight, this Hymn intimates the furtherance which that defect may be to their everlasting Felicitie; and a spirituall Illumination is implored to supply that corporall defect. Sing this as the Lamentation. [1] Fain would I view that pleasing sight, And lovelie splendor of the Skies, Which chears the day, adornes the night, And gladdeth all Beholders eies; But, since God pleased is, to hide That spark of Common-grace from me; Content I am to be denide The Gift, which may not granted be. 2 For it proceeds not still from wrath, When God of those things doth deprive, Which he on most conferred hath; And without which, diseas'd men live. Sometime our Good; sometime his Praise; And many times, ev'n both of these, Are Cause, that he upon us layes Discomfort, Blemish, or Disease. 3 Perhaps, if I the Light had seen, The way to ruine I had gone; Or, guiltie of offence had been, Which me for ever had undone. Perhaps in darknes here I bide, Because if I had light enjoy'd, Mine Eye had left mine Heart aside, And made my best endeavours void. 4 What e're the cause thereof hath been, Thou LORD, art pleas'd it should be so; And with thy Justice, I have seen Thy Mercy, hand in hand, to goe. In thy good pleasure, I therefore, With our repining am content; And, will be thankfull evermore, For whatsoever thou hast lent. 5 My want of an externall-sight, With inward-light, supplie thou so, That I may walk that path aright, In which thy Children ought to go. Yea, be my Watchman, and my Guide, My Mind and Body to direct; That nothing lead my heart aside; Or injure me through this defect. Hymn XLVIII. For a Criple. The Criple is here taught to comfort himselfe in his infirmities, by taking notice that Bodily Crosses may may be furtherances to our spirituall performances; and pledges of Gods favour, &amp;c. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. [1] Though in my limbs I cripl'd am, (Which for some works disableth me) My Tongue as yet, is not so lame, But that my Voice may tuned be. In Song I may Gods love advance; Though him I praise not in the dance. 2 And cause I have, to sing his praise, Who humbled me by this defect: For where he loves, the Rod he laies, And all his children doth correct. Those, therefore, whom he chast'neth not, No Children are by him begot. 3 Some Crosse, all humane Flesh must bear The Spur, or Clog, we all do need: For slow, or else too rash we are; And, of our duties take no heed. Yea, sweetest blessings we contemn, Till some affliction sharpens them. 4 (God shrunk a sinew in his thigh, And sent him halting to his grave) Whose prai'r he did not then denie, But, therewithall a blessing gave. Oh! if such Faith were found in me, My Lamenesse might a Blessing be. 5 Therefore, oh Lord, increase thou so The little Faith which I retain; That, more believing I may grow, That in thy grace, I may remain; And, that my Frailtie keep me may From erring far out of thy way. 6 Be thou my Staffe; be thou my Prop; (As from the cradle thou hast bin) And still maintain in me, the hope Which I, till now have lived in. So shall I misse my Limbs the lesse, And thy free-mercy still confesse. Hymn XLIX. For a Nurse. Nurses by ill diet, distempered affections, or want of heedfulnesse, may be hurtfull to their Nurse-Children. Therefore, when they sing to quiet their Nurslings, the repetition of this Song may perhaps remember them how to order themselves, and what care to take of their charge. [1] When Sampsons Mother was foretold, What Son she in her w?b should bear; A Dyet, she was taught to hold, And warn'd whereof she would beware: Whereby, their foll'wing good effects, To him, who did from her proceed: Discretion from the same collects, That Nurses warilie should feed. 2 For though it is thy blessing, LORD! Which gives the temper we desire; Thou, thereunto do'st means afford; And, heedfulnes in us require. That knowledge, therefore, grant thou me, That love, that conscience, and that care, VVhich in those Women ought to be, VVho chose for Foster-Mothers are. 3 Crown thou my Pains with good successe, That comfort therein may be found. My Babe from fire, from water blesse, Preserve him quiet, safe and sound. Let not my Milke, thereto convay Those humors, which may either bend The mind unto a vitious way; Or else, the Bodies health offend. 4 But let my Body and my mind, Be tempred still, and ord'red so; That helps thereby this Childe may find, In virtue, and in strength to grow. And lest, when I my best have done, From me more Ill then Good, he drawes; Vouchsafe Him grace my sins to shun, And to be govern'd by thy Lawes. Hymn L. For a Almesman or Woman. Almes-men for whom Charitie hath provided, have leasure, and speciall cause to praise God for his loving providence: And this Hymn is prepared to remember them, with what thankfulnesse they should be alwaies affected. Sing this as the 25. Psalme. [1] It is Lord, of thy grace, That when we needie were, Food, Rayment, and a Dwelling place, Thou didst for us prepare. For when we were afraid, Through want, opprest to be; We had relief, and timelie-aid, To us vouchsafed by thee: 2 When means nor pow'r we had, Things needfull to provide; Then Strangers were our helpers made, And have our want supplide. Yea, some that heretofore, Did earn their bread with sweat; Now labour lesse, and yet have more, Then they were wont to eat. 3 Warm-clothed ev'rie day, Well-hous'd we likewise be; For which we nothing are to pay, But hearty-thanks to thee. Lord, thankfulnes is all Which thou of us do'st crave: And that Rent-service is but small, In liew of what we have. 4 Much better men, are fain (And some lesse able too) For coursest bread, to take more pain, And oft without it go. Sometime, when far from home They seek their dailie hire, Wet, cold, and hungrie, back they come; And find nor bread, nor fire. 5 Mean while at ease we bide, In lodgings warme and dry: And, others do those things provide, VVhich may our want supplie. So that, if heed we give, To what we do enjoy, The quiet'st kind of life we live, And freest from anoy. 6 VVe praise thee, LORD, therefore, And thee most humblie pray, To keep us thankfull evermore, And faithfull in thy way. That in this leasure, now, For Heav'n we may prepare, And not in Soul, more wretched grow, Then we in Body were. 7 Them, LORD, vouchsafe to blesse, By whom, those helps we have; And let them still in thee possesse, The fruit of what they gave; And since they did befriend The poore in time of need; Let still thy Mercy down descend, On them, and on their seed. Hymn LI. For a Rich-man. This Hymn was composed, that it might occasion Rich men to be more often mindfull what hinderance their wealth maybe to their best happines, the same being immoderately affected, ill gotten, or misimployed, &amp;c. [1] Said (not causlesse) it hath bin, That a man of large estate, Doth an entrance hardlie win, Through the blest cœlestiall gate. For as Riches do increase, Wants abound, Contents are lesse; Great Affaires augmenting care, For the Soul no leasure spare. 2 Leasurelesse if he did seem, Who had taken but one Farme; If the purchase of one Teem May occasion so much harm, As to keep away a guest, From that great Almighties Feast; When at leasure will he be, That hath twentie Farmes to see? 3 Rich I am suppos'd, oh LORD! By that wealth which I possesse; And for what thou do'st afford, Thy free Bountie I confesse. Yet such wants I find therein, That I get not all I win: And what once our Saviour said, Makes my heart sometime afraid. 4 For when wealth exceeds the bound, Which doth answer our degree, Snares, and baits, therein are found, Whereby choaked we may be. Yea, I find it ev'rie day, Wooing so my heart away, That unlesse thou keep me true, I may bid thy love adue. 5 Therefore, LORD, thy grace augment, As my Riches are increast; Those insertions to prevent, Wherewithall they may infest. Let them nor possesse my heart, Nor afflict it when we part. Nor be purcha'st at their cost, Who themselves for wealth have lost. 6 Though a Rich man hardlie may Find an entrance into blisse; Yet through thee, oh LORD, the way, And the passage easie is. If we can but willing be, To forsake our wealth for thee, Or bestow it on the poore; 'Twill inlarge heav'ns narrow Doore. 7 Let, oh! let me still have care, So to husband what I have; That I lose not what I spare, Nor grow poore by what I save; Only what I need is mine; All the rest, oh LORD! is thine; Which if I misuse or wast, Must be answer'd for at last. 8 To that Audit, e're I come, Let me reckon by my self, How I gain'd, or parted from, Ev'rie parcell of my pelfe. Goods-misgot let me restore; Wealth-mispent let me deplore; And before I Judgement have, Judge my Self; and pardon crave. Hymn LII. For a Poore man. Povertie needeth Counsell and Consolation, therefore that (when it is wanting from others) Poore men may administer comfort to themselves, and be assisted by expressing their wants to the supplier of all necessities; this Hymn is offered unto them to be sung to that purpose. Sing this as the 15. Psalme. [1] Some think there is no earthlie state, To be abhorred more; Or more deserving feare or hate, Then to be mean and poore. Yet such a Portion I have got, That I am needy made: Yea, this is fallen to my Lot; And yet I am not sad. 2 For Earth, and all that therein is, The LORDS possessions be: Both he is mine, and I am his, Who hath enough for me. The Rich their own Providers are; Yet sometimes they have need. But God hath of the poore a care, And them doth alwaies feed. 3 Though Povertie seem grievous may, (And much afflicteth some) It is the best and safest way, Vnto the World to come. For, Poverty in her extream, Nor tempts, nor so perverts, As great Abundance tempteth them, Who thereon set their hearts. 4 Therefore, that ev'rie man might grow With his estate content; Thy Son, oh God! this way did go, When through this world he went. He wealth and honour prized not. (Though we now prize it high) And Satan, therefore, nothing got By tempting him thereby. 5 LORD, though I do sometime complain, That outward means are scant, And would assume that luggage fain, Which I but think I want; Yet when I mind how poore a life, My Saviour liv'd on earth; Wealth I condemne, and all my grief, Is changed into mirth. 6 Let still my heart be pleased so, What e're betide me shall: Yea, make me (though I poorer grow) Contented therewithall. And, let me not be one of them, Who (in profession poore) Seem Wealth and Pleasure to contemn, That they may cheat the more. 7 The works my Calling doth propose, Let me not idlie shun; For, he whom Idlenesse undoes, Is more then twice undone. If my estate enlarge I may; Enlarge my love to thee. And, though I more and more decay; Yet, let me thankfull be. 8 For, be we poore, or be we rich, If well imploi'd we are, It neither helps, nor hinders much, Things needfull to prepare. Since God disposeth Riches now, As Manna heretofore, The feeblest gath'rer got enow, The strongest got no more. 9 Nor Poverty nor Wealth, is that Whereby we may acquire That blessed and most happie state, Whereto we should aspire. But if thy Spirit make me wise, And strive to do my best; There may be in the worst of these, A means of being blest. 10 The Rich in Love obtain from thee, Thy speciall gifts of grace; The poore in Spirit, those men be Who shall behold thy face. Lord, grant I may be one of these, Thus poore, or else thus rich; Ev'n whether of the two, thou please, I care not greatly which. Hymn LIII. For an Inne-keeper or Taverne. By the hearing, singing, or perusall of this Hymn, it is hoped that discreet Inne-keepers will be encouraged to continue Civilitie and good order in their Innes; and that some who have heretofore neglected the same shall be hereby provoked to be more orderly hereafter. Sing this as the former. [1] Most men repute a Common Inn, For ev'rie person free To set up there a Stage; where Sin May boldly acted be. And when prophane and rude excesse, Their prizes there may play, The Civill Guest is welcomlesse; And wished then away. 2 Inns were to better ends ordain'd; And better were imploy'd: For Virtue there was entertain'd; And needfull Rest enjoy'd. Yea, though our Calling many scorn, And brand it with disgrace, Our Saviour in an Hostry born, Hath sanctifide the place. 3 His Grandame Rahab kept an Inn; And blessed Paul thought fit, His Hoast should have remembred him, Ev'n in the sacred-writ. There Sanctitie her lodging had, With Piety-divine; Their Inns were holy-Chappels made, And so I wish may mine. 4 A drunken and a prating Hoast, To Fools yeelds much delight; And by his wiles, their needlesse Cost, Is doubled ev'rie night. But, him, that is discreet and grave, A better Lot attends. He, Credit, health, and wealth shall have; Good Guests, and heartie friends. 5 For, when a Sober-Guest shall come Abode with such, to make; He knows he may, as if at home, His ease, in safetie take. But, on the former, if he light, (Mistrusting dangers, there) He hides his purse, and all the night, Doth wake, or sleep, in feare. 6 Discretion, Lord! vouchsafe thou me, My Calling, so to use, That, I, by none may injur'd be; Nor, any, me abuse. Yea, let mine Inne a Schoole be made, To teach (without offence) Those Guests, that evill manners had; To go more civill, thence. 7 And, though I cannot all prevent, Which Guests may there misdo; Yet, neither let me shew consent, Nor liking, thereunto. Let me, for no advantage, make A brothell, of mine Inne: Nor, by connivancie, partake In any wilfull Sin. 8 So, at mine Inne thy blessed Son His Lodging Lord, shall take; And, there, (much more then I have done) Him, welcome I will make. For, not a Stable, but my breast, Shall be his lodging Roome. And, mine own heart, to give him rest, A pallet, shall become. Hymn LIIII. For, Taylors, Millers, and Weavers. Most men of these Trades, are either greatly slandered, or very guiltie of deceit and falshood: Therefore, that such as be faultie may reprove themselves; and, that such are innocent may be cherished in their honesty; this Hymn was composed. Sing this as the former. [1] It is too much, that, in my heart, Corruptions I retain, Which make me from those waies depart, Wherein, I should remain. Yet, in my Calling; Stumblings are By other men espide, Whereof, unlesse I can beware, I, soon may swarve aside. 2 Occasions of a shamefull sin, Are offred, ev'ry day. And, few of us have backward bin, To put the same away. Long custome, doth in most beget Opinion and belief. That 'tis no fault, or else not great, To be a daily-Thief. 3 The Devill finds excuses out, Which being used long, Perswade us to become in doubt, If thieving be a wrong. And at the length, so impudent, It causeth us to grow; That we do fearleslie assent To act what ill we know. 4 From this degree of guiltinesse, Preserved let me be; From Sins by custome seeming lesse, Oh Lord deliver me. If I be good, no trade so bad, But yeelds an honest gain: And him that's naught, no course or trade, Will honestlie maintain. 5 If love to Goodnes, move me not Vprightly still to deal; Make me observe their Lowsie-lot, Who use to filch and steal: For they are beggers in the end; Or if they wealth obtain, On lust and pride, their children spend, What they by thieving gain: 6 For love of Righteousnes therefore, Let me be still upright. And though I still continue poore, In Truth let me delight. So shall to me my Trade, become A Calling without blame: And though it be abus'd by some, Shall never bring me shame. Hymn LV. For Shrieves, Baylies, Sergeants, &amp;c. Some of these Officers may perhaps become better in their condition, and prevent some scandals (which they are lyable unto) if they otherwhile remember themselves of their duties by the repetition of this, or the like Meditation. Sing this as the former. [1] What ever Equitie commands, To punish things misdone, Hath execution by our hands; By whomsoe're begun. We are that Arme, whereby the Law Doth hold on sinners lay: And few thereof would stand in awe; If we were took away. 2 To Death, to torments, or to thrall, We do Offenders bear: And why such things on them befall, We oft confessed here. Yet otherwhile, our conscience may (While we perform our part) To us in secret truly say, Their doom is our desart. 3 If we therefore, who often view What Sin on Sinners drawes; And are the men who do pursue, The sentence of the Lawes; If we our dangers will not see, By what on others lights; The greater will Gods vengeance be, When he in anger smites. 4 LORD, so inspire my heart with grace, Reform, renew me so; That with good conscience in my place, My duties I may do. From being partiallie inclinde, For gain, for love, or fear; From harshnes where I may be kind, Preserve me ever clear. 5 So when to call me to my doom, Thy Sergeant thou shalt send; I need not be afraid to come, But gladlie thither wend. For though no Righteousnes of mine, Thy Censure may abide: It being vailed ore, by thine I safelie may be tride. Hymn LVI. For a Jayler. Jaylors have at one Time or other, men of all estates and conditions in their custody, as well good as bad; Therefore, it is not impertinent to encrease the means whereby they may be made or preserved honest and mercifull men; which may be somewhat furthered, by this Meditation. Sing this as the X. Commandements. [1] Though, we have got an evill-name, And, cruell-men reputed are; We may not be so much to blame, As, to the vulgar, we appear. With such as have not well been taught, We chiefly deal; and, such as they On us, an Ill-report, have brought; Which, will not soon be blown away. 2 If we be kinde, to such as these; They, for our kindnesse, us undo: If then, we give them little-ease, They, raile at us, for doing so. And, most, who their just suffring see, (Misjudging that, which they perceive) Suppose us mercilesse to be; When, better things, they should beleeve. 3 The Common-wealth doth alwaies need That service, which it calls us to, And, many mischieves would succeed, Should all men, unrestrained go. Good-men, have this way, been employ'd: And, by the tender hearts, of such, Good-men, have, likewise, ease enjoy'd; And, comforts, which they needed much. 4 Yea, though fooles count it, no disgrace Offenders, thus, to keep in hold; An Office, of that Trust, it was, And honourable, thought of old. And, if we be not men of trust, To whom, such places, now, belong: They, who conferd them, are unjust; And, much, the Common-wealth, may wrong. 5 When Joseph was in prison bound, (Though great he were, who laid him there) He, kindnesse in the Jayler, found; Because, he guiltlesse did appear. Yea, many blessed Saints of God, When they by Tyrants, were opprest; (And no compassion found abroad) Found mercy, in a Jaylers breast. 6 Oh Lord! let mercy never faile Within my heart, a place to finde. Though I be Keeper of a Jayle, Yet, let me keep, an honest-minde. Discretion give me, to perceive What men, I strictly should restrain: And, when I libertie may give, Yet, in my place, upright remain. 7 Keep me, for evermore, a friend To those, that are sincerely thine; And, thy compassion, Lord! extend In life, and death; to me, and mine. And, let my Servants, all, I pray Be faithfull-Servants unto thee: That, at the great Assizes-day; I, and my houshold, sav'd may be. Hymn LVII. For a Prisoner. Men in Affliction are somewhat cased when they can finde words whereby to expresse their sufferings; To help them who want expression of their endurance, in imprisonment; and, to remember prisoners, of such Meditations as are pertinent to their condition, is the intent of this Hymn. [1] I, whom of late No thraldome did molest; Of that estate, am, wholly, dispossest. My feet, once free, Are, strictly now confin'd; Which, breeds in me, A discontented mind. 2 Those prospects faire, Which I was wont to have; That wholsome aire, Which fields and medows, gave; Are changed, now, For close unpleasant cells: Where secret woe, And, open-sorrow, dwels. 3 Insteed of Strains, Delightfull to mine eare, Gives, bolts and Chains Are all my musick, here: And, er'e I get Those things, for which I pay, I must entreat, With patience, in delay. 4 To feed, or sleep, To work, or take mine ease; I, now, must keep Such houres, as others please. To make me sad, Complaints are likewise heard; And, often made, Of wrongs, without regard. 5 Lord! as I ought, My freedome had I us'd; Of this, (no doubt) I might have been excus'd. But, I confesse, The merit of my sin, Deserves no lesse, Then hath inflicted bin. 6 Let not, oh God! My sin, thine anger move: But, let this Rod, Correct my faults in love. With patient minde, Let me thy stripes endure; And, freedome finde, When they have wrought their cure. 7 Whilst, here, I bide (Though I unworthy be) Do thou provide All needfull things, for me. And, though friends grow Vnkinde, in my distresse; Yet, leave not thou Thy servant, comfortlesse. 8 So, though in thrall My body must remain; In minde, I shall Some freedome, still, retain? And, wiser made By this restraint, shall be, Then, if I had Vntill my death, been free. Hymn LVIII. For a Prisoner condemned. I have often observed that prisoners condemned, for want of good counsell, have Ill spent the short time assigned them to live: otherwhile in a desperate Jollitie; and otherwhile in excessive discomfort; therefore, this Hymn is offered as a help to settle, and prepare their mindes for death. Sing this as, VVe praise thee God. [1] Now, I perceive a God there is That searcheth out my wayes; And that when ere I do amisse, His eye the same survayes. Yea, now, I know, he knows that thing Which I thought known of none: And, can to light those actions bring, Which are in darknesse done. 2 As thou, oh Lord! hast found me out, So, let me finde out thee: That, of thy grace, I may not doubt, Though gracelesse yet I be. And, to the Crosse, though I was brought, Ere I my guilt could rue; Since, now, thy mercy, is besought, To me, thy Mercy shew: [3] Touch thou my heart with true remorse, For what, I have misdone: That, it may truly hate the Course, Which I till now have run. And, let, oh Lord! some recompence From thy free hand, be daign'd; To all, who have, by my offence, Wrong, losse, or grief, sustain'd. 4 Let not the horror of my fact, My guiltie Soul oppresse; Nor fear, nor hope, my minde distract; Nor sorrow, me oppresse. But, let me with, true penitence, Before thy throne repaire; Emploring grace, for my offence, With fasting, and with pray'r. 5 And, though the Sinners way, I trod, Whilst I had freedome here; Let, unto me, in death, oh God! The Gate of Life, appear; That, when the Law shall stop my breath, As Justice doth decree, I, through the dreadfull shades of Death, May finde, a path to thee. Hymn LIX. For a Prisoner at the place of Execution. It is usuall for Prisoners brought to suffer for death, to Sing at the place of their execution, that they may testifie their hope of a joyfull Resurrection; and of mercy in the world to come; in the expression of which hope, this Hymn assisteth, and intimateth with what Meditations, they should be exercised at their suffering. Sing this as the former. [1] VVhen Achan for his lawlesse-prize, A censure should receive, His pious Judge, did him advize, To God, the praise to give. For, when our sins we do confesse, We make his Justice known; And, praise the wayes of Righteousnesse, By blaming of our own. 2 Lord! I have well deserv'd the doome, By which condemn'd I am: And, to this place, I now am come, To suffer for the same: In hope, through my firme faith in thee, And for thy mercies cause; That, this, shall my last-suffring, be For breaking of thy laws. 3 Behold not Lord! behold, thou not With Countenance austeer, The Crimes, which do my Soul bespot, And fill my heart with fear: But, since I have repented them; Since, I, in thee beleeve; And do likewise my self condemn, Do thou oh Lord! forgive. 4 Though with disgrace, cast forth I am, And, thrust from living-men; Lord! Let me not appear with shame, When I appear, agen. Yea, though this way, to thee I come, And, have my Lot mispent, Thy wastfull-Childe, receive thou home; Since, he doth now repent. 5 Them comfort who are fild with grief, This end of mine to see. Let my sad fall, and my lewd life, To others, warnings be. Oh! let all those, who see me clime This mountain of disgrace, Amend their lives whilst they have time, And, Vertues path embrace. 6 Once more, I, for my self, oh Lord! Of thee do humbly crave, That, thou the mercy wouldst afford, Which, now, I seek to have. But, longer why do I delay This bitter Cup to drink? Thou knowest Lord! what I would say; Thou knowst what I can think. 7 My heart speaks more then words expresse, And, thoughts, the language be, By which the sinner, in distresse, Speaks loudest unto thee. The world, therefore, thus, turning from; Of her, I take my leave: And, Lord! to thee; to thee I come; My Spirit, now, receive. Hymn LX. For a Poet. Poets are prophets; not only in the vulgar acception, among humane Authors, but so called also by Saint Paul, Tit. 1. 12. By this Hymn therefore, such Poets as are not past grace, may be remembred to exercise their facultie to that end, for which it was given unto them, by God. [1] By Art, a Poet is not made. For (though by Art, some better'd be) Immediatlie his gift he had From thee, oh God! from none but thee. And fitted in the wombe he was, To be (by what thou didst inspire) In extraordinarie place, A Chaplain of this Lower-Quire. Most Poets future things declare; And Prophets (true or false) they are. 2 They who with meeknes, entertain And, with an humble Soul, admit Those Raptures, which thy grace doth daign, Become, for thy true service fit. And, though the scapes which we condemn, In these may otherwhile be found; Thy Secrets thou revealest by them, And mak'st their tongues thy praise to sound. Such Moses was; such David prov'd; Men famous, holy, and belov'd. 3 And, such (though lower in degree) Are some, who live among us yet; And, they with truth inspired be, By musing on thy holy-Writ. In Ordinarie, some of those, Vpon thy service do attend; Divulging forth in holy-Prose, The Messages which thou do'st send: And some of these, thy Truths display; Not in an ordinarie way. 4 But where this Gift puffs up with pride, The Devill enters in thereby; And through the same, doth means provide, To raise his own Inventions high. Blasphemous-Fancies are infus'd; All holy new-things are expel'd. He that hath most prophanelie muz'd, Is fam'd, as having most excel'd; And those are Priests and Prophets made To him, from whom their Strains they had. 5 Such were those Poets, who of old, To heathen Gods, their Hymns did frame; Or have blasphemous-Fables told, To Truths abuse, and Virtues blame. Such are these Poets, in these daies, Who vent the fumes of Lust and Wine: Then, crown each others heads, with Bayes; As if their Poems, were divine. And, such, (though they some Truths foresee) False-hearted, and false prophets be. 6 Therefore, since I reputed am Among these few, on whom the times, Imposed have, a Poets name; Lord! give me grace to shun their crimes: My precious gift, let me employ Not (as imprudent Poets use) That Grace, and Vertue, to destroy, Which I should strengthen, by my Muse: But help to free them of the wrongs, Sustain'd by Drunkards Rymes, and Songs. 7 Yea, whilst thou shalt prolong my dayes, Lord, all the musings of my heart, To be advancements of thy praise, And, to the publique-weal, convert: That, when to dust I must return, It may not justly be my thought, That, to a blessing, I was born, Which by abuse, a Curse hath brought. But, let my, conscience, truly say, My Soul in peace departs away. Hymn LXI. For them who intend to settle in Virginia, New-England, or the like places. Many depart every yeare from this Ile, to settle in Virginia, New-England, and other parts of America, whose happinesse I heartily desire; and whose contented well-being in those places, might perhaps be somewhat furthered by such Meditations as these: And therefore, to those who please to accept thereof, I have recommended my love in this Hymn. Sing this as, We praise thee God. [1] Lord, many times thou pleased art, Thy servants to command From their owne Countries do depart, Into another Land; That thou maist there, a dwelling place Vpon their seed bestow; Or else to bring thy saving-Grace, To those to whom they go. 2 To whatsoever end it were, That hither I am sent; To do thy Will, and serve thee here, It is my true intent. And humbly I of thee require, That as thy Will to do, Thou hast inclined my Desire; Then grant performance too. 3 From old acquaintance, from my kin, And from my native home, My life anew, here to begin, I by thy leave am come: And now, the place of my abode, Appeareth unto me Another World; yet here oh God! My God thou still shalt be. 4 This Land is thine, aswell as that, From which I lately came: Thy holy Word this Light begat; The Heav'ns are here the same. Sun, Moon, and Stars, as well as there, The Seasons do renew: The Vapors drop their fatnes here; And thy refreshing dew. 5 Oh! let the Sun of Righteousnes, Thy Truth, and Grace divine, Within ths uncouth Wildernes With brightnes also shine. That we and they whom here we find, May live together so, That one in Faith, and one in mind, We by thy Grace may grow. 6 Since to that place, we seem as dead, From whence we be remov'd; The Follies which with us were bred, The Sins which there we lov'd; Here, let us bury on the shore; That they may not be seen, And learn'd by those, that heretofore, So wicked have not been. 7 But innocent, oh Lord, and wise, Let our Demeanors be; That they, whose rudenesse we despise, No ill example see. But, taught aswell by Deed, as Word, So let their Good be sought, That they may Room to us afford, As due for what we brought. 8 And let the Place, from whence we came, To us be still so dear; That we nor injure, nor defame Church, Prince, or People there. But let us passe our Censures now, Vpon our selves alone; And, by our Conversation, show What best is to be done. 9 Make us contented with that Lot, To which we now are brought. Let that which may not here be got, A needles thing be thought. For this he may suppose with ease, Who by the Natives heeds, With how few things their minds they please, How little Nature needs. 10 Let all our Labours be for Life; Our Life unto thy Praise; Not needlesly augmenting Grief, Or Paine, by vain Assaies. That though our Trash, be not so much, As other Countries have, We may in Graces, be as rich, And inwardly, as brave. 11 So when the course of Time is run, And, God shall gather all That liv'd betwixt the rising-Sun, And Places of his fall; Our friends that farthest from us are, Shall meet with Joy again; And they and we, who now are here, Together still remain. Hymn LXII. The Authors Hymn for himselfe. He praiseth God for converting his many troubles and afflictions to his advantage; desiring those Meditations may not be prophaned by his failings; but that he may live so in this life, that he may be admitted to the Quire of Angels in the life to come. [1] Great Almighty King of Heav'n! And One-God, in Persons-three; Honour, Praise, and Thanks be giv'n, Now, and evermore to thee. Who hast more for thine prepar'd, Then by words can be declar'd. 2 By thy Mercies I was taken From the pits of mirie clay; Wherein, wretched and forsaken, Helples, hopeles, too I lay. And, those comforts thou didst give me, Whereof no man can deprive me. 3 By thy grace, the Passions, troubles. And what most my heart opprest, Have appear'd as aierie bubles, Dreams or suff'rings but in jest: And with profit that hath ended, Which my Foes for harm intended. 4 Those afflictions, and those terrors, Which did Plagues at first appear; Did but shew me what mine errors, And mine imperfections were. But they wretched could not make me; Nor from thy Affection shake me. 5 Therefore, as thy blessed Psalmist, When his warfares had an end, (And his dayes were at the calmest) Psalms, and Hymns of Praises pend; So my rest, by thee enjoy'd, To thy Praise I have imploy'd. 6 Lord, accept my poore endeavour; And assist thy Servant so, In well-doing to persever, That more perfect I may grow; Ev'ry day more prudent, meeker, And of thee a Faithfull-seeker. Let no passed sin or folly, Nor future fault in me Make unfruitfull or unholy, What I offer now to thee: But with favour and compassion, Cure and cover each transgression. 8 And with Isr'ls Royall Singer, Teach me so Faith's Hymns to sing; So thy ten string'd Law, to finger; And such musick thence to bring, That by Grace I may aspire, To thy blessed Angell-Quire. [Although my Muse flies yet far short of those] Although my Muse flies yet far short of those, Who perfect Hallelviahs can compose: Here to affirme, I am not now afraid, What once (in part) a Heathen Prophet said, With sleighter warrant (when to end was brought What he for meaner purposes had wrought.) The work is finish'd, which nor humane pow'r, Nor Flames, nor Time, nor Envy shall devour. But with Devotion, to GODS praise be sung, As long as Britan speaks her English-tongue, Or, shall that Christian-Saving-Faith professe, Which will preserve these Iles in happines. And (if Conjectures faile not) some that speak In other Languages, shall notice take Of what my humble Musings have compos'd; And by these Helps, more often be dispos'd To celebrate his Praises in their Songs; To whom all Honour, and all Praise belongs.
