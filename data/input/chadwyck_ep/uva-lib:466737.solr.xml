      <field name="fulltext">Acque stagnanti, mobili cristalli, Fior varj e varie piante, erbe diverse, Apriche collinette, ombrose valli, Selve e spelonche in una vista offerse: E quel che il bello, e il caro accresce all'opre, L'arte che tutto fa, nulla si scopre. TASSO. Gerusalemme Liberata. Canto decimosesto.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO B. B. WIFFEN, IN RECREATION AND IN STUDY, IN GLADNESS AND IN TRIAL, The Companion, the Brother, and the Friend, THIS POEM IS AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aspley Wood. CANTO I. “Solo, chi segue ciò che piace, è saggio, E in sua stagion degli anni il frutto coglie; Questo grida natura.” ? TASSO. I THE breath of Spring is on thee, Aspley Wood! Each shoot of thine is vigorous, from the green, Low-drooping larch, and full unfolded bud Of sycamore, and beech, majestic queen! With her tiara on, which crowns the scene With beauty,—to the stern oak, on whose rind The warmest suns and sweetest showers have been, And soft voice of the fond Favonian wind;— His thousand lingering leaves reluctantly unbind. II But of all other trees, a clustering crowd Bow their young tops rejoicingly, to meet The breeze, which yet not murmurs overloud, But wastes on Nature's cheek its kisses sweet, To woo her from dark winter;—the wild bleat Of innocent lambs is on the passing gale, Blending with pastoral bells, and at my feet, From yon warm wood the stockdove's plaintive wail Wins to the curious ear o'er the subjected vale. III O Nature! woods, winds, music, vallies, hills, And gushing brooks,—in you there is a voice Of potency, an utterance which instils Light, life, and freshness, bidding Man rejoice As with a spirit's transport: from the noise, The hum of busy towns, to you I fly; Ye were my earliest nurses, my first choice, Let me not idly hope nor vainly sigh; Whisper once more of peace—joys—years long vanished by! IV To you I fled in childhood, and arrayed Your beauty in a robe of magic power; Ye made me what I am and shall be, made My being stretch beyond the shadowy hour Of narrow life,—ye granted me a dower Of thoughts and living pictures, such as stir In the eye's apple; to the breathing bower, Here, where bright chesnut weds the towering fir, Recal fair Wisdom back that I may dwell with her. V Visions on visions! how the moving throng, These bright remembrances on fancy press Buried enjoyments as I pass! the song Sung in the hushed vale's verdant loneliness,— The storm—the sun—the rainbow—the vain guess Of notes heard in the distance,—the advance Of bells upon the wind,—the loveliness Of flowers, unwithering in the sun's hot glance, The thousand hopes that high in Youth's brisk pulses dance: VI Why, and from what far region come ye back With bloom and youth all animate? ye seem Like airy voices on a blighted track, Peopling my slumber—sybils of a dream. If of your presence rightly I may deem, Ye are my better Genii! are ye come To quicken in my heart each earlier theme Of innocence, or with alarming drum, To beat a guilty knell, and strike conviction dumb? VII Our first affections are but ill resigned, The blossoms of tranquillity and peace, For the world's splendid guilt, which leaves behind Dark fruits and bitter weeds, the blind increase Of boiling billows from tumultuous seas, Which beating on a wild and desolate shore, Horrid with wrecks of innocence and ease, Behold our bark without or sail or oar, Drive to the gusty winds, and anchor nevermore. VIII Shut from the world of beauty and repose, There strive, there toil, there toss we; grasp a shade, A bubble, and an echo—to the close Dallying with danger, yet of nought afraid; Bridling the mad leviathan, yet swayed By every breath of Fortune, she who mocks The heart which wooes her, false, coquettish maid! Till when most seeming kind, her tempest's shocks Whirl our light boat—a wreck on ruin's lonely rocks! IX Ye come—the winning voices of the past, The warners of the future! I receive The revelations which ye bring, and cast All meaner broodings earthward, and thus leave Turmoil to worldly minions; here till eve With thee, O Nature, will I commune, gain Godlike impressions, from thy breast receive Thy milk, celestial aliment! O deign To take thy truant back, and staunch his wounds of pain. X A world is at my feet of flowers and fern, Cornfield and murmuring pine, vale, villa, heath, Aisles through whose sylvan vistas we discern All Heaven on high, and fruitfulness beneath. Shades of my love and infancy! bequeath A portion of your glory to my lay— A Pilgrim of the Woods; I twine a wreath Of wildflowers for thy revel, dancing May! My theatre the woods—my theme one vernal day. XI Still floats in the grey sky the moving moon, A crescent—o'er yon valley of black pines Where Night yet stands, a centinel; but soon In the far streaky east the morning shines, The Iris of whose bursting glory lines With fire the firmament; distinct and clear 'Gainst the white dawn proud Ridgemount high reclines His mural diadem:—lo! from his rear The breaking mists unfurl, and Day has reached me here. XII Here on a solitary hill I take My station—days on years thus hurry by, And of the varying present mar or make A gloom or bliss in Man's eternity: Suns rise—ascend—set—darken—and we die, The dewdrops of a morning, in whose glass All things look sparklingly;—alas! where I Now stand, in how brief time shall others pass, Nor heed, nor see the blade whereon my moisture was. XIII E'en as yon flower with hyacinthine bells Playful as light, which shivered by my tread, Is turned to dust and darkness—to all else It is as though it was not; swiftly sped Spoil o'er its bruised buds which blossomed A blending of all sweetnesses—what now?— A few years hence, and over this bent head, Dashing all life and gladness from the brow, The scythe of Time shall pass, and Ruin's silent plough. XIV Long ages since, upon his mountain-peak, The adoring Persian bent him to the flame Of the uprisen Sun, the whilst with shriek, And clang of soaring wings the eagle came From his precipitous eyrie;—See the same Vicegerent of the Deity ascend His watchtower in the zenith! by what name May I best greet thee? what new honour lend, Cradle of infant Time—his womb, birth, being, end! XV In wonder risest thou, material orb! And youthfulness—a symbol and a sign; Change, revolution, age, decay, absorb All other essences, but harm not thine: In thy most awful face reflected shine Thy Maker's attributes, Celestial Child! When shapelessness ruled chaos, the Divine Looked on the void tumultuous mass, and smiled— Then startedst thou to birth, and trod'st the pathless wild: XVI Girt like a giant for the speed, the flight, The toil of unsummed ages; in thy zone, Charmed into motion by thy sacred light, The glad earth danced around thee with the tone Of music—for then Eden was her own, And all things breathed of beauty,—chiefly Man Drank of an angel's joy; where are ye flown, Too fleeting suns? a mortal's thought may span Your course—for ye returned to whence your race began. XVII And we became all shadow—in the abyss, The spirit's desolation, here we stand, Wrestling in darkness for a heavenly bliss, And an immortal's essence: brightly grand, How climbest thou thy skies? nor lend'st a hand To help us to thy altitude! away Earthborn repinings—ye may not command A sparkle of that intellectual ray, Which yet from heaven descends, and communes with our clay. XVIII The dark Chaldee, Assyrian, Persian, Mede, The magic sons of pagan Babylon, Papyrus-scarfed Egyptian, sacred seed Of Abram—Greek, Goth, Vandal, Roman—gone! Where are the many worlds ye lost and won; Fame, laurels, empire, grandeur, glory, guilt, Sceptres, crowns, diadems? what can atone, Avengers! for the blood your pride has spilt? Can crumbled thrones, or swords though shivered to the hilt! XIX With heart all ecstasy, and eye all fire, Ye drank the morrow's freshness—haply wove Wreaths round the steel, and myrtles round the lyre, And woke with dance and revel the still grove, And heaped your incense at the shrine of Jove, And hoped your cinnamon should reach the sky To purchase fresh indemnities of love And power to whet your biting falchions by, Some bloodier field to win, and haughtier foes to try. XX And built you columns of Corinthian brass, Babels of stone, and pyramids of clay, And on the applause of millions sought to pass In apotheosis of light away— To be like Gods adored, and blest as they, The Romuli of earth—with Gods to class; And did your high ambition pave a way To them?—your pinnacles ye built on glass,— Dust—dust is all your tomb, and o'er it nods the grass, XXI Which sheds its seeds and withers; but the Spring Fair as Aurora in her purple cloud, Descends and wakens in their slumbering, Life from the ashes, beauty from the shroud, And speaks of immortality aloud To mourning man; and thus the flower I trod To its maternal dust shall issue proud Of its new birth, and on a greener sod Bow to the dallying winds—a sign to man from God. XXII Thus Life is twofold, twofold are our hopes; They die to bloom, they sink but to ascend, E'en as the hill I stand on downward slopes To that low vale which with a gentle bend Again aspires, as though resolved to end In nothing less than heaven: mark with what sweep Of proud pre-eminence the trees ascend! But with a softer grandeur, as to keep Watch o'er the sea beneath, lone, billowy, wild, and deep; XXIII And hollow as the mighty sea's scooped bed, And with a murmur like the mighty sea's, Heard afar off at intervals—the tread Of the dark waters breaking by degrees, To which the ear lists lovingly—but these Are of the green bough's wafture; here the fir Sits on its haughty hill, and as the breeze Vibrates, bids all its thousand branches stir, And ever as they move the pleasant sounds recur. XXIV And the lone Mount hath free and ample scope To wrap his mantle gloomily around His mass of shadow, like a misanthrope, Who breathes a vital scorn on the sweet ground, And heaven's blue tinct of loveliness, and sound Of lulling lutes, if chance they meet his ear: So stern and strict a penance has wrapt round Its top—it smiles not to the murmurs near, But loneliest looks and lowers when sunniest is the year. XXV And near its summit the funereal yew Hath built himself a pinnacle, and stands The guardian of the vale—whose dropping dew Binds with a deadly barrenness the sands Which loathe the weeds they nourish; to the bands Of its mysterious circle not the bee Comes, which all blossoms seeks, though it commands A berry beautiful as eye may see, Nor there one green herb grows, nor harebell of the lea. XXVI But well its shade would please the anchorite; There might he build him his monastic dome, Arch, cell, cave, cloister, altar, minaret, And moan and patter in that Gothic home O'er creeds of o'erpast centuries: but to roam Yon dell with moorland fragrance overspread In the sweet summer tide would ill become His ashy cheek, and heart to pleasure dead, For him that heathy couch were far too soft a bed. XXVII But I thereon in the warm luxury Of an Italian sky will fling me down Unscrupulously, lightly envy I The cowled monk's scapulaire or hermit's gown Woven of sackcloth, and a bed of down I scorn as lightly; but on Nature's breast, Mid flowers, and ferns, and freshness all her own, And soft airs giving sweetness sweeter zest, O who could slight such charms, who shun so pure a rest! XXVIII The far-extended prospect—the dim spire Which bounds the blue horizon—white walls seen In glittering distance—wreathing from the fire Of pastoral huts ascending smoke—the sheen Of hamlets humming in the morn—the green And beautiful hue of youth on every flower, And herb where Spring's betraying steps have been— The bright leaves sparkling in a sunny shower,— Music on every bough, and life in every bower: XXIX The plover's shrilly whistle—the quick call Of pheasants in their devious wanderings, The heifer lowing from the distant stall, And sudden flutter of the wild bird's wings, Invisible in passing—sunrise—springs Whose crystal gushings momently engage The babble of an echo—these are things Too mean, or far too lovely for a Sage With whom delight is crime, and solitude a cage. XXX But I not so have read the leaf of life In nature's volume, as to task my powers In mastery of my pleasures; sorrow, strife, Sufferings—they may be, as they have been ours, And our drooped eyes have met them with salt showers Which spoke without repining—they are gone Like to a biting viper, and my hours Somewhat for fruitless anguish would atone, But with a gentle aim, indulged as then alone. XXXI With a more melancholy tenderness, And more subdued intenseness, I would scan All scene, all life, all pleasure, all distress, The majesty and littleness of man; For Melancholy with my youth began, And marked me for her votary—wherefore not? Is being bliss? but as my being ran, My sufferings cherished, and my fire forgot, With a more placid mind I scrutinize our lot.— XXXII Sons of a Sire, to whom the earth is dust, And man all ashes, save the immortal part Which will outlive its sanctuary, he must Sustain, enjoy, weep, wither, and depart, To what new sphere he knows not—in the mart Of worldly selfishness, for him I learn Pity; 'tis in seclusion that my heart With aspirations to the skies will yearn, Imbibing mournful joy from her inspiring urn. XXXIII He who hath ne'er invested Solitude With an undying beauty, ne'er hath knelt In worship when her sceptre brought the mood Of melancholy o'er him, hath not felt Sweetness in sorrow—is not used to melt With the humanities of life, nor hears The whispered lore, the music which is dealt Invisibly around us from the spheres, The tender, bright, and pure—the Paradise of tears: XXXIV The ineffably serene, the kind regret Which speaks without upbraiding, the mild gloom Of thought without austerity, but yet Heavy with pensiveness, our future doom Seen without fear, presages which assume The features of an Angel—feelings grand— Grand, and of incommunicable bloom, The growth of Eden;—O, he hath not spanned The soul's infinitude with an Archangel's hand! XXXV Storm, wind, clouds, darkness, twilight, and deep noon, Summer and wizard Winter, and thou Eye Of most mysterious Night, thou moving Moon, Who yet hang'st out thy cresset in the sky, Pale, but still beautiful! ye know that I Have loved her as a Psyche, and have bound Her sweet zone round my loins when ye were by, And nought material uttered voice or sound; Whilst she her face unveiled, smiling when most ye frowned. XXXVI Spirit of Ossian! thou too from thy shroud Didst come and stand around me, charge with light The wood, the stream, the cave, the flashing cloud, The thunder and the loneliness of night, Charm with thy melancholy harp the flight Of Time, stern chronicler! and in the leaf Of waning Spring and the autumnal blight Of her last flower, subdue me into grief, To which Morn broke unloved, and woe wished no relief. XXXVII Thine was the darker solitude of heart, And solitude of sight—O, pang severe! Thou felt'st each Loved one, one by one depart Timelessly, till Time left thee not a tear To shed o'er all thy kindred, and the drear Vacuity of sorrow on thee lay;— But then thou took'st thy harp, Immortal Seer! And in the reliques of thy song, to Day Long buried deeds returned, and heroes of old sway. XXXVIII By tower all green with ruin, vacant hall, Or lonely cataract, I saw thee sit, Blind Prophet! visions swarming at thy call Tiresias-like—as fancy gave the fit To sorrow; their eyes shaded—their brows lit By an eclipsing moon—all substance passed, Or melted to a shadowy softness, writ By Pity's finger, whilst the murmuring blast Unfurled their airy halls, interminably vast; XXXIX And all the music of the elements Stirred in thy bosom, in the cherishing Of which sublime emotion—which intense Struggle—the Harp of Passion found a string Unknown before or after, for the spring Of harmony was fathomed, and the prize Was music most unhappy—a sweet thing Which Melancholy loves to realize,— Her punishment, pride, pain, gloom, glory in disguise. XL And at the Voice of Cona, things around Uttered similitude of grief; the wave Broke to the sad shore with a mellow sound, The dew hung on the floweret of the cave, Which sparkled droopingly; meanwhile the rave Of gusty winds spake loudly—calm anon And russet looked the mountain-tops which gave A smile as of enchanting seasons gone, And aye the Canna quaked, the cataract flowed on. XLI And thy Malvina is a peerless theme, Young, sorrowing, sweet, empassioned and refined, The embodied image of a poet's dream, Grace warm with feeling, Beauty fraught with mind— Fair as her sister-lilies—gentle, kind, And tempered all to tenderness—but she Soon flew a shadowy Spirit on the wind, And left the Last One of his line to be A single shivering leaf on ruin's hoary tree. XLII Such as I was in those delicious days, Smit with the love of sadness, see me still— A lover of the lines on nature's face, The gloomy forest and the lonely hill, My haunt the rustling pines—a leaping rill My Castaly—inspiring as when first I touched the simple harp with simple skill, And in its wild tones sought to slake the thirst Which classic Milton woke, and wizard Ossian nursed. XLIII Sunbeams of Song! ye were my waking bliss, The visions of my slumber; in the shade To steep my light cares in forgetfulness, Lightly dispersed, I called ye to my aid: At noontide in the boundless forest laid, I heard you from its deep recesses fling Voices like Ariel's musical, whilst played The bee amid the bluebells murmuring, Who comes e'en now around with memories on her wing. XLIV Rise to my thought the shadows and the sheen As then, of the sought sylvans; the green bough Waving at will—dun deer at distance seen Starting, in flight—if but a zephyr blow; The bittern's sullen shriek—the water's flow O'er mosses, sauntering idly in the sun,— A thousand stirring fancies come and go With thy revisiting sound, but, Murmuring One! What grieves thy happy wing that thou so soon art gone? XLV Why didst thou come to bring those moments back, And make me yet more mournful? severed Friends! Am I not now companionless? the track Of innocent boyhood in a desert ends To which your names are stages;—Youth ascends The zenith—I review the past with pain; In what far regions strive ye? my soul blends In secret with you—Life's elastic chain Snapt with your parting steps—Fate, join those links again! XLVI North, on a mild declivity of hill, Stands a hoar oak, majestic root! the growth Of rolling centuries, and haughtier still, Unbent beneath their passing pressure, both Scornful, and scorning ruin; Time looks loth To smite at it with his devouring scythe, Nor sends one spoiling canker with fell tooth To gnaw its core, and in its ashes writhe; But o'er it Spring looks green, beneath it dances blithe. XLVII There isolate it stands, and from its height Sees generations in their ebb and flow; The mighty tide sweeps on in dark and bright, Hope, danger, doubt, tranquillity, and woe;— First, Infancy runs round thee to and fro, And makes him acorn-cups the dews to sip; Years pass—the Infant sits a Youth below, With Beauty in Love's holy guardianship, Sighs at his beating heart, and kisses on his lip. XLVIII He glows, and is made wretched! for the spell Of love when most it works is most unkind, And if its first touch is untunable, It leaves a blasting ecstasy behind— Its sweets are changed to wormwood; for the mind Cannot its dragon-folds at will uncoil; Is not the passion masterless and blind, Hoping 'gainst hope, redoubling toil on toil? Unblessed—the mad tears start, the heart-drops overboil. XLIX But give the Youth his angel! on his cheek Let Manhood set his signet, see him blest— Moons speed, cares thicken, patience waxeth weak, And all too soon, Age seeks thee in the quest Of a light slumber—of a little rest, Or wraps his mantle closer in the chill, Quick breath of Winter;—shrinking in his vest, He grasps his staff, and totters down the hill, His pulse beats, flutters, fails—one throb—and all is still! L And chattering Infancy assumes again Thy acorn-cups, and o'er the turf so late Trod by her lost sire, sings and weaves a chain Of bluebells and anemonies—elate, And forming to her hopes as fair a fate As the sweet flowers she kisseth; but the noon Of years, as of the day, with withering weight And hot breath, passes o'er the twined festoon,— She blossoms with the flower, and droops almost as soon! LI Turn from the thought—the season and the hills As yet are breathing beauty; all is Youth Around, undarkened by prelusive ills, The fanciful of being with the truth; And who, whilst yet the current lingereth smooth And every wave reflects a flower above, Would mar it with a wrinkle? let it soothe In spring to shun the raven for the dove Who cooes, herself untaught, yet ever teaching Love. LII Hid in a bushy grove, where every wind That stirs showers down new blossoms from its wings, Like a lorn voice, all querulous but kind, In love with grief, that turtle sits and sings To the wood-echoes of a thousand things To which her bosom beateth; of her mate From her side too long absent—of the springs, Her pastime, all unvisited of late, Since that a mother's cares were added to her state. LIII Cares and a mother's transports! fear and joy, Meek gentleness and calm solicitude; The very breathing winds those fears employ, And now a voice and footfall in the wood: Listening, alive to aught that may intrude, What can a mother-bird so gentle do But o'er her young more flutteringly to brood, And kiss them with her bill, and sweetlier coo, And them not e'er forsake whatever ills ensue! LIV Peace, fearful one! 'tis but a passer-by, The fond impatience of a village maid, Who seeks to trace thy dwelling with her eye, And bless thy tones, then plunges in the shade: Why of Ianthe's steps art thou afraid? She threads this lonely thicket but to cull The ripest flowers on which the sun has played, Of which this hazel covert is so full, And now an orchis seek, and now a primrose pull. LV And arm in arm with her Viola trips, And with an osier basket on her arm, A murmured song is on her moving lips, Her looks with busy hope and rapture warm; Her eyes the violets which she seeks inform, Eyes glittering on you like two Naiad founts Of purest azure—skies without a storm: Each valley she descends, each hill she mounts, Springs to her lurking flower, and every one recounts. LVI And tears down woodbines from the branching planes To crown her stores, and form her coronal, That scarce her Sister of the Wood sustains The heaping coil of leaves which round her fall; Soon overflowing is her basket small, But she the more her busy office plies, And calls Ianthe nearer—to her call Ianthe comes—fresh flowers rain from the skies, Then laugheth she aloud, and followeth her who flies. LVII And far behind them rosy infants run, Two darling shoots from one sustaining spray— For one lorn parent rears their youth, and one Though loved, is as a stranger passed away. She, when to her sequestered home they stray Fondling each other, in their deep-blue eyes, Looks—how endearingly! and seemeth gay, But for their sweet caresses gives them sighs, And aye the more they smile, more fast her tears arise. LVIII But they know not her source of grief, or soon Forget all sense of sorrow in the chase Of fantasies, on which the mutable moon Stamps all the changes of her wexing phase, Joy in them all! now with unequal pace Those virgins of the village they pursue, But frequent pause them in the panting race, To seize some fallen flowers besprent with dew, And prank each other's breast with quaint devices new. LIX Small choice make they of what the green-wood bower Scatters so lavishly—the daisy pied, The purple hyacinth, Apollo's flower, Fresh kingcups, and sweet cowslips crimson-eyed, Blushing anemonies which plucked, have died With the first wind, red lychnis, blue eyebright, And many a golden cup which loves the tide, The oxeye pale, the laurel blossom light, Are gathered all in turn, in turn abandoned quite. LX For, lo! a wilderness of lilies, whither The merry hum of bees attracts their eye! The rosy boy on tiptoe flieth thither, His timid sister nothing does but fly In fear of the winged insects; sad and shy At length her secret the coy creature tells— He on them rushes shouting—none are nigh, They may fall down and fill their lap with bells, In a delicious dream, unheedful of all else. LXI E'en thus, when Delos started from the wave Sacred, to blossom in perpetual May, E'en thus, on myrtles in a pleasant cave, The infant Phœbus and Diana lay: A triple crown of sunbeams did the day Knit round the awful temples of its god, On her the crescent cast a lunar ray, And tall trees bowed in homage, whilst the sod Poured forth a thousand flowers where sportively they trod. LXII There rest you, Wearied Ones! at pleasure use What childhood's Amalthean horn may grant; If on your lids fall slumber's golden juice, May wizard Fancy be your pursuivant Into her fairy halls, around your haunt Music and floating whispers lull your ear, But may the noxious adder coil aslant, Nor grey gnat sound his shrill reveillé near, With bitter venom wound, or cause one sorrowing tear! LXIII Sleeping—perchance the redbreasts may behold, And deem you shapes of beauty passed away, And with their bills, as beldames oft have told The tale, aspire to make your pillow gay, Bringing you odorous herbs and mosses gray, As to the Innocents of yore, whom grief Slew without fault, and for your shroud array The ashy-pale rosemary, mourner chief, And many a lily-flower, and many a lily-leaf. LXIV Look on that Flower—the Daughter of the Vale, The Medicean statue of the shade! Her limbs of modest beauty, aspect pale, Are but by her ambrosial breath betrayed. There, half in elegant relief displayed, She standeth to our gaze, half-shrinking shuns; Folding her green scarf like a bashful Maid Around, to screen her from her suitor suns, Not all her many sweets she lavisheth at once. LXV Locked in the twilight of depending boughs, Where night and day commingle, she doth shoot Where nightingales repeat their marriage-vows; First by retiring, wins our curious foot, Then charms us by her loveliness to suit Our contemplation to her lonely lot; Her gloom, leaf, blossom, fragrance, form, dispute Which shall attract most belgards to the spot, And loveliest her array who fain would rest unsought. LXVI Her gloom, the aisle of heavenly solitude; Her flower, the vestal Nun who there abideth; Her breath, that of celestials meekly wooed From heaven; her leaf, the holy veil which hideth; Her form, the shrine where purity resideth; Spring's darling, nature's pride, the sylvans' queen— To her at eve enamoured Zephyr glideth, Trembling, she bids him waft aside her screen, And to his kisses wakes—the Flora of the scene. LXVII But O, the thousand charms of this wood-cover, The plain, the steep, the musical, the still, The sad, the cheerful! here may Nature's lover For ever taste, yet never have his fill: The tangled valley now becomes a hill, The hill a glade, the glade a vista riven From depth of groves, and then we view at will Far towns and plains, and where earth blends with heaven Blue Ocean seems to roll, and mimic waves are driven. LXVIII And thus we wander, e'en as though a spell Clung to our footsteps, and transformed the view; Making the bosky hill a pansied dell, And tinging all things with Enchantment's hue. Small need have we of Ariadne's clue, To guide us through our labyrinth to-day; Here, where each step creates a landscape new, Here, where to linger is a sweet delay, O, who would not be lost within a maze so gay! LXIX Hark to the merry Gossip of the spring— The sweet mysterious voice which peoples place With an Italian beauty, and does bring As 'twere Elysium from the wilds of space Where'er her wing inhabits! give it chace, In other bowers the Fairy shouts again; Where'er we run it mocks our rapid race— Still the same loose note in a golden chain Rings through the vocal woods, and fills with joy the plain. LXX Hail to thee, shouting Cuckoo! in my youth Thou wert long time the Ariel of my hope, The marvel of a summer! it did soothe To listen to thee on some sunny slope, Where the high oaks forbade an ampler scope Than of the blue skies upward—and to sit, Canopied, in the gladdening horoscope Which thou, my planet flung—a pleasant fit, Long time my hours endeared, my kindling fancy smit. LXXI And thus I love thee still—thy monotone The self-same transport flashes through my frame, And when thy voice, sweet Sybil, all is flown My eager ear, I cannot chuse but blame. O may the world these feelings never tame! If age o'er me her silver tresses spread, I still would call thee by a lover's name, And deem the spirit of delight unfled, Nor bear, though grey without, a heart to Nature dead! LXXII Thus too the Grasshopper is still my friend, The minute-sound of many a sunny hour Passed on a thymy hill, when I could send My soul in search thereof by bank and bower, Till lured far from it by a foxglove flower Nodding too dangerously above the crag, Not to excite the passion and the power To climb the steep, and down the blossoms drag, Them the marsh-crocus joined, and yellow water-flag. LXXIII Shrill sings the drowsy Wassailler in his dome, Yon grassy wilderness where curls the fern, And creeps the ivy; with the wish to rove He spreads his sails, and bright is his sojourn 'Mid chalices with dews in every urn: All flying things a like delight have found— Where'er I gaze, to what new region turn, Ten thousand insects in the air abound, Flitting on glancing wings that yield a summer-sound. LXXIV And chief the Fly, upon whose fans are spread Hues with which summer warms the occident At the rich sunset, epicure in taste, Beholds the odorous light, and deems it lent For amorous pastime, and in truth seems bent To find or form a paradise below;— With blooms and herbs of every various scent Dallies her tongue—her wings expanded show Like ornamented clouds hung round by Iris' bow. LXXV O'er mead, moor, river, garden, forest, mount, In her gay search the delicate Lady flies, Tries every odour, sips of every fount, Nor trusts her form but to most crystal skies. Coquettish in her motions, how she tries Thousand admiring hearts to captivate! The Swallow too pursues so bright a prize, Wins, and destroys—so Beauty bows to Fate, Caught in the toils she spread, to be bewailed too late. LXXVI That pageant past, comes the quick Squirrel forth From his high cedar with a burst and bound, To sport upon the warm grass of the earth Feeding, and wave his graceful brush around, And pause—and prick his ears, and at each sound List in a breathless attitude, and start If far away intruding steps resound: With feet already raised to spring, to dart On to the nearest pine, but claims a moment's part. LXXVII Anon he cowers upon a branch, and thence Looks deeply down on his pursuer's shape, And yet alarmed, on his glad eminence Stamps wrathfully, then looks a laughing ape, Playing his thousand pranks o'er an escape Almost too lofty for our eye to reach Through the thick gloom, then hies he to the rape Of the pine's cones, or to his nest, the pleach Of many a wilding bough in the next giant beech. LXXVIII This his spring-life—e'en when the October wind His firm beech rocks with a sea-murmur loud, That squirrel the same merry mime I find— A mariner on his vibrating shroud: Though darkly glooms the burning thunder-cloud, And rends with sulphurous bolt some mighty tree, He hears the roar as fearlessly and proud As a Fleet-admiral when dark—alee, The fiery battle joins, and chaos shakes the sea. LXXIX Hush! for the most shy Pheasant leaves the brakes To bask her beauteous plumage in the sun, Which, as in love with its bright colours, makes A hundred brilliant Irises of one. Autumn is past: the desolating gun Haunts not her dreaming sleep; she now may tread, A Princess, through the halls she wont to shun, Silence around, and verdurous domes o'erhead, More high exalt her crest, her whirring pinions spread. LXXX She looks down on a swarming multitude, The Commonwealth of Ants—a populace Moved by one mighty aim, a nation's good; Instructive lesson to a haughtier race! For here no selfish ministers efface The charter step-dame Nature first designed, The people's independence; nor for place, Truck to a crown their dignity of mind— The Emmet's polity leaves Europe's far behind. LXXXI They throne prosperity in grainy hives, Her throne has been an armed seignorage; Their social bond through centuries survives, Hers homicide infracts in every age; A spotless quiet is their heritage, Hers the keen scythe of fierceness and of guilt; At but a breath—her myrmidons engage In fratricidal crime, and blood is spilt, Till Power's all-evil blade is shivered to the hilt— LXXXII The voice of purple Pride, whose barbarous rod, Shaken o'er vassal-realms, in time became Consociated with the cross of God, A bigot torch, lit at revenge's flame, To be the scourge of nations! of this frame Empires and thronedoms have been, and are made— Erewhile to crumble at some mighty name, Philip or Mahmoud—or that Giant Shade Who struck at crowns for France, and was by France betrayed! LXXXIII O, with what sweet abruptness to this bower Of woodbine comes the music of those bells, Blown by the dissolute winds! a marriage hour Is nigh, that sound can chronicle nought else. Over the uplands, into the gay dells Momently sinking, momently to rise, It rings around a syren-mass of spells— To the bride-maid some silenced hopes and sighs, And many a smile and tear in two fond bridal eyes. LXXXIV To One I deem it brings remembered trace Of a faint dream, a phantasm of delight, When the fresh morning wore a cherub's face, And there were tears and sufferings long ere night. When unsubdued Affection hastes to plight Long summer-vows to a maid's icy frown, There is no sun, no shade, no bud, no blight, He can feel more—albeit, romantic town! Ring out thy merry bells till yon tired sun goes down. LXXXV But the young mourner, his first pangs gone by, Consorted by the sacred Sisters nine, In their communion finds tranquillity, Served with nepenthe from their spring divine, Which laps the soul in gentleness benign, Reversing what the Fatal Sisters weave;— This gift, Alonzo, this should now be thine, Woo thee a kinder Fair and cease to grieve, Assured no future hope can like the past deceive. LXXXVI Then still, romantic Town! thy sweet bells ring, Waft it o'er primroses to his lulled ear, Wind of the south! not one tone scattering, The pleasant sound might make a desart dear; What, where of all her charms the virgin year Wistfully flings the sweetest, as to crown With mirth the melancholious? Lo! tis here She builds her bower—then still, romantic Town! Ring out thy merry bells till yon tired sun goes down. LXXXVII Wensdon! up thy sequestered hill I spring, Thy hill of broom, with flowers on every stem; Of these secluded precincts thou art King, And mak'st the mountain-pines thy diadem. Thy yellow sands are an enchasing gem To those who love thee, for thou dost bequeath A far pervading vision unto them:— Here many a sheepbell tinkles on the heath, Green waves the fir above—a cottage smokes beneath— LXXXVIII In a blue Pillar to the sky, so calm Is Heaven's high cærule vault!—the palisade Round the nigh garden sweeping, throws a charm, A pastoral beauty round the lovely maid Verduta, culturing roses with her spade, And watering them erewhile—needs but a fount Of dulcet waters bubbling in its shade To make the hill of glorified account, As Aganippe bursts beneath the Muses' mount. LXXXIX But the still Picture far away expands Into an ampler scope for ear and eye; Herds low—flocks graze—distant a hamlet stands, Its steeple tolling as the breeze blew by. We may discern an antique Library, Where blossomed lilachs shake in bright relief Their tassels—with whose grateful tint may vie The green Corn, rising into lofty leaf On plains which Ceres piles with a redundant sheaf. XC Art thou a lover of thy race? advance, And view a nation's opulence in seed; A child of nature? lo! the woodlands dance, The vales are vocal with the shepherd's reed. A patriot? England's garner is thy meed— A soldier? bear thy idle honours hence, For on this stage no gladiators bleed; The patriot's glory and the sage's sense Inhabit with the lark, and she is Innocence. XCI Where the flute warbles, should the war-drums knoll? Where ripen vines, should conflagrations curl? Should nature's leaf become a shrivelled scroll? Where wave her pines should bannerols unfurl? Should Murder her destroying lightnings hurl, Sweet Freedom! o'er thy populated plains, To seas of blood transform thy streams of pearl, And turn thy rosy fillets into chains? Should e'en a Wellesley tread the turf which yet retains— XCII Remembrance of our Howard? you have seen, Hung round with delicate herbs, a little rill Gush into life, and make creation green, Where'er ‘it glideth at its own sweet will,’ Heaven settles on its face—its course is still, Nor would betray its currents as they pass, Did not a livelier colour clothe the hill, The valley-flowers, the moss of the morass— Like to that little rill benignant Howard was: XCIII A Spirit in our wilderness below, Scattering ambrosial verdure, sanctified For the severe discipleship of Woe, Pity's apostle, Duty was his bride. By him no panacea was denied Which lulled affliction—Mercy was his tone, His acts the good man's wish personified— Lutes—whose sweet strains were touched for heaven alone, But by the winds betray'd, and o'er far billows blown. XCIV Aspley! thy pleasant bowers his feet have wooed, The Pilgrim came and loved them, for on thee There doth repose a holy quietude, The inspiring Genius of philanthropy: Within yon simple mansion, where the bee Murmurs and feeds all June amid the limes, Paused a few sunny hours the Devotee, Ere yet again he sought in scorching climes Each dreadful Lazar-house of sicknesses and crimes. XCV His deeds are scions of a nobler stem Than laurels gathered in a nation's tears; With healthy tenderness we turn to them, And grey Tradition chronicles for years The walk where once an age the man appears Shaped out by deep communings with the sky, Heaven's Mercury to earth—whom earth reveres: Bowers fall—yet here thy memory should not die, But like the Banyan spread, and flower immortally. XCVI Yes! still amid this beauteous Theatre His gentle spirit seems to hover round, The vallies breathe of him; of him the fir, Vibrating, whispers in a silver sound. It is his voice which hills to hills resound, As echo to enchanted echo calls: I gaze—I rove on consecrated ground, Where broods his gentleness—his mantle falls;— Groves, vallies, warbling hills, and ornamented Halls. XCVII Such talisman within my mind awakes The melting sweetness of the Month I sing: The spirit its own gloom or Eden makes Whene'er it wills to strike the secret spring Of Good or Evil: for we have a string Which touched aright divinely will respond, Like Love amid blown roses—as we bring Virtue in sight, of Virtue we grow fond, We are not of the earth—our spirits soar beyond. XCVIII Yet here the warrior in his armed hall Sate throned in evil state in ages gone, A powerful prince within his Capitol— And whensoe'er he blew his Saxon horn, Corn blazing, hamlets rifled, virgins torn Weeping away from their paternal cot, His ravage marked with blood—a little Urn Of marble now is all the Guises' lot, They came and passed away—they won and are forgot! CXIX Yon Church contains their ashes—enter there! Through arched aisle, low cell, and gallery dim, To purge the stain from off the scimitar, Dark murmurs stole of orison and hymn. There, but no more armipotent of limb, Some man of many sins recumbent lies Pillowed on stone, and there antiquely grim, His hands beseech the offended Deities, Clasped, as in love with life whilst passing to the skies. C The crest, the spear, the banner, and the plume, Emblazoned shield, and iron-twisted mail— Which lent devices to their sculptured tomb, Pomp to their battles—can they more avail? Alas for them the maid, the widow's wail, The morning spoil, the midnight sacrilege! On high that stony warrior will wax pale When thousand tongues the heavenly throne besiege, And the scorned Vassals' wrongs condemn the guilty Liege. CI From Jenghis-Kahn to terrible Mahmoud, Trace Slaughter through all chronicles to Cain, From Cain to Cæsar—from the Hounds of blood, Peru's fierce spoilers, to the Scourge of Spain— 'Tis the same Tale! first pride, ambition then, The spur of frenzy, anger's trumpet-call, Mirth, murder, victory; a boast—a stain— Last, closing conscience with her snakes and pall— Enough! the Conqueror bends, and Nations bless his fall! CII 'Tis well! his life was like the Upas-tree, The curse of all his kind! who touched him, drew Contagion from the contact, they might flee, But guilt, the Simoom, ever would pursue; And still around would hang the fatal dew, Corroding what it poisoned to the core, Tinging the bough till lividly it grew All ashes! as the shirt of Nessus bore Torture, and tears, and shrieks, to Hercules of yore. CIII Away! all else is whiteness by his side: A many-chambered Hall before me stands— The House of Learning flings its portals wide, And Knowledge bears within his ample hands The volumes of the dead; at his commands What busy pupils class the tribes of mind And banquet upon fruitage! as he scans The past—long ages will their scrolls unbind, See Rome her eagles bear, and Greece her clarions wind. CIV Sages again and legislators build The wealth of realms, the policy of states, Numa, and Solon, and Lycurgus, wield Their ivory sceptres at the city-gates. Cumæan Sibyls here aread the Fates, With holy fillets there the priest divines, There the grave Senate holds its dread debates, Here speaks a Cicero, a Cimon shines, And gay Anacreon bathes his song in Teian wines. CV Bends to their sway the ductile soul of youth, Now touched, stung, softened, mellowed, rapt, on fire, As pity, fervour, eloquence, zeal, truth, Or music glances on the electric wire Which moves their passions. Hark they to the lyre Which Horace, Virgil, and Tibullus strung To satire, war, and love; or what the Sire Of verse, divine Melesigenes sung, Strains—through the lapse of years imperishably young. CVI O glorious records of the march of Time, Gems of a world in shadow and decay! Whilst you exist to soften and sublime— Earth's noblest relics are not passed away. The birth of Empire seems of yesterday, Seen through your telescope; lo! cycles, suns Melt to a span,—man seems a child to play Beside Creation's waters, yet at once Pervades her glassy stream, all sweeping as it runs.— CVII Yet are those Halls not always dedicate To Grecian sweetness and Ausonian lore; Some hours there are when pastime can create Of simple pleasures an unblemished store— Pleasures, by past restraint enhanced the more, Welcomed with smiles, and closed without a sigh: Why in the noon of manhood evermore Should the fair flowers of morning-promise die Around the heart, whose bloom no future can supply?— CVIII Nor want there happier hours when hours are sweetest With mirth and music to awake delight, When eyes the most benign and steps the fleetest, Do make a dancing vigil of the night. When the whole room is beautiful and bright, And on young lips the heart's warm sunshine dwells, When voices are melodious as the light, And pleading Love to blushing Beauty tells Regards in pleasing tones, but pleasing from none else;— CIX When in the shadow of each full dark orb He sees the Morning-star of Passion break, And the dear smiles which all his soul absorb, Around her cheeks a warm Aurora make, Fair as the Sunrise on a mountain lake; When at each tread of her harmonious toe, Pendants, like dew-drops on the lily, shake And odorous tresses negligently throw Sweets round the breathing room, a twilight round her brow: CX Then—let the meditative mind retire To some near region of illumined ground. The spell begins: fond fairy hands aspire To deal the magic of emotions round; The woods are filled with a voluptuous sound Now floating full, now faint upon the ear, And tones are heard to swell, and feet to bound, Which heavenly Dian curbs her car to hear, And all the sparkling stars which make chaste night so dear. CXI The uncurtained window looks a gay recess, A burst of unexampled brilliancy, And there are forms of finished loveliness In scarf, and robe, and flowers, seen sweeping by; A gorgeous crowd is ever in the eye, Divinest of imaginable things! The wizard Fancy throws his heavenly dye On all, and each resounding valley rings To the rich, kissing touch of instrumental strings. CXII To sit thus in a blissful solitude, With mirth around and innocence within, With no disturbing passion to intrude, To mark the Vision and its rites begin— The invisible Eye of All—this is to win The dream o'er which ecstatic Milton smiled Ere yet he communed with the Cherubin;— It hath a sense, sweet, wonderful, and wild, And well may suit the vein of a poetic Childe. CXIII He who is wise will gather joy from joy, And bid the busy brain of sadness sleep, When Life has no amusement to employ Thought in her chambers, it may soothe to weep. But the Lethean stream should not be deep, To drown reflection is but to alarm— We have a few Elysian drops to steep, And this is one, our sadnesses with balm, No Moralist need frown on a so simple charm. CXIV But the shade shortens: 'tis the sultry hour, The hush of noon—siesta of the day; The wind has left the field, the dew the flower, The gathered flower droops witheringly away. Where have I wandered? whither do I stray With half-shut eye, in wildering reverie? Leave thou thy air-built palace to the Gay— Thy spell is broken—broken let it be, Winningly waves the Wood, to its Lycæum flee. CXV Hail and farewell, sweet Valley! though farewells Are vainly given to grieve o'er thine and thee, For thou dost colour the mind's secret cells With prism-tints, from which we cannot flee, Most vivid still in absence! and our knee Devoutly bent beneath a vault so blue To the Great Spirit, never can be free; We pause—turn—linger—love—admire anew, Hallowing the ground where first our inspiration grew. CXVI Hail and farewell! farewell a little while, Vision of beauty! with the yellowing leaf, I come to watch thy melancholy smile, The music of thy features spent in grief O'er their decay, a glory bright but brief, Pathetic sweetness to the heart applied; Who could view Winter—a Plutonic thief, Coming to claim thee for his Mourning Bride, Nor shed few parting tears of passion and of pride? CXVII The scene recedes. Welcome these aisles of larch, The walk of happy spirits! so the mind May fitly deem, that views the heavenly arch Hung o'er it like a Sapphire: look behind! Earth shows a mossy Eden just resigned By Adam, no more mingling with the blest, For they are vanished—and a wandering wind Comes with its whispering dirges from the west, And the green shady bank is wooing to be pressed. CXVIII 'Tis sweet to throw at will, as now I throw My limbs upon the dainty lap of May, And hold in dalliance the ripe flowers which grow Confusedly among the lichens gray. Is this Titania's bower, where fairies play Their antique revels in the glowworm's sight? Moss and wild thyme are all the weeds which stray To pave her palace with a green delight— Thus then for dulcet dreams and slumber's soothing rite. END OF CANTO I. CANTO II. “O Primavera gioventù de l'anno, Bella madre di fiori, D'herbe novelle, e di novelli amori; Tù torni ben, ma teco Non tornano i sereni E fortunati dì de le mie gioie.” GUARINI. I 'Twas sweet I said to throw yourself at noon Loose on May flowers and placidly repose, Whilst twine o'erhead in many a fair festoon The gadding woodbine and the sweet-briar rose. But sweeter far, as airy music flows From the grove's orchestra above, around, In the open sky to wake. He only knows How laughs the sun, and on the grassy ground What chequering shadows lie, and what bright tints abound. II I was still dreaming when I heard the boughs Parted asunder with a gentle noise, But yet the falling blossoms could not rouse My soul entranced, though conscious of its joys. I heard the low of kine, but 'twas my choice Not to be stirred, and thus I slumbered still; Till high methought I heard Acasia's voice Call me with songs up her dear native hill— Why did I wake so soon? 'twas but the linnet's bill; III Which breaks the crystal air in sounds that gush Clear as a fountain from its jasper base, And warm as if its little heart would rush To ruin with the music. From the face Of the pure firmament light shadows chase Each other o'er our world, as flies the rack, Softening the sunbeam for a little space, And saddening all the landscape in its track, Till the cloud parts like snow, and the sweet ray comes back. IV On my hot brow, diffuse, delicious breeze, The coolness of thy chalice! thus to lie In the fresh shadow of the flickering trees, Gloom on the grass but glory in the sky; And mix with idlesse a calm dignity, Which finds a moral in the slightest thing, The whisper of a leaf—a lulling fly— All changes which the cuckoo-seasons bring, Is to draw bliss from toil, sounds from a tuneless string. V I cannot wrap in hideous vacancy Mind's glorious faculties—upon the stream Of Thought my gondola I love to ply In search of greener shades, a fresher dream. Drive wheresoe'er it will, let shade or beam Glance on its painted prow from cloud or sun, There fails not solemn or romantic theme To light the gorgeous waters as they run— Awake, ye mighty Shades! my vigil is begun. VI And O, what page can charm the lingering noon Like thine, wild Master of the mask and pall, Shakspeare! prince, patriot, wizard, mime, buffoon, All—all in turn, and great alike in all. The cold, the loved, the crowned obey thy call, Now Passion thrills us and now Terror shakes— The bridal now becomes a bloody Hall, The feast a couch from which no sleeper wakes, Where Murder plants her stab, the Furies coil their snakes. VII The sweet, the grand, the fair, the terrible, The foul, the fond, the hideous and the bright, The summer's vision, the magician's spell, The stars, and the proud thunders of the night; The sightless steeds of agonised affright, Whispers of love and battailous uproar, Burn in thy thoughts and radiate into light, Which Time repeats and Feeling must adore;— What new sublimer worlds shall Genius hence explore! VIII Here Cæsar, recent from barbaric wars, Leads Rome in chains—the purple robe assumes; There a loud shout thrice strikes the golden stars, The deed is done, and Liberty resumes Her march: to horse! to horse! a thousand plumes Wait round the midnight Brutus in his tent. Wan in the midst his warning Genius glooms With finger to Philippi! a lament Floats round the seven-hill'd Town—its last lorn pennon rent. IX There stands the gentle-musing misanthrope, The Prince of faded passions, on whose breast Sorrow writes madness—he whose sweetest hope Droops like narcissus, when the winds o'the west Gather its willing leaves; forlorn his vest— The fool of Fortune, with keen feelings cursed, To be a proud King's terror and his jest: The dark grave crops his rose—the rose he nursed, What can his heart do now but wither, bleed, and burst! X O for a love like thine, dear Imogen, Unchanged in absence, undeprest by ill! Those rueful storms which shake the faith of men, Left thee the same fond, trusting woman still. Tears for thy tale! the elder grows at will Rank o'er a crumbling ruin with the rose, Which then her essence sweetest does distil, Like Virtue run to wildness with her woes— So, through thy weeds of grief, Love's mossy buds unclose. XI Or, we will climb the mountainous cliff which hangs O'er the mad surge, unheard so high, with Lear. He is a chaos of all passions—pangs Have hurled presiding Reason from her sphere: His eyes are stormy, but without a tear— Them wrath has scorched! his majesty but brings The fiery-flying lightnings yet more near, To strike the Tower round which one sweet root clings, Whilst the wolf howls beneath, and the hid scorpion stings. XII Proud as those fires, dallying with nought but clouds, Wild as their will, and blasting as their stroke, His brooding, bright ambition Richard shrouds Beneath a painted mask—a muffling cloke— Till works his poison, and all bonds are broke Which kept him from his dazzling wish; when won, Glideth the subtle aspic from his Oak, To rear his soldier-crest unto the sun, And flesh his fangs in blood—avenged ere day be done. XIII But May is ripe with roses virginal Unplucked of summer, where no serpent's tooth May bubble forth its venom; ere the fall Was sweetness and the stainlessness of truth, And unpresuming love—and it may soothe To mark their rays of radiance meet in thee Cæsario or Viola—maid or youth— Thy love is unsunned honey, which the bee Cells beneath briery boughs that eye may never see. XIV Break off! a Phantom moves through marble halls In gloomy stateliness—night's shrieking bird Flaps the friezed window with her wing which falls Hollowly on the ear—my brain is stirred— But she who bears the taper hath not heard, With fearful visions her wild eye is glassed Staring in slumberous trance, and many a word Of guilt from her divining lips have passed, Whilst the Weird Sisters laugh astride the groaning blast. XV Sweet winter-blossom, by a wind too rude Tossed on the waters of a stormy sea, Which Heaven with greater tenderness endued Than thy sire's heart—alas, that such should be! Young Perdita! O let me walk with thee Through all thy fortunes; exiled as a thing Of ill—a worm from a degraded tree; But thee erewhile the handmaids of the Spring Transplant to rosy bowers on Pleasure's April wing. XVI Gold in a rock! who hides his casket so? Timon of Athens; mark his gloomy stare— A yellow Lion glaring on his foe— His soul was bountiful and trusting, e'er That trusting bounty wove itself the snare, In which all rage is powerless. To the cave He shouts his wrongs—it babbles his despair; He hath betook him to the savage wave Of the resounding sea, and dug him there a grave. XVII Or to the ‘modern Timon’ let us turn, Childe Harold. See Addition to the Preface. Whose deep misanthropy winds like a spell Around our young affections, till they burn With feelings—visions which no tongue can tell. Harold! with thy dark grandeur I will dwell All mad and moody being as thou art, In the eye of fiery zealots, who compel Thy Prince to wrap a mask about his heart— With smiles we ever meet, and 'tis with sighs we part. XVIII Whether in Rome we hear the authentic voice Of her sad Genius, or in Athens mourn, In sweet Egeria's mossy grots rejoice, Or wildly weeping clasp dear Thyrza's urn; Now briefly kind, now stoically stern, Censor or soph, the scorner or the sage, To thee we cling, and drink at every turn Freedom, and fire, and pathos from thy page, Through every varied scene which marks thy Pilgrimage. XIX In naked gloominess the Pilgrim stands— No hope to woo, no danger to appal, In Christian, Turkish, and Barbaric lands, Without his like, and saturnine in all, His honey-drops of pleasure turned to gall, Raising the fever which they sought to slake— A Statue on its marble pedestal, Whose nervous limbs some unguessed passions shake, Where Grief seems to repose or Agony to ache. XX There is one golden chord in Being's lyre, One trembling string to finest issues wrought, If a beloved finger touch the wire, It deals around amid the heaven of thought Elysian lightnings with like music fraught: Once snapt—no hand re-strings it, or can steal The vestal flame which visits it unsought, But on the instrument Gloom sets his seal— This stroke the poet's heart hath felt—doth hourly feel. XXI What marvel then if Fancy should rebel Against her first creations, and thus shape Shadows on canvass—Tasso in his cell, A Corsair anchoring off a Turkish cape, A fiery Giaour, a Selim in escape Bleeding in death—or Hugo's fatal flame? The cup which sparkled with the bright blue grape If filled with wormwood to the brim, will claim A harsh and bitter hue—the spirit does the same. XXII Then to its first romantic dream recurring, Recals the fugitive which Pride exiled; Its first emotions in the pulse are stirring, And roses fix and flourish in the wild. Hence Love, pure, warm, and guileless as a child, Rises from the Pactolus of his mind— Leila the lovely, and Medora mild, Zuleika—a mimosa from the wind, Folding her shrinking leaves, and Florence fair and kind. XXIII A dream to wake from, and to weep that such Was not accorded to his lonely lot, Dark Disappointment! at whose withering touch The past—all but the present is forgot; And the mind colours all things with a blot Of midnight, in whose depth no star may burn, Making that seem to be, which yet is not— And hence it is dull Hatred will discern Him in his Pilgrim's vest, the sternest of the stern. XXIV Meanwhile, by Adria's sunny sea thou rovest, Heartsick with sorrow whilst in life's best bloom, The pensiveness thou woo'st, the face thou lovest, The eye of azure, and the cheek of gloom, Her waves to please thee silently assume; And in them and in thy benevolence Which speaks a better and a brighter doom Than envy grants thee, is some happiness— For her calumnious wrong will pity love thee less? XXV O no, no, no! nor vainly hast thou sung Thy hidden griefs, the blighting thoughts which tear The heart they torture—Minstrel! many a tongue Repeats thy echoes to the charmed air, And eyes there are have mourned o'er the despair Which made thy breast the home of bitterness; The great, the good, the noble, and the fair, Albeit their blessing could not make it less, Have bent them from their bliss to pity and to bless. XXVI We see, but cannot heal the stanchless wound, We share its gushing sorrow, still it bleeds; Man plucks from out the garden's ruinous ground The baleful nightshade, though it shed its seeds With lavish bounty, but the bitter weeds Of rooted sorrow mock his arm—ah why, When the stung heart on its own sickness feeds, Can we not wring from out compassion's eye One potent silver drop to hush its agony? XXVII And is there then no talisman to quell The thousand dark soliloquies entwined With the soul's sufferance, and from out its cell Expel the spirit which enthralls the mind, Which from the void of years long left behind With Ariel voice evokes from their abode The pulseless phantoms of delight? to bind Those airy shapes, O can no pitying God Wave the subduing charm of his Lethean rod? XXVIII Yes! though the mind by Memory's scathing share Ploughed—waxes flowerless, black, and withering, Like fields o'er which the desart's burning air, Simoom or Samiel, passes with hot wing, Fountains there are which for a season fling Freshness around, and with their gentle dews Charm wearied nature to a second spring— Hope, and the sweet voice of the prompting Muse, Both stirring still to joy, nor thou their gifts refuse! XXIX 'Tis true the one but seems to draw its dyes From the orbed rainbow in the dark storm bending, Beautiful Visitant! to mortal eyes Our gloom with the first light of Eden blending; Beautiful, but how brief! too soon descending In gentle tears that seem to weep our woe; But still the colours are of Mercy's lending, And presage of her future fiat—Go To your own home, ye Clouds, thou swelling Deep reflow! XXX And who from out the dim abysmal sky Would pluck the lovely Crescent of the night, Because she has not all the majesty And arrowy brightness of the God of Light, Nor cull the blossom ere decay or blight Feed on and spoil its damask beauty? so Shall we not seize the sybil of delight Because she has a fairy's fleetness? No— Pluck the fair flowers of Hope whilst yet her roses blow. XXXI Or, if her fleeting visions be too weak To silence thoughts that ill with pleasure suit, Again the Muses' hallowed region seek, And touch the string of that Elysian lute Whose sound might charm the Furies—as the foot Of Orpheus trod the downward path, and they With all their thousand hissing asps grew mute In listening to his song—griefs dark as they The Eolian talisman of Music will obey. XXXII There is another and a purer fount, There is a sweeter and a happier meed Than e'er was gathered on the Muse's mount, A plant for sorrow and for pain decreed, Comfort the fruit—Religion is the seed. She calls us with mild voice, which to repel Must cause the wounds of sorrow still to bleed; Obeyed—the waters of delight will swell From an unfailing spring. ‘Sweets to the sweet, farewell.’ XXXIII Ye that are weary of the world, come here And drink a Lethe to your cares—its stream Flows through these alleys silent, deep, and clear, Making the toil of human passions seem A restless vigil or a shifting dream. It is not in the stirring haunts of men That peace resides, the ever-pleasing theme Of our desire—her nest is in the ken Of some religious wood, or dim romantic glen. XXXIV 'Twas in a grove retiring far away Of blackening pines, and on a hill like this, Silent and sweet, I've heard Alonzo say, He felt the first thrill of enamoured bliss, That lured him to the fatal precipice From which he fell as in the flowers he played. 'Tis a sad tale, and suiteth not amiss With the deep umbrage of this placid shade, Wherein his feet so oft have languishingly strayed. XXXV A youth—he rarely mingled with the rest, His chosen friend was solitude, among Vallies, and woods, and waters, he was blest; To him, earth, heaven, and ocean found a tongue, And told their mysteries—to them he clung Like a vine's tendril, till his spirit grew Shy, silent, and reflective, and so hung On what was wild, and wonderful, and new, Till it seemed coloured all with their enchanting hue. XXXVI With this severe reservedness of mien Was mixt a fervid and a gentle mood, Which ever seemed to shun, yet charmed if seen, By him the mossy rock, the wave, the wood, Were peopled with affections, them he wooed In every season; in the summer wind, And snows of winter, it was joy to brood On nature's volume, where the Almighty Mind Pictures his awful face, magnificently kind. XXXVII 'Twas Summer; scarce upon the aspin tall The small leaf trembled—in the noon's repose He sought from far a hospitable Hall, Which dimly peeping, from the woodlands rose; Not uncompanioned—arm in arm with those Who most had met his warmth with warmth sincere; Hid from his sight a neighbouring river flows, Hung with fresh bowers, which murmuring cool and clear Down many a rich cascade, stole sweetly on his ear. XXXVIII The Genius of the Place poured all his pride At his advance upon the hanging grove. Sparkled in light the ever-flashing tide, A sound beneath—a silentness above; Of brightest blue that day the skies were wove, Its hue was magical—the Hall he found In whose high porch now first he saw his Love, Pouring sweet medicine in a brother's wound, Which as the more he wept, more tenderly she bound; XXXIX And from the busy fingers wiped the blood, And soothed his sorrow for a father's sake; Her form, her pity secretly subdued His gazing eye—he knew not what could make A stranger look so dear, and prisoner take His soul in sighings he could not explain; Kind was their greeting, and his heart could ache With hers to see the suffering and the pain, One moment linked it there in a familiar chain. XL And in the garden sitting by her side, When all was blissful, solitary, sweet, He found the voice he ne'er before had tried, And taught the warbling echoes to repeat The name of Ion. In that dear retreat, Musing or smiling she was ever by, Or if she strayed to some romantic seat Unknown, a shout was in the crystal sky, “Ion?” the hollow cliffs and mossy walks reply. XLI Whatever flowers she cropped him were preserved In his best volume with a miser's care, Whatever were the praises she deserved, He deemed she was the fairest of the fair; Perfect each word, look, motion, gesture, air— And I have heard him say, her native tone Was a pathetic simpleness so rare, It fell like music o'er deep billows blown, That such another voice was—O no, never known! XLII And in their long, long walk at summer-eve Beside the temple, in the accustomed wood, Whose was the leaf which opened would relieve Alonzo's fearful and desponding mood?— To her he read, with bosom too subdued By what it felt, sweet-stirring at the core, What Campbell's happy hand, benignly good, Drew of the tenderness which Gertrude bore, Ajut's departing sail, or weeping Ellenore. XLIII And ever from his lid a tear would slide Which he could not repress, he knew not why, And Campbell, Ion, valley, temple, tide, Swum in a Paradise of beauty by. And on the air would fall the unbidden sigh, Till Ion trembled, and no more the page, Bent at the passage wet by either eye, The excess of praise or pity could engage, Too dear the glancing war which their dark pupils wage. XLIV Are they on earth or in the court of heaven? A thought to be imagined, not expressed! But with their rapture a decay is given, Or bliss would so annihilate the blest. Love is the Aloe of an age at best, Its leaf may for a century be green— That for which Youth is ever on the quest, Its present flower—tomorrow but has been, So must it fare with those who linger in that scene. XLV It came at last, the melancholy hour Dreaded so long, and it was death to part; O had he never known the passion's power, Than feel the struggles of a bursting heart! He passed away and never told his smart, One kiss he stole, and thrice returned to tell By nought but sighs, a gaze, a pause, a start, A gushing tear, the mastery of the spell— Scarce spoke his wild white lips articulate farewell. XLVI The world hushed not his agony of thought, The peopled city was to him a wild Whose vital barrenness before him brought The face—the idol from its shrine exiled. Yet were there things which oft his grief beguiled, The moss-rose given when it began to blow, The tale o'er which she wept, or sighed, or smiled, Her folded leaf, her profile—these could throw Sunshine on his despair, deliciousness on woe. XLVII I see him join the gay—his brow is knit, I know his thoughts, to Ion they belong; There is no charm can overpower his fit, But pity, and the harmonies of song. Once hid the laurels and the pines among, In his love's youth I heard him touch a strain Liquid with tenderness, to which his tongue Trembled, as though prophetic of his pain, As I his form recal, his spirit sings again. To Ion. 1 The waves we traced, the walks we trod, I cannot help but build in air, When Ion seeks their lonely sod, Say, does she wish Alonzo there? Upon my fancy graved I bear The flowery wood, the mossy hill, And that forsaken Temple, where We sat, and sighed, and looked our fill, And e'en the sunshine and the shade Which robed the paths wherein we strayed. 2 How darkly have the journeying years O'er me their stormy shadows cast, Since in a war of hopes and fears, Sweet Ion, from thy bower I passed! It soothed the tears which rose so fast And gushingly when thou wert by, In thy dear eyes to see them glassed Like rain-drops in a sunny sky. I would not that one drop of pain Thy tranquil spirit then should stain. 3 But now so changed in love or ruth, I guess not how, I know not why, These weeping eyes 'twould more than soothe, To know that Ion's are not dry. The woods are wild with harmony, I hear it, but I am not glad, I ask if in as blest a sky, The heart of Ion is as sad; To think such things I know unmeet From one so fond, of one so sweet. 4 But oft the fondest thing assumes A moodiness from others' glee, These waves will frown, when fall the blooms Upon them of the lilach tree— They waft a sound of joy to me I would not feel, I would not hear, Ion! alone I'd gaze on thee, And wrestle for a bursting tear, One sunny tear, to prove at last Thy constancy through all the past. 5 But if thy maiden truth I wrong, Here as I kneel where I have knelt In prayer for thee so oft and long, Look on this heart and thine will melt. In desolation it hath dwelt, And mourned o'er its uncertain lot; O if the half of what it felt Be thine, I am not all forgot. This bosom could not then repine, Convinced it held one pulse of thine. XLVIII Years passed with years; unchanged his spirit was, A virgin volume filled with Ion's name, In whose pure sound he read as in a glass, A kindred feeling, an unbroken claim, Perfect as when without a farther aim He listened to her tones—and now the blast Of winter blew, spring fled, and summer came, And with a beating heart and footsteps fast, Filled with a thousand thoughts he trod that Hall at last. XLIX She was still beautiful, and gazed on him With a bewildered eye of kind regard, And prayed the youth to ease his wearied limb— What toil would not that winning voice reward? Nor were the woods, the rushing waves debarred To their soon-seeking sight—his love he told, A feeling pity in her eyes was starred, She could not listen with a bosom cold, But—an usurping root had flourished o'er the old. L He heard—he felt, wept, chided, pardoned, passed A hurried hand across his burning brow, And in unutterable wildness cast The dark thought back—perhaps it was not so, Her love might yet awaken to his woe, A wronging Angel he could never hate;— I know not—for her tears refused to flow; He still against all hope would hope await, Again he passed away, again he sought her gate. LI The reckless stream flowed as it flowed before, The lychnis budded, and the forest bowed With blossoms all unsparing as of yore— He asked of Ion, but the wave was loud, And the rock would not answer—'twas too proud To bear the question—Ion was a bride! He knew it not. A voice amidst a crowd In pity to his ignorance replied— Enough! a broken heart what hand can heal or hide? LII He could not—to the place of many graves, Rushed like a driven deer the unconscious man, To pour forth groans of which the innocent waves Prattled, as smooth and tranquilly they ran. He wished his life were fettered to the span Which they, the buried held—it might not be; The winds were charged with gentleness to fan The fever of his agony, as he Bent to the Power above his supplicating knee. LIII Thence Mercy, radiant as an angel flew, And shook a flower of comfort in his bowl, Torn from the amaranth; in the bowl it blew, And shed a sovereign balsam o'er his soul. Beside her mother's turf, it could console Him of past hopes forsaken, even there To wish, that as the varying seasons roll, No portion of his pangs might Ion share, He turned and passed away—'twas more than he could bear! LIV Peace to thy banished, but enduring breast, Alonzo! as the woodbine round the tree Twines sweetly, may the Star which rules thy rest Diffuse its choicest influences on thee; Sorrow the path, in heaven thy bridal be, A glory faintly shadowed forth on earth, Hallowed with seraph songs and jubilee; Peace to thy troubled spirit, in the dearth Of thy once promising hopes, and dear domestic hearth! LV Advancing to the steep wood's southern side, A glimpse comes on me of the glittering Town, Far off o'er trees and level lawns descried, In midst a Tower with ivies overgrown Starts from a mass of shadow. Taste has strown Her verdant web o'er chancel and o'er aisle; On buttress, turret, Gothic mullion, stone, Creeps the dark weed in beauty, to beguile With its religious shade the horror of the pile. LVI Thence widely winding down a sylvan dell, Fenced from the touch of each ungentle wind, I reach methinks Love's Delphic oracle, For many a long-forgotten name is shrined In sculpture on a beech's glossy rind, And whispered vows, and words of tender sound Are heard they say to float, when suns are kind, From viewless forms, now near, above, around, Blessing their steps whose feet its solitude have found. LVII The air is delicate, and pure the place, The tall tree's foliage casts a pensive shade, Its boughs depend with inexpressive grace, The last to wither, and the first arrayed When April dances in each opening glade; And far and wide is seen Adonis' flower Stained from his ancient wound, and born to fade, Which Venus mourning many a summer-hour, Here drives her turtle car from Acidalian bower. LVIII Steep is the acclivity which now my foot, Ambitious of its scene, aspires to scale; A hawk flies round it, and the Wood grows mute, Conscious that evil pinions load the gale. But look! what loveliness is in the vale, Solemnly beautiful! that golden light Eve's curtain is. Plato, I bid thee hail, Did not thy spirit move before my sight? Haunt'st thou not now these groves, thine own uprooted quite? LIX Where are thy olives and thy laurels now, Frequented Porch and holy Academe? Owls haunt the ruin, axes lop the bough, Fallen is the column, shrunk Ilissus' stream! And is it so? is Science too a dream Baseless as they, the echo of a sound? The sage's precept, rhetorician's theme, Fall they with tower and temple to the ground, Periods which charmed and lit assenting nations round? LX Twined with the ivy of despoiling years, The fane of Pallas to the dust may sink; But She is co-eternal with the spheres, And Wisdom is the soul's ethereal link Which binds it to its God. With thee to think, Pure Plato! though in error, is a fit More glorious than from other founts to drink The stream of truth. If falsely Tully writ, “Errare meherculè malo cum Platone, quám cum istis vera sentire!” Cicero. It is a bright deceit which she may well remit. LXI I did not err, for Science can evoke E'en from their urn the ashes of the wise, The thoughts they cherished, and the words they spoke, The key of life within her volume lies; And thus that sea of bowers before my eyes, Where blooms the unfading bay, the cypress weeps, Is populous with earth's divinities; They well may be where thought such silence keeps, And from the gloom she loves the bird of Wisdom peeps. LXII Within the shade a ruined temple stands To sight conspicuous, navelled in the pines, Speaking of Grecian art, since Vandal hands Defaced her structures, and despoiled her shrines. As here, the weed of ruin darkly twines Her marble walls now verdant with decay, As here, on roofless floors her sunbeam shines; As here the fox, the jackall howls for prey There, where Minerva shone, and Pericles bore sway. LXIII Too clear a type of thy degraded state! And there are lovely things which haunt thee still, Land of immortal relics! in thy fate, Though fallen Colonna strews Tritonia's hill, Forms such as those which rapt Apelles' skill Made breathing in thy high and happy hour, Thy olive shores with classic beauty fill, But chained beneath the Vandal Slavery's power, We love and start away—the wasp is in thy flower! LXIV But round the princely coast of Albion, she Who starting from thy ashes, keeps thy fire Of Vesta in her temples of the free, The wise to win, the coldest to inspire With the mild pulse of elegant desire, With more than Grecian beauty, Woman roves; Her wit Aspasia, Sappho gives her lyre, Penelope her cestus, veil, and doves, And Helen the dear smile which dimpled Hebe loves. LXV And as the brilliant halcyons seek the shades, And fluttering upon azure wings, appear Loveliest above secluded waters, maids At the calm sunset walk in beauty here; Wise but not grave, correct but not austere, The harmonists of life, who scatter round, Benignant as the Pleiads in their sphere, Mirth in their smiles, and music in the sound Of tones which sweeter fall than dews on starlight ground. LXVI Saw you those eyes which sparkled as they passed, Bright with excessive feeling? they belong To warm Euanthe, in whose soul are glassed The love of nature, and the love of song. The mirthful form which gayly shot along With her whose look was an ingenuous grace, Fluttering with sweet confusion, was the young Ianthe with Verduta; next in place Is one whom from your mind no season can erase. LXVII Her eloquence of figure seems to start Pure from the Grecian chisel, and to claim A kindred with those statues which impart Awe to the eye, and rapture to the frame. Warm from her cheek the Promethéan flame Of what from heaven was stolen might be caught, And dignify the Rhodian artist's aim; The blended charms which he all vainly sought Throughout the shores of Greece, in Isaline are wrought; LXVIII And graces which they had not—the gazelle Springs not in glorious liberty more free To the far palms which shade some Syrian well, Or almond-bowers in happy Araby. Thoughtful beside the bright laburnum-tree, Her hours devoted to some glowing page, Combines the fanciful Euphrosyne, Youth's flowers of freshness with the fruits of Age, Then Phryne golden-tress'd, and Sophonisba sage. LXIX But than the quivered Dian far more shy, With modest beauty, in her sable veil, Sulmalla in the loneliest walk will fly The breath of praise. Listening the nightingale Too late, has made Medora's face so pale, So like the jasmine, innocent and sweet; The mild-eyed Arethusa seeks the vale, And gay Janeira and Janessa's feet Have too their share of joy in this beloved retreat. LXX Nor pass unsung the fair Genevra by, Whose hand, disporting with the silent strings, Draws sounds which make us watchful, and the eye Melt, as when Israfil the angel sings, And to some holy Imaum's vision brings The beauty-peopled bowers of Aden near: Hark! for his flute the shut of blossoms rings, From the far vallies creeping in the ear,— Vallies, in whose cool depth the first blue mists appear. LXXI It is the dying hour of day which grows Sweeter in setting—all is shadow round, But where afar the tall trees part in rows, The West burns like a ruby, and the ground Is tinctured with its brightness to the bound Of the soon-purpling East. I will away And gaze once more upon the ancient mound, Where with stern hands embrued in civil fray, Roundhead and Cavalier usurped alternate sway. LXXII The point is won: how balmily the breeze Breathes from the sky-aspiring larch! this hill And all its vales of tributary trees Are gathered in one scene, which asks the skill Of Poussin's beauty-breathing hand to fill The fancy of a stranger; but to wreak Such love upon the task as to instil The immortal tints of nature's changing cheek, Art must exhaust her stores, and leave the rainbow weak. LXXIII We move—the expressive Picture will assume A more endearing aspect, we recur To Tempe and to Vall'ombrose—a gloom As holy falls from the umbrageous Fir Which shades these vallies, and the vallies stir With as white flocks; nought else is seen to leave Its fixt repose—the statued clouds scarce err Over the marbled skies, which to them give Hues which dispute in love, and discords which relieve. LXXIV Such pastoral quiet marks this evening scene; But where conspicuous o'er yon Eastern vale Hill undulates on hill, the roar has been Of Battle, ('tis Tradition tells the tale,) The neigh of snorting steeds, the trumpet's wail, Whilst civil banners flouted the blue sky, Stained with devices proud, which seldom fail To fan the fire of feud and anarchy,— “The Commons and the Cause”—their watchword and reply. LXXV Answered with taunts the gallant Cavalier, The battle joined—where then was your renown, Frenetic zealots! when in mid career The kingly squadrons hewed your pennon down? Then might you hear “The Crosier and the Crown” Pass o'er both armies, in a shout which took The air in thunders to the distant town, League after league, and into vapour shook Craulee! the startled waves of thy pellucid brook! LXXVI 'Tis done! the strife is over on the plains, The years revolve. Yon subterraneous tower Holds now within its heart, but not in chains, The daring Regicide who mocks the power Of swords that seek him, Argus-eyes that lower To trace his haunt, and what is now his doom? To shroud, year after year—hour after hour, His helmed head within a living tomb; How brooks that rebel Chief his cell's sepulchral gloom? LXXVII E'en as the Lion-leader of the Gaul, Took in the toils of nations, to become A vassal to the tyranny of all, Once trembling at the thunders of his drum; E'en as he bears in rocks his martyrdom, With a despair which would annihilate The past, and the eternity to come Of his dark doom, but with an eye elate, Steeled with the pride of scorn, the apathy of hate. LXXVIII How oft, stern Tower, did thy enclosing vault Echo the whispers of his powerless rage, And the vain wish that a more hot assault Might loose his soldier-spirit from its cage, On an arena—on a wider stage, To wreak his fury, not on walls but men! Gold conquers all—and gold has won his page To snare the hunted Lion in his den;— There lies the slayer slain—what boots it how or when? LXXIX The moral is the same—a truth enshrined In this wild tale for subject and for king; The ruler and the ruled are entwined In blest concordance by a golden string. Whose keen sword cuts the Gordian knot, doth bring Wrath on himself, and ruin on his race, Ambition's suicide—he dies, a thing For scoffing Time to point at with his mace, Avouch it, Thou who fell at Pompey's marble base! LXXX Man did not draw his birth from heaven to be In turn the tyrant and the tyrannised, His Maker formed him like the eagle free, To spurn at slavery, howsoe'er disguised By cowl or crown; but freedom realized, Is to be guarded with an eye more keen Than of the fabled Dragon, erst surprised By Hercules. England, inviolate queen! Guard well thy golden fruit—thy spoiler works within. LXXXI Beside that Tower of ages past I rove At summer-eve, when dews and twilight fall; It is a foolish fancy, but I love To gather from the mosses of its wall A flower—and ask the winds if this be all The poor, poor blossoms of a warrior's fame? 'Tis fragile! the next blast which round the Hall Resounds—will scatter it to whence it came; Was it for such ye fought? O greatly-glorious aim! LXXXII These peaceful times behold the peasant pass Unconscious o'er your ashes, see his plough Glide where bones whiten, and where carnage was; O'er embrazure and ruined rampart now The adjacent garden waves its wilding bough, And bees hum round the untended mignionette; And thither, ere the spring's first roses blow, Do young lambs bound, and village-girls are met, To cull from nettles rank the snow-white violet. LXXXIII But not like those, unwept and unbeloved, Whitbread! to Lethe shall thy spirit pass, Whose Attic lips majestic senates moved, Thou in whose bosom Freedom sought to glass Her beauty, all she is, and ever was, The nurse of glory, and the scourge of wrong, A kindling Ray breathed in the Statue's mass— The electric fire of life: as Pallas sprung Armed from the Thunderer's head, immaculate and young,— LXXXIV And grasped the writhen lightnings in her hand, The heart of guilty princes to appal, But with her olive making green the land Where Truth and Mercy flourished free from thrall: So, when his moral thunders shook the wall Of Senates, Wisdom from his councils burst— Illumining the grove, the camp, the hall, And breathing freedom when none other durst Impugn the guilty great, whom pride in purple nursed. LXXXV There has been One on whom the snaky breath Of Hate would breathe pollution, but who stood Unsullied as Alasnam's glass beneath What sought to taint it, innocently good, The applause of millions!—when the venomous flood Hissed in its bubbling caldron to o'erboil, His was the awful Ægis which subdued The Dragon which her garments would despoil, And stiffened it to stone, though heaping coil on coil. LXXXVI How, when your hand unfurled the historian's scroll, How have ye pictured Cato, he who fell, Wept by a world? whose thunders sought to roll If aught like Cæsar shot athwart the cell Where jealous thought sate like a centinel On his high watch-tower, and whose trumpet blew In every danger an alarming knell, Till hushed by agony? in what bright hue, Phocion, the good, the great, adoringly ye drew? LXXXVII Say, was it not with a majestic brow, Lit by the blaze of His electric eye, Whose fascination won, we knew not how, The key-note of the soul's ascendency, Whose music was the appeal of Liberty, The Greek's philippic in the Roman's tone; Say, was it not with his despairing sigh, And arm whose pulse was eloquence alone, Which throbbed at Genoa's wrongs and Saxony o'erthrown? LXXXVIII Silenced for ever! but his glorious name Hath aye become a watchword, to combine All hearts that fly for freedom or for fame To freedom's ark—the threshold of a shrine, Hallowed by many an oracle divine. The Ship may wrestle with the enemy, Whilst whirlwinds battle with its groaning pine, It strikes not—ne'er shall strike, whilst such as He Nails with determined hand her colours to the tree! LXXXIX The westering Sun has reached his distant goal, He looks an idol robed in scarlet weed, And heaven, from the horizon to the pole, Is massed in fire, as recent from the speed Of snorting Ethon and each other steed Which whirled to Hades his descending car; I must away, in Nature's book to read One other page, ere evening shadows mar Her glittering leaves—though blessed by planet and by star. XC I stand where I was standing in the morn, And all has changed around me—time has come, And passing, scattered fruitage from his horn, The bashful maid has found a bridal home, The anchored vessel launched in ocean foam, Oceans themselves have flowed since morn began, And bright orbs ebbed in the aerial dome, Moving the pendulum of heaven; to Man Figuring what glorious hours to joy or ruin ran. XCI So dies the Good as nature now assumes The mask of night, to dwell a little while Amid the shadow of funereal tombs, Until the bright To-morrow! such the smile Which radiates round his soul to reconcile The shrinking body to its dark sojourn, A beam which Mercy deigns us to beguile The eyes which weep o'er lost Affection's urn, Sphered in some happier star, for ever so to burn. XCII This leaf recals to earth my wandering thought— Beneath the setting sun's illuming shower, Its lines are into life and language wrought, As Memnon's harp, beneath his rising power, Woke into sound. On Temple and on Tower Hangs in a glory the last flake of light, For now the clock tolls forth the curfew-hour, The rippling lake flows rosily, and bright The windowed Abbey shines, part melting into night. XCIII Looks not that Structure, in the hues of eve, A palace of enchantment? a recess Shaped for a prince, where Birth and Beauty weave The net of conquest of a golden tresse— A dance perchance—or song, at lute or chess? Of such, Arabian minstrelsy has sung Erst in the halls of Bagdad, these no less Might furnish dreams, lovelier than Fiction's tongue Hath over Tigris' waves magnificently flung. XCIV Of pictured heroes might description speak, The pride of Albion, glorious in their strife; Of freedom's banner, weeping beauty's cheek, The martyred husband, and the sainted wife; Statues whose look is loveliness and life, On which Canova has his spirit poured Creative—for of each these Halls are rife; But weary falls my finger on the chord, And the first stars are met, and Twilight walks abroad. XCV With twilight wakes the nun Mnemosyne, Parent of pensive pleasure! at whose wand The vanished are compelled again to be, And wear a robe whose Painting is beyond The touch of Rubens. Questioned they respond, Albeit but shadows from Trophonian cave; With them the loved, the absent, and the fond Commune, and thus defraud the silent grave, Long as the Goddess will her ivory sceptre wave. XCVI Most amiable in sadness is her mien, Her magic cell a mild sequestered grot, Hung round with shells and mosses evergreen— Of shells the fount, of shells the walls are wrought. Thither, 'tis said, her nymphs one summer brought, And to her arms consigned a truant boy, Wandering beside the cell; she smiled, for Thought Sate on his brow, and melancholy Joy, In sooth she loved the child so beautifully coy; XCVII And gave him Fancy for a nursing mother, The Sister of her Vigils! with his guide He ever wandered, he would seek no other, She was his consolation, he her pride. And in the Grotto sitting by her side, Of all their fairy wonders he would ask, The waving sceptre and the pictured tide, Of her own magic dress and painted mask, And of the Elysian Maid, and her mysterious task. XCVIII The lore she taught him, and the tales she told Sunk on his heart—it was a bliss to stand Near where the fountain's bubbling waters rolled, And see the wild, the wonderful, and grand, Called into being by the nun's command; And sometimes as the floor he darkling trod, The smiling Goddess trusted to his hand, His little and—the waving of her rod, Then waxed he pleased indeed, and deemed himself a God. XCIX It chanced, while watching by the noontide lymph, When the mild nun had sought the bower of sleep, Came running to his side a babbling nymph On airy toe, who nothing does but peep At what the renovating Sisters keep Guarded, locked, covered, caverned, veiled, and hid, All heedless if it make her smile or weep; 'Twas she who erst the sweet Pandora chid, Till she her hest obeyed, and oped the fatal lid. C He was yet bending thoughtful o'er the fountain, Which nothing did but sparkle, play, and curl, And in the mirror of his mind was counting Each brilliant drop which fell like orient pearl, Kissed by the sunbeams—when that prying girl, Young Curiosìta rushing to the well, Her blue and busy eyes fixt on the whirl Of waters, bade him seize a chorded shell At the fount's base, on which a mimic rainbow fell. CI Seizing, he drew from forth the conch a sound, Clear as the silver of the warbling wave, Were nought but heavenly numbers heard around, To fill the coral vault, the shelly cave; The stir of his ambitious fingers gave A voice to echo—at the grateful song The wondering Infant now looked glad, now grave, New thoughts broke on him in a glorious throng, As stole the pensive strains melodiously along. CII Mnemosyne awoke, nor knew what hand Could make so sweet her slumber; 'twas too sad For viny-crowned Thalia, for the grand Melpomene too innocently glad. Urania sometimes played so, but she had As 'twere a starry music of her own, Yet her belov'd Euterpe could not add A more sonorous and engaging tone— She rose to see by whom her daughter's flute was blown. CIII But who may paint her transport and surprise? She started—'twas the infant Rogers drew The tears which rushed to her rejoicing eyes, In strains to pathos and to pity new. To the dear sound all birds of beauty flew, And hovered round, and fanned him with their wing; There sunny halcyons spread their pinions blue, The tender wren, the turtles of the spring, And to her new-blown rose the bulbul ceased to sing. CIV In her maternal arms she clasped the youth, And on his forehead printed many a kiss, And called up all her shadowy shapes to soothe His pensive mind with images of bliss. Him too the Muses with their melodies Inspired, instructed, softened, and entranced; “Framing loose numbers,” in Parnassian skies His boyhood fled—but as his years advanced, A more pervading power within his pupil glanced. CV And in his foster-mother Memory's praise, He woke a grateful, a Virgilian strain, Which told the secret of his boyish days, Making grief beautiful, and teaching pain To smile, and talk of happy hours again. Anon to Human Life his string was given, He drew it pure in precept, free from stain, A Sail which glides from infancy to Heaven, By many a willing wind down glassy waters driven. CVI Nor deem his triumphs foreign to my song— Not now through shade is seen the Abbot's Tree, But chasing there the moral hours along, The poet wove his recent minstrelsy, Near to the waves which, from my infancy, I called the Lake of Rogers! for the beech Shades with such loveliness its placid sea In autumn noons, I could not chuse but teach Loud to the golden Woods his sweetnesses of speech. CVII But whilst Mnemosyne awakes, and loves To picture forth the absent, where art Thou, N??????, of late my partner of the groves? Thou treads't not Syria's holy mountains now, Nor seest in Greece unfading myrtles blow, As in sweet seasons past—but it is thine, Whilst round me Night descends, and waves the bough, To mark through breaking clouds the morning shine, Sweeping with orient keel the many-coloured brine. CVIII From the wild depth of woods, from silent hills, And vallies by the maiden moon made pale, Shrined in the solitude which most instils The tenderness of thought, I bid thee hail: Health to my friend! where'er thy Indian sail, By cliff or cape, in haven or in bay, Waves to the influence of the tropic gale, The blessing of that Spirit on thee lay, Whose voice the absent forms of past delight obey! CIX The stars are gathered thick in Heaven—I pass Beyond their limits on Devotion's wings, Albeit as in a multiplying glass, In them we read unutterable things. Thou Wood! where now the bird of Evening sings, To thee shall I devote my silenced shell, With no ungrateful breast: to Rapture's springs, And to the threshold of Urania's cell, Thou hast thy Votary brought—all hail, and fare thee well!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. To ??????. The Greeks, when o'er a buried friend They raised the monumental stone, Reared high one pillar which might lend Memorial of his virtues gone; And round the sculptured column high, They twined the sweetest summer-flowers, Gladdening the conscious passer-by, With beauty breathing in all hours. There flourished they in dark and bright, Or if, oppressed by tempests rude, The thunder-storm their leaves might blight, The morrow saw those blooms renewed. So in thy absence, dearest maid! Bright monument of thee I build, And thus my soul, in sun and shade, Is with enchanting memories filled. For round thy Image fair and kind, A thousand flowers of thought I cast, Which breathe across the waste of mind The smile of social summers past; In joy and grief, suspense and pain, When prouder things like recreants flee, In lonely fondness they remain, Not vainly—since they speak of thee. Tis true, the tempest might descend, And tear those flowers of life away, But though their blighted branch it rend, The trophy could not all decay: The memory of thy form and worth, That mightier column should not die; Unlike those pillars of the earth, Which fall when earthquakes pass them by. Through all the thunders of the soul, Wrath—hate—wrong—jealousy—and pride, 'Twould stand, unheeding as they roll, And proudly bid them be defied. But shouldst Thou change—I dare not take One thought on what thou hadst been then, The pile which ages could not shake, No human hands could rear again! But o'er the mournful ruins yet I'd bid the weeping ivies twine, For though estranged, I could not set Oblivion's seal on aught of thine: Twined in the immortal cells of thought, Her wizard ivy Grief must be, He only who had seen thee not, Could wear no aching heart for thee. To ??????. No! not the tress round the mild eye curling Of Beauty falls in a sweeter fold, Though dark it droops like a banner furling, Or floats like the sun in a sea of gold; And not the smile on lips descending, Bright with mirth, seems so divine, As when, dearest maid, dear Music's lending Her soul to beautiful lips like thine. Tresses fall faded, smiles are fleeting, Blue eyes oft shoot us an icy glance, But O! what spirit can still the beating Of pulses that tremble, and hearts that dance! The kindest gift—the sweetest token, Tress or smile I would resign, Once more but to hear one dear word spoken By those so beautiful lips of thine! Propertius; Book III. Elegy X. To Leuce. I was wondering, my Leuce, when morn was begun, What visions the Muses around me might spread, As seen by the first bursting blush of the sun, They had left their Parnassus, and stood round my bed; There stood they in silence, but shortly I knew That they brought me the sign of thy natal day, For thrice o'er the sweet lyre their white fingers flew, And in joy and in music they vanished away. And I know by this sign that the skies far and wide Shall be cloudless, the day undiscoloured shall pass, That the winds shall be silent, the waves cease to chide, Smooth-flowing as Music, and brilliant as glass. In a day so auspicious, an hour so bright, Away with the sight and the sound of distress! On this day even Niobe's heart shall be light, And though marble, her sighs and her sorrows suppress. The bills of the halcyons no storms shall bespeak, But their blue, calming wings flutter over the main, The mother of Itys shall utter no shriek, Nor remember past days, and past vigils of pain. And thou, O my love! on youth's sunniest wings, In thy loveliness rise—the Celestials address, Haste! drive away sleep in the clear gush of springs, And compose the fine flow of each elegant tress. Then the vest which was worn in that whitest of hours, When thy beauty first ravished my eyes thou must wear, The garden, thou seest, is not vacant of flowers, Then wreathe the white rose in thy delicate hair; Every grace which can heighten thy beauty design, For renewed with the roses such beauty should be— I would not one charm or one minute resign Of the ages I owe to love, beauty, and thee. And when we have done with the censer and myrrh, And the flames of the altar have shone round the room, Mirth shall sit at our banquet, and Wisdom with her, And the night hurry down amid wines and perfume. When the wild flutes their power of pleasing resign, We will fly to the strings of the cittern again, And let not, dear Leuce, those sweet lips of thine Be tinctured with censure or cruelty then. From the sounds of our mirth dulcet slumber shall fly, Altar and dome shall resound them together, We will gaily decide, dear! by casting the die, Upon which tyrant Love lays his heaviest feather. And when flowing glasses have passed without number, And Vesper has trimmed up his lamp for the night, We will bury our yearly observance in slumber— And thus shall thy festal pass by with delight. To a Lady Netting. Lady! cease the web thou'rt weaving, Added spells we well can spare, Eyes alone, our hearts bereaving, Sure must prove sufficient snare; Dim will be the web thou weavest, Yet—O, yet— Pause! a deeper charm thou givest, Eyes should be thy brightest net. Lady! be the thread thou twinest, Firm as diamond, thin as air, Tangling tresses are divinest Our affections to ensnare, Twined around thy brow by zephyr; Yet—O, yet— Pause thee in thy young endeavour! Tresses be thy firmest net. Lady! weave thy web no longer, Lest we burst so frail a chain, But if thou would'st choose a stronger, Give us thy sweet voice again; Those Orphean tones enchain me, Yet—O, yet— From thy purposed work refrain thee, Song should be thy sweetest net. Lady! though our hearts oppose thee In the spell thy fingers wind, But one smile from lips so rosy, Our opposing would unbind, Like a ray o'er winter's river; Yet—O, yet— Drop this arrow from thy quiver, Smiles should be thy loveliest net. Beaming eyes and twining tresses, Sunny smile and kindling song, All the spells that can oppress us, Lady! to thyself belong, And already may we rue them; Then—O, then— Cease thy meshes, or undo them; Beauty be our only chain! Parting. Autumn noons were throwing Lights serene and glowing On mountain, lake, and tree, And a soft melancholy, Making the day more holy, Brooded o'er earth and sea, When first I flew to greet thee, Empassioned Zobëide! And O, so soft and sweetly Came thy mild voice to me, It woke to new vibration, This sad heart's long stagnation, Which trembled all to thee. Sickness her best bloom shrouded, Her young cheek sadness clouded, And dear that cloud to me, Yet would a sudden hectic, Light her wild eye electric, When wizard Poesy In gold her numbers weaving, Rejoicing, soothing, grieving, Thrilled the fair breast, whose heaving Gleamed like white waves at sea; Till I could deem its splendour So passing bright and tender, Was lit alone for me. Autumn winds were rending The berries redly bending Of one lone sumach tree, When the quick tears half-starting To my dim lids at parting, She gave her hand to me; 'Twas like that earlier token With which my heart was broken, Few were the accents spoken, Enough that I could see She shrunk away in sorrow, From thoughts that on the morrow, Our hands apart would be. The year's last rose hung wreathing Around, faint odours breathing From its decaying tree; Unhoping I bereaved it, Unsmiling she received it, Stole one swift glance at me, Then in her book disposed it With lingering hand, and closed it, Where sacredly reposed it, Pledge of past joys to be; As though that eye had uttered, To soothe the heart which fluttered, “Yes! I'll remember thee.” To ??????. Hast thou not seen, when summer-eve is fading from the sky, The sullen cloud which tells of storms and darkness that are nigh? As spreads that cloud o'er heaven's blue face eclipsing earth and sea, Such and so heavy is the pang which parts the soul from thee. I will not say how heaved my heart when first thy eyes met mine, Though coldly did they gaze on me, there was rapture in their shrine, Bright as the smile which left thy lips when we two saw no more The varying aspect, kind or chill, which each to other wore. There is, despite ourselves, a Power, when youthful spirits meet Gives bounding motion to the pulse, and makes their presence sweet; Gives words to eyes, and light to smiles, which well they understand, Music to voice, and bliss to each light pressure of the hand. And though such two may meet no more permissioned and alone, The sparkling ray, the inward thrill which knit their minds in one, Still beams warm with remembered joy, as sunshine falls on shades, Or the last crimson flush of day which widens as it fades. And Memory viewing in her cell an image kind and fair, The friendly fugitive arrests, and stamps it freshly there; Stamps it all glorious as it is, and glowing with delight, A living beauty to the soul—an Eden to the sight. So dwells remembrance on thy worth, though thou thyself art fled, And though a sterner bar than parts the living and the dead Should rise to bar thee from my sight, in pleasure and in pain, It lives—my pride or punishment, my blessing or my bane. And potent is the talisman which cancels from the mind That deep impression of regret which beauty leaves behind, And powerful must that sigil be, which where her seal is set, Can bring a charm to eyes that weep, and hearts that tremble yet. But fare thee well! the hour is fled—and I may think no more On past delights with which my cup of joy was running o'er; Enough! that once thy rosy smiles, thy figure I have seen, Enough! that where thy presence is, my truant steps have been. Blest be thy lot in loneliness, or in the peopled scene, Where heart meets heart in festal show, all smiling and serene; Blest be thy lot!—may angel-shapes lead on thy circling hours, And every pathway lead thee through a paradise of flowers! I would not that one cloud should dim, one sorrow should impair A spirit so serene as thine, a form so passing fair; No! tearless be thine eyes for aye, or sparkle but to cast Joy like the rainbow through the storm which tells of trials past. Farewell! but O thy mien—thy voice in Fancy's ear will come Like music o'er the waves at night, or gale where roses bloom, A summer-breath, divinely sweet, and exquisitely soft, In breathless pleasure heard but once, but O! remembered oft! Farewell! when other hours are past—when other years have rolled, If chance again that form I see, that beauty I behold, 'Twill be with far intenser bliss than it was pain to part, 'Twill be—but what I cannot tell; O, read it in my heart! The Vase of Lilies. There's a feeling of deep and of lonely regret Will pervade the young heart in the sweetest of hours, If the canker of dark disappointment should fret, Or but sully the lightest and least of its flowers; But e'en at the moment when pleasure falls from us, And hope's rich dews are swept from the chaplet of spring, If we see in her scene but a tendril of promise, We cling to the shoot, and for ever could cling. I came in the silence and odour of noon, To the vale of enchantment when childhood was new; On the tall tree the woodbine still hung its festoon, But the sunbeam had been there, and robb'd it of dew. I came to the bower of the gentle Verduta, To claim but a glance from the eyes of the fair— But a gloom and a loneliness mock'd the intruder, I came—but no gentle Verduta was there. Alone, in the delicate whiteness of youth, A Vase of sweet Lilies stood flourishing nigh, And I stole from the vase the two fairest, to soothe My regret o'er the pleasures for ever gone by. Thy lilies, Verduta, already are faded, Ah! severed from thine could they otherwise be! But their bells shall be yet in Love's rosary braided, And in hours of desertedness whisper of thee. Stanzas. When Time, who sets his scornful hand On all that love and glory rear, Has laid his desolating wand On hopes which made our being dear; We feel that grief, through all the heart Passing as with a bolt of thunder, With tears has sapped the infirmer part, And rent with fire the proud asunder: All our pride is then to weep, And wish for death's oblivious sleep. Lorn as an antelope that roves, His loved one from his sight exiled, We pace our now deserted groves, With step more mad, and eye more wild; And not one spot we loved so much Throughout the past can charm us now,— We only feel the blasting touch, The hand of ruin on our brow; All our pride is then despair, And it is agony to bear. But if upon that desart spot, Another withered heart we meet, In our desertedness of lot, The very sound of grief is sweet; For then the accordant spirits know In every tear, by every token, There is a balm exists below For peace destroyed, and bosoms broken: A little music breaks our woe— But solemn still the strain, and low. When breathed the sympathizing sigh, When pity's silent tear is shed, A fitful sunshine seeks the eye, The weeds of pain are withered; We strew the nightshade on the wind, Look for a flower not quite so sad, And if a livelier one we find, We praise it, and are inly glad: And smile—but do not dare to own Our mourning hearts are lighter grown. Hast thou the spirit-soothing tear— The settled calm from Sorrow felt? Welcomed that ray from Mercy's sphere, To chillness long unused to melt? If Grief thy bosom thus has wrung, If thus thy soul the charm has known, Which in thy sky a rainbow hung, And bound thy waist with Comfort's zone— I for thee, and thou for me, Will deem it still a bliss to be.— The Last but One. As we walked with Zobëide, on the eve of the morrow which was to see her departure by the same path, she said—“I have many times trod this path, but this is the Last time—but One!” When the hues of delight make brighter Our hours, with a feeling pure, And the heaviest heart grows lighter, Misdeeming it long to endure; If Grief on our steps advances To sully the rays that shone, How heavy the vain eye glances To welcome the Last—but One! In Love—when the breast e'en borrows From rapture a shade of grief, Most like to a child, whose sorrows Will quarrel with their relief; Though each kiss in its farewell stingeth, And wisdom it were to shun The anguish to which the lip clingeth, How it lives on the Last—but One! In Grief—when remembrance lingers O'er all that she held most dear, And chides the unwelcome fingers Would brush from her lids one tear; When drugged are the dregs of her chalice, And her fountain hath ceased to run, With what self-tormenting malice, Will she drink the Last drop—but One! In Hope—when the warm heart beateth At the first light touch of love, And our vision the wizard cheateth With a bliss that seems from above; Though the nightshade of dark denial Our flourishing dreams o'errun, How madly we look to her dial, To seize the Last minute—but One! In Suspense—when the smile that fluttered On Joy's vain cheek is set, And each accent the Fair One uttered Sounds winningly wooing yet; How like to a Mermaid singing To a listening heart undone, Is fear with that sweet thought bringing Her Last chilling frown—but One! In Distress—when the wild waves whiten Around the tost ship they lash, When the black clouds momently lighten, And fast is the signal-flash; To an ear at a distance from danger, How mournfully peals the gun! How a bosom that bleeds for the stranger Thrills o'er the Last shriek—but One! When Pleasure—her light form muffles From the least rude wind that blows, Though 'tis only that Zephyr ruffles A billow—or bends a rose; As she crushes in cups the sweetness Of grapes that hang black in the sun, How she feeds on the praise of discreetness, In leaving the Last—but One! In Autumn—ere frosts quite wither The flower that loves the hill, When the thistle's beard, hither and thither, Flies on at its own gay will; When sunbeams are brightest, though fewest, How far from our path we run, To crop but a harebell, the bluest— Because 'tis the Last—but One! In the magical pages of Byron, With what passionate voice we hang On the griefs which his being environ, And feel with him pang for pang; When with Manfred we wander, or Harold, And think the long tale but begun, Just ceasing the verse to be carolled, How we sigh o'er the Last—but One! But when Hesper began to glisten, Presaging the eve's decline, And we might no longer listen To the magic of tones like thine; And when thou, Zobëide, wert vanished We asked ‘of the many that shone, ‘Is there not one joy unbanished?’ And an Echo replied—“Not One!” Lines on Howard. Originally published in the “Life of Howard,” by J. B. Brown, Esq. of the Inner Temple. Why, when the souls we loved are fled, Plant we their turf with flowers, Their blossomed fragrance there to shed In sunshine and in showers? Why bid, when these have passed away, The laurel flourish o'er their clay, In winter's blighting hours, To spread a leaf, for ever green,— Ray of the life that once hath been. It is that we would thence create Bright memory of the past; And give their imaged form a date Eternally to last. It is, to hallow—whilst regret Is busy with their actions yet— The sweetnesses they cast; To sanctify upon the earth The glory of departed worth. Such, and so fair, in Day's decline The hues which Nature gives; Yet—yet—though suns have ceased to shine, Her fair creation lives: With loved remembrances to fill The mind, and tender grief instil, Dim radiance still survives; And lovelier seems that lingering light, When blended with the shades of night. Else, why when rifled stands the Tower, The column overthrown, And, record of Man's pride or power, Crumbles the storying stone; Why does she give her Ivy-Vine Their ruins livingly to twine, If not to grant alone, In the soliloquies of man, To glory's shade an ampler span! Still o'er thy temples and thy shrines, Loved Greece! her spirit throws Visions where'er the ivy twines, Of beauty in repose: Though all thy Oracles be dumb, Not voiceless shall those piles become, Whilst there one wild-flower blows To claim a fond—regretful sigh For triumphs passed, and times gone by. Still, Egypt, tower thy sepulchres Which hearse the thousand bones Of those who grasped, in vanished years, Thy diadems and thrones! Still frowns, by shattering years unrent, The Mosque, Mohammed's monument! And still Pelides owns, By monarchs crowned, by shepherds trod, His Cenotaph—a grassy sod! They were the Mighty of the world,— The demigods of earth; Their breath the flag of blood unfurled, And gave the battle birth; They lived to trample on mankind, And in their ravage leave behind The impress of their worth: And wizard rhyme, and hoary song, Hallowed their deeds and hymned their wrong. But Thou, mild Benefactor—thou, To whom on earth were given The sympathy for others' woe, The charities of heaven;— Pity for grief, a fever-balm Life's ills and agonies to calm;— To tell that thou hast striven, Thou hast thy records which surpass Or storying stone, or sculptured brass! They live not in the sepulchre In which thy dust is hid, Though there were kindlier hands to rear Thy simple Pyramid, Than Egypt's mightiest could command— A duteous tribe, a peasant band Who mourned the rites they did— Mourned that the cold turf should confine A spirit kind and pure as thine. They are existent in the clime Thy pilgrim-steps have trod, Where Justice tracks the feet of Crime, And seals his doom with blood; The tower where criminals complain, And fettered captives mourn in vain, The pestilent Abode Are thy memorials in the skies, The portals of thy Paradise. Thine was an empire o'er distress, Thy triumphs of the mind! To burst the bonds of wretchedness, The friend of human kind! Thy name, through every future age, By bard, philanthropist, and sage, In glory shall be shrined; Whilst other Nields and Clarksons show That still thy mantle rests below. I know not if there be a sense More sweet, than to impart Health to the haunts of pestilence, Balm to the sufferer's smart, And freedom to Captivity! The pitying tear, the sorrowing sigh Might grace an angel's heart; And e'en when Sickness damped thy brow, Such bliss was thine, and such wert Thou! Serene, unhurt, in wasted lands, Amid the general doom, Long stood'st thou as the traveller stands, Where breathes the lone Simoom; One minute, beautiful as brief, Flowers bloom, trees wave the verdant leaf, Another—all is gloom; He looks—the green, the blossomed bough Is blasted into ashes now! But deadlier than the Simoom burns The fire of Pestilence, His shadow into darkness turns The passing of events; Where points his finger,—lowers the storm; Where his eye fixes,—feeds the worm On people and on prince; Where treads his step,—there Glory lies;— Where breathes his breath,—there Beauty dies! And to the beautiful and young Thy latest cares were given; How spake thy kind and pitying tongue The messages of heaven! Soothing her grief who, fair and frail, Waned paler yet, and yet more pale, Like lily-flowers at even: Smit by the livid Plague, which cast O'er thee his shadow as he passed. As danger deeper grew and dark, Her hopes could Conscience bring; And Faith, and Mind's immortal spark Grew hourly brightening; One pang at parting—'twas the last— Joy for the future!—for the past— But thou art on the wing To track the source from whence it came, And mingle with thy parent flame! The nodding hearse, the sable plume, Those attributes of pride, The artificial grief or gloom Are pageants which but hide Hearts, from the weight of anguish free: But there were many wept for thee Who wept for none beside; And felt, thus left alone below, The full desertedness of woe. And many mourned that thou should'st lie Where Dnieper rolls and raves, Glad from barbaric realms to fly And blend with Pontic waves; A desart bleak—a barren shore, Where Mercy never trod before— A land whose sons were slaves; Crouching, and fettered to the soil By feudal chains and thankless toil. But oft methinks in future years To raise exalted thought, And soften sternest eyes to tears, Shall be thy glorious lot; And oft the rugged Muscovite,— As spring prepares the pious rite,— Shall tread the holy spot, And see her offered roses showered Upon the grave of gentle Howard! Those roses on their languid stalk Will fade ere fades the day, Winter may wither in his walk The myrtle and the bay, Which, mingled with the laurel's stem, Her hands may plant, but not with them Shall memory pass away, Or pity cease the heart to swell— To Thee there can be no Farewell!</field>
