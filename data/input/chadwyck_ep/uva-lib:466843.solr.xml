      <field name="fulltext">EPIGRAMS. If some excuse be needed from the author for venturing to publish the original trifles contained in this volume, much more incumbent is it upon him to apologise for the many âold jokesâ which are inserted in the collection. Whether, like old pictures, by being varnished, they are improved by being versified, it is not for him to decide: he hopes, at all events, that the process may tend to assist in their preservation. [I tell it in the very words of Martial] I tell it in the very words of Martial, Some good, some bad, and some indifferent: They who make puns are to their own puns partial; May they who read them be alike content. A DULL SPEAKER. By men of wisdom we are told That speech is silver, silence gold; Tom, since your speech is only lead, Keep silence, and give gold instead. PATRONAGE. An author one day to his Patron presented A work of much labour and time: âI had been,â said his Lordship, âmuch better contented If your book had been written in rhyme.â When turn'd into verse he produc'd it once more. Said my Lord, âYou have mended the matter; Neither reason nor rhyme was there in it before, Now at least there is in it the latter.â THE CHANCE OF WAR. To battle rode the Cavalier, His Groom-boy following in the rear The Cavalier, by pikeman thrust, In battle slaughtered, bit the dust; The Groom-boy, by no foeman smit, Escaping, liv'd to dust the bit. THE BISHOP AND HIS BIOGRAPHER. 1862. âOn the shelf,â says the Bishop, âI will not be laid, Nor in sheets be stitch'd up for the good of the trade; As yet a live subject, I will not be cut up, Unpublish'd your book, Mr. Shutte, you may shut up.â CURE FOR THE GOUT. The doctor said, âIf gout to balk, You physic still refuse, Upon an empty stomach walk;â Said Sydney, âUpon whose?â LOST AND FOUND. Tom, his pet mastiff, a monster in size, (Lost since last week), with much sorrow bewails; While passing a pork shop conceive his surprise To see all the sausages wagging their tails! TIT FOR TAT. Quoth Sam to his friend as they travell'd along, âI a story will tell if you'll sing me a song.â Without voice, without ear, his companion begun; Said Sam, when the vocal performance was done, âNow, indeed, if I must tell a story, encore, I should like you to sing me that ditty once more.â RAILWAY DIALOGUE. The Asylum for Lunatics! pray lift your veil, And see, ma'am, how well it looks view'd from the rail;â âSir,â she replied, âhave the kindness to tell, Does the railway seen from it look equally well?â ANOTHER. In the train a Lord Chancellor, taking his seat, Thus address'd an old friend whom he happen'd to meet: âYou, Serjeant, are double the man you once were, You are grown quite a porpoise of late, I declare.â âMuch pleasure, my lord, as a porpoise, I feel To find myself seated so near the Great Seal.â ODE TO SUSAN ON RECEIVING FROM HER A PAIR OF WORSTED SLIPPERS. Lovely Susan, tell me why Downwards still I cast mine eye? Every morn and every night Think on thee with fresh delight? Can it be, insidious foe, Love that takes me thus in toe? Yes, within thy slipper set, Wily Cupid spread his net. Why had I so little wit As to put my foot in it? Love, on purple wine afloat, Glided down Anacreon's throat; Often through the ear he flies, Enters often through the eyes, But to cut off all retreat Me he seizes by the feet. True the adage is, it seems, Love is ever in extremes. Now the warmth has reach'd my sole, How can I escape heart-whole? Had I such a gift mistrusted, I had never thus been worsted. THE SILVER SPOON. âWhile the company were waltzing, a silver spoon, with the crest of the owner of the mansion, was seen to jump out of the pocket of a reforming M. P. who, being unable to account for the circumstance, was requested to retire as soon as possible.â Extract from an old Dublin Paper. To join in the dance came an M. P. of late, By special invitation, A friend of reform and a stanch advocate For property's equalisation. The guests had all supped, and while whirling about, What think you was seen to fall, Sir, From the innermost fold of his pocket, jerk'd out By this legislative Waltzer? Was it a plan to remove from its place Some mountainous elevation, That commerce, steam-driven, might gallop apace, Till upset by speculation? Was it a project the Church to pull down, Or bill for the Lords' dissolution? Forging from coronet, mitre, and crown, A railway for revolution. Or scheme for amending the poor man's estate By making him discontented? No, better than all, 'twas a piece of plate By himself to himself presented. Why should owners disfigure their spoons with a crest, In an age so enlighten'd and radical? In its wisdom why has not our Senate supprest Such emblems aristocratical? Since there are lucky men who are born now and then With a silver spoon stuck in their throat, Sir; A man born without is entitled, no doubt, To carry one off in his coat, Sir. THE BOY SPRING AT EMS. You have heard of a mountain in labour, no doubt, And how with loud groans crept a little mouse out; Here man is brought forth from a fountain so small, Brought forth too without any labour at all. Prometheus his cunning was proud to display When he squeez'd the first man out of water and clay; Let the Nymph who presides o'er this fountain reveal How man is a mixture of water and steel. Though unnumber'd the men that old Ocean destroys, This fountain replaces them daily with boys, Where live babes are found in the water as good As those which Cock Robin found dead in the wood. O, who, save at Ems ever witness'd before, A fountain that bubbled up boys by the score: All water hath bubbles, but go where you please, You will find in no water such bubbles as these. Unless as a fact you that Fairy tale quote, âWater Babies,â which Kingsley for land babies wrote; Where, pictur'd by Paton, they flounder about, The playful companions of salmon and trout. Streams lov'd by the Muses were sacred of old; The waves of Pactolus are yellow with gold; Fair Nymphs were transform'd into fountains of yore, But we ne'er heard till now that boy-babies they bore. TO A YOUNG LADY WHO SAID THAT EVERY MAN OUGHT TO POSSESS A WEATHER ALMANACK. Fair maid! it is not Dietrichsen, 'Tis not the sheet that Hannay writes in, 'Tis neither Zadkiel nor Moore, Who can a cloudless life ensure; Man reads his fate in woman's eyes, And not in Murphy's prophecies. If with a scold he chance to tether, Then every day 'tis squally weather, Then house and home are rent asunder By lightning glance and voice of thunder. If on a wife his heart be bent O'erflowing still with sentiment; The end of all her hopes, her fears, Her cares, her joysâa flood of tears, Whate'er astrologers may say, His life is one long rainy day. Or if, on dissipation bent, The wife with home be discontent, Then Brussels lace and diamond locket Soon down to Zero bring his pocket. But all is calm and all is bright, Should he know how to choose aright; One, like yourself, without pretence, Blessed with good humour and good sense. No chilling blasts his peace destroy; He breathes an atmosphere of joy; Unvex'd with storms of household strife, Eternal sunshine gilds his life. THE DINNER DIFFICULTY, BY A DINER OUT. How shall I learn in London to divine The hour intended when engaged to dine? Heedless of that for which my friends invite, How shall I learn to calculate it right? Since by the clock this hour I cannot hit, Fain would I know the movement of the spit. Cold soup! still let me that Charybdis shun, Nor yet on Scylla over-punctual run; Ne'er shake the knocker ere the footman's drest, The house astounded, and myself distrest; Shown to a room whose solitude appals, My name reechoed by the empty walls! Worse fate! at table let me not arrive When all have shunn'd âthe greatest bore alive,â Who greets my entrance with delighted air, And points beside him to the vacant chair; Hid from the smile of the belov'd one's face, Some hated rival in the envied place; No âflow of soul,â to animate the scene, Still worse, no turtle left in the tureen! DILIGENCE DRIVING IN SWITZERLAND. His glaz'd hat around With a silver lace bound, His jacket turn'd up with vermilion, Who, in driving a dilly O'er hills bleak and chilly, Can rival a Switzer postilion? From the wind and the storm By a goatskin kept warm, The folds of his grey capote under, At each lightning flash He flings out his long lash, And he cracks it at each crack of thunder. A stout team of five By his whip kept alive, Three in front, and two wheelers behind them, Their heads are unrein'd, While their tails unrestrain'd, They whisk without cruppers to bind them. The storm and the rain May attempt it in vain, His meerschaum no chance of their snuffing out; And the clouds that sweep by 'Twixt the mountain and sky, Are a joke to the clouds he is puffing out. Let four-in-hand Billy Bowl down Piccadilly, His horses well up to the bit, Sir! But, when through rain and snow Over mountains I go, I would rather be coach'd by a Switzer! AN UNINTENTIONAL SUMMONS. AprÃ¨s dÃ®ner, thought Jack, having finished their work, All alone and unseen, My false teeth I may clean; So he pull'd the whole set from his mouth with a jerk. A tumbler he fill'd, and he wash'd them right well, And he jingled them round And around, till a sound Rung forth from the tumbler as loud as a bell. The waiter rushed in. âQu'est-ce que monsieur demande? Ah, je vois bien, C'est de l'or que Ã§a tient, Monsieur vash de big nugget from gold-digger land.â Jack in silent dismay from the table withdrew, His sleeve underneath He held all his teeth, So he thought it was better to hold his tongue too. SONNET BY A SAXON. O Blarney! Blarney, wonderworking gift! Why sat I never on the Blarney stone? To plodding Saxon, canny Scott unknown, What pen can paint, what skill its meaning sift? Paddy's safe shield in every adverse shift, His mirth is Blarney, Blarney is his moan; Priest, Peer, and Peasant, all its influence own, In Love persuasive, Physic, Law, and Thrift. Sure as he's born a Celt, the little Rogue With mother's milk he sucks his Blarney in, As natural to him as his native brogue. Though, were I born in Connaught or Killarney, On this my theme I might an epic spin, How end my Sonnet?âEcho answersâBlarney! WANTED: A TRAVELLING COMPANION. âAn Englishman desires,â the Zeitung said, âA travelling companion.â This request, Repeated still at Presburgh as at Pest, Go where he would a tourist daily read; He reach'd Vienna,âere he sought his bed Again those words were on his sight imprest; âHere, waiter! take me to your English guest; Business so urgent must be quickly sped.â Uprose the Briton. âSir, be seated, pray; When shall we start? My trunk, you see, is pack'd; How very charming! Sir, I'm quite delighted.â Replied the tourist: âSir, I came to say, Though very deeply I regret the fact, I cannot travel with you, as invited.â TO A YOUNG LADY WHO WORE DIRTY SLEEVES. From Voiture. You, Cloe, carry, I believe, A hundred lovers in your sleeve; Then lodge them there in decent plight, And let that sleeve at least be white. You, Cloe, with good reason may O'er them exert a victor's sway, Your captive slaves in prison pen, But why in such a sooty den? For you my heart so long has burn'd, By Love 'tis to a cinder turn'd; No convict waiting for the rack Was ever chain'd in cell so black. By day, by night, consuming still, Do I with smoke the prison fill? Is it the fire that burns me through, Which makes that sleeve a chimney flue? TRIP TO TOLEDO. Intending the night at Toledo to pass, We handed our bag to the laquais de place: For the laquais de place we a ticket had ta'en, But the laquais de place found no âplaceâ in the train. For himself we car'd little when laquais went home; But, alack! he took with him sponge, brushes, and comb; So away to Toledo without e'er a rag; And while they bagg'd our lackey we lack-ed our bag. FERDINAND AND PHILIPPINA. AN AUGSBURG BALLAD. Once upon a time did dwell, Sir, As the Augsburg legends tell, Sir, In that town a demoiselle, Sir, Philippina Welser. In her father's palace old, Sir, Merchandise and wealth untold, Sir; But more worth than all his gold, Sir, Philippina Welser. Ships had he on many a sea, Sir, Lands in many a far countrie, Sir; But more worth than all was she, Sir, Philippina Welser. Then to Augsburg there came down, Sir, Men of station and renown, Sir, For the Diet in that town, Sir, Where resided Welser. And from the Tyrolian land, Sir, Where he held supreme command, Sir, With them came young Ferdinand, Sir, Whole of heart and well, Sir. But his heart became unquiet, And he heeded not the Diet, From the hour he cast his eye at Philippina Welser. You may still her portrait view, Sir; Hair of darkest auburn hue, Sir, In her hat a W, Sir, Philippina Welser. Eyes that will your heart subdue, Sir, Eyebrows arch'd that o'er them grew, Sir, And their silken lashes too, Sir, Philippina Welser. Ferdinand! the youth I ween, Sir, Twenty summers had not seen, Sir, When he first met Philippine, Sir, Philippina Welser. He with that sweet gentle dove, Sir, Over head and ears in love, Sir, On his helmet hung her glove, Sir, Philippina Welser. Him old Welser would compel, Sir, Wine to drink unmix'd with seltzer; So he drank her health right well, Sir, Philippina Welser. Nor was she dispos'd to shun, Sir, Ferdinand the Emperor's son, Sir; So, to give consent, he won, Sir, Philippina Welser. But his father, Ferdinando, He must make him understand, O, How she'd caught him heart and hand, O, Philippina Welser.
