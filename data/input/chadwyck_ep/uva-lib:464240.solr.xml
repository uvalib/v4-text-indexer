Variations for different voices have been ignored. Repetition marks have been ignored Since singing is so good a thing, I wish all men would learne to sing. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Sir Christopher Hatton knight, Lord Chancellor of England, William Byrd wisheth long life, and the same to be most healthie and happie. [The Psalmes] [I.] O God giue care &amp; do apply Psal. 55. O God giue eare &amp; do apply O God giue eare &amp; do apply, to heare me wh? I pray: &amp; wh? to thee I call &amp; cry, hide not thy self, hide not thy selfe away. Take heed to me gra?t my request, &amp; a?swere me againe: With plaints I prayful sore opprest, great grief doth me constraine, Because my foes with threats &amp; cries, oppresse me through despite: and so the wicked sort likewise, to vexe me haue delight, haue delight. For they in co?sel do c?spire, to charge me with some ill. So in their hasty wrath &amp; yre, they do pursue me still, they do pursue me still, they do pursue me still. For they in &amp;c. [II.] Mine eies with feruencie Psalm. 123. Mine eyes with feruencie of sprite, I do lift vp on hie: To thee ô lord that dwell'st in light, which no man may come nie. Behold euen as the seruants eies, vpon their master waite: And as the maide her mistrist hand, with carefull eye and strayte Attends: So we ô Lord our God, thy throne with hope and griefe Behold, vntill thou mercie send, and giue vs some relife. O Lord though we deserue it not, yet mercie let vs finde: A people that despised are, throwne downe in soule and minde, The mightie proud men of the world, that seekes vs to oppresse: Haue fild our soules with all contempts, and left vs in distresse. FINIS. [III.] My soule opprest with care Psalm. 119. My soule opprest with care and griefe, doth cleaue vnto the dust: O quicken me after thy woord, for therein doe I trust. My waies vnto thee haue I shew'd, thou aunswerest me againe: Teach me thy law and so I shall, be eased of my paine. The way of thy commaund'ments Lord, make me to vnderstand: And I will muse vppon the power, and wonders of thy hand. My heart doth melt and pyne away, for very payne and griefe: O, raise me vp, after thy word, and send mee some reliefe, All falshood, and false waies O Lord, doe thou from me remoue: And graunt me grace, to know thy law, and onely that to loue. The way of truth I choose to tread, to keepe my life in awe: And set before me as a marke, thy sacred woord and law. I cleaue, O Lord, vnto all things, witnessed by thy speech: Whereof that I repent me not, I humbly thee beseech. When that my heart thou shalt enlarge, to seeke and runne the waies: Of thy precepts, I will not fayle, the length of all my dayes. FINIS. [IIII.] How shall a young man prone 2. Pars. Psalm. 119. How shall a young man prone to ill, clense his vnbridled heart? If that thy law, ô Lord he doe, all frailtie set apart. Embrace with setled minde, and learne thy word with care to keepe: And search to finde with humble sprite, thy iudgements that are deepe. With my whole heart, I haue thee sought, and searched out thy way: O suffer not that from thy word I swarue or goe astraie. Thy word ô Lord, within my heart, least I should thee offend: I haue laide vp as treasure great, for that shall mee defend. The Lord is blest, he shall me teach, the iudgements of his mouth, Thereby to rule and dresse the waies, of mine vntamed youth. Thy lawes therefore, in open place, my lippes shall euer sound: And neuer fayle to shew foorth that, to which thou hast me bound. For in the way of thy precepts, I set my whole delight: No wealth, no treasure of the world, so precious in my sight. What thou commaund'st I will thinke on, with diligent respect: And to thy lawes haue due regard, for they shall me protect, In thy precepts, ô Lord, my soule her whole delight hath set: Thy words therefore more pure then gold, I neuer will forget. FINIS. [V.] O Lord how long wilt thou PSALME. 13. O Lord, how long wilt thou forget, to send mee some relife? For euer wilt thou hide thy face, and so increase my griefe? How long shall I with vexed heart, seeke counsell in my spirit? How long shall my malicious foes, triumph and me despit? O Lord my God, heare my complaint, vttered with wofull breath: Lighten mine eyes, defend my life, that I sleepe not in death. Least that mine enemie say I haue, against him loe preuayl'd: At my downe fall they will reioyce, that thus haue me assayl'd. But in thy mercie Lord I trust, for that shall mee defend: My heart doth ioye, to see the help, which thou to mee wilt send. Vnto the Lord therefore I sing, and doe lift vp my voyce: And for his goodnesse shew'd to mee, I will alwaie reioyce. FINIS. [VI.] O Lord who in thy sacred tent Psalme. 15. O Lord who in thy sacred tent, and holy hill shall dwell: Euen he that both in heart &amp; minde, doth studie to do well. In life vpright, in dealing iust, and he that from his heart The truth doth speake with singlenes, all falshood set apart. With tongue besides that hurts no man, by false and ill report: Not friend nor neighbour harme will doe, where euer he resort. That hates the bad, and loues the good, and faith that neuer breakes: But keepes alwaies though to his losse, the word that once he speakes. Nor filthie gaine by loue that seekes, nor wealth so to possesse: Nor that for bribes, the guiltles soule, doth labour to oppresse. Like as a mount so shall he stand, nothing shall him remoue: That thus shall do, the Lord hath said, no man can it disproue. FINIS. [VII.] Help Lord for wasted are &amp;c. Psalm. 12. Help Lord for wasted are those men, which right'usnesse embrace: And rarely found that faithfull are, but all the truth deface. Each to his neighbour falshood speakes, and them seekes to beguile: With flattering lips and double heart, when smothest he doth smile. All flattering lips, the Lord our God, in iustice will confound: And all proud tongues, that vaunt great things, he will bring to the ground. Our tongues say they, shall lift vs vp, by them we shall preuaile: Who should vs let, or stoppe our course, that thereof we should fayle. For the destruction of the iust, and such as be opprest: And for the mournings of the poore, that likewise be distrest. I will rise vp now saith the Lord, and ease their griefe and care: Of those which he full craftely, hath draw'n into his snare. Like siluer fine that tried is, seuen times by heate of fire: So are thy woords Lord pure and cleane, to such as them desire. Thou Lord wilt keep, and wilt defend, all such as in thee trust, And from that cursed race of men, saue all such as be iust. When euill men exalted bee, the wicked gad about: Farre from all feare of paine, but thou ô Lord wilt roote them out. FINIS. [VIII.] Blessed is he that feares &amp;c. PSALME. 112. Blessed is he that feares the Lord, he walketh in his waies: And sets his great delight therein, the length of all his dayes. His seed and those which of him come, mightie on earth shall be: The race of such as faithfull are, men blessed shall them see. Plentiousnes within his house, and want there shalbe neuer: His righteous and vpright dealing, endure shall for euer. In mistie cloudes of troubles darke, which doe the iust oppresse, The Lord in mercie sends them light, and easeth their distresse. The righteous man is mercifull, and lendeth where is need, He guids with iudgement all his things, be it in word or deed. Though stormes doe fall and tempests rise, the righteous shall stand fast: A good remembrance of the iust, for euer that shall last. None euill tidings shall him feare, his heart is fully set, He trusteth and beleeues the Lord, that will him not forget. A stablisht heart within his brest, no feare where so he goes, The Lord in iustice will reuenge, the malice of his foes. A hand that doth reliue the poore, for which he may be sure, A good report will follow him, that alwaies shall endure. This shall the wicked see and fret, and wast away with ire, Perish shall and consume to naught, all that he doth desire. FINIS. IX. Lord in thy wrath Psalm. 6 Lord in thy wrath reproue me not Lord in thy wrath reproue me not, in thy wrath reproue me not though I deserue thine yre: Ne yet correct me in thy rage, ô Lord I thee desire. For I am weak, therfore (ô Lord) of mercy me forbeare: And heale me Lord, for why? thou know'st, my bons do quake for fear, for feare. X. Even from the depth Psalm. 6 Even fr? the depth, vnto thee Lord Even fr? the depth, vnto thee Lord, vnto thee Lord, with heart &amp; voice I cry, I cry: Giue eare ô God vnto my playnt, vnto my plaint, &amp; help my miserie, my miserie. [The Sonets and Pastoralles] XI. I Ioy not in no earthly blisse 1 I ioy not in no earthly blisse, I force not Cressus welth a straw: For care I know not what it is, I feare not Fortunes fatall law. My mind is such as may not moue: for beautie bright nor force of loue 2 I wish but what I haue at will, I wander not to seeke for more: I like the plaine I clime no hill, in greatest stormes I sitte on shore: and laugh at them that toyle in vaine, to get what must be lost againe. 3 I kisse not where I wish to kill, I faine not loue where most I hate: I breake no sleepe to winne my will, I wayte not at the mighties gate: I scorne no poore, nor feare no ritch, I feele no want nor haue to much. 4 The Court and cart I like nor loath, extreames are counted worst of all: the golden meane betweene them both, doth surest sit and feare no fall: this is my choyse, for why I finde, no wealth is like the quiet minde. FINIS. XII. Though Amarillis 1 Though Amarillis daunce in greene, like Fayrie Queene, &amp; sing full cleere, Corina can with smiling cheere: yet since their eyes make heart so sore, hey ho, chil loue no more, chil loue no more, 2 My sheepe are lost for want of foode. and I so wood: that all the day, I sit and watch a heardmaid gaye: who laughes to see me sigh so sore, hey ho, chil loue no more. 3 Her louing lookes, her beautie bright, is such delight: that all in vaine, I loue to like, and lose my gaine: for her that thankes me not therefore, hey ho chil loue no more. 4 Ah wanton eyes my friendlie foes, and cause of woes: your sweete desire, breeds flames of Ise &amp; freese in fire: ye skorne to see me weepe so sore, hey ho chil loue no more. 5 Loue ye who list I force him not, sith God it wot, the more I wayle, the lesse my sighs and teares preuaile: what shall I doe but say therefore, hey ho chil loue no more. FINIS. XIII. Who likes to love 1 Who lykes to loue let him take heed, and wot you why: Among the Gods it is decreed, that Loue shal die, &amp; euerie wight that takes his part, shal forfaite each, a mourning heart, 2 The cause is this as I haue heard, a sort of dames, whose beautie he did not regard, nor secret flames. complaind before the gods aboue, that golde corrupts the God of loue. 3 The gods did storme to heare this newes and there they swore, that sith he did such dames abuse, he should no more be god of Loue, but that he should both die, and forfait all his gold. 4 His bowe &amp; shaftes they tooke away, before their eies, and gaue these dames a longer day, for to deuise, who should them keepe, &amp; they be bound, that loue for gold should not be found. 5 These Ladies striuing long, at last, they did agree, to giue them to a mayden chast, whome I did see: who with the same did perce my brest, her beauties rare and so I rest. FINIS. XIIII. My minde to me &amp;c. 1 My minde to me a kingdome is, such perfect ioy therin I find: That it excells all other blisse, which God or Nature hath assign'd: though much I want, that most wold haue, yet stil my mind, forbids to craue: 2 No princ'lie port nor welthie store, no force to winne a victorie: no wylie wit to salue a sore, no shape to winne a louing eye: to none of these I yeeld as thrall, for why my mind despise them all, 3 I see that plentie surfets oft. and hastie clymbers soonest fall: I see that such as are aloft, mishap doth threaten most of all: these get with toyle and keepe with feare, such cares my mind can neuer beare. 4 I presse to beare no haughtie sway, I wish no more then may suffice: I doe no more then well I may. looke what I want my mind supplice: loe thus I triumph like a king, my minde content with any thing. 5 I laugh not at anothers losse, nor grudge not at anothers gaine: no worldly waues my mind can tosse, I brooke that is an others bane: I feare no soe nor fawne on friend, I loth not life nor dread mine end. 6 My wealth is health &amp; perfect case, and conscience cleere my chiefe defence: I neuer seeke by brybes to please, nor by desart to giue offence: thus do I liue, thus will I die, would all did so as well as I. FINIS. XV. Where fancy fond 1 Where fancy f?d for pleasure pleads, &amp; reason, keeps poore hope in Iayle: ther time it is to take my beads, &amp; pray, that beautie may preuaile, or else dispaire, wil winthe field, wher reason, wher reason hope &amp; pleasure yeeld, 2 My eyes presume to iudge this case, whose iudgement reason doth disdain: but beautie with her wanton face, stands to defend, the case is plaine: and at the barre of sweet delight, she pleads that fancie must be right. 3 But shame will not haue reason yeeld, though griefe do sweare it shall be so: as though it were a perfect shield, to blush, and feare to tell my woe: where silence force will at the last, to wish for wit when hope is past. 4 So farre hath fond desire out runne, the bond which reason set out first: that where delight the fray begunne, I would now say, if that I durst: that in her stead ten thousand woes, haue sprong in field where pleasure grows 5 O that I might declare the rest, of all the tores which fancy turnes: like towrs of wind within my brest, where fire is hid that neuer burnes. then should I try one of the twaine, either to loue, or to disdaine. 6 But fine conceit dares not declare, the strange conflict of hope and feare: least reason should be left so bare, that loue durst whisper in mine eare, and tell me how my fancie shall, bring reason to be beawties thrall. 7 I must therefore with silence buyld, the Laborinth of my delight: till loue haue tri'd in open field, which of the twaine shall win the fight: I feare mee reason must giue place, If fancie fond winne beauties grace. FINIS. XVI. O you that heare this voyce 1 O you, that heare this voice, O you that see this face, say whether of the choise may haue the former place: Who dare iudge this debate, though it be voide of hate: 2 this side doth beautie take, for that doth Musicke speak, fit Orators to make,: the strongest iudgements weak. The bar to plead their right, is onely true delight, 3 Thus doth the voyce and face, these gentle lawiers wage: like louing brothers cast. for fathers heritage: that ech, while ech contends, it selfe to other lends. 4 For beautie beautifies, with heauenly hewe and grace, the heauenly harmonies, and in that faultles face, the perfect beauties be, a perfect harmonie. 5 Musicke more loftie swells, in phrases finely plac'd: Beautie as farre excels, in action aptly grac'd: a friend ech partie drawes, to countenance his cause. 6 Loue more affected seemes, to Beauties louelie light, and wonder more esteemes, of Musicke wond'rous might, but both to both so bent, as both in both are spent. 7 Musicke doth witnesse call, the eare his truth doth trie: Beautie brings to the hall, eye witnesse of the eye eche in his obiect such, as none exceptions touch, 8 The c?mon sense which might, be arbiter of this: to be forsoth vpright, to both sides parciall is: he layes on this chiefe prayse, chiefe praise on that he layes. 9 Then reason, princesse hie, which sits in throne of mind: and Musicke can in skye, with hidden beauties find, say whether thou wilt crowne, with limit lesse renowne. FINIS. XVII. If woemen could be faire 1 If weemen could be faire &amp; neuer fond, or that their beauty might continue still: I would not meruaile though they made men bond, by seruice long, by seruice long to purchase their good wil. But when I see, how fraile, how fraile, these cretures are, I laugh, I laugh that men forget th?selues so farre. 2 To marke what choise they make, &amp; how they change, How leauing best, the worst they chose out still: And how like haggards wilde, about they range, Skorning after reason to follow will. who would not shake such bussards from the fist, And let them flie [faire fooles] which way they list. 3 Yet for our sport, we fawne &amp; flatter both, To passe the time, when nothing else can please: And traine them on, to yeeld by subtill oath, The sweet content, that giues such humer ease. And then we say, when we their follies trie, To play with fooles, Oh what a foole was I. FINIS. [XVIII. Ambitious loue hath forst me to aspire] Ambitious loue hath forst me to aspire Ambitious loue hath forst me to aspire, the beauties rare which do adorne thy face: Thy modest life yet bridles my desire, whose seuere law doth promise me no grace. But what? may loue liue vnder any law. No, no his power exceedeth mans c?ceit: Of which the Gods th?selues do st?d in awe: for on his frown, a thous?d torm?ts waite. Proceed th? in this desperate enterprise, with good aduise, &amp; follow loue thy guyd, that leads thee to thy wished Paradise, to thy wished Paradise, Paradise. Thy climing thoughts, this comfort take with all, that if it be thy foule disgrace to slide, thy braue att?pt shall yet excuse thy fall, thy braue attempt shal yet excuse thy fall, shall yet excuse thy fall.

What pleasure haue great princes 1 What pleasure haue great princes, more daintie to their choice, then heardmen wild, who carelesse, in quiet life reioyce, &amp; fortunes fate not fearing, sing sweet, in Sommer morning: 2 Their dealings plaine and rightfull, are voyd of all disceit: they neuer know how spightfull it is to kneele and waite on fauorite presumptious, whose pride is vaine and sumptious. 3 All day their flocks ech tendeth, at night they take their rest, more quiet than who sendeth his ship into the East, where gold and pearle are plentie, but getting very daintie. 4 For Lawiers and their pleading the 'steeme it not a straw, they think that honest meaning is of it selfe a law, vvhere conscience iudgeth plainely, they spend no mony vainely. 5 O happie who thus liueth, not caring much for gold, with clothing which suffiseth, to keepe him from the cold, though poore and plaine his diet, yet merry it is and quiet, FINIS.

As I beheld As I beheld I saw a heardman wilde As I beheld I saw a heardman wilde, with his sheephooke a picture fine deface, which he sometime his fancie to beguild, had caru'd on barke of beech, in secret place, &amp; with despite of most afflicted mind, through deepe dispaire of heart, for loue dismaid, he puld euen from the tree, the carued rinde, &amp; weping sore these woful words he said, ah Philida, would god thy picture faire, I could as lightie blot out of my brest, then should I not thus rage, with great dispight, &amp; teare the thing sometime I liked best, but all in vaine, it booteth not god wot, what printed is in hart, on tree to blot, but all in vaine, it booteth not god wot, what printed is in hart, on tree to blot, on tree to blot.

Then had I not line now all alone thus quiuering for cold, nor vsed this complaint, nor haue thought the day to be so long. XXV. Farewell false loue 1 Farewell false loue, the oracle of lies, a mortall foe, &amp; enimie to rest: An enuious boy, from whome all cares arise, A bastard vile, a beast with rage possest. A way of error, a temple ful of treason, in all effects, contrary vnto reason: 2 A poysoned serpent couered all vvith flovvers, Mother of sighes and murtherer of repose, A sea of sorows fr? wh?ce are draw? such showers As moisture lend to euery griefe that grovves, A schole of guile, a net of deepe deceit, A guilded hooke, that holds a poysoned bayte. 3 A fortresse foyld, which reason dyd defend, A Syren song, a feauer of the minde, A maze vvherein affection finds no end, A raging cloud that runnes before the vvinde, A substance like the shadow of the Sunne, A goale of griefe for vvhich the vvisest tunne. 4 A quenchlesse fire, a nursse of trembling feare, A path that leads to perill and mishap, A true retreat of sorrovv and dispayre, An idle boy that sleepes in pleasures lap, A deepe mistrust of that vvhich certaine seemes, A hope of that vvhich reason doubtfull deemes.

Prostrate O Lord 1 Prostrate ô Lord I lie, behold, mee Lord with pittie, stop not thine eares against my crie, my sad and mourning dittie, Breath'd from an inward soule, from heart heartelie contrite, an offering sweet, a sacrifice, in thy high heauenlie sight, 2 Obserue not sinnes O Lord, for vvho may then abide it, but let thy mercie cancell them, thou hast not man deni'd it, man melting vvith remorse and thoughts, thought past repenting, O lighten Lord, O heare our songs, our sinnes full sore lamenting. 3 The vvonders of thy vvorks, aboue all reason reacheth, and yet thy mercie aboue all this, vs thy Spirit teacheth. then let no sinner fall, in depth of foule dispaire, since neuer soule so foule there vvas, but mercie made it faire. FINIS. XXVIII. Allas a Sea 1 Alas a sea, the world no other is, our selues are shippes stil tossed to &amp; fro, &amp; loe, each man, his loue to y? or this, is like a storm, that driues the ship to go, that thus our life in doubt of shipwrack sl?ds: our wills the rocks, our want of skyll the sands, 2 Our passions be the Pirates still that spoyle, and ouerboard cast's out our reasons fraight: the Marriners that day and night doe toyle, be our conceits that doe on pleasure vvaight: pleasure Master doth tirannize the ship, and giueth vertue secretly the nip. 3 The Compasse is a minde to compas all, both pleasure, profit, place and fame for naught: the vvinds that blovv, men ouer vveening call, the Merchandise is vvit full deerely bought: triall the Anker, cast vpon experience, for labor, lyfe, and all a doe the recompence. FINIS. XXIX. Svsanna faire 1 Svsanna faire sometime assaulted was, by two olde men, desiring their delight: whose false intent, they thought to bring to passe, if not by tender loue, by force and might: to whome she said, if I your sute deny, you will me falsely accuse, and make mee die: 2 And if I graunt to that vvhich you request, my chastitie shall then defloured bee, vvhich is so deere to mee that I detest my lyfe, if it berefted bee from mee: And rather vvould I dye of mine accord, ten thousand times, then once offend the Lord.

Lulla la lulla, lulla lullaby, my sweet &amp;c. 3 Lo, lo, my little Babe, be still, lament no more, From fury shalt thou step aside, help haue wee still in store: Wee heauenly warning haue, some other soyle to seeke, From death must flie the Lord of lyfe, as Lamb both myld and meeke: Thus must my Babe obey the king that would him kill, Oh wo, and wofull heauy day, when wretches haue their will. Lulla la lulla, lulla lullaby, my sweet &amp;c. 4 But thou shalt liue and raigne, as Sibilles haue foresaide, As all the Prophets Prophesie, whose mother yet a maide, And perfect virgin pure, with hir brests shall vpbreed, Both God and man that all hath made, the Sunne of heauenly seed: Whom caytiues none can tray, whom tirants none can kill, Oh ioy, and ioyfull happy day, when wretches want their will.
