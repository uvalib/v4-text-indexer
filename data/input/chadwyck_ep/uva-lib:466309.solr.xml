      <field name="fulltext">PYGMALION TO MY WIFE Alice Gertrude I OFFER THIS VISION OF THE PAST PRELUDE. Who can extract its secret from the rose, Or tell us why the violet glows; Or tulips, why in mystic stripes they flame, Why crimson poppies burn in shame? Who shall expound why man with open fate Chooses for partner ash-faced Hate; When shy, soft, willing Love, deliciously, In warmth and smiles stands blushing by? Who can say why bold rulers love to lie, And mean ones love to mystify? By what perversity of logic led, When truth would stand in better stead! That Love should turn from Love and paradise To riches, vanity, or vice; Barter the glory of a life's content, Is marvel and bewilderment! But I will leave to moralists the Why Things unseen are not seen, and try Wing'd venture into days remote and old, Till I the mystery unfold How passion deep, and Aphrodite's aid, Resolved to life that wondrous Maid, Pygmalion wrought in marble, by the stress Of worship, to pure loveliness. BOOK I. Pygmalion ardent-eyed, of eager speech Which even closest friends misunderstood, Was sorely troubled with a passionate hope To bring the Gods' own language, sculpture, down For mortal exaltation. Thus mused he: Men made in marble look but men, no more; But Gods in sculpture are immortal powers To whom we kneel helplessly lost in awe. Man wrought the men and also wrought the Gods. In making Gods doth Pallas give device, And Hermes put strange cunning in the hand, And Hyperion fill the eyes with light, Such greatness shows when mortals work for Gods? Thus wandered he in mazes: when perchance He caught a seeming clue and onward strove, Sudden a blank impossibility Closed his advance and drove him wide again; Till effort breeding failure sickened him, Who, like a squirrel in a turning cage, Found himself where he was for all his pains. By watchful constancy of tenderness, By the melodious pathos of his voice, And his refulgent presence day by day, Pygmalion charmed his mateless mother's home. Nor could her love have spared him, save for high And godlike quest, or service to the state. Mindful, in woman's fondness, of the tall Lithe form, smooth sinewy arms, those eyes so full Of gracious light and sweet attent, came back The days agone; when, with her lord alone, Safe in the strength of his nerved arms' defence, Along the shore they saw sun-smitten waves, Casting back light from their long shoulder lines, Plunge shattering the beach; a whispered hiss Following the roar in thralled monotony. And when on shady forest bank he lay Tranced at her feet; a plectrum in his hand, By tuneful touch urging the song he sang To her as fairest of all womanhood. Or, when their city thronged the chariot race, A meteor he flashed by, his eyes alight, His horses' eyes alight, to victory: When all the matrons, all the maidens turned Straightway on her to gaze! Thus with the past The blessed present blent, till life became One rounded thankfulness and prayer the Gods Would hold it whole and scathless to the end. Beside her household slaves, and those who won Their freedom by their worth, twelve noble maids Did suit and service to uphold her state And learn from her the management of home. All fit observances of time and place; All secrets of the loom; skill in the use Of warp and weft; their textures various; Colours unchangeable, to each one fit. Of herbs: knowledge of food and cordial drinks: Pastimes, and exercises: when was best To lave their lovely bodies in the sea, And race, with garments looped, across the lawn. Whatever made them prudent, strong, and fair, Worthy to wed with heroes and to rear A race of children bold and beautiful. No greatest painter by the Gods beloved, Painting their deeds on their own Temple walls Gave more devotion to the forms that grew Day after day beneath his subtle hand, Than she in fashioning her maidens' lives Unto their fullest nature: each one's gifts Brightening with use, expanding in the press Of loving rivalry and sympathy, Working together under wise control. No daughters could love more, or be more loved. Unlike, but all as one when bending low They gave to her the simultaneous “Hail” Of morning salutation. Phoebe, dark, High-born and of most lofty vein, disdained Belief in meanness, save as some defect Strange and unblamable, like stench of fox. Calliope her sworn friend next, who might Be sister, so alike in voice and ways. Eos the tender: great blue timid eyes, Fleetest of foot; of such an easy pace When at her utmost speed and seen afar She looked a drifting cloud. Then Myrrha who Would play and sing of dragons, demigods, And fields of blood: which, calm Ianthe thought, Might well be changed for men and pastorals, Corn-laughing harvests, flocks, and dulcet grapes. But gay Metharme doubted; vowed that blood Was manly; that foul dragon's blood enriched The soil and brought forth heavier crops; that men Were born to slay and dragons to be slain. Euphrosyne would rather sing of light, How the God made our world afresh each morn With new-born flowers, new strength to man and beast, Then smiled in dazzling splendours his farewell. But Thisbe, olive-hued, whose Sire had come From far-off sunny lands, wondered what dark Drear fate was on the God he dwelt each night With darkness and with Death! Or can it be He goes to lands unknown and shines on men And other maidens at their tasks as here? A wealth of sumptuous grace was Smyrna, who Murmured to stately Clytie “Dreams again: Our Thisbe's Eastern dreams!” “Nay, Western say,” Cried sprightly Neis, “for thence the God departs!” Aglaia meek, gentle in all her ways, Took truest note of every duty charged And kindly aiding was beloved of all. Each maiden had her well-appointed work, Either to weave; to measure seeds, or oil; Direct the corn-grinding; stow safe the fruits Sun-dried erewhile, or in wild honey kept. Some cleared the garment-presses to espy Amid care-woven wool, linen, or silks If moth made havoc. Numbers variable Of slaves, or women freed, suited to needs, Obeyed each maid's command; doing all rough And lower labour: but the sacred Gods No slave on pain of high displeasure dares Finger: Aglaia, she whose white hands fell Softly as snowflakes on a windless day, Reverently, with lightest zephyr touch Of swandown plume, beats off the summer dust. A ruler born; tho' mistress of each art, Wisely the matron at no labour toiled, But held a watchful eye on every maid, With guidance here and gentle pressure there, By hint or look, by tone, and words of cheer Kept the mixed household one harmonious whole. BOOK II. Beyond a cloud of pines the chambers stood Where toiled Pygmalion. Loftily they rose And widely stretched; by the curved pathway grew Laurel alternately with honoured bay On either side in pairs: between each pair An oleander gorgeous in the bloom Of rosy light gladdened the massive green: While flanking all gigantic cypresses And olives huge in gnarled antiquity Made an elysium for the birds of heaven. It was Pygmalion's wont to rise at dawn, Reach the lone shore and plunge into the sea; And after joyful buffet with the waves Begin his labours with the singing day. At times he wandered far along the sands And drank the radiant beams as from the waves They flashed in light and laughter to his feet; Wondering how man with such a heritage In splendours manifold, his own each day For ever, passed that span 'twixt birth and death In hate, and wild beast clutchings after gain Through wild beast slaughters; giving scantily To love, and loveliness, and kindly acts! Or he would range the forest solitudes To meditate by what new feats of art That ever-present beauty haunting him Could be in substance bound and manifest; And how the life that beamed in all he saw Could be made beam to others as to him. These lapses from close labour nerved his will, Which, quickening half-born dreams and thoughts obscure To living truths, gave him the strength he craved Whereby to animate the forms he wrought With nature's varied movement; pause and play Of impulse: complex outwardly in strain And laxity alert. Armed with this power The damp impressible clay glanced into light Along the tendons' length; hardened to bone; And tightened straightway into comely shape Beneath his certain touch. Hard marble changed, In softened shadows rounding tenderly To firm elastic life: and what anon Was but as chaos beamed a new delight More lasting than all beauty born of man. Pygmalion now was working to reveal The wonder of great Aphrodite's birth. How raged Lycurgus at the proffered gift Of Dionysus. How Prometheus bound Was spared the vulture's beak by Heracles. And how rebellious Titans overthrown Writhed shattered under Zeus omnipotent. These were the deeds he conned, and strove to show On four great walls of marble pure and white. Cytherea. Uprisen from the sea when Cytherea, Shining in primal beauty, paled the day, The wondering waters hushed. They yearned in sighs That shook the world: tumultuously heaved To a great throne of azure laced with light And canopied in foam to grace their Queen. Shrieking for joy came Oceanides, And swift Nereides rushed from afar Or clove the waters by. Came eager-eyed Even shy Naiades from inland streams, With wild cries headlong darting thro' the waves; And Dryads from the shore stretched their lorn arms. While hoarsely sounding heard was Triton's shell; Shoutings uncouth; sudden, bewildered sounds; And the innumerable splashing feet Of monsters gambolling around their God, Forth shining on a seahorse, fierce, and finned. Some bestrode fishes glinting dusky gold, Or angry crimson, or chill silver bright; Others jerked fast on their own scaly tails; And seabirds, screaming upwards either side, Wove a vast arch above the Queen of Love, Who, gazing on this multitudinous Homaging to her beauty, laughed: She laughed The soft delicious laughter that makes mad; Low warblings in the throat that clench man's life Tighter than prison bars. Then swayed a breath Of odorous rose and scented myrtle mixed, That toyed the golden radiance round her brows To wavy flames. When lo! sweet murmurings Spread sudden silence on that gathered host! And, as sped arrows to their mark; as bees Drop promptly on the honey'd flower, as one Shone the three daughters of Eurynome, Aglaia, and Thalia; each an arm In reverence taking fondled tenderly; Then pressed their blushing cheeks against her breasts: And loved Euphrosyne, scarcely less fair Than Cytherea's self, lay her white length Kissing the sacred feet. Such honour paid The powers of nature to the power of Love, Creation's longed-for Wonder sprung to life! Now, as a man lifts up a little child, Placing it down where he would have it walk, The wave of mighty azure forward driven By magic impulse sheer in downward slope Fell, then drawn backward sank, and was no more; Leaving the Goddess on her Cyprian coast. And when her feet first touched the trembling sand, She fired awakened Earth's remotest veins To strange ethereal ecstasies; as birds Brighten to clamour by the fires of morn. Thus to Pygmalion beamed the wondrous Birth; And this in pure immortal marble he Laboured to show; bound by those rules of Art The Wise had found inexorably fixed. Dionysus. When Dionysus, flushed triumphantly From Indian deeds, rich-bronzed by Indian suns, And riotous in delightful lustihood, First touched the shore of Thrace; around him thronged His large-limbed, cymbal-clashing nymphs; rough fauns. Braying horn trumpets; ruddy satyrs danced, Clicking their hard hoofs on the harder rocks: Weak-kneed Silenus, puffing, on both sides Upheld by grinning slaves, who plied the cup, Wherein two nymphs squeezed juice of dusky grapes. Bright girls and agile youths curvetting wild On leopards, bitted, straining gilded reins, Nigh touched the God, lolling on tiger huge, Silent of footfall, tawny flamed and striped; He with his ivied spear pointing the way. Stout baby boys, bestriding frisky goats, Clutched fast their horns when arching up to butt; Rolling each other under perilous paws. Behind walked modest maids and men sedate Whose charge it was to bear the nurseling vines. In logbuilt palace grim Lycurgus, King, Scornful of corn and oil and every fruit, Ate flesh himself had slain. He hunted sure, Tracking his prey by signs to certain fate. Came unto him the din: first faintly heard; Soon swelling into loud uproar that burned The blood within him to a warlike rage; When, seizing nearest weapons, head unhelmed, Clattering spear on shield, he rushed without And to his people shouted vehemently. Hastily arming, wondering, on they came, Obedient to the call; fast they formed rank; Led by their King fast strode to meet the God. When Dionysus saw this threatening front Advance and pause, the King's eyes darting fires Of anger under knitted brows, before He put his helmet on and fastened it; Lightly he left the tiger's back, to meet And offer make the King, in accents soft Of nurseling plants that seasonably would grow Abundant grapes and load his land with wealth, Thro' which his people might by interchange Take toll of others' best; and thus increase Their gladness: so, by multiplying needs Quicken their energies to wider range Of action; growing greater with the march Of timely circumstance, that ever aids All willing workers towards some statelier end. Whereat Lycurgus smiling ghastliwise: This then your plea for bursting on my lands Without leave asked! To give my men a boon Which swells them in their own esteem to Gods, But leaves them beasts, without clear-sightedness Of beasts. We are content to feed on flesh Provided by the Gods: but not content To scrape, and scratch, and dig the earth for food, Like slave that knoweth not the use of arms. Fruit is for babes; flesh for the teeth of man. Behold your bloat Silenus! What unstrung The sinews of his knees, that scarcely bear The over-burdened weight above? To steal Man's strength, and give instead unwieldy size: Is this your boon! With other states we will Not deal save with our swords and spears. And last, As touching this exalted life you vaunt, How fared it with Damascus, good old King? Who would have saved his people from this taint That fouls the blood to weakness, sickness, death; But you corrupted them; and him you slew! How of his skin? Was it to leather tanned To hold your grape juice stored! Owls! Owls! I say, Owls! And down spears! Then, as a sudden gust On corn, hurtling fell down the spears as one To deadly point of menace. Shifting round His wolfskin; right arm free forth leaped the King And cried the charge. Stepping some paces back, Nearly as Powers who know the future can Be struck amazed at acts of mortal man An instant in immortal sorrow gazed The God surprised. Then from his features flashed A lurid lightning glare portending doom. Lowering his lance whilom at shivering poise He moved stern-visaged towards the ocean cliffs. Now whistling shrill, winged death in volleys flew; Now charged the press of spears in level line; Now crashed the storm in shouts and shrieks and cries; Huddling confused they clambered interlocked Hindering escape. Quick-eyed Lycurgus sent Swift-footed bowmen to outrun and head Inland the rout before they made the sea. When Dionysus saw Necessity, Before whose presence Zeus himself must bow, Oppose his cherished plan, and Hope saw not, Scaling an ocean crag he cried aloud Woe to the mortal who assaults a God! Fear; palsied madness; some outrageous death! Come the Erinyes soon: I hear their wings! Then at Lycurgus hurling his green spear Thro' metal shield and right uplifted arm; He plunged down headlong in the plunging waves, Where Thetis, by the mightiest Gods beloved, Calming the waters saved the God from hurt. Thus saw Pygmalion Dionysus' gift Roughly rejected by Lycurgus, King. And this in pure immortal marble he Laboured to show; bound by those rules of Art The Wise had found inexorably fixed. Prometheus. Prometheus lived not wholly God nor man, But nobler far than all the Gods of heaven, Save one, Pallas Athena, whom he loved; And she, The Wise One, loved Prometheus. But Not as the love of mortals was her love, Nor loves of other Gods. He, Titan, dared Encourage man against the harsh decrees Of Zeus, who minded they should cease to live, Being base, and restless, asking, helpless things. As one decrees whose tillage has been cropped With seeds and roots unsuited to the soil. But brooding pity great Prometheus moved At men's poor efforts to endure a war Opposing adverse fate. He saw their lands Smiling in ripening corn and tended fruits Ravaged by one great storm to uselessness: And when the suppliants prayed almighty Zeus For help, no answer came but blank despair. Saw swarming hosts, lacking one ray to light Their blindness, close in deadly strife, till soaked In blood, and thinned by loss, their argument Is solved in desolation. Famines saw Conjunct with foulness breeding pestilence; Floods overspreading uncontrollable, Sweep them to sudden and resistless ruin. He saw their anguish. As they had no choice In their own birth, they were perforce released Of shend or blame in their wild ways forlorn: Where ignorance paced by them step for step, With chance and danger dogging at their heels. Prometheus, he of all the Heavenly-born, Alone felt sympathy for wretched man. By grief emboldened he Athena sought And kneeling to her Presence made his boon: One ray to guide these gadding wanderers; One spark of fire divine that they may melt Their metals, bake their corn, and roast their flesh; For you best know, O Goddess, your clear word Brings scattered many into strength compact, And turns the front of blind antagonism. Grant you the fire and I myself will show How metal red shall run like melted wax And harden into spears. Hard must it be For pigmies with their clubs, and flint-made blades Fighting with lions, boars, and savage bulls; And hard to eat their flesh, like lions, raw; Their tasteless, unbaked corn. The Titan's zeal Made great Athena smile: amused, she asked If next his prayer importune would for bees, Which store their food and also eat it raw: Or if for goats, to arm their horns and feet That they may war with lions. Bending low, He looked so meek and sad: he could not smile; He spoke not; eyes alone making appeal Once more. Not love of man, but from deep love Of him Prometheus she her promise gave Of counsel: promised he should snatch the fire From torch of Eros, thunderbolt of Zeus, Or from the car of Helios seize a spark. And when at length thro' fears unspeakable, Tho' shadowed by Athena's dreadful shield, He snatched the fire and brought it down to man, The wrath of Zeus was thundered thro' the hills, And shook the base of heaven. So fiercely flew The fire throughout mankind, he saw no less Than deluge overwhelming the whole world Could quench it now. And as relentless Fate Decreed this could not be, his rage he turned Against the godlike Thief, and punished him With pain more dire and unendurable Than e'er was known either by God or man. After Prometheus had for ages borne The tearing of the demon's eagle beak: Whether remembrance of high service done When the leagued Giants made their huge assault; Or tired to hear his yells of agony; Or that he from the Titan's lips had learned To dread the offspring of his Thetis loved; Great Zeus at length relenting sent his Son, Strong Heracles, to slay the fiend, and set Prometheus bold, the mighty Titan, free. The feathered demon flapping in the dust, The Sufferer delivered. The wild joy That Naiades brought down from mountain streams: Dryads and Nymphs with long uplifted arms Shouting their exultation he was free! This was a scene that charged Pygmalion's soul: And this in pure immortal marble he Laboured to show; bound by those rules of Art The Wise had found inexorably fixed. Zeus. Ere the omnipotence of Zeus was known By every Power of Earth, and Sea, and Air; The Titans, who had sometime been a law Each to himself, bore the outrageous load, Enforced authority! Their ancient joy Was gone; their old prerogative to lounge Through the long sunshine; or to work at will. The galling need to worship what they loathed; Or seem to worship, which they loathed yet more; Made brooding hate grow deadlier day by day, And deepen in the dreamings of the night, When the mysterious fires of darkness burned Watching the fates of Titans and of Gods; Till anger burst in flame; and all as one Were bent on war to battle for their own. Great Zeus beholding vapour rise to cloud And thicken dark to threatening storm among The furious Titans, to Athena spoke Asking her aid and counsel in the strife Impending. If on Mount Olympus they Should wait assault; or to the plain descend And crush the Giants there. Athena thought It best the Titans came to waste their strength Climbing the steep and overhanging crags; For even Titans scale not heights as these Without fatigue; and when fatigued more light The work to slay them. Help she would demand Of skilled Prometheus, so that he may smooth Our heights more inaccessible to grip Of feet and clasp of hands: and, Titan born, He knows their fighting ways. The Thunderer smiled Benignly that his might redoubled through His Daughter, Wise, and bowed his head divine. The secret purpose glowing in his soul, Unwearied, wrought Prometheus. For he had With sure fore-knowledge seen the Giants' doom, And hoped by serving the Olympian Gods To claim for wage a spark of Heaven's fire. Without this hope, even his love for Her, Pallas Athena, scarce could make him front In death-determined contest his own kin, Playmates of yore, rough, and untamable. But for his pigmies, who fast multiplied, And waxed in force with every watched-for chance; He was invincibly resolved to win The vital spark by which alone they might Be lifted from the brutes. Therefore toiled he Incessantly; shaping huge blocks to fit One on the other close, and side by side. Not straight, as falls a stone, was built the wall, But sloping, as a spear that stands at rest; The outward face against the danger smooth By chiselling square and true. When piled a height He knew inviolable, Prometheus, now Served by the Cyclops three, in caldrons vast, With fires of roaring forest trees, that breathed A thousand years of sun, hewn short to logs, Rough metals melted, white, and red, and gold, And poured the burning splendour from above, Filling up every joint and crevice down To the foundations on the living rock In solid mass compact; which stretched across From mountain wall to wall. While sheer behind Hung cliffs, accessible alone to flight Of eagles, or the wings of drifting storm, Leaving but one way for the huge assault. Since the great Earth from Chaos first was hatched, And fledged herself in wonders sun by sun, And moon by moon, no wonder held the light, Filling the day with such resplendent awe, As when the Titans armed with oaks, upwrenched, And lumps of rock, enormous, forward moved In even paces towards the huge assault: And the Olympian Gods awaiting them In range for action! Brighter than clear noon Shone Zeus; within whose hands quivered the bolts Of thunder-fire flashing impatiently. While on his right Pallas Athena stood Well nigh as tall: her dreadful shield behind Her thrown, its horror toward the cliffs: Her spear Looked a fixed star emitting baleful light. He who made Ocean tame, Poseidon, great Earth-shaker, by his Brother's side, aloft His ocean sceptre held as he would crash The rock-bound world. Ares his whole length lay Watching the Titans' march. And hovering round The bird of Zeus hung darkly over all. Their shouts uniting made a howl that mocked Olympian thunders, or deep ocean's rage At utmost press of storm; the Giants' rush Began in breathless climb, in desperate leap; Their monstrous sizes looming on the heights Like moving worlds. Some stooping tried to reach Help to their brothers. Hindering fragments some Tore off to fill and bridge a rift profound: Vainly all shoulders join to heave aside A mountain mass. Severely smiled the Gods At useless efforts, seeing them descend Adventuring afresh. Then Pallas, winged, Half fiend, uprose scanning around, and saw A path whereby the plain at length was free Reaching unbroken the Olympian wall. A while the Titans panted; their tried hearts In throbs of muffled thunder beating doom. Vast crags upheaving, brandishing whole oaks, With every root upwrenched; they with a roar Like earthquake, in stupendous bounds, their weight Shaking the earth that seemed with them to move, Rushed on their fate making the huge assault. At this uproar serenely gazed the Gods Expectant. Striding forth, Enceladus Hurled a great rock aimed at the brows of Zeus, Whose bolt in mid air shivered it to dust, Dashing its fragments in the Giants' sight; Their rocky masses, now thrown wide and wild, Fell harmless. Then by Styx, the Thunderer swore, This soon should end, and let his lightnings play. His bolts scored ghastly chasms through their flesh; And death flew in the shafts of Heracles; While Ares stamped his foot and shook his shield, And thro' the nearest sent his joyful lance. Pallas, the Giant-fiend, seizing a rock, Winged his way upward with the fell intent To crush the brain of Zeus, whose eagle saw, And, darting high, swooped on the Giant's nape, Tearing his head. To free himself the fiend Let fall the stone, which struck a Titan dead, And, mad for pain, alighted on the space Held by the Gods: where, neither pain nor hate Glared through his eyes when on Athena fixed He at her garment clutched with vulture claws; She, drawing back a pace, regarded him. She did not face him with her Gorgon shield. She did not frown. Her look was worse than death, When, poising spear, the irresistible, She crashed him through the brain. With sudden strength, Almost of Heracles, Silenus dragged The carcass to the wall and rolled it down. Sprang the lost Giants on the lifeless bulk; Some kneeling down for others to mount higher, Hoping their wrath might scale the hopeless wall. And lo! By frantic bounds, two hard-strained hands The wall grasped tight! Swifter than falcon's speed The blade of Ares clove the knotted wrists; And dropped the vast bulk down the heaven-built wall. The ruined Titan falling, with him bore His clambering brethren in a tangled mass That burst the earth up like a splash of waves With thund'rous sound, and momentary night Of dust. In heaps uncouth the Giants lay Slaughtered, or writhing from the huge assault. Thus saw Pygmalion Titans overthrown; Some writhing yet among the huddled dead: While Zeus above, His Powers on either side, Stood with His ready bolts omnipotent. And this in pure immortal marble he Laboured to show; bound by those rules of Art The Wise had found inexorably fixed. BOOK III. It was Ianthe's duty every noon To bring Pygmalion bread, and fruit, and wine, And place them in the chamber where he wrought. At times she saw he heeded not; so bound Unto the dimly formed uncertain things His active chisel laboured to release From their confinement in the marble world. She dared not break the spell: and quietly Returned unnoticed. But more often he Graciously owned the care and gentleness She day by day bestowed. Then would she pour For him the wine: offer the bread and fruit: And maybe tarry to behold his skill Translating into substance visible Love's tenderness, or passion's smouldering depths. How shaped Aglaia's cheek against the charm Of Aphrodite's breast. How the sharp lines Of agony Prometheus must endure, Tortured less cruelly his spacious brow: Or gloomed the shades of power more deeply calm And terrible within the eyes of Zeus. Well pleased to watch from time to time the Gods, And others, cleared of their embarrassment. His Mother with Ianthe came one day In azure June to watch her son at work; For she had fears unceasing toil might fret, If left unminded, her Pygmalion's strength. She would press on him nourishment, and plead He took more rest and sportful exercise. They found him mounted higher than the ground Working at Cytherea's smile. His floor Was overspread with mat, the Matron's slaves Wove of green rushes, soft of pith, that he Be spared unnecessary noise, even noise Of his own footsteps, in those rarer moods When thought is striving to complete itself. Pausing, the Matron and Ianthe watched Admiringly, the chisel's dainty play Soften the valley 'twixt the cheek and mouth, Sweeten the laughter rippling thro' the lips, And fine the chin to rarer witchery. They might have waited long, for he was lost In Aphrodite's laugh and loveliness, As they were well-nigh lost regarding him. But prudently the Mother curbed her joy At her son's handcraft; and solicitous That her main errand proved not profitless, Signed to Ianthe, who poured out the wine, And asked, Will you drink wine, my Lord? He turned, Gazing as one awakened from a dream, Eyes on the maiden fixed. Descending, then He to his Mother bending reverently, Kissed her loved hands. Ianthe, drink will I! Without libation would I drain a cup That should Silenus shame commanded by One so imperiously meek! But now You looked as a great Hebe meet to fill His goblet for high Zeus sitting enthroned! Moved in the pure white blossom of her cheeks A tinge of rose: taking the cup she placed It down; then brought him bread and fruit. He cried, O mother, give me your assent and I Will carve Ianthe as she stood erewhile Pouring the wine, a Hebe, child of Zeus And Hera, pouring nectar for the God! In her deep eyes there shone an upward awe As though she gazed at Zeus gazing at her. The matron smiled, and said, if Hebe he Must carve, Eos the tender was most fit; Being of lighter form, and what would seem To men the figure of immortal youth. Eos were well, my Mother, were I bound To make her fill the cup for Heracles, Or her own brother Ares. But I mean To make her serving Zeus her Father, who, Throwing his thunders makes Olympus shake; Ianthe's gaze alone for him is fit. Your work is hard, my Son; your health will fail If worked to overstrain. Fear not for me O Mother! Labour in its fullest force Heightens the blood; gives to the limbs their strength, And scales by storm the noblest heights of thought. It is the daily cark and constant dread That fret the body down to wretchedness. But feel this arm, and judge if that be weak! She laid her hand upon his lissom arm, Fine on its surface as the myrtle flower, Hard as the shoulder of the proudest horse, First in a chariot race. Though thus assured, The Mother felt his shot beyond her range. Now daily came Ianthe to repeat The posture for Pygmalion which he chose For youthful Hebe when she filled the cup Of Zeus. Hard was the Maiden's task, for she Flinched not at tingling nerves and throbbing pulse; Tho' dizzy oft from the continual strain Of keeping motionless. He, all absorbed, Regarded her but as a beauteous shape Aiding him in the Godlike counterfeit, Unconscious what she felt. Amazed each day By fresh perfections dawning, he, each day, More resolutely toil'd. The gracefulness And pride of her long rounded throat, his hands Changed into awkwardness by mimicry. The arches of her shoulders! Could he touch On curves so exquisitely drooped, their sheen Of movement tremulous! In despair he sighed, Avowing it impossible for hand To trace the lines in full variety Throughout the space of that majestic breast; Of dignity so peerless that if clad In the great Virgin's golden armour scales They would but seem a suitable defence. Ianthe, calmly perfect, stood complete In youthful strength, whose easy negligence Of varying grace baffled the captive sight To trace her beauties thro' the play and flush Of bounding health exulting in its home! Though uncomplainingly she bore the strain Pleased was Ianthe when a slanting ray Brightening Prometheus as he lay enchained Proclaimed the noon. One day on going back Caught was she half-way in the curving path, By gust so boisterous she needs must stop, And battling with her fluttering folds, was blown Half round, and chancing saw Pygmalion stand Within the doorway shade regarding her. Delightfulness ran trembling through her limbs. An unfamiliar music beat her heart! She moved without her feet. Metharme cried Cheeks apple-blossoms; and how rough your hair, Ianthe! Yes, the wind against me beat So forcibly I scarce could make my way. We saw the struggling. Well knew Boreas The sweetness of a wrestle with the charms Of one so well endowed. Your garments he Plucked at so wildly I began to dread We might become like old Tiresias When great Athena bathed! Metharme, hush: Pray hush! The Matron urged; seeing how prompt Her Maidens' titter at the quaint conceit, Ianthe robbed and vanquished to her own White beauty bare, in native comeliness. Ianthe spoke not but the blush remained. Doves softly cooing murmurs musical Gladdened unseen the darksome cloud of pines: Below bright-hued innumerable wings Carried love messages from flower to flower. For Spring's outstretching fingers nearly touched The Summer's welcoming hands. Pygmalion's work On Hebe's statue now was nearly done; Tho' yet her features lacked that splendid gaze Of worship which Pygmalion saw, or thought He once saw in Ianthe's face, and fired The passionate belief he could present Immortal Hebe pouring for the God. While looking on Ianthe's comely sway Of body, and her shapely limbs, ofttimes His spirit sickened hopelessly. The way Her large and dainty fingers held the cup Would make the taste of nectar more divine. The arched perfection of her supple feet Might stay the flight of Hermes to be kissed! These seemed to him as unattainable As flight of lark singing in deepest blue To creeping unwinged things. But now, alas! He could not through her features penetrate And find the glory which he knew must dwell In Hebe's brow. Perfect was her face. From dark gray eyes of dawn the gazer's sight Would tenderly on her pure forehead rest. Her nostrils breathed a purer air than Earth's; And the clear curves that marked her drooping mouth Would seem of discontent, save for the two Full roses midway kissing. Half distraught, Remembering how, as from a mystic dream, He woke and saw Ianthe, as she stood Holding the wine, believed the splendid gaze He saw, a remnant of his dream, and not Ianthe's own, as he thought heretofore. Awhile at this perplexed, a tremor crept Upon him, for he feared that never more That gaze, as at a God, should he behold; And mayhap, the bright touch of life divine Be wanting to his Hebe. Therefore he, Having the Maiden's features fashioned true, Used them no more: but down the inmost depths His memory could sound sought the lost light To quicken Hebe's eyes, as though she gazed At Zeus upon his throne gazing on her. Now that Ianthe was no longer there A part of daily labour, sometimes came The sense of want, or loss, as if the day Were chill with clouds. The habit had so grown Of looking to her form for guidance sure, Often he found himself at gaze upon The empty platform where she sometime stood Earnestly bent on giving him all aid. And when at noon Ianthe came, the clouds Vanished to nothing in the golden prime. BOOK IV. Longed not Prometheus for the fire of heaven Wherewith to solace miserable man, More vehemently than sought Pygmalion The spark to flash his Hebe into life. His utmost stopped at failure; spent, he felt Powerless, helpless, if unaided now By gracious favour of immortal Love. The sunshine in his soul; his tranquil home; His work, making the high Olympian Gods Known to his fellows by their mighty deeds, Left not Pygmalion hapless; though his wish Strove ever onwards, urged unceasingly By hope and growing powers. Willing to know How others would respect his Hebe's form, He asked his Mother to bring all her Maids To pass their judgment. In their stateliness Processional, the Maidens came in threes, And pairs; some cast long loving arms around Each other's waists and shoulders. Hand in hand Walked some; and some half loitering plucked at sprigs Or flowers, or listened tranced the nightingale Warbling pathetic secrets all may hear And few may understand. The Matron last With calm Ianthe came. Advanced, her son Had come to meet them in the curving path. He hailed them gaily; vowed the blooming Hours, Or the tall Graces with the Muses nine, Marching together had not looked more fair! Entering, the Matron and her Maidens ranged Themselves at fitting distance; mute awhile Ere the twelve-voiced home oracle pronounced. Some on the mat, rushwoven, sat them down; While others lounged on seats: some leaned against The farthest wall, holding their heads aslant And hands in movement, conned the work by parts. Phoebe spoke first, and thought the statue good: True to Ianthe's stately grace. A new And splendid Temple were a fitting home. Like our Ianthe, yes, Metharme cried; But is it like young Hebe? Were it not That serving scarcely suits, it well might be Her Mother awestruck at the bolts of Zeus. Myrrha thought gay Metharme just; and said Eos the tender were a fitter form For Hebe: being active she could fill For all the Gods, and ready be again Ere the first bowl was drained. The sprightly Neis Declared Eos as Hebe would be waste: No need for such a wondrous length of stride Passing from God to God. As Syrinx she Were better far; though, had the Nymph been fleet As Eos, Pan had worn his clattering hoofs To stumps before he caught her! Eos thought She might be fashioned Nymph of Artemis To hurry thro' the woods with bow and spear. Eos, your thought is vain, Smyrna replied; Seeing an arrow-stricken stag throw long Last filming gaze towards the fading hills, Would wear with tears those great blue timid eyes To redness like his wound. Next Clytie thought; She would not yet say what she thought. To her The statue seemed more like Ianthe than A statue. Is it pardonable fault For statue not to look one? She had doubts. Pygmalion's hand took Thisbe; him she thanked With upraised eyes, head gently bending low. Euphrosyne thought Phoebe's judgment just; But felt with Clytie. Never statue she Had seen of man or God to her was worth Such warm respect, so pleasant on the sight. This was perchance most due to love she bore Ianthe: for in truth the statue looked Ianthe, but without her charm. Though this, Wanting her placid voice and ways, was more Than art in fullest flower can fairly give. What says Aglaia? Meek Aglaia said The features wanted rarer loveliness; An easier grace to sway throughout the form; A closer fineness in the lengths and joints Of those grand limbs to be Ianthe. Though, These needful changes made, she should regard The work as worthy to be named from her Who underwent the burden and the toil Day after day posturing motionless Many exhausted moons. Her charge, to hold The household Gods inviolate, made her, Perhaps, note statues more than others. But She from Calliope would like to learn Her thoughts; for, calm observer, often she Sees more than those who talk. Thus challenged spoke Calliope: she longed to make a change In name. Instead of Hebe serving Zeus, Ianthe pouring for Pygmalion. Of fit or unfit no complexities Need then intrude to vex and mystify. The statue telling its own simple tale, Tho' from Olympus brought to common earth, Yet faithful to its name, enchants all hearts To love, by candour and simplicity. Then spoke the Matron. All have given theirs, Now let us hear Ianthe's thoughts; if she Would like the statue named from Hebe, or Herself. But just, after Pygmalion's wish, Her wishes should be first. As all agreed, They asked the Maiden frankly to declare. Metharme then: Ianthe; hair is smooth, Else look you, now, as on that blustering day Returning from your wrestle with Boreas, All apple-blossom. When we had such dread! Ready the titter. Dainty shoulders rose And shook; some Maids took instant coughs, and some Looked gravely wise, their hands before their mouths. Pygmalion's Mother asked why on the cup Young Eros sported with Euphrosyne? Ianthe, shy and all aglow, believed Pygmalion only knew undoubtedly His aim, and if his efforts struck or missed; The name must therefore rest with him alone. She postured for him, as she daily poured, When bringing food at noon; in both she hoped Aiding his toil: but neither gave her claim To take from Hebe, an Olympian God, Her name, and glorify herself therewith. Abundant was Pygmalion's thankfulness, Acknowledging the careful scrutiny Of the whole noble throng; he promise made To weigh well every hint; especially Of tender Eos, for those lights she cast On dark doubts in his soul. Laughingly, she, At speeches I am overmatched, but come Down to the shore and test my speed to where The lion-rock pushes his paws beneath The waves: ten, your own paces, you shall take Before I start. Nay Eos, you could give Twelve, I believe, and then have better chance. But know, O fleet One, some are made to stand And fight, and some to run away. But when Some blessed warrior calls our Eos his, Not by rough capture will he win the prize: That must be won by mild approach; for she Had beaten great Achilles unequipped Though swifter than all Greeks. With pretty praise My Lord makes wonders of his Maiden's gift, And hopes, by dazing us, to blink retreat And show his skill in words. But will he sing With equal fortune if I challenge him To contest for a song? Willingly he Would try a verse: taking his lyre in hand, With solemn countenance he struck the chords. Darkly whisper forest leaves When I am sad; Brighter things they say to me When I am glad. I would they laughed the gladsome things When I am sad; I should not hate those whispers dark When I am glad. On bough a white dove gazed at me When I was sad; In grass a serpent gazed at me When I was glad: I hated dove to gaze at me When I was sad; I laughed to see the serpent gaze When I was glad. Then Eos taking her Lord's lute began Vaguely prattle forest leaves When I am weak and dreary; Mighty things they talk to me When I am strong and cheery. O reverse them! I feared a linnet's gaze at me When I was weak and dreary; And scorned a serpent's gaze at me When I was strong and cheery. Why rehearse them? A merry clash of laughter pealed around As Eos ended. Loud the verdict rang The shortest being best; though something like The song before. Pygmalion also laughed, Avowing, gaily, that an audience pledged To one against the other, could not hold The balance true. The Judges therefore he Impeach'd of favour to the sacred Nine. The sentence passed; the Judgment now broke up, Leaving Pygmalion to his solitude. His bitter longing still unsatisfied. From noontide's broadest blaze no light for him: From spacious clouds, the noontide's chariots, Traversing day's eternal dome in long White ranges splendid, or receding far To ether pale, he saw no God descend. When asked, the wandering winds gave no regard Adventuring on to wastes remote, unknown. The flowers kept fast their secrets why so bright And bountiful of sweets. Successive waves Told only their own regularity, Though ever whispering to the sands they kissed. And men in council, or in market-place Seemed unto him babbling of emptiness. Hard unresponsive was the open world; No voice spoke cheer within. At length resolved On craving aid from Heaven, to Her Temple he With offerings of doves and myrtle boughs, Wearied and anxious sought the Queen of Love. Before a pan of fire on tripod placed Pygmalion knelt. All unabashed his doves Cooed in their new-found home complacently. The Priestess incense burned; then throwing on The myrtle boughs, with feathers chosen, she Bade him look on the Goddess fronting him With fixed regard; neither to left nor right Swerving, by gaze or glance; above, below; Nor look behind; but offer prayer and wait. Departed then the Priestess; leaving him Alone with Aphrodite and the fire. The flames and fumes between them: as he gazed The Goddess seemed to tremble; Her sweet smile Wavering to sweeter meaning. He felt faint For joy; hazarding an audacious hope To hear Her voice responsive to his prayer. O Goddess, Aphrodite! Queen of All, Thou knowest how I am thy loving slave; And how devoted to thy services I have been since my memory's earliest dawn: That beauty is to me the worth of life Beauty thy privilege, thy very self. When but a babe my nurse against her full, Soft, youthful bosom fondled me to sleep. My hands in never-ending play about Her breasts travelled delightedly, till she Kissed me to slumber and forgetfulness. This, Goddess, was Thy worship. Have not I Ever been diligent for fateful glimpse Of thee in graceful movement; comeliness Of features; and the captivating forms Throughout variety's extremest bounds In women perfected, and tenderest maids! When every creature of the living world Breathed spring's redundancy, no heart has beat More warmly true to Thine enamoured doves In breezy pine tops, or on ground astrut, Than mine. Thy sparrows shrill in twittering flocks, Tho' waging havoc on my promised fruits, Have I alway protected in my love For Thee. Myrtles I planted, intermixed Abundantly with roses, glowing praise And prayer in blushing spaces odorous, For worship of Thy love. In ocean waves Thy presence have I felt encompass me When they have lashed my limbs to lustihood; Or on them I have lain in perilous sway While wondering if the overhanging heaven Were azure deep and lustrous as Thine eyes, Whose emanations fill the strongest Gods With tremblings like to mortals smit by fear, Or eagerness for onset. It is told In ancient stories borne from man to man That all the Gods love Hebe. Zeus lets play On Her His gentlest smile; and pauses ere He takes the nectar from Her offering hand. When She is present Hera looks so sweet Zeus scarce would honour fair mortality With grace so freely did She thus remain. Fierce Ares, He, raising the joyful bowl Grins His delighted thanks. Poseidon, when He smooths caressingly Her lifted cheeks, Declares, that saving Cytherea's self Old ocean never owned so fair a flower. And great Athena tones Her mighty voice, Acknowledging that nectar tendered thus Proves drinking wise, and wisdom beautiful. And Hyperion's eyes such fire emit That Hebe's dazzled eyelids fall as She Fills, and ungazing holds the proffered bowl. Striven have I, O Goddess, to create Hebe's similitude as She might stand Filling His cup for Zeus. I made her young; Fair in her countenance; well-shaped in limb; And lightly poised in force of mute reserve. But spark divine, the throbbing touch of pulse, To touch all other pulses as Her own, She lacks, and looks as one who had not woke. My utmost being done, having so failed By mortal effort, I to Thee appeal O Aphrodite, in Thy love of man To yield the secret, that my handicraft May truly show the awe my spirit feels: Send from Olympus Life! Pygmalion ceased. His senses closed. And from him parted then His inmost self to meet the Goddess, now Aloof and beaming in resplendent light, And shedding azure radiance from Her eyes; She, brightly clad in tissue sunbeam-wove, Diaphanous, no charm concealed whereon He in his awe sublimely dared to gaze; For, like the sun thro' wavering mists of morn, Her beauty pierced. In rapturous suspense Awaiting lips divine to speak his doom, Conscious became he of ethereal sound That filled the universe with song. Each star Joining the chorus in celestial praise To her the Queen of life and loveliness; Whose voice came to him like a violet gust From breezy earth in spring. Know you that I Breathe in the lilies' perfume: daffodils Awake surprise, taking their light from me. I teach the tender nightingales my thought, Rejoicingly they warble in the moon. I start the thistledown's adventurous quest For increase in some happy spot. I nerve Doves to such boldness hawks would they attack: And lions soothe to gentleness so fond, Harmless they sport as playful butterflies. To spin like maids bent I strong Heracles, And Zeus I tempted to become a swan! I draw his clouds together; make them fight; Embrace in flame, and breed live thunderbolts For Him. I put the edge on war. To peace I add the honey. You have felt my power: And shown due reverence by sacrifice, Fitting obeisance, and observances The negligent and savage disregard, The burden borne attests the mortals' faith; And hissing flesh on altars rich men give Often but vaunted unfelt offerings Costing the giver not one cup of joy! The prayers and sacrifices loved of Gods Are man's delight in giving up delights, And checked impulses of the yielding will. Your blameless life has been devotedness To worship of my Beauty through your love. You, wandering darkly, on a starless waste, Tho' worn and sore from stumbling, have not paused In faithfulness, and true to early bent Have sought my succour in perplexity. This my reward, your Hebe shall have life And immortality. Far times to come Shall sing your story. Not the sweetest dream, As stretched you lay on shadowed forest bank, Has ever promised such a paradise As mine awaiting you. But hark! Before These high Olympian gifts are yours to hold, Braced must you be to battle for your own. Dire hate will strew your path with scorpions, And dog you for your life. Foul calumny Will taint your name with poisonous lies, truthtinged, Whereat familiar friends fall back appalled, While other loved ones fledge the barbëd lies. For Gods do not their rarest gifts bestow Without sure test and payment. Men cannot, In earthly state handle pure truth and fire, The means of Gods, and still remain unscorched. But you are strong; the prize shines bright in view, Cost what it may a pathway must be cleared. And if you forward press unfalteringly, Pallas Athena may beside you march. Now Cytherea's dulcet chanting ceased; And on his brow Pygmalion felt Her breath Touch him like frost or fire, and knew no more. BOOK V. In lonesome chamber, darkened, hushed, and cool, Pygmalion lay asleep. Beside him sat His Mother watchful, listening every breath, Timorous and awestruck at the strange event. The Priestess found Pygmalion stretched before The tripod where the fire was dead, and he Himself seemed dead. The Temple Guardians bore Him home, and told all they could tell; when she, His Mother, soon by arts her son restored To life, by chafing; soothing cordials warm And prosperously enticing grateful sleep. Now she sat by and watched him slumbering. No deadliest hate that vigilantly eyes Its victim for the grievous chance, could watch With keener vision than she scanned each change In her belovëd son, the beautiful. Her soul ran thro' the past; when he a babe Against her breast would pause to laugh, and leave His food neglected: while the warlike sire Smiling, declared her eyes would starve the child. Well she remembered when she lost her Lord, The dreadful numbness in her brain; the pang That clenched her heart; and her Pygmalion lay Sorrow be-dabbled in her helpless arms; She not unconscious in some time remote, That sobbing form might grow a comforter To shield her from mischance. Anon she thought With terror should Pygmalion pass away, What would the world be then? No Husband's rule; No point of rally in the unmanned house: A wheel without its tire. Her thoughts sank low And gathered darkness in the deepening, While faintness crept within. Alarmed she saw Pygmalion start and push the coverlet Off his heroic shoulders and broad chest, Asking if it were night; and why she sat Distraught beholding him; and would she lift Aside the curtain and let in the light? She hastened and obeyed wonderingly: Then told him of the Temple Guardians' Tale; His fall before the altar; how they brought Him to the house as he were dead; how she Had soothed him into sleep; from which she now Thanked all the Gods of heaven he did awake With senses perfect, full of questioning. Have food for me dear Mother, I will take A plunge into the waves, when you shall see My appetite is sound whatever else May halt; the rest must tarry now. She left With trembling paces: her full gratitude A feast triumphal rich with new delights. At eventide where they could hear the splash And lisp of everlasting waves sat they, Pygmalion and his Mother, underneath An ancient olive where at hush the wind Whispered of peacefulness for evermore. And there he told her of his sacrifice; How prayer made to the Goddess brought response In Aphrodite's overwhelming grace. Her promise of some mighty good, which though Certain as fate not thereupon unveiled; Followed by threat of taint like pestilence; Friends become foes; shrunk fear, or sudden death. How horror of unwonted foul despite Palsied his steadfastness: sank faint his heart, When lo! the Goddess neared and touched his brow With breath of frost that entered like a spear, And nothing knew he more. She him assured The Gods were just; his faith must patiently Await their issue. Aphrodite's words Would cheer him as a shout victorious In effort's closest press. Malignant hate; Backsliding friends, chorussed disdain; the mince Of small malevolence; these take O Son As tempests; blight in corn; raw chills of wind, And earthquakes; hard and burdensome to bear, But in the course of things ofttimes irks more Opposing than to loftily endure. Decrees of Fate outspoken by the Gods, What mortal dares gainsay? When Egypt old, Unglutted from her gorge of swallowed states, Rapacious still, sailed with a fleet of war On Cyprus to engulph us with the rest; The King and Rulers by a weight of votes Assigned your Father the command in chief To give their visit welcome. Slighting not Old Egypt's power so dread and imminent, He made disposal of the Island force, No breathing time of loss. Piously then To great Athena's Temple went and prayed Whatever good the Gods would deign to grant, Of aid and guidance to maintain the state Against fierce Heathen who abhorred our Gods, And would their fanes abolish ruthlessly. He said that as a voice might sound in dreams, These words came to his soul. Await the foe Fast by the landing-place in part concealed. Your men rank close in shape of hollow wedge. A trusted Leader place at either horn. Yourself within the apex give command. Move swiftly to and fro on either side. Hold well aloof a strong force in reserve. The foe when dashed, his every charge repulsed, Signal your onset; charge with all your strength. The fairest death is death in victory, Gods love the Brave who fighting for them die. His head was bent in reverence when the sound Had ceased; but conscious was he of some touch That thrilled and ran throughout his brain like fire: Whereon he rose, his purpose luminous, His resolution fixed. When leave he took Of her, she said, more sweet his tenderness Than in the earliest yearning flush of love. Whatever might be his appointed fate It would be hers to know her sweetness made His life a blessing. Should the blade of war Cut short his thread, he bade her not bewail As he should fall obedient to the Gods, Man's highest privilege. That she would find The future of their Boy an ample world For love; forethought; and fortitude to bear Changes inevitably born of growth. And should she grace him in her memory As cenotaph he wished their Son be taught His Father's deep immeasurable love. Then in his arms he took her silently, Both rapt in feelings that could not be told While Time pulled in his rapid steeds and paused. When low the sun flashed light in mighty beams Clouding in glory the Olympian Gods High placed for worshipping and household Guards, The sigh he gave seemed drawn from Hades' depths By one permitted for a task to breathe Our upper world; holding her head between His hands, he kissed her brow and wetted eyes, Then sharply turned away. On either side Without, the Maidens, servants, crowding slaves, Ranged to behold him leave. Each Maiden's hand He lifting courteously kissed; then bowed His kingly head to all around and went. She watched him up the rutted chariot way, Till he had reached where Temple columns closed The view: when, turning round his spear he raised And twirled it in an airy circle, as If greeting her with triumph; thus, she hoped, He went not sad at heart to meet his fate: She knew he tried to make her think him glad. When back were beaten Egypt's smirking hordes In flight confused rushing to reach their ships; Pointing the chase, your Father, strides advanced Beyond his warriors, neared so fast the shore, Drew on himself a concentrated shower Of arrows aimed to cover the retreat, And, as the Oracle foreshadowed, fell. They would not let me see his lifeless form, So marred and mangled by the volleyed death. But after rite and ceremony fit All that was left of my own honoured Lord A brazen vase contained: a pinch of dust, Fragments of calcined bones, and memory. The nation's victory was overcast And saddened by their Chiefs untimely close. The King bewailed him as a dearest son Who might awhile have shared his throne, and borne Hereafter the whole burden. Such the trust His nature bred. Here sitting with your hands In mine; feeling their hard and massive size; And interlaced these boughs above our heads Thro' whose selfsame intricacies we watched Stars lighting their illimitable world, I feel almost as if I yet held his. But O my son, tho' you have been to me More than your Father or myself could hope, Not even you could fairly equal him. There was such reverence in his courtesy Acceptance seemed conferring privilege, So graciously he owned acknowledgment. And all his kindly acts came in the course Of nature; not as efforts meant to please: And gratitude awakened glad surprise That life so teemed in blossoming delights. His courage; wisdom; and his fortune he Held but as trusts the state might call upon, And not as private rights to sacrifice. Therefore the King and Best exampled him As worthy for their sons to imitate. You are, Pygmalion, flawed with moodiness; Strange spells of absence from the world, as though You dreamed in daytime while the limbs perform Unerringly. Sometimes I fear mayhap Wanting a Father's firm control, who would Nip freakish shoots and regulate increase, Have left to wander wildly tendencies That might have flourished to a kindlier crop. To hear my Father praised, and thus, by you O dearest Mother, gives me sure foretaste Of what the Oracle so surely told: For never heretofore have I rejoiced With such a full and bounding throb of pride As now you tell of his heroic death, Saving the state, commanded by the Gods, Slain, but not conquered. For such men as he Ride on the wings of Victory; or they Enter the gates of Death as Conquerors, Invincible in life. In these strange moods Sometimes I feel the Gods hold me in thrall Disclosing laws larger than govern states. Of truth's eternity: the accident Of time; the nothingness of space; the force Of pure resolve. The fate of reckless ones Who disregard their signs and oracles, And omen pregnant with their wills sublime. My heart were pained, O mother, could I think In common paths my duty halted lame. But dare I plod blind and unheedingly When light immortal opens on my sight? The light of stars in his rapt lustrous eyes. His tenderness; even poor slaves his care Protected often from deserved mishap. The fire of strength, his resolution swift! Thus mused the Matron; hands still clasping his, Remembering his skill in warlike arts; Severe devotion to his godlike work; She owned, although strangely dissimilar From her great Husband's constancy of worth, Not less, but other was Pygmalion. BOOK VI. Relax Orsines, your left arm relax: In that which holds the spear I want your strength. If this you tighten you draw force from that; And Dionysus meant a deadly wound When pointing steel at grim Lycurgus King; Compel your strength where strength will best avail. So spoke Pygmalion to his willing friend Who stood as Dionysus. Light his love For sculptured forms and mimicry on walls; But as a graybeard with a favourite child For love will join his pastimes and pursuits, That otherwise were moil and weariness, Orsines loved to posture God or man Aiding Pygmalion's service to the Gods. Thus on they toiled thro' many a summer morn: One's ardour warming to lay hold and show That force the other did his best to give. One day they argued on the people's press For power, which turned against them to their bane Unguided by the Best. How wantonly Their abject faith in mouthing demagogues Noised empty phrases into oracles, And gave base maxims vogue by utterance. Orsines thought these bubbles might be touched By spear and sword with profit to the state. To cut off thistles ere they flower and seed Saved wasting soil and spared the labourer. Nay, nay, Orsines, you a warrior trained By daily exercise in warlike feats Tend to resolve all tangles by the stroke Of steel. But steel, O friend, will scarce suppress A rising tide; or backward push the sun Because forsooth his beams too fiercely burn! Against the tide we must protect our shores By driven piles; and stones in sloping walls; And quays of solid strength. Then tides become The servants of our greatness, bearing ships Exultingly to conquest; or in peace Enriching us by gathered merchandise. We must not throw sharp sand against the wind. No; we must strive to guide not stay this growth; For tho' we are in our high state the flowers, The people are the mighty stem whereon We live and grow; or perish if cut off. Orsines thought Pygmalion must hit true As, tho' in arms by far his overmatch, He beat him worse in words and arguments; And meekly prudent ventured no reply. Pygmalion asked what did Orsines think; Would lengthening our bows by one good span Increase the force within the men's control? Orsines said the attempt were dangerous. The men might hold the force well in command, And aim as truly as at shorter range; But if attacking over greater space, With sword and spear, their breath might fail before The close, and profit thus the waiting foe. Ianthe, radiant, entered while he spoke, With wine; and bread; and fruit; these placing by She said, May I pour wine for you my Lord Orsines? Rough and simple warrior he Would take of wine, yea verily he would. And as she offered him the well-filled cup He reddened to the roots of his black curls Vowing he fain would pour for her instead. A strangely ordered Ganymede would you Make my Orsines with your knotted beard And hands of sinewy grip. Old stories say Hephaestus once poured nectar for the Gods, And made Olympus with such laughter shake The wrath of Zeus in thunder scarce had made A greater uproar. But of Ares yet I have not heard he so amused their feast. Orsines said that maids so often poured, And tended on the wants of men, that men Might change at times and tend upon the maids. Ianthe looked amazed at words so sleek From Chief so rough. Pygmalion laughing cried It is our Island's lack of war that tames Orsines into peaceful courtesies. Both gazed upon Ianthe as she moved Across the chamber to the doorway where Beyond the day was shining bright and still. When, while her figure moved dark and defined Against the outside glare, both inwardly Felt there was something yet more fair than light. Orsines told Pygmalion how alway His Mother, older and in lassitude Beyond Time's warrant, urged him constantly, In mild pathetic plaint, that he would bring Her home a daughter to her loneliness, As she had never since my Father fell, The day your own great Father met his fate, Much mingled with the cheerful world without. She yearns for children's laughter in the house; Her breast is dry for longing. Pattering feet Would be as music to her heart. The clasp Of tender little fingers; kisses soft That baby lips give sweetly, as the prankt Delicious honeysuckle utters sweets To every wandering zephyr that demands, Her pent-up desolation would, she says, Release in new-born joy of young delights, And she again partake of blessed life. How comes it my Orsines you so fail Fulfilling her such reasonable hopes? It comes Pygmalion from the hindering fact That though I have seen many noble maids Too good and fair for my rude warrior ways, Yet have I not seen one who strikes my soul With sense of possibility that I Could pass untired with her my lifelong course Till now; when suddenly, as I saw her, Ianthe, asking should she pour for me I felt I could for ever with her dwell And she would be my home. Therefore, as you Are Lord and Guardian of her fate, I ask Permission to declare my suit, and take, If graciously received, the Maiden home To cheer my Mother with delightful hopes. What ails Pygmalion? You are deadly pale. Your hand is on your heart! I know not what: The heat, maybe; but as you spoke there came A dagger in my heart that cut in twain Its very substance, so it seemed to me For one brief momentary hell. Tho' now The pain is loosening slowly and I feel Blood throbbing in my veins. The Oracle Of Aphrodite claimed full recompense For some strange good to come, and now, perchance Payment begins in pain. This large request Of yours somewhat astounds by suddenness. My judgment must be calm and cool; I must Consult my Mother's will; the Maiden's self And her own wishes must be sacred held. These must be known and weighed before I durst Give even my Orsines promise fair, Or aid to gain the splendid prize he craves. The Maidens and my Mother are so bound Together, that to pluck one from their midst Will seem to them like pulling down their home In wreck and ruin. But ever on creeps Time, Or stalks with giant strides. Those cherished most Leave us to shape their destinies, maybe By us seen never more. Or we leave them Driven by passionless Necessity. To-morrow ere the sun has set expect Me at your house with message of your fate. Lonely and sad Pygmalion left his work To pace the solitary strand, where wave Incessantly repeating wave soothed him With movement in monotony. The shriek Of wild sea-fowl passing athwart the blue Cried of some unborn sorrow yet to rise And pierce his life with helpless agony. How came it Gods made mortal future dark, Unshielded, blind against the ills to come? We know our aspirations: who can tell If ever one will have the wings to fly And reach attainment in the living day! We grope, and dream of light, as moths are heard Tapping and scraping in the chrysalis To gain the outer air. And gained, what then? Came to Pygmalion's memory when a child He heard a moth scrape at his prison-walls With energy unflagging. Worn, at length The side began to tremble to and fro, Scarcely a film, which the small creature burst And struggling out, all moist and crumpled, clung To his sometime tomb. Motionless awhile The warm air dried his wings, to gorgeous hues Expanded: these for a time he fluttered, Then half an arm's length rose, and wavered back. This did he thrice, then paused. Last, gallantly, In power complete and noble sweep uprose; But reached not more than half the tree's height ere A darting bird from out the branches seized, And gorged him in mid air. This pirate, too, Had ears and eyes in watching for his prey, Whose first flight from his dusky prison-house Was to his grave in that rapacious maw. BOOK VII. Breathe, O breathe, ye perfumed lilies, Worshipping great Aphrodite! Shout and sing, O nightingales, Giving voice to Aphrodite! Her's the power that binds his breath When the lover's accents fail! Thus chanted troop of girls at morningtide, As towards the Temple they, with roses piled On baskets, went to worship Cytherea In loosely ordered march. Some on their heads; At arms' length some; and some resting on hips Their baskets bore; while other loads so large Took two young girls to carry one between. In strange perplexity Pygmalion heard The chanting girls, as he was passing near. The chant seemed but the echoed Oracle; And he, bewildered, wondered if in dreams The sound had mixed; or had divinely come From Aphrodite as the voice of Fate. Would ever Hebe bring the fire from heaven? Should he the Treasure find, and foul despite Crawl withering on his track like pestilence? But after much vain thought and wandering, Seeing by shadows' fall and city signs It lacked but one good easy hour of noon, He loitered homeward on Orsines' suit. True to her time Ianthe entering Saw Lord Pygmalion not at work; instead, Pacing with silent footfall to and fro The spacious floor. She placed the food and wine, And moved towards the doorway, when he called Bidding her stay; I, maiden, must perform A task, a duty; right it may be called. I want your keenest ear; it may be fate. He was abrupt; his words were harsh; noring, Or gentle intonation in his voice. Ianthe felt a dull cloud on her soul That shadowed her without significance, And stood in silence waiting. He began, Orsines tells me that he loves you well, And ask'd my aid to make his wishes known. His Mother wants a daughter, he a wife, And you, he hopes, may fill the wants of both. My promise was that I would lay his wish Before you and my Mother; you to choose. What say you, Maiden? I wish not to wed. Orsines is of birth high as your own. Before our Island merged its petty Kings In one great Kingship, reigned his ancestors, Ruling a vast and fertile stretch of land. Birth would not tempt a Maid. And lineage high Maidens of lineage take by right, as they Take food and air; but not as privilege. But my Orsines, he is brave beyond Most men. He blithely would give play to three And beat them off with loss. Brave men are brave In nature's course, not brave for us alone. A bull mightily guarding cows in mead, Show him another bull, or garment red, And judge if he is scant of bravery. Loose on him leash of dogs from Ithaca, Behold if they that quality will lack! Once when your Father watched his woodmen fell A blasted oak that sucked up nourishment And darkened out the sun from ripening vines; Was heard a crash, a torrent-roaring rush, From which a monstrous boar, aflame with eyes And gleaming tusks, and bristling horrent light, Made towards them down the slope. Swift as a bird's Wingbeat, your Father fronted him and poised, While, as the horror furiously charged, He, swerving, just escaped with graze on hip; Then with a woodman's axe, in both hands clenched, He stood astride awaiting the return. But when the baffled monster checked his course And raging plunged to make the charge again, Your Father, with unerring mighty stroke, Drove in the blade between his fiery eyes And slew him with one blow. Such bravery The man exalts: prompt adjunct to his will; His sacrifice; and readiness to foil The possibilities of dark mischance! Maiden, your thoughts are wise and truly spoke; And he, Orsines, mates those lofty words. Young maidens must not flinch; they owe the state Some service; wed they must to rear up sons For work and war, and daughters to delight. A Maiden does not cast so far before, And such concernings leaves in Hera's charge. Hurt am I Lord, in being followed close From point to point by chasing arguments; Thus made to turn and double like a hare Before remorseless hounds, to save myself. Pygmalion was appalled. Ianthe hurt! That were indeed disgrace and wrong, he sighed. Gazing he looked so woebegone, so lost, The Maiden's soul was smitten: mournfully She spoke; Pardon, my Lord; I would not wound You in return because you wounded me. But Maidens are not made to love against Their natures. Arguments can never change A hawk to meekness, or inspire the dove With lust of rapine on the feathered race. I have no thoughts of wedlock. When I wed My love must come as worship; not for one Whose character and worth may be defined And read like any act of daily life. Divinest sympathies are pre-ordained By some eternal Power we wot not of; And should we violate their sanctity We sink to lower state: our happiness Curdles to self-contempt, and we are slaves. Unversed am I in loves and marriages, Having no Mother, Brother, Sister, Sire, And knowing only your own Mother's love, And love of all her Maids. This know I sure, The man who wins a noble Maiden's soul Must noble be himself. Suffices not The dexterous use of bow and threatening spear; Nor staunchest loyalty to King and friends; My hero makes the region he commands The richer for his life, and dying leaves Open the path of his adventurous feet. For Godlike effort thus alone marks man From beasts, that eat their way thro' age to age Unvarying, each like each. Regard your own High, difficult, and stern, laborious art. What was it in the olden time when Greeks Content with blindly imitating forms, Limb-bound, and lifeless, of Egyptian Gods, For generations made no step beyond, Till Daedalus with new Promethean fire, Carving the stubborn blocks of wood and stone To limbs detached, gave to his images The air of will and motion! Rude, uncouth Theywere. But they had life, the breath of Gods! And to be truly man a man must be As Gods; to make, and to create, and live At one with nature. Happy he whose soul Aspires to dwell in that eternal calm Where knowledge sees confirmed results ere yet The fashioning hands have touched. His life becomes Akin with higher Powers; his spirit fit To stand before His throne and gaze on Zeus. Ianthe! O Ianthe! Treasure found! My Goddess! O my Dearest! Thou art She! Then at her feet he fell. She bending clasped His head close to her heart, as it had been A tender little babe: gazing abroad In terror mute. And when he spoke So strange the sound he knew not his own voice; And felt removed into another world, As he some other was. Soon rising, he Took her two hands and stood removed the length Of both their arms; and on her countenance Now wet with tears, stared hard in wonderment. Then lifting up his heart, that until now Had been a weight of pain, he spoke to her: How have I been, O loved Ianthe, blind! The longed-for ripe perfection of my life Here manifest before me day by day Between the dawning and the setting sun! And I from circumstance, not wilfulness, O well may you believe, have seen it not! But having found the Resting-place of this My anxious self I will not wander more. My Hebe, my most loved One; I beheld Now, when you saw Olympian Zeus enthroned, And happy spirit gazing on His power, Again the look divine I saw before, And dreaded was the fragment of a dream I never more might see! Do you in truth, In very truth, your Maid Ianthe love? And do you feel that she can give you joy Thro' lifelong changes to gray fall of age? Or is it your wild rapture at some grace Discerned in me that may advance your work Makes you thus utter such bewildering words? Ianthe; should the Gods of heaven combine And offer make me of an added charm For you, in stature, strength, or loveliness, Or some sweet witchery I know not of, So much I love you I should ask the Gods To leave you perfect as I see you now. The Maiden cried, Now my Pygmalion, I Know that you love me! As she spoke she fell Like a spent fountain at Pygmalion's feet. Sweetness and tenderness the words he spoke To her held lifted in his powerful arms, And as he bent to kiss her drooping mouth He saw the glow of one white pouting breast Rose pointed, proud, with glimmering azure laced, Too fair for touch or even mortal glance, While holding her within his arms he sighed And whispered low love's immemorial tale, To her attention tranced; he saw the pure Pale countenance deepen in colour till Her beauty glowed a rose in perfect flower; And splendour like a garment covered her. Now burnt the dark gray eyes of dawn in full Meridian glory: Lustrous flashes flew, And pierced his heart throbbing tumultuously Like a thing captive by the hunter struck. Herself releasing softly from his hold She went and stood upon the platform where So often she had postured for her Lord, And, no way conscious, she the attitude Of Hebe took, asked should the statue be Smitten to life; should Athens, and should all Proclaim him the first Maker of the world, At such a time would he not feel it rash To have her taken for his wedded wife Ere his pride knew the swell of victory? Ianthe, I have faith in Aphrodite. The Treasure have I found; the Life will come. Light effort now carving the lines that fire The marble into passion, brand the thought; I see them now clear and determinate. You hold the fire; I see the glory burn! Should every State of Greece, with Athens proud To head them, crown me King of our whole race: Should all the Gods in conclave ratify, And after make me an Olympian God, No other would I love, none take but you. Now to my Mother; I will tell her Fate Has crowned me with the diadem of joy. His left around her waist, his right hand held Both hers; they proudly thro' the doorway went Along the curving path: their stately forms More seeming demigods than man and maid On this our common earth. They overpassed Where once she saw within the doorway shade The Lord Pygmalion stand regarding her. The memory of that delightfulness; That unfamiliar music in her heart; Again she lost her feet, and saw herself In bygone solitude with Echo nymph, With Dido, Ariadne, and Medea. When they had reached the chamber where the Maids At various tasks around the Matron toiled, Pygmalion cried aloud, O mother, I Have found her! Hebe She is come to life! The Matron and the noble throng as one Cried in amaze. Your Hebe come to life! The palace slaves and servants standing by Cried in amaze His Hebe come to life! Forgetful of respect some left in haste With arms high-spread proclaimed the wonderful. The city loiterers always agape For new births, shaped, or shapeless, as may be, Rehearsed the cry, till some declared they saw, Or knew some who had seen, in clouds of fire, The Goddess Aphrodite pass into Pygmalion's chamber. But what there took place None but himself and the dread Goddess knew. But certain was it that the Statue walked Straightway from his workchamber to the house, Pygmalion's arms bound fast about her waist: For all the noble Maidens saw; and saw The servants and the palace slaves, and cried All with one voice Your Hebe come to life! Also for certain the great Matron cried, O Hebe! O Ianthe! Am I mad! And fell down in their arms, and likely dead. BOOK VIII. The disk of Hyperion barely stands At span above the ocean line; I must Haste to Orsines and report his fate. In calm Ianthe's charge Pygmalion left His Mother resting. She had been distraught In her amazement when Pygmalion came Godlike and beaming with Ianthe, red In newborn radiant love, crying aloud Hebe had come to life! And all as one, Repeated Hebe, She is come to life! Amazement fled in joyfulness, when she Knew that Pygmalion and Ianthe loved, And suddenness closed sense with its excess. Soon came the light back to her happy eyes; The blood again soon pulsed in pleasantness, Under the Maidens' and Ianthe's care. Hail, hail, Pygmalion! You are light of step. The firm exactness of your tread speaks power That would us mortals hold at high command! Say not so, my Orsines. Sad the tale For you I have to tell. Ianthe loves Not you but me. Instead of gift divine, Fiat of loss I bring, and baulked desire. Look not so dolorous, Pygmalion. The loves of maidens are like scents of flowers, In giving forth their sweetness each complete. If the tall lily scorn to gathered be, The drooping jessamine perchance may shower Her stars upon me bright and odorous. Stain not that lovely face with tears. Believe Me when I say more proud am I that thou Pygmalion, Maker of great Gods; strong Lord Of bow, and spear; warcraft, and ancient lore, Shouldst make the peerless One, Ianthe, Wife, Than had she willing come unto these arms. To whisper in your friendly ear, I was Half frightened of success. I feared that she Were far too strong for my poor hands to hold, And winged for regions I could never make. Noble Orsines, from my heart you ease A pain I feel had wrung your own to know. Some other where and when, not now, I will In parcel tell how I my Treasure found. But O my well-loved brother, I am grieved That joy like mine should not be joy of yours, And that for you there is no Resting-place. I hold it savours of discourtesy To shoot conjecture through a maid's reserve; As though her secrets were but things of chase, Untended, game for any venturous shaft. But what to wantonness devoid of weight Should be forbidden, to the Guardian lies An open path; not only charged with right Of entrance, but with need to act and serve Her, who perforce, must helpless be herself. You know I love my Mother's noble Maids Each one and all as they my sisters were: But one so tender, and so young, so meek In her wild timid ways, mayhap I love Above the rest; and she I think loves you. The visage of Orsines now turned pale; And eagerly he forward bent to hear. Eos the tender, we the Maiden call, Of great blue timid eyes. Pygmalion! Say You do not fool me with these precious words! O Eos, loved One! O my Soul on Earth! Long, long ago, my dearest Heaven-sent friend, I thought I loved young Eos. Ever shy She seemed of my rough presence; in the house, Or in the myrtle walks, and Temple Feasts. I felt but a shagged mountain bear that strove To woo a great-eyed fawn, or shining swan. Resolved I would not fright, or be her bane, I closed my heart against her once for all. Till now I have not swerved from my resolve, Thinking my ancient interest in her dead: But now! O now! And may I hope to win? Orsines, you will win. But hearken first: I almost grudge that even Orsines should Command the tender Eos. Few who live Can know in her the depth of tenderness! So daintily attuned, that instrument Responds in music to the faintest breeze; While harshness would distract the chords and make A jangle of her nature. Gentle be Your touch of her Orsines! Low and soft Your voice and words; your meaning ever kind. Then in your household will be light and flowers, And a sweet bird singing throughout the day. Orsines' head sank in Pygmalion's neck, Long there he wept for very, very love. Now with a certainty untroubled wrought Pygmalion on his Hebe. Great his joy To raise the wonder in her brows. To make The shadows dark within her upward eyes: In those fine nostrils breathing purity. Pressing the mouth to longer droop of curves Above the prow of her imperial chin. These now in his fierce energy were but As trifles. Chisel edge could scarcely touch Ere the obstruction vanished as a cloud. Yea, yea, he cried, the bowl divine should be More firmly pressed; for risk there must be none Of waste in shaking the Olympian cup! More tightly bound the joints; the dimpling be Less spacious and more softly widened forth. Aglaia, she was right; throughout the lengths Of the grand limbs perfection closer yet Must I effect ere they afford the grace Of Hebe or Ianthe. The long sway Will suavely come in lightening her waist Both on the outward curve and inner line. This knee! In fineness dare I venture more? The heartshape of the cap: ah! just a shade! Yes! Even a daughter and a Goddess feels Something of tremulous in face of Zeus; Therefore this foot more pressure must admit, As witnessing ethereal power that warms And animates the whole immortal form Of God obedient to the Thunderer's will. Pygmalion's statue was completed, and Crito, his own and Father's ancient friend Came to demand the statue might be shown Unasked for to the people as a boon. Pygmalion cared not, he indifferent was. Ianthe, who with Crito entered, said Nowise indifferent, my Lord, art thou. The matter has not fairly caught thy mind And claimed attention due. Thyself hast said That men who do not show their works when done Are either conscious of their worthlessness, Or treat with traitorous scorn their fellow men. For they assuredly stand traitors stark, Refusing thus their miserable best To their nativity and kindred race. Lofty Ianthe! Crito cried; entranced Am I to hear you strike heroic chord. Our noblest dames too often hold their part Enough to safely move on footworn ways. Curbing adventurous sally in their Lords. Not thus, Pygmalion knows, is our great world Made greater. Not by smiling effort down; Or wailing when her Lord takes spear and shield To slaughter lions, boars, and savage beasts That rage and ravage to the herdsmen's loss, Wasting the country's wealth; or meets his foes To save her lovely self from slavery. True words are thine, Lord Crito! I have heard Pygmalion ask what rank would ours be now Had Orpheus never sung his songs divine. For he, King of the living Lyre, and Song, Opened with music our astonished sight: He put amazement in our souls to know The life in rocks; the spirit in each tree; The sweetness in the flowers themselves enjoyed. He made the waters bound in frolic mirth, Or calmly flow contentedly to sea: The storm-entangled forests lash their limbs And roar in stern triumphant harmony. We are awake; we are no longer dead! Taught us, confiding brutes we kill to eat, Own gratefully the strokes of gentleness. That when the wild birds peck from infant hands Affection more than want entices them. He sung that man slaying his brother man To sate the bite of individual wrath Was murder; and for others' safety he Who slays is banished, or tastes death himself. Men were but brutes until Prometheus gave Them fire from heaven. But when they metals used, And baked their corn, and made their dwellings firm; How were they more than brutes save in the strength Of hardened points, and many bound as one; Till Orpheus sung them into sympathy With forest flowers and lisping forest leaves: With following creatures, that as helpful lords Regarded men who reared them for their use? Fitting it was the nightingale should sing Above his grave who sang so sweetly here. Who sang wild man to worshipping the Gods, The dread of Hades, and the pangs of crime! Pygmalion said there was no longer doubt The statue must be shown, but when and where? He would not have an ever babbling stream Disturb his working hours throughout the day. What says our Crito, wisest Cyprian Lord? Your chambers then are closed against the crowd. Meseems Ianthe has first privilege: The statue is of her, whose judgment sound Will sift the circumstance and find the place. Ianthe challenged thus pronounced its doom. As I was the unconscious cause my Lord Began the Statue: and as day by day I gave him my best aid in posturing: And when we had our best done that he failed; And that responsive to his pious prayer The Goddess Aphrodite promised gift Of life; that, not till then, could he make clear The vision in his soul; it seems to me My Lord's relation and my own the same. Nor he nor I have in the statue right But as the ministers of higher Power. And therefore I, Ianthe, now pronounce The Statue be with ceremony fit A sacred offering to the Goddess made, And placed within her Temple for all time! O blessed Ianthe my soul goes with thine! Pygmalion cried; and Crito, pleased his word Had borne a perfect blossom sweet to each, With utmost reverence he dared believe That Aphrodite through Ianthe spoke. BOOK IX. Dreams are not always dreams as understood. Fore-runners often they: first strivings dim To handle things yet formless, or unknown. While thus our souls full on adventure bound Wing to encompass untried regions, new; Encountering Fiends opposed; or graciously Led by sweet Spirits safe to golden heights; Our bodies lie as fast asleep, or dead. But not the will, that beats at strongest flight! You did not dream Pygmalion: your soul heard The song of Nature sung; the kindling truths Told by the Goddess. We are instruments Selected to convey the Gods' behests, They play us as they please. This Crito told Pygmalion as they with Orsines marched Processional, to offer thanksgiving To Aphrodite for her mercies shown: The newborn life; the love She had vouchsafed; And in Her Temple had his work allowed. The Matron Mother next; on either side Were Eos and Ianthe. Paired, the rest Of noble Maidens came. Them following A host of palace servants, each of whom Held myrtle sprig or the red rose in hand. Brightening each side the march a line of girls Kept paces with them, chanting songs of praise To Her, their Queen of love and loveliness. Flanking the Temple steps, behind the Priests And Temple Guardians, stood in double lines A hundred warriors on each side; their spears And burnished shields two living streams of light That awed the dazzled multitude, agape With admiration. Far beyond these lines Were seen the crowds; their heads astir they looked Like plains of ragged growth moved by the wind; But noiseless, save for buzz and murmuring hum, Expecting some deep mystery disclosed. When all the Temple entered, to the last Whose claims the Priests allowed, and doors were closed, Bursting the noontide silence rose a cry Whose shivering echoes struck the city walls, Startling far women at their spinning wheels With wonder if an earthquake were afoot! While sucklings dropt their mothers' breasts to cry. Hail Lord Pygmalion whom our Goddess loves, And brought for love his statue into life! Hail to the Matron and her noble Maids! And hail ye Warriors who do honour him! And hail again, to Aphrodite, Hail! Thus the great populace approval voiced, Proud that Pygmalion's triumph was their own. When in the sacred walls had been performed Each ceremony and observance due The march went homeward. Now broke up the crowd As stirred their various wills. Their daily tasks Hurried some off at speed. While others lounged At ease on Temple steps and drank the sun. Mostly they clung in groups. Rank and bemired Some idlers from warm wallowing indolence, By fits and starts grunted of this or that. Pleased to vent ignorance of things august, Some discussed hotly; others prophesied That henceforth statues all would come to life! Was this a prodigy for once and all? If made to live would price of statues rise? What all would come to Gods alone could say! Garrulous, and by smug listeners girt, there sat One of the dark deposits seething vice Precipitates from scum in swarming towns. A shape most like a blasted trunk, whose limbs Are withered boughs: the only brute life shown One yellow tooth, and two red glittering eyes. She, unto one, a citizen, his bulk Far wider round by measure than his height; His jowl from chin hung larger than his cheeks: Small nose and eyes and wide capacious mouth. Aye, aye, the Best; we know what means the Best. Eating best meat; drinking best drink; best clothes To spoil; the best made by hardworking hands! This is the Best they wot of. In what else The Best, it passes me to know; and I Have age upon me and I ought to know! At this protested blandly, he so round. They have their merits, as of course defects; They buy of us and we sound profits make. Let us not quarrel with our meals; but eat All we can get, then look about for more. No, no, the Best I cannot wholly hate. The fell tree-trunk declared that hate to her Was what she breathed: she hated all the Best. Look at this Lord Pygmalion! Was he oaf, Or sleek time-server? He, the Temple, that Could well afford to buy, his statue gave: Spoiling the statue market, these rich Lords! Who ever knew the Priests to buy if they Could sate their wants without? Was it to hush The crime? For all know what he did. Ha! Ha! Prayed Aphrodite give his statue life! The life he gave was blood. He stabbed the maid Who loved him: and he mixed her blood with clay, And with that clay he made his statue live. Prayed Aphrodite! Aphrodite knows More natural ways of making shapely maids Than killing maids to mix their blood with clay. Roundness remarked it was not well to rail Too boldly at the Best: scoffs might by chance Bounce to their ears: they might think well to shift Their purchases and other purses fill; A change too horrible! Let well alone; Let well alone say I; for thrive I do And grow the bigger for it as you see. Look at Pygmalion and Orsines; large Most true, and tall; but bones compared with me! With that, self-satisfied, his Roundness swagged From side to side, like vessel over-poised, Cargo too heavy and too scant of keel, And swagging swayed himself lost in the crowd. Meanwhile the vulture in that blasted trunk Clutching thin air her scorching hatred barked. Behold young Bacis, my own daughter's son. She was well shapen till one of these Best Fathered her boy: like Ariadne then She took drink comfort in our island wine, And grew bloat, dull, and purple. He, the Best, Gave us the gold King-likenesses we loved. But when cursed steel let out his life in war Our fountain dried: we did the best we could. She did her best; but bloat and purple red Draw young men less than whiteness, strength, and shape. Discomfited with failure, more she drank; Swelled larger daily; caught the plague, and died. Young Bacis left, my withered shoulders bore The luckless load. Bright as a fox that boy. Fox his sharp features; fox his peering ways. Many good meals he brought me, tho' where got, Like a true fox my foxey would not tell. He would have grown a lion would that fox, For get he would, somehow; would get and save; When having saved and scraped a heap of wealth, What is he but a lion among men! This sneak; this sleek Pygmalion what did he? He took him from his gutter playfellows; Sent him straightway to school: there had him taught The statue-making, as he had a gift, They called it! Foxey sharpness, with the eyes To see what safely may be snatched, a gift! Blind, blind these Best; as blind as we are bright. Shame, shame, the listening Chorus cried, to take Him from his gutter playfellows to school! To make a statue-maker of a boy Who might have saved and scraped a heap of wealth! Inspired by choral sympathy, the fowl, The dry gray fowl barked more from blasted tree. And when my fox's sharpness learned the art, Outstripping all the elders; what was done By this my Lord Pygmalion called of Best! Much wanted he, the boy, to make a strip, A narrow strip of wall, with figures cut Thin, flat, and laid along its utmost length. No toil could ever make him lag fatigued. Sheepskins he took, scoured bright and clean; these stretched He tight and firm on frames, then drew the forms Of men and maidens going to sacrifice On horses, in proud chariots, and on foot. In one part was a Fury marked; the fox Made my face into hers! This world! this world! This plan was shown the Priests. A word from him, Pygmalion, would have given my boy the work. But did he give that word? I tell you, No! Lip-gnawing jealousy, cold rankling there, Would not allow a spawn of gutter drab To brave it with the Best. Panting, she paused. Shame, shame it was, the Chorus cried, to stop The spawn of gutter drab from beating Best! Then! what did Bacis do? He sank adown From greatness he had never reached, because That jealous Titan blocked his proper path. O gold and purple that he might have won! O brazen chariot, and O sweetest wines! O maiden with the wealth he might have wed! And now what does he do? Makes little gods For dwelling-houses where the pay is small. So I, instead of wearing linen fine, Bordered with flowers in hue and threads of gold; And having slaves to watch my every wish, Must spin and drudge; or beg and steal and drudge. Thus midden-heated, hatched the festering lies That bred in multiplying swarms, and wove A cloud of hatred round Pygmalion's name. Some fat and full-blown, dashed with strains of truth, Catching to careless glance, and shallowness. Some crawled the dust intent; by wriggling hard Fixed themselves tight in unexpecting ears. Others winged-born, and swift, in hovering buzz Sought places from the rubs of life worn bare To strike their pitiless and poisonous stings. Pygmalion, who unwitting this dark web, Fine-meshed, far-reaching, was around him wrought, Began to wonder friends he loved right well Seemed shy or cold, or made abrupt replies To common questionings of daily life. Still passed them lightly by for fancies bred Of over-charged endurance, such as his Had lately been. But when recurrence made An evil meaning hideously bare, He could no longer doubt an origin For this estranged affection. Clear survey Then taking of past years and latter days, He saw no conscious act or circumstance In which he had been part could fairly raise A coarse antagonism edging on Malevolence. Distrust but once aroused, The lightning from a cloud no swifter went, Nor straighter, nor more certainly than he To his determined aim, now fixed to track The mischief to the midden whence it sprung. BOOK X. Well timed, Pygmalion, is your coming here! I wanted some clear judgment on this shield. First note the size is larger than prevails; Centre more raised, while smoothly at the rim Returning forward in a gentle curve. Now, you will ask, O Crito, why this change? And my reply is what these eyes have seen. In many a stubborn contest; arrows sharp, And mightily thrown spears, have glinted off And struck the men behind, sometimes to death. Whereas this curve would check the shafts so they Fell harmless, or at worst would swerve length-wise And strike those near; but blow from staff of ash Is unlike prick of steel. Fair on its face Your new device, and fair the arguments: But why allow so many seasons pass Ere you, O Crito, brought your shield to proof? My reasons are but these. In battle's crash We scarcely heed a thousand things we see, So grimly set on holding to our lives, And taking those opposed. The fighting done, The other thousand things we have to do Leave scanty time for memories. At length, When order reassumes authority, And we ourselves can give to our affairs, Instead of wandering in the past, we find The present swallows up our energies Healing the gaps in fortune; or by use Of fortune's favours we have gained by war. But when a man is old, and knows his time Now short among his fellows, comes to him Desire to do some service ere he die. And in this sunset of my life old friends In arms, dim shades of ancient long-ago, Come thronging, faces pale, regarding me; And one slain by a spear glanced from my shield Brought this device to mind. And now I hope This may save others in the years to come. But stay: Pygmalion does not look himself: Your eyes move restlessly; your face is pale: Safe the great Matron's and Ianthe's health? At those loved names a ray of pleasantness Lighted his countenance as he replied: Of pure and perfect health as birds in song But I am somewhat troubled by cold smiles, Or no smiles, and coarse scowls instead; but why And wherefore nought can tell. Friends I thought kind, Who hitherto responded graciously To courtesies of mine, now darkly smirk; Or mince the countenance to acrid stare; Or standing by forget Pygmalion lives. Another passing drops his face on breast Plunged in profoundest thought; whose thought erewhile Had never risen beyond his sandal strings. And twos will talk of things above my head As if too high for me to understand. Or if I question some give half replies And start away on sudden business bound. Others in laughing converse, when I near, Cease, and compose their masks to unconcern. While much of this I have for long observed, And passed it by as fancy, or as chance; But now at length I know there must be root And widely spread to grow such evil fruit Of rudeness, spite, and hate, so come to you, My wisest and most ancient friend, for help To dig this mandrake from its hold and find The planter, and to what his purpose trends. Pygmalion, no hot-brained witling you! Quick of offence, and ready to resent: But calm and equable in intercourse; Less willing to reprove than take reproof: And gentle often when you might be stern With reasonable profit to your state: Therefore, maintaining justice of your plaint, I know some mischief-workers must have sown What bear these Protean discourtesies. Some rumours have I heard the statue men Are disconcerted by unseemly fears Their markets may be broken up and closed Should this new art of making statues live Kindle the people to demand of them Like statues they would dread to undertake. These rumours until now I flouted off As meaningless; vagaries ever rife When any new thing fires the populace. My business now I make to search and probe This ulcer; nor will stop till I release The aggregated mischief; or discern Its nature and its cause immediate. I have a sister's son, an orphan now; No vice has he, but skittish as a colt; And, save in things of weight, heeds me no whit, In statue matters more especially. He drifted in and joined a knot of youths Fierce in archaic quaint proclivities; Brazen of speech, and truculent in stare On those infatuate, blind to Iris wings In dusty darkness; in hoar ignorance The wisdom and the wit! And age with them Must be far back indeed; for Daedalus They hold is far too free; his statues have Too much of motion for archaic truth; The only truth select ones care to know. Of this same sportive youth I will command He sift archaic friends, and make research To learn what this base comedy may mean. To-morrow, the next day, or after that, Should I not strike the vein before, I will Disturb Pygmalion at his God-making And open scroll of what I may collect. Farewell, dear Crito; with those calm clear eyes, With that experienced head, the matter must Be tangled beyond hope, and deftly hid That you cannot unravel and descry. One day; another; and another fled, Yet came no Crito to Pygmalion, Who, in the amber glow that warmed the fourth At sunset mused, The poision bags were found Harder to gather from the serpent fangs Than Crito had believed. He hoped his friend Would take no risk or insult in his zeal To serve his well-beloved friend's only son! So far had ambled on his thoughts when he Beheld Lord Crito and Orsines both Toward coming, Crito pale unwontedly. Taking the old man's hands, he asked How fares My Lord, he lacks his wonted calm? And I, Orsines, miss your customary cheer! Pygmalion, what I thought but clattering The wooden swords of youth in sportfulness, I find no boy's play now; but grip of steel And deadly hate. Murder is what they mean. Hate stealing on to murder: and for what? That you shall hear; and hearing have your mind Expanded by the knowledge you shall learn. This youth of mine, whom now I find not quite So innocent and simple as I thought, Needed but feather touching to entice His ugly secrets forth: for flippancy And vanity combined to flatter him He moved in matters of a high concern. It seems one Bacis with much care and pains Made a design to show the Priests how he Would run a frieze along their Temple walls: And all declare Pygmalion's influence Alone debarred the youth from just reward; Priests being favourable, Pygmalion not. They say that you keep haughtily aloof, Mixing at no time in their games and feasts. Likewise if one demand of you advice, You give it plainly with no view to please; Unheeding that a statue-maker lives As much by praise as food he takes in mouth. In like wise this same Hebe you have made Is some dark trick to serve the Mysteries. And monstrous praises Priests and populace Bestow on you belong of right to them. Should this new art of stratagem succeed, Inflaming people's taste with new disease, Where can they find a market for their work? They are not rich enough they say, to dare Murder young maidens and mix up their blood With clay, and thus to make their statues live! Blood! Blood! they say must be atoned in blood; The How, and When is silence; we shall see! When my glib youth had got thus far he stopped Dead short and blushed. I saw he went beyond Intention; from his loosened tongue had slipped What he had fain concealed. Then promptly I Forbade all future intercourse between Archaics and himself. To make secure I kept him to his chamber, guard at door: Where he will stay till our needs call him forth. None but a fool, or evil one will act On news enormous without aid of sure Supporting strength in proof. I thought: then went To seek this Bacis: found him squat amid A gruff and grisly set in close discourse. They ceased on seeing me, and with their eyes Scowled their inquiries wherefore had I come? As this was war I used my warlike arts; My youth, I told them wasted too much time, And hoped they would not harbour him, as I Had studies for my youth to learn that now Were all or part neglected. More of this To same effect. Then I began to note The statues there on stands, and works on walls. For all they cared my words might well have been The outside wind that blew. Lightly I passed To this new Hebe of Pygmalion, And lurid light so swiftly flew thro' all, I almost heard the flashing of their eyes, Showing how nearly lay the matter there. It might be chance, but I young Bacis saw Fumble his sword-hilt lying close beside. Then, no preliminaries, all at once Began in rough loud tones to talk and shout Of nothing but the weather, fish, and ships; The costliness of wine with this last fail Of grape. I left them in a hot debate If vintage or corn harvest made most gold. Had Hades gaped and loosed her fiends, the cast Were less destestable than this foul reek Of midden heatedness and gutter slush! Lies are built up by liars pleasantly; They give their lies whatever form they please, But ugly always. On these shapes they stick In flagrant spots a few bright specks of truth. Forth wend the lies with maggot life endowed, And multiply with such amazing speed, Man's whole life from the cradle to the grave Is plagued by wingëd ones, or lies that crawl. And little as it takes to make a lie, That lie may take a man's lifetime to kill. Of this same Bacis I will tell the tale. Long since Orsines in athletic zest Seeking young athlete of some small renown, In quarters where our thieves and lowly dwell, Saw sitting cross-legged by the gutter side A sharp-eyed boy making men's heads in clay. Orsines thought he had unearthed a gem So rare it must be ground and fitly set To edify mankind. Orsines knew My faith in baseborns weak; but urged this gem Was an exception, proved my rule was true, For who before had known an ill-bred bird Hawking at statues, that belong to Gods! Fondly, reluctantly, I then agreed To buoy his ardent whim, and sent the lad Where best he might be taught the statue work. To those who know but little statue craft, Who are, my Crito, nearly all we know, His progress was a marvel. He by work Dexterously instinctive soon outran By rapid ways the rest. I tried to keep Him in the ancient paths with no avail; As I foresaw he could no higher rise Unless with broader base to build upon. As chances came in many ways I gave What help I could and thought he lived content. When on Athena's Temple Priests proposed To have some friezes carved, young Bacis sent Designs of mortals going to sacrifice, Which did not please them: but as Bacis said The Lord Pygmalion would be gratified Should they entrust him with their holy work The High Priest thought best ask of me direct. I could in no way sanction such a feat On any sacred fane. It was grotesque, Ridiculous. Maidens with hanging jaws Weak in the neck. Men of thin breasts and arms, But round the belly large; short in the legs. Throughout their lengths limbs almost of one size, Ignobleness impressed on every part. For this must Bacis not the least be blamed. He drew but what his eyes had mostly seen; Women so poor in blood their heads drop down; Showing the emptiest ignorance of life In beings fit to share the sacrifice. Men who lounge in the houses of their wares All day, no exercises, do perforce Grow unheroically stout. And he Having no inborn nobleness, or light To compensate original defects, And wanting also simple modesty To feel and conquer birth deficiencies, The end was such presentment as I say. To our chief potter I commended him Who cheerfully gave work of comic heads Fashioned to pots, and any odd device His fancy might invent, which products would Be taken in large numbers by the crowd; And thus appealing unto those he knew Them he would gladden and enrich himself. But guard the Gods I will from such as he. I who would consecrate estate and life To Gods could scarcely sacrifice the Gods To profit Bacis. Truly, Crito cried, His tale is told. All but Orsines know A fish on land is but an awkward beast. But fair to tell, when of these fishy freaks Orsines heard, he vowed him every chance To prove his fishy nature in the sea. Yes, and had done so had you not forbade! What mean these knaves that I mix in no games? I mix in every public game, and am One of the Chiefs; made one by better skill! That I should mix in little games and feasts Is the inanity of recklessness. Those who have nothing have the fewest cares; But I have vineyards, corn countries, and woods; Store-houses, quays, an active fleet of ships; All which, tho' I have trusty heads, demand Some thought of me, and that too, closely given. Without your statues I should say you had More than enough to keep the best at work. Orsines, no: the more we have to do Better we do it and more rapidly. The mind beats into higher pace and flies With less exertion winged at utmost speed. As to my giving plain advice when asked, I never treat these knaves but as I wish These knaves to treat me should I ask advice; And, save in fortune, which is luck of wheel, Had shrunk from holding one of them as less Than I myself am till I found them rogues. As to my praise, I utter all I can, And cannot lie even to flatter knaves. The dread their market may be spoiled by me Is needless fear, the foolish are with them. Regarding this blood murder business, that Might prove a sling in awkward slinger's fist. But loved Pygmalion make us promise you Will not walk public ways without your sword. Promise I make, let that content you both. BOOK XI. Pygmalion walking toward the Council Hall Where other two with him were pledged to choose A plan for its embellishment, his gaze Lay on the azure of a laughing sea, A sapphire ending shade-divided street. Till, hearing ring of coming chariot wheels He turned and saw Crito with Graceless pass At speed; but not too fast for Crito's glance Of greeting; when, but not till then, he found He had forgot his promise and his sword. After debate had ripened into choice The Judges three had left the Council Hall. Pygmalion striding homeward met midway Crito who walked alone. Your just rebuke Most surely earned have I; but pray before You hurl your bolt on my offending head Hear how that head has failed of its intent. Zealously striving to obey commands, My sword I shifted from its wonted place To hang on nail I drove into the door Leading from my workchamber; so that I On leaving must perceive it. But to-day The heat being great I set the door ajar, So leaving saw it not. Now I recall A jingling made as I closed fast the door, Which then seemed strange; but being too much urged To keep my hour for scrutiny, it passed Outside remark. Pardoned you must be now, But sin no more. In these deep shades let us Clasp that fair creature Chance and taste her sweets. She is too shy that pretty Wantonness; So hold her fast, embrace her while we can. In abler hands I now will leave the sword Until conviction forces grip of hilt. Now we will argue out the murder plot. Why do you think my senses are deceived? Nay, not deceived O Crito; over-keen! A common form to call his sight too keen Who sees beyond the caller! Then am I A boy full-sail, no ballast in my hull, No steersman at the helm; I drive so fast Perhaps on rocks and ruins? No, no; not so. But men may hate and do dire deadly ill, And yet stop short of murder foul and red. Tracing the spirit through its various shapes In law and custom takes long time to learn. Who learns will often see no difference Between an act the law rewards with death And one the law regards with stone blank eyes. A lazy rascal, drunken and half starved Scatters a rich man's brains and steals his purse: There is no question what becomes of him. A hard stern parent has a gentle child Whom, from moroseness, or some cause obscure He hates; and with fixed purpose day by day, By savage looks, harsh words, and heartless thwart Crushes her soul thro' wretchedness to death. What law or custom interferes with him? And yet a knife drawn thro' her tender throat Were mercy's self compared with that long death She died! Too true! I had not thought of this, Which now too clearly sets in unveiled glare The Cretan's fate, bluff Gortys. Every work Of his was wild with fire, almost beyond What statues should admit; but lacked the round Soft sweetening of parts which captivates, Thus lacked sweet-sucking people's sweet support: Seeing him surely sliding out of fame The wolfish pack set on him; headed him; And at the turns snapped their remorseless bits; Never removing bright determined eyes, Or slacking pace till they had pulled him down. This demon hunt was not achieved with jaws Blood red from snaps of flesh. The hunt was made By merry jokes; light, but well-aimed poohpoohs; Made while they drank their wine at rich men's boards, When no one could suspect of spite or hate. So happy were they; in such playfulness! See how they laugh! Note what embittered things They bandy round against their cheerful selves, But bitter legless things that fall. Unlike Their pretty ridicules, which sharp-hooked, stick And make the victim bleed. Yes, Crito, now I see the spirit may be one with his Who slays with sling or sword, and citizen Who sleekly marks one helpless to his death By means concealed securely from the dull. And what the dull ones fail to understand Borders on folly in the wise to show. This pack, Pygmalion, joining in one cry Could not by howling hunt you out of life; From this you are as far removed as stars. They cannot pinch your heart to starving death; They know not how to poision you; therefore Will use their only remedy at hand. As loved Pygmalion now you see their souls Can you doubt longer these men mean your death? I do not doubt their meaning, but I doubt Their power to execute. You scarcely think They could make civil war to murder me? I do not fear a war; but much I fear An ambush. This my care you should not go Swordless about the ways. For well I know A few of these same knaves were but a stroke Of play for your unerring sword to give Them lasting peace: unarmed, Pygmalion, think! I do not much affect the sword you know, Compared with bow and spear; for one takes skill Of poise in handling; while the other flies A venture with the wind. But with my sword Crito, give me a high wall at my back Six of these wretches would find overwork To touch me; and it would go hard indeed Did I not thin the circle. Warriors born Fight with their feet as much as with their hands: It is the thrust, and backward leap that tell; The certain eye that makes each stroke a death, Or limb disabled; and the cold clear brain That odds can never fluster. All most true, And therefore wear your sword! Pygmalion found On reaching home the weight of Crito's threat To leave the sword in abler hands than his. For when Ianthe, waiting, saw him pass Toward his work-chamber, straight she sought him there, Her visage all aglow with eagerness, A boon my Lord; I crave a boon of thee! Ianthe could not ask what was not mine To give; and therefore waiving question I Grant your desire. Yea, tho'it were to snare A lion and bring netted to your feet. Swear then by Aphrodite, and by Zeus, You will not leave your home or work-chamber Without a sword safe buckled by your side! I see, his dread on you has Crito laid; Gladly I swear by Aphrodite, Zeus, And every God that sways our mortal life; And if I durst would swear by Styx itself. But O, my Treasure, had I sworn by you The thread of Fate could not have bound me more. The Maiden's soul now bright and satisfied, She would have left him to his silent Gods Had not his love delayed her. In his arms He took her wealth of loveliness, and kissed Her answering lips. Too fair, too fair for man To call his own of right Ianthe thou! By what strange blessedness to me is given A form that moves Olympian in its grace! A time will come when wars will rage and clash Harsh thunders thro' the land. At such a time, Amid the crash my place will be to bind The heat of battle into fire and burn A ruthless entrance in the foeman's strength. Should some malignant dart, or deathful blade Check me in sudden night, you will recall The best Pygmalion had to give was thine; The best Pygmalion ever knew, thy love. Since Aphrodite in Her graciousness Had given Pygmalion his undreamed Delight, And as an easy following consequence, The power to make his statue live and gaze Awestruck before the awful face of Zeus, He had a lover's fondness for the walls Of Her great Temple standing proud and clear, A brightness in the day; a gloom at night, Save where the roof or column edges took The sprinkling light of stars or of the moon. Most often would he when the palace slept, Save for the guards who paced at intervals, Go forth alone and wander in the shades Or open spaces round the Temple, where Foxes and wolves had watched and taken note. He fed delightful fancies as he moved; At every step some lovely memory Justled the lovely one that came before; And each fresh comer made his heart more glad. He wondered what so long could cloud his sight Against Ianthe's beauty, grace, and love; For love with both must long have been at point Of bursting to the full and perfect flower. Was it his struggling to achieve the life And put a soul in statues made him blind; As one in battle would not heed the gleam Of sudden glory on a mountain side; Would only feel the glitter in his sight, Or see a vantage if it smote the foe's? How earnestly she came to crave her boon. Her hands down-clasped their utmost length before: The lift of her sweet face supplicating! In those deep eyes the droop of tenderness! Her radiance when the sacred oath was given! How prettily she buckled on my blade; Passing her hand atwixt the belt and me To find if drawn too tight! Could I forget An oath so asked, so gladly vowed? Not while This head commands my motions: while this sword Is mine to wear Ah! Ha! He happily Held scabbard in his hand, for on him rushed From out the darkness three with naked swords. Pygmalion was a muser; but the woods No leopard held with senses more alert; No leopard's backward spring could be more quick And sure than his when he beheld their blades Lifted to strike. Unsheathing at the pause, An instant, and he forward leaped; a swift Dark gleam, a groan; but ere the body fell A clash, another gleam, and dismal shriek Pierced ghastly thro' the silence of the night And both slain fell together; while the third, Nerveless for terror at their hasty fate, Turned round and fled. Pygmalion feared the chase, For stones unhewn and shaped lay cast about, With planks and blocks the Temple workmen used In mending some defects at base, and threw His sword, which caught the flying wretch between The calf and tendon of the heel slantwise, Whereat he would have fallen, had he not Driven on a spearhead which Orsines held Advanced to stop his flight. Crito had learned Pygmalion's nightly rambles, and had told Orsines, who in shadows watched unseen Night after night no harm befel his friend, And now, on hearing clash and shriek, rushed forth His spear at point, which, entering Bacis just Below the breast, ended his flight for life. When at Pygmalion's call torches were brought By guards on watch, they showed the first who felt The blade was the same athlete, now grown huge And strong, Orsines sought in days agone: The other was a swordsman of the best In Cyprus, and among Archaics thought Pre-eminent in statue-making craft: And Bacis lay with both hands clutching hard The fatal spear; and on his features death Had glazed the eyes and fixed a grin of pain. When the dark story of those murderous three Was noised abroad, Pygmalion shone like day. The clouds dispersed; the wild winds fell; his praise Was trolled by every tongue. What could show more Our age's madness than that men should rave Against Pygmalion, just, and strong, and wise? All always knew some harm would come to those Who dared assail his lofty name with spite. How happy he could guard his life so well! For had his priceless thread been cut what loss To Cyprus: how the King had grieved! And his Poor Hebe statue, what must that have felt? Those silly nobles who had snapped the lies That swarmed and buzzed around Pygmalion's name, Heard the crowd singing and sang with the crowd Their abject adulation. Pottery men Fashioned his likeness on their drinking-cups; And there were plots to have a statue made To show how Cyprus could adore her great. The minstrels unto gaping crowds forth poured In floods Pygmalion's almighty deeds, The doing which had taken ten long lives; Achilles not more brave, Alcides strong; And a moot question if Prometheus self, Or even Hephaestus could have wrought a form That breathed a sweeter life than Hebe's smile. And some gave murky hints they were not sure He could not roll the thunders an he pleased! And thus from baseless calumny the herd Of rich and poor, thoughtless as sheep that bleat, Passed into senseless ecstasy of laud; As din of croaking frogs melodious, Or deafening caws that rend the evening air. BOOK XII. The prodigy, three murderous wretches slain By two great Chiefs of war, was yet alive In idle tongues, when drifting rumours shook Both weaklings and strong men throughout the land. The rumours threatened Egypt would avenge Her overthrow some twenty summers past; For the last Pharaoh in his death-hour claimed This promise of his son, who sternly swore By their remorseless Gods he soon should hear From ghostly messengers in shadow world That Cyprus was their own; that the one son Of him who led the war was led in chains For mockery in old Egypt's capital, In smiles the aged Pharaoh closed his life, Hearing the cries of future victories. For when that broken enterprise returned His thwarted rage had doomed to death the Chief Who marched his armies to their fall, but was Of all his Lords the one he favoured most, Revenge thus sweetly soothed him as he died. The ships were coming in from every sea; Their hordes were arming fast; they would be thrown Wave upon wave in hungry multitudes Cyprus could raise no forces to resist. Such were the rumours that appalled the land With certain conflict and conjectures wild. While freaked with terror labour ran astray. The tiller ploughed his furrows all awry; Wide of her bowl, the cow-girl milked the ground; Swineherds drove swine to feed with pastured sheep, And sheep were driven in the swineries. The armourer burnt his metal gossiping, And merchants could not make their balances. The gilded idlers, erst of fluent prate And buzzing nothings, nothing had to say. While silent men now stormed in fiery speech Threatening the throngs on crowded quays and ways They would be slain, or slaves, unless they sprang Straightway to savagery in slaughterous war, Where each must feel an overmatch for three! From merchants flying home in rapid ships, Men of renown and weighty in the state, The King and Rulers learned that Egypt swarmed Alive with preparation, ships and men Bound to make Cyprus vassal of her sway. Time now was more than life. To choose a Chief In whom authority be absolute To hold the force of Cyprus at his will, In this they saw their first necessity. The King and Rulers met in Council Hall, And as the King said each Lord present knew Wherefore they met, he asked them to propose Without delay the Chiefs to be discussed. Pygmalion! Crito! Our Orsines! Loud Were called from every side, and these alone. The King then asked, Crito as first in age And deep experience, will you be Chief, Should your name bear the heaviest lot in votes? My knowledge and my sword are yours, O King, And will be used in service. Now, alas! I own not that reserve of manhood's strength Needed to hold our forces in control During this imminent and dreadful stress, And therefore for Pygmalion give my vote. The King next asked, Orsines, should the weight Of votes fall to your name, would you be Chief? O King, I must refuse, for well I know Another better fitted to command. Our island, after Crito, holds no head So clear and wise; no one whose skill so great In war; no arm so strong to execute As our Pygmalion's. Him I give my vote. Pygmalion, cried the King, as all the votes Are yours you must accept the Chieftainship, And during this dark crisis imminent, Hold all our power in trust to meet the foe. As you, O King, and these your ruling Lords, Lay on me this great charge I must obey. With Crito and Orsines, rest content, The swarms of Egypt will not range the Isle After the fashion of a pleasure jaunt! No foe could come more welcome to these arms. Beating these nation-gorgers off our shores My Father met his fate. By sacred Zeus, I swear; by all the Gods of highest heaven, To claim full payment for the debt they owe. Uprose the King, supported on each side, And passed out from the Council Hall. With pain The Rulers saw how lustreless his eyes; How wan his wrinkled visage: bowed and sunk Those shoulders once so signed by kingliness His subjects cast their bearing after his. Swiftly the tidings flew Pygmalion held The forces of the island in command. And all the nation as at rise of sun Woke at a bound in buoyancy and joy. The tiller now could plough his furrows straight, But left the plough to flourish spear and shield. The cow-girl now could fill the frothing bowl. The shepherd and the swineherd left to boys Due care of sheep and swine. The armourer now No metal spoiled, but wrought unceasingly A merry tune that gladdened hearers' hearts. The merchants, girding on their warlike swords, Boasted their balances must bide their time. And gilded idlers plunged in discipline, While the roused silent cried exultingly, Their dearest hopes were coming truths at last! From every part the Chieftains gathered men Who crowding came, unasked, to take the toil Assigned them in the now fast mustering hosts. Nimbly from chariots strong lances flew, And all day eager bowmen practised aim; The spearmen knelt in low straight even lines In four or five ranks deep behind their shields, Their points at moving threat, each beyond each; Or at a word the whole as one would rise, And bounding forward rush in mimic charge, Then drawing backward sink again to rank. Pygmalion knew the woodmen of the Isle, Dexterous in use of axe; a stubborn race, Clad in hard leather fitting to their shapes, And formed them one rough body who would dare Make their attack uncovered by a shield. He built tall towers of wood, huge wheels inside Which twelve strong men could push and move at will; A platform roofed atop for chosen bows Whose arrows carried fate. The training ceased Not even with the dusk at setting sun. In the wild heat of infinite commands Crito forgot his age: his eyes and voice Were everywhere giving young leaders help Of ancient wiles for safety and attack. While everywhere Orsines checked the rash, And stayed the eager by his steadiness. No need for inspiration, all were fire. Men watched from every height along the coast; Ships from all quarters hastened into port; Save flying vessels sent to catch the first Glimpse of the foe and bring the tidings home. Awhile the fleets of Egypt had been bound In idleness by winds, and adverse storms, One hard on other's heels; such, old men said, Had not been known on Egypt's seas before. And every hour was Cyprus' gain. At length A ship that had outsped the rest was seen Nearing the shore and signal made the Foe. Straightway Pygmalion summoned every Chief Who could be spared from guarded points, and care Of raw and youthful ranks, to make them know His battle-plan. He meant the foe to land; Slingers and archers from safe vantage spots To greet the landing with unceasing showers Of stone and steel: but when the landing swelled To vasty numbers backward must they fall On the main battle by the ways they knew. He meant the battle to be shaped like that Which his lost Father fought. He meant them not Move one pace from their stations till he cried The general onset, when his whole wedge would Steadily open to a level line Resistless driving Egypt in the sea. He meant the chariots not to charge in force During the onslaughts of the foe; but hang And hover in two bodies near the horns To stop the hordes from taking them in rear: Should any chance surprise make this a dread The axemen in reserve must fill the gap. Having made clear his plans to every Chief, Pygmalion then dismissed them to their posts, Save Crito and Orsines who remained. He who has fought in many battlefields Knows during heat and press of action will Arise such dangers unexpectedly As must tax all the wisest head can know To give them counter-check: therefore do I Leave nothing at a hazard I can guard. And you my two best friends have each to share A deed I dare not trust to other hands. Orsines you will have your ships in port Ready as hounds are when unleashed to slip And charge their vessels from the seaward side With shafts, and fire, and drive them on the shore When on this mound between the beach and town You see my signal smoke and fire arise. As the destruction of these enemies In any satisfying way depends On this great signal telling time exact To him who holds the fleet, I must the task Intrust to you, O Crito: you alone. Six runners will I send you following; But when the second reaches, fire. The rest Are but to make security more sure. Glaringly manifest the flaming pile Then, with all spears and chariots you command Attack on right of me, for I shall then Be pressing on with my whole force in line. Proudly at eventide the Pharaoh's fleet, Innumerable, and unmolested, lay Threatening in dreadful beauty off the shore. A flood of glory from the stormy west Poured over dancing waves and splashed the ships With antic gold; and drove dark purple shades Far on the waters to the deepening East. All night on every point along the shore Burned signal watchfires; watchers each in turn Taking his rest. Fresh must be every man To-morrow's dawn, for every man awakes The fate of Cyprus holding in his hands. When last from darkness feeble pallors broke Pygmalion peering thro' the glimmering saw Movement among the ships, and straight gave word To rouse the host. Fiercely then squealed the pipes, And hoarsely brayed the sea-shell trumpeters: The army like a monster myriad-voiced Sprang into instant life, the tramp of men, The shouting leaders, metal clang of arms. His host of axes, chariots, spears, and bows, Pygmalion formed between the city walls And sea, far lying, on wide stretch of ground, The forward spur of some great inland range, And, like his battle lines, wedge shaped; down-sloped On every side but that towards the town. He placed a stout-built, bow-armed, wooden tower At either horn of his great battle wedge; Three near the point to bear the heaviest brunt; Five on his Eastern side, at intervals, Two on the West; being steeper there, the chance Of onslaught less. Well posted, Crito held His mound. The pile of pine-boughs resinous, Damp heaps of leaves on oil-soaked flax: and men With torches ready to obey the word, Were guarded by his chariots and spears. Grim in reserve before the city gates The axemen resting on their glittering blades. On each flank trembling in a splendour-blaze The brazen chariots mocked the risen day; Their neighing horses pawed, and strained the reins Impatient to be thundering thro' the land. Orsines with Pygmalion traced the lines, Trimming the men and cheering, till afar They saw the arrow-showers by the shore Glisten like webs in dewy mornings bright, And hitherward the archers falling back Before their ever-thickening enemy; When crying Ships! Orsines to your ships. Charge from the open, drive their fleet ashore! Pygmalion left him. Plunged the tide of war: The flying bows now slipped within the lines, Driven by the raging swarm, whose points so fast Began to sprinkle helm and shield, he brought His bowmen into rank behind the spears, Bidding them answer rapidily and sure. Like ramping waves upon a bar of rock The hot Egyptians dashed upon the wedge, And like the ramping waves fell broken back. But when successive onslaughts baffled, beat Their ardour to a pause, shouted the Chief, Three spear-lines charge, and back again to rank! Forth rushed the triple line with levelled points And smote the battle such a shock their scream Of horror tore the thunderous air. When back Again at threat. Now bows, Pygmalion said, Play me a merry tune! The volleys whizzed, Whistling the airs of death. Is that the air You play me? Half the shafts fly overhead; The rest strike nowhere! Rabbits; Geese, I say. Aim you between the navel and the breast. Nay, not so keen. If no bare places show To let your arrows in, then wait and watch The chance. Aim at the face no farther off Than ten fair strides; then, between mouth and brow. Well shot, my men. Now you are lions: yea, And leopards beautiful. Tower there! Behold That tall-capped chieftain; he fights much too well; Down with him. Ha! He staggers; throws out spear At nothing; falls! They crowd, and boldly press Our eastern horn; signal the chariots! But stay; so thick they fall around the tower We may not need them. Chariots I want fresh Ere long to join the chase. Strange; no charge I see Against our lines, what means it, can you tell? Pygmalion of a bold young leader asked. The bold young leader thought the foe had fed On Cyprian darts, and Cyprian spears enough, And would be glad to end the feast and go. Then must we stuff them if they will not eat! I see it now; my towers have deftly done Their work too well for Pharaoh's host, and slain Most of their leaders; for I gave the word, Unless hard driven, as that Eastern tower, Those bowmen were to slaughter none but chiefs; This makes their hesitation; easy now And golden-paved our way to victory. Send my six runners off to Crito now! Command the axes to come slowly down With every flanking chariot east and west. I see a black storm rising from the south Will wash our dusty visages and make A puddled fighting ground. My work begins! Fiercely the storms had Crito's mound assail'd, And he had burned to bind his force and charge Headlong and crush the fiery foe with spears: Mindful of fire and pile, he dared no more Than beat off each assault. O Pygmalion, He sighed, how coldly clear that planning brain! Who with a head less calm and reverent To warlike strict obedience than mine Could have forborne the temptings of this day? Gazing he saw Pygmalion's western wing Straightening towards the mound; and while he gazed A runner coming crying, Crito, Fire! Another close at heels, whom, ere he made The mound, an arrow struck and felled: one more, Nigh stumbling over him, ran in and cried Fire, my Lord Crito, fire the pile! At once All torches kissed, and with their flaming tongues Licked at the feast of oil and resinous gums. Great grew the flames and roaring caught the leaves That sent a thick gray smoke high in the air. Then Crito shouted Chariots to right, Flank the Egyptians, drive them eastward back. Spears form in triple line; press on to join Pygmalion's wing that fast is drawing nigh. Pygmalion's Mother on the gate-tower watched Remembering. At the King's wish she came With Eos and Ianthe: sad herself She strove to cheer him on this fateful day. All day the fight had seemed some monstrous thing Hugging the earth and shuddering thro' its length. And all day long they heard a sound as of Far waters rushing over broken stones. The south grows black, tell me Ianthe what Your younger sight can see; Bade the old King. Upon the mound a giant signal fire Throwing a world of smoke. And chariots thronged Driving at speed toward the western shore. Now outward move the two great battle-lines. And widely stretch across the plain and join A line of spears that touches on the mound. Now moves the whole line straight from west to east, As I have seen an eagle spread his wings Poising for prey. The chariots of both flanks Are moving separate ways. The axes too Are striding forward; on their shoulders shine The dreadful blades. I see our ships far out Now turning round towards the Pharaoh's fleet. Orsines! Eager Eos cried, how dares He with that scanty sail of ships attack A fleet so vast, enormous, as the foes'? Hard is it child to say, the King replied, What that may be Orsines does not dare, If bid by me, or by Pygmalion charged! Be calm, the Matron said, for rest assured Pygmalion had not sent his friend beloved On service of more risk than man could take. Behold! Behold! By the high Powers of Heaven The Pharaoh's fleet is fired! Again behold! Our chariots thunder to the charge; they catch Them either wing. Their fleet smoke clouds themselves. But look, the axes are at work; they rise, And fall, and gleam like beat of seabirds' wings, Incessant: every stroke must be a back Hewn through, or head and helmet crushed. I scarce Can see them now for smoke and flames beyond. Escape for Egypt none. Slaves will be had For asking, as they cannot kill the whole, Their arms will ache too much. Behold, then cried Ianthe; list that dreadful thunder roll! Fighters and foes must both be overwhelmed; Stroke upon stroke the lightning lashes them! The hungry tempest gapes to swallow all! Look, Eos shrieked, our fleet is out at sea And strives against the wind; Orsines must Be drowned. Thus to fight against Boreas, And Zeus, and great Poseidon on the waves! Eos my tender dove, thy birdlike head Lay on this heart of mine; and I will stroke It into quietude, the old King said; Orsines could not play a wiser game Than throw himself upon the open sea. Their fleet on fire; wind setting towards the shore, Theirs he well knows a dangerous neighbourhood. Rarely are Zeus, Poseidon, Boreas Incensed against the brave. If he can make The harbour Ha! what ails you man? speak out! Your face looks flying from an enemy, So staringly your eyes start in advance! The Chief, O King, a message from the Chief. Send up the message! And the message came, And kneeling down before him, said, Dread King, Pygmalion's reverent love, he bids me say The enemy is beaten; all his ships Are burnt or driven ashore. The slaughter great, And had been greater but their Chief was slain; When, losing heart, the rest laid down their arms. Good, said the King, but why not captive make Of that Egyptian Chieftain, was it chance? Pygmalion would have saved the Chief, but one, A spearman, whose son wounded fell, and who Was after coldly mangled, rushed and clove The Chieftain's neck in twain; he could not live, He said, without this offering to Fate. Pygmalion bade me add, himself, O King, Anon would follow my report. And while He spoke the warm air trembled to the sound Of chariots thundering up at topmost speed, Leaving a storm of coiling dust behind; For unfulfilled, the threatened drench had passed And left the evening bright. Pygmalion, Lo! He comes outstripping guards! Ianthe cried, His helm, sun-smitten, crowns him with a star! And while she spoke the thunder suddenly Stopped at the gates below, changing to din Of jingling arms; the snort, pawing of dust, And shaking of the chariot horses; when, Ere they could wonder, filling all regard, Pygmalion entering fell before the King, And took his long white withered hands to kiss, And in the King's lap sank his stately head. My Son! my Son! How? How? Then checked, and bent His aged face, and clasped him lovingly, And muttered, More than son. Yea more! yea more! And lay so long in silence that at length The Matron gently lifting up his face Saw he had fainted. Soon by chafe and art He was brought back to life; Pygmalion then, As if the King had been a suckling babe, Carried him tenderly adown the steps And placed him on his waiting litter, when They bore him to his palace where he slept. Covered you are from head to foot in blood Pygmalion; are you hurt? the Matron asked. Mostly Egyptian blood you see, my own Dear mother. I had not a scratch until The general onslaught, when I sometimes felt As I have often when in boyhood I Among the brambles scrambled for their fruit, Orsines holding cap for me to fill. Now will I to my bath and make me fit To stand before your presence. Eos asked, Is a great victory a glorious thing? O Eos nay! It is more horrible Than anything beside except defeat! Ianthe then, Think O my dear One, think Of those brave youths whose hands Pygmalion's clasped; Whose lips have smiled upon him, cold in death. Their mother's hopes all withered at the root! The women who have lost their strong supports: The children's wail for what will never come. Such are the flowers that bloom where victory Has soaked the earth in blood. But were that blood The well-shed blood alone of enemies Then victory were in truth a glorious thing. The overwhelming blow his arms had struck Egyptian arrogance had overthrown The remnant of the old King's strength in joy. His forces would not rally; for, said he, The dry shrewd son of Esculapius, There are none left to call; they gave his age Their long farewells and left fareills instead. In Council Hall guiding his ruling Lords He never will sit more. The only cheer Could soothe him was to have Pygmalion by: For as he lay and clasped those mighty hands Within his trembling own, he felt a hold On life. I should not dread my fate, he moaned, So much I long for rest: could I but know The crown of Cyprus safe upon your head! And when the aged King's last hour had come, Reverent and sad, around the chamber walls, And silent sat the rulers, lacking hope. His head lay resting on Pygmalion's breast; Hands holding hand he sighed his latest breath, Kingly art thou. O take my crown; my crown. Before the King's sepulchral rites began The Council, Crito told Pygmalion, would Elect him King. But, as they something knew Of moodiness in him, and strange disdain Of what the most held dear, right was it judged To test beforehand would he take the crown If his election stood by force of votes? O tempter Crito! What a net is this You wind about me! How can I resist? Should I refuse and things go wrong henceforth, On my unhappy head will lie the curse! If I accept, ah then a long farewell To what in me is dearer far than life Without it; making the similitudes Of the great Gods I fear, love, and adore. We are but parts of what we dwell amidst; And if the press diverts us from our course Helpless are we, and must submit, tho' sad, And we look longing backwards evermore. But I will ask Ianthe; what she says, So balanced am I, what she says I do. Then Crito went his way, mournful at heart For loss of his loved King; but pleased to know Ianthe had the choice, as her great soul Would choose the rugged path for him she loved. Crito was sent in all due form of state Demanding, should the votes declare me King, Would I accept their burden of the crown? I would give neither nay, nor yea, till you Ianthe had avowed your will to me. Trouble and sorrow greet me every turn: No words can tell how my bewildered mind Ran darkling while I strove to put the soul In Hebe's statue. Being done, arose A swarm of loathly scandals till I slew Their origin; when burst and raged a din Of nauseous flattery from the very knaves Who used their skill to foul my name before. My hard fate next forced these reluctant hands To work this dreadful carnage, and behold My friends in numbers dead as the cold earth On which their bodies lay. Then my blessed King, Whom my soul loved as he had been a God, Passed from me in these arms. And now the Lords Of Cyprus will to weight me with their crown, And ruthlessly to rob me of my peace; My work in which my spirit knows delight. That I may never feel again the bliss Of silence and of solitary hours. O my Pygmalion, well you know that I Feel with your joys, and grieve with your regrets. Bitter the pain to wrench yourself from what Your soul has cleaved to since the golden days; The blossoming energy of youthful prime! But they, meseems, whom most the great Gods love Are taken early from this battle-world, Or have the heaviest burdens on them laid; Sometimes beyond their strength. This is their way Of love; not man's; but we to them must bow. If all the Rulers, all the best we know, Demand the sacrifice, it is the Gods Who speak by them. We dare not disobey. The greater loss, and greater pain, more sure The proof of its necessity. The Gods Are hard, relentless; may not be denied. A rugged path Pygmalion has to tread; But in his home there will be peace and calm. He knows the Gods are just. Let that suffice. At Crito's call the Lords of Council met In solemn state and chose Pygmalion King. THE END.</field>
