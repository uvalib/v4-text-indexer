Þe Cristen woman fedde hem þoo, Ful wel she louyd hem boþ twoo. So longe sche fedde hem in feere þat þey were of elde of seuen ?ere. Þe kyng behelde his sone dere, And seyde to him on this manere, Þat harme it were muche more But his sone were sette to lore On þe book letters to know, As men done, both hye and lowe. “Feire sone,” she seide, “þou shalt lerne, Lo þat þou do ful ?erne.” Florys answerd with wepyng, As he stood byfore þe kyng; Al wepyng seide he, “Ne schal not Blancheflour lerne with me? Ne can y no?t to scole goone With-out Blanchefloure,” he seide þane. “Ne can y in no scole syng ne rede With-out Blancheflour,” he seide. Þe king seide to his soone, “She shal lerne for þy loue.” To scole þey were put; Boþ þey were good of wytte. Wonder it was of hur lore, And of her loue wel þe more. Þe Children louyd to-geder soo, Þey my?t neuer parte a twoo. When þey had .v. ?ere to scoole goone So wel þey had lerned þoo, Inow? þey couþ of latyne, And wel wryte on parchemyne. Þe kyng vnderstod þe grete Amoure Bytwene his sone and Blanchefloure, And þou?t when þey were of Age Þat her loue wolde no?t swage; Nor he my?t no?t her loue withdrawe When Florys shuld wyfe after þe lawe. Þe king to þe Queene seide þoo, And tolde hur of his woo, Off his þou?t and of his care, How it wolde of Floreys fare. “Dame,” he seide, “y tel þe my reede, I wyl þat Blaunchefloure be do to deede. When þat maide is y-slawe, And brou?t of her lyf dawe, As sone as Florys may it vnder ?ete, Rathe he wylle hur for?ete. Þan may he wyfe after reede.” Þe Queene answerde þen and seide, And þou?t with hur reede Saue þe mayde fro þe deede. “Sir,” she seide, “we au?t to fonde Þat Florens lyf wit menske in londe, And þat he lese not his honour For þe mayden Blauncheflour. Who so my?t þat mayde clene, Þat she were brou?t to deþ bydene, Hit were muche more honour Þan slee þat mayde Blancheflour.” Vnneþes þe king g[ra]unt þat it be soo. “Dame, rede vs what is to doo.” “Sir, we shul oure soone Florys Sende into þe londe of Mountargis. Blythe wyl my suster be Þat is lady of þat Contree. And when she woot for whoom Þat we have sent him vs froom, She wyl doo al hur my?t, Boþ by day and by ny?t, To make hur loue so vndoo As it had neuer ben soo. And, sir,” she seide, “y rede eke Þat þe maydens moder make hur seek. Þat may be þat other resoun For þat ylk enchesoun, Þat she may not fro hur moder goo.” Now ben þese Children swyþ woo, Now þey may not goo in fere Drewryer þinges neuer noone were. Florys wept byfore þe kyng, And seide, “Sir, with-out lesyng, For my harme out ?e me sende, Now she ne my?t with me wende. Now we ne mot to-geder goo, Al my wele is turned to woo.” Þe king seide to his soone aply?t, “Sone, withynne þis fourteny?t, Be her moder quykke or deede,” “Sekerly,” he him seide, “Þat mayde shal come þe too.” “?e, sir,” he seid, “y pray ?ow it be soo. ?if þat ?e me hur sende, I rekke neuer wheder y wende.” Þat þe Child graunted þe kyng was fayne, And him betau?t his Chamburlayne. With muche honoure þey þeder coome, As fel to a ryche kynges soone. Wel feire him receyuyd þe Duke Orgas, Þat king of þat Castel was, And his Aunt wiþ muche honour; But euer he þou?t on Blanchefloure. Glad and blythe þey ben him withe; But for no ioy þat he seith, Ne my?t him glade game ne gle, For he my?t not his lyf see. His Aunt set him to lore Þere as other Children wore, Boþ maydons and grome; To lerne mony þeder coome. Inow? he sykes, but no?t he lernes; For Blauncheflour euer he mornes. Yf enyman to him speke Loue is on his hert steke. Loue is at his hert roote Þat no þing is so soote: Galyngale ne lycorys Is not so soote as hur loue is, Ne nothing ne none other. So much he þenkeþ on Blancheflour, Of oo day him þynkeþ þre, For he ne may his loue see. Þus he abydeth with muche woo Tyl þe fourteny?t were goo. When he saw she was nou?t ycoome, So muche sorow he haþ noome, Þat he loueth mete ne drynke, Ne may noone in his body synke. Þe Chamberleyne sent þe king to wete, His sones state al y-wrete. Þe king ful sone þe waxe to-brake, For to wete what it spake: He begynneth to chaunge his moode, And wel sone he vnderstode, And with wreth he cleped þe Queene, And tolde hur alle his teene, And with wraþ spake and sayde, “Let do bryng forþ þat mayde! Fro þe body þe heued shal goo.” Þenne was þe Quene ful woo. Þan spake þe Quene, þat good lady, “For goddes love, sir, mercy. At þe next hauen þat here is, Þer ben chapmen ryche y-wys, Marchaundes of babyloyne ful ryche, Þat wol hur bye blethelyche. Than may ?e for þat louely foode Haue muche Catell and goode. And soo she may fro vs be brou?t, Soo þat we slee hur nou?t.” Vnneþes þe king graunted þis; But forsoþ so it is, Þe king let sende after þe burgeise, Þat was hende and Curtayse, And welle selle and bygge couth, And moony langages had in his mouth. Wel sone þat mayde was him betau?t; An to þe hauene was she brou?t. Þer haue þey for þat maide ?olde xx. Mark of reed golde, And a Coupe good and ryche, In al þe world was none it lyche. Þer was neuer noone so wel graue; He þat it made was no knave. Þer was purtrayd on, y weene, How Paryse ledde awey þe Queene; And on þe Couercle a-boue Purtrayde was þer both her love; And in þe Pomel þerone Stood a Charbuncle stoone. In þe world was not so depe soler, Þat it nold ly?t þe Botelere, To fylle boþ ale and wyne, Of syluer and golde boþ good and fyne. Enneas þe king, þat nobel man, At Troye in batayle he it wan, And brou?t it in-to Lumbardy, And gaf it his lemman, his Amy. Þe Coupe was stoole fro king Cesar; A þeef out of his tresour hous it bar. And sethe þat ilke same þeef For Blaunchefloure he it ?eef. For he wyst to wynne suche þree, My?t he hur bryng to his contree. Now þese Marchaundes saylen ouer þe see, With þis mayde, to her contree. So longe þey han vndernome, Þat to Babyloyne þey ben coome. To þe Amyral of Babyloyne Þey solde þat mayde swythe soone; Rath and soone þey were at oone. Þe Amyral hur bou?t Anoone, And gafe for hur, as she stood vpry?t, Seuyne sythes of golde her wy?t, For he þou?t without weene Þat faire mayde haue to Queene; Among his maydons in his bour He hur dide with muche honour. Now þese merchaundes þat may belete, And ben glad of hur by?ete. n Ow let we of Blauncheflour be, And speke of Florys in his contree. Now is þe Bu[r]gays to þe king coome With þe golde and his garysone, And haþ take þe king to wolde, Þe seluer and þe Coupe of golde. They lete make in a Chirche As swithe feire graue wyrche. And lete ley þer-vppone A new feire peynted stone, With letters al aboute wryte With ful muche worshippe. Who-so couth þe letters rede, Þus þey spoken, and þus þey seide: “Here lyth swete Blaunchefloure Þat Florys louyd Paramoure.” Now Florys haþ vndernome, And to his Fader he is coome. In his Fader halle he is ly?t, His Fader him grette anoone ry?t, And his moder, þe Queene, also, But vnneþes my?t he þat doo, Þat he ne asked where his Lemman bee; Nonskyns answere chargeþ hee. So longe he is forth noome, In to Chamber he is coome. Þe maydenys moder he asked ry?t, “Where is Blauncheflour, my swete wy?t?” “Sir,” she seide, “forsothe ywys, I ne woot where she is.” She beþou?t hur on þat lesyng Þat was ordeyned byfoore þe king. “Þou gabbest me,” he seyde þoo, “Þy gabbyng doþ me muche woo. Tel me where my leman be.” Al wepyng seide þenne shee, “Sir,” shee seide, “deede.” “deed!” seide he. “Sir,” sche seide, “for sothe, ?ee.” “Allas, when died þat swete wy?t?” “Sir, withynne þis Fourteny?t Þe erth was leide hur aboute, And deed she was for thy loue.” Flores, þat was so feire and gent, Sownyd þere verament. Þe cristen woman began to crye To ihesu crist and seynt Marye. Þe king and þe queene herde þat crye; In to þe Chamber þey ronne on hye. And þe Queene herde her byforne On sowne þe Childe þat she had borne. Þe kinges hert was al in care, Þat sawe his sone for loue so fare. When he a-wooke and speke mo?t, Sore he wept and sore he sy?t, And seide to his moder ywys, “Lede me þere þat mayde is.” Þeder þey him brou?t on hy?e; For care and sorow he wolde dy?e. As sone as he to þe graue com, Sone þere behelde he þen, And þe letters began to rede, Þat þus speke and þus seide: “Here lyth swete Blauncheflour, Þat Florys louyd paramoure.” Þre sithes Florys sownydde nouth; Ne speke he my?t not with mouth. As sone as he awoke and speke my?t, Sore he wept and sore he sy?t. “Blauncheflour!” he seide, “Blauncheflour!” So swete a þing was neuer in boure. Of Blauncheflour is þat y meene, For she was come of good kyne. Lytel and muche loueden þe For þy goodnesse and þy beaute. ?if deþ were dalt ary?t, We shuld be deed boþ on oo ny?t. On oo day borne we were; We shul be ded boþ in feere.” “Deeþ,” he seide, “ful of enuye, And of alle trechorye, Refte þou hast me my lemman.” “For soth,” he seide, “þou art to blame. She wolde haue leuyd, and þu noldest, And fayne wolde y dye, and þu woldest. After deeþ clepe nomore y nylle, But slee my self now y wille.” His knyf he braide out of his sheth; Him self he wolde haue doo to deth. And to hert he had it smetene Ne had his moder it vnder ?etene. Þen þe Queene fel him vppone, And þe knyf fro him noome. She reft him of his lytel knyf, And sauyd þere þe Childes lyf. Forþ þe Queene ranne, al wepyng, Tyl she come to þe kyng. Þan seide þe good lady, “For goddes loue, sir, mercy! Of .xii. children haue we noone On lyue now but þis oone. And better it were she were his make, Þan he were deed for hur sake.” “Dame, þou seist soþ,” seide he; “Sen it may noone other be, Leuer me were she were his wyf, Þan y lost my sonnes lyf.” Of þis word þe Quene was fayne, And to her soone she ran agayne. “Floryes, soone, glad make the, Þy lef þou schalt on lyue see. Florys, sone, þrou? engynne Of þy Faders reed and myne, Þis graue let we make, Leue sone, for þy sake. ?if þou þat maide forgete woldest, After oure reed wyf þou sholdest.” Now euery worde she haþ him tolde, How þat þey þat mayden solde. “Is þis soth, my moder dere?” “For soth,” she seide, “she is not here.” Þe row? stoone adoune þey leyde, And sawe þat was not þe mayde. “Now, moder, y þink þat y leue may. Ne shal y rest ny?t ne day, Ny?t ne day ne no stounde, Tyl y haue my lemmon founde. Hur to seken y woll wende, Þau? it were to þe worldes ende.” To þe king he goþ to take his leue, And his Fader bade him byleue. “Sir, y wyl let for no wynne; Me to bydden it it were grete synne.” Þan seid þe king, “seth it is soo, Seþ þou wylt noone other doo, Al þat þe nedeþ we shul þe fynde; Ihesu þe of care vnbynde.” “Leue Fader,” he seide, “y telle þe Al þat þou shalt fynde me. Þou mast me fynde, at my deuyse, Seuen horses al of prys, And twoo y-charged vppon þe molde Boþ with seluer and wyþ golde, And two ycharged with monay For to spenden by þe way, And þree with clothes ryche, Þe best of al þe kyngryche, Seuen horses and seuyn men, And þre knaues without hem, And þyne owne Chamburlayne, Þat is a wel nobel swayne. He can vs wyssh and reede, As marchaundes we shull vs lede.” His Fader was an hynde king, Þe Coupe of golde he dide him bryng, Þat ilke self Coupe of golde Þat was Blauncheflour for ?olde. “Haue þis, soone,” seide þe king, “Herewith þou may þat swete þing, Wynne so may betyde, Blauncheflour with þe white syde, Blauncheflour, þat faire may.” Þe king let sadel a Palfray, Þe oone half so white so mylke, And þat other reed so sylk. I ne can telle nou?t How rychely þat sadel was wrou?t. Þe Arson was of golde fyne, Stones of vertu stode þeryne, Bygone aboute wit orfreys. Þe Queene was kynde and curtays, Cast hur toward þe kyng And of hur fynger she brayde a ryng: “Haue now þis ylke ryng: While is it þyne, dou?t no þyng Of fire brennyng ne water in þe See; Ne yren ne steele shal dere thee.” He took his leue for to goo; Þer was ful muche woo; Þey made him noon other chere Þan her soon were leide in bere. Furþ he went with al his mayn; With him went þe Chamberlayn. So haue þey her hauyn nome Þat þey ben to þe hauyn come Þere Blaunchefloure was alny?t, Wel rychely þey ben dy?t; Þe lord of þe ynne was welle hende; Þe Child he sette next þe ende, In al þe feirest seete Alle þey dronken and al þey ?ete: Ete ne drynke my?t he nou?t; On blauncheflour was al his þou?t. Þe lady of þat vnder?at Þat þe Childe mornyng sat, And seide to her lord with styl dreme, “Sir, nyme now goode ?eme How þe Child mournyng syttes: Mete and drynke he for?etes: Lytel he eteþ, and lasse he drynkeþ; He is a marchaund, as me þynkeþ.” To Flores þen seide she, “Al ful of mournyng y the see. Þer sate þer þis sender day, Blauncheflour, þat swete may. Heder was þat mayde brou?t With Marchaundes þat hur had bou?t; Heder þey brou?t þat mayde swete; Þey wold haue solde hur for by?ete; To Babyloyne þey wylle hur brynge, Boþ of semblant &amp; of mornynge.” When Florys herd speke of his lemman, Was he neuer so glad a man, And in his hert bygan to ly?t; Þe Coupe he let fulle anoon ry?t: “Dame,” he seide, “þe fessel is þyne, Boþ þe Coupe and þe wyne, Þe wyne and þe gold eke, For þou of my leman speke: On hur y þou?t, for hur y sy?t; I ne wyst where I hur fynde my?t; Wynde ne weder shal me assoyne, Þat y ne shal seche hur in Babyloyne.” Now Florys resteþ him al a ny?t. At morne, when it was day ly?t, He dide him in-to þe wylde flood. Wynde and weder with him stood; Sone so Florys come to londe, Þere he þanked goddes sonde To þe londe þer his lyf ynne is: Him þou?t he was in paradyse. Sone to Florys tydyng men tolde Þat þe Amyral wold Fest holde; His Erls, Barons, comyn sholde, And al þat wold of him lond holde, For to herkyn his hest And for to honoure his Feest. Glad was Florys of þat tydyng; He hoped to come to þat gestyng, ?if he my?t, in þat halle, His lemman see among hem alle. OW to þat Citee Florys is come; Feire he hath his ynne y-noome At a palaise; was none it lyche; Þe lord of þat ynne was fulle ryche; He hadde ben ferre and wyde. Þe Childe he set next his syde, In al þe feirest seete. Alle þey dronken and ete, Al þat þerynne were, Al þey made good chere, Þey ete and dronke echoon with other; But Florys þou?t al another, Ete ne drynke he my?t no?t, On Blauncheflour was al his þou?t. Þan spake þe Burgays Þat was hende and Curtays: “Ow, child, me þynkeþ welle Þat muche þou þynkest on my catelle.” “Nay, sir, on Catel þenke y nou?t,” (On Blauncheflour was al his þou?t,) “But y þynke on al wyse For to fynde my marchaundise; And ?it it is þe most woo, When y it fynd, y shal it forgoo.” Þan spak þe lord of þat ynne, “Þis sender day, þer sate hereyne Þat faire Maide Blauncheflour, boþ in halle and in boure. Euer she made mornyng chere, And bement Florys, her lyf fere; Ioye ne blis made she noon, But for Florys she made her moon.” Florys toke a Coupe of syluer clere, A mantyl of Scarlet with menyuere: “Houe þis, sir, to þyn honour; Þou may þonke it Blauncheflour. He my?t make myn hert glade, Þat couþ me tel wheder she is ladde.” “Child, to Babyloyne she is brou?t; Þe Amyral hur haþ bou?t: He gaf for hur, as she stood vpry?t, Seuen sithes of gold hur wy?t; For he þenkeþ with-out weene, Þat faire may haue to Queene. Among his maydons in his toure He hur dide, with much honoure.” Now Flores resteþ him þere al ny?t, Tyl on þe morrow þe day was ly?t; He roos on þe morownyng, He gaf his Ost an hundryd shelyng, To his ost and to his Ostesse, And toke his leue, and feire dide kysse; And ?erne his ost he besou?t, Þat he him help, ?if he my?t ou?t, ?if he my?t, with any gynne, Þat feire may to him wynne. “Childe,” he seide, “to a brygge þou shalt come, The Senpere fynde at hoome: He woneth at þe brygges ende; Curtays man he is, and hende; We arn bretheren, and trouthes ply?t: He can þe wyssh and rede a-ry?t; Þou shalt bere him a rynge Fro my-self to tokenynge, Þat he help þe in boure and halle As it were my self befalle.” Florys takeþ þe ryng, and nemeþ leue, For long wold he nou?t beleue. By þat it was vndern hy?e, Þe Brygge come he swyth nye. Þe Senperes name was Darys. Florys gret him wel feire ywys, And he him þe ryng arau?t, And ful feire it him betau?t. Þrou? þe token of þat ilk ryng Florys had ful faire gestnyng Off Fyssh and flessh and tender breed, Of wyn, both white and reed: And euer Florys sate ful colde, And Dares bygan þe Childe beholde: “Leue Child, what may þis be, Þus þou?tful as y the see? And þou nou?t al in feere, Þat þou makist þus sory chere, Or þou lykkest no?t þis yn?” Þan Floreys answered him: “?is, sir, by goddes ore, So good ne had y mony day ?ore: God let me abyde þat daye Þat y þe quyte wel may: But y þenke on al wyse Most vppon my marchaundyse; And ?it it is most woo, When y hit Fynde, y shal it forgoo.” “Childe, woldest þou telle me my gryf, To hele þe, me were ful lyf.” Euery word he haþ him tolde, How þe mayde was fro him solde, And how he was of Spayn a kynges sone, For grete loue þider y-come, To fonde, with quantyse and with gyn, Blauncheflour for to wynne. “Now,” seith Dares, “þou art a Folt,— And For a Foole þe Childe he halt,— “Now y woot how it gooth, Þou desirest þyn own death. Þe Amyral haþ to his Iustinges Oþer half hundred of ryche kinges; And þe Alder-rychest king Durst not begynne suche a þing. ?if Amyral my?t it vnderstonde, He shulde be drawe in his owne londe, A-bout Babyloyne, y wene, Six longe myle and tene; At euery myle is a walle þerate, Seuen sithes twenty ?ate; And .xx. toures þer ben ynne, Þat euery day chepyng is ynne; Euery day and ny?t þrou?-out þe ?ere Þe Chepyng is y-lyche plenere; And þau? al þe men þat ben bore, Had on hur lyf swore To wynne þat maide feire and free, Al shul þey die, so moot y the. In þat bour, in mydward py?t, Stondeþ a toure, y the ply?t, An hundryd fathum it is hye,— Who-soo beholdeþ hit, fer or nere, An hundred fathum it is y-fere;— It is made with-out[en] pere, Of lyme and of Marbulstone; In al þis world is suche noone. Now is þe morter made so wele, Ne may it breke, iren ne steele. Þe Pomel þat aboue is leide, It is made with muche pride; Þat man ne þar in þe Tour berne Nouther torcher ne lanterne; Suche a pomel was þer bygone, Hit shyned a ny?t so doþ þe soone. Now arn in þat ilk Tour Twoo and fourty nobell boure; Wel were þat ilke man Þat my?t woone in þat oon! Ne durst him neuer more ywys Couete after more blysse. Naw arn þer Seriauntes in þat stage Þat seruen þe maydons of hy?e parage; But no serieaunt may serue þerynne Þat bereþ in his breche þat gynne To serue hem day and ny?t, But he be as a Capoun dy?t. At þe gate is a ?ateward; He is not a Coward; He is wonder proude with alle; Euery day he goþ in ryche palle. And þe Amyral haþ a wonder woon, Þat he þat is come of cristendome, Euery ?ere to haue a new wyf, Þen he loueþ his Queene as his lyf. Then shul men brynge doun of þe Toure Al þe Maidens of grete honour, And brynge hem into an Orchard, Þe feirest of al mydlerd: Þeryn is mony fowles song; Men my?t leue þeryn ful long: About þe Orchard is a walle,— Þe fowlest stone is Cristalle,— And a well spryngeþ þerynne, Þat is made with muche gynne; Þe wel is of muche prys, Þe stremes com froo Paradyse; Þe grauel of þe ground is precious stoones, And al of vertu for þe noones. Now is þe well of muche au?t; ?if a woman com þat is for-lau?t, And she be doo to þe streeme For to wesshe her honndes clene, Þe water wylle ?elle as it were wood, And bycome red as blood. On what maide þe water fareþ soo, Sone she shal to deþ be doo. Þoo þat ben maidens clene, Þey may wesshe þeryn, y wene; Þe water woll stonde feire and clere; To hem makeþ it no daungere. At þe walles hed stondeþ a tree, Þe feirest þat on erthe may be; It is cleped þe tree of loue: Flowers and blossomes spryngen aboue; Þen þey þat maydons clene bene, Þei shul be brou?t vnder þe trene, And which so falleþ þe floure, Shal be queene with muche honour. ?if any mayden þer is Þat þe Amyral telleþ of more pris, Þe flour shal be to her sent Þrou? art of enchauntement. Þe Amyral cheseþ hem by þe flour, And euer he herkeneþ after Blauncheflour. Thre sithes Flores sownyd anoon Ri?t byfore hem euerychoon: When he awoke, and speke my?t, Sore he wept, and sore he sy?t, And seide, “Dares, y worth now deed, But þat y hope of þe som reed.” “Leue soon, wyl ?e see Þat þy trust is muche on me; Þen is þe best reed þat y can— Other reed ne can y noon— Wende to-morn to þe toure As þou were a good gynoure; Take on þy honde squyer and scantlon As þou were a free mason; Behold þe tour vp and doun, Þe porter is cruel and Feloun; Wel sone he wyl come to the, And aske what maner man þou be, And bere on þe, Felonye, And sey þou art come to be a spye. And þow shalt answere swetlyche, And sey to him myldelyche, Sey þou art a gynoure, To beholde þat feire Toure, For to loke and for to fonde To make suche another in þy londe. Wel sone he wyl com þe nere, And wyl byd þe play at þe chekere. When þou art at cheker brou?t, Without seluer [be] þou nou?t; Þou shalt haue redy with the XX. Marke beside þy knee; ?if þou wynne ou?t of his, Þow tel þerof lytel prys; And yf he wynne ou?t of þyn, loke þow leue it with hym; So þou shalt, al with gynne, Þe porters loue forsoth wynne, Þat he þe help on þis day: But he þe helpe, no man may. Wel ?erne he wyl þe bydde and pray Come anoþer day to playe: Þou shalt seye þou wylt soo; Þou shalt take with þe suche twoo; Þe þrydde day take an hundred pound, And þy Coupe hool and sound: ?eue him markes &amp; poundes of þy male; Of þy tresour tel þou no tale; Wel ?erne he wyl þe bydde and pray To lay þy Coupe, and to play. Þou shalt answere alþerfirst, Lenger to play þe ne lyst. Ful muche he wylle for þe Coupe bede, ?if he my?t þe better spede; Þou shalt it blethly ?eue him ?if it be of gold fyne; And he wol ful moche loue þe, And to þe bowe also, parde, Þat he wyl falle to þy foote, And become þyn, ?if he moote. And homage þou shalt fonge, And þe trouþ of his honde.” As he seide, he dide ywys; And as he ordeynd, so it is: Þe Porter ys Florys man bycome, For his gold and his warysone. Florys seide, “now art þou my moon, Al my trust is þe vppon; Now my consel y wyl þe shewe; Rede me ry?t, ?if þou be trew. Now euery word he haþ him tolde, How þe mayde was fro him sholde, And how he was of Spayn a kynges soon, For grete loue þeder ycoom To fonden, with some gynne, Þat feire mayde for to wynne. Þe Porter þat herde, and sore sy?t, And seide, “y am betrayde ary?t; Þrou? þy Catel, y am dismayde; Þerfore y am wel euyl a-payde Now y woot how it gooþ; For þe shal y suffre deth; I shal þe faile neuer moo, Þe while y may ryde and goo; Þy forwardes shal y holde alle, What-so-euer may befalle. Wynde now hoom to þyn ynne While y beþenke me of sum gynne; Bytwene þis and þe þrydde day. Fonde y shal, what y do may. Flores spake and wept amonge And þou?t þe terme al to longe. Þe Porter þou?t þe best reed, And let geder floures in a meed; He wist it was þe maydons wylle. To lepes he lete of floures fylle: Þat was þe best reed, as him þou?t þoo, Floures in þat oon lep to doo. Twoo maydens þe lepe bore; So heuy charged neuer þey wore, And bade god ?eue hem euyl fyne; To mony floures he dide þerynne. To Blaunchefloures Chamber þey shulde tee; Þey ?ede to anoþer, and let þat be: Þey shuld haue gone to Blauncheflour, And ?ede to swete Clarys boure, And cursed him so fele brou?t to honde; Þey ?ede hoom, and lete hem stonde. Clarys to þe lepe come wolde, Þe Flores to hondel and to be-holde; Florys wende it hadde be his swete wy?t; Of þe lepe he stert vpry?t; And þe mayde, al for drede, Bygan to shrelle and to grede. When he saw? it was not shee, In-to þe lepe a?en stert he, And held him betrayde clene; Of his lyf tolde he not a beene. Þer come maydons, and to Clarys lepe by ten, by twelf, on an heepe And þey asked what hur were, And why she made suche a bere. Clarys byþou?t hur anoonery?t Þat hit was Blauncheflour þe white, And gaue þe Maydons answere anoon, Þat to her Chamber were goon, Þat to þe lepe come she wolde, Þe Flowres to hondel and to beholde; “And, or y it ere wyst, An Otter fley? a-geynst my brest: I was so soore a-drad þan, Þat y loude crye can.” Þe Maydons þerof hadden glee, And turned hem, and lete hur be. As sone as þe maydons were gon, To Blauncheflour she ?ede anoon, And seide boldly to Blauncheflour, “Felow, come and see a feire Flour! Suche a flour þe shal wel lyke, Haue þou it sene a lyte.” “Awey, Clarys!” quod Blauncheflour; “To scorne me, it is none honoure. I here, Clarys, without gabbe, Þat þe Amyral wyl me to wyf habbe; But þat day shal neuer be, Þat he shal euer haue me, Þat y shal be of loue so vntrewe, Ne chaunge my loue for no newe; For no loue, ne for noon aye, Forsake Florys in his Contraye. Now y shal swete Florys mysse, Ne shal noon other of me haue blysse.” Clarys stood and beheld þat rewth, And þe trewnesse of hur trewth, And seide, “lady Blaunchefloure, Goo we see þat ilk floure.” To þe lepe þey went both. Ioyful man was Florys þoo, For he had herde al þis. Of þat lepe he stert y-wys: Wel sone Blauncheflour chaunged hewe; Ayther of hem other knewe: Withoute speche togeder þey lepe, And klippt and kyst wonder swete. Clarys beheld al this, Her countenaunce and her blysse, And seide þen to Blaunchefloure, “Felow, knowist þou au?t þis flour? She shul konne ful muche of Art Þat þou woldest þerof geue part.” Now Blauncheflour and Florys, Boþ þese swete þinges ywys, Cryen her mercy, al wepyng, Þat she ne wrey hem to þe king. “Ne dou?t no more of me in alle, Þan it were myself byfalle. Wete ?e wel weturly, Heele y wyl ?oure drury.” To a bedde þey ben brou?t, Þat is of palle and of sylke wrou?t; And þere þey sette hem doun And drou? hem self al a room: Þer was no man þat my?t radde Þe ioye þat þey twoo madde. Florys þen to speke bygan, And seide, “lord þat madest man, I it þonke goddes sone Þat al my care I haue ouercome; Now my leue I haue y-founde, Of al my care y am vnbounde.” Clarys hem seruyd al at wylle, Boþ dernlyche and stylle. Larys with þe white syde Rose vp on morne tyde, And cleped after Blaunchefloure To wende with him in to þe Toure: She seide “y am commaund”; But her answere was slepaund. Þe Amyral had such a woone, Þat euery day shulde come Twoo maydons of hur bour Vp to him in to þe Toure, With water and clooth, and basyn, For to wesshe his hondes ynne: Þat day þey seruyd him feire; Anoþer day come another peire; But most were wonyd into þe Toure, Clarys and Blauncheflour. Clarys come þenne aloon: Þe Amyral asked a-noon, “Where is Blauncheflour so free? Why comeþ she not heder with þe?” “Sir,” she seide anoon ry?t, “She haþ wakyd al þis ny?t, And y-cryde and y-loke And y-redde on hur booke, And y-bede to god her orysoun Þat he geue þe his benysoun, And þat he holde long þy lyf; And now þe mayde slepeþ swyth; She slepeþ so fast, þat mayde swete, Þat she may not com ?ete.” “Certes,” seide þe kyng, “Now is she a swete þing: Wel au?t me ?erne her to wyf, Þat so preyeth for my lyf.” Anoþer day Clarys erly Aryst; Þat Blauncheflour well wyst, And seide, “y come anoon,” When Clarys her clepe bygan, And fel in a slepe newe. Sone after it made hem to rewe: Clarys to þe Pyler cam; A basyn of gold in hond she nam, And Cleped after Blaunchefloure To wende with hur in to þe Toure. Þe Amyral asked after Blauncheflour, “What! is she not come ?et? Now she me douteþ al to lyte.” Forþ he cleped his Chamburlayn, And bade him wende with his mayn To wete why she wyl not come As she was wonyd to doon. Þe Chamburlayn is forth noom; In to Chambre he is coom, And stondeþ byfore hur bedde, And fyndeþ þere, nebbe to nebbe, Nebbe to nebbe, and mouþ to mouþ. To þe Amyral it was sone couþ; Vp in to þe Toure he stey?, And told his lord al þat he sey?. Þe Amyral late him his swerd brynge, For wete he wolde of þat tydynge: He went to hem þere þey lay: ?it was she a-slepe þere ay. The Amyral lete þe clothes doun cast A lytel by-nethe hur brest, And sone he knew anoon Þat oon was woman, &amp; þat oþer groom. He quaked for tene þere he stood; Hem to sloon was in his mood; ?it he þou?t, or he hem quelde, What þey were, þey shuld him telle, And seth he wyl with dome hem done. Þe Children wakyd swyth soone, And saw þe swerde ouer hem drawe; Þey ben adrad, and in aw?e. Þan seide Florys to Blauncheflour, “Of oure lyf is no socour.” But þey cryde him mercy swyth, For to length her lyue. Vp he bade hem sytte booth, And do on boþ her cloþ; Seþ he dide hem bynde fast, And in prison lete hem be cast. Now haþ he after his Barons sent, To wreke him after Iugement, Now han þe Barons vndernome, And to þe Amyral þey ben coome. He stood vp a-monge hem al, With semblant wroþ withalle, And seide: “Lordynges, with much honour, ?e herde speke of Blauncheflour, Þat y bou?t hur dere a ply?t For seuen sithes of golde hur wy?t; For y wende with-out wene Þat feire mayde to haue had to Quene. Among my maydons in my Toure I hur dide, with muche honoure; Byfore her bedde my self y coom; I fonde þeryn a naked man. Þan were þey to me so looþ, I þou?t to haue sleyn hem booþ, I was so wroþ and so wood. ?it y withdrow? myn hoot blood Tyl y haue sende after ?ow, by assent, To wreke me with Iugement. Now ?it ?e woot how it is goon, Wreke me soon of my foon.” Þan spake a kyng of þat londe, “We haue herd al þis shame and shonde; But, or we hem to deth deme, Lat vs hem see, ?if it þe Queeme, What þey wolde speke or sygge, ?if þey wyl au?t ageyn vs legge: Hit were nou?t ry?t iugement, Without answere make acoupement. Til þis is herde of more and lasse, What myster is, to bere wytnesse?” After þe Children haue þey sent,— To brenne hem was his entent;— Two serieauntes hem gan brynge Toward hur al wepynge. Drery booþ þese children goo; Ayther bemeneþ oþeris woo. Þan seide Florys to Blauncheflour, “Of oure lyf is no socour: Yf kinde of man it þole my?t, Twyes y shuld dye with ry?t, Oones for my self, anoþer for the, For, þy deeþ þou hast for me.’ Blauncheflour seyde þoo, “Þe gylt is myn, of oure woo.” Florys drou? forþ þat ryng Þat his moder him gaff at her partyng: “Haue þis ryng, lemman myne; Þou shalt not dye while it is þyne.” Blaunchefloure seide þoo, “So ne shal it neuer goo, Þat þis ryng shal help me, And þe deed on þe see.” Florys þat ryng hur rau?t, And she it him agayn betau?t, Nouther ne wyl other deed seene; Þey let it falle hem bytwene; A king com after; a ryng he fonde, And brou?t it forth in his honde. Þus þe Children wepyng com To þe fire and hur doom. Byfore þe folk þey were brou?t; Drery was her bothes þou?t; Þere was noon so sterne man Þat þe Children loked oon, Þat þey ne wolde, al wel fawe, Her iugement haue withdrawe, And with grete Catel hem bygge, ?if þey durst speke or sygge; For Flores was so feire a ?onglyng, And Blaunchefloure so swete a þing, Þer wyst no man whor hem were woo, For no semblaunt þat þey made þoo. Þe Admyral was so wood, Ne my?t he nou?t kele his hoot blood; He bade þe Children fast be bound, And in to þe fire slong. Þat ilke king þat þe ryng fond, To Amyral he spake and round, And wolde hem saue to þe lyf, And told how for þe ryng þey gon stryf. Þe Amyral lete hem ageyn clepe, For he wolde here hem speke, And asked Florys what he heete: And he tolde him ful skeete: “Sir,” he seide, “yf it were þy wylle, Þou ne getest not þat maide to spylle; But, good sir, quel þou me, And lete þat maide on lyue be.” Blauncheflour seide byne, “Þe gilt of oure dedes is moyne.” Þe Admyral seide þoo “I-wys ?e shul dye boo.” His swerd he breide out of his sheeth, Þe Children to haue done to deeth. Blaunchefloure put forþ hur swire, And Florys dide her agayn to tyre, And seide, “I am man; I shal byfore, With wrong hast þou þy lyf loore.” Florys forth his swerd putte, And Blauncheflour agayn him tytte. Þe king seide, “dredry mot ?e be, Þis rouþ by þis Children to see.” Þe king þat þe ryng hadde, For routh of hem sone he radde, And at þe Amyral wyl he spede, Þe Children fro þe deþ to lede. “Sir,” he seide, “it is lytel prys, Þese Children for to slee y-wys; And it is wel more worship, Florys counsel þat ?e weete, Who him tau?t þat ilke gynne, Þy toure for to come ynne, And who him brou?t þare, And other, þat ?e may be ware.” Þan seide þe Amyral, “as god me saue, Florys shal his lyf haue, ?if he me telle who him tau?t þerto, Of Florys, þat shal y neuer doo.” Now þey bydden al y-wys Þat þe Admyral graunted þis, To for?eue þat trespas ?if Florys told how it was. Now euery word he haþ him tolde, How þat maide was for him solde, And how he was of spayn a kynges sone, For grete loue þeder y-come, For to fonde, with sum gynne, Þat feire maide for to wynne, And how þe porter was his man bycome, For his gold and for his warysoun, And how he was in þe Florys borne. Alle þe lordinges low? þerforne: Now þe Admyral wol him tyde; Florys setteþ next his syde, And efte he made him stonde vpry?t, And dubbed him þere kny?t, And bade he shulde with him be, Þe furthermost of his meyne. Florys falleþ doun to his feet, And prayeþ geue him his sweet. Þe Amyral gaf him his lemman: Al þat þere were, þankyd him þanne. To a Chirche he let hem brynge, And dede let wed hem with a rynge. Boþ þese twoo swete þinges y-wys Fel his feet for to kysse; And þrou? consel of Blauncheflour, Clarys was fet doun of þe Toure, And Amyral wedded hur to queene. Þere was fest swythe breeme; I can not telle al þe sonde, But rycher fest was neuer in londe. Was it nou?t longe after þan, Þat to Florys tydyng cam, Þat þe king his Fader was deed. Þe Baronage gaf him reed Þat he shuld wende hoom, And fonge his feire kyngdoom. At þe Amyral þey toke leue, And he byddeþ þem byleue. Home he went with royal array, And was crownyd with-in a short day.</field>
