Trew king, Ã¾at sittes in trone, Vnto Ã¾e I tell my tale, And vnto Ã¾e I bid a bone, For Ã¾ou ert bute of all my bale. Als Ã¾ou made midelerd and Ã¾e mone And bestes and fowles grete and smale, Vnto me send Ã¾i socore sone And dresce my dedes in Ã¾is dale. In Ã¾is dale I droupe and dare For dern dedes Ã¾at done me dere. Of Ingland had my hert grete care When Edward founded first to were. Ãe Franche men war frek to fare Ogaines him, with scheld and spere; Ãai turned ogayn with sides sare, And al Ã¾aire pomp noght worth a pere. A pere of prise es more sum tyde Ãan all Ã¾e boste of Normondye. Ãai sent Ã¾aire schippes on ilka side With flesch and wine and whete &amp; rye. With hert and hand, es noght at hide, For to help Scotland gan Ã¾ai hye: Ãai fled, and durst no dede habide, And all Ã¾aire fare noght wurth a flye. ffor all Ã¾aire fare Ã¾ai durst noght fight, For dedes dint had Ã¾ai slike dout; Of Scotland had Ã¾ai neuer sight Ay whils Ã¾ai war of wordes stout. Ãai wald haue mend Ã¾am at Ã¾aire might And besy war Ã¾ai Ã¾areobout. Now God help Edward in his right, Amen, and all his redy rowt. His redy rout mot Ihesu spede And saue Ã¾am both by night and day; Ãat lord of heuyn mot Edward lede And maintene him als he wele may. Ãe Scottes now all wide will sprede For Ã¾ai haue failed of Ã¾aire pray; Now er Ã¾ai dareand all for drede Ãat war bifore so stout and gay. Gai Ã¾ai war and wele Ã¾ai thoght On Ã¾e Erle Morre and oÃ¾er ma; Ãai said it suld ful dere be boght Ãe land Ã¾at Ã¾ai war flemid fra. Philip Valays wordes wroght And said he suld Ã¾aire enmys sla; Bot all Ã¾aire wordes was for noght, Ãai mun be met if Ã¾ai war ma. Ma manasinges ?it haue Ã¾ai maked, Mawgre mot Ã¾ai haue to mede. And many nightes als haue Ã¾ai waked To dere all Ingland with Ã¾aire dede. Bot, loued be God, Ã¾e pride es slaked Of Ã¾am Ã¾at war so stout on stede, And sum of Ã¾am es leuid all naked Noght fer fro Berwik opon Twede. A litell fro Ã¾at forsaid toune Halydon hill Ã¾at es Ã¾e name, Ãare was crakked many a crowne Of wild Scottes and alls of tame: Ãare was Ã¾aire baner born all doune; To mak slike boste Ã¾ai war to blame: Bot neuer Ã¾e les ay er Ã¾ai boune To wait Ingland with sorow and schame. Shame Ã¾ai haue als I here say; At Donde now es done Ã¾aire daunce, And wend Ã¾ai most anoÃ¾er way Euyn thurgh Flandres into France. On Filip Valas fast cri Ã¾ai Ãare for to dwell and him avaunce; And no thing list Ã¾am Ã¾an of play Sen Ã¾am es tide Ã¾is sary chance. Ãis sary chaunce Ã¾am es bitid, For Ã¾ai war fals and wonder fell; For cursed caitefes er Ã¾ai kid And ful of treson, suth to tell. Sir Ion Ã¾e Comyn had Ã¾ai hid, In haly kirk Ã¾ai did him qwell; And Ã¾arfore many a Skottis brid With dole er dight Ã¾at Ã¾ai most dwell. Ãare dwelled oure king, Ã¾e suth to saine, With his men?e a litell while; He gaf gude confort on Ã¾at plaine To all his men obout a myle. All if his men war mekill of maine Euer Ã¾ai douted Ã¾am of gile; Ãe Scottes gaudes might no thing gain, For all Ã¾ai stumbilde at Ã¾at stile. Ãus in Ã¾at stowre Ã¾ai left Ã¾aire liue Ãat war bifore so proud in prese. Ihesu, for Ã¾i woundes fiue, In Ingland help vs to haue pese. II [Now for to tell ?ow will I turn] Now for to tell ?ow will I turn Of Ã¾e batayl of Banocburn. Skottes out of Berwik and of Abirdene, At Ã¾e Bannok burn war ?e to kene; Ãare slogh ?e many sakles, als it was sene, And now has king Edward wroken it, I wene, It es wrokin, I wene, wele wurth Ã¾e while; War ?it with Ã¾e Skottes for Ã¾ai er ful of gile. Whare er ?e, Skottes of Saint Iohnes toune? Ãe boste of ?owre baner es betin all doune; When ?e bosting will bede sir Edward es boune For to kindel ?ow care and crak ?owre crowne: He has crakked ?owre croune, wele worth Ã¾e while; Schame bityde Ã¾e Skottes for Ã¾ai er full of gile. Skottes of Striflin war steren and stout; Of God ne of gude men had Ã¾ai no dout; Now haue Ã¾ai, Ã¾e pelers, priked obout; Bot at Ã¾e last sir Edward rifild Ã¾aire rout, He has rifild Ã¾aire rout, wele wurth Ã¾e while, Bot euer er Ã¾ai vnder, bot gaudes and gile. Rughfute riueling, now kindels Ã¾i care, Berebag with Ã¾i boste, Ã¾i biging es bare Fals wretche and forsworn whider wiltou fare? Busk Ã¾e vnto Brug and abide Ã¾are; Ãare, wretche, saltou won and wery Ã¾e while; Ãi dwelling in Donde es done for Ã¾i gile. Ãe Skotte gase in Burghes and betes Ã¾e stretes, All Ã¾ise Inglis men harmes he hetes; Fast makes he his mone to men Ã¾at he metes, Bot fone frendes he findes Ã¾at his bale betes: Fune betes his bale, wele wurth Ã¾e while, He vses all threting with gaudes and gile. Bot many man thretes and spekes ful ill Ãat sum tyme war better to be stane still; Ãe Skot in his wordes has wind for to spill, For at Ã¾e last Edward sall haue al his will: He had his will at Berwik, wele wurth Ã¾e while; Skottes broght him Ã¾e kayes, bot get for Ã¾aire gile. III [How Edward Ã¾e king come in Braband] How Edward Ã¾e king come in Braband And toke homage of all Ã¾e land. God Ã¾at schope both se and sand Saue Edward king of Ingland, Both body, saul and life, And grante him ioy withowten strif: For mani men to him er wroth In Fraunce and in Flandres both: For he defendes fast his right, And Ã¾arto Ihesu grante him might, And so to do both night and day, Ãat yt may be to Goddes pay. Oure king was cumen, trewly to tell, Into Brabant for to dwell. Ãe kayser Lowis of Bauere, Ãat in Ã¾at land Ã¾an had no pere, He and als his sons two And oÃ¾er princes many mo, Bisschoppes and prelates war Ã¾are fele Ãat had ful mekill werldly wele, Princes and pople, ald and ?ong Al Ã¾at spac with Duche tung, All Ã¾ai come with grete honowre Sir Edward to saue and socoure, And proferd him, with all Ã¾ayre rede, For to hald Ã¾e kinges stede. Ãe duke of Braband, first of all, Swore, for thing Ã¾at might bifall, Ãat he suld, both day and night, Help sir Edward in his right, In toun, in feld, in frith and fen; Ãis swore Ã¾e duke and all his men And al Ã¾e lordes Ã¾at with him lend And Ã¾arto held Ã¾ai vp Ã¾aire hend. Ãan king Edward toke his rest At Andwerp, whare him liked best; And Ã¾are he made his mone playne Ãat no man suld say Ã¾are ogayne; His mone Ã¾at was gude and lele, Left in Braband ful mekill dele; And all Ã¾at land vntill Ã¾is day Fars Ã¾e better for Ã¾at iornay. When Philip Ã¾e Valas herd of Ã¾is, Ãarat he was ful wroth, i-wis; He gert assemble his barounes Princes and lordes of many tounes. At Pariss toke Ã¾ai Ã¾aire counsaile Whilk pointes might Ã¾am moste availe; And in all wise Ã¾ai Ã¾am bithoght To stroy Ingland and bring to noght. Schipmen sone war efter sent To here Ã¾e kinges cumandment; And Ã¾e galaies men also Ãat wist both of wele and wo. He cumand Ã¾an Ã¾at men suld fare Till Ingland, and for no thing spare Bot brin and sla both man and wife And childe, Ã¾at none suld pas with life: Ãe galay men held vp Ã¾aire handes And thanked God of Ã¾ir tiÃ¾andes. At Hamton, als I vnderstand, Come Ã¾e gaylayes vnto land, And ful fast Ã¾ai slogh and brend, Bot noght so mekill als sum men wend; For, or Ã¾ai wened, war Ã¾ai mett With men Ã¾at sone Ã¾aire laykes lett. Sum was knokked on Ã¾e heuyd Ãat Ã¾e body Ã¾are bileuid; Sum lay stareand on Ã¾e sternes, And sum lay knoked out Ã¾aire hernes: Ãan with Ã¾am was none oÃ¾er gle, Bot ful fain war Ã¾ai Ã¾at might fle. Ãe galay men, Ã¾e suth to say, Most nedes turn anoÃ¾er way; Ãai soght Ã¾e stremis fer and wide In Flandres and in Seland syde. Ãan saw Ã¾ai whare Cristofer stode At Armouth, opon Ã¾e flude; Ãan went Ã¾ai Ã¾eder all bidene Ãe galayes men with hertes kene, Viij. and xl. galays and mo, And with Ã¾am als war tarettes two, And oÃ¾er many of galiotes, With grete noumber of smale botes; All Ã¾ai houed on Ã¾e flode To stele sir Edward mens gode. Edward oure king Ã¾an was noght Ã¾ere, Bot sone when it come to his ere, He sembled all his men full still And said to Ã¾am what was his will. Ilk man made him redy Ã¾en, So went Ã¾e king and all his men Vnto Ã¾aire schippes ful hastily Als men Ã¾at war in dede doghty. Ãai fand Ã¾e galay men grete wane A hundereth euer ogaynes ane; Ãe Inglis men put Ã¾am to were Ful baldly, with bow and spere; Ãai slogh Ã¾are of Ã¾e galaies men Euer sexty ogaynes ten, Ãat sum ligges ?it in Ã¾at mire All heuidles, with owten hire, Ãe Inglis men war armed wele Both in yren and in stele; Ãai faght ful fast both day and night Als lang als Ã¾am lasted might; Bot galay men war so many Ãat Inglis men wex all wery: Help Ã¾ai soght, bot Ã¾are come nane; Ãan vnto God Ã¾ai made Ã¾aire mane. Bot, sen Ã¾e time Ã¾at God was born Ne a hundreth ?ere biforn War neuer men better in fight Ãan Ingliss men, whils Ã¾ai had myght. Bot sone all maistri gan Ã¾ai mis. God bring Ã¾aire saules vntill his blis, And God assoyl Ã¾am of Ã¾aire sin For Ã¾e gude will Ã¾at Ã¾ai war in. Amen. Listens now, and leues me, Who so lifes Ã¾ai sall se Ãat it mun be ful dere boght Ãat Ã¾ir galay men haue wroght. Ãai houed still opon Ã¾e flode And reued pouer men Ã¾aire gude: Ãai robbed and did mekill schame, And ay bare Inglis men Ã¾e blame. Now Ihesus saue all Ingland And blis it with his haly hand. Amen. IV [Edward oure cumly king] Edward oure cumly king In Braband has his woning, With mani cumly knight; And in Ã¾at land, trewly to tell, Ordanis he still for to dwell, To time he think to fight. Now God Ã¾at es of mightes maste Grant him grace of Ã¾e Haly Gaste His heritage to win. And Mari moder, of mercy fre, Saue oure king and his men?e Fro sorow, and schame and syn. Ãus in Braband has he bene, Whare he bifore was seldom sene, For to proue Ã¾aire iapes; Now no langer wil he spare, Bot vnto Fraunce fast will he fare, To confort him with grapes. ffurth he ferd into France; God saue him fro mischance, And all his cumpany. Ãe nobill duc of Braband With him went into Ã¾at land, Redy to lif or dy. Ãan Ã¾e riche floure de lice Wan Ã¾are ful litill prise; Fast he fled for ferde. Ãe right aire of Ã¾at cuntre Es cumen, with all his knightes fre: To schac him by Ã¾e berd. Sir Philip Ã¾e Valayse, Wit his men in Ã¾o dayes, To batale had he thoght: He bad his men Ã¾am puruay, With owten lenger delay, Bot he ne held it noght. He broght folk ful grete wone, Ay seuyn oganis one, Ãat ful wele wapnid were: Bot sone when he herd ascry Ãat king Edward was nere Ã¾arby, Ãan durst he noght cum nere. In Ã¾at morning fell a myst, And when oure Ingliss men it wist, It changed all Ã¾aire chere; Oure king vnto God made his bone, And God sent him gude confort sone, Ãe weder wex ful clere. Oure king and his men held Ã¾e felde Stalwortly, with spere and schelde, And thoght to win his right, With lordes and with knightes kene And oÃ¾er doghty men bydene, Ãat war ful frek to fight. When sir Philip of France herd tell Ãat king Edward in feld walld dwell, Ãan gayned him no gle; He traisted of no better bote, Bot both on hors and on fote He hasted him to fle. It semid he was ferd for strokes When he did fell his grete okes Obout his pauilyoune; Abated was Ã¾an all his pride, For langer Ã¾are durst he noght bide, His bost was broght all doune. Ãe king of Beme had cares colde, Ãat was ful hardy and bolde A stede to vmstride. He and Ã¾e king als of Nauerne War faire feld in Ã¾e ferene Ãaire heuiddes for to hide. And leues wele it es no lye, Ãe felde hat fflemangrye Ãat king Edward was in, With princes Ã¾at war stif ande bolde And dukes Ã¾at war doghty tolde In batayle to bigin. Ãe princes Ã¾at war riche on raw Gert nakers strike, and trumpes blaw. And made mirth at Ã¾aire might: Both alblast and many a bow War redy railed opon a row, And ful frek for to fight. Gladly Ã¾ai gaf mete and drink So Ã¾at Ã¾ai suld Ã¾e better swink Ãe wight men Ã¾at Ã¾ar ware. Sir Philip of Fraunce fled for dout, And hied him hame with all his rout: Coward, God giff him care. ffor Ã¾are Ã¾an had Ã¾e lely flowre Lorn all halely his honowre, Ãat sogat fled for ferd: Bot oure king Edward come ful still, When Ã¾at he trowed no harm him till, And keped him in Ã¾e berde. V [Lithes and Ã¾e batail I sal bigyn] Lithes and Ã¾e batail I sal bigyn Of Inglisch men &amp; Normandes in Ã¾e Swyn. Minot with mowth had menid to make Suth sawes &amp; sad for sum mens sake; Ãe wordes of sir Edward makes me to wake, Wald he salue vs sone mi sorow suld slake; War mi sorow slaked sune wald I sing: When God will sir Edward sal vs bute bring. Sir Philip Ã¾e Valas cast was in care; And said sir Hugh Kyret to Flandres suld fare, And haue Normondes inogh to leue on his lare, All Flandres to brin and mak it all bare; Bot, vnkind coward, wo was him Ã¾are: When he sailed in Ã¾e Swin it sowed him sare; Sare it Ã¾am smerted Ã¾at ferd out of ffrance; Ãare lered Inglis men Ã¾am a new daunce. Ãe buriase of Bruge ne war noght to blame; I pray Ihesu saue Ã¾am fro sin and fro schame, For Ã¾ai war sone at Ã¾e Sluse all by a name, Whare many of Ã¾e Normandes tok mekill grame. When Bruges and Ipyre hereof herd tell, Ãai sent Edward to wit Ã¾at was in Arwell; Ãan had he no liking langer to dwell, He hasted him to Ã¾e Swin with sergantes snell, To mete with Ã¾e Normandes Ã¾at fals war &amp; fell, Ãat had ment if Ã¾ai might al Flandres to quell. King Edward vnto sail was ful sune dight With erles and barons and many kene knight: Ãai come byfor Blankebergh on Saint Ions night; Ãat was to Ã¾e Normondes a well sary sight. ?it trumped Ã¾ai and daunced with torches ful bright, In Ã¾e wilde waniand was Ã¾aire hertes light. Opon Ã¾e morn efter, if I suth say, A meri man, sir Robard out of Morlay, At half eb in Ã¾e Swin soght he Ã¾e way; Ãare lered men Ã¾e Normandes at bukler to play; Helpid Ã¾am no prayer Ã¾at Ã¾ai might pray; Ãe wreches er wonnen, Ã¾aire wapin es oway. Ãe Erle of Norhamton helpid at Ã¾at nede, Als wise man of wordes and worthli in wede, Sir Walter Ã¾e Mawnay, God gif him mede, Was bold of body in batayl to bede. Ãe duc of Lankaster was dight for to driue, With mani mody man Ã¾at thoght for to thriue, Wele &amp; stalworthly stint he Ã¾at striue, Ãat few of Ã¾e Normandes left Ã¾ai oliue; Fone left Ã¾ai oliue bot did Ã¾am to lepe; Men may find by Ã¾e flode a .C. on hepe. Sir Wiliam of Klinton was eth for to knaw; Mani stout bachilere broght he on raw. It semid with Ã¾aire schoting als it war snaw; Ãe bost of Ã¾e Normandes broght Ã¾ai ful law; Ãaire bost was abated and Ã¾aire mekil pride, Fer might Ã¾ai noght fle bot Ã¾are bud Ã¾am bide. Ãe gude Erle of Glowceter, God mot him glade, Broght many bold men with bowes ful brade; To biker with Ã¾e Normandes baldely Ã¾ai bade And in middes Ã¾e flode did Ã¾am to wade; To wade war Ã¾o wretches casten in Ã¾e brim; Ãe kaitefs come out of France at lere Ã¾am to swim. I prays Iohn Badding als one of Ã¾e best; Faire come he sayland out of Ã¾e suthwest, To proue of Ã¾a Normandes was he ful prest, Till he had foghten his fill he had neuer rest. Iohn of Aile of Ã¾e Sluys with scheltron ful schene Was comen into Cagent, cantly and kene, Bot sone was his trumping turned to tene; Of him had sir Edward his will als I wene. Ãe schipmen of Ingland sailed ful swith Ãat none of Ã¾e Normandes fro Ã¾am might skrith. Who so kouth wele his craft Ã¾are might it kith: Of al Ã¾e gude Ã¾at Ã¾ai gat gaf Ã¾ai no tithe. Two hundreth and mo schippes on Ã¾e sandes Had oure Inglis men won with Ã¾aire handes; Ãe kogges of Ingland war broght out of bandes, And also Ã¾e Cristofir Ã¾at in Ã¾e streme standes; In Ã¾at stound Ã¾ai stode, with stremers ful still, Til Ã¾ai wist full wele sir Edwardes will. Sir Edward, oure gude king wurthi in wall, Faght wele on Ã¾at flude, faire mot him fall; Als it es custom of king to confort Ã¾am all So thanked he gudely Ã¾e grete and Ã¾e small, He thanked Ã¾am gudely, God gif him mede, Ãus come oure king in Ã¾e Swin till Ã¾at gude dede. Ãis was Ã¾e bataile Ã¾at fell in Ã¾e Swin, Whare many Normandes made mekill din; Wele war Ã¾ai armed vp to Ã¾e chin; Bot God and sir Edward gert Ã¾aire boste blin, Ãus blinned Ã¾aire boste, als we wele ken: God assoyle Ã¾aire sawls, sais all, Amen.

If ?e will trow my tale, A duke tuke leue Ã¾at tide, A Braban brwed Ã¾at bale, He bad no langer bide; Giftes grete and smale War sent him on his side; Gold gert all Ã¾at gale And made him rapely ride Till dede: In hert he was vnhale; He come Ã¾are moste for mede.

VII [How Edward at Hogges vnto land wan] How Edward at Hogges vnto land wan And rade thurgh France or euer he blan. Men may rede in romance right Of a grete clerk Ã¾at Merlin hight; Ful many bokes er of him wreten, Als Ã¾ir clerkes wele may witten; And ?it in many priue nokes May men find of Merlin bokes. Merlin said Ã¾us with his mowth, Out of Ã¾e north into Ã¾e sowth Suld cum a bare ouer Ã¾e se Ãat suld mak many man to fle; And in Ã¾e se, he said ful right, Suld he schew ful mekill might; And in France he suld bigin To mak Ã¾am wrath Ã¾at er Ã¾arein; Vntill Ã¾e se his taile reche sale All folk of France to mekill bale. Ãus haue I mater for to make, For a nobill prince sake: Help me, God, my wit es thin, Now Laurence Minot will bigin. A bore es broght on bankes bare With ful batail bifor his brest; For Iohn of France will he noght spare In Normondy to tak his rest, With princes Ã¾at er proper and prest: Alweldand God of mightes maste, He be his beld, for he mai best, Fader and Sun and Haly Gaste. Haly Gaste, Ã¾ou gif him grace, Ãat he in gude time may bigin, And send to him both might &amp; space His heritage wele for to win; And sone assoyl him of his sin, Hende God, Ã¾at heried hell. For France now es he entred in, And Ã¾are he dightes him for to dwell. He dwelled Ã¾are, Ã¾e suth to tell, Opon Ã¾e coste of Normondy; At Hogges fand he famen fell Ãat war all ful of felony: To him Ã¾ai makked grete maistri, And proued to ger Ã¾e bare abyde; Thurgh might of God &amp; mild Mari Ãe bare abated all Ã¾aire pride. Mekill pride was Ã¾are in prese, Both on pencell and on plate, When Ã¾e bare rade, with outen rese, Vnto Cane Ã¾e graythest gate. Ãare fand he folk bifor Ã¾e ?ate Thretty thowsand stif on stede: Sir Iohn of France come al to late, Ãe bare has gert Ã¾aire sides blede. He gert Ã¾am blede if Ã¾ai war bolde, For Ã¾are was slayne and wounded sore Thretty thowsand, trewly tolde, Of pitaile was Ã¾are mekill more; Knightes war Ã¾are wele two score Ãat war new dubbed to Ã¾at dance, Helm and heuyd Ã¾ai haue forlore: Ãan misliked Iohn of France. More misliking was Ã¾are Ã¾en, For fals treson alway Ã¾ai wroght; Bot, fro Ã¾ai met with Inglis men, All Ã¾aire bargan dere Ã¾ai boght. Inglis men with site Ã¾am soght And hastily quit Ã¾am Ã¾aire hire; And at Ã¾e last forgat Ã¾ai noght, Ãe toun of Cane Ã¾ai sett on fire. Ãat fire ful many folk gan fere, When Ã¾ai se brandes o-ferrum flye; Ãis haue Ã¾ai wonen of Ã¾e were, Ãe fals folk of Normundy. I sai ?ow lely how Ã¾ai lye Dongen doun all in a daunce; Ãaire frendes may ful faire forÃ¾i Pleyn Ã¾am vntill Iohn of France. ffranche men put Ã¾am to pine At Cressy, when Ã¾ai brak Ã¾e brig; Ãat saw Edward with both his ine, Ãan likid him no langer to lig. Ilk Inglis man on oÃ¾ers rig Ouer Ã¾at water er Ã¾ai went; To batail er Ã¾ai baldly big, With brade ax and with bowes bent. With bent bowes Ã¾ai war ful bolde For to fell of Ã¾e Frankisch men; Ãai gert Ã¾am lig with cares colde; Ful sari was sir Philip Ã¾en. He saw Ã¾e toun o-ferrum bren, And folk for ferd was fast fleand; Ãe teres he lete ful rathly ren Out of his eghen, I vnderstand. Ãan come Philip ful redy dight Toward Ã¾e toun with all his rowt, With him come mani a kumly knight, And all vmset Ã¾e bare obout. Ãe bare made Ã¾am ful law to lout, And delt Ã¾am knokkes to Ã¾aire mede; He gert Ã¾am stumbill Ã¾at war stout, Ãare helpid nowÃ¾er staf ne stede. Stedes strong bileuid still Biside Cressy opon Ã¾e grene; Sir Philip wanted all his will, Ãat was wele on his sembland sene. With spere and schelde and helmis schene Ãe bare Ã¾an durst Ã¾ai noght habide: Ãe king of Beme was cant and kene, Bot Ã¾are he left both play and pride. Pride in prese ne prais I noght Omang Ã¾ir princes prowd in pall; Princes suld be wele bithoght, When kinges Ã¾am till counsail call. If he be rightwis king, Ã¾ai sall Maintene him both night and day, Or els to lat his frendschip fall On faire manere, and fare oway. Oway es all Ã¾i wele, i-wis, Franche man, with all Ã¾i fare; Of murning may Ã¾ou neuer mys, For Ã¾ou ert cumberd all in care: With speche ne moght Ã¾ou neuer spare To speke of Ingliss men despite; Now haue Ã¾ai made Ã¾i biging bare, Of all Ã¾i catell ertou quite. Quite ertou, Ã¾at wele we knaw, Of catell and of drewris dere; Ãarfore lies Ã¾i hert ful law, Ãat are was blith als brid on brere. Inglis men sall ?it to ?ere Knok Ã¾i palet or Ã¾ou pas, And mak Ã¾e polled like a frere: And ?it es Ingland als it was. Was Ã¾ou noght, Franceis, with Ã¾i wapin Bitwixen Cressy and Abuyle? Whare Ã¾i felaws lien and gapin, For all Ã¾aire treget and Ã¾aire gile. Bisschoppes war Ã¾are in Ã¾at while Ãat songen all withouten stole: Philip Ã¾e Valas was a file, He fled and durst noght tak his dole. Men delid Ã¾are ful mani a dint Omang Ã¾e gentill Geneuayse; Ful many man Ã¾aire liues tint For luf of Philip Ã¾e Valays. Vnkind he was and vncurtayse, I prais no thing his puruiance; Ãe best of France and of Artayse War al to-dongyn in Ã¾at daunce. Ãat daunce with treson was bygun To trais Ã¾e bare with sum fals gyn: Ãe Franche men said, All es wun, Now es it tyme Ã¾at we bigin, For here es welth inogh to win, To make vs riche for euermore: Bot, thurgh Ã¾aire armure thik and thin Slaine Ã¾ai war, and wounded sore. Sore Ã¾an sighed sir Philip; Now wist he neuer what him was best, For he es cast doun with a trip: In Iohn of France es all his trest, For he was his frend faithfulest, In him was full his affiance: Bot sir Edward wald neuer rest, Or Ã¾ai war feld Ã¾e best of France. Of France was mekill wo, i-wis, And in Paris Ã¾a high palays: Now had Ã¾e bare with mekill blis Bigged him bifor Calais. Heres now how Ã¾e romance sais How sir Edward, oure king with croune, Held his sege bi nightes and dais With his men bifor Calays toune. VIII. [How Edward als Ã¾e romance sais] [VII b] How Edward als Ã¾e romance sais Held his sege bifor Calais. Calays men, now mai ?e care, And murning mun ?e haue to mede; Mirth on mold get ?e no mare; Sir Edward sall ken ?ow ?owre crede.

In bataill dar he wele habide Sir Philip and sir Iohn of France. Ãe Franche men er fers and fell And mase grete dray when Ã¾ai er dight; Of Ã¾am men herd slike tales tell With Edward think Ã¾ai for to fight, Him for to hald out of his right And do him treson with Ã¾aire tales; Ãat was Ã¾aire purpos day and night Bi counsail of Ã¾e Cardinales. Cardinales with hattes rede War fro Calays wele thre myle; Ãai toke Ã¾aire counsail in Ã¾at stede How Ã¾ai might sir Edward bigile. Ãai lended Ã¾are bot litill while Till Franche men to grante Ã¾aire grace; Sir Philip was sunden a file, He fled and faght noght in Ã¾at place. In Ã¾at place Ã¾e bare was blith, For all was funden Ã¾at he had soght: Philip Ã¾e Valas fled ful swith With Ã¾e batail Ã¾at he had broght. For to haue Calays had he thoght All at his ledeing loud or still; Bot all Ã¾aire wiles war for noght, Edward wan it at his will. [VII c] Lystens now, and ?e may lere, Als men Ã¾e suth may vnderstand, Ãe knightes Ã¾at in Calais were Come to sir Edward sare wepeand, In kirtell one and swerd in hand And cried, Sir Edward, Ã¾ine we are, Do now, lord, bi law of land Ãi will with vs for euermare. Ãe nobill burgase and Ã¾e best Come vnto him to haue Ã¾aire hire; Ãe comun puple war ful prest Rapes to bring obout Ã¾aire swire: Ãai said all, Sir Philip oure syre, And his sun, sir Iohn of France, Has left vs ligand in Ã¾e mire And broght vs till Ã¾is doleful dance.

IX [Sir Dauid had of his men grete loss] Sir Dauid had of his men grete loss With sir Edward at Ã¾e Neuil cross. Sir Dauid Ã¾e Bruse was at distance, When Edward Ã¾e Baliolfe rade with his lance; Ãe north end of Ingland teched him to daunce, When he was met on Ã¾e more with mekill mischance. Sir Philip Ã¾e Valayse may him noght avance; Ãe flowres Ã¾at faire war er fallen in ffraunce, Ãe floures er now fallen Ã¾at fers war and fell; A bare with his bataille has done Ã¾am to dwell. Sir Dauid Ã¾e Bruse said he suld fonde To ride thurgh all Ingland, wald he noght wonde; At Ã¾e Westminster hall suld his stedes stonde, Whils oure king Edward war out of Ã¾e londe: Bot now has sir Dauid missed of his merkes And Philip Ã¾e Valays with all Ã¾aire grete clerkes. Sir Philip Ã¾e Valais, suth for to say, Sent vnto sir Dauid and faire gan him pray At ride thurgh Ingland Ã¾aire fomen to flay, And said none es at home to let hym Ã¾e way, None letes him Ã¾e way to wende whore he will: Bot with schipherd staues fand he his fill. ffro Philip Ã¾e Valais was sir Dauid sent All Ingland to win fro Twede vnto Trent; He broght mani berebag with bow redy bent; Ãai robbed and Ã¾ai reued and held Ã¾at Ã¾ai hent; It was in Ã¾e waniand Ã¾at Ã¾ai furth went; For couaitise of cataile Ã¾o schrewes war schent; Schent war Ã¾o schrewes and ailed vnsele, For at Ã¾e Neuil cros nedes bud Ã¾am knele. At Ã¾e ersbisschop of ?ork now will I bigyn, For he may with his right hand assoyl vs of syn; Both Dorem and Carlele Ã¾ai wald neuer blin Ãe wirschip of Ingland with wappen to win; Mekill wirschip Ã¾ai wan and wele haue Ã¾ai waken, For syr Dauid Ã¾e Bruse was in Ã¾at tyme taken. When sir Dauid Ã¾e Bruse satt on his stede, He said of all Ingland haued he no drede; Bot hinde Iohn of Coupland, a wight man in wede, Talked to Dauid and kend him his crede. Ãare was sir Dauid so dughty in his dede, Ãe faire toure of Londen haued he to mede. Sone Ã¾an was sir Dauid broght vnto Ã¾e toure, And William Ã¾e Dowglas with men of honowre; Full swith redy seruis fand Ã¾ai Ã¾are a schowre, For first Ã¾ai drank of Ã¾e swete and seÃ¾in of Ã¾e sowre. Ãan sir Dauid Ã¾e Bruse makes his mone, Ãe faire coroun of Scotland haues he forgone; He luked furth into France, help had he none Of sir Philip Ã¾e Valais ne ?it of sir Iohn. Ãe pride of sir Dauid bigon fast to slaken; For he wakkind Ã¾e were Ã¾at held him self waken; For Philyp Ã¾e Valaise had he his brede baken, And in Ã¾e toure of Londen his ines er taken: To be both in a place Ã¾aire forward Ã¾ai nomen, Bot Philip fayled Ã¾are and Dauid es cumen. Sir Dauid Ã¾e Bruse on Ã¾is manere Said vnto sir Philip al Ã¾ir sawes Ã¾us sere: Philip Ã¾e Valais, Ã¾ou made me be here, Ãis es noght Ã¾e forward we made are to ?ere; ffals es Ã¾i forward and euyll mot Ã¾ou fare, For Ã¾ou and sir Iohn Ã¾i son haues kast me in care. Ãe Scottes, with Ã¾aire falshede, Ã¾us went Ã¾ai obout For to win Ingland whils Edward was out. For Cuthbert of Dorem haued Ã¾ai no dout; Ãarfore at Neuel cros law gan Ã¾ai lout, Ãaire louted Ã¾ai law and leued allane: Ãus was Dauid Ã¾e Bruse into Ã¾e toure tane. X [How King Edward &amp; his men?e] How King Edward &amp; his men?e Met with Ã¾e Spaniardes in Ã¾e see. I wald noght spare for to speke, wist I to spede, Of wight men with wapin and worthly in wede, Ãat now er driuen to dale and ded all Ã¾aire dede, Ãai sail in Ã¾e see-gronde fissches to fede; Fele fissches Ã¾ai fede for all Ã¾aire grete fare, It was in Ã¾e waniand Ã¾at Ã¾ai come Ã¾are. Ãai sailed furth in Ã¾e Swin in a somers tyde, With trompes and taburns and mekill oÃ¾er pride; Ãe word of Ã¾o weremen walked full wide; Ãe gudes Ã¾at Ã¾ai robbed in holl gan Ã¾ai it hide, In holl Ã¾an Ã¾ai hided grete welthes, als I wene, Of gold and of siluer of skarlet and grene. When Ã¾ai sailed westward, Ã¾o wight men in were, Ãaire hurdis, Ã¾aire ankers hanged Ã¾ai on here; Wight men of Ã¾e west neghed Ã¾am nerr. And gert Ã¾am snaper in Ã¾e snare, might Ã¾ai no ferr, ffer might Ã¾ai noght flit bot Ã¾are most Ã¾ai fine, And Ã¾at Ã¾ai bifore reued Ã¾an most Ã¾ai tyne. Boy with Ã¾i blac berd, I rede Ã¾at Ã¾ou blin, And sone set Ã¾e to schriue with sorow of Ã¾i syn; If Ã¾ou were on Ingland noght saltou win, Cum Ã¾ou more on Ã¾at coste Ã¾i bale sall bigin: Ãare kindels Ã¾i care kene men sall Ã¾e kepe, And do Ã¾e dye on a day and domp in Ã¾e depe. ?e broght out of Bretayne ?owre custom with care, ?e met with Ã¾e marchandes and made Ã¾am ful bare; It es gude reson and right Ã¾at ?e euill misfare, When ?e wald in Ingland lere of a new lare, New lare sall ?e lere, sir Edward to lout: For when ?e stode in ?owre strenkith ?e war all to stout. XI [How gentill sir Edward with his grete engines] How gentill sir Edward with his grete engines Wan with his wight men Ã¾e castell of Gynes. War Ã¾is winter oway wele wald I wene Ãat somer suld schew him in schawes ful schene: Both Ã¾e lely and Ã¾e lipard suld geder on a grene.

Inglis men er Ã¾arein Ã¾e kastell to kepe; And Iohn of France es so wroth for wo will he wepe. Gentill Iohn of Doncaster did a ful balde dede, When he come toward Gines to ken Ã¾am Ã¾aire crede; He stirt vnto Ã¾e castell with owten any stede; Of folk Ã¾at he fand Ã¾are haued he no drede, Dred in hert had he none of all he fand Ã¾are: Faine war Ã¾ai to fle for all Ã¾aire grete fare. A letherin ledderr and a lang line, A small bote was Ã¾arby Ã¾at put Ã¾am fro pine; Ãe folk Ã¾at Ã¾ai fand Ã¾are was faine for to fyne; Sone Ã¾aire diner was dight; and Ã¾are wald Ã¾ai dine, Ãare was Ã¾aire purpose to dine and to dwell, For treson of Ã¾e Franche men Ã¾at fals war and fell. Say now, sir Iohn of France how saltou fare? Ãat both Calays and Gynes has kindeld Ã¾i care; If Ã¾ou be man of mekil might lepe up on Ã¾i mare, Take Ã¾i gate vnto Gines and grete Ã¾am wele Ã¾are, Ãare gretes Ã¾i gestes; and wendes with wo. King Edward has wonen Ã¾e kastell Ã¾am fro. ?e men of Saint Omers; trus ?e Ã¾is tide, And puttes out ?owre pauiliownes with ?owre mekill pride; Sendes efter sir Iohn of Fraunce to stand by ?owre syde, A bore es boun ?ow to biker Ã¾at wele dar habyde, Wele dar he habide bataile to bede, And of ?owre sir Iohn of Fraunce haues he no drede. God saue sir Edward his right in euer ilka nede, And he Ã¾at will noght so euil mot he spede; And len oure sir Edward his life wele to lede, Ãat he may at his ending haue heuin till his mede.
