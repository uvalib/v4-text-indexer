      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM Marquesse of Hartford, Lord Governour to the Prince His Highnesse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. I. A ACHELOUS. Who 'gainst the world, and sin, and Satan fights, Had need of Bullocks strength, and Serpents slights. If God pulls off thy horn, knocks down thy pride; Go to repentance river, there abide, Till sin be choak'd in tears, and do not scorn To offer him thy Amalthæan horn To feed the poor; but if thy strength thou spend On drink, and whores, a flood shall be thy end. ACTÆON. Think you on this, who spend your dayes, and strength, And means, on Whores, Dogs, Parasites; at length They'l woorry you: before you feel their wounds, Look to their teeth, shun these Actæons hounds. ADONIS. You that hunt after pleasures, eye that Boare, Who would your health, and wealth, and souls devour. Dote not on beauty; beauty's but a flower, Whose pride and lustre fadeth in an hour. Strive that your names may flourish after death, Let them out-live Adonis flower, &amp; yeeld a fragrant breath. ADMETUS. Let not Man think on Hymen, till he finde What is Apollo's and Alcides minde. And you weak Maids, and Widows too, before You marry, shun the Lyon and the Boare. Think not to carry Hope and Confidence, Till you subdue pride and concupiscence: By Hope lay hold on Christ, he will sustain Your souls in death, and them restore again. ÆACUS. MINOS. RHADAMANTHUS. Consider Judges, though you be but dust, Gods sons you are, yea Gods, if you be just. Let no man sin securely, though alone; For each man hath three Judges in a Throne Within his brest: these Judges will torment thee Here and in Hell, where no man shall lament thee. Now we are men, which heretofore were Ants; Then let us live like men, and not like Wants, Still digging: leave your holes, and fix your eyes Upon your starry-house, the spangled skies, Where Christ your head, and Lord and Judge doth dwell, The onely Judge of Heaven, Earth, and Hell. ÆGÆON. As he who did against great Jove rebell, Was struck with Thunder, and knockt down to Hell: So God will all you Monsters over-turn, Who gainst the King, the Church, the State dare spurn. Your glory shall be shame, black Hell your mansion, Furies your fellows, brimstone and fire your pension: Your motion's like Ægæons; when he turns, Ætna doth shake, and for a while it burns: But when you move, you shake the world asunder, Whose bowels smoke, and burn and roare, till you be struck with Thunder. ÆNÆAS. He that would safely passe black Acheron, And scape the dangers of hot Phlegeton, Must carry with him Wisdoms golden rod, Sybill must guide him; thats advice from God: So shall he not fear dangers, nor miscarry, When Styx he crosseth in old Charons wherry. What strength of Towns, or Castles can withstand Sibyllas head-peece, and a golden hand. But yet, beware of gold, I would advise thee; For gold ill got, will down to Hell intice thee. And if thou wouldst true gold and wisdom finde, Seek after Christ, and on him fix thy minde. Be chaste like Doves, and let Gods Word instruct thee, There are the Doves which will to Christ conduct thee. If Kings will fear great Jove who reigns above, Then Vulcan, Neptune, Mercury, and Love Shall serve them; Juno's spight shall not destroy them, Nor Æolus with all his breath annoy them. ÆOLUS. He's Æolus, a God, and not a man, That anger can Subdue, and keep unruly passions under, He's a wonder. He is a King, and stronger then the winde, That curbs his minde. It's ill, when wealth conspires with violence 'Gainst innocence. That State's a Sea; Ships sink, or drive on shoare, When such storms roare. ÆSCULAPIUS. He that would prove a good Physitian, Must be a Centaur, that's a horse and man: And he that will keep men from Charons boat, Must be a Cock, a Crow, a Snake, a Goat. Let him that's sick, and bruis'd, who cryes and grones, Repair to Christ, he'l heal the broken bones: He can do more then Æsculapius, Who brought from death to life torn Virbius. He first subdu'd death in himself, and then Restor'd us all to life, who were dead men, Dead in our sins, and dead in Gods just ire; But Christ hath kill'd our death, and quencht that fire Which doth torment and burn, but not consume, A fire which gives no light, which yeelds no sume. His death then is our life, our drink his blood; His stripes our physick, and his flesh our food. And when he comes again in Majestie, To plague the workers of iniquity, Sitting upon the clouds, whose voice like Thunder, Shall shake heav'ns Tower, and cleave the earth in sunder: Then will he raise all those that sleep in dust, And crown with immortality the just. ALPHÆUS. As Arethusa running through the main, Yet doth its taste and colour still retain: Salt Doris cannot taint it; let us then Be good still, though we live with wicked men. And as Alphæus runs, and will not stop Untill he rests in Arethusa's lap; So run my soul, untill thou be possess'd Of thy belov'd, and of eternall rest. And who would think, that love could set on fire; Cold waters chuse cold waters to desire: Can Cupid wound a river, can he scorch The fencelesse waters with his flaming Torch? No, no; but thou, O Lord, the God of Love Can wound my heart, and warm it from above. My cold and waterish heart, so now inflame With love of thee, that I my course may frame To thee through all the foes of cares and fears, And through the salt sea also of my tears. I am Alphæus, thou that living Well To which I run, and where I hope to dwell. AMPHION. In this we see the force of Eloquence, By which grea Towns have walls, and stones have sence. This is the onely pleasant melody, Which caus'd rude men imbrace civility. Stones hear not sounds; its not the warbling Lute, Nor solemn Harp, nor Trumpet, nor the Flute, Nor Songs, nor any Organ musicall That could give sence to stones, or build a wall: But Christ our Lord with his cœlestiall layes, Hath from Amphion born away the praise; Whose charming voice no sooner 'gan to sound, But Sions walls were lifted from the ground: He rais'd us senslesse stones out of the dung Of Errour, by the musick of his tongue, That we might, at his voice, and in his name, Make up the walls of new Jerusalem. ANTÆUS. Take heed, all you that would o'rethrow Your greedy mindes, and them subdue, You fling them not in things below, For so their force they'l still renew: But lift them up with all your strength, That they may see the wealth and joy Which is above, and so at length You shall your Avarice destroy. At any time if Satan shall With crosses fling you on the ground, Lose not your vertue with your fall, But let your courage then abound. Take heed he lift you not too high With pride in this your spirituall strife: For then hee'l get the victory, And spoil thee of eternall life. Lord lift my minde out of the dust, And make it mount above the skies; Be thou my treasure where no rust Can come, which Moaths and Theeves defies. And when with crosses I'm cast down, Let not my strength and courage fail; Let constancie Lord be my Crown, Then in my fall I shall prevail. APOLLO. When God out of rude Chaos drew the light, Which chas'd away the long confused night O're all this All, it did display Its golden beams, and made the day. So when mankinde did in the Chaos lye, Of ignorance and grosse idolatry, There did arise a light, a Star Brighter then Sun or Moon by far. Who with his fulgent beams did soon disperse The vapours of this little universe Till then no morning did arise, Nor sparkling Stars to paint the skies. This is that Sun, this is the womans seed, Who with her arrows wounded Pythons head; Its he who kill'd the Gyants all, Which were the causes of our fall. He is that shepherd which in flowry Meads Doth feed his wandring flock, and then he leads Them to the brook that softly glides, And with his shepherds-crook them guides. Its he that did Jerusalem immure, And made it strong, that it might stand secure Against all forrein enemies, Against assaults and batteries. He's Wisdom, he that Prophet which displaid What was before in darknesse bosome laid; Whose Oracles did never fail, Whose Miracles made all men quail. He is the Sun that rides triumphantly On the blew Chariot of the spangled sky, Whose Chariot's drawn with horses four, Justice and Truth, Mercie and Power. He is the God of all sweet harmony, Without whose word there is no melody; He's sweeter to a pensive minde, Then any musick we can finde. He is the God of physick, he can ease The soule of sin, thy body of disease. He only helps the heavie heart, He only cures the inward smart. But sometime he his winged shafts lets fly Amongst his foes, and wounds them mortally. Who can unbend his reaching Bow? Who can avoid his piercing blow? Then seeing Christ is this resplendant Sun, Which Gyant-like about the world doth run; Who shew'd to Jews his rosie face, And to all Gentiles offers grace. Let us at last with reverence admire This great Apollo, heavens greatest fire: Come, let us Palms and Laurels bring, And to him Io Pæans sing. Apollo and a King parallel'd. Like as Apollo's sparkling flame, Doth cherish with his beams the frame Of this round Globe we see: So Kings extend on us the light Of their just Laws, and with their might Keep us from injury. They let their Arrows flye at those Who dares their Rules and Laws oppose. And vex the innocent A King the plaguey Python slayes, And Gyants that will Thunder raise Within his firmament. He is a good Physitian, That bitter Pills and Cordialls can Prescribe when he thinks cause He makes a sweeter harmony, Then Harp, or Lute, or Psaltery, With his well tuned Laws. He holds his bow with his left hand, And at his right the graces stand, As white as driven snow, To let us see that by his raign More good we have, and much more gain Then damage by his bow. The Muses in a grove of Bayes About him dance, and sing sweet layes, Each hath her instrument; To shew, that under such a King All things do flourish, Schollers sing With comfort and content. He hath the Ravens piercing eye, He's a white Swan in purity, And hath the Bullocks strength: He shall out-live the Palm and Bay, His Name and Laws shall not decay, But conquer all at length. His head doth shine with golden locks, He is a shepherd of great flocks, Whom in the fragrant Meads, He feeds and guides them with his crook, And drives them to the silver Brook, And to the shades them leads. He wears a Tripos on his Crown, A Triple Monster trampled down, Before him prostrate lyes. Now if this Sun shines any where, He shines sure in our Northern sphære, And moves in British skies. ARACHNE. Thou that in knowledge dost excell, Must humble be, And think what on Arachne fell, May fall on thee: It was her pride did her undo, And pride may overthrow thee too. Let not the miser spend his strength, And lose his health To catch a silly Fly at length, For such is wealth: The carefull wretch at his last gasp Shall finde that wealth is but a wasp. Take heed thou do not use thy tongue To sting the good; For they that thus good men do wrong, Are Spiders brood: Nay worse; for bad tongues far surpasse That poyson which cracks but a glasse. Judges your Laws you must not make, Like Spiders cords, Which onely Pesants use to take And passe by Lords: This is indeed a powerfull Law, Which keeps both rich and poor in awe. But we must Spiders strive to be In providence, Where dangers are we must foresee, And flye from thence; Sea-men for want of good forecast, Are soon surpris'd with every blast. ARION That arch-Thief Satan, Pyrate of mankinde, Had rob'd us of Gods grace, had spoil'd the minde, And flung us in the sea of misery, In which we must have dyed eternally: Ev'n as those Theeves who had conspir'd to 'ntomb Arion in old Glaucus glassy womb; Who by his Harp from that salt grave was saved, And on the Dolphins scaly back received: On which, as on a horse triumphing rides, And with his musick charms the windes and tides. The sea-Nymphs are amaz'd to hear such noise, And with unusuall dancings shew their joyes. Stern Neptunes Trident doth the waves appease, And Tritons blew horse tramples on the seas; Thetis stands still and hears, the fishes skip To hear this Song, to see this living ship. The Dolphin was the ship, the pilot, and The compasse too, that brought him to the land. If this was true, t'was strange, sure this I know, That Satan out of Paradise did throw Adam unto a briny sea of cares, Which had more dangers then his head had hairs. The breath of Gods just indignation Did raise the billows of this Ocean, Which with a night of clouds obscur'd the sky, And did involve with mists heavens brightest eye. This incontrolled storm did rore and rage, And nothing could the wrath thereof asswage, Untill that storm was heard which calm'd the seas, Unmask'd the Sun, and did the windes appease. The Gentile Princes, who before were wilde, Are by this musick charm'd, &amp; made more milde. Sions new Song hath caus'd great Potentates Submit to Christ their crowns, their wealth, their states. They yeeld their backs to him, him they support In his sea-tossed members to their port. And as Arion did the fish bestride, Which through the main was both his ship and guide: So Christ supports us to our wish'd for shore, He's Winde, and Star, Card, Pilot, Ship, and Oare. Or else the Church the Dolphin is; the Gale Gods Word; the World's the Sea on which we sail: Who through this Sea would passe, and come to land, Must use this Gale, and on this Dolphin stand. ARISTÆUS When Aristæus lost his troops Of honey, people, and their hopes; And when Cyrene he ador'd, He had his swarms again restor'd. Wee are the Bees, and Christ is he Who would himself an off'ring be; He was both Altar, Priest and Hoast, He found us out when we were lost. He got us pleasure by his pain, His death's our life, his losse our gain. In that we do injoy our lives, In that our wexin Kingdom thrives: In that we sit on fragrant flowers, Bedew'd with pearly drops and showers; In that our Cells with Nectar slow, In that our yong ones live and grow: In that we play in open air, In that the Heavens are so fair; In that we have so long a Spring, And with our humming Meads do ring: All this we have, and more then this, By vertue of Christs sacrifice. Its he who with his gentle breath, Tempers the heat of Jova's wrath. Its he that loves us night and day, And yet like fools we run away. He is our husband, not our foe, Then whither will you from him go? You run, but do not see, alas, The Serpent that lurks in the grasse. O Lord, when thou dost call on me, Uncase my eyes, that I may see Thy love, and beauty of thy face; And so support me with thy grace That I may stand; or if I fall, I may not lose my soul withall. ATALANTA. We're all in Atalanta's case, We run apace, Untill our wandring eyes behold The glitt'ring gold: And then we lose in vanity Our race, and our virginity. Gods holy Temple we pollute, And prostitute Our souls to foul Hippomenes, With all boldnesse; So having lost humanity, Fierce Lyons we become to be. And then our heads we must submit, To curb and bit Of mother earth, whose heavie Wain We draw with pain: And yet we cannot cease to draw Earth, till earth hide us in her maw. O that we could our sins deplore, And kill the Boare Of wanton lusts, e're we hence go To shades below: O that our rocky hearts could rend, And from them Chrystall Rivers send. O God, all filthy lusts destroy, Which me annoy, And give my flinty heart a blow, That tears may flow: O let me not thy house profane, Which thou hast purchas'd with thy pain. ATLAS Go too my soul, thy doors unlock, Behold the Son of God doth knock, And offers to come in: O suffer not to go from hence, So great a God, so just a Prince, That were a grievous sin. Refuse not then to intertain So great a guest, who would so fain Come lodge and sup with thee: If thou refuse, he can command The Gorgon which is in his hand Thy soul to terrifie. His word the Gorgon is, which can Turn unto senslesse stones that man Whose gates will not display Themselves to him, who still intreats To come unto our Cabinets; And yet wee'll not give way. O Lord, whose word doth me sustain, And all that's in the earth and main, And in the painted skies: Let me those goodly fruits of gold Which in thy gardens shine, behold With these my feeble eyes. Lord give the King a lasting name, And strength, that he may bear the frame Of this great Monarchy: From whom if Prudence do not part, Nor light of Knowledge from his heart, Wee'll fear no Anarchy. Make thou his golden splendor shine As far as did King Atlas Mine To earths remotest bound, And let his head ascend as high As Atlas did above the sky, With light and glory crown'd. AURORA. As fair Aurora from old Tithons bed, Flyes out with painted wings, and them doth spred Upon the firmament; So from the heavens golden Cabinet, Out flyes a morning all with Roses set Of graces redolent. Whose presence did revive the hearts of those Whom night of sin and errour did inclose Within her darkest Cell; This morning on a purple Chariot rides, Drawn by four milk-white Steeds, the reins he guides In spight of death and hell. Christ is this morning, who triumphantly On the bright Chariot of his Word doth flye; The four white horses are The four Evangelists, whose light doth run As swift as doth Aurora, or the Sun, Or Moon, or any Star. Its he that Eagle-like our youth renews, And in us all infirmities subdues; Its he whose radiant wings Displaid abroad, hath chas'd away the night, And usher'd in the day, which mentall light And true contentment brings. O thou whose face doth guild the Canopy Which doth infold fire, air, and earth, and sea, Extend thy glorious rayes On me, Oh let me see that countenance Which may dispell the night of ignorance, So shall I sing thy praise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. II. B BACCHUS. If you would a Monarch see All array'd in Majesty, Who triumphed first, and wore Such a Crown, as none before Could attain too; Christ is he Who triumphing on a tree, Kill'd the Snake with his two stings, Death and sin, and captiv'd Kings, And the Titans who combine Heaven it self to undermine. This is he whose eloquence Doth surpasse all humane sence: From whose lips, as from a Still, Drops of Nectar down did drill; When our hearts with fear did pine, He found out that pleasant wine Which hath made us laugh and sing Hallelujahs to our King. He flung over-board, and drown'd All the Pyrats that him bound: When they had his body torn With their whips and crown of thorn; When they thought he had been slain, He reviv'd and rose again. Hecate queen of the night Held him not for all her might; But this uncontrolled Prince Burst her gates, and got out thence. O thou onely God of wine, Comfort this poor heart of mine With that Nectar of thy blood, Which runs from thee like a flood. On thy fruitlesse servant pour From thy veins a crimson shower: Let that dew of Rubies which Fell from thee, my soul inrich; Let me taste of that sweet sape Which dropp'd from this squeezed grape: T'was for me this grape was prest, Drink my soul, and take thy rest. BELIDES. Children obey your parents, but if they Bid you do mischief, you must not obey: For sure you must not yield obedience Against Gods Laws, against your conscience, Least with these cruell sisters you partake, Of their vain toiling in the Stygian lake. Let all beware of sin, which men beguils With her inticing looks, and flattering smiles. She hath a virgins face, but traitors fist, Which without grace we hardly can resist. Let no man joyn himself to such a wife, Whose mouth presents a kisse, her hand a knife. BELLEROPHON. Christ is that Potent Conqueror, who hath Subdu'd the great Chimæra in his wrath: Whom malice to æll dangers did expose, Who was accused falsly by his foes. The more he was oppress'd, he grew the more In power and honour, and at last did soare On Fames swift wings, above the high extent Of air, and fire, and starry firmament. His Word's a winged horse, which he bestrides, And over Lyons, Goats, and Dragons rides; O thou who rides now on the arched skie; Who for my sins was once content to dye; Who hath subdu'd all monsters with thy word, And now triumphs with that two-edged sword; Destroy in me these monsters which rebell Against thy Laws, save me from death and hell. Make me to spend my dayes without offence, And let my daily guard be innocence. And Lord, whereas I'm mounted on the wings Of nimble Time, which fly'th with earthly things Swifter away then Pegasus; teach me How I may fight to get the victory: That e're I go from hence, I may subdue Chimæra with Pentheselæa's crue. Whil'st I in holy raptures mount to thee, From swelling pride good Lord deliver me. And whil'st I'm carried on Faith's golden wings, Keep back mine eyes from sublunary things: Least whil'st I gaze on them, I tumble down, And so lose both the victory and crown. BOREAS, BOREADÆ, HARPIÆ. Who think you may with priviledge Rob Churches, and the Priests annoy? Know this, that for your sacriledge The Lord at last will you destroy: You'r like those monsters virgin-fac'd, Whom Calais and Zetis chas'd. Your virgin-looks do shew you'r pure, Your Feathers make you very gay: But by your tallents I am sure You'r nothing else but birds of prey; Which eat our tithes, and them pollute, But what you eat you quickly mute. These Tables shall you not avail, These Morsels shall not make you fat; For still you eat, and still you'r pale, Your craw's ne'r full, your belly's flat: Those blew-hair'd winged sons one day Perhaps shall blow you quite away. And you rich grubs who do abound With wealth, and meat laid up in store, Hark how the Harpies wings resound About your windows and your dore: They wish you dead, that they might share Those goods among them which you spare. And now Lord with thy powerfull breath Drive all these hellish birds away, Which have conspir'd to work my death, And of my Table make a prey; Restore my sight that I may see Their filthinesse and treachery. And whil'st I'm gathering fragrant flowers Of comfort by the Chrystall springs Of thy pure Word, drop down sweet showrs Of grace on me, and give me wings To flye to thee, and make my hair In colour like the Azure sphære. Make (though my feet walk here below) My head may alwayes be above; O let thy cooling spirit blow, And ravish me with thy true love. Let me go with winged paces To injoy thy chaste imbraces. Sweet Boreas come blow on me With thy cold breath, and do not stay; My soul longs much to joyn with thee, O let this be our wedding day, Wherein I (which is still my wish) Thy Myrrhe-distilling lips may kisse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. III. C CADMUS and HARMONIA. Behold that Prince which once with Majestie Invested was, whose throne was far more high Then is the starry Cabinet That over this low Globe is set. Yet was content to leave that state, and throw Himself upon his footstool here below. He stept down from his lofty throne To seek his Sister that was gone. And whilst he sought her, he rear'd up the wall Of that great City which shall never fall, And then the Dragon, he did wound And all his toothbread sonnes confound: He did those glassie springs of life discover Which drill the flowers, and pleasant meads run over, In his pure heart all graces met, And beauty in his face was set. But yet this all-commanding King was deem'd A worm, no man, and as a Snake esteem'd. Men hide their faces from this King, Whose face makes men and Angels sing. Though men despis'd him, yet he was received Into these joys which cannot be conceived; By all the winged companies, Whose dwelling is above the skies. O thou who guides the heavens as with rain, And dwels in light which no man can attain, Vouchsafe to look from those high Towers, On these low Cottages of ours. Seek out my soul which hath forsaken thee To follow after lying vanity, Tread down the Dragon and his brood. For they have still my soul withstood. The Picture of a King. He is of noble pedegree, His wife is called Harmony; The chiefest Gods in their best state, His Nuptials do celebrate. Jove that shakes heaven with his brows Unto the King presents this Spouse; Whose Father is the god of war, Whose Mother is the morning star. Minerva brings her golden chain, And Ceres makes them rich with grain; Joves daughters, with their beardlesse King, From Helicon their musick bring; Each one with flowers and Laurels crown'd, And Arca's harp doth sweetly sound. The gods all in their best array, With dances crown this wedding day. Thus honour, wealth, and pleasure wait, Where such a King doth rule the State; He by Minerva's help can wound The Dragon, and his brood confound: That under him we freely may Drink of that fountain in the way. But yet he hath the Dragons jaws, To tear all those that break his Laws; Thus in his life this King is blest, And in his death in peace shall rest. Now if there be above the ground, A Prince so perfect to be found, He's either in King Arthurs chair, Or else he doth reside no where. CASTOR and POLLUX. If Pollux was so kinde and free, To share his immortality With Castor that was slain; That they might both participate Of life and death by turn, and that They both might grow and wain; How much more gracious was he, Who was a King, and yet would dye For him that was a slave; That he might never dye again, But might be freed from endlesse pain, And from the eating grave. O Lord thou art that King, and I The slave, who for my sins must dye, And to my dust return: O raise me by thy mighty aid In that last day, from deaths black shade, And from my silent Urn. And let me not with Castor trace So often too and from that place Where night and darknesse raign; But joyn me to these winged wights, Which far above heavens twinkling lights With thee in blisse remain. CENTAURI. He that runs in the way of grace, Must carefull be He fall not, lest he lose his race And victory: What folly is't, to play the Saint At first, and in the end to faint. It's not enough to seek and know God whil'st we'r yong, And when age on our heads doth snow, To dote on dung: A good youth who in age doth fail, A mans head hath, but Centaurs tail. So drunkards, when they roare aloud, And fight and swear; They shew that they'r of that same cloud That Centaurs were: He that in drink will fight, and force A woman, is both man and horse. So every sin at first appears With man-like face, But we shall finde within few yeers The horses trace: Sin looks on us with smiling cheeks, But in the end it flings and kicks. And as the Centaurs had swift heels To run away, So hath our time, which runs on wheels, And cannot stay: O that we could consider this, How short a time, how swift it is. O Lord so order thou my time, That all may see My fall's as hot as was my prime, In love to thee; That so of me they may not finde A man before, a horse behinde. CERBERUS. Loe then the hundred-headed dog at last Is bound with Adamantine chains so fast, That though he bark and foame, yet cannot bite, H'hath lost his power, but hath not lost his spite. How much are we beholding to our Lord, Who by his power and all-subduing word, Charms monsters three, black-mouth'd infernall hounds, Death, Hell, and Satan, and their power confounds. When he descended to black Pluto's Tower, Where this three-yawning Mastiff keeps the dore, He caus'd him to disgorge himself of those Which in his bowels he did long inclose. He durst not stare upon these glorious rayes, Which turn the darkest nights to cleerest dayes: But frets and foames; his Snakes, as with a spell, Stood all amaz'd to see such light in Hell. Then let us all with one joynt harmony Chant forth his noble praise, and pierce the sky; That as the winged quirristers still sing Cœlestiall Hallelujahs to this King; So we with them may chant, and Carroll forth With warbling notes his everlasting worth, Who freed us from this prison where we lay, And makes us now injoy a brighter day, Then any that within our Horizon Was ever seen, or in the burning Zone. And you rich hounds who almost split with store, And yet your jaws are yawning still for more, Your ill-got gobbets vomit up in time, Remember you'r but dust, and gold's but slime. Unlock your iron Goals, break up your caves, In which your gold lyes buried as in graves. And let your pale-fac'd money see the Sun, Let free these captives from their dungeon: That they may walk abroad, and let them serve Poor men that are in want, and like to starve. And thou, O Lord, who onely durst encounter, And only couldst, with that three-headed monster; And who hath pull'd the prey out of his jaws, And broke his teeth, &amp; par'd his scratching claws; So satisfie my craving appetite, That it in thee alone may take delight; For neither honours (Lord) nor wealth I see, This gaping heart of mine can satisfie: For what are these but transitory toyes, Compar'd with thee, compar'd with inward joyes, The more my soul feeds on these aiery dishes, The more she hungers, and the more she wishes. Hydropick men, still drink, and still are dry, The horse-leach cryes, Give, give, and so do I: Then seeing there's no end of my desire, But wealth, like oil, doth still increase this fire; Give not too much, but what's sufficient, And having thee, with thee I'le be content. CERES. You that walk among sweat flowers, Dasht with drops of twi-light showers, Which with smels refresh the sence; Look about and carefull be, Of the plots and pollicie Of that black infernall Prince. Who's still ready to incroach On your souls, and in his Coach, To hurl you from hence away To that dark and dismall place, Where you cannot see the face Of Apollo and the day. And let us take heed that we Taste not that Pomegranat tree, Which in his sad Orchard stands; If we do, we shall remain Captives still, and ne're again Shall escape out of his hands. Juno then cannot help us With her wealth, nor fair Venus With her sea-froth countenance; Neither yet that blew-ey'd maid, Which out of Joves head was said To proceed, can help us thence. Onely Christ did undertake, When he pass'd the joylesse Lake To release our souls again; When we were in Pluto's power, All inthrall'd within his Tower, Where we should have ever lain. But he broke the gates of brasse, And made way for us to passe, Though we tasted of that tree Which bereav'd us of Gods grace, And inclos'd us in that place Where dwels endlesse misery. He dispersed hath that seed Of his Word, which doth us feed; Dragons now his chariots draw, Who before were Gentile Kings, Fierce as Dragons, swift with wings, Are now subject to his Law. He holds out his burning Lamps, Which expell unwholsome damps From us that in darknesse lye: He doth raise us from below, Not for half a yeer or so, But for all eternity. O my God, amongst May flowers, When I spend some idle hours, When my joyes do most abound, I will think on Deaths black Coach; That if then it should approach, I may be then ready found. Thou do'st feed me daily, Lord, With sincere milk of thy Word; O then give me constancie, That I may by night indure Thy hot furnace, for I'm sure Thou know'st what is best for me. CHARON. Remember this, all you that spend Your life on drink, and mark your end: As oft as cups and pots you tosse, So oft the river Styx you crosse. You'r Owls, you do not love the light, You are the sons of Hell and night: Black Erybus begot you then, You'r Monsters sure, you are not men. You are afraid, that if you dye, Your bodies should unburied lye; And so your souls be forc'd to trade A hundreth yeers in death's black shade, Before you can admitted be In Charons boat; this you foresee: And wisely to prevent this soare, You'l be intomb'd in drink before. And thus you make your Funerall Your selves by times in wine and oil. You have an old and leaking throat, Still sucking in like Charons boat; No company you will admit, But who are buried in the pit Of wine, whose mouths must fraughted be With coin, such are your company. O Lord, before I go from hence, Give me a joyfull conscience, That I may joyfully ride on The billows of affliction. Save me, O God, from this foul vice Of drunkennesse, and from avarice: When Death's wherry shall receive me, Let not then thy comfort leave me; So shall I not fear Charons looks, Nor be dismaid to crosse these brooks, Of Styx, Cocytus, Acharon, Nor waves of scalding Phlegeton. CHIMÆRA. Then let us all take heed of wine and whores, If we will save these wretched souls of ours: Or if we would preserve our lands and monies From these devourers of mens patrimonies, Against these monsters rather fight then flye, I'le rather kill them then they shall kill me; The Lyons fury's kill'd with patience, The goarish wantonnesse with abstinence, Against the Dragons sting use Antidotes, Resist his cunning plots with counterplots. Fear not, our life's a warfare; either we Must fight, or else where is our victory? Without which, there's no triumph, no renown, And where there is no conquest, there's no crown. O Lord, in this great combate strengthen me, That through thy power I may victorious be; And let thy presence cheer my heart, refresh My fainting spirits, and my trembling flesh; Thou art the Lord of hoasts, O let thy word Be unto me a Buckler, Helmet, Sword: What can Chimæra do, if thou assist me? Be thou my God, and then who dare resist me. CHIRON To gaze upon nights sparkling eyes, Which still are rolling in the skies, Is Chirons head; but we Must have his curing hands also, And's feet, which may indure Gods blow, And's voice of melody. Our hands must work salvation, Our heads must meditate upon Heavens shining Canopy: Our tongues must praise Gods actions, The feet of our affections For sin must wounded be. I will before my Altar stand, With sacrifices in my hand, And thus to God will pray: Lord heal these wounded feet of mine, Then make me as a Star to shine, Or as the brightest day. Give me the head of knowledge, and A well-tun'd tongue, a working hand, And feet which may thy blow Indure; O wound me, so that I By wounds may be prepar'd to dye, And wean'd from things below. CIRCE. All you that love your souls, Beware of Circes bowls; And go not to her feasts, Where men are turn'd to beasts. Remember whil'st you'r drinking wine, How Circe turned men to swine. The whore with painted smiles The wanton youth beguiles, She hath a pleasant cup, Which silly fools drink up: But whil'st you'r drinking, eye the wand Which Circe beareth in her hand. At first sin seems to be A pleasing thing to thee, And fools with vain delights Do cloy their appetites; But every pleasure hath its pain, In sweetest honey there is bane. If men of meaner sort Make drunkennesse but a sport, Yet let not men of place Their state so much disgrace: Ulisses must have temperance, Although his servants lose their sence? Lord arm me with thy Word, Which like Ulisses sword, From Circe may defend me, And then herb Moly send me: Having this sword and herb, O God, I'le shun the cup, I'le scape the rod. CÆLUS. You sons of heaven, and of the day, Stoop not so low, As to betroth your souls to clay; For then I know That of this match will come no good, But rather a pernicious brood. A race of Monsters shall proceed Out of thy loins, If thou in time tak'st not good heed To whom thou joyn'st Thy soul in wedlock, earth's not fit For thee to fix thy heart on it. For she will bring thee such a brood That shall resist thee, And when thy soul they have withstood, They will devest thee Both of thy Kingdom and thy strength, And bring thee under them at length. And if earths Adamantine knife Emasculate Thy soul, then shall thy barren life And gelded state Ingender in thee endlesse cares, And Furies with their snaky hairs. Lord joyn my heart so close to thee With fervent love, That I may covet constantly The things above, Where glory crowns that princely brow To which both men and Angels bow. Lord let not earth effeminate My heart with toyes, But let my soul participate Thy heavenly joyes, Where Angels spend their endlesse dayes In singing of Elysian layes. And if my mother be the light, And heaven my fire, Then let my soul dwell in that bright Ætheriall fire, Where Gyants, Furies, and the race Of Titans dare not shew their face. CUPIDO. Alas my soul, how men are vext That fix their love on gilded dung, Which when they want they are perplext, And when they have it they are stung. Great riches wounds With cares mans heart; As wealth abounds, So doth their smart. Doth not the love of earthly things, Devest men of their richest robe, And then they fly away with wings, And leaves them naked on this Globe: Besides all that, They blinde men eyes, That they cannot Behold the skies. And doth not earthly things besides, With burning torches men torment; And with sharp arrows wound their sides, So that our dayes in pain are spent: Then why should I Affect these things, Which misery And sorrow brings. This love makes men like foolish boyes, Who place their chief felicity In bits of glasses, shels, and toyes, Or in a painted Butter-flye: So riches are (Which we, alas, Scrape with such care) But bits of glasse. Lord let me see thy beauty, which Doth onely true contentment bring; And so in thee I shall be rich: Oh if I had swift Cupids wing, Then would I flee By faith above, And fix on thee My heart and love. That Christ is the true God of Love. Christ is the onely God of Loves, Who did his secrets all disclose; Whose wings are swifter then the Doves, Who onely hath deserv'd the Rose: Thou onely art That potent King, Both of my heart And every thing. Both Principalities and Powers, And all that's in the sea and land, Men, Lyons, Dolphins, Birds and Flowers, Are all now under thy command: Thy Word's the torch Thy Word's the dart Which both doth scorch And wound my heart. It was not Cupid (sure) that spoil'd The gods of all their vestiments; But thou art he that has them foil'd, And stript them of their ornaments: Then thou alone Deserves to be Set in the Throne Of Majesty. Sometime a Crown of Thorns did sit Upon that sacred head of thine; But sure a Rose-crown was more fit For thee, and Thorns for this of mine: O God, what love Was this in thee, That should thee move To dye for me! Thy youth is alwayes green and fresh, Thy lasting yeers, Lord, cannot fail; O look not on my sinfull flesh, But mask thy eyes with mercy's vail. O Lord renew In me thy love, And from thy view My sins remove. CYCLOPES. When that one-ey'd Cyclopean race, Which in earths burning entralls dwell, Had pull'd us down as low as hell, Where we should ne're have seen the face Of that bright Coachman of the day, Whose horses drive all clouds away. We had been all for ever lost, For Polyphemus in his den Was feeding on the souls of men, When Christ sent by the holy Ghost, Entred into that horrid cave Which should have been our endlesse grave. The deadly wine he made him drink Of his just indignation, And bound him in his dungeon So fast, that now he cannot shrink, And with his word he hath made blinde That eye which fascinates mankinde. If sometimes this Ætnæan brood Are heard to thunder in the air, And if with lightnings they do tear The mountains that have so long stood: It is because our sins do reign, That he will not their power restrain. And when we see the earth is stained With blood-shed in our cruell wars, We may be sure they break their bars, And that their power is not restrained; It's for our sins God suffers them To reign thus to our losse and shame. O Lord of hostes, with mercy's eye Look on this torn estate of ours, And now at last dissolve the powers Of that Ætnæan company Whose bellows coals of envie blow, Who still amongst us discord sow. Whose hammers on their anvils sound Continually, who chariots make For Mars, and so our peace they break; But thou, O Lord, their work confound, Let fire their chariots all consume, And turn their armour all to fume. And as thou with thy mighty word Didst thrust out Polyphemus eye, So save me from this tyrannie; And let thy wisdom guide me Lord, In that last day out of the grave, Which is his flesh-consuming cave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. IV. D DÆDALUS. He who hath Faith's swift wings to flye Out of the labyrinth of sin, In pride will neither soare too high, Nor flye too low, lest he fall in The sea of desperation; He knows the golden mean is best. Or if he with the pinion Of honour flyes; or if he's blest With Fortunes wing, hee'l alwayes hold The middle way; and when he flyes With mounting thoughts, he'l not be bold In needlesse curiosities. On that bright lamp he will not stare, Nor draw too nigh with waxen wings Of humane reason, but forbear To pry into transcendent things. What mortall blear-eye can abide The splendour of those flaming rayes, From which the purest Angels hide Their faces; O who knows his wayes, Whose light is inaccessible; Whose paths in the deep waters lye, Whose wayes are all unsearchable, Whose judgements no man can discry. O that I had Faiths nimble wing, To cut this airy region, Away how quickly would I spring Out of this sinfull dungeon; Where Satan that great Minotaure Lyes feeding on the souls of men; Lord let him not my soul devoure, But raise me out of his black den: For none can furnish me with wings, But thou alone, whose mighty pow'r Exceedeth all created things. And thou can'st kill the Minotaure. Lord guide me in my flight, lest I Should flye too low in vain desire Of earthly things, or least too high In proud conceits my heart aspire. I crave not honours airy wing, For golden Feathers I'le not call: And if I flye not with a King, Then with a King I shall not fall: High hils, tall trees, and lofty towers, To storms and windes are subject more Then vallies, shrubs, and poor mens bowers; The mean estate give me therefore. Each fall doth answer his ascent; The highest elevations Of Planets in the firmament, Have lowest declinations. DEUCALION. The happinesse of Britain. Clap hands, O happy British clime, Thrice happy, if thou knew the time Of this thy happinesse: Wherein thou dost injoy sweet peace, With health, and freedom, and increase Of wealth and godlinesse. Thy roses and thy thistles blow, Thy fields with milk and honey flow, Thy ships like mountains trace In Neptunes watry Kingdom; and With traffick they inrich thy land And goods from every place: From where the morning wings are spread, From where the evenings face looks red, And from the torrid Zone: And from the pole and freezing Bares, Thou furnishest thy self with wares, And with provision. Thou hast no foe to crosse thy gain, Thy Altars are not made profane With vain Idolatry: Thy Priests are cloath'd with holinesse, Thy Saints sing all with joyfulnesse, And calm security. Here each man may at leasure dine Under the shadow of his vine; Thou hear'st no Canons rore: Thou hear'st not Drums and Trumpets sound, Dead carkasses spread not thy ground; Thy land's not red with goare: Thy Temples Hymns and Anthemns ring, And Panegyricks to the King Of this great Universe; Down from thy sounding Pulpits fall Gods Word like Nectar, who can all Thy happinesse rehearse? Sure thou art that Pernassus hill, On which Deucalion did dwell When all the earth was drown'd: So whil'st the earth now swims in blood, And men walk through in a Crimson flood, Thy head with peace is crown'd. Here all the Muses with their King, Bay-brow'd Apollo sit and sing Their envied quietnesse: So nothing's wanting as we see, To make thee blest, except it be Submissive thankfulnesse. Here we have just Deucalions Who make wise men of stupid stones, And who behinde them cast The love of earth; whose innocence Keeps off the flood of wars from hence, So that our hill stands fast. Much of this happinesse we gain By him, whose sacred brows sustain The three-fold Diadem Of these Sea-grasping Isles, whose ground Joves brother doth not onely round, But as his own doth claim. Great God, prime author of our peace, Let not this happinesse decrease, But let it flourish still: Take not thy mercie from this land, Nor from the man of thy right hand, So shall we fear no ill. DIANA. Who would a chaste and constant virgin be, Must shun the worlds impure society; And idlenesse, for want of exercise, Corrupts our limbs, and kills our souls with vice. On cloud-transcending meditations We must have still our conversations; In Cities, chaste Diana never dwels, But in green woods, and on the airy hils: In woods she hunts wilde beasts, on hils she dances, And on her shoulder blades her bow advances: Oreades about her in a ring In measures trace the ground, and sweetly sing. Oh that I had Diana's wings, that I From tumults to these calm retreats might flye, Where she amongst her Nymphs doth reign as queen, Where Flora keeps her fragrant Magazin; Where wood-Musitians with their warbling throats Chant forth untaught, but yet melodious notes Neer Chrystall-brested rivers; O that I Could still enjoy this harmlesse companie, Which know-not pride, nor malice, nor deceits, Nor flattery, the moth and bane of states. O that I had Diana's silver bow, To kill my beastly sins, before they grow Too savage; if I had the nimble feet Of her two Stags, then would I be as fleet As they, to run the way of Gods commands, Then would I hold the Lyon in my hands, And Leopard; O if I could subdue My wilde unruly sins, a savage crew. O let my weary soul be carried, Lord, In that bright silver chariot of thy Word; And let thy fear, and milk-white innocence, Be these two Stags to draw my soul from hence. And whil'st my glasse runs in obscurity, Let me not lose my virgin purity; And let not fair Diana, thy chaste love, Thy spotlesse Church, thy silver feather'd Dove Abuse her self with grosse idolatry, And lose the honour of virginity. Let that Ephesian perish with disgrace, Who would her Temple and her state deface: Let no Records eternize that foul name, And let it not be mention'd but with shame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. V. E ELYSIUM. You that delight in painted meads, In silver brooks, in cooling shades, In dancing, feasts, harmonious layes, In Chrystall springs, and groves of bayes: Draw neer, and I will let you see A Tempe full of majesty, Where neither white-hair'd Boreas snows, Nor black-wing'd Auster ever blows; But sweet-breath'd Zephyr still doth curl The meads, and purest streams here purl From silver springs which glide upon Rich Pearl, and Orientall stone: Here on the banks of Rivers grows Each fruitfull tree, here Laurell groves Ne're fade; here's a perpetuall spring, With Nightingales the woods still ring: Meads flourish here continually In their sweet smelling Tapestry; The Pink, the gilded Daffadilly, The shame-fac'd Rose, the white cheek'd Lilly; The Violet, the Columbine, The Marigold, the Eglantine, Rosemary, Time, and Gilli-flowers, Grow without help of Sun or showers. Vines still bear purple clusters here, New wine aboundeth all the yeer. The ground exhales that pleasant smell Which doth all earthly sents excell, And this place of it's own accord Doth all these benefits afford: There needs no husbandmen to toil, And labour in this happy soil; Rage, tyranny, oppression, Fraud, malice, and ambition, And avarice here are not known, And coals of discord are not blown, But in this blessed mansion Dwels perfect love and union. Here are no cares, nor fears, nor death, Nor any pestilentiall breath Which may infect that wholsom air, But here's continuall dainty fare; Ambrosia here on trees doth grow, And cups with Nectar overflow; Tables with flowry carpets spread, Are still most richly furnished; Drums, Trumpets, Canons roaring sounds Are never heard within these bounds; But sacred Songs, and Jubilees, Timbrels, Organs, and Psalteries, Sackbuts, Violins, and Flutes, Harps, silver Symbals, solemn Lutes; All these in one joyn'd harmony, With Hallelujah's pierce the sky. Here's neither night nor gloomy cloud Which can that world in darknesse shroud; But there's an everlasting day Which knows no evening, or decay: There shines a Sun, whose glorious fire Shall not with length of time expire; And who shall never set or fall In Neptunes azure glassie hall. Here are no birds or beasts of prey, Here is no sicknesse nor decay, Nor sorrow, hunger, infamy, Nor want, nor any misery; Nor silver-headed age, which bows The back, and furrows up the brows: But here's the ever-smiling prime, Of youth, which shall not fade with time. Mirth, plenty, glory, beauty, grace And holinesse dwell in this place. Such joys as yet hath never been By mortals either heard or seen. What tongue is able to rehearse, What Muse can sing, or paint in verse This place, to which all earthly joys Compared, are but fading toys. Sure, if I had a voice as shrill As thunder, or had I a quill Pluck't from an Angels pinion; And if all tongues were joyn'd in one; Yet could they not sufficiently Expresse this places dignity: Which golden feather'd Cherubims, And fire-dispersing Seraphims Have circled with their radiant wings, To keep away all hurtfull things. O thou whose glory ne'r decayes, When these my short and evil dayes Are vanish'd like a dream or shade, Or like the grasse, and flowers that fade; Lord let my soul have then accesse Unto that endlesse happinesse, Where thy blest saints with warbling tongues Are chanting still celestiall songs; Where winged quiresters thy praise Still Caroll forth with heavenly layes: When shall my bondage Lord expire, That I may to that place retire? When shall I end this pilgrimage? When wilt thou ope this fleshly cage, This prison, and this house of clay, That hence my soul may fly away? Untye the chains, with which so fast I'm bound, and make me free at last; And draw aside this Canopie Which keeps me from the sight of thee; Lord let me first see thee by grace Here; then, hereafter face to face. ENDYMEON. What means the Moon, to dote so much upon The fair Endymeon? Or why should man forsake his Soveraign good, To catch an empty cloud? From heaven shall any man for riches fall, And lose his soul and all? How can we sleep in such security, As that we cannot see Our dangers, nor that lamp, whose silver ray Drives black-fac'd night away? What madnesse is't for thee to lose thy share Of heaven, for bubling air Of honour, or of popular applause, Which doth but envie cause, And which is nothing but an empty winde, That cannot fill the minde; How changable is man in all his wayes, Now grows, anon decayes; Now cleere, then dark, now hates, anon affects, Still changing his aspects. Much like the Moon, who runs a wandring race, And still doth change her face. But Lord give me strait paths, and grant to me The gift of constancie: And quench in me, I pray, the sinfull fire Of lust, and vain desire. Be thou the onely object of my soul, And free me from the hole Of ignorance and dead security; O when shall I once see The never fading lustre of thy light, To chace away my night; The golden beauty of thy countenance To clear my conscience. O Lord, thou cam'st to rouze Endymeon Out of his dungeon, Wrapp'd in the black vail of Chimerian night, Who could not see the light Of Moon or Star, untill thou didst display Thy all-victorious ray; Brighter then is fair Phœbe's glitt'ring face, Which is the nights chief grace, Whose silver light, as sometimes it does wain, And then it primes again: So was thy flesh eclipsed from it's light By Pluto's horrid night, And muffled for a while from that bright eye Of thy Divinity. But when black deaths interposition Was overcome and gone, The silver orb of thy humanity Did shine more gloriously, Then when the white-fac'd empresse of the night Shines by her brothers light. O rouze me from my drousinesse, that I May see thy radient eye Which pierceth all hearts with its golden beams, From which such glory streams That all the winged Legions admire; Lord warm me with thy fire, And stamp the favour of thy lips on mine, Whose love exceeds new wine; Then will I sing uncessantly thy praise, And to thy honour will due Trophees raise. ERYCHTHONIUS. 1 Why Vulcans fire With Vesta did conspire, To make the monster Erychthonius: It was because Man would not keep Gods Laws, But run the course that was erroneous. 2 There was no hell, Nor death till Adam fell, Nor monster, or deformed Progeny: Minerva's thigh, Nor Sols resplendant eye Did neither cherish, nor such monsters see. 3 Now Vulcan sues Minerva to abuse, And to pollute her pure virginity: So doth the coal Of lust inflame my soul; The flesh against the spirit strives in me. 4 O if my minde. Could peace and freedom finde From inward broils, and Vulcans wanton eye! O if the fire Of lust, and all desire Of earthly things in me would fade and dye! 5 My soul is vext, And too too much perplext With angers, fear, and fiery violence; Which breeds in me Much strife continually That darkneth both my judgement and my sence. 6 And how shall I Resist the tyrannie Of Vulcan, if I have not arms of strength? Therefore, O Lord, Lend me thy conquering sword, That I may be victorious at length. EUMENIDES. See how the grim-fac'd hags from Hells black lake Ascend, and all their hissing tresses shake: They look as fearfull as their mother night, Their black flam'd torches yeeld a dismall light: Who rais'd these monsters from hot Phlegeton, These ghastly daughters of sad Acharon To torture men; hark how their lashes sound, See how they poyson men, and burn and wound. Alas, we can accuse none but our selves, We are the raisers of these dreadfull elves, And we'r the cause of all the misery That fals on us and our posterity. Our sin, alas, procures us all our woe, Sin makes our dearest friend our greatest foe: Almighty God, whose high-born progeny We are, is now become our enemy, And he gives way to these infernall hounds To roame abroad, and rage beyond their bounds. Gold-fingred avarice, with yawning jaws, And piercing eyes, and ever-scraping claws: Whose heart like bird-lime clings to every thing It sees, and still is poor in coveting: Flyes over all, and which (the more's the pitie) Hath poyson'd both the Country and the City; A greedy dog, that's never fill'd with store, But eating still, and barking still for more. The cryes and grones of poor men wrong'd, can tell That this devouring fury came from hell. Then pale-fac'd, squint-ey'd, black-mouth'd envie flyes, And with her sable wings beats out mens eyes, That they cannot on vertues glitt'ring gold Look cheerfully, nor good mens works behold. Like Owls they see by night, black spots they spy, Then run their tongues on wheels of obloquy, But have not eyes to see the shining day Of goodnesse; nor good words have they to say. This fury is the bane of each good action, And is the spightfull mother of detraction: She blasts the buds and blossomes of true worth, And chokes all brave atchievements in their birth. Her pestilentiall breath, her murth'ring eye, Her slandring tongue which goodnesse doth belye; Her whip, and torch, and crawling looks can tell, That she's one of those hags that came from hell. Then raging anger with a scarlet face, And flaming eyes, and feet that run apace To shed mans blood, who for a harmlesse word Will make thy heart a scabberd for her sword; Whose heart is alwayes boyling in her brest, And whose revengefull thoughts are ne're at rest. The panting breath, the trembling lip, the eyes Sparkling with fire, the grones and hideous cryes: The stammering tongue, the stamping foot of those That are possess'd with these infernall foes, May let us see, that when there's so much ire Without, the heart within is set on fire. By that sulphurious torch of Tisiphon, Kindled with flames of fiery Phlegeton; The cry of so much blood shed in this age, Doth shew how much these hellish monsters rage. These are the hellish furies, but from them Swarm multitudes, which now I cannot name; As pride, theft, lust, bribes, rapes, ambition, And sacriledge, drunkennesse, oppression: And thousands more which I cannot rehearse, And, if I could, I would not put in verse This damned crue; these furies causes are That we are scourg'd, with famine, plague, and war: Famine with meagre cheeks, and hollow eyes, Lank belly, feeble knees, and withred thighs, Doth often by th'Almighties just command, Rage, roare, and domineer within our land. The wasting plague with sudden unseen darts Invades the stourest, and assaults their hearts; And with a secret fire dryes up the bloud, And carries all before her like a flood. How often doth this spotted fury rage, With pale-fac'd horrour on this mortall stage, And makes our Towns and Cities desolate, And doth whole countries too depopulate: But War the barbarous mistresse of disorders, How doth she rage within our Christian borders? Good God, who can without a briny flood Of tears, behold the losse of so much bloud? Who can, but such whose hearts are made of stones, Hear (with dry eyes) the mournfull sighs and grones, The screechings, yellings, roarings of all ages, Weltring in blood, where this grim monster rages: Temples profan'd, maids ravish'd, Cities raz'd, And glory of Christs kingdom thus defac'd; Where ought to raign peace and tranquillity, With love, and goodnesse, truth, and civility. And then to see the Turk that barbarous Lord, Inlarge his horned Moon by our discord, And daily to insult on Christs poor sheep, These things would make a Niobe to weep. O turn for shame your fratricidall swords Into the sides of those proud Scythian Lords, Who rais'd themselves by our unhappy fall, And now aim at the ruine of us all. Recover once again your ancient glories, And make your valour Themes of future stories. Alas, I may with tears expresse my grief, Which hath a tongue to speak, but no relief: Except, O thou that art the God of wars, Compose in time our too too civill jars. We grant, O Lord, thy plagues we have deserved, Who have so often from thy precepts swerved; And that of thee we should be quite forlorn, And be the objects of contempt and scorn: But Lord, let not thy wrath for ever burn, Remember those that now in Sion mourn: And save us though we have deserv'd thy stroke, And keep us from the proud imperious yoke Of Ottomans, who like dogs lap our blood, And take our flesh like Canibals for food. And Lord preserve in constant union The little world of this our Albion; Inlarge his life, who doth inlarge our peace, And make his glory with his life increase: That being mounted on the wings of fame, This age may see his worth, the next admire his name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. VI. F FORTUNA. Though fools in their grosse ignorance Stile providence A cruell stepdame, wavering, blinde, Light as the winde, Which kicks off Princes sacred Crowns, And makes them objects of her frowns. And from the dunghill raiseth drones, To sit on thrones; And flings man like a Tennis-ball, From wall to wall: And makes a sport, to raise a Clown To honour, then to kick him down. Yet we know Providence to be That piercing eye Which sees and orders every thing That hath being; Directing them unto that end Which God Almighty did intend. Who blesseth wicked men with wealth, And ease and health, And lets them swim in wine and oil, And know no toil; And sets them on the pinacle Of honour, as a spectacle. What cuts with wing the liquid air, Is for the fare: What silver brooks and lakes contain, Or glassie main: What hills, and dales, and woods afford, Meet altogether on their board. Whereas the just and innocent Are pinch'd with want; With banishment, and have no place To hide their face; The Fox hath holes, the Bird a nest, But good men know not where to rest. Much hunted like the Pelican By wicked men, And like the Turtle sit alone, And make their mone; And like the Owl with groning strain, To God of all their wrongs complain. But though the good mans portion here, Be whipping cheer; Though bad men surfeit with excesse, And all possesse Their hearts can wish; yet we from hence Must not deny Gods Providence. For he hath plac'd these men upon. A slipp'ry stone, Where they shall quickly slide and fall, And perish all; There life shall vanish like a dream, There glory shall conclude in shame. There vain imaginary joyes, And fruitlesse toyes, Like clouds and smoke shall flye away, And so their day Shall end in darknesse; none shall know The place where these green bayes did grow. Then why should we our selves displease, To look on these, And t'envie such prosperity Which soon shall dye, And end in woe, and so be seen No more then if it had not been. Then wealth we see, and worldly state Is but a bait; The bad mans Table's but a snare, And all his share Of earth is but a heap of sand, On which his building cannot stand. But as the fire refines the gold, And as the cold Revives the fire; and as in frost The stars shine most: And as the palm lifts up his crest The higher that it is opprest: So crosses and affliction Which fall upon The just, makes not their faith to fail, Nor courage quail; Who shine, burn, sparkle, fructifie As gold, fire, stars, and the palm tree. I'le rather have a blustring gale, And swelling sail, Then lye becalmed in the main, And ne're attain My wished port; O let the blast Of troubles drive me home at last. That tree is strong and firmly fixt, Which is perplext With frequent storms, which when they blow, The roots below Take deeper hold; O if I were Strong as this tree my storms to bear. The idle sword breeds rust, the cloth Begets the moth, Not worm; the standing water dyes, And putrifies: We first must tread the Camomell, Or else it will afford no smell. The Pilots skill how can we know, Till Tempests blow? How is that Souldiers valour seen, Which ne're had been In fight; they scarse stout Souldiers are, That have no wound to shew, nor scar. Those Souldiers which the Generall Culls out of all His army, to attempt some great And brave exploit, Are those sure whom he means to grace With honour, and some higher place. Except we fight, there is no crown, And no renown; Unlesse we sweat in the vineyard, There's no reward: Unlesse we climb Mount Calvary, Mount Olivet we shall not see. God loves his sons, and them corrects Whom he respects, And whips them when they gad and roame, And brings them home, And fits them, that he may advance Them to their due inheritance . Sick men, although against their wills, Take bitter pills, And in their Feaver, think it good To part with blood; The fire and lance they can indure, And all for an uncertain cure. All whom God means shall bear his blows, He hardneth those; He wrestleth with these sons of his, Whom he will blesse: With Jacob if he make thee lame, He'l blesse thee, and inlarge thy name. If in the Sea God makes our way, We must obey, And follow Moses leading wand To Jacobs land; Through seas of blood we must all passe Unto the land of happinesse. We must drink vineger and gall, And tears withall; With whips, nails, spears we must be torn, And Crowns of thorn: All this with Christ we must sustain, Before that we with Christ can raign. Lord, if this be thy Providence, Teach me from hence, How I may patiently drink up That deadly cup Which thy Son drank; help me to bear His crosse, that I his Crown may weare. When thou correct'st me, quench the fire Of thy just ire, With mercies water in thy hand; And with thy wand Divide the Sea, that I may go Where milk and honey still doth flow. If in a flaming chariot I To heaven must hye; Lord let that flame refine me, but Consume me not: Guide thou the coach through all the nine, Still rowling arches chrystalline.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. VII. G GANIMEDES. God is a substance immateriall, Whose love is not like ours; we dote upon The peeling, shell, and outward fashion Of things, but Gods love is spirituall: The inward beauty he affects, And outward vanity rejects; A pleasing look, a velvet skin, Are toyes he takes no pleasure in. Did Roses in our cheeks, and Lillies dwell, And were our dangling tresses gold, our eyes Like twinkling Tapers in the rowling skies, And did our breath like fragrant gardens smell; Yet if we be not fair within, But if our souls be stain'd with sin; For all our outward form, we are But like the painted Sepulchre. Although our lips were like a Chrystall spring, From which flow streams of sweetest Eloquence, Which ravisheth the heart, and charms the sence; And though our tongues could like a Cymball ring: Yea, though the richest Magazine Of graces could in us be seen; Yet if within we be but fair, God will not for our outside care. He is the fairest Ganymede, whose minde Is pure and fair, whose heart is white as snow, Whose thoughts in whitenesse doth the Swans out-go, Whose life is bright as gold that is refin'd: He who hath these perfections, Shall flye on Eagles pinions, And shall be mounted far above All earthly things to serve great Jove. But Christ is he whose beauty far excells The fading beauty of our humane race, And from whose lips flow silver streams of grace, In whom all goodnesse and perfection dwels; He was a harmlesse spotlesse Dove, The Center of his Fathers love; The object of my chief desires, And he in whom my soul respires. Who on the wing of his Divinity Was elevated far above our sight, And now inhabits that eternall light Which with our mortall eyes we cannot see; He Nectar of his merit pow'rs Before his Father, and down show'rs On us his graces from above, Out of the bottles of his love. O if some cloud-dividing Eagle would Under my feet spread forth his airy wings; And lift my minde from these inferiour things, That I my God in glory might behold: Lord let my prayer pierce the skies, And from the bottles of mine eyes Receive the Nectar of my tears, And drink them with thy gracious ears. O if I could with Eagles pinions cleave The highest clouds, and with their piercing eye Could my Redeemer in his glory see, Triumphing over death, and o're the grave: And as the Eagles do repair To places where dead bodies are; So where thy flesh is, Lord let me Resort, that I may feed on thee. And when my soul shall leave this house of clay, Command thy winged Messengers (who still Are ready to obey thy blessed will) To be my soul-supporters in that day: And in the Resurrection, When soul and body meets in one, Let them uphold me then and there, Where I shall meet thee in the air. GENII. To what high dignity and place Hath God advanc'd our humane race, To whose beak and command He did subdue all things that creep, And flye within the air and deep, And move upon dry land. Besides, heavens blessed Harbingers, Gods nimble-winged Messengers, Are with a watchfull eye By his appointment to defend Us from all hurt, and to attend On us continually. Lord send to me these winged Posts, And guard me with these heavenly hoasts From Satans pollicies: And let them with their shady wings Protect me from all hurtfull things, And from mine enemies. And let this hoste in squadrons flye Before me; Lord unclose mine eye, That I may see my guard: How with their Tents they me inclose, And how they fight against my foes, And keep their watch and ward. And let these be my Tutors to Instruct my minde, what it must do, And how it must obey: O by these sacred Pursuvants Shew me thy just commandements, And guide me in my way. And let these comforters asswage The pains of this my pilgrimage In my last agony; Let these swift-winged Legions, Through all the starry regions My soul accompany. And when the trump Angelicall Shall sound, which must awake us all, And raise us from our dust; Let these intelligences bring Me to the presence of my King, And place me with the just. O thou great Angel, who hath still Been my protector from all ill, Even from mine infancie: Whom winged Heralds all adore With covered face, be evermore A God and guide to me. Thy help I did depend upon When I was but an Embryon, Thou took'st the charge of me, And when I suck't my mothers brest, And ever since, thou hast profest That thou my God wilt be. O let me not go then astray, Or with my sins drive thee away, Or misbehaviour; But as thou hast been still to me A Guardian, so cease not to be My God and Saviour. Inspire me with thy good motions, That with my best devotions I may thee feed and feast: I have prepar'd the sweet incense Of prayers, and wine of innocence; Come then and be my guest. GIGANTES. O how the serpent-footed Giants are Increased every where, Opposing God, and all his Ordinances, And on high pitch'd fancies Scale heaven, and fain would pull the holy one Down from his Chrystall throne. They study to intrap and circumvent The just and innocent; Their chief delight is in rebellion, Rapine, oppression; They hunt, and vex, and persecute the good, They shed and drink their blood; They rent the Church of Christ with Heresies, They belch out blasphemies Against the son of that fair mother-maid; By whom the world was made; Who lodg'd within that maiden-cherubin Nine moneths to purge our sin; From whose mouth issues out the two-edg'd sword Of his unconquered word, With which he will cut off, and quite subdue That proud and barbarous crue; Great master-Gunner of heavens Ordinance, Which makes thy lightnings glance, And shakes earths pillars with loud roaring thunders: Great Architect of wonders, Fling down thy thunder-bolts, and with thy darts Pierce all the Giants hearts Which would subvert our Church, and State, and King And all to ruine bring; Which sorrow at the peace and union Of happy Albion. Support me that I may not fall from grace, With that Ætnean race; And that I may not set my heart upon Earth and corruption, And so neglect my soul the better part, Lord humble so my heart, That I may not so in my thoughts aspire, As to incense thine ire; And keep me from ambitious fantasies, Proud words, and lofty eyes; And hold me back, lest I should clamber on Cloud-neighbouring mountains of Presumption. GORGONES. Quick-sighted Gorgons still we finde, Which can abroad each mote espy; But when they are at home they'r blinde, And cannot their own beams descry: Self-love so blindes their minde; That they see not Their own foul spot, Which they in others finde. All those whom Satan would surprise, And with more ease would overthrow, He first deprives them of their eyes, Then kills them with a fatall blow: If once we lose the eye Of knowledge, what Remains, but that Our soul in sin must dye. Who glory in your golden hair, And in smooth Alablaster skins; And think with Swans you may compare In whitenesse, that your cheeks and chins Can match while Lillies, and Vermilion, Yet think upon The flower that's in your hand. For as the lustre of the flower In your hand suddenly decayes, So beauty fades even in an hower: With ghastly looks we end our dayes, No grim-fac'd Gorgon can With worse aspect Our hearts deject, Then pale-fac'd lifelesse man. If thou hadst all perfection Of beauty which can mortalls grace, And could'st hold in subjection All things with thy bewitching face; Like sparkling stars what though Thy eyes do shine, And with divine Nectar thy lips doth flow. If thy teeth orient Pearls were, And were thy neck white ivory, If Musk, Perfume, or rosed air, Or Balm could vaporate from thee: If heav'ns best peece thou wert, Whose sweet aspect Could all subject, And maze each mortall heart. Yet shall these rare endowments all Prove in the end but vanity; Sweet honey shall conclude in gall, And beauty in deformity; See then you be not proud Of that which must Be laid in dust, Which Deaths black rail will shroud. Take heed likewise you dote not on Medusa's face and golden locks, For beauty hath kill'd many a one, And metamorphos'd men to Rocks: Then lest it should intice Thee, guard thy self From this strange elf, And hide thy wandring eyes. Lend me the shield of faith, O Lord, And helmet of salvation; And with thy Word that two-edg'd sword Cut off all foul infection: Support me with thy grace, And hide mine eyes, Lest sin surprise Me with her Gorgons face. O if there were but one fair eye, Of faith, truth, and religion Amongst us, O if we could flye With conquests golden pinion! And if we could subdue With brasen hands, Our captiv'd lands And circumcised crue. Lord with thy watchfull eye so keep Thy servant from security, That he may not be found asleep By his night-watching enemy: So with thy grace prevent me, Lest vanities My soul intice, Then in the end torment me. Great Captain of heavens winged troops, Redoubted and victorious Knight; To whose beck man and Angel stoops, Who puts thy enemies to flight: Who lets thine arrows flye, And dies their wings In blood of Kings Who will not bow to thee? Unsheath thy two-edg'd thundring sword, Cut off the dreadfull Gorgons head Which hath bewitch'd my soul, O Lord, And with grim looks hath struck me dead: Then will I sound thy praise, And magnifie Thy Majesty, And to thee Trophees raise. GRATIÆ. 1 O if my mournfull eyes Could from their Chrystall casements tears distill! O if sad Elegies Dipp'd in salt fountains could drop from my quill! O if I could in Seas of tears Drown all my sorrows and my fears! 2 For when alas I see How these three sister-Graces sit and grone, Faith, Hope, and Charity, And weep their wrongs, and threaten to be gone From Christs poor Church, how can I chuse But mourn with this my mourning Muse. 3 Faiths cloud-transcending eye, Thick mists of Verball combates do so blinde, That scarse can she descry The light from darknesse, and scarse can she finde Her Sun (which makes her so lament) Shining within his firmament. 4 She makes a grievous mone, That she is wrong'd 'twixt Infidelity And Superstition, Against the Laws of Christianity; The one with false fears makes her cry. The other would pull out her eye. 5 The swelling Pharisie Kicks her with his suppos'd perfection, And wrangling Heresie Would poyson her with strong infection; She is despised of the Jew, And laugh'd at by the heathen-crew. 6 The wanton Libertine Hath stript her of good works, her ornaments; And thus the fairest queen Of graces is abus'd by miscreants: Now would not this make hearts of stone Wring out a tear, and strain a grone. 7 Her sister Hope also Complains she's wrong'd by Desperation, And by her other foe, Bold-fac'd, self-will'd Presumption; They pull and hale with violence The Anchor of her Confidence. 8 With ghastly looks Despair, With horrid thoughts, and with blasphemous words, With uncomposed hair, Armed with poyson, halters, knives and swords, Doth threaten that she'l choke the breath Of Hope with some untimely death. 9 And fond Presumption Belyes poor Hope, and saith that she's the cause Of lust, ambition, Of pride, and of the breach of all Gods Laws: So th'one, Gods Mercie doth reject, The other doth his Justice check. 10 Thus Christian Hope is toss'd Between two rocks, and in the sinking sands, Her Anchor's almost lost; Therefore she sighs, and weeps, and wrings her hands; None but whose eyes are Adamant Can see this sight, and not lament. 11 And as for Charity, How is she hiss'd at, by a barbarous croud? And this her misery She doth lament, wrapt in a sable cloud; And threatens that she will be gone With speed out of this freezing Zone. 12 Where black-mouth'd obloquy, And squinting self-consuming envie reigns: Where brawling loves to be, Where murther with gore blood the country stains; Where Schisme with false opinion Disturbs the Churches union. 13 Where barbarous Mars resides Lord of mis-rule and desolation, And by whose bloody sides, Burning, rapes, ruine, rage, and oppression, Ride galloping, and furiously Tread down Laws, Arts, Civility. 14 Where discord, pride, scandall, Teeth-grinding anger, with fierce-glowing eyes, Where thefts and treasons dwell: Church-robbing, cheating, self-love, cruelties; This is that wicked company, All enemies to Charity. 15 What wonder is it then, If Charity be sad, and discontent, And hides her self from men? Amongst whom reigns this hellish Regiment? How can Joves lovely daughter dwell Amongst such monsters hatcht in hell? 16 O how my heart doth burn, And melt into a tide of tears, mine eyes! How night and day I mourn To see such wars, such wrongs, such cruelties, And love exil'd, which was as we All know, Christ's Will and Legacie? 17 O Lord confound all those Who would confound our peace and unity, And trample on the face Of thy three daughters, Faith, Hope, Charity, And let them in thy Church bear sway So long as evening crowns the day. 18 Lord give me Faiths cleer eye, And Hopes sure Anchor to rely upon, And hands of Charity, That I may work out my salvation; And with this Anchor, hands and eye, Let me in peace and comfort dye. 19 And let the good ship ride Call'd Charity, securely on the main; Be Pilot Lord, and guide Her to the cape of good Hope; let her gain The land of promise, with the gale Of thy good Spirit fill her sail. 20 And let her Compasse be Thy Word, and with the helm of Discipline From sinfull rocks keep me, And let the Pole-star of thy truth be seen; Let Faith the bright eye of my soul Be alwayes looking on that Pole. 21 The man of thy right hand Preserve Lord as the apple of thine eye; And from this sinfull land Let not true love with her two sisters flye: But as it's name is Albion, So in it still let all be one.
