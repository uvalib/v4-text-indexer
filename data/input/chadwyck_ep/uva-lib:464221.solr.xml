      <field name="fulltext">Ficta voluptatis causa sint proxima veris. Hor. de art Po.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Authour to his Booke. Come hither Booke, take counsell. He that goes Into the world, meetes with a world of foes. Thy Mother was my Muse, a gentle Dame, Who much ador'd Appollo's sacred name: Then being free-borne, know that thou art going Unto a world of Wits; still fresh, still growing: Yet wonder not, that I haue got no friend To write in thy behalfe! What! should I send Thee, like a Seruingman, with Letters? No. The World shall see thee first; and seeing, know Whether thou merit'st prayse: none shall haue cause To be condem'd of folly in the applause. Of thy harsh lines, the worst that can be thought Is this, That none would write, they were so naught. Alas, poore Booke, hunt not thou after prayse, Nor dare to stretch thy hand vnto the Bayes Vpon a Poets head: let it suffice To thee and me, the world doth vs despise. For 'tis a mad World, and it turnes on hinges, Whilst some a birding goe, and set their springes For to catch Woodcocks. Others sting and bite Like Wasps and Mastiffs, and doe take delight To quarrell with their shaddowes, nay, themselues, And their owne broode. Sure these are spitefull elues. Who at all Writers striue to haue a lerke: Meddle not with them, lest thou get a yerke: And yet their venamous breath (as on a Glasse) No sooner lighteth, but away doth passe. Then feare them not. The Wise, which know thee best, Will entertayne thee, as a welcome Ghest; Prayse that's prayse-worthy, winke at faults but small, Like thy conceits, and prayse thy vayne withall. Yet be not proude, though thou their prayse dost gayne, Remembring what is writ is writ in vayne. Tis for a better pen then mine to say By God 'tis good, and if you lik't you may. EPIGRAMS. Lectori. My Epigrams, like to a wandring Guest, Or tattard Souldier, that's but lately Prest, Your fauour craues, to grant a Passe vnto them, A greater kindnesse you can neuer doe them. Bibens his bountie. Bibens, to shew his liberalitie, Made Lusus drunke. A noble qualitie, And much esteemed, which Bibens fayne would proue, To be the Signe of his familiar loue. Lusus, beware, thou'lt finde him in the end Familier Deuill, no familier Friend. In Ducum. Ducus keepes house: and it with reason stands That he keepe house, that sold away his lands Omne Simile non est Idem. Together as we walkt, a friend of mine Mistook a painted Maddame for a Signe, That in a window stood; but I acquainted, Told him, it was no woodden Signe was painted, But Maddam (?.) Yea true, sayd he, Yet 'tis a Signe of little modestie. Graue panàus. What tell you vs that Milo bore a Bull! Is that so strange? Yon silke &amp; siluer Gull Beareth a Countrey Church vpon his backe. The lighter Bull made Milo's shoulders ake: A Steeple on his head, and at his heeles A Ring of Bells, and yet nor stoopes nor reeles. On a Shoemaker. What bootes it thee to follow such a Trade That's alwayes vnderfoote and vnderlayde? On Fuscus his valour. Fuscus the Bragart being, in field to fight, Protesting of his valour ouernight, Shaking his Sword, he swore, Now by this hand. Ile fight and kill so long as I can stand. The Field was pitcht: and now begins the fray; And Fuscus now begins to runne away, Nor euer stints his course, vntill by flight He had outrunne the danger of the fight. The Combat ended, Fuscus he was wanting, And found ere long, where he for feare stood panting. And thus they mockt him; You swore by your hand, You'ld fight and kill so long as you could stand. 'Tis true (sayd one,) but pray doe Fuscus right; For Fuscus neyther stood to kill nor fight. Ad Rinaldum amic. See, see, Rinaldus! Prethee who is that That weares yon great greene Fether in his hat, Like to some Tilter? Sure it is some Knight, Whose wits being greene, his head must needs be light. In Lusiam. Lvsia, who scornes all others imitations, Cannot abide to be out-gone in fashions: She sayes, she cannot haue a Hat or Ruffe. A Gowne, a Pettycoate, a Band, or Cuffe, But that these Citizens (whom she doth hate) Will get into't, at nere so deare a rate: But Lusia now doth such a fashion follow, Whose Hayre is Flax, and Band as Saffron yellow, That there's no Citizen, what ere she be, Can be transformed so like an Owle as she. In Lincum. Lincus the Draper, for his more auayle, Dams vp his lights to set his Ware to sayle; And counts it (in his Art) a misterie To gayne by lying, oaths, and flatterie: But take this rule, If Lincus his lights stoppe, Deeme you his conscience darker then his shoppe. Destruit ædificat mutat quadrata rotundis. A man there was (which here shall not be nam'd) that with great cost a wondrous building fram'd; But as the building rose, the Builders purse Did pine in substance, (Builders common curse.) It cost him many a pound: but that's no matter. Slightly being built, the building gan to tatter: And by mischance, downe salls of it a part. The Workmen (they being glad with all their heart) Come to their Master, thereof to complayne, And askt his leaue to ayse it vp agayne. Nay soft (quoth he) it is a question whether More may fall downe; let's set vp all together. Canutus reformation. Canutus now will be no more a Ranger, But Marryed liue, and lye at Rack and Manger. So meanes not shee. Well, if she goe to grasse, Hee'll prooue an Oxe, that was before an Asse. On a Maydens choyse. A parent to his Childe this counsell gaue, Quoth he, My Girle, two Suiters thou must haue, The one is yong and faire, vertuous &amp; wise, Of worthiest Stocke, and rarest qualities: The other different, both in age and nature, Nyther so fit, nor yet so sweete a Creature; Yet be resolued, and make that Suiter blest Whom in thy loue thou thinkst the Worthiest? Straight she replyes, Since choyce is left to mee, Nature commands, that Age with Age agree, Vertue and Loue compell my heart thereto To loue the youngman; and in truth I doe. Why, but (sayd he) be not mistaken than, Conceiue, the Elder is the better man. How so, quoth she! it's a Paradox to mee, How being the woorse, he can the better bee; In Pigmeum. Little Pigmeus weares his Mistris Gloue, Her Ring, and Feather, (Fauours of her loue.) Who could but laugh, to see the little Dwarfe Grace out himselfe with her imbrodered Scarfe? 'Tis strange, yet true, her Gloue, Ring, Scarfe and Fan, Makes him (vnhansome) a welfauoured man. Flemminius Sickenesse. Flemminius nere was sicke; yet was it sed Flemmenius he was sicke, yea, sicke and dead: His Friends lamented, shedding many a teare: At length it came vnto Flemminius eare, Who thus gaue answer; Neuer let them feare it, The Newes is ill, yet am I glad to heare it. In Oblitum. I wondred much (as I had wondrous reason) Oblitus should, within so short a season, Forsake, forget his old and ancient friend, For whom he oft had vow'd his life to spend: I was not altred much, but so was hee, From low estate, to higher dignitie, Yet knew I him; hath he forgotten me? Preferment then hath spoyld his memorie: Yet this I know, 'Tis but his paltry pelfe. He knowes me well; but he forgets himselfe. Lucus Iourney. Lvcus that traueld with an hundred pound, Was rob'd, and left wel beaten, and fast bound: But when to share their prize they had begun, No miracle was wrought, yet he vndone. Nimis Amor. Two friends (that had not met a long time since) Together supt: but at their parting thence, Tom swore hee'd haue Kit home: but all in vayne. Kit swore as fast hee'd haue Tom backe agayne. In kindnesse thus they striue, and striuing goe From home to home: nor could they end it so; But too and fro, walking through many a Streete: It now being late, the Constable they meete. He gaue command; his Bil-men quickly staid them, And took th? thence, &amp; in the Compter laid them. And thus by Fortune was a meanes prouided To end the strife, which could not be decided: All which was well, but that that fell out worse; They saued their oath, but could not saue their purse. In Priscus commendations of his Mistris. Priscus commends his Mistres for a Girle, Whose lips are Rubies, &amp; whose teeth are pearle. They neede prooue so, or else it will be found He payes too deare, they cost him many a pound: Ultra posse non est esse. How should Ruttillo lose his purse last night, And 20. shillings in it? was't not by slight? Why? he came in no crowd. What, did hee play? No. Hee's no Gamester. Did he no debts pay? Nor Fee no Lawyers? Neyther. Was he not drunk? Neyther. Nor did bestow it on his Punke? Why, then the question's this; If none of these, How should he lose what he had not to leese? In Rufum. As Rufus prays'd his Beauer Hat of late, One that stood by (striking him o're the pate) Sayd it was felt. Rufus would not beleeue it. He stroke againe, till Rufus did conceiue it. So darke was the conceit, that out of doubt, He nere had found, had he not felt it out. In Cornutum. Why should Cornutus Wife lie in the Strand, And hee, poore silly man, lye in the Citie? Belike the Shop was not sufficient man'd. To part the Head and Members yet 'tis pittie: But what cares she for head; I hope she scornes Were he seauen heads, shee'd crowne him with ten hornes. Richards mourning. When his old Master buried was with cost, Dick had a mourning Cloke, but it was lost. The Corse to Churchward goes, ech takes his turne, But Dick took none: for Richard could not mourne. Yes, that he did; the Company he forsooke, And mourn'd not in, but mourned for his Cloke. Flaccu's payment. Flaccus came to a Tauerne, there to dine, Cal'd for good store of meat, great store of wine, The Reckoning brought, Flaccus sayes not a word, Nor drawes his purse; but out he drawes his sword: Some say he proffer'd wrong; but how thinke you? He drew vpon the Drawer, pay'd his due. He owed him the reckoning but of late: Hath he not scored, and payd him on the pate? On Iustice her entertaynment. Iustice came downe from heauen of late to be A perfect Iudge, without partialitie: But when that Iustice to the Bench was come, The Bench it was so full she had no roome; So backe she tooke her flight vnto the heauens, And left the world againe at sixe and seauens. Iustice her reward. Ivstice fledde vp to heauen, some say was blinde: Why so is many a Iustice left behinde: But Iustice being blinde, the cause regarded, Respected none, nor neuer was rewarded. So say not all, some of the Bench agrees, That Iustice kept a Clarke to take her fees. In Briscum. His Father being dead, Briscus was told, And found ere long where was his fathers gold, All Angels rich, but poorely clad in leather. Briscus tooke pitty on them, and straight hither Sends some for Sattin, other some for Tissue, Gloues, Scarfes, Hats, Hangers: but now marke the issue, They all being freed, did all consent together, And took their flight, poor Briscus knows not whither, which he lam?ts, blaming those former kings, Who made a Law, he might not clippe their wings. In Ledam. Because I'me black &amp; swarfe, Leda doth scorn me, And if I marry her, she vowes shee'l horne me: But Leda, know (I speak't not in disgrace) Your red and white is but a pybauld face. Enigma. As often as I please it changeth forme. It is no Coward, though it doe no harme: Tis neuer hurt, nor euer doth it feede, Tis nothing worth, yet nothing doth it neede. Swiftly it runnes, yet neuer maketh sound, And once being lost, againe 'tis neuer found. 'Tis a fit Seruant for a Gentleman, And a true patterne for a Seruingman. 'Tis borne a Gyant, liues a Dwarfe, and nigh Vnto its death, a Gyant doth it dye. Ad bonos socios. Old Women told vs tales long time agoe, Of Robbin Goodfellow, what he would doe, Who now they say is gone: but yet wee finde, There's many of his name are left behinde. In Pratum Iur: cons. I asked Pratus what was his Profession? He sayd a Lawyer, who by his discretion, Could right and wrong, according to the Law, To cherrish Vertue, and keepe Vice in Awe: I know it contrary, and full of Ire, Setting his Awe aside, I call'd him Lier. On Captaine Drake his Voyage. Some thinke it true, whilst other some do doubt, Whether Capt. Drake compast the world about. Some say he did it in the Deuils name, And none ere since could doe the like againe: But these are al deceiued, why should they doubt it They know each yeere there's some that goe about it. Ad amicam. I I am the happiest ere inioy'd a Loue, u You are the first did euer constant proue: ly. Lye down my wandring thoughts, th? take your rest, an. An blessed once, continue euer blest. Answere. Na. Na, he that shall at our affections grutch, yl. Ill be his Fortune, since my prayer is such: u. You loue me now, let not affections seuer, I. loue you now, and I shall loue you euer. Will's error. Will sayes his Wife's so fat, she scarce can go: But she as nimbly answeres, Faith sir, no. Alas, good Will, thou art mistaken quite, For all men know that she is wondrous light. Spinus his choyce. Spinus would wed, but he would haue a Wench That hath all Tongues, Italian, Spanish, French, But I diswade him; for if she hath any, She hath enough; if two, sh'as two too many. To M?. Richard Moore, one of the Masters of the Chancery, on his name. For to be Rich and hard, or hard and Rich, Is not thy nature, though thy name be such: For to be Rich 'tis hard, but thou hast store Of Riches, Honour, yet of Vertue more: Which Vertue, Honour, Riches now adayes Being hard to get, More great must be thy prayse, So I, and all that know thee, doe agree, The More's the pittie there's no More like thee. To the Bookeseller. Nay, feare not Bookeseller, this Booke will sell: For be it good, as thou know'st very well, All will goe buy it; but say it be ill, All will goe by it too: thus thou sei'st still. Vulcans Marriage. Vulcan and Venus were together wedded: But Mars charg'd is, &amp; Vulcans Venus bedded. what thogh the Smith were black, &amp; she were white, She might haue ask't him leaue, for leaue is light: Why so is she, what then? why then she scornes But to make vp the waight with Uulcan's hornes. In Borachium. Borachio sayd, Wine made his head too light, And therfore would not drinke it: yet last night Carowsing healths, so heauy was his head, He fell asleepe, and there was left for dead: Within a while he wak't, and found for right, The Wine had made his purse, not head, too light. In Dominam Membrosam. Madam Membrosa had to me a suite, To set forth her good parts: and thus I'le do't: Setting a side thy iudgement, and thy wit, (Which though but little is) for thee more fit: First, of rare Complexion thou hast store, And when 'tis gone, 'knowst well where to haue more. Then, for thy Hayre, (nay, thinke not I doe flatter) It cost thee to the Tire man, no small matter. Fingers like Spiders clawes; nay, not so thicke, And yet to picke a Pocket farre more quicke. Thou a small Foote, nor a short Heele do'st lacke, Which makes thee fall so often on thy backe. As for thy other Parts (which I know least) Thou get'st thy liuing by; sure those are best. Theeues falling out, true men come by their goods. Two cheating Mates, whose only trade was shift, To cheate a Countrey fellow was their drift: The place being fit, they quarrel'd, and fell out, And needes at Buffets they would haue a bout: The honest man stept in to part the fray; But they in bustling, Nim'd his Purse away: Which after missing, he (poore man) laments, And that he parted them, greatly repents: But they being parted, part what they had got, And laughed amaine at the poore simple sot, Swearing, the Ancient Prouerbe they had crost, Since they fell out, and he his goods had lost. On the sixe Cases. No. Nanta was nominated for a Whore, Gin. For that she had bin Ginitiue before: Da. Notice hereof was to the Iustice giuen, Acc. Who her accused, that she had loosely liuen; Uo. But she cry'd mercy, and her fault vpript', Abl. And so was tane away, and soundly whipt. Her Case was ill: yet will the question be, Being thus declin'd, in what a case was she? Ad Lectorem. Is't possible that thou my Booke hast bought, That sayd'st 'twas nothing worth! why was it naught: Read it again, perchance thy wit was dul, Thou mayst finde something at the second pull: Indeed at first thou naught didst vnderstand, For shame get something at the second hand. On Luce's maintenance. Hee that takes paines shall get, the Prouerbe goes; But Luce takes pleasure, yet doth nothing lose. Poore labouring Porters, with much toyle &amp; sweat, Scarce get sufficient Victuals for to eate: But if that Luce at any time doth lacke, She with her belly can maintayne her backe. Peters trouble. Peter is troubled with a froward Wife, Whose curstnesse makes him wearie of his life: The simple fellow, (with her rayling crost) Hath often wish't that she her tongue had lost. Alas (poore Peter) sure thy case is ill, When shee'le nor lose her tongue, nor keepe it still. Parnels comfort. Parnell, being taken in the very Act, Was sent vnto Bride-well, for such her fact: But be contented, Parnell, cease to mourne, Th'art at the Wheele of Fortune, make it turne. In Duellum. Stratus and Stremon went to Field to fight, Stratus was slayne, and Stremon taken streight; He being condem'd, was saued: yet by this strife, The one, his liuing; th'other lost his life. In Bachum &amp; Uenèrem. Bachus and Venus well accord together: And whither Bachus goes, Venus goes thither: Bachus backs Uenus; Venus for his paine, Pleasureth Bachus on her backe againe. On Venter the Merchant. Venter the Merchant is runne madde, they say, On the report his Ships are cast away. What, did he Venter with his goods his wits, That he is falne into these franticke fits? Then, peraduenture, it may well be found, The Sea his goods, and he his wits hath drown'd. To the Gentlewomen Painters. Appelles, famous for the Art of Painting, Vnto whose worke there naught but life was w?ting; Had he c?par'd, or held with you the strife, He had not wonne, yours comes so neere the life: Your Portractures you make to speake and goe, Appelles workmanship could nere doe so. Tempora a mutantur &amp; nos mutamur in illis. To be a Whore-master, in former time, Was by our Fathers counted a base crime: How mach the world's worse then it was before, Each Gallant makes his Mistris of his Whore. Ad Iur: cons. Words wisely set are worth much gold, So were we by our ancient Fathers told, And so we doe beleeue: Experience then Doth teach vs, Lawyers are the wisest men. Tom's bargaine. Tom should haue payd ten shillings for a Sword But would not take it on the Cutlers word; He bid him try't, he did, at the first stroke It prou'd not worth a point, the point was broke. To Mistris E. S. Let but thy beautious eyes looke on this line, To see, as in thy Glasse, thy beautie shine, Which beauty nature gaue thee to disgrace Our latter Artists, who make vp a face Of seeming beautie, for to blinde such eyes, As with Pigmalion them doe Idolize. Should I not praise, what I praise-worthy see, I should doe wrong to nature and to thee: Yet, whilst I speake thee faire, so short I come Of thy perfection, that I'me deem'd by some To light the shining Sunne: Yet from my hand Receiue this graine vnto thy heape of sand. Epitaph. Stay, doe not passe! here fixe your eyes Vpon a Virgins Obsequies! Pay Tribute to a troubled heart, T'is but a teare before you part: And what are teares? They are but streames Of sorrow, which, like frightfull dreames, Disturbe your sences—Yet I craue No other Sacrifice to haue: But if you passe, and let fall none, Y'are harder then this Marble stone. Your loue is colder, and your eyes As senselesse of my miseries. On my Uenture in Sir Walter Rawleigh's Voiage. I being perswaded (not by reason led) For Gold vnto Gwyan aduentured; Great were our hopes of good successe; for none Expected lesse to gaine then fiue for one: But following Fate (she fickle) thither led, Where neyther they of Gold nor Siluer sped: But, poore, distrest, homeward returne againe, Mony, liues, labour, all was spent in vaine. The hopefull necke of their designe was broke; For all their Gold was vanish't into Smoke. Thus I lost all; wherefore it is a signe The found no Mine of gold, yet gold of mine. A Data fata sequtus. The Motto on Sir Walter Rawghlie's Armes. In Costum. Costus his custome stole; but by the way The Wayters met him, and his goods did stay: He it denyes, and proffers those to bring, Should proue it was no vnaccustomed thing. He meant to steale. If so? why should they choose Such Customes, rather to finde them loose. On Smithfield. T'was Faire at Smithfield once, but once a yeere; At Bartholmetide: but now the Cities care Hath mad it fayre at all times, paued it round. T'is twentie shillings better by the pound. Nor haue they much bestowed their cost amisse, Since there's no Soile so plentifull as this; Heere's Hay in great abundance, heads of Cattell; As Horses, Oxen, hither come to battle: Yet what is strangest, It nere needeth dressing. Here is the horne of plentie. Uulcans blessing. Epitaph on a Foote-man. This nimble Foote-man ran away from Death; And here he rested, being out of breath. Here Death him ouertooke, made him his slaue, And sent him of an Arrant to his Graue. Censures on the Voyage to Gwyana. Svndry oppinions abroad are spred, Why the Gwyanians no better sped; Some say, they were preuented out of Spayne, Others, because some did returne agayne: Some say, 'twas sicknesse: others, their abode So long ere they put from the English Rode. Some say, their General's absence: but the most Say, Captaine K'emish death, when he was lost, All was ouerthrowne, he onely was to doe it, And that Sir Walter came but Rawly to it. On a Scriuener. I told a Scriuener of his Briberie, His Broking, Forging, Cheating, Knauery, He sayd, he heard me not; so't may appeare, How could he heare, that had no Eares to heare? Ad Templum pro bonis. Haile to this holy place, this ancient seate, Where Iustice, ioyn'd with wisedome doth intreat Of right &amp; wrong, &amp; reads her sacred Lawes, More for deuotions sake, then for applause. This is the place chosen to be the helme, Where Iustice sits, to steare about the Realme. Both law and equitie, hence Iustice driues The Charriot of fayre peace, and leades in Gyues, Wrong, and oppression, throughout the Land, Whilst peace and plentie ride ioyn'd hand in hand. This is Astrea's Temple, which is greac't With many a golden Vessell, which are plac't In places eminent. Those Astrea blesse; And blessing, make their number numberlesse. De Templo in malos. Saint Peters and S. Pauls are in disgrace: The Middle Temple, that the onely place, Whither both Citie and the Countrey come, As to the Temple of Ierusalem, To heare the Law, and many a Iew to proffer; As many an angell. None must come to offer A Widdowes mite: For how should liue the Scribes, But by false profits, and by double bribes? Doues are brought hither to be bought and sold, And Countrey Clyants bring their bags of gold Hither to change Both friends, and foes, &amp; strangers Are vs'd alike, for these are Money changers. This is a Sanctuary that is free For all but Sarjants; yet we doe agree, There's many good, and graue, whom these things greeues, Wer't not for them, 'twere but a denne of theeues. Sextus Purchase. It may be true (for Sextus in it stands,) That he hath purchased great store of Lands: But 'tis conceald: yea marry, so't may be, For I am sure 'twas neuer knowne to me. What if he lyes? Why, then the question's, whether The Truth and Lands bee both conceal'd together. Yea, that they are: for if the truth were knowne, The Lands would soone be found, but few or none. Mirabilie Uisu. When old Pencchio came first to towne, And saw the Coaches r?ning vp &amp; down, Staring vpon them long, he hoopt alowd: The people thronging round him made a crowd, And askt him, what he meant? Quoth he I hooted Because before I nere saw women booted. On the Lotteries. Some doe condemne our late great Lotteries, And say they were but tricks and fopperies For to get money: This is all the thanke They giue the Founders; yet all were not blanke. One myracle it wrought, say what they can, It made a Tayler for to be a Man. Currit mercator ad Indos. Some fondly thinke our great East-India Trade Hath all our other Merchants beggars made; And that they carry men, and money store, To kill our Marriners, and make vs poore. These are confuted all, and held as vaine, In eighteene Moneths they now returne againe: Returne a gaine said I? Nay, but a losse, If they lose men and money, but for drosse. On the High Spring tide at the Shewes at the Palsgraue's Wedding. The Sea fled in, willing to see this sport, That to the neighbouring Lands she might report Their valiant Prowesse, and each glyding flood, Came rowling in; &amp; each streame would haue stood For to participate these warlike Shewes, So that the Thames could hardly them enclose: For some, to be spectators of the sight, Got vp vpon the bancks to see them fight. On Iustice Ballance. Some doe paint Iustice sitting in her state, With Scales &amp; Ballance to giue each his waight: Surely her Scales are euen, so thinke I, And that the beame hangs not in Iustice eye. Old Siluium. Siluius by Simmony a Liuing got, And he liu'd well vpon it. 'Pray why not? For he the poore did pill, the rich did lurch, And so became a Piller of the Church. De perochia beatæ Mariæ de Arcubus. An Archer, bragging, sayd, he well did know How to bring any man vnto his bow: Yet, when he put his knowledge into vse, Hee hardly could say Bo vnto a Goose. Ex abundantia cordes os loquitur. The mouth speaks fr? the abundance of the heart, So were we taught: but they haue found an Art, Lately at Westminster, which is farre woorse, Most mouthes speake from th'abundance of the purse. Ad Lectorem Candidum. My Booke arraign'd for causes criminall, Must dye a death which is vnnaturall: A Iury Ignorant haue past vpon it, And found it guiltie: So there is throwne on it Many contemptuous speeches, in so much As I appeale to you, whose wisedome's such As errs not, and craue Iudgement from your breath, Whether it shall be burnt or prest to death.</field>
