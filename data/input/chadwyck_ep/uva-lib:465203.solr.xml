As a Faithful Testimony of The AUTHOR'S Gratitude and Esteem, By his most Obedient, And Obliged Humble Servant, ROBERT LLOYD. FAMILIAR EPISTLE To ? Apothecary. When once a man so far is gone To wet his lips at Helicon, Not all the hellebore, which you Buy in, the Lord knows what to do, His head can settle, or restore His reason as it was before. Talk about physic, what you will, And magnify the doctor's skill, Mention the names of all the college, Those shining miracles of knowledge, Or more to justify your praise, Call in the learn'd of former days, Let Mead, Friend, Boorehave, Ratcliffe join, Their mighty-knowing heads to thine, Consult together, and survey The whole Materia Medica, The various powers of med'cine state, And find out virtues, or create, Try all old ways, if they won't do Experimentally try new; And when all's ended, rest assur'd, Poetic madness can't be cur'd. When haughty CÃ¦lia's vain desires Inflame her brain, and fancy fires, When on her bed she sits elate And takes it for a throne of state, And with a sceptre made of straw Keeps the subjected world in awe; Or when Clarissa, hapless fair, With downcast eye, and pensive air Treads her lone cell, and now complains Of broken vows, and perjur'd swains, Now blames her own too easy heart, Which took the base deluder's part; Or when the poet's rowling eye Proclaims his hour of phrenzy nigh, When on imaginary horse From pole to pole he takes his course, Or, of fantastick trophies proud, Bestrides some easy-pacing cloud, Or wildly running thro' the streets, Pours couplets out to all he meets; Can Addington, with all his care, The shatter'd seat of sense repair? When Madness (now my worthy friend, I must insist that you'll attend, For of distinctions fond I'm grown, And so will make one of my own, A nice distinction, not a jot It matters whether true or not, For he proceeds on surest grounds Who, when he can't convince, confounds, And to the credit of his brain, Puzzles the cause he can't maintain) When Madness, of all sorts and sizes, From bodily disease arises, Whether the blood half froze remains, And scarce moves lab'ring thro' the veins, Or, over-hot with sanguine pride, Impetuous rolls her rapid tide, If the mind is no more affected, Than as with body 'tis connected, Physic may then of service prove, Abate the grief, perhaps remove; But if the body and the brain Only, t'oblige the mind, complain, And the distemper's in the heart, It is beyond the reach of art. But to distinguish farther stillâ Read it or not, just as you will, Or, if you read, commend or blame, To me, old boy, 'tis all the same; Say, if you please, perhaps say true, This nothing is to me or you, Or say, what observation says Of many great men now-adays, Of most indeed, that I am one Of great distinction, judgment none. But once more to return, for this You'll read in a parenthesis, Tho' I had left you in the dark By leaving out the usual mark. All-kinds of Madness, we shall find, Ev'n those which spring out of the mind, More readily a cure admit, Than that which flows from Love of Wit. In other phrenzies pain's endur'd, The patient wishes to be cur'd, If e'er some lucid interval The scatter'd rays of sense recal; Whereas the poet's highest pleasure, And frequently his only treasure, In Madness lies; his joys still vary, Joys real or imaginary, As his head turns, and he's most blest, When most with Madness he's possest. PhÅbus himself, that we may quote Example of undoubted note, PhÅbus, who well is known to be Of Physic, God, and Poetry, When first he found by symptoms sure His brain affected, thought of cure; Try'd ev'ry way, but try'd in vain, To settle his distracted brain. Convinc'd at length, that nought would do, The useless drugs aside he threw, And smiling to the list'ning croud This maxim he declar'd aloud (A maxim since most sacred had) No Poet's wise who is not mad. POEMATA. AN ELEGY, Written in a Country Church-Yard. By Mr. GRAY. The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea, The plowman homeward plods his weary way, And leaves the world to darkness and to me. Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight, And all the air a solemn stillness holds, Save where the beetle wheels his drony flight, And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds; Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r The moping owl does to the moon complain Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r, Molest her ancient, solitary reign. Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade, Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap, Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep. The breezy call of incense-breathing morn, The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed, The cock's shrill clarion, or the ecchoing horn, No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn, Or busy housewife ply her evening care: No children run to lisp their sire's return, Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share. Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield, Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke; How jocund did they drive their team afield! How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke! Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-trees shade, Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap, Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep. The breezy call of incense-breathing morn, The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed, The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn, No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn, Or busy housewife ply her evening care: No children run to lisp their sire's return, Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share. Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield, Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke! How jocund did they drive their team afield! How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke! Let not ambition mock their useful toil, Their homely joys, and destiny obscure; Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile, The short and simple annals of the poor. The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r, And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave, Await alike th'inevitable hour. The paths of glory lead but to the grave. Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault, If Mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise, Where thro' the long-drawn isle and fretted vault The pealing anthem swells the note of praise. Can storied urn or animated bust Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath? Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust, Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death? Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire: Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd, Or wak'd to extasy the living lyre. But knowledge to their eyes her ample page, Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll; Chill penury repress'd their noble rage, And froze the genial current of the soul. Full many a gem of purest ray serene The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear; Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air. Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast The little tyrant of his fields withstood; Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood. Th'applause of list'ning senates to command, The threats of pain and ruin to despise, To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land, And read their history in a nation's eyes, Their lot forbad: nor circumscrib'd alone Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd; Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne, And shut the gates of mercy on mankind, The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide, To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame, Or heap the shrine of luxury and pride With incense kindled at the Muse's flame. Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife, Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray; Along the cool sequester'd vale of life They kept the noiseless tenor of their way. Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect, Some frail memorial still erected nigh, With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd, Implores the passing tribute of a sigh. Their name, their years, spelt by th'unletter'd Muse, The place of fame and elegy supply: And many a holy text around she strews, That teach the rustic moralist to die. For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey, This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd, Left the warm precincts of the chearful day, Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind? On some fond breast the parting soul relies, Some pious drops the closing eye requires; Ev'n from the tomb the voice of nature cries, Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires. For thee, who, mindful of th'unhonour'd dead, Dost in these lines their artless tale relate; If chance, by lonely contemplation led, Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate, Haply some hoary-headed swain may say, âOft have we see him at the peep of dawn âBrushing with hasty steps the dews away âTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn. âThere at the foot of younder nodding beech âThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high, âHis listless length at noon-tide would he stretch, âAnd pore upon the brook that babbles by. âHard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn, âMutt'ring his wayward fancies he wou'd rove; âNow drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn, âOr craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love. âOne morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill, âAlong the heath and near his fav'rite tree: âAnother came; nor yet beside the rill, âNor up the lawn, nor at the woods was he. âThe next with dirges due, in sad array, âSlow through the church-yard path we saw him born, âApproach and read (for thou can'st read) the lay, âGrav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn. SONG, by a Person of Quality From Pope's Works.. Flutt'ring spread thy purple pinions, Gentle Cupid, o'er my heart; I a slave in thy dominions; Nature must give way to art. Mild Arcadians, ever blooming, Nightly nodding o'er your flocks, See my weary days consuming, All beneath yon flow'ry rocks. Thus the Cyprian goddess weeping, Mourn'd Adonis, darling youth: Him the Boar in silence creeping, Gor'd with unrelenting tooth. Cynthia, tune harmonious numbers; Fair Discretion, string the lyre; Sooth my ever-waking slumbers: Bright Apollo, lend thy choir! Gloomy Pluto, king of terrors, Arm'd in adamantine chains, Lead me to the crystal mirrors, Wat'ring soft Elysian plains. Mournful cypress, verdant willow, Gilding my Aurelia's brows, Morpheus hov'ring o'er my pillow, Hear me pay my dying vows. Melancholy, smooth MÃ¦ander Swiftly purling in a round, On thy margin lovers wander, With thy flow'ry chaplets crown'd. Thus when Philomela drooping, Softly seeks her silent mate, See the bird of Juno stooping; Melody resigns to fate.</field>
