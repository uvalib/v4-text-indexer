HEROIC STANZAS CONSECRATED TO THE MEMORY OF HIS HIGHNESS OLIVER, LATE LORD PROTECTOR OF THIS COMMONWEALTH. WRITTEN AFTER THE CELEBRATING OF HIS FUNERAL. I And now 'tis time; for their officious haste, Who would before have borne him to the sky, Like eager Romans, ere all rites were past, Did let too soon the sacred eagle fly. II Though our best notes are treason to his fame, Joined with the loud applause of public voice; Since heaven, what praise we offer to his name, Hath rendered too authentic by its choice; III Though in his praise no arts can liberal be, Since they, whose muses have the highest flown, Add not to his immortal memory, But do an act of friendship to their own, IV Yet 'tis our duty, and our interest too, Such monuments as we can build to raise; Lest all the world prevent what we should do, And claim a title in him by their praise. V How shall I then begin, or where conclude, To draw a fame so truly circular? For in a round, what order can be shewed, Where all the parts so equal-perfect are? VI His grandeur he derived from heaven alone; For he was great, ere fortune made him so: And wars, like mists that rise against the sun, Made him but greater seem, not greater grow. VII No borrowed bays his temples did adorn, But to our crown he did fresh jewels bring; Nor was his virtue poisoned soon as born, With the too early thoughts of being king. VIII Fortune, (that easy mistress of the young, But to her ancient servants coy and hard,) Him at that age her favourites ranked among, When she her best-loved Pompey did discard. IX He, private, marked the faults of others' sway, And set as sea-marks for himself to shun; Not like rash monarchs, who their youth betray By acts their age too late would wish undone. X And yet dominion was not his design; We owe that blessing, not to him, but heaven, Which to fair acts unsought rewards did join; Rewards, that less to him, than us, were given. XI Our former chiefs, like sticklers of the war, First sought to inflame the parties, then to poise: The quarrel loved, but did the cause abhor; And did not strike to hurt, but make a noise. XII War, our consumption, was their gainful trade; We inward bled, whilst they prolonged our pain; He fought to end our fighting, and essayed To stanch the blood, by breathing of the vein. XIII Swift and resistless through the land he past, Like that bold Greek, who did the East subdue; And made to battles such heroic haste, As if on wings of victory he flew. XIV He fought, secure of fortune as of fame, Till by new maps the island might be shewn, Of conquests, which he strewed where'er he came, Thick as the galaxy with stars is sown. XV His palms, though under weights they did not stand, Still thrived; no winter could his laurels fade: Heaven, in his portrait, shewed a workman's hand, And drew it perfect, yet without a shade. XVI Peace was the prize of all his toil and care, Which war had banished, and did now restore: Bolognia's walls thus mounted in the air, To seat themselves more surely than before. XVII Her safety rescued Ireland to him owes; And treacherous Scotland, to no interest true, Yet blest that fate which did his arms dispose Her land to civilise, as to subdue. XVIII Nor was he like those stars which only shine, When to pale mariners they storms portend; He had his calmer influence, and his mien Did love and majesty together blend. XIX 'Tis true, his countenance did imprint an awe, And naturally all souls to his did bow; As wands of divination downward draw, And point to beds where sovereign gold doth grow. XX When, past all offerings to Feretrian Jove, He Mars deposed, and arms to gowns made yield; Successful councils did him soon approve, As fit for close intrigues, as open field. XXI To suppliant Holland he vouchsafed a peace, Our once bold rival in the British main; Now tamely glad her unjust claim to cease, And buy our friendship with her idol, gain. XXII Fame of the asserted sea, through Europe blown, Made France and Spain ambitious of his love; Each knew that side must conquer he would own, And for him fiercely, as for empire, strove. XXIII No sooner was the Frenchman's cause embraced, Than the light Monsieur the grave Don outweighed: His fortune turned the scale where'er 'twas cast, Though Indian mines were in the other laid. XXIV When absent, yet we conquered in his right; For, though some meaner artist's skill were shown, In mingling colours, or in placing light, Yet still the fair designment was his own. XXV For, from all tempers he could service draw; The worth of each, with its alloy, he knew; And, as the confidant of Nature, saw How she complexions did divide and brew. XXVI Or he their single virtues did survey, By intuition, in his own large breast; Where all the rich ideas of them lay, That were the rule and measure to the rest. XXVII When such heroic virtue heaven sets out, The stars, like commons, sullenly obey; Because it drains them when it comes about, And therefore is a tax they seldom pay. XXVIII From this high spring our foreign conquests flow, Which yet more glorious triumphs do portend; Since their commencement to his arms they owe, If springs as high as fountains may ascend. XXIX He made us freemen of the continent, Whom nature did like captives treat before; To nobler preys the English lion sent, And taught him first in Belgian walks to roar. XXX That old unquestioned pirate of the land, Proud Rome, with dread the fate of Dunkirk heard; And, trembling, wished behind more Alps to stand, Although an Alexander were her guard. XXXI By his command we boldly crossed the line, And bravely fought where southern stars arise; We traced the far-fetched gold unto the mine, And that, which bribed our fathers, made our prize. XXXII Such was our prince; yet owned a soul above The highest acts it could produce to show: Thus, poor mechanic arts in public move, Whilst the deep secrets beyond practice go. XXXIII Nor died he when his ebbing fame went less, But when fresh laurels courted him to live: He seemed but to prevent some new success, As if above what triumphs earth could give. XXXIV His latest victories still thickest came, As near the centre motion doth increase; Till he, pressed down by his own weighty name, Did, like the vestal, under spoils decease. XXXV But first the ocean as a tribute sent That giant prince of all her wat'ry herd; And the isle, when her protecting Genius went, Upon his obsequies loud sighs conferred. XXXVI No civil broils have since his death arose, But faction now by habit does obey; And wars have that respect for his repose, As winds for halcyons when they breed at sea. XXXVII His ashes in a peaceful urn shall rest; His name a great example stands, to show, How strangely high endeavours may be blessed, Where piety and valour jointly go. ASTRÆA REDUX. A POEM, ON THE HAPPY RESTORATION AND RETURN OF HIS SACRED MAJESTY, CHARLES THE SECOND. 1660. Jam redit et virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna. Virg. The last great age, foretold by sacred rhymes, Renews its finished course; Saturnian times Roll round again. Now with a general peace the world was blest, While ours, a world divided from the rest, A dreadful quiet felt, and worser far Than arms, a sullen interval of war. Thus when black clouds draw down the lab'ring skies, Ere yet abroad the winged thunder flies, An horrid stillness first invades the ear, And in that silence we the tempest fear. The ambitious Swede, like restless billows tost, On this hand gaining what on that he lost, Though in his life he blood and ruin breathed, To his now guideless kingdom peace bequeathed; And heaven that seemed regardless of our fate, For France and Spain did miracles create; Such mortal quarrels to compose in peace, As nature bred, and interest did increase. We sighed to hear the fair Iberian bride Must grow a lily to the lily's side; While our cross stars denied us Charles his bed, Whom our first flames and virgin love did wed. For his long absence church and state did groan; Madness the pulpit, faction seized the throne: Experienced age in deep despair was lost, To see the rebel thrive, the loyal crost: Youth, that with joys had unacquainted been, Envied grey hairs, that once good days had seen: We thought our sires, not with their own content, Had, ere we came to age, our portion spent. Nor could our nobles hope their bold attempt, Who ruined crowns, would coronets exempt: For when, by their designing leaders taught To strike at power, which for themselves they sought, The vulgar, gulled into rebellion, armed, Their blood to action by the prize was warmed. The sacred purple, then, and scarlet gown, Like sanguine dye to elephants, was shewn. Thus, when the bold Typhœus scaled the sky, And forced great Jove from his own heaven to fly, (What king, what crown, from treason's reach is free, If Jove and Heaven can violated be?) The lesser gods, that shared his prosperous state, All suffered in the exiled Thunderer's fate. The rabble now such freedom did enjoy, As winds at sea, that use it to destroy: Blind as the Cyclops, and as wild as he, They owned a lawless savage liberty, Like that our painted ancestors so prized, Ere empire's arts their breast had civilised. How great were then our Charles his woes, who thus Was forced to suffer for himself and us! He, tossed by fate, and hurried up and down, Heir to his father's sorrows, with his crown, Could taste no sweets of youth's desired age, But found his life too true a pilgrimage. Unconquered yet in that forlorn estate, His manly courage overcame his fate: His wounds he took, like Romans, on his breast, Which by his virtue were with laurels drest. As souls reach heaven, while yet in bodies pent, So did he live above his banishment. That sun, which we beheld with cozened eyes Within the water, moved along the skies. How easy 'tis, when destiny proves kind, With full-spread sails to run before the wind! But those, that 'gainst stiff gales laveering go, Must be at once resolved, and skilful too. He would not, like soft Otho, hope prevent, But stayed, and suffered fortune to repent. These virtues Galba in a stranger sought, And Piso to adopted empire brought. How shall I then my doubtful thoughts express, That must his suffering both regret and bless! For, when his early valour heaven had crost, And all at Worc'ster but the honour lost; Forced into exile from his rightful throne, He made all countries where he came his own; And, viewing monarchs' secret arts of sway, A royal factor for their kingdoms lay. Thus, banished David spent abroad his time, When to be God's anointed was his crime; And, when restored, made his proud neighbours rue Those choice remarks he from his travels drew. Nor is he only by afflictions shown To conquer others' realms, but rule his own; Recovering hardly what he lost before, His right endears it much, his purchase more. Inured to suffer ere he came to reign, No rash procedure will his actions stain: To business ripened by digestive thought, His future rule is into method brought; As they who first proportion understand, With easy practice reach a master's hand. Well might the ancient poets then confer On Night the honoured name of Counsellor; Since, struck with rays of prosperous fortune blind, We light alone in dark afflictions find. In such adversities to sceptres trained, The name of Great his famous grandsire gained; Who yet, a king alone in name and right, With hunger, cold, and angry Jove did fight; Shocked by a covenanting League's vast powers, As holy and as catholic as ours: Till Fortune's fruitless spite had made it known, Her blows not shook, but riveted, his throne. Some lazy ages, lost in sleep and ease, No action leave to busy chronicles: Such, whose supine felicity but makes In story chasms, in epoches mistakes; O'er whom Time gently shakes his wings of down, Till with his silent sickle they are mown. Such is not Charles his too too active age, Which, governed by the wild distempered rage Of some black star, infecting all the skies, Made him at his own cost, like Adam, wise. Tremble, ye nations, who, secure before, Laughed at those arms that 'gainst ourselves we bore; Roused by the lash of his own stubborn tail, Our Lion now will foreign foes assail. With alga, who the sacred altar strews? To all the sea-gods Charles an offering owes: A bull to thee, Portunus, shall be slain, A lamb to you, ye tempests of the main: For those loud storms, that did against him roar, Have cast his shipwrecked vessel on the shore. Yet, as wise artists mix their colours so, That by degrees they from each other go; Black steals unheeded from the neighbouring white, Without offending the well-cozened sight: So on us stole our blessed change; while we The effect did feel, but scarce the manner see. Frosts, that constrain the ground, and birth deny To flowers that in its womb expecting lie, Do seldom their usurping power withdraw, But raging floods pursue their hasty thaw; Our thaw was mild, the cold not chased away, But lost in kindly heat of lengthened day. Heaven would no bargain for its blessings drive, But what we could not pay for, freely give. The Prince of Peace would, like himself, confer A gift unhoped, without the price of war: Yet, as he knew his blessing's worth, took care, That we should know it by repeated prayer; Which stormed the skies, and ravished Charles from thence, As heaven itself is took by violence. Booth's forward valour only served to show, He durst that duty pay, we all did owe: The attempt was fair; but heaven's prefixed hour Not come: so, like the watchful travellour, That by the moon's mistaken light did rise, Lay down again, and closed his weary eyes. 'Twas Monk, whom Providence designed to loose Those real bonds false freedom did impose. The blessed saints, that watched this turning scene, Did from their stars with joyful wonder lean, To see small clues draw vastest weights along, Not in their bulk, but in their order strong. Thus, pencils can, by one slight touch, restore Smiles to that changed face that wept before. With ease such fond chimeras we pursue, As fancy frames for fancy to subdue: But when ourselves to action we betake, It shuns the mint, like gold that chemists make. How hard was then his task, at once to be What in the body natural we see! Man's architect distinctly did ordain The charge of muscles, nerves, and of the brain, Through viewless conduits spirits to dispense; The springs of motion from the seat of sense. 'Twas not the hasty product of a day, But the well-ripened fruit of wise delay. He, like a patient angler, ere he strook, Would let them play a while upon the hook. Our healthful food the stomach labours thus, At first embracing what it straight doth crush. Wise leaches will not vain receipts obtrude, While growing pains pronounce the humours crude: Deaf to complaints, they wait upon the ill, Till some safe crisis authorise their skill. Nor could his acts too close a vizard wear, To 'scape their eyes whom guilt had taught to fear, And guard with caution that polluted nest, Whence Legion twice before was dispossest: Once sacred house, which when they entered in, They thought the place could sanctify a sin; Like those, that vainly hoped kind heaven would wink, While to excess on martyrs' tombs they drink. And, as devouter Turks first warn their souls To part, before they taste forbidden bowls, So these, when their black crimes they went about, First timely charmed their useless conscience out. Religion's name against itself was made; The shadow served the substance to invade: Like zealous missions, they did care pretend Of souls, in show, but made the gold their end. The incensed powers beheld with scorn, from high, An heaven so far distant from the sky, Which durst, with horses' hoofs that beat the ground, And martial brass, bely the thunder's sound. 'Twas hence, at length, just vengeance thought it fit To speed their ruin by their impious wit: Thus Sforza, cursed with a too fertile brain, Lost by his wiles the power his wit did gain. Henceforth their fougue must spend at lesser rate, Than in its flames to wrap a nation's fate. Suffered to live, they are like Helots set, A virtuous shame within us to beget; For, by example most we sinned before, And glass-like clearness mixed with frailty bore. But since, reformed by what we did amiss, We by our sufferings learn to prize our bliss: Like early lovers, whose unpractised hearts Were long the may-game of malicious arts, When once they find their jealousies were vain, With double heat renew their fires again. 'Twas this produced the joy, that hurried o'er Such swarms of English to the neighbouring shore, To fetch that prize, by which Batavia made So rich amends for our impoverished trade. Oh, had you seen from Scheveline's barren shore, (Crowded with troops, and barren now no more,) Afflicted Holland to his farewell bring True sorrow, Holland to regret a king! While waiting him his royal fleet did ride, And willing winds to their lower'd sails denied. The wavering streamers, flags, and standart out, The merry seamen's rude but cheerful shout; And last the cannon's voice that shook the skies, And, as it fares in sudden ecstasies, At once bereft us both of ears and eyes. The Naseby, now no longer England's shame, But better to be lost in Charles his name, (Like some unequal bride in nobler sheets) Receives her lord; the joyful London meets The princely York, himself alone a freight; The Swiftsure groans beneath great Gloster's weight: Secure as when the halcyon breeds, with these, He, that was born to drown, might cross the seas. Heaven could not own a Providence, and take The wealth three nations ventured at a stake. The same indulgence Charles his voyage blessed, Which in his right had miracles confessed. The winds, that never moderation knew, Afraid to blow too much, too faintly blew; Or, out of breath with joy, could not enlarge Their straightened lungs, or conscious of their charge. The British Amphitrite, smooth and clear, In richer azure never did appear; Proud her returning prince to entertain With the submitted fasces of the main. And welcome now, great monarch, to your own! Behold the approaching cliffs of Albion. It is no longer motion cheats your view; As you meet it, the land approacheth you. The land returns, and, in the white it wears, The marks of penitence and sorrow bears. But you, whose goodness your descent doth show, Your heavenly parentage and earthly too, By that same mildness, which your father's crown Before did ravish, shall secure your own. Not tied to rules of policy, you find Revenge less sweet than a forgiving mind. Thus, when the Almighty would to Moses give A sight of all he could behold and live; A voice before his entry did proclaim, Long-suffering, goodness, mercy, in his name. Your power to justice doth submit your cause, Your goodness only is above the laws; Whose rigid letter, while pronounced by you, Is softer made. So winds, that tempests brew, When through Arabian groves they take their flight, Made wanton with rich odours, lose their spite. And as those lees, that trouble it, refine The agitated soul of generous wine; So tears of joy, for your returning spilt, Work out, and expiate our former guilt. Methinks I see those crowds on Dover's strand, Who, in their haste to welcome you to land, Choked up the beach with their still growing store, And made a wilder torrent on the shore: While, spurred with eager thoughts of past delight, Those, who had seen you, court a second sight; Preventing still your steps, and making haste To meet you often whersoe'er you past. How shall I speak of that triumphant day, When you renewed the expiring pomp of May! A month that owns an interest in your name: You and the flowers are its peculiar claim. That star, that at your birth shone out so bright, It stained the duller sun's meridian light, Did once again its potent fires renew, Guiding our eyes to find and worship you. And now Time's whiter series is begun, Which in soft centuries shall smoothly run: Those clouds, that overcast your morn, shall fly, Dispelled, to farthest corners of the sky. Our nation, with united interest blest, Not now content to poise, shall sway the rest. Abroad your empire shall no limits know, But, like the sea, in boundless circles flow; Your much-loved fleet shall, with a wide command, Besiege the petty monarchs of the land; And, as old Time his offspring swallowed down, Our ocean in its depths all seas shall drown. Their wealthy trade from pirates' rapine free, Our merchants shall no more adventurers be; Nor in the farthest east those dangers fear, Which humble Holland must dissemble here. Spain to your gift alone her Indies owes; For, what the powerful takes not, he bestows: And France, that did an exile's presence fear, May justly apprehend you still too near. At home the hateful names of parties cease, And factious souls are wearied into peace. The discontented now are only they, Whose crimes before did your just cause betray; Of those your edicts some reclaim from sins, But most your life and blest example wins. Oh happy prince, whom heaven hath taught the way By paying vows to have more vows to pay! Oh happy age! Oh times like those alone, By fate reserved for great Augustus' throne! When the joint growth of arms and arts foreshew The world a monarch, and that monarch you. TO HIS SACRED MAJESTY, A PANEGYRIC ON HIS CORONATION. In that wild deluge where the world was drowned, When life and sin one common tomb had found, The first small prospect of a rising hill With various notes of joy the ark did fill: Yet when that flood in its own depths was drowned, It left behind it false and slippery ground; And the more solemn pomp was still deferred, Till new-born Nature in fresh looks appeared. Thus, Royal Sir, to see you landed here, Was cause enough of triumph for a year: Nor would your care those glorious joys repeat, Till they at once might be secure and great; Till your kind beams, by their continued stay, Had warmed the ground, and called the damps away. Such vapours, while your powerful influence dries, Then soonest vanish when they highest rise. Had greater haste these sacred rites prepared, Some guilty months had in your triumphs shared; But this untainted year is all your own, Your glories may without our crimes be shown, We had not yet exhausted all our store, When you refreshed our joys by adding more: As heaven, of old, dispensed celestial dew, You gave us manna, and still gave us new. Now our sad ruins are removed from sight, The season too comes fraught with new delight: Time seems not now beneath his years to stoop, Nor do his wings with sickly feathers droop: Soft western winds waft o'er the gaudy spring, And opened scenes of flowers and blossoms bring, To grace this happy day, while you appear, Not king of us alone, but of the year. All eyes you draw, and with the eyes the heart; Of your own pomp yourself the greatest part: Loud shouts the nation's happiness proclaim, And heaven this day is feasted with your name. Your cavalcade the fair spectators view, From their high standings, yet look up to you. From your brave train each singles out a prey, And longs to date a conquest from your day. Now charged with blessings while you seek repose, Officious slumbers haste your eyes to close; And glorious dreams stand ready to restore The pleasing shapes of all you saw before. Next to the sacred temple you are led, Where waits a crown for your more sacred head. How justly from the church that crown is due, Preserved from ruin, and restored by you! The grateful quire their harmony employ, Not to make greater, but more solemn joy. Wrapt soft and warm your name is sent on high, As flames do on the wing of incense fly. Music herself is lost; in vain she brings Her choicest notes to praise the best of kings: Her melting strains in you a tomb have found, And lie like bees in their own sweetness drowned. He, that brought peace, and discord could atone, His name is music of itself alone. Now while the sacred oil anoints your head, And fragrant scents, begun from you, are spread Through the large dome, the people's joyful sound, Sent back, is still preserved in hallowed ground; Which in one blessing mixed descends on you, As heightened spirits fall in richer dew. Not that our wishes do increase your store; Full of yourself you can admit no more. We add not to your glory, but employ Our time, like angels, in expressing joy. Nor is it duty, or our hopes alone, Create that joy, but full fruition: We know those blessings, which we must possess, And judge of future by past happiness. No promise can oblige a prince so much Still to be good, as long to have been such. A noble emulation heats your breast, And your own fame now robs you of your rest. Good actions still must be maintained with good, As bodies nourished with resembling food. You have already quenched sedition's brand; And zeal, which burnt it, only warms the land. The jealous sects, that dare not trust their cause So far from their own will as to the laws, You for their umpire and their synod take, And their appeal alone to Cæsar make. Kind heaven so rare a temper did provide, That guilt repenting might in it confide. Among our crimes oblivion may be set; But 'tis our king's perfection to forget. Virtues unknown to these rough northern climes, From milder heavens you bring, without their crimes. Your calmness does no after-storms provide, Nor seeming patience mortal anger hide. When empire first from families did spring, Then every father governed as a king; But you, that are a sovereign prince, allay Imperial power with your paternal sway. From those great cares when ease your soul unbends, Your pleasures are designed to noble ends; Born to command the mistress of the seas, Your thoughts themselves in that blue empire please. Hither in summer evenings you repair, To taste the fraischeur of the purer air: Undaunted here you ride, when winter raves, With Cæsar's heart that rose above the waves. More I could sing, but fear my numbers stays; No loyal subject dares that courage praise. In stately frigates most delight you find, Where well-drawn battles fire your martial mind. What to your cares we owe, is learnt from hence, When even your pleasures serve for our defence. Beyond your court flows in the admitted tide, Where in new depths the wondering fishes glide: Here in a royal bed the waters sleep; When tired at sea, within this bay they creep. Here the mistrustful fowl no harm suspects, So safe are all things which our king protects. From your loved Thames a blessing yet is due, Second alone to that it brought in you; A queen, near whose chaste womb, ordained by fate, The souls of kings unborn for bodies wait. It was your love before made discord cease: Your love is destined to your country's peace. Both Indies, rivals in your bed, provide With gold or jewels to adorn your bride; This to a mighty king presents rich ore, While that with incense does a god implore. Two kingdoms wait your doom; and, as you choose, This must receive a crown, or that must lose. Thus from your Royal Oak, like Jove's of old, Are answers sought and destinies foretold: Propitious oracles are begged with vows, And crowns that grow upon the sacred boughs. Your subjects, while you weigh the nations' fate, Suspend to both their doubtful love or hate. Choose only, sir, that so they may possess With their own peace their children's happiness. TO THE LORD CHANCELLOR HYDE. PRESENTED ON NEW-YEAR'S DAY, 1662. My Lord, While flattering crowds officiously appear To give themselves, not you, an happy year, And by the greatness of their presents prove How much they hope, but not how well they love,— The muses, who your early courtship boast, Though now your flames are with their beauty lost, Yet watch their time, that, if you have forgot They were your mistresses, the world may not. Decayed by time and wars, they only prove Their former beauty by your former love; And now present, as ancient ladies do, That courted long, at length are forced to woo: For still they look on you with such kind eyes, As those, that see the Church's sovereign rise, From their own order chose, in whose high state They think themselves the second choice of fate. When our great monarch into exile went, Wit and religion suffered banishment. Thus once, when Troy was wrapped in fire and smoke, The helpless gods their burning shrines forsook; They with the vanquished prince and party go, And leave their temples empty to the foe. At length the Muses stand, restored again To that great charge which nature did ordain; And their loved druids seem revived by fate, While you dispense the laws, and guide the state. The nation's soul, our monarch, does dispense, Through you, to us his vital influence: You are the channel, where those spirits flow, And work them higher as to us they go. In open prospect nothing bounds our eye, Until the earth seems joined unto the sky: So in this hemisphere, our utmost view Is only bounded by our king and you; Our sight is limited where you are joined, And beyond that no farther heaven can find. So well your virtues do with his agree, That though your orbs of different greatness be, Yet both are for each other's use disposed, His to inclose, and yours to be inclosed: Nor could another in your room have been, Except an emptiness had come between. Well may he, then, to you his cares impart, And share his burden where he shares his heart. In you his sleep still wakes; his pleasures find Their share of business in your labouring mind. So, when the weary sun his place resigns, He leaves his light, and by reflection shines. Justice, that sits and frowns where public laws Exclude soft mercy from a private cause, In your tribunal most herself does please; There only smiles because she lives at ease; And, like young David, finds her strength the more, When disencumbered from those arms she wore. Heaven would your royal master should exceed Most in that virtue, which we most did need; And his mild father (who too late did find All mercy vain but what with power was joined) His fatal goodness left to fitter times, Not to increase, but to absolve our crimes: But when the heir of this vast treasure knew How large a legacy was left to you, (Too great for any subject to retain) He wisely tied it to the crown again; Yet, passing through your hands it gathers more, As streams, through mines, bear tincture of their ore. While emp'ric politicians use deceit, Hide what they give, and cure but by a cheat; You boldly show that skill which they pretend, And work by means as noble as your end; Which should you veil, we might unwind the clue, As men do nature, till we came to you. And, as the Indies were not found before Those rich perfumes, which, from the happy shore, The winds upon their balmy wings conveyed, Whose guilty sweetness first their world betrayed; So, by your counsels, we are brought to view A rich and undiscovered world in you. By you our monarch does that fame assure, Which kings must have, or cannot live secure: For prosperous princes gain their subjects' heart, Who love that praise in which themselves have part. By you he fits those subjects to obey, As heaven's eternal monarch does convey His power unseen, and man, to his designs, By his bright ministers, the stars, inclines. Our setting sun, from his declining seat, Shot beams of kindness on you, not of heat; And, when his love was bounded in a few That were unhappy, that they might be true, Made you the favourite of his last sad times, That is, a sufferer in his subjects' crimes. Thus, those first favours you received, were sent, Like heaven's rewards, in earthly punishment: Yet fortune, conscious of your destiny, E'en then took care to lay you softly by, And wrapped your fate among her precious things, Kept fresh to be unfolded with your king's. Shown all at once, you dazzled so our eyes, As new-born Pallas did the gods surprise, When, springing forth from Jove's new-closing wound, She struck the warlike spear into the ground; Which sprouting leaves did suddenly inclose, And peaceful olives shaded as they rose. How strangely active are the arts of peace, Whose restless motions less than war's do cease! Peace is not freed from labour, but from noise; And war more force, but not more pains employs. Such is the mighty swiftness of your mind, That, like the earth, it leaves our sense behind, While you so smoothly turn and roll our sphere, That rapid motion does but rest appear. For, as in nature's swiftness, with the throng Of flying orbs while ours is borne along, All seems at rest to the deluded eye, Moved by the soul of the same harmony; So, carried on by your unwearied care, We rest in peace, and yet in motion share. Let envy, then, those crimes within you see, From which the happy never must be free; (Envy, that does with misery reside, The joy and the revenge of ruined pride.) Think it not hard, if, at so cheap a rate, You can secure the constancy of fate, Whose kindness sent what does their malice seem, By lesser ills the greater to redeem; Nor can we this weak shower a tempest call, But drops of heat that in the sunshine fall. You have already wearied Fortune so, She cannot farther be your friend or foe; But sits all breathless, and admires to feel A fate so weighty, that it stops her wheel. In all things else above our humble fate, Your equal mind yet swells not into state, But, like some mountain in those happy isles, Where in perpetual spring young nature smiles, Your greatness shows; no horror to affright, But trees for shade, and flowers to court the sight: Sometimes the hill submits itself a while In small descents, which do its height beguile; And sometimes mounts, but so as billows play, Whose rise not hinders, but makes short our way. Your brow, which does no fear of thunder know, Sees rolling tempests vainly beat below; And, like Olympus' top, the impression wears Of love and friendship writ in former years. Yet unimpaired with labours, or with time, Your age but seems to a new youth to climb. Thus heavenly bodies do our time beget, And measure change, but share no part of it. And still it shall without a weight increase, Like this new-year, whose motions never cease: For, since the glorious course you have begun Is led by Charles, as that is by the sun, It must both weightless and immortal prove, Because the centre of it is above. SATIRE ON THE DUTCH. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1662. As needy gallants, in the scrivener's hands, Court the rich knaves that gripe their mortgaged lands; The first fat buck of all the season's sent, And keeper takes no fee in compliment; The dotage of some Englishmen is such, To fawn on those who ruin them,—the Dutch. They shall have all, rather than make a war With those who of the same religion are. The Straits, the Guinea trade, the herrings too; Nay, to keep friendship, they shall pickle you. Some are resolved not to find out the cheat, But, cuckold-like, love them that do the feat. What injuries soe'er upon us fall, Yet still the same religion answers all:— Religion wheedled us to civil war, Drew English blood, and Dutchmen's now would spare. Be gulled no longer, for you'll find it true, They have no more religion, faith! than you. Interest's the god they worship in their state; And we, I take it, have not much of that. Well monarchies may own religion's name; But states are atheists in their very frame. They share a sin; and such proportions fall, That, like a stink, 'tis nothing to them all. Think on their rapine, falsehood, cruelty, And that, what once they were they still would be. To one well-born the affront is worse and more, When he's abused and baffled by a boor, With an ill grace the Dutch their mischiefs do; They've both ill nature and ill manners too. Well may they boast themselves an ancient nation; For they were bred ere manners were in fashion: And their new commonwealth hath set them free Only from honour and civility. Venetians do not more uncouthly ride, Than did their lubber state mankind bestride; Their sway became them with as ill a mein, As their own paunches swell above their chin. Yet is their empire no true growth, but humour, And only two kings' touch can cure the tumour. As Cato fruits of Afric did display, Let us before our eyes their Indies lay: All loyal English will like him conclude,— Let Cæsar live, and Carthage be subdued. VERSES TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUCHESS, ON THE MEMORABLE VICTORY GAINED BY THE DUKE AGAINST THE HOLLANDERS, JUNE THE 3, 1665, AND ON HER JOURNEY AFTERWARDS INTO THE NORTH. Madam, When, for our sakes, your hero you resigned To swelling seas, and every faithless wind; When you released his courage, and set free A valour fatal to the enemy; You lodged your country's cares within your breast, (The mansion where soft love should only rest,) And, ere our foes abroad were overcome, The noblest conquest you had gained at home. Ah, what concerns did both your souls divide! Your honour gave us what your love denied; And 'twas for him much easier to subdue Those foes he fought with, than to part from you. That glorious day, which two such navies saw, As each unmatched might to the world give law, Neptune, yet doubtful whom he should obey, Held to them both the trident of the sea: The winds were hushed, the waves in ranks were cast, As awfully as when God's people past: Those, yet uncertain on whose sails to blow, These, where the wealth of nations ought to flow. Then with the Duke your Highness ruled the day: While all the brave did his command obey, The fair and pious under you did pray. How powerful are chaste vows! the wind and tide You bribed to combat on the English side. Thus to your much-loved lord you did convey An unknown succour, sent the nearest way. New vigour to his wearied arms you brought, (So Moses was upheld while Israel fought) While, from afar, we heard the cannon play, Like distant thunder on a shiny day. For absent friends we were ashamed to fear, When we considered what you ventured there. Ships, men, and arms, our country might restore, But such a leader could supply no more. With generous thoughts of conquest he did burn, Yet fought not more to vanquish than return. Fortune and victory he did pursue, To bring them, as his slaves, to wait on you: Thus beauty ravished the rewards of fame, And the fair triumphed, when the brave o'ercame. Then, as you meant to spread another way By land your conquests, far as his by sea, Leaving our southern clime, you marched along The stubborn north ten thousand Cupids strong. Like commons the nobility resort, In crowding heaps, to fill your moving court: To welcome your approach the vulgar run, Like some new envoy from the distant sun; And country beauties by their lovers go, Blessing themselves, and wondering at the show. So, when the new-born Phœnix first is seen, Her feathered subjects all adore their queen, And, while she makes her progress through the east, From every grove her numerous train's increased: Each poet of the air her glory sings, And round him the pleased audience clap their wings. ANNUS MIRABILIS, THE YEAR OF WONDERS, 1666. TO THE METROPOLIS OF GREAT BRITAIN, THE MOST RENOWNED AND LATE FLOURISHING CITY OF LONDON, IN ITS REPRESENTATIVES, THE LORD MAYOR AND COURT OF ALDERMEN, THE SHERIFFS, AND COMMON COUNCIL OF IT. I In thriving arts long time had Holland grown, Crouching at home and cruel when abroad; Scarce leaving us the means to claim our own; Our king they courted, and our merchants awed. II Trade, which like blood should circularly flow, Stopped in their channels, found its freedom lost; Thither the wealth of all the world did go, And seemed but shipwracked on so base a coast. III For them alone the heavens had kindly heat, In eastern quarries ripening precious dew; Precious stones at first are dew, condensed and hardened by the warmth of the sun, or subterranean fires. For them the Idumæan balm did sweat, And in hot Ceylon spicy forests grew. IV The sun but seemed the labourer of their year; Each wexing moon supplied her watery store, According to their opinion who think, that great heap of waters under the Line is depressed into tides by the moon towards the poles. To swell those tides, which from the Line did bear Their brim-full vessels to the Belgian shore. V Thus, mighty in her ships, stood Carthage long, And swept the riches of the world from far; Yet stooped to Rome, less wealthy, but more strong: And this may prove our second Punic war. VI What peace can be, where both to one pretend? (But they more diligent, and we more strong), Or if a peace, it soon must have an end; For they would grow too powerful, were it long. VII Behold two nations then, engaged so far, That each seven years the fit must shake each land; Where France will side to weaken us by war, Who only can his vast designs withstand. VIII See how he feeds the Iberian with delays, To render us his timely friendship vain; And while his secret soul on Flanders preys, He rocks the cradle of the babe of Spain. IX Such deep designs of empire does he lay O'er them, whose cause he seems to take in hand; And prudently would make them lords at sea, To whom with ease he can give laws by land. X This saw our king: and long within his breast His pensive counsels balanced to and fro; He grieved the land he freed should be oppressed, And he less for it than usurpers do. XI His generous mind the fair ideas drew Of fame and honour, which in dangers lay; Where wealth, like fruit on precipices, grew, Not to be gathered but by birds of prey. XII The loss and gain each fatally were great; And still his subjects called aloud for war: But peaceful kings, o'er martial people set, Each other's poise and counterbalance are. XIII He first surveyed the charge with careful eyes, Which none but mighty monarchs could maintain; Yet judged, like vapours that from limbecks rise, It would in richer showers descend again. XIV At length resolved to assert the watery ball, He in himself did whole Armados bring; Him aged seamen might their master call, And choose for general, were he not their king. XV It seems as every ship their sovereign knows, His awful summons they so soon obey;— So hear the scaly herd when Proteus blows, And so to pasture follow through the sea. Cœruleus Proteus immania ponti Armenta, et magnas pascit sub gurgite phocas. XVI To see this fleet upon the ocean move, Angels drew wide the curtains of the skies; And heaven, as if there wanted lights above, For tapers made two glaring comets rise. XVII Whether they unctuous exhalations are, Fired by the sun, or seeming so alone; Or each some more remote and slippery star, Which loses footing when to mortals shown; XVIII Or one, that bright companion of the sun, Whose glorious aspect sealed our new-born king; And now, a round of greater years begun, New influence from his walks of light did bring. XIX Victorious York did first, with famed success, To his known valour make the Dutch give place; Thus heaven our monarch's fortune did confess, Beginning conquest from his royal race. XX But since it was decreed, auspicious king, In Britain's right that thou shouldst wed the main, Heaven, as a gage, would cast some precious thing, And therefore doomed that Lawson should be slain. XXI Lawson amongst the foremost met his fate, Whom sea-green sirens from the rocks lament Thus, as an offering for the Grecian state, He first was killed, who first to battle went. XXII Their chief blown up, in air, not waves, expired, To which his pride presumed to give the law; The admiral of Holland. The Dutch confessed heaven present, and retired, And all was Britain the wide ocean saw. XXIII To nearest ports their shattered ships repair, Where by our dreadful cannon they lay awed; So reverently men quit the open air, Where thunder speaks the angry gods abroad. XXIV And now approached their fleet from India, fraught The attempt at Bergen. With all the riches of the rising sun; And precious sand from southern climates brought, The fatal regions where the war begun. Southern climates—Guinea. XXV Like hunted castors, conscious of their store, Their waylaid wealth to Norway's coast they bring; There first the North's cold bosom spices bore, And winter brooded on the eastern spring. XXVI By the rich scent we found our perfumed prey, Which, flanked with rocks, did close in covert lie; And round about their murdering cannon lay, At once to threaten and invite the eye. XXVII Fiercer than cannon, and than rocks more hard, The English undertake the unequal war; Seven ships alone, by which the port is barred, Besiege the Indies, and all Denmark dare. XXVIII These fight like husbands, but like lovers those; These fain would keep, and those more fain enjoy; And to such height their frantic passion grows, That what both love, both hazard to destroy. XXIX Amidst whole heaps of spices lights a ball, And now their odours armed against them fly; Some preciously by shattered porcelain fall, And some by aromatic splinters die. XXX And though by tempests of the prize bereft, In heaven's inclemency some ease we find; Our foes we vanquished by our valour left, And only yielded to the seas and wind. XXXI Nor wholly lost we so deserved a prey; For storms, repenting, part of it restored; Which as a tribute from the Baltic sea, The British ocean sent her mighty lord. XXXII Go, mortals, now, and vex yourselves in vain For wealth, which so uncertainly must come; When what was brought so far, and with such pain, Was only kept to lose it nearer home. XXXIII The son, who twice three months on th'ocean tost, Prepared to tell what he had passed before, Now sees in English ships the Holland coast, And parents' arms, in vain, stretched from the shore. XXXIV This careful husband had been long away, Whom his chaste wife and little children mourn; Who on their fingers learned to tell the day, On which their father promised to return. XXXV Such are the proud designs of humankind, And so we suffer shipwreck everywhere! From Petronius: “Si bene calculum ponas, ubique fit naufragium.” Alas, what port can such a pilot find, Who in the night of fate must blindly steer! XXXVI The undistinguished seeds of good and ill, Heaven in his bosom from our knowledge hides; And draws them in contempt of human skill, Which oft, for friends mistaken, foes provides. XXXVII Let Munster's prelate ever be accurst, In whom we seek the German faith in vain; Tacitus saith of them, “Nullos mortalium fide aut armis ante Germanos esse.” Alas, that he should teach the English first, That fraud and avarice in the church could reign! XXXVIII Happy, who never trust a stranger's will, Whose friendship's in his interest understood; Since money given but tempts him to be ill, When power is too remote to make him good. XXXIX War declared by France.Till now, alone the mighty nations strove; The rest, at gaze, without the lists did stand; And threatening France, placed by a painted Jove, Kept idle thunder in his lifted hand. XL That eunuch guardian of rich Holland's trade, Who envies us what he wants power to enjoy; Whose noiseful valour does no foe invade, And weak assistance will his friends destroy. XLI Offended that we fought without his leave, He takes this time his secret hate to show; Which Charles does with a mind so calm receive, As one that neither seeks nor shuns his foe. XLII With France, to aid the Dutch, the Danes unite; France as their tyrant, Denmark as their slave. But when with one three nations join to fight, They silently confess that one more brave. XLIII Louis had chased the English from his shore, But Charles the French as subjects does invite; Would heaven for each some Solomon restore, Who, by their mercy, may decide their right. XLIV Were subjects so but only by their choice, And not from birth did forced dominion take, Our prince alone would have the public voice, And all his neighbours' realms would deserts make. XLV He without fear a dangerous war pursues, Which without rashness he began before; As honour made him first the danger choose, So still he makes it good on virtue's score. XLVI The doubled charge his subjects' love supplies, Who in that bounty to themselves are kind: So glad Egyptians see their Nilus rise, And in his plenty their abundance find. XLVII Prince Rupert and Duke Albemarle sent to sea.With equal power he does two chiefs create, Two such as each seemed worthiest when alone; Each able to sustain a nation's fate, Since both have found a greater in their own. XLVIII Both great in courage, conduct, and in fame, Yet neither envious of the other's praise; Their duty, faith, and interest too the same, Like mighty partners equally they raise. XLIX The Prince long time had courted fortune's love, But once possessed did absolutely reign; Thus with their Amazons the heroes strove, And conquered first those beauties they would gain. L The Duke beheld, like Scipio, with disdain, That Carthage, which he ruined, rise once more; And shook aloft the fasces of the main, To fright those slaves with what they felt before. LI Together to the watery camp they haste, Whom matrons passing to their children show; Infants' first vows for them to heaven are cast, And future people bless them as they go. Examina infantium, futurusque populus. Plin. jun. in Pan. ad Trajanum. LII With them no riotous pomp, nor Asian train, To infect a navy with their gaudy fears; To make slow fights, and victories but vain; But war severely, like itself, appears. LIII Diffusive of themselves, where'er they pass, They make that warmth in others they expect; Their valour works like bodies on a glass, And does its image on their men project. LIV Duke of Albemarle's battle, first day.Our fleet divides, and straight the Dutch appear, In number, and a famed commander, bold; The narrow seas can scarce their navy bear, Or crowded vessels can their soldiers hold. LV The Duke, less numerous, but in courage more, On wings of all the winds to combat flies; His murdering guns a loud defiance roar, And bloody crosses on his flag-staffs rise. LVI Both furl their sails, and strip them for the fight; Their folded sheets dismiss the useless air; The Elean plains could boast no nobler sight, Where the Olympic games were celebrated. When struggling champions did their bodies bare. LVII Borne each by other in a distant line, The sea-built forts in dreadful order move; So vast the noise, as if not fleets did join, But lands unfixed, and floating nations strove. From Virgil: Credas innare revulsas Cycladas. LVIII Now passed, on either side they nimbly tack; Both strive to intercept and guide the wind; And, in its eye, more closely they come back, To finish all the deaths they left behind. LIX On high-raised decks the haughty Belgians ride, Beneath whose shade our humble frigates go; Such port the elephant bears, and so defied By the rhinoceros, her unequal foe. LX And as the built, so different is the fight, Their mounting shot is on our sails designed; Deep in their hulls our deadly bullets light, And through the yielding planks a passage find. LXI Our dreaded admiral from far they threat, Whose battered rigging their whole war receives; All bare, like some old oak which tempests beat, He stands, and sees below his scattered leaves. LXII Heroes of old, when wounded, shelter sought; But he, who meets all danger with disdain, Even in their face his ship to anchor brought, And steeple-high stood propt upon the main. LXIII At this excess of courage, all amazed, The foremost of his foes a while withdraw; With such respect in entered Rome they gazed, Who on high chairs the godlike Fathers saw. LXIV And now, as where Patroclus' body lay, Here Trojan chiefs advanced, and there the Greek; Ours o'er the Duke their pious wings display, And theirs the noblest spoils of Britain seek. LXV Meantime his busy mariners he hastes, His shattered sails with rigging to restore; And willing pines ascend his broken masts, Whose lofty heads rise higher than before. LXVI Straight to the Dutch he turns his dreadful prow, More fierce the important quarrel to decide; Like swans, in long array, his vessels show, Whose crests advancing do the waves divide. LXVII They charge, recharge, and all along the sea They drive, and squander the huge Belgian fleet; Berkley alone, who nearest danger lay, Did a like fate with lost Creusa meet. LXVIII The night comes on, we eager to pursue The combat still, and they ashamed to leave; Till the last streaks of dying day withdrew, And doubtful moonlight did our rage deceive. LXIX In the English fleet each ship resounds with joy, And loud applause of their great leader's fame; In fiery dreams the Dutch they still destroy, And, slumbering, smile at the imagined flame. LXX Not so the Holland fleet, who, tired and done, Stretched on their decks, like weary oxen, lie; Faint sweats all down their mighty members run, Vast bulks, which little souls but ill supply. LXXI In dreams they fearful precipices tread; Or, shipwrecked, labour to some distant shore; Or in dark churches walk among the dead; They wake with horror, and dare sleep no more. LXXII Second day's battle.The morn they look on with unwilling eyes, Till from their main-top joyful news they hear Of ships, which, by their mould, bring new supplies, And in their colours Belgian lions bear. LXXIII Our watchful general had discerned from far This mighty succour, which made glad the foe; He sighed, but, like a father of the war, His face spake hope, while deep his sorrows flow. Spem vultu simulat, premit alto corde dolorem. —Virgil. LXXIV His wounded men he first sends off to shore, Never, till now, unwilling to obey; They, not their wounds, but want of strength, deplore, And think them happy, who with him can stay. LXXV Then to the rest, “Rejoice,” said he, “to-day; In you the fortune of Great Britain lies; Among so brave a people, you are they, Whom heaven has chose to fight for such a prize. LXXVI “If number English courages could quell, We should at first have shunn'd, not met, our foes, Whose numerous sails the fearful only tell; Courage from hearts, and not from numbers grows.” LXXVII He said, nor needed more to say; with haste, To their known stations, cheerfully they go; And, all at once, disdaining to be last, Solicit every gale to meet the foe. LXXVIII Nor did the encouraged Belgians long delay, But, bold in others, not themselves, they stood; So thick, our navy scarce could sheer their way, But seemed to wander in a moving wood. LXXIX Our little fleet was now engaged so far, That, like the sword-fish in the whale they fought; The combat only seemed a civil war, Till through their bowels we our passage wrought. LXXX Never had valour, no, not ours before Done aught like this upon the land or main; Where not to be o'ercome was to do more Than all the conquests former kings did gain. LXXXI The mighty ghosts of our great Harrys rose, And armed Edwards looked with anxious eyes, To see this fleet among unequal foes, By which fate promised them their Charles should rise. LXXXII Meantime the Belgians tack upon our rear, And raking chase-guns through our sterns they send; Close by, their fire-ships, like jackals, appear, Who on their lions for the prey attend. LXXXIII Silent, in smoke of cannon, they come on; Such vapours once did fiery Cacus hide: In these, the height of pleased revenge is shown, Who burned contented by another's side. LXXXIV Sometimes from fighting squadrons of each fleet, Deceived themselves, or to preserve some friend, Two grappling Ætnas on the ocean meet, And English fires with Belgian flames contend. LXXXV Now, at each tack, our little fleet grows less; And, like maimed fowl, swim lagging on the main. Their greater loss their numbers scarce confess, While they lose cheaper than the English gain. LXXXVI Have you not seen, when whistled from the fist, Some falcon stoops at what her eye designed, And with her eagerness the quarry missed, Straight flies at check, and clips it down the wind? LXXXVII The dastard crow, that to the wood made wing, And sees the groves no shelter can afford, With her loud caws her craven kind does bring, Who, safe in numbers, cuff the noble bird. LXXXVIII Among the Dutch thus Albemarle did fare: He could not conquer, and disdained to fly; Past hope of safety, 'twas his latest care, Like falling Cæsar, decently to die. LXXXIX Yet pity did his manly spirit move, To see those perish who so well had fought; And generously with his despair he strove, Resolved to live till he their safety wrought. XC Let other muses write his prosperous fate, Of conquered nations tell, and kings restored; But mine shall sing of his eclipsed estate, Which, like the sun's, more wonders does afford. XCI He drew his mighty frigates all before, On which the foe his fruitless force employs; His weak ones deep into his rear he bore, Remote from guns, as sick men from the noise. XCII His fiery cannon did their passage guide, And following smoke obscured them from the foe: Thus Israel, safe from the Egyptian's pride, By flaming pillars, and by clouds did go. XCIII Elsewhere the Belgian force we did defeat, But here our courages did theirs subdue; So Xenophon once led that famed retreat, Which first the Asian empire overthrew. XCIV The foe approached; and one for his bold sin Was sunk, as he that touched the ark was slain: The wild waves mastered him, and sucked him in, And smiling eddies dimpled on the main. XCV This seen, the rest at awful distance stood; As if they had been there as servants set, To stay, or to go on, as he thought good, And not pursue, but wait on his retreat. XCVI So Libyan huntsmen on some sandy plain, From shady coverts roused, the lion chase; The kingly beast roars out with loud disdain, And slowly moves, unknowing to give place. The simile is Virgil's: “Vestigia retro improperata refert.” XCVII But if some one approach to dare his force, He swings his tail, and swiftly turns him round; With one paw seizes on his trembling horse, And with the other tears him to the ground. XCVIII Amidst these toils succeeds the balmy night; Now hissing waters the quenched guns restore; And weary waves, withdrawing from the fight, Lie lulled and panting on the silent shore. From Statius, Sylv.— “Nec trucibus fluviis idem sonus: occidit horror Equoris, antennis maria acclinata quiescunt.” XCIX The moon shone clear on the becalmed flood, Where, while her beams like glittering silver play, Upon the deck our careful general stood, And deeply mused on the succeeding day. The third of June, famous for two former victories. C “That happy sun,” said he, “will rise again, Who twice victorious did our navy see; And I alone must view him rise in vain, Without one ray of all his star for me. CI “Yet, like an English general will I die, And all the ocean make my spacious grave: Women and cowards on the land may lie; The sea's a tomb that's proper for the brave.” CII Restless he passed the remnants of the night, Till the fresh air proclaimed the morning nigh; And burning ships, the martyrs of the fight, With paler fires beheld the eastern sky. CIII But now his stores of ammunition spent, Third day. His naked valour is his only guard; Rare thunders are from his dumb cannon sent, And solitary guns are scarcely heard. CIV Thus far had fortune power, here forced to stay, Nor longer durst with virtue be at strife; This as a ransom Albemarle did pay, For all the glories of so great a life. CV For now brave Rupert from afar appears, Whose waving streamers the glad general knows; With full-spread sails his eager navy steers, And every ship in swift proportion grows. CVI The anxious Prince had heard the cannon long, And, from that length of time, dire omens drew Of English overmatched, and Dutch too strong, Who never fought three days, but to pursue. CVII Then as an eagle, who with pious care Was beating widely on the wing for prey, To her now silent eyry does repair, And finds her callow infants forced away; CVIII Stung with her love, she stoops upon the plain, The broken air loud whistling as she flies; She stops and listens, and shoots forth again, And guides her pinions by her young ones' cries. CIX With such kind passion hastes the Prince to fight, And spreads his flying canvas to the sound; Him, whom no danger, were he there, could fright, Now absent, every little noise can wound. CX As in a drought the thirsty creatures cry, And gape upon the gathered clouds for rain; And first the martlet meets it in the sky, And with wet wings joys all the feathered train; CXI With such glad hearts did our despairing men Salute the appearance of the Prince's fleet; And each ambitiously would claim the ken, That with first eyes did distant safety meet. CXII The Dutch, who came like greedy hinds before, To reap the harvest their ripe ears did yield, Now look like those, when rolling thunders roar, And sheets of lightning blast the standing field. CXIII Full in the Prince's passage, hills of sand, And dangerous flats, in secret ambush lay; Where the false tides skim o'er the covered land, And seamen, with dissembled depths, betray. CXIV The wily Dutch, who, like fallen angels, feared This new Messiah's coming, there did wait, And round the verge their braving vessels steered, To tempt his courage with so fair a bait. CXV But he, unmoved, contemns their idle threat, Secure of fame whene'er he please to fight; His cold experience tempers all his heat, And inbred worth does boasting valour slight. CXVI Heroic virtue did his actions guide, And he the substance, not the appearance, chose; To rescue one such friend he took more pride, Than to destroy whole thousands of such foes. CXVII But when approached, in strict embraces bound, Rupert and Albemarle together grow; He joys to have his friend in safety found, Which he to none but to that friend would owe. CXVIII The cheerful soldiers, with new stores supplied, Now long to execute their spleenful will; And, in revenge for those three days they tried, Wish one, like Joshua's, when the sun stood still. CXIX Thus reinforced, against the adverse fleet, Fourth day's battle. Still doubling ours, brave Rupert leads the way; With the first blushes of the morn they meet, And bring night back upon the new-born day. CXX His presence soon blows up the kindling fight, And his loud guns speak thick like angry men; It seemed as slaughter had been breathed all night, And death new-pointed his dull dart again. CXXI The Dutch too well his mighty conduct knew, And matchless courage, since the former fight; Whose navy like a stiff-stretched cord did shew, Till he bore in, and bent them into flight. CXXII The wind he shares, while half their fleet offends His open side, and high above him shows; Upon the rest at pleasure he descends, And, doubly harmed, he double harms bestows. CXXIII Behind, the general mends his weary pace, And sullenly to his revenge he sails; So glides some trodden serpent on the grass, And long behind his wounded volume trails. From Virgil— “Quum medii nexus, extremæque agmina caudæ Solvuntur; tardosque trahit sinus ultimus orbes.” CXXIV The increasing sound is borne to either shore, And for their stakes the throwing nations fear; Their passions double with the cannons' roar, And with warm wishes each man combats there. CXXV Plied thick and close as when the fight begun, Their huge unwieldy navy wastes away: So sicken waning moons too near the sun, And blunt their crescents on the edge of day. CXXVI And now, reduced on equal terms to fight, Their ships like wasted patrimonies show; Where the thin scattering trees admit the light, And shun each other's shadows as they grow. CXXVII The warlike Prince had sever'd from the rest Two giant ships, the pride of all the main; Which with his one so vigorously he pressed, And flew so home, they could not rise again. CXXVIII Already battered, by his lee they lay; In vain upon the passing winds they call; The passing winds through their torn canvas play, And flagging sails on heartless sailors fall. CXXIX Their opened sides receive a gloomy light, Dreadful as day let into shades below; Without, grim death rides barefaced in their sight, And urges entering billows as they flow. CXXX When one dire shot, the last they could supply, Close by the board the Prince's main-mast bore: All three, now helpless, by each other lie, And this offends not, and those fear no more. CXXXI So have I seen some fearful hare maintain A course, till tired before the dog she lay; Who, stretched behind her, pants upon the plain, Past power to kill, as she to get away. CXXXII With his loll'd tongue he faintly licks his prey; His warm breath blows her flix up as she lies; She, trembling, creeps upon the ground away, And looks back to him with beseeching eyes. CXXXIII The Prince unjustly does his stars accuse, Which hindered him to push his fortune on; For what they to his courage did refuse, By mortal valour never must be done. CXXXIV This lucky hour the wise Batavian takes, And warns his tattered fleet to follow home; Proud to have so got off with equal stakes, Where 'twas a triumph not to be o'ercome. From Horace— ?“Quos opimus, Fallere et effugere est triumphus.” CXXXV The general's force, as kept alive by fight, Now not opposed, no longer can pursue; Lasting till heaven had done his courage right; When he had conquered, he his weakness knew. CXXXVI He casts a frown on the departing foe, And sighs to see him quit the watery field; His stern fixed eyes no satisfaction show, For all the glories which the fight did yield. CXXXVII Though, as when fiends did miracles avow, He stands confessed e'en by the boastful Dutch; He only does his conquest disavow, And thinks too little what they found too much. CXXXVIII Returned, he with the fleet resolved to stay; No tender thoughts of home his heart divide; Domestic joys and cares he puts away, For realms are households which the great must guide. CXXXIX As those, who unripe veins in mines explore, On the rich bed again the warm turf lay, Till time digests the yet imperfect ore, And know it will be gold another day; CXL So looks our monarch on this early fight, Th'essay and rudiments of great success; Which all-maturing time must bring to light, While he, like heaven, does each day's labour bless. CXLI Heaven ended not the first or second day, Yet each was perfect to the work designed: God and kings work, when they their work survey, And passive aptness in all subjects find. CXLII In burdened vessels first, with speedy care, His plenteous stores do season'd timber send; His Majesty repairs the fleet. Thither the brawny carpenters repair, And as the surgeons of maimed ships attend. CXLIII With cord and canvas from rich Hamburgh sent, His navy's moulted wings he imps once more; Tall Norway fir, their masts in battle spent, And English oak, sprung leaks and planks restore. CXLIV All hands employed, the royal work grows warm; Fervet opus; the same similitude in Virgil. Like labouring bees on a long summer's day, Some sound the trumpet for the rest to swarm, And some on bells of tasted lilies play. CXLV With gluey wax some new foundations lay, Of virgin-combs, which from the roof are hung; Some armed within doors, upon duty stay, Or tend the sick, or educate the young. CXLVI So here some pick out bullets from the sides, Some drive old oakum through each seam and rift; Their left hand does the caulking-iron guide, The rattling mallet with the right they lift. CXLVII With boiling pitch another near at hand, From friendly Sweden brought, the seams instops; Which well paid o'er, the salt sea waves withstand, And shakes them from the rising beak in drops. CXLVIII Some the galled ropes with dauby marline bind, Or searcloth masts with strong tarpauling coats; To try new shrouds, one mounts into the wind, And one below their ease or stiffness notes. CXLIX Our careful monarch stands in person by, His new-cast cannon's firmness to explore; The strength of big-corn'd powder loves to try, And ball and cartridge sorts for every bore. CL Each day brings fresh supplies of arms and men, And ships which all last winter were abroad; And such as fitted since the fight had been, Or new from stocks, were fallen into the road. CLI The goodly “London,” in her gallant trim, “Loyal London” described. The phœnix-daughter of the vanished old, Like a rich bride does to the ocean swim, And on her shadow rides in floating gold. CLII Her flag aloft, spread ruffling to the wind, And sanguine streamers, seem the flood to fire; The weaver, charmed with what his loom designed, Goes on to sea, and knows not to retire. CLIII With roomy decks, her guns of mighty strength, Whose low-laid mouths each mounting billow laves; Deep in her draught, and warlike in her length, She seems a sea-wasp flying on the waves. CLIV This martial present, piously designed, The loyal city gave their best-loved king; And, with a bounty ample as the wind, Built, fitted, and maintained, to aid him bring. CLV By viewing nature, nature's handmaid, art, Digression concerning shipping and navigation. Makes mighty things from small beginnings grow: Thus fishes first to shipping did impart, Their tail the rudder, and their head the prow. CLVI Some log, perhaps, upon the waters swam, An useless drift, which, rudely cut within, And hollow'd, first a floating trough became, And cross some rivulet passage did begin. CLVII In shipping such as this, the Irish kern, And untaught Indian, on the stream did glide; Ere sharp-keel'd boats to stem the flood did learn, Or fin-like oars did spread from either side. CLVIII Add but a sail, and Saturn so appeared, When from lost empire he to exile went, And with the golden age to Tiber steer'd, Where coin and first commerce he did invent. CLIX Rude as their ships was navigation then; No useful compass or meridian known; Coasting, they kept the land within their ken, And knew no north but when the Pole-star shone. CLX Of all, who since have used the open sea, Than the bold English none more fame have won; Beyond the year, and out of heaven's high way, Extra anni solisque vias. —Virgil. They make discoveries where they see no sun. CLXI But what so long in vain, and yet unknown, By poor mankind's benighted wit is sought, Shall in this age to Britain first be shown, And hence be to admiring nations taught. CLXII The ebbs of tides, and their mysterious flow, We, as art's elements, shall understand; And as by line upon the ocean go, Whose paths shall be familiar as the land. CLXIII Instructed ships shall sail to quick commerce, By which remotest regions are allied; Which makes one city of the universe, Where some may gain, and all may be supplied. CLXIV Then we upon our globe's last verge shall go, And view the ocean leaning on the sky: From thence our rolling neighbours we shall know, And on the lunar world securely pry. CLXV This I foretell from your auspicious care, Apostrophe to the Royal Society. Who great in search of God and nature grow; Who best your wise Creator's praise declare, Since best to praise His works is best to know. CLXVI O truly royal! who behold the law, And rule of beings in your Maker's mind; And thence, like limbecs, rich ideas draw, To fit the levelled use of humankind. CLXVII But first the toils of war we must endure, And from the injurious Dutch redeem the seas; War makes the valiant of his right secure, And gives up fraud to be chastised with ease. CLXVIII Already were the Belgians on our coast, Whose fleet more mighty every day became By late success, which they did falsely boast, And now, by first appearing, seemed to claim. CLXIX Designing, subtile, diligent, and close, They knew to manage war with wise delay; Yet all those arts their vanity did cross, And by their pride their prudence did betray. CLXX Nor stayed the English long; but, well supplied, Appear as numerous as the insulting foe; The combat now by courage must be tried, And the success the braver nation show. CLXXI There was the Plymouth squadron new come in, Which in the Straits last winter was abroad; Which twice on Biscay's working bay had been, And on the midland sea the French had awed. CLXXII Old expert Allen, loyal all along, Famed for his action on the Smyrna fleet; And Holmes, whose name shall live in epic song, While music numbers, or while verse has feet. CLXXIII Holmes, the Achates of the general's fight, Who first bewitched our eyes with Guinea gold; As once old Cato, in the Roman sight, The tempting fruits of Afric did unfold. CLXXIV With him went Spragge, as bountiful as brave, Whom his high courage to command had brought; Harman, who did the twice-fired “Harry” save, And in his burning ship undaunted fought. CLXXV Young Hollis on a muse by Mars begot, Born, Cæsar-like, to write and act great deeds; Impatient to revenge his fatal shot, His right hand doubly to his left succeeds. CLXXVI Thousands were there in darker fame that dwell, Whose deeds some nobler poem shall adorn; And, though to me unknown, they sure fought well, Whom Rupert led, and who were British born. CLXXVII Of every size an hundred fighting sail; So vast the navy now at anchor rides, That underneath it the pressed waters fail, And with its weight it shoulders off the tides. CLXXVIII Now, anchors weighed, the seamen shout so shrill, That heaven and earth, and the wide ocean rings; A breeze from westward waits their sails to fill, And rests in those high beds his downy wings. CLXXIX The wary Dutch this gathering storm foresaw, And durst not bide it on the English coast; Behind their treacherous shallows they withdraw, And there lay snares to catch the British host. CLXXX So the false spider, when her nets are spread, Deep ambushed in her silent den does lie, And feels far off the trembling of her thread, Whose filmy cord should bind the struggling fly; CLXXXI Then, if at last she find him fast beset, She issues forth, and runs along her loom; She joys to touch the captive in her net, And drag the little wretch in triumph home. CLXXXII The Belgians hoped, that, with disordered haste, Our deep-cut keels upon the sands might run; Or, if with caution leisurely were past, Their numerous gross might charge us one by one. CLXXXIII But with a fore-wind pushing them above, And swelling tide that heaved them from below, O'er the blind flats our warlike squadrons move, And with spread sails to welcome battle go. CLXXXIV It seemed as there the British Neptune stood, With all his hosts of waters at command; Beneath them to submit the officious flood, And with his trident shoved them off the sand. Levat ipse tridenti, et vastas aperit syrtes. —Virgil. CLXXXV To the pale foes they suddenly draw near, And summon them to unexpected fight: They start like murderers when ghosts appear, And draw their curtains in the dead of night. CLXXXVI Now van to van the foremost squadrons meet, Second battle. The midmost battles hasting up behind; Who view far off the storm of falling sleet, And hear their thunder rattling in the wind. CLXXXVII At length the adverse admirals appear, The two bold champions of each country's right; Their eyes describe the lists as they come near, And draw the lines of death before they fight. CLXXXVIII The distance judged for shot of every size, The linstocks touch, the ponderous ball expires: The vigorous seamen every port-hole plies, And adds his heart to every gun he fires! CLXXXIX Fierce was the fight on the proud Belgians' side, For honour, which they seldom sought before; But now they by their own vain boasts were tied, And forced, at least in show, to prize it more. CXC But sharp remembrance on the English part, And shame of being matched by such a foe, Rouse conscious virtue up in every heart, And seeming to be stronger makes them so. Possunt quia posse videntur. —Virgil. CXCI Nor long the Belgians could that fleet sustain, Which did two generals' fates, and Cæsar's bear; Each several ship a victory did gain, As Rupert or as Albemarle were there. CXCII Their battered admiral too soon withdrew, Unthanked by ours for his unfinished fight; But he the minds of his Dutch masters knew, Who called that providence, which we called flight. CXCIII Never did men more joyfully obey, Or sooner understood the sign to fly; With such alacrity they bore away, As if, to praise them, all the States stood by. CXCIV O famous leader of the Belgian fleet, Thy monument inscribed such praise shall wear, As Varro, timely flying, once did meet, Because he did not of his Rome despair. CXCV Behold that navy, which, a while before, Provoked the tardy English close to fight; Now draw their beaten vessels close to shore, As larks lie dared, to shun the hobby's flight. CXCVI Whoe'er would English monuments survey, In other records may our courage know; But let them hide the story of this day, Whose fame was blemished by too base a foe. CXCVII Or if too busily they will inquire Into a victory, which we disdain; Then let them know, the Belgians did retire, Before the patron saint of injured Spain. St. James, on whose day this victory was gained. CXCVIII Repenting England this revengeful day To Philip's manes Philip II. of Spain, against whom the Hollanders rebelling were aided by Queen Elizabeth. did an offering bring; England, which first, by leading them astray, Hatched up rebellion to destroy her king. CXCIX Our fathers bent their baneful industry, To check a monarchy that slowly grew; But did not France or Holland's fate foresee, Whose rising power to swift dominion flew. CC In fortune's empire blindly thus we go, And wander after pathless destiny; Whose dark resorts since prudence cannot know, In vain it would provide for what shall be. CCI But whate'er English to the blessed shall go, And the fourth Harry or first Orange meet; Find him disowning of a Bourbon foe, And him detesting a Batavian fleet. CCII Now on their coasts our conquering navy rides, Waylays their merchants, and their land besets; Each day new wealth without their care provides; They lie asleep with prizes in their nets. CCIII So close behind some promontory lie The huge leviathans to attend their prey; And give no chase, but swallow in the fry, Which through their gaping jaws mistake the way. CCIV Burning of the fleet in the Vlie by Sir Robert Holmes.Nor was this all; in ports and roads remote, Destructive fires among whole fleets we send; Triumphant flames upon the water float, And outbound ships at home their voyage end. CCV Those various squadrons, variously designed, Each vessel freighted with a several load, Each squadron waiting for a several wind, All find but one,—to burn them in the road. CCVI Some bound for Guinea, golden sand to find, Bore all the gauds the simple natives wear; Some for the pride of Turkish courts designed, For folded turbans finest Holland bear. CCVII Some English wool vexed in a Belgian loom, And into cloth of spongy softness made, Did into France, or colder Denmark, doom, To ruin with worse ware our staple trade. CCVIII Our greedy seamen rummage every hold, Smile on the booty of each wealthier chest; And, as the priests who with their gods make bold, Take what they like, and sacrifice the rest. CCIX But ah! how unsincere are all our joys! Transition to the Fire of London. Which sent from heaven, like lightning, make no stay; Their palling taste the journey's length destroys, Or grief, sent post, o'ertakes them on the way. CCX Swelled with our late successes on the foe, Which France and Holland wanted power to cross, We urge an unseen fate to lay us low, And feed their envious eyes with English loss. CCXI Each element His dread command obeys, Who makes or ruins with a smile or frown; Who, as by one He did our nation raise, So now He with another pulls us down. CCXII Yet London, empress of the northern clime, By an high fate thou greatly didst expire; Great as the world's, which, at the death of time, Must fall, and rise a nobler frame by fire. Quum mare, quum tellus, correptaque regia cœli ardeat. CCXIII As when some dire usurper heaven provides, To scourge his country with a lawless sway; His birth, perhaps, some petty village hides, And sets his cradle out of fortune's way: CCXIV Till fully ripe his swelling fate breaks out, And hurries him to mighty mischiefs on; His prince, surprised at first, no ill could doubt, And wants the power to meet it when 'tis known: CCXV Such was the rise of this prodigious fire, Which in mean buildings first obscurely bred, From thence did soon to open streets aspire, And straight to palaces and temples spread. CCXVI The diligence of trades and noiseful gain, And luxury more late, asleep were laid; All was the night's; and, in her silent reign, No sound the rest of nature did invade. CCXVII In this deep quiet, from what source unknown, Those seeds of fire their fatal birth disclose; And, first, few scattering sparks about were blown, Big with the flames that to our ruin rose. CCXVIII Then in some close-pent room it crept along, And, smouldering as it went, in silence fed; Till th'infant monster, with devouring strong, Walked boldly upright with exalted head. CCXIX Now, like some rich or mighty murderer, Too great for prison, which he breaks with gold, Who fresher for new mischiefs does appear, And dares the world to tax him with the old: CCXX So scapes the insulting Fire his narrow jail, And makes small outlets into open air; There the fierce winds his tender force assail, And beat him downward to his first repair. CCXXI The winds, like crafty courtesans, withheld His flames from burning, but to blow them more; And, every fresh attempt, he is repelled With faint denials, weaker than before. Hæc arte tractabat cupidum virum, ut illius animum inopia accenderet. CCXXII And now, no longer letted of his prey, He leaps up at it with enraged desire; O'erlooks the neighbours with a wide survey, And nods at every house his threat'ning fire. CCXXIII The ghosts of traitors from the bridge descend, With bold fanatic spectres to rejoice; About the fire into a dance they bend, And sing their Sabbath notes with feeble voice. CCXXIV Our guardian angel saw them where they sate, Above the palace of our slumbering king; He sighed, abandoning his charge to fate, And, drooping, oft looked back upon the wing. CCXXV At length the crackling noise and dreadful blaze Called up some waking lover to the sight; And long it was ere he the rest could raise, Whose heavy eyelids yet were full of night. CCXXVI The next to danger, hot pursued by fate, Half-clothed, half-naked, hastily retire; And frighted mothers strike their breasts too late, For helpless infants left amidst the fire. CCXXVII Their cries soon waken all the dwellers near; Now murmuring noises rise in every street; The more remote run stumbling with their fear, And in the dark men jostle as they meet. CCXXVIII So weary bees in little cells repose; But if night-robbers lift the well-stored hive, An humming through their waxen city grows, And out upon each other's wings they drive. CCXXIX Now streets grow thronged, and busy as by day; Some run for buckets to the hallowed quire; Some cut the pipes, and some the engines play, And some, more bold, mount ladders to the fire. CCXXX In vain; for from the east a Belgian wind His hostile breath through the dry rafters sent; The flames, impelled, soon left their foes behind, And forward with a wanton fury went. CCXXXI A quay of fire ran all along the shore, And lightened all the river with a blaze; Sigæa igni freta lata relucent. —Virgil. The wakened tides began again to roar, And wondering fish in shining waters gaze. CCXXXII Old Father Thames raised up his reverend head, But feared the fate of Simois would return; Deep in his ooze he sought his sedgy bed, And shrunk his waters back into his urn. CCXXXIII The fire, meantime, walks in a broader gross; To either hand his wings he opens wide; He wades the streets, and straight he reaches cross, And plays his longing flames on the other side. CCXXXIV At first they warm, then scorch, and then they take; Now with long necks from side to side they feed; At length, grown strong, their mother-fire forsake, And a new colony of flames succeed. CCXXXV To every nobler portion of the town The curling billows roll their restless tide; In parties now they straggle up and down, As armies, unopposed, for prey divide. CCXXXVI One mighty squadron with a side-wind sped, Through narrow lanes his cumbered fire does haste; By powerful charms of gold and silver led, The Lombard bankers and the Change to waste. CCXXXVII Another backward to the Tower would go, And slowly eats his way against the wind; But the main body of the marching foe Against the imperial palace is designed. CCXXXVIII Now day appears, and with the day the King, Whose early care had robbed him of his rest; Far off the cracks of falling houses ring, And shrieks of subjects pierce his tender breast. CCXXXIX Near as he draws, thick harbingers of smoke, With gloomy pillars cover all the place; Whose little intervals of night are broke By sparks, that drive against his sacred face. CCXL More than his guards his sorrows made him known, And pious tears, which down his cheeks did shower; The wretched in his grief forgot their own, So much the pity of a king has power. CCXLI He wept the flames of what he loved so well, And what so well had merited his love; For never prince in grace did more excel, Or royal city more in duty strove. CCXLII Nor with an idle care did he behold; Subjects may grieve, but monarchs must redress; He cheers the fearful, and commends the bold, And makes despairers hope for good success. CCXLIII Himself directs what first is to be done, And orders all the succours which they bring; The helpful and the good about him run, And form an army worthy such a king. CCXLIV He sees the dire contagion spread so fast, That where it seizes all relief is vain; And therefore must unwillingly lay waste That country, which would else the foe maintain. CCXLV The powder blows up all before the fire; The amazed flames stand gathered on a heap; And from the precipice's brink retire, Afraid to venture on so large a leap. CCXLVI Thus fighting fires a while themselves consume, But straight, like Turks forced on to win or die, They first lay tender bridges of their fume, And o'er the breach in unctuous vapours fly. CCXLVII Part stay for passage, till a gust of wind Ships o'er their forces in a shining sheet; Part creeping under ground, their journey blind, And climbing from below their fellows meet. CCXLVIII Thus to some desert plain, or old wood-side, Dire night-hags come from far to dance their round; And o'er broad rivers on their fiends they ride, Or sweep in clouds above the blasted ground. CCXLIX No help avails; for, hydra-like, the fire Lifts up his hundred heads to aim his way; And scarce the wealthy can one half retire, Before he rushes in to share the prey. CCL The rich grow suppliant, and the poor grow proud; Those offer mighty gain, and these ask more; So void of pity is the ignoble crowd, When others' ruin may increase their store. CCLI As those who live by shores with joy behold Some wealthy vessel split or stranded nigh; And from the rocks leap down for shipwrecked gold, And seek the tempests which the others fly: CCLII So these but wait the owners' last despair, And what's permitted to the flames invade; E'en from their jaws they hungry morsels tear, And on their backs the spoils of Vulcan lade. CCLIII The days were all in this lost labour spent; And when the weary King gave place to night, His beams he to his royal brother lent, And so shone still in his reflective light. CCLIV Night came, but without darkness or repose, A dismal picture of the general doom; Where souls, distracted when the trumpet blows, And half unready, with their bodies come. CCLV Those who have homes, when home they do repair, To a last lodging call their wandering friends; Their short uneasy sleeps are broke with care, To look how near their own destruction tends. CCLVI Those who have none, sit round where once it was, And with full eyes each wonted room require; Haunting the yet warm ashes of the place, As murdered men walk where they did expire. CCLVII Some stir up coals and watch the vestal fire, Others in vain from sight of ruin run; And while through burning lab'rinths they retire, With loathing eyes repeat what they would shun. CCLVIII The most in fields, like herded beasts, lie down, To dews obnoxious on the grassy floor; And while their babes in sleep their sorrows drown, Sad parents watch the remnants of their store. CCLIX While by the motion of the flames they guess What streets are burning now, and what are near, An infant, waking, to the paps would press, And meets, instead of milk, a falling tear. CCLX No thought can ease them but their sovereign's care, Whose praise the afflicted as their comfort sing; E'en those, whom want might drive to just despair, Think life a blessing under such a king. CCLXI Meantime he sadly suffers in their grief, Outweeps an hermit, and outprays a saint; All the long night he studies their relief, How they may be supplied, and he may want. CCLXII King's Prayer.“O God,” said he, “thou patron of my days, Guide of my youth in exile and distress! Who me, unfriended, brought'st by wondrous ways, The kingdom of my fathers to possess: CCLXIII “Be thou my judge, with what unwearied care I since have laboured for my people's good; To bind the bruises of a civil war, And stop the issues of their wasting blood. CCLXIV “Thou who hast taught me to forgive the ill, And recompense, as friends, the good misled; If mercy be a precept of thy will, Return that mercy on thy servant's head. CCLXV “Or if my heedless youth has stepped astray, Too soon forgetful of thy gracious hand, On me alone thy just displeasure lay, But take thy judgments from this mourning land. CCLXVI “We all have sinned; and thou hast laid us low, As humble earth, from whence at first we came: Like flying shades before the clouds we show, And shrink like parchment in consuming flame. CCLXVII “O let it be enough what thou hast done; When spotted deaths ran arm'd through every street, With poisoned darts, which not the good could shun, The speedy could outfly, or valiant meet. CCLXVIII “The living few, and frequent funerals then, Proclaimed thy wrath on this forsaken place; And now those few, who are returned again, Thy searching judgments to their dwellings trace. CCLXIX “O pass not, Lord, an absolute decree, Or bind thy sentence unconditional; But in thy sentence our remorse foresee, And in that foresight this thy doom recall. CCLXX “Thy threat'nings, Lord, as thine, thou may'st revoke; But, if immutable and fixed they stand, Continue still thyself to give the stroke, And let not foreign foes oppress thy land.” CCLXXI The Eternal heard, and from the heavenly quire Chose out the cherub with the flaming sword; And bade him swiftly drive the approaching fire From where our naval magazines were stored. CCLXXII The blessed minister his wings displayed, And like a shooting star he cleft the night: He charged the flames, and those that disobeyed, He lashed to duty with his sword of light. CCLXXIII The fugitive flames, chastised, went forth to prey On pious structures, by our fathers reared; By which to heaven they did affect the way, Ere faith in churchmen without works was heard. CCLXXIV The wanting orphans saw, with watery eyes, Their founders' charity in dust laid low; And sent to God their ever-answered cries; For He protects the poor, who made them so. CCLXXV Nor could thy fabric, Paul's, defend thee long, Though thou wert sacred to thy Maker's praise; Though made immortal by a poet's song, And poets' songs the Theban walls could raise. CCLXXVI The daring flames peeped in, and saw from far The awful beauties of the sacred quire; But since it was profaned by civil war, Heaven thought it fit to have it purged by fire. CCLXXVII Now down the narrow streets it swiftly came, And, widely opening, did on both sides prey; This benefit we sadly owe the flame, If only ruin must enlarge our way. CCLXXVIII And now four days the sun had seen our woes; Four nights the moon beheld the incessant fire; It seemed as if the stars more sickly rose, And farther from the feverish north retire. CCLXXIX In the empyrean heaven, the blessed abode, The Thrones and the Dominions prostrate lie, Not daring to behold their angry God; And an hushed silence damps the tuneful sky. CCLXXX At length the Almighty cast a pitying eye, And mercy softly touched his melting breast; He saw the town's one half in rubbish lie, And eager flames give on to storm the rest. CCLXXXI An hollow crystal pyramid he takes, In firmamental waters dipt above; Of it a broad extinguisher he makes, And hoods the flames that to their quarry strove. CCLXXXII The vanquished fires withdraw from every place, Or, full with feeding, sink into a sleep: Each household genius shows again his face, And from the hearths the little Lares creep. CCLXXXIII Our King this more than natural change beholds; With sober joy his heart and eyes abound: To the All-good his lifted hands he folds, And thanks him low on his redeemed ground. CCLXXXIV As when sharp frosts had long constrained the earth, A kindly thaw unlocks it with mild rain; And first the tender blade peeps up to birth, And straight the green fields laugh with promised grain. CCLXXXV By such degrees the spreading gladness grew In every heart which fear had froze before; The standing streets with so much joy they view, That with less grief the perished they deplore. CCLXXXVI The father of the people opened wide His stores, and all the poor with plenty fed: Thus God's anointed God's own place supplied, And filled the empty with his daily bread. CCLXXXVII This royal bounty brought its own reward, And in their minds so deep did print the sense, That if their ruins sadly they regard, 'Tis but with fear the sight might drive him thence. CCLXXXVIII But so may he live long, that town to sway, City's request to the King not to leave them. Which by his auspice they will nobler make, As he will hatch their ashes by his stay, And not their humble ruins now forsake. CCLXXXIX They have not lost their loyalty by fire; Nor is their courage or their wealth so low, That from his wars they poorly would retire, Or beg the pity of a vanquished foe. CCXC Not with more constancy the Jews, of old, By Cyrus from rewarded exile sent, Their royal city did in dust behold, Or with more vigour to rebuild it went. CCXCI The utmost malice of the stars is past, And two dire comets, which have scourged the town, In their own plague and fire have breathed their last, Or dimly in their sinking sockets frown. CCXCII Now frequent trines the happier lights among, And high-raised Jove, from his dark prison freed, Those weights took off that on his planet hung, Will gloriously the new-laid work succeed. CCXCIII Methinks already from this chemic flame, I see a city of more precious mould; Rich as the town Mexico. which gives the Indies name, With silver paved, and all divine with gold. CCXCIV Already labouring with a mighty fate, She shakes the rubbish from her mountain brow, And seems to have renewed her charter's date, Which heaven will to the death of time allow. CCXCV More great than human now, and more august, Augusta, the old name of London. New deified she from her fires does rise; Her widening streets on new foundations trust, And opening into larger parts she flies. CCXCVI Before, she like some shepherdess did show, Who sat to bathe her by a river's side; Not answering to her fame, but rude and low, Nor taught the beauteous arts of modern pride. CCXCVII Now, like a maiden queen, she will behold, From her high turrets, hourly suitors come; The East with incense, and the West with gold, Will stand like suppliants to receive her doom. CCXCVIII The silver Thames, her own domestic flood, Shall bear her vessels like a sweeping train; And often wind, as of his mistress proud, With longing eyes to meet her face again. CCXCIX The wealthy Tagus, and the wealthier Rhine, The glory of their towns no more shall boast; And Seine, that would with Belgian rivers join, Shall find her lustre stained, and traffic lost. CCC The venturous merchant, who designed more far, And touches on our hospitable shore, Charmed with the splendour of this northern star, Shall here unlade him, and depart no more. CCCI Our powerful navy shall no longer meet, The wealth of France or Holland to invade; The beauty of this town, without a fleet, From all the world shall vindicate her trade. CCCII And while this famed emporium we prepare, The British ocean shall such triumphs boast, That those, who now disdain our trade to share, Shall rob like pirates on our wealthy coast. CCCIII Already we have conquered half the war, And the less dangerous part is left behind; Our trouble now is but to make them dare, And not so great to vanquish as to find. CCCIV Thus to the eastern wealth through storms we go, But now, the Cape once doubled, fear no more; A constant trade-wind will securely blow, And gently lay us on the spicy shore. ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL TO THE UNKNOWN AUTHOR OF THIS EXCELLENT POEM. Take it as earnest of a faith renewed, Your theme is vast, your verse divinely good: Where, though the Nine their beauteous strokes repeat, And the turned lines on golden anvils beat, It looks as if they strook them at a heat. So all serenely great, so just refined, Like angels' love to human seed inclined, It starts a giant, and exalts the kind. 'Tis spirit seen, whose fiery atoms roll, So brightly fierce, each syllable's a soul. 'Tis miniature of man, but he's all heart; 'Tis what the world would be, but wants the art; To whom even the fanatics altars raise, Bow in their own despite, and grin your praise. As if a Milton from the dead arose, Filed off the rust, and the right party chose. Nor, Sir, be shocked at what the gloomy say, Turn not your feet too inward, nor too splay. 'Tis gracious all, and great; push on your theme, Lean your grieved head on David's diadem. David, that rebel Israel's envy moved, David, by God and all good men beloved. The beauties of your Absalom excel; But more the charms of charming Annabel; Of Annabel, than May's first morn more bright, Cheerful as summer's noon, and chaste as winter's night. Of Annabel the muses' dearest theme, Of Annabel the angel of my dream. Thus let a broken eloquence attend, And to your master-piece these shadows send. TO THE UNKNOWN AUTHOR OF THIS ADMIRABLE POEM. I thought,—forgive my sin,—the boasted fire Of poets' souls did long ago expire; Of folly or of madness did accuse The wretch that thought himself possessed with muse; Laughed at the God within, that did inspire With more than human thoughts the tuneful quire; But sure 'tis more than fancy, or the dream Of rhymers slumb'ring by the muses' stream. Some livelier spark of heaven, and more refined From earthly dross, fills the great poet's mind. Witness these mighty and immortal lines, Through each of which th'informing genius shines. Scarce a diviner flame inspired the king Of whom thy muse does so sublimely sing. Not David's self could in a nobler verse His gloriously offending son rehearse, Though in his breast the prophet's fury met The father's fondness, and the poet's wit. Here all consent in wonder and in praise, And to the unknown poet altars raise, Which thou must needs accept with equal joy, As when Æneas heard the wars of Troy, Wrapt up himself in darkness and unseen, Extolled with wonder by the Tyrian Queen. Sure thou already art secure of fame, Nor want'st new glories to exalt thy name; What father else would have refused to own So great a son as godlike Absalon? R. D. TO THE CONCEALED AUTHOR OF THIS INCOMPARABLE POEM. Hail, heaven-born muse! hail every sacred page! The glory of our isle and of our age. The inspiring sun to Albion draws more nigh, The north at length teems with a work to vie With Homer's flame and Virgil's majesty. While Pindus lofty heights our poet sought, (His ravished mind with vast ideas fraught), Our language failed beneath his rising thought; This checks not his attempt, for Maro's mines, He drains of all their gold t'adorn his lines; Through each of which the Mantuan Genius shines. The rock obeyed the powerful Hebrew guide, Her flinty breast dissolved into a tide; Thus on our stubborn language he prevails, And makes the Helicon in which he sails. The dialect, as well as sense, invents, And, with his poem, a new speech presents. Hail then, thou matchless bard, thou great unknown, That give your country fame, yet shun you own! In vain—for everywhere your praise you find, And not to meet it, you must shun mankind. Your loyal theme each loyal reader draws, And even the factious give your verse applause, Whose lightning strikes to ground their idol cause. The cause for whose dear sake they drank a flood Of civil gore, nor spared the royal blood; The cause whose growth to crush, our prelates wrote In vain, almost in vain our heroes fought. Yet by one stab of your keen satire dies; Before your sacred lines their shattered Dagon lies. Oh! if unworthy we appear to know The sire, to whom this lovely birth we owe; Denied our ready homage to express, And can at best but thankful be by guess; This hope remains,—May David's godlike mind, (For him 'twas wrote) the unknown author find, And, having found, shower equal favours down, On wit so vast as could oblige a crown. N. T. TO THE AUTHOR OF THAT INCOMPARABLE POEM ABOVE MENTIONED. Homer, amazed, resigns the hill to you, And stands i'the crowd, amidst the panting crew: Virgil and Horace dare not show their face, And long admired Juv'nal quits his place; For this one mighty poem hath done more Than all those poets could have done before. Satire, or statesmen, poet, or divine, Thou any thing, thou every thing that's fine, Thy lines will make young Absalom relent; And, though 'tis hard, Achitophel repent; And stop—as thou hast done— Thus once thy rival muse, on Cooper's Hill, With the true story would not Fatme kill. No politics exclude repentance quite; Despair makes rebels obstinately fight; 'Tis well when errors do for mercy call; Unbloody conquests are the best of all. Methinks I see a numerous mixed crowd Of seduced patriots crying out aloud For grace, to royal David. He, with tears, Holds forth his sceptre, to prevent their fears, And bids them welcome to his tender breast: Thus may the people, thus the king be blest. Then tunes his harp, thy praises to rehearse, Who owes his son and subjects to thy verse. ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL. PART I. ? Si proprius sles Te capiet magis. In pious times, ere priestcraft did begin, Before polygamy was made a sin; When man on many multiplied his kind, Ere one to one was cursedly confined; When nature prompted, and no law denied, Promiscuous use of concubine and bride; Then Israel's monarch after heaven's own heart, His vigorous warmth did variously impart To wives and slaves; and, wide as his command, Scattered his Maker's image through the land. Michal, of royal blood, the crown did wear, A soil ungrateful to the tiller's care: Not so the rest; for several mothers bore To godlike David several sons before. But since like slaves his bed they did ascend, No true succession could their seed attend. Of all the numerous progeny was none So beautiful, so brave, as Absalon; Whether inspired by some diviner lust, His father got him with a greater gust; Or that his conscious destiny made way, By manly beauty, to imperial sway. Early in foreign fields he won renown, With kings and states, allied to Israel's crown; In peace the thoughts of war he could remove, And seemed as he were only born for love. Whate'er he did, was done with so much ease, In him alone 'twas natural to please; His motions all accompanied with grace, And paradise was opened in his face. With secret joy indulgent David viewed His youthful image in his son renewed; To all his wishes nothing he denied, And made the charming Annabel his bride. What faults he had,—for who from faults is free? His father could not, or he would not see. Some warm excesses, which the law forbore, Were construed youth that purged by boiling o'er; And Amnon's murder, by a specious name, Was called a just revenge for injured fame. Thus praised and loved, the noble youth remained, While David undisturbed in Sion reigned. But life can never be sincerely blest; Heaven punishes the bad, and proves the best. The Jews, a headstrong, moody, murmuring race, As ever tried the extent and stretch of grace; God's pampered people, whom, debauched with ease, No king could govern, nor no God could please; Gods they had tried of every shape and size, That godsmiths could produce, or priests devise; These Adam-wits, too fortunately free, Began to dream they wanted liberty: And when no rule, no precedent was found, Of men, by laws less circumscribed and bound; They led their wild desires to woods and caves, And thought that all but savages were slaves. They who, when Saul was dead, without a blow, Made foolish Ishbosheth the crown forego; Who banished David did from Hebron bring, And with a general shout proclaimed him king; Those very Jews, who at their very best, Their humour more than loyalty exprest, Now wondered why so long they had obeyed An idol monarch, which their hands had made; Thought they might ruin him they could create, Or melt him to that golden calf,—a State. But these were random bolts; no formed design, Nor interest made the factious crowd to join: The sober part of Israel, free from stain, Well knew the value of a peaceful reign; And, looking backward with a wise affright, Saw seams of wounds dishonest to the sight; In contemplation of whose ugly scars, They curst the memory of civil wars. The moderate sort of men, thus qualified, Inclined the balance to the better side; And David's mildness managed it so well, The bad found no occasion to rebel. But when to sin our biassed nature leans, The careful devil is still at hand with means, And providently pimps for ill desires; The good old cause, revived, a plot requires. Plots, true or false, are necessary things, To raise up commonwealths, and ruin kings. The inhabitants of old Jerusalem Were Jebusites; the town so called from them; And theirs the native right.— But when the chosen people grew more strong, The rightful cause at length became the wrong; And every loss the men of Jebus bore, They still were thought God's enemies the more. Thus worn or weakened, well or ill content, Submit they must to David's government; Impoverished and deprived of all command, Their taxes doubled as they lost their land; And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood, Their gods disgraced, and burnt like common wood. This set the heathen priesthood in a flame; For priests of all religions are the same. Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be, Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree, In his defence his servants are as bold, As if he had been born of beaten gold. The Jewish rabbins, though their enemies, In this conclude them honest men and wise; For 'twas their duty, all the learned think, To espouse his cause, by whom they eat and drink. From hence began that plot, the nation's curse; Bad in itself, but represented worse; Raised in extremes, and in extremes decried; With oaths affirmed, with dying vows denied; Not weighed nor winnowed by the multitude, But swallowed in the mass, unchewed and crude. Some truth there was, but dashed and brewed with lies, To please the fools, and puzzle all the wise. Succeeding times did equal folly call, Believing nothing, or believing all. The Egyptian rites the Jebusites embraced, Where gods were recommended by their taste. Such savoury deities must needs be good, As served at once for worship and for food. By force they could not introduce these gods,— For ten to one in former days was odds,— So fraud was used, the sacrificer's trade; Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade. Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews, And raked for converts even the court and stews; Which Hebrew priests the more unkindly took, Because the fleece accompanies the flock. Some thought they God's anointed meant to slay By guns, invented since full many a day: Our author swears it not; but who can know How far the devil and Jebusites may go? This plot, which failed for want of common sense, Had yet a deep and dangerous consequence; For as, when raging fevers boil the blood, The standing lake soon floats into a flood, And every hostile humour, which before Slept quiet in its channels, bubbles o'er; So several factions, from this first ferment, Work up to foam, and threat the government. Some by their friends, more by themselves thought wise, Opposed the power to which they could not rise; Some had in courts been great, and, thrown from thence, Like fiends, were hardened in impenitence; Some, by their monarch's fatal mercy, grown From pardoned rebels kinsmen to the throne, Were raised in power and public office high; Strong bands, if bands ungrateful men could tie. Of these the false Achitophel was first; A name to all succeeding ages curst: For close designs, and crooked counsels fit; Sagacious, bold, and turbulent of wit; Restless, unfixed in principles and place; In power unpleased, impatient of disgrace; A fiery soul, which, working out its way, Fretted the pigmy-body to decay, And o'er-informed the tenement of clay. A daring pilot in extremity, Pleased with the danger, when the waves went high, He sought the storms; but, for a calm unfit, Would steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit. Great wits are sure to madness near allied, And thin partitions do their bounds divide; Else, why should he, with wealth and honour blest, Refuse his age the needful hours of rest? Punish a body which he could not please; Bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease? And all to leave what with his toil he won, To that unfeathered two-legged thing, a son; Got, while his soul did huddled notions try; And born a shapeless lump, like anarchy. In friendship false, implacable in hate; Resolved to ruin, or to rule the state. To compass this the triple bond he broke; The pillars of the public safety shook; And fitted Israel for a foreign yoke; Then, seized with fear, yet still affecting fame, Usurped a patriot's all-atoning name. So easy still it proves in factious times, With public zeal to cancel private crimes. How safe is treason, and how sacred ill, Where none can sin against the people's will? Where crowds can wink, and no offence be known, Since in another's guilt they find their own? Yet fame deserved no enemy can grudge; The statesman we abhor, but praise the judge. In Israel's courts ne'er sat an Abbethdin With more discerning eyes, or hands more clean, Unbribed, unsought, the wretched to redress; Swift of dispatch, and easy of access. Oh! had be been content to serve the crown, With virtue only proper to the gown; Or had the rankness of the soil been freed From cockle, that oppressed the noble seed; David for him his tuneful harp had strung, And heaven had wanted one immortal song. But wild ambition loves to slide, not stand, And fortune's ice prefers to virtue's land. Achitophel, grown weary to possess A lawful fame, and lazy happiness, Disdained the golden fruit to gather free, And lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree. Now, manifest of crimes contrived long since, He stood at bold defiance with his prince; Held up the buckler of the people's cause Against the crown, and skulked behind the laws. The wished occasion of the plot he takes; Some circumstances finds, but more he makes; By buzzing emissaries fills the ears Of listening crowds with jealousies and fears Of arbitrary counsels brought to light, And proves the king himself a Jebusite. Weak arguments! which yet, he knew full well, Were strong with people easy to rebel. For, governed by the moon, the giddy Jews Tread the same track when she the prime renews; And once in twenty years their scribes record, By natural instinct they change their lord. Achitophel still wants a chief, and none Was found so fit as warlike Absalon. Not that he wished his greatness to create, For politicians neither love nor hate; But, for he knew his title not allowed, Would keep him still depending on the crowd; That kingly power, thus ebbing out, might be Drawn to the dregs of a democracy. Him he attempts with studied arts to please, And sheds his venom in such words as these. “Auspicious prince, at whose nativity Some royal planet ruled the southern sky; Thy longing country's darling and desire; Their cloudy pillar and their guardian fire; Their second Moses, whose extended wand Divides the seas, and shows the promised land; Whose dawning day, in every distant age, Has exercised the sacred prophet's rage; The people's prayer, the glad diviner's theme, The young men's vision, and the old men's dream! Thee, Saviour, thee the nation's vows confess, And, never satisfied with seeing, bless; Swift unbespoken pomps thy steps proclaim, And stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name. How long wilt thou the general joy detain, Starve and defraud the people of thy reign; Content ingloriously to pass thy days, Like one of virtue's fools that feed on praise; Till thy fresh glories, which now shine so bright, Grow stale, and tarnish with our daily sight? Believe me, royal youth, thy fruit must be Or gathered ripe, or rot upon the tree. Heaven has to all allotted, soon or late, Some lucky revolution of their fate; Whose motions if we watch and guide with skill (For human good depends on human will), Our fortune rolls as from a smooth descent, And from the first impression takes the bent; But, if unseized, she glides away like wind, And leaves repenting folly far behind. Now, now she meets you with a glorious prize, And spreads her locks before you as she flies. Had thus old David, from whose loins you spring, Not dared, when fortune called him, to be king, At Gath an exile he might still remain, And heaven's anointing oil had been in vain. Let his successful youth your hopes engage; But shun the example of declining age: Behold him setting in his western skies, The shadows lengthening as the vapours rise. He is not now, as when, on Jordan's sand, The joyful people thronged to see him land, Covering the beach and blackening all the strand; But, like the prince of angels, from his height Comes tumbling downward with diminished light; Betrayed by one poor plot to public scorn, Our only blessing since his curst return; Those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind, Blown off and scattered by a puff of wind. What strength can he to your designs oppose, Naked of friends, and round beset with foes? If Pharaoh's doubtful succour he should use, A foreign aid would more incense the Jews; Proud Egypt would dissembled friendship bring; Foment the war, but not support the king: Nor would the royal party e'er unite With Pharaoh's arms to assist the Jebusite; Or, if they should, their interest soon would break, And with such odious aid make David weak. All sorts of men, by my successful arts Abhorring kings, estrange their altered hearts From David's rule; and 'tis the general cry, Religion, commonwealth, and liberty. If you, as champion of the public good, Add to their arms a chief of royal blood, What may not Israel hope, and what applause Might such a general gain by such a cause? Not barren praise alone, that gaudy flower Fair only to the sight, but solid power; And nobler is a limited command, Given by the love of all your native land, Than a successive title, long and dark, Drawn from the mouldy rolls of Noah's ark.” What cannot praise effect in mighty minds, When flattery soothes, and when ambition blinds? Desire of power, on earth a vicious weed, Yet, sprung from high, is of celestial seed; In God 'tis glory; and when men aspire, 'Tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire. The ambitious youth, too covetous of fame, Too full of angel's metal in his frame, Unwarily was led from virtue's ways, Made drunk with honour, and debauched with praise. Half loath, and half consenting to the ill,— For loyal blood within him struggled still,— He thus replied.—“And what pretence have I To take up arms for public liberty? My father governs with unquestioned right, The faith's defender, and mankind's delight; Good, gracious, just, observant of the laws; And heaven by wonders has espoused his cause. Whom has he wronged in all his peaceful reign? Who sues for justice to his throne in vain? What millions has he pardoned of his foes, Whom just revenge did to his wrath expose! Mild, easy, humble, studious of our good, Inclined to mercy, and averse from blood. If mildness ill with stubborn Israel suit, His crime is God's beloved attribute. What could he gain his people to betray, Or change his right for arbitrary sway? Let haughty Pharaoh curse with such a reign His fruitful Nile, and yoke a servile train. If David's rule Jerusalem displease, The dog-star heats their brains to this disease. Why then should I, encouraging the bad, Turn rebel, and run popularly mad? Were he a tyrant, who by lawless might Oppressed the Jews, and raised the Jebusite, Well might I mourn; but nature's holy bands Would curb my spirits, and restrain my hands: The people might assert their liberty; But what was right in them were crime in me. His favour leaves me nothing to require, Prevents my wishes, and outruns desire. What more can I expect while David lives? All but his kingly diadem he gives; And that”—But there he paused; then sighing, said— “Is justly destined for a worthier head; For, when my father from his toils shall rest, And late augment the number of the blest, His lawful issue shall the throne ascend, Or the collateral line, where that shall end. His brother, though oppressed with vulgar spite, Yet dauntless, and secure of native right, Of every royal virtue stands possest; Still dear to all the bravest and the best. His courage foes, his friends his truth proclaim; His loyalty the king, the world his fame. His mercy even the offending crowd will find; For sure he comes of a forgiving kind. Why should I then repine at heaven's decree, Which gives me no pretence to royalty? Yet oh that fate, propitiously inclined, Had raised my birth, or had debased my mind; To my large soul not all her treasure lent, And then betrayed it to a mean descent! I find, I find my mounting spirits bold, And David's part disdains my mother's mould. Why am I scanted by a niggard birth? My soul disclaims the kindred of her earth; And, made for empire, whispers me within, Desire of greatness is a godlike sin.” Him staggering so, when hell's dire agent found, While fainting virtue scarce maintained her ground, He pours fresh forces in, and thus replies: “The eternal God, supremely good and wise, Imparts not these prodigious gifts in vain. What wonders are reserved to bless your reign! Against your will your arguments have shown, Such virtue's only given to guide a throne. Not that your father's mildness I contemn; But manly force becomes the diadem. 'Tis true, he grants the people all they crave; And more, perhaps, than subjects ought to have; For lavish grants suppose a monarch tame, And more his goodness than his wit proclaim: But when should people strive their bonds to break, If not when kings are negligent, or weak? Let him give on till he can give no more, The thrifty sanhedrim shall keep him poor; And every shekel, which he can receive, Shall cost a limb of his prerogative. To ply him with new plots shall be my care, Or plunge him deep in some expensive war; Which when his treasure can no more supply, He must, with the remains of kingship, buy. His faithful friends, our jealousies and fears Call Jebusites, and Pharaoh's pensioners; Whom when our fury from his aid has torn, He shall be naked left to public scorn. The next successor, whom I fear and hate, My arts have made obnoxious to the state; Turned all his virtues to his overthrow, And gained our elders to pronounce a foe. His right, for sums of necessary gold, Shall first be pawned, and afterwards be sold; Till time shall ever-wanting David draw, To pass your doubtful title into law: If not, the people have a right supreme To make their kings; for kings are made for them. All empire is no more than power in trust, Which, when resumed, can be no longer just. Succession, for the general good designed, In its own wrong a nation cannot bind; If altering that the people can relieve, Better one suffer than a million grieve. The Jews well know their power; ere Saul they chose, God was their king, and God they durst depose. Urge now your piety, your filial name, A father's right, and fear of future fame;— The public good, that universal call, To which even heaven submitted, answers all. Nor let his love enchant your generous mind; 'Tis nature's trick to propagate her kind. Our fond begetters, who would never die, Love but themselves in their posterity. Or let his kindness by the effects be tried, Or let him lay his vain pretence aside. God said, he loved your father; could he bring A better proof, than to anoint him king? It surely showed he loved the shepherd well, Who gave so fair a flock as Israel. Would David have you thought his darling son? What means he then to alienate the crown? The name of godly he may blush to bear; 'Tis after God's own heart to cheat his heir. He to his brother gives supreme command, To you a legacy of barren land; Perhaps the old harp, on which he thrums his lays, Or some dull Hebrew ballad in your praise. Then the next heir, a prince severe and wise, Already looks on you with jealous eyes; Sees through the thin disguises of your arts, And marks your progress in the people's hearts; Though now his mighty soul its grief contains, He meditates revenge who least complains; And like a lion, slumbering in the way, Or sleep dissembling, while he waits his prey, His fearless foes within his distance draws, Constrains his roaring, and contracts his paws; Till, at the last, his time for fury found, He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground; The prostrate vulgar passes o'er and spares, But with a lordly rage his hunters tears. Your case no tame expedients will afford; Resolve on death, or conquest by the sword, Which for no less a stake than life you draw; And self-defence is nature's eldest law. Leave the warm people no considering time; For then rebellion may be thought a crime. Prevail yourself of what occasion gives, But try your title while your father lives; And that your arms may have a fair pretence, Proclaim you take them in the king's defence; Whose sacred life each minute would expose To plots, from seeming friends, and secret foes. And who can sound the depth of David's soul? Perhaps his fear his kindness may control. He fears his brother, though he loves his son, For plighted vows too late to be undone. If so, by force he wishes to be gained; Like woman's lechery to seem constrained. Doubt not; but, when he most affects the frown, Commit a pleasing rape upon the crown. Secure his person to secure your cause; They, who possess the prince, possess the laws.” He said, and this advice, above the rest, With Absalom's mild nature suited best; Unblamed of life, ambition set aside, Not stained with cruelty, nor puffed with pride. How happy had he been, if destiny Had higher placed his birth, or not so high! His kingly virtues might have claimed a throne, And blest all other countries but his own; But charming greatness since so few refuse, 'Tis juster to lament him than accuse. Strong were his hopes a rival to remove, With blandishments to gain the public love; To head the faction while their zeal was hot, And popularly prosecute the plot. To further this, Achitophel unites The malcontents of all the Israelites; Whose differing parties he could wisely join, For several ends, to serve the same design. The best,—and of the princes some were such,— Who thought the power of monarchy too much; Mistaken men, and patriots in their hearts; Not wicked, but seduced by impious arts. By these the springs of property were bent, And wound so high, they cracked the government. The next for interest sought to embroil the state, To sell their duty at a dearer rate, And make their Jewish markets of the throne; Pretending public good, to serve their own. Others thought kings an useless heavy load, Who cost too much, and did too little good. These were for laying honest David by, On principles of pure good husbandry. With them joined all the haranguers of the throng, That thought to get preferment by the tongue. Who follow next a double danger bring, Not only hating David, but the king; The Solymæan rout; well versed, of old, In godly faction, and in treason bold; Cow'ring and quaking at a conqueror's sword, But lofty to a lawful prince restored; Saw with disdain an Ethnic plot begun, And scorned by Jebusites to be outdone. Hot Levites headed these; who, pulled before From the ark, which in the Judges' days they bore, Resumed their cant, and, with a zealous cry, Pursued their old beloved theocracy; Where sanhedrim and priest enslaved the nation, And justified their spoils by inspiration. For who so fit to reign as Aaron's race, If once dominion they could found in grace? These led the pack; though not of surest scent, Yet deepest mouthed against the government. A numerous host of dreaming saints succeed, Of the true old enthusiastic breed; 'Gainst form and order they their power employ, Nothing to build, and all things to destroy. But far more numerous was the herd of such, Who think too little, and who talk too much. These out of mere instinct, they knew not why, Adored their fathers' God, and property; And, by the same blind benefit of fate, The devil and the Jebusite did hate; Born to be saved, even in their own despite, Because they could not help believing right. Such were the tools; but a whole Hydra more Remains of sprouting heads too long to score. Some of their chiefs were princes of the land: In the first rank of these did Zimri stand; A man so various, that he seemed to be Not one, but all mankind's epitome; Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong, Was everything by starts, and nothing long; But, in the course of one revolving moon, Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon; Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking, Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking. Blest madman, who could every hour employ, With something new to wish, or to enjoy! Railing and praising were his usual themes; And both, to show his judgment, in extremes; So over violent, or over civil, That every man with him was God or devil. In squandering wealth was his peculiar art; Nothing went unrewarded but desert. Beggared by fools, whom still he found too late; He had his jest, and they had his estate. He laughed himself from court; then sought relief By forming parties, but could ne'er be chief; For, spite of him, the weight of business fell On Absalom, and wise Achitophel; Thus, wicked but in will, of means bereft, He left not faction, but of that was left. Titles and names 'twere tedious to rehearse Of lords, below the dignity of verse. Wits, warriors, commonwealths-men, were the best; Kind husbands, and mere nobles, all the rest. And therefore, in the name of dulness, be The well-hung Balaam and cold Caleb free; And canting Nadab let oblivion damn, Who made new porridge for the paschal lamb. Let friendship's holy band some names assure; Some their own worth, and some let scorn secure. Nor shall the rascal rabble here have place, Whom kings no titles gave, and God no grace: Not bull-faced Jonas, who could statutes draw To mean rebellion, and make treason law. But he, though bad, is followed by a worse, The wretch, who heaven's anointed dared to curse; Shimei,—whose youth did early promise bring Of zeal to God, and hatred to his king,— Did wisely from expensive sins refrain, And never broke the Sabbath but for gain: Nor ever was he known an oath to vent, Or curse, unless against the government. Thus heaping wealth, by the most ready way Among the Jews, which was—to cheat and pray; The city, to reward his pious hate Against his master, chose him magistrate. His hand a vare of justice did uphold; His neck was loaded with a chain of gold. During his office treason was no crime; The sons of Belial had a glorious time: For Shimei, though not prodigal of pelf, Yet loved his wicked neighbour as himself. When two or three were gathered to declaim Against the monarch of Jerusalem, Shimei was always in the midst of them: And, if they cursed the king when he was by, Would rather curse than break good company. If any durst his factious friends accuse, He packed a jury of dissenting Jews; Whose fellow-feeling in the godly cause Would free the suffering saint from human laws: For laws are only made to punish those Who serve the king, and to protect his foes. If any leisure-time he had from power,— Because 'tis sin to misemploy an hour,— His business was, by writing, to persuade, That kings were useless, and a clog to trade; And, that his noble style he might refine, No Rechabite more shunned the fumes of wine. Chaste were his cellars, and his shrieval board The grossness of a city-feast abhorred. His cooks, with long disuse, their trade forgot; Cool was his kitchen, though his brains were hot. Such frugal virtue malice may accuse; But sure 'twas necessary to the Jews: For towns, once burnt, such magistrates require, As dare not tempt God's providence by fire. With spiritual food he fed his servants well, But free from flesh, that made the Jews rebel: And Moses' laws he held in more account, For forty days of fasting in the mount. To speak the rest (who better are forgot), Would tire a well-breathed witness of the plot. Yet Corah, thou shalt from oblivion pass; Erect thyself, thou monumental brass, High as the serpent of thy metal made, While nations stand secure beneath thy shade! What though his birth were base, yet comets rise From earthy vapours, ere they shine in skies. Prodigious actions may as well be done By weaver's issue, as by prince's son. This arch-attester for the public good By that one deed ennobles all his blood. Who ever asked the witnesses' high race, Whose oath with martyrdom did Stephen grace? Ours was a Levite, and, as times went then, His tribe were God Almighty's gentlemen. Sunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud: Sure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud: His long chin proved his wit; his saint-like grace A church vermilion, and a Moses' face. His memory, miraculously great, Could plots, exceeding man's belief, repeat; Which therefore cannot be accounted lies, For human wit could never such devise. Some future truths are mingled in his book; But where the witness failed the prophet spoke: Some things like visionary flight appear; The spirit caught him up,—the Lord knows where, And gave him his rabbinical degree, Unknown to foreign university. His judgment yet his memory did excel; Which pieced his wondrous evidence so well, And suited to the temper of the times, Then groaning under Jebusitic crimes. Let Israel's foes suspect his heavenly call, And rashly judge his writ apocryphal; Our laws for such affronts have forfeits made: He takes his life, who takes away his trade. Were I myself in witness Corah's place, The wretch, who did me such a dire disgrace, Should whet my memory, though once forgot, To make him an appendix of my plot. His zeal to heaven made him his prince despise, And load his person with indignities. But zeal peculiar privilege affords, Indulging latitude to deeds and words: And Corah might for Agag's murder call, In terms as coarse as Samuel used to Saul. What others in his evidence did join, The best that could be had for love or coin, In Corah's own predicament will fall: For witness is a common name to all. Surrounded thus with friends of every sort, Deluded Absalom forsakes the court; Impatient of high hopes, urged with renown, And fired with near possession of a crown. The admiring crowd are dazzled with surprise, And on his goodly person feed their eyes. His joy concealed, he sets himself to show; On each side bowing popularly low: His looks, his gestures, and his words he frames, And with familiar ease repeats their names. Thus formed by nature, furnished out with arts, He glides unfelt into their secret hearts. Then with a kind compassionating look, And sighs, bespeaking pity ere he spoke, Few words he said; but easy those and fit, More slow than Hybla-drops, and far more sweet. “I mourn, my countrymen, your lost estate; Though far unable to prevent your fate: Behold a banished man, for your dear cause Exposed a prey to arbitrary laws! Yet oh! that I alone could be undone, Cut off from empire, and no more a son! Now all your liberties a spoil are made; Egypt and Tyrus intercept your trade, And Jebusites your sacred rites invade. My father,—whom with reverence yet I name— Charmed into ease, is careless of his fame; And, bribed with petty sums of foreign gold, Is grown in Bathsheba's embraces old; Exalts his enemies, his friends destroys, And all his power against himself employs. He gives,—and let him give,—my right away: But why should he his own and yours betray? He, only he, can make the nation bleed, And he alone from my revenge is freed. Take then my tears,”—with that he wiped his eyes,— “'Tis all the aid my present power supplies: No court-informer can these arms accuse; These arms may sons against their fathers use: And 'tis my wish, the next successor's reign May make no other Israelite complain.” Youth, beauty, graceful action seldom fail; But common interest always will prevail; And pity never ceases to be shown To him who makes the people's wrongs his own. The crowd, that still believe their kings oppress, With lifted hands their young Messiah bless: Who now begins his progress to ordain With chariots, horsemen, and a numerous train: From east to west his glories he displays, And, like the sun, the promised land surveys. Fame runs before him as the morning-star, And shouts of joy salute him from afar; Each house receives him as a guardian god, And consecrates the place of his abode. But hospitable treats did most commend Wise Issachar, his wealthy western friend. This moving court, that caught the people's eyes, And seemed but pomp, did other ends disguise: Achitophel had formed it, with intent To sound the depths, and fathom, where it went, The people's hearts, distinguish friends from foes, And try their strength before they came to blows. Yet all was coloured with a smooth pretence Of specious love, and duty to their prince. Religion, and redress of grievances, (Two names that always cheat, and always please,) Are often urged; and good king David's life, Endangered by a brother and a wife. Thus in a pageant-show a plot is made; And peace itself is war in masquerade. Oh foolish Israel! never warned by ill! Still the same bait, and circumvented still! Did ever men forsake their present ease, In midst of health imagine a disease, Take pains contingent mischiefs to foresee, Make heirs for monarchs, and for God decree? What shall we think? Can people give away, Both for themselves and sons, their native sway? Then they are left defenceless to the sword Of each unbounded, arbitrary lord: And laws are vain, by which we right enjoy, If kings unquestioned can those laws destroy. Yet if the crowd be judge of fit and just, And kings are only officers in trust, Then this resuming covenant was declared When kings were made, or is for ever barred. If those, who gave the sceptre, could not tie, By their own deed, their own posterity, How then could Adam bind his future race? How could his forfeit on mankind take place? Or how could heavenly justice damn us all, Who ne'er consented to our father's fall? Then kings are slaves to those whom they command, And tenants to their people's pleasure stand. Add, that the power, for property allowed, Is mischievously seated in the crowd; For who can be secure of private right, If sovereign sway may be dissolved by might? Nor is the people's judgment always true: The most may err as grossly as the few; And faultless kings run down by common cry, For vice, oppression, and for tyranny. What standard is there in a fickle rout, Which, flowing to the mark, runs faster out? Nor only crowds but Sanhedrims may be Infected with this public lunacy, And share the madness of rebellious times, To murder monarchs for imagined crimes. If they may give and take whene'er they please, Not kings alone, the Godhead's images, But government itself, at length must fall To nature's state, where all have right to all. Yet, grant our lords, the people, kings can make, What prudent man a settled throne would shake? For whatsoe'er their sufferings were before, That change they covet makes them suffer more. All other errors but disturb a state; But innovation is the blow of fate. If ancient fabrics nod, and threat to fall, To patch the flaws, and buttress up the wall, Thus far 'tis duty: but here fix the mark; For all beyond it is to touch our ark. To change foundations, cast the frame anew, Is work for rebels, who base ends pursue; At once divine and human laws control, And mend the parts by ruin of the whole. The tampering world is subject to this curse, To physic their disease into a worse. Now what relief can righteous David bring? How fatal 'tis to be too good a king! Friends he has few, so high the madness grows; Who dare be such must be the people's foes. Yet some there were, even in the worst of days; Some let me name, and naming is to praise. In this short file Barzillai first appears; Barzillai, crowned with honour and with years. Long since, the rising rebels he withstood In regions waste beyond the Jordan's flood: Unfortunately brave to buoy the state; But sinking underneath his master's fate: In exile with his godlike prince he mourned; For him he suffered, and with him returned. The court he practised, not the courtier's art: Large was his wealth, but larger was his heart, Which well the noblest objects knew to choose, The fighting warrior, and recording muse. His bed could once a fruitful issue boast; Now more than half a father's name is lost. His eldest hope, with every grace adorned, By me, so heaven will have it, always mourned, And always honoured, snatched in manhood's prime By unequal fates, and providence's crime: Yet not before the goal of honour won, All parts fulfilled of subject and of son: Swift was the race, but short the time to run. Oh narrow circle, but of power divine, Scanted in space, and perfect in thy line! By sea, by land, thy matchless worth was known, Arms thy delight, and war was all thy own: Thy force infused the fainting Tyrians propped, And haughty Pharaoh found his fortune stopped. Oh ancient honour! Oh unconquered hand, Whom foes unpunished never could withstand! But Israel was unworthy of thy name: Short is the date of all immoderate fame. It looks as heaven our ruin had designed, And durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind. Now, free from earth, thy disencumbered soul Mounts up, and leaves behind the clouds and starry pole: From thence thy kindred legions may'st thou bring, To aid the guardian angel of thy king. Here stop, my muse; here cease thy painful flight; No pinions can pursue immortal height: Tell good Barzillai thou canst sing no more, And tell thy soul she should have fled before: Or fled she with his life, and left this verse To hang on her departed patron's hearse? Now take thy steepy flight from heaven, and see If thou canst find on earth another he: Another he would be too hard to find; See then whom thou canst see not far behind. Zadoc the priest, whom, shunning power and place, His lowly mind advanced to David's grace. With him the Sagan of Jerusalem, Of hospitable soul, and noble stem; Him of the western dome, whose weighty sense Flows in fit words, and heavenly eloquence. The prophet's sons, by such example led, To learning and to loyalty were bred: For colleges on bounteous kings depend, And never rebel was to arts a friend. To these succeed the pillars of the laws; Who best could plead, and best can judge a cause. Next them a train of loyal peers ascend; Sharp-judging Adriel, the muses' friend, Himself a muse: in Sanhedrim's debate, True to his prince, but not a slave of state: Whom David's love with honours did adorn, That from his disobedient son were torn. Jotham, of piercing wit, and pregnant thought, Endued by nature, and by learning taught, To move assemblies, who but only tried The worse awhile, then chose the better side: Nor chose alone, but turned the balance too; So much the weight of one brave man can do. Hushai, the friend of David in distress; In public storms, of manly stedfastness; By foreign treaties he informed his youth, And joined experience to his native truth. His frugal care supplied the wanting throne; Frugal for that, but bounteous of his own: 'Tis easy conduct when exchequers flow, But hard the task to manage well the low; For sovereign power is too depressed or high, When kings are forced to sell, or crowds to buy. Indulge one labour more, my weary muse, For Amiel; who can Amiel's praise refuse? Of ancient race by birth, but nobler yet In his own worth, and without title great: The Sanhedrim long time as chief he ruled, Their reason guided, and their passion cooled: So dexterous was he in the crown's defence, So formed to speak a loyal nation's sense, That, as their band was Israel's tribes in small, So fit was he to represent them all. Now rasher charioteers the seat ascend, Whose loose careers his steady skill commend: They, like the unequal ruler of the day, Misguide the seasons, and mistake the way; While he, withdrawn, at their mad labours smiles, And safe enjoys the Sabbath of his toils. These were the chief; a small but faithful band Of worthies, in the breach who dared to stand, And tempt the united fury of the land. With grief they viewed such powerful engines bent, To batter down the lawful government. A numerous faction, with pretended frights, In Sanhedrims to plume the legal rights; The true successor from the court removed; The plot, by hireling witnesses, improved. These ills they saw, and, as their duty bound, They showed the king the danger of the wound; That no concessions from the throne would please, But lenitives fomented the disease: That Absalom, ambitious of the crown, Was made the lure to draw the people down: That false Achitophel's pernicious hate Had turned the plot to ruin church and state: The council violent, the rabble worse; That Shimei taught Jerusalem to curse. With all these loads of injuries opprest, And long revolving in his careful breast The event of things, at last, his patience tired, Thus, from his royal throne, by heaven inspired, The godlike David spoke; with awful fear His train their Maker in their master hear. “Thus long, have I by native mercy swayed, My wrongs dissembled, my revenge delayed; So willing to forgive the offending age; So much the father did the king assuage. But now so far my clemency they slight, The offenders question my forgiving right. That one was made for many, they contend; But 'tis to rule; for that's a monarch's end. They call my tenderness of blood, my fear; Though manly tempers can the longest bear. Yet since they will divert my native course, 'Tis time to show I am not good by force. Those heaped affronts, that haughty subjects bring, Are burdens for a camel, not a king. Kings are the public pillars of the state, Born to sustain and prop the nation's weight: If my young Samson will pretend a call To shake the column, let him share the fall: But oh, that yet he would repent and live! How easy 'tis for parents to forgive! With how few tears a pardon might be won From nature, pleading for a darling son! Poor, pitied youth, by my paternal care Raised up to all the height his fame could bear! Had God ordained his fate for empire born, He would have given his soul another turn: Gulled with a patriot's name, whose modern sense Is one that would by law supplant his prince; The people's brave, the politician's tool; Never was patriot yet, but was a fool. Whence comes it, that religion and the laws Should more be Absalom's than David's cause? His old instructor, ere he lost his place, Was never thought endued with so much grace. Good heavens, how faction can a patriot paint! My rebel ever proves my people's saint. Would they impose an heir upon the throne? Let Sanhedrims be taught to give their own. A king's at least a part of government; And mine as requisite as their consent: Without my leave a future king to choose, Infers a right the present to depose. True, they petition me to approve their choice; But Esau's hands suit ill with Jacob's voice. My pious subjects for my safety pray; Which to secure, they take my power away. From plots and treasons heaven preserve my years, But save me most from my petitioners! Unsatiate as the barren womb or grave; God cannot grant so much as they can crave. What then is left, but with a jealous eye To guard the small remains of royalty? The law shall still direct my peaceful sway, And the same law teach rebels to obey: Votes shall no more established power control,— Such votes, as make a part exceed the whole. No groundless clamours shall my friends remove, Nor crowds have power to punish ere they prove; For gods and godlike kings their care express, Still to defend their servants in distress. Oh, that my power to saving were confined! Why am I forced, like heaven, against my mind, To make examples of another kind? Must I at length the sword of justice draw? Oh curst effects of necessary law! How ill my fear they by my mercy scan! Beware the fury of a patient man. Law they require, let law then show her face; They could not be content to look on grace, Her hinder parts, but with a daring eye, To tempt the terror of her front, and die. By their own arts 'tis righteously decreed, Those dire artificers of death shall bleed. Against themselves their witnesses will swear, Till, viper-like, their mother-plot they tear; And suck for nutriment that bloody gore, Which was their principle of life before. Their Belial with their Beelzebub will fight; Thus on my foes, my foes shall do me right: Nor doubt the event; for factious crowds engage, In their first onset, all their brutal rage. Then let them take an unresisted course; Retire, and traverse, and delude their force: But when they stand all breathless, urge the fight, And rise upon them with redoubled might: For lawful power is still superior found; When long driven back, at length it stands the ground.” He said; the Almighty, nodding, gave consent, And peals of thunder shook the firmament. Henceforth a series of new time began, The mighty years in long procession ran; Once more the godlike David was restored, And willing nations knew their lawful lord. PART II. Si quis tamen hæc quoque, si quis Captus amore leget. ? Since men, like beasts, each other's prey were made, Since trade began, and priesthood grew a trade, Since realms were formed, none, sure, so curst as those, That madly their own happiness oppose; There heaven itself, and godlike kings, in vain Shower down the manna of a gentle reign; While pampered crowds to mad sedition run, And monarchs by indulgence are undone. Thus David's clemency was fatal grown, While wealthy faction awed the wanting throne: For now their sovereign's orders to contemn, Was held the charter of Jerusalem; His rights to invade, his tributes to refuse, A privilege peculiar to the Jews; As if from heavenly call this licence fell, And Jacob's seed were chosen to rebel! Achitophel, with triumph, sees his crimes Thus suited to the madness of the times; And Absalom, to make his hopes succeed, Of flattering charms no longer stands in need; While fond of change, though ne'er so dearly bought, Our tribes outstrip the youth's ambitious thought; His swiftest hopes with swifter homage meet, And crowd their servile necks beneath his feet. Thus to his aid while pressing tides repair, He mounts, and spreads his streamers in the air. The charms of empire might his youth mislead, But what can our besotted Israel plead? Swayed by a monarch, whose serene command Seems half the blessing of our promised land; Whose only grievance is excess of ease, Freedom our pain, and plenty our disease! Yet as all folly would lay claim to sense, And wickedness ne'er wanted a pretence, With arguments they'd make their treason good, And righteous David's self with slanders load: That arts of foreign sway he did affect, And guilty Jebusites from law protect, Whose very chiefs, convict, were never freed, Nay we have seen their sacrifices bleed! Accuser's infamy is urged in vain, While in the bounds of sense they did contain; But soon they launched into the unfathomed tide, And in the depths they knew disdained to ride; For probable discoveries to dispense, Was thought below a pensioned evidence; Mere truth was dull, nor suited with the port Of pampered Corah, when advanced to court. No less than wonders now they will impose, And projects void of grace or sense disclose. Such was the charge on pious Michal brought; Michal, that ne'er was cruel even in thought; The best of queens, and most obedient wife, Impeached of curst designs on David's life! His life, the theme of her eternal prayer, 'Tis scarce so much his guardian angel's care. Not summer morns such mildness can disclose, The Hermon lily, nor the Sharon rose, Neglecting each vain pomp of majesty, Transported Michal feeds her thoughts on high. She lives with angels, and, as angels do, Quits heaven sometimes to bless the world below; Where, cherished by her bounteous plenteous spring, Reviving widows smile, and orphans sing. Oh! when rebellious Israel's crimes at height, Are threatened with her Lord's approaching fate, The piety of Michal then remain In heaven's remembrance, and prolong his reign! Less desolation did the pest pursue, That from Dan's limits to Beersheba slew; Less fatal the repeated wars of Tyre, And less Jerusalem's avenging fire. With gentler terror these our state o'erran, Than since our evidencing days began! On every cheek a pale confusion sat, Continued fear beyond the worst of fate! Trust was no more, art, science, useless made, All occupations lost but Corah's trade. Meanwhile a guard on modest Corah wait, If not for safety, needful yet for state. Well might he deem each peer and prince his slave, And lord it o'er the tribes which he could save: Even vice in him was virtue—what sad fate, But for his honesty, had seized our state? And with what tyranny had we been curst, Had Corah never proved a villain first? To have told his knowledge of the intrigue in gross, Had been, alas, to our deponent's loss: The travelled Levite had the experience got, To husband well and make the best of's plot; And therefore, like an evidence of skill, With wise reserves secured his pension still; Nor quite of future power himself bereft, But limbos large for unbelievers left. And now his writ such reverence had got, 'Twas worse than plotting to suspect his plot: Some were so well convinced, they made no doubt Themselves to help the foundered swearers out; Some had their sense imposed on by their fear, But more for interest sake believe and swear: Even to that height with some the frenzy grew, They raged to find their danger not prove true. Yet, than all these a viler crew remain, Who with Achitophel the cry maintain; Not urged by fear, nor through misguided sense, (Blind zeal and starving need had some pretence), But for the good old cause, that did excite The original rebel's wiles,—revenge, and spite. These raise the plot, to have the scandal thrown Upon the bright successor of the crown, Whose virtue with such wrongs they had pursued, As seemed all hope of pardon to exclude. Thus, while on private ends their zeal is built, The cheated crowd applaud and share their guilt. Such practices as these, too gross to lie Long unobserved by each discerning eye, The more judicious Israelites unspelled, Though still the charm the giddy rabble held; Even Absalom, amidst the dazzling beams Of empire, and ambition's flattering dreams, Perceives the plot, too foul to be excused, To aid designs, no less pernicious, used; And, filial sense yet striving in his breast, Thus to Achitophel his doubts exprest. “Why are my thoughts upon a crown employed, Which, once obtained, can be but half enjoyed? Not so when virtue did my arms require, And to my father's wars I flew entire. My regal power how will my foes resent, When I myself have scarce my own consent? Give me a son's unblemished truth again, Or quench the sparks of duty that remain. How slight to force a throne that legions guard, The task to me; to prove unjust, how hard! And if the imagined guilt thus wound my thought, What will it, when the tragic scene is wrought? Dire war must first be conjured from below, The realm we'd rule we first must overthrow; And when the civil furies are on wing, That blind and undistinguished slaughters fling, Who knows what impious chance may reach the king? Oh! rather let me perish in the strife, Than have my crown the price of David's life! Or, if the tempest of the war he stand, In peace, some vile officious villain's hand His soul's anointed temple may invade, Or, prest by clamorous crowds, myself be made His murtherer; rebellious crowds, whose guilt Shall dread his vengeance till his blood be spilt; Which if my filial tenderness oppose, Since to the empire by their arms I rose, Those very arms on me shall be employed, A new usurper crowned, and I destroyed: The same pretence of public good will hold, And new Achitophels be found as bold To urge the needful change,—perhaps the old.” He said. The statesman with a smile replies, A smile that did his rising spleen disguise:— “My thoughts presumed our labours at an end, And are we still with conscience to contend? Whose want in kings as needful is allowed, As 'tis for them to find it in the crowd. Far in the doubtful passage you are gone, And only can be safe by pressing on. The crown's true heir, a prince severe and wise, Has viewed your motions long with jealous eyes; Your person's charms, your more prevailing arts, And marked your progress in the people's hearts, Whose patience is the effect of stinted power, But treasures vengeance for the fatal hour; And if remote the peril he can bring, Your present danger's greater from the king. Let not a parent's name deceive your sense, Nor trust the father in a jealous prince! Your trivial faults if he could so resent, To doom you little less than banishment, What rage must your presumption since inspire? Against his orders your return from Tyre; Nor only so, but with a pomp more high, And open court of popularity, The factious tribes—And this reproof from thee?” The prince replies,—“O statesman's winding skill! They first condemn, that first advised the ill.”— “Illustrious youth,” returned Achitophel, “Misconstrue not the words that mean you well. The course you steer I worthy blame conclude, But 'tis because you leave it unpursued. A monarch's crown with fate surrounded lies; Who reach, lay hold on death that miss the prize. Did you for this expose yourself to show, And to the crowd bow popularly low; For this your glorious progress next ordain, With chariots, horsemen, and a numerous train; With fame before you like the morning star, And shouts of joy saluting from afar? Oh from the heights you've reached but take a view, Scarce leading Lucifer could fall like you! And must I here my shipwrecked arts bemoan? Have I for this so oft made Israel groan? Your single interest with the nation weighed, And turned the scale where your desires were laid. Even when at helm a course so dangerous moved To land your hopes, as my removal proved.” “I not dispute,” the royal youth replies, “The known perfection of your policies, Nor in Achitophel yet grudge or blame The privilege that statesmen ever claim; Who private interest never yet pursued, But still pretended 'twas for others' good: What politician yet e'er 'scaped his fate, Who saving his own neck not saved the state? From hence on every humorous wind that veered, With shifted sails a several course you steered. What form of sway did David e'er pursue, That seemed like absolute, but sprung from you? Who at your instance quashed each penal law, That kept dissenting factious Jews in awe; And who suspends fixed laws, may abrogate, That done, form new, and so enslave the state. Even property, whose champion now you stand, And seem for this the idol of the land, Did ne'er sustain such violence before, As when your counsel shut the royal store; Advice, that ruin to whole tribes procured, But secret kept till your own banks secured. Recount with this the triple covenant broke, And Israel fitted for a foreign yoke; Nor here your counsels fatal progress stayed, But sent our levied powers to Pharaoh's aid. Hence Tyre and Israel, low in ruins laid, And Egypt, once their scorn, their common terror made. Even yet of such a season can we dream, When royal rights you made your darling theme; For power unlimited could reasons draw, And place prerogative above the law; Which on your fall from office grew unjust, The laws made king, the king a slave in trust; Whom with state-craft, to interest only true, You now accuse of ills contrived by you.” To this hell's agent:—“Royal youth, fix here; Let interest be the star by which you steer. Hence, to repose your trust in me was wise, Whose interest most in your advancement lies; A tie so firm as always will avail, When friendship, nature, and religion fail. On ours the safety of the crowd depends, Secure the crowd, and we obtain our ends; Whom I will cause so far our guilt to share, Till they are made our champions by their fear. What opposition can your rival bring, While sanhedrims are jealous of the king? His strength as yet in David's friendship lies, And what can David's self without supplies? Who with exclusive bills must now dispense, Debar the heir, or starve in his defence; Conditions which our elders ne'er will quit, And David's justice never can admit. Or, forced by wants his brother to betray, To your ambition next he clears the way; For if succession once to nought they bring, Their next advance removes the present king: Persisting else his senates to dissolve, In equal hazard shall his reign involve. Our tribes, whom Pharaoh's power so much alarms, Shall rise without their prince to oppose his arms. Nor boots it on what cause at first they join; Their troops, once up, are tools for our design. At least such subtle covenants shall be made, Till peace itself is war in masquerade. Associations of mysterious sense, Against, but seeming for, the king's defence, Even on their courts of justice fetters draw, And from our agents muzzle up their law. By which a conquest if we fail to make, 'Tis a drawn game at worst, and we secure our stake.” He said, and for the dire success depends On various sects, by common guilt made friends; Whose heads, though ne'er so differing in their creed, I'th' point of treason yet were well agreed. Amongst these, extorting Ishban first appears, Pursued by a meagre troop of bankrupt heirs, Blest times, when Ishban, he whose occupation So long has been to cheat, reforms the nation! Ishban, of conscience suited to his trade, As good a saint as usurer ever made. Yet Mammon has not so engrossed him quite, But Belial lays as large a claim of spite; Who, for those pardons from his prince he draws, Returns reproaches, and cries up the cause. That year in which the city he did sway, He left rebellion in a hopeful way; Yet his ambition once was found so bold, To offer talents of extorted gold, (Could David's wants have so been bribed), to shame And scandalise our peerage with his name; For which his dear sedition he'd forswear, And e'en turn loyal, to be made a peer. Next him, let railing Rabsheka have place, So full of zeal he has no need of grace; A saint that can both flesh and spirit use, Alike haunt conventicles and the stews; Of whom the question difficult appears, If most i'th' preacher's or the bawd's arrears. What caution could appear too much in him, That keeps the treasure of Jerusalem! Let David's brother but approach the town, “Double our guards,” he cries, “we are undone.” Protesting that he dares not sleep in's bed, Lest he should rise next morn without his head. Next these, a troop of busy spirits press, Of little fortunes, and of conscience less; With them the tribe, whose luxury had drained Their banks, in former sequestrations gained; Who rich and great by past rebellions grew, And long to fish the troubled streams anew. Some, future hopes, some, present payment draws, To sell their conscience and espouse the cause. Such stipends those vile hirelings best befit, Priests without grace, and poets without wit. Shall that false Hebronite escape our curse, Judas, that keeps the rebels' pension-purse; Judas, that pays the treason-writer's fee, Judas, that well deserves his namesake's tree; Who at Jerusalem's own gates erects His college for a nursery of sects; Young prophets with an early care secures, And with the dung of his own arts manures! What have the men of Hebron here to do? What part in Israel's promised land have you? Here Phaleg, the lay-Hebronite, is come, 'Cause like the rest he could not live at home; Who from his own possessions could not drain An omer even of Hebronitish grain, Here struts it like a patriot, and talks high Of injured subjects, altered property; An emblem of that buzzing insect just, That mounts the wheel, and thinks she raises dust. Can dry bones live? or skeletons produce The vital warmth of cuckoldising juice? Slim Phaleg could, and, at the table fed, Returned the grateful product to the bed. A waiting-man to travelling nobles chose, He his own laws would saucily impose, Till bastinadoed back again he went, To learn those manners he to teach was sent. Chastised he ought to have retreated home, But he reads politics to Absalom; For never Hebronite, though kicked and scorned, To his own country willingly returned. —But, leaving famished Phaleg to be fed, And to talk treason for his daily bread, Let Hebron, nay let hell, produce a man So made for mischief as Ben-Jochanan; A Jew of humble parentage was he, By trade a Levite, though of low degree; His pride no higher than the desk aspired, But for the drudgery of priests was hired To read and pray in linen ephod brave, And pick up single shekels from the grave. Married at last, and finding charge come faster, He could not live by God, but changed his master; Inspired by want, was made a factious tool, They got a villain, and we lost a fool. Still violent, whatever cause he took, But most against the party he forsook: For renegadoes, who ne'er turn by halves, Are bound in conscience to be double knaves. So this prose-prophet took most monstrous pains, To let his masters see he earned his gains. But as the devil owes all his imps a shame, He chose the apostate for his proper theme; With little pains he made the picture true, And from reflexion took the rogue he drew. A wondrous work, to prove the Jewish nation In every age a murmuring generation; To trace them from their infancy of sinning, And show them factious from their first beginning. To prove they could rebel, and rail, and mock, Much to the credit of the chosen flock; A strong authority which must convince, That saints own no allegiance to their prince; As 'tis a leading-card to make a whore, To prove her mother had turned up before. But, tell me, did the drunken patriarch bless The son that showed his father's nakedness? Such thanks the present church thy pen will give, Which proves rebellion was so primitive. Must ancient failings be examples made? Then murtherers from Cain may learn their trade. As thou the heathen and the saint hast drawn, Methinks the apostate was the better man; And thy hot father, waving my respect, Not of a mother-church, but of a sect. And such he needs must be of thy inditing; This comes of drinking asses' milk and writing. If Balak should be called to leave his place, As profit is the loudest call of grace, His temple, dispossessed of one, would be Replenished with seven devils more by thee. Levi, thou art a load; I'll lay thee down, And show rebellion bare, without a gown; Poor slaves in metre, dull and addle-pated, Who rhyme below even David's psalms translated: Some in my speedy pace I must outrun, As lame Mephibosheth the wizard's son; To make quick way I'll heap o'er heavy blocks, Shun rotten Uzza as I would the pox; And hasten Og and Doeg to rehearse, Two fools that crutch their feeble sense on verse; Who by my muse to all succeeding times Shall live in spite of their own doggrel rhymes. Doeg, though without knowing how or why, Made still a blundering kind of melody; Spurred boldly on, and dashed through thick and thin, Through sense and nonsense, never out nor in; Free from all meaning, whether good or bad, And, in one word, heroically mad. He was too warm on picking-work to dwell, But fagoted his notions as they fell, And, if they rhymed and rattled, all was well. Spiteful he is not, though he wrote a satire, For still there goes some thinking to ill-nature; He needs no more than birds and beasts to think, All his occasions are to eat and drink. If he call rogue and rascal from a garret, He means you no more mischief than a parrot; The words for friend and foe alike were made, To fetter them in verse is all his trade. For almonds he'll cry whore to his own mother, And call young Absalom king David's brother. Let him be gallows-free by my consent, And nothing suffer since he nothing meant; Hanging supposes human soul and reason, This animal's below committing treason; Shall he be hanged who never could rebel? That's a preferment for Achitophel. The woman, that committed buggary, Was rightly sentenced by the law to die; But 'twas hard fate that to the gallows led The dog, that never heard the statute read. Railing in other men may be a crime, But ought to pass for mere instinct in him; Instinct he follows and no farther knows, For, to write verse with him is to transprose; 'Twere pity treason at his door to lay, Who makes heaven's gate a lock to its own key. Let him rail on, let his invective muse Have four-and-twenty letters to abuse, Which if he jumbles to one line of sense, Indict him of a capital offence. In fireworks give him leave to vent his spite, Those are the only serpents he can write; The height of his ambition is, we know, But to be master of a puppet-show; On that one stage his works may yet appear, And a month's harvest keeps him all the year. Now stop your noses, readers, all and some, For here's a tun of midnight-work to come, Og from a treason-tavern rolling home. Round as a globe, and liquored every chink, Goodly and great he sails behind his link. With all this bulk there's nothing lost in Og, For every inch, that is not fool, is rogue; A monstrous mass of foul corrupted matter, As all the devils had spewed to make the batter. When wine has given him courage to blaspheme, He curses God, but God before curst him; And if man could have reason, none has more, That made his paunch so rich, and him so poor. With wealth he was not trusted, for heaven knew What 'twas of old to pamper up a Jew; To what would he on quail and pheasant swell, That even on tripe and carrion could rebel? But though heaven made him poor, with reverence speaking, He never was a poet of God's making; The midwife laid her hand on his thick skull, With this prophetic blessing—Be thou dull; Drink, swear, and roar; forbear no lewd delight Fit for thy bulk; do anything but write. Thou art of lasting make, like thoughtless men, A strong nativity—but for the pen; Eat opium, mingle arsenic in thy drink, Still thou may'st live, avoiding pen and ink. I see, I see, 'tis counsel given in vain, For treason, botched in rhyme, will be thy bane; Rhyme is the rock on which thou art to wreck, 'Tis fatal to thy fame and to thy neck. Why should thy metre good king David blast? A psalm of his will surely be thy last. Darest thou presume in verse to meet thy foes, Thou, whom the penny pamphlet foiled in prose? Doeg, whom God for mankind's mirth has made, O'ertops thy talent in thy very trade; Doeg to thee, thy paintings are so coarse, A poet is, though he's the poet's horse. A double noose thou on thy neck dost pull, For writing treason, and for writing dull; To die for faction is a common evil, But to be hanged for nonsense is the devil. Hadst thou the glories of thy king exprest, Thy praises had been satire at the best; But thou in clumsy verse, unlickt, unpointed, Hast shamefully defied the Lord's anointed. I will not rake the dunghill of thy crimes, For who would read thy life that reads thy rhymes? But of king David's foes be this the doom, May all be like the young man Absalom; And, for my foes, may this their blessing be, To talk like Doeg, and to write like thee! Achitophel each rank, degree, and age, For various ends neglects not to engage; The wise and rich, for purse and counsel brought, The fools and beggars, for their number sought; Who yet not only on the town depends, For even in court the faction had its friends. These thought the places they possest too small, And in their hearts wished court and king to fall; Whose names the muse, disdaining holds i'th' dark, Thrust in the villain herd without a mark; With parasites and libel-spawning imps, Intriguing fops, dull jesters, and worse pimps. Disdain the rascal rabble to pursue, Their set cabals are yet a viler crew. See where involved in common smoke they sit, Some for our mirth, some for our satire fit; These gloomy, thoughtful, and on mischief bent, While those for mere good fellowship frequent The appointed club, can let sedition pass, Sense, nonsense, anything to employ the glass; And who believe, in their dull honest hearts, The rest talk treason but to show their parts; Who ne'er had wit or will for mischief yet, But pleased to be reputed of a set. But in the sacred annals of our plot, Industrious Arod never be forgot; The labours of this midnight magistrate May vie with Corah's to preserve the state. In search of arms he failed not to lay hold On war's most powerful dangerous weapon, gold. And last, to take from Jebusites all odds, Their altars pillaged, stole their very gods. Oft would he cry, when treasure he surprised, 'Tis Baalish gold in David's coin disguised. Which to his house with richer reliques came, While lumber idols only fed the flame; For our wise rabble ne'er took pains to inquire, What 'twas he burnt, so it made a rousing fire. With which our elder was enriched no more Than false Gehazi with the Syrian's store; So poor, that when our choosing tribes were met, Even for his stinking votes he ran in debt; For meat the wicked, and, as authors think, The saints he choused for his electing drink; Thus every shift and subtle method past, And all to be no Zaken at the last. Now, raised on Tyre's sad ruins, Pharaoh's pride Soared high, his legions threat'ning far and wide; As when a battering storm engendered high, By winds upheld, hangs hovering in the sky, Is gazed upon by every trembling swain, This for his vineyard fears, and that his grain, For blooming plants, and flowers new opening; these For lambs eaned lately, and far-labouring bees; To guard his stock each to the gods does call, Uncertain where the fire-charged clouds will fall; Even so the doubtful nations watch his arms, With terror each expecting his alarms. Where, Judah, where was now thy lion's roar? Thou only couldst the captive lands restore; But thou, with inbred broils and faction prest, From Egypt need'st a guardian with the rest. Thy prince from sanhedrims no trust allowed, Too much the representers of the crowd, Who for their own defence give no supply, But what the crown's prerogatives must buy; As if their monarch's rights to violate More needful were, than to preserve the state! From present dangers they divert their care, And all their fears are of the royal heir; Whom now the reigning malice of his foes, Unjudged would sentence, and ere crowned depose; Religion the pretence, but their decree To bar his reign, whate'er his faith shall be. By sanhedrims and clamorous crowds thus prest, What passions rent the righteous David's breast! Who knows not how to oppose or to comply, Unjust to grant, and dangerous to deny! How near in this dark juncture Israel's fate, Whose peace one sole expedient could create, Which yet the extremest virtue did require, Even of that prince whose downfall they conspire! His absence David does with tears advise, To appease their rage; undaunted he complies. Thus he, who, prodigal of blood and ease, A royal life exposed to winds and seas, At once contending with the waves and fire, And heading danger in the wars of Tyre, Inglorious now forsakes his native sand, And, like an exile, quits the promised land. Our monarch scarce from pressing tears refrains, And painfully his royal state maintains, Who now, embracing on the extremest shore, Almost revokes what he enjoyed before; Concludes, at last, more trust to be allowed To storms and seas than to the raging crowd.— Forbear, rash muse, the parting scene to draw, With silence charmed as deep as theirs that saw Not only our attending nobles weep, But hardy sailors swell with tears the deep; The tide restrained her course, and, more amazed, The twin-stars on the royal brothers gazed; While this sole fear— Does trouble to our suffering hero bring, Lest, next, the popular rage oppress the king. Thus parting, each for the other's danger grieved, The shore the king, and seas the prince received.— Go, injured hero! while propitious gales, Soft as thy consort's breath, inspire thy sails; Well may she trust her beauties on a flood, Where thy triumphant fleets so oft have rode! Safe on thy breast reclined, her rest be deep, Rocked, like a Nereid, by the waves asleep; While happiest dreams her fancy entertain, And to Elysian fields convert the main! Go, injured hero! while the shores of Tyre At thy approach so silent shall admire, Who on thy thunder still their thoughts employ, And greet thy landing with a trembling joy. On heroes thus the prophet's fate is thrown, Admired by every nation but their own; Yet while our factious Jews his worth deny, Their aching conscience gives their tongue the lie. Even in the worst of men the noblest parts Confess him, and he triumphs in their hearts; Whom to his king the best respects commend, Of subject, soldier, kinsman, prince and friend; All sacred names of most divine esteem, And to perfection all sustained by him; Wise, just, and constant, courtly without art, Swift to discern and to reward desert; No hour of his in fruitless ease destroyed, But on the noblest subjects still employed; Whose steady soul ne'er learnt to separate Between his monarch's interest and the state, But heaps those blessings on the royal head, Which he well knows must be on subjects shed. On what pretence could then the vulgar rage Against his worth, and native rights engage? Religious fears their argument are made, Religious fears his sacred rights invade! Of future superstition they complain, And Jebusitic worship in his reign; With such alarms his foes the crowd deceive, With dangers fright, which not themselves believe. Since nothing can our sacred rites remove, Whate'er the faith of the successor prove; Our Jews their ark shall undisturbed retain, At least while their religion is their gain, Who know by old experience Baal's commands Not only claimed their conscience but their lands. They grudge God's tithes; how therefore shall they yield An idol full possession of the field? Grant such a prince enthroned, we must confess The people's sufferings than that monarch's less, Who must to hard conditions still be bound, And for his quiet with the crowd compound; Or should his thoughts to tyranny incline, Where are the means to compass the design? Our crown's revenues are too short a store, And jealous sanhedrims would give no more. As vain our fears of Egypt's potent aid; Not so has Pharaoh learnt ambition's trade, Nor ever with such measures can comply, As shock the common rules of policy. None dread like him the growth of Israel's king; And he alone sufficient aids can bring, Who knows that prince to Egypt can give law, That on our stubborn tribes his yoke could draw: At such profound expense he has not stood, Nor dyed for this his hands so deep in blood; Would ne'er through wrong and right his progress take, Grudge his own rest, and keep the world awake, To fix a lawless prince on Judah's throne, First to invade our rights, and then his own; His dear-gained conquests cheaply to despoil, And reap the harvest of his crimes and toil. We grant his wealth vast as our ocean's sand, And curse its fatal influence on our land, Which our bribed Jews so numerously partake, That even an host his pensioners would make. From these deceivers our divisions spring, Our weakness, and the growth of Egypt's king; These, with pretended friendship to the state, Our crowd's suspicion of their prince create, Both pleased and frightened with the specious cry, To guard their sacred rights and property. To ruin thus the chosen flock are sold, While wolves are ta'en for guardians of the fold; Seduced by these we groundlessly complain, And loathe the manna of a gentle reign; Thus our forefathers' crooked paths are trod, We trust our prince no more than they their God. But all in vain our reasoning prophets preach, To those whom sad experience ne'er could teach, Who can commence new broils in bleeding scars, And fresh remembrance of intestine wars; When the same household mortal foes did yield, And brothers stained with brothers' blood the field; When sons' curst steel the fathers' gore did stain, And mothers mourned for sons by fathers slain! When thick as Egypt's locusts on the sand, Our tribes lay slaughtered through the promised land, Whose few survivors with worse fate remain, To drag the bondage of a tyrant's reign; Which scene of woes, unknowing, we renew And madly even those ills we fear pursue; While Pharaoh laughs at our domestic broils, And safely crowds his tents with nations' spoils. Yet our fierce sanhedrim, in restless rage, Against our absent hero still engage, And chiefly urge, such did their frenzy prove, The only suit their prince forbids to move; Which till obtained they cease affairs of state, And real dangers wave for groundless hate. Long David's patience waits relief to bring, With all the indulgence of a lawful king, Expecting till the troubled waves would cease, But found the raging billows still increase. The crowd, whose insolence forbearance swells, While he forgives too far, almost rebels. At last his deep resentments silence broke, The imperial palace shook, while thus he spoke: “Then Justice wake, and Rigour take her time, For lo! our mercy is become our crime. While halting punishment her stroke delays, Our sovereign right, heaven's sacred trust, decays; For whose support even subjects' interest calls, Woe to that kingdom where the monarch falls! That prince, who yields the least of regal sway, So far his people's freedom does betray. Right lives by law, and law subsists by power; Disarm the shepherd, wolves the flock devour. Hard lot of empire o'er a stubborn race, Which heaven itself in vain has tried with grace! When will our reason's long-charmed eyes unclose, And Israel judge between her friends and foes? When shall we see expired deceivers' sway, And credit what our God and monarchs say? Dissembled patriots, bribed with Egypt's gold, Even sanhedrims in blind obedience hold; Those patriots' falsehood in their actions see, And judge by the pernicious fruit the tree; If aught for which so loudly they declaim, Religion, laws, and freedom, were their aim, Our senates in due methods they had led, To avoid those mischiefs which they seem'd to dread; But first, e'er yet they propped the sinking state, To impeach and charge, as urged by private hate, Proves that they ne'er believed the fears they prest, But barbarously destroyed the nation's rest. O whither will ungoverned senates drive? And to what bounds licentious votes arrive? When their injustice we are pressed to share, The monarch urged to exclude the lawful heir. Are princes thus distinguished from the crowd, And this the privilege of royal blood? But grant we should confirm the wrongs they press, His sufferings yet were than the people's less; Condemned for life the murdering sword to wield, And on their heirs entail a bloody field. Thus madly their own freedom they betray, And for the oppression which they fear make way; Succession fixed by heaven, the kingdom's bar, Which, once dissolved, admits the flood of war; Waste, rapine, spoil, without the assault begin, And our mad tribes supplant the fence within. Since, then, their good they will not understand, 'Tis time to take the monarch's power in hand; Authority and force to join with skill, And save the lunatics against their will. The same rough means that 'suage the crowd, appease Our senates, raging with the crowd's disease. Henceforth unbiassed measures let them draw From no false gloss, but genuine text of law; Nor urge those crimes upon religion's score, Themselves so much in Jebusites abhor; Whom laws convict, and only they, shall bleed, Nor Pharisees by Pharisees be freed. Impartial justice from our throne shall shower, All shall have right, and we our sovereign power.” He said; the attendants heard with awful joy, And glad presages their fixed thoughts employ. From Hebron now the suffering heir returned, A realm that long with civil discord mourned; Till his approach, like some arriving god, Composed and healed the place of his abode; The deluge checked that to Judea spread, And stopped sedition at the fountain's head. Thus in forgiving David's paths he drives, And, chased from Israel, Israel's peace contrives. The field confessed his power in arms before, And seas proclaimed his triumphs to the shore; As nobly has his sway in Hebron shown, How fit to inherit godlike David's throne. Through Sion's streets his glad arrival's spread, And conscious faction shrinks her snaky head; His train their sufferings think o'erpaid to see The crowds applause with virtue once agree. Success charms all, but zeal for worth distrest, A virtue proper to the brave and best; 'Mongst whom was Jothran, Jothran always bent To serve the crown, and loyal by descent; Whose constancy so firm, and conduct just, Deserved at once two royal masters' trust; Who Tyre's proud arms had manfully withstood On seas, and gathered laurels from the flood; Of learning yet no portion was denied, Friend to the muses, and the muses' pride. Nor can Benaiah's worth forgotten lie, Of steady soul when public storms were high; Whose conduct while the Moor fierce onsets made, Secured at once our honour and our trade. Such were the chiefs who most his sufferings mourned, And viewed with silent joy the prince returned; While those, that sought his absence to betray, Press first, their nauseous false respects to pay; Him still the officious hypocrites molest, And with malicious duty break his rest. While real transports thus his friends employ, And foes are loud in their dissembled joy, His triumphs, so resounded far and near, Missed not his young ambitious rival's ear; And as, when joyful hunters' clamorous train Some slumbering lion wakes in Moab's plain, Who oft had forced the bold assailants yield, And scattered his pursuers through the field, Disdaining, furls his mane, and tears the ground, His eyes inflaming all the desert round, With roar of seas directs his chasers' way, Provokes from far, and dares them to the fray; Such rage stormed now in Absalom's fierce breast, Such indignation his fired eyes confessed. Where now was the instructor of his pride? Slept the old pilot in so rough a tide, Whose wiles had from the happy shore betrayed, And thus on shelves the credulous youth conveyed? In deep revolving thoughts he weighs his state, Secure of craft, nor doubts to baffle fate; At least, if his stormed bark must go adrift, To balk his charge, and for himself to shift, In which his dext'rous wit had oft been shown, And in the wreck of kingdoms saved his own; But now with more than common danger pressed, Of various resolutions stands possessed, Perceives the crowd's unstable zeal decay, Lest their recanting chief the cause betray, Who on a father's grace his hopes may ground, And for his pardon with their heads compound. Him therefore, e'er his fortune slip her time, The statesman plots to engage in some bold crime Past pardon; whether to attempt his bed, Or threat with open arms the royal head, Or other daring method, and unjust, That may confirm him in the people's trust. But, failing thus to ensnare him, not secure How long his foiled ambition may endure, Plots next to lay him by as past his date, And try some new pretender's luckier fate; Whose hopes with equal toil he would pursue, Nor cares what claimer's crowned, except the true. Wake, Absalom, approaching ruin shun, And see, O see, for whom thou art undone! How are thy honours and thy fame betrayed, The property of desperate villains made! Lost power and conscious fears their crimes create, And guilt in them was little less than fate; But why shouldst thou, from every grievance free, Forsake thy vineyards for their stormy sea? For thee did Canaan's milk and honey flow, Love dressed thy bowers, and laurels sought thy brow; Preferment, wealth, and power, thy vassals were, And of a monarch all things but the care. Oh, should our crimes again that curse draw down, And rebel arms once more attempt the crown, Sure ruin waits unhappy Absalon, Alike by conquest or defeat undone. Who could relentless see such youth and charms, Expire, with wretched fate, in impious arms? A prince so formed, with earth's and heaven's applause, To triumph o'er crowned heads in David's cause. Or, grant him victor, still his hopes must fail, Who, conquering, would not for himself prevail; The faction, whom he trusts for future sway, Him and the public would alike betray; Amongst themselves divide the captive state, And found their hydra-empire in his fate. Thus having beat the clouds with painful flight, The pitied youth, with sceptres in his sight, (So have their cruel politics decreed), Must by that crew, that made him guilty, bleed! For, could their pride brook any prince's sway, Whom, but mild David, would they choose to obey? Who once at such a gentle reign repine, The fall of monarchy itself design; From hate to that their reformations spring, And David not their grievance, but the king. Seized now with panic fear the faction lies, Lest this clear truth strike Absalom's charmed eyes; Lest he perceive, from long enchantment free, What all, beside the flattered youth, must see. But whate'er doubts his troubled bosom swell, Fair carriage still became Achitophel; Who now an envious festival installs, And to survey their strength the faction calls, Which fraud, religious worship too, must gild; But oh how weakly does sedition build! For, lo! the royal mandate issues forth, Dashing at once their treason, zeal, and mirth.— So have I seen disastrous chance invade, Where careful emmets had their forage laid; Whether fierce Vulcan's rage the furzy plain Had seized, engendered by some careless swain; Or swelling Neptune lawless inroads made, And to their cell of store his flood conveyed; The commonwealth, broke up, distracted go, And, in wild haste, their loaded mates o'erthrow: Even so our scattered guests confusedly meet, With boiled, baked, roast, all justling in the street; Dejected all, and ruefully dismayed, For shekel, without treat or treason, paid. Sedition's dark eclipse now fainter shows, More bright each hour the royal planet grows, Of force the clouds of envy to disperse, In kind conjunction of assisting stars. Here, labouring muse! those glorious chiefs relate, That turned the doubtful scale of David's fate; The rest of that illustrious band rehearse, Immortalised in laurelled Asaph's verse: Hard task! yet will not I thy flight recall; View heaven, and then enjoy thy glorious fall. First write Bezaliel, whose illustrious name Forestalls our praise, and gives his poet fame. The Kenites' rocky province his command, A barren limb of fertile Canaan's land; Which, for its generous natives, yet could be Held worthy such a president as he. Bezaliel with each grace and virtue fraught, Serene his looks, serene his life and thought; On whom so largely nature heaped her store, There scarce remained for arts to give him more. To aid the crown and state his greatest zeal, His second care, that service to conceal; Of dues observant, firm to every trust, And to the needy always more than just; Who truth from specious falsehood can divide, Has all the gownsmen's skill without their pride; Thus crowned with worth, from heights of honour won, Sees all his glories copied in his son, Whose forward fame should every muse engage, Whose youth boasts skill denied to others' age. Men, manners, language, books of noblest kind, Already are the conquest of his mind; Whose loyalty, before its date, was prime, Nor waited the dull course of rolling time; The monster faction early he dismayed, And David's cause long since confessed his aid. Brave Abdael o'er the prophet's school was placed; Abdael, with all his father's virtue graced; A hero who, while stars looked wondering down, Without one Hebrew's blood restored the crown. That praise was his; what therefore did remain For following chiefs, but boldly to maintain That crown restored? and in this rank of fame, Brave Abdael with the first a place must claim. Proceed, illustrious, happy chief, proceed! Fore-seize the garlands for thy brow decreed; While the inspired tribe attend with noblest strain, To register the glories thou shalt gain: For sure the dew shall Gilboa's hills forsake, And Jordan mix his stream with Sodom's lake; Or seas retired their secret stores disclose, And to the sun their scaly brood expose; Or, swelled above the cliffs, their billows raise, Before the muses leave their patron's praise. Eliab our next labour does invite, And hard the task to do Eliab right. Long with the royal wanderer he roved, And firm in all the turns of fortune proved. Such ancient service, and desert so large, Well claimed the royal household for his charge. His age with only one mild heiress blessed, In all the bloom of smiling nature dressed; And blessed again to see his flower allied To David's stock, and made young Othniel's bride. The bright restorer of his father's youth, Devoted to a son's and subject's truth: Resolved to bear that prize of duty home, So bravely sought, while sought by Absalom. Ah, prince! the illustrious planet of thy birth, And thy more powerful virtue, guard thy worth, That no Achitophel thy ruin boast! Israel too much in one such wreck has lost. Even envy must consent to Helon's worth; Whose soul, though Egypt glories in his birth, Could for our captive ark its zeal retain, And Pharaoh's altars in their pomp disdain; To slight his gods was small; with nobler pride, He all the allurements of his court defied. Whom profit nor example could betray, But Israel's friend, and true to David's sway. What acts of favour in his province fall, On merit he confers, and freely all. Our list of nobles next let Amri grace, Whose merits claimed the Abethdin's high place; Who, with a loyalty that did excel, Brought all the endowments of Achitophel. Sincere was Amri, and not only knew, But Israel's sanctions into practice drew; Our laws, that did a boundless ocean seem, Were coasted all, and fathomed all by him. No rabbin speaks like him their mystic sense, So just, and with such charms of eloquence; To whom the double blessing does belong, With Moses' inspiration, Aaron's tongue. Than Sheva none more loyal zeal have shown, Wakeful as Judah's lion for the crown; Who for that cause still combats in his age, For which his youth with danger did engage. In vain our factious priests the cant revive; In vain seditious scribes with libel strive To inflame the crowd; while he, with watchful eye, Observes, and shoots their treasons as they fly: Their weekly frauds his keen replies detect; He undeceives more fast than they infect. So Moses, when the pest on legions preyed, Advanced his signal, and the plague was stayed. Once more, my fainting muse, thy pinions try, And strength's exhausted store let love supply. What tribute, Asaph, shall we render thee? We'll crown thee with a wreath from thy own tree! Thy laurel-grove no envy's flash can blast; The song of Asaph shall for ever last. With wonder late posterity shall dwell On Absalom and false Achitophel: Thy strains shall be our slumbering prophets' dream, And when our Zion virgins sing their theme, Our jubilees shall with thy verse be graced; The song of Asaph shall for ever last. How fierce his satire, loosed; restrained, how tame; How tender of the offending young man's fame! How well his worth, and brave adventures styled; Just to his virtues, to his error mild! No page of thine that fears the strictest view, But teems with just reproof, or praise, as due; Not Eden could a fairer prospect yield, All paradise, without one barren field Whose wit the censure of his foes has past: The song of Asaph shall for ever last. What praise for such rich strains shall we allow? What just rewards the grateful crown bestow? While bees in flowers rejoice, and flowers in dew, While stars and fountains to their course are true, While Judah's throne, and Zion's rock stand fast, The song of Asaph, and the fame shall last. Still Hebron's honoured happy soil retains Our royal hero's beauteous dear remains; Who now sails off, with winds nor wishes slack, To bring his sufferings' bright companion back. But ere such transport can our sense employ, A bitter grief must poison half our joy; Nor can our coasts restored those blessings see Without a bribe to envious destiny! Cursed Sodom's doom for ever fix the tide, Where by inglorious chance, the valiant died. Give not insulting Askelon to know, Nor let Gath's daughters triumph in our woe! No sailor with the news swell Egypt's pride, By what inglorious fate our valiant died! Weep, Arnon! Jordan, weep thy fountains dry, While Zion's rock dissolves for a supply. Calm were the elements, night's silence deep, The waves scarce murmuring, and the winds asleep; Yet fate for ruin takes so still an hour, And treacherous sands the princely bark devour; Then death unworthy seized a generous race, To virtue's scandal, and the stars' disgrace! Oh, had the indulgent powers vouchsafed to yield, Instead of faithless shelves, a listed field; A listed field of heaven's and David's foes, Fierce as the troops that did his youth oppose, Each life had on his slaughtered heap retired, Not tamely and unconquering thus expired. But destiny is now their only foe, And, dying, even o'er that they triumph too; With loud last breaths their master's 'scape applaud, Of whom kind force could scarce the Fates defraud; Who, for such followers lost, O matchless mind! At his own safety now almost repined!— Say, royal Sir, by all your fame in arms, Your praise in peace, and by Urania's charms, If all your sufferings past so nearly prest, Or pierced with half so painful grief, your breast? Thus some diviner muse her hero forms, Not soothed with soft delights, but tossed in storms; Nor stretched on roses in the myrtle grove, Nor crown his days with mirth, his nights with love, But far removed in thundering camps is found, His slumbers short, his bed the herbless ground; In tasks of danger always seen the first, Feeds from the hedge, and slakes with ice his thirst. Long must his patience strive with fortune's rage, And long opposing gods themselves engage; Must see his country flame, his friends destroyed, Before the promised empire he enjoyed: Such toil of fate must build a man of fame, And such, to Israel's crown, the godlike David came. What sudden beams dispel the clouds so fast, Whose drenching rains laid all our vineyards waste? The spring so far behind her course delayed, On the instant is in all her bloom arrayed; The winds breathe low, the element serene, Yet, mark! what motion in the waves is seen! Thronging and busy as Hyblæan swarms, Or straggled soldiers summoned to their arms. See where the princely bark in loosest pride, With all her guardian fleet adorns the tide! High on her deck the royal lovers stand, Our crimes to pardon e'er they touched our land. Welcome to Israel and to David's breast! Here all your toils, here all your sufferings rest. This year did Ziloah rule Jerusalem, And boldly all sedition's syrtes stem, Howe'er encumbered with a viler pair Than Ziph or Shimei, to assist the chair; Yet Ziloah's loyal labours so prevailed, That faction, at the next election failed; When even the common cry did justice sound, And merit by the multitude was crowned; With David then was Israel's peace restored, Crowds mourned their error, and obeyed their lord. THE MEDAL. A SATIRE AGAINST SEDITION. Per Graium populos, mediæque per Elidis urbem Ibat ovans; Divumque sibi poscebat honores. UPON THE AUTHOR OF THE FOLLOWING POEM. Once more our awful poet arms, to engage The threat'ning hydra-faction of the age; Once more prepares his dreadful pen to wield And every muse attends him to the field: By art and nature for this task designed, Yet modestly the fight he long declined; Forbore the torrent of his verse to pour, Nor loosed his satire till the needful hour: His sovereign's right, by patience half betrayed, Waked his avenging genius to its aid. Blest muse, whose wit with such a cause was crowned, And blest the cause that such a champion found; With chosen verse upon the foe he falls, And black sedition in each quarter galls; Yet, like a prince with subjects forced to engage, Secure of conquest, he rebates his rage; His fury not without distinction sheds, Hurls mortal bolts but on devoted heads: To less infected members gentle found, Or spares, or else pours balm into the wound. Such generous grace the ungrateful tribe abuse, And trespass on the mercy of his muse; Their wretched dogg'rel rhymers forth they bring, To snarl and bark against the poet's king: A crew that scandalise the nation more Than all their treason-canting priests before! On these he scarce vouchsafes a scornful smile, But on their powerful patrons turns his style: A style so keen, as even from faction draws The vital poison, stabs to the heart their cause. Take then, great bard, what tribute we can raise; Accept our thanks, for you transcend our praise. TO THE UNKNOWN AUTHOR OF THE FOLLOWING POEM, AND THAT OF ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL. Thus pious ignorance, with dubious praise, Altars of old, to gods unknown, did raise: They knew not the loved Deity, they knew Divine effects a cause divine did shew: Nor can we doubt, when such these numbers are, Such is their cause, though the worst muse shall dare Their sacred worth in humble verse declare. As gentle Thames, charmed with thy tuneful song, Glides in a peaceful majesty along; No rebel stone, no lofty bank, does brave The easy passage of his silent wave; So, sacred poet, so thy numbers flow, Sinewy, yet mild, as happy lovers woo; Strong, yet harmonious too, as planets move, Yet soft as down upon the wings of love. How sweet does virtue in your dress appear! How much more charming, when much less severe! Whilst you our senses harmlessly beguile, With all the allurements of your happy style; You insinuate loyalty with kind deceit, And into sense the unthinking many cheat: So the sweet Thracian, with his charming lyre, Into rude nature virtue did inspire; So he the savage herd to reason drew, Yet scarce so sweet, so charmingly, as you. Oh that you would, with some such powerful charm, Enervate Albion to just valour warm! Whether much-suffering Charles shall theme afford, Or the great deeds of godlike James's sword; Again fair Gallia might be ours, again Another fleet might pass the subject main; Another Edward lead the Britons on, Or such an Ossory as you did moan: While in such numbers you, in such a strain, Inflame their courage, and reward their pain. Let false Achitophel the rout engage, Talk easy Absalom to rebel rage; Let frugal Shimei curse in holy zeal, Or modest Corah more new plots reveal; Whilst constant to himself, secure of fate, Good David still maintains the royal state; Though each in vain such various ills employs, Firmly he stands, and even those ills enjoys; Firm as fair Albion 'midst the raging main, Surveys encircling danger with disdain. In vain the waves assault the unmoved shore, In vain the winds with mingled fury roar, Fair Albion's beauteous cliffs shine whiter than before. Nor shalt thou move, though hell thy fall conspire, Though the worse rage of zeal's fanatic fire, Thou best, thou greatest of the British race, Thou only fit to fill great Charles his place. Ah wretched Britons! ah too stubborn isle! Ah stiff-necked Israel on blest Canaan's soil! Are those dear proofs of heaven's indulgence vain, Restoring David and his gentle reign? Is it in vain thou all the goods dost know, Auspicious stars on mortals shed below, While all thy streams with milk, thy lands with honey flow? No more, fond isle! no more thyself engage, In civil fury, and intestine rage, No rebel zeal thy duteous land molest, But a smooth calm soothe ever peaceful breast, While in such charming notes divinely sings The best of poets, of the best of kings. THE MEDAL. Of all our antic sights and pageantry, Which English idiots run in crowds to see, The Polish Medal bears the prize alone; A monster, more the favourite of the town Than either fairs or theatres have shown. Never did art so well with nature strive, Nor ever idol seemed so much alive; So like the man, so golden to the sight, So base within, so counterfeit and light. One side is filled with title and with face; And, lest the king should want a regal place, On the reverse a Tower the town surveys, O'er which our mounting sun his beams displays. The word, pronounced aloud by shrieval voice, Lætamur, which, in Polish, is Rejoice; The day, month, year, to the great act are joined, And a new canting holiday designed; Five days he sat for every cast and look, Four more than God to finish Adam took. But who can tell what essence angels are? Or how long heaven was making Lucifer? Oh, could the style that copied every grace, And ploughed such furrows for an eunuch face, Could it have formed his ever-changing will, The various piece had tired the graver's skill! A martial hero first, with early care, Blown, like a pigmy by the winds, to war; A beardless chief, a rebel ere a man; So young his hatred to his prince began. Next this,—how wildly will ambition steer! A vermin wriggling in the usurper's ear; Bartering his venal wit for sums of gold, He cast himself into the saint-like mould; Groaned, sighed, and prayed, while godliness was gain, The loudest bagpipe of the squeaking train. But, as 'tis hard to cheat a juggler's eyes, His open lewdness he could ne'er disguise. There split the saint; for hypocritic zeal Allows no sins but those it can conceal: Whoring to scandal gives too large a scope; Saints must not trade, but they may interlope: The ungodly principle was all the same; But a gross cheat betrays his partner's game. Besides, their pace was formal, grave, and slack; His nimble wit outran the heavy pack; Yet still he found his fortune at a stay, Whole droves of blockheads choking up his way; They took, but not rewarded, his advice; Villain and wit exact a double price. Power was his aim; but thrown from that pretence, The wretch turned loyal in his own defence, And malice reconciled him to his prince. Him, in the anguish of his soul, he served; Rewarded faster still than he deserved. Behold him now exalted into trust; His counsel's oft convenient, seldom just; Even in the most sincere advice he gave, He had a grudging still to be a knave. The frauds, he learned in his fanatic years, Made him uneasy in his lawful gears; At best, as little honest as he could, And, like white witches, mischievously good; To his first bias longingly he leans, And rather would be great by wicked means. Thus framed for ill, he loosed our triple hold; Advice unsafe, precipitous, and bold. From hence those tears, that Ilium of our woe! Who helps a powerful friend, forearms a foe. What wonder if the waves prevail so far, When he cut down the banks that made the bar? Seas follow but their nature to invade; But he, by art, our native strength betrayed: So Samson to his foe his force confest, And, to be shorn, lay slumbering on her breast. But when this fatal counsel, found too late, Exposed its author to the public hate; When his just sovereign by no impious way Could be seduced to arbitrary sway; Forsaken of that hope, he shifts his sail, Drives down the current with a popular gale, And shows the fiend confessed without a veil. He preaches to the crowd, that power is lent, But not conveyed, to kingly government; That claims successive bear no binding force; That coronation oaths are things of course; Maintains the multitude can never err; And sets the people in the papal chair. The reason's obvious,—interest never lies; The most have still their interest in their eyes; The power is always theirs, and power is ever wise. Almighty crowd! thou shortenest all dispute; Power is thy essence, with thy attribute! Nor faith nor reason make thee at a stay; Thou leap'st o'er all eternal truths in thy pindaric way! Athens, no doubt, did righteously decide, When Phocion and when Socrates were tried; As righteously they did those dooms repent; Still they were wise, whatever way they went: Crowds err not, though to both extremes they run; To kill the father, and recall the son. Some think the fools were most as times went then, But now the world's o'erstocked with prudent men. The common cry is even religion's test,— The Turk's is at Constantinople best, Idols in India, Popery at Rome, And our own worship only true at home; And true but for the time, 'tis hard to know How long we please it shall continue so; This side to-day, and that to-morrow burns; So all are God-almighties in their turns. A tempting doctrine, plausible and new; What fools our fathers were, if this be true! Who, to destroy the seeds of civil war, Inherent right in monarchs did declare; And, that a lawful power might never cease, Secured succession to secure our peace. Thus property and sovereign sway at last In equal balances were justly cast; But this new Jehu spurs the hot-mouthed horse, Instructs the beast to know his native force, To take the bit between his teeth, and fly To the next headlong steep of anarchy. Too happy England, if our good we knew, Would we possess the freedom we pursue! The lavish government can give no more; Yet we repine, and plenty makes us poor. God tried us once; our rebel fathers fought; He glutted them with all the power they sought, Till, mastered by their own usurping brave, The free-born subject sunk into a slave. We loathe our manna, and we long for quails; Ah, what is man, when his own wish prevails! How rash, how swift to plunge himself in ill, Proud of his power, and boundless in his will! That kings can do no wrong, we must believe; None can they do, and must they all receive? Help, heaven! or sadly we shall see an hour, When neither wrong nor right are in their power! Already they have lost their best defence, The benefit of laws, which they dispense; No justice to their righteous cause allowed, But baffled by an arbitrary crowd; And medals graved their conquest to record, The stamp and coin of their adopted lord. The man, who laughed but once to see an ass Mumbling to make the cross-grained thistles pass, Might laugh again to see a jury chaw The prickles of unpalatable law. The witnesses, that leech-like lived on blood, Sucking for them were med'cinally good; But when they fastened on their festered sore, Then justice and religion they forswore; Their maiden oaths debauched into a whore. Thus men are raised by factions, and decried, And rogue and saint distinguished by their side; They rack even Scripture to confess their cause, And plead a call to preach in spite of laws. But that's no news to the poor injured page, It has been used as ill in every age; And is constrained with patience all to take, For what defence can Greek and Hebrew make? Happy, who can this talking trumpet seize; They make it speak whatever sense they please! 'Twas framed at first our oracle, to enquire; But since our sects in prophecy grow higher, The text inspires not them, but they the text inspire. London, thou great emporium of our isle, O thou too bounteous, thou too fruitful Nile! How shall I praise or curse to thy desert? Or separate thy sound from thy corrupted part? I called thee Nile; the parallel will stand; Thy tides of wealth o'erflow the fattened land; Yet monsters from thy large increase we find, Engendered on the slime thou leav'st behind. Sedition has not wholly seized on thee, Thy nobler parts are from infection free. Of Israel's tribes thou hast a numerous band, But still the Canaanite is in the land; Thy military chiefs are brave and true, Nor are thy disenchanted burghers few; The head is loyal which thy heart commands, But what's a head with two such gouty hands? The wise and wealthy love the surest way, And are content to thrive and to obey. But wisdom is to sloth too great a slave; None are so busy as the fool and knave. Those let me curse; what vengeance will they urge, Whose ordures neither plague nor fire can purge; Nor sharp experience can to duty bring, Nor angry heaven, nor a forgiving king! In gospel-phrase their chapmen they betray; Their shops are dens, the buyer is their prey: The knack of trades is living on the spoil; They boast even when each other they beguile. Customs to steal is such a trivial thing, That 'tis their charter to defraud their king. All hands unite of every jarring sect; They cheat the country first, and then infect. They for God's cause their monarchs dare dethrone, And they'll be sure to make his cause their own. Whether the plotting Jesuit laid the plan Of murdering kings, or the French Puritan, Our sacrilegious sects their guides outgo, And kings and kingly power would murder too. What means their traitorous combination less, Too plain to evade, too shameful to confess! But treason is not owned when 'tis descried; Successful crimes alone are justified. The men, who no conspiracy would find, Who doubts, but, had it taken, they had joined,— Joined in a mutual covenant of defence, At first without, at last against, their prince? If sovereign right by sovereign power they scan, The same bold maxim holds in God and man: God were not safe, his thunder could they shun, He should be forced to crown another son. Thus, when the heir was from the vineyard thrown, The rich possession was the murderers' own. In vain to sophistry they have recourse; By proving theirs no plot, they prove 'tis worse, Unmasked rebellion, and audacious force; Which, though not actual, yet all eyes may see, 'Tis working in the immediate power to be; For from pretended grievances they rise, First to dislike, and after to despise; Then, cyclop-like, in human flesh to deal, Chop up a minister at every meal; Perhaps not wholly to melt down the king, But clip his regal rights within the ring. From thence to assume the power of peace and war, And ease him, by degrees, of public care: Yet, to consult his dignity and fame, He should have leave to exercise the name, And hold the cards while commons played the game. For what can power give more than food and drink, To live at ease, and not be bound to think? These are the cooler methods of their crime, But their hot zealots think 'tis loss of time; On utmost bounds of loyalty they stand, And grin and whet like a Croatian band, That waits impatient for the last command. Thus outlaws open villainy maintain; They steal not, but in squadrons scour the plain; And if their power the passengers subdue, The most have right, the wrong is in the few. Such impious axioms foolishly they show, For in some soils republics will not grow: Our temperate isle will no extremes sustain Of popular sway, or arbitrary reign; But slides between them both into the best, Secure in freedom, in a monarch blest; And though the climate, vexed with various winds, Works through our yielding bodies on our minds, The wholesome tempest purges what it breeds, To recommend the calmness that succeeds. But thou, the pander of the people's hearts, O crooked soul, and serpentine in arts, Whose blandishments a loyal land have whored, And broke the bonds she plighted to her lord; What curses on thy blasted name will fall, Which age to age their legacy shall call! For all must curse the woes that must descend on all. Religion thou hast none: thy mercury Has passed through every sect, or theirs through thee. But what thou givest, that venom still remains, And the poxed nation feels thee in their brains. What else inspires the tongues, and swells the breasts, Of all thy bellowing renegado priests, That preach up thee for God, dispense thy laws, And with thy stum ferment their fainting cause; Fresh fumes of madness raise, and toil and sweat, To make the formidable cripple great? Yet should thy crimes succeed, should lawless power Compass those ends thy greedy hopes devour, Thy canting friends thy mortal foes would be, Thy God and theirs will never long agree; For thine, if thou hast any, must be one, That lets the world and humankind alone; A jolly god, that passes hours too well, To promise heaven, or threaten us with hell; That unconcerned can at rebellion sit, And wink at crimes he did himself commit. A tyrant theirs; the heaven their priesthood paints A conventicle of gloomy, sullen saints; A heaven, like Bedlam, slovenly and sad, Fore-doomed for souls with false religion mad. Without a vision, poets can foreshow What all but fools, by common sense, may know: If true succession from our isle should fail, And crowds profane, with impious arms, prevail, Not thou, nor those thy factious arts engage, Shall reap that harvest of rebellious rage, With which thou flatterest thy decrepit age. The swelling poison of the several sects, Which, wanting vent, the nation's health infects, Shall burst its bag, and, fighting out their way, The various venoms on each other prey. The presbyter, puffed up with spiritual pride, Shall on the necks of the lewd nobles ride; His brethren damn, the civil power defy, And parcel out republic prelacy. But short shall be his reign; his rigid yoke, And tyrant power, will puny sects provoke; And frogs and toads, and all the tadpole train, Will croak to heaven for help from this devouring crane. The cut-throat sword and clamorous gown shall jar, In sharing their ill-gotten spoils of war; Chiefs shall be grudged the part which they pretend; Lords envy lords, and friends with every friend About their impious merit shall contend. The surly commons shall respect deny, And jostle peerage out with property. Their general either shall his trust betray, And force the crowd to arbitrary sway; Or they, suspecting his ambitious aim, In hate of kings shall cast anew the frame, And thrust out Collatine, that bore their name. Thus, inborn broils the factions would engage, Or wars of exiled heirs, or foreign rage, Till halting vengeance overtook our age; And our wild labours, wearied into rest, Reclined us on a rightful monarch's breast. ?

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. X. RELIGIO LAICI; OR, A LAYMAN'S FAITH. AN EPISTLE. ON MR. DRYDEN'S RELIGIO LAICI. Begone, you slaves, you idle vermin, go, Fly from the scourges, and your master know; Let free, impartial men from Dryden learn Mysterious secrets of high concern, And weighty truths, solid convincing sense, Explained by unaffected eloquence. What can you, Reverend Levi, here take ill? Men still had faults, and men will have them still; He that hath none, and lives as angels do, Must be an angel;—but what's that to you? While mighty Lewis finds the Pope too great, And dreads the yoke of his imposing seat, Our sects a more tyrannic power assume, And would for scorpions change the rods of Rome. That Church detained the legacy divine; Fanatics cast the pearls of heaven to swine: What, then, have honest thinking men to do, But choose a mean between the usurping two? Nor can the Egyptian patriarch blame a muse, Which for his firmness does his heat excuse; Whatever counsels have approved his creed, The preface, sure, was his own act and deed. Our Church will have the preface read, you'll say: 'Tis true, but so she will the Apocrypha; And such as can believe them freely may But did that God, so little understood, Whose darling attribute is being good, From the dark womb of the rude chaos bring Such various creatures, and make man their king, Yet leave his favourite, man, his chiefest care, More wretched than the vilest insects are? O! how much happier and more safe are they, If helpless millions must be doom'd a prey To yelling furies, and for ever burn In that sad place, from whence is no return, For unbelief in one they never knew, Or for not doing what they could not do! The very fiends know for what crime they fell, And so do all their followers that rebel; If then a blind, well-meaning Indian stray, Shall the great gulf be showed him for the way? For better ends our kind Redeemer died, Or the fallen angels' rooms will be but ill supplied. That Christ, who at the great deciding day, (For he declares what he resolves to say), Will damn the goats for their ill-natured faults, And save the sheep for actions, not for thoughts, Hath too much mercy to send them to hell, For humble charity, and hoping well. To what stupidity are zealots grown, Whose inhumanity, profusely shown In damning crowds of souls, may damn their own! I'll err, at least, on the securer side, A convert free from malice and from pride. Roscommon. TO MR. DRYDEN, ON HIS POEM CALLED RELIGIO LAICI. Great is the task, and worthy such a muse, To do faith right, yet reason disabuse. How cheerfully the soul does take its flight On faith's strong wings, guided by reason's light! But reason does in vain her beams display, Showing to th'place, whence first she came, the way, If Peter's heirs must still hold fast the key. The house, which many mansions should contain, Formed by the great wise Architect in vain, Of disproportion justly we accuse, If the strait gate still entrance must refuse. The only free enriching port God made, What shameful monopoly did invade? One factious company engrossed the trade. Thou to the distant shore hast safely sailed, Where the best pilots have so often failed. Freely we now may buy the pearl of price; The happy land abounds with fragrant spice, And nothing is forbidden there but vice. Thou best Columbus to the unknown world! Mountains of doubt, that in thy way were hurled, Thy generous faith has bravely overcome, And made heaven truly our familiar home. Let crowds impossibilities receive; Who cannot think, ought not to disbelieve. Let them pay tithes, and hoodwinked go to heaven: But sure the quaker could not be forgiven, Had not the clerk. who hates lay-policy, Found out, to countervail the injury, Swearing, a trade of which they are not free. Too long has captive reason been enslaved, By visions scared, and airy phantasms braved, List'ning to each proud enthusiastic fool, Pretending conscience, but designing rule; Whilst law, form, interest, ignorance, design, Did in the holy cheat together join. Like vain astrologers, gazing on the skies, We fall, and did not dare to trust our eyes. 'Tis time at last to fix the trembling soul, And by thy compass to point out the pole; All men agree in what is to be done, And each man's heart his table is of stone, Where he, the god-writ character may view; Were it as needful, faith had been so too. Oh, that our greatest fault were humble doubt, And that we were more just, though less devout! What reverence should we pay thy sacred rhymes, Who, in these factious too-believing times, Has taught us to obey, and to distrust; Yet, to ourselves, our king, and God, prove just. Thou want'st not praise from an insuring friend; The poor to thee on double interest lend. So strong thy reasons, and so clear thy sense, They bring, like day, their own bright evidence; Yet, whilst mysterious truths to light you bring, And heavenly things in heavenly numbers sing, The joyful younger choir may clap the wing. TO MR. DRYDEN, ON RELIGIO LAICI. 'Tis nobly done, a layman's creed profest, When all our faith of late hung on a priest; His doubtful words, like oracles received, And, when we could not understand, believed. Triumphant faith now takes a nobler course, 'Tis gentle, but resists intruding force. Weak reason may pretend an awful sway, And consistories charge her to obey; (Strange nonsense, to confine the sacred Dove, And narrow rules prescribe how he shall love, And how upon the barren waters move). But she rejects and scorns their proud pretence, And, whilst those grov'ling things depend on sense, She mounts on certain wings, and flies on high, And looks upon a dazzling mystery, With fixed, and steady, and an eagle's eye. Great king of verse, that dost instruct and please, As Orpheus softened the rude savages; And gently freest us from a double care, The bold Socinian, and the Papal chair: Thy judgment is correct, thy fancy young, Thy numbers, as thy generous faith, are strong: Whilst through dark prejudice they force their way, Our souls shake off the night, and view the day. We live secure from mad enthusiasts' rage, And fond tradition, now grown blind with age. Let factious and ambitious souls repine, Thy reason's strong, and generous thy design; And always to do well is only thine. Tho. Creech. RELIGIO LAICI. Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta doceri. Dim as the borrowed beams of moon and stars To lonely, weary, wandering travellers, Is reason to the soul: and as, on high, Those rolling fires discover but the sky, Not light us here; so reason's glimmering ray Was lent, not to assure our doubtful way, But guide us upward to a better day. And as those nightly tapers disappear, When day's bright lord ascends our hemisphere; So pale grows reason at religion's sight, So dies, and so dissolves in supernatural light. Some few, whose lamp shone brighter, have been led From cause to cause, to nature's secret head, And found that one First Principle must be: But what, or who, that universal He; Whether some soul encompassing this ball, Unmade, unmoved; yet making, moving all; Or various atoms' interfering dance Leaped into form, the noble work of chance; Or this great all was from eternity,— Not even the Stagyrite himself could see, And Epicurus guessed as well as he. As blindly groped they for a future state, As rashly judged of providence and fate; But least of all could their endeavours find Opinions of the several sects of Philosophers concerning the Summum Bonum. What most concerned the good of human kind; For happiness was never to be found, But vanished from them like enchanted ground. One thought content the good to be enjoyed; This every little accident destroyed: The wiser madmen did for virtue toil, A thorny, or, at best, a barren soil: In pleasure some their glutton souls would steep; But found their line too short, the well too deep, And leaky vessels which no bliss could keep. Thus anxious thoughts in endless circles roll, Without a centre where to fix the soul: In this wild maze their vain endeavours end:— How can the less the greater comprehend? Or finite reason reach infinity? For what could fathom God were more than he. The Deist thinks he stands on firmer ground; System of Deism. Cries ??????! the mighty secret's found: God is that spring of good, supreme and best, We made to serve, and in that service blest; If so, some rules of worship must be given, Distributed alike to all by heaven; Else God were partial, and to some denied The means his justice should for all provide. This general worship is to praise and pray; One part to borrow blessings, one to pay; And when frail nature slides into offence, The sacrifice for crimes is penitence. Yet since the effects of providence, we find, Are variously dispensed to human kind; That vice triumphs, and virtue suffers here, A brand that sovereign justice cannot bear; Our reason prompts us to a future state, The last appeal from fortune and from fate, Where God's all righteous ways will be declared; The bad meet punishment, the good reward. Of revealed religion.Thus man by his own strength to heaven would soar, And would not be obliged to God for more. Vain wretched creature, how art thou misled, To think thy wit these god-like notions bred! These truths are not the product of thy mind, But dropt from heaven, and of a nobler kind. Revealed religion first informed thy sight, And reason saw not till faith sprung the light. Hence all thy natural worship takes the source; 'Tis revelation what thou think'st discourse. Else how com'st thou to see these truths so clear, Which so obscure to heathens did appear? Not Plato these, nor Aristotle found, Socrates.Nor he whose wisdom oracles renowned. Hast thou a wit so deep, or so sublime, Or canst thou lower dive, or higher climb? Canst thou by reason more of godhead know Than Plutarch, Seneca, or Cicero? Those giant wits, in happier ages born, When arms and arts did Greece and Rome adorn, Knew no such system; no such piles could raise Of natural worship, built on prayer and praise To one sole God; Nor did remorse to expiate sin prescribe, But slew their fellow-creatures for a bribe: The guiltless victim groaned for their offence, And cruelty and blood was penitence. If sheep and oxen could atone for men, Ah! at how cheap a rate the rich might sin! And great oppressors might heaven's wrath beguile, By offering his own creatures for a spoil! Darest thou, poor worm, offend Infinity? And must the terms of peace be given by thee? Then thou art justice in the last appeal; Thy easy God instructs thee to rebel; And, like a king remote and weak, must take What satisfaction thou art pleased to make. But if there be a Power too just and strong, To wink at crimes, and bear unpunished wrong; Look humbly upward, see his will disclose The forfeit first, and then the fine impose; A mulct thy poverty could never pay, Had not Eternal Wisdom found the way, And with celestial wealth supplied thy store; His justice makes the fine, his mercy quits the score. See God descending in thy human frame; The offended suffering in the offender's name; All thy misdeeds to him imputed see, And all his righteousness devolved on thee. For, granting we have sinned, and that the offence Of man is made against Omnipotence, Some price that bears proportion must be paid, And infinite with infinite be weighed. See then the Deist lost: remorse for vice Not paid, or paid inadequate in price: What further means can reason now direct, Or what relief from human wit expect? That shows us sick; and sadly are we sure Still to be sick, till heaven reveal the cure: If then heaven's will must needs be understood, Which must, if we want cure, and heaven be good, Let all records of will revealed be shown; With scripture all in equal balance thrown, And our one sacred Book will be that one. Proof needs not here; for, whether we compare That impious, idle, superstitious ware Of rites, lustrations, offerings, which before, In various ages, various countries bore, With Christian faith and virtues, we shall find None answering the great ends of human kind, But this one rule of life; that shows us best How God may be appeased, and mortals blest. Whether from length of time its worth we draw, The world is scarce more ancient than the law: Heaven's early care prescribed for every age; First, in the soul, and after, in the page. Or, whether more abstractedly we look, Or on the writers, or the written book, Whence, but from heaven, could men unskilled in arts, In several ages born, in several parts, Weave such agreeing truths? or how, or why Should all conspire to cheat us with a lie? Unasked their pains, ungrateful their advice, Starving their gain, and martyrdom their price. If on the book itself we cast our view, Concurrent heathens prove the story true: The doctrine, miracles; which must convince, For heaven in them appeals to human sense; And, though they prove not, they confirm the cause, When what is taught agrees with nature's laws. Then for the style, majestic and divine, It speaks no less than God in every line; Commanding words, whose force is still the same As the first fiat that produced our frame. All faiths, beside, or did by arms ascend, Or sense indulged has made mankind their friend; This only doctrine does our lusts oppose, Unfed by nature's soil, in which it grows; Cross to our interests, curbing sense, and sin; Oppressed without, and undermined within, It thrives through pain; its own tormentors tires, And with a stubborn patience still aspires. To what can reason such effects assign, Transcending nature, but to laws divine? Which in that sacred volume are contained, Sufficient, clear, and for that use ordained. But stay: the Deist here will urge anew, Objection of the Deist. No supernatural worship can be true; Because a general law is that alone Which must to all, and every where, be known; A style so large as not this book can claim, Nor aught that bears revealed religion's name. 'Tis said, the sound of a Messiah's birth Is gone through all the habitable earth; But still that text must be confined alone To what was then inhabited, and known: And what provision could from thence accrue To Indian souls, and worlds discovered new? In other parts it helps, that, ages past, The scriptures there were known, and were embraced, Till sin spread once again the shades of night: What's that to these who never saw the light? The objection answered.Of all objections this indeed is chief, To startle reason, stagger frail belief: We grant, 'tis true, that heaven from human sense Has hid the secret paths of providence; But boundless wisdom, boundless mercy, may Find even for those bewildered souls a way. If from his nature foes may pity claim, Much more may strangers, who ne'er heard his name; And, though no name be for salvation known, But that of his eternal Son's alone; Who knows how far transcending goodness can Extend the merits of that son to man? Who knows what reasons may his mercy lead, Or ignorance invincible may plead? Not only charity bids hope the best, But more the great apostle has exprest: That, if the Gentiles, whom no law inspired, By nature did what was by law required; They, who the written rule had never known, Were to themselves both rule and law alone; To nature's plain indictment they shall plead, And by their conscience be condemned or freed. Most righteous doom! because a rule revealed Is none to those from whom it was concealed. Then those, who followed reason's dictates right, Lived up, and lifted high their natural light, With Socrates may see their Maker's face, While thousand rubric-martyrs want a place. Nor does it baulk my charity, to find The Egyptian bishop of another mind; For, though his creed eternal truth contains, 'Tis hard for man to doom to endless pains All, who believed not all his zeal required; Unless he first could prove he was inspired. Then let us either think he meant to say, This faith, where published, was the only way; Or else conclude, that, Arius to confute, The good old man, too eager in dispute, Flew high; and, as his Christian fury rose, Damned all for heretics who durst oppose. Thus far my charity this path has tried; Digression to the Translator of Father Simon's Critical History of the Old Testament. A much unskilful, but well-meaning guide: Yet what they are, even these crude thoughts were bred By reading that which better thou hast read; Thy matchless author's work, which thou, my friend, By well translating better dost commend; Those youthful hours which, of thy equals, most In toys have squandered, or in vice have lost, Those hours hast thou to nobler use employed, And the severe delights of truth enjoyed. Witness this weighty book, in which appears The crabbed toil of many thoughtful years, Spent by thy author, in the sifting care Of rabbins' old sophisticated ware From gold divine; which he who well can sort May afterwards make algebra a sport; A treasure which, if country-curates buy, They Junius and Tremellius may defy; Save pains in various readings and translations, And without Hebrew make most learned quotations; A work so full with various learning fraught, So nicely pondered, yet so strongly wrought, As nature's height and art's last hand required; As much as man could compass, uninspired; Where we may see what errors have been made Both in the copiers' and translators' trade; How Jewish, Popish, interests have prevailed, And where infallibility has failed. For some, who have his secret meaning guessed, Have found our author not too much a priest; For fashion-sake he seems to have recourse To Pope, and councils, and traditions' force; But he that old traditions could subdue, Could not but find the weakness of the new: If scripture, though derived from heavenly birth, Has been but carelessly preserved on earth; If God's own people, who of God before Knew what we know, and had been promised more, In fuller terms, of heaven's assisting care, And who did neither time nor study spare To keep this book untainted, unperplext, Let in gross errors to corrupt the text, Omitted paragraphs, embroiled the sense, With vain traditions stopped the gaping fence, Which every common hand pulled up with ease,— What safety from such brushwood-helps as these? If written words from time are not secured, How can we think have oral sounds endured? Which thus transmitted, if one mouth has failed, Immortal lies on ages are entailed; And that some such have been, is proved too plain, If we consider interest, church, and gain. Of the infallibility of Tradition in general.O but, says one, tradition set aside, Where can we hope for an unerring guide? For, since the original scripture has been lost, All copies disagreeing, maimed the most, Or Christian faith can have no certain ground, Or truth in church-tradition must be found. Such an omniscient church we wish indeed; 'Twere worth both Testaments, and cast in the Creed: But if this mother be a guide so sure, As can all doubts resolve, all truth secure, Then her infallibility as well Where copies are corrupt or lame can tell; Restore lost canons with as little pains, As truly explicate what still remains; Which yet no council dare pretend to do, Unless, like Esdras, they could write it new; Strange confidence still to interpret true, Yet not be sure that all they have explained Is in the blest original contained. More safe, and much more modest 'tis, to say God would not leave mankind without a way; And that the scriptures, though not everywhere Free from corruption, or entire, or clear, Are uncorrupt, sufficient, clear, entire, In all things which our needful faith require. If others in the same glass better see, 'Tis for themselves they look, but not for me; For my salvation must its doom receive, Not from what others, but what I believe. Must all tradition then be set aside? Objection in behalf of Tradition urged by Father Simon. This to affirm were ignorance or pride. Are there not many points, some needful sure To saving faith, that scripture leaves obscure? Which every sect will wrest a several way, For what one sect interprets, all sects may; We hold, and say we prove from scripture plain, That Christ is God; the bold Socinian From the same scripture urges he's but man. Now what appeal can end the important suit? Both parts talk loudly, but the rule is mute. Shall I speak plain, and, in a nation free, Assume an honest layman's liberty? I think, according to my little skill, To my own mother-church submitting still, That many have been saved, and many may, Who never heard this question brought in play. The unlettered Christian, who believes in gross, Plods on to heaven, and ne'er is at a loss; For the strait gate would be made straiter yet, Were none admitted there but men of wit. The few by nature formed, with learning fraught, Born to instruct, as others to be taught, Must study well the sacred page; and see Which doctrine, this or that, does best agree With the whole tenor of the work divine, And plainliest points to heaven's revealed design; Which exposition flows from genuine sense, And which is forced by wit and eloquence, Not that tradition's parts are useless here, When general, old, disinteressed, and clear; That ancient fathers thus expound the page, Gives truth the reverend majesty of age; Confirms its force by biding every test; For best authorities, next rules, are best; And still the nearer to the spring we go, More limpid, more unsoiled, the waters flow. Thus, first, traditions were a proof alone; Could we be certain, such they were, so known; But since some flaws in long descent may be, They make not truth, but probability. Even Arius and Pelagius durst provoke To what the centuries preceding spoke: Such difference is there in an oft-told tale; But truth by its own sinews will prevail. Tradition written, therefore, more commends Authority, than what from voice descends; And this, as perfect as its kind can be, Rolls down to us the sacred history; Which from the universal Church received, Is tried, and, after, for itself believed. The partial Papists would infer from hence, The second objection. Their Church, in last resort, should judge the sense. But first they would assume, with wondrous art, Answer to the objection. Themselves to be the whole, who are but part Of that vast frame, the Church; yet grant they were The handers down, can they from thence infer A right to interpret? or, would they alone, Who brought the present, claim it for their own? The book's a common largess to mankind, Not more for them than every man designed; The welcome news is in the letter found; The carrier's not commissioned to expound. It speaks itself, and what it does contain, In all things needful to be known, is plain. In times o'ergrown with rust and ignorance, A gainful trade their clergy did advance; When want of learning kept the laymen low, And none but priests were authorised to know; When what small knowledge was, in them did dwell, And he a god, who could but read or spell,— Then mother Church did mightily prevail: She parcelled out the Bible by retail; But still expounded what she sold or gave, To keep it in her power to damn and save. Scripture was scarce, and, as the market went, Poor laymen took salvation on content, As needy men take money, good or bad. God's word they had not, but the priest's they had; Yet whate'er false conveyances they made, The lawyer still was certain to be paid. In those dark times they learned their knack so well, That by long use they grew infallible. At last, a knowing age began to inquire If they the book, or that did them inspire; And, making narrower search, they found, though late, That what they thought the priest's, was their estate; Taught by the will produced, the written word, How long they had been cheated on record. Then every man, who saw the title fair, Claimed a child's part, and put in for a share; Consulted soberly his private good, And saved himself as cheap as e'er he could. 'Tis true, my friend,—and far be flattery hence,— This good had full as bad a consequence; The book thus put in every vulgar hand, Which each presumed he best could understand, The common rule was made the common prey, And at the mercy of the rabble lay. The tender page with horny fists was galled, And he was gifted most, that loudest bawled; The Spirit gave the doctoral degree, And every member of a company Was of his trade and of the Bible free. Plain truths enough for needful use they found; But men would still be itching to expound; Each was ambitious of the obscurest place, No measure ta'en from knowledge, all from grace. Study and pains were now no more their care; Texts were explained by fasting and by prayer: This was the fruit the private spirit brought, Occasioned by great zeal and little thought. While crowds unlearned, with rude devotion warm, About the sacred viands buzz and swarm; The fly-blown text creates a crawling brood, And turns to maggots what was meant for food. A thousand daily sects rise up and die; A thousand more the perished race supply; So all we make of heaven's discovered will, Is not to have it, or to use it ill. The danger's much the same; on several shelves If others wreck us, or we wreck ourselves. What then remains, but, waving each extreme, The tides of ignorance and pride to stem; Neither so rich a treasure to forego, Nor proudly seek beyond our power to know? Faith is not built on disquisitions vain; The things we must believe are few and plain: But since men will believe more than they need, And every man will make himself a creed, In doubtful questions 'tis the safest way To learn what unsuspected ancients say; For 'tis not likely we should higher soar In search of heaven, than all the Church before; Nor can we be deceived, unless we see The scripture and the fathers disagree. If, after all, they stand suspected still, (For no man's faith depends upon his will) 'Tis some relief, that points, not clearly known, Without much hazard may be let alone; And, after hearing what our Church can say, If still our reason runs another way, That private reason 'tis more just to curb, Than by disputes the public peace disturb: For points obscure are of small use to learn; But common quiet is mankind's concern. Thus have I made my own opinions clear, Yet neither praise expect, nor censure fear; And this unpolished rugged verse I chose, As fittest for discourse, and nearest prose; For while from sacred truth I do not swerve, Tom Sternhold's, or Tom Shadwell's rhymes will serve. THRENODIA AUGUSTALIS: A FUNERAL PINDARIC POEM, SACRED TO THE HAPPY MEMORY OF KING CHARLES II. Fortunati ambo si quid mea carmina possunt, Nulla dies unquam memori vos eximet ævo! I. Thus long my grief has kept me dumb: Sure there's a lethargy in mighty woe, Tears stand congealed, and cannot flow; And the sad soul retires into her inmost room: Tears, for a stroke foreseen, afford relief; But, unprovided for a sudden blow, Like Niobe, we marble grow, And petrify with grief. Our British heaven was all serene, No threatening cloud was nigh, Not the least wrinkle to deform the sky; We lived as unconcerned and happily As the first age in nature's golden scene; Supine amidst our flowing store, We slept securely, and we dreamt of more; When suddenly the thunder-clap was heard, It took us, unprepared, and out of guard, Already lost before we feared. The amazing news of Charles at once were spread, At once the general voice declared, “Our gracious prince was dead.” No sickness known before, no slow disease, To soften grief by just degrees; But, like a hurricane on Indian seas, The tempest rose; An unexpected burst of woes. With scarce a breathing space betwixt, This now becalmed, and perishing the next. As if great Atlas from his height Should sink beneath his heavenly weight, And, with a mighty flaw, the flaming wall, As once it shall, Should gape immense, and, rushing down, o'erwhelm this nether ball; So swift and so surprising was our fear: Our Atlas fell indeed; but Hercules was near. II. His pious brother, sure the best Who ever bore that name, Was newly risen from his rest, And, with a fervent flame, His usual morning vows had just addressed, For his dear sovereign's health; And hoped to have them heard, In long increase of years, In honour, fame, and wealth: Guiltless of greatness, thus he always prayed, Nor knew nor wished those vows he made, On his own head should be repaid. Soon as the ill-omen'd rumour reached his ear, (Ill news is winged with fate, and flies apace), Who can describe the amazement in his face! Horror in all his pomp was there, Mute and magnificent, without a tear; And then the hero first was seen to fear. Half unarrayed he ran to his relief, So hasty and so artless was his grief: Approaching greatness met him with her charms Of power and future state; But looked so ghastly in a brother's fate, He shook her from his arms. Arrived within the mournful room, he saw A wild distraction, void of awe, And arbitrary grief unbounded by a law. God's image, God's anointed, lay Without motion, pulse, or breath, A senseless lump of sacred clay, An image now of death, Amidst his sad attendants' groans and cries, The lines of that adored forgiving face, Distorted from their native grace; An iron slumber sat on his majestic eyes. The pious duke—Forbear, audacious muse! No terms thy feeble art can use Are able to adorn so vast a woe: The grief of all the rest like subject-grief did show His, like a sovereign's, did transcend; No wife, no brother, such a grief could know, Nor any name but friend. III. O wondrous changes of a fatal scene, Still varying to the last! Heaven, though its hard decree was past, Seemed pointing to a gracious turn again: And death's uplifted arm arrested in its haste. Heaven half repented of the doom, And almost grieved it had foreseen, What by foresight it willed eternally to come. Mercy above did hourly plead For her resemblance here below; And mild forgiveness intercede To stop the coming blow. New miracles approached the ethereal throne, Such as his wondrous life had oft and lately known, And urged that still they might be shown. On earth his pious brother prayed and vowed, Renouncing greatness at so dear a rate, Himself defending what he could, From all the glories of his future fate. With him the innumerable crowd Of armed prayers Knocked at the gates of heaven, and knocked aloud; The first well-meaning rude petitioners. All for his life assailed the throne, All would have bribed the skies by offering up their own. So great a throng, not heaven itself could bar; 'Twas almost borne by force, as in the giants' war. The prayers, at least, for his reprieve were heard; His death, like Hezekiah's, was deferred: Against the sun the shadow went; Five days, those five degrees, were lent, To form our patience, and prepare the event. The second causes took the swift command, The medicinal head, the ready hand, All eager to perform their part; All but eternal doom was conquered by their art: Once more the fleeting soul came back To inspire the mortal frame; And in the body took a doubtful stand, Doubtful and hovering, like expiring flame, That mounts and falls by turns, and trembles o'er the brand. IV. The joyful short-lived news soon spread around, Took the same train, the same impetuous bound: The drooping town in smiles again was drest, Gladness in every face exprest, Their eyes before their tongues confest. Men met each other with erected look, The steps were higher that they took; Friends to congratulate their friends made haste, And long inveterate foes saluted as they passed. Above the rest heroic James appeared, Exalted more, because he more had feared. His manly heart, whose noble pride Was still above Dissembled hate, or varnished love, Its more than common transport could not hide; But like an eagre An eagre is a tide swelling above another tide, which I have myself observed in the river Trent. rode in triumph o'er the tide. Thus, in alternate course, The tyrant passions, hope and fear, Did in extremes appear, And flashed upon the soul with equal force. Thus, at half ebb, a rolling sea Returns, and wins upon the shore; The watery herd, affrighted at the roar, Rest on their fins awhile, and stay, Then backward take their wondering way: The prophet wonders more than they, At prodigies but rarely seen before, And cries,—“A king must fall, or kingdoms change their sway.” Such were our counter-tides at land, and so Presaging of the fatal blow, In their prodigious ebb and flow. The royal soul, that, like the labouring moon, By charms of art was hurried down, Forced with regret to leave her native sphere, Came but a while on liking here, Soon weary of the painful strife, And made but faint essays of life: An evening light Soon shut in night; A strong distemper, and a weak relief, Short intervals of joy, and long returns of grief. V. The sons of art all med'cines tried, And every noble remedy applied; With emulation each essayed His utmost skill; nay, more, they prayed: Never was losing game with better conduct played. Death never won a stake with greater toil, Nor e'er was fate so near a foil: But, like a fortress on a rock, The impregnable disease their vain attempts did mock; They mined it near, they battered from afar With all the cannon of the medicinal war; No gentle means could be essayed, 'Twas beyond parley when the siege was laid. The extremest ways they first ordain, Prescribing such intolerable pain, As none but Cæsar could sustain: Undaunted Cæsar underwent The malice of their art, nor bent Beneath whate'er their pious rigour could invent. In five such days he suffered more Than any suffered in his reign before; More, infinitely more, than he Against the worst of rebels could decree, A traitor, or twice pardoned enemy. Now art was tired without success, No racks could make the stubborn malady confess. The vain insurancers of life, And he who most performed, and promised less, Even Short himself, forsook the unequal strife. Death and despair was in their looks, No longer they consult their memories or books; Like helpless friends, who view from shore The labouring ship, and hear the tempest roar; So stood they with their arms across, Not to assist, but to deplore The inevitable loss. VI. Death was denounced; that frightful sound Which even the best can hardly bear; He took the summons void of fear, And unconcernedly cast his eyes around, As if to find and dare the grisly challenger. What death could do he lately tried, When in four days he more than died. The same assurance all his words did grace; The same majestic mildness held its place; Nor lost the monarch in his dying face. Intrepid, pious, merciful, and brave, He looked as when he conquered and forgave. VII. As if some angel had been sent To lengthen out his government, And to foretell as many years again, As he had numbered in his happy reign; So cheerfully he took the doom Of his departing breath, Nor shrunk nor stept aside for death; But, with unaltered pace, kept on, Providing for events to come, When he resigned the throne. Still he maintained his kingly state, And grew familiar with his fate. Kind, good, and gracious, to the last, On all he loved before his dying beams he cast: Oh truly good, and truly great, For glorious as he rose, benignly so he set! All that on earth he held most dear, He recommended to his care, To whom both heaven The right had given, And his own love bequeathed supreme command: He took and prest that ever-loyal hand, Which could, in peace, secure his reign; Which could, in wars, his power maintain; That hand on which no plighted vows were ever vain. Well, for so great a trust, he chose A prince, who never disobeyed; Not when the most severe commands were laid; Nor want, nor exile, with his duty weighed: A prince on whom, if heaven its eyes could close, The welfare of the world it safely might repose. VIII. That king, who lived to God's own heart, Yet less serenely died than he; Charles left behind no harsh decree, For schoolmen with laborious art, To salve from cruelty: Those, for whom love could no excuses frame, He graciously forgot to name. Thus far my muse, though rudely, has designed Some faint resemblance of his godlike mind; But neither pen nor pencil can express The parting brothers' tenderness; Though that's a term too mean and low; The blest above a kinder word may know: But what they did, and what they said, The monarch who triumphant went, The militant who staid, Like painters, when their heightening arts are spent, I cast into a shade. That all-forgiving king, The type of him above, That inexhausted spring Of clemency and love, Himself to his next self accused, And asked that pardon which he ne'er refused; For faults not his, for guilt and crimes Of godless men, and of rebellious times; For an hard exile, kindly meant, When his ungrateful country sent Their best Camillus into banishment, And forced their sovereign's act, they could not his consent. Oh how much rather had that injured chief Repeated all his sufferings past, Than hear a pardon begged at last, Which, given, could give the dying no relief! He bent, he sunk beneath his grief; His dauntless heart would fain have held From weeping, but his eyes rebelled. Perhaps the godlike hero, in his breast, Disdained, or was ashamed to show, So weak, so womanish a woe, Which yet the brother and the friend so plenteously confest. IX. Amidst that silent shower, the royal mind An easy passage found, And left its sacred earth behind; Nor murmuring groan expressed, nor labouring sound, Nor any least tumultuous breath; Calm was his life, and quiet was his death. Soft as those gentle whispers were, In which the Almighty did appear; By the still voice the prophet knew him there. That peace which made thy prosperous reign to shine, That peace thou leav'st to thy imperial line, That peace, Oh happy shade, be ever thine! X. For all those joys thy restoration brought, For all the miracles it wrought, For all the healing balm thy mercy poured Into the nation's bleeding wound, And care, that after kept it sound, For numerous blessings yearly showered, And property with plenty crowned; For freedom, still maintained alive, Freedom, which in no other land will thrive, Freedom, an English subject's sole prerogative, Without whose charms, even peace would be But a dull quiet slavery;— For these, and more, accept our pious praise; 'Tis all the subsidy The present age can raise, The rest is charged on late posterity. Posterity is charged the more, Because the large abounding store To them, and to their heirs, is still entailed by thee. Succession of a long descent, Which chastely in the channels ran, And from our demi-gods began, Equal almost to time in its extent, Through hazards numberless and great, Thou hast derived this mighty blessing down, And fixed the fairest gem that decks the imperial crown: Not faction, when it shook thy regal seat, Not senates, insolently loud, Those echoes of a thoughtless crowd, Not foreign or domestic treachery, Could warp thy soul to their unjust decree. So much thy foes thy manly mind mistook, Who judged it by the mildness of thy look; Like a well-tempered sword, it bent at will, But kept the native toughness of the steel. XI. Be true, O Clio, to thy hero's name; But draw him strictly so, That all who view the piece may know, He needs no trappings of fictitious fame. The load's too weighty; thou may'st choose Some parts of praise, and some refuse; Write, that his annals may be thought more lavish than the muse. In scanty truth thou hast confined The virtues of a royal mind, Forgiving, bounteous, humble, just, and kind: His conversation, wit, and parts, His knowledge in the noblest useful arts, Were such, dead authors could not give; But habitudes of those who live, Who, lighting him, did greater lights receive: He drained from all, and all they knew; His apprehension quick, his judgment true, That the most learned, with shame, confess His knowledge more, his reading only less. XII. Amidst the peaceful triumphs of his reign, What wonder, if the kingly beams he shed Revived the drooping arts again, If science raised her head, And soft humanity, that from rebellion fled. Our isle, indeed, too fruitful was before; But all uncultivated lay Out of the solar walk, and heaven's high way; With rank Geneva weeds run o'er, And cockle, at the best, amidst the corn it bore: The royal husbandman appeared, And ploughed, and sowed, and tilled; The thorns he rooted out, the rubbish cleared, And blest the obedient field. When straight a double harvest rose, Such as the swarthy Indian mows, Or happier climates near the Line, Or paradise manured, and drest by hands divine. XIII. As when the new-born phœnix takes his way, His rich paternal regions to survey, Of airy choristers a numerous train Attend his wondrous progress o'er the plain; So, rising from his father's urn, So glorious did our Charles return; The officious muses came along, A gay harmonious quire, like angels ever young; The muse, that mourns him now, his happy triumph sung. Even they could thrive in his auspicious reign; And such a plenteous crop they bore Of purest and well-winnowed grain, As Britain never knew before. Though little was their hire, and light their gain, Yet somewhat to their share he threw; Fed from his hand, they sung and flew, Like birds of paradise, that lived on morning dew. Oh never let their lays his name forget! The pension of a prince's praise is great. Live then, thou great encourager of arts, Live ever in our thankful hearts; Live blest above, almost invoked below; Live and receive this pious vow, Our patron once, our guardian angel now! Thou Fabius of a sinking state, Who didst by wise delays divert our fate, When faction like a tempest rose, In death's most hideous form, Then art to rage thou didst oppose, To weather out the storm; Not quitting thy supreme command, Thou heldst the rudder with a steady hand, Till safely on the shore the bark did land; The bark, that all our blessings brought, Charged with thyself and James, a doubly-royal fraught. XIV. Oh frail estate of human things, And slippery hopes below! Now to our cost your emptiness we know; For 'tis a lesson dearly bought, Assurance here is never to be sought. The best, and best beloved of kings, And best deserving to be so, When scarce he had escaped the fatal blow Of faction and conspiracy, Death did his promised hopes destroy; He toiled, he gained, but lived not to enjoy. What mists of Providence are these Through which we cannot see! So saints, by supernatural power set free, Are left at last in martyrdom to die; Such is the end of oft-repeated miracles.— Forgive me, heaven, that impious thought, 'Twas grief for Charles, to madness wrought, That questioned thy supreme decree! Thou didst his gracious reign prolong, Even in thy saints' and angels' wrong, His fellow-citizens of immortality: For twelve long years of exile borne, Twice twelve we numbered since his blest return: So strictly wert thou just to pay, Even to the driblet of a day. Yet still we murmur, and complain The quails and manna should no longer rain: Those miracles 'twas needless to renew; The chosen flock has now the promised land in view. XV. A warlike prince ascends the regal state, A prince long exercised by fate: Long may he keep, though he obtains it late! Heroes in heaven's peculiar mould are cast; They, and their poets, are not formed in haste; Man was the first in God's design, and man was made the last. False heroes, made by flattery so, Heaven can strike out, like sparkles, at a blow; But ere a prince is to perfection brought, He costs Omnipotence a second thought. With toil and sweat, With hardening cold, and forming heat, The Cyclops did their strokes repeat, Before the impenetrable shield was wrought. It looks as if the Maker would not own The noble work for his, Before 'twas tried and found a master-piece. XVI. View then a monarch ripened for a throne. Alcides thus his race began, O'er infancy he swiftly ran; The future god at first was more than man: Dangers and toils, and Juno's hate, Even o'er his cradle lay in wait, And there he grappled first with fate; In his young hands the hissing snakes he prest, So early was the Deity confest; Thus, by degrees, he rose to Jove's imperial seat; Thus difficulties prove a soul legitimately great. Like his, our hero's infancy was tried; Betimes the furies did their snakes provide, And to his infant arms oppose His father's rebels, and his brother's foes; The more opprest, the higher still he rose. Those were the preludes of his fate, That formed his manhood, to subdue The hydra of the many-headed hissing crew. XVII. As after Numa's peaceful reign, The martial Ancus did the sceptre wield, Furbished the rusty sword again, Resumed the long-forgotten shield, And led the Latins to the dusty field; So James the drowsy genius wakes Of Britain long entranced in charms, Restiff and slumbering on its arms; 'Tis roused, and, with a new-strung nerve, the spear already shakes. No neighing of the warrior steeds, No drum, or louder trumpet, needs To inspire the coward, warm the cold; His voice, his sole appearance, makes them bold. Gaul and Batavia dread the impending blow; Too well the vigour of that arm they know; They lick the dust, and crouch beneath their fatal foe. Long may they fear this awful prince, And not provoke his lingering sword; Peace is their only sure defence, Their best security his word. In all the changes of his doubtful state, His truth, like heaven's, was kept inviolate; For him to promise is to make it fate. His valour can triumph o'er land and main; With broken oaths his fame he will not stain; With conquest basely bought, and with inglorious gain. XVIII. For once, O heaven, unfold thy adamantine book; And let his wondering senate see, If not thy firm immutable decree, At least the second page of strong contingency, Such as consists with wills, originally free. Let them with glad amazement look On what their happiness may be; Let them not still be obstinately blind, Still to divert the good thou hast designed, Or, with malignant penury, To starve the royal virtues of his mind. Faith is a Christian's and a subject's test; Oh give them to believe, and they are surely blest. They do; and with a distant view I see The amended vows of English loyalty; And all beyond that object, there appears The long retinue of a prosperous reign, A series of successful years, In orderly array, a martial, manly train. Behold e'en the remoter shores, A conquering navy proudly spread; The British cannon formidably roars, While, starting from his oozy bed, The asserted Ocean rears his reverend head, To view and recognise his ancient lord again; And with a willing hand, restores The fasces of the main. THE HIND AND THE PANTHER, A POEM. IN THREE PARTS. ? Antiquam exquirite matrem ? ? Et vera incessu patuit Dea. Virg. [Part I.] A milk-white Hind, immortal and unchanged, Fed on the lawns, and in the forest ranged; Without unspotted, innocent within, She feared no danger, for she knew no sin. Yet had she oft been chased with horns and hounds, And Scythian shafts; and many winged wounds Aimed at her heart; was often forced to fly, And doomed to death, though fated not to die. Not so her young; for their unequal line Was hero's make, half human, half divine. Their earthly mould obnoxious was to fate, The immortal part assumed immortal state. Of these a slaughtered army lay in blood, Extended o'er the Caledonian wood, Their native walk; whose vocal blood arose, And cried for pardon on their perjured foes. Their fate was fruitful, and the sanguine seed, Endued with souls, increased the sacred breed. So captive Israel multiplied in chains, A numerous exile, and enjoyed her pains. With grief and gladness mixed, their mother viewed Her martyr'd offspring, and their race renewed; Their corpse to perish, but their kind to last, So much the deathless plant the dying fruit surpassed. Panting and pensive now she ranged alone, And wandered in the kingdoms, once her own. The common hunt, though from their rage restrained By sovereign power, her company disdained, Grinned as they passed, and with a glaring eye Gave gloomy signs of secret enmity. 'Tis true, she bounded by, and tripped so light, They had not time to take a steady sight; For truth has such a face and such a mien, As to be loved needs only to be seen. The bloody Bear, an independent beast, Unlicked to form, in groans her hate exprest. Among the timorous kind, the quaking Hare Professed neutrality, but would not swear. Next her the buffoon Ape, as atheists use, Mimicked all sects, and had his own to choose; Still when the Lion looked, his knees he bent, And paid at church a courtier's compliment. The bristled baptist Boar, impure as he, But whitened with the foam of sanctity, With fat pollutions filled the sacred place, And mountains levelled in his furious race; So first rebellion founded was in grace. But since the mighty ravage, which he made In German forests, had his guilt betrayed, With broken tusks, and with a borrowed name, He shunned the vengeance, and concealed the shame; So lurked in sects unseen. With greater guile False Reynard fed on consecrated spoil; The graceless beast by Athanasius first Was chased from Nice, then by Socinus nursed; His impious race their blasphemy renewed, And nature's king through nature's optics viewed. Reversed, they viewed him lessened to their eye, Nor in an infant could a God descry; New swarming sects to this obliquely tend, Hence they began, and here they all will end. What weight of ancient witness can prevail, If private reason hold the public scale? But, gracious God, how well dost thou provide For erring judgments an unerring guide! Thy throne is darkness in the abyss of light, A blaze of glory that forbids the sight. O teach me to believe thee, thus concealed, And search no farther than thyself revealed; But her alone for my director take, Whom thou hast promised never to forsake! My thoughtless youth was winged with vain desires; My manhood, long misled by wandering fires, Followed false lights; and, when their glimpse was gone, My pride struck out new sparkles of her own. Such was I, such by nature still I am; Be thine the glory, and be mine the shame! Good life be now my task; my doubts are done; What more could fright my faith, than three in one? Can I believe eternal God could lie Disguised in mortal mould, and infancy? That the great Maker of the world could die? And after that trust my imperfect sense, Which calls in question his omnipotence? Can I my reason to my faith compel, And shall my sight, and touch, and taste rebel? Superior faculties are set aside; Shall their subservient organs be my guide? Then let the moon usurp the rule of day, And winking tapers show the sun his way; For what my senses can themselves perceive, I need no revelation to believe. Can they, who say the Host should be descried By sense, define a body glorified, Impassible, and penetrating parts? Let them declare by what mysterious arts He shot that body through the opposing might Of bolts and bars impervious to the light, And stood before his train confessed in open sight. For since thus wondrously he passed, 'tis plain, One single place two bodies did contain; And sure the same Omnipotence as well Can make one body in more places dwell. Let reason then at her own quarry fly, But how can finite grasp infinity? 'Tis urged again, that faith did first commence By miracles, which are appeals to sense, And thence concluded, that our sense must be The motive still of credibility; For latter ages must on former wait, And what began belief, must propagate. But winnow well this thought, and you shall find 'Tis light as chaff that flies before the wind. Were all those wonders wrought by power divine, As means or ends of some more deep design? Most sure as means, whose end was this alone, To prove the Godhead of the Eternal Son. God thus asserted, man is to believe Beyond what sense and reason can conceive, And, for mysterious things of faith, rely On the proponent, heaven's authority. If, then, our faith we for our guide admit, Vain is the farther search of human wit; As when the building gains a surer stay, We take the unuseful scaffolding away. Reason by sense no more can understand; The game is played into another hand. Why choose we then like bilanders to creep Along the coast, and land in view to keep, When safely we may launch into the deep? In the same vessel, which our Saviour bore, Himself the pilot, let us leave the shore, And with a better guide a better world explore. Could he his Godhead veil with flesh and blood, And not veil these again to be our food? His grace in both is equal in extent, The first affords us life, the second nourishment. And if he can, why all this frantic pain, To construe what his clearest words contain, And make a riddle what he made so plain? To take up half on trust, and half to try, Name it not faith, but bungling bigotry; Both knave and fool the merchant we may call, To pay great sums, and to compound the small; For who would break with heaven, and would not break for all? Rest then, my soul, from endless anguish freed; Nor sciences thy guide, nor sense thy creed. Faith is the best ensurer of thy bliss; The bank above must fail, before the venture miss. But heaven and heaven-born faith are far from thee, Thou first apostate to divinity. Unkennelled range in thy Polonian plains; A fiercer foe the insatiate Wolf remains. Too boastful Britain, please thyself no more, That beasts of prey are banished from thy shore; The bear, the boar, and every savage name, Wild in effect, though in appearance tame, Lay waste thy woods, destroy thy blissful bower, And, muzzled though they seem, the mutes devour. More haughty than the rest, the wolfish race Appears with belly gaunt, and famished face; Never was so deformed a beast of grace. His ragged tail betwixt his legs he wears, Close clapped for shame; but his rough crest he rears, And pricks up his predestinating ears. His wild disordered walk, his haggard eyes, Did all the bestial citizens surprise. Though feared and hated, yet he ruled a while, As captain or companion of the spoil. Full many a year his hateful head had been For tribute paid, nor since in Cambria seen; The last of all the litter scaped by chance, And from Geneva first infested France. Some authors thus his pedigree will trace, But others write him of an upstart race; Because of Wicliffe's brood no mark he brings, But his innate antipathy to kings. These last deduce him from the Helvetian kind, Who near the Leman lake his consort lined; That fiery Zuinglius first the affection bred, And meagre Calvin blessed the nuptial bed. In Israel some believe him whelped long since, When the proud sanhedrim oppressed the prince; Or, since he will be Jew, derive him higher, When Corah with his brethren did conspire From Moses' hand the sovereign sway to wrest, And Aaron of his ephod to divest; Till opening earth made way for all to pass, And could not bear the burden of a class. The Fox and he came shuffled in the dark, If ever they were stowed in Noah's ark; Perhaps not made; for all their barking train The dog (a common species) will contain; And some wild curs, who from their masters ran, Abhorring the supremacy of man, In woods and caves the rebel-race began. O happy pair, how well have you increased! What ills in church and state have you redressed! With teeth untried, and rudiments of claws, Your first essay was on your native laws; Those having torn with ease, and trampled down, Your fangs you fastened on the mitred crown, And freed from God and monarchy your town. What though your native kennel still be small, Bounded betwixt a puddle and a wall; Yet your victorious colonies are sent Where the north ocean girds the continent. Quickened with fire below, your monsters breed In fenny Holland, and in fruitful Tweed; And, like the first, the last affects to be Drawn to the dregs of a democracy. As, where in fields the fairy rounds are seen, A rank sour herbage rises on the green; So, springing where these midnight elves advance, Rebellion prints the footsteps of the dance. Such are their doctrines, such contempt they show To heaven above, and to their prince below, As none but traitors and blasphemers know. God like the tyrant of the skies is placed, And kings, like slaves, beneath the crowd debased. So fulsome is their food, that flocks refuse To bite, and only dogs for physic use. As, where the lightning runs along the ground, No husbandry can heal the blasting wound; Nor bladed grass, nor bearded corn succeeds, But scales of scurf and putrefaction breeds; Such wars, such waste, such fiery tracks of dearth Their zeal has left, and such a teemless earth. But, as the poisons of the deadliest kind Are to their own unhappy coasts confined; As only Indian shades of sight deprive, And magic plants will but in Colchos thrive; So presbytery and pestilential zeal Can only flourish in a commonweal. From Celtic woods is chased the wolfish crew; But ah! some pity e'en to brutes is due; Their native walks, methinks, they might enjoy, Curbed of their native malice to destroy. Of all the tyrannies on humankind, The worst is that which persecutes the mind. Let us but weigh at what offence we strike; 'Tis but because we cannot think alike. In punishing of this, we overthrow The laws of nations and of nature too. Beasts are the subjects of tyrannic sway, Where still the stronger on the weaker prey; Man only of a softer mould is made, Not for his fellows' ruin, but their aid; Created kind, beneficent and free, The noble image of the Deity. One portion of informing fire was given To brutes, the inferior family of heaven. The smith divine, as with a careless beat, Struck out the mute creation at a heat; But, when arrived at last to human race, The Godhead took a deep considering space; And, to distinguish man from all the rest, Unlocked the sacred treasures of his breast; And mercy mixt with reason did impart, One to his head, the other to his heart; Reason to rule, but mercy to forgive; The first is law, the last prerogative. And like his mind his outward form appeared, When, issuing naked to the wondering herd, He charmed their eyes; and, for they loved, they feared. Not armed with horns of arbitrary might, Or claws to seize their furry spoils in fight, Or with increase of feet to o'ertake them in their flight; Of easy shape, and pliant every way, Confessing still the softness of his clay, And kind as kings upon their coronation day; With open hands, and with extended space Of arms, to satisfy a large embrace. Thus kneaded up with milk, the new-made man His kingdom o'er his kindred world began; Till knowledge misapplied, misunderstood, And pride of empire, soured his balmy blood. Then, first rebelling, his own stamp he coins; The murderer Cain was latent in his loins; And blood began its first and loudest cry, For differing worship of the Deity. Thus persecution rose, and farther space Produced the mighty hunter of his race. Not so the blessed Pan his flock increased, Content to fold them from the famished beast: Mild were his laws; the sheep and harmless hind Were never of the persecuting kind. Such pity now the pious pastor shows, Such mercy from the British Lion flows, That both provide protection from their foes. O happy regions, Italy and Spain, Which never did those monsters entertain! The Wolf, the Bear, the Boar, can there advance No native claim of just inheritance; And self-preserving laws, severe in show, May guard their fences from the invading foe. Where birth has placed them, let them safely share The common benefit of vital air; Themselves unharmful, let them live unharmed, Their jaws disabled, and their claws disarmed; Here, only in nocturnal howlings bold, They dare not seize the Hind, nor leap the fold. More powerful, and as vigilant as they, The Lion awfully forbids the prey. Their rage repressed, though pinched with famine sore, They stand aloof, and tremble at his roar; Much is their hunger, but their fear is more. These are the chief; to number o'er the rest, And stand, like Adam, naming every beast, Were weary work; nor will the muse describe A slimy-born and sun-begotten tribe; Who, far from steeples and their sacred sound, In fields their sullen conventicles found. These gross, half-animated, lumps I leave; Nor can I think what thoughts they can conceive. But if they think at all, 'tis sure no higher Than matter, put in motion, may aspire; Souls that can scarce ferment their mass of clay; So drossy, so divisible are they, As would but serve pure bodies for allay; Such souls as shards produce, such beetle things As only buzz to heaven with evening wings; Strike in the dark, offending but by chance, Such are the blindfold blows of ignorance. They know not beings, and but hate a name; To them the Hind and Panther are the same. The Panther, sure the noblest, next the Hind, And fairest creature of the spotted kind; Oh, could her inborn stains be washed away, She were too good to be a beast of prey! How can I praise, or blame, and not offend, Or how divide the frailty from the friend? Her faults and virtues lie so mixed, that she Nor wholly stands condemned, nor wholly free. Then, like her injured Lion, let me speak; He cannot bend her, and he would not break. Unkind already, and estranged in part, The Wolf begins to share her wandering heart. Though unpolluted yet with actual ill, She half commits who sins but in her will. If, as our dreaming Platonists report, There could be spirits of a middle sort, Too black for heaven, and yet too white for hell, Who just dropt half-way down, nor lower fell; So poised, so gently she descends from high, It seems a soft dismission from the sky. Her house not ancient, whatsoe'er pretence Her clergy-heralds make in her defence; A second century not half-way run, Since the new honours of her blood begun; A lion, old, obscene, and furious made By lust, compressed her mother in a shade. Then, by a left-hand marriage, weds the dame, Covering adultery with a specious name; So schism begot; and sacrilege and she, A well-matched pair, got graceless heresy. God's and kings' rebels have the same good cause, To trample down divine and human laws; Both would be called reformers, and their hate Alike destructive both to church and state. The fruit proclaims the plant; a lawless prince By luxury reformed incontinence; By ruins, charity; by riots, abstinence. Confessions, fasts, and penance set aside, Oh with what ease we follow such a guide, Where souls are starved, and senses gratified! Where marriage-pleasures midnight prayer supply, And matin bells, a melancholy cry, Are tuned to merrier notes, Increase and multiply. Religion shows a rosy-coloured face; Not hattered out with drudging works of grace; A down-hill reformation rolls apace. What flesh and blood would crowd the narrow gate, Or, till they waste their pampered paunches, wait? All would be happy at the cheapest rate. Though our lean faith these rigid laws has given, The full-fed Mussulman goes fat to heaven; For his Arabian prophet with delights Of sense allured his eastern proselytes. The jolly Luther, reading him, began To interpret scriptures by his Alcoran; To grub the thorns beneath our tender feet, And make the paths of paradise more sweet, Bethought him of a wife, ere half way gone, For 'twas uneasy travelling alone; And, in this masquerade of mirth and love, Mistook the bliss of heaven for Bacchanals above. Sure he presumed of praise, who came to stock The ethereal pastures with so fair a flock, Burnished, and battening on their food, to show The diligence of careful herds below. Our Panther, though like these she changed her head, Yet, as the mistress of a monarch's bed, Her front erect with majesty she bore, The crosier wielded, and the mitre wore. Her upper part of decent discipline Showed affectation of an ancient line; And Fathers, Councils, Church and Church's head, Were on her reverend phylacteries read. But what disgraced and disavowed the rest, Was Calvin's brand, that stigmatised the beast. Thus, like a creature of a double kind, In her own labyrinth she lives confined; To foreign lands no sound of her is come, Humbly content to be despised at home. Such is her faith, where good cannot be had, At least she leaves the refuse of the bad: Nice in her choice of ill, though not of best, And least deformed, because reformed the least. In doubtful points betwixt her differing friends, Where one for substance, one for sign contends, Their contradicting terms she strives to join; Sign shall be substance, substance shall be sign. A real presence all her sons allow, And yet 'tis flat idolatry to bow, Because the Godhead's there they know not how. Her novices are taught, that bread and wine Are but the visible and outward sign, Received by those who in communion join; But the inward grace, or the thing signified, His blood and body, who to save us died, The faithful this thing signified receive: What is't those faithful then partake or leave? For, what is signified and understood, Is, by her own confession, flesh and blood. Then, by the same acknowledgment, we know They take the sign, and take the substance too. The literal sense is hard to flesh and blood, But nonsense never can be understood. Her wild belief on every wave is tost; But sure no Church can better morals boast. True to her king her principles are found; Oh that her practice were but half so sound! Stedfast in various turns of state she stood, And sealed her vowed affection with her blood: Nor will I meanly tax her constancy, That interest or obligement made the tie, Bound to the fate of murdered monarchy. Before the sounding axe so falls the vine, Whose tender branches round the poplar twine. She chose her ruin, and resigned her life, In death undaunted as an Indian wife: A rare example! but some souls we see Grow hard, and stiffen with adversity: Yet these by fortune's favours are undone; Resolved, into a baser form they run, And bore the wind, but cannot bear the sun. Let this be nature's frailty, or her fate, The Wolf, Or Isgrim's counsel, her new-chosen mate, Still she's the fairest of the fallen crew; No mother more indulgent, but the true. Fierce to her foes, yet fears her force to try, Because she wants innate authority; For how can she constrain them to obey, Who has herself cast off the lawful sway? Rebellion equals all, and those, who toil In common theft, will share the common spoil. Let her produce the title and the right, Against her old superiors first to fight; If she reform by text, even that's as plain For her own rebels to reform again. As long as words a different sense will bear, And each may be his own interpreter, Our airy faith will no foundation find, The word's a weathercock for every wind: The bear, the fox, the wolf, by turns prevail; The most in power supplies the present gale. The wretched Panther cries aloud for aid To Church and Councils, whom she first betrayed; No help from fathers or tradition's train: Those ancient guides she taught us to disdain, And by that scripture, which she once abused To reformation, stands herself accused. What bills for breach of laws can she prefer, Expounding which she owns herself may err? And, after all her winding ways are tried, If doubts arise, she slips herself aside, And leaves the private conscience for the guide. If, then, that conscience set the offender free, It bars her claim to Church authority. How can she censure, or what crime pretend, But scripture may be construed to defend? Even those, whom for rebellion she transmits To civil power, her doctrine first acquits; Because no disobedience can ensue, Where no submission to a judge is due; Each judging for himself by her consent, Whom, thus absolved, she sends to punishment. Suppose the magistrate revenge her cause, 'Tis only for transgressing human laws. How answering to its end a Church is made, Whose power is but to counsel and persuade? O solid rock, on which secure she stands! Eternal house, not built with mortal hands! O sure defence against the infernal gate, A patent during pleasure of the state! Thus is the Panther neither loved nor feared, A mere mock queen of a divided herd; Whom soon by lawful power she might control, Herself a part submitted to the whole. Then, as the moon who first receives the light By which she makes our nether regions bright, So might she shine, reflecting from afar The rays she borrowed from a better star; Big with the beams which from her mother flow, And reigning o'er the rising tides below: Now, mixing with a savage crowd, she goes, And meanly flatters her inveterate foes; Ruled while she rules, and losing every hour Her wretched remnants of precarious power. One evening, while the cooler shade she sought, Revolving many a melancholy thought, Alone she walked, and looked around in vain, With rueful visage, for her vanished train: None of her sylvan subjects made their court; Levées and couchées passed without resort. So hardly can usurpers manage well Those, whom they first instructed to rebel: More liberty begets desire of more; The hunger still increases with the store. Without respect, they brushed along the wood, Each in his clan, and, filled with loathsome food, Asked no permission to the neighbouring flood. The Panther, full of inward discontent, Since they would go, before them wisely went; Supplying want of power by drinking first, As if she gave them leave to quench their thirst. Among the rest, the Hind, with fearful face, Beheld from far the common watering-place, Nor durst approach; till with an awful roar The sovereign Lion bade her fear no more. Encouraged thus, she brought her younglings nigh, Watching the motions of her patron's eye, And drank a sober draught; the rest, amazed, Stood mutely still, and on the stranger gazed; Surveyed her part by part, and sought to find The ten-horned monster in the harmless Hind, Such as the Wolf and Panther had designed. They thought at first they dreamed; for 'twas offence With them, to question certitude of sense, Their guide in faith: but nearer when they drew, And had the faultless object full in view, Lord, how they all admired her heavenly hue! Some, who, before, her fellowship disdained, Scarce, and but scarce, from inborn rage restrained, Now frisked about her, and old kindred feigned. Whether for love or interest, every sect Of all the savage nation showed respect. The viceroy Panther could not awe the herd; The more the company, the less they feared. The surly Wolf with secret envy burst, Yet could not howl; (the Hind had seen him first;) But what he durst not speak, the Panther durst. For when the herd, sufficed, did late repair To ferny heaths, and to their forest lair, She made a mannerly excuse to stay, Proffering the Hind to wait her half the way; That, since the sky was clear, an hour of talk Might help her to beguile the tedious walk. With much good-will the motion was embraced, To chat a while on their adventures passed; Nor had the grateful Hind so soon forgot Her friend and fellow-sufferer in the Plot. Yet wondering how of late she grew estranged, Her forehead cloudy, and her countenance changed, She thought this hour the occasion would present, To learn her secret cause of discontent; Which well she hoped might be with ease redressed, Considering her a well-bred civil beast, And more a gentlewoman than the rest. After some common talk what rumours ran, The lady of the spotted muff began. PART II. “Dame,” said the Panther, “times are mended well, Since late among the Philistines you fell. The toils were pitched, a spacious tract of ground With expert huntsmen was encompassed round; The inclosure narrowed; the sagacious power Of hounds and death drew nearer every hour. 'Tis true, the younger lion 'scaped the snare, But all your priestly calves lay struggling there, As sacrifices on their altars laid; While you, their careful mother, wisely fled, Not trusting destiny to save your head. For, whate'er promises you have applied To your unfailing Church, the surer side Is four fair legs in danger to provide; And whate'er tales of Peter's chair you tell, Yet, saving reverence of the miracle, The better luck was yours to 'scape so well.” “As I remember,” said the sober Hind, “Those toils were for your own dear self designed, As well as me; and with the selfsame throw, To catch the quarry and the vermin too,— Forgive the slanderous tongues that called you so. Howe'er you take it now, the common cry Then ran you down for your rank loyalty. Besides, in Popery they thought you nurst, As evil tongues will ever speak the worst, Because some forms, and ceremonies some You kept, and stood in the main question dumb. Dumb you were born indeed; but, thinking long, The test, it seems, at last has loosed your tongue: And to explain what your forefathers meant, By real presence in the sacrament, After long fencing pushed against a wall, Your salvo comes, that he's not there at all: There changed your faith, and what may change may fall. Who can believe what varies every day, Nor ever was, nor will be at a stay?” “Tortures may force the tongue untruths to tell, And I ne'er owned myself infallible,” Replied the Panther: “grant such presence were, Yet in your sense I never owned it there. A real virtue we by faith receive, And that we in the sacrament believe.” “Then,” said the Hind, “as you the matter state, Not only Jesuits can equivocate; For real, as you now the word expound, From solid substance dwindles to a sound. Methinks, an Æsop's fable you repeat; You know who took the shadow for the meat: Your Church's substance thus you change at will, And yet retain your former figure still. I freely grant you spoke to save your life; For then you lay beneath the butcher's knife. Long time you fought, redoubled battery bore, But, after all, against yourself you swore, Your former self; for every hour your form Is chopped and changed, like winds before a storm. Thus fear and interest will prevail with some; For all have not the gift of martyrdom.” The Panther grinned at this, and thus replied: “That men may err was never yet denied; But, if that common principle be true, The canon, dame, is levelled full at you. But, shunning long disputes, I fain would see That wondrous wight, Infallibility. Is he from heaven, this mighty champion, come? Or lodged below in subterranean Rome? First, seat him somewhere, and derive his race, Or else conclude that nothing has no place.” “Suppose, though I disown it,” said the Hind, “The certain mansion were not yet assigned; The doubtful residence no proof can bring Against the plain existence of the thing. Because philosophers may disagree, If sight by emission, or reception be, Shall it be thence inferred, I do not see? But you require an answer positive, Which yet, when I demand, you dare not give; For fallacies in universals live. I then affirm, that this unfailing guide In Pope and General Councils must reside; Both lawful, both combined; what one decrees By numerous votes, the other ratifies: On this undoubted sense the Church relies. 'Tis true, some doctors in a scantier space, I mean, in each apart, contract the place. Some, who to greater length extend the line, The Church's after-acceptation join. This last circumference appears too wide; The Church diffused is by the Council tied, As members by their representatives Obliged to laws, which prince and senate gives. Thus, some contract, and some enlarge the space; In Pope and Council, who denies the place, Assisted from above with God's unfailing grace? Those canons all the needful points contain; Their sense so obvious, and their words so plain, That no disputes about the doubtful text Have hitherto the labouring world perplext. If any should in after-times appear, New Councils must be called, to make the meaning clear; Because in them the power supreme resides, And all the promises are to the guides. This may be taught with sound and safe defence; But mark how sandy is your own pretence, Who, setting Councils, Pope, and Church aside, Are every man his own presuming guide. The sacred books, you say, are full and plain, And every needful point of truth contain; All who can read interpreters may be. Thus, though your several Churches disagree, Yet every saint has to himself alone The secret of this philosophic stone. These principles you jarring sects unite, When differing doctors and disciples fight. Though Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, holy chiefs, Have made a battle-royal of beliefs; Or, like wild horses, several ways have whirled The tortured text about the Christian world; Each Jehu lashing on with furious force, That Turk or Jew could not have used it worse; No matter what dissension leaders make, Where every private man may save a stake: Ruled by the scripture and his own advice, Each has a blind by-path to Paradise; Where, driving in a circle slow or fast, Opposing sects are sure to meet at last. A wondrous charity you have in store For all reformed to pass the narrow door; So much, that Mahomet had scarcely more. For he, kind prophet, was for damning none; But Christ and Moses were to save their own: Himself was to secure his chosen race, Though reason good for Turks to take the place, And he allowed to be the better man, In virtue of his holier Alcoran.” “True,” said the Panther, “I shall ne'er deny My brethren may be saved as well as I: Though Huguenots contemn our ordination, Succession, ministerial vocation; And Luther, more mistaking what he read, Misjoins the sacred body with the bread: Yet, lady, still remember I maintain, The word in needful points is only plain.” “Needless, or needful, I not now contend, For still you have a loop-hole for a friend,” Rejoined the matron; “but the rule you lay Has led whole flocks, and leads them still astray, In weighty points, and full damnation's way. For, did not Arius first, Socinus now, The Son's eternal Godhead disavow? And did not these by gospel texts alone Condemn our doctrine, and maintain their own? Have not all heretics the same pretence To plead the scriptures in their own defence? How did the Nicene Council then decide That strong debate? was it by scripture tried? No, sure; to that the rebel would not yield; Squadrons of texts he marshalled in the field: That was but civil war, an equal set, Where piles with piles, and eagles eagles met. With texts point-blank and plain he faced the foe, And did not Satan tempt our Saviour so? The good old bishops took a simpler way; Each asked but what he heard his father say, Or how he was instructed in his youth, And by tradition's force upheld the truth.” The Panther smiled at this;—“And when,” said she, “Were those first Councils disallowed by me? Or where did I at sure tradition strike, Provided still it were apostolic?” “Friend,” said the Hind, “you quit your former ground, Where all your faith you did on scripture found: Now 'tis tradition joined with holy writ; But thus your memory betrays your wit.” “No,” said the Panther; “for in that I view, When your tradition's forged, and when 'tis true. I set them by the rule, and, as they square, Or deviate from undoubted doctrine there, This oral fiction, that old faith declare.” Hind. “The Council steered, it seems, a different course; They tried the scripture by tradition's force: But you tradition by the scripture try; Pursued by sects, from this to that you fly, Nor dare on one foundation to rely. The word is then deposed, and in this view, You rule the scripture, not the scripture you.” Thus said the dame, and, smiling, thus pursued: “I see, tradition then is disallowed, When not evinced by scripture to be true, And scripture, as interpreted by you. But here you tread upon unfaithful ground, Unless you could infallibly expound; Which you reject as odious popery, And throw that doctrine back with scorn on me. Suppose we on things traditive divide, And both appeal to scripture to decide; By various texts we both uphold our claim, Nay, often, ground our titles on the same: After long labour lost, and time's expense, Both grant the words, and quarrel for the sense. Thus all disputes for ever must depend; For no dumb rule can controversies end. Thus, when you said,—Tradition must be tried By sacred writ, whose sense yourselves decide, You said no more, but that yourselves must be The judges of the scripture sense, not we. Against our Church-tradition you declare, And yet your clerks would sit in Moses' chair; At least 'tis proved against your argument, The rule is far from plain, where all dissent.” “If not by scriptures, how can we be sure,” Replied the Panther, “what tradition's pure? For you may palm upon us new for old; All, as they say, that glitters, is not gold.” “How but by following her,” replied the dame, “To whom derived from sire to son they came; Where every age does on another move, And trusts no farther than the next above; Where all the rounds like Jacob's ladder rise, The lowest hid in earth, the topmost in the skies?” Sternly the savage did her answer mark, Her glowing eye-balls glittering in the dark, And said but this:—“Since lucre was your trade, Succeeding times such dreadful gaps have made, 'Tis dangerous climbing: To your sons and you I leave the ladder, and its omen too.” Hind. “The Panther's breath was ever famed for sweet; But from the Wolf such wishes oft I meet. You learned this language from the Blatant Beast, Or rather did not speak, but were possessed. As for your answer, 'tis but barely urged: You must evince tradition to be forged; Produce plain proofs; unblemished authors use As ancient as those ages they accuse; Till when, 'tis not sufficient to defame; An old possession stands, till elder quits the claim. Then for our interest, which is named alone To load with envy, we retort your own; For, when traditions in your faces fly, Resolving not to yield, you must decry. As when the cause goes hard, the guilty man Excepts, and thins his jury all he can; So when you stand of other aid bereft, You to the twelve apostles would be left. Your friend the Wolf did with more craft provide To set those toys, traditions, quite aside; And fathers too, unless when, reason spent, He cites them but sometimes for ornament. But, madam Panther, you, though more sincere, Are not so wise as your adulterer; The private spirit is a better blind, Than all the dodging tricks your authors find. For they, who left the scripture to the crowd, Each for his own peculiar judge allowed; The way to please them was to make them proud. Thus with full sails they ran upon the shelf; Who could suspect a cozenage from himself? On his own reason safer 'tis to stand, Than be deceived and damned at second-hand. But you, who fathers and traditions take, And garble some, and some you quite forsake, Pretending Church-authority to fix, And yet some grains of private spirit mix, Are, like a mule, made up of different seed, And that's the reason why you never breed; At least, not propagate your kind abroad, For home dissenters are by statutes awed. And yet they grow upon you every day, While you, to speak the best, are at a stay, For sects, that are extremes, abhor a middle way: Like tricks of state, to stop a raging flood, Or mollify a mad-brained senate's mood; Of all expedients never one was good. Well may they argue, nor can you deny, If we must fix on Church authority, Best on the best, the fountain, not the flood; That must be better still, if this be good. Shall she command, who has herself rebelled? Is antichrist by antichrist expelled? Did we a lawful tyranny displace, To set aloft a bastard of the race? Why all these wars to win the book, if we Must not interpret for ourselves, but she? Either be wholly slaves, or wholly free. For purging fires traditions must not fight; But they must prove episcopacy's right. Thus, those led horses are from service freed; You never mount them but in time of need. Like mercenaries, hired for home defence, They will not serve against their native prince. Against domestic foes of hierarchy These are drawn forth, to make fanatics fly; But, when they see their countrymen at hand, Marching against them under Church-command, Straight they forsake their colours, and disband.” Thus she; nor could the Panther well enlarge With weak defence against so strong a charge; But said:—“For what did Christ his word provide, If still his Church must want a living guide? And if all-saving doctrines are not there, Or sacred penmen could not make them clear, From after-ages we should hope in vain For truths which men inspired could not explain.” “Before the word was written,” said the Hind, “Our Saviour preached his faith to humankind: From his apostles the first age received Eternal truth, and what they taught believed. Thus, by tradition faith was planted first, Succeeding flocks succeeding pastors nursed. This was the way our wise Redeemer chose, Who sure could all things for the best dispose, To fence his fold from their encroaching foes. He could have writ himself, but well foresaw The event would be like that of Moses' law; Some difference would arise, some doubts remain, Like those which yet the jarring Jews maintain. No written laws can be so plain, so pure, But wit may gloss, and malice may obscure; Not those indited by his first command, A prophet graved the text, an angel held his hand. Thus faith was ere the written word appeared, And men believed not what they read, but heard. But since the apostles could not be confined To these, or those, but severally designed Their large commission round the world to blow, To spread their faith, they spread their labours too. Yet still their absent flock their pains did share; They hearkened still, for love produces care. And as mistakes arose, or discords fell, Or bold seducers taught them to rebel, As charity grew cold, or faction hot, Or long neglect their lessons had forgot, For all their wants they wisely did provide, And preaching by epistles was supplied; So, great physicians cannot all attend, But some they visit, and to some they send. Yet all those letters were not writ to all; Nor first intended but occasional, Their absent sermons; nor, if they contain All needful doctrines, are those doctrines plain. Clearness by frequent preaching must be wrought; They writ but seldom, but they daily taught; And what one saint has said of holy Paul, ‘He darkly writ,’ is true applied to all. For this obscurity could heaven provide More prudently than by a living guide, As doubts arose, the difference to decide? A guide was therefore needful, therefore made; And, if appointed, sure to be obeyed. Thus, with due reverence to the apostles' writ, By which my sons are taught, to which submit, I think, those truths, their sacred works contain, The Church alone can certainly explain; That following ages, leaning on the past, May rest upon the primitive at last. Nor would I thence the word no rule infer, But none without the Church-interpreter; Because, as I have urged before, 'tis mute, And is itself the subject of dispute. But what the apostles their successors taught, They to the next, from them to us is brought, The undoubted sense which is in scripture sought. From hence the Church is armed, when errors rise, To stop their entrance, and prevent surprise; And, safe entrenched within, her foes without defies. By these all festering sores her Councils heal, Which time or has disclosed, or shall reveal; For discord cannot end without a last appeal. Nor can a council national decide, But with subordination to her guide: (I wish the cause were on that issue tried.) Much less the scripture; for suppose debate Betwixt pretenders to a fair estate, Bequeathed by some legator's last intent; (Such is our dying Saviour's testament:) The will is proved, is opened, and is read, The doubtful heirs their differing titles plead; All vouch the words their interest to maintain, And each pretends by those his cause is plain. Shall then the testament award the right? No, that's the Hungary for which they fight; The field of battle, subject of debate; The thing contended for, the fair estate. The sense is intricate, 'tis only clear What vowels and what consonants are there. Therefore 'tis plain, its meaning must be tried Before some judge appointed to decide.” “Suppose,” the fair apostate said, “I grant, The faithful flock some living guide should want, Your arguments an endless chase pursue: Produce this vaunted leader to our view, This mighty Moses of the chosen crew.” The dame, who saw her fainting foe retired, With force renewed, to victory aspired; And, looking upward to her kindred sky, As once our Saviour owned his Deity, Pronounced his words—“She whom ye seek am I.” Nor less amazed this voice the Panther heard, Than were those Jews to hear a God declared. Then thus the matron modestly renewed: “Let all your prophets and their sects be viewed, And see to which of them yourselves think fit The conduct of your conscience to submit; Each proselyte would vote his doctor best, With absolute exclusion to the rest: Thus would your Polish diet disagree, And end, as it began, in anarchy; Yourself the fairest for election stand, Because you seem crown-general of the land; But soon against your superstitious lawn Some Presbyterian sabre would be drawn; In your established laws of sovereignty The rest some fundamental flaw would see, And call rebellion gospel-liberty. To Church-decrees your articles require Submission mollified, if not entire. Homage denied, to censures you proceed; But when Curtana will not do the deed, You lay that pointless clergy-weapon by, And to the laws, your sword of justice, fly. Now this your sects the more unkindly take, (Those prying varlets hit the blots you make,) Because some ancient friends of yours declare, Your only rule of faith the scriptures are, Interpreted by men of judgment sound, Which every sect will for themselves expound; Nor think less reverence to their doctors due For sound interpretation, than to you. If then, by able heads, are understood Your brother prophets, who reformed abroad; Those able heads expound a wiser way, That their own sheep their shepherd should obey. But if you mean yourselves are only sound, That doctrine turns the reformation round, And all the rest are false reformers found; Because in sundry points you stand alone, Not in communion joined with any one; And therefore must be all the Church, or none. Then, till you have agreed whose judge is best, Against this forced submission they protest; While sound and sound a different sense explains, Both play at hardhead till they break their brains; And from their chairs each other's force defy, While unregarded thunders vainly fly. I pass the rest, because your Church alone Of all usurpers best could fill the throne. But neither you, nor any sect beside, For this high office can be qualified, With necessary gifts required in such a guide. For that, which must direct the whole, must be Bound in one bond of faith and unity; But all your several Churches disagree. The consubstantiating Church and priest Refuse communion to the Calvinist; The French reformed from preaching you restrain, Because you judge their ordination vain; And so they judge of yours, but donors must ordain. In short, in doctrine, or in discipline, Not one reformed can with another join; But all from each, as from damnation, fly: No union they pretend, but in non-popery. Nor, should their members in a synod meet, Could any Church presume to mount the seat, Above the rest, their discords to decide; None would obey, but each would be the guide; And face to face dissensions would increase, For only distance now preserves the peace. All in their turns accusers, and accused; Babel was never half so much confused; What one can plead, the rest can plead as well; For amongst equals lies no last appeal, And all confess themselves are fallible. Now, since you grant some necessary guide, All who can err are justly laid aside; Because a trust so sacred to confer Shows want of such a sure interpreter; And how can he be needful who can err? Then, granting that unerring guide we want, That such there is you stand obliged to grant; Our Saviour else were wanting to supply Our needs, and obviate that necessity. It then remains, that Church can only be The guide, which owns unfailing certainty; Or else you slip your hold, and change your side, Relapsing from a necessary guide. But this annexed condition of the crown, Immunity from errors, you disown; Here then you shrink, and lay your weak pretensions down. For petty royalties you raise debate; But this unfailing universal state You shun; nor dare succeed to such a glorious weight; And for that cause those promises detest, With which our Saviour did his Church invest; But strive to evade, and fear to find them true, As conscious they were never meant to you; All which the Mother-Church asserts her own, And with unrivalled claim ascends the throne. So, when of old the Almighty Father sate In council, to redeem our ruined state, Millions of millions, at a distance round, Silent the sacred consistory crowned, To hear what mercy, mixed with justice, could propound; All prompt, with eager pity, to fulfil The full extent of their Creator's will: But when the stern conditions were declared, A mournful whisper through the host was heard, And the whole hierarchy, with heads hung down, Submissively declined the ponderous proffer'd crown. Then, not till then, the Eternal Son from high Rose in the strength of all the Deity; Stood forth to accept the terms, and underwent A weight which all the frame of heaven had bent, Nor he himself could bear, but as Omnipotent. Now, to remove the least remaining doubt, That even the blear-eyed sects may find her out, Behold what heavenly rays adorn her brows, What from his wardrobe her beloved allows, To deck the wedding-day of his unspotted spouse! Behold what marks of majesty she brings, Richer than ancient heirs of eastern kings! Her right hand holds the sceptre and the keys, To show whom she commands, and who obeys; With these to bind, or set the sinner free, With that to assert spiritual royalty. “One in herself, not rent by schism, but sound, Marks of the Catholic Church from the Nicene Creed. Entire, one solid shining diamond; Not sparkles shattered into sects like you: One is the Church, and must be to be true; One central principle of unity; As undivided, so from errors free; As one in faith, so one in sanctity. Thus she, and none but she, the insulting rage Of heretics opposed from age to age; Still when the giant-brood invades her throne, She stoops from heaven, and meets them halfway down, And with paternal thunder vindicates her crown. But like Egyptian sorcerers you stand, And vainly lift aloft your magic wand, To sweep away the swarms of vermin from the land; You could, like them, with like infernal force, Produce the plague, but not arrest the course. But when the boils and botches, with disgrace And public scandal, sat upon the face, Themselves attacked, the Magi strove no more, They saw God's finger, and their fate deplore; Themselves they could not cure of the dishonest sore. Thus one, thus pure, behold her largely spread, Like the fair ocean from her mother-bed; From east to west triumphantly she rides, All shores are watered by her wealthy tides. The gospel-sound, diffused from pole to pole, Where winds can carry, and where waves can roll, The selfsame doctrine of the sacred page Conveyed to every clime, in every age. “Here let my sorrow give my satire place, To raise new blushes on my British race. Our sailing ships like common-sewers we use, And through our distant colonies diffuse The draught of dungeons, and the stench of stews; Whom, when their home-bred honesty is lost, We disembogue on some far Indian coast, Thieves, panders, palliards, sins of every sort; Those are the manufactures we export, And these the missioners our zeal has made; For, with my country's pardon, be it said, Religion is the least of all our trade. “Yet some improve their traffic more than we, For they on gain, their only god, rely, And set a public price on piety. Industrious of the needle and the chart, They run full sail to their Japonian mart; Preventing fear, and, prodigal of fame, Sell all of Christian to the very name, Nor leave enough of that to hide their naked shame. “Thus, of three marks, which in the creed we view, Not one of all can be applied to you; Much less the fourth. In vain, alas! you seek The ambitious title of apostolic: Godlike descent! 'tis well your blood can be Proved noble in the third or fourth degree; For all of ancient that you had before, I mean what is not borrowed from our store, Was error fulminated o'er and o'er; Old heresies condemned in ages past, By care and time recovered from the blast. “'Tis said with ease, but never can be proved, The Church her old foundations has removed, And built new doctrines on unstable sands: Judge that, ye winds and rains! you proved her, yet she stands. Those ancient doctrines charged on her for new, Show when, and how, and from what hands they grew. We claim no power, when heresies grow bold, To coin new faith, but still declare the old. How else could that obscene disease be purged, When controverted texts are vainly urged? To prove tradition new, there's somewhat more Required, than saying, 'Twas not used before. Those monumental arms are never stirred, Till schism or heresy call down Goliah's sword. “Thus, what you call corruptions, are, in truth, The first plantations of the gospel's youth; Old standard faith; but cast your eyes again, And view those errors which new sects maintain, Or which of old disturbed the Church's peaceful reign; And we can point each period of the time, When they began, and who begot the crime; Can calculate how long the eclipse endured, Who interposed, what digits were obscured: Of all which are already passed away, We know the rise, the progress, and decay. “Despair at our foundations then to strike, Till you can prove your faith apostolic; A limpid stream drawn from the native source; Succession lawful in a lineal course. Prove any Church, opposed to this our head, So one, so pure, so unconfinedly spread, Under one chief of the spiritual state, The members all combined, and all subordinate; Show such a seamless coat, from schism so free, In no communion joined with heresy;— If such a one you find, let truth prevail; Till when, your weights will in the balance fail; A Church unprincipled kicks up the scale. But if you cannot think, (nor sure you can Suppose in God what were unjust in man,) That He, the fountain of eternal grace, Should suffer falsehood for so long a space To banish truth, and to usurp her place; That seven successive ages should be lost, And preach damnation at their proper cost; That all your erring ancestors should die, Drowned in the abyss of deep idolatry; If piety forbid such thoughts to rise, Awake, and open your unwilling eyes: God hath left nothing for each age undone, From this to that wherein he sent his Son; Then think but well of him, and half your work is done. See how his Church, adorned with every grace, With open arms, a kind forgiving face, Stands ready to prevent her long-lost son's embrace! Not more did Joseph o'er his brethren weep, Nor less himself could from discovery keep, When in the crowd of suppliants they were seen, And in their crew his best-loved Benjamin. That pious Joseph in the Church behold, The Renunciation of the Benedictines to the Abbey Lands. To feed your famine, and refuse your gold; The Joseph you exiled, the Joseph whom you sold.” Thus, while with heavenly charity she spoke, A streaming blaze the silent shadows broke; Shot from the skies a cheerful azure light; The birds obscene to forests winged their flight, And gaping graves received the wandering guilty sprite. Such were the pleasing triumphs of the sky, For James his late nocturnal victory; The pledge of his almighty Patron's love, The fireworks which his angels made above. I saw myself the lambent easy light Poeta loquitur. Gild the brown horror, and dispel the night; The messenger with speed the tidings bore; News, which three labouring nations did restore; But heaven's own Nuntius was arrived before. By this, the Hind had reached her lonely cell, And vapours rose, and dews unwholesome fell; When she, by frequent observation wise, As one who long on heaven had fixed her eyes, Discerned a change of weather in the skies. The western borders were with crimson spread, The moon descending looked all flaming red; She thought good manners bound her to invite The stranger dame to be her guest that night. 'Tis true, coarse diet, and a short repast, She said, were weak inducements to the taste Of one so nicely bred, and so unused to fast; But what plain fare her cottage could afford, A hearty welcome at a homely board, Was freely hers; and, to supply the rest, An honest meaning, and an open breast; Last, with content of mind, the poor man's wealth, A grace-cup to their common patron's health. This she desired her to accept, and stay, For fear she might be wildered in her way, Because she wanted an unerring guide, And then the dewdrops on her silken hide Her tender constitution did declare, Too lady-like a long fatigue to bear, And rough inclemencies of raw nocturnal air. But most she feared, that, travelling so late, Some evil-minded beasts might lie in wait, And without witness wreak their hidden hate. The Panther, though she lent a listening ear, Had more of lion in her than to fear; Yet wisely weighing, since she had to deal With many foes, their numbers might prevail, Returned her all the thanks she could afford, And took her friendly hostess at her word; Who, entering first her lowly roof, a shed With hoary moss and winding ivy spread, Honest enough to hide an humble hermit's head, Thus graciously bespoke her welcome guest: “So might these walls, with your fair presence blest, Become your dwelling-place of everlasting rest; Not for a night, or quick revolving year, Welcome an owner, not a sojourner. This peaceful seat my poverty secures; War seldom enters but where wealth allures: Nor yet despise it; for this poor abode, Has oft received, and yet receives a God; A God, victorious of the Stygian race, Here laid his sacred limbs, and sanctified the place. This mean retreat did mighty Pan contain; Be emulous of him, and pomp disdain, And dare not to debase your soul to gain.” The silent stranger stood amazed to see Contempt of wealth, and wilful poverty; And, though ill habits are not soon controlled, Awhile suspended her desire of gold. But civilly drew in her sharpened paws, Not violating hospitable laws, And pacified her tail, and licked her frothy jaws. The Hind did first her country cates provide; Then couched herself securely by her side. PART THIRD. Much malice, mingled with a little wit, Perhaps may censure this mysterious writ; Because the muse has peopled Caledon With panthers, bears, and wolves, and beasts unknown, As if we were not stocked with monsters of our own. Let Æsop answer, who has set to view Such kinds as Greece and Phrygia never knew; And Mother Hubbard, in her homely dress, Has sharply blamed a British lioness; That queen, whose feast the factious rabble keep, Exposed obscenely naked, and asleep. Led by those great examples, may not I The wonted organs of their words supply? If men transact like brutes, 'tis equal then For brutes to claim the privilege of men. Others our Hind of folly will indite, To entertain a dangerous guest by night. Let those remember, that she cannot die, Till rolling time is lost in round eternity; Nor need she fear the Panther, though untamed, Because the Lion's peace was now proclaimed; The wary savage would not give offence, To forfeit the protection of her prince; But watched the time her vengeance to complete, When all her furry sons in frequent senate met; Meanwhile she quenched her fury at the flood, And with a lenten salad cooled her blood. Their commons, though but coarse, were nothing scant, Nor did their minds an equal banquet want. For now the Hind, whose noble nature strove To express her plain simplicity of love, Did all the honours of her house so well, No sharp debates disturbed the friendly meal. She turned the talk, avoiding that extreme, To common dangers past, a sadly-pleasing theme; Remembering every storm which tossed the state, When both were objects of the public hate, And dropt a tear betwixt for her own children's fate. Nor failed she then a full review to make Of what the Panther suffered for her sake; Her lost esteem, her truth, her loyal care, Her faith unshaken to an exiled heir, Her strength to endure, her courage to defy, Her choice of honourable infamy. On these, prolixly thankful, she enlarged; Then with acknowledgments herself she charged; For friendship, of itself an holy tie, Is made more sacred by adversity. Now should they part, malicious tongues would say, They met like chance companions on the way, Whom mutual fear of robbers had possessed; While danger lasted, kindness was professed; But, that once o'er, the short-lived union ends, The road divides, and there divide the friends. The Panther nodded, when her speech was done, And thanked her coldly in a hollow tone; But said, her gratitude had gone too far For common offices of Christian care. If to the lawful heir she had been true, She paid but Cæsar what was Cæsar's due. “I might,” she added, “with like praise describe Your suffering sons, and so return your bribe: But incense from my hands is poorly prized; For gifts are scorned where givers are despised. I served a turn, and then was cast away; You, like the gaudy fly, your wings display, And sip the sweets, and bask in your great patron's day.” This heard, the matron was not slow to find What sort of malady had seized her mind; Disdain, with gnawing envy, fell despite, And cankered malice, stood in open sight; Ambition, interest, pride without control, And jealousy, the jaundice of the soul; Revenge, the bloody minister of ill, With all the lean tormentors of the will. 'Twas easy now to guess from whence arose Her new-made union with her ancient foes; Her forced civilities, her faint embrace, Affected kindness, with an altered face; Yet durst she not too deeply probe the wound, As hoping still the nobler parts were sound; But strove with anodynes to assuage the smart, And mildly thus her medicine did impart. “Complaints of lovers help to ease their pain; It shows a rest of kindness to complain; A friendship loath to quit its former hold, And conscious merit, may be justly bold; But much more just your jealousy would show, If others' good were injury to you: Witness, ye heavens, how I rejoice to see Rewarded worth and rising loyalty! Your warrior offspring, that upheld the crown, The scarlet honour of your peaceful gown, Are the most pleasing objects I can find, Charms to my sight, and cordials to my mind: When virtue spooms before a prosperous gale, My heaving wishes help to fill the sail; And if my prayers for all the brave were heard, Cæsar should still have such, and such should still reward. “The laboured earth your pains have sowed and tilled, 'Tis just you reap the product of the field: Yours be the harvest; 'tis the beggar's gain, To glean the fallings of the loaded wain. Such scattered ears as are not worth your care, Your charity, for alms, may safely spare, For alms are but the vehicles of prayer. My daily bread is literally implored; I have no barns nor granaries to hoard. If Cæsar to his own his hand extends, Say which of yours his charity offends; You know, he largely gives to more than are his friends. Are you defrauded, when he feeds the poor? Our mite decreases nothing of your store. I am but few, and by your fare you see My crying sins are not of luxury. Some juster motive sure your mind withdraws, And makes you break our friendship's holy laws; For barefaced envy is too base a cause. Show more occasion for your discontent; Your love, the Wolf, would help you to invent: Some German quarrel, or, as times go now, Some French, where force is uppermost, will do. When at the fountain's head, as merit ought To claim the place, you take a swilling draught, How easy 'tis an envious eye to throw, And tax the sheep for troubling streams below; Or call her, when no further cause you find, An enemy professed of all your kind! But, then, perhaps, the wicked world would think, The Wolf designed to eat as well as drink.” This last allusion galled the Panther more, Because, indeed, it rubbed upon the sore; Yet seemed she not to wince, though shrewdly pained, But thus her passive character maintained. “I never grudged, whate'er my foes report, Your flaunting fortune in the Lion's court. You have your day, or you are much belied, But I am always on the suffering side; You know my doctrine, and I need not say, I will not, but I cannot disobey. On this firm principle I ever stood; He of my sons who fails to make it good, By one rebellious act renounces to my blood.” “Ah,” said the Hind, “how many sons have you, Who call you mother, whom you never knew! But most of them, who that relation plead, Are such ungracious youths as wish you dead. They gape at rich revenues which you hold, And fain would nibble at your grandame gold; Enquire into your years, and laugh to find Your crazy temper shows you much declined. Were you not dim and doted, you might see A pack of cheats that claim a pedigree, No more of kin to you, than you to me. Do you not know, that, for a little coin, Heralds can foist a name into the line? They ask you blessing but for what you have, But, once possessed of what with care you save, The wanton boys would piss upon your grave. “Your sons of latitude, that court your grace, Though most resembling you in form and face, Are far the worst of your pretended race; And, but I blush your honesty to blot, Pray God you prove them lawfully begot! For, in some Popish libels I have read, The Wolf has been too busy in your bed; At least their hinder parts, the belly-piece, The paunch, and all that Scorpio claims, are his. Their malice too a sore suspicion brings, For, though they dare not bark, they snarl at kings. Nor blame them for intruding in your line; Fat bishoprics are still of right divine. Think you, your new French proselytes are come, To starve abroad, because they starved at home? Your benefices twinkled from afar, They found the new Messiah by the star; Those Swisses fight on any side for pay, And 'tis the living that conforms, not they. Mark with what management their tribes divide; Some stick to you, and some to t'other side, That many churches may for many mouths provide. More vacant pulpits would more converts make; All would have latitude enough to take: The rest unbeneficed your sects maintain; For ordinations, without cures, are vain, And chamber practice is a silent gain. Your sons of breadth at home are much like these; Their soft and yielding metals run with ease; They melt, and take the figure of the mould, But harden and preserve it best in gold.” “Your Delphic sword,” the Panther then replied, “Is double-edged, and cuts on either side. Some sons of mine, who bear upon their shield Three steeples argent in a sable field, Have sharply taxed your converts, who, unfed, Have followed you for miracles of bread; Such, who themselves of no religion are, Allured with gain, for any will declare. Bare lies, with bold assertions, they can face; But dint of argument is out of place. The grim logician puts them in a fright; 'Tis easier far to flourish than to fight. Thus, our eighth Henry's marriage they defame; They say, the schism of beds began the game, Divorcing from the Church to wed the dame; Though largely proved, and by himself professed, That conscience, conscience would not let him rest,— I mean, not till possessed of her he loved, And old, uncharming Catherine was removed. For sundry years before he did complain, And told his ghostly confessor his pain. With the same impudence, without a ground, They say, that, look the reformation round, No treatise of humility is found. But if none were, the gospel does not want; Our Saviour preached it, and I hope you grant, The sermon on the mount was Protestant.” “No doubt,” replied the Hind, “as sure as all The writings of Saint Peter and Saint Paul; On that decision let it stand, or fall. Now for my converts, who, you say, unfed, Have followed me for miracles of bread. Judge not by hearsay, but observe at least, If since their change their loaves have been increased. The Lion buys no converts; if he did, Beasts would be sold as fast as he could bid. Tax those of interest, who conform for gain, Or stay the market of another reign: Your broad-way sons would never be too nice To close with Calvin, if he paid their price; But, raised three steeples higher, would change their note, And quit the cassock for the canting-coat. Now, if you damn this censure, as too bold, Judge by yourselves, and think not others sold. “Meantime, my sons accused, by fame's report, Pay small attendance at the Lion's court, Nor rise with early crowds, nor flatter late; For silently they beg, who daily wait. Preferment is bestowed, that comes unsought; Attendance is a bribe, and then 'tis bought. How they should speed, their fortune is untried; For not to ask, is not to be denied. For what they have, their God and king they bless, And hope they should not murmur, had they less. But if reduced subsistence to implore, In common prudence they would pass your door; Unpitied Hudibras, your champion friend, Has shown how far your charities extend. This lasting verse shall on his tomb be read, ‘He shamed you living, and upbraids you dead.’ “With odious atheist names you load your foes; Your liberal clergy why did I expose? It never fails in charities like those. In climes where true religion is professed, That imputation were no laughing jest; But imprimatur, with a chaplain's name, Is here sufficient licence to defame. What wonder is 't that black detraction thrives? The homicide of names is less than lives; And yet the perjured murderer survives.” This said, she paused a little, and suppressed The boiling indignation of her breast. She knew the virtue of her blade, nor would Pollute her satire with ignoble blood; Her panting foe she saw before her eye, And back she drew the shining weapon dry. So when the generous Lion has in sight His equal match, he rouses for the fight; But when his foe lies prostrate on the plain, He sheathes his paws, uncurls his angry mane, And, pleased with bloodless honours of the day, Walks over, and disdains the inglorious prey. So James, if great with less we may compare, Arrests his rolling thunder-bolts in air; And grants ungrateful friends a lengthened space, To implore the remnants of long-suffering grace. This breathing-time the matron took; and then Resumed the thrid of her discourse again. “Be vengeance wholly left to powers divine, And let heaven judge betwixt your sons and mine: If joys hereafter must be purchased here With loss of all that mortals hold so dear, Then welcome infamy and public shame, And last, a long farewell to worldly fame! 'Tis said with ease, but, oh, how hardly tried By haughty souls to human honour tied! O sharp convulsive pangs of agonising pride! Down then, thou rebel, never more to rise! And what thou didst, and dost, so dearly prize, That fame, that darling fame, make that thy sacrifice. 'Tis nothing thou hast given; then add thy tears For a long race of unrepenting years: 'Tis nothing yet, yet all thou hast to give: Then add those may-be years thou hast to live: Yet nothing still: then poor and naked come, Thy Father will receive his unthrift home, And thy blest Saviour's blood discharge the mighty sum. “Thus,” she pursued, “I discipline a son, Whose unchecked fury to revenge would run; He champs the bit, impatient of his loss, And starts aside, and flounders at the cross. Instruct him better, gracious God, to know, As thine is vengeance, so forgiveness too; That, suffering from ill tongues, he bears no more Than what his sovereign bears, and what his Saviour bore. “It now remains for you to school your child, And ask why God's anointed he reviled; A king and princess dead! did Shimei worse? The curser's punishment should fright the curse; Your son was warned, and wisely gave it o'er, But he, who counselled him, has paid the score; The heavy malice could no higher tend, But woe to him on whom the weights descend. So to permitted ills the demon flies; His rage is aimed at him who rules the skies: Constrained to quit his cause, no succour found, The foe discharges every tire around, In clouds of smoke abandoning the fight, But his own thundering peals proclaim his flight. “In Henry's change his charge as ill succeeds; To that long story little answer needs; Confront but Henry's words with Henry's deeds. Were space allowed, with ease it might be proved, What springs his blessed reformation moved. The dire effects appeared in open sight, Which from the cause he calls a distant flight, And yet no larger leap than from the sun to light. “Now last your sons a double pæan sound, A treatise of humility is found. 'Tis found, but better it had ne'er been sought, Than thus in Protestant procession brought. The famed original through Spain is known, Rodriguez' work, my celebrated son, Which yours, by ill-translating, made his own; Concealed its author, and usurped the name, The basest and ignoblest theft of fame. My altars kindled first that living coal; Restore, or practise better what you stole; That virtue could this humble verse inspire, 'Tis all the restitution I require.” Glad was the Panther that the charge was closed, And none of all her favourite sons exposed; For laws of arms permit each injured man, To make himself a saver where he can. Perhaps the plundered merchant cannot tell The names of pirates in whose hands he fell; But at the den of thieves he justly flies, And every Algerine is lawful prize; No private person in the foe's estate Can plead exemption from the public fate. Yet Christian laws allow not such redress; Then let the greater supersede the less. But let the abettors of the Panther's crime Learn to make fairer wars another time. Some characters may sure be found to write Among her sons; for 'tis no common sight, A spotted dam, and all her offspring white. The savage, though she saw her plea controlled, Yet would not wholly seem to quit her hold, But offered fairly to compound the strife, And judge conversion by the convert's life. “'Tis true,” she said, “I think it somewhat strange, So few should follow profitable change; For present joys are more to flesh and blood, Than a dull prospect of a distant good. 'Twas well alluded by a son of mine, (I hope to quote him is not to purloin,) Two magnets, heaven and earth, allure to bliss; The larger loadstone that, the nearer this: The weak attraction of the greater fails; We nod a while, but neighbourhood prevails; But when the greater proves the nearer too, I wonder more your converts come so slow. Methinks in those who firm with me remain, It shows a nobler principle than gain.” “Your inference would be strong,” the Hind replied, “If yours were in effect the suffering side; Your clergy's sons their own in peace possess, Nor are their prospects in reversion less. My proselytes are struck with awful dread, Your bloody comet-laws hang blazing o'er their head; The respite they enjoy but only lent, The best they have to hope, protracted punishment. Be judge yourself, if interest may prevail, Which motives, yours or mine, will turn the scale. While pride and pomp allure, and plenteous ease, That is, till man's predominant passions cease, Admire no longer at my slow increase. “By education most have been misled; So they believe, because they so were bred. The priest continues what the nurse began, And thus the child imposes on the man. The rest I named before, nor need repeat; But interest is the most prevailing cheat, The sly seducer both of age and youth; They study that, and think they study truth. When interest fortifies an argument, Weak reason serves to gain the will's assent; For souls, already warped, receive an easy bent. “Add long prescription of established laws, And pique of honour to maintain a cause, And shame of change, and fear of future ill, And zeal, the blind conductor of the will; And chief, among the still-mistaking crowd, The fame of teachers obstinate and proud, And, more than all, the private judge allowed; Disdain of fathers which the dance began, And last, uncertain whose the narrower span, The clown unread, and half-read gentleman.” To this the Panther, with a scornful smile;— “Yet still you travail with unwearied toil, And range around the realm without control, Among my sons for proselytes to prowl; And here and there you snap some silly soul. You hinted fears of future change in state; Pray heaven you did not prophesy your fate! Perhaps you think your time of triumph near, But may mistake the season of the year; The Swallow's fortune gives you cause to fear.” “For charity,” replied the matron, “tell What sad mischance those pretty birds befell.” “Nay, no mischance,” the savage dame replied, “But want of wit in their unerring guide, And eager haste, and gaudy hopes, and giddy pride. Yet, wishing timely warning may prevail, Make you the moral, and I'll tell the tale. “The Swallow, privileged above the rest Of all the birds, as man's familiar guest, Pursues the sun, in summer brisk and bold, But wisely shuns the persecuting cold; Is well to chancels and to chimneys known, Though 'tis not thought she feeds on smoke alone. From hence she has been held of heavenly line, Endued with particles of soul divine. This merry chorister had long possessed Her summer-seat, and feathered well her nest; Till frowning skies began to change their cheer, And time turned up the wrong side of the year; The shading trees began the ground to strow With yellow leaves, and bitter blasts to blow. Sad auguries of winter thence she drew, Which by instinct, or prophecy, she knew; When prudence warned her to remove betimes, And seek a better heaven, and warmer climes. “Her sons were summoned on a steeple's height, And, called in common council, vote a flight. The day was named, the next that should be fair; All to the general rendezvous repair, They try their fluttering wings, and trust themselves in air. But whether upward to the moon they go, Or dream the winter out in caves below, Or hawk at flies elsewhere, concerns us not to know. Southwards you may be sure they bent their flight, And harboured in a hollow rock at night; Next morn they rose, and set up every sail; The wind was fair, but blew a mackrel gale; The sickly young sat shivering on the shore, Abhorred salt-water never seen before, And prayed their tender mothers to delay The passage, and expect a fairer day. “With these the Martin readily concurred, A church-begot and church-believing bird; Of little body, but of lofty mind, Round bellied, for a dignity designed, And much a dunce, as Martins are by kind; Yet often quoted canon-laws, and code, And fathers which he never understood; But little learning needs in noble blood. For, sooth to say, the Swallow brought him in, Her household chaplain, and her next of kin; In superstition silly to excess, And casting schemes by planetary guess; In fine, short-winged, unfit himself to fly, His fear foretold foul weather in the sky. Besides, a Raven from a withered oak, Left of their lodging, was observed to croak. That omen liked him not; so his advice Was present safety, bought at any price; A seeming pious care, that covered cowardice. To strengthen this, he told a boding dream, Of rising waters, and a troubled stream, Sure signs of anguish, dangers, and distress, With something more, not lawful to express: By which he slily seemed to intimate Some secret revelation of their fate. For he concluded, once upon a time, He found a leaf inscribed with sacred rhyme, Whose antique characters did well denote The Sibyl's hand of the Cumæan grot; The mad divineress had plainly writ, A time should come, but many ages yet, In which, sinister destinies ordain, A dame should drown with all her feathered train, And seas from thence be called the Chelidonian main. At this, some shook for fear; the more devout Arose, and blessed themselves from head to foot. “'Tis true, some stagers of the wiser sort Made all these idle wonderments their sport; They said their only danger was delay, And he, who heard what every fool could say, Would never fix his thought, but trim his time away. The passage yet was good; the wind, 'tis true, Was somewhat high, but that was nothing new, No more than usual equinoxes blew. The sun, already from the Scales declined, Gave little hopes of better days behind, But change from bad to worse, of weather and of wind. Nor need they fear the dampness of the sky Should flag their wings, and hinder them to fly, 'Twas only water thrown on sails too dry. But, least of all, philosophy presumes Of truth in dreams, from melancholy fumes; Perhaps the Martin, housed in holy ground, Might think of ghosts, that walk their midnight round, Till grosser atoms, tumbling in the stream Of fancy, madly met, and clubbed into a dream: As little weight his vain presages bear, Of ill effect to such alone who fear; Most prophecies are of a piece with these, Each Nostradamus can foretell with ease: Not naming persons, and confounding times, One casual truth supports a thousand lying rhymes. “The advice was true; but fear had seized the most, And all good counsel is on cowards lost. The question crudely put to shun delay, 'Twas carried by the major part to stay. “His point thus gained, Sir Martin dated thence His power, and from a priest became a prince. He ordered all things with a busy care, And cells and refectories did prepare, And large provisions laid of winter fare; But, now and then, let fall a word or two, Of hope, that heaven some miracle might show, And, for their sakes, the sun should backward go; Against the laws of nature upward climb, And, mounted on the Ram, renew the prime; For which two proofs in sacred story lay, Of Ahaz' dial, and of Joshua's day. In expectation of such times as these, A chapel housed them, truly called of ease; For Martin much devotion did not ask; They prayed sometimes, and that was all their task. “It happened, as beyond the reach of wit Blind prophecies may have a lucky hit, That this accomplished, or at least in part, Gave great repute to their new Merlin's art. Some Swifts, Otherwise called “martlets.” the giants of the Swallow kind, Large limbed, stout hearted, but of stupid mind, (For Swisses, or for Gibeonites designed,) These lubbers, peeping through a broken pane, To suck fresh air, surveyed the neighbouring plain, And saw, but scarcely could believe their eyes, New blossoms flourish, and new flowers arise; As God had been abroad, and, walking there, Had left his footsteps, and reformed the year. The sunny hills from far were seen to glow With glittering beams, and in the meads below The burnished brooks appeared with liquid gold to flow. At last they heard the foolish Cuckoo sing, Whose note proclaimed the holiday of spring. “No longer doubting, all prepare to fly, And repossess their patrimonial sky. The priest before them did his wings display; And that good omens might attend their way, As luck would have it, 'twas St. Martin's day. “Who but the Swallow now triumphs alone? The canopy of heaven is all her own; Her youthful offspring to their haunts repair, And glide along in glades, and skim in air, And dip for insects in the purling springs, And stoop on rivers to refresh their wings. Their mother thinks a fair provision made, That every son can live upon his trade, And, now the careful charge is off their hands, Look out for husbands, and new nuptial bands. The youthful widow longs to be supplied; But first the lover is by lawyers tied, To settle jointure-chimneys on the bride. So thick they couple in so short a space, That Martin's marriage-offerings rise apace. Their ancient houses, running to decay, Are furbished up, and cemented with clay: They teem already; store of eggs are laid, And brooding mothers call Lucina's aid. Fame spreads the news, and foreign fowls appear, In flocks, to greet the new returning year, To bless the founder, and partake the cheer. “And now 'twas time, so fast their numbers rise, To plant abroad and people colonies. The youth drawn forth, as Martin had desired, (For so their cruel destiny required,) Were sent far off on an ill-fated day; The rest would needs conduct them on their way, And Martin went, because he feared alone to stay. “So long they flew with inconsiderate haste, That now their afternoon began to waste; And, what was ominous, that very morn The sun was entered into Capricorn; Which, by their bad astronomer's account, That week the Virgin balance should remount. An infant moon eclipsed him in his way, And hid the small remainders of his day. The crowd, amazed, pursued no certain mark, But birds met birds, and jostled in the dark. Few mind the public, in a panic fright, And fear increased the horror of the night. Night came, but unattended with repose; Alone she came, no sleep their eyes to close; Alone, and black she came; no friendly stars arose. “What should they do, beset with dangers round, No neighbouring dorp, no lodging to be found, But bleaky plains, and bare, unhospitable ground? The latter brood, who just began to fly, Sick-feathered, and unpractised in the sky, For succour to their helpless mother call: She spread her wings; some few beneath them crawl; She spread them wider yet, but could not cover all. To augment their woes, the winds began to move, Debate in air for empty fields above, Till Boreas got the skies, and poured amain His rattling hailstones, mixed with snow and rain. “The joyless morning late arose, and found A dreadful desolation reign around, Some buried in the snow, some frozen to the ground. The rest were struggling still with death, and lay The Crows' and Ravens' rights, an undefended prey: Excepting Martin's race; for they and he Had gained the shelter of a hollow tree; But, soon discovered by a sturdy clown, He headed all the rabble of a town, And finished them with bats, or polled them down. Martin himself was caught alive, and tried For treasonous crimes, because the laws provide No Martin there in winter shall abide. High on an oak, which never leaf shall bear, He breathed his last, exposed to open air; And there his corpse unblessed is hanging still, To show the change of winds with his prophetic bill.” The patience of the Hind did almost fail, For well she marked the malice of the tale; Which ribald art their Church to Luther owes; In malice it began, by malice grows; He sowed the serpent's teeth, an iron harvest rose. But most in Martin's character and fate, She saw her slandered sons, the Panther's hate, The people's rage, the persecuting state: Then said, “I take the advice in friendly part; You clear your conscience, or at least your heart. Perhaps you failed in your foreseeing skill, For Swallows are unlucky birds to kill: As for my sons, the family is blessed, Whose every child is equal to the rest; No Church reformed can boast a blameless line, Such Martins build in yours, and more than mine; Or else an old fanatic author lies, Who summed their scandals up by centuries. But through your parable I plainly see The bloody laws, the crowd's barbarity; The sunshine, that offends the purblind sight, Had some their wishes, it would soon be night. Mistake me not; the charge concerns not you; Your sons are malcontents, but yet are true, As far as non-resistance makes them so; But that's a word of neutral sense, you know, A passive term, which no relief will bring, But trims betwixt a rebel and a king.” “Rest well assured,” the Pardalis replied, “My sons would all support the regal side, Though heaven forbid the cause by battle should be tried.” The matron answered with a loud Amen, And thus pursued her argument again:— “If, as you say, and as I hope no less, Your sons will practise what yourselves profess, What angry power prevents our present peace? The Lion, studious of our common good, Desires (and kings' desires are ill withstood) To join our nations in a lasting love; The bars betwixt are easy to remove, For sanguinary laws were never made above. If you condemn that prince of tyranny, Whose mandate forced your Gallic friends to fly, Make not a worse example of your own, Or cease to rail at causeless rigour shown, And let the guiltless person throw the stone. His blunted sword your suffering brotherhood Have seldom felt; he stops it short of blood: But you have ground the persecuting knife, And set it to a razor-edge on life. Cursed be the wit, which cruelty refines, Or to his father's rod the scorpion joins! Your finger is more gross than the great monarch's loins. But you, perhaps, remove that bloody note, And stick it on the first reformers' coat. Oh let their crime in long oblivion sleep; 'Twas theirs indeed to make, 'tis yours to keep! Unjust, or just, is all the question now; 'Tis plain, that, not repealing, you allow. “To name the Test would put you in a rage; You charge not that on any former age, But smile to think how innocent you stand, Armed by a weapon put into your hand. Yet still remember, that you wield a sword, Forged by your foes against your sovereign lord; Designed to hew the imperial cedar down, Defraud succession, and dis-heir the crown. To abhor the makers, and their laws approve, Is to hate traitors, and the treason love. What means it else, which now your children say, We made it not, nor will we take away? “Suppose some great oppressor had, by slight Of law, disseised your brother of his right, Your common sire surrendering in a fright; Would you to that unrighteous title stand, Left by the villain's will to heir the land? More just was Judas, who his Saviour sold; The sacrilegious bribe he could not hold, Nor hang in peace, before he rendered back the gold. What more could you have done, than now you do, Had Oates and Bedloe and their plot been true; Some specious reasons for those wrongs were found; The dire magicians threw their mists around, And wise men walked as on enchanted ground. But now when time has made the imposture plain, (Late though he followed truth, and limping held her train,) What new delusion charms your cheated eyes again? The painted harlot might a while bewitch, But why the hag uncased, and all obscene with itch? “The first reformers were a modest race; Our peers possessed in peace their native place, And when rebellious arms o'erturned the state, They suffered only in the common fate; But now the sovereign mounts the regal chair, And mitred seats are full, yet David's bench is bare. Your answer is, they were not dispossest; They need but rub their metal on the Test To prove their ore;—'twere well if gold alone Were touched and tried on your discerning stone; But that unfaithful test unfound will pass The dross of Atheists, and sectarian brass; As if the experiment were made to hold For base production, and reject the gold. Thus men ungodded may to places rise, And sects may be preferred without disguise; No danger to the Church or State from these, The Papist only has his writ of ease. No gainful office gives him the pretence To grind the subject, or defraud the prince. Wrong conscience, or no conscience, may deserve To thrive, but ours alone is privileged to starve. Still thank yourselves, you cry; your noble race We banish not, but they forsake the place; Our doors are open:—true, but ere they come, You toss your censing test, and fume the room; As if 'twere Toby's rival to expel, And fright the fiend who could not bear the smell.” To this the Panther sharply had replied, But having gained a verdict on her side, She wisely gave the loser leave to chide; Well satisfied to have the butt and peace, And for the plaintiff's cause she cared the less, Because she sued in forma pauperis; Yet thought it decent something should be said, For secret guilt by silence is betrayed; So neither granted all, nor much denied, But answered with a yawning kind of pride: “Methinks such terms of proffered peace you bring, As once Æneas to the Italian king: By long possession all the land is mine; You strangers come with your intruding line, To share my sceptre, which you call to join. You plead like him an ancient pedigree, And claim a peaceful seat by fate's decree. In ready pomp your sacrificer stands, To unite the Trojan and the Latin bands; And, that the league more firmly may be tied, Demand the fair Lavinia for your bride. Thus plausibly you veil the intended wrong, But still you bring your exiled gods along; And will endeavour, in succeeding space, Those household puppets on our hearths to place. Perhaps some barbarous laws have been preferred; I spake against the Test, but was not heard. These to rescind, and peerage to restore, My gracious sovereign would my vote implore; I owe him much, but owe my conscience more.” “Conscience is then your plea,” replied the dame, “Which, well-informed, will ever be the same. But yours is much of the chameleon hue, To change the dye with every distant view. When first the Lion sat with awful sway, Your conscience taught your duty to obey: He might have had your statutes and your Test; No conscience but of subjects was professed. He found your temper, and no farther tried, But on that broken reed, your Church, relied. In vain the sects essayed their utmost art, With offered treasures to espouse their part; Their treasures were a bribe too mean to move his heart. But when, by long experience, you had proved, How far he could forgive, how well he loved; (A goodness that excelled his godlike race, And only short of heaven's unbounded grace; A flood of mercy that o'erflowed our isle, Calm in the rise, and fruitful as the Nile,) Forgetting whence your Egypt was supplied, You thought your sovereign bound to send the tide; Nor upward looked on that immortal spring, But vainly deemed, he durst not be a king. Then Conscience, unrestrained by fear, began To stretch her limits, and extend the span; Did his indulgence as her gift dispose, And made a wise alliance with her foes. Can Conscience own the associating name, And raise no blushes to conceal her shame? For sure she has been thought a bashful dame. But if the cause by battle should be tried, You grant she must espouse the regal side; O Proteus-conscience, never to be tied! What Phœbus from the Tripod shall disclose, Which are, in last resort, your friends or foes? Homer, who learned the language of the sky, The seeming Gordian knot would soon untie; Immortal powers the term of Conscience know, But Interest is her name with men below.” “Conscience or Interest be't, or both in one,” (The Panther answered in a surly tone;) “The first commands me to maintain the crown, The last forbids to throw my barriers down. Our penal laws no sons of yours admit, Our Test excludes your tribe from benefit. These are my banks your ocean to withstand, Which, proudly rising, overlooks the land, And, once let in, with unresisted sway, Would sweep the pastors and their flocks away. Think not my judgment leads me to comply With laws unjust, but hard necessity: Imperious need, which cannot be withstood, Makes ill authentic, for a greater good. Possess your soul with patience, and attend; A more auspicious planet may ascend; Good fortune may present some happier time With means to cancel my unwilling crime; (Unwilling, witness all ye powers above!) To mend my errors, and redeem your love: That little space you safely may allow; Your all-dispensing power protects you now.” “Hold,” said the Hind, “'tis needless to explain; You would postpone me to another reign; Till when, you are content to be unjust: Your part is to possess, and mine to trust; A fair exchange proposed, of future chance For present profit and inheritance. Few words will serve to finish our dispute; Who will not now repeal, would persecute. To ripen green revenge your hopes attend, Wishing that happier planet would ascend. For shame, let Conscience be your plea no more; To will hereafter, proves she might before; But she's a bawd to gain, and holds the door. “Your care about your banks infers a fear Of threatening floods and inundations near; If so, a just reprise would only be Of what the land usurped upon the sea; And all your jealousies but serve to show, Your ground is, like your neighbour-nation, low. To intrench in what you grant unrighteous laws, Is to distrust the justice of your cause; And argues, that the true religion lies In those weak adversaries you despise. Tyrannic force is that which least you fear; The sound is frightful in a Christian's ear: Avert it, Heaven! nor let that plague be sent To us from the dispeopled continent. “But piety commands me to refrain; Those prayers are needless in this monarch's reign. Behold how he protects your friends oppressed, Receives the banished, succours the distressed! Behold, for you may read an honest open breast. He stands in daylight, and disdains to hide An act, to which by honour he is tied, A generous, laudable, and kingly pride. Your Test he would repeal, his peers restore; This when he says he means, he means no more.” “Well,” said the Panther, “I believe him just, And yet—” “And yet, 'tis but because you must; You would be trusted, but you would not trust.” The Hind thus briefly; and disdained to enlarge On power of kings, and their superior charge, As heaven's trustees before the people's choice; Though sure the Panther did not much rejoice To hear those echoes given of her once loyal voice. The matron wooed her kindness to the last, But could not win; her hour of grace was past. Whom, thus persisting, when she could not bring To leave the Wolf, and to believe her king, She gave her up, and fairly wished her joy Of her late treaty with her new ally: Which well she hoped would more successful prove, Than was the Pigeon's and the Buzzard's love. The Panther asked, what concord there could be Betwixt two kinds whose natures disagree? The dame replied: “'Tis sung in every street, The common chat of gossips when they meet; But, since unheard by you, 'tis worth your while To take a wholesome tale, though told in homely style. “A plain good man, whose name is understood, (So few deserve the name of plain and good,) Of three fair lineal lordships stood possessed, And lived, as reason was, upon the best. Inured to hardships from his early youth, Much had he done and suffered for his truth: At land and sea, in many a doubtful fight, Was never known a more adventurous knight, Who oftener drew his sword, and always for the right. “As fortune would, (his fortune came, though late,) He took possession of his just estate; Nor racked his tenants with increase of rent, Nor lived too sparing, nor too largely spent, But overlooked his hinds; their pay was just, And ready, for he scorned to go on trust: Slow to resolve, but in performance quick; So true, that he was awkward at a trick. For little souls on little shifts rely, And coward arts of mean expedients try; The noble mind will dare do anything but lie. False friends, his deadliest foes, could find no way, But shows of honest bluntness, to betray; That unsuspected plainness he believed; He looked into himself, and was deceived. Some lucky planet sure attends his birth, Or heaven would make a miracle on earth; For prosperous honesty is seldom seen To bear so dead a weight, and yet to win. It looks as fate with nature's law would strive, To show plain-dealing once an age may thrive; And, when so tough a frame she could not bend, Exceeded her commission, to befriend. “This grateful man, as heaven increased his store, Gave God again, and daily fed his poor. His house with all convenience was purveyed; The rest he found, but raised the fabric where he prayed; And in that sacred place his beauteous wife Employed her happiest hours of holy life. “Nor did their alms extend to those alone, Whom common faith more strictly made their own; A sort of Doves were housed too near the hall, Who cross the proverb, and abound with gall. Though some, 'tis true, are passively inclined, The greater part degenerate from their kind; Voracious birds, that hotly bill and breed, And largely drink, because on salt they feed. Small gain from them their bounteous owner draws; Yet, bound by promise, he supports their cause, As corporations privileged by laws. “That house, which harbour to their kind affords, Was built long since, God knows, for better birds; But fluttering there, they nestle near the throne, And lodge in habitations not their own, By their high crops and corny gizzards known. Like Harpies, they could scent a plenteous board, Then to be sure they never failed their lord: The rest was form, and bare attendance paid; They drank, and eat, and grudgingly obeyed. The more they fed, they ravened still for more; They drained from Dan, and left Beersheba poor. All this they had by law, and none repined; The preference was but due to Levi's kind: But when some lay-preferment fell by chance, The gourmands made it their inheritance. When once possessed, they never quit their claim, For then 'tis sanctified to heaven's high name; And hallowed thus, they cannot give consent, The gift should be profaned by worldly management. “Their flesh was never to the table served, Though 'tis not thence inferred the birds were starved; But that their master did not like the food, As rank, and breeding melancholy blood. Nor did it with his gracious nature suit, E'en though they were not doves, to persecute: Yet he refused, (nor could they take offence,) Their glutton kind should teach him abstinence. Nor consecrated grain their wheat he thought, Which, new from treading, in their bills they brought; But left his hinds each in his private power, That those who like the bran might leave the flour. He for himself, and not for others, chose, Nor would he be imposed on, nor impose; But in their faces his devotion paid, And sacrifice with solemn rites was made, And sacred incense on his altars laid. “Besides these jolly birds, whose corpse impure Repaid their commons with their salt manure, Another farm he had behind his house, Not overstocked, but barely for his use; Wherein his poor domestic poultry fed, And from his pious hands received their bread. Our pampered Pigeons, with malignant eyes, Beheld these inmates, and their nurseries; Though hard their fare, at evening, and at morn, (A cruse of water and an ear of corn,) Yet still they grudged that modicum, and thought A sheaf in every single grain was brought. Fain would they filch that little food away, While unrestrained those happy gluttons prey; And much they grieved to see so nigh their hall, The bird that warned St. Peter of his fall; That he should raise his mitred crest on high, And clap his wings, and call his family To sacred rites; and vex the ethereal powers With midnight matins at uncivil hours; Nay more, his quiet neighbours should molest, Just in the sweetness of their morning rest. Beast of a bird, supinely when he might Lie snug and sleep, to rise before the light! What if his dull forefathers used that cry, Could he not let a bad example die? The world was fallen into an easier way; This age knew better than to fast and pray. Good sense in sacred worship would appear, So to begin, as they might end the year. Such feats in former times had wrought the falls Of crowing chanticleers in cloistered walls. Expelled for this, and for their lands, they fled; And sister Partlet, with her hooded head, Was hooted hence, because she would not pray abed. The way to win the restiff world to God, Was to lay by the disciplining rod, Unnatural fasts, and foreign forms of prayer; Religion frights us with a mien severe. 'Tis prudence to reform her into ease, And put her in undress, to make her please; A lively faith will bear aloft the mind, And leave the luggage of good works behind. “Such doctrines in the Pigeon-house were taught; You need not ask how wondrously they wrought; But sure the common cry was all for these, Whose life and precepts both encouraged ease. Yet fearing those alluring baits might fail, And holy deeds o'er all their arts prevail, (For vice, though frontless, and of hardened face, Is daunted at the sight of awful grace,) An hideous figure of their foes they drew, Nor lines, nor looks, nor shades, nor colours true; And this grotesque design exposed to public view. One would have thought it an Egyptian piece, With garden-gods, and barking deities, More thick than Ptolemy has stuck the skies. All so perverse a draught, so far unlike, It was no libel where it meant to strike. Yet still the daubing pleased, and great and small, To view the monster, crowded Pigeon-hall. There Chanticleer was drawn upon his knees, Adorning shrines, and stocks of sainted trees; And by him, a misshapen, ugly race, The curse of God was seen on every face: No Holland emblem could that malice mend, But still the worse the look, the fitter for a fiend. “The master of the farm, displeased to find So much of rancour in so mild a kind, Enquired into the cause, and came to know, The passive Church had struck the foremost blow; With groundless fears, and jealousies possest, As if this troublesome intruding guest Would drive the birds of Venus from their nest, A deed his inborn equity abhorred; But interest will not trust, though God should plight his word. “A law, the source of many future harms, Had banished all the poultry from the farms; With loss of life, if any should be found To crow or peck on this forbidden ground. That bloody statute chiefly was designed For Chanticleer the white, of clergy kind; But after-malice did not long forget The lay that wore the robe and coronet. For them, for their inferiors and allies, Their foes a deadly Shibboleth devise; By which unrighteously it was decreed, That none to trust, or profit, should succeed, Who would not swallow first a poisonous wicked weed; Or that, to which old Socrates was cursed, Or henbane juice to swell them till they burst. “The patron, as in reason, thought it hard To see this inquisition in his yard, By which the sovereign was of subjects' use debarred. All gentle means he tried, which might withdraw The effects of so unnatural a law; But still the dove-house obstinately stood Deaf to their own, and to their neighbours' good; And which was worse, if any worse could be, Repented of their boasted loyalty; Now made the champions of a cruel cause, And drunk with fumes of popular applause: For those whom God to ruin has designed, He fits for fate, and first destroys their mind. “New doubts indeed they daily strove to raise, Suggested dangers, interposed delays, And emissary Pigeons had in store, Such as the Meccan prophet used of yore, To whisper counsels in their patron's ear, And veiled their false advice with zealous fear. The master smiled to see them work in vain, To wear him out, and make an idle reign: He saw, but suffered their protractive arts, And strove by mildness to reduce their hearts; But they abused that grace to make allies, And fondly closed with former enemies; For fools are double fools, endeavouring to be wise. “After a grave consult what course were best, One, more mature in folly than the rest, Stood up, and told them, with his head aside, That desperate cures must be to desperate ills applied: And therefore, since their main impending fear Was from the increasing race of Chanticleer, Some potent bird of prey they ought to find, A foe professed to him, and all his kind: Some haggard Hawk, who had her eyry nigh, Well pounced to fasten, and well winged to fly; One they might trust, their common wrongs to wreak. The Musquet and the Coystrel were too weak, Too fierce the Falcon; but, above the rest, The noble Buzzard ever pleased me best: Of small renown, 'tis true; for, not to lie, We call him but a Hawk by courtesy. I know he haunts the Pigeon-house and Farm, And more, in time of war, has done us harm: But all his hate on trivial points depends; Give up our forms, and we shall soon be friends. For Pigeons' flesh he seems not much to care; Crammed Chickens are a more delicious fare. On this high potentate, without delay, I wish you would confer the sovereign sway; Petition him to accept the government, And let a splendid embassy be sent. “This pithy speech prevailed, and all agreed, Old enmities forgot, the Buzzard should succeed. “Their welcome suit was granted, soon as heard, His lodgings furnished, and a train prepared, With B's upon their breast, appointed for his guard. He came, and, crowned with great solemnity, ‘God save king Buzzard!’ was the general cry. “A portly prince, and goodly to the sight, He seemed a son of Anak for his height: Like those whom stature did to crowns prefer, Black-browed, and bluff, like Homer's Jupiter; Broad-backed, and brawny-built for love's delight, A prophet formed to make a female proselyte; A theologue more by need than genial bent, By breeding sharp, by nature confident. Interest in all his actions was discerned; More learned than honest, more a wit than learned; Or forced by fear, or by his profit led, Or both conjoined, his native clime he fled; But brought the virtues of his heaven along, A fair behaviour, and a fluent tongue. And yet with all his arts he could not thrive, The most unlucky parasite alive; Loud praises to prepare his paths he sent, And then himself pursued his compliment; But by reverse of fortune chased away, His gifts no longer than their author stay; He shakes the dust against the ungrateful race, And leaves the stench of ordures in the place. Oft has he flattered and blasphemed the same; For in his rage he spares no sovereign's name: The hero and the tyrant change their style, By the same measure that they frown or smile. When well received by hospitable foes, The kindness he returns, is to expose; For courtesies, though undeserved and great, No gratitude in felon-minds beget; As tribute to his wit, the churl receives the treat. His praise of foes is venomously nice; So touched, it turns a virtue to a vice; ‘A Greek, and bountiful, forewarns us twice.’ Seven sacraments he wisely does disown, Because he knows confession stands for one; Where sins to sacred silence are conveyed, And not for fear, or love, to be betrayed: But he, uncalled, his patron to control, Divulged the secret whispers of his soul; Stood forth the accusing Satan of his crimes, And offered to the Moloch of the times. Prompt to assail, and careless of defence, Invulnerable in his impudence, He dares the world; and, eager of a name, He thrusts about, and jostles into fame. Frontless, and satire-proof, he scours the streets, And runs an Indian-muck at all he meets. So fond of loud report, that, not to miss Of being known, (his last and utmost bliss,) He rather would be known for what he is. “Such was, and is, the Captain of the Test, Though half his virtues are not here expressed; The modesty of fame conceals the rest. The spleenful Pigeons never could create A prince more proper to revenge their hate; Indeed, more proper to revenge, than save; A king, whom in his wrath the Almighty gave: For all the grace the landlord had allowed, But made the Buzzard and the Pigeons proud; Gave time to fix their friends, and to seduce the crowd. They long their fellow-subjects to enthral, Their patron's promise into question call, And vainly think he meant to make them lords of all. “False fears their leaders failed not to suggest, As if the Doves were to be dispossest; Nor sighs, nor groans, nor goggling eyes did want, For now the Pigeons too had learned to cant. The house of prayer is stocked with large increase; Nor doors, nor windows, can contain the press, For birds of every feather fill the abode; E'en atheists out of envy own a God, And, reeking from the stews, adulterers come, Like Goths and Vandals to demolish Rome. That conscience, which to all their crimes was mute, Now calls aloud, and cries to persecute: No rigour of the laws to be released, And much the less, because it was their Lord's request; They thought it great their sovereign to control, And named their pride, nobility of soul. “'Tis true, the Pigeons, and their prince elect, Were short of power, their purpose to effect; But with their quills did all the hurt they could, And cuffed the tender Chickens from their food: And much the Buzzard in their cause did stir, Though naming not the patron, to infer, With all respect, he was a gross idolater. “But when the imperial owner did espy, That thus they turned his grace to villainy, Not suffering wrath to discompose his mind, He strove a temper for the extremes to find, So to be just, as he might still be kind; Then, all maturely weighed, pronounced a doom Of sacred strength for every age to come. By this the Doves their wealth and state possess, No rights infringed, but licence to oppress: Such power have they as factious lawyers long To crowns ascribed, that kings can do no wrong. But since his own domestic birds have tried The dire effects of their destructive pride, He deems that proof a measure to the rest, Concluding well within his kingly breast, His fowls of nature too unjustly were opprest. He therefore makes all birds of every sect Free of his farm, with promise to respect Their several kinds alike, and equally protect. His gracious edict the same franchise yields To all the wild increase of woods and fields, And who in rocks aloof, and who in steeples builds: To Crows the like impartial grace affords, And Choughs and Daws, and such republic birds; Secured with ample privilege to feed, Each has his district, and his bounds decreed; Combined in common interest with his own, But not to pass the Pigeons' Rubicon. “Here ends the reign of this pretended Dove; All prophecies accomplished from above, For Shiloh comes the sceptre to remove. Reduced from her imperial high abode, Like Dionysius to a private rod, The passive Church, that with pretended grace Did her distinctive mark in duty place, Now touched, reviles her Maker to his face. “What after happened is not hard to guess; The small beginnings had a large increase, And arts and wealth succeed the secret spoils of peace. 'Tis said, the Doves repented, though too late, Become the smiths of their own foolish fate: Nor did their owner hasten their ill hour, But, sunk in credit, they decreased in power; Like snows in warmth that mildly pass away, Dissolving in the silence of decay. “The Buzzard, not content with equal place, Invites the feathered Nimrods of his race, To hide the thinness of their flock from sight, And all together make a seeming goodly flight: But each have separate interests of their own; Two Czars are one too many for a throne. Nor can the usurper long abstain from food; Already he has tasted Pigeon's blood, And may be tempted to his former fare, When this indulgent lord shall late to heaven repair. Bare benting times, and moulting months may come, When, lagging late, they cannot reach their home; Or rent in schism, (for so their fate decrees,) Like the tumultuous college of the bees, They fight their quarrel, by themselves opprest, The tyrant smiles below, and waits the falling feast.” Thus did the gentle Hind her fable end, Nor would the Panther blame it, nor commend; But, with affected yawnings at the close, Seemed to require her natural repose; For now the streaky light began to peep, And setting stars admonished both to sleep. The Dame withdrew, and, wishing to her guest The peace of heaven, betook herself to rest: Ten thousand angels on her slumbers wait, With glorious visions of her future state. BRITANNIA REDIVIVA: A POEM ON THE BIRTH OF THE PRINCE. Di patrii indigetes, et Romule, Vestaque mater, Quæ Tuscum Tyberim et Romana palatia servas, Hunc saltem everso puerum succurrere sæclo Ne prohibete! satis jampridem sanguine nostro Laomedonteæ luimus perjuria Trojæ. Virg. Georg. 1. Our vows are heard betimes, and heaven takes care To grant, before we can conclude the prayer; Preventing angels met it half the way, And sent us back to praise, who came to pray. Just on the day, when the high-mounted sun Did farthest in his northern progress run, The 10th of June. He bended forward, and even stretched the sphere Beyond the limits of the lengthened year, To view a brighter sun in Britain born; That was the business of his longest morn; The glorious object seen, 'twas time to turn. Departing spring could only stay to shed Her bloomy beauties on the genial bed, But left the manly summer in her stead, With timely fruit the longing land to cheer, And to fulfil the promise of the year. Betwixt two seasons comes the auspicious heir, This age to blossom, and the next to bear. Last solemn Sabbath Whitsunday. saw the Church attend, The Paraclete in fiery pomp descend; But when his wondrous octave rolled again, He brought a royal infant in his train: So great a blessing to so good a king, None but the Eternal Comforter could bring. Or did the mighty Trinity conspire, As once in council to create our sire? It seems as if they sent the new-born guest, To wait on the procession of their feast; And on their sacred anniverse decreed To stamp their image on the promised seed. Three realms united, and on one bestowed, An emblem of their mystic union showed; The Mighty Trine the triple empire shared, As every person would have one to guard. Hail, son of prayers! by holy violence Drawn down from heaven; but long be banished thence, And late to thy paternal skies retire! To mend our crimes, whole ages would require; To change the inveterate habit of our sins, And finish what thy godlike sire begins. Kind heaven, to make us Englishmen again, No less can give us than a patriarch's reign. The sacred cradle to your charge receive, Ye seraphs, and by turns the guard relieve; Thy father's angel, and thy father join, To keep possession, and secure the line; But long defer the honours of thy fate; Great may they be like his, like his be late, That James this running century may view, And give this son an auspice to the new. Our wants exact at least that moderate stay; For, see the dragon Alluding only to the Commonwealth party here, and in other places of the poem. Revel. xii. v. 4. winged on his way, To watch the travail, and devour the prey: Or, if allusions may not rise so high, Thus, when Alcides raised his infant cry, The snakes besieged his young divinity; But vainly with their forked tongues they threat, For opposition makes a hero great. To needful succour all the good will run, And Jove assert the godhead of his son. O still repining at your present state, Grudging yourselves the benefits of fate; Look up, and read in characters of light A blessing sent you in your own despite! The manna falls, yet that celestial bread, Like Jews, you munch, and murmur while you feed. May not your fortune be, like theirs, exiled, Yet forty years to wander in the wild! Or, if it be, may Moses live at least, To lead you to the verge of promised rest! Though poets are not prophets, to foreknow What plants will take the blight, and what will grow, By tracing heaven, his footsteps may be found; Behold, how awfully he walks the round! God is abroad, and, wondrous in his ways, The rise of empires, and their fall, surveys; More, might I say, than with an usual eye, He sees his bleeding Church in ruins lie, And hears the souls of saints beneath his altar cry. Already has he lifted high the sign, Which crowned the conquering arms of Constantine. The Cross. The moon The Crescent, which the Turks bear for their arms. grows pale at that presaging sight, And half her train of stars have lost their light. Behold another Sylvester, The Pope in the time of Constantine the Great; alluding to the present Pope. to bless The sacred standard, and secure success; Large of his treasures, of a soul so great, As fills and crowds his universal seat. Now view at home a second Constantine; King James II. (The former too was of the British line,) Has not his healing balm your breaches closed, Whose exile many sought, and few opposed? O, did not Heaven, by its eternal doom, Permit those evils, that this good might come? So manifest, that even the moon-eyed sects See whom and what this Providence protects. Methinks, had we within our minds no more Than that one shipwrack on the fatal Ore, The Lemmon Ore. That only thought may make us think again, What wonders God reserves for such a reign. To dream, that chance his preservation wrought, Were to think Noah was preserved for nought; Or the surviving eight were not designed To people earth, and to restore their kind. When humbly on the royal babe we gaze, The manly lines of a majestic face Give awful joy; 'tis paradise to look On the fair frontispiece of nature's book: If the first opening page so charms the sight, Think how the unfolded volume will delight! See how the venerable infant lies In early pomp; how through the mother's eyes The father's soul, with an undaunted view, Looks out, and takes our homage as his due! See on his future subjects how he smiles, Nor meanly flatters, nor with craft beguiles; But with an open face, as on his throne, Assures our birthrights, and assumes his own. Born in broad day-light, that the ungrateful rout May find no room for a remaining doubt; Truth, which itself is light, does darkness shun, And the true eaglet safely dares the sun. Fain Alluding to the temptations in the wilderness. would the fiends have made a dubious birth, Loath to confess the godhead clothed in earth; But, sickened, after all their baffled lies, To find an heir apparent of the skies, Abandoned to despair, still may they grudge, And, owning not the Saviour, prove the judge. Not great Æneas stood in plainer day, Virg. Æn. i. When the dark mantling mist dissolved away; He to the Tyrians showed his sudden face, Shining with all his goddess mother's grace; For she herself had made his countenance bright, Breathed honour on his eyes, and her own purple light. If our victorious Edward, Edward the Black Prince, born on Trinity Sunday. as they say, Gave Wales a prince on that propitious day, Why may not years revolving with his fate Produce his like, but with a longer date; One, who may carry to a distant shore The terror that his famed forefather bore? But why should James, or his young hero, stay For slight presages of a name or day? We need no Edward's fortune to adorn That happy moment when our prince was born; Our prince adorns this day, and ages hence Shall wish his birthday for some future prince. Great Michael, The motto of the poem explained. prince of all the ethereal hosts, And whate'er inborn saints our Britain boasts; And thou, the adopted patron St. George. of our isle, With cheerful aspects on this infant smile! The pledge of heaven, which, dropping from above, Secures our bliss, and reconciles his love. Enough of ills our dire rebellion wrought, When to the dregs we drank the bitter draught; Then airy atoms did in plagues conspire, Nor did the avenging angel yet retire, But purged our still-increasing crimes with fire. Then perjured plots, the still impending test, And worse—but charity conceals the rest. Here stop the current of the sanguine flood; Require not, gracious God! thy martyrs' blood; But let their dying pangs, their living toil, Spread a rich harvest through their native soil; A harvest ripening for another reign, Of which this royal babe may reap the grain. Enough of early saints one womb has given, Enough increased the family of heaven; Let them for his and our atonement go, And, reigning blest above, leave him to rule below. Enough already has the year foreslowed His wonted course, the sea has overflowed, The meads were floated with a weeping spring, And frightened birds in woods forgot to sing; The strong-limbed steed beneath his harness faints, And the same shivering sweat his lord attaints. When will the minister of wrath give o'er? Behold him at Araunah's threshing-floor! Alluding to the passage in the First Book of Kings, ch. xxiv. v. 20th. He stops, and seems to sheathe his flaming brand, Pleased with burnt incense from our David's hand; David has bought the Jebusite's abode, And raised an altar to the living God. Heaven, to reward him, makes his joys sincere; No future ills nor accidents appear, To sully and pollute the sacred infant's year. Five months to discord and debate were given; He sanctifies the yet remaining seven. Sabbath of months! henceforth in him be blest, And prelude to the realms perpetual rest! Let his baptismal drops for us atone; Original sin. Lustrations for offences not his own: Let conscience, which is interest ill disguised, In the same font be cleansed, and all the land baptized. Unnamed The Prince christened, but not named. as yet; at least unknown to fame; Is there a strife in heaven about his name, Where every famous predecessor vies, And makes a faction for it in the skies? Or must it be reserved to thought alone? Such was the sacred Tetragrammaton. Jehovah, or the name of God, unlawful to be pronounced by the Jews. Things worthy silence must not be revealed; Thus the true name of Rome Some authors say that the true name of Rome was kept a secret, ne hostes incantamentis deos elicerent. was kept concealed, To shun the spells and sorceries of those Who durst her infant majesty oppose. But when his tender strength in time shall rise To dare ill tongues, and fascinating eyes, This isle, which hides the little Thunderer's fame, Shall be too narrow to contain his name: The artillery of heaven shall make him known; Crete Candia, where Jupiter was born and lived secretly. could not hold the god, when Jove was grown. As Jove's increase, Pallas, or Minerva, said by the poets to have been bred up by hand. who from his brain was born, Whom arms and arts did equally adorn, Free of the breast was bred, whose milky taste Minerva's name to Venus had debased; So this imperial babe rejects the food, That mixes monarch's with plebeian blood: Food that his inborn courage might control, Extinguish all the father in his soul, And for his Estian race, and Saxon strain, Might reproduce some second Richard's reign. Mildness he shares from both his parents' blood; But kings too tame are despicably good: Be this the mixture of this regal child, By nature manly, but by virtue mild. Thus far the furious transport of the news Had to prophetic madness fired the muse; Madness ungovernable, uninspired, Swift to foretell whatever she desired. Was it for me the dark abyss to tread, And read the book which angels cannot read? How was I punished, when the sudden blast The sudden false report of the Prince's death. The face of heaven, and our young sun, o'ercast! Fame, the swift ill increasing as she rolled, Disease, despair, and death, at three reprises told: At three insulting strides she stalked the town, And, like contagion, struck the loyal down. Down fell the winnowed wheat; but, mounted high, The whirlwind bore the chaff, and hid the sky. Here black rebellion shooting from below, (As earth's gigantic brood by moments grow,) Those giants are feigned to have grown fifteen ells every day. And here the sons of God are petrified with woe: An apoplex of grief! so low were driven The saints, as hardly to defend their heaven. As, when pent vapours run their hollow round, Earthquakes, which are convulsions of the ground, Break bellowing forth, and no confinement brook, Till the third settles what the former shook; Such heavings had our souls, till, slow and late, Our life with his returned, and faith prevailed on fate. By prayers the mighty blessing was implored, To prayers was granted, and by prayers restored. So, ere the Shunamite a son conceived, The prophet promised, and the wife believed; A son was sent, the son so much desired, But soon upon the mother's knees expired. The troubled seer approached the mournful door, Ran, prayed, and sent his pastoral staff before, Then stretched his limbs upon the child, and mourned, Till warmth, and breath, and a new soul returned. In the Second Book of Kings, chap. 3. Thus Mercy stretches out her hand, and saves Desponding Peter, sinking in the waves. As when a sudden storm of hail and rain Beats to the ground the yet unbearded grain, Think not the hopes of harvest are destroyed On the flat field, and on the naked void; The light, unloaded stem, from tempest freed, Will raise the youthful honours of his head; And, soon restored by native vigour, bear The timely product of the bounteous year. Nor yet conclude all fiery trials past, For heaven will exercise us to the last; Sometimes will check us in our full career, With doubtful blessings, and with mingled fear, That, still depending on his daily grace, His every mercy for an alms may pass; With sparing hands will diet us to good, Preventing surfeits of our pampered blood. So feeds the mother bird her craving young With little morsels, and delays them long. True, this last blessing was a royal feast; But where's the wedding-garment on the guest? Our manners, as religion were a dream, Are such as teach the nations to blaspheme. In lusts we wallow, and with pride we swell, And injuries with injuries repel; Prompt to revenge, not daring to forgive, Our lives unteach the doctrine we believe. Thus Israel sinned, impenitently hard, And vainly thought the present ark their guard; 1 Samuel, chap. iv., v. 10. But when the haughty Philistines appear, They fled, abandoned to their foes and fear; Their God was absent, though his ark was there. Ah! lest our crimes should snatch this pledge away, And make our joys the blessings of a day! For we have sinned him hence, and that he lives, God to his promise, not our practice, gives. Our crimes would soon weigh down the guilty scale, But James and Mary, and the Church prevail. Nor Amalek Exodus, chap. xvii., v. 8. can rout the chosen bands, While Hur and Aaron hold up Moses' hands. By living well, let us secure his days, Moderate in hopes, and humble in our ways. No force the free-born spirit can constrain, But charity, and great examples gain. Forgiveness is our thanks for such a day; 'Tis godlike God in his own coin to pay. But you, propitious queen, translated here, From your mild heaven, to rule our rugged sphere, Beyond the sunny walks, and circling year; You, who your native climate have bereft Of all the virtues, and the vices left; Whom piety and beauty make their boast, Though beautiful is well in pious lost; So lost as star-light is dissolved away, And melts into the brightness of the day; Or gold about the royal diadem, Lost, to improve the lustre of the gem,— What can we add to your triumphant day? Let the great gift the beauteous giver pay; For should our thanks awake the risingsun, And lengthen, as his latest shadows run, That, though the longest day, would soon, too soon be done. Let angels' voices with their harps conspire, But keep the auspicious infant from the choir; Late let him sing above, and let us know No sweeter music than his cries below. Nor can I wish to you, great monarch, more Than such an annual income to your store; The day, which gave this unit, did not shine For a less omen, than to fill the trine. After a prince, an admiral beget; The Royal Sovereign wants an anchor yet. Our isle has younger titles still in store, And when the exhausted land can yield no more, Your line can force them from a foreign shore. The name of Great your martial mind will suit; But justice is your darling attribute: Of all the Greeks, 'twas but one hero's due, Aristides. See his Life in Plutarch. And, in him, Plutarch prophesied of you. A prince's favours but on few can fall, But justice is a virtue shared by all. Some kings the name of conquerors have assumed, Some to be great, some to be gods presumed; But boundless power, and arbitrary lust, Made tyrants still abhor the name of Just; They shunned the praise this godlike virtue gives And feared a title that reproached their lives. The power, from which all kings derive their state, Whom they pretend, at least, to imitate, Is equal both to punish and reward; For few would love their God, unless they feared. Resistless force and immortality Make but a lame, imperfect deity; Tempests have force unbounded to destroy, And deathless being even the damned enjoy; And yet heaven's attributes, both last and first; One without life, and one with life accurst; But justice is heaven's self, so strictly he, That could it fail, the godhead could not be. This virtue is your own; but life and state Are, one to fortune subject, one to fate: Equal to all, you justly frown or smile; Nor hopes nor fears your steady hand beguile; Yourself our balance hold, the world's our isle. PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES. PROLOGUE SPOKEN THE FIRST DAY OF THE KING'S HOUSE ACTING AFTER THE FIRE. So shipwracked passengers escape to land, So look they, when on the bare beach they stand, Dropping and cold, and their first fear scarce o'er, Expecting famine on a desert shore. From that hard climate we must wait for bread, Whence even the natives, forced by hunger, fled. Our stage does human chance present to view, But ne'er before was seen so sadly true: You are changed too, and your pretence to see Is but a nobler name for charity. Your own provisions furnish out our feasts, While you, the founders, make yourselves the guests. Of all mankind beside, fate had some care, But for poor Wit no portion did prepare, 'Tis left a rent-charge to the brave and fair. You cherished it, and now its fall you mourn, Which blind unmannered zealots make their scorn, Who think that fire a judgment on the stage, Which spared not temples in its furious rage. But as our new-built city rises higher, So from old theatres may new aspire, Since fate contrives magnificence by fire. Our great metropolis does far surpass Whate'er is now, and equals all that was: Our wit as far does foreign wit excel, And, like a king, should in a palace dwell. But we with golden hopes are vainly fed Talk high, and entertain you in a shed: Your presence here, for which we humbly sue Will grace old theatres, and build up new. PROLOGUE FOR THE WOMEN, WHEN THEY ACTED AT THE OLD THEATRE, LINCOLN'S-INN-FIELDS. Were none of you, gallants, e'er driven so hard, As when the poor kind soul was under guard, And could not do 't at home, in some by-street To take a lodging, and in private meet? Such is our case; we can't appoint our house, The lovers' old and wonted rendezvous, But hither to this trusty nook remove; The worse the lodging is, the more the love. For much good pastime, many a dear sweet hug, Is stolen in garrets, on the humble rug. Here's good accommodation in the pit; The grave demurely in the midst may sit, And so the hot Burgundian on the side, Ply vizard mask, and o'er the benches stride: Here are convenient upper boxes too, For those that make the most triumphant show; All, that keep coaches, must not sit below. There, gallants, you betwixt the acts retire, And, at dull plays, have something to admire: We, who look up, can your addresses mark, And see the creatures coupled in the ark: So we expect the lovers, braves, and wits; The gaudy house with scenes will serve for cits. PROLOGUE SPOKEN AT THE OPENING OF THE NEW HOUSE, March 26, 1674. A plain-built house, after so long a stay, Will send you half unsatisfied away; When, fallen from your expected pomp, you find A bare convenience only is designed. You, who each day can theatres behold, Like Nero's palace, shining all with gold, Our mean ungilded stage will scorn, we fear, And, for the homely room, disdain the cheer. Yet now cheap druggets to a mode are grown, And a plain suit, since we can make but one, Is better than to be by tarnished gawdry known. They, who are by your favours wealthy made, With mighty sums may carry on the trade; We, broken bankers, half destroyed by fire, With our small stock to humble roofs retire; Pity our loss, while you their pomp admire. For fame and honour we no longer strive; We yield in both, and only beg—to live; Unable to support their vast expense, Who build and treat with such magnificence, That, like the ambitious monarchs of the age, They give the law to our provincial stage. Great neighbours enviously promote excess, While they impose their splendour on the less; But only fools, and they of vast estate, The extremity of modes will imitate, The dangling knee-fringe, and the bib-cravat. Yet if some pride with want may be allowed, We in our plainness may be justly proud; Our Royal Master willed it should be so; Whate 'er he's pleased to own, can need no show: That sacred name gives ornament and grace, And, like his stamp, makes basest metal pass. 'Twere folly now a stately pile to raise, To build a playhouse while you throw down plays; While scenes, machines, and empty operas reign, And for the pencil you the pen disdain; While troops of famished Frenchmen hither drive, And laugh at those upon whose alms they live: Old English authors vanish, and give place To these new conquerors of the Norman race. More tamely than your fathers you submit; You're now grown vassals to them in your wit. Mark, when they play, how our fine fops advance The mighty merits of their men of France, Keep time, cry Ben! and humour the cadence. Well, please yourselves; but sure 'tis understood, That French machines have ne'er done England good. I would not prophesy our house's fate; But while vain shows and scenes you overrate, 'Tis to be feared— That, as a fire the former house o'erthrew, Machines and tempests will destroy the new. EPILOGUE ON THE SAME OCCASION. Though what our Prologue said was sadly true, Yet, gentlemen, our homely house is new, A charm that seldom fails with wicked you. A country lip may have the velvet touch; Though she's no lady, you may think her such: A strong imagination may do much. But you, loud sirs, who through your curls look big, Critics in plume and white vallancy wig, Who, lolling, on our foremost benches sit, And still charge first, the true forlorn of wit; Whose favours, like the sun, warm where you roll, Yet you, like him, have neither heat nor soul; So may your hats your foretops never press, Untouched your ribbons, sacred be your dress; So may you slowly to old age advance, And have the excuse of youth for ignorance; So may fop-corner full of noise remain, And drive far off the dull, attentive train; So may your midnight scourings happy prove, And morning batteries force your way to love; So may not France your warlike hands recall, But leave you by each other's swords to fall, As you come here to ruffle vizard punk, When sober rail, and roar when you are drunk. But to the wits we can some merit plead, And urge what by themselves has oft been said: Our house relieves the ladies from the frights Of ill-paved streets, and long dark winter nights; The Flanders horses from a cold bleak road, Where bears in furs dare scarcely look abroad; The audience from worn plays and fustian stuff, Of rhyme, more nauseous than three boys in buff. Though in their house the poets' heads appear, We hope we may presume their wits are here. The best which they reserved they now will play, For, like kind cuckolds, though we've not the way To please, we'll find you abler men who may. If they should fail, for last recruits we breed A troop of frisking monsieurs to succeed: You know the French sure cards at time of need. PROLOGUE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, 1674. SPOKEN BY MR. HART. Poets, your subjects, have their parts assigned, To unbend, and to divert their sovereign's mind; When tired with following nature, you think fit To seek repose in the cool shades of wit, And from the sweet retreat, with joy survey What rests, and what is conquered, of the way. Here, free yourselves from envy, care, and strife, You view the various turns of human life; Safe in our scene, through dangerous courts you go, And, undebauched, the vice of cities know. Your theories are here to practice brought, As in mechanic operations wrought; And man, the little world, before you set, As once the sphere of crystal showed the great. Blest sure are you above all mortal kind, If to your fortunes you can suit your mind; Content to see, and shun, those ills we show, And crimes on theatres alone to know. With joy we bring what our dead authors writ, And beg from you the value of their wit: That Shakespeare's, Fletcher's, and great Jonson's claim, May be renewed from those who gave them fame. None of our living poets dare appear; For muses so severe are worshipped here, That, conscious of their faults, they shun the eye, And, as profane, from sacred places fly, Rather than see the offended God, and die. We bring no imperfections, but our own; Such faults as made are by the makers shown; And you have been so kind, that we may boast, The greatest judges still can pardon most. Poets must stoop, when they would please our pit, Debased even to the level of their wit; Disdaining that, which yet they know will take, Hating themselves what their applause must make. But when to praise from you they would aspire, Though they, like eagles, mount, your Jove is higher. So far your knowledge all their power transcends, As what should be, beyond what is, extends. EPILOGUE SPOKEN AT OXFORD, BY MRS. MARSHALL. Oft has our poet wished, this happy seat Might prove his fading muse's last retreat: I wondered at his wish, but now I find He sought for quiet, and content of mind; Which noiseful towns, and courts, can never know, And only in the shades, like laurels, grow. Youth, ere it sees the world, here studies rest, And age, returning thence, concludes it best. What wonder if we court that happiness Yearly to share, which hourly you possess, Teaching e'en you, while the vext world we show, Your peace to value more, and better know? 'Tis all we can return for favours past, Whose holy memory shall ever last, For patronage from him whose care presides O'er every noble art, and every science guides; Bathurst, a name the learned with reverence know, And scarcely more to his own Virgil owe; Whose age enjoys but what his youth deserved, To rule those muses whom before he served. His learning, and untainted manners too, We find, Athenians, are derived to you; Such ancient hospitality there rests In yours, as dwelt in the first Grecian breasts, Whose kindness was religion to their guests. Such modesty did to our sex appear, As, had there been no laws, we need not fear, Since each of you was our protector here. Converse so chaste, and so strict virtue shown, As might Apollo with the muses own. Till our return, we must despair to find Judges so just, so knowing, and so kind. ORIGINAL PROLOGUE TO CIRCE, BY DR. CHARLES D'AVENANT, 1675. Were you but half so wise as you're severe, Our youthful poet should not need to fear; To his green years your censures you would suit, Not blast the blossom, but expect the fruit. The sex, that best does pleasure understand, Will always choose to err on t'other hand. They check not him that's awkward in delight, But clap the young rogue's cheek, and set him right. Thus heartened well, and fleshed upon his prey, The youth may prove a man another day. For your own sakes, instruct him when he's out, You'll find him mend his work at every bout. When some young lusty thief is passing by, How many of your tender kind will cry, “A proper fellow! pity he should die! He might be saved, and thank us for our pains, There's such a stock of love within his veins.” These arguments the women may persuade, But move not you, the brothers of the trade, Who, scattering your infection through the pit, With aching hearts and empty purses sit, To take your dear five shillings' worth of wit. The praise you give him, in your kindest mood, Comes dribbling from you, just like drops of blood; And then you clap so civilly, for fear The loudness might offend your neighbour's ear, That we suspect your gloves are lined within, For silence sake, and cotton'd next the skin. From these usurpers we appeal to you, The only knowing, only judging few; You, who in private have this play allowed, Ought to maintain your suffrage to the crowd. The captive, once submitted to your bands, You should protect from death by vulgar hands. PROLOGUE TO CIRCE, AS CORRECTED BY DRYDEN. Were you but half so wise as you're severe, Our youthful poet should not need to fear; To his green years your censures you would suit, Not blast the blossom, but expect the fruit. The sex, that best does pleasure understand, Will always choose to err on t'other hand. They check not him that's awkward in delight, But clap the young rogue's cheek, and set him right. Thus heartened well, and fleshed upon his prey, The youth may prove a man another day. Your Ben and Fletcher, in their first young flight, Did no Volpone, no Arbaces write; But hopped about, and short excursions made From bough to bough, as if they were afraid, And each was guilty of some Slighted Maid. Shakespeare's own muse her Pericles first bore; The Prince of Tyre was elder than the Moor: 'Tis miracle to see a first good play; All hawthorns do not bloom on Christmas Day. A slender poet must have time to grow, And spread and burnish as his brothers do. Who still looks lean, sure with some pox is curst, But no man can be Falstaff-fat at first. Then damn not, but indulge his rude essays, Encourage him, and bloat him up with praise, That he may get more bulk before he dies; He's not yet fed enough for sacrifice. Perhaps, if now your grace you will not grudge, He may grow up to write, and you to judge. EPILOGUE, INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY THE LADY HEN. MAR. WENTWORTH, WHEN CALISTO WAS ACTED AT COURT, IN 1675. As Jupiter I made my court in vain; I'll now assume my native shape again. I'm weary to be so unkindly used, And would not be a god, to be refused. State grows uneasy when it hinders love; A glorious burden, which the wise remove. Now, as a nymph, I need not sue, nor try The force of any lightning but the eye. Beauty and youth, more than a god command; No Jove could e'er the force of these withstand. 'Tis here that sovereign power admits dispute; Beauty sometimes is justly absolute. Our sullen Catos, whatsoe'er they say, Even while they frown and dictate laws, obey. You, mighty sir, our bonds more easy make, And, gracefully, what all must suffer, take; Above those forms the grave affect to wear, For 'tis not to be wise to be severe. True wisdom may some gallantry admit, And soften business with the charms of wit. These peaceful triumphs with your cares you bought, And from the midst of fighting nations brought. You only hear it thunder from afar, And sit, in peace, the arbiter of war: Peace, the loathed manna, which hot brains despise, You knew its worth, and made it early prize; And in its happy leisure, sit and see The promises of more felicity; Two glorious nymphs of your own godlike line, Whose morning rays, like noontide, strike and shine; Whom you to suppliant monarchs shall dispose, To bind your friends, and to disarm your foes. EPILOGUE TO THE MAN OF MODE; OR, SIR FOPLING FLUTTER, BY SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE, 1676. Most modern wits such monstrous fools have shown, They seem not of heaven's making, but their own. Those nauseous Harlequins in farce may pass; But there goes more to a substantial ass: Something of man must be exposed to view, That, gallants, they may more resemble you. Sir Fopling is a fool so nicely writ, The ladies would mistake him for a wit; And, when he sings, talks loud, and cocks, would cry, I vow, methinks, he's pretty company! So brisk, so gay, so travelled, so refined, As he took pains to graff upon his kind. True fops help nature's work, and go to school, To fill and finish God Almighty's fool. Yet none Sir Fopling him, or him can call; He's knight o' the shire, and represents ye all. From each he meets he culls whate'er he can; Legion's his name, a people in a man. His bulky folly gathers as it goes, And, rolling o'er you, like a snow-ball grows. His various modes from various fathers follow; One taught the toss, and one the new French wallow; His sword-knot this, his cravat that designed; And this the yard-long snake he twirls behind. From one the sacred periwig he gained, Which wind ne'er blew, nor touch of hat profaned. Another's diving bow he did adore, Which with a shog casts all the hair before, Till he, with full decorum, brings it back, And rises with a water-spaniel shake. As for his songs, the ladies' dear delight, These sure he took from most of you who write. Yet every man is safe from what he feared; For no one fool is hunted from the herd. EPILOGUE TO MITHRIDATES, KING OF PONTUS, BY MR. N. LEE, 1678. You've seen a pair of faithful lovers die; And much you care; for most of you will cry, 'Twas a just judgment on their constancy. For, heaven be thanked, we live in such an age, When no man dies for love but on the stage: And e'en those martyrs are but rare in plays; A cursed sign how much true faith decays. Love is no more a violent desire; 'Tis a mere metaphor, a painted fire. In all our sex, the name examined well, 'Tis pride to gain, and vanity to tell. In woman, 'tis of subtle interest made; Curse on the punk, that made it first a trade! She first did wit's prerogative remove, And make a fool presume to prate of love. Let honour and preferment go for gold, But glorious beauty is not to be sold; Or, if it be, 'tis at a rate so high, That nothing but adoring it should buy. Yet the rich cullies may their boasting spare; They purchase but sophisticated ware. 'Tis prodigality that buys deceit, Where both the giver and the taker cheat. Men but refine on the old half-crown way; And women fight, like Swizzers, for their pay. PROLOGUE TO THE TRUE WIDOW. BY THOMAS SHADWELL, 1678. Heaven save ye, gallants, and this hopeful age! Y' are welcome to the downfall of the stage. The fools have laboured long in their vocation, And vice, the manufacture of the nation, O'erstocks the town so much, and thrives so well, That fops and knaves grow drugs, and will not sell. In vain our wares on theatres are shown, When each has a plantation of his own. His cruse ne'er fails; for whatsoe'er he spends, There's still God's plenty for himself and friends. Should men be rated by poetic rules, Lord, what a poll would there be raised from fools! Meantime poor wit prohibited must lie, As if 'twere made some French commodity. Fools you will have, and raised at vast expense; And yet, as soon as seen, they give offence. Time was, when none would cry,—That oaf was me; But now you strive about your pedigree. Bauble and cap no sooner are thrown down, But there's a muss of more than half the town. Each one will challenge a child's part at least; A sign the family is well increased. Of foreign cattle there's no longer need, When we're supplied so fast with English breed. Well! flourish, countrymen; drink, swear, and roar; Let every free-born subject keep his whore, And wandering in the wilderness about, At end of forty years not wear her out. But when you see these pictures, let none dare To own beyond a limb, or single share; For where the punk is common, he's a sot, Who needs will father what the parish got. PROLOGUE TO CÆSAR BORGIA. BY MR. N. LEE, 1680. The unhappy man, who once has trailed a pen, Lives not to please himself, but other men; Is always drudging, wastes his life and blood, Yet only eats and drinks what you think good. What praise soe'er the poetry deserve, Yet every fool can bid the poet starve. That fumbling lecher to revenge is bent, Because he thinks himself, or whore, is meant: Name but a cuckold, all the city swarms; From Leadenhall to Ludgate is in arms. Were there no fear of Antichrist, or France, In the best time poor poets live by chance. Either you come not here, or, as you grace Some old acquaintance, drop into the place, Careless and qualmish with a yawning face: You sleep o'er wit,—and by my troth you may; Most of your talents lie another way. You love to hear of some prodigious tale, The bell that tolled alone, or Irish whale. News is your food, and you enough provide, Both for yourselves, and all the world beside. One theatre there is, of vast resort, Which whilome of Requests was called the Court; But now the great exchange of news 'tis hight, And full of hum and buzz from noon till night. Up stairs and down you run, as for a race, And each man wears three nations in his face. So big you look, though claret you retrench, That, armed with bottled ale, you huff the French. But all your entertainment still is fed By villains in our own dull island bred. Would you return to us, we dare engage To show you better rogues upon the stage. You know no poison but plain ratsbane here; Death's more refined, and better bred elsewhere. They have a civil way in Italy, By smelling a perfume to make you die; A trick would make you lay your snuff-box by. Murder's a trade, so known and practised there, That 'tis infallible as is the chair. But mark their feasts, you shall behold such pranks! The Pope says grace, but 'tis the devil gives thanks. PROLOGUE TO SOPHONISBA; SPOKEN AT OXFORD, 1680. Thespis, the first professor of our art, At country wakes, sung ballads from a cart. To prove this true, if Latin be no trespass, Dicitur et plaustris vexisse poemata Thespis. But Æschylus, says Horace in some page, Was the first mountebank that trod the stage: Yet Athens never knew your learned sport, Of tossing poets in a tennis-court. But 'tis the talent of our English nation, Still to be plotting some new reformation; And few years hence, if anarchy goes on, Jack Presbyter shall here erect his throne, Knock out a tub with preaching once a day, And every prayer be longer than a play. Then all your heathen wits shall go to pot, For disbelieving of a Popish Plot; Nor should we scape the sentence, to depart, Even in our first original, a cart; Your poets shall be used like infidels, And worst, the author of the Oxford bells; No zealous brother there would want a stone, To maul us cardinals, and pelt Pope Joan. Religion, learning, wit, would be supprest, Rags of the whore, and trappings of the beast; Scot, Suarez, Tom of Aquin, must go down, As chief supporters of the triple crown; And Aristotle's for destruction ripe; Some say, he called the soul an organ-pipe, Which, by some little help of derivation, Shall then be proved a pipe of inspiration. A PROLOGUE If yet there be a few that take delight In that which reasonable men should write, To them alone we dedicate this night. The rest may satisfy their curious itch With city-gazettes, or some factious speech, Or whate'er libel, for the public good, Stirs up the shrove-tide crew to fire and blood. Remove your benches, you apostate pit, And take, above, twelve pennyworth of wit; Go back to your dear dancing on the rope, Or see what's worse, the devil and the Pope. The plays, that take on our corrupted stage, Methinks, resemble the distracted age; Noise, madness, all unreasonable things, That strike at sense, as rebels do at kings. The style of forty-one our poets write, And you are grown to judge like forty-eight. Such censures our mistaking audience make, That 'tis almost grown scandalous to take. They talk of fevers that infect the brains; But nonsense is the new disease that reigns. Weak stomachs, with a long disease opprest, Cannot the cordials of strong wit digest; Therefore thin nourishment of farce ye choose, Decoctions of a barley-water muse. A meal of tragedy would make ye sick, Unless it were a very tender chick. Some scenes in sippets would be worth our time; Those would go down; some love that's poached in rhyme; If these should fail— We must lie down, and, after all our cost, Keep holiday, like watermen in frost; While you turn players on the world's great stage, And act yourselves the farce of your own age. EPILOGUE SPOKEN AT MITHRIDATES, KING OF PONTUS, THE FIRST PLAY ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, 1681. Pox on this playhouse! 'tis an old tired jade, 'Twill do no longer, we must force a trade. What if we all turn witnesses o'th' Plot?— That's overstocked, there's nothing to be got. Shall we take orders?—That will parts require, And colleges give no degrees for hire; Would Salamanca were a little nigher! Will nothing do?—O, now 'tis found, I hope; Have not you seen the dancing of the rope? When André's wit was clean run off the score, And Jacob's capering tricks could do no more, A damsel does to the ladder's top advance, And with two heavy buckets drags a dance; The yawning crowd perk up to see the sight, And slaver at the mouth for vast delight. Oh friend, there's nothing, to enchant the mind, Nothing like that sweet sex to draw mankind: The foundered horse, that switching will not stir, Trots to the mare afore, without a spur. Faith, I'll go scour the scene-room, and engage Some toy within to save the falling stage. [Exit. Re-enters with Mrs. Cox. Who have we here again? what nymph's i'th' stocks? Your most obedient slave, sweet Madam Cox. You 'd best be coy, and blush for a pretence; For shame! say something in your own defence! Mrs. Cox. What shall I say? I have been hence so long, I've e'en almost forgot my mother-tongue; If I can act, I wish I were ten fathom Beneath— Goodman. O Lord! pray, no swearing, madam! Mrs. Cox. If I had sworn, yet sure, to serve the nation, I could find out some mental reservation. Well, in plain terms, gallants, without a sham, Will you be pleased to take me as I am? Quite out of countenance, with a downcast look, Just like a truant that returns to book: Yet I'm not old; but, if I were, this place Ne'er wanted art to piece a ruined face. When greybeards governed, I forsook the stage; You know 'tis piteous work to act with age. Though there's no sense among these beardless boys, There's what we women love, that's mirth and noise. These young beginners may grow up in time, And the devil's in't, if I am past my prime. EPILOGUE TO A TRAGEDY CALLED TAMERLANE, 1681. BY CHARLES SAUNDERS. Ladies, the beardless author of this day Commends to you the fortune of his play. A woman-wit has often graced the stage, But he's the first boy-poet of our age. Early as is the year his fancies blow, Like young Narcissus peeping through the snow. Thus Cowley blossomed soon, yet flourished long; This is as forward, and may prove as strong. Youth with the fair should always favour find, Or we are damned dissemblers of our kind. What's all this love they put into our parts? 'Tis but the pit-a-pat of two young hearts. Should hag and grey-beard make such tender moan, Faith, you'd even trust them to themselves alone, And cry, “Let's go, here's nothing to be done.” Since love's our business, as 'tis your delight, The young, who best can practise, best can write. What though he be not come to his full power? He's mending and improving every hour. You sly she-jockies of the box and pit, Are pleased to find a hot unbroken wit; By management he may in time be made, But there's no hopes of an old battered jade; Faint and unnerved, he runs into a sweat, And always fails you at the second heat. PROLOGUE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, 1681. The famed Italian muse, whose rhymes advance Orlando, and the Paladins of France, Records that, when our wit and sense is flown, 'Tis lodged within the circle of the moon, In earthen jars, which one, who thither soared, Set to his nose, snuffed up, and was restored. Whate'er the story be, the moral's true; The wit we lost in town, we find in you. Our poets their fled parts may draw from hence, And fill their windy heads with sober sense. When London votes with Southwark's disagree, Here may they find their long-lost loyalty. Here busy senates, to the old cause inclined, May snuff the votes their fellows left behind; Your country neighbours, when their grain grows dear, May come, and find their last provision here; Whereas we cannot much lament our loss, Who neither carried back, nor brought one cross. We looked what representatives would bring, But they helped us—just as they did the king. Yet we despair not; for we now lay forth The Sibyl's books to those who know their worth; And though the first was sacrificed before, These volumes doubly will the price restore. Our poet bade us hope this grace to find, To whom by long prescription you are kind. He, whose undaunted Muse, with loyal rage, Has never spared the vices of the age, Here finding nothing that his spleen can raise, Is forced to turn his satire into praise. PROLOGUE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. Discord, and plots, which have undone our age, With the same ruin have o'erwhelmed the stage. Our house has suffered in the common woe, We have been troubled with Scotch rebels too. Our brethren are from Thames to Tweed departed, And of our sisters, all the kinder-hearted To Edinburgh gone, or coached, or carted. With bonny bluecap there they act all night For Scotch half-crown, in English three-pence hight. One nymph, to whom fat Sir John Falstaff's lean, There with her single person fills the scene. Another, with long use and age decayed, Dived here old woman, and rose there a maid. Our trusty door-keepers of former time There strut and swagger in heroic rhyme. Tack but a copper-lace to drugget suit, And there's a hero made without dispute; And that, which was a capon's tail before, Becomes a plume for Indian emperor. But all his subjects, to express the care Of imitation, go, like Indians, bare; Laced linen there would be a dangerous thing; It might perhaps a new rebellion bring; The Scot, who wore it, would be chosen king. But why should I these renegades describe, When you yourselves have seen a lewder tribe? Teague has been here, and, to this learned pit, With Irish action slandered English wit; You have beheld such barbarous Macs appear, As merited a second massacre; Such as, like Cain, were branded with disgrace, And had their country stamped upon their face. When strollers durst presume to pick your purse, We humbly thought our broken troop not worse. How ill soe'er our action may deserve, Oxford's a place where wit can never starve AN EPILOGUE FOR THE KING'S HOUSE. We act by fits and starts, like drowning men, But just peep up, and then dop down again. Let those who call us wicked change their sense, For never men lived more on Providence. Not lottery cavaliers are half so poor, Nor broken cits, nor a vacation whore; Not courts, nor courtiers living on the rents Of the three last ungiving Parliaments; So wretched, that, if Pharaoh could divine, He might have spared his dream of seven lean kine, And changed his vision for the muses nine. The comet, that, they say, portends a dearth, Was but a vapour drawn from playhouse earth; Pent there since our last fire, and, Lilly says, Foreshows our change of state, and thin third-days. 'Tis not our want of wit that keeps us poor; For then the printer's press would suffer more. Their pamphleteers each day their venom spit; They thrive by treason, and we starve by wit. Confess the truth, which of you has not laid Four farthings out to buy the Hatfield Maid? Or, which is duller yet, and more would spite us, Democritus his wars with Heraclitus? Such are the authors, who have run us down, And exercised you critics of the town. Yet these are pearls to your lampooning rhymes, Ye abuse yourselves more dully than the times. Scandal, the glory of the English nation, Is worn to rags, and scribbled out of fashion; Such harmless thrusts, as if, like fencers wise, They had agreed their play before their prize. Faith, they may hang their harps upon their willows; 'Tis just like children when they box with pillows. Then put an end to civil wars, for shame! Let each knight-errant, who has wronged a dame, Throw down his pen, and give her, as he can, The satisfaction of a gentleman. PROLOGUE TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS, UPON HIS FIRST APPEARANCE AT THE DUKE'S THEATRE AFTER HIS RETURN FROM SCOTLAND. SPOKEN BY MR. SMITH, 21st APRIL 1682. In those cold regions which no summers cheer, Where brooding darkness covers half the year, To hollow caves the shivering natives go, Bears range abroad, and hunt in tracks of snow. But when the tedious twilight wears away, And stars grow paler at the approach of day, The longing crowds to frozen mountains run, Happy who first can see the glimmering sun; The surly savage offspring disappear, And curse the bright successor of the year. Yet, though rough bears in covert seek defence, White foxes stay, with seeming innocence; That crafty kind with daylight can dispense. Still we are thronged so full with Reynard's race, That loyal subjects scarce can find a place; Thus modest truth is cast behind the crowd, Truth speaks too low, hypocrisy too loud. Let them be first to flatter in success; Duty can stay, but guilt has need to press. Once, when true zeal the sons of God did call, To make their solemn show at heaven's White-hall, The fawning Devil appeared among the rest, And made as good a courtier as the best. The friends of Job, who railed at him before, Came cap in hand when he had three times more. Yet late repentance may, perhaps, be true; Kings can forgive, if rebels can but sue: A tyrant's power in rigour is exprest; The father yearns in the true prince's breast. We grant, an o'ergrown Whig no grace can mend, But most are babes, that know not they offend; The crowd, to restless motion still inclined, Are clouds, that rack according to the wind. Driven by their chiefs, they storms of hailstones pour, Then mourn, and soften to a silent shower. O welcome to this much-offending land, The prince that brings forgiveness in his hand! Thus angels on glad messages appear, Their first salute commands us not to fear; Thus heaven, that could constrain us to obey, (With reverence if we might presume to say), Seems to relax the rights of sovereign sway; Permits to man the choice of good and ill, And makes us happy by our own free-will. PROLOGUE TO THE EARL OF ESSEX. By Mr. J. Banks, 1682. SPOKEN TO THE KING AND THE QUEEN AT THEIR COMING TO THE HOUSE. When first the ark was landed on the shore, And heaven had vowed to curse the ground no more; When tops of hills the longing patriarch saw, And the new scene of earth began to draw; The dove was sent to view the waves decrease, And first brought back to man the pledge of peace. 'Tis needless to apply, when those appear, Who bring the olive, and who plant it here. We have before our eyes the royal dove, Still innocence is harbinger of love: The ark is opened to dismiss the train, And people with a better race the plain. Tell me, ye powers, why should vain man pursue, With endless toil, each object that is new, And for the seeming substance leave the true? Why should he quit for hopes his certain good, And loathe the manna of his daily food? Must England still the scene of changes be, Tost and tempestuous, like our ambient sea? Must still our weather and our wills agree? Without our blood our liberties we have; Who, that is free, would fight to be a slave? Or, what can wars to aftertimes assure, Of which our present age is not secure? All that our monarch would for us ordain, Is but to enjoy the blessings of his reign. Our land's an Eden, and the main's our fence, While we preserve our state of innocence: That lost, then beasts their brutal force employ, And first their lord, and then themselves destroy. What civil broils have cost, we know too well; Oh! let it be enough that once we fell! And every heart conspire, and every tongue, Still to have such a king, and this king long. PROLOGUE TO THE LOYAL BROTHER, or THE PERSIAN PRINCE, BY MR. SOUTHERNE, 1682. Poets, like lawful monarchs, ruled the stage, Till critics, liked damned Whigs, debauched our age. Mark how they jump! critics would regulate Our theatres, and Whigs reform our state; Both pretend love, and both (plague rot them!) hate. The critic humbly seems advice to bring, The fawning Whig petitions to the king; But one's advice into a satire slides, T'other's petition a remonstrance hides. These will no taxes give, and those no pence; Critics would starve the poet, Whigs the prince. The critic all our troops of friends discards; Just so the Whig would fain pull down the guards. Guards are illegal, that drive foes away, As watchful shepherds, that fright beasts of prey. Kings, who disband such needless aids as these, Are safe—as long as e'er their subjects please; And that would be till next Queen Bess's night, Which thus grave penny chroniclers indite. Sir Edmondbury first in woful wise, Leads up the show, and milks their maudlin eyes. There's not a butcher's wife but dribs her part, And pities the poor pageant from her heart; Who, to provoke revenge, rides round the fire, And, with a civil congé, does retire: But guiltless blood to ground must never fall; There's Antichrist behind, to pay for all. The punk of Babylon in pomp appears, A lewd old gentleman of seventy years; Whose age in vain our mercy would implore, For few take pity on an old cast whore. The devil, who brought him to the shame, takes part; Sits cheek by jowl, in black, to cheer his heart, Like thief and parson in a Tyburn-cart. The word is given, and with a loud huzza The mitred moppet from his chair they draw: On the slain corpse contending nations fall— Alas! what's one poor Pope among them all! He burns; now all true hearts your triumphs ring; And next, for fashion, cry, “God save the king!” A needful cry in midst of such alarms, When forty thousand men are up in arms. But after he's once saved, to make amends, In each succeeding health they damn his friends: So God begins, but still the devil ends. What if some one, inspired with zeal, should call, Come, let's go cry, “God save him at Whitehall”? His best friends would not like this over-care, Or think him e'er the safer for this prayer. Five praying saints are by an Act allowed, But not the whole church-militant in crowd; Yet, should heaven all the true petitions drain Of Presbyterians, who would kings maintain, Of forty thousand, five would scarce remain. EPILOGUE TO THE SAME. A virgin poet was served up to-day, Who, till this hour, ne'er cackled for a play. He's neither yet a Whig nor Tory boy; But, like a girl, whom several would enjoy, Begs leave to make the best of his own natural toy. Were I to play my callow author's game, The King's House would instruct me by the name. There's loyalty to one; I wish no more: A commonwealth sounds like a common whore. Let husband or gallant be what they will, One part of woman is true Tory still. If any factious spirit should rebel, Our sex, with ease, can every rising quell. Then, as you hope we should your failings hide, An honest jury for our play provide. Whigs at their poets never take offence; They save dull culprits, who have murdered sense. Though nonsense is a nauseous heavy mass, The vehicle called Faction makes it pass; Faction in play's the commonwealth-man's bribe; The leaden farthing of the canting tribe: Though void in payment laws and statutes make it, The neighbourhood, that knows the man, will take it. 'Tis faction buys the votes of half the pit; Theirs is the pension-parliament of wit. In city-clubs their venom let them vent; For there 'tis safe, in its own element. Here, where their madness can have no pretence, Let them forget themselves an hour in sense. In one poor isle, why should two factions be? Small difference in your vices I can see: In drink and drabs both sides too well agree. Would there were more preferments in the land! If places fell, the party could not stand. Of this damned grievance every Whig complains, They grunt like hogs till they have got their grains. Mean time, you see what trade our plots advance; We send each year good money into France; And they that know what merchandise we need, Send o'er true Protestants to mend our breed. PROLOGUE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, SPOKEN BY MR. HART AT THE ACTING OF THE SILENT WOMAN. What Greece, when learning flourished, only knew, Athenian judges, you this day renew. Here, too, are annual rites to Pallas done, And here poetic prizes lost or won. Methinks I see you, crowned with olives, sit, And strike a sacred horror from the pit. A day of doom is this of your decree, Where even the best are but by mercy free; A day, which none but Jonson durst have wished to see. Here they, who long have known the useful stage, Come to be taught themselves to teach the age. As your commissioners our poets go, To cultivate the virtue which you sow; In your Lyceum first themselves refined, And delegated thence to humankind. But as ambassadors, when long from home, For new instructions to their princes come, So poets, who your precepts have forgot, Return, and beg they may be better taught: Follies and faults elsewhere by them are shown, But by your manners they correct their own. The illiterate writer, emp'ric-like, applies To minds diseased, unsafe chance remedies: The learned in schools, where knowledge first began, Studies with care the anatomy of man; Sees virtue, vice, and passions in their cause, And fame from science, not from fortune, draws; So Poetry, which is in Oxford made An art, in London only is a trade. There haughty dunces, whose unlearned pen Could ne'er spell grammar, would be reading men. Such build their poems the Lucretian way; So many huddled atoms make a play; And if they hit in order by some chance, They call that nature, which is ignorance. To such a fame let mere town-wits aspire, And their gay nonsense their own cits admire. Our poet, could he find forgiveness here, Would wish it rather than a plaudit there. He owns no crown from those Prætorian bands, But knows that right is in the senate's hands. Not impudent enough to hope your praise, Low at the Muses' feet his wreath he lays, And, where he took it up, resigns his bays. Kings make their poets whom themselves think fit, But 'tis your suffrage makes authentic wit. EPILOGUE. SPOKEN BY THE SAME. No poor Dutch peasant, winged with all his fear, Flies with more haste, when the French arms draw near, Than we, with our poetic train, come down, For refuge hither, from the infected town: Heaven, for our sins, this summer has thought fit To visit us with all the plagues of wit. A French troop first swept all things in its way; But those hot Monsieurs were too quick to stay: Yet, to our cost, in that short time, we find They left their itch of novelty behind. The Italian merry-andrews took their place, And quite debauched the stage with lewd grimace: Instead of wit, and humours, your delight Was there to see two hobby-horses fight; Stout Scaramoucha with rush lance rode in, And ran a tilt at centaur Arlequin. For love you heard how amorous asses brayed, And cats in gutters gave their serenade. Nature was out of countenance, and each day Some new-born monster shown you for a play. But when all failed, to strike the stage quite dumb, Those wicked engines, called machines, are come. Thunder and lightning now for wit are played, And shortly scenes in Lapland will be laid: Art magic is for poetry profest, And cats and dogs, and each obscener beast, To which Egyptian dotards once did bow, Upon our English stage are worshipped now. Witchcraft reigns there, and raises to renown Macbeth and Simon Magus of the town. Fletcher's despised, your Jonson's out of fashion, And wit the only drug in all the nation. In this low ebb our wares to you are shown, By you those staple authors' worth is known, For wit's a manufacture of your own. When you, who only can, their scenes have praised, We'll back, and boldly say, their price is raised. PROLOGUE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. Though actors cannot much of learning boast, Of all who want it, we admire it most: We love the praises of a learned pit, As we remotely are allied to wit. We speak our poet's wit, and trade in ore, Like those who touch upon the golden shore; Betwixt our judges can distinction make, Discern how much, and why our poems take; Mark if the fools, or men of sense, rejoice; Whether the applause be only sound or voice. When our fop gallants, or our city folly, Clap over loud, it makes us melancholy: We doubt that scene which does their wonder raise, And, for their ignorance, contemn their praise. Judge, then, if we who act, and they who write, Should not be proud of giving you delight. London likes grossly; but this nicer pit Examines, fathoms, all the depths of wit; The ready finger lays on every blot; Knows what should justly please, and what should not. Nature herself lies open to your view; You judge, by her, what draught of her is true, Where outlines false, and colours seem too faint, Where bunglers daub, and where true poets paint. But by the sacred genius of this place, By every muse, by each domestic grace, Be kind to wit, which but endeavours well, And, where you judge, presumes not to excel! Our poets hither for adoption come, As nations sued to be made free of Rome: Not in the suffragating tribes to stand, But in your utmost, last, provincial band. If his ambition may those hopes pursue, Who, with religion, loves your arts and you, Oxford to him a dearer name shall be Than his own mother-university. Thebes did his green, unknowing youth engage; He chooses Athens in his riper age. EPILOGUE TO CONSTANTINE THE GREAT. BY MR. N. LEE, 1684. Our hero's happy in the play's conclusion; The holy rogue at last has met confusion: Though Arius all along appeared a saint, The last act showed him a True Protestant. Eusebius,—for you know I read Greek authors,— Reports, that, after all these plots and slaughters The court of Constantine was full of glory, And every Trimmer turned addressing Tory. They followed him in herds as they were mad: When Clause was king, then all the world was glad. Whigs kept the places they possessed before, And most were in a way of getting more; Which was as much as saying, Gentlemen, Here's power and money to be rogues again. Indeed, there were a sort of peaking tools, Some call them modest, but I call them fools; Men much more loyal, though not half so loud, But these poor devils were cast behind the crowd; For bold knaves thrive without one grain of sense, But good men starve for want of impudence. Besides all these, there were a sort of wights, (I think my author calls them Tekelites,) Such hearty rogues against the king and laws, They favoured e'en a foreign rebel's cause, When their own damned design was quashed and awed; At least they gave it their good word abroad. As many a man, who, for a quiet life, Breeds out his bastard, not to nose his wife, Thus, o'er their darling plot these Trimmers cry, And, though they cannot keep it in their eye, They bind it 'prentice to Count Tekely. They believe not the last plot; may I be curst, If I believe they e'er believed the first! No wonder their own plot no plot they think,— The man that makes it never smells the stink. And, now it comes into my head, I'll tell Why these damned Trimmers loved the Turks so well. The original Trimmer, though a friend to no man, Yet in his heart adored a pretty woman; He knew that Mahomet laid up for ever Kind black-eyed rogues for every true believer; And,—which was more than mortal man e'er tasted,— One pleasure that for threescore twelvemonths lasted. To turn for this, may surely be forgiven; Who'd not be circumcised for such a heaven? PROLOGUE TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT, OR THE MOTHER IN FASHION. BY MR. SOUTHERNE, 1684 SPOKEN BY MR. BETTERTON. How comes it, gentlemen, that, nowadays, When all of you so shrewdly judge of plays, Our poets tax you still with want of sense? All prologues treat you at your own expense. Sharp citizens a wiser way can go; They make you fools, but never call you so. They in good manners seldom make a slip, But treat a common whore with—ladyship: But here each saucy wit at random writes, And uses ladies as he uses knights. Our author, young and grateful in his nature, Vows, that from him no nymph deserves a satire: Nor will he ever draw—I mean his rhyme, Against the sweet partaker of his crime; Nor is he yet so bold an undertaker, To call men fools—'tis railing at their Maker. Besides, he fears to split upon that shelf; He's young enough to be a fop himself: And, if his praise can bring you all abed, He swears such hopeful youth no nation ever bred. Your nurses, we presume in such a case, Your father chose, because he liked the face, And often they supplied your mother's place. The dry nurse was your mother's ancient maid, Who knew some former slip she ne'er betrayed. Betwixt them both, for milk and sugar-candy, Your sucking-bottles were well stored with brandy. Your father, to initiate your discourse, Meant to have taught you first to swear and curse, But was prevented by each careful nurse. For, leaving dad and mam, as names too common, They taught you certain parts of man and woman. I pass your schools; for there, when first you came, You would be sure to learn the Latin name. In colleges, you scorned the art of thinking, But learned all moods and figures of good drinking; Thence come to town, you practise play, to know The virtues of the high dice, and the low. Each thinks himself a sharper most profound: He cheats by pence; is cheated by the pound. With these perfections, and what else he gleans, The spark sets up for love behind our scenes, Hot in pursuit of princesses and queens. There, if they know their man, with cunning carriage, Twenty to one but it concludes in marriage. He hires some homely room, love's fruits to gather, And, garret high, rebels against his father: But, he once dead— Brings her in triumph, with her portion, down— A toilet, dressing-box, and half-a-crown. Some marry first, and then they fall to scowering, Which is refining marriage into whoring. Our women batten well on their good nature; All they can rap and rend for the dear creature. But while abroad so liberal the dolt is, Poor spouse at home as ragged as a colt is. Last, some there are, who take their first degrees Of lewdness in our middle galleries; The doughty bullies enter bloody drunk, Invade and grubble one another's punk: They caterwaul, and make a dismal rout, Call sons of whores, and strike, but ne'er lug out: Thus, while for paltry punk they roar and stickle, They make it bawdier than a conventicle. PROLOGUE TO THE KING AND QUEEN, UPON THE UNION OF THE TWO COMPANIES, IN 1686. Since faction ebbs, and rogues grow out of fashion, Their penny scribes take care t'inform the nation, How well men thrive in this or that plantation: How Pennsylvania's air agrees with Quakers, And Carolina's with Associators; Both e'en too good for madmen and for traitors. Truth is, our land with saints is so run o'er, And every age produces such a store, That now there's need of two New Englands more. What's this, you'll say, to us, and our vocation? Only thus much, that we have left our station, And made this theatre our new plantation. The factious natives never could agree; But aiming, as they called it, to be free, Those playhouse Whigs set up for property. Some say, they no obedience paid of late; But would new fears and jealousies create, Till topsy-turvy they had turned the state. Plain sense, without the talent of foretelling, Might guess 'twould end in downright knocks and quelling; For seldom comes there better of rebelling. When men will, needlessly, their freedom barter For lawless power, sometimes they catch a Tartar;— There's a damned word that rhymes to this, called Charter. But, since the victory with us remains, You shall be called to twelve in all our gains, If you'll not think us saucy for our pains. Old men shall have good old plays to delight them; And you, fair ladies and gallants, that slight them, We'll treat with good new plays, if our new wits can write them. We'll take no blundering verse, no fustian tumour, No dribbling love, from this or that presumer; No dull fat fool shammed on the stage for humour: For, faith, some of them such vile stuff have made, As none but fools or fairies ever played; But 'twas, as shopmen say, to force a trade. We've given you tragedies, all sense defying, And singing men, in woful metre dying; This 'tis when heavy lubbers will be flying. All these disasters we will hope to weather; We bring you none of our old lumber hither; Whig poets and Whig sheriffs may hang together. EPILOGUE ON THE SAME OCCASION. New ministers, when first they get in place, Must have a care to please; and that's our case: Some laws for public welfare we design, If you, the power supreme, will please to join. There are a sort of prattlers in the pit, Who either have, or who pretend to wit; These noisy sirs so loud their parts rehearse, That oft the play is silenced by the farce. Let such be dumb, this penalty to shun, Each to be thought my lady's eldest son. But stay; methinks some vizard mask I see, Cast out her lure from the mid gallery: About her all the fluttering sparks are ranged; The noise continues, though the scene is changed: Now growling, sputtering, wauling, such a clutter! 'Tis just like puss defendant in a gutter: Fine love, no doubt; but ere two days are o'er ye, The surgeon will be told a woful story. Let vizard mask her naked face expose, On pain of being thought to want a nose: Then for your lacqueys, and your train beside, By whate'er name or title dignified, They roar so loud, you'd think behind the stairs Tom Dove, and all the brotherhood of bears: They're grown a nuisance, beyond all disasters; We've none so great but—their unpaying masters. We beg you, Sirs, to beg your men, that they Would please to give you leave to hear the play. Next, in the playhouse, spare your precious lives; Think, like good Christians, on your bearns and wives: Think on your souls; but, by your lugging forth, It seems you know how little they are worth. If none of these will move the warlike mind, Think on the helpless whore you leave behind. We beg you, last, our scene-room to forbear, And leave our goods and chattels to our care. Alas! our women are but washy toys, And wholly taken up in stage employs: Poor willing tits they are; but yet, I doubt, This double duty soon will wear them out. Then you are watched besides with jealous care; What if my lady's page should find you there? My lady knows t' a tittle what there's in ye; No passing your gilt shilling for a guinea. Thus, gentlemen, we have summed up in short Our grievances, from country, town, and court: Which humbly we submit to your good pleasure; But first vote money, then redress at leisure. PROLOGUE TO THE PRINCESS OF CLEVES. BY MR. N. LEE, 1689. Ladies! (I hope there's none behind to hear) I long to whisper something in your ear: A secret, which does much my mind perplex,— There's treason in the play against our sex. A man that's false to love, that vows and cheats, And kisses every living thing he meets; A rogue in mode,—I dare not speak too broad,— One that—does something to the very bawd. Out on him, traitor, for a filthy beast! Nay, and he's like the pack of all the rest: None of them stick at mark; they all deceive. Some Jew has changed the text, I half believe; Their Adam cozened our poor grandame Eve. To hide their faults they rap out oaths, and tear; Now, though we lie, we're too well bred to swear. So we compound for half the sin we owe, But men are dipt for soul and body too; And, when found out, excuse themselves, pox cant them, With Latin stuff, Perjuria ridet amantum. I'm not book-learned, to know that word in vogue, But I suspect 'tis Latin for a rogue. I'm sure, I never heard that screech-owl hollowed In my poor ears, but separation followed. How can such perjured villains e'er be saved? Achitophel's not half so false to David. With vows and soft expressions to allure, They stand, like foremen of a shop, demure: No sooner out of sight, but they are gadding, And for the next new face ride out a padding. Yet, by their favour, when they have been kissing, We can perceive the ready money missing. Well! we may rail; but 'tis as good e'en wink; Something we find, and something they will sink. But, since they're at renouncing, 'tis our parts To trump their diamonds, as they trump our hearts. EPILOGUE TO THE SAME. A qualm of conscience brings me back again, To make amends to you bespattered men. We women love like cats, that hide their joys, By growling, squalling, and a hideous noise. I railed at wild young sparks; but, without lying, Never was man worse thought on for high-flying. The prodigal of love gives each her part, And, squandering, shows at least a noble heart. I've heard of men, who, in some lewd lampoon, Have hired a friend to make their valour known. That accusation straight this question brings,— What is the man that does such naughty things? The spaniel lover, like a sneaking fop, Lies at our feet:—he's scarce worth taking up. 'Tis true, such heroes in a play go far; But chamber-practice is not like the bar. When men such vile, such faint petitions make, We fear to give, because they fear to take; Since modesty's the virtue of our kind, Pray let it be to our own sex confined. When men usurp it from the female nation, 'Tis but a work of supererogation. We showed a princess in the play, 'tis true, Who gave her Cæsar more than all his due; Told her own faults; but I should much abhor To choose a husband for my confessor. You see what fate followed the saint-like fool, For telling tales from out the nuptial school. Our play a merry comedy had proved, Had she confessed so much to him she loved. True Presbyterian wives the means would try; But damned confessing is flat Popery. PROLOGUE TO ARVIRAGUS AND PHILICIA. BY LODOWICK CARLELL, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MR. HART. With sickly actors, and an old house too, We're matched with glorious theatres, and new; And with our alehouse scenes, and clothes bare worn, Can neither raise old plays, nor new adorn. If all these ills could not undo us quite, A brisk French troop is grown your dear delight; Who with broad bloody bills call you each day, To laugh and break your buttons at their play; Or see some serious piece, which, we presume, Is fallen from some incomparable plume; “And therefore, Messieurs, if you'll do us grace, Send lacqueys early to preserve your place.” We dare not on your privilege intrench, Or ask you, why you like them?—they are French. Therefore, some go with courtesy exceeding, Neither to hear nor see, but show their breeding; Each lady striving to outlaugh the rest, To make it seem they understood the jest. Their countrymen come in, and nothing pay, To teach us English where to clap the play: Civil, egad! our hospitable land Bears all the charge for them to understand: Meantime we languish, and neglected lie, Like wives, while you keep better company; And wish for your own sakes, without a satire, You 'd less good breeding, or had more good nature. PROLOGUE TO THE PROPHETESS, BY BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. REVIVED BY DRYDEN. SPOKEN BY MR. BETTERTON. What Nostradame, with all his art, can guess The fate of our approaching Prophetess? A play, which, like a prospective set right, Presents our vast expenses close to sight; But turn the tube, and there we sadly view Our distant gains, and those uncertain too; A sweeping tax, which on ourselves we raise, And all, like you, in hopes of better days. When will our losses warn us to be wise? Our wealth decreases, and our charges rise. Money, the sweet allurer of our hopes, Ebbs out in oceans, and comes in by drops. We raise new objects to provoke delight, But you grow sated ere the second sight. False men, even so you serve your mistresses; They rise three stories in their towering dress; And, after all, you love not long enough To pay the rigging, ere you leave them off. Never content with what you had before, But true to change, and Englishmen all o'er. Now honour calls you hence; and all your care Is to provide the horrid pomp of war. In plume and scarf, jack-boots, and Bilbo blade, Your silver goes, that should support our trade. Go, unkind heroes! leave our stage to mourn, Till rich from vanquished rebels you return; And the fat spoils of Teague in triumph draw, His firkin butter, and his usquebaugh. Go, conquerors of your male and female foes; Men without hearts, and women without hose. Each bring his love a Bogland captive home; Such proper pages will long trains become; With copper collars, and with brawny backs, Quite to put down the fashion of our blacks. Then shall the pious Muses pay their vows, And furnish all their laurels for your brows; Their tuneful voice shall raise for your delights; We want not poets fit to sing your flights. But you, bright beauties, for whose only sake Those doughty knights such dangers undertake, When they with happy gales are gone away, With your propitious presence grace our play, And with a sigh their empty seats survey; Then think,—On that bare bench my servant sat! I see him ogle still, and hear him chat; Selling facetious bargains, and propounding That witty recreation, called dumb-founding. Their loss with patience we will try to bear, And would do more, to see you often here; That our dead stage, revived by your fair eyes, Under a female regency may rise. PROLOGUE TO THE MISTAKES. Enter Mr. Bright. Gentlemen, we must beg your pardon; here's no prologue to be had to-day. Our new play is like to come on, without a frontispiece; as bald as one of you young beaux without your periwig. I left our young poet, snivelling and sobbing behind the scenes, and cursing somebody that has deceived him. Enter Mr. Bowen. Hold your prating to the audience; here's honest Mr. Williams just come in, half mellow, from the Rose-Tavern. He swears he is inspired with claret, and will come on, and that extempore too, either with a prologue of his own, or something like one. O here he comes to his trial, at all adventures; for my part, I wish him a good deliverance. [Exeunt Mr. Bright and Mr Bowen. Enter Mr. Williams. Save ye, sirs, save ye! I am in a hopeful way. I should speak something, in rhyme, now, for the play; But the deuce take me, if I know what to say. I'll stick to my friend the author, that I can tell ye, To the last drop of claret in my belly. So far I'm sure 'tis rhyme—that needs no granting; And, if my verses' feet stumble—you see my own are wanting. Our young poet has brought a piece of work, In which though much of art there does not lurk, It may hold out three days—and that's as long as Cork. But, for this play—(which till I have done, we show not) What may be its fortune—by the Lord—I know not. This I dare swear, no malice here is writ; 'Tis innocent of all things—even of wit. He's no high-flyer—he makes no sky-rockets, His squibs are only levelled at your pockets; And if his crackers light among your pelf, You are blown up; if not, then he's blown up himself. By this time, I'm something recovered of my flustered madness; And now, a word or two in sober sadness. Ours is a common play; and you pay down A common harlot's price—just half a crown. You'll say, I play the pimp, on my friend's score; But, since 'tis for a friend, your gibes give o'er, For many a mother has done that before. How's this? you cry: an actor write?—we know it; But Shakespeare was an actor, and a poet. Has not great Jonson's learning often failed? But Shakespeare's greater genius still prevailed. Have not some writing actors, in this age, Deserved and found success upon the stage? To tell the truth, when our old wits are tired, Not one of us but means to be inspired. Let your kind presence grace our homely cheer; Peace and the butt is all our business here; So much for that—and the devil take small beer. EPILOGUE TO HENRY II., BY JOHN BANCROFT. AND PUBLISHED BY MR. MOUNTFORT, 1693. SPOKEN BY MRS. BRACEGIRDLE. Thus you the sad catastrophe have seen, Occasioned by a mistress and a queen. Queen Eleanor the proud was French, they say; But English manufacture got the day. Jane Clifford was her name, as books aver; Fair Rosamond was but her nom de guerre. Now tell me, gallants, would you lead your life With such a mistress, or with such a wife? If one must be your choice, which d' ye approve, The curtain lecture, or the curtain love? Would ye be godly with perpetual strife, Still drudging on with homely Joan, your wife, Or take your pleasure in a wicked way, Like honest whoring Harry in the play? I guess your minds; the mistress would be taking, And nauseous matrimony sent a packing. The devil's in you all; mankind's a rogue; You love the bride, but you detest the clog. After a year, poor spouse is left i' the lurch, And you, like Haynes, return to mother-church. Or, if the name of church comes cross your mind, Chapels-of-ease behind our scenes you find. The playhouse is a kind of market-place; One chaffers for a voice, another for a face; Nay, some of you,—I dare not say how many,— Would buy of me a pen'worth for your penny. E'en this poor face, which with my fan I hide, Would make a shift my portion to provide, With some small perquisites I have beside. Though for your love, perhaps, I should not care, I could not hate a man that bids me fair. What might ensue, 'tis hard for me to tell; But I was drenched to-day for loving well, And fear the poison that would make me swell. A PROLOGUE. Gallants, a bashful poet bids me say, He's come to lose his maidenhead to-day. Be not too fierce; for he's but green of age, And ne'er, till now, debauched upon the stage. He wants the suffering part of resolution, And comes with blushes to his execution. Ere you deflower his Muse, he hopes the pit Will make some settlement upon his wit. Promise him well, before the play begin; For he would fain be cozened into sin. 'Tis not but that he knows you mean to fail; But, if you leave him after being frail, He'll have, at least, a fair pretence to rail; To call you base, and swear you used him ill, And put you in the new Deserters' Bill. Lord, what a troop of perjured men we see; Enow to fill another Mercury! But this the ladies may with patience brook; Theirs are not the first colours you forsook. He would be loath the beauties to offend; But, if he should, he's not too old to mend. He's a young plant, in his first year of bearing; But his friend swears, he will be worth the rearing. His gloss is still upon him; though 'tis true He's yet unripe, yet take him for the blue. You think an apricot half green is best; There's sweet and sour, and one side good at least. Mangos and limes, whose nourishment is little, Though not for food, are yet preserved for pickle, So this green writer may pretend, at least, To whet your stomachs for a better feast. He makes this difference in the sexes too; He sells to men, he gives himself to you. To both he would contribute some delight; A mere poetical hermaphrodite. Thus he's equipped, both to be wooed, and woo; With arms offensive, and defensive too; 'Tis hard, he thinks, if neither part will do. PROLOGUE TO ALBUMAZAR. To say this comedy pleased long ago, Is not enough to make it pass you now. Yet, gentlemen, your ancestors had wit, When few men censured, and when fewer writ. And Jonson, of those few the best, chose this, As the best model of his master-piece: Subtle was got by our Albumazar, That Alchymist by this Astrologer; Here he was fashioned, and we may suppose, He liked the fashion well, who wore the clothes. But Ben made nobly his what he did mould; What was another's lead, becomes his gold: Like an unrighteous conqueror he reigns, Yet rules that well which he unjustly gains. But this our age such authors does afford, As make whole plays, and yet scarce write one word; Who, in this anarchy of wit, rob all, And what's their plunder, their possession call; Who, like bold padders, scorn by night to prey, But rob by sunshine, in the face of day: Nay, scarce the common ceremony use Of, “Stand, Sir, and deliver up your Muse;” But knock the poet down, and, with a grace, Mount Pegasus before the owner's face. Faith, if you have such country Toms abroad, 'Tis time for all true men to leave that road. Yet it were modest, could it but be said, They strip the living, but these rob the dead; Dare with the mummies of the Muses play, And make love to them the Egyptian way; Or, as a rhyming author would have said, Join the dead living to the living dead. Such men in poetry may claim some part, They have the licence, though they want the art; And might, where theft was praised, for laureats stand, Poets, not of the head, but of the hand. They make the benefits of others' studying, Much like the meals of politic Jack-Pudding, Whose dish to challenge no man has the courage; 'Tis all his own, when once he has spit i'the porridge. But, gentlemen, you're all concerned in this; You are in fault for what they do amiss; For they their thefts still undiscovered think, And durst not steal, unless you please to wink. Perhaps, you may award by your decree, They should refund,—but that can never be; For, should you letters of reprisal seal, These men write that which no man else would steal. AN EPILOGUE. You saw your wife was chaste, yet throughly tried, And, without doubt, you are hugely edified; For, like our hero, whom we showed to-day, You think no woman true, but in a play. Love once did make a pretty kind of show; Esteem and kindness in one breast would grow; But 'twas heaven knows how many years ago. Now some small chat, and guinea expectation, Gets all the pretty creatures in the nation. In comedy your little selves you meet; 'Tis Covent Garden drawn in Bridges Street. Smile on our author then, if he has shown A jolly nut-brown bastard of your own. Ah! happy you, with ease and with delight, Who act those follies, poets toil to write! The sweating Muse does almost leave the chase; She puffs, and hardly keeps your Protean vices pace. Pinch you but in one vice, away you fly To some new frisk of contrariety. You roll like snow-balls, gathering as you run, And get seven devils, when dispossessed of one. Your Venus once was a Platonic queen, Nothing of love beside the face was seen; But every inch of her you now uncase, And clap a vizard-mask upon the face; For sins like these, the zealous of the land, With little hair, and little or no band, Declare how circulating pestilences Watch, every twenty years, to snap offences. Saturn, e'en now, takes doctoral degrees; He'll do your work this summer without fees. Let all the boxes, Phœbus, find thy grace, And, ah, preserve the eighteen-penny place! But for the pit confounders, let them go, And find as little mercy as they show! The actors thus, and thus thy poets pray; For every critic saved, thou damn'st a play. EPILOGUE TO THE HUSBAND HIS OWN CUCKOLD. Like some raw sophister that mounts the pulpit, So trembles a young poet at a full pit. Unused to crowds, the parson quakes for fear, And wonders how the devil he durst come there; Wanting three talents needful for the place, Some beard, some learning, and some little grace. Nor is the puny poet void of care; For authors, such as our new authors are, Have not much learning, nor much wit to spare; And as for grace, to tell the truth, there's scarce one, But has as little as the very parson: Both say, they preach and write for your instruction; But 'tis for a third day, and for induction. The difference is, that though you like the play, The poet's gain is ne'er beyond his day; But with the parson 'tis another case, He, without holiness, may rise to grace; The poet has one disadvantage more, That if his play be dull, he's damned all o'er, Not only a damn'd blockhead, but damn'd poor. But dulness well becomes the sable garment; I warrant that ne'er spoiled a priest's preferment; Wit's not his business, and as wit now goes, Sirs, 'tis not so much yours as you suppose, For you like nothing now but nauseous beaux. You laugh not, gallants, as by proof appears, At what his beauship says, but what he wears; So 'tis your eyes are tickled, not your ears. The tailor and the furrier find the stuff, The wit lies in the dress, and monstrous muff. The truth on 't is, the payment of the pit Is like for like, clipt money for clipt wit. You cannot from our absent author hope, He should equip the stage with such a fop. Fools change in England, and new fools arise; For, though the immortal species never dies, Yet every year new maggots make new flies. But where he lives abroad, he scarce can find One fool, for million that he left behind. MAC-FLECKNOE: A SATIRE AGAINST THOMAS SHADWELL. All human things are subject to decay, And, when fate summons, monarchs must obey. This Flecknoe found, who, like Augustus, young Was called to empire, and had governed long; In prose and verse was owned, without dispute, Through all the realms of Nonsense, absolute. This aged prince, now flourishing in peace, And blest with issue of a large increase, Worn out with business, did at length debate To settle the succession of the state; And, pondering which of all his sons was fit To reign, and wage immortal war with wit, Cried,—“'Tis resolved! for nature pleads, that he Should only rule, who most resembles me. Shadwell alone my perfect image bears, Mature in dulness from his tender years; Shadwell alone, of all my sons, is he, Who stands confirmed in full stupidity. The rest to some faint meaning make pretence, But Shadwell never deviates into sense; Some beams of wit on other souls may fall, Strike through, and make a lucid interval; But Shadwell's genuine night admits no ray, His rising fogs prevail upon the day. Besides, his goodly fabric fills the eye, And seems designed for thoughtless majesty; Thoughtless as monarch oaks, that shade the plain, And, spread in solemn state, supinely reign. Heywood and Shirley were but types of thee, Thou last great prophet of tautology! Even I, a dunce of more renown than they, Was sent before but to prepare thy way: And, coarsely clad in Norwich drugget, came To teach the nations in thy greater name. My warbling lute,—the lute I whilom strung, When to King John of Portugal I sung,— Was but the prelude to that glorious day, When thou on silver Thames didst cut thy way, With well-timed oars, before the royal barge, Swelled with the pride of thy celestial charge; And big with hymn, commander of an host,— The like was ne'er in Epsom blankets tost. Methinks I see the new Arion sail, The lute still trembling underneath thy nail. At thy well-sharpened thumb, from shore to shore, The trebles squeak for fear, the basses roar; Echoes, from Pissing-Alley, Shadwell call, And Shadwell they resound from Aston Hall. About thy boat the little fishes throng, As at the morning toast that floats along. Sometimes, as prince of thy harmonious band, Thou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand; St. André's feet ne'er kept more equal time, Not even the feet of thy own Psyche's rhyme, Though they in number as in sense excel; So just, so like tautology, they fell, That, pale with envy, Singleton forswore The lute and sword, which he in triumph bore, And vowed he ne'er would act Villerius more.” Here stopt the good old sire, and wept for joy, In silent raptures of the hopeful boy. All arguments, but most his plays, persuade, That for anointed dulness he was made. Close to the walls which fair Augusta bind, (The fair Augusta much to fears inclined,) An ancient fabric raised to inform the sight, There stood of yore, and Barbican it hight; A watch-tower once, but now, so fate ordains, Of all the pile an empty name remains; From its old ruins brothel-houses rise, Scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys; Where their vast courts the mother-strumpets keep, And, undisturbed by watch, in silence sleep. Near these a Nursery erects its head, Where queens are formed, and future heroes bred; Where unfledged actors learn to laugh and cry; Where infant punks their tender voices try, And little Maximins the gods defy. Great Fletcher never treads in buskins here, Nor greater Jonson dares in socks appear; But gentle Simkin just reception finds Amidst this monument of vanished minds; Pure clinches the suburban muse affords, And Panton waging harmless war with words. Here Flecknoe, as a place to fame well known, Ambitiously designed his Shadwell's throne. For ancient Decker prophesied long since, That in this pile should reign a mighty prince, Born for a scourge of wit, and flail of sense; To whom true dulness should some Psyches owe, But worlds of Misers from his pen should flow; Humorists, and Hypocrites, it should produce, Whole Raymond families, and tribes of Bruce. Now empress Fame had published the renown Of Shadwell's coronation through the town. Roused by report of fame, the nations meet, From near Bunhill, and distant Watling Street. No Persian carpets spread the imperial way, But scattered limbs of mangled poets lay; From dusty shops neglected authors come, Martyrs of pies, and relics of the bum; Much Heywood, Shirley, Ogleby there lay, But loads of Shadwell almost choked the way; Bilked stationers for yeomen stood prepared, And Herringman was captain of the guard. The hoary prince in majesty appeared, High on a throne of his own labours reared. At his right hand our young Ascanius sate, Rome's other hope, and pillar of the state; His brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace, And lambent dulness played around his face. As Hannibal did to the altars come, Sworn by his sire, a mortal foe to Rome, So Shadwell swore, nor should his vow be vain, That he till death true dulness would maintain; And, in his father's right, and realm's defence, Ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense. The king himself the sacred unction made, As king by office, and as priest by trade. In his sinister hand, instead of ball, He placed a mighty mug of potent ale; “Love's kingdom” to his right he did convey, At once his sceptre, and his rule of sway; Whose righteous lore the prince had practised young, And from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung. His temples, last, with poppies were o'erspread, That nodding seemed to consecrate his head. Just at the point of time, if fame not lie, On his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly;— So Romulus, 'tis sung, by Tiber's brook, Presage of sway from twice six vultures took. The admiring throng loud acclamations make, And omens of his future empire take. The sire then shook the honours of his head, And from his brows damps of oblivion shed Full on the filial dulness: long he stood, Repelling from his breast the raging god; At length burst out in this prophetic mood:— “Heavens bless my son! from Ireland let him reign, To far Barbadoes on the western main; Of his dominion may no end be known, And greater than his father's be his throne; Beyond love's kingdom let him stretch his pen!” He paused, and all the people cried, “Amen.” Then thus continued he: “My son, advance Still in new impudence, new ignorance. Success let others teach, learn thou from me Pangs without birth, and fruitless industry. Let Virtuosos in five years be writ, Yet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit. Let gentle George in triumph tread the stage, Make Dorimant betray, and Loveit rage; Let Cully, Cockwood, Fopling, charm the pit, And in their folly show the writer's wit; Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence, And justify their author's want of sense. Let them be all by thy own model made Of dulness, and desire no foreign aid; That they to future ages may be known, Not copies drawn, but issue of thy own: Nay, let thy men of wit too be the same, All full of thee, and differing but in name; But let no alien Sedley interpose, To lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose. And when false flowers of rhetoric thou wouldst cull, Trust nature; do not labour to be dull, But write thy best, and top; and, in each line, Sir Formal's oratory will be thine: Sir Formal, though unsought, attends thy quill, And does thy northern dedications fill. Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame, By arrogating Jonson's hostile name; Let father Flecknoe fire thy mind with praise, And uncle Ogleby thy envy raise. Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no part: What share have we in nature, or in art? Where did his wit on learning fix a brand, And rail at arts he did not understand? Where made he love in Prince Nicander's vein, Or swept the dust in Psyche's humble strain? Where sold he bargains, ‘whip-stitch, kiss my arse,’ Promised a play, and dwindled to a farce? When did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin, As thou whole Etherege dost transfuse to thine? But so transfused, as oil and waters flow, His always floats above, thine sinks below. This is thy province, this thy wondrous way, New humours to invent for each new play: This is that boasted bias of thy mind, By which one way to dulness 'tis inclined; Which makes thy writings lean on one side still, And, in all changes, that way bends thy will. Nor let thy mountain-belly make pretence Of likeness; thine's a tympany of sense. A tun of man in thy large bulk is writ, But sure thou 'rt but a kilderkin of wit. Like mine, thy gentle numbers feebly creep; Thy tragic muse gives smiles, thy comic sleep. With whate'er gall thou sett'st thyself to write, Thy inoffensive satires never bite; In thy felonious heart though venom lies, It does but touch thy Irish pen, and dies. Thy genius call thee not to purchase fame In keen iambics, but mild anagram. Leave writing plays, and choose for thy command, Some peaceful province in Acrostic land. There thou may'st wings display, and altars raise, And torture one poor word ten thousand ways; Or, if thou wouldst thy different talents suit, Set thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute.” He said:—but his last words were scarcely heard; For Bruce and Longvil had a trap prepared, And down they sent the yet declaiming bard. Sinking he left his drugget robe behind, Borne upwards by a subterranean wind. The mantle fell to the young prophet's part, With double portion of his father's art. END OF THE TENTH VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. XI. EPISTLES. EPISTLE THE FIRST. TO HIS FRIEND JOHN HODDESDON, ON HIS DIVINE EPIGRAMS. Thou hast inspired me with thy soul, and I, Who ne'er before could ken of poetry, Am grown so good proficient, I can lend A line in commendation of my friend. Yet 'tis but of the second hand; if ought There be in this, 'tis from thy fancy brought. Good thief, who dar'st, Prometheus-like, aspire, And fill thy poems with celestial fire; Enlivened by these sparks divine, their rays Add a bright lustre to thy crown of bays. Young eaglet, who thy nest thus soon forsook, So lofty and divine a course hast took, As all admire, before the down begin To peep, as yet, upon thy smoother chin; And, making heaven thy aim, hast had the grace To look the Sun of Righteousness i' the face. What may we hope, if thou goest on thus fast? Scriptures at first, enthusiasms at last! Thou hast commenced, betimes, a saint; go on, Mingling diviner streams with Helicon, That they who view what epigrams here be, May learn to make like, in just praise of thee.— Reader, I've done, nor longer will withhold Thy greedy eyes; looking on this pure gold, Thou'lt know adulterate copper; which, like this, Will only serve to be a foil to his. EPISTLE THE SECOND. TO MY HONOURED FRIEND SIR ROBERT HOWARD, ON HIS EXCELLENT POEMS. As there is music uninformed by art In those wild notes, which, with a merry heart, The birds in unfrequented shades express, Who, better taught at home, yet please us less; So in your verse a native sweetness dwells, Which shames composure, and its art excels. Singing no more can your soft numbers grace, Than paint adds charms unto a beauteous face. Yet as when mighty rivers gently creep, Their even calmness does suppose them deep, Such is your muse: no metaphor swelled high With dangerous boldness lifts her to the sky: Those mounting fancies, when they fall again, Show sand and dirt at bottom do remain. So firm a strength, and yet withal so sweet, Did never but in Samson's riddle meet. 'Tis strange each line so great a weight should bear, And yet no sign of toil, no sweat appear. Either your art hides art, as stoics feign Then least to feel, when most they suffer pain; And we, dull souls, admire, but cannot see What hidden springs within the engine be: Or 'tis some happiness, that still pursues Each act and motion of your graceful muse. Or is it fortune's work, that in your head The curious net that is for fancies spread, Rete Mirabile. Lets through its meshes every meaner thought, While rich ideas there are only caught? Sure that's not all; this is a piece too fair To be the child of chance, and not of care. No atoms, casually together hurled, Could e'er produce so beautiful a world; Nor dare I such a doctrine here admit, As would destroy the providence of wit. 'Tis your strong genius, then, which does not feel Those weights, would make a weaker spirit reel. To carry weight, and run so lightly too, Is what alone your Pegasus can do. Great Hercules himself could ne'er do more, Than not to feel those heavens and gods he bore. Your easier odes, which for delight were penned, Yet our instruction make their second end; We're both enriched and pleased, like them that woo At once a beauty, and a fortune too. Of moral knowledge poesy was queen, And still she might, had wanton wits not been; Who, like ill guardians, lived themselves at large, And, not content with that, debauched their charge. Like some brave captain, your successful pen Restores the exiled to her crown again; And gives us hope, that having seen the days When nothing flourished but fanatic bays, All will at length in this opinion rest,— “A sober prince's government is best.” This is not all; your art the way has found To make improvement of the richest ground; That soil which those immortal laurels bore, That once the sacred Maro's temples wore. Elissa's griefs are so expressed by you, They are too eloquent to have been true. Had she so spoke, Æneas had obeyed What Dido, rather than what Jove, had said. If funeral rites can give a ghost repose, Your muse so justly has discharged those, Elissa's shade may now its wandering cease, And claim a title to the fields of peace. But if Æneas be obliged, no less Your kindness great Achilles doth confess; Who, dressed by Statius in too bold a look, Did ill become those virgin robes he took. To understand how much we owe to you, We must your numbers, with your author's, view: Then we shall see his work was lamely rough, Each figure stiff, as if designed in buff; His colours laid so thick on every place, As only showed the paint, but hid the face. But, as in perspective, we beauties see, Which in the glass, not in the picture, be; So here our sight obligingly mistakes That wealth, which his your bounty only makes. Thus vulgar dishes are, by cooks, disguised, More for their dressing than their substance prized. Your curious notes Annotations on Statius. so search into that age, When all was fable but the sacred page, That, since in that dark night we needs must stray, We are at least misled in pleasant way. But, what we most admire, your verse no less The prophet than the poet doth confess. Ere our weak eyes discerned the doubtful streak Of light, you saw great Charles his morning break: So skilful seamen ken the land from far, Which shows like mists to the dull passenger. To Charles your muse first pays her duteous love, As still the ancients did begin from Jove; With Monk you end, whose name preserved shall be, As Rome recorded Rufus' memory; Who thought it greater honour to obey His country's interest, than the world to sway. Hic situs est Rufus qui pulso Vindice quondam, Imperium asseruit non sibi sed patriæ. But to write worthy things of worthy men, Is the peculiar talent of your pen; Yet let me take your mantle up, and I Will venture, in your right, to prophesy:— “This work, by merit first of fame secure, Is likewise happy in its geniture; For since 'tis born when Charles ascends the throne, It shares at once his fortune and its own.” EPISTLE THE THIRD. TO MY HONOURED FRIEND DR. CHARLETON, ON HIS LEARNED AND USEFUL WORKS, BUT MORE PARTICULARLY HIS TREATISE OF STONEHENGE, BY HIM RESTORED TO THE TRUE FOUNDER. The longest tyranny that ever swayed, Was that wherein our ancestors betrayed Their free-born reason to the Stagyrite, And made his torch their universal light. So truth, while only one supplied the state, Grew scarce, and dear, and yet sophisticate. Still it was bought, like emp'ric wares, or charms, Hard words sealed up with Aristotle's arms. Columbus was the first that shook his throne, And found a temperate in a torrid zone: The feverish air, fanned by a cooling breeze; The fruitful vales, set round with shady trees; And guiltless men, who danced away their time, Fresh as their groves, and happy as their clime. Had we still paid that homage to a name, Which only God and nature justly claim, The western seas had been our utmost bound, Where poets still might dream the sun was drowned; And all the stars, that shine in southern skies, Had been admired by none but savage eyes. Among the assertors of free reason's claim, Our nation's not the least in worth or fame. The world to Bacon does not only owe Its present knowledge, but its future too. Gilbert shall live, till loadstones cease to draw, Or British fleets the boundless ocean awe. And noble Boyle, not less in nature seen, Than his great brother, read in states and men. The circling streams, once thought but pools, of blood, (Whether life's fuel, or the body's food,) From dark oblivion Harvey's name shall save; While Ent keeps all the honour that he gave. Nor are you, learned friend, the least renowned; Whose fame, not circumscribed with English ground, Flies like the nimble journeys of the light, And is, like that, unspent too in its flight. Whatever truths have been, by art or chance, Redeemed from error, or from ignorance, Thin in their authors, like rich veins of ore, Your works unite, and still discover more. Such is the healing virtue of your pen, To perfect cures on books, as well as men. Nor is this work the least; you well may give To men new vigour, who make stones to live. Through you, the Danes, their short dominion lost, A longer conquest than the Saxons boast. Stonehenge, once thought a temple, you have found A throne, where kings, our earthly gods, were crowned; Where by their wondering subjects they were seen, Joyed with their stature, and their princely mien. Our sovereign here above the rest might stand, And here be chose again to rule the land. These ruins sheltered once his sacred head, When he from Wor'ster's fatal battle fled; Watched by the genius of this royal place, And mighty visions of the Danish race. His refuge then was for a temple shown; But, he restored, 'tis now become a throne. EPISTLE THE FOURTH. TO THE LADY CASTLEMAINE, UPON HER ENCOURAGING HIS FIRST PLAY, THE WILD GALLANT, ACTED IN 1662–63. As seamen, shipwracked on some happy shore, Discover wealth in lands unknown before; And, what their art had laboured long in vain, By their misfortunes happily obtain: So my much-envied muse, by storms long tost, Is thrown upon your hospitable coast, And finds more favour by her ill success, Than she could hope for by her happiness. Once Cato's virtue did the gods oppose; While they the victor, he the vanquished chose: But you have done what Cato could not do, To choose the vanquished, and restore him too. Let others still triumph, and gain their cause By their deserts, or by the world's applause; Let merit crowns, and justice laurels give, But let me happy by your pity live. True poets empty fame and praise despise, Fame is the trumpet, but your smile the prize. You sit above, and see vain men below Contend for what you only can bestow; But those great actions others do by chance Are, like your beauty, your inheritance: So great a soul, such sweetness joined in one, Could only spring from noble Grandison. You, like the stars, not by reflection bright, Are born to your own heaven, and your own light; Like them are good, but from a nobler cause, From your own knowledge, not from nature's laws. Your power you never use, but for defence, To guard your own, or others' innocence: Your foes are such, as they, not you, have made, And virtue may repel, though not invade. Such courage did the ancient heroes show, Who, when they might prevent, would wait the blow With such assurance as they meant to say, We will o'ercome, but scorn the safest way. What further fear of danger can there be? Beauty, which captives all things, sets me free. Posterity will judge by my success, I had the Grecian poet's happiness, Who, waving plots, found out a better way; Some god descended, and preserved the play. When first the triumphs of your sex were sung By those old poets, beauty was but young, And few admired the native red and white, Till poet's dressed them up to charm the sight; So beauty took on trust, and did engage For sums of praises till she came to age. But this long-growing debt to poetry, You justly, madam, have discharged to me, When your applause and favour did infuse New life to my condemned and dying muse. EPISTLE THE FIFTH. TO MR. LEE, ON HIS TRAGEDY OF THE RIVAL QUEENS; OR, ALEXANDER THE GREAT, 1677. The blast of common censure could I fear, Before your play my name should not appear; For 'twill be thought, and with some colour too, I pay the bribe I first received from you; That mutual vouchers for our fame we stand, And play the game into each other's hand; And as cheap pen'orths to ourselves afford, As Bessus and the brothers of the sword. Such libels private men may well endure, When states and kings themselves are not secure; For ill men, conscious of their inward guilt, Think the best actions on by-ends are built. And yet my silence had not 'scaped their spite; Then, envy had not suffered me to write; For, since I could not ignorance pretend, Such merit I must envy or commend. So many candidates there stand for wit, A place at court is scarce so hard to get: In vain they crowd each other at the door; For e'en reversions are all begged before: Desert, how known soe'er, is long delayed, And then, too, fools and knaves are better paid. Yet, as some actions bear so great a name, That courts themselves are just, for fear of shame; So has the mighty merit of your play Extorted praise, and forced itself a way. 'Tis here as 'tis at sea; who furthest goes, Or dares the most, makes all the rest his foes. Yet when some virtue much outgrows the rest, It shoots too fast, and high, to be opprest; As his heroic worth struck envy dumb, Who took the Dutchman, and who cut the boom. Such praise is yours, while you the passions move, That 'tis no longer feigned, 'tis real love, Where nature triumphs over wretched art; We only warm the head, but you the heart. Always you warm; and if the rising year, As in hot regions, brings the sun too near, 'Tis but to make your fragrant spices blow, Which in our cooler climates will not grow. They only think you animate your theme With too much fire, who are themselves all phlegm. Prizes would be for lags of slowest pace, Were cripples made the judges of the race. Despise those drones, who praise, while they accuse, The too much vigour of your youthful muse. That humble style, which they your virtue make, Is in your power; you need but stoop and take. Your beauteous images must be allowed By all, but some vile poets of the crowd. But how should any sign-post dauber know The worth of Titian, or of Angelo? Hard features every bungler can command; To draw true beauty, shows a master's hand. EPISTLE THE SIXTH. TO THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON, ON HIS EXCELLENT ESSAY ON TRANSLATED VERSE. Whether the fruitful Nile, or Tyrian shore, The seeds of arts and infant science bore, 'Tis sure the noble plant, translated first, Advanced its head in Grecian gardens nurst. The Grecians added verse; their tuneful tongue Made nature first, and nature's God their song. Nor stopt translation here; for conquering Rome, With Grecian spoils, brought Grecian numbers home; Enriched by those Athenian muses more, Than all the vanquished world could yield before. Till barbarous nations, and more barbarous times, Debased the majesty of verse to rhymes; Those rude at first; a kind of hobbling prose, That limped along, and tinkled in the close. But Italy, reviving from the trance Of Vandal, Goth, and monkish ignorance, With pauses, cadence, and well-vowell'd words, And all the graces a good ear affords, Made rhyme an art, and Dante's polished page Restored a silver, not a golden age. Then Petrarch followed, and in him we see, What rhyme improved in all its height can be; At best a pleasing sound, and fair barbarity. The French pursued their steps; and Britain, last, In manly sweetness all the rest surpassed. The wit of Greece, the gravity of Rome, Appear exalted in the British loom: The Muses' empire is restored again, In Charles his reign, and by Roscommon's pen. Yet modestly he does his work survey, And calls a finished poem an essay; For all the needful rules are scattered here; Truth smoothly told, and pleasantly severe; So well is art disguised, for nature to appear. Nor need those rules to give translation light; His own example is a flame so bright, That he, who but arrives to copy well, Unguided will advance, unknowing will excel. Scarce his own Horace could such rules ordain, Or his own Virgil sing a nobler strain. How much in him may rising Ireland boast, How much in gaining him has Britain lost! Their island in revenge has ours reclaimed; The more instructed we, the more we still are shamed. 'Tis well for us his generous blood did flow, Derived from British channels long ago, That here his conquering ancestors were nurst, And Ireland but translated England first: By this reprisal we regain our right, Else must the two contending nations fight; A nobler quarrel for his native earth, Than what divided Greece for Homer's birth. To what perfection will our tongue arrive, How will invention and translation thrive, When authors nobly born will bear their part, And not disdain the inglorious praise of art! Great generals thus, descending from command, With their own toil provoke the soldier's hand. How will sweet Ovid's ghost be pleased to hear His fame augmented by an English peer; How he embellishes his Helen's loves, Outdoes his softness, and his sense improves? When these translate, and teach translators too, Nor firstling kid, nor any vulgar vow, Should at Apollo's grateful altar stand: Roscommon writes; to that auspicious hand, Muse, feed the bull that spurns the yellow sand. Roscommon, whom both court and camps commend, True to his prince, and faithful to his friend; Roscommon, first in fields of honour known, First in the peaceful triumphs of the gown; Who both Minervas justly makes his own. Now let the few beloved by Jove, and they Whom infused Titan formed of better clay, On equal terms with ancient wit engage, Nor mighty Homer fear, nor sacred Virgil's page: Our English palace opens wide in state, And without stooping they may pass the gate. EPISTLE THE SEVENTH. TO THE DUCHESS OF YORK, ON HER RETURN FROM SCOTLAND, IN THE YEAR 1682. When factious rage to cruel exile drove The queen of beauty, and the court of love, The Muses drooped, with their forsaken arts, And the sad Cupids broke their useless darts; Our fruitful plains to wilds and deserts turned, Like Eden's face, when banished man it mourned. Love was no more, when loyalty was gone, The great supporter of his awful throne. Love could no longer after beauty stay, But wandered northward to the verge of day, As if the sun and he had lost their way. But now the illustrious nymph, returned again, Brings every grace triumphant in her train. The wondering Nereids, though they raised no storm, Foreslowed her passage, to behold her form: Some cried, A Venus; some, A Thetis past; But this was not so fair, nor that so chaste. Far from her sight flew Faction, Strife, and Pride; And Envy did but look on her, and died. Whate'er we suffered from our sullen fate, Her sight is purchased at an easy rate. Three gloomy years against this day were set; But this one mighty sum has cleared the debt: Like Joseph's dream, but with a better doom, The famine past, the plenty still to come. For her, the weeping heavens become serene; For her, the ground is clad in cheerful green; For her, the nightingales are taught to sing, And Nature has for her delayed the spring. The Muse resumes her long-forgotten lays, And Love restored his ancient realm surveys, Recalls our beauties, and revives our plays, His waste dominions peoples once again, And from her presence dates his second reign. But awful charms on her fair forehead sit, Dispensing what she never will admit; Pleasing, yet cold, like Cynthia's silver beam, The people's wonder, and the poet's theme. Distempered zeal, sedition, cankered hate, No more shall vex the Church, and tear the State; No more shall faction civil discords move, Or only discords of too tender love: Discord, like that of music's various parts; Discord, that makes the harmony of hearts; Discord, that only this dispute shall bring, Who best shall love the Duke, and serve the King. EPISTLE THE EIGHTH. TO MY FRIEND MR. J. NORTHLEIGH, AUTHOR OF THE PARALLEL, ON HIS TRIUMPH OF THE BRITISH MONARCHY. So Joseph, yet a youth, expounded well The boding dream, and did the event foretell; Judged by the past, and drew the Parallel. Thus early Solomon the truth explored, The right awarded, and the babe restored. Thus Daniel, ere to prophecy he grew, The perjured Presbyters did first subdue, And freed Susanna from the canting crew. Well may our monarchy triumphant stand, While warlike James protects both sea and land; And, under covert of his seven-fold shield, Thou send'st thy shafts to scour the distant field. By law thy powerful pen has set us free; Thou studiest that, and that may study thee. SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE, TO THE EARL OF MIDDLETON. Since love and verse, as well as wine, Are brisker where the sun does shine, 'Tis something to lose two degrees, Now age itself begins to freeze: Yet this I patiently could. bear, If the rough Danube's beauties were But only two degrees less fair Than the bright nymphs of gentle Thames, Who warm me hither with their beams: Such power they have, they can dispense Five hundred miles their influence. But hunger forces men to eat, Though no temptation's in the meat. How would the ogling sparks despise The darling damsel of my eyes, Should they behold her at a play, As she's tricked up on holiday, When the whole family combine, For public pride, to make her shine! Her locks, which long before lay matted, Are on this day combed out and plaited; A diamond bodkin in each tress, The badges of her nobleness; For every stone, as well as she, Can boast an ancient pedigree. These formed the jewel erst did grace The cap of the first Grave o' the race, Preferred by Graffin Marian To adorn the handle of her fan; And, as by old record appears, Worn since in Kunigunda's years, Now sparkling in the froein's hair; No rocket breaking in the air Can with her starry head compare. Such ropes of pearl her arms encumber, She scarce can deal the cards at omber; So many rings each finger freight, They tremble with the mighty weight. The like in England ne'er was seen, Since Holbein drew Hal and his queen: But after these fantastic flights, The lustre's meaner than the lights. The thing that bears this glittering pomp Is but a tawdry ill-bred romp, Whose brawny limbs and martial face Proclaim her of the Gothic race, More than the mangled pageantry Of all the father's heraldry. But there's another sort of creatures, Whose ruddy look and grotesque features Are so much out of nature's way, You'd think them stamped on other clay, No lawful daughters of old Adam. 'Mongst these behold a city madam, With arms in mittins, head in muff, A dapper cloak, and reverend ruff: No farce so pleasant as this maukin, And the soft sound of High-Dutch talking. Here, unattended by the Graces, The queen of love in a sad case is. Nature, her active minister, Neglects affairs, and will not stir; Thinks it not worth the while to please, But when she does it for her ease. Even I, her most devout adorer, With wandering thoughts appear before her, And when I'm making an oblation, Am fain to spur imagination With some sham London inclination: The bow is bent at German dame, The arrow flies at English game. Kindness, that can indifference warm, And blow that calm into a storm, Has in the very tenderest hour Over my gentleness a power; True to my country-women's charms, When kissed and pressed in foreign arms. EPISTLE THE NINTH. A LETTER TO SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE. To you, who live in chill degree, As map informs, of fifty-three, And do not much for cold atone, By bringing thither fifty-one, Methinks all climes should be alike, From tropic even to pole artique; Since you have such a constitution As nowhere suffers diminution. You can be old in grave debate, And young in love affairs of state; And both to wives and husbands show The vigour of a plenipo. Like mighty missioner you come Ad Partes Infidelium. A work of wondrous merit sure, So far to go, so much t'endure; And all to preach to German dame, Where sound of Cupid never came. Less had you done, had you been sent As far as Drake or Pinto went, For cloves or nutmegs to the line-a, Or even for oranges to China. That had indeed been charity, Where love-sick ladies helpless lie, Chapt, and, for want of liquor, dry. But you have made your zeal appear Within the circle of the Bear. What region of the earth's so dull, That is not of your labours full? Triptolemus (so sung the Nine) Strewed plenty from his cart divine; But spite of all these fable-makers, He never sowed on Almain acres. No, that was left by fate's decree To be performed and sung by thee. Thou break'st through forms with as much ease As the French king through articles. In grand affairs thy days are spent, In waging weighty compliment, With such as monarchs represent. They, whom such vast fatigues attend, Want some soft minutes to unbend, To show the world that, now and then, Great ministers are mortal men. Then Rhenish rummers walk the round; In bumpers every king is crowned; Besides three holy mitred Hectors, And the whole college of Electors. No health of potentate is sunk, That pays to make his envoy drunk. These Dutch delights, I mentioned last, Suit not, I know, your English taste: For wine to leave a whore or play, Was ne'er your Excellency's way. Nor need this title give offence, For here you were your Excellence; For gaming, writing, speaking, keeping, His Excellence for all—but sleeping. Now if you tope in form, and treat, 'Tis the sour sauce to the sweet meat, The fine you pay for being great. Nay, here's a harder imposition, Which is indeed the court's petition, That, setting worldly pomp aside, Which poet has at font denied, You would be pleased in humble way To write a trifle called a Play. This truly is a degradation, But would oblige the crown and nation Next to your wise negotiation. If you pretend, as well you may, Your high degree, your friends will say, The Duke St. Aignon made a play. If Gallic wit convince you scarce, His Grace of Bucks has made a farce, And you, whose comic wit is terse all, Can hardly fall below Rehearsal. Then finish what you have began, But scribble faster if you can; For yet no George, to our discerning, Has writ without a ten years' warning. EPISTLE THE TENTH. TO MR. SOUTHERNE, ON HIS COMEDY CALLED THE WIVES' EXCUSE, ACTED IN 1692. Sure there's a fate in plays, and 'tis in vain To write, while these malignant planets reign. Some very foolish influence rules the pit, Not always kind to sense, or just to wit; And whilst it lasts, let buffoon'ry succeed, To make us laugh, for never was more need. Farce, in itself, is of a nasty scent; But the gain smells not of the excrement. The Spanish nymph, a wit and beauty too, With all her charms, bore but a single show; But let a monster Muscovite appear, He draws a crowded audience round the year. May be thou hast not pleased the box and pit; Yet those who blame thy tale applaud thy wit: So Terence plotted, but so Terence writ. Like his, thy thoughts are true, thy language clean; Even lewdness is made moral in thy scene. The hearers may for want of Nokes repine; But rest secure, the readers will be thine. Nor was thy laboured drama damned or hissed, But with a kind civility dismissed; With such good manners as the Wife did use, Who, not accepting, did but just refuse. There was a glance at parting; such a look, As bids thee not give o'er for one rebuke. But if thou wouldst be seen, as well as read, Copy one living author, and one dead. The standard of thy style let Etherege be; For wit, the immortal spring of Wycherly. Learn, after both, to draw some just design, And the next age will learn to copy thine. EPISTLE THE ELEVENTH. TO HENRY HIGDEN, ESQ. ON HIS TRANSLATION OF THE TENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL. The Grecian wits, who satire first began, Were pleasant Pasquins on the life of man; At mighty villains, who the state opprest, They durst not rail, perhaps; they laughed, at least, And turned them out of office with a jest. No fool could peep abroad, but ready stand The drolls to clap a bauble in his hand. Wise legislators never yet could draw A fop within the reach of common law; For posture, dress, grimace, and affectation, Though foes to sense, are harmless to the nation. Our last redress is dint of verse to try, And satire is our Court of Chancery. This way took Horace to reform an age, Not bad enough to need an author's rage: But yours, who lived in more degenerate times, Was forced to fasten deep, and worry crimes. Yet you, my friend, have tempered him so well, You make him smile in spite of all his zeal; An art peculiar to yourself alone, To join the virtues of two styles in one. Oh! were your author's principle received, Half of the labouring world would be relieved; For not to wish is not to be deceived. Revenge would into charity be changed, Because it costs too dear to be revenged; It costs our quiet and content of mind, And when 'tis compassed leaves a sting behind. Suppose I had the better end o' the staff, Why should I help the ill-natured world to laugh? 'Tis all alike to them, who get the day; They love the spite and mischief of the fray. No; I have cured myself of that disease; Nor will I be provoked, but when I please: But let me half that cure to you restore; You give the salve, I laid it to the sore. Our kind relief against a rainy day, Beyond a tavern, or a tedious play, We take your book, and laugh our spleen away. If all your tribe, too studious of debate, Would cease false hopes and titles to create, Led by the rare example you begun, Clients would fail, and lawyers be undone. EPISTLE THE TWELFTH. TO MY DEAR FRIEND MR. CONGREVE, ON HIS COMEDY CALLED THE DOUBLE DEALER. Well, then, the promised hour is come at last, The present age of wit obscures the past; Strong were our sires, and as they fought they writ, Conquering with force of arms, and dint of wit: Theirs was the giant race, before the flood; And thus, when Charles returned, our empire stood. Like Janus, he the stubborn soil manured, With rules of husbandry the rankness cured; Tamed us to manners when the stage was rude, And boisterous English wit with art endued. Our age was cultivated thus at length; But what we gained in skill we lost in strength. Our builders were with wont of genius curst; The second temple was not like the first; Till you, the best Vitruvius, come at length, Our beauties equal, but excel our strength. Firm Doric pillars found your solid base; The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space: Thus all below is strength, and all above is grace. In easy dialogue is Fletcher's praise; He moved the mind, but had no power to raise: Great Jonson did by strength of judgment please; Yet, doubling Fletcher's force, he wants his ease. In differing talents both adorned their age; One for the study, t'other for the stage. But both to Congreve justly shall submit, One matched in judgment, both o'ermatched in wit. In him all beauties of this age we see, Etherege his courtship, Southerne's purity, The satire, wit, and strength, of manly Wycherly. All this in blooming youth you have achieved; Nor are your foiled contemporaries grieved. So much the sweetness of your manners move, We cannot envy you, because we love. Fabius might joy in Scipio, when he saw A beardless consul made against the law, And join his suffrage to the votes of Rome, Though he with Hannibal was overcome. Thus old Romano bowed to Raphael's fame, And scholar to the youth he taught became. O that your brows my laurel had sustained! Well had I been deposed, if you had reigned: The father had descended for the son; For only you are lineal to the throne. Thus, when the state one Edward did depose, A greater Edward in his room arose: But now not I, but poetry, is cursed; For Tom the second reigns like Tom the first. But let them not mistake my patron's part, Nor call his charity their own desert. Yet this I prophesy,—Thou shalt be seen, (Though with some short parenthesis between,) High on the throne of wit, and, seated there, Not mine,—that's little,—but thy laurel wear. Thy first attempt an early promise made; That early promise this has more than paid. So bold, yet so judiciously you dare, That your least praise is to be regular. Time, place, and action may with pains be wrought, But genius must be born, and never can be taught. This is your portion, this your native store; Heaven, that but once was prodigal before, To Shakespeare gave as much,—she could not give him more. Maintain your post; that's all the fame you need; For 'tis impossible you should proceed. Already I am worn with cares and age, And just abandoning the ungrateful stage; Unprofitably kept at Heaven's expense, I live a rent-charge on His providence: But you, whom every muse and grace adorn, Whom I foresee to better fortune born, Be kind to my remains; and O defend, Against your judgment, your departed friend! Let not the insulting foe my fame pursue, But shade those laurels which descend to you: And take for tribute what these lines express; You merit more, nor could my love do less. EPISTLE THE THIRTEENTH. TO MR. GRANVILLE, ON HIS EXCELLENT TRAGEDY, CALLED HEROIC LOVE. Auspicious poet, wert thou not my friend, How could I envy, what I must commend! But since 'tis nature's law, in love and wit, That youth should reign, and withering age submit, With less regret those laurels I resign, Which, dying on my brows, revive on thine. With better grace an ancient chief may yield The long contended honours of the field, Than venture all his fortune at a cast, And fight, like Hannibal, to lose at last. Young princes, obstinate to win the prize, Though yearly beaten, yearly yet they rise: Old monarchs, though successful, still in doubt, Catch at a peace, and wisely turn devout. Thine be the laurel, then; thy blooming age Can best, if any can, support the stage; Which so declines, that shortly we may see Players and plays reduced to second infancy: Sharp to the world, but thoughtless of renown, They plot not on the stage, but on the town, And, in despair their empty pit to fill, Set up some foreign monster in a bill. Thus they jog on, still tricking, never thriving, And murdering plays, which they miscall reviving. Our sense is nonsense, through their pipes conveyed; Scarce can a poet know the play he made, 'Tis so disguised in death; nor thinks 'tis he That suffers in the mangled tragedy. Thus Itys first was killed, and after dressed For his own sire, the chief invited guest. I say not this of thy successful scenes, Where thine was all the glory, theirs the gains. With length of time, much judgment, and more toil, Not ill they acted what they could not spoil. Their setting sun Mr. Betterton's Company in Lincoln's Inn Fields. still shoots a glimmering ray, Like ancient Rome, majestic in decay; And better gleanings their worn soil can boast, Than the crab-vintage of the neighbouring coast. Drury Lane Playhouse. This difference yet the judging world will see; Thou copiest Homer, and they copy thee. EPISTLE THE FOURTEENTH. TO MY FRIEND MR. MOTTEUX, ON HIS TRAGEDY CALLED BEAUTY IN DISTRESS, PUBLISHED IN 1698. 'Tis hard, my friend, to write in such an age, As damns not only poets, but the stage. That sacred art, by heaven itself infused, Which Moses, David, Solomon, have used, Is now to be no more: the Muses' foes Would sink their Maker's praises into prose. Were they content to prune the lavish vine Of straggling branches, and improve the wine, Who, but a madman, would his faults defend? All would submit; for all but fools will mend. But when to common sense they give the lie, And turn distorted words to blasphemy, They give the scandal; and the wise discern, Their glosses teach an age, too apt to learn. What I have loosely, or profanely, writ, Let them to fires, their due desert, commit: Nor, when accused by me, let them complain; Their faults, and not their function, I arraign. Rebellion, worse than witchcraft, they pursued; The pulpit preached the crime, the people rued. The stage was silenced; for the saints would see In fields performed their plotted tragedy. But let us first reform, and then so live, That we may teach our teachers to forgive; Our desk be placed below their lofty chairs, Ours be the practice, as the precept theirs. The moral part, at least we may divide, Humility reward, and punish pride; Ambition, interest, avarice, accuse; These are the province of the tragic muse. These hast thou chosen; and the public voice Has equalled thy performance with thy choice. Time, action, place, are so preserved by thee, That e'en Corneille might with envy see The alliance of his tripled unity. Thy incidents, perhaps, too thick are sown, But too much plenty is thy fault alone. At least but two can that good crime commit, Thou in design, and Wycherly in wit. Let thy own Gauls condemn thee, if they dare, Contented to be thinly regular: Born there, but not for them, our fruitful soil With more increase rewards thy happy toil. Their tongue, enfeebled, is refined so much, That, like pure gold, it bends at every touch. Our sturdy Teuton yet will art obey, More fit for manly thought, and strengthened with allay. But whence art thou inspired, and thou alone, To flourish in an idiom not thy own? It moves our wonder, that a foreign guest Should overmatch the most, and match the best. In under-praising thy deserts, I wrong; Here find the first deficience of our tongue: Words, once my stock, are wanting, to commend So great a poet, and so good a friend. EPISTLE THE FIFTEENTH. TO MY HONOURED KINSMAN JOHN DRIDEN, OF CHESTERTON, IN THE COUNTY OF HUNTINGDON, ESQ. How blessed is he, who leads a country life, Unvexed with anxious cares, and void of strife! Who, studying peace, and shunning civil rage, Enjoyed his youth, and now enjoys his age: All who deserve his love, he makes his own; And, to be loved himself, needs only to be known. Just, good, and wise, contending neighbours come, From your award to wait their final doom; And, foes before, return in friendship home. Without their cost, you terminate the cause, And save the expence of long litigious laws; Where suits are traversed, and so little won, That he who conquers is but last undone: Such are not your decrees; but so designed, The sanction leaves a lasting peace behind; Like your own soul, serene, a pattern of your mind. Promoting concord, and composing strife, Lord of yourself, uncumbered with a wife; Where, for a year, a month, perhaps a night, Long penitence succeeds a short delight: Minds are so hardly matched, that even the first, Though paired by heaven, in Paradise were cursed. For man and woman, though in one they grow, Yet, first or last, return again to two. He to God's image, she to his was made; So, farther from the fount the stream at random strayed. How could he stand, when, put to double pain, He must a weaker than himself sustain! Each might have stood perhaps, but each alone; Two wrestlers help to pull each other down. Not that my verse would blemish all the fair; But yet if some be bad, 'tis wisdom to beware, And better shun the bait, than struggle in the snare. Thus have you shunned, and shun the married state, Trusting as little as you can to fate. No porter guards the passage of your door, To admit the wealthy, and exclude the poor; For God, who gave the riches, gave the heart, To sanctify the whole, by giving part; Heaven, who foresaw the will, the means has wrought, And to the second son a blessing brought; The first-begotten had his father's share; But you, like Jacob, are Rebecca's heir. So may your stores and fruitful fields increase; And ever be you blessed, who live to bless. As Ceres sowed, where-e'er her chariot flew; As heaven in deserts rained the bread of dew; So free to many, to relations most, You feed with manna your own Israel host. With crowds attended of your ancient race, You seek the champaign sports, or sylvan chace; With well-breathed beagles you surround the wood, Even then industrious of the common good; And often have you brought the wily fox To suffer for the firstlings of the flocks; Chased even amid the folds, and made to bleed, Like felons, where they did the murderous deed. This fiery game your active youth maintained; Not yet by years extinguished, though restrained: You season still with sports your serious hours; For age but tastes of pleasures, youth devours. The hare in pastures or in plains is found, Emblem of human life; who runs the round, And, after all his wandering ways are done, His circle fills, and ends where he begun, Just as the setting meets the rising sun. Thus princes ease their cares; but happier he, Who seeks not pleasure through necessity, Than such as once on slippery thrones were placed, And chasing, sigh to think themselves are chased. So lived our sires, ere doctors learned to kill, And multiplied with theirs the weekly bill. The first physicians by debauch were made; Excess began, and sloth sustains the trade. Pity the generous kind their cares bestow To search forbidden truths, (a sin to know,) To which if human science could attain, The doom of death, pronounced by God, were vain. In vain the leech would interpose delay; Fate fastens first, and vindicates the prey. What help from art's endeavours can we have? Guibbons but guesses, nor is sure to save; But Maurus sweeps whole parishes, and peoples every grave; And no more mercy to mankind will use, Than when he robbed and murdered Maro's muse. Would'st thou be soon dispatched, and perish whole, Trust Maurus with thy life, and Milbourne with thy soul. By chase our long-lived fathers earned their food; Toil strung the nerves, and purified the blood: But we their sons, a pampered race of men, Are dwindled down to threescore years and ten. Better to hunt in fields, for health unbought, Than fee the doctor for a nauseous draught. The wise, for cure, on exercise depend; God never made his work for man to mend. The tree of knowledge, once in Eden placed, Was easy found, but was forbid the taste: O had our grandsire walked without his wife, He first had sought the better plant of life! Now both are lost: yet, wandering in the dark, Physicians, for the tree, have found the bark; They, labouring for relief of human kind, With sharpened sight some remedies may find; The apothecary-train is wholly blind. From files a random recipe they take, And many deaths of one prescription make. Garth, generous as his muse, prescribes and gives; The shopman sells, and by destruction lives: Ungrateful tribe! who, like the viper's brood, From Med'cine issuing, suck their mother's blood! Let these obey, and let the learned prescribe, That men may die without a double bribe; Let them, but under their superiors, kill, When doctors first have signed the bloody bill; He 'scapes the best, who, nature to repair, Draws physic from the fields, in draughts of vital air. You hoard not health for your own private use, But on the public spend the rich produce. When, often urged, unwilling to be great, Your country calls you from your loved retreat, And sends to senates, charged with common care, Which none more shuns, and none can better bear: Where could they find another formed so fit, To poise, with solid sense, a sprightly wit? Were these both wanting, as they both abound, Where could so firm integrity be found? Well born, and wealthy, wanting no support, You steer betwixt the country and the court; Nor gratify whate'er the great desire, Nor grudging give, what public needs require. Part must be left, a fund when foes invade, And part employed to roll the watery trade: Even Canaan's happy land, when worn with toil, Required a sabbath-year to mend the meagre soil. Good senators (and such are you) so give, That kings may be supplied, the people thrive: And he, when want requires, is truly wise, Who slights not foreign aids, nor overbuys, But on our native strength, in time of need, relies. Munster was bought, we boast not the success; Who fights for gain, for greater makes his peace. Our foes, compelled by need, have peace embraced; The peace both parties want, is like to last; Which if secure, securely we may trade; Or, not secure, should never have been made. Safe in ourselves, while on ourselves we stand, The sea is ours, and that defends the land. Be, then, the naval stores the nation's care, New ships to build, and battered to repair. Observe the war, in every annual course; What has been done, was done with British force: Namur subdued, is England's palm alone; The rest besieged, but we constrained the town: We saw the event that followed our success; France, though pretending arms, pursued the peace, Obliged, by one sole treaty, to restore What twenty years of war had won before. Enough for Europe has our Albion fought; Let us enjoy the peace our blood has bought. When once the Persian king was put to flight, The weary Macedons refused to fight; Themselves their own mortality confessed, And left the son of Jove to quarrel for the rest. Even victors are by victories undone; Thus Hannibal, with foreign laurels won, To Carthage was recalled, too late to keep his own. While sore of battle, while our wounds are green, Why should we tempt the doubtful die again? In wars renewed, uncertain of success; Sure of a share, as umpires of the peace. A patriot both the king and country serves; Prerogative and privilege preserves: Of each our laws the certain limit show; One must not ebb, nor t'other overflow: Betwixt the prince and parliament we stand, The barriers of the state on either hand; May neither overflow, for then they drown the land. When both are full, they feed our blessed abode; Like those that watered once the Paradise of God. Some overpoise of sway, by turns, they share; In peace the people, and the prince in war; Consuls of moderate power in calms were made; When the Gauls came, one sole dictator swayed. Patriots, in peace, assert the people's right, With noble stubbornness resisting might; No lawless mandates from the court receive, Nor lend by force, but in a body give. Such was your generous grandsire; free to grant In parliaments, that weighed their prince's want: But so tenacious of the common cause, As not to lend the king against his laws; And, in a loathsome dungeon doomed to lie, In bonds retained his birthright liberty, And shamed oppression, till it set him free. O true descendant of a patriot line, Who, while thou shar'st their lustre, lend'st them thine, Vouchsafe this picture of thy soul to see; 'Tis so far good, as it resembles thee; The beauties to the original I owe, Which when I miss, my own defects I show Nor think the kindred Muses thy disgrace; A poet is not born in every race. Two of a house few ages can afford, One to perform, another to record. Praiseworthy actions are by thee embraced, And 'tis my praise to make thy praises last. For even when death dissolves our human frame, The soul returns to heaven from whence it came; Earth keeps the body, verse preserves the fame. EPISTLE THE SIXTEENTH. TO SIR GODFREY KNELLER, PRINCIPAL PAINTER TO HIS MAJESTY. Once I beheld the fairest of her kind, And still the sweet idea charms my mind: True, she was dumb; for nature gazed so long, Pleased with her work, that she forgot her tongue; But, smiling, said—She still shall gain the prize; I only have transferred it to her eyes. Such are thy pictures, Kneller, such thy skill, That nature seems obedient to thy will; Comes out, and meets thy pencil in the draught, Lives there, and wants but words to speak her thought. At least thy pictures look a voice; and we Imagine sounds, deceived to that degree, We think 'tis somewhat more than just to see. Shadows are but privations of the light; Yet, when we walk, they shoot before the sight; With us approach, retire, arise, and fall; Nothing themselves, and yet expressing all. Such are thy pieces, imitating life So near, they almost conquer'd in the strife; And from their animated canvas came, Demanding souls, and loosened from the frame. Prometheus, were he here, would cast away His Adam, and refuse a soul to clay; And either would thy noble work inspire, Or think it warm enough, without his fire. But vulgar hands may vulgar likeness raise; This is the least attendant on thy praise: From hence the rudiments of art began; A coal, or chalk, first imitated man: Perhaps the shadow, taken on a wall, Gave outlines to the rude original; Ere canvas yet was strained, before the grace Of blended colours found their use and place, Or cypress tablets first received a face. By slow degrees the godlike art advanced; As man grew polished, picture was enhanced: Greece added posture, shade, and perspective, And then the mimic piece began to live. Yet perspective was lame, no distance true, But all came forward in one common view: No point of light was known, no bounds of art; When light was there, it knew not to depart, But glaring on remoter objects played; Not languished and insensibly decayed. Rome raised not art, but barely kept alive, And with old Greece unequally did strive; Till Goths and Vandals, a rude northern race, Did all the matchless monuments deface. Then all the Muses in one ruin lie, And rhyme began to enervate poetry. Thus, in a stupid military state, The pen and pencil find an equal fate. Flat faces, such as would disgrace a screen, Such as in Bantam's embassy were seen, Unraised, unrounded, were the rude delight Of brutal nations, only born to fight. Long time the sister arts, in iron sleep, A heavy Sabbath did supinely keep; At length, in Raphael's age, at once they rise, Stretch all their limbs, and open all their eyes. Thence rose the Roman, and the Lombard line; One coloured best, and one did best design. Raphael's, like Homer's, was the nobler part, But Titian's painting looked like Virgil's art. Thy genius gives thee both; where true design, Postures unforced, and lively colours join, Likeness is ever there; but still the best, (Like proper thoughts in lofty language drest,) Where light, to shades descending, plays, not strives, Dies by degrees, and by degrees revives. Of various parts a perfect whole is wrought; Thy pictures think, and we divine their thought. Shakespeare, thy gift, I place before my sight; Shakespeare's picture, drawn by Sir Godfrey Kneller, and given to the author. With awe, I ask his blessing ere I write; With reverence look on his majestic face; Proud to be less, but of his godlike race. His soul inspires me, while thy praise I write, And I, like Teucer, under Ajax fight; Bids thee, through me, be bold; with dauntless breast Contemn the bad, and emulate the best. Like his, thy critics in the attempt are lost; When most they rail, know then, they envy most. In vain they snarl aloof; a noisy crowd, Like women's anger, impotent and loud. While they their barren industry deplore, Pass on secure, and mind the goal before, Old as she is, my muse shall march behind, Bear off the blast, and intercept the wind. Our arts are sisters, though not twins in birth, For hymns were sung in Eden's happy earth: For oh, the painter muse, though last in place, Has seized the blessing first, like Jacob's race. Apelles' art an Alexander found, And Raphael did with Leo's gold abound; But Homer was with barren laurel crowned. Thou hadst thy Charles a while, and so had I; But pass we that unpleasing image by. Rich in thyself, and of thyself divine, All pilgrims come and offer at thy shrine. A graceful truth thy pencil can command; The fair themselves go mended from thy hand. Likeness appears in every lineament, But likeness in thy work is eloquent. Though nature there her true resemblance bears, A nobler beauty in thy piece appears. So warm thy work, so glows the generous frame, Flesh looks less living in the lovely dame. Thou paint'st as we describe, improving still, When on wild nature we engraft our skill, Yet not creating beauties at our will. But poets are confined to narrower space, To speak the language of their native place; The painter widely stretches his command, Thy pencil speaks the tongue of every land. From hence, my friend, all climates are your own, Nor can you forfeit, for you hold of none. All nations all immunities will give To make you theirs, where'er you please to live; And not seven cities, but the world, would strive. Sure some propitious planet then did smile, When first you were conducted to this isle; Our genius brought you here, to enlarge our fame, For your good stars are everywhere the same. Thy matchless hand, of every region free, Adopts our climate, not our climate thee. Great Rome and Venice He travelled very young into Italy. early did impart To thee the examples of their wondrous art. Those masters, then but seen, not understood, With generous emulation fired thy blood; For what in nature's dawn the child admired, The youth endeavoured, and the man acquired. If yet thou hast not reached their high degree, 'Tis only wanting to this age, not thee. Thy genius, bounded by the times, like mine, Drudges on petty draughts, nor dare design A more exalted work, and more divine. For what a song, or senseless opera, Is to the living labour of a play; Or what a play to Virgil's work would be, Such is a single piece to history. But we, who life bestow, ourselves must live; Kings cannot reign, unless their subjects give; And they, who pay the taxes, bear the rule: Thus thou, sometimes, art forced to draw a fool; But so his follies in thy posture sink, The senseless idiot seems at last to think. Good heaven! that sots and knaves should be so vain, To wish their vile resemblance may remain, And stand recorded, at their own request, To future days, a libel or a jest! Else should we see your noble pencil trace Our unities of action, time, and place; A whole composed of parts, and those the best, With every various character exprest; Heroes at large, and at a nearer view; Less, and at distance, an ignoble crew; While all the figures in one action join, As tending to complete the main design. More cannot be by mortal art exprest, But venerable age shall add the rest: For time shall with his ready pencil stand, Retouch your figures with his ripening hand, Mellow your colours, and imbrown the teint, Add every grace, which time alone can grant; To future ages shall your fame convey, And give more beauties than he takes away. ELEGIES AND EPITAPHS. UPON THE DEATH OF LORD HASTINGS. Must noble Hastings immaturely die, The honour of his ancient family, Beauty and learning thus together meet, To bring a winding for a wedding sheet? Must virtue prove death's harbinger? must she, With him expiring, feel mortality? Is death, sin's wages, grace's now? shall art Make us more learned, only to depart? If merit be disease; if virtue, death; To be good, not to be; who'd then bequeath Himself to discipline? who'd not esteem Labour a crime? study self-murder deem? Our noble youth now have pretence to be Dunces securely, ignorant healthfully. Rare linguist, whose worth speaks itself, whose praise, Though not his own, all tongues besides do raise: Than whom great Alexander may seem less, Who conquered men, but not their languages. In his mouth nations speak; his tongue might be Interpreter to Greece, France, Italy. His native soil was the four parts o' the earth; All Europe was too narrow for his birth. A young apostle; and,—with reverence may I speak 't,—inspired with gift of tongues, as they. Nature gave him, a child, what men in vain Oft strive, by art though furthered, to obtain. His body was an orb, his sublime soul Did move on virtue's and on learning's pole; Whose regular motions better to our view, Than Archimedes' sphere, the heavens did shew. Graces and virtues, languages and arts, Beauty and learning, filled up all the parts. Heaven's gifts, which do like falling stars appear Scattered in others, all, as in their sphere, Were fixed, and conglobate in's soul, and thence Shone through his body, with sweet influence; Letting their glories so on each limb fall, The whole frame rendered was celestial. Come, learned Ptolemy, and trial make, If thou this hero's altitude can'st take: But that transcends thy skill; thrice happy all, Could we but prove thus astronomical. Lived Tycho now, struck with this ray which shone More bright i' the morn, than others beam at noon, He'd take his astrolabe, and seek out here What new star 'twas did gild our hemisphere. Replenished then with such rare gifts as these, Where was room left for such a foul disease? The nation's sin hath drawn that veil, which shrouds Our day-spring in so sad benighting clouds. Heaven would no longer trust its pledge, but thus Recalled it,—rapt its Ganymede from us. Was there no milder way but the small-pox, The very filthiness of Pandora's box? So many spots, like næves, our Venus soil? One jewel set off with so many a foil; Blisters with pride swelled, which through's flesh did sprout Like rosebuds, stuck i' the lily-skin about. Each little pimple had a tear in it, To wail the fault its rising did commit; Which, rebel-like, with its own lord at strife, Thus made an insurrection 'gainst his life. Or were these gems sent to adorn his skin, The cabinet of a richer soul within? No comet need foretell his change drew on, Whose corpse might seem a constellation. Oh had he died of old, how great a strife Had been, who from his death should draw their life; Who should, by one rich draught, become whate'er Seneca, Cato, Numa, Cæsar, were! Learned, virtuous, pious, great; and have by this An universal metempsychosis. Must all these aged sires in one funeral Expire? all die in one so young, so small? Who, had he lived his life out, his great fame Had swoln 'bove any Greek or Roman name. But hasty winter, with one blast, hath brought The hopes of autumn, summer, spring, to nought. Thus fades the oak i' the sprig, i' the blade the corn; Thus without young, this Phœnix dies, newborn. Must then old three-legged grey-beards with their gout, Catarrhs, rheums, aches, live three ages out? Time's offals, only fit for the hospital! Or to hang an antiquary's rooms withal! Must drunkards, lechers, spent with sinning, live With such helps as broths, possets, physic give? None live, but such as should die? shall we meet With none but ghostly fathers in the street? Grief makes me rail, sorrow will force its way, And showers of tears tempestuous sighs best lay. The tongue may fail; but overflowing eyes Will weep out lasting streams of elegies. But thou, O virgin-widow, left alone, Now thy beloved, heaven-ravished spouse is gone, Whose skilful sire in vain strove to apply Med'cines, when thy balm was no remedy; With greater than Platonic love, O wed His soul, though not his body, to thy bed: Let that make thee a mother; bring thou forth The ideas of his virtue, knowledge, worth; Transcribe the original in new copies; give Hastings o' the better part: so shall he live In's nobler half; and the great grandsire be Of an heroic divine progeny: An issue which to eternity shall last, Yet but the irradiations which he cast. Erect no mausoleums; for his best Monument is his spouse's marble breast. TO THE MEMORY OF MR. OLDHAM. Farewell, too little, and too lately known, Whom I began to think, and call my own: For sure our souls were near allied, and thine Cast in the same poetic mould with mine. One common note on either lyre did strike, And knaves and fools we both abhorred alike. To the same goal did both our studies drive; The last set out, the soonest did arrive. Thus Nisus fell upon the slippery place, Whilst his young friend performed and won the race. O early ripe! to thy abundant store What could advancing age have added more? It might (what nature never gives the young) Have taught the numbers of thy native tongue. But satire needs not those, and wit will shine Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line. A noble error, and but seldom made, When poets are by too much force betrayed. Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime, Still showed a quickness; and maturing time But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme. Once more, hail, and farewell! farewell, thou young But ah! too short, Marcellus of our tongue! Thy brows with ivy and with laurels bound; But fate and gloomy night encompass thee around. TO THE PIOUS MEMORY OF THE ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG LADY MRS. ANNE KILLIGREW, EXCELLENT IN THE TWO SISTER ARTS OF POESY AND PAINTING. AN ODE. [I.] Thou youngest virgin-daughter of the skies, Made in the last promotion of the blest; Whose palms, new plucked from paradise, In spreading branches more sublimely rise, Rich with immortal green above the rest: Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star, Thou roll'st above us, in thy wandering race, Or, in procession fixed and regular, Mov'st with the heaven's majestic pace; Or, called to more superior bliss, Thou tread'st with seraphims the vast abyss: Whatever happy region is thy place, Cease thy celestial song a little space; Thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine, Since heaven's eternal year is thine. Hear, then, a mortal muse thy praise rehearse, In no ignoble verse; But such as thy own voice did practise here, When thy first fruits of poesy were given, To make thyself a welcome inmate there; While yet a young probationer, And candidate of heaven. II. If by traduction came thy mind, Our wonder is the less to find A soul so charming from a stock so good; Thy father was transfused into thy blood: So wert thou born into a tuneful strain, An early, rich, and inexhausted vein. But if thy pre-existing soul Was formed, at first, with myriads more, It did through all the mighty poets roll, Who Greek or Latin laurels wore, And was that Sappho last, which once it was before. If so, then cease thy flight, O heaven-born mind! Thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich ore: Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find, Than was the beauteous frame she left behind: Return to fill or mend the choir of thy celestial kind. III. May we presume to say, that, at thy birth, New joy was sprung in heaven, as well as here on earth. For sure the milder planets did combine On thy auspicious horoscope to shine, And e'en the most malicious were in trine. Thy brother-angels at thy birth Strung each his lyre, and tuned it high, That all the people of the sky Might know a poetess was born on earth; And then, if ever, mortal ears Had heard the music of the spheres. And if no clustering swarm of bees On thy sweet mouth distilled their golden dew, 'Twas that such vulgar miracles Heaven had not leisure to renew: For all the blest fraternity of love Solemnised there thy birth, and kept thy holiday above. IV. O gracious God! how far have we Profaned thy heavenly gift of poesy? Made prostitute and profligate the muse, Debased to each obscene and impious use, Whose harmony was first ordained above For tongues of angels, and for hymns of love? O wretched we! why were we hurried down This lubrique and adulterate age, (Nay, added fat pollutions of our own) T'increase the steaming ordures of the stage? What can we say t'excuse our second fall? Let this thy vestal, heaven, atone for all: Her Arethusian stream remains unsoiled, Unmixed with foreign filth, and undefiled; Her wit was more than man, her innocence a child. V. Art she had none, yet wanted none; For nature did that want supply: So rich in treasures of her own, She might our boasted stores defy: Such noble vigour did her verse adorn, That it seemed borrowed where 'twas only born. Her morals, too, were in her bosom bred, By great examples daily fed, What in the best of books, her father's life, she read: And to be read herself she need not fear; Each test, and every light, her muse will bear, Though Epictetus with his lamp were there. E'en love (for love sometimes her muse exprest) Was but a lambent flame which played about her breast: Light as the vapours of a morning dream, So cold herself, whilst she such warmth exprest, 'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's stream. VI. Born to the spacious empire of the Nine, One would have thought she should have been content To manage well that mighty government; But what can young ambitious souls confine? To the next realm she stretched her sway, For Painture near adjoining lay, A plenteous province, and alluring prey. A chamber of dependencies was framed, (As conquerors will never want pretence, When armed, to justify the offence,) And the whole fief, in right of poetry, she claimed. The country open lay without defence; For poets frequent inroads there had made, And perfectly could represent The shape, the face, with every lineament, And all the large domains which the Dumb Sister swayed; All bowed beneath her government, Received in triumph wheresoe'er she went. Her pencil drew whate'er her soul designed, And oft the happy draught surpassed the image in her mind. The sylvan scenes of herds and flocks, And fruitful plains and barren rocks, Of shallow brooks that flowed so clear, The bottom did the top appear; Of deeper too and ampler floods, Which, as in mirrors, showed the woods; Of lofty trees, with sacred shades, And perspectives of pleasant glades, Where nymphs of brightest form appear, And shaggy satyrs standing near, Which them at once admire and fear. The ruins, too, of some majestic piece, Boasting the power of ancient Rome or Greece, Whose statues, friezes, columns, broken lie, And, though defaced, the wonder of the eye; What nature, art, bold fiction, e'er durst frame, Her forming hand gave feature to the name. So strange a concourse ne'er was seen before, But when the peopled ark the whole creation bore. VII. The scene then changed; with bold erected look Our martial king the sight with reverence strook: For, not content to express his outward part, Her hand called out the image of his heart: His warlike mind, his soul devoid of fear, His high-designing thoughts were figured there, As when, by magic, ghosts are made appear. Our phœnix-queen was pourtrayed too so bright, Beauty alone could beauty take so right: Her dress, her shape, her matchless grace, Were all observed, as well as heavenly face. With such a peerless majesty she stands, As in that day she took the crown from sacred hands: Before a train of heroines was seen, In beauty foremost, as in rank, the queen. Thus nothing to her genius was denied, But like a ball of fire the further thrown, Still with a greater blaze she shone, And her bright soul broke out on every side. What next she had designed, heaven only knows: To such immoderate growth her conquest rose, That fate alone its progress could oppose. VIII. Now all those charms, that blooming grace, The well-proportioned shape, and beauteous face, Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes; In earth the much-lamented virgin lies. Not wit, nor piety, could fate prevent; Nor was the cruel destiny content To finish all the murder at a blow, To sweep at once her life and beauty too; But, like a hardened felon, took a pride To work more mischievously slow, And plundered first, and then destroyed. O double sacrilege on things divine, To rob the relic, and deface the shrine! But thus Orinda died; IX. Heaven, by the same disease, did both translate; As equal were their souls, so equal was their fate. Meantime, her warlike brother on the seas His waving streamers to the winds displays, And vows for his return, with vain devotion, pays. Ah, generous youth! that wish forbear, The winds too soon will waft thee here: Slack all thy sails, and fear to come; Alas, thou know'st not, thou art wrecked at home! No more shalt thou behold thy sister's face, Thou hast already had her last embrace. But look aloft, and if thou ken'st from far Among the Pleiads a new-kindled star, If any sparkles than the rest more bright, 'Tis she that shines in that propitious light. X. When in mid-air the golden trump shall sound, To raise the nations under ground; When in the valley of Jehosaphat, The judging God shall close the book of fate, And there the last assizes keep, For those who wake, and those who sleep; When rattling bones together fly, From the four corners of the sky; When sinews o'er the skeletons are spread, Those clothed with flesh, and life inspires the dead; The sacred poets first shall hear the sound, And foremost from the tomb shall bound, For they are covered with the lightest ground; And straight, with inborn vigour, on the wing, Like mounting larks, to the new morning sing. There thou, sweet saint, before the choir shalt go, As harbinger of heaven, the way to show, The way which thou so well hast learnt below. UPON THE DEATH OF THE VISCOUNT OF DUNDEE. O last and best of Scots! who didst maintain Thy country's freedom from a foreign reign; New people fill the land now thou art gone, New gods the temples, and new kings the throne. Scotland and thou did each in other live; Nor wouldst thou her, nor could she thee survive. Farewell! who, dying, didst support the state, And couldst not fall but with thy country's fate. ELEONORA: A PANEGYRICAL POEM, DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF THE LATE COUNTESS OF ABINGDON. ? Superas evadere ad auras, Hoc opus, hic labor est. Pauci quos æquus amavit Jupiter, aut ardens evixit ad æthera virtus, Diis geniti potuere. Virgil, Æneid, lib. vi. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF ABINGDON, ETC. The introduction As when some great and gracious monarch dies, Soft whispers first, and mournful murmurs, rise Among the sad attendants; then the sound Soon gathers voice, and spreads the news around, Through town and country, till the dreadful blast Is blown to distant colonies at last, Who then, perhaps, were offering vows in vain, For his long life, and for his happy reign: So slowly, by degrees, unwilling fame Did matchless Eleonora's fate proclaim, Till public as the loss the news became. Of her charity.The nation felt it in the extremest parts, With eyes o'erflowing, and with bleeding hearts; But most the poor, whom daily she supplied, Beginning to be such, but when she died. For, while she lived, they slept in peace by night, Secure of bread, as of returning light, And with such firm dependence on the day, That need grew pampered, and forgot to pray; So sure the dole, so ready at their call, They stood prepared to see the manna fall. Such multitudes she fed, she clothed, she nurst, That she herself might fear her wanting first. Of her five talents, other five she made; Heaven, that had largely given, was largely paid; And in few lives, in wondrous few, we find A fortune better fitted to the mind. Nor did her alms from ostentation fall, Or proud desire of praise—the soul gave all: Unbribed it gave; or, if a bribe appear, No less than heaven, to heap huge treasures there. Want passed for merit at her open door: Heaven saw, he safely might increase his poor, And trust their sustenance with her so well, As not to be at charge of miracle. None could be needy, whom she saw or knew; All in the compass of her sphere she drew: He, who could touch her garment, was as sure, As the first Christians of the apostles' cure. The distant heard, by fame, her pious deeds, And laid her up for their extremest needs; A future cordial for a fainting mind; For, what was ne'er refused, all hoped to find, Each in his turn: the rich might freely come, As to a friend; but to the poor, 'twas home. As to some holy house the afflicted came, The hunger-starved, the naked, and the lame, Want and diseases fled before her name. For zeal like hers her servants were too slow; She was the first, where need required, to go; Herself the foundress and attendant too. Sure she had guests sometimes to entertain, Guests in disguise, of her great Master's train: Her Lord himself might come, for aught we know, Since in a servant's form he lived below: Beneath her roof he might be pleased to stay; Or some benighted angel, in his way, Might ease his wings, and, seeing heaven appear In its best work of mercy, think it there; Where all the deeds of charity and love Were in as constant method, as above, All carried on; all of a piece with theirs; As free her alms, as diligent her cares; As loud her praises, and as warm her prayers. Of her prudent management.Yet was she not profuse; but feared to waste, And wisely managed, that the stock might last; That all might be supplied, and she not grieve, When crowds appeared, she had not to relieve: Which to prevent, she still increased her store; Laid up, and spared, that she might give the more. So Pharaoh, or some greater king than he, Provided for the seventh necessity: Taught from above his magazines to frame, That famine was prevented ere it came. Thus heaven, though all-sufficient, shows a thrift In his economy, and bounds his gift; Creating for our day one single light, And his reflection too supplies the night. Perhaps a thousand other worlds, that lie Remote from us, and latent in the sky, Are lightened by his beams, and kindly nurst, Of which our earthy dunghill is the worst. Now, as all virtues keep the middle line, Yet somewhat more to one extreme incline, Such was her soul; abhorring avarice, Bounteous, but almost bounteous to a vice: Had she given more, it had profusion been, And turned the excess of goodness into sin. These virtues raised her fabric to the sky; Of her humility. For that which is next heaven is charity. But as high turrets for their airy steep Require foundations in proportion deep, And lofty cedars as far upward shoot As to the nether heavens they drive the root; So low did her secure foundation lie, She was not humble, but humility. Scarcely she knew that she was great, or fair, Or wise, beyond what other women are, Or, which is better, knew, but never durst compare. For, to be conscious of what all admire, And not be vain, advances virtue higher. But still she found, or rather thought she found, Her own worth wanting, others' to abound; Ascribed above their due to every one, Unjust and scanty to herself alone. Such her devotion was, as might give rules Of her piety. Of speculation to disputing schools, And teach us equally the scales to hold Betwixt the two extremes of hot and cold; That pious heat may moderately prevail, And we be warmed, but not be scorched with zeal. Business might shorten, not disturb, her prayer; Heaven had the best, if not the greater share. An active life long orisons forbids; Yet still she prayed, for still she prayed by deeds. Her every day was Sabbath; only free From hours of prayer, for hours of charity. Such as the Jews from servile toil released, Where works of mercy were a part of rest; Such as blest angels exercise above, Varied with sacred hymns and acts of love; Such Sabbaths as that one she now enjoys, E'en that perpetual one, which she employs (For such vicissitudes in heaven there are) In praise alternate, and alternate prayer. All this she practised here, that when she sprung Amidst the choirs, at the first sight she sung; Sung, and was sung herself in angels' lays; For, praising her, they did her Maker praise. All offices of heaven so well she knew, Before she came, that nothing there was new; And she was so familiarly received, As one returning, not as one arrived. Of her various virtues.Muse, down again precipitate thy flight; For how can mortal eyes sustain immortal light? But as the sun in water we can bear, Yet not the sun, but his reflection there, So let us view her here in what she was, And take her image in this watery glass: Yet look not every lineament to see; Some will be cast in shades, and some will be So lamely drawn, you'll scarcely know 'tis she. For where such various virtues we recite, 'Tis like the milky-way, all over bright, But sown so thick with stars, 'tis undistinguished light. Her virtue, not her virtues, let us call; For one heroic comprehends them all: One, as a constellation is but one, Though 'tis a train of stars, that, rolling on, Rise in their turn, and in the zodiac run, Ever in motion; now 'tis faith ascends, Now hope, now charity, that upward tends, And downwards with diffusive good descends. As in perfumes composed with art and cost, 'Tis hard to say what scent is uppermost; Nor this part musk or civet can we call, Or amber, but a rich result of all; So she was all a sweet, whose every part, In due proportion mixed, proclaimed the Maker's art. No single virtue we could most commend, Whether the wife, the mother, or the friend; For she was all, in that supreme degree, That as no one prevailed, so all was she. The several parts lay hidden in the piece; The occasion but exerted that, or this. A wife as tender, and as true withal, Of her conjugal virtues. As the first woman was before her fall: Made for the man, of whom she was a part; Made to attract his eyes, and keep his heart. A second Eve, but by no crime accurst; As beauteous, not as brittle as the first. Had she been first, still Paradise had been, And death had found no entrance by her sin. So she not only had preserved from ill Her sex and ours, but lived their pattern still. Love and obedience to her lord she bore; She much obeyed him, but she loved him more: Not awed to duty by superior sway, But taught by his indulgence to obey. Thus we love God, as author of our good; So subjects love just kings, or so they should. Nor was it with ingratitude returned; In equal fires the blissful couple burned; One joy possessed them both, and in one grief they mourned. His passion still improved; he loved so fast, As if he feared each day would be her last. Too true a prophet to foresee the fate That should so soon divide their happy state; When he to heaven entirely must restore That love, that heart, where he went halves before. Yet as the soul is all in every part, So God and he might each have all her heart. Of her love to her children.So had her children too; for charity Was not more fruitful, or more kind, than she: Each under other by degrees they grew; A goodly perspective of distant view. Anchises looked not with so pleased a face, In numbering o'er his future Roman race, And marshalling the heroes of his name, As, in their order, next to light they came; Nor Cybele, with half so kind an eye, Surveyed her sons and daughters of the sky; Proud, shall I say, of her immortal fruit? As far as pride with heavenly minds may suit. Her care of their education.Her pious love excelled to all she bore; New objects only multiplied it more. And as the chosen found the pearly grain As much as every vessel could contain; As in the blissful vision each shall share As much of glory as his soul can bear; So did she love, and so dispense her care. Her eldest thus, by consequence, was best, As longer cultivated than the rest. The babe had all that infant care beguiles, And early knew his mother in her smiles: But when dilated organs let in day To the young soul, and gave it room to play, At his first aptness, the maternal love Those rudiments of reason did improve: The tender age was pliant to command; Like wax it yielded to the forming hand: True to the artificer, the laboured mind With ease was pious, generous, just, and kind; Soft for impression, from the first prepared, Till virtue with long exercise grew hard: With every act confirmed, and made at last So durable as not to be effaced, It turned to habit; and, from vices free, Goodness resolved into necessity. Thus fixed she virtue's image, (that's her own,) Till the whole mother in the children shone; For that was their perfection: she was such, They never could express her mind too much. So unexhausted her perfections were, That, for more children, she had more to spare; For souls unborn, whom her untimely death Deprived of bodies, and of mortal breath; And, could they take the impressions of her mind, Enough still left to sanctify her kind. Then wonder not to see this soul extend Of her friendship. The bounds, and seek some other self, a friend: As swelling seas to gentle rivers glide, To seek repose, and empty out the tide; So this full soul, in narrow limits pent, Unable to contain her, sought a vent To issue out, and in some friendly breast Discharge her treasures, and securely rest; To unbosom all the secrets of her heart, Take good advice, but better to impart. For 'tis the bliss of friendship's holy state, To mix their minds, and to communicate; Though bodies cannot, souls can penetrate: Fixed to her choice, inviolably true, And wisely choosing, for she chose but few. Some she must have; but in no one could find A tally fitted for so large a mind. The souls of friends like kings in progress are, Still in their own, though from the palace far: Thus her friend's heart her country dwelling was, A sweet retirement to a coarser place; Where pomp and ceremonies entered not, Where greatness was shut out, and business well forgot. This is the imperfect draught; but short as far As the true height and bigness of a star Exceeds the measures of the astronomer. She shines above, we know; but in what place, How near the throne, and heaven's imperial face, By our weak optics is but vainly guessed; Distance and altitude conceal the rest. Reflections on the shortness of her life.Though all these rare endowments of the mind Were in a narrow space of life confined, The figure was with full perfection crowned; Though not so large an orb, as truly round. As when in glory, through the public place, The spoils of conquered nations were to pass, And but one day for triumph was allowed, The consul was constrained his pomp to crowd; And so the swift procession hurried on, That all, though not distinctly, might be shown: So in the straitened bounds of life confined, She gave but glimpses of her glorious mind; And multitudes of virtues passed along, Each pressing foremost in the mighty throng, Ambitious to be seen, and then make room For greater multitudes that were to come. Yet unemployed no minute slipped away; Moments were precious in so short a stay. The haste of heaven to have her was so great, That some were single acts, though each complete; But every act stood ready to repeat. Her fellow-saints with busy care will look For her blessed name in fate's eternal book; And, pleased to be outdone, with joy will see Numberless virtues, endless charity: But more will wonder at so short an age, To find a blank beyond the thirtieth page; And with a pious fear begin to doubt The piece imperfect, and the rest torn out. But 'twas her Saviour's time; and, could there be A copy near the original, 'twas she. She died in her thirty-third year. As precious gums are not for lasting fire, They but perfume the temple, and expire; So was she soon exhaled, and vanished hence; A short sweet odour, of a vast expense. She vanished, we can scarcely say she died; For but a now did heaven and earth divide: She passed serenely with a single breath; This moment perfect health, the next was death: One sigh did her eternal bliss assure; The manner of her death. So little penance needs, when souls are almost pure. As gentle dreams our waking thoughts pursue, Or, one dream passed, we slide into a new; So close they follow, such wild order keep, We think ourselves awake, and are asleep; So softly death succeeded life in her, She did but dream of heaven, and she was there. No pains she suffered, nor expired with noise; Her soul was whispered out with God's still voice; As an old friend is beckoned to a feast, And treated like a long-familiar guest. He took her as he found, but found her so, Her preparedness to die. As one in hourly readiness to go; E'en on that day, in all her trim prepared, As early notice she from heaven had heard, And some descending courier from above Had given her timely warning to remove; Or counselled her to dress the nuptial room, She died on Whitsunday night.For on that night the bridegroom was to come. He kept his hour, and found her where she lay, Clothed all in white, the livery of the day: Scarce had she sinned in thought, or word, or act, Unless omissions were to pass for fact; That hardly death a consequence could draw, To make her liable to nature's law. And, that she died, we only have to show The mortal part of her she left below; The rest, so smooth, so suddenly she went, Looked like translation through the firmament, Or like the fiery car on the third errand sent. Apostrophe to her soul.O happy soul! if thou canst view from high, Where thou art all intelligence, all eye, If looking up to God, or down to us, Thou find'st, that any way be pervious, Survey the ruins of thy house, and see Thy widowed and thy orphan family; Look on thy tender pledges left behind; And, if thou canst a vacant minute find From heavenly joys, that interval afford To thy sad children, and thy mourning lord. See how they grieve, mistaken in their love, And shed a beam of comfort from above; Give them, as much as mortal eyes can bear, A transient view of thy full glories there; That they with moderate sorrow may sustain, And mollify their losses in thy gain. Or else divide the grief; for such thou wert, That should not all relations bear a part, It were enough to break a single heart. Let this suffice: nor thou, great saint, refuse Epiphonema, or close of the poem. This humble tribute of no vulgar muse; Who, not by cares, or wants, or age deprest, Stems a wild deluge with a dauntless breast; And dares to sing thy praises in a clime Where vice triumphs, and virtue is a crime; Where e'en to draw the picture of thy mind, Is satire on the most of humankind: Take it, while yet 'tis praise; before my rage, Unsafely just, break loose on this bad age; So bad, that thou thyself hadst no defence From vice, but barely by departing hence. Be what, and where thou art; to wish thy place Were, in the best, presumption more than grace. Thy relics (such thy works of mercy are) Have, in this poem, been my holy care. As earth thy body keeps, thy soul the sky, So shall this verse preserve thy memory; For thou shalt make it live, because it sings of thee. ON THE DEATH OF AMYNTAS. A PASTORAL ELEGY. 'Twas on a joyless and a gloomy morn, Wet was the grass, and hung with pearls the thorn, When Damon, who designed to pass the day With hounds and horns, and chase the flying prey, Rose early from his bed; but soon he found The welkin pitched with sullen clouds around, An eastern wind, and dew upon the ground. Thus while he stood, and sighing did survey The fields, and curst the ill omens of the day, He saw Menalcas come with heavy pace: Wet were his eyes, and cheerless was his face: He wrung his hands, distracted with his care, And sent his voice before him from afar. “Return,” he cried, “return, unhappy swain, The spongy clouds are filled with gathering rain: The promise of the day not only crossed, But even the spring, the spring itself is lost. Amyntas—oh!”—he could not speak the rest, Nor needed, for presaging Damon guessed. Equal with heaven young Damon loved the boy, The boast of nature, both his parents' joy. His graceful form revolving in his mind; So great a genius, and a soul so kind, Gave sad assurance that his fears were true; Too well the envy of the gods he knew: For when their gifts too lavishly are placed, Soon they repent, and will not make them last. For sure it was too bountiful a dole, The mother's features, and the father's soul. Then thus he cried:—“The morn bespoke the news; The morning did her cheerful light diffuse; But see how suddenly she changed her face, And brought on clouds and rain, the day's disgrace; Just such, Amyntas, was thy promised race. What charms adorned thy youth, where nature smiled, And more than man was given us in a child! His infancy was ripe; a soul sublime In years so tender that prevented time: Heaven gave him all at once; then snatched away, Ere mortals all his beauties could survey; Just like the flower that buds and withers in a day.” MENALCAS. The mother, lovely, though with grief opprest, Reclined his dying head upon her breast. The mournful family stood all around; One groan was heard, one universal sound: All were in floods of tears and endless sorrow drowned. So dire a sadness sat on every look, Even Death repented he had given the stroke. He grieved his fatal work had been ordained, But promised length of life to those who yet remained. The mother's and her eldest daughter's grace, It seems, had bribed him to prolong their space. The father bore it with undaunted soul, Like one who durst his destiny control; Yet with becoming grief he bore his part, Resigned his son, but not resigned his heart. Patient as Job; and may he live to see, Like him, a new increasing family! DAMON. Such is my wish, and such my prophecy; For yet, my friend, the beauteous mould remains; Long may she exercise her fruitful pains! But, ah! with better hap, and bring a race More lasting, and endued with equal grace! Equal she may, but farther none can go; For he was all that was exact below. MENALCAS. Damon, behold yon breaking purple cloud; Hear'st thou not hymns and songs divinely loud? There mounts Amyntas; the young cherubs play About their godlike mate, and sing him on his way. He cleaves the liquid air; behold, he flies, And every moment gains upon the skies. The new-come guest admires the ethereal state, The sapphire portal, and the golden gate; And now admitted in the shining throng, He shows the passport which he brought along. His passport is his innocence and grace, Well known to all the natives of the place. Now sing, ye joyful angels, and admire Your brother's voice that comes to mend your quire: Sing you, while endless tears our eyes bestow; For, like Amyntas, none is left below. ON THE DEATH OF A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN. He, who could view the book of destiny, And read whatever there was writ of thee, O charming youth, in the first opening page, So many graces in so green an age, Such wit, such modesty, such strength of mind, A soul at once so manly and so kind, Would wonder when he turned the volume o'er, And, after some few leaves, should find no more, Nought but a blank remain, a dead void space, A step of life that promised such a race. We must not, dare not, think, that heaven began A child, and could not finish him a man; Reflecting what a mighty store was laid Of rich materials, and a model made: The cost already furnished; so bestowed, As more was never to one soul allowed: Yet after this profusion spent in vain, Nothing but mouldering ashes to remain, I guess not, lest I split upon the shelf, Yet, durst I guess, heaven kept it for himself; And giving us the use, did soon recall, Ere we could spare the mighty principal. Thus then he disappeared, was rarified, For 'tis improper speech to say he died: He was exhaled; his great Creator drew His spirit, as the sun the morning dew. 'Tis sin produces death; and he had none, But the taint Adam left on every son. He added not, he was so pure, so good, 'Twas but the original forfeit of his blood; And that so little, that the river ran More clear than the corrupted fount began. Nothing remained of the first muddy clay; The length of course had washed it in the way: So deep, and yet so clear, we might behold The gravel bottom, and that bottom gold. As such we loved, admired, almost adored, Gave all the tribute mortals could afford. Perhaps we gave so much, the powers above Grew angry at our superstitious love; For when we more than human homage pay, The charming cause is justly snatched away. Thus was the crime not his, but ours alone; And yet we murmur that he went so soon, Though miracles are short, and rarely shown. Learn then, ye mournful parents, and divide That love in many, which in one was tied. That individual blessing is no more, But multiplied in your remaining store. The flame's dispersed, but does not all expire; The sparkles blaze, though not the globe of fire. Love him by parts, in all your numerous race, And from those parts form one collected grace; Then, when you have refined to that degree, Imagine all in one, and think that one is he. UPON YOUNG MR. ROGERS, OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE. Of gentle blood, his parents' only treasure, Their lasting sorrow, and their vanished pleasure, Adorned with features, virtues, wit, and grace, A large provision for so short a race: More moderate gifts might have prolonged his date, Too early fitted for a better state: But, knowing heaven his home, to shun delay, He leaped o'er age, and took the shortest way. ON A NEPHEW. Stay, stranger, stay, and drop one tear. She always weeps, who laid him here; And will do till her race is run; His father's fifth, her only son. ON THE DEATH OF MR. PURCELL. SET TO MUSIC BY DR. BLOW. [I.] Mark how the lark and linnet sing; With rival notes They strain their warbling throats, To welcome in the spring. But in the close of night, When Philomel begins her heavenly lay, They cease their mutual spite, Drink in her music with delight, And, listening and silent, silent and listening, listening and silent obey. II. So ceased the rival crew when Purcell came; They sung no more, or only sung his fame. Struck dumb, they all admired the godlike man: The godlike man, Alas! too soon retired, As he too late began. We beg not hell our Orpheus to restore; Had he been there, Their sovereign's fear Had sent him back before. The power of harmony too well they know: He long ere this had tuned their jarring sphere, And left no hell below. III. The heavenly choir, who heard his notes from high, Let down the scale of music from the sky; They handed him along, And all the way he taught, and all the way they sung. Ye brethren of the lyre, and tuneful voice, Lament his lot, but at your own rejoice: Now live secure, and linger out your days; The gods are pleased alone with Purcell's lays, Nor know to mend their choice. EPITAPH ON THE LADY WHITMORE. Fair, kind, and true, a treasure each alone, A wife, a mistress, and a friend, in one; Rest in this tomb, raised at thy husband's cost, Here sadly summing, what he had, and lost. Come, virgins, ere in equal bands ye join, Come first and offer at her sacred shrine; Pray but for half the virtues of this wife, Compound for all the rest, with longer life; And wish your vows, like hers, may be returned, So loved when living, and, when dead, so mourned. EPITAPH ON MRS. MARGARET PASTON, OF BARNINGHAM, IN NORFOLK. So fair, so young, so innocent, so sweet, So ripe a judgment, and so rare a wit, Require at least an age in one to meet. In her they met; but long they could not stay, 'Twas gold too fine to fix without allay. Heaven's image was in her so well exprest, Her very sight upbraided all the rest; Too justly ravished from an age like this, Now she is gone, the world is of a piece. EPITAPH ON THE MONUMENT OF THE MARQUIS OF WINCHESTER. He who, in impious times, undaunted stood, And 'midst rebellion durst be just and good; Whose arms asserted, and whose sufferings more Confirmed the cause for which he fought before, Rests here, rewarded by an heavenly prince, For what his earthly could not recompence. Pray, reader, that such times no more appear; Or, if they happen, learn true honour here. Ark of this age's faith and loyalty, Which, to preserve them, heaven confined in thee. Few subjects could a king like thine deserve; And fewer, such a king so well could serve. Blest king, blest subject, whose exalted state By sufferings rose, and gave the law to fate! Such souls are rare, but mighty patterns given To earth, were meant for ornaments to heaven. EPITAPH ON SIR PALMES FAIRBORNE'S TOMB IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY. Ye sacred relics, which your marble keep, Here, undisturbed by wars, in quiet sleep; Discharge the trust, which, when it was below, Fairborne's undaunted soul did undergo, And be the town's palladium from the foe. Alive and dead these walls he will defend: Great actions great examples must attend. The Candian siege his early valour knew, Where Turkish blood did his young hands imbrue. From thence returning with deserved applause, Against the Moors his well-fleshed sword he draws; The same the courage, and the same the cause. His youth and age, his life and death, combine, As in some great and regular design, All of a piece throughout, and all divine. Still nearer heaven his virtues shone more bright, Like rising flames expanding in their height; The martyr's glory crowned the soldier's fight. More bravely British general never fell, Nor general's death was e'er revenged so well; Which his pleased eyes beheld before their close, Followed by thousand victims of his foes. To his lamented loss, for time to come, His pious widow consecrates this tomb. EPITAPH ON THE MONUMENT OF A FAIR MAIDEN LADY, WHO DIED AT BATH, AND IS THERE INTERRED. Below this marble monument is laid All that heaven wants of this celestial maid. Preserve, O sacred tomb, thy trust consigned; The mould was made on purpose for the mind: And she would lose, if, at the latter day, One atom could be mixed with other clay; Such were the features of her heavenly face, Her limbs were formed with such harmonious grace: So faultless was the frame, as if the whole Had been an emanation of the soul; Which her own inward symmetry revealed, And like a picture shone, in glass annealed; Or like the sun eclipsed, with shaded light; Too piercing, else, to be sustained by sight. Each thought was visible that rolled within; As through a crystal case the figured hours are seen. And heaven did this transparent veil provide, Because she had no guilty thoughts to hide. All white, a virgin-saint, she sought the skies, For marriage, though it sullies not, it dyes. High though her wit, yet humble was her mind; As if she could not, or she would not find How much her worth transcended all her kind. Yet she had learned so much of heaven below, That when arrived, she scarce had more to know; But only to refresh the former hint, And read her Maker in a fairer print. So pious, that she had no time to spare For human thoughts, but seemed confined to prayer; Yet in such charities she passed the day, 'Twas wondrous how she found an hour to pray. A soul so calm, it knew not ebbs or flows, Which passion could but curl, not discompose. A female softness, with a manly mind; A daughter duteous, and a sister kind; In sickness patient, and in death resigned. UNDER MR. MILTON'S PICTURE, BEFORE HIS PARADISE LOST. Three poets, in three distant ages born, Greece, Italy, and England, did adorn. The first, in loftiness of thought surpassed; The next, in majesty; in both, the last. The force of nature could no further go; To make a third, she joined the former two. ODES, SONGS, AND LYRICAL PIECES. FAREWELL, FAIR ARMIDA. A SONG. I Farewell, fair Armida, my joy and my grief! In vain I have loved you, and hope no relief; Undone by your virtue, too strict and severe, Your eyes gave me love, and you gave me despair: Now called by my honour, I seek with content The fate which in pity you would not prevent: To languish in love were to find, by delay, A death that's more welcome the speediest way. II On seas and in battles, in bullets and fire, The danger is less than in hopeless desire; My death's wound you give me, though far off I bear My fall from your sight—not to cost you a tear: But if the kind flood on a wave should convey, And under your window my body should lay, The wound on my breast when you happen to see, You'll say with a sigh—it was given by me. THE FAIR STRANGER. A SONG. I Happy and free, securely blest, No beauty could disturb my rest; My amorous heart was in despair To find a new victorious fair: II Till you, descending on our plains, With foreign force renew my chains; Where now you rule without control, The mighty sovereign of my soul. III Your smiles have more of conquering charms, Than all your native country's arms; Their troops we can expel with ease, Who vanquish only when we please. IV But in your eyes, O! there's the spell! Who can see them, and not rebel? You make us captives by your stay; Yet kill us if you go away. A SONG FOR ST. CECILIA'S DAY, 22d November 1687. I. From harmony, from heavenly harmony, This universal frame began: When nature underneath a heap Of jarring atoms lay, And could not heave her head, The tuneful voice was heard from high, “Arise, ye more than dead.” Then cold, and hot, and moist, and dry, In order to their stations leap, And Music's power obey. From harmony, from heavenly harmony, This universal frame began; From harmony to harmony Through all the compass of the notes it ran, The diapason closing full in man. II. What passion cannot music raise and quell? When Jubal struck the chorded shell, His listening brethren stood around, And, wondering, on their faces fell To worship that celestial sound: Less than a God they thought there could not dwell Within the hollow of that shell, That spoke so sweetly, and so well. What passion cannot music raise and quell? III. The trumpet's loud clangour Excites us to arms, With shrill notes of anger And mortal alarms. The double, double, double beat Of the thundering drum, Cries, hark! the foes come: Charge, charge! 'tis too late to retreat. IV. The soft complaining flute, In dying notes, discovers The woes of hopeless lovers; Whose dirge is whispered by the warbling lute. V. Sharp violins proclaim Their jealous pangs, and desperation, Fury, frantic indignation, Depth of pains, and height of passion, For the fair, disdainful dame. VI. But, oh! what art can teach, What human voice can reach, The sacred organ's praise? Notes inspiring holy love, Notes that wing their heavenly ways To mend the choirs above. VII. Orpheus could lead the savage race; And trees unrooted left their place, Sequacious of the lyre: But bright Cecilia raised the wonder higher; When to her organ vocal breath was given, An angel heard, and straight appeared, Mistaking earth for heaven. GRAND CHORUS. As from the power of sacred lays The spheres began to move, And sung the great Creator's praise To all the blessed above; So when the last and dreadful hour This crumbling pageant shall devour, The trumpet shall be heard on high, The dead shall live, the living die, And Music shall untune the sky. THE TEARS OF AMYNTA, FOR THE DEATH OF DAMON. A SONG. I On a bank, beside a willow, Heaven her covering, earth her pillow, Sad Amynta sighed alone; From the cheerless dawn of morning Till the dews of night returning, Singing thus, she made her moan: Hope is banished, Joys are vanished, Damon, my beloved, is gone! II Time, I dare thee to discover Such a youth, and such a lover; Oh, so true, so kind was he! Damon was the pride of nature, Charming in his every feature; Damon lived alone for me: Melting kisses, Murmuring blisses; Who so lived and loved as we! III Never shall we curse the morning, Never bless the night returning, Sweet embraces to restore: Never shall we both lie dying, Nature failing, love supplying All the joys he drained before. Death, come end me, To befriend me; Love and Damon are no more. A NEW SONG. I Sylvia, the fair, in the bloom of fifteen, Felt an innocent warmth as she lay on the green; She had heard of a pleasure, and something she guest By the towzing, and tumbling, and touching her breast. She saw the men eager, but was at a loss, What they meant by their sighing, and kissing so close; By their praying and whining, And clasping and twining, And panting and wishing, And sighing and kissing, And sighing and kissing so close. II Ah! she cried, ah, for a languishing maid, In a country of Christians, to die without aid! Not a Whig, or a Tory, or Trimmer at least, Or a Protestant parson, or Catholic priest, To instruct a young virgin, that is at a loss, What they meant by their sighing, and kissing so close! By their praying and whining, And clasping and twining, And panting and wishing, And sighing and kissing, And sighing and kissing so close. III Cupid, in shape of a swain, did appear, He saw the sad wound, and in pity drew near; Then showed her his arrow, and bid her not fear, For the pain was no more than a maiden may bear When the balm was infused, she was not at a loss, What they meant by their sighing, and kissing so close; By their praying and whining, And clasping and twining, And panting and wishing, And sighing and kissing, And sighing and kissing so close. THE LADY'S SONG. I A choir of bright beauties in spring did appear, To choose a May-lady to govern the year: All the nymphs were in white, and the shepherds in green, The garland was given, and Phyllis was queen; But Phyllis refused it, and sighing did say, I'll not wear a garland while Pan is away. II While Pan and fair Syrinx are fled from our shore, The Graces are banished, and Love is no more; The soft god of pleasure, that warmed our desires, Has broken his bow, and extinguished his fires, And vows that himself and his mother will mourn, Till Pan and fair Syrinx in triumph return. III Forbear your addresses, and court us no more, For we will perform what the deity swore: But, if you dare think of deserving our charms, Away with your sheep-hooks, and take to your arms; Then laurels and myrtles your brows shall adorn, When Pan, and his son, and fair Syrinx, return. A SONG. [Fair, sweet, and young, receive a prize] I Fair, sweet, and young, receive a prize Reserved for your victorious eyes: From crowds, whom at your feet you see, O pity, and distinguish me! As I from thousand beauties more Distinguish you, and only you adore. II Your face for conquest was designed, Your every motion charms my mind; Angels, when you your silence break, Forget their hymns, to hear you speak; But when at once they hear and view, Are loath to mount, and long to stay with you. III No graces can your form improve, But all are lost, unless you love; While that sweet passion you disdain, Your veil and beauty are in vain: In pity then prevent my fate, For after dying all reprieve's too late. A SONG. [High state and honours to others impart] High state and honours to others impart, But give me your heart; That treasure, that treasure alone, I beg for my own. So gentle a love, so fervent a fire, My soul does inspire; That treasure, that treasure alone, I beg for my own. Your love let me crave; Give me in possessing So matchless a blessing; That empire is all I would have. Love's my petition, All my ambition; If e'er you discover So faithful a lover, So real a flame, I'll die, I'll die, So give up my game. RONDELAY. I Chloe found Amyntas lying, All in tears, upon the plain, Sighing to himself, and crying, Wretched I, to love in vain! Kiss me, dear, before my dying; Kiss me once, and ease my pain. II Sighing to himself, and crying, Wretched I, to love in vain! Ever scorning, and denying To reward your faithful swain. Kiss me, dear, before my dying; Kiss me once, and ease my pain. III Ever scorning, and denying To reward your faithful swain.— Chloe, laughing at his crying, Told him, that he loved in vain. Kiss me, dear, before my dying; Kiss me once, and ease my pain. IV Chloe, laughing at his crying, Told him, that he loved in vain; But, repenting, and complying, When he kissed, she kissed again: Kissed him up, before his dying; Kissed him up, and eased his pain. A SONG. [Go tell Amynta, gentle swain] I Go tell Amynta, gentle swain, I would not die, nor dare complain: Thy tuneful voice with numbers join, Thy words will more prevail than mine. To souls oppressed, and dumb with grief, The gods ordain this kind relief, That music should in sounds convey, What dying lovers dare not say. II A sigh or tear, perhaps, she'll give, But love on pity cannot live. Tell her that hearts for hearts were made, And love with love is only paid. Tell her my pains so fast increase, That soon they will be past redress; But, ah! the wretch that speechless lies, Attends but death to close his eyes. A SONG TO A FAIR YOUNG LADY, GOING OUT OF TOWN IN THE SPRING. I Ask not the cause, why sullen spring So long delays her flowers to bear? Why warbling birds forget to sing, And winter storms invert the year? Chloris is gone, and fate provides To make it spring where she resides. II Chloris is gone, the cruel fair; She cast not back a pitying eye; But left her lover in despair, To sigh, to languish, and to die. Ah, how can those fair eyes endure, To give the wounds they will not cure! III Great god of love, why hast thou made A face that can all hearts command, That all religions can invade, And change the laws of every land? Where thou hadst placed such power before, Thou shouldst have made her mercy more. IV When Chloris to the temple comes, Adoring crowds before her fall; She can restore the dead from tombs, And every life but mine recall. I only am, by love, designed To be the victim for mankind. ALEXANDER'S FEAST, OR THE POWER OF MUSIC; AN ODE IN HONOUR OF ST. CECILIA'S DAY. I. 'Twas at the royal feast, for Persia won By Philip's warlike son: Aloft, in awful state, The godlike hero sate On his imperial throne. His valiant peers were placed around; Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound: (So should desert in arms be crowned.) The lovely Thais, by his side, Sate like a blooming eastern bride, In flower of youth and beauty's pride. Happy, happy, happy pair! None but the brave, None but the brave, None but the brave deserves the fair. CHORUS. Happy, happy, happy pair! None but the brave, None but the brave, None but the brave deserves the fair. II. Timotheus, placed on high Amid the tuneful quire, With flying fingers touched the lyre: The trembling notes ascend the sky, And heavenly joys inspire. The song began from Jove, Who left his blissful seats above, (Such is the power of mighty love.) A dragon's fiery form belied the god; Sublime on radiant spires he rode, When he to fair Olympia pressed, And while he sought her snowy breast; Then, round her slender waist he curled, And stamped an image of himself, a sovereign of the world. The listening crowd admire the lofty sound, A present deity! they shout around; A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound. With ravished ears, The monarch hears; Assumes the god, Affects to nod, And seems to shake the spheres. CHORUS. With ravished ears, The monarch hears; Assumes the god, Affects to nod, And seems to shake the spheres. III. The praise of Bacchus, then, the sweet musician sung; Of Bacchus ever fair, and ever young. The jolly god in triumph comes; Sound the trumpets, beat the drums; Flushed with a purple grace He shows his honest face: Now, give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes. Bacchus, ever fair and young, Drinking joys did first ordain; Bacchus' blessings are a treasure, Drinking is the soldier's pleasure; Rich the treasure, Sweet the pleasure, Sweet is pleasure after pain. CHORUS. Bacchus' blessings are a treasure, Drinking is the soldier's pleasure; Rich the treasure, Sweet the pleasure, Sweet is pleasure after pain. IV. Soothed with the sound, the king grew vain: Fought all his battles o'er again; And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain.— The master saw the madness rise, His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes; And, while he heaven and earth defied, Changed his hand, and checked his pride. He chose a mournful muse, Soft pity to infuse, He sung Darius great and good, By too severe a fate, Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen, Fallen from his high estate, And weltering in his blood: Deserted, at his utmost need, By those his former bounty fed; On the bare earth exposed he lies, With not a friend to close his eyes. With downcast looks the joyless victor sate, Revolving, in his altered soul, The various turns of chance below; And, now and then, a sigh he stole, And tears began to flow. CHORUS. Revolving, in his altered soul, The various turns of chance below; And, now and then, a sigh he stole, And tears began to flow. V. The mighty master smiled, to see That love was in the next degree; 'Twas but a kindred-sound to move, For pity melts the mind to love. Softly sweet, in Lydian measures, Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures: War, he sung, is toil and trouble; Honour, but an empty bubble; Never ending, still beginning, Fighting still, and still destroying: If the world be worth thy winning, Think, O think it worth enjoying; Lovely Thais sits beside thee, Take the good the gods provide thee— The many rend the skies with loud applause; So Love was crowned, but Music won the cause. The prince, unable to conceal his pain, Gazed on the fair, Who caused his care, And sighed and looked, sighed and looked, Sighed and looked, and sighed again; At length, with love and wine at once oppressed, The vanquished victor sunk upon her breast. CHORUS. The prince, unable to conceal his pain, Gazed on the fair, Who caused his care, And sighed and looked, sighed and looked, Sighed and looked, and sighed again; At length, with love and wine at once oppressed, The vanquished victor sunk upon her breast. VI. Now strike the golden lyre again; A louder yet, and yet a louder strain. Break his bands of sleep asunder, And rouse him, like a rattling peal of thunder Hark, hark! the horrid sound Has raised up his head; As awaked from the dead, And amazed, he stares around. Revenge, revenge! Timotheus cries, See the furies arise; See the snakes, that they rear, How they hiss in their hair, And the sparkles that flash from their eyes! Behold a ghastly band, Each a torch in his hand! Those are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain, And, unburied, remain Inglorious on the plain: Give the vengeance due To the valiant crew. Behold how they toss their torches on high, How they point to the Persian abodes, And glittering temples of their hostile gods.— The princes applaud, with a furious joy, And the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy; Thais led the way, To light him to his prey, And, like another Helen, fired another Troy. CHORUS. And the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy; Thais led the way, To light him to his prey, And, like another Helen, fired another Troy. VII. Thus, long ago, Ere heaving bellows learned to blow, While organs yet were mute, Timotheus, to his breathing flute, And sounding lyre, Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire. At last divine Cecilia came, Inventress of the vocal frame; The sweet enthusiast, from her sacred store, Enlarged the former narrow bounds, And added length to solemn sounds, With nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before. Let old Timotheus yield the prize, Or both divide the crown; He raised a mortal to the skies, She drew an angel down. GRAND CHORUS.

Creator Spirit, by whose aid The world's foundations first were laid, Come visit every pious mind; Come pour thy joys on humankind; From sin and sorrow set us free, And make thy temples worthy thee. O source of uncreated light, The Father's promised Paraclete! Thrice holy fount, thrice holy fire, Our hearts with heavenly love inspire; Come, and thy sacred unction bring To sanctify us, while we sing. Plenteous of grace, descend from high, Rich in thy sevenfold energy! Thou strength of his Almighty hand, Whose power does heaven and earth command. Proceeding Spirit, our defence, Who dost the gifts of tongues dispense, And crown'st thy gift with eloquence. Refine and purge our earthy parts; But, oh, inflame and fire our hearts! Our frailties help, our vice control, Submit the senses to the soul; And, when rebellious they are grown, Then lay thy hand, and hold them down. Chase from our minds the infernal foe; And peace, the fruit of love, bestow; And, lest our feet should step astray, Protect and guide us in the way. Make us eternal truths receive, And practise all that we believe; Give us thyself, that we may see The Father, and the Son, by thee. Immortal honour, endless fame, Attend the Almighty Father's name; The Saviour Son be glorified, Who for lost man's redemption died; And equal adoration be, Eternal Paraclete, to thee. FABLES. TALES FROM CHAUCER. TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND. PALAMON AND ARCITE; OR, THE KNIGHT'S TALE. TO HER GRACE THE DUCHESS OF ORMOND. WITH THE FOLLOWING POEM OF PALAMON AND ARCITE. Madam, The bard, who first adorned our native tongue, Tuned to his British lyre this ancient song; Which Homer might without a blush rehearse, And leaves a doubtful palm in Virgil's verse: He matched their beauties, where they most excel; Of love sung better, and of arms as well. Vouchsafe, illustrious Ormond, to behold What power the charms of beauty had of old; Nor wonder if such deeds of arms were done, Inspired by two fair eyes that sparkled like your own. If Chaucer by the best idea wrought, And poets can divine each other's thought, The fairest nymph before his eyes he set, And then the fairest was Plantagenet; Who three contending princes made her prize, And ruled the rival nations with her eyes; Who left immortal trophies of her fame, And to the noblest order gave the name. Like her, of equal kindred to the throne, You keep her conquests, and extend your own: As when the stars in their ethereal race, At length have rolled around the liquid space, At certain periods they resume their place, From the same point of heaven their course advance, And move in measures of their former dance; Thus, after length of ages, she returns, Restored in you, and the same place adorns; Or you perform her office in the sphere, Born of her blood, and make a new platonic year. O true Plantagenet, O race divine, (For beauty still is fatal to the line,) Had Chaucer lived that angel face to view, Sure he had drawn his Emily from you; Or had you lived to judge the doubtful right, Your noble Palamon had been the knight; And conquering Theseus from his side had sent Your generous lord, to guide the Theban government. Time shall accomplish that; and I shall see A Palamon in him, in you an Emily. Already have the Fates your path prepared, And sure presage your future sway declared: When westward, like the sun, you took your way, And from benighted Britain bore the day, Blue Triton gave the signal from the shore, The ready Nereids heard, and swam before To smooth the seas; a soft Etesian gale But just inspired, and gently swelled the sail: Portunus took his turn, whose ample hand Heaved up the lightened keel, and sunk the sand, And steered the sacred vessel safe to land. The land, if not restrained, had met your way, Projected out a neck, and jutted to the sea. Hibernia, prostrate at your feet, adored, In you, the pledge of her expected lord; Due to her isle, a venerable name; His father and his grandsire known to fame; Awed by that house, accustomed to command, The sturdy kerns in due subjection stand, Nor hear the reins in any foreign hand. At your approach, they crowded to the port; And scarcely landed, you create a court: As Ormond's harbinger to you they run, For Venus is the promise of the sun. The waste of civil wars, their towns destroyed, Pales unhonoured, Ceres unemployed, Were all forgot; and one triumphant day Wiped all the tears of three campaigns away. Blood, rapines, massacres, were cheaply bought, So mighty recompense your beauty brought. As when the dove returning bore the mark Of earth restored to the long-labouring ark, The relics of mankind, secure of rest, Ope'd every window to receive the guest, And the fair bearer of the message blessed: So, when you came, with loud repeated cries, The nation took an omen from your eyes, And God advanced his rainbow in the skies, To sign inviolable peace restored; The saints, with solemn shouts, proclaimed the new accord. When at your second coming you appear, (For I foretell that millenary year,) The sharpened share shall vex the soil no more, But earth unbidden shall produce her store; The land shall laugh, the circling ocean smile, And heaven's indulgence bless the holy isle. Heaven, from all ages, has reserved for you That happy clime, which venom never knew; Or if it had been there, your eyes alone Have power to chase all poison, but their own. Now in this interval, which fate has cast Betwixt your future glories and your past, This pause of power, 'tis Ireland's hour to mourn: While England celebrates your safe return, By which you seem the seasons to command, And bring our summers back to their forsaken land. The vanquished isle our leisure must attend, Till the fair blessing we vouchsafe to send; Nor can we spare you long, though often we may lend. The dove was twice employed abroad, before The world was dried, and she returned no more. Nor dare we trust so soft a messenger, New from her sickness, to that northern air; Rest here a while your lustre to restore, That they may see you, as you shone before; For yet, the eclipse not wholly past, you wade Through some remains, and dimness of a shade. A subject in his prince may claim a right, Nor suffer him with strength impaired to fight; Till force returns, his ardour we restrain, And curb his warlike wish to cross the main. Now past the danger, let the learned begin The inquiry, where disease could enter in; How those malignant atoms forced their way; What in the faultless frame they found to make their prey, Where every element was weighed so well, That heaven alone, who mixed the mass, could tell Which of the four ingredients could rebel; And where, imprisoned in so sweet a cage, A soul might well be pleased to pass an age. And yet the fine materials made it weak; Porcelain, by being pure, is apt to break; Even to your breast the sickness durst aspire, And, forced from that fair temple to retire, Profanely set the holy place on fire. In vain your lord, like young Vespasian, mourned, When the fierce flames the sanctuary burned; And I prepared to pay in verses rude A most detested act of gratitude: Even this had been your elegy, which now Is offered for your health, the table of my vow. Your angel sure our Morley's mind inspired, To find the remedy your ill required; As once the Macedon, by Jove's decree, Was taught to dream an herb for Ptolemy: Or heaven, which had such over-cost bestowed, As scarce it could afford to flesh and blood, So liked the frame, he would not work anew, To save the charges of another you. Or by his middle science did he steer, And saw some great contingent good appear Well worth a miracle to keep you here: And for that end, preserved the precious mould, Which all the future Ormonds was to hold; And meditated, in his better mind, An heir from you, who may redeem the failing kind. Blest be the power, which has at once restored The hopes of lost succession to your lord; Joy to the first and last of each degree, Virtue to courts, and, what I longed to see, To you the Graces, and the Muse to me. O daughter of the rose, whose cheeks unite The differing titles of the red and white; Who heaven's alternate beauty well display, The blush of morning, and the milky way; Whose face is paradise, but fenced from sin; For God in either eye has placed a cherubin. All is your lord's alone; even absent, he Employs the care of chaste Penelope. For him you waste in tears your widowed hours; For him your curious needle paints the flowers: Such works of old imperial dames were taught; Such, for Ascanius, fair Elissa wrought. The soft recesses of your hours improve The three fair pledges of your happy love: All other parts of pious duty done, You owe your Ormond nothing but a son; To fill in future times his father's place, And wear the garter of his mother's race. PALAMON AND ARCITE; OR, THE KNIGHT'S TALE. BOOK I. In days of old, there lived, of mighty fame, A valiant prince, and Theseus was his name; A chief, who more in feats of arms excelled, The rising nor the setting sun beheld. Of Athens he was lord; much land he won, And added foreign countries to his crown. In Scythia with the warrior queen he strove, Whom first by force he conquered, then by love; He brought in triumph back the beauteous dame, With whom her sister, fair Emilia, came. With honour to his home let Theseus ride, With love to friend, and fortune for his guide, And his victorious army at his side. I pass their warlike pomp, their proud array, Their shouts, their songs, their welcome on the way; But, were it not too long, I would recite The feats of Amazons, the fatal fight Betwixt the hardy queen, and hero knight; The town besieged, and how much blood it cost The female army, and the Athenian host; The spousals of Hippolyta the queen; What tilts and tourneys at the feast were seen; The storm at their return, the ladies' fear; But these, and other things, I must forbear. The field is spacious I design to sow, With oxen far unfit to draw the plough: The remnant of my tale is of a length To tire your patience, and to waste my strength; And trivial accidents shall be forborne, That others may have time to take their turn; As was at first enjoined us by mine host, That he whose tale is best, and pleases most, Should win his supper at our common cost. And therefore where I left, I will pursue This ancient story, whether false or true, In hope it may be mended with a new. The prince I mentioned, full of high renown, In this array drew near the Athenian town; When in his pomp and utmost of his pride, Marching, he chanced to cast his eye aside, And saw a quire of mourning dames, who lay, By two and two across the common way: At his approach they raised a rueful cry, And beat their breasts, and held their hands on high; Creeping and crying, till they seized at last, His courser's bridle, and his feet embraced. “Tell me,” said Theseus, “what and whence you are, And why this funeral pageant you prepare? Is this the welcome of my worthy deeds, To meet my triumph, in ill-omened weeds? Or envy you my praise, and would destroy With grief my pleasures, and pollute my joy? Or are you injured, and demand relief? Name your request, and I will ease your grief.” The most in years, of all the mourning train, Began; but sounded first away for pain: Then, scarce recovered, spoke:—“Nor envy we Thy great renown, nor grudge thy victory: 'Tis thine, O king, the afflicted to redress, And fame has filled the world with thy success: We wretched women sue for that alone, Which of thy goodness is refused to none; Let fall some drops of pity on our grief, If what we beg be just, and we deserve relief; For none of us, who now thy grace implore, But held the rank of sovereign queen before; Till, thanks to giddy chance, which never bears, That mortal bliss should last for length of years, She cast us headlong from our high estate, And here in hope of thy return we wait; And long have waited in the temple nigh, Built to the gracious goddess Clemency. But reverence thou the power, whose name it bears; Relieve the oppressed, and wipe the widow's tears. I, wretched I, have other fortune seen, The wife of Capaneus, and once a queen: At Thebes he fell; curst be the fatal day! And all the rest thou seest in this array, To make their moan, their lords in battle lost Before that town besieged by our confederate host; But Creon, old and impious, who commands The Theban city, and usurps the lands, Denies the rites of funeral fires to those Whose breathless bodies yet he calls his foes. Unburned, unburied, on a heap they lie; Such is their fate, and such his tyranny; No friend has leave to bear away the dead, But with their lifeless limbs his hounds are fed.” At this she shrieked aloud; the mournful train Echoed her grief, and, grovelling on the plain, With groans, and hands upheld, to move his mind, Besought his pity to their helpless kind. The prince was touched, his tears began to flow, And, as his tender heart would break in two, He sighed; and could not but their fate deplore, So wretched now, so fortunate before. Then lightly from his lofty steed he flew, And raising one by one the suppliant crew, To comfort each, full solemnly he swore, “That, by the faith which knights to knighthood bore, And whate'er else to chivalry belongs, He would not cease, till he revenged their wrongs; That Greece should see performed what he declared; And cruel Creon find his just reward.” He said no more, but, shunning all delay, Rode on, nor entered Athens on his way; But left his sister and his queen behind, And waved his royal banner in the wind, Where, in an argent field, the god of war Was drawn triumphant on his iron car; Red was his sword, and shield, and whole attire, And all the godhead seemed to glow with fire; Even the ground glittered where the standard flew, And the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue. High on his pointed lance, his pennon bore His Cretan fight, the conquered Minotaur: The soldiers shout around with generous rage, And in that victory their own presage. He praised their ardour; inly pleased to see His host the flower of Grecian chivalry. All day he marched, and all the ensuing night, And saw the city with returning light. The process of the war I need not tell, How Theseus conquered, and how Creon fell; Or after, how by storm the walls were won, Or how the victor sacked and burned the town; How to the ladies he restored again The bodies of their lords in battle slain; And with what ancient rites they were interred,— All these to fitter times shall be deferred: I spare the widows' tears, their woful cries, And howling at their husbands' obsequies; How Theseus at these funerals did assist, And with what gifts the mourning dames dismissed. Thus when the victor-chief had Creon slain, And conquered Thebes, he pitched upon the plain His mighty camp, and, when the day returned, The country wasted, and the hamlets burned, And left the pillagers, to rapine bred, Without control, to strip and spoil the dead, There, in a heap of slain, among the rest, Two youthful knights they found beneath a load oppressed Of slaughtered foes, whom first to death they sent, The trophies of their strength, a bloody monument. Both fair, and both of royal blood they seemed, Whom kinsmen to the crown the heralds deemed; That day in equal arms they fought for fame; Their swords, their shields, their surcoats, were the same. Close by each other laid, they pressed the ground, Their manly bosoms pierced with many a grisly wound; Nor well alive, nor wholly dead they were, But some faint signs of feeble life appear; The wand'ring breath was on the wing to part, Weak was the pulse, and hardly heaved the heart. These two were sisters' sons; and Arcite one, Much famed in fields, with valiant Palamon. From these their costly arms the spoilers rent, And softly both conveyed to Theseus' tent; Whom, known of Creon's line, and cured with care, He to his city sent as prisoners of the war, Hopeless of ransom, and condemned to lie In durance, doomed a lingering death to die. This done, he marched away with warlike sound, And to his Athens turned with laurels crowned, Where happy long he lived, much loved, and more renowned. But in a tower, and never to be loosed, The woful captive kinsmen are inclosed. Thus year by year they pass, and day by day, Till once,—'twas on the morn of cheerful May,— The young Emilia, fairer to be seen Than the fair lily on the flowery green, More fresh than May herself in blossoms new, For with the rosy colour strove her hue, Waked, as her custom was, before the day, To do the observance due to sprightly May; For sprightly May commands our youth to keep The vigils of her night, and breaks their sluggard sleep; Each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves; Inspires new flames, revives extinguished loves. In this remembrance, Emily, ere day, Arose, and dressed herself in rich array; Fresh as the month, and as the morning fair, Adown her shoulders fell her length of hair; A ribbon did the braided tresses bind, The rest was loose, and wantoned in the wind: Aurora had but newly chased the night, And purpled o'er the sky with blushing light, When to the garden walk she took her way, To sport and trip along in cool of day, And offer maiden vows in honour of the May. At every turn she made a little stand, And thrust among the thorns her lily hand To draw the rose, and every rose she drew, She shook the stalk, and brushed away the dew; Then party-coloured flowers of white and red She wove, to make a garland for her head. This done, she sung and carolled out so clear, That men and angels might rejoice to hear; Even wondering Philomel forgot to sing, And learned from her to welcome in the spring. The tower, of which before was mention made, Within whose keep the captive knights were laid, Built of a large extent, and strong withal, Was one partition of the palace wall; The garden was inclosed within the square, Where young Emilia took the morning air. It happened Palamon, the prisoner knight, Restless for woe, arose before the light, And with his jailer's leave desired to breathe An air more wholesome than the damps beneath. This granted, to the tower he took his way, Cheered with the promise of a glorious day; Then cast a languishing regard around, And saw, with hateful eyes, the temples crowned With golden spires, and all the hostile ground. He sighed, and turned his eyes, because he knew 'Twas but a larger jail he had in view; Then looked below, and from the castle's height Beheld a nearer and more pleasing sight; The garden, which before he had not seen, In spring's new livery clad of white and green, Fresh flowers in wide parterres, and shady walks between. This viewed, but not enjoyed, with arms across He stood, reflecting on his country's loss; Himself an object of the public scorn, And often wished he never had been born. At last, for so his destiny required, With walking giddy, and with thinking tired, He through a little window cast his sight, Though thick of bars, that gave a scanty light; But even that glimmering served him to descry The inevitable charms of Emily. Scarce had he seen, but, seized with sudden smart, Stung to the quick, he felt it at his heart; Struck blind with overpowering light, he stood, Then started back amazed, and cried aloud. Young Arcite heard, and up he ran with haste, To help his friend, and in his arms embraced; And asked him why he looked so deadly wan, And whence and how his change of cheer began? Or who had done the offence? “But if,” said he, “Your grief alone is hard captivity; For love of heaven with patience undergo A cureless ill, since fate will have it so: So stood our horoscope in chains to lie, And Saturn in the dungeon of the sky, Or other baleful aspect, ruled our birth, When all the friendly stars were under earth: Whate'er betides, by destiny 'tis done; And better bear like men, than vainly seek to shun.” “Nor of my bonds,” said Palamon again, “Nor of unhappy planets, I complain; But when my mortal anguish caused my cry, That moment I was hurt through either eye; Pierced with a random shaft, I faint away, And perish with insensible decay: A glance of some new goddess gave the wound, Whom, like Acteon, unaware I found. Look how she walks along yon shady space! Not Juno moves with more majestic grace, And all the Cyprian queen is in her face. If thou art Venus, (for thy charms confess, That face was formed in heaven, nor art thou less; Disguised in habit, undisguised in shape,) O help us captives from our chains to scape! But if our doom be past in bonds to lie For life, and in a loathsome dungeon die, Then be thy wrath appeased with our disgrace, And show compassion to the Theban race, Oppressed by tyrant power!”—While yet he spoke, Arcite on Emily had fixed his look; The fatal dart a ready passage found, And deep within his heart infixed the wound: So that if Palamon were wounded sore, Arcite was hurt as much as he, or more: Then from his inmost soul he sighed, and said, “The beauty I behold has struck me dead: Unknowingly she strikes, and kills by chance; Poison is in her eyes, and death in every glance. Oh, I must ask; nor ask alone, but move Her mind to mercy, or must die for love.” Thus Arcite: and thus Palamon replies, (Eager his tone, and ardent were his eyes,) “Speak'st thou in earnest, or in jesting vein?” “Jesting,” said Arcite, “suits but ill with pain.” “It suits far worse,” (said Palamon again, And bent his brows,) “with men who honour weigh, Their faith to break, their friendship to betray; But worst with thee, of noble lineage born, My kinsman, and in arms my brother sworn. Have we not plighted each our holy oath, That one should be the common good of both; One soul should both inspire, and neither prove His fellow's hindrance in pursuit of love? To this before the gods we gave our hands, And nothing but our death can break the bands. This binds thee, then, to further my design, As I am bound by vow to further thine: Nor canst, nor dar'st thou, traitor, on the plain, Appeach my honour, or thy own maintain; Since thou art of my council, and the friend Whose faith I trust, and on whose care depend. And wouldst thou court my lady's love, which I Much rather than release would choose to die? But thou, false Arcite, never shalt obtain Thy bad pretence; I told thee first my pain: For first my love began ere thine was born; Thou, as my council, and my brother sworn, Art bound to assist my eldership of right, Or justly to be deemed a perjured knight.” Thus Palamon; but Arcite, with disdain, In haughty language, thus replied again,— “Forsworn thyself: the traitor's odious name I first return, and then disprove thy claim. If love be passion, and that passion nurst With strong desires, I loved the lady first. Canst thou pretend desire, whom zeal inflamed To worship, and a power celestial named? Thine was devotion to the blest above, I saw the woman, and desired her love; First owned my passion, and to thee commend The important secret, as my chosen friend. Suppose (which yet I grant not) thy desire A moment elder than my rival fire; Can chance of seeing first thy title prove? And know'st thou not, no law is made for love? Law is to things which to free choice relate; Love is not in our choice, but in our fate: Laws are but positive; love's power, we see, Is nature's sanction, and her first decree. Each day we break the bond of human laws For love, and vindicate the common cause. Laws for defence of civil rights are placed; Love throws the fences down, and makes a general waste: Maids, widows, wives, without distinction fall; The sweeping deluge, love, comes on, and covers all. If then the laws of friendship I transgress, I keep the greater, while I break the less; And both are mad alike, since neither can possess. Both hopeless to be ransomed, never more To see the sun, but as he passes o'er. Like Æsop's hounds contending for the bone, Each pleaded right, and would be lord alone: The fruitless fight continued all the day; A cur came by, and snatched the prize away. As courtiers therefore jostle for a grant, And when they break their friendship, plead their want; So thou, if fortune will thy suit advance, Love on, nor envy me my equal chance: For I must love, and am resolved to try My fate, or, failing in the adventure, die.” Great was their strife, which hourly was renewed, Till each with mortal hate his rival viewed: Now friends no more, nor walking hand in hand, But when they met, they made a surly stand, And glared like angry lions as they passed, And wished that every look might be their last. It chanced at length, Pirithous came, to attend This worthy Theseus, his familiar friend: Their love in early infancy began, And rose as childhood ripened into man, Companions of the war; and loved so well, That when one died, as ancient stories tell, His fellow to redeem him went to hell. But to pursue my tale; to welcome home His warlike brother, is Pirithous come: Arcite of Thebes was known in arms long since, And honoured by this young Thessalian prince. Theseus, to gratify his friend and guest, Who made our Arcite's freedom his request, Restored to liberty the captive knight, But on these hard conditions I recite:— That if hereafter Arcite should be found Within the compass of Athenian ground, By day or night, or on whate'er pretence, His head should pay the forfeit of the offence. To this Pirithous for his friend agreed, And on his promise was the prisoner freed. Unpleased and pensive hence he takes his way, At his own peril; for his life must pay. Who now but Arcite mourns his bitter fate, Finds his dear purchase, and repents too late? “What have I gained,” he said, “in prison pent, If I but change my bonds for banishment? And banished from her sight, I suffer more In freedom, than I felt in bonds before; Forced from her presence, and condemned to live, Unwelcome freedom, and unthanked reprieve: Heaven is not, but where Emily abides, And where she's absent, all is hell besides. Next to my day of birth, was that accurst, Which bound my friendship to Pirithous first; Had I not known that prince, I still had been In bondage, and had still Emilia seen: For though I never can her grace deserve, 'Tis recompense enough to see and serve. O Palamon, my kinsman and my friend, How much more happy fates thy love attend! Thine is the adventure; thine the victory; Well has thy fortune turned the dice for thee: Thou on that angel's face may'st feed thine eyes, In prison, no; but blissful paradise! Thou daily seest that sun of beauty shine, And lov'st at least in love's extremest line. I mourn in absence, love's eternal night; And who can tell but since thou hast her sight, And art a comely, young, and valiant knight, Fortune (a various power) may cease to frown, And, by some ways unknown, thy wishes crown? But I, the most forlorn of humankind, Nor help can hope, nor remedy can find; But doomed to drag my loathsome life in care, For my reward, must end it in despair. Fire, water, air, and earth, and force of fates, That governs all, and heaven that all creates, Nor art, nor nature's hand can ease my grief; Nothing but death, the wretch's last relief: Then farewell youth, and all the joys that dwell With youth and life, and life itself, farewell! “But why, alas! do mortal men in vain Of fortune, fate, or Providence, complain? God gives us what He knows our wants require, And better things than those which we desire: Some pray for riches; riches they obtain; But, watched by robbers, for their wealth are slain: Some pray from prison to be freed; and come, When guilty of their vows, to fall at home; Murdered by those they trusted with their life, A favoured servant, or a bosom wife. Such dear-bought blessings happen every day, Because we know not for what things to pray. Like drunken sots about the streets we roam; Well knows the sot he has a certain home, Yet knows not how to find the uncertain place, And blunders on, and staggers every pace. Thus all seek happiness; but few can find, For far the greater part of men are blind. This is my case, who thought our utmost good Was in one word of freedom understood: The fatal blessing came; from prison free, I starve abroad, and lose the sight of Emily.” Thus Arcite; but if Arcite thus deplore His sufferings, Palamon yet suffers more. For when he knew his rival freed and gone, He swells with wrath, he makes outrageous moan, He frets, he fumes, he stares, he stamps the ground; The hollow tower with clamours rings around: With briny tears he bathed his fettered feet, And dropped all o'er with agony of sweat. “Alas!” he cried, “I, wretch! in prison pine, Too happy rival, while the fruit is thine: Thou liv'st at large, thou draw'st thy native air, Pleased with thy freedom, proud of my despair: Thou may'st, since thou hast youth and courage joined, A sweet behaviour and a solid mind, Assemble ours, and all the Theban race, To vindicate on Athens thy disgrace; And after, by some treaty made, possess Fair Emily, the pledge of lasting peace. So thine shall be the beauteous prize, while I Must languish in despair, in prison die. Thus all the advantage of the strife is thine, Thy portion double joys, and double sorrows mine.” The rage of jealousy then fired his soul, And his face kindled like a burning coal: Now cold despair, succeeding in her stead, To livid paleness turns the glowing red. His blood, scarce liquid, creeps within his veins, Like water which the freezing wind constrains. Then thus he said:—“Eternal deities, Who rule the world with absolute decrees, And write whatever time shall bring to pass, With pens of adamant, on plates of brass; What, is the race of humankind your care Beyond what all his fellow-creatures are? He with the rest is liable to pain, And like the sheep, his brother-beast, is slain. Cold, hunger, prisons, ills without a cure, All these he must, and, guiltless, oft endure; Or does your justice, power, or prescience fail, When the good suffer, and the bad prevail? What worse to wretched virtue could befall, If fate or giddy fortune governed all? Nay, worse than other beasts is our estate; Them, to pursue their pleasures, you create; We, bound by harder laws, must curb our will, And your commands, not our desires, fulfil: Then when the creature is unjustly slain, Yet, after death at least, he feels no pain; But man, in life surcharged with woe before, Not freed when dead, is doomed to suffer more. A serpent shoots his sting at unaware; An ambushed thief forelays a traveller; The man lies murdered, while the thief and snake, One gains the thickets, and one thrids the brake. This let divines decide; but well I know, Just, or unjust, I have my share of woe: Through Saturn seated in a luckless place, And Juno's wrath, that persecutes my race; Or Mars and Venus, in a quartil move My pangs of jealousy for Arcite's love.” Let Palamon oppressed in bondage mourn, While to his exiled rival we return. By this, the sun, declining from his height, The day had shortened to prolong the night: The lengthened night gave length of misery, Both to the captive lover and the free. For Palamon in endless prison mourns, And Arcite forfeits life if he returns. The banished never hopes his love to see, Nor hopes the captive lord his liberty: 'Tis hard to say who suffers greater pains; One sees his love, but cannot break his chains; One free, and all his motions uncontrolled, Beholds whate'er he would, but what he would behold. Judge as you please, for I will haste to tell What fortune to the banished knight befell. When Arcite was to Thebes returned again, The loss of her he loved renewed his pain; What could be worse, than never more to see His life, his soul, his charming Emily? He raved with all the madness of despair, He roared, he beat his breast, he tore his hair. Dry sorrow in his stupid eyes appears, For, wanting nourishment, he wanted tears: His eyeballs in their hollow sockets sink, Bereft of sleep; he loathes his meat and drink. He withers at his heart, and looks as wan As the pale spectre of a murdered man: That pale turns yellow, and his face receives The faded hue of sapless boxen leaves: In solitary groves he makes his moan, Walks early out, and ever is alone: Nor, mixed in mirth, in youthful pleasures shares, But sighs when songs and instruments he hears. His spirits are so low, his voice is drowned; He hears as from afar, or in a swound, Like the deaf murmurs of a distant sound: Uncombed his locks, and squalid his attire, Unlike the trim of love and gay desire; But full of museful mopings, which presage The loss of reason, and conclude in rage. This when he had endured a year and more, Now wholly changed from what he was before, It happened once, that, slumbering as he lay, He dreamed, (his dream began at break of day,) That Hermes o'er his head in air appeared, And with soft words his drooping spirits cheered: His hat, adorned with wings, disclosed the god, And in his hand he bore the sleep-compelling rod; Such as he seemed, when, at his sire's command, On Argus' head he laid the snaky wand. “Arise,” he said, “to conquering Athens go, There fate appoints an end of all thy woe.” The fright awakened Arcite with a start, Against his bosom bounced his heaving heart; But soon he said, with scarce-recovered breath, “And thither will I go, to meet my death, Sure to be slain; but death is my desire, Since in Emilia's sight I shall expire.” By chance he spied a mirror while he spoke, And gazing there beheld his altered look; Wondering, he saw his features and his hue So much were changed, that scarce himself he knew. A sudden thought then starting in his mind,— “Since I in Arcite cannot Arcite find, The world may search in vain with all their eyes, But never penetrate through this disguise. Thanks to the change which grief and sickness give, In low estate I may securely live, And see, unknown, my mistress day by day.” He said, and clothed himself in coarse array; A labouring hind in show: then forth he went, And to the Athenian towers his journey bent: One squire attended in the same disguise, Made conscious of his master's enterprise. Arrived at Athens, soon he came to court, Unknown, unquestioned in that thick resort; Proffering for hire his service at the gate, To drudge, draw water, and to run or wait. So fair befell him, that for little gain He served at first Emilia's chamberlain; And, watchful all advantages to spy, Was still at hand, and in his master's eye; And, as his bones were big, and sinews strong, Refused no toil that could to slaves belong; But from deep wells with engines water drew, And used his noble hands the wood to hew. He passed a year at least attending thus On Emily, and called Philostratus. But never was there man of his degree So much esteemed, so well beloved as he. So gentle of condition was he known, That through the court his courtesy was blown: All think him worthy of a greater place, And recommend him to the royal grace; That, exercised within a higher sphere. His virtues more conspicuous might appear. Thus by the general voice was Arcite praised, And by great Theseus to high favour raised; Among his menial servants first enrolled, And largely entertained with sums of gold; Besides what secretly from Thebes was sent, Of his own income, and his annual rent. This well employed, he purchased friends and fame, But cautiously concealed from whence it came. Thus for three years he lived with large increase, In arms of honour, and esteem in peace; To Theseus' person he was ever near, And Theseus for his virtues held him dear. BOOK II. While Arcite lives in bliss, the story turns Where hopeless Palamon in prison mourns. For six long years immured, the captive knight Had dragged his chains, and scarcely seen the light: Lost liberty and love at once he bore; His prison pained him much, his passion more; Nor dares he hope his fetters to remove, Nor ever wishes to be free from love. But when the sixth revolving year was run, And May, within the Twins, received the sun, Were it by chance, or forceful destiny, Which forms in causes first whate'er shall be, Assisted by a friend, one moonless night, This Palamon from prison took his flight. A pleasant beverage he prepared before Of wine and honey, mixed with added store Of opium; to his keeper this he brought, Who swallowed, unaware, the sleepy draught, And snored secure till morn, his senses bound In slumber, and in long oblivion drowned. Short was the night, and careful Palamon Sought the next covert ere the rising sun. A thick-spread forest near the city lay, To this, with lengthened strides, he took his way, (For far he could not fly, and feared the day.) Safe from pursuit, he meant to shun the light, Till the brown shadows of the friendly night To Thebes might favour his intended flight. When to his country come, his next design Was all the Theban race in arms to join, And war on Theseus, till he lost his life, Or won the beauteous Emily to wife. Thus while his thoughts the lingering day beguile, To gentle Arcite let us turn our style; Who little dreamt how nigh he was to care, Till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare. The morning lark, the messenger of day, Saluted, in her song, the morning gray; And soon the sun arose with beams so bright, That all the horizon laughed to see the joyous sight. He, with his tepid rays, the rose renews, And licks the dropping leaves, and dries the dews; When Arcite left his bed, resolved to pay Observance to the month of merry May: Forth, on his fiery steed, betimes he rode, That scarcely prints the turf on which he trod; At ease he seemed, and, prancing o'er the plains, Turned only to the grove his horse's reins, (The grove I named before,) and lighting there, A woodbine garland sought to crown his hair; Then turned his face against the rising day, And raised his voice to welcome in the May:— “For thee, sweet month, the groves green liveries wear, If not the first, the fairest, of the year: For thee the Graces lead the dancing hours, And Nature's ready pencil paints the flowers: When thy short reign is past, the feverish sun The sultry tropic fears, and moves more slowly on. So may thy tender blossoms fear no blight, Nor goats, with venomed teeth, thy tendrils bite, As thou shalt guide my wandering feet to find The fragrant greens I seek, my brows to bind.” His vows addressed, within the grove he strayed, Till Fate, or Fortune, near the place conveyed His steps where secret Palamon was laid. Full little thought of him the gentle knight, Who, flying death, had there concealed his flight, In brakes and brambles hid, and shunning mortal sight; And less he knew him for his hated foe, But feared him as a man he did not know. But as it has been said of ancient years, That fields are full of eyes, and woods have ears, For this the wise are ever on their guard, For, unforeseen, they say, is unprepared. Uncautious Arcite thought himself alone, And less than all suspected Palamon, Who, listening, heard him, while he searched the grove, And loudly sung his roundelay of love: But on the sudden stopped, and silent stood, As lovers often muse, and change their mood; Now high as heaven, and then as low as hell, Now up, now down, as buckets in a well: For Venus, like her day, will change her cheer, And seldom shall we see a Friday clear. Thus Arcite having sung, with altered hue Sunk on the ground, and from his bosom drew A desperate sigh, accusing Heaven and Fate, And angry Juno's unrelenting hate:— “Cursed be the day when first I did appear! Let it be blotted from the calendar, Lest it pollute the month, and poison all the year. Still will the jealous queen pursue our race? Cadmus is dead, the Theban city was: Yet ceases not her hate; for all, who come From Cadmus, are involved in Cadmus' doom. I suffer for my blood: unjust decree! That punishes another's crime on me. In mean estate, I serve my mortal foe, The man who caused my country's overthrow. This is not all; for Juno, to my shame, Has forced me to forsake my former name; Arcite I was, Philostratus I am. That side of heaven is all my enemy: Mars ruined Thebes; his mother ruined me. Of all the royal race remains but one, Besides myself, the unhappy Palamon, Whom Theseus holds in bonds, and will not free; Without a crime, except his kin to me. Yet these, and all the rest, I could endure; But love's a malady without a cure: Fierce Love has pierced me with his fiery dart, He fries within, and hisses at my heart. Your eyes, fair Emily, my fate pursue; I suffer for the rest, I die for you. Of such a goddess no time leaves record, Who burned the temple where she was adored: And let it burn, I never will complain, Pleased with my sufferings, if you knew my pain.” At this, a sickly qualm his heart assailed, His ears ring inward, and his senses failed. No word missed Palamon, of all he spoke; But soon to deadly pale he changed his look: He trembled every limb, and felt a smart, As if cold steel had glided through his heart; Nor longer stayed, but, starting from his place, Discovered stood, and showed his hostile face:— “False traitor, Arcite, traitor to thy blood, Bound by thy sacred oath to seek my good, Now art thou found forsworn, for Emily, And darest attempt her love, for whom I die. So hast thou cheated Theseus with a wile, Against thy vow, returning to beguile Under a borrowed name: as false to me, So false thou art to him, who set thee free. But rest assured, that either thou shalt die, Or else renounce thy claim in Emily; For, though unarmed I am, and (freed by chance) Am here without my sword, or pointed lance, Hope not, base man, unquestioned hence to go, For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe.” Arcite, who heard his tale, and knew the man, His sword unsheathed, and fiercely thus began:— “Now, by the gods, who govern heaven above, Wert thou not weak with hunger, mad with love, That word had been thy last; or, in this grove, This hand should force thee to renounce thy love! The surety, which I gave thee, I defy: Fool, not to know, that love endures no tie, And Jove but laughs at lovers' perjury! Know, I will serve the fair in thy despite; But, since thou art my kinsman, and a knight, Here, have my faith, to-morrow, in this grove, Our arms shall plead the titles of our love: And heaven so help my right, as I alone Will come, and keep the cause and quarrel both unknown, With arms of proof, both for myself and thee; Choose thou the best, and leave the worst to me. And, that at better ease thou may'st abide, Bedding and clothes I will this night provide, And needful sustenance, that thou may'st be A conquest better won, and worthy me.” His promise Palamon accepts; but prayed To keep it better than the first he made. Thus fair they parted till the morrow's dawn; For each had laid his plighted faith to pawn. O Love! thou sternly dost thy power maintain, And wilt not bear a rival in thy reign; Tyrants and thou all fellowship disdain. This was in Arcite proved and Palamon, Both in despair, yet each would love alone. Arcite returned, and, as in honour tied, His foe with bedding, and with food, supplied; Then, ere the day, two suits of armour sought, Which, borne before him, on his steed he brought: Both were of shining steel, and wrought so pure, As might the strokes of two such arms endure. Now at the time, and in the appointed place, The challenger and challenged, face to face, Approach; each other, from afar, they knew, And from afar their hatred changed their hue. So stands the Thracian herdsman, with his spear, Full in the gap, and hopes the hunted bear, And hears him rustling in the wood, and sees His course, at distance, by the bending trees; And thinks, Here comes my mortal enemy, And either he must fall in fight, or I: This while he thinks, he lifts aloft his dart; A generous chillness seizes every part; The veins pour back the blood, and fortify the heart. Thus pale they meet; their eyes with fury burn; None greets, for none the greeting will return; But in dumb surliness, each armed, with care, His foe professed, as brother of the war: Then both, no moment lost, at once advance Against each other, armed with sword and lance. They lash, they foin, they pass, they strive to bore Their corselets, and the thinnest parts explore. Thus two long hours, in equal arms, they stood, And, wounded, wound, till both were bathed in blood; And not a foot of ground had either got, As if the world depended on the spot. Fell Arcite like an angry tiger fared, And like a lion Palamon appeared: Or, as two boars, whom love to battle draws, With rising bristles, and with frothy jaws, Their adverse breasts with tusks oblique they wound; With grunts and groans the forest rings around. So fought the knights, and fighting must abide, Till fate an umpire sends their difference to decide. The power that ministers to God's decrees, And executes on earth what heaven foresees, Called Providence, or Chance, or Fatal Sway, Comes with resistless force, and finds, or makes, her way; Nor kings, nor nations, nor united power, One moment can retard the appointed hour; And some one day, some wondrous chance appears, Which happened not in centuries of years: For sure, whate'er we mortals hate, or love, Or hope, or fear, depends on powers above; They move our appetites to good or ill, And, by foresight, necessitate the will. In Theseus this appears, whose youthful joy Was beasts of chase in forest to destroy; This gentle knight, inspired by jolly May, Forsook his easy couch at early day, And to the wood and wilds pursued his way. Beside him rode Hippolyta the queen, And Emily, attired in lively green, With horns, and hounds, and all the tuneful cry, To hunt a royal hart, within the covert nigh: And, as he followed Mars before, so now He serves the goddess of the silver bow. The way that Theseus took, was to the wood, Where the two knights in cruel battle stood: The laund, in which they fought, the appointed place, In which the uncoupled hounds began the chase. Thither, forth-right, he rode to rouse the prey, That, shaded by the fern, in harbour lay; And, thence dislodged, was wont to leave the wood, For open fields, and cross the crystal flood. Approached, and looking underneath the sun, He saw proud Arcite, and fierce Palamon, In mortal battle doubling blow on blow; Like lightning flamed their falchions to and fro, And shot a dreadful gleam; so strong they strook, There seemed less force required to fell an oak. He gazed with wonder on their equal might, Looked eager on, but knew not either knight. Resolved to learn, he spurred his fiery steed With goring rowels to provoke his speed. The minute ended that began the race, So soon he was betwixt them on the place; And, with his sword unsheathed, on pain of life, Commands both combatants to cease their strife: Then, with imperious tone pursues his threat:— “What are you? Why in arms together met? How dares your pride presume against my laws, As in a listed field to fight your cause, Unasked the royal grant; no marshal by, As knightly rites require; nor judge to try?” Then Palamon, with scarce recovered breath, Thus hasty spoke:—“We both deserve the death, And both would die; for, look the world around, A pair so wretched is not to be found. Our life's a load; encumbered with the charge, We long to set the imprisoned soul at large. Now, as thou art a sovereign judge, decree The rightful doom of death to him and me; Let neither find thy grace, for grace is cruelty. Me first, O kill me first, and cure my woe, Then sheathe the sword of justice on my foe: Or kill him first; or when his name is heard, He foremost will receive his due reward. Arcite of Thebes is he, thy mortal foe, On whom thy grace did liberty bestow; But first contracted, that, if ever found, By day or night, upon the Athenian ground, His head should pay the forfeit; see returned The perjured knight, his oath and honour scorned: For this is he, who, with a borrowed name And proffered service, to thy palace came, Now called Philostratus; retained by thee, A traitor trusted, and in high degree, Aspiring to the bed of beauteous Emily. My part remains;—from Thebes my birth I own, And call myself the unhappy Palamon. Think me not like that man, since no disgrace Can force me to renounce the honour of my race. Know me for what I am: I broke thy chain, Nor promised I thy prisoner to remain; The love of liberty with life is given, And life itself the inferior gift of heaven. Thus without crime I fled; but further know, I, with this Arcite, am thy mortal foe: Then, give me death, since I thy life pursue; For safeguard of thyself, death is my due. More wouldst thou know, I love bright Emily, And for her sake, and in her sight, will die: But kill my rival too; for he no less Deserves, and I thy righteous doom will bless, Assured, that what I lose, he never shall possess.” To this replied the stern Athenian prince, And sourly smiled:—“In owning your offence You judge yourself, and I but keep record In place of law, while you pronounce the word. Take your desert, the death you have decreed; I seal your doom, and ratify the deed: By Mars, the patron of my arms, you die.” He said; dumb sorrow seized the standers by. The queen, above the rest, by nature good, (The pattern formed of perfect womanhood,) For tender pity wept: when she began, Through the bright quire the infectious virtue ran. All dropped their tears, even the contended maid, And thus, among themselves, they softly said:— “What eyes can suffer this unworthy sight! Two youths of royal blood, renowned in fight, The mastership of heaven in face and mind, And lovers, far beyond their faithless kind: See their wide-streaming wounds; they neither came From pride of empire, nor desire of fame: Kings fight for kingdoms, madmen for applause; But love for love alone, that crowns the lover's cause.” This thought, which ever bribes the beauteous kind, Such pity wrought in every lady's mind, They left their steeds, and, prostrate on the place, From the fierce king implored the offender's grace. He paused a while, stood silent in his mood; For yet his rage was boiling in his blood: But soon his tender mind the impression felt, As softest metals are not slow to melt, And pity soonest runs in gentle minds: Then reasons with himself; and first he finds His passion cast a mist before his sense, And either made, or magnified, the offence. Offence! of what? to whom? who judged the cause? The prisoner freed himself by Nature's laws: Born free, he sought his right; the man he freed Was perjured, but his love excused the deed: Thus pondering, he looked under with his eyes, And saw the women's tears, and heard their cries; Which moved compassion more: he shook his head, And softly sighing, to himself he said:— “Curse on the unpardoning prince, whom tears can draw To no remorse; who rules by lions' law; And, deaf to prayers, by no submission bowed, Rends all alike, the penitent and proud!” At this, with look serene, he raised his head; Reason resumed her place, and passion fled. Then thus aloud he spoke: “The power of Love, In earth, and seas, and air, and heaven above, Rules, unresisted, with an awful nod; By daily miracles declared a god: He blinds the wise, gives eyesight to the blind, And moulds and stamps anew the lover's mind. Behold that Arcite, and this Palamon, Freed from my fetters, and in safety gone, What hindered either, in their native soil, At ease to reap the harvest of their toil? But Love, their lord, did otherwise ordain, And brought them, in their own despite again, To suffer death deserved; for well they know, 'Tis in my power, and I their deadly foe. The proverb holds,—that to be wise, and love, Is hardly granted to the gods above. See how the madmen bleed! behold the gains With which their master, Love, rewards their pains! For seven long years, on duty every day, Lo their obedience, and their monarch's pay: Yet, as in duty bound, they serve him on; And, ask the fools, they think it wisely done; Nor ease, nor wealth, nor life itself, regard; For 'tis their maxim,—Love is love's reward. This is not all,—the fair, for whom they strove, Nor knew before, nor could suspect their love, Nor thought, when she beheld the fight from far, Her beauty was the occasion of the war. But sure a general doom on man is past, And all are fools and lovers, first or last: This, both by others and myself, I know, For I have served their sovereign long ago; Oft have been caught within the winding train Of female snares, and felt the lover's pain, And learned how far the god can human hearts constrain. To this remembrance, and the prayers of those, Who for the offending warriors interpose, I give their forfeit lives, on this accord, To do me homage, as their sovereign lord; And, as my vassals, to their utmost might, Assist my person, and assert my right.” This freely sworn, the knights their grace obtained; Then thus the king his secret thoughts explained:— “If wealth, or honour, or a royal race, Or each, or all, may win a lady's grace, Then either of you, knights, may well deserve A princess born; and such is she you serve: For Emily is sister to the crown, And but too well to both her beauty known. But should you combat till you both were dead, Two lovers cannot share a single bed. As therefore both are equal in degree, The lot of both be left to Destiny. Now hear the award, and happy may it prove To her, and him who best deserves her love. Depart from hence in peace, and free as air, Search the wide world, and where you please repair; But on the day when this returning sun To the same point through every sign has run, Then each of you his hundred knights shall bring, In royal lists, to fight before the king; And then the knight, whom Fate, or happy Chance, Shall with his friends to victory advance, And grace his arms so far in equal fight, From out the bars to force his opposite, Or kill, or make him recreant on the plain, The prize of valour and of love shall gain; The vanquished party shall their claim release, And the long jars conclude in lasting peace. The charge be mine to adorn the chosen ground, The theatre of war for champions so renowned; And take the patron's place of either knight, With eyes impartial to behold the fight; And heaven of me so judge, as I shall judge aright. If both are satisfied with this accord, Swear, by the laws of knighthood, on my sword.” Who now but Palamon exults with joy? And ravished Arcite seems to touch the sky: The whole assembled troop was pleased as well, Extolled the award, and on their knees they fell To bless the gracious king. The knights, with leave Departing from the place, his last commands receive; On Emily with equal ardour look, And from her eyes their inspiration took. From thence to Thebes' old walls pursue their way, Each to provide his champions for the day. It might be deemed, on our historian's part, Or too much negligence, or want of art, If he forgot the vast magnificence Of royal Theseus, and his large expense. He first inclosed for lists a level ground, The whole circumference a mile around; The form was circular; and all without A trench was sunk, to moat the place about. Within an amphitheatre appeared, Raised in degrees; to sixty paces reared; That when a man was placed in one degree, Height was allowed for him above to see. Eastward was built a gate of marble white; The like adorned the western opposite. A nobler object than this fabric was, Rome never saw, nor of so vast a space: For, rich with spoils of many a conquered land, All arts and artists Theseus could command: Who sold for hire, or wrought for better fame, The master-painters, and the carvers, came. So rose within the compass of the year An age's work, a glorious theatre. Then o'er its eastern gate was raised above A temple, sacred to the queen of love; An altar stood below; on either hand A priest with roses crowned, who held a myrtle wand. The dome of Mars was on the gate opposed, And on the north a turret was inclosed, Within the wall of alabaster white, And crimson coral for the Queen of Night, Who takes in sylvan sports her chaste delight. Within these oratories might you see Rich carvings, portraitures, and imagery; Where every figure to the life expressed The godhead's power to whom it was addressed. In Venus' temple on the sides were seen The broken slumbers of enamoured men; Prayers that even spoke, and pity seemed to call, And issuing sighs that smoked along the wall; Complaints, and hot desires, the lover's hell, And scalding tears that wore a channel where they fell; And all around were nuptial bonds, the ties Of love's assurance, and a train of lies, That, made in lust, conclude in perjuries; Beauty, and Youth, and Wealth, and Luxury, And sprightly Hope, and short-enduring Joy; And Sorceries to raise the infernal powers, And Sigils framed in planetary hours; Expense, and after-thought, and idle care, And doubts of motley hue, and dark despair; Suspicions, and fantastical surmise, And Jealousy suffused, with jaundice in her eyes, Discolouring all she viewed, in tawny dressed, Down-looked, and with a cuckoo on her fist. Opposed to her, on t'other side advance The costly feast, the carol, and the dance, Minstrels, and music, poetry, and play, And balls by night, and tournaments by day. All these were painted on the wall, and more; With acts and monuments of times before, And others added by prophetic doom, And lovers yet unborn, and loves to come; For there, the Idalian mount, and Citheron, The court of Venus, was in colours drawn; Before the palace-gate, in careless dress, And loose array, sat portress Idleness; There, by the fount, Narcissus pined alone; There Samson was, with wiser Solomon, And all the mighty names by love undone. Medea's charms were there, Circean feasts, With bowls that turned enamoured youths to beasts. Here might be seen, that beauty, wealth, and wit, And prowess, to the power of love submit; The spreading snare for all mankind is laid, And lovers all betray, and are betrayed. The goddess' self some noble hand had wrought; Smiling she seemed, and full of pleasing thought; From ocean, as she first began to rise, And smoothed the ruffled seas, and cleared the skies, She trod the brine, all bare below the breast, And the green waves but ill concealed the rest: A lute she held; and on her head was seen A wreath of roses red, and myrtles green; Her turtles fanned the buxom air above; And, by his mother, stood an infant Love, With wings unfledged; his eyes were banded o'er, His hands a bow, his back a quiver bore, Supplied with arrows bright and keen, a deadly store. But in the dome of mighty Mars the red, With different figures all the sides were spread; This temple, less in form, with equal grace, Was imitative of the first in Thrace; For that cold region was the loved abode, And sovereign mansion of the warrior god. The landscape was a forest wide and bare, Where neither beast nor humankind repair; The fowl, that scent afar, the borders fly, And shun the bitter blast, and wheel about the sky. A cake of scurf lies baking on the ground, And prickly stubs, instead of trees, are found; Or woods with knots and knares deformed and old; Headless the most, and hideous to behold; A rattling tempest through the branches went, That stripped them bare, and one sole way they bent. Heaven froze above, severe; the clouds congeal, And through the crystal vault appeared the standing hail. Such was the face without; a mountain stood Threat'ning from high, and overlooked the wood; Beneath the low'ring brow, and on a bent, The temple stood of Mars armipotent; The frame of burnished steel, that cast a glare From far, and seemed to thaw the freezing air. A straight long entry to the temple led, Blind with high walls, and horror over head; Thence issued such a blast, and hollow roar, As threatened from the hinge to heave the door; In through that door a northern light there shone; 'Twas all it had, for windows there were none. The gate was adamant; eternal frame! Which, hewed by Mars himself, from Indian quarries came, The labour of a god; and all along Tough iron plates were clenched to make it strong. A tun about was every pillar there; A polished mirror shone not half so clear. There saw I how the secret felon wrought, And treason labouring in the traitor's thought, And midwife Time the ripened plot to murder brought. There the red Anger dared the pallid Fear; Next stood Hypocrisy, with holy leer; Soft smiling, and demurely looking down, But hid the dagger underneath the gown; The assassinating wife, the household fiend; And, far the blackest there, the traitor-friend. On t'other side there stood Destruction bare, Unpunished Rapine, and a waste of war; Contest, with sharpened knives, in cloisters drawn, And all with blood bespread the holy lawn. Loud menaces were heard, and foul disgrace, And bawling infamy, in language base; Till sense was lost in sound, and silence fled the place. The slayer of himself yet saw I there, The gore congealed was clottered in his hair; With eyes half-closed, and gaping mouth he lay, And grim, as when he breathed his sullen soul away. In midst of all the dome, Misfortune sat, And gloomy Discontent, and fell Debate, And Madness laughing in his ireful mood; And armed complaint on theft; and cries of blood. There was the murdered corpse in covert laid, And violent death in thousand shapes displayed; The city to the soldier's rage resigned; Successless wars, and poverty behind: Ships burnt in fight, or forced on rocky shores, And the rash hunter strangled by the boars; The new-born babe by nurses overlaid; And the cook caught within the raging fire he made. All ills of Mars his nature, flame, and steel; The gasping charioteer, beneath the wheel Of his own car; the ruined house, that falls And intercepts her lord betwixt the walls: The whole division that to Mars pertains, All trades of death that deal in steel for gains, Were there; the butcher, armourer, and smith, Who forges sharpened falchions, or the scythe. The scarlet conquest on a tower was placed, With shouts, and soldiers' acclamations graced: A pointed sword hung threat'ning o'er his head, Sustained but by a slender twine of thread. There saw I Mars his ides, the Capitol, The seer in vain foretelling Cæsar's fall; The last triumvirs, and the wars they move, And Antony, who lost the world for love. These, and a thousand more, the fane adorn; Their fates were painted ere the men were born, All copied from the heavens, and ruling force Of the red star, in his revolving course. The form of Mars high on a chariot stood, All sheathed in arms, and gruffly looked the god; Two geomantic figures were displayed Above his head, a warrior and a maid, Rubeus and Puella. One when direct, and one when retrograde. Tired with deformities of death, I haste To the third temple, of Diana chaste. A sylvan scene with various greens was drawn, Shades on the sides, and on the midst a lawn; The silver Cynthia, with her nymphs around, Pursued the flying deer, the woods with horns resound: Calisto there stood manifest of shame, And, turned a bear, the northern star became: Her son was next, and, by peculiar grace, In the cold circle held the second place: The stag Acteon in the stream had spied The naked huntress, and for seeing died; His hounds, unknowing of his change, pursue The chase, and their mistaken master slew. Peneian Daphne too was there, to see Apollo's love before, and now his tree. The adjoining fane the assembled Greeks expressed, And hunting of the Caledonian beast. Oenides' valour, and his envied prize; The fatal power of Atalanta's eyes; Diana's vengeance on the victor shown, The murderess mother, and consuming son; The Volscian queen extended on the plain; The treason punished, and the traitor slain. The rest were various huntings, well designed, And savage beasts destroyed, of every kind. The graceful goddess was arrayed in green; About her feet were little beagles seen, That watched with upward eyes the motions of their queen. Her legs were buskined, and the left before, In act to shoot, a silver bow she bore, And at her back a painted quiver wore. She trod a wexing moon, that soon would wane, And, drinking borrowed light, be filled again; With downcast eyes, as seeming to survey The dark dominions, her alternate sway. Before her stood a woman in her throes, And called Lucina's aid, her burden to disclose. All these the painter drew with such command, That Nature snatched the pencil from his hand, Ashamed and angry that his art could feign, And mend the tortures of a mother's pain. Theseus beheld the fanes of every god, And thought his mighty cost was well bestowed. So princes now their poets should regard; But few can write, and fewer can reward. The theatre thus raised, the lists inclosed, And all with vast magnificence disposed, We leave the monarch pleased, and haste to bring The knights to combat, and their arms to sing. BOOK III. The day approached when Fortune should decide The important enterprise, and give the bride; For now the rivals round the world had sought, And each his number, well appointed, brought. The nations, far and near, contend in choice, And send the flower of war by public voice; That after, or before, were never known Such chiefs, as each an army seemed alone: Beside the champions, all of high degree, Who knighthood loved, and deeds of chivalry, Thronged to the lists, and envied to behold The names of others, not their own, enrolled. Nor seems it strange; for every noble knight, Who loves the fair, and is endued with might, In such a quarrel would be proud to fight. There breathes not scarce a man on British ground, (An isle for love, and arms, of old renowned,) But would have sold his life to purchase fame, To Palamon or Arcite sent his name; And had the land selected of the best, Half had come hence, and let the world provide the rest. A hundred knights with Palamon there came, Approved in fight, and men of mighty name; Their arms were several, as their nations were, But furnished all alike with sword and spear. Some wore coat armour, imitating scale, And next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail; Some wore a breastplate and a light juppon, Their horses clothed with rich caparison; Some for defence would leathern bucklers use, Of folded hides, and others shields of Pruce. One hung a pole-axe at his saddle-bow, And one a heavy mace to stun the foe; One for his legs and knees provided well, With jambeux armed, and double plates of steel; This on his helmet wore a lady's glove, And that a sleeve embroidered by his love. With Palamon, above the rest in place, Lycurgus came, the surly king of Thrace; Black was his beard, and manly was his face: The balls of his broad eyes rolled in his head, And glared betwixt a yellow and a red; He looked a lion with a gloomy stare, And o'er his eyebrows hung his matted hair; Big-boned, and large of limbs, with sinews strong, Broad-shouldered, and his arms were round and long: Four milk-white bulls (the Thracian use of old) Were yoked to draw his car of burnished gold. Upright he stood, and bore aloft his shield, Conspicuous from afar, and overlooked the field. His surcoat was a bear-skin on his back; His hair hung long behind, and glossy raven-black. His ample forehead bore a coronet With sparkling diamonds, and with rubies set; Ten brace, and more, of greyhounds, snowy fair, And tall as stags, ran loose, and coursed around his chair, A match for pards in flight, in grappling for the bear. With golden muzzles all their mouths were bound, And collars of the same their necks surround. Thus through the field Lycurgus took his way; His hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array. To match this monarch, with strong Arcite came Emetrius, king of Inde, a mighty name! On a bay courser, goodly to behold, The trappings of his horse embossed with barbarous gold. Not Mars bestrode a steed with greater grace; His surcoat o'er his arms was cloth of Thrace, Adorned with pearls, all orient, round, and great; His saddle was of gold, with emeralds set; His shoulders large a mantle did attire, With rubies thick, and sparkling as the fire; His amber-coloured locks in ringlets run, With graceful negligence, and shone against the sun. His nose was aquiline, his eyes were blue, Ruddy his lips, and fresh and fair his hue; Some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen, Whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skin: His awful presence did the crowd surprise, Nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes: Eyes that confessed him born for kingly sway, So fierce, they flashed intolerable day. His age in nature's youthful prime appeared, And just began to bloom his yellow beard. Whene'er he spoke, his voice was heard around, Loud as a trumpet, with a silver sound; A laurel wreathed his temples, fresh and green, And myrtle sprigs, the marks of love, were mixed between. Upon his fist he bore, for his delight, An eagle well reclaimed, and lily-white. His hundred knights attend him to the war, All armed for battle; save their heads were bare. Words and devices blazed on every shield, And pleasing was the terror of the field. For kings, and dukes, and barons, you might see, Like sparkling stars, though different in degree, All for the increase of arms, and love of chivalry. Before the king tame leopards led the way, And troops of lions innocently play. So Bacchus through the conquered Indies rode, And beasts in gambols frisked before their honest god. In this array, the war of either side Through Athens passed with military pride. At prime they entered on the Sunday morn; Rich tapestry spread the streets, and flowers the pots adorn. The town was all a jubilee of feasts; So Theseus willed, in honour of his guests: Himself with open arms the kings embraced, Then all the rest in their degrees were graced. No harbinger was needful for the night, For every house was proud to lodge a knight. I pass the royal treat, nor must relate The gifts bestowed, nor how the champions sate; Who first, who last, or how the knights addressed Their vows, or who was fairest at the feast; Whose voice, whose graceful dance did most surprise; Soft amorous sighs, and silent love of eyes. The rivals call my muse another way, To sing their vigils for the ensuing day. 'Twas ebbing darkness, past the noon of night, And Phosphor, on the confines of the light, Promised the sun; ere day began to spring, The tuneful lark already stretched her wing, And flickering on her nest, made short essays to sing, When wakeful Palamon, preventing day, Took to the royal lists his early way, To Venus at her fane, in her own house, to pray. There, falling on his knees before her shrine, He thus implored with prayers her power divine:— “Creator Venus, genial power of love, The bliss of men below, and gods above! Beneath the sliding sun thou runn'st thy race, Dost fairest shine, and best become thy place. For thee the winds their eastern blasts forbear, Thy month reveals the spring, and opens all the year. Thee, Goddess, thee the storms of winter fly, Earth smiles with flowers renewing, laughs the sky, And birds to lays of love their tuneful notes apply. For thee the lion loathes the taste of blood, And roaring hunts his female through the wood; For thee the bulls rebellow through the groves, And tempt the stream, and snuff their absent loves. 'Tis thine, whate'er is pleasant, good, or fair; All nature is thy province, life thy care; Thou mad'st the world, and dost the world repair. Thou gladder of the mount of Cytheron, Increase of Jove, companion of the sun! If e'er Adonis touched thy tender heart, Have pity, Goddess, for thou know'st the smart! Alas! I have not words to tell my grief; To vent my sorrow would be some relief: Light sufferings give us leisure to complain; We groan, but cannot speak, in greater pain. O Goddess, tell thyself what I would say, Thou know'st it, and I feel too much to pray. So grant my suit, as I enforce my might In love to be thy champion, and thy knight; A servant to thy sex, a slave to thee, A foe professed to barren chastity. Nor ask I fame or honour of the field, Nor choose I more to vanquish than to yield: In my divine Emilia make me blest, Let fate, or partial chance, dispose the rest: Find thou the manner, and the means prepare; Possession, more than conquest, is my care. Mars is the warrior's God; in him it lies On whom he favours to confer the prize; With smiling aspect you serenely move In your fifth orb, and rule the realm of love. The fates but only spin the coarser clew, The finest of the wool is left for you. Spare me but one small portion of the twine, And let the Sisters cut below your line: The rest among the rubbish may they sweep, Or add it to the yarn of some old miser's heap. But, if you this ambitious prayer deny, (A wish, I grant, beyond mortality,) Then let me sink beneath proud Arcite's arms, And I, once dead, let him possess her charms!” Thus ended he; then, with observance due, The sacred incense on her altar threw: The curling smoke mounts heavy from the fires; At length it catches flame, and in a blaze expires; At once the gracious Goddess gave the sign, Her statue shook, and trembled all the shrine: Pleased Palamon the tardy omen took; For, since the flames pursued the trailing smoke, He knew his boon was granted; but the day To distance driven, and joy adjourned with long delay. Now morn with rosy light had streaked the sky, Up rose the sun, and up rose Emily; Addressed her early steps to Cynthia's fane, In state attended by her maiden train, Who bore the vests that holy rites require, Incense, and odorous gums, and covered fire. The plenteous horns with pleasant mead they crown, Nor wanted aught besides in honour of the moon. Now, while the temple smoked with hallowed steam, They wash the virgin in a living stream; The secret ceremonies I conceal, Uncouth, perhaps unlawful, to reveal: But such they were as pagan use required, Performed by women when the men retired, Whose eyes profane their chaste mysterious rites Might turn to scandal, or obscene delights. Well-meaners think no harm; but for the rest, Things sacred they pervert, and silence is the best. Her shining hair, uncombed, was loosely spread, A crown of mastless oak adorned her head: When to the shrine approached, the spotless maid Had kindling fires on either altar laid: (The rites were such as were observed of old, By Statius in his Theban story told.) Then kneeling with her hands across her breast, Thus lowly she preferred her chaste request:— “O Goddess, haunter of the woodland green, To whom both heaven and earth and seas are seen; Queen of the nether skies, where half the year Thy silver beams descend, and light the gloomy sphere; Goddess of maids, and conscious of our hearts, So keep me from the vengeance of thy darts, (Which Niobe's devoted issue felt, When hissing through the skies the feathered deaths were dealt,) As I desire to live a virgin life, Nor know the name of mother or of wife. Thy votaress from my tender years I am, And love, like thee, the woods and sylvan game. Like death, thou know'st, I loathe the nuptial state, And man, the tyrant of our sex, I hate, A lowly servant, but a lofty mate; Where love is duty, on the female side; On theirs mere sensual gust, and sought with surly pride. Now by thy triple shape, as thou art seen In heaven, earth, hell, and everywhere a queen, Grant this my first desire; let discord cease, And make betwixt the rivals lasting peace: Quench their hot fire, or far from me remove The flame, and turn it on some other love; Or if my frowning stars have so decreed, That one must be rejected, one succeed, Make him my lord, within whose faithful breast Is fixed my image, and who loves me best. But, oh! even that avert! I choose it not, But take it as the least unhappy lot. A maid I am, and of thy virgin train; Oh, let me still that spotless name retain! Frequent the forests, thy chaste will obey, And only make the beasts of chase my prey!” The flames ascend on either altar clear, While thus the blameless maid addressed her prayer. When lo! the burning fire, that shone so bright, Flew off, all sudden, with extinguished light, And left one altar dark a little space, Which turned self-kindled, and renewed the blaze; That other victor-flame a moment stood, Then fell, and lifeless left the extinguished wood; For ever lost, the irrevocable light Forsook the black'ning coals, and sunk to night: At either end it whistled as it flew, And as the brands were green, so dropped the dew; Infected as it fell with sweat of sanguine hue. The maid from that ill omen turned her eyes, And with loud shrieks and clamours rent the skies; Nor knew what signified the boding sign, But found the powers displeased, and feared the wrath divine. Then shook the sacred shrine and sudden light Sprung through the vaulted roof, and made the temple bright. The Power, behold! the Power in glory shone, By her bent bow and her keen arrows known; The rest, a huntress issuing from the wood, Reclining on her cornel spear she stood. Then gracious thus began:—“Dismiss thy fear, And heaven's unchanged decrees attentive hear: More powerful gods have torn thee from my side, Unwilling to resign, and doomed a bride: The two contending knights are weighed above; One Mars protects, and one the Queen of Love: But which the man, is in the Thunderer's breast; This he pronounced, ‘'Tis he who loves thee best.’ The fire, that, once extinct, revived again, Foreshows the love allotted to remain. Farewell!”—she said, and vanished from the place; The sheaf of arrows shook, and rattled in the case. Aghast at this, the royal virgin stood, Disclaimed, and now no more a sister of the wood: But to the parting Goddess thus she prayed,— “Propitious still, be present to my aid, Nor quite abandon your once-favoured maid.” Then sighing she returned; but smiled betwixt, With hopes, and fears, and joys with sorrows mixt. The next returning planetary hour Of Mars, who shared the heptarchy of power, His steps bold Arcite to the temple bent, To adore with pagan rites the Power armipotent: Then prostrate low before his altar lay, And raised his manly voice, and thus began to pray:— “Strong God of Arms, whose iron sceptre sways The freezing North, and Hyperborean seas, And Scythian colds, and Thracia's wintry coast, Where stand thy steeds, and thou art honoured most: There most; but everywhere thy power is known, The fortune of the fight is all thy own: Terror is thine, and wild amazement, flung From out thy chariot, withers even the strong; And disarray and shameful rout ensue, And force is added to the fainting crew— Acknowledged as thou art, accept my prayer! If aught I have achieved deserve thy care; If to my utmost power with sword and shield I dared the death, unknowing how to yield, And falling in my rank, still kept the field, Then let my arms prevail, by thee sustained, That Emily by conquest may be gained. Have pity on my pains; nor those unknown To Mars, which, when a lover, were his own. Venus, the public care of all above, Thy stubborn heart has softened into love: Now, by her blandishments and powerful charms, When yielded she lay curling in thy arms, Even by thy shame, if shame it may be called, When Vulcan had thee in his net enthralled; (O envied ignominy, sweet disgrace, When every God that saw thee wished thy place!) By those dear pleasures, aid my arms in fight, And make me conquer in my patron's right: For I am young, a novice in the trade, The fool of love, unpractised to persuade: And want the soothing arts that catch the fair, But, caught myself, lie struggling in the snare; And she I love, or laughs at all my pain, Or knows her worth too well, and pays me with disdain. For sure I am, unless I win in arms, To stand excluded from Emilia's charms: Nor can my strength avail, unless, by thee Endued with force, I gain the victory; Then for the fire which warmed thy generous heart, Pity thy subject's pains, and equal smart. So be the morrow's sweat and labour mine, The palm and honour of the conquest thine: Then shall the war, and stern debate, and strife Immortal, be the business of my life; And in thy fane, the dusty spoils among, High on the burnished roof, my banner shall be hung, Ranked with my champions' bucklers; and below, With arms reversed, the achievements of my foe; And while these limbs the vital spirit feeds, While day to night, and night to day succeeds, Thy smoking altar shall be fat with food Of incense, and the grateful steam of blood; Burnt-offerings morn and evening shall be thine, And fires eternal in thy temple shine. This bush of yellow beard, this length of hair, Which from my birth inviolate I bear, Guiltless of steel, and from the razor free, Shall fall a plenteous crop, reserved for thee. So may my arms with victory be blest, I ask no more, let fate dispose the rest.” The champion ceased: there followed in the close A hollow groan; a murmuring wind arose; The rings of iron, that on the doors were hung, Sent out a jarring sound, and harshly rung: The bolted gates flew open at the blast, The storm rushed in, and Arcite stood aghast; The flames were blown aside, yet shone they bright, Fanned by the wind, and gave a ruffled light. Then from the ground a scent began to rise, Sweet smelling as accepted sacrifice: This omen pleased, and, as the flames aspire, With odorous incense Arcite heaps the fire: Nor wanted hymns to Mars, or heathen charms: At length the nodding statue clashed his arms, And with a sullen sound and feeble cry, Half-sunk, and half-pronounced the word of Victory. For this, with soul devout, he thanked the God, And, of success secure, returned to his abode. These vows, thus granted, raised a strife above Betwixt the God of War and Queen of Love. She, granting first, had right of time to plead; But he had granted too, nor would recede. Jove was for Venus, but he feared his wife, And seemed unwilling to decide the strife; Till Saturn from his leaden throne arose, And found a way the difference to compose: Though sparing of his grace, to mischief bent, He seldom does a good with good intent. Wayward, but wise; by long experience taught, To please both parties, for ill ends, he sought; For this advantage age from youth has won, As not to be outridden, though outrun. By fortune he was now to Venus trined, And with stern Mars in Capricorn was joined: Of him disposing in his own abode, He soothed the Goddess, while he gulled the God:— “Cease, daughter, to complain, and stint the strife; Thy Palamon shall have his promised wife: And Mars, the lord of conquest, in the fight With palm and laurel shall adorn his knight. Wide is my course, nor turn I to my place, Till length of time, and move with tardy pace. Man feels me, when I press the ethereal plains; My hand is heavy, and the wound remains. Mine is the shipwreck, in a watery sign; And in an earthy, the dark dungeon mine. Cold shivering agues, melancholy care, And bitter blasting winds, and poisoned air, Are mine, and wilful death, resulting from despair. The throttling quinsy 'tis my star appoints, And rheumatisms I send to rack the joints: When churls rebel against their native prince, I arm their hands, and furnish the pretence; And housing in the lion's hateful sign, Bought senates, and deserting troops are mine. Mine is the privy poisoning; I command Unkindly seasons, and ungrateful land. By me king's palaces are pushed to ground, And miners crushed beneath their mines are found. 'Twas I slew Samson, when the pillared hall Fell down, and crushed the many with the fall. My looking is the sire of pestilence, That sweeps at once the people and the prince. Now weep no more, but trust thy grandsire's art; Mars shall be pleased, and thou perform thy part. 'Tis ill, though different your complexions are, The family of heaven for men should war.” The expedient pleased, where neither lost his right; Mars had the day, and Venus had the night. The management they left to Cronos' care; Now turn we to the effect, and sing the war. In Athens, all was pleasure, mirth, and play, All proper to the spring, and sprightly May: Which every soul inspired with such delight, 'Twas jousting all the day, and love at night. Heaven smiled, and gladded was the heart of man; And Venus had the world as when it first began. At length in sleep their bodies they compose, And dreamt the future fight, and early rose. Now scarce the dawning day began to spring, As at a signal given, the streets with clamours ring: At once the crowd arose; confused and high, Even from the heaven, was heard a shouting cry, For Mars was early up, and roused the sky. The gods came downward to behold the wars, Sharpening their sights, and leaning from their stars. The neighing of the generous horse was heard, For battle by the busy groom prepared: Rustling of harness, rattling of the shield, Clattering of armour, furbished for the field. Crowds to the castle mounted up the street, Battering the pavement with their coursers' feet: The greedy sight might there devour the gold Of glittering arms, too dazzling to behold; And polished steel, that cast the view aside, And crested morions, with their plumy pride. Knights, with a long retinue of their squires, In gaudy liveries march, and quaint attires. One laced the helm, another held the lance; A third the shining buckler did advance. The courser pawed the ground with restless feet, And snorting foamed, and champed the golden bit. The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride, Files in their hands, and hammers at their side, And nails for loosened spears, and thongs for shields provide. The yeomen guard the streets, in seemly bands; And clowns come crowding on, with cudgels in their hands. The trumpets, next the gate, in order placed, Attend the sign to sound the martial blast: The palace-yard is filled with floating tides, And the last comers bear the former to the sides. The throng is in the midst; the common crew Shut out, the hall admits the better few. In knots they stand, or in a rank they walk, Serious in aspect, earnest in their talk: Factious, and favouring this or t'other side, As their strong fancies and weak reason guide. Their wagers back their wishes; numbers hold With the fair freckled king, and beard of gold: So vigorous are his eyes, such rays they cast, So prominent his eagle's beak is placed. But most their looks on the black monarch bend, His rising muscles, and his brawn commend; His double-biting axe, and beamy spear, Each asking a gigantic force to rear. All spoke as partial favour moved the mind; And, safe themselves, at others' cost divined. Waked by the cries, the Athenian chief arose, The knightly forms of combat to dispose; And passing through the obsequious guards, he sate Conspicuous on a throne, sublime in state; There, for the two contending knights he sent; Armed cap-a-pee, with reverence low they bent; He smiled on both, and with superior look Alike their offered adoration took. The people press on every side to see Their awful prince, and hear his high decree. Then signing to the heralds with his hand, They gave his orders from their lofty stand. Silence is thrice enjoined; then thus aloud The king at arms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd:— “Our sovereign lord has pondered in his mind The means to spare the blood of gentle kind; And of his grace, and inborn clemency, He modifies his first severe decree, The keener edge of battle to rebate, The troops for honour fighting, not for hate. He wills, not death should terminate their strife, And wounds, if wounds ensue, be short of life; But issues, ere the fight, his dread command, That slings afar, and poniards hand to hand, Be banished from the field; that none shall dare With shortened sword to stab in closer war; But in fair combat fight with manly strength, Nor push with biting point, but strike at length. The tourney is allowed but one career, Of the tough ash, with the sharp-grinded spear; But knights unhorsed may rise from off the plain, And fight on foot their honour to regain; Nor, if at mischief taken, on the ground Be slain, but prisoners to the pillar bound, At either barrier placed; nor (captives made), Be freed, or armed anew the fight invade. The chief of either side, bereft of life, Or yielded to his foe, concludes the strife. Thus dooms the lord; now, valiant knights and young, Fight each his fill with swords and maces long.” The herald ends: the vaulted firmament With loud acclaims and vast applause is rent: Heaven guard a prince so gracious and so good, So just, and yet so provident of blood! This was the general cry. The trumpets sound, And warlike symphony is heard around. The marching troops through Athens take their way, The great earl-marshal orders their array. The fair from high the passing pomp behold; A rain of flowers is from the windows rolled. The casements are with golden tissue spread, And horses' hoofs, for earth, on silken tapestry tread. The king goes midmost, and the rivals ride In equal rank, and close his either side. Next after these, there rode the royal wife, With Emily, the cause, and the reward of strife. The following cavalcade, by three and three, Proceed by titles marshalled in degree. Thus through the southern gate they take their way, And at the lists arrived ere prime of day. There, parting from the king, the chiefs divide, And wheeling east and west, before their many ride. The Athenian monarch mounts his throne on high, And after him the queen and Emily: Next these, the kindred of the crown are graced With nearer seats, and lords by ladies placed. Scarce were they seated, when with clamours loud In rushed at once a rude promiscuous crowd: The guards, and then each other overbear, And in a moment throng the spacious theatre. Now changed the jarring noise to whispers low, As winds forsaking seas more softly blow; When at the western gate, on which the car Is placed aloft, that bears the God of War, Proud Arcite, entering armed before his train, Stops at the barrier, and divides the plain. Red was his banner, and displayed abroad The bloody colours of his patron God. At that self moment enters Palamon The gate of Venus, and the rising Sun; Waved by the wanton winds, his banner flies, All maiden white, and shares the people's eyes. From east to west, look all the world around, Two troops so matched were never to be found; Such bodies built for strength, of equal age, In stature sized; so proud an equipage: The nicest eye could no distinction make, Where lay the advantage, or what side to take. Thus ranged, the herald for the last proclaims A silence, while they answered to their names: For so the king decreed, to shun with care The fraud of musters false, the common bane of war. The tale was just, and then the gates were closed; And chief to chief, and troop to troop opposed. The heralds last retired, and loudly cried,— “The fortune of the field be fairly tried!” At this, the challenger, with fierce defy, His trumpets sounds; the challenged makes reply. With clangour rings the field, resounds the vaulted sky. Their visors closed, their lances in the rest, Or at the helmet pointed, or the crest, They vanish from the barrier, speed the race, And spurring see decrease the middle space. A cloud of smoke envelops either host, And all at once the combatants are lost: Darkling they join adverse, and shock unseen, Coursers with coursers jostling, men with men: As labouring in eclipse, a while they stay, Till the next blast of wind restores the day. They look anew; the beauteous form of fight Is changed, and war appears a grisly sight. Two troops in fair array one moment shewed, The next, a field with fallen bodies strewed: Not half the number in their seats are found; But men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground. The points of spears are stuck within the shield, The steeds without their riders scour the field. The knights, unhorsed, on foot renew the fight; The glittering falchions cast a gleaming light; Hauberks and helms are hewed with many a wound; Out spins the streaming blood, and dyes the ground. The mighty maces with such haste descend, They break the bones, and make the solid armour bend. This thrusts amid the throng with furious force; Down goes, at once, the horseman and the horse: That courser stumbles on the fallen steed, And flound'ring throws the rider o'er his head. One rolls along, a football to his foes; One with a broken truncheon deals his blows. This halting, this disabled with his wound, In triumph led, is to the pillar bound, Where by the king's award he must abide; There goes a captive led on t'other side. By fits they cease; and leaning on the lance, Take breath a while, and to new fight advance. Full oft the rivals met, and neither spared His utmost force, and each forgot to ward. The head of this was to the saddle bent, That other backward to the crupper sent: Both were by turns unhorsed; the jealous blows Fall thick and heavy, when on foot they close. So deep their falchions bite, that every stroke Pierced to the quick, and equal wounds they gave and took. Borne far asunder by the tides of men, Like adamant and steel they meet again. So when a tiger sucks the bullock's blood, A famished lion issuing from the wood Roars lordly fierce, and challenges the food. Each claims possession, neither will obey, But both their paws are fastened on the prey; They bite, they tear; and while in vain they strive, The swains come armed between, and both to distance drive. At length, as fate foredoomed, and all things tend By course of time to their appointed end; So when the sun to west was far declined, And both afresh in mortal battle joined, The strong Emetrius came in Arcite's aid, And Palamon with odds was overlaid: For turning short, he struck with all his might Full on the helmet of the unwary knight. Deep was the wound; he staggered with the blow, And turned him to his unexpected foe; Whom with such force he struck, he felled him down, And cleft the circle of his golden crown. But Arcite's men, who now prevailed in fight, Twice ten at once surround the single knight: O'erpowered, at length, they force him to the ground, Unyielded as he was, and to the pillar bound; And king Lycurgus, while he fought in vain His friend to free, was tumbled on the plain. Who now laments but Palamon, compelled No more to try the fortune of the field! And, worse than death, to view with hateful eyes His rival's conquest, and renounce the prize! The royal judge on his tribunal placed, Who had beheld the fight from first to last, Bade cease the war; pronouncing from on high Arcite of Thebes had won the beauteous Emily. The sound of trumpets to the voice replied, And round the royal lists the heralds cried,— “Arcite of Thebes has won the beauteous bride!” The people rend the skies with vast applause; All own the chief, when fortune owns the cause. Arcite is owned even by the Gods above, And conquering Mars insults the Queen of Love. So laughed he, when the rightful Titan failed, And Jove's usurping arms in heaven prevailed. Laughed all the powers who favour tyranny, And all the standing army of the sky. But Venus with dejected eyes appears, And, weeping, on the lists distilled her tears; Her will refused, which grieves a woman most, And, in her champion foiled, the cause of Love is lost. Till Saturn said:—“Fair daughter, now be still: The blustering fool has satisfied his will; His boon is given; his knight has gained the day, But lost the prize; the arrears are yet to pay. Thy hour is come, and mine the care shall be To please thy knight, and set thy promise free.” Now while the heralds run the lists around, And “Arcite, Arcite,” heaven and earth resound; A miracle (nor less could it be called) Their joy with unexpected sorrow palled. The victor knight had laid his helm aside, (Part for his ease, the greater part for pride,) Bare-headed, popularly low he bowed, And paid the salutations of the crowd; Then, spurring, at full speed, ran endlong on Where Theseus sat on his imperial throne; Furious he drove, and upward cast his eye, Where next the queen was placed his Emily; Then passing, to the saddle-bow he bent; A sweet regard the gracious virgin lent; (For women, to the brave an easy prey, Still follow Fortune where she leads the way;) Just then from earth sprung out a flashing fire, By Pluto sent, at Saturn's bad desire: The startling steed was seized with sudden fright, And, bounding, o'er the pommel cast the knight: Forward he flew, and, pitching on his head, He quivered with his feet, and lay for dead. Black was his countenance in a little space, For all the blood was gathered in his face. Help was at hand: they reared him from the ground, And from his cumbrous arms his limbs unbound; Then lanced a vein, and watched returning breath; It came, but clogged with symptoms of his death. The saddle-bow the noble parts had prest, All bruised and mortified his manly breast. Him still entranced, and in a litter laid, They bore from field, and to his bed conveyed. At length he waked, and with a feeble cry, The word he first pronounced was Emily. Meantime the king, though inwardly he mourned, In pomp triumphant to the town returned, Attended by the chiefs, who fought the field, (Now friendly mixed, and in one troop compelled,) Composed his looks to counterfeited cheer, And bade them not for Arcite's life to fear, But that which gladded all the warrior train, Though most were sorely wounded, none were slain. The surgeons soon despoiled them of their arms, And some with salves they cure, and some with charms; Foment the bruises, and the pains assuage, And heal their inward hurts with sovereign draughts of sage. The king, in person, visits all around, Comforts the sick, congratulates the sound; Honours the princely chiefs, rewards the rest, And holds, for thrice three days, a royal feast. None were disgraced, for falling is no shame, And cowardice alone is loss of fame. The venturous knight is from the saddle thrown; But 'tis the fault of fortune, not his own: If crowns and palms the conquering side adorn, The victor under better stars was born: The brave man seeks not popular applause, Nor, overpowered with arms, deserts his cause; Unshamed, though foiled, he does the best he can; Force is of brutes, but honour is of man. Thus Theseus smiled on all with equal grace, And each was set according to his place; With ease were reconciled the differing parts, For envy never dwells in noble hearts. At length they took their leave, the time expired, Well pleased, and to their several homes retired. Meanwhile the health of Arcite still impairs; From bad proceeds to worse, and mocks the leeches' cares: Swollen is his breast, his inward pains increase, All means are used, and all without success. The clotted blood lies heavy on his heart, Corrupts, and there remains in spite of art; Nor breathing veins, nor cupping, will prevail; All outward remedies and inward fail: The mould of nature's fabric is destroyed, Her vessels discomposed, her virtue void: The bellows of his lungs begins to swell; All out of frame is every secret cell, Nor can the good receive, nor bad expel. Those breathing organs, thus within oppressed, With venom soon distend the sinews of his breast. Nought profits him to save abandoned life, Nor vomits upward aid, nor downward laxative. The midmost region battered and destroyed, When nature cannot work, the effect of art is void; For physic can but mend our crazy state, Patch an old building, not a new create. Arcite is doomed to die in all his pride, Must leave his youth, and yield his beauteous bride, Gained hardly, against right, and unenjoyed. When 'twas declared all hope of life was past, Conscience (that of all physic works the last) Caused him to send for Emily in haste. With her, at his desire, came Palamon; Then, on his pillow raised, he thus began:— “No language can express the smallest part Of what I feel, and suffer in my heart, For you, whom best I love and value most: But to your service I bequeath my ghost; Which, from this mortal body when untied, Unseen, unheard, shall hover at your side; Nor fright you waking, nor your sleep offend, But wait officious, and your steps attend. How I have loved, excuse my faltering tongue, My spirits feeble, and my pains are strong: This I may say, I only grieve to die, Because I lose my charming Emily. To die, when heaven had put you in my power! Fate could not choose a more malicious hour. What greater curse could envious fortune give, Than just to die, when I began to live! Vain men! how vanishing a bliss we crave, Now warm in love, now withering in the grave! Never, O never more to see the sun! Still dark, in a damp vault, and still alone! This fate is common; but I lose my breath Near bliss, and yet not blessed, before my death. Farewell! but take me, dying, in your arms, 'Tis all I can enjoy of all your charms: This hand I cannot but in death resign; Ah, could I live! but while I live 'tis mine. I feel my end approach, and, thus embraced, Am pleased to die; but hear me speak my last: Ah, my sweet foe! for you, and you alone, I broke my faith with injured Palamon. But love the sense of right and wrong confounds; Strong love and proud ambition have no bounds. And much I doubt, should heaven my life prolong, I should return to justify my wrong; For, while my former flames remain within, Repentance is but want of power to sin. With mortal hatred I pursued his life, Nor he, nor you, were guilty of the strife; Nor I, but as I loved; yet all combined, Your beauty, and my impotence of mind; And his concurrent flame, that blew my fire; For still our kindred souls had one desire. He had a moment's right, in point of time; Had I seen first, then his had been the crime. Fate made it mine, and justified his right; Nor holds this earth a more deserving knight, For virtue, valour, and for noble blood, Truth, honour, all that is comprised in good; So help me heaven, in all the world is none So worthy to be loved as Palamon. He loves you too, with such a holy fire, As will not, cannot, but with life expire: Our vowed affections both have often tried, Nor any love but yours could ours divide. Then, by my love's inviolable band, By my long-suffering, and my short command, If e'er you plight your vows when I am gone, Have pity on the faithful Palamon.” This was his last; for Death came on amain, And exercised below his iron reign; Then upward to the seat of life he goes; Sense fled before him, what he touched he froze: Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw, Though less and less of Emily he saw; So, speechless, for a little space he lay; Then grasped the hand he held, and sighed his soul away. But whither went his soul, let such relate Who search the secrets of the future state: Divines can say but what themselves believe; Strong proofs they have, but not demonstrative; For, were all plain, then all sides must agree, And faith itself be lost in certainty. To live uprightly, then, is sure the best; To save ourselves, and not to damn the rest. The soul of Arcite went where heathens go, Who better live than we, though less they know. In Palamon a manly grief appears; Silent he wept, ashamed to show his tears. Emilia shrieked but once; and then, oppressed With sorrow, sunk upon her lover's breast: Till Theseus in his arms conveyed, with care, Far from so sad a sight, the swooning fair. 'Twere loss of time her sorrow to relate; Ill bears the sex a youthful lover's fate, When just approaching to the nuptial state: But, like a low-hung cloud, it rains so fast, That all at once it falls, and cannot last. The face of things is changed, and Athens now, That laughed so late, becomes the scene of woe: Matrons and maids, both sexes, every state, With tears lament the knight's untimely fate. Not greater grief in falling Troy was seen For Hector's death, but Hector was not then. Old men with dust deformed their hoary hair; The women beat their breasts, their cheeks they tear. “Why wouldst thou go, (with one consent they cry,) When thou hadst gold enough, and Emily!” Theseus himself, who should have cheered the grief Of others, wanted now the same relief: Old Egeus only could revive his son, Who various changes of the world had known, And strange vicissitudes of human fate, Still altering, never in a steady state: Good after ill, and, after pain, delight, Alternate, like the scenes of day and night. Since every man, who lives, is born to die, And none can boast sincere felicity, With equal mind, what happens, let us bear, Nor joy, nor grieve too much, for things beyond our care. Like pilgrims, to the appointed place we tend; The world's an inn, and death the journey's end. Even kings but play; and, when their part is done, Some other, worse or better, mount the throne. With words like these the crowd was satisfied, And so they would have been had Theseus died. But he, their king, was labouring in his mind, A fitting place for funeral pomps to find, Which were in honour of the dead designed. And, after long debate, at last he found (As love itself had marked the spot of ground) That grove, for ever green, that conscious laund, Where he with Palamon fought hand to hand; That, where he fed his amorous desires With soft complaints, and felt his hottest fires, There other flames might waste his earthly part, And burn his limbs, where love had burned his heart. This once resolved, the peasants were enjoined, Sere-wood, and firs, and doddered oaks to find. With sounding axes to the grove they go, Fell, split, and lay the fuel on a row; Vulcanian food: a bier is next prepared, On which the lifeless body should be reared, Covered with cloth of gold; on which was laid The corpse of Arcite, in like robes arrayed. White gloves were on his hands, and on his head A wreath of laurel, mixed with myrtle, spread. A sword, keen-edged, within his right he held, The warlike emblem of the conquered field. Bare was his manly visage on the bier; Menaced his countenance, even in death severe. Then to the palace-hall they bore the knight, To lie in solemn state, a public sight: Groans, cries, and howlings, fill the crowded place, And unaffected sorrow sat on every face. Sad Palamon above the rest appears, In sable garments, dewed with gushing tears; His auburn locks on either shoulder flowed, Which to the funeral of his friend he vowed: But Emily, as chief, was next his side, A virgin-widow, and a mourning bride. And, that the princely obsequies might be Performed according to his high degree, The steed, that bore him living to the fight, Was trapped with polished steel, all shining bright, And covered with the achievements of the knight. The riders rode abreast; and one his shield, His lance of cornel-wood another held; The third his bow; and, glorious to behold, The costly quiver, all of burnished gold. The noblest of the Grecians next appear, And, weeping, on their shoulders bore the bier; With sober pace they marched, and often stayed, And through the master-street the corpse conveyed. The houses to their tops with black were spread, And even the pavements were with mourning hid. The right side of the pall old Egeus kept, And on the left the royal Theseus wept; Each bore a golden bowl, of work divine, With honey filled, and milk, and mixed with ruddy wine. Then Palamon, the kinsman of the slain; And after him appeared the illustrious train. To grace the pomp, came Emily the bright, With covered fire, the funeral pile to light. With high devotion was the service made, And all the rites of pagan honour paid: So lofty was the pile, a Parthian bow, With vigour drawn, must send the shaft below. The bottom was full twenty fathom broad, With crackling straw beneath in due proportion strowed. The fabric seemed a wood of rising green, With sulphur and bitumen cast between, To feed the flames; the trees were unctuous fir, And mountain-ash, the mother of the spear; The mourner-yew, and builder-oak, were there; The beech, the swimming alder, and the plane, Hard box, and linden of a softer grain, And laurels, which the gods for conquering chiefs ordain. How they were ranked shall rest untold by me, With nameless nymphs that lived in every tree; Nor how the Dryads, and the woodland train, Disherited, ran howling o'er the plain; Nor how the birds to foreign seats repaired, Or beasts that bolted out, and saw the forest bared; Nor how the ground, now cleared, with ghastly fright, Beheld the sudden sun, a stranger to the light. The straw, as first I said, was laid below; Of chips, and sere-wood, was the second row; The third of greens, and timber newly felled; The fourth high stage the fragrant odours held, And pearls, and precious stones, and rich array; In midst of which, embalmed, the body lay. The service sung, the maid, with mourning eyes, The stubble fired; the smouldering flames arise: This office done, she sunk upon the ground; But what she spoke, recovered from her swound, I want the wit in moving words to dress; But, by themselves, the tender sex may guess. While the devouring fire was burning fast, Rich jewels in the flame the wealthy cast; And some their shields, and some their lances threw, And gave the warrior's ghost a warrior's due. Full bowls of wine, of honey, milk, and blood, Were poured upon the pile of burning wood; And hissing flames receive, and, hungry, lick the food. Then thrice the mounted squadrons ride around The fire, and Arcite's name they thrice resound. “Hail and farewell!” they shouted thrice amain, Thrice facing to the left, and thrice they turned again: Still, as they turned, they beat their clattering shields; The women mix their cries, and clamour fills the fields. The warlike wakes continued all the night, And funeral-games were played at new-returning light: Who, naked, wrestled best, besmeared with oil, Or who, with gauntlets, gave or took the foil, I will not tell you, nor would you attend; But briefly haste to my long story's end. I pass the rest. The year was fully mourned, And Palamon long since to Thebes returned. When, by the Grecians' general consent, At Athens Theseus held his parliament; Among the laws that passed, it was decreed, That conquered Thebes from bondage should be freed; Reserving homage to the Athenian throne, To which the sovereign summoned Palamon. Unknowing of the cause, he took his way, Mournful in mind, and still in black array. The monarch mounts the throne, and, placed on high, Commands into the court the beauteous Emily. So called, she came; the senate rose, and paid Becoming reverence to the royal maid. And first soft whispers through the assembly went; With silent wonder then they watched the event: All hushed, the king arose with awful grace, Deep thought was in his breast, and counsel in his face: At length he sighed, and, having first prepared The attentive audience, thus his will declared:— “The Cause and Spring of motion, from above, Hung down on earth, the golden chain of Love; Great was the effect, and high was his intent, When peace among the jarring seeds he sent: Fire, flood, and earth, and air, by this were bound, And love, the common link, the new creation crowned. The chain still holds; for, though the forms decay, Eternal matter never wears away: The same first Mover certain bounds has placed, How long those perishable forms shall last; Nor can they last beyond the time assigned By that all-seeing, and all-making Mind: Shorten their hours they may; for will is free; But never pass the appointed destiny. So men oppressed, when weary of their breath, Throw off the burden, and suborn their death. Then, since those forms begin, and have their end, On some unaltered cause they sure depend: Parts of the whole are we; but God the whole; Who gives us life, and animating soul. For nature cannot from a part derive That being, which the whole can only give: He, perfect, stable; but imperfect we, Subject to change, and different in degree; Plants, beasts, and man; and, as our organs are, We, more or less, of his perfection share. But, by a long descent, the ethereal fire Corrupts; and forms, the mortal part, expire. As he withdraws his virtue, so they pass, And the same matter makes another mass. This law the Omniscient Power was pleased to give, That every kind should by succession live; That individuals die, his will ordains; The propagated species still remains. The monarch oak, the patriarch of the trees, Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow degrees; Three centuries he grows, and three he stays, Supreme in state, and in three more decays: So wears the paving pebble in the street, And towns and towers their fatal periods meet So rivers, rapid once, now naked lie, Forsaken of their springs, and leave their channels dry: So man, at first a drop, dilates with heat, Then formed, the little heart begins to beat; Secret he feeds, unknowing in the cell; At length, for hatching ripe, he breaks the shell, And struggles into breath, and cries for aid; Then, helpless, in his mother's lap is laid. He creeps, he walks, and, issuing into man, Grudges their life, from whence his own began; Retchless of laws, affects to rule alone, Anxious to reign, and restless on the throne; First vegetive, then feels, and reasons last; Rich of three souls, and lives all three to waste. Some thus, but thousands more in flower of age; For few arrive to run the latter stage. Sunk in the first, in battle some are slain, And others whelmed beneath the stormy main. What makes all this, but Jupiter the king, At whose command we perish, and we spring? Then 'tis our best, since thus ordained to die, To make a virtue of necessity; Take what he gives, since to rebel is vain; The bad grows better, which we well sustain; And could we choose the time, and choose aright, 'Tis best to die, our honour at the height. When we have done our ancestors no shame, But served our friends, and well secured our fame; Then should we wish our happy life to close, And leave no more for fortune to dispose. So should we make our death a glad relief From future shame, from sickness, and from grief; Enjoying, while we live, the present hour, And dying in our excellence and flower. Then round our deathbed every friend should run, And joy us of our conquest early won; While the malicious world, with envious tears, Should grudge our happy end, and wish it theirs. Since then our Arcite is with honour dead, Why should we mourn, that he so soon is freed, Or call untimely, what the gods decreed? With grief as just, a friend may be deplored, From a foul prison to free air restored. Ought he to thank his kinsman or his wife, Could tears recall him into wretched life? Their sorrow hurts themselves; on him is lost; And, worse than both, offends his happy ghost. What then remains, but, after past annoy, To take the good vicissitude of joy; To thank the gracious gods for what they give, Possess our souls, and while we live, to live? Ordain we then two sorrows to combine, And in one point the extremes of grief to join; That thence resulting joy may be renewed, As jarring notes in harmony conclude. Then I propose, that Palamon shall be In marriage joined with beauteous Emily; For which already I have gained the assent Of my free people in full parliament. Long love to her has borne the faithful knight, And well deserved, had fortune done him right: 'Tis time to mend her fault, since Emily, By Arcite's death, from former vows is free; If you, fair sister, ratify the accord, And take him for your husband and your lord. 'Tis no dishonour to confer your grace On one descended from a royal race; And were he less, yet years of service past, From grateful souls, exact reward at last. Pity is heaven's and yours; nor can she find A throne so soft as in a woman's mind.” He said: she blushed; and, as o'erawed by might, Seemed to give Theseus what she gave the knight. Then, turning to the Theban, thus he said:— “Small arguments are needful to persuade Your temper to comply with my command:” And, speaking thus, he gave Emilia's hand. Smiled Venus, to behold her own true knight Obtain the conquest, though he lost the fight; And blessed, with nuptial bliss, the sweet laborious night. Eros and Anteros, on either side, One fired the bridegroom, and one warmed the bride; And long-attending Hymen, from above, Showered on the bed the whole Idalian grove. All of a tenor was their after-life, No day discoloured with domestic strife; No jealousy, but mutual truth believed, Secure repose, and kindness undeceived. Thus heaven, beyond the compass of his thought, Sent him the blessing he so dearly bought. So may the Queen of Love long duty bless, And all true lovers find the same success! THE COCK AND THE FOX; OR, THE TALE OF THE NUN'S PRIEST. There lived, as authors tell, in days of yore, A widow, somewhat old, and very poor; Deep in a cell her cottage lonely stood, Well thatched, and under covert of a wood. This dowager, on whom my tale I found, Since last she laid her husband in the ground, A simple sober life in patience led, And had but just enough to buy her bread; But housewifing the little heaven had lent, She duly paid a groat for quarter rent; And pinched her belly, with her daughters two, To bring the year about with much ado. The cattle in her homestead were three sows, An ewe called Mally, and three brinded cows. Her parlour-window stuck with herbs around, Of savoury smell, and rushes strewed the ground. A maple dresser in her hall she had, On which full many a slender meal she made: For no delicious morsel passed her throat; According to her cloth she cut her coat. No poignant sauce she knew, no costly treat, Her hunger gave a relish to her meat. A sparing diet did her health assure; Or sick, a pepper posset was her cure. Before the day was done, her work she sped, And never went by candle-light to bed. With exercise she sweat ill humours out; Her dancing was not hindered by the gout. Her poverty was glad, her heart content, Nor knew she what the spleen or vapours meant. Of wine she never tasted through the year, But white and black was all her homely cheer; Brown bread and milk, (but first she skimmed her bowls,) And rashers of singed bacon on the coals; On holidays an egg, or two at most; But her ambition never reached to roast. A yard she had, with pales inclosed about, Some high, some low, and a dry ditch without. Within this homestead lived, without a peer, For crowing loud, the noble Chanticleer; So hight her cock, whose singing did surpass The merry notes of organs at the mass. More certain was the crowing of a cock To number hours, than is an abbey-clock; And sooner than the matin-bell was rung, He clapped his wings upon his roost, and sung: For when degrees fifteen ascended right, By sure instinct he knew 'twas one at night. High was his comb, and coral-red withal, In dents embattled like a castle wall; His bill was raven-black, and shone like jet; Blue were his legs, and orient were his feet; White were his nails, like silver to behold, His body glittering like the burnished gold. This gentle cock, for solace of his life, Six misses had, beside his lawful wife; Scandal, that spares no king, though ne'er so good, Says, they were all of his own flesh and blood; His sisters, both by sire and mother's side, And sure their likeness showed them near allied. But make the worst, the monarch did no more, Than all the Ptolemys had done before: When incest is for interest of a nation, 'Tis made no sin by holy dispensation. Some lines have been maintained by this alone, Which by their common ugliness are known. But passing this as from our tale apart, Dame Partlet was the sovereign of his heart: Ardent in love, outrageous in his play, He feathered her a hundred times a day; And she, that was not only passing fair, But was withal discreet, and debonair, Resolved the passive doctrine to fulfil, Though loath, and let him work his wicked will: At board and bed was affable and kind, According as their marriage-vow did bind, And as the Church's precept had enjoined. Even since she was a se'nnight old, they say, Was chaste and humble to her dying day, Nor chick nor hen was known to disobey. By this her husband's heart she did obtain; What cannot beauty, joined with virtue, gain? She was his only joy, and he her pride, She, when he walked, went pecking by his side; If, spurning up the ground, he sprung a corn, The tribute in his bill to her was borne. But oh! what joy it was to hear him sing In summer, when the day began to spring, Stretching his neck, and warbling in his throat, Solus cum sola, then was all his note. For in the days of yore, the birds of parts Were bred to speak, and sing, and learn the liberal arts. It happ'd that perching on the parlour-beam, Amidst his wives, he had a deadly dream, Just at the dawn; and sighed, and groaned so fast, As every breath he drew would be his last. Dame Partlet, ever nearest to his side, Heard all his piteous moan, and how he cried For help from gods and men; and sore aghast She pecked and pulled, and wakened him at last. “Dear heart,” said she, “for love of heaven declare Your pain, and make me partner of your care. You groan, sir, ever since the morning light, As something had disturbed your noble sprite.” “And, madam, well I might,” said Chanticleer, Never was shrovetide-cock in such a fear. Even still I run all over in a sweat, My princely senses not recovered yet. For such a dream I had of dire portent, That much I fear my body will be shent: It bodes I shall have wars and woful strife, Or in a loathsome dungeon end my life. Know, dame, I dreamt within my troubled breast, That in our yard I saw a murderous beast, That on my body would have made arrest. With waking eyes I ne'er beheld his fellow; His colour was betwixt a red and yellow: Tipped was his tail, and both his pricking ears, With black, and much unlike his other hairs; The rest, in shape a beagle's whelp throughout, With broader forehead, and a sharper snout: Deep in his front were sunk his glowing eyes, That yet, methinks, I see him with surprise. Reach out your hand, I drop with clammy sweat, And lay it to my heart, and feel it beat.” “Now fie for shame!” quoth she; “by heaven above, Thou hast for ever lost thy lady's love. No woman can endure a recreant knight; He must be bold by day, and free by night: Our sex desires a husband or a friend, Who can our honour and his own defend; Wise, hardy, secret, liberal of his purse; A fool is nauseous, but a coward worse: No bragging coxcomb, yet no baffled knight, How dar'st thou talk of love, and dar'st not fight? How dar'st thou tell thy dame thou art affeared? Hast thou no manly heart, and hast a beard? “If aught from fearful dreams may be divined, They signify a cock of dunghill kind. All dreams, as in old Galen I have read, Are from repletion and complexion bred; From rising fumes of indigested food, And noxious humours that infect the blood: And sure, my lord, if I can read aright, These foolish fancies, you have had to-night, Are certain symptoms (in the canting style) Of boiling choler, and abounding bile; This yellow gall, that in your stomach floats, Engenders all these visionary thoughts. When choler overflows, then dreams are bred Of flames, and all the family of red; Red dragons, and red beasts, in sleep we view, For humours are distinguished by their hue. From hence we dream of wars and warlike things, And wasps and hornets with their double wings. “Choler adust congeals our blood with fear, Then black bulls toss us, and black devils tear. In sanguine airy dreams aloft we bound; With rheums oppressed, we sink in rivers drowned. “More I could say, but thus conclude my theme, The dominating humour makes the dream. Cato was in his time accounted wise, And he condemns them all for empty lies. Take my advice, and when we fly to ground, With laxatives preserve your body sound, And purge the peccant humours that abound. I should be loath to lay you on a bier; And though there lives no 'pothecary near, I dare for once prescribe for your disease, And save long bills, and a damned doctor's fees. “Two sovereign herbs, which I by practice know, And both at hand, (for in our yard they grow,) On peril of my soul shall rid you wholly Of yellow choler, and of melancholy: You must both purge and vomit; but obey, And for the love of heaven make no delay. Since hot and dry in your complexion join, Beware the sun when in a vernal sign; For when he mounts exalted in the Ram, If then he finds your body in a flame, Replete with choler, I dare lay a groat, A tertian ague is at least your lot. Perhaps a fever (which the gods forefend) May bring your youth to some untimely end: And therefore, sir, as you desire to live, A day or two before your laxative, Take just three worms, nor under nor above, Because the gods unequal numbers love. These digestives prepare you for your purge; Of fumetery, centaury, and spurge, And of ground-ivy add a leaf, or two, All which within our yard or garden grow. Eat these, and be, my lord, of better cheer; Your father's son was never born to fear.” “Madam,” quoth he, “gramercy for your care, But Cato, whom you quoted, you may spare. 'Tis true, a wise and worthy man he seems, And (as you say) gave no belief to dreams; But other men of more authority, And, by the immortal powers, as wise as he, Maintain, with sounder sense, that dreams forbode; For Homer plainly says they come from God. Nor Cato said it; but some modern fool Imposed in Cato's name on boys at school. “Believe me, madam, morning dreams foreshow The events of things, and future weal or woe: Some truths are not by reason to be tried, But we have sure experience for our guide. An ancient author, equal with the best, Relates this tale of dreams among the rest:— “Two friends or brothers, with devout intent, On some far pilgrimage together went. It happened so, that, when the sun was down, They just arrived by twilight at a town; That day had been the baiting of a bull, 'Twas at a feast, and every inn so full, That no void room in chamber, or on ground, And but one sorry bed was to be found; And that so little it would hold but one, Though till this hour they never lay alone. “So were they forced to part; one stayed behind, His fellow sought what lodging he could find: At last he found a stall where oxen stood, And that he rather chose than lie abroad. 'Twas in a further yard without a door; But, for his ease, well littered was the floor. “His fellow, who the narrow bed had kept, Was weary, and without a rocker slept: Supine he snored; but in the dead of night, He dreamt his friend appeared before his sight, Who, with a ghastly look and doleful cry, Said, ‘Help me, brother, or this night I die: Arise, and help, before all help be vain, Or in an ox's stall I shall be slain.’ “Roused from his rest, he wakened in a start, Shivering with horror, and with aching heart; At length to cure himself by reason tries; 'Twas but a dream, and what are dreams but lies? So thinking changed his side, and closed his eyes. His dream returns: his friend appears again: ‘The murderers come, now help, or I am slain:’ 'Twas but a vision still, and visions are but vain. “He dreamt the third; but now his friend appeared Pale, naked, pierced with wounds, with blood besmeared: ‘Thrice warned, awake,’ said he; ‘relief is late, The deed is done; but thou revenge my fate: Tardy of aid, unseal thy heavy eyes, Awake, and with the dawning day arise: Take to the western gate thy ready way, For by that passage they my corpse convey: My corpse is in a tumbrel laid, among The filth, and ordure, and inclosed with dung. That cart arrest, and raise a common cry; For sacred hunger of my gold I die:’ Then showed his grisly wounds; and last he drew A piteous sigh, and took a long adieu. “The frightened friend arose by break of day, And found the stall where late his fellow lay. Then of his impious host inquiring more, Was answered that his guest was gone before: “Muttering he went,” said he, “by morning light, And much complained of his ill rest by night.” This raised suspicion in the pilgrim's mind; Because all hosts are of an evil kind, And oft to share the spoil with robbers joined. “His dream confirmed his thought; with troubled look Straight to the western gate his way he took; There, as his dream foretold, a cart he found, That carried compost forth to dung the ground. This when the pilgrim saw, he stretched his throat, And cried out murder with a yelling note. ‘My murdered fellow in this cart lies dead; Vengeance and justice on the villain's head! You, magistrates, who sacred laws dispense, On you I call to punish this offence.’ “The word thus given, within a little space, The mob came roaring out, and thronged the place. All in a trice they cast the cart to ground, And in the dung the murdered body found; Though breathless, warm, and reeking from the wound. Good heaven, whose darling attribute we find Is boundless grace, and mercy to mankind, Abhors the cruel; and the deeds of night By wondrous ways reveals in open light: Murder may pass unpunished for a time, But tardy justice will o'ertake the crime. And oft a speedier pain the guilty feels, The hue and cry of heaven pursues him at the heels, Fresh from the fact, as in the present case: The criminals are seized upon the place; Carter and horse confronted face to face. Stiff in denial, as the law appoints, On engines they distend their tortured joints; So was confession forced, the offence was known, And public justice on the offenders done. “Here may you see that visions are to dread; And in the page that follows this, I read Of two young merchants, whom the hope of gain Induced in partnership to cross the main; Waiting till willing winds their sails supplied, Within a trading-town they long abide, Full fairly situate on a haven's side. “One evening it befell, that, looking out, The wind they long had wished was come about; Well pleased they went to rest; and if the gale Till morn continued, both resolved to sail. But as together in a bed they lay, The younger had a dream at break of day. A man, he thought, stood frowning at his side, Who warned him for his safety to provide, Nor put to sea, but safe on shore abide. ‘I come, thy genius, to command thy stay; Trust not the winds, for fatal is the day, And death unhoped attends the wat'ry way.’ “The vision said, and vanished from his sight. The dreamer wakened in a mortal fright; Then pulled his drowsy neighbour, and declared, What in his slumber he had seen and heard. His friend smiled scornful, and, with proud contempt, Rejects as idle what his fellow dreamt. ‘Stay, who will stay; for me no fears restrain, Who follow Mercury, the god of gain; Let each man do as to his fancy seems, I wait not, I, till you have better dreams. Dreams are but interludes, which fancy makes; When monarch reason sleeps, this mimic wakes; Compounds a medley of disjointed things, A mob of cobblers, and a court of kings: Light fumes are merry, grosser fumes are sad; Both are the reasonable soul run mad; And many monstrous forms in sleep we see, That neither were, nor are, nor e'er can be. Sometimes, forgotten things long cast behind Rush forward in the brain, and come to mind. The nurse's legends are for truths received, And the man dreams but what the boy believed. “‘Sometimes we but rehearse a former play, The night restores our actions done by day, As hounds in sleep will open for their prey. In short, the farce of dreams is of a piece, Chimeras all; and more absurd, or less. You, who believe in tales, abide alone; Whate'er I get this voyage is my own.’ “Thus while he spoke, he heard the shouting crew That called aboard, and took his last adieu. The vessel went before a merry gale, And for quick passage put on every sail; But when least feared, and even in open day, The mischief overtook her in the way: Whether she sprung a leak, I cannot find, Or whether she was overset with wind, Or that some rock below her bottom rent, But down at once with all the crew she went. Her fellow-ships from far her loss descried; But only she was sunk, and all were safe beside. “By this example you are taught again, That dreams and visions are not always vain; But if, dear Partlet, you are yet in doubt, Another tale shall make the former out. “Kenelm, the son of Kenulph, Mercia's king, Whose holy life the legends loudly sing, Warned in a dream, his murder did foretell, From point to point as after it befell: All circumstances to his nurse he told, (A wonder from a child of seven years old;) The dream with horror heard, the good old wife From treason counselled him to guard his life; But close to keep the secret in his mind, For a boy's vision small belief would find. The pious child, by promise bound, obeyed, Nor was the fatal murder long delayed; By Quenda slain, he fell before his time, Made a young martyr by his sister's crime. The tale is told by venerable Bede, Which, at your better leisure, you may read. “Macrobius too relates the vision sent To the great Scipio, with the famed event; Objections makes, but after makes replies, And adds, that dreams are often prophecies. “Of Daniel you may read in holy writ, Who, when the king his vision did forget, Could word for word the wondrous dream repeat. Nor less of patriarch Joseph understand, Who by a dream enslaved the Egyptian land, The years of plenty and of dearth foretold, When, for their bread, their liberty they sold. Nor must the exalted butler be forgot, Nor he whose dream presaged his hanging lot. “And did not Crœsus the same death foresee, Raised in his vision on a lofty tree? The wife of Hector, in his utmost pride, Dreamt of his death the night before he died: Well was he warned from battle to refrain, But men to death decreed are warned in vain; He dared the dream, and by his fatal foe was slain. “Much more I know, which I forbear to speak, For see the ruddy day begins to break: Let this suffice, that plainly I foresee My dream was bad, and bodes adversity; But neither pills nor laxatives I like, They only serve to make a well-man sick; Of these his gain the sharp physician makes, And often gives a purge, but seldom takes; They not correct, but poison all the blood, And ne'er did any but the doctors good. Their tribe, trade, trinkets, I defy them all, With every work of 'pothecary's hall. “These melancholy matters I forbear; But let me tell thee, Partlet mine, and swear, That when I view the beauties of thy face, I fear not death, nor dangers, nor disgrace; So may my soul have bliss, as when I spy The scarlet red about thy partridge eye, While thou art constant to thy own true knight, While thou art mine, and I am thy delight, All sorrows at thy presence take their flight. For true it is, as in principio, Mulier est hominis confusio. Madam, the meaning of this Latin is, That woman is to man his sovereign bliss. For when by night I feel your tender side, Though for the narrow perch I cannot ride, Yet I have such a solace in my mind, That all my boding cares are cast behind, And even already I forget my dream.” He said, and downward flew from off the beam, For daylight now began apace to spring, The thrush to whistle, and the lark to sing. Then crowing, clapped his wings, the appointed call, To chuck his wives together in the hall. By this the widow had unbarred the door, And Chanticleer went strutting out before, With royal courage, and with heart so light, As showed he scorned the visions of the night. Now roaming in the yard, he spurned the ground, And gave to Partlet the first grain he found. Then often feathered her with wanton play, And trod her twenty times ere prime of day; And took by turns and gave so much delight, Her sisters pined with envy at the sight. He chucked again, when other corns he found, And scarcely deigned to set a foot to ground; But swaggered like a lord about his hall, And his seven wives came running at his call. 'Twas now the month in which the world began, (If March beheld the first created man;) And since the vernal equinox, the sun In Aries twelve degrees, or more, had run; When casting up his eyes against the light, Both month, and day, and hour, he measured right, And told more truly than the Ephemeris; For art may err, but nature cannot miss. Thus numbering times and seasons in his breast, His second crowing the third hour confessed. Then turning, said to Partlet,—“See, my dear, How lavish nature has adorned the year; How the pale primrose and blue violet spring, And birds essay their throats disused to sing: All these are ours; and I with pleasure see, Man strutting on two legs, and aping me; An unfledged creature, of a lumpish frame, Endued with fewer particles of flame: Our dame sits cowering o'er a kitchen fire, I draw fresh air, and nature's works admire; And even this day in more delight abound, Than, since I was an egg, I ever found.” The time shall come, when Chanticleer shall wish His words unsaid, and hate his boasted bliss; The crested bird shall by experience know, Jove made not him his masterpiece below, And learn the latter end of joy is woe. The vessel of his bliss to dregs is run, And Heaven will have him taste his other tun. Ye wise! draw near and hearken to my tale, Which proves that oft the proud by flattery fall; The legend is as true I undertake As Tristram is, and Launcelot of the lake; Which all our ladies in such reverence hold, As if in Book of Martyrs it were told. A Fox, full-fraught with seeming sanctity, That feared an oath, but, like the devil, would lie; Who looked like Lent, and had the holy leer, And durst not sin before he said his prayer; This pious cheat, that never sucked the blood, Nor chawed the flesh of lambs, but when he could, Had passed three summers in the neighbouring wood; And musing long, whom next to circumvent, On Chanticleer his wicked fancy bent; And in his high imagination cast, By stratagem to gratify his taste. The plot contrived, before the break of day, Saint Reynard through the hedge had made his way; The pale was next, but proudly, with a bound, He leapt the fence of the forbidden ground; Yet fearing to be seen, within a bed Of coleworts he concealed his wily head; There skulked till afternoon, and watched his time, (As murderers use,) to perpetrate his crime. O hypocrite, ingenious to destroy! O traitor, worse than Sinon was to Troy! O vile subverter of the Gallic reign, More false than Gano was to Charlemaign! O Chanticleer, in an unhappy hour Didst thou forsake the safety of thy bower; Better for thee thou hadst believed thy dream, And not that day descended from the beam! But here the doctors eagerly dispute; Some hold predestination absolute; Some clerks maintain, that Heaven at first foresees, And in the virtue of foresight decrees. If this be so, then prescience binds the will, And mortals are not free to good or ill; For what he first foresaw, he must ordain, Or its eternal prescience may be vain; As bad for us as prescience had not been; For first, or last, he's author of the sin. And who says that, let the blaspheming man Say worse even of the devil, if he can. For how can that Eternal Power be just To punish man, who sins because he must? Or, how can he reward a virtuous deed, Which is not done by us, but first decreed? I cannot bolt this matter to the bran, As Bradwardin and holy Austin can: If prescience can determine actions so, That we must do, because he did foreknow, Or that foreknowing, yet our choice is free, Not forced to sin by strict necessity; This strict necessity they simple call, Another sort there is conditional. The first so binds the will, that things foreknown By spontaneity, not choice, are done. Thus galley-slaves tug willing at their oar, Consent to work, in prospect of the shore; But would not work at all, if not constrained before. That other does not liberty constrain, But man may either act, or may refrain. Heaven made us agents free to good or ill, And forced it not, though he foresaw the will. Freedom was first bestowed on human race, And prescience only held the second place. If he could make such agents wholly free, I not dispute; the point's too high for me: For heaven's unfathomed power what man can sound, Or put to his omnipotence a bound? He made us to his image, all agree; That image is the soul, and that must be, Or not the Maker's image, or be free. But whether it were better man had been By nature bound to good, not free to sin, I wave, for fear of splitting on a rock; The tale I tell is only of a cock; Who had not run the hazard of his life, Had he believed his dream, and not his wife: For women, with a mischief to their kind, Pervert, with bad advice, our better mind. A woman's counsel brought us first to woe, And made her man his paradise forego, Where at heart's ease he lived; and might have been As free from sorrow as he was from sin. For what the devil had their sex to do, That, born to folly, they presumed to know, And could not see the serpent in the grass? But I myself presume, and let it pass. Silence in times of suffering is the best, 'Tis dangerous to disturb a hornet's nest. In other authors you may find enough, But all they say of dames is idle stuff. Legends of lying wits together bound, The wife of Bath would throw them to the ground: These are the words of Chanticleer, not mine, I honour dames, and think their sex divine. Now to continue what my tale begun. Lay madam Partlet basking in the sun, Breast-high in sand; her sisters, in a row, Enjoyed the beams above, the warmth below. The cock, that of his flesh was ever free, Sung merrier than the mermaid in the sea; And so befell, that as he cast his eye, Among the coleworts, on a butterfly, He saw false Reynard where he lay full low; I need not swear he had no list to crow; But cried, Cock, cock, and gave a sudden start, As sore dismayed and frighted at his heart. For birds and beasts, informed by nature, know Kinds opposite to theirs, and fly their foe. So Chanticleer, who never saw a fox, Yet shunned him, as a sailor shuns the rocks. But the false loon, who could not work his will By open force, employed his flattering skill: “I hope, my lord,” said he, “I not offend; Are you afraid of me, that am your friend? I were a beast indeed to do you wrong, I, who have loved and honoured you so long: Stay, gentle sir, nor take a false alarm, For, on my soul, I never meant you harm! I come no spy, nor as a traitor press, To learn the secrets of your soft recess: Far be from Reynard so profane a thought, But by the sweetness of your voice was brought: For, as I bid my beads, by chance I heard The song as of an angel in the yard; A song that would have charmed the infernal gods, And banished horror from the dark abodes: Had Orpheus sung it in the nether sphere, So much the hymn had pleased the tyrant's ear, The wife had been detained, to keep the husband there. “My lord, your sire familiarly I knew, A peer deserving such a son as you: He, with your lady-mother, (whom heaven rest!) Has often graced my house, and been my guest: To view his living features does me good, For I am your poor neighbour in the wood; And in my cottage should be proud to see The worthy heir of my friend's family. “But since I speak of singing, let me say, As with an upright heart I safely may, That, save yourself, there breathes not on the ground One like your father for a silver sound. So sweetly would he wake the winter-day, That matrons to the church mistook their way, And thought they heard the merry organ play. And he to raise his voice with artful care, (What will not beaux attempt to please the fair?) On tiptoe stood to sing with greater strength, And stretched his comely neck at all the length: And while he pained his voice to pierce the skies, As saints in raptures use, would shut his eyes, That the sound striving through the narrow throat, His winking might avail to mend the note. By this, in song, he never had his peer, From sweet Cecilia down to Chanticleer; Not Maro's muse, who sung the mighty man, Nor Pindar's heavenly lyre, nor Horace when a swan. Your ancestors proceed from race divine: From Brennus and Belinus is your line; Who gave to sovereign Rome such loud alarms, That even the priests were not excused from arms. “Besides, a famous monk of modern times Has left of cocks recorded in his rhymes, That of a parish priest the son and heir, (When sons of priests were from the proverb clear,) Affronted once a cock of noble kind, And either lamed his legs, or struck him blind; For which the clerk his father was disgraced, And in his benefice another placed. Now sing, my lord, if not for love of me, Yet for the sake of sweet saint charity; Make hills and dales, and earth and heaven, rejoice, And emulate your father's angel-voice.” The cock was pleased to hear him speak so fair, And proud beside, as solar people are; Nor could the treason from the truth descry, So was he ravished with this flattery: So much the more, as from a little elf, He had a high opinion of himself; Though sickly, slender, and not large of limb, Concluding all the world was made for him. Ye princes, raised by poets to the gods, And Alexandered up in lying odes, Believe not every flattering knave's report, There's many a Reynard lurking in the court; And he shall be received with more regard, And listened to, than modest truth is heard. This Chanticleer, of whom the story sings, Stood high upon his toes, and clapped his wings; Then stretched his neck, and winked with both his eyes, Ambitious, as he sought the Olympic prize. But while he pained himself to raise his note, False Reynard rushed, and caught him by the throat. Then on his back he laid the precious load, And sought his wonted shelter of the wood; Swiftly he made his way, the mischief done, Of all unheeded, and pursued by none. Alas! what stay is there in human state, Or who can shun inevitable fate? The doom was written, the decree was past, Ere the foundations of the world were cast! In Aries though the sun exalted stood, His patron-planet to procure his good; Yet Saturn was his mortal foe, and he, In Libra raised, opposed the same degree: The rays both good and bad, of equal power, Each thwarting other, made a mingled hour. On Friday-morn he dreamt this direful dream, Cross to the worthy native, in his scheme. Ah, blissful Venus! goddess of delight! How couldst thou suffer thy devoted knight, On thy own day, to fall by foe oppressed, The wight of all the world who served thee best? Who, true to love, was all for recreation, And minded not the work of propagation? Ganfride, who couldst so well in rhyme complain The death of Richard with an arrow slain, Why had not I thy muse, or thou my heart, To sing this heavy dirge with equal art! That I like thee on Friday might complain; For on that day was Cœur de Lion slain.” Not louder cries, when Ilium was in flames, Were sent to heaven by woful Trojan dames, When Pyrrhus tossed on high his burnished blade, And offered Priam to his father's shade, Than for the cock the widowed poultry made. Fair Partlet first, when he was borne from sight, With sovereign shrieks bewailed her captive knight; Far louder than the Carthaginian wife, When Asdrubal her husband lost his life, When she beheld the smould'ring flames ascend, And all the Punic glories at an end: Willing into the fires she plunged her head, With greater ease than others seek their bed. Not more aghast the matrons of renown, When tyrant Nero burned the imperial town, Shrieked for the downfall in a doleful cry, For which their guiltless lords were doomed to die. Now to my story I return again: The trembling widow, and her daughters twain, This woful cackling cry with horror heard, Of those distracted damsels in the yard; And starting up, beheld the heavy sight, How Reynard to the forest took his flight, And cross his back, as in triumphant scorn, The hope and pillar of the house was borne. “The Fox, the wicked Fox,” was all the cry; Out from his house ran every neighbour nigh: The vicar first, and after him the crew, With forks and staves the felon to pursue. Ran Coll our dog, and Talbot with the band, And Malkin, with her distaff in her hand: Ran cow and calf, and family of hogs, In panic horror of pursuing dogs; With many a deadly grunt and doleful squeak, Poor swine, as if their pretty hearts would break. The shouts of men, the women in dismay, With shrieks augment the terror of the day. The ducks, that heard the proclamation cried, And feared a persecution might betide, Full twenty miles from town their voyage take, Obscure in rushes of the liquid lake. The geese fly o'er the barn; the bees, in arms, Drive headlong from their waxen cells in swarms. Jack Straw at London-stone, with all his rout, Struck not the city with so loud a shout; Not when with English hate they did pursue A Frenchman, or an unbelieving Jew; Not when the welkin rung with One and all, And echoes bounded back from Fox's hall; Earth seemed to sink beneath, and heaven above to fall. With might and main they chased the murd'rous fox, With brazen trumpets, and inflated box, To kindle Mars with military sounds, Nor wanted horns to inspire sagacious hounds. But see how fortune can confound the wise, And when they least expect it, turn the dice. The captive-cock, who scarce could draw his breath, And lay within the very jaws of death; Yet in this agony his fancy wrought, And fear supplied him with this happy thought: “Yours is the prize, victorious prince,” said he, “The vicar my defeat, and all the village see. Enjoy your friendly fortune while you may, And bid the churls that envy you the prey Call back their mongrel curs, and cease their cry: See fools, the shelter of the wood is nigh, And Chanticleer in your despite shall die; He shall be plucked and eaten to the bone.” “'Tis well advised, in faith it shall be done;” This Reynard said: but as the word he spoke, The prisoner with a spring from prison broke; Then stretched his feathered fans with all his might, And to the neighbouring maple winged his flight. Whom, when the traitor safe on tree beheld, He cursed the gods, with shame and sorrow filled: Shame for his folly; sorrow out of time, For plotting an unprofitable crime: Yet, mastering both, the artificer of lies, Renews the assault, and his last battery tries. “Though I,” said he, “did ne'er in thought offend, How justly may my lord suspect his friend? The appearance is against me, I confess, Who seemingly have put you in distress. You, if your goodness does not plead my cause, May think I broke all hospitable laws, To bear you from your palace-yard by might, And put your noble person in a fright. This, since you take it ill, I must repent, Though heaven can witness, with no bad intent I practised it, to make you taste your cheer With double pleasure, first prepared by fear. So loyal subjects often seize their prince, Forced (for his good) to seeming violence, Yet mean his sacred person not the least offence. Descend; so help me, Jove, as you shall find, That Reynard comes of no dissembling kind.” “Nay,” quoth the cock; “but I beshrew us both, If I believe a saint upon his oath: An honest man may take a knave's advice, But idiots only will be cozened twice: Once warned is well bewared; no flattering lies Shall soothe me more to sing with winking eyes, And open mouth, for fear of catching flies. Who blindfold walks upon a river's brim, When he should see, has he deserved to swim?” “Better, Sir Cock, let all contention cease; Come down,” said Reynard, “let us treat of peace.” “A peace with all my soul,” said Chanticleer; “But, with your favour, I will treat it here: And lest the truce with treason should be mixt, 'Tis my concern to have the tree betwixt.” THE MORAL. In this plain fable you the effect may see Of negligence, and fond credulity: And learn besides of flatterers to beware, Then most pernicious when they speak too fair. The cock and fox, the fool and knave imply; The truth is moral, though the tale a lie. Who spoke in parables, I dare not say; But sure he knew it was a pleasing way, Sound sense, by plain example, to convey. And in a heathen author we may find, That pleasure with instruction should be joined; So take the corn, and leave the chaff behind. THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF; OR, THE LADY IN THE ARBOUR. A VISION. Now turning from the wintry signs, the sun His course exalted through the Ram had run, And whirling up the skies, his chariot drove Through Taurus, and the lightsome realms of love; Where Venus from her orb descends in showers, To glad the ground, and paint the fields with flowers: When first the tender blades of grass appear, And buds, that yet the blast of Eurus fear, Stand at the door of life, and doubt to clothe the year; Till gentle heat, and soft repeated rains, Make the green blood to dance within their veins: Then, at their call emboldened, out they come, And swell the gems, and burst the narrow room; Broader and broader yet their blooms display, Salute the welcome sun, and entertain the day. Then from their breathing souls the sweets repair To scent the skies, and purge the unwholesome air: Joy spreads the heart, and, with a general song, Spring issues out, and leads the jolly months along. In that sweet season, as in bed I lay, And sought in sleep to pass the night away, I turned my weary side, but still in vain, Though full of youthful health, and void of pain. Cares I had none, to keep me from my rest, For love had never entered in my breast; I wanted nothing fortune could supply, Nor did she slumber till that hour deny. I wondered then, but after found it true, Much joy had dried away the balmy dew: Seas would be pools, without the brushing air To curl the waves; and sure some little care Should weary nature so, to make her want repair. When Chanticleer the second watch had sung, Scorning the scorner sleep, from bed I sprung; And dressing, by the moon, in loose array, Passed out in open air, preventing day, And sought a goodly grove, as fancy led my way. Straight as a line in beauteous order stood Of oaks unshorn, a venerable wood; Fresh was the grass beneath, and every tree, At distance planted in a due degree, Their branching arms in air with equal space Stretched to their neighbours with a long embrace: And the new leaves on every bough were seen, Some ruddy-coloured, some of lighter green. The painted birds, companions of the spring, Hopping from spray to spray, were heard to sing. Both eyes and ears received a like delight, Enchanting music, and a charming sight. On Philomel I fixed my whole desire, And listened for the queen of all the quire; Fain would I hear her heavenly voice to sing, And wanted yet an omen to the spring. Attending long in vain, I took the way, Which through a path, but scarcely printed, lay; In narrow mazes oft it seemed to meet, And looked as lightly pressed by fairy feet, Wandering I walked alone, for still methought To some strange end so strange a path was wrought: At last it led me where an arbour stood, The sacred receptacle of the wood: This place unmarked, though oft I walked the green, In all my progress I had never seen; And seized at once with wonder and delight, Gazed all around me, new to the transporting sight. 'Twas benched with turf, and, goodly to be seen, The thick young grass arose in fresher green: The mound was newly made, no sight could pass Betwixt the nice partitions of the grass; The well-united sods so closely lay, And all around the shades defended it from day; For sycamores with eglantine were spread, A hedge about the sides, a covering over head. And so the fragrant brier was wove between, The sycamore and flowers were mixed with green, That nature seemed to vary the delight, And satisfied at once the smell and sight. The master workman of the bower was known Through fairy-lands, and built for Oberon; Who twining leaves with such proportion drew, They rose by measure, and by rule they grew; No mortal tongue can half the beauty tell, For none but hands divine could work so well. Both roof and sides were like a parlour made A soft recess, and a cool summer shade; The hedge was set so thick, no foreign eye The persons placed within it could espy; But all that passed without with ease was seen, As if nor fence nor tree was placed between. 'Twas bordered with a field; and some was plain With grass, and some was sowed with rising grain, That (now the dew with spangles decked the ground) A sweeter spot of earth was never found. I looked and looked, and still with new delight; Such joy my soul, such pleasures filled my sight; And the fresh eglantine exhaled a breath, Whose odours were of power to raise from death. Nor sullen discontent, nor anxious care, Even though brought thither, could inhabit there: But thence they fled as from their mortal foe; For this sweet place could only pleasure know. Thus as I mused, I cast aside my eye, And saw a medlar-tree was planted nigh. The spreading branches made a goodly show, And full of opening blooms was every bough: A goldfinch there I saw with gaudy pride Of painted plumes, that hopped from side to side, Still pecking as she passed; and still she drew The sweets from every flower, and sucked the dew: Sufficed at length, she warbled in her throat, And tuned her voice to many a merry note, But indistinct, and neither sweet nor clear, Yet such as soothed my soul, and pleased my ear. Her short performance was no sooner tried, When she I sought, the nightingale, replied: So sweet, so shrill, so variously she sung, That the grove echoed, and the valleys rung; And I so ravished with her heavenly note, I stood entranced, and had no room for thought, But all o'erpowered with ecstasy of bliss, Was in a pleasing dream of paradise; At length I waked, and, looking round the bower, Searched every tree, and pried on every flower, If anywhere by chance I might espy The rural poet of the melody; For still methought she sung not far away: At last I found her on a laurel spray. Close by my side she sate, and fair in sight, Full in a line, against her opposite; Where stood with eglantine the laurel twined, And both their native sweets were well conjoined. On the green bank I sat, and listened long; (Sitting was more convenient for the song:) Nor till her lay was ended could I move, But wished to dwell for ever in the grove. Only methought the time too swiftly passed, And every note I feared would be the last. My sight, and smell, and hearing, were employed, And all three senses in full gust enjoyed. And what alone did all the rest surpass, The sweet possession of the fairy place; Single, and conscious to myself alone Of pleasures to the excluded world unknown; Pleasures which nowhere else were to be found, And all Elysium in a spot of ground. Thus while I sat intent to see and hear, And drew perfumes of more than vital air, All suddenly I heard the approaching sound Of vocal music, on the enchanted ground: An host of saints it seemed, so full the quire; As if the blessed above did all conspire To join their voices, and neglect the lyre. At length there issued from the grove behind A fair assembly of the female kind: A train less fair, as ancient fathers tell, Seduced the sons of heaven to rebel. I pass their forms, and every charming grace; Less than an angel would their worth debase: But their attire, like liveries of a kind, All rich and rare, is fresh within my mind. In velvet white as snow the troop was gowned, The seams with sparkling emeralds set around: Their hoods and sleeves the same; and purfled o'er With diamonds, pearls, and all the shining store Of Eastern pomp: their long-descending train, With rubies edged, and sapphires, swept the plain: High on their heads, with jewels richly set, Each lady wore a radiant coronet. Beneath the circles, all the quire was graced With chaplets green on their fair foreheads placed; Of laurel some, of woodbine many more, And wreaths of Agnus castus others bore: These last, who with those virgin crowns were dressed, Appeared in higher honour than the rest. They danced around; but in the midst was seen A lady of a more majestic mien; By stature, and by beauty, marked their sovereign queen. She in the midst began with sober grace; Her servant's eyes were fixed upon her face, And as she moved or turned, her motions viewed, Her measures kept, and step by step pursued. Methought she trod the ground with greater grace, With more of godhead shining in her face; And as in beauty she surpassed the quire, So, nobler than the rest was her attire. A crown of ruddy gold inclosed her brow, Plain without pomp, and rich without a show: A branch of Agnus castus in her hand She bore aloft (her sceptre of command); Admired, adored by all the circling crowd, For wheresoe'er she turned her face, they bowed: And as she danced, a roundelay she sung, In honour of the laurel, ever young: She raised her voice on high, and sung so clear, The fawns came scudding from the groves to hear, And all the bending forest lent an ear. At every close she made, the attending throng Replied, and bore the burden of the song: So just, so small, yet in so sweet a note, It seemed the music melted in the throat. Thus dancing on, and singing as they danced, They to the middle of the mead advanced, Till round my arbour a new ring they made, And footed it about the secret shade. O'erjoyed to see the jolly troop so near, But somewhat awed, I shook with holy fear; Yet not so much, but that I noted well Who did the most in song or dance excel. Not long I had observed, when from afar I heard a sudden symphony of war; The neighing coursers, and the soldiers' cry, And sounding trumps that seemed to tear the sky: I saw soon after this, behind the grove From whence the ladies did in order move, Come issuing out in arms a warrior train, That like a deluge poured upon the plain: On barbed steeds they rode in proud array, Thick as the college of the bees in May, When swarming o'er the dusky fields they fly, New to the flowers, and intercept the sky. So fierce they drove, their coursers were so fleet, That the turf trembled underneath their feet. To tell their costly furniture were long, The summer's day would end before the song: To purchase but the tenth of all their store, Would make the mighty Persian monarch poor. Yet what I can, I will: before the rest The trumpets issued in white mantles dressed; A numerous troop, and all their heads around With chaplets green of cerrial-oak were crowned, And at each trumpet was a banner bound; Which, waving in the wind, displayed at large Their master's coat-of-arms, and knightly charge. Broad were the banners, and of snowy hue, A purer web the silkworm never drew. The chief about their necks the scutcheons wore, With orient pearls and jewels powdered o'er: Broad were their collars too, and every one Was set about with many a costly stone. Next these, of kings-at-arms a goodly train In proud array came prancing o'er the plain: Their cloaks were cloth of silver mixed with gold, And garlands green around their temples rolled: Rich crowns were on their royal scutcheons placed, With sapphires, diamonds, and with rubies graced: And as the trumpets their appearance made, So these in habits were alike arrayed; But with a pace more sober, and more slow, And twenty, rank in rank, they rode a-row. The pursuivants came next, in number more; And like the heralds each his scutcheon bore: Clad in white velvet all their troop they led, With each an oaken chaplet on his head. Nine royal knights in equal rank succeed, Each warrior mounted on a fiery steed, In golden armour glorious to behold; The rivets of their arms were nailed with gold. Their surcoats of white ermine-fur were made; With cloth of gold between, that cast a glittering shade. The trappings of their steeds were of the same; The golden fringe even set the ground on flame, And drew a precious trail: a crown divine Of laurel did about their temples twine. Three henchmen were for every knight assigned, All in rich livery clad, and of a kind; White velvet, but unshorn, for cloaks they wore, And each within his hand a truncheon bore: The foremost held a helm of rare device; A prince's ransom would not pay the price. The second bore the buckler of his knight, The third of cornel-wood a spear upright, Headed with piercing steel, and polished bright. Like to their lords their equipage was seen, And all their foreheads crowned with garlands green. And after these came, armed with spear and shield, An host so great, as covered all the field: And all their foreheads, like the knights' before, With laurels ever green were shaded o'er, Or oak, or other leaves of lasting kind, Tenacious of the stem, and firm against the wind. Some in their hands, beside the lance and shield, The boughs of woodbine or of hawthorn held, Or branches for their mystic emblems took, Of palm, of laurel, or of cerrial oak. Thus marching to the trumpet's lofty sound, Drawn in two lines adverse they wheeled around, And in the middle meadow took their ground. Among themselves the tourney they divide, In equal squadrons ranged on either side; Then turned their horses' heads, and man to man, And steed to steed opposed, the justs began. They lightly set their lances in the rest, And, at the sign, against each other pressed; They met. I sitting at my ease beheld The mixed events, and fortunes of the field. Some broke their spears, some tumbled horse and man, And round the fields the lightened coursers ran An hour and more, like tides, in equal sway They rushed, and won by turns, and lost the day: At length the nine (who still together held) Their fainting foes to shameful flight compelled, And with resistless force o'erran the field. Thus, to their fame, when finished was the fight, The victors from their lofty steeds alight: Like them dismounted all the warlike train, And two by two proceeded o'er the plain; Till to the fair assembly they advanced, Who near the secret arbour sung and danced. The ladies left their measures at the sight, To meet the chiefs returning from the fight, And each with open arms embraced her chosen knight. Amid the plain a spreading laurel stood, The grace and ornament of all the wood: That pleasing shade they sought, a soft retreat From sudden April showers, a shelter from the heat: Her leafy arms with such extent were spread, So near the clouds was her aspiring head, That hosts of birds, that wing the liquid air, Perched in the boughs, had nightly lodging there: And flocks of sheep beneath the shade from far Might hear the rattling hail, and wintry war; From heaven's inclemency here found retreat, Enjoyed the cool, and shunned the scorching heat: A hundred knights might there at ease abide, And every knight a lady by his side: The trunk itself such odours did bequeath, That a Moluccan breeze to these was common breath. The lords and ladies here, approaching, paid Their homage, with a low obeisance made, And seemed to venerate the sacred shade. These rites performed, their pleasures they pursue, With songs of love, and mix with measures new; Around the holy tree their dance they frame, And every champion leads his chosen dame. I cast my sight upon the further field, And a fresh object of delight beheld: For from the region of the west I heard New music sound, and a new troop appeared; Of knights, and ladies mixed a jolly band, But all on foot they marched, and hand in hand. The ladies dressed in rich cymars were seen Of Florence satin, flowered with white and green, And for a shade betwixt the bloomy gridelin. The borders of their petticoats below Were guarded thick with rubies on a row; And every damsel wore upon her head Of flowers a garland blended white and red. Attired in mantles all the knights were seen, That gratified the view with cheerful green: Their chaplets of their ladies' colours were, Composed of white and red, to shade their shining hair. Before the merry troop the minstrels played; All in their masters' liveries were arrayed, And clad in green, and on their temples wore The chaplets white and red their ladies bore. Their instruments were various in their kind, Some for the bow, and some for breathing wind; The sawtry, pipe, and hautboy's noisy band, And the soft lute trembling beneath the touching hand. A tuft of daisies on a flowery lea They saw, and thitherward they bent their way; To this both knights and dames their homage made, And due obeisance to the daisy paid. And then the band of flutes began to play, To which a lady sung a virelay: And still at every close she would repeat The burden of the song, The daisy is so sweet, The daisy is so sweet, when she begun, The troop of knights and dames continued on. The concert and the voice so charmed my ear, And soothed my soul, that it was heaven to hear. But soon their pleasure passed; at noon of day, The sun with sultry beams began to play: Not Sirius shoots a fiercer flame from high, When with his poisonous breath he blasts the sky; Then drooped the fading flowers (their beauty fled) And closed their sickly eyes, and hung the head, And, rivelled up with heat, lay dying in their bed. The ladies gasped, and scarcely could respire The breath they drew, no longer air but fire; The fainty knights were scorched; and knew not where To run for shelter, for no shade was near. And after this the gathering clouds amain Poured down a storm of rattling hail and rain; And lightning flashed betwixt: the field, and flowers, Burnt up before, were buried in the showers. The ladies and the knights, no shelter nigh, Bare to the weather and the wintry sky, Were dropping wet, disconsolate, and wan, And through their thin array received the rain; While those in white, protected by the tree, Saw pass the vain assault, and stood from danger free. But as compassion moved their gentle minds, When ceased the storm, and silent were the winds, Displeased at what, not suffering, they had seen, They went to cheer the faction of the green: The queen in white array, before her band, Saluting, took her rival by the hand; So did the knights and dames, with courtly grace, And with behaviour sweet their foes embrace. Then thus the queen with laurel on her brow,— “Fair sister, I have suffered in your woe; Nor shall be wanting aught within my power For your relief in my refreshing bower.” That other answered with a lowly look, And soon the gracious invitation took: For ill at ease both she and all her train The scorching sun had borne, and beating rain. Like courtesy was used by all in white, Each dame a dame received, and every knight a knight. The laurel champions with their swords invade The neighbouring forests, where the jousts were made, And sere wood from the rotten hedges took, And seeds of latent fire from flints provoke: A cheerful blaze arose, and by the fire They warmed their frozen feet, and dried their wet attire. Refreshed with heat, the ladies sought around For virtuous herbs, which gathered from the ground They squeezed the juice, and cooling ointment made, Which on their sun-burnt cheeks, and their chapt skins, they laid; Then sought green salads, which they bade them eat, A sovereign remedy for inward heat. The Lady of the Leaf ordained a feast, And made the Lady of the Flower her guest: When lo, a bower ascended on the plain, With sudden seats adorned, and large for either train. This bower was near my pleasant arbour placed, That I could hear and see whatever passed: The ladies sat with each a knight between, Distinguished by their colours, white and green; The vanquished party with the victors joined, Nor wanted sweet discourse, the banquet of the mind. Meantime the minstrels played on either side, Vain of their art, and for the mastery vied: The sweet contention lasted for an hour, And reached my secret arbour from the bower. The sun was set; and Vesper, to supply His absent beams, had lighted up the sky: When Philomel, officious all the day To sing the service of the ensuing May, Fled from her laurel shade, and winged her flight Directly to the queen arrayed in white; And hopping sat familiar on her hand, A new musician, and increased the band. The goldfinch, who, to shun the scalding heat, Had changed the medlar for a safer seat, And hid in bushes scaped the bitter shower, Now perched upon the Lady of the Flower; And either songster holding out their throats, And folding up their wings, renewed their notes; As if all day, preluding to the fight, They only had rehearsed, to sing by night. The banquet ended, and the battle done, They danced by starlight and the friendly moon: And when they were to part, the laureate queen Supplied with steeds the lady of the green. Her and her train conducting on the way, The moon to follow, and avoid the day. This when I saw, inquisitive to know The secret moral of the mystic show, I started from my shade, in hopes to find Some nymph to satisfy my longing mind; And as my fair adventure fell, I found A lady all in white, with laurel crowned, Who closed the rear, and softly paced along, Repeating to herself the former song. With due respect my body I inclined, As to some being of superior kind, And made my court according to the day, Wishing her queen and her a happy May. “Great thanks, my daughter,” with a gracious bow She said: and I, who much desired to know Of whence she was, yet fearful how to break My mind, adventured humbly thus to speak:— “Madam, might I presume and not offend, So may the stars and shining moon attend Your nightly sports, as you vouchsafe to tell, What nymphs they were who mortal forms excel, And what the knights who fought in listed fields so well.” To this the dame replied: “Fair daughter, know, That what you saw was all a fairy show; And all those airy shapes you now behold, Were human bodies once, and clothed with earthly mould: Our souls, not yet prepared for upper light, Till doomsday wander in the shades of night; This only holiday of all the year, We, privileged, in sunshine may appear; With songs and dance we celebrate the day, And with due honours usher in the May. At other times we reign by night alone, And posting through the skies pursue the moon; But when the morn arises, none are found, For cruel Demogorgon walks the round, And if he finds a fairy lag in light, He drives the wretch before, and lashes into night. “All courteous are by kind; and ever proud With friendly offices to help the good. In every land we have a larger space Than what is known to you of mortal race; Where we with green adorn our fairy bowers, And even this grove, unseen before, is ours. Know further; every lady clothed in white, And, crowned with oak and laurel every knight, Are servants to the leaf, by liveries known Of innocence; and I myself am one. Saw you not her so graceful to behold In white attire, and crowned with radiant gold? The sovereign lady of our land is she, Diana called, the queen of chastity; And, for the spotless name of maid she bears, That Agnus castus in her hand appears; And all her train, with leafy chaplets crowned, Were for unblamed virginity renowned; But those the chief and highest in command Who bear those holy branches in their hand: The knights adorned with laurel crowns are they, Whom death nor danger ever could dismay, Victorious names, who made the world obey: Who, while they lived, in deeds of arms excelled, And after death for deities were held. But those, who wear the woodbine on their brow, Were knights of love, who never broke their vow, Firm to their plighted faith, and ever free From fears, and fickle chance, and jealousy. The lords and ladies, who the woodbine bear, As true as Tristram and Isotta were.” “But what are those,” I, “the unconquered nine, Who, crowned with laurel-wreaths, in golden armour shine? And who the knights in green, and what the train Of ladies dressed with daisies on the plain? Why both the bands in worship disagree, And some adore the flower, and some the tree?” “Just is your suit, fair daughter,” said the dame: “Those laurelled chiefs were men of mighty fame; Nine worthies were they called of different rites, Three Jews, three Pagans, and three Christian knights. These, as you see, ride foremost in the field, As they the foremost rank of honour held, And all in deeds of chivalry excelled; Their temples wreathed with leaves, that still renew, For deathless laurel is the victor's due. Who bear the bows were knights in Arthur's reign, Twelve they, and twelve the peers of Charlemain; For bows the strength of brawny arms imply, Emblems of valour, and of victory. Behold an order yet of newer date, Doubling their number, equal in their state; Our England's ornament, the crown's defence, In battle brave, protectors of their prince; Unchanged by fortune, to their sovereign true, For which their manly legs are bound with blue. These, of the garter called, of faith unstained, In fighting fields the laurel have obtained, And well repaid those honours which they gained. The laurel wreaths were first by Cæsar worn, And still they Cæsar's successors adorn; One leaf of this is immortality, And more of worth than all the world can buy.” “One doubt remains,” said I; “the dames in green, What were their qualities, and who their queen?” “Flora commands,” said she, “those nymphs and knights, Who lived in slothful ease and loose delights; Who never acts of honour durst pursue, The men inglorious knights, the ladies all untrue Who, nursed in idleness, and trained in courts, Passed all their precious hours in plays and sports, Till death behind came stalking on, unseen, And withered (like the storm) the freshness of their green. These, and their mates, enjoy the present hour, And therefore pay their homage to the flower. But knights in knightly deeds should persevere, And still continue what at first they were; Continue, and proceed in honour's fair career. No room for cowardice, or dull delay; From good to better they should urge their way. For this with golden spurs the chiefs are graced, With pointed rowels armed, to mend their haste; For this with lasting leaves their brows are bound; For laurel is the sign of labour crowned, Which bears the bitter blast, nor shaken falls to ground: From winter winds it suffers no decay, For ever fresh and fair, and every month is May. Even when the vital sap retreats below, Even when the hoary head is hid in snow, The life is in the leaf, and still between The fits of falling snows appears the streaky green. Not so the flower, which lasts for little space, A short-lived good, and an uncertain grace: This way and that the feeble stem is driven, Weak to sustain the storms and injuries of heaven. Propped by the spring, it lifts aloft the head, But of a sickly beauty, soon to shed; In summer living, and in winter dead. For things of tender kind, for pleasure made, Shoot up with swift increase, and sudden are decayed.” With humble words, the wisest I could frame, And proffered service, I repaid the dame; That, of her grace, she gave her maid to know The secret meaning of this moral show. And she, to prove what profit I had made Of mystic truth, in fables first conveyed, Demanded till the next returning May, Whether the leaf or flower I would obey? I chose the leaf; she smiled with sober cheer, And wished me fair adventure for the year, And gave me charms and sigils, for defence Against ill tongues that scandal innocence:— “But I,” said she, “my fellows must pursue, Already past the plain, and out of view.” We parted thus; I homeward sped my way, Bewildered in the wood till dawn of day; And met the merry crew, who danced about the May. Then late refreshed with sleep, I rose to write The visionary vigils of the night. Blush, as thou may'st, my little book, for shame, Nor hope with homely verse to purchase fame; For such thy maker chose, and so designed Thy simple style to suit thy lowly kind. THE WIFE OF BATH HER TALE. In days of old, when Arthur filled the throne, Whose acts and fame to foreign lands were blown, The king of elves, and little fairy queen, Gambolled on heaths, and danced on every green; And where the jolly troop had led the round, The grass unbidden rose, and marked the ground. Nor darkling did they dance; the silver light Of Phœbe served to guide their steps aright, And, with their tripping pleased, prolonged the night. Her beams they followed, where at full she played, Nor longer than she shed her horns they stayed, From thence with airy flight to foreign lands conveyed. Above the rest our Britain held they dear; More solemnly they kept their Sabbaths here, And made more spacious rings, and revelled half the year. I speak of ancient times; for now the swain, Returning late, may pass the woods in vain, And never hope to see the nightly train; In vain the dairy now with mints is dressed, The dairy-maid expects no fairy guest To skim the bowls, and after pay the feast. She sighs, and shakes her empty shoes in vain, No silver penny to reward her pain; For priests, with prayers, and other godly gear, Have made the merry goblins disappear; And where they played their merry pranks before, Have sprinkled holy water on the floor; And friars, that through the wealthy regions run, Thick as the motes that twinkle in the sun, Resort to farmers rich, and bless their halls, And exorcise the beds, and cross the walls: This makes the fairy quires forsake the place, When once 'tis hallowed with the rites of grace. But in the walks, where wicked elves have been, The learning of the parish now is seen; The midnight parson, posting o'er the green, With gown tucked up to wakes; for Sunday next, With humming ale encouraging his text; Nor wants the holy leer to country-girl betwixt. From fiends and imps he sets the village free, There haunts not any incubus but he. The maids and women need no danger fear To walk by night, and sanctity so near; For by some haycock, or some shady thorn, He bids his beads both evensong and morn. It so befell in this King Arthur's reign, A lusty knight was pricking o'er the plain; A bachelor he was, and of the courtly train. It happened as he rode, a damsel gay, In russet robes, to market took her way; Soon on the girl he cast an amorous eye; So straight she walked, and on her pasterns high: If seeing her behind he liked her pace, Now turning short, he better liked her face. He lights in haste, and, full of youthful fire, By force accomplished his obscene desire. This done, away he rode, not unespied, For, swarming at his back, the country cried; And, once in view, they never lost the sight, But seized, and, pinioned, brought to court the knight. Then courts of kings were held in high renown, Ere made the common brothels of the town; There virgins honourable vows received, But chaste as maids in monasteries lived; The king himself, to nuptial ties a slave, No bad example to his poets gave, And they, not bad but in a vicious age, Had not, to please the prince, debauched the stage. Now, what should Arthur do? He loved the knight, But sovereign monarchs are the source of right: Moved by the damsel's tears and common cry, He doomed the brutal ravisher to die. But fair Geneura rose in his defence, And prayed so hard for mercy from the prince, That to his queen the king the offender gave, And left it in her power to kill or save. This gracious act the ladies all approve, Who thought it much a man should die for love; And, with their mistress, joined in close debate, (Covering their kindness with dissembled hate,) If not to free him, to prolong his fate. At last agreed, they called him by consent Before the queen and female parliament; And the fair speaker, rising from her chair, Did thus the judgment of the house declare:— “Sir knight, though I have asked thy life, yet still Thy destiny depends upon my will: Nor hast thou other surety, than the grace, Not due to thee, from our offended race. But as our kind is of a softer mould, And cannot blood, without a sigh, behold, I grant thee life; reserving still the power To take the forfeit when I see my hour; Unless thy answer to my next demand Shall set thee free from our avenging hand. The question, whose solution I require, Is, what the sex of women most desire? In this dispute thy judges are at strife; Beware, for on thy wit depends thy life. Yet (lest surprised, unknowing what to say, Thou damn thyself) we give thee further day; A year is thine to wander at thy will, And learn from others, if thou want'st the skill; But, not to hold our proffer'd turn in scorn, Good sureties will we have for thy return, That at the time prefixed thou shalt obey, And at thy pledge's peril keep thy day.” Woe was the knight at this severe command, But well he knew 'twas bootless to withstand. The terms accepted, as the fair ordain, He put in bail for his return again; And promised answer at the day assigned, The best, with heaven's assistance, he could find. His leave thus taken, on his way he went With heavy heart, and full of discontent, Misdoubting much, and fearful of the event. 'Twas hard the truth of such a point to find, As was not yet agreed among the kind. Thus on he went; still anxious more and more, Asked all he met, and knocked at every door; Inquired of men; but made his chief request To learn from women what they loved the best. They answered each, according to her mind, To please herself, not all the female kind. One was for wealth, another was for place; Crones, old and ugly, wished a better face. The widow's wish was oftentimes to wed; The wanton maids were all for sport a-bed. Some said the sex were pleased with handsome lies, And some gross flattery loved without disguise. Truth is, says one, he seldom fails to win Who flatters well; for that's our darling sin. But long attendance, and a duteous mind, Will work even with the wisest of the kind. One thought the sex's prime felicity Was from the bonds of wedlock to be free; Their pleasures, hours, and actions, all their own, And, uncontrolled, to give account to none. Some wish a husband-fool; but such are cursed, For fools perverse of husbands are the worst. All women would be counted chaste and wise, Nor should our spouses see but with our eyes; For fools will prate; and though they want the wit To find close faults, yet open blots will hit; Though better for their ease to hold their tongue, For womankind was never in the wrong. So noise ensues, and quarrels last for life; The wife abhors the fool, the fool the wife. And some men say, that great delight have we To be for truth extolled, and secrecy; And constant in one purpose still to dwell, And not our husbands' counsels to reveal. But that's a fable; for our sex is frail, Inventing rather than not tell a tale. Like leaky sieves no secrets we can hold; Witness the famous tale that Ovid told. Midas the king, as in his book appears, By Phœbus was endowed with ass's ears, Which under his long locks he well concealed, (As monarchs' vices must not be revealed,) For fear the people have them in the wind, Who, long ago, were neither dumb nor blind; Nor apt to think from heaven their title springs, Since Jove and Mars left off begetting kings. This Midas knew; and durst communicate To none but to his wife his ears of state; One must be trusted, and he thought her fit, As passing prudent, and a parlous wit. To this sagacious confessor he went, And told her what a gift the gods had sent; But told it under matrimonial seal, With strict injunction never to reveal. The secret heard, she plighted him her troth, (And sacred sure is every woman's oath,) The royal malady should rest unknown, Both for her husband's honour and her own: But ne'ertheless she pined with discontent, The counsel rumbled till it found a vent. The thing she knew she was obliged to hide; By interest and by oath the wife was tied, But, if she told it not, the woman died. Loath to betray a husband and a prince, But she must burst or blab, and no pretence Of honour tied her tongue from self-defence. A marshy ground commodiously was near, Thither she ran, and held her breath for fear, Lest if a word she spoke of any thing, That word might be the secret of the king. Thus full of counsel to the fen she went, Griped all the way, and longing for a vent; Arrived, by pure necessity compelled, On her majestic mary-bones she kneeled: Then to the water's brink she laid her head, And as a bittour bumps within a reed,— “To thee alone, O lake!” she said, “I tell, (And, as thy queen, command thee to conceal:) Beneath his locks, the king my husband wears A goodly royal pair of ass's ears: Now I have eased my bosom of the pain, Till the next longing fit return again.” Thus through a woman was the secret known; Tell us, and, in effect, you tell the town. But to my tale: The knight, with heavy cheer, Wandering in vain, had now consumed the year; One day was only left to solve the doubt, Yet knew no more than when he first set out. But home he must; and, as the award had been, Yield up his body captive to the queen. In this despairing state he happ'd to ride, As fortune led him, by a forest side; Lonely the vale, and full of horror stood, Brown with the shade of a religious wood; When full before him, at the noon of night, (The moon was up, and shot a gleamy light,) He saw a quire of ladies in a round, That featly footing seemed to skim the ground. Thus dancing hand in hand, so light they were, He knew not where they trod, on earth or air. At speed he drove, and came a sudden guest; In hope, where many women were, at least Some one, by chance, might answer his request. But faster than his horse the ladies flew, And in a trice were vanished out of view. One only hag remained; but fouler far Than grandame apes in Indian forests are; Against a withered oak she leaned her weight, Propped on her trusty staff, not half upright, And dropped an awkward courtesy to the knight. Then said, “What make you, sir, so late abroad Without a guide, and this no beaten road? Or want you aught that here you hope to find, Or travel for some trouble in your mind? The last I guess; and if I read aright, Those of our sex are bound to serve a knight. Perhaps good counsel may your grief assuage, Then tell your pain, for wisdom is in age.” To this the knight: “Good mother, would you know The secret cause and spring of all my woe? My life must with to-morrow's light expire, Unless I tell what women most desire. Now could you help me at this hard essay, Or for your inborn goodness, or for pay, Yours is my life, redeemed by your advice, Ask what you please, and I will pay the price: The proudest kerchief of the court shall rest Well satisfied of what they love the best.” “Plight me thy faith,” quoth she, “that what I ask, Thy danger over, and performed the task, That shalt thou give for hire of thy demand, (Here take thy oath, and seal it on my hand,) I warrant thee, on peril of my life, Thy words shall please both widow, maid, and wife.” More words there needed not to move the knight, To take her offer, and his truth to plight. With that she spread her mantle on the ground, And, first inquiring whither he was bound, Bade him not fear, though long and rough the way, At court he should arrive ere break of day: His horse should find the way without a guide, She said: with fury they began to ride, He on the midst, the beldam at his side. The horse, what devil drove I cannot tell, But only this, they sped their journey well; And all the way the crone informed the knight, How he should answer the demand aright. To court they came; the news was quickly spread Of his returning to redeem his head. The female senate was assembled soon, With all the mob of women in the town: The queen sat lord chief-justice of the hall, And bade the crier cite the criminal. The knight appeared, and silence they proclaim: Then first the culprit answered to his name; And, after forms of law, was last required To name the thing that women most desired. The offender, taught his lesson by the way, And by his counsel ordered what to say, Thus bold began: “My lady liege,” said he, “What all your sex desire is—SOVEREIGNTY. The wife affects her husband to command; All must be hers, both money, house, and land: The maids are mistresses even in their name, And of their servants full dominion claim. This, at the peril of my head, I say, A blunt plain truth, the sex aspires to sway, You to rule all, while we, like slaves, obey.” There was not one, or widow, maid, or wife, But said the knight had well deserved his life. Even fair Geneura, with a blush, confessed, The man had found what women love the best. Up starts the beldam, who was there unseen, And, reverence made, accosted thus the queen:— “My liege,” said she, “before the court arise, May I, poor wretch, find favour in your eyes, To grant my just request: 'twas I who taught The knight this answer, and inspired his thought, None but a woman could a man direct To tell us women what we most affect. But first I swore him on his knightly troth, (And here demand performance of his oath,) To grant the boon that next I should desire; He gave his faith, and I expect my hire. My promise is fulfilled: I saved his life, And claim his debt, to take me for his wife.” The knight was asked, nor could his oath deny, But hoped they would not force him to comply. The women, who would rather wrest the laws, Than let a sister-plaintiff lose the cause, (As judges on the bench more gracious are, And more attent to brothers of the bar,) Cried one and all, the suppliant should have right, And to the grandame hag adjudged the knight. In vain he sighed, and oft with tears desired Some reasonable suit might be required. But still the crone was constant to her note; The more he spoke, the more she stretched her throat. In vain he proffered all his goods, to save His body, destined to that living grave. The liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn, And nothing but the man would serve her turn. “Not all the wealth of Eastern kings,” said she, “Has power to part my plighted love, and me: And, old and ugly as I am, and poor, Yet never will I break the faith I swore; For mine thou art by promise, during life, And I thy loving and obedient wife.” “My love! nay rather my damnation thou,” Said he: “nor am I bound to keep my vow; The fiend thy sire has sent thee from below, Else how couldst thou my secret sorrows know? Avaunt, old witch, for I renounce thy bed: The queen may take the forfeit of my head, Ere any of my race so foul a crone shall wed.” Both heard, the judge pronounced against the knight; So was he married in his own despite: And all day after hid him as an owl, Not able to sustain a sight so foul. Perhaps the reader thinks I do him wrong, To pass the marriage-feast, and nuptial song: Mirth there was none, the man was à-la-mort, And little courage had to make his court. To bed they went, the bridegroom and the bride. Was never such an ill-paired couple tied! Restless he tossed, and tumbled to and fro, And rolled, and wriggled further off, for woe. The good old wife lay smiling by his side, And caught him in her quivering arms, and cried,— “When you my ravished predecessor saw, You were not then become this man of straw; Had you been such, you might have scaped the law. Is this the custom of King Arthur's court? Are all Round-table Knights of such a sort? Remember I am she who saved your life, Your loving, lawful, and complying wife: Not thus you swore in your unhappy hour, Nor I for this return employed my power. In time of need I was your faithful friend; Nor did I since, nor ever will offend. Believe me, my loved lord, 'tis much unkind; What fury has possessed your altered mind? Thus on my wedding-night—without pretence— Come turn this way, or tell me my offence. If not your wife, let reason's rule persuade; Name but my fault, amends shall soon be made.” “Amends! nay that's impossible,” said he, “What change of age or ugliness can be? Or could Medea's magic mend thy face, Thou art descended from so mean a race, That never knight was matched with such disgrace. What wonder, madam, if I move my side, When, if I turn, I turn to such a bride?” “And is this all that troubles you so sore?” “And what the devil couldst thou wish me more?” “Ah Benedicite!” replied the crone: “Then cause of just complaining have you none. The remedy to this were soon applied, Would you be like the bridegroom to the bride: But, for you say a long-descended race, And wealth and dignity, and power, and place, Make gentlemen, and that your high degree Is much disparaged to be matched with me,— Know this, my lord, nobility of blood Is but a glittering and fallacious good: The nobleman is he, whose noble mind Is filled with inborn worth, unborrowed from his kind. The King of Heaven was in a manger laid, And took his earth but from an humble maid: Then what can birth, or mortal men, bestow, Since floods no higher than their fountains flow? We, who for name and empty honour strive, Our true nobility from him derive. Your ancestors, who puff your mind with pride, And vast estates to mighty titles tied, Did not your honour, but their own, advance; For virtue comes not by inheritance. If you tralineate from your father's mind, What are you else but of a bastard-kind? Do, as your great progenitors have done, And by their virtues prove yourself their son. No father can infuse, or wit, or grace; A mother comes across, and mars the race. A grandsire or a grandame taints the blood; And seldom three descents continue good. Were virtue by descent, a noble name Could never villanise his father's fame; But, as the first, the last of all the line, Would, like the sun, even in descending shine. Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house, Betwixt King Arthur's court and Caucasus, If you depart, the flame shall still remain, And the bright blaze enlighten all the plain; Nor, till the fuel perish, can decay, By nature formed on things combustible to prey. Such is not man, who, mixing better seed With worse, begets a base degenerate breed. The bad corrupts the good, and leaves behind No trace of all the great begetter's mind. The father sinks within his son, we see, And often rises in the third degree; If better luck a better mother give, Chance gave us being, and by chance we live. Such as our atoms were, even such are we, Or call it chance, or strong necessity: Thus loaded with dead weight, the will is free. And thus it needs must be; for seed conjoined Lets into nature's work the imperfect kind; But fire, the enlivener of the general frame, Is one, its operation still the same. Its principle is in itself: while ours Works, as confederates war, with mingled powers; Or man or woman, whichsoever fails; And, oft, the vigour of the worse prevails. Æther, with sulphur blended, alters hue, And casts a dusky gleam of Sodom blue. Thus, in a brute, their ancient honour ends, And the fair mermaid in a fish descends: The line is gone; no longer duke or earl; But, by himself degraded, turns a churl. Nobility of blood is but renown Of thy great fathers by their virtue known, And a long trail of light, to thee descending down. If in thy smoke it ends, their glories shine; But infamy and villanage are thine. Then what I said before is plainly showed, That true nobility proceeds from God: Not left us by inheritance, but given By bounty of our stars, and grace of heaven. Thus from a captive Servius Tullius rose, Whom for his virtues the first Romans chose. Fabricius from their walls repelled the foe, Whose noble hands had exercised the plough. From hence, my lord, and love, I thus conclude, That, though my homely ancestors were rude, Mean as I am, yet I may have the grace To make you father of a generous race. And noble then am I, when I begin, In virtue clothed, to cast the rags of sin. If poverty be my upbraided crime, And you believe in heaven, there was a time When He, the great controller of our fate, Deigned to be man, and lived in low estate; Which he who had the world at his dispose, If poverty were vice, would never choose. Philosophers have said, and poets sing, That a glad poverty's an honest thing; Content is wealth, the riches of the mind, And happy he who can that treasure find; But the base miser starves amidst his store, Broods on his gold, and, griping still at more, Sits sadly pining, and believes he's poor; The ragged beggar, though he wants relief, Has not to lose, and sings before the thief. Want is a bitter and a hateful good, Because its virtues are not understood. Yet many things, impossible to thought, Have been, by need, to full perfection brought: The daring of the soul proceeds from thence, Sharpness of wit, and active diligence; Prudence at once, and fortitude, it gives, And, if in patience taken, mends our lives; For even that indigence, that brings me low, Makes me myself, and him above, to know; A good which none would challenge, few would choose, A fair possession, which mankind refuse. If we from wealth to poverty descend, Want gives to know the flatterer from the friend. If I am old and ugly, well for you, No lewd adulterer will my love pursue; Nor jealousy, the bane of married life, Shall haunt you for a withered homely wife; For age and ugliness, as all agree, Are the best guards of female chastity. “Yet since I see your mind is worldly bent, I'll do my best to further your content; And therefore of two gifts in my dispose,— Think ere you speak,—I grant you leave to choose: Would you I should be still deformed and old, Nauseous to touch, and loathsome to behold; On this condition, to remain for life A careful, tender, and obedient wife, In all I can contribute to your ease, And not in deed, or word, or thought displease? Or would you rather have me young and fair, And take the chance that happens to your share? Temptations are in beauty, and in youth, And how can you depend upon my truth? Now weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss, And thank yourself, if aught should fall amiss.” Sore sighed the knight, who this long sermon heard; At length considering all, his heart he cheered, And thus replied:—“My lady, and my wife, To your wise conduct I resign my life: Choose you for me, for well you understand The future good and ill, on either hand: But if an humble husband may request, Provide, and order all things for the best; Yours be the care to profit, and to please, And let your subject-servant take his ease.” “Then thus in peace,” quoth she, “concludes the strife, Since I am turned the husband, you the wife: The matrimonial victory is mine, Which, having fairly gained, I will resign; Forgive, if I have said or done amiss, And seal the bargain with a friendly kiss. I promised you but one content to share, But now I will become both good and fair. No nuptial quarrel shall disturb your ease; The business of my life shall be to please: And for my beauty, that, as time shall try; But draw the curtain first, and cast your eye.” He looked, and saw a creature heavenly fair, In bloom of youth, and of a charming air. With joy he turned, and seized her ivory arm; And, like Pygmalion, found the statue warm. Small arguments there needed to prevail, A storm of kisses poured as thick as hail. Thus long in mutual bliss they lay embraced, And their first love continued to the last; One sunshine was their life, no cloud between, Nor ever was a kinder couple seen. And so may all our lives like theirs be led; Heaven send the maids young husbands fresh in bed! May widows wed as often as they can, And ever for the better change their man. And some devouring plague pursue their lives, Who will not well be governed by their wives. THE CHARACTER OF A GOOD PARSON. A parish priest was of the pilgrim train; An awful, reverend, and religious man. His eyes diffused a venerable grace, And charity itself was in his face. Rich was his soul, though his attire was poor, (As God had clothed his own ambassador;) For such on earth his blessed Redeemer bore. Of sixty years he seemed, and well might last To sixty more, but that he lived too fast; Refined himself to soul, to curb the sense, And made almost a sin of abstinence. Yet had his aspect nothing of severe, But such a face as promised him sincere; Nothing reserved or sullen was to see, But sweet regards, and pleasing sanctity; Mild was his accent, and his action free. With eloquence innate his tongue was armed, Though harsh the precept, yet the preacher charmed. For, letting down the golden chain from high, He drew his audience upward to the sky; And oft, with holy hymns, he charmed their ears, (A music more melodious than the spheres,) For David left him, when he went to rest, His lyre; and after him he sung the best. He bore his great commission in his look, But sweetly tempered awe, and softened all he spoke. He preached the joys of heaven, and pains of hell, And warned the sinner with becoming zeal; But on eternal mercy loved to dwell. He taught the gospel rather than the law, And forced himself to drive, but loved to draw. For fear but freezes minds; but love, like heat, Exhales the soul sublime, to seek her native seat. To threats the stubborn sinner oft is hard, Wrapped in his crimes, against the storm prepared; But when the milder beams of mercy play, He melts, and throws his cumbrous cloak away. Lightnings and thunder, (heaven's artillery,) As harbingers before the Almighty fly: Those but proclaim his style, and disappear; The stiller sound succeeds, and God is there. The tithes his parish freely paid, he took, But never sued, or cursed with bell and book; With patience bearing wrong, but offering none, Since every man is free to lose his own. The country churls, according to their kind, (Who grudge their dues, and love to be behind,) The less he sought his offerings, pinched the more, And praised a priest contented to be poor. Yet of his little he had some to spare, To feed the famished, and to clothe the bare; For mortified he was to that degree, A poorer than himself he would not see. True priests, he said, and preachers of the word, Were only stewards of their sovereign Lord; Nothing was theirs, but all the public store; Intrusted riches, to relieve the poor; Who, should they steal, for want of his relief, He judged himself accomplice with the thief. Wide was his parish; not contracted close In streets, but here and there a straggling house; Yet still he was at hand, without request, To serve the sick, to succour the distressed; Tempting on foot alone, without affright, The dangers of a dark tempestuous night. All this the good old man performed alone, Nor spared his pains; for curate he had none. Nor durst he trust another with his care; Nor rode himself to Paul's, the public fair, To chaffer for preferment with his gold, Where bishoprics and sinecures are sold; But duly watched his flock by night and day, And from the prowling wolf redeemed the prey, And hungry sent the wily fox away. The proud he tamed, the penitent he cheered; Nor to rebuke the rich offender feared. His preaching much, but more his practice wrought; (A living sermon of the truths he taught;) For this by rules severe his life he squared, That all might see the doctrine which they heard. For priests, he said, are patterns for the rest; (The gold of heaven, who bear the God impressed;) But when the precious coin is kept unclean, The Sovereign's image is no longer seen. If they be foul on whom the people trust, Well may the baser brass contract a rust. The prelate, for his holy life he prized; The worldly pomp of prelacy despised; His Saviour came not with a gaudy show, Nor was his kingdom of the world below. Patience in want, and poverty of mind, These marks of church and churchmen he designed, And living taught, and dying left behind. The crown he wore was of the pointed thorn; In purple he was crucified, not born. They, who contend for place and high degree, Are not his sons, but those of Zebedee. Not but he knew the signs of earthly power Might well become Saint Peter's successor; The Holy Father holds a double reign, The prince may keep his pomp, the fisher must be plain. Such was the saint, who shone with every grace, Reflecting, Moses-like, his Maker's face. God saw his image lively was expressed; And his own work, as in creation, blessed. The tempter saw him too with envious eye, And, as on Job, demanded leave to try. He took the time when Richard was deposed, And high and low with happy Harry closed. This prince, though great in arms, the priest withstood: Near though he was, yet not the next of blood. Had Richard, unconstrained, resigned the throne, A king can give no more than is his own: The title stood entailed, had Richard had a son. Conquest, an odious name, was laid aside; Where all submitted, none the battle tried. The senseless plea of right by Providence Was, by a flattering priest, invented since; And lasts no longer than the present sway, But justifies the next who comes in play. The people's right remains; let those who dare Dispute their power, when they the judges are. He joined not in their choice, because he knew Worse might, and often did, from change ensue. Much to himself he thought, but little spoke; And, undeprived, his benefice forsook. Now, through the land, his cure of souls he stretched, And like a primitive apostle preached. Still cheerful; ever constant to his call; By many followed; loved by most, admired by all. With what he begged, his brethren he relieved, And gave the charities himself received; Gave, while he taught; and edified the more, Because he showed, by proof, 'twas easy to be poor. He went not, with the crowd, to see a shrine; But fed us, by the way, with food divine. In deference to his virtues, I forbear To show you what the rest in orders were: This brilliant is so spotless, and so bright, He needs no foil, but shines by his own proper light. TRANSLATIONS FROM BOCCACE. SIGISMONDA AND GUISCARDO. While Norman Tancred in Salerno reigned, The title of a gracious prince he gained; Till turned a tyrant in his latter days, He lost the lustre of his former praise, And, from the bright meridian where he stood Descending, dipped his hands in lovers' blood. This prince, of fortune's favour long possessed, Yet was with one fair daughter only blessed; And blessed he might have been with her alone, But oh! how much more happy had he none! She was his care, his hope, and his delight, Most in his thought, and ever in his sight: Next, nay beyond his life, he held her dear; She lived by him, and now he lived in her. For this, when ripe for marriage, he delayed Her nuptial bands, and kept her long a maid, As envying any else should share a part Of what was his, and claiming all her heart. At length, as public decency required, And all his vassals eagerly desired, With mind averse, he rather underwent His people's will, than gave his own consent. So was she torn as from a lover's side, And made, almost in his despite, a bride. Short were her marriage joys; for in the prime Of youth, her lord expired before his time; And to her father's court in little space Restored anew, she held a higher place; More loved, and more exalted into grace. This princess, fresh and young, and fair and wise, The worshipped idol of her father's eyes, Did all her sex in every grace exceed, And had more wit beside than women need. Youth, health, and ease, and most an amorous mind, To second nuptials had her thoughts inclined, And former joys had left a secret sting behind. But, prodigal in every other grant, Her sire left unsupplied her only want; And she, betwixt her modesty and pride, Her wishes, which she could not help, would hide. Resolved at last to lose no longer time, And yet to please herself without a crime, She cast her eyes around the court, to find A worthy subject suiting to her mind, To him in holy nuptials to be tied, A seeming widow, and a secret bride. Among the train of courtiers, one she found With all the gifts of bounteous nature crowned; Of gentle blood, but one whose niggard fate Had set him far below her high estate: Guiscard his name was called, of blooming age, Now squire to Tancred, and before his page: To him, the choice of all the shining crowd, Her heart the noble Sigismonda vowed. Yet hitherto she kept her love concealed, And with close glances every day beheld The graceful youth; and every day increased The raging fire that burned within her breast: Some secret charm did all his acts attend, And what his fortune wanted, hers could mend; Till, as the fire will force its outward way, Or, in the prison pent, consume the prey, So long her earnest eyes on his were set, At length their twisted rays together met; And he, surprised with humble joy, surveyed One sweet regard, shot by the royal maid. Not well assured, while doubtful hopes he nursed, A second glance came gliding like the first; And he, who saw the sharpness of the dart, Without defence received it in his heart. In public, though their passion wanted speech, Yet mutual looks interpreted for each: Time, ways, and means of meeting, were denied; But all those wants ingenious love supplied. The inventive God, who never fails his part, Inspires the wit, when once he warms the heart. When Guiscard next was in the circle seen, Where Sigismonda held the place of queen, A hollow cane within her hand she brought, But in the concave had inclosed a note; With this she seemed to play, and, as in sport, Tossed to her love, in presence of the court: “Take it,” she said; “and when your needs require, This little brand will serve to light your fire.” He took it with a bow, and soon divined The seeming toy was not for nought designed: But when retired, so long with curious eyes He viewed the present, that he found the prize. Much was in little writ; and all conveyed With cautious care, for fear to be betrayed By some false confidant, or favourite maid. The time, the place, the manner how to meet, Were all in punctual order plainly writ: But since a trust must be, she thought it best To put it out of laymen's power at least, And for their solemn vows prepared a priest. Guiscard (her secret purpose understood) With joy prepared to meet the coming good; Nor pains nor danger was resolved to spare, But use the means appointed by the fair. Near the proud palace of Salerno stood A mount of rough ascent, and thick with wood; Through this a cave was dug with vast expense, The work it seemed of some suspicious prince, Who, when abusing power with lawless might, From public justice would secure his flight. The passage made by many a winding way, Reached even the room in which the tyrant lay. Fit for his purpose, on a lower floor He lodged, whose issue was an iron door; From whence, by stairs descending to the ground, In the blind grot a safe retreat he found. Its outlet ended in a brake o'ergrown With brambles, choked by time, and now unknown. A rift there was, which from the mountain's height Conveyed a glimmering and malignant light, A breathing-place to draw the damps away, A twilight of an intercepted day. The tyrant's den, whose use, though lost to fame, Was now the apartment of the royal dame; The cavern, only to her father known, By him was to his darling daughter shown. Neglected long she let the secret rest, Till love recalled it to her labouring breast, And hinted as the way by heaven designed, The teacher, by the means he taught, to blind. What will not women do, when need inspires Their wit, or love their inclination fires! Though jealousy of state the invention found, Yet love refined upon the former ground. That way, the tyrant had reserved to fly Pursuing hate, now served to bring two lovers nigh. The dame, who long in vain had kept the key, Bold by desire, explored the secret way; Now tried the stairs, and wading through the night, Searched all the deep recess, and issued into light. All this her letter had so well explained, The instructed youth might compass what remained; The cavern mouth alone was hard to find, Because the path, disused, was out of mind: But in what quarter of the copse it lay, His eye by certain level could survey: Yet (for the wood perplexed with thorns he knew) A frock of leather o'er his limbs he drew; And, thus provided, searched the brake around, Till the choked entry of the cave he found. Thus, all prepared, the promised hour arrived, So long expected, and so well contrived: With love to friend, the impatient lover went, Fenced from the thorns, and trod the deep descent. The conscious priest, who was suborned before, Stood ready posted at the postern door; The maids in distant rooms were sent to rest, And nothing wanted but the invited guest. He came, and, knocking thrice without delay, The longing lady heard, and turned the key; At once invaded him with all her charms, And the first step he made was in her arms: The leathern outside, boisterous as it was, Gave way, and bent beneath her strict embrace: On either side the kisses flew so thick, That neither he nor she had breath to speak. The holy man, amazed at what he saw, Made haste to sanctify the bliss by law; And muttered fast the matrimony o'er, For fear committed sin should get before. His work performed, he left the pair alone, Because he knew he could not go too soon; His presence odious, when his task was done. What thoughts he had beseems not me to say; Though some surmise he went to fast and pray, And needed both to drive the tempting thoughts away. The foe once gone, they took their full delight; 'Twas restless rage, and tempest all the night; For greedy love each moment would employ, And grudged the shortest pauses of their joy. Thus were their loves auspiciously begun, And thus with secret care were carried on. The stealth itself did appetite restore, And looked so like a sin, it pleased the more. The cave was now become a common way, The wicket, often opened, knew the key: Love rioted secure, and, long enjoyed, Was ever eager, and was never cloyed. But as extremes are short, of ill and good, And tides at highest mark regorge the flood; So fate, that could no more improve their joy, Took a malicious pleasure to destroy. Tancred, who fondly loved, and whose delight Was placed in his fair daughter's daily sight, Of custom, when his state affairs were done, Would pass his pleasing hours with her alone; And, as a father's privilege allowed, Without attendance of the officious crowd. It happened once, that when in heat of day He tried to sleep, as was his usual way, The balmy slumber fled his wakeful eyes, And forced him, in his own despite, to rise: Of sleep forsaken, to relieve his care, He sought the conversation of the fair; But with her train of damsels she was gone, In shady walks the scorching heat to shun: He would not violate that sweet recess, And found besides a welcome heaviness, That seized his eyes; and slumber, which forgot When called before to come, now came unsought. From light retired, behind his daughter's bed, He for approaching sleep composed his head; A chair was ready, for that use designed, So quilted, that he lay at ease reclined; The curtains closely drawn, the light to screen, As if he had contrived to lie unseen: Thus covered with an artificial night, Sleep did his office soon, and sealed his sight. With heaven averse, in this ill-omened hour, Was Guiscard summoned to the secret bower, And the fair nymph, with expectation fired, From her attending damsels was retired: For, true to love, she measured time so right, As not to miss one moment of delight. The garden, seated on the level floor, She left behind, and locking every door, Thought all secure; but little did she know, Blind to her fate, she had inclosed her foe. Attending Guiscard, in his leathern frock, Stood ready, with his thrice-repeated knock: Thrice with a doleful sound the jarring grate Rung deaf and hollow, and presaged their fate. The door unlocked, to known delight they haste, And panting, in each other's arms embraced, Rush to the conscious bed, a mutual freight, And heedless press it with their wonted weight. The sudden bound awaked the sleeping sire, And showed a sight no parent can desire; His opening eyes at once with odious view The love discovered, and the lover knew: He would have cried; but hoping that he dreamt, Amazement tied his tongue, and stopped the attempt. The ensuing moment all the truth declared, But now he stood collected, and prepared; For malice and revenge had put him on his guard. So, like a lion that unheeded lay, Dissembling sleep, and watchful to betray, With inward rage he meditates his prey. The thoughtless pair, indulging their desires, Alternate kindled, and then quenched their fires; Nor thinking in the shades of death they played, Full of themselves, themselves alone surveyed, And, too secure, were by themselves betrayed. Long time dissolved in pleasure thus they lay, Till nature could no more suffice their play; Then rose the youth, and, through the cave again Returned: the princess mingled with her train. Resolved his unripe vengeance to defer, The royal spy, when now the coast was clear, Sought not the garden, but retired unseen, To brood in secret on his gathered spleen, And methodise revenge: to death he grieved; And, but he saw the crime, had scarce believed. The appointment for the ensuing night he heard, And therefore in the cavern had prepared Two brawny yeomen of his trusty guard. Scarce had unwary Guiscard set his foot Within the farmost entrance of the grot, When these in secret ambush ready lay, And rushing on the sudden seized the prey: Encumbered with his frock, without defence, An easy prize, they led the prisoner thence, And, as commanded, brought before the prince. The gloomy sire, too sensible of wrong To vent his rage in words, restrained his tongue, And only said, “Thus servants are preferred, And, trusted, thus their sovereigns they reward. Had I not seen, had not these eyes received Too clear a proof, I could not have believed.” He paused, and choked the rest. The youth, who saw His forfeit life abandoned to the law, The judge the accuser, and the offence to him Who had both power and will to avenge the crime, No vain defence prepared; but thus replied:— “The faults of love by love are justified: With unresisted might the monarch reigns, He levels mountains, and he raises plains; And not regarding difference of degree, Abased your daughter, and exalted me.” This bold return with seeming patience heard, The prisoner was remitted to the guard. The sullen tyrant slept not all the night, But lonely walking by a winking light, Sobbed, wept, and groaned, and beat his withered breast, But would not violate his daughter's rest; Who long expecting lay, for bliss prepared, List'ning for noise, and grieved that none she heard; Oft rose, and oft in vain employed the key, And oft accused her lover of delay, And passed the tedious hours in anxious thoughts away. The morrow came; and at his usual hour Old Tancred visited his daughter's bower; Her cheek (for such his custom was) he kissed, Then blessed her kneeling, and her maids dismissed. The royal dignity thus far maintained, Now left in private, he no longer feigned; But all at once his grief and rage appeared, And floods of tears ran trickling down his beard. “O Sigismonda,”—he began to say: Thrice he began, and thrice was forced to stay, Till words with often trying found their way;— “I thought, O Sigismonda, (but how blind Are parents' eyes their children's faults to find!) Thy virtue, birth, and breeding, were above A mean desire, and vulgar sense of love; Nor less than sight and hearing could convince So fond a father, and so just a prince, Of such an unforeseen and unbelieved offence. Then what indignant sorrow must I have, To see thee lie subjected to my slave! A man so smelling of the people's lee, The court received him first for charity; And since with no degree of honour graced, But only suffered, where he first was placed. A grovelling insect still; and so designed By nature's hand, nor born of noble kind: A thing, by neither man nor woman prized, And scarcely known enough to be despised. To what has heaven reserved my age? Ah! why Should man, when nature calls, not choose to die, Rather than stretch the span of life, to find Such ills as fate has wisely cast behind, For those to feel, whom fond desire to live Makes covetous of more than life can give! Each has his share of good; and when 'tis gone, The guest, though hungry, cannot rise too soon. But I, expecting more, in my own wrong Protracting life, have lived a day too long. If yesterday could be recalled again, Even now would I conclude my happy reign; But 'tis too late, my glorious race is run, And a dark cloud o'ertakes my setting sun. Hadst thou not loved, or, loving, saved the shame, If not the sin, by some illustrious name, This little comfort had relieved my mind, 'Twas frailty, not unusual to thy kind: But thy low fall beneath thy royal blood, Shows downward appetite to mix with mud. Thus not the least excuse is left for thee, Nor the least refuge for unhappy me. “For him I have resolved; whom by surprise I took, and scarce can tell it, in disguise; For such was his attire, as, with intent Of nature, suited to his mean descent: The harder question yet remains behind, What pains a parent and a prince can find To punish an offence of this degenerate kind. “As I have loved, and yet I love thee more Than ever father loved a child before, So that indulgence draws me to forgive: Nature, that gave thee life, would have thee live. But, as a public parent of the State, My justice, and thy crime, requires thy fate. Fain would I choose a middle course to steer; Nature's too kind, and justice too severe: Speak for us both, and to the balance bring On either side the father and the king. Heaven knows, my heart is bent to favour thee; Make it but scanty weight, and leave the rest to me.” Here stopping with a sigh, he poured a flood Of tears, to make his last expression good. She, who had heard him speak, nor saw alone The secret conduct of her love was known, But he was taken who her soul possessed, Felt all the pangs of sorrow in her breast: And little wanted, but a woman's heart, With cries and tears, had testified her smart: But inborn worth, that fortune can control, New-strung, and stiffer bent her softer soul; The heroine assumed the woman's place, Confirmed her mind, and fortified her face: Why should she beg, or what could she pretend, When her stern father had condemned her friend! Her life she might have had; but her despair Of saving his, had put it past her care: Resolved on fate, she would not lose her breath, But, rather than not die, solicit death. Fixed on this thought, she, not as women use, Her fault by common frailty would excuse; But boldly justified her innocence, And while the fact was owned, denied the offence: Then with dry eyes, and with an open look, She met his glance midway, and thus undaunted spoke:— “Tancred, I neither am disposed to make Request for life, nor offered life to take; Much less deny the deed; but least of all Beneath pretended justice weakly fall. My words to sacred truth shall be confined, My deeds shall show the greatness of my mind. That I have loved, I own; that still I love, I call to witness all the powers above: Yet more I own; to Guiscard's love I give The small remaining time I have to live; And if beyond this life desire can be, Not fate itself shall set my passion free. This first avowed; nor folly warped my mind, Nor the frail texture of the female kind Betrayed my virtue; for, too well I knew What honour was, and honour had his due: Before the holy priest my vows were tied, So came I not a strumpet, but a bride. This for my fame, and for the public voice; Yet more, his merits justified my choice: Which had they not, the first election thine, That bond dissolved, the next is freely mine: Or grant I erred, (which yet I must deny,) Had parents power even second vows to tie, Thy little care to mend my widowed nights Has forced me to recourse of marriage-rites, To fill an empty side, and follow known delights. What have I done in this, deserving blame? State-laws may alter; nature's are the same; Those are usurped on helpless womankind, Made without our consent, and wanting power to bind. “Thou, Tancred, better shouldst have understood, That, as thy father gave thee flesh and blood, So gavest thou me: not from the quarry hewed, But of a softer mould, with sense endued; Even softer than thy own, of suppler kind, More exquisite of taste, and more than man refined. Nor need'st thou by thy daughter to be told, Though now thy sprightly blood with age be cold, Thou hast been young; and canst remember still, That when thou hadst the power, thou hadst the will; And from the past experience of thy fires, Canst tell with what a tide our strong desires Come rushing on in youth, and what their rage requires. “And grant thy youth was exercised in arms, When love no leisure found for softer charms, My tender age in luxury was trained, With idle ease and pageants entertained; My hours my own, my pleasures unrestrained. So bred, no wonder if I took the bent That seemed even warranted by thy consent; For when the father is too fondly kind, Such seed he sows, such harvest shall he find. Blame then thyself, as reason's law requires, (Since nature gave, and thou foment'st my fires;) If still those appetites continue strong, Thou may'st consider I am yet but young. Consider too, that, having been a wife, I must have tasted of a better life; And am not to be blamed, if I renew, By lawful means, the joys which then I knew. Where was the crime, if pleasure I procured; Young, and a woman, and to bliss inured? That was my case, and this is my defence:— I pleased myself, I shunned incontinence, And, urged by strong desires, indulged my sense. “Left to myself, I must avow, I strove From public shame to screen my secret love, And, well acquainted with thy native pride, Endeavoured what I could not help, to hide; For which a woman's wit an easy way supplied. How this, so well contrived, so closely laid, Was known to thee, or by what chance betrayed, Is not my care; to please thy pride alone, I could have wished it had been still unknown. “Nor took I Guiscard by blind fancy led, Or hasty choice, as many women wed; But with deliberate care, and ripened thought, At leisure first designed, before I wrought. On him I rested, after long debate, And, not without considering, fixed my fate. His flame was equal, though by mine inspired; (For so the difference of our birth required:) Had he been born like me, like me his love Had first begun what mine was forced to move: But thus beginning, thus we persevere; Our passions yet continue what they were, Nor length of trial makes our joys the less sincere. “At this my choice, though not by thine allowed, (Thy judgment herding with the common crowd,) Thou tak'st unjust offence; and, led by them, Dost less the merit than the man esteem. Too sharply, Tancred, by thy pride betrayed, Hast thou against the laws of kind inveighed; For all the offence is in opinion placed, Which deems high birth by lowly choice debased. This thought alone with fury fires thy breast, (For holy marriage justifies the rest,) That I have sunk the glories of the State, And mixed my blood with a plebeian mate: In which I wonder thou shouldst oversee Superior causes, or impute to me The fault of fortune, or the Fate's decree. Or call it heaven's imperial power alone, Which moves on springs of justice, though unknown; Yet this we see, though ordered for the best, The bad exalted, and the good oppressed; Permitted laurels grace the lawless brow; The unworthy raised, the worthy cast below. “But leaving that: search we the secret springs, And backward trace the principles of things; There shall we find, that, when the world began, One common mass composed the mould of man; One paste of flesh on all degrees bestowed, And kneaded up alike with moistening blood. The same Almighty Power inspired the frame With kindled life, and formed the souls the same: The faculties of intellect and will Dispensed with equal hand, disposed with equal skill, Like liberty indulged, with choice of good or ill. Thus born alike, from virtue first began The difference that distinguished man from man: He claimed no title from descent of blood, But that which made him noble made him good. Warmed with more particles of heavenly flame, He winged his upward flight, and soared to fame; The rest remained below, a tribe without a name. “This law, though custom now diverts the course, As nature's institute, is yet in force; Uncancelled, though disused: and he, whose mind Is virtuous, is alone of noble kind; Though poor in fortune, of celestial race; And he commits the crime, who calls him base. “Now lay the line, and measure all thy court By inward virtue, not external port, And find whom justly to prefer above The man on whom my judgment placed my love; So shalt thou see his parts and person shine, And, thus compared, the rest a base degenerate line. Nor took I, when I first surveyed thy court, His valour or his virtues on report; But trusted what I ought to trust alone, Relying on thy eyes, and not my own; Thy praise (and thine was then the public voice) First recommended Guiscard to my choice: Directed thus by thee, I looked, and found A man I thought deserving to be crowned; First by my father pointed to my sight, Nor less conspicuous by his native light; His mind, his mien, the features of his face, Excelling all the rest of human race: These were thy thoughts, and thou couldst judge aright, Till interest made a jaundice in thy sight. Or should I grant thou didst not rightly see, Then thou wert first deceived, and I deceived by thee. But if thou shalt allege, through pride of mind, Thy blood with one of base condition joined, 'Tis false; for 'tis not baseness to be poor: His poverty augments thy crime the more; Upbraids thy justice with the scant regard Of worth; whom princes praise, they should reward. Are these the kings intrusted by the crowd With wealth, to be dispensed for common good? The people sweat not for their king's delight, To enrich a pimp, or raise a parasite; Theirs is the toil; and he, who well has served His country, has his country's wealth deserved. Even mighty monarchs oft are meanly born, And kings by birth to lowest rank return; All subject to the power of giddy chance, For fortune can depress, or can advance: But true nobility is of the mind, Not given by chance, and not to chance resigned. “For the remaining doubt of thy decree, What to resolve, and how dispose of me; Be warned to cast that useless care aside, Myself alone will for myself provide. If in thy doting and decrepit age, Thy soul, a stranger in thy youth to rage, Begins in cruel deeds to take delight, Gorge with my blood thy barbarous appetite; For I so little am disposed to pray For life, I would not cast a wish away. Such as it is, the offence is all my own; And what to Guiscard is already done, Or to be done, is doomed by thy decree, That, if not executed first by thee, Shall on my person be performed by me. “Away! with women weep, and leave me here, Fixed, like a man, to die without a tear; Or save, or slay us both this present hour, 'Tis all that fate has left within thy power.” She said; nor did her father fail to find, In all she spoke, the greatness of her mind; Yet thought she was not obstinate to die, Nor deemed the death she promised was so nigh. Secure in this belief, he left the dame, Resolved to spare her life, and save her shame; But that detested object to remove, To wreak his vengeance, and to cure her love. Intent on this, a secret order signed The death of Guiscard to his guards enjoined; Strangling was chosen, and the night the time; A mute revenge, and blind as was the crime. His faithful heart, a bloody sacrifice, Torn from his breast, to glut the tyrant's eyes, Closed the severe command; for (slaves to pay) What kings decree, the soldier must obey: Waged against foes; and when the wars are o'er, Fit only to maintain despotic power; Dangerous to freedom, and desired alone By kings, who seek an arbitrary throne. Such were these guards; as ready to have slain The prince himself, allured with greater gain: So was the charge performed with better will, By men inured to blood, and exercised in ill. Now, though the sullen sire had eased his mind, The pomp of his revenge was yet behind, A pomp prepared to grace the present he designed. A goblet rich with gems, and rough with gold, Of depth and breadth the precious pledge to hold, With cruel care he chose; the hollow part Inclosed, the lid concealed the lover's heart. Then of his trusted mischiefs one he sent, And bade him, with these words, the gift present: “Thy father sends thee this to cheer thy breast, And glad thy sight with what thou lov'st the best; As thou hast pleased his eyes, and joyed his mind, With what he loved the most of humankind.” Ere this, the royal dame, who well had weighed The consequence of what her sire had said, Fixed on her fate, against the expected hour, Procured the means to have it in her power: For this, she had distilled, with early care, The juice of simples, friendly to despair, A magazine of death; and thus prepared, Secure to die, the fatal message heard: Then smiled severe; nor with a troubled look, Or trembling hand, the funeral present took; Even kept her countenance, when the lid removed Disclosed the heart, unfortunately loved. She needed not be told, within whose breast It lodged; the message had explained the rest. Or not amazed, or hiding her surprise, She sternly on the bearer fixed her eyes; Then thus: “Tell Tancred, on his daughter's part, The gold, though precious, equals not the heart: But he did well to give his best; and I, Who wished a worthier urn, forgive his poverty.” At this she curbed a groan, that else had come, And, pausing, viewed the present in the tomb; Then to the heart, adored devoutly, glued Her lips, and, raising it, her speech renewed:— “Even from my day of birth to this, the bound Of my unhappy being, I have found My father's care and tenderness expressed; But this last act of love excels the rest: For this so dear a present, bear him back The best return that I can live to make.” The messenger despatched, again she viewed The loved remains, and, sighing, thus pursued: “Source of my life, and lord of my desires, In whom I lived, with whom my soul expires! Poor heart! no more the spring of vital heat; Cursed be the hands that tore thee from thy seat! The course is finished which thy fates decreed, And thou from thy corporeal prison freed: Soon hast thou reached the goal with mended pace; A world of woes despatched in little space. Forced by thy worth, thy foe, in death become Thy friend, has lodged thee in a costly tomb. There yet remained thy funeral exequies, The weeping tribute of thy widow's eyes; And those indulgent heaven has found the way, That I, before my death, have leave to pay. My father even in cruelty is kind, Or heaven has turned the malice of his mind To better uses than his hate designed; And made the insult, which in his gift appears, The means to mourn thee with my pious tears; Which I will pay thee down before I go, And save myself the pains to weep below, If souls can weep. Though once I meant to meet My fate with face unmoved, and eyes unwet, Yet, since I have thee here in narrow room, My tears shall set thee first afloat within thy tomb, Then (as I know thy spirit hovers nigh) Under thy friendly conduct will I fly To regions unexplored, secure to share Thy state; nor hell shall punishment appear; And heaven is double heaven, if thou art there.” She said: Her brimful eyes, that ready stood, And only wanted will to weep a flood, Released their watery store, and poured amain, Like clouds low-hung, a sober shower of rain; Mute, solemn sorrow, free from female noise, Such as the majesty of grief destroys; For, bending o'er the cup, the tears she shed Seemed by the posture to discharge her head, O'er-filled before; and (oft her mouth applied To the cold heart) she kissed at once, and cried. Her maids, who stood amazed, nor knew the cause Of her complaining, nor whose heart it was, Yet all due measures of her mourning kept, Did office at the dirge, and by infection wept, And oft inquired the occasion of her grief, (Unanswered but by sighs,) and offered vain relief. At length, her stock of tears already shed, She wiped her eyes, she raised her drooping head, And thus pursued: “O ever-faithful heart, I have performed the ceremonial part, The decencies of grief; it rests behind, That, as our bodies were, our souls be joined; To thy whate'er abode my shade convey, And, as an elder ghost, direct the way!” She said; and bade the vial to be brought, Where she before had brewed the deadly draught; First pouring out the med'cinable bane, The heart, her tears had rinsed, she bathed again; Then down her throat the death securely throws, And quaffs a long oblivion of her woes. This done, she mounts the genial bed, and there (Her body first composed with honest care) Attends the welcome rest; her hands yet hold, Close to her heart, the monumental gold; Nor further word she spoke, but closed her sight, And quiet sought the covert of the night. The damsels, who the while in silence mourned, Not knowing, nor suspecting death suborned, Yet, as their duty was, to Tancred sent, Who, conscious of the occasion, feared the event. Alarmed, and with presaging heart, he came, And drew the curtains, and exposed the dame To loathsome light; then, with a late relief, Made vain efforts to mitigate her grief. She, what she could, excluding day, her eyes Kept firmly sealed, and sternly thus replies:— “Tancred, restrain thy tears, unsought by me, And sorrow unavailing now to thee: Did ever man before afflict his mind, To see the effect of what himself designed? Yet if thou hast remaining in thy heart Some sense of love, some unextinguished part Of former kindness, largely once professed, Let me by that adjure thy hardened breast, Not to deny thy daughter's last request: The secret love which I so long enjoyed, And still concealed, to gratify thy pride, Thou hast disjoined; but, with my dying breath, Seek not, I beg thee, to disjoin our death: Where'er his corpse by thy command is laid, Thither let mine in public be conveyed; Exposed in open view, and side by side, Acknowledged as a bridegroom and a bride.” The prince's anguish hindered his reply; And she, who felt her fate approaching nigh, Seized the cold heart, and heaving to her breast,— “Here, precious pledge,” she said, “securely rest.” These accents were her last; the creeping death Benumbed her senses first, then stopped her breath. Thus she for disobedience justly died; The sire was justly punished for his pride; The youth, least guilty, suffered for the offence, Of duty violated to his prince; Who, late repenting of his cruel deed, One common sepulchre for both decreed; Entombed the wretched pair in royal state, And on their monument inscribed their fate. THEODORE AND HONORIA. Of all the cities in Romanian lands, The chief, and most renowned, Ravenna stands; Adorned in ancient times with arms and arts, And rich inhabitants, with generous hearts. But Theodore the brave, above the rest, With gifts of fortune and of nature blessed, The foremost place for wealth and honour held, And in the feats of chivalry excelled. This noble youth to madness loved a dame, Of high degree, Honoria was her name; Fair as the fairest, but of haughty mind, And fiercer than became so soft a kind: Proud of her birth, (for equal she had none;) The rest she scorned, but hated him alone. His gifts, his constant courtship, nothing gained; For she, the more he loved, the more disdained. He lived with all the pomp he could devise, At tilts and tournaments obtained the prize, But found no favour in his lady's eyes: Relentless as a rock, the lofty maid Turned all to poison that he did or said; Nor prayers, nor tears, nor offered vows, could move; The work went backward; and the more he strove To advance his suit, the further from her love. Wearied at length, and wanting remedy, He doubted oft, and oft resolved to die. But pride stood ready to prevent the blow, For who would die to gratify a foe? His generous mind disdained so mean a fate; That passed, his next endeavour was to hate. But vainer that relief than all the rest; The less he hoped, with more desire possessed; Love stood the siege, and would not yield his breast. Change was the next, but change deceived his care; He sought a fairer, but found none so fair. He would have worn her out by slow degrees, As men by fasting starve the untamed disease; But present love required a present ease. Looking, he feeds alone his famished eyes, Feeds lingering death; but, looking not, he dies. Yet still he chose the longest way to fate, Wasting at once his life, and his estate. His friends beheld, and pitied him in vain, For what advice can ease a lover's pain! Absence, the best expedient they could find, Might save the fortune, if not cure the mind: This means they long proposed, but little gained, Yet after much pursuit, at length obtained. Hard you may think it was to give consent, But, struggling with his own desires, he went; With large expense, and with a pompous train, Provided as to visit France or Spain, Or for some distant voyage o'er the main. But love had clipped his wings, and cut him short, Confined within the purlieus of his court. Three miles he went, nor further could retreat; His travels ended at his country-seat: To Chassi's pleasing plains he took his way, There pitched his tents, and there resolved to stay. The spring was in the prime; the neighbouring grove Supplied by birds, the choristers of love; Music unbought, that ministered delight To morning walks, and lulled his cares by night: There he discharged his friends; but not the expense Of frequent treats, and proud magnificence. He lived as kings retire, though more at large From public business, yet with equal charge; With house and heart still open to receive; As well content as love would give him leave: He would have lived more free; but many a guest, Who could forsake the friend, pursued the feast. It happ'd one morning, as his fancy led, Before his usual hour he left his bed, To walk within a lonely lawn, that stood On every side surrounded by the wood: Alone he walked, to please his pensive mind, And sought the deepest solitude to find: 'Twas in a grove of spreading pines he strayed; The winds within the quivering branches played, And dancing trees a mournful music made. The place itself was suiting to his care, Uncouth and savage, as the cruel fair. He wandered on, unknowing where he went, Lost in the wood, and all on love intent: The day already half his race had run, And summoned him to due repast at noon, But love could feel no hunger but his own. While listening to the murmuring leaves he stood, More than a mile immersed within the wood, At once the wind was laid; the whispering sound Was dumb; a rising earthquake rocked the ground; With deeper brown the grove was overspread, A sudden horror seized his giddy head, And his ears tinkled, and his colour fled. Nature was in alarm; some danger nigh Seemed threatened, though unseen to mortal eye. Unused to fear, he summoned all his soul, And stood collected in himself, and whole: Not long; for soon a whirlwind rose around, And from afar he heard a screaming sound, As of a dame distressed, who cried for aid, And filled with loud laments the secret shade. A thicket close beside the grove there stood, With breres and brambles choked, and dwarfish wood: From thence the noise, which now approaching near, With more distinguished notes invades his ear; He raised his head, and saw a beauteous maid, With hair dishevelled, issuing through the shade; Stripped of her clothes, and even those parts revealed Which modest nature keeps from sight concealed. Her face, her hands, her naked limbs, were torn, With passing through the brakes and prickly thorn; Two mastiffs gaunt and grim her flight pursued, And oft their fastened fangs in blood embrued: Oft they came up, and pinched her tender side,— “Mercy, O mercy! heaven!” she ran and cried; When heaven was named, they loosed their hold again; Then sprung she forth, they followed her amain. Not far behind, a knight of swarthy face, High on a coal-black steed pursued the chase; With flashing flames his ardent eyes were filled, And in his hand a naked sword he held: He cheered the dogs to follow her who fled, And vowed revenge on her devoted head. As Theodore was born of noble kind, The brutal action roused his manly mind; Moved with unworthy usage of the maid, He, though unarmed, resolved to give her aid. A saplin pine he wrenched from out the ground, The readiest weapon that his fury found. Thus furnished for offence, he crossed the way Betwixt the graceless villain and his prey. The knight came thundering on, but, from afar, Thus in imperious tone forbade the war:— “Cease, Theodore, to proffer vain relief, Nor stop the vengeance of so just a grief; But give me leave to seize my destined prey, And let eternal justice take the way: I but revenge my fate, disdained, betrayed, And suffering death for this ungrateful maid.” He said, at once dismounting from the steed; For now the hell-hounds with superior speed Had reached the dame, and fastening on her side, The ground with issuing streams of purple dyed. Stood Theodore surprised in deadly fright, With chattering teeth, and bristling hair upright; Yet armed with inborn worth—“Whate'er,” said he, “Thou art, who know'st me better than I thee, Or prove thy rightful cause, or be defied.” The spectre, fiercely staring, thus replied:— “Know, Theodore, thy ancestry I claim, And Guido Cavalcanti was my name. One common sire our fathers did beget, My name and story some remember yet: Thee, then a boy, within my arms I laid, When for my sins I loved this haughty maid; Not less adored in life, nor served by me, Than proud Honoria now is loved by thee. What did I not her stubborn heart to gain? But all my vows were answered with disdain; She scorned my sorrows, and despised my pain. Long time I dragged my days in fruitless care; Then loathing life, and plunged in deep despair, To finish my unhappy life, I fell On this sharp sword, and now am damned in hell. Short was her joy; for soon the insulting maid By heaven's decree in the cold grave was laid; And as in unrepenting sin she died, Doomed to the same bad place, is punished for her pride, Because she deemed I well deserved to die, And made a merit of her cruelty. There, then, we met; both tried, and both were cast, And this irrevocable sentence passed; That she, whom I so long pursued in vain, Should suffer from my hands a lingering pain: Renewed to life, that she might daily die, I daily doomed to follow, she to fly; No more a lover, but a mortal foe, I seek her life (for love is none below;) As often as my dogs with better speed Arrest her flight, is she to death decreed: Then with this fatal sword, on which I died, I pierce her opened back, or tender side, And tear that hardened heart from out her breast, Which, with her entrails, makes my hungry hounds a feast. Nor lies she long, but as her fates ordain, Springs up to life, and, fresh to second pain, Is saved to-day, to-morrow to be slain.” This, versed in death, the infernal knight relates, And then for proof fulfilled their common fates; Her heart and bowels through her back he drew, And fed the hounds that helped him to pursue. Stern looked the fiend, as frustrate of his will, Not half sufficed, and greedy yet to kill. And now the soul expiring through the wound, Had left the body breathless on the ground, When thus the grisly spectre spoke again:— “Behold the fruit of ill-rewarded pain! As many months as I sustained her hate, So many years is she condemned by fate To daily death; and every several place, Conscious of her disdain, and my disgrace, Must witness her just punishment, and be A scene of triumph and revenge to me. As in this grove I took my last farewell, As on this very spot of earth I fell, As Friday saw me die, so she my prey Becomes even here, on this revolving day.” Thus while he spoke, the virgin from the ground Upstarted fresh, already closed the wound, And, unconcerned for all she felt before, Precipitates her flight along the shore: The hell-hounds, as ungorged with flesh and blood, Pursue their prey, and seek their wonted food: The fiend remounts his courser, mends his pace, And all the vision vanished from the place. Long stood the noble youth oppressed with awe, And stupid at the wondrous things he saw, Surpassing common faith, transgressing nature's law: He would have been asleep, and wished to wake, But dreams, he knew, no long impression make, Though strong at first; if vision, to what end, But such as must his future state portend? His love the damsel, and himself the fiend. But yet reflecting that it could not be From heaven, which cannot impious acts decree, Resolved within himself to shun the snare, Which hell for his destruction did prepare; And as his better genius should direct, From an ill cause to draw a good effect. Inspired from heaven, he homeward took his way, Nor palled his new design with long delay; But of his train a trusty servant sent, To call his friends together at his tent. They came, and usual salutations paid, With words premeditated thus he said:— “What you have often counselled, to remove My vain pursuit of unregarded love, By thrift my sinking fortune to repair, Though late, yet is at last become my care; My heart shall be my own; my vast expense Reduced to bounds, by timely providence: This only I require; invite for me Honoria, with her father's family, Her friends, and mine, (the cause I shall display,) On Friday next; for that's the appointed day.” Well pleased were all his friends; the task was light, The father, mother, daughter, they invite; Hardly the dame was drawn to this repast, But yet resolved, because it was the last. The day was come, the guests invited came, And, with the rest, the inexorable dame: A feast prepared with riotous expense, Much cost, more care, and most magnificence. The place ordained was in that haunted grove, Where the revenging ghost pursued his love: The tables in a proud pavilion spread, With flowers below, and tissue overhead: The rest in rank, Honoria, chief in place, Was artfully contrived to set her face To front the thicket, and behold the chase. The feast was served, the time so well forecast, That just when the dessert and fruits were placed, The fiend's alarm began; the hollow sound Sung in the leaves, the forest shook around, Air blackened, rolled the thunder, groaned the ground. Nor long before the loud laments arise, Of one distressed, and mastiffs' mingled cries; And first the dame came rushing through the wood, And next the famished hounds that sought their food, And griped her flanks, and oft essayed their jaws in blood. Last came the felon, on the sable steed, Armed with his naked sword, and urged his dogs to speed. She ran, and cried, her flight directly bent, (A guest unbidden) to the fatal tent, The scene of death, and place ordained for punishment. Loud was the noise, aghast was every guest, The women shrieked, the men forsook the feast; The hounds at nearer distance hoarsely bayed; The hunter close pursued the visionary maid, She rent the heaven with loud laments, imploring aid. The gallants to protect the lady's right, Their falchions brandished at the grisly sprite; High on his stirrups he provoked the fight. Then on the crowd he cast a furious look, And withered all their strength before he strook: “Back, on your lives! let be,” said he, “my prey, And let my vengeance take the destined way: Vain are your arms, and vainer your defence, Against the eternal doom of Providence: Mine is the ungrateful maid by heaven designed; Mercy she would not give, nor mercy shall she find.” At this the former tale again he told With thundering tone, and dreadful to behold: Sunk were their hearts with horror of the crime, Nor needed to be warned a second time, But bore each other back; some knew the face, And all had heard the much-lamented case Of him who fell for love, and this the fatal place. And now the infernal minister advanced, Seized the due victim, and with fury lanced Her back, and piercing through her inmost heart, Drew backward, as before, the offending part. The reeking entrails next he tore away, And to his meagre mastiffs made a prey. The pale assistants on each other stared, With gaping mouths for issuing words prepared; The still-born sounds upon the palate hung, And died imperfect on the faltering tongue. The fright was general; but the female band (A helpless train) in more confusion stand! With horror shuddering, on a heap they run, Sick at the sight of hateful justice done; For conscience rung the alarm, and made the case their own. So, spread upon a lake, with upward eye, A plump of fowl behold their foe on high; They close their trembling troop; and all attend On whom the sowsing eagle will descend. But most the proud Honoria feared the event, And thought to her alone the vision sent. Her guilt presents to her distracted mind Heaven's justice, Theodore's revengeful kind, And the same fate to the same sin assigned; Already sees herself the monster's prey, And feels her heart and entrails torn away. 'Twas a mute scene of sorrow, mixed with fear; Still on the table lay the unfinished cheer: The knight and hungry mastiffs stood around, The mangled dame lay breathless on the ground; When on a sudden, re-inspired with breath, Again she rose, again to suffer death; Nor stayed the hell-hounds, nor the hunter stayed, But followed, as before, the flying maid: The avenger took from earth the avenging sword, And mounting, light as air, his sable steed he spurred: The clouds dispelled, the sky resumed her light, And nature stood recovered of her fright. But fear, the last of ills, remained behind, And horror heavy sat on every mind. Nor Theodore encouraged more his feast, But sternly looked, as hatching in his breast Some deep design; which when Honoria viewed, The fresh impulse her former fright renewed: She thought herself the trembling dame who fled, And him the grisly ghost that spurred the infernal steed: The more dismayed, for when the guests withdrew, Their courteous host, saluting all the crew, Regardless passed her o'er, nor graced with kind adieu. That sting infixed within her haughty mind, The downfall of her empire she divined; And her proud heart with secret sorrow pined. Home as they went, the sad discourse renewed, Of the relentless dame to death pursued, And of the sight obscene so lately viewed. None durst arraign the righteous doom she bore; Even they, who pitied most, yet blamed her more: The parallel they needed not to name, But in the dead they damned the living dame. At every little noise she looked behind, For still the knight was present to her mind: And anxious oft she started on the way, And thought the horseman-ghost came thundering for his prey. Returned, she took her bed, with little rest, But in short slumbers dreamt the funeral feast: Awaked, she turned her side, and slept again; The same black vapours mounted in her brain, And the same dreams returned with double pain. Now forced to wake, because afraid to sleep, Her blood all fevered, with a furious leap She sprung from bed, distracted in her mind, And feared, at every step, a twitching sprite behind. Darkling and desperate with a staggering pace, Of death afraid, and conscious of disgrace; Fear, pride, remorse, at once her heart assailed, Pride put remorse to flight, but fear prevailed. Friday, the fatal day, when next it came, Her soul forethought the fiend would change his game, And her pursue, or Theodore be slain, And two ghosts join their packs to hunt her o'er the plain. This dreadful image so possessed her mind, That desperate any succour else to find She ceased all further hope; and now began To make reflection on the unhappy man. Rich, brave, and young, who past expression loved, Proof to disdain, and not to be removed: Of all the men respected and admired, Of all the dames, except herself, desired: Why not of her? preferred above the rest By him, with knightly deeds, and open love, professed? So had another been, where he his vows addressed, This quelled her pride, yet other doubts remained, That, once disdaining, she might be disdained. The fear was just, but greater fear prevailed, Fear of her life by hellish hounds assailed: He took a lowering leave; but who can tell, What outward hate might inward love conceal? Her sex's arts she knew, and why not, then, Might deep dissembling have a place in men? Here hope began to dawn; resolved to try, She fixed on this her utmost remedy; Death was behind, but hard it was to die. 'Twas time enough at last on death to call, The precipice in sight: a shrub was all, That kindly stood betwixt to break the fatal fall. One maid she had, beloved above the rest; Secure of her, the secret she confessed; And now the cheerful light her fears dispelled, She with no winding turns the truth concealed, But put the woman off, and stood revealed: With faults confessed commissioned her to go, If pity yet had place, and reconcile her foe. The welcome message made, was soon received; 'Twas what he wished, and hoped, but scarce believed; Fate seemed a fair occasion to present, He knew the sex, and feared she might repent Should he delay the moment of consent. There yet remained to gain her friends, (a care The modesty of maidens well might spare;) But she with such a zeal the cause embraced, (As women, where they will, are all in haste,) That father, mother, and the kin beside, Were overborne by fury of the tide: With full consent of all she changed her state; Resistless in her love, as in her hate. By her example warned, the rest beware; More easy, less imperious, were the fair; And that one hunting, which the devil designed For one fair female, lost him half the kind. CYMON AND IPHIGENIA. Poeta loquitur. Old as I am, for ladies' love unfit, The power of beauty I remember yet, Which once inflamed my soul, and still inspires my wit. If love be folly, the severe divine Has felt that folly, though he censures mine; Pollutes the pleasures of a chaste embrace, Acts what I write, and propagates in grace, With riotous excess, a priestly race. Suppose him free, and that I forge the offence, He showed the way, perverting first my sense; In malice witty, and with venom fraught, He makes me speak the things I never thought. Compute the gains of his ungoverned zeal; Ill suits his cloth the praise of railing well. The world will think that what we loosely write, Though now arraigned, he read with some delight; Because he seems to chew the cud again, When his broad comment makes the text too plain; And teaches more in one explaining page, Than all the double meanings of the stage. What needs he paraphrase on what we mean? We were at worst but wanton; he's obscene. I, nor my fellows, nor myself excuse; But love's the subject of the comic muse; Nor can we write without it, nor would you A tale of only dry instruction view. Nor love is always of a vicious kind, But oft to virtuous acts inflames the mind, Awakes the sleepy vigour of the soul, And, brushing o'er, adds motion to the pool. Love, studious how to please, improves our parts With polished manners, and adorns with arts. Love first invented verse, and formed the rhyme, The motion measured, harmonised the chime; To liberal acts enlarged the narrow soul'd, Softened the fierce, and made the coward bold; The world, when waste, he peopled with increase, And warring nations reconciled in peace. Ormond, the first, and all the fair may find, In this one legend, to their fame designed, When beauty fires the blood, how love exalts the mind. In that sweet isle where Venus keeps her court, And every grace, and all the loves, resort; Where either sex is formed of softer earth, And takes the bent of pleasure from their birth; There lived a Cyprian lord above the rest, Wise, wealthy, with a numerous issue blest. But as no gift of fortune is sincere, Was only wanting in a worthy heir; His eldest born, a goodly youth to view, Excelled the rest in shape, and outward shew; Fair, tall, his limbs with due proportion joined, But of a heavy, dull, degenerate mind. His soul belied the features of his face; Beauty was there, but beauty in disgrace. A clownish mien, a voice with rustic sound, And stupid eyes that ever loved the ground. He looked like nature's error, as the mind And body were not of a piece designed, But made for two, and by mistake in one were joined. The ruling rod, the father's forming care, Were exercised in vain on wit's despair; The more informed, the less he understood, And deeper sunk by floundering in the mud. Now scorned of all, and grown the public shame, The people from Galesus changed his name, And Cymon called, which signifies a brute; So well his name did with his nature suit. His father, when he found his labour lost, And care employed, that answered not the cost, Chose an ungrateful object to remove, And loathed to see what nature made him love; So to his country farm the fool confined; Rude work well suited with a rustic mind. Thus to the wilds the sturdy Cymon went, A squire among the swains, and pleased with banishment. His corn and cattle were his only care, And his supreme delight, a country fair. It happened on a summer's holiday, That to the greenwood shade he took his way; For Cymon shunned the church, and used not much to pray. His quarterstaff, which he could ne'er forsake, Hung half before, and half behind his back. He trudged along, unknowing what he sought, And whistled as he went, for want of thought. By chance conducted, or by thirst constrained, The deep recesses of the grove he gained; Where in a plain defended by the wood, Crept through the matted grass a crystal flood, By which an alabaster fountain stood; And on the margin of the fount was laid, (Attended by her slaves) a sleeping maid. Like Dian and her nymphs, when, tired with sport, To rest by cool Eurotas they resort. The dame herself the goddess well expressed, Not more distinguished by her purple vest, Than by the charming features of her face, And even in slumber a superior grace; Her comely limbs composed with decent care, Her body shaded with a slight cymar; Her bosom to the view was only bare; Where two beginning paps were scarcely spied, For yet their places were but signified: The fanning wind upon her bosom blows, To meet the fanning wind the bosom rose; The fanning wind, and purling streams, continue her repose. The fool of nature stood with stupid eyes, And gaping mouth, that testified surprise, Fixed on her face, nor could remove his sight, New as he was to love, and novice in delight; Long mute he stood, and, leaning on his staff, His wonder witnessed with an idiot laugh; Then would have spoke, but by his glimmering sense, First found his want of words, and feared offence; Doubted for what he was he should be known, By his clown accent, and his country tone. Through the rude chaos thus the running light Shot the first ray that pierced the native night; Then day and darkness in the mass were mixed, Till gathered in a globe the beams were fixed; Last shone the sun, who, radiant in his sphere, Illumined heaven and earth, and rolled around the year. So reason in this brutal soul began: Love made him first suspect he was a man; Love made him doubt his broad barbarian sound; By love his want of words, and wit, he found; That sense of want prepared the future way To knowledge, and disclosed the promise of a day. What not his father's care, nor tutor's art, Could plant with pains in his unpolished heart, The best instructor, love, at once inspired, As barren grounds to fruitfulness are fired; Love taught him shame, and shame, with love at strife, Soon taught the sweet civilities of life. His gross material soul at once could find Somewhat in her excelling all her kind; Exciting a desire till then unknown, Somewhat unfound, or found in her alone. This made the first impression in his mind, Above, but just above, the brutal kind. For beasts can like, but not distinguish too, Nor their own liking by reflection know; Nor why they like or this or t'other face, Or judge of this, or that peculiar grace; But love in gross, and stupidly admire; As flies, allured by light, approach the fire. Thus our man-beast, advancing by degrees, First likes the whole, then separates what he sees; On several parts a several praise bestows, The ruby lips, the well-proportioned nose, The snowy skin, the raven-glossy hair, The dimpled cheek, the forehead rising fair, And, even in sleep itself, a smiling air. From thence his eyes descending viewed the rest, Her plump round arms, white hands, and heaving breast. Long on the last he dwelt, though every part A pointed arrow sped to pierce his heart. Thus in a trice a judge of beauty grown, (A judge erected from a country clown,) He longed to see her eyes, in slumber hid, And wished his own could pierce within the lid: He would have waked her, but restrained his thought, And love new-born the first good manners taught. An awful fear his ardent wish withstood, Nor durst disturb the goddess of the wood; For such she seemed by her celestial face, Excelling all the rest of human race; And things divine, by common sense he knew, Must be devoutly seen at distant view: So checking his desire, with trembling heart Gazing he stood, nor would, nor could depart; Fixed as a pilgrim wildered in his way, Who dares not stir by night, for fear to stray, But stands with awful eyes to watch the dawn of day. At length awaking, Iphigene the fair, (So was the beauty called, who caused his care,) Unclosed her eyes, and double day revealed, While those of all her slaves in sleep were sealed. The slavering cudden, propped upon his staff, Stood ready gaping with a grinning laugh, To welcome her awake, nor durst begin To speak, but wisely kept the fool within. Then she: “What make you, Cymon, here alone?” (For Cymon's name was round the country known, Because descended of a noble race, And for a soul ill sorted with his face.) But still the sot stood silent with surprise, With fixed regard on her new-opened eyes, And in his breast received the envenomed dart, A tickling pain that pleased amid the smart. But conscious of her form, with quick distrust She saw his sparkling eyes, and feared his brutal lust; This to prevent, she waked her sleepy crew, And, rising hasty, took a short adieu. Then Cymon first his rustic voice essayed, With proffered service to the parting maid To see her safe; his hand she long denied, But took at length, ashamed of such a guide. So Cymon led her home, and leaving there, No more would to his country clowns repair, But sought his father's house, with better mind, Refusing in the farm to be confined. The father wondered at the son's return, And knew not whether to rejoice or mourn; But doubtfully received, expecting still To learn the secret causes of his altered will. Nor was he long delayed; the first request He made, was like his brothers to be dressed, And, as his birth required, above the rest. With ease his suit was granted by his sire, Distinguishing his heir by rich attire: His body thus adorned, he next designed With liberal arts to cultivate his mind; He sought a tutor of his own accord, And studied lessons he before abhorred. Thus the man-child advanced, and learned so fast, That in short time his equals he surpassed: His brutal manners from his breast exiled, His mien he fashioned, and his tongue he filed; In every exercise of all admired, He seemed, nor only seemed, but was inspired; Inspired by love, whose business is to please; He rode, he fenced, he moved with graceful ease, More famed for sense, for courtly carriage more, Than for his brutal folly known before. What then of altered Cymon shall we say, But that the fire which choked in ashes lay, A load too heavy for his soul to move, Was upward blown below, and brushed away by love? Love made an active progress through his mind, The dusky parts he cleared, the gross refined, The drowsy waked; and, as he went, impressed The Maker's image on the human breast. Thus was the man amended by desire, And, though he loved perhaps with too much fire, His father all his faults with reason scanned, And liked an error of the better hand; Excused the excess of passion in his mind, By flames too fierce, perhaps too much refined; So Cymon, since his sire indulged his will, Impetuous loved, and would be Cymon still; Galesus he disowned, and chose to bear The name of fool, confirmed and bishoped by the fair. To Cipseus by his friends his suit he moved, Cipseus, the father of the fair he loved; But he was pre-engaged by former ties, While Cymon was endeavouring to be wise; And Iphigene, obliged by former vows, Had given her faith to wed a foreign spouse: Her sire and she to Rhodian Pasimond, Though both repenting, were by promise bound, Nor could retract; and thus, as fate decreed, Though better loved, he spoke too late to speed. The doom was past; the ship already sent Did all his tardy diligence prevent; Sighed to herself the fair unhappy maid, While stormy Cymon thus in secret said:— “The time is come for Iphigene to find The miracle she wrought upon my mind; Her charms have made me man, her ravished love In rank shall place me with the blessed above. For mine by love, by force she shall be mine, Or death, if force should fail, shall finish my design.” Resolved he said; and rigged with speedy care A vessel strong, and well equipped for war. The secret ship with chosen friends he stored; And bent to die, or conquer, went aboard. Ambushed he lay behind the Cyprian shore, Waiting the sail that all his wishes bore; Nor long expected, for the following tide Sent out the hostile ship and beauteous bride. To Rhodes the rival bark directly steered, When Cymon sudden at her back appeared, And stopped her flight; then standing on his prow, In haughty terms he thus defied the foe:— “Or strike your sails at summons, or prepare To prove the last extremities of war.” Thus warned, the Rhodians for the fight provide; Already were the vessels side by side, These obstinate to save, and those to seize the bride. But Cymon soon his crooked grapples cast, Which with tenacious hold his foes embraced, And, armed with sword and shield, amid the press he passed. Fierce was the fight, but, hastening to his prey, By force the furious lover freed his way; Himself alone dispersed the Rhodian crew, The weak disdained, the valiant overthrew; Cheap conquest for his following friends remained, He reaped the field, and they but only gleaned. His victory confessed, the foes retreat, And cast their weapons at the victor's feet. Whom thus he cheered: “O Rhodian youth, I fought For love alone, nor other booty sought; Your lives are safe; your vessel I resign, Yours be your own, restoring what is mine: In Iphigene I claim my rightful due, Robbed by my rival, and detained by you; Your Pasimond a lawless bargain drove, The parent could not sell the daughter's love; Or if he could, my love disdains the laws, And, like a king, by conquest gains his cause; Where arms take place, all other pleas are vain, Love taught me force, and force shall love maintain. You, what by strength you could not keep, release, And at an easy ransom buy your peace.” Fear on the conquered side soon signed the accord, And Iphigene to Cymon was restored. While to his arms the blushing bride he took, To seeming sadness she composed her look; As if by force subjected to his will, Though pleased, dissembling, and a woman still. And, for she wept, he wiped her falling tears, And prayed her to dismiss her empty fears;— “For yours I am,” he said, “and have deserved Your love much better whom so long I served, Than he to whom your formal father tied Your vows, and sold a slave, not sent a bride.” Thus while he spoke, he seized the willing prey, As Paris bore the Spartan spouse away. Faintly she screamed, and even her eyes confessed She rather would be thought, than was, distressed. Who now exults but Cymon in his mind? Vain hopes and empty joys of humankind, Proud of the present, to the future blind! Secure of fate, while Cymon ploughs the sea, And steers to Candy with his conquered prey, Scarce the third glass of measured hours was run, When like a fiery meteor sunk the sun, The promise of a storm; the shifting gales Forsake by fits, and fill, the flagging sails; Hoarse murmurs of the main from far were heard, And night came on, not by degrees prepared, But all at once; at once the winds arise, The thunder rolls, the forky lightning flies. In vain the master issues out commands, In vain the trembling sailors ply their hands; The tempest unforeseen prevents their care, And from the first they labour in despair. The giddy ship, betwixt the winds and tides Forced back and forwards, in a circle rides, Stunned with the different blows; then shoots amain, Till, counterbuffed, she stops, and sleeps again. Not more aghast the proud archangel fell, Plunged from the height of heaven to deepest hell, Than stood the lover of his love possessed, Now cursed the more, the more he had been blessed; More anxious for her danger, than his own, Death he defies, but would be lost alone. Sad Iphigene to womanish complaints Adds pious prayers, and wearies all the saints; Even, if she could, her love she would repent, But since she cannot, dreads the punishment: Her forfeit faith, and Pasimond betrayed, Are ever present, and her crime upbraid. She blames herself, nor blames her lover less, Augments her anger, as her fears increase: From her own back the burden would remove, And lays the load on his ungoverned love, Which interposing durst, in heaven's despite, Invade, and violate another's right: The powers incensed awhile deferred his pain, And made him master of his vows in vain: But soon they punished his presumptuous pride, That for his daring enterprise she died, Who rather not resisted, than complied. Then, impotent of mind, with altered sense, She hugged the offender, and forgave the offence, Sex to the last: meantime with sails declined The wandering vessel drove before the wind: Tossed and retossed, aloft, and then alow, Nor port they seek, nor certain course they know, But every moment wait the coming blow. Thus blindly driven, by breaking day they viewed The land before them, and their fears renewed; The land was welcome, but the tempest bore The threatened ship against a rocky shore. A winding bay was near; to this they bent, And just escaped; their force already spent: Secure from storms, and panting from the sea, The land unknown at leisure they survey; And saw (but soon their sickly sight withdrew) The rising towers of Rhodes at distant view; And cursed the hostile shore of Pasimond, Saved from the seas, and shipwrecked on the ground. The frighted sailors tried their strength in vain To turn the stern, and tempt the stormy main; But the stiff wind withstood the labouring oar, And forced them forward on the fatal shore! The crooked keel now bites the Rhodian strand, And the ship moored constrains the crew to land: Yet still they might be safe, because unknown; But, as ill fortune seldom comes alone, The vessel they dismissed was driven before, Already sheltered on their native shore; Known each, they know, but each with change of cheer; The vanquished side exults, the victors fear; Not them but theirs, made prisoners ere they fight, Despairing conquest, and deprived of flight. The country rings around with loud alarms, And raw in fields the rude militia swarms; Mouths without hands; maintained at vast expense, In peace a charge, in war a weak defence; Stout once a month they march, a blustering band, And ever, but in times of need, at hand: This was the morn when, issuing on the guard, Drawn up in rank and file they stood prepared Of seeming arms to make a short essay, Then hasten to be drunk, the business of the day. The cowards would have fled, but that they knew Themselves so many, and their foes so few; But, crowding on, the last the first impel, Till overborne with weight the Cyprians fell; Cymon enslaved, who first the war begun, And Iphigene once more is lost and won. Deep in a dungeon was the captive cast, Deprived of day, and held in fetters fast; His life was only spared at their request, Whom taken he so nobly had released: But Iphigenia was the ladies' care, Each in their turn addressed to treat the fair; While Pasimond and his the nuptial feast prepare. Her secret soul to Cymon was inclined, But she must suffer what her fates assigned; So passive is the church of womankind. What worse to Cymon could his fortune deal, Rolled to the lowest spoke of all her wheel? It rested to dismiss the downward weight, Or raise him upward to his former height: The latter pleased; and love (concerned the most) Prepared the amends, for what by love he lost. The sire of Pasimond had left a son, Though younger, yet for courage early known, Ormisda called, to whom by promise tied, A Rhodian beauty was the destined bride; Cassandra was her name, above the rest Renowned for birth, with fortune amply blest. Lysimachus, who ruled the Rhodian state, Was then by choice their annual magistrate: He loved Cassandra too with equal fire, But fortune had not favoured his desire; Crossed by her friends, by her not disapproved, Not yet preferred, or like Ormisda loved: So stood the affair; some little hope remained, That, should his rival chance to lose, he gained. Meantime young Pasimond his marriage pressed, Ordained the nuptial day, prepared the feast; And frugally resolved (the charge to shun, Which would be double should he wed alone,) To join his brother's bridal with his own. Lysimachus, oppressed with mortal grief, Received the news, and studied quick relief: The fatal day approached; if force were used, The magistrate his public trust abused; To justice liable, as law required, For when his office ceased, his power expired: While power remained, the means were in his hand By force to seize, and then forsake the land: Betwixt extremes he knew not how to move, A slave to fame, but more a slave to love: Restraining others, yet himself not free, Made impotent by power, debased by dignity. Both sides he weighed; but after much debate, The man prevailed above the magistrate. Love never fails to master what he finds, But works a different way in different minds, The fool enlightens, and the wise he blinds. This youth, proposing to possess and scape, Began in murder, to conclude in rape: Unpraised by me; though heaven sometime may bless An impious act with undeserved success; The great, it seems, are privileged alone To punish all injustice but their own. But here I stop, not daring to proceed, Yet blush to flatter an unrighteous deed; For crimes are but permitted, not decreed. Resolved on force, his wit the prætor bent, To find the means that might secure the event; Not long he laboured, for his lucky thought In captive Cymon found the friend he sought. The example pleased; the cause and crime the same; An injured lover, and a ravished dame. How much he durst he knew by what he dared; The less he had to lose, the less he cared To menage loathsome life when love was the reward. This pondered well, and fixed on his intent, In depth of night he for the prisoner sent; In secret sent the public view to shun, Then with a sober smile he thus begun:— “The powers above, who bounteously bestow Their gifts and graces on mankind below, Yet prove our merit first, nor blindly give To such as are not worthy to receive: For valour and for virtue they provide Their due reward, but first they must be tried: These fruitful seeds within your mind they sowed; 'Twas yours to improve the talent they bestowed: They gave you to be born of noble kind, They gave you love to lighten up your mind, And purge the grosser parts; they gave you care To please, and courage to deserve the fair. “Thus far they tried you, and by proof they found The grain intrusted in a grateful ground: But still the great experiment remained, They suffered you to lose the prize you gained, That you might learn the gift was theirs alone; And, when restored, to them the blessing own. Restored it soon will be; the means prepared, The difficulty smoothed, the danger shared: Be but yourself, the care to me resign, Then Iphigene is yours, Cassandra mine. Your rival Pasimond pursues your life, Impatient to revenge his ravished wife, But yet not his; to-morrow is behind, And Love our fortunes in one band has joined: Two brothers are our foes, Ormisda mine, As much declared as Pasimond is thine: To-morrow must their common vows be tied: With Love to friend, and Fortune for our guide, Let both resolve to die, or each redeem a bride. Right I have none, nor hast thou much to plead; 'Tis force, when done, must justify the deed: Our task performed, we next prepare for flight, And let the losers talk in vain of right: We with the fair will sail before the wind; If they are grieved, I leave the laws behind. Speak thy resolves; if now thy courage droop, Despair in prison, and abandon hope; But if thou darest in arms thy love regain, (For liberty without thy love were vain,) Then second my design to seize the prey, Or lead to second rape, for well thou know'st the way.” Said Cymon, overjoyed, “Do thou propose The means to fight, and only show the foes: For from the first, when love had fired my mind, Resolved, I left the care of life behind.” To this the bold Lysimachus replied:— “Let heaven be neuter, and the sword decide; The spousals are prepared, already play The minstrels, and provoke the tardy day: By this the brides are waked, their grooms are dressed; All Rhodes is summoned to the nuptial feast All but myself, the sole unbidden guest. Unbidden though I am, I will be there, And, joined by thee, intend to joy the fair. Now hear the rest; when day resigns the light, And cheerful torches gild the jolly night, Be ready at my call; my chosen few With arms administered shall aid thy crew. Then, entering unexpected, will we seize Our destined prey, from men dissolved in ease, By wine disabled, unprepared for fight; And hastening to the seas, suborn our flight: The seas are ours, for I command the fort, A ship well manned expects us in the port: If they, or if their friends, the prize contest, Death shall attend the man who dares resist.” It pleased; the prisoner to his hold retired, His troop with equal emulation fired, All fixed to fight, and all their wonted work required. The sun arose; the streets were thronged around, The palace opened, and the posts were crowned. The double bridegroom at the door attends The expected spouse, and entertains the friends: They meet, they lead to church, the priests invoke The powers, and feed the flames with fragrant smoke. This done, they feast, and at the close of night By kindled torches vary their delight, These lead the lively dance, and those the brimming bowls invite. Now, at the appointed place and hour assigned, With souls resolved the ravishers were joined: Three bands are formed; the first is sent before To favour the retreat, and guard the shore; The second at the palace-gate is placed, And up the lofty stairs ascend the last: A peaceful troop they seem with shining vests, But coats of mail beneath secure their breasts. Dauntless they enter, Cymon at their head, And find the feast renewed, the table spread: Sweet voices, mixed with instrumental sounds, Ascend the vaulted roof, the vaulted roof rebounds. When, like the Harpies, rushing through the hall The sudden troop appears, the tables fall, Their smoking load is on the pavement thrown; Each ravisher prepares to seize his own: The brides, invaded with a rude embrace, Shriek out for aid, confusion fills the place. Quick to redeem the prey their plighted lords Advance, the palace gleams with shining swords. But late is all defence, and succour vain; The rape is made, the ravishers remain: Two sturdy slaves were only sent before To bear the purchased prize in safety to the shore. The troop retires, the lovers close the rear, With forward faces not confessing fear: Backward they move, but scorn their pace to mend; Then seek the stairs, and with slow haste descend. Fierce Pasimond, their passage to prevent, Thrust full on Cymon's back in his descent, The blade returned unbathed, and to the handle bent. Stout Cymon soon remounts, and cleft in two His rival's head with one descending blow: And as the next in rank Ormisda stood, He turned the point; the sword, inured to blood, Bored his unguarded breast, which poured a purple flood. With vowed revenge the gathering crowd pursues, The ravishers turn head, the fight renews; The hall is heaped with corpse; the sprinkled gore Besmears the walls, and floats the marble floor Dispersed at length the drunken squadron flies The victors to their vessel bear the prize, And hear behind loud groans and lamentable cries. The crew with merry shouts their anchors weigh, Then ply their oars, and brush the buxom sea, While troops of gathered Rhodians crowd the key. What should the people do when left alone? The governor and government are gone; The public wealth to foreign parts conveyed; Some troops disbanded, and the rest unpaid. Rhodes is the sovereign of the sea no more; Their ships unrigged, and spent their naval store, They neither could defend, nor can pursue, But grinned their teeth, and cast a helpless view: In vain with darts a distant war they try, Short, and more short, the missive weapons fly. Meanwhile the ravishers their crimes enjoy, And flying sails and sweeping oars employ: The cliffs of Rhodes in little space are lost, Jove's isle they seek, nor Jove denies his coast. In safety landed on the Candian shore, With generous wines their spirits they restore; There Cymon with his Rhodian friend resides, Both court, and wed at once the willing brides. A war ensues, the Cretans own their cause, Stiff to defend their hospitable laws: Both parties lose by turns; and neither wins, Till peace propounded by a truce begins. The kindred of the slain forgive the deed, But a short exile must for show precede: The term expired, from Candia they remove; And happy each at home, enjoys his love.</field>

Macareus and Canace, son and daughter to Æolus, God of the Winds, loved each other incestuously: Canace was delivered of a son, and committed him to her nurse, to be secretly conveyed away. The infant crying out, by that means was discovered to Æolus, who, enraged at the wickedness of his children, commanded the babe to be exposed to wild beasts on the mountains; and withal, sent a sword to Canace, with this message, That her crimes would instruct her how to use it. With this sword she slew herself; but before she died, she writ the following letter to her brother Macareus, who had taken sanctuary in the temple of Apollo. If streaming blood my fatal letter stain, Imagine, ere you read, the writer slain; One hand the sword, and one the pen employs, And in my lap the ready paper lies. Think in this posture thou behold'st me write; In this my cruel father would delight. O! were he present, that his eyes and hands Might see, and urge the death which he commands! Than all the raging winds more dreadful, he, Unmoved, without a tear, my wounds would see. Jove justly placed him on a stormy throne, His people's temper is so like his own. The north and south, and each contending blast, Are underneath his wide dominion cast: Those he can rule; but his tempestuous mind Is, like his airy kingdom, unconfined. Ah! what avail my kindred Gods above, That in their number I can reckon Jove! What help will all my heavenly friends afford, When to my breast I lift the pointed sword? That hour, which joined us, came before its time; In death we had been one without a crime. Why did thy flames beyond a brother's move? Why loved I thee with more than sister's love? For I loved too; and, knowing not my wound, A secret pleasure in thy kisses found; My cheeks no longer did their colour boast, My food grew loathsome, and my strength I lost: Still ere I spoke, a sigh would stop my tongue; Short were my slumbers, and my nights were long. I knew not from my love these griefs did grow, Yet was, alas! the thing I did not know. My wily nurse, by long experience, found, And first discovered to my soul its wound. “'Tis love,” said she; and then my downcast eyes, And guilty dumbness, witnessed my surprise. Forced at the last my shameful pain I tell; And oh, what followed, we both know too well! “When half denying, more than half content, Embraces warmed me to a full consent, Then with tumultuous joys my heart did beat, And guilt, that made them anxious, made them great.” But now my swelling womb heaved up my breast, And rising weight my sinking limbs opprest. What herbs, what plants, did not my nurse produce, To make abortion by their powerful juice! What medicines tried we not, to thee unknown! Our first crime common; this was mine alone. But the strong child, secure in his dark cell, With nature's vigour did our arts repel. And now the pale-faced empress of the night Nine times had filled her orb with borrowed light; Not knowing 'twas my labour, I complain Of sudden shootings, and of grinding pain; My throes came thicker, and my cries increased, Which with her hand the conscious nurse suppressed. To that unhappy fortune was I come, Pain urged my clamours, but fear kept me dumb. With inward struggling I restrained my cries, And drunk the tears that trickled from my eyes. Death was in sight, Lucina gave no aid, And even my dying had my guilt betrayed. Thou cam'st, and in thy countenance sat despair; Rent were thy garments all, and torn thy hair; Yet feigning comfort, which thou couldst not give, Prest in thy arms, and whispering me to live; For both our sakes, said'st thou, “Preserve thy life; Live, my dear sister, and my dearer wife.” Raised by that name, with my last pangs I strove; Such power have words, when spoke by those we love. The babe, as if he heard what thou hadst sworn, With hasty joy sprung forward to be born. What helps it to have weathered out one storm! Fear of our father does another form. High in his hall, rocked in a chair of state, The king with his tempestuous council sate; Through this large room our only passage lay, By which we could the new-born babe convey. Swathed in her lap, the bold nurse bore him out, With olive branches covered round about; And, muttering prayers, as holy rites she meant, Through the divided crowd unquestioned went. Just at the door the unhappy infant cried; The grandsire heard him, and the theft he spied. Swift as a whirlwind to the nurse he flies, And deafs his stormy subjects with his cries. With one fierce puff he blows the leaves away; Exposed the self-discovered infant lay. The noise reached me, and my presaging mind Too soon its own approaching woes divined. Not ships at sea with winds are shaken more, Nor seas themselves, when angry tempests roar, Than I, when my loud father's voice I hear; The bed beneath me trembled with my fear. He rushed upon me, and divulged my stain; Scarce from my murder could his hands refrain. I only answered him with silent tears; They flowed; my tongue was frozen up with fears. His little grandchild he commands away, To mountain wolves and every bird of prey. The babe cried out, as if he understood, And begged his pardon with what voice he could. By what expressions can my grief be shown? Yet you may guess my anguish by your own, To see my bowels, and, what yet was worse, Your bowels too, condemned to such a curse! Out went the king; my voice its freedom found, My breasts I beat, my blubbered cheeks I wound. And now appeared the messenger of death; Sad were his looks, and scarce he drew his breath, To say, “Your father sends you”—(with that word His trembling hands presented me a sword;)— “Your father sends you this; and lets you know, That your own crimes the use of it will show.” Too well I know the sense those words impart; His present shall be treasured in my heart. Are these the nuptial gifts a bride receives? And this the fatal dower a father gives? Thou God of marriage, shun thy own disgrace, And take thy torch from this detested place! Instead of that, let furies light their brands, And fire my pile with their infernal hands! With happier fortune may my sisters wed, Warned by the dire example of the dead. For thee, poor babe, what crime could they pretend? How could thy infant innocence offend? A guilt there was; but, oh, that guilt was mine! Thou suffer'st for a sin that was not thine. Thy mother's grief and crime! but just enjoyed, Shown to my sight, and born to be destroyed! Unhappy offspring of my teeming womb! Dragged headlong from thy cradle to thy tomb! Thy unoffending life I could not save, Nor weeping could I follow to thy grave; Nor on thy tomb could offer my shorn hair, Nor show the grief which tender mothers bear. Yet long thou shalt not from my arms be lost; For soon I will o'ertake thy infant ghost. But thou, my love, and now my love's despair, Perform his funerals with paternal care; His scattered limbs with my dead body burn, And once more join us in the pious urn. If on my wounded breast thou dropp'st a tear, Think for whose sake my breast that wound did bear; And faithfully my last desires fulfil, As I perform my cruel father's will. HELEN TO PARIS. EPIST. XVII. THE ARGUMENT. Helen, having received an epistle from Paris, returns the following answer; wherein she seems at first to chide him for his presumption in writing as he had done, which could only proceed from his low opinion of her virtue; then owns herself to be sensible of the passion which he had expressed for her, though she much suspected his constancy; and at last discovers her inclination to be favourable to him; the whole letter showing the extreme artifice of womankind. When loose epistles violate chaste eyes, She half consents, who silently denies. How dares a stranger, with designs so vain, Marriage and hospitable rights profane? Was it for this, your fleet did shelter find From swelling seas, and every faithless wind? For though a distant country brought you forth, Your usage here was equal to your worth. Does this deserve to be rewarded so? Did you come here a stranger, or a foe? Your partial judgment may perhaps complain, And think me barbarous for my just disdain; Ill-bred then let me be, but not unchaste, Nor my clear fame with any spot defaced. Though in my face there's no affected frown, Nor in my carriage a feigned niceness shown, I keep my honour still without a stain, Nor has my love made any coxcomb vain. Your boldness I with admiration see; What hope had you to gain a queen like me? Because a hero forced me once away, Am I thought fit to be a second prey? Had I been won, I had deserved your blame, But sure my part was nothing but the shame. Yet the base theft to him no fruit did bear, I scaped unhurt by any thing but fear. Rude force might some unwilling kisses gain; But that was all he ever could obtain. You on such terms would ne'er have let me go; Were he like you, we had not parted so. Untouched the youth restored me to my friends, And modest usage made me some amends. 'Tis virtue to repent a vicious deed; Did he repent, that Paris might succeed? Sure 'tis some fate that sets me above wrongs, Yet still exposes me to busy tongues. I'll not complain; for who's displeased with love, If it sincere, discreet, and constant prove? But that I fear; not that I think you base, Or doubt the blooming beauties of my face; But all your sex is subject to deceive, And ours, alas! too willing to believe. Yet others yield; and love o'ercomes the best; But why should I not shine above the rest? Fair Leda's story seems at first to be A fit example, ready formed for me. But she was cozened by a borrowed shape, And under harmless feathers felt a rape. If I should yield, what reason could I use? By what mistake the loving crime excuse? Her fault was in her powerful lover lost; But of what Jupiter have I to boast? Though you to heroes and to kings succeed, Our famous race does no addition need; And great alliances but useless prove, To one that comes herself from mighty Jove. Go then, and boast, in some less haughty place, Your Phrygian blood, and Priam's ancient race; Which I would show I valued, if I durst; You are the fifth from Jove, but I the first. The crown of Troy is powerful, I confess; But I have reason to think ours no less. Your letter, filled with promises of all That men can good, and women pleasant call, Gives expectation such an ample field, As would move goddesses themselves to yield. But if I e'er offend great Juno's laws, Yourself shall be the dear, the only cause; Either my honour I'll to death maintain, Or follow you, without mean thoughts of gain. Not that so fair a present I despise; We like the gift, when we the giver prize: But 'tis your love moves me, which made you take Such pains, and run such hazards for my sake. I have perceived, though I dissembled too, A thousand things that love has made you do. Your eager eyes would almost dazzle mine, In which, wild man, your wanton thoughts would shine. Sometimes you'd sigh, sometimes disordered stand, And with unusual ardour press my hand; Contrive just after me to take the glass, Nor would you let the least occasion pass; When oft I feared, I did not mind alone, And blushing sate for things which you have done; Then murmured to myself,—“He'll for my sake Do any thing;”—I hope 'twas no mistake. Oft have I read within this pleasing grove, Under my name, those charming words,—I love. I, frowning, seemed not to believe your flame; But now, alas! am come to write the same. If I were capable to do amiss, I could not but be sensible of this. For oh! your face has such peculiar charms, That who can hold from flying to your arms! But what I ne'er can have without offence, May some blest maid possess with innocence. Pleasure may tempt, but virtue more should move; O learn of me to want the thing you love. What you desire is sought by all mankind; As you have eyes, so others are not blind. Like you they see, like you my charms adore; They wish not less, but you dare venture more. Oh! had you then upon our coasts been brought, My virgin-love when thousand rivals sought, You had I seen, you should have had my voice, Nor could my husband justly blame my choice. For both our hopes, alas! you come too late; Another now is master of my fate. More to my wish I could have lived with you, And yet my present lot can undergo. Cease to solicit a weak woman's will, And urge not her you love to so much ill; But let me live contented as I may, And make not my unspotted fame your prey. Some right you claim, since naked to your eyes Three goddesses disputed beauty's prize; One offered valour, t'other crowns; but she Obtained her cause, who, smiling, promised me. But first I am not of belief so light, To think such nymphs would show you such a sight; Yet granting this, the other part is feigned; A bribe so mean your sentence had not gained. With partial eyes I should myself regard, To think that Venus made me her reward. I humbly am content with human praise; A goddess's applause would envy raise. But be it as you say; for, 'tis confest, The men, who flatter highest, please us best. That I suspect it, ought not to displease; For miracles are not believed with ease. One joy I have, that I had Venus' voice; A greater yet, that you confirmed her choice; That proffered laurels, promised sovereignty, Juno and Pallas, you contemned for me. Am I your empire, then, and your renown? What heart of rock, but must by this be won? And yet bear witness, O you Powers above, How rude I am in all the arts of love! My hand is yet untaught to write to men; This is the essay of my unpractised pen. Happy those nymphs, whom use has perfect made! I think all crime, and tremble at a shade. E'en while I write, my fearful conscious eyes Look often back, misdoubting a surprise. For now the rumour spreads among the crowd, At court in whispers, but in town aloud. Dissemble you, whate'er you hear them say; To leave off loving were your better way; Yet if you will dissemble it, you may. Love secretly; the absence of my lord More freedom gives, but does not all afford; Long is his journey, long will be his stay, Called by affairs of consequence away. To go, or not, when unresolved he stood, I bid him make what swift return he could; Then kissing me, he said, “I recommend All to thy care, but most my Trojan friend.” I smiled at what he innocently said, And only answered, “You shall be obeyed.” Propitious winds have borne him far from hence, But let not this secure your confidence. Absent he is, yet absent he commands; You know the proverb, “Princes have long hands.” My fame's my burden; for the more I'm praised, A juster ground of jealousy is raised. Were I less fair, I might have been more blest; Great beauty through great danger is possest. To leave me here his venture was not hard, Because he thought my virtue was my guard. He feared my face, but trusted to my life; The beauty doubted, but believed the wife. You bid me use the occasion while I can, Put in our hands by the good easy man. I would, and yet I doubt, 'twixt love and fear; One draws me from you, and one brings me near. Our flames are mutual, and my husband's gone; The nights are long; I fear to lie alone. One house contains us, and weak walls divide, And you're too pressing to be long denied. Let me not live, but every thing conspires To join our loves, and yet my fear retires. You court with words, when you should force employ; A rape is requisite to shame-faced joy. Indulgent to the wrongs which we receive, Our sex can suffer what we dare not give.— What have I said? for both of us 'twere best, Our kindling fire if each of us supprest. The faith of strangers is too prone to change, And, like themselves, their wandering passions range. Hysipyle, and the fond Minonian maid, Were both by trusting of their guests betrayed. How can I doubt that other men deceive, When you yourself did fair Œnone leave? But lest I should upbraid your treachery, You make a merit of that crime to me. Yet grant you were to faithful love inclined, Your weary Trojans wait but for a wind; Should you prevail, while I assign the night, Your sails are hoisted, and you take your flight; Some bawling mariner our love destroys, And breaks asunder our unfinished joys. But I with you may leave the Spartan port, To view the Trojan wealth and Priam's court; Shown while I see, I shall expose my fame, And fill a foreign country with my shame. In Asia what reception shall I find? And what dishonour leave in Greece behind? What will your brothers, Priam, Hecuba, And what will all your modest matrons say? E'en you, when on this action you reflect, My future conduct justly may suspect; And whate'er stranger lands upon your coast, Conclude me, by your own example, lost. I from your rage a strumpet's name shall hear, While you forget what part in it you bear. You, my crime's author, will my crime upbraid;— Deep under ground, oh, let me first be laid! You boast the pomp and plenty of your land, And promise all shall be at my command; Your Trojan wealth, believe me, I despise; My own poor native land has dearer ties. Should I be injured on your Phrygian shore, What help of kindred could I there implore? Medea was by Jason's flattery won; I may, like her, believe, and be undone. Plain honest hearts, like mine, suspect no cheat, And love contributes to its own deceit; The ships, about whose sides loud tempests roar, With gentle winds were wafted from the shore. Your teeming mother dreamed, a flaming brand, Sprung from her womb, consumed the Trojan land; To second this, old prophecies conspire, That Ilium shall be burnt with Grecian fire: Both give me fear; nor is it much allayed, That Venus is obliged our loves to aid. For they, who lost their cause, revenge will take; And for one friend two enemies you make. Nor can I doubt, but, should I follow you, The sword would soon our fatal crime pursue. A wrong so great my husband's rage would rouse, And my relations would his cause espouse. You boast your strength and courage; but, alas! Your words receive small credit from your face. Let heroes in the dusty field delight, Those limbs were fashioned for another fight. Bid Hector sally from the walls of Troy; A sweeter quarrel should your arms employ. Yet fears like these should not my mind perplex, Were I as wise as many of my sex; But time and you may bolder thoughts inspire, And I, perhaps, may yield to your desire. You last demand a private conference; These are your words, but I can guess your sense. Your unripe hopes their harvest must attend; Be ruled by me, and time may be your friend. This is enough to let you understand; For now my pen has tired my tender hand. My woman knows the secret of my heart, And may hereafter better news impart. DIDO TO ÆNEAS. EPIST. VII. THE ARGUMENT. Æneas, the son of Venus and Anchises, having, at the destruction of Troy, saved his Gods, his father, and son Ascanius, from the fire, put to sea with twenty sail of ships; and, having been long tost with tempests, was at last cast upon the shore of Libya, where Queen Dido (flying from the cruelty of Pygmalion, her brother, who had killed her husband Sichæus) had lately built Carthage. She entertained Æneas and his fleet with great civility, fell passionately in love with him, and in the end denied him not the last favours. But Mercury admonishing Æneas to go in search of Italy (a kingdom promised him by the Gods), he readily prepared to follow him. Dido soon perceived it, and, having in vain tried all other means to engage him to stay, at last, in despair, writes to him as follows. So, on Mæander's banks, when death is nigh, The mournful swan sings her own elegy. Not that I hope (for, oh, that hope were vain!) By words your lost affection to regain; But, having lost whate'er was worth my care, Why should I fear to lose a dying prayer? 'Tis then resolved poor Dido must be left, Of life, of honour, and of love bereft! While you, with loosened sails, and vows, prepare To seek a land that flies the searcher's care; Nor can my rising towers your flight restrain, Nor my new empire, offered you in vain. Built walls you shun, unbuilt you seek; that land Is yet to conquer, but you this command. Suppose you landed where your wish designed, Think what reception foreigners would find, What people is so void of common sense, To vote succession from a native prince? Yet there new sceptres and new loves you seek, New vows to plight, and plighted vows to break. When will your towers the height of Carthage know? Or when your eyes discern such crowds below? If such a town and subjects you could see, Still would you want a wife who loved liked me. For, oh! I burn, like fires with incense bright; Not holy tapers flame with purer light. Æneas is my thoughts' perpetual theme, Their daily longing, and their nightly dream. Yet he's ungrateful and obdurate still; Fool that I am to place my heart so ill! Myself I cannot to myself restore; Still I complain, and still I love him more. Have pity, Cupid, on my bleeding heart, And pierce thy brother's with an equal dart. I rave; nor canst thou Venus' offspring be, Love's mother could not bear a son like thee. From hardened oak, or from a rock's cold womb, At least thou art from some fierce tigress come; Or on rough seas, from their foundation torn, Got by the winds, and in a tempest born: Like that, which now thy trembling sailors fear; Like that, whose rage should still detain thee here. Behold how high the foamy billows ride! The winds and waves are on the juster side. To winter weather, and a stormy sea, I'll owe what rather I would owe to thee. Death thou deserv'st from heaven's avenging laws; But I'm unwilling to become the cause. To shun my love, if thou wilt seek thy fate, 'Tis a dear purchase, and a costly hate. Stay but a little, till the tempest cease, And the loud winds are lulled into a peace. May all thy rage, like theirs, inconstant prove! And so it will, if there be power in love. Know'st thou not yet what dangers ships sustain? So often wrecked, how darest thou tempt the main? Which were it smooth, were every wave asleep, Ten thousand forms of death are in the deep. In that abyss the gods their vengeance store, For broken vows of those who falsely swore; There winged storms on sea-born Venus wait, To vindicate the justice of her state. Thus I to thee the means of safety show; And, lost myself, would still preserve my foe. False as thou art, I not thy death design; O rather live, to be the cause of mine! Should some avenging storm thy vessel tear, (But heaven forbid my words should omen bear!) Then in thy face thy perjured vows would fly, And my wronged ghost be present to thy eye; With threatening looks think thou behold'st me stare, Gasping my mouth, and clotted all my hair. Then, should forked lightning and red thunder fall, What couldst thou say, but, “I deserved them all”? Lest this should happen, make not haste away; To shun the danger will be worth thy stay. Have pity on thy son, if not on me; My death alone is guilt enough for thee. What has his youth, what have thy gods deserved, To sink in seas, who were from fires preserved? But neither gods nor parent didst thou bear; Smooth stories all, to please a woman's ear, False as the tale of thy romantic life. Nor yet am I thy first-deluded wife; Left to pursuing foes Cerusa stayed, By thee, base man, forsaken and betrayed. This, when thou told'st me, struck my tender heart, That such requital followed such desert. Nor doubt I but the gods, for crimes like these, Seven winters kept thee wandering on the seas. Thy starved companions, cast ashore, I fed, Thyself admitted to my crown and bed. To harbour strangers, succour the distrest, Was kind enough; but, oh, too kind the rest! Curst be the cave which first my ruin brought, Where, from the storm, we common shelter sought! A dreadful howling echoed round the place; The mountain nymphs, thought I, my nuptial grace. I thought so then, but now too late I know The furies yelled my funerals from below. O chastity and violated fame, Exact your dues to my dead husband's name! By death redeem my reputation lost, And to his arms restore my guilty ghost! Close by my palace, in a gloomy grove, Is raised a chapel to my murdered love; There, wreathed with boughs and wool, his statue stands, The pious monument of artful hands. Last night, methought, he called me from the dome, And thrice, with hollow voice, cried, “Dido, come!”— She comes; thy wife thy lawful summons hears, But comes more slowly, clogged with conscious fears. Forgive the wrong I offered to thy bed; Strong were his charms, who my weak faith misled. His goddess mother, and his aged sire Borne on his back, did to my fall conspire. Oh! such he was, and is, that, were he true, Without a blush I might his love pursue; But cruel stars my birthday did attend, And, as my fortune opened, it must end. My plighted lord was at the altar slain, Whose wealth was made my bloody brother's gain; Friendless, and followed by the murderer's hate, To foreign countries I removed my fate; And here, a suppliant, from the natives' hands I bought the ground on which my city stands, With all the coast that stretches to the sea, E'en to the friendly port that sheltered thee; Then raised these walls, which mount into the air, At once my neighbours' wonder, and their fear. For now they arm; and round me leagues are made, My scarce established empire to invade. To man my new-built walls I must prepare, An helpless woman, and unskilled in war. Yet thousand rivals to my love pretend, And for my person would my crown defend; Whose jarring votes in one complaint agree, That each unjustly is disdained for thee. To proud Hyarbas give me up a prey, For that must follow, if thou goest away; Or to my husband's murderer leave my life, That to the husband he may add the wife. Go then, since no complaints can move thy mind; Go, perjured man, but leave thy gods behind. Touch not those gods, by whom thou art forsworn, Who will in impious hands no more be borne; Thy sacrilegious worship they disdain, And rather would the Grecian fires sustain. Perhaps my greatest shame is still to come, And part of thee lies hid within my womb; The babe unborn must perish by thy hate, And perish, guiltless, in his mother's fate. Some god, thou sayest, thy voyage does command; Would the same god had barred thee from my land! The same, I doubt not, thy departure steers, Who kept thee out at sea so many years; While thy long labours were a price so great, As thou, to purchase Troy, wouldst not repeat. But Tiber now thou seek'st, to be at best, When there arrived, a poor precarious guest. Yet it deludes thy search; perhaps it will To thy old age lie undiscovered still. A ready crown and wealth in dower I bring, And, without conquering, here thou art a king. Here thou to Carthage may'st transfer thy Troy; Here young Ascanius may his arms employ; And, while we live secure in soft repose, Bring many laurels home from conquered foes. By Cupid's arrows, I adjure thee stay! By all the gods, companions of thy way! So may thy Trojans, who are yet alive, Live still, and with no future fortune strive; So may thy youthful son old age attain, And thy dead father's bones in peace remain; As thou hast pity on unhappy me, Who knew no crime, but too much love of thee. I am not born from fierce Achilles' line, Nor did my parents against Troy combine. To be thy wife if I unworthy prove, By some inferior name admit my love. To be secured of still possessing thee, What would I do, and what would I not be! Our Libyan coasts their certain seasons know, When, free from tempests, passengers may go; But now with northern blasts the billows roar, And drive the floating sea-weed to the shore. Leave to my care the time to sail away; When safe, I will not suffer thee to stay. Thy weary men would be with ease content; Their sails are tattered, and their masts are spent. If by no merit I thy mind can move, What thou deniest my merit, give my love. Stay, till I learn my loss to undergo, And give me time to struggle with my woe: If not, know this, I will not suffer long; My life's too loathsome, and my love too strong. Death holds my pen, and dictates what I say, While cross my lap the Trojan sword I lay. My tears flow down; the sharp edge cuts their flood, And drinks my sorrows, that must drink my blood. How well thy gift does with my fate agree! My funeral pomp is cheaply made by thee. To no new wounds my bosom I display; The sword but enters where love made the way. But thou, dear sister, and yet dearer friend, Shalt my cold ashes to their urn attend. Sichæus' wife let not the marble boast; I lost that title, when my fame I lost. This short inscription only let it bear; “Unhappy Dido lies in quiet here. The cause of death, and sword by which she died, Æneas gave; the rest her arm supplied.” TRANSLATIONS FROM OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD RADCLIFFE. THE FIRST BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. Of bodies changed to various forms I sing:— Ye gods, from whom these miracles did spring, Inspire my numbers with celestial heat, Till I my long laborious work complete; And add perpetual tenor to my rhymes, Deduced from nature's birth to Cæsar's times. Before the seas, and this terrestrial ball, And heaven's high canopy, that covers all, One was the face of nature, if a face; Rather a rude and indigested mass; A lifeless lump, unfashioned, and unframed, Of jarring seeds, and justly chaos named. No sun was lighted up the world to view; No moon did yet her blunted horns renew; Nor yet was earth suspended in the sky, Nor, poised, did on her own foundations lie; Nor seas about the shores their arms had thrown; But earth, and air, and water, were in one. Thus air was void of light, and earth unstable, And water's dark abyss unnavigable. No certain form on any was imprest; All were confused, and each disturbed the rest: For hot and cold were in one body fixed; And soft with hard, and light with heavy, mixed. But God, or Nature, while they thus contend, To these intestine discords put an end. Then earth from air, and seas from earth, were driven, And grosser air sunk from ethereal heaven. Thus disembroiled, they take their proper place; The next of kin contiguously embrace; And foes are sundered by a larger space. The force of fire ascended first on high, And took its dwelling in the vaulted sky. Then air succeeds, in lightness next to fire, Whose atoms from unactive earth retire. Earth sinks beneath, and draws a numerous throng, Of ponderous, thick unwieldy seeds along. About her coasts unruly waters roar, And, rising on a ridge, insult the shore. Thus when the God, whatever God was he, Had formed the whole, and made the parts agree, That no unequal portions might be found, He moulded earth into a spacious round; Then, with a breath, he gave the winds to blow, And bade the congregated waters flow: He adds the running springs, and standing lakes, And bounding banks for winding rivers makes. Some part in earth are swallowed up, the most In ample oceans, disembogued, are lost: He shades the woods, the valleys he restrains With rocky mountains, and extends the plains. And as five zones the ethereal regions bind, Five, correspondent, are to earth assigned; The sun, with rays directly darting down, Fires all beneath, and fries the middle zone: The two beneath the distant poles complain Of endless winter, and perpetual rain. Betwixt the extremes, two happier climates hold The temper that partakes of hot and cold. The fields of liquid air, inclosing all, Surround the compass of this earthly ball: The lighter parts lie next the fires above; The grosser near the watery surface move: Thick clouds are spread, and storms engender there, And thunder's voice, which wretched mortals fear, And winds that on their wings cold winter bear. Nor were those blustering brethren left at large, On seas and shores their fury to discharge: Bound as they are, and circumscribed in place, They rend the world, resistless, where they pass, And mighty marks of mischief leave behind; Such is the rage of their tempestuous kind. First, Eurus to the rising morn is sent, (The regions of the balmy continent,) And Eastern realms, where early Persians run, To greet the blest appearance of the sun. Westward the wanton Zephyr wings his flight, Pleased with the remnants of departing light; Fierce Boreas with his offspring issues forth, To invade the frozen waggon of the North; While frowning Auster seeks the Southern sphere, And rots, with endless rain, the unwholesome year. High o'er the clouds, and empty realms of wind, The God a clearer space for heaven designed; Where fields of light and liquid ether flow, Purged from the ponderous dregs of earth below. Scarce had the Power distinguished these, when straight The stars, no longer overlaid with weight, Exert their heads from underneath the mass, And upward shoot, and kindle as they pass, And with diffusive light adorn their heavenly place. Then, every void of nature to supply, With forms of gods he fills the vacant sky: New herds of beasts he sends, the plains to share; New colonies of birds, to people air; And to their oozy beds the finny fish repair. A creature of a more exalted kind Was wanting yet, and then was man designed; Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast, For empire formed, and fit to rule the rest: Whether with particles of heavenly fire The God of nature did his soul inspire; Or earth, but new divided from the sky, And pliant still, retained the ethereal energy; Which wise Prometheus tempered into paste, And, mixed with living streams, the god-like image cast. Thus, while the mute creation downward bend Their sight, and to their earthy mother tend, Man looks aloft, and, with erected eyes, Beholds his own hereditary skies.— From such rude principles our form began, And earth was metamorphosed into man. The Golden Age. The Golden Age was first; when man, yet new, No rule but uncorrupted reason knew; And, with a native bent, did good pursue. Unforced by punishment, unawed by fear, His words were simple, and his soul sincere. Needless was written law, where none opprest; The law of man was written in his breast. No suppliant crowds before the judge appeared; No court erected yet, nor cause was heard; But all was safe, for conscience was their guard. The mountain trees in distant prospect please, Ere yet the pine descended to the seas; Ere sails were spread, new oceans to explore; And happy mortals, unconcerned for more, Confined their wishes to their native shore. No walls were yet, nor fence, nor moat, nor mound; Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound; Nor swords were forged; but, void of care and crime, The soft creation slept away their time. The teeming earth, yet guiltless of the plough, And unprovoked, did fruitful stores allow: Content with food, which nature freely bred, On wildings and on strawberries they fed; Cornels and bramble-berries gave the rest, And falling acorns furnished out a feast. The flowers, unsown, in fields and meadows reigned; And western winds immortal spring maintained. In following years the bearded corn ensued From earth unasked, nor was that earth renewed. From veins of valleys milk and nectar broke, And honey sweating through the pores of oak. The Silver Age. But when good Saturn, banished from above, Was driven to hell, the world was under Jove. Succeeding times a Silver Age behold, Excelling brass, but more excelled by gold. Then Summer, Autumn, Winter did appear, And Spring was but a season of the year. The sun his annual course obliquely made, Good days contracted, and enlarged the bad. Then air with sultry heats began to glow, The wings of winds were clogged with ice and snow; And shivering mortals, into houses driven, Sought shelter from the inclemency of heaven. Those houses, then, were caves, or homely sheds, With twining osiers fenced, and moss their beds. Then ploughs for seed the fruitful furrows broke, And oxen laboured first beneath the yoke. The Brazen Age. To this next came in course the Brazen Age: A warlike offspring prompt to bloody rage, Not impious yet.— The Iron Age. —Hard Steel succeeded then; And stubborn as the metal were the men. Truth, modesty, and shame, the world forsook; Fraud, avarice, and force, their places took. Then sails were spread to every wind that blew; Raw were the sailors, and the depths were new: Trees, rudely hollowed, did the waves sustain, Ere ships in triumph ploughed the watery plain. Then landmarks limited to each his right; For all before was common as the light. Nor was the ground alone required to bear Her annual income to the crooked share; But greedy mortals, rummaging her store, Digged from her entrails first the precious ore; Which next to hell the prudent gods had laid, And that alluring ill to sight displayed. Thus cursed Steel, and more accursed Gold, Gave mischief birth, and made that mischief bold; And double death did wretched man invade, By steel assaulted, and by gold betrayed. Now (brandished weapons glittering in their hands) Mankind is broken loose from moral bands: No rights of hospitality remain, The guest, by him who harboured him, is slain; The son-in-law pursues the father's life; The wife her husband murders, he the wife; The step-dame poison for the son prepares; The son inquires into his father's years. Faith flies, and Piety in exile mourns: And Justice, here oppressed, to heaven returns. The Giants' War. Nor were the Gods themselves more safe above; Against beleaguered heaven the Giants move. Hills piled on hills, on mountains mountains lie, To make their mad approaches to the sky: Till Jove, no longer patient, took his time To avenge with thunder their audacious crime; Red lightning played along the firmament, And their demolished works to pieces rent. Singed with the flames, and with the bolts transfixed, With native earth their blood the monsters mixed; The blood, endued with animating heat, Did in the impregnate earth new sons beget; They, like the seed from which they sprung, accursed, Against the gods immortal hatred nursed; An impious, arrogant, and cruel brood, Expressing their original from blood. Which when the King of Gods beheld from high, (Withal revolving in his memory, What he himself had found on earth of late, Lycaon's guilt, and his inhuman treat,) He sighed, nor longer with his pity strove, But kindled to a wrath becoming Jove: Then called a general council of the gods; Who, summoned, issue from their blest abodes, And fill the assembly with a shining train. A way there is in heaven's expanded plain, Which, when the skies are clear, is seen below, And mortals by the name of Milky know. The ground-work is of stars; through which the road Lies open to the Thunderer's abode. The gods of greater nations dwell around, And on the right and left the palace bound; The commons where they can; the nobler sort, With winding doors wide open, front the court. This place, as far as earth with heaven may vie, I dare to call the Louvre of the sky. When all were placed, in seats distinctly known, And he, their father, had assumed the throne, Upon his ivory sceptre first he leant, Then shook his head, that shook the firmament; Air, earth, and seas obeyed the almighty nod, And with a general fear confessed the God. At length, with indignation, thus he broke His awful silence, and the Powers bespoke. “I was not more concerned in that debate Of empire, when our universal state Was put to hazard, and the giant race Our captive skies were ready to embrace: For, though the foe was fierce, the seeds of all Rebellion sprung from one original; Now wheresoever ambient waters glide, All are corrupt, and all must be destroyed. Let me this holy protestation make, By hell, and hell's inviolable lake! I tried whatever in the Godhead lay; But gangrened members must be lopt away, Before the nobler parts are tainted to decay. There dwells below a race of demi-gods, Of nymphs in waters, and of fauns in woods; Who, though not worthy yet in heaven to live, Let them at least enjoy that earth we give. Can these be thought securely lodged below, When I myself, who no superior know, I, who have heaven and earth at my command, Have been attempted by Lycaon's hand?” At this a murmur through the synod went, And with one voice they vote his punishment. Thus, when conspiring traitors dared to doom The fall of Cæsar, and in him of Rome, The nations trembled with a pious fear, All anxious for their earthly thunderer;— Nor was their care, O Cæsar, less esteemed By thee, than that of heaven for Jove was deemed; Who with his hand, and voice, did first restrain Their murmurs, then resumed his speech again. The Gods to silence were composed, and sat With reverence due to his superior state. “Cancel your pious cares; already he Has paid his debt to justice, and to me. Yet what his crimes, and what my judgments were, Remains for me thus briefly to declare. The clamours of this vile degenerate age, The cries of orphans, and the oppressor's rage, Had reached the stars; ‘I will descend,’ said I, ‘In hope to prove this loud complaint a lie.’ Disguised in human shape, I travelled round The world, and more than what I heard, I found. O'er Mænalus I took my steepy way, By caverns infamous for beasts of prey; Then crossed Cyllene, and the piny shade, More infamous by curst Lycaon made; Dark night had covered heaven and earth, before I entered his unhospitable door. Just at my entrance, I displayed the sign That somewhat was approaching of divine. The prostrate people pray; the tyrant grins; And, adding profanation to his sins, ‘I'll try,’ said he, ‘and if a God appear, To prove his deity shall cost him dear.’ 'Twas late; the graceless wretch my death prepares, When I should soundly sleep, opprest with cares: This dire experiment he chose, to prove If I were mortal, or undoubted Jove. But first he had resolved to taste my power: Not long before, but in a luckless hour, Some legates, sent from the Molossian state, Were on a peaceful errand come to treat; Of these he murders one, he boils the flesh, And lays the mangled morsels in a dish; Some part he roasts; then serves it up so drest, And bids me welcome to this human feast. Moved with disdain, the table I o'erturned, And with avenging flames the palace burned. The tyrant, in a fright, for shelter gains The neighbouring fields, and scours along the plains. Howling he fled, and fain he would have spoke, But human voice his brutal tongue forsook. About his lips the gathered foam he churns, And, breathing slaughter, still with rage he burns, But on the bleating flock his fury turns. His mantle, now his hide, with rugged hairs Cleaves to his back; a famished face he bears; His arms descend, his shoulders sink away, To multiply his legs for chase of prey. He grows a wolf, his hoariness remains, And the same rage in other members reigns. His eyes still sparkle in a narrower space, His jaws retain the grin, and violence of his face. “This was a single ruin, but not one Deserves so just a punishment alone. Mankind's a monster, and the ungodly times, Confederate into guilt, are sworn to crimes. All are alike involved in ill, and all Must by the same relentless fury fall.” Thus ended he; the greater gods assent, By clamours urging his severe intent; The less fill up the cry for punishment. Yet still with pity they remember man, And mourn as much as heavenly spirits can. They ask, when those were lost of human birth, What he would do with all this waste of earth? If his dispeopled world he would resign To beasts, a mute, and more ignoble line? Neglected altars must no longer smoke, If none were left to worship and invoke. To whom the Father of the Gods replied: “Lay that unnecessary fear aside; Mine be the care new people to provide. I will from wondrous principles ordain A race unlike the first, and try my skill again.” Already had he tossed the flaming brand, And rolled the thunder in his spacious hand, Preparing to discharge on seas and land; But stopp'd, for fear, thus violently driven, The sparks should catch his axle-tree of heaven; Rememb'ring, in the Fates, a time, when fire Should to the battlements of heaven aspire, And all his blazing worlds above should burn, And all the inferior globe to cinders turn. His dire artillery thus dismissed, he bent His thoughts to some securer punishment; Concludes to pour a watery deluge down, And, what he durst not burn, resolves to drown. The Northern breath, that freezes floods, he binds, With all the race of cloud-dispelling winds; The South he loosed, who night and horror brings, And fogs are shaken from his flaggy wings. From his divided beard two streams he pours; His head and rheumy eyes distil in showers; With rain his robe and heavy mantle flow, And lazy mists are low'ring on his brow. Still as he swept along, with his clenched fist, He squeezed the clouds; the imprisoned clouds resist; The skies, from pole to pole, with peals resound, And showers enlarged come pouring on the ground. Then clad in colours of a various dye, Junonian Iris breeds a new supply To feed the clouds: impetuous rain descends; The bearded corn beneath the burden bends; Defrauded clowns deplore their perished grain, And the long labours of the year are vain. Nor from his patrimonial heaven alone Is Jove content to pour his vengeance down; Aid from his brother of the seas he craves, To help him with auxiliary waves. The watery tyrant calls his brooks and floods, Who roll from mossy caves, their moist abodes; And with perpetual urns his palace fill: To whom, in brief, he thus imparts his will. “Small exhortation needs; your powers employ, And this bad world (so Jove requires) destroy. Let loose the reins to all your watery store; Bear down the dams, and open every door.” The floods, by nature enemies to land, And proudly swelling with their new command, Remove the living stones that stopped their way, And, gushing from their source, augment the sea. Then, with his mace, their monarch struck the ground; With inward trembling earth received the wound, And rising streams a ready passage found. The expanded waters gather on the plain, They float the fields, and overtop the grain; Then rushing onwards, with a sweepy sway, Bear flocks, and folds, and labouring hinds, away. Nor safe their dwellings were; for sapp'd by floods, Their houses fell upon their household gods. The solid piles, too strongly built to fall, High o'er their heads behold a watery wall. Now seas and earth were in confusion lost; A world of waters, and without a coast. One climbs a cliff; one in his boat is borne, And ploughs above, where late he sowed his corn. Others o'er chimney-tops and turrets row, And drop their anchors on the meads below; Or, downward driven, they bruise the tender vine, Or, tossed aloft, are knocked against a pine; And where of late the kids had cropped the grass, The monsters of the deep now take their place. Insulting Nereids on the cities ride, And wondering dolphins o'er the palace glide; On leaves, and masts of mighty oaks, they browse; And their broad fins entangle in the boughs. The frighted wolf now swims among the sheep; The yellow lion wanders in the deep; His rapid force no longer helps the boar; The stag swims faster than he ran before. The fowls, long beating on their wings in vain, Despair of land, and drop into the main. Now hills and vales no more distinction know, And levelled nature lies oppressed below. The most of mortals perish in the flood, The small remainder dies for want of food. A mountain of stupendous height there stands Betwixt the Athenian and Bœotian lands, The bound of fruitful fields, while fields they were, But then a field of waters did appear: Parnassus is its name, whose forky rise Mounts through the clouds, and mates the lofty skies. High on the summit of this dubious cliff, Deucalion wafting moored his little skiff. He with his wife were only left behind Of perished man; they two were humankind. The mountain-nymphs and Themis they adore, And from her oracles relief implore. The most upright of mortal men was he; The most sincere and holy woman, she. When Jupiter, surveying earth from high, Beheld it in a lake of water lie, That where so many millions lately lived, But two, the best of either sex, survived, He loosed the northern wind; fierce Boreas flies To puff away the clouds, and purge the skies; Serenely, while he blows, the vapours driven Discover heaven to earth, and earth to heaven. The billows fall, while Neptune lays his mace On the rough sea, and smooths its furrowed face. Already Triton, at his call, appears Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears; And in his hand a crooked trumpet bears. The sovereign bids him peaceful sounds inspire, And give the waves the signal to retire. His writhen shell he takes, whose narrow vent Grows by degrees into a large extent; Then gives it breath; the blast, with doubling sound, Runs the wide circuit of the world around. The sun first heard it, in his early east, And met the rattling echoes in the west, The waters, listening to the trumpet's roar, Obey the summons, and forsake the shore. A thin circumference of land appears; And earth, but not at once, her visage rears, And peeps upon the seas from upper grounds: The streams, but just contained within their bounds, By slow degrees into their channels crawl, And earth increases as the waters fall. In longer time the tops of trees appear, Which mud on their dishonoured branches bear. At length the world was all restored to view, But desolate, and of a sickly hue: Nature beheld herself, and stood aghast, A dismal desert, and a silent waste. Which when Deucalion, with a piteous look, Beheld, he wept, and thus to Pyrrha spoke: “O wife, O sister, oh, of all thy kind, The best and only creature left behind, By kindred, love, and now by dangers joined; Of multitudes, who breathed the common air, We two remain, a species in a pair: The rest the seas have swallowed; nor have we E'en of this wretched life a certainty. The clouds are still above; and, while I speak, A second deluge o'er our heads may break. Should I be snatched from hence, and thou remain, Without relief, or partner of thy pain, How couldst thou such a wretched life sustain? Should I be left, and thou be lost, the sea, That buried her I loved, should bury me. Oh could our father his old arts inspire, And make me heir of his informing fire, That so I might abolished man retrieve, And perished people in new souls might live! But heaven is pleased, nor ought we to complain, That we, the examples of mankind, remain.” He said; the careful couple join their tears, And then invoke the gods, with pious prayers. Thus in devotion having eased their grief, From sacred oracles they seek relief, And to Cephisus' brook their way pursue; The stream was troubled, but the ford they knew. With living waters in the fountain bred, They sprinkle first their garments, and their head, Then took the way which to the temple led. The roofs were all defiled with moss and mire, The desert altars void of solemn fire. Before the gradual prostrate they adored, The pavement kissed, and thus the saint implored. “O righteous Themis, if the powers above By prayers are bent to pity and to love; If human miseries can move their mind; If yet they can forgive, and yet be kind; Tell how we may restore, by second birth, Mankind, and people desolated earth.” Then thus the gracious goddess, nodding, said: “Depart, and with your vestments veil your head: And stooping lowly down, with loosened zones, Throw each behind your backs your mighty mother's bones.” Amazed the pair, and mute with wonder, stand, Till Pyrrha first refused the dire command. “Forbid it heaven,” said she, “that I should tear Those holy relics from the sepulchre.” They pondered the mysterious words again, For some new sense; and long they sought in vain. At length Deucalion cleared his cloudy brow, And said: “The dark enigma will allow A meaning, which, if well I understand, From sacrilege will free the god's command: This earth our mighty mother is, the stones In her capacious body are her bones; These we must cast behind.” With hope, and fear, The woman did the new solution hear: The man diffides in his own augury, And doubts the gods; yet both resolve to try. Descending from the mount, they first unbind Their vests, and, veiled, they cast the stones behind: The stones (a miracle to mortal view, But long tradition makes it pass for true,) Did first the rigour of their kind expel, And suppled into softness as they fell; Then swelled, and, swelling, by degrees grew warm, And took the rudiments of human form; Imperfect shapes, in marble such are seen, When the rude chisel does the man begin, While yet the roughness of the stone remains, Without the rising muscles, and the veins. The sappy parts, and next resembling juice, Were turned to moisture, for the body's use; Supplying humours, blood, and nourishment: The rest, too solid to receive a bent, Converts to bones; and what was once a vein, Its former name and nature did retain. By help of power divine, in little space, What the man threw, assumed a manly face; And what the wife, renewed the female race. Hence we derive our nature, born to bear Laborious life, and hardened into care. The rest of animals, from teeming earth Produced, in various forms received their birth. The native moisture, in its close retreat, Digested by the sun's ethereal heat, As in a kindly womb, began to breed; Then swelled, and quickened by the vital seed: And some in less, and some in longer space, Were ripened into form, and took a several face. Thus when the Nile from Pharian fields is fled, And seeks with ebbing tides his ancient bed, The fat manure with heavenly fire is warmed, And crusted creatures, as in wombs, are formed: These, when they turn the glebe, the peasants find: Some rude, and yet unfinished in their kind; Short of their limbs, a lame imperfect birth; One half alive, and one of lifeless earth. For, heat and moisture, when in bodies joined, The temper that results from either kind, Conception makes; and fighting, till they mix, Their mingled atoms in each other fix. Thus nature's hand the genial bed prepares, With friendly discord, and with fruitful wars. From hence the surface of the ground, with mud And slime besmeared, (the fæces of the flood,) Received the rays of heaven; and sucking in The seeds of heat, new creatures did begin. Some were of several sorts produced before; But of new monsters earth created more. Unwillingly, but yet she brought to light Thee, Python, too, the wondering world to fright, And the new nations with so dire a sight; So monstrous was his bulk, so large a space Did his vast body and long train embrace: Whom Phœbus basking on a bank espied. Ere now the god his arrows had not tried, But on the trembling deer, or mountain-goat; At this new quarry he prepares to shoot. Though every shaft took place, he spent the store Of his full quiver; and 'twas long before The expiring serpent wallowed in his gore. Then to preserve the fame of such a deed, For Python slain, he Pythian games decreed, Where noble youths for mastership should strive, To quoit, to run, and steeds and chariots drive. The prize was fame; in witness of renown, An oaken garland did the victor crown. The laurel was not yet for triumphs borne; But every green alike, by Phœbus worn, Did, with promiscuous grace, his flowing locks adorn. The Transformation of Daphne into a Laurel. The first and fairest of his loves was she, Whom not blind fortune, but the dire decree Of angry Cupid, forced him to desire; Daphne her name, and Peneus was her sire. Swelled with the pride that new success attends, He sees the stripling, while his bow he bends, And thus insults him: “Thou lascivious boy, Are arms like these for children to employ? Know, such achievements are my proper claim, Due to my vigour and unerring aim: Resistless are my shafts, and Python late, In such a feathered death, has found his fate. Take up thy torch, and lay my weapons by; With that the feeble souls of lovers fry.” To whom the son of Venus thus replied: “Phœbus, thy shafts are sure on all beside; But mine on Phœbus; mine the fame shall be Of all thy conquests, when I conquer thee.” He said, and soaring swiftly winged his flight; Nor stopped but on Parnassus' airy height. Two different shafts he from his quiver draws; One to repel desire, and one to cause. One shaft is pointed with refulgent gold, To bribe the love, and make the lover bold; One blunt, and tipt with lead, whose base allay Provokes disdain, and drives desire away. The blunted bolt against the nymph he drest; But with the sharp transfixed Apollo's breast. The enamoured deity pursues the chase; The scornful damsel shuns his loathed embrace: In hunting beasts of prey her youth employs, And Phœbus rivals in her rural joys. With naked neck she goes, and shoulders bare, And with a fillet binds her flowing hair. By many suitors sought, she mocks their pains, And still her vowed virginity maintains. Impatient of a yoke, the name of bride She shuns, and hates the joys she never tried. On wilds and woods she fixes her desire; Nor knows what youth and kindly love inspire. Her father chides her oft: “Thou ow'st,” says he, “A husband to thyself, a son to me.” She, like a crime, abhors the nuptial bed; She glows with blushes, and she hangs her head. Then, casting round his neck her tender arms, Soothes him with blandishments, and filial charms: “Give me, my lord,” she said, “to live and die A spotless maid, without the marriage-tie. 'Tis but a small request; I beg no more Than what Diana's father gave before.” The good old sire was softened to consent; But said her wish would prove her punishment; For so much youth, and so much beauty joined, Opposed the state which her desires designed. The God of Light, aspiring to her bed, Hopes what he seeks, with flattering fancies fed, And is by his own oracles misled. And as in empty fields the stubble burns, Or nightly travellers, when day returns, Their useless torches on dry hedges throw, That catch the flames, and kindle all the row; So burns the god, consuming in desire, And feeding in his breast a fruitless fire: Her well-turned neck he viewed, (her neck was bare,) And on her shoulders her dishevelled hair: “Oh, were it combed,” said he, “with what a grace Would every waving curl become her face!” He viewed her eyes, like heavenly lamps that shone; He viewed her lips, too sweet to view alone; Her taper fingers, and her panting breast: He praises all he sees; and for the rest, Believes the beauties yet unseen are best. Swift as the wind, the damsel fled away, Nor did for these alluring speeches stay. “Stay, nymph,” he cried; “I follow, not a foe: Thus from the lion trips the trembling doe; Thus from the wolf the frightened lamb removes, And from pursuing falcons fearful doves; Thou shunn'st a god, and shunn'st a god that loves. Ah! lest some thorn should pierce thy tender foot, Or thou shouldst fall in flying my pursuit, To sharp uneven ways thy steps decline, Abate thy speed, and I will bate of mine. Yet think from whom thou dost so rashly fly; Nor basely born, nor shepherd's swain am I. Perhaps thou know'st not my superior state, And from that ignorance proceeds thy hate. Me Claros, Delphos, Tenedos, obey; These hands the Patareian sceptre sway. The King of gods begot me: what shall be, Or is, or ever was, in fate, I see. Mine is the invention of the charming lyre; Sweet notes, and heavenly numbers, I inspire. Sure is my bow, unerring is my dart; But ah! more deadly his, who pierced my heart. Med'cine is mine, what herbs and simples grow In fields and forests, all their powers I know, And am the great physician called below. Alas, that fields and forests can afford No remedies to heal their love-sick lord! To cure the pains of love, no plant avails, And his own physic the physician fails.” She heard not half, so furiously she flies, And on her ear the imperfect accent dies. Fear gave her wings; and as she fled, the wind Increasing spread her flowing hair behind; And left her legs and thighs exposed to view, Which made the god more eager to pursue. The god was young, and was too hotly bent To lose his time in empty compliment; But led by love, and fired by such a sight, Impetuously pursued his near delight. As when the impatient greyhound, slipt from far, Bounds o'er the glebe, to course the fearful hare, She in her speed does all her safety lay, And he with double speed pursues the prey; O'erruns her at the sitting turn, and licks His chaps in vain, and blows upon the flix; She 'scapes, and for the neighbouring covert strives, And gaining shelter doubts if yet she lives. If little things with great we may compare, Such was the god, and such the flying fair: She, urged by fear, her feet did swiftly move, But he more swiftly, who was urged by love. He gathers ground upon her in the chase; Now breathes upon her hair, with nearer pace, And just is fastening on the wished embrace. The nymph grew pale, and in a mortal fright, Spent with the labour of so long a flight, And now despairing, cast a mournful look Upon the streams of her paternal brook: “Oh, help,” she cried, “in this extremest need, If water-gods are deities indeed! Gape, earth, and this unhappy wretch entomb, Or change my form, whence all my sorrows come.” Scarce had she finished, when her feet she found Benumbed with cold, and fastened to the ground; A filmy rind about her body grows, Her hair to leaves, her arms extend to boughs; The nymph is all into a Laurel gone, The smoothness of her skin remains alone. Yet Phœbus loves her still, and, casting round Her bole his arms, some little warmth he found. The tree still panted in the unfinished part, Not wholly vegetive, and heaved her heart. He fixed his lips upon the trembling rind; It swerved aside, and his embrace declined. To whom the god: “Because thou canst not be My mistress, I espouse thee for my tree: Be thou the prize of honour and renown; The deathless poet, and the poem, crown. Thou shalt the Roman festivals adorn, And, after poets, be by victors worn; Thou shalt returning Cæsar's triumph grace, When pomps shall in a long procession pass; Wreathed on the post before his palace wait, And be the sacred guardian of the gate: Secure from thunder, and unharmed by Jove, Unfading as the immortal powers above; And as the locks of Phœbus are unshorn, So shall perpetual green thy boughs adorn.” The grateful Tree was pleased with what he said, And shook the shady honours of her head. The Transformation of Io into an Heifer. An ancient forest in Thessalia grows, Which Tempe's pleasant valley does inclose; Through this the rapid Peneus takes his course, From Pindus rolling with impetuous force; Mists from the river's mighty fall arise, And deadly damps inclose the cloudy skies; Perpetual fogs are hanging o'er the wood, And sounds of waters deaf the neighbourhood. Deep in a rocky cave he makes abode; A mansion proper for a mourning god. Here he gives audience; issuing out decrees To rivers, his dependent deities. On this occasion hither they resort, To pay their homage, and to make their court; All doubtful, whether to congratulate His daughter's honour, or lament her fate. Spercheus, crowned with poplar, first appears; Then old Apidanus came, crowned with years; Enipeus turbulent, Amphrysos tame, And Æas, last, with lagging waters came. Then of his kindred brooks a numerous throng Condole his loss, and bring their urns along: Not one was wanting of the watery train, That filled his flood, or mingled with the main, But Inachus, who, in his cave alone, Wept not another's losses, but his own; For his dear Io, whether strayed, or dead, To him uncertain, doubtful tears he shed. He sought her through the world, but sought in vain; And nowhere finding, rather feared her slain. Her, just returning from her father's brook, Jove had beheld with a desiring look; And, “Oh, fair daughter of the flood,” he said, “Worthy alone of Jove's imperial bed, Happy whoever shall those charms possess! The King of gods (nor is thy lover less,) Invites thee to yon cooler shades, to shun The scorching rays of the meridian sun. Nor shalt thou tempt the dangers of the grove Alone without a guide; thy guide is Jove. No puny power, but he, whose high command Is unconfined, who rules the seas and land, And tempers thunder in his awful hand. Oh, fly not!”—for she fled from his embrace O'er Lerna's pastures; he pursued the chase, Along the shades of the Lyrcæan plain. At length the god, who never asks in vain, Involved with vapours, imitating night, Both air and earth; and then suppressed her flight, And, mingling force with love, enjoyed the full delight. Meantime the jealous Juno, from on high, Surveyed the fruitful fields of Arcady; And wondered that the mist should overrun The face of daylight and obscure the sun. No natural cause she found, from brooks or bogs, Or marshy lowlands, to produce the fogs: Then round the skies she sought for Jupiter, Her faithless husband; but no Jove was there. Suspecting now the worst,—“Or I,” she said, “Am much mistaken, or am much betrayed.” With fury she precipitates her flight, Dispels the shadows of dissembled night, And to the day restores his native light. The almighty lecher, careful to prevent The consequence, foreseeing her descent, Transforms his mistress in a trice; and now, In Io's place, appears a lovely cow. So sleek her skin, so faultless was her make, Even Juno did unwilling pleasure take To see so fair a rival of her love; And what she was, and whence, inquired of Jove, Of what fair herd, and from what pedigree? The god, half-caught, was forced upon a lie, And said she sprung from earth. She took the word, And begged the beauteous heifer of her lord. What should he do? 'twas equal shame to Jove, Or to relinquish, or betray his love; Yet to refuse so slight a gift, would be But more to increase his consort's jealousy. Thus fear, and love, by turns his heart assailed; And stronger love had sure at length prevailed, But some faint hope remained, his jealous queen Had not the mistress through the heifer seen. The cautious goddess, of her gift possest, Yet harboured anxious thoughts within her breast; As she, who knew the falsehood of her Jove, And justly feared some new relapse of love; Which to prevent, and to secure her care, To trusty Argus she commits the fair. The head of Argus (as with stars the skies,) Was compassed round, and wore an hundred eyes. But two by turns their lids in slumber steep; The rest on duty still their station keep; Nor could the total constellation sleep. Thus, ever present to his eyes and mind, His charge was still before him, though behind. In fields he suffered her to feed by day; But, when the setting sun to night gave way, The captive cow he summoned with a call, And drove her back, and tied her to the stall. On leaves of trees and bitter herbs she fed, Heaven was her canopy, bare earth her bed, So hardly lodged; and, to digest her food, She drank from troubled streams, defiled with mud. Her woful story fain she would have told, With hands upheld, but had no hands to hold. Her head to her ungentle keeper bowed, She strove to speak; she spoke not, but she lowed; Affrighted with the noise, she looked around, And seemed to inquire the author of the sound. Once on the banks where often she had played, (Her father's banks,) she came, and there surveyed Her altered visage, and her branching head; And starting from herself, she would have fled. Her fellow-nymphs, familiar to her eyes, Beheld, but knew her not in this disguise. Even Inachus himself was ignorant; And in his daughter did his daughter want. She followed where her fellows went, as she Were still a partner of the company: They stroke her neck; the gentle heifer stands, And her neck offers to their stroking hands. Her father gave her grass; the grass she took, And licked his palms, and cast a piteous look, And in the language of her eyes she spoke. She would have told her name, and asked relief, But, wanting words, in tears she tells her grief; Which with her foot she makes him understand, And prints the name of Io in the sand. “Ah, wretched me!” her mournful father cried; She, with a sigh, to “wretched me!” replied. About her milk-white neck his arms he threw, And wept, and then these tender words ensue. “And art thou she, whom I have sought around The world, and have at length so sadly found? So found, is worse than lost: with mutual words Thou answerest not, no voice thy tongue affords; But sighs are deeply drawn from out thy breast, And speech, denied, by lowing is expressed. Unknowing, I prepared thy bridal bed; With empty hopes of happy issue fed. But now the husband of a herd must be Thy mate, and bellowing sons thy progeny. Oh, were I mortal, death might bring relief! But now my godhead but extends my grief; Prolongs my woes, of which no end I see, And makes me curse my immortality.” More had he said, but fearful of her stay, The starry guardian drove his charge away To some fresh pasture; on a hilly height He sat himself, and kept her still in sight. The Eyes of Argus transformed into a Peacock's Train. Now Jove no longer could her sufferings bear; But called in haste his airy messenger, The son of Maïa, with severe decree To kill the keeper, and to set her free. With all his harness soon the god was sped; His flying hat was fastened on his head; Wings on his heels were hung, and in his hand He holds the virtue of the snaky wand. The liquid air his moving pinions wound, And, in the moment, shoot him on the ground. Before he came in sight, the crafty god His wings dismissed, but still retained his rod: That sleep-procuring wand wise Hermes took, But made it seem to sight a shepherd's hook. With this he did a herd of goats control; Which by the way he met, and slyly stole. Clad like a country swain, he piped and sung; And, playing, drove his jolly troop along. With pleasure Argus the musician heeds; But wonders much at those new vocal reeds. And, “Whosoe'er thou art, my friend,” said he, “Up hither drive thy goats, and play by me; This hill has browse for them, and shade for thee.” The god, who was with ease induced to climb, Began discourse to pass away the time; And still, betwixt, his tuneful pipe he plies, And watched his hour, to close the keeper's eyes. With much ado, he partly kept awake; Not suffering all his eyes repose to take; And asked the stranger, who did reeds invent, And whence began so rare an instrument. The Transformation of Syrinx into Reeds. Then Hermes thus;—“A nymph of late there was, Whose heavenly form her fellows did surpass; The pride and joy of fair Arcadia's plains, Beloved by deities, adored by swains; Syrinx her name, by Sylvans oft pursued, As oft she did the lustful gods delude: The rural and the woodland powers disdained; With Cynthia hunted, and her rites maintained; Like Phœbe clad, even Phœbe's self she seems, So tall, so straight, such well-proportioned limbs: The nicest eye did no distinction know, But that the goddess bore a golden bow; Distinguished thus, the sight she cheated too. Descending from Lycæus, Pan admires The matchless nymph, and burns with new desires. A crown of pine upon his head he wore; And thus began her pity to implore. But ere he thus began, she took her flight So swift, she was already out of sight; Nor stayed to hear the courtship of the god, But bent her course to Ladon's gentle flood; There by the river stopt, and, tired before, Relief from water-nymphs her prayers implore. “Now while the lustful god, with speedy pace, Just thought to strain her in a strict embrace, He fills his arms with reeds, new rising on the place. And while he sighs his ill success to find, The tender canes were shaken by the wind; And breathed a mournful air, unheard before, That, much surprising Pan, yet pleased him more. Admiring this new music, ‘Thou,’ he said, ‘Who canst not be the partner of my bed, At least shall be the consort of my mind, And often, often, to my lips be joined.’ He formed the reeds, proportioned as they are; Unequal in their length, and waxed with care, They still retain the name of his ungrateful fair.” While Hermes piped, and sung, and told his tale, The keeper's winking eyes began to fail, And drowsy slumber on the lids to creep, Till all the watchman was at length asleep. Then soon the god his voice and song supprest, And with his powerful rod confirmed his rest; Without delay his crooked falchion drew, And at one fatal stroke the keeper slew. Down from the rock fell the dissevered head, Opening its eyes in death, and falling bled; And marked the passage with a crimson trail: Thus Argus lies in pieces, cold and pale; And all his hundred eyes, with all their light, Are closed at once, in one perpetual night. These Juno takes, that they no more may fail, And spreads them in her peacock's gaudy tail. Impatient to revenge her injured bed, She wreaks her anger on her rival's head; With furies frights her from her native home, And drives her gadding round the world to roam: Nor ceased her madness and her flight, before She touched the limits of the Pharian shore. At length, arriving on the banks of Nile, Wearied with length of ways, and worn with toil, She laid her down; and leaning on her knees, Invoked the cause of all her miseries; And cast her languishing regards above, For help from heaven, and her ungrateful Jove. She sighed, she wept, she lowed; 'twas all she could; And with unkindness seemed to tax the god. Last, with an humble prayer, she begged repose, Or death at least to finish all her woes. Jove heard her vows, and with a flattering look, In her behalf to jealous Juno spoke. He cast his arms about her neck, and said, “Dame, rest secure; no more thy nuptial bed This nymph shall violate; by Styx I swear, And every oath that binds the Thunderer.” The goddess was appeased; and at the word Was Io to her former shape restored. The rugged hair began to fall away; The sweetness of her eyes did only stay, Though not so large; her crooked horns decrease; The wideness of her jaws and nostrils cease; Her hoofs to hands return, in little space; The five long taper fingers take their place; And nothing of the heifer now is seen, Beside the native whiteness of the skin. Erected on her feet, she walks again, And two the duty of the four sustain. She tries her tongue, her silence softly breaks, And fears her former lowings when she speaks: A goddess now through all the Egyptian state, And served by priests, who in white linen wait. Her son was Epaphus, at length believed The son of Jove, and as a god received. With sacrifice adored, and public prayers, He common temples with his mother shares. Equal in years, and rival in renown With Epaphus, the youthful Phaeton Like honour claims, and boasts his sire the Sun. His haughty looks, and his assuming air, The son of Isis could no longer bear; “Thou tak'st thy mother's word too far,” said he, “And hast usurped thy boasted pedigree. Go, base pretender to a borrowed name!” Thus taxed, he blushed with anger, and with shame; But shame repressed his rage: the daunted youth Soon seeks his mother, and inquires the truth. “Mother,” said he, “this infamy was thrown By Epaphus on you, and me your son. He spoke in public, told it to my face, Nor durst I vindicate the dire disgrace: Even I, the bold, the sensible of wrong, Restrained by shame, was forced to hold my tongue; To hear an open slander, is a curse; But not to find an answer, is a worse. If I am heaven-begot, assert your son By some sure sign, and make my father known, To right my honour, and redeem your own.” He said, and, saying, cast his arms about Her neck, and begged her to resolve the doubt. 'Tis hard to judge if Clymene were moved More by his prayer, whom she so dearly loved, Or more with fury fired, to find her name Traduced, and made the sport of common fame. She stretched her arms to heaven, and fixed her eyes On that fair planet that adorns the skies; “Now by those beams,” said she, “whose holy fires Consume my breast, and kindle my desires; By him who sees us both, and cheers our sight, By him, the public minister of light, I swear that Sun begot thee; if I lie, Let him his cheerful influence deny; Let him no more this perjured creature see, And shine on all the world but only me. If still you doubt your mother's innocence, His eastern mansion is not far from hence; With little pains you to his levee go, And from himself your parentage may know.” With joy the ambitious youth his mother heard, And, eager for the journey, soon prepared. He longs the world beneath him to survey, To guide the chariot, and to give the day. From Meroe's burning sands he bends his course, Nor less in India feels his father's force; His travel urging, till he came in sight, And saw the palace by the purple light. MELEAGER AND ATALANTA, OUT OF THE EIGHTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. CONNECTION TO THE FORMER STORY. Ovid, having told how Theseus had freed Athens from the tribute of children, which was imposed on them by Minos, king of Crete, by killing the Minotaur, here makes a digression to the story of Meleager and Atalanta, which is one of the most inartificial connections in all the Metamorphoses; for he only says, that Theseus obtained such honour from that combat, that all Greece had recourse to him in their necessities; and, amongst others, Calydon, though the hero of that country, Prince Meleager, was then living. From him the Calydonians sought relief; Though valiant Meleagrus was their chief. The cause, a boar, who ravaged far and near; Of Cynthia's wrath, the avenging minister. For Œnius with autumnal plenty blessed, By gifts to heaven his gratitude expressed; Culled sheafs, to Ceres; to Lyæus, wine; To Pan and Pales, offered sheep and kine; And fat of olives to Minerva's shrine. Beginning from the rural gods, his hand Was liberal to the powers of high command; Each deity in every kind was blessed, Till at Diana's fane the invidious honour ceased. Wrath touches even the gods; the Queen of Night, Fired with disdain, and jealous of her right, “Unhonoured though I am, at least,” said she, “Not unrevenged that impious act shall be.” Swift as the word, she sped the boar away, With charge on those devoted fields to prey. No larger bulls the Egyptian pastures feed, And none so large Sicilian meadows breed: His eye-balls glare with fire, suffused with blood; His neck shoots up a thick-set thorny wood; His bristled back a trench impaled appears, And stands erected, like a field of spears; Froth fills his chaps, he sends a grunting sound, And part he churns, and part befoams the ground; For tusks with Indian elephants he strove, And Jove's own thunder from his mouth he drove. He burns the leaves; the scorching blast invades The tender corn, and shrivels up the blades; Or, suffering not their yellow beards to rear, He tramples down the spikes, and intercepts the year. In vain the barns expect their promised load, Nor barns at home, nor ricks are heaped abroad; In vain the hinds the threshing-floor prepare, And exercise their flails in empty air. With olives ever green the ground is strowed, And grapes ungathered shed their generous blood. Amid the fold he rages, nor the sheep Their shepherds, nor the grooms their bulls, can keep. From fields to walls the frighted rabble run, Nor think themselves secure within the town; Till Meleagrus, and his chosen crew, Contemn the danger, and the praise pursue. Fair Leda's twins, (in time to stars decreed,) One fought on foot, one curbed the fiery steed; Then issued forth famed Jason after these, Who manned the foremost ship that sailed the seas; Then Theseus, joined with bold Pirithous, came; A single concord in a double name: The Thestian sons, Idas, who swiftly ran, And Ceneus, once a woman, now a man. Lynceus, with eagle's eyes, and lion's heart; Leucippus, with his never-erring dart; Acastus, Phileus, Phœnix, Telamon, Echion, Lelex, and Eurytion, Achilles' father, and great Phocus' son; Dryas the fierce, and Hippasus the strong, With twice-old Iolas, and Nestor then but young; Laertes active, and Ancæus bold; Mopsus the sage, who future things foretold; And t'other seer, yet by his wife unsold. A thousand others of immortal fame; Among the rest, fair Atalanta came, Grace of the woods: a diamond buckle bound Her vest behind, that else had flow'd upon the ground, And show'd her buskin'd legs; her head was bare, But for her native ornament of hair, Which in a simple knot was tied above,— Sweet negligence, unheeded bait of love! Her sounding quiver on her shoulder tied, One hand a dart, and one a bow supplied. Such was her face, as in a nymph displayed A fair fierce boy, or in a boy betrayed The blushing beauties of a modest maid. The Calydonian chief at once the dame Beheld, at once his heart received the flame, With heavens averse. “O happy youth,” he cried, “For whom thy fates reserve so fair a bribe!” He sighed, and had no leisure more to say; His honour called his eyes another way, And force him to pursue the now neglected prey. There stood a forest on a mountain's brow, Which overlooked the shaded plains below; No sounding axe presumed those trees to bite, Coeval with the world, a venerable sight. The heroes there arrived, some spread around The toils, some search the footsteps on the ground, Some from the chains the faithful dogs unbound. Of action eager, and intent in thought, The chiefs their honourable danger sought: A valley stood below; the common drain Of waters from above, and falling rain; The bottom was a moist and marshy ground, Whose edges were with bending osiers crowned; The knotty bulrush next in order stood, And all within, of reeds a trembling wood. From hence the boar was roused, and sprung amain, Like lightning sudden on the warrior-train; Beats down the trees before him, shakes the ground, The forest echoes to the crackling sound; Shout the fierce youth, and clamours ring around. All stood with their protended spears prepared, With broad steel heads the brandished weapons glared. The beast impetuous with his tusks aside Deals glancing wounds; the fearful dogs divide; All spend their mouth aloft, but none abide. Echion threw the first, but missed his mark, And stuck his boar-spear on a maple's bark. Then Jason; and his javelin seemed to take, But failed with over-force, and whizzed above his back. Mopsus was next; but, ere he threw, addressed To Phœbus thus: “O patron, help thy priest! If I adore, and ever have adored Thy power divine, thy present aid afford, That I may reach the beast!”—The god allowed His prayer, and, smiling, gave him what he could: He reached the savage, but no blood he drew; Dian unarmed the javelin as it flew. This chafed the boar, his nostrils flames expire, And his red eye-balls roll with living fire. Whirled from a sling, or from an engine thrown, Amidst the foes so flies a mighty stone, As flew the beast: the left wing put to flight, The chiefs o'erborne, he rushes on the right. Empalamos and Pelagon he laid In dust, and next to death, but for their fellows' aid. Onesimus fared worse, prepared to fly; The fatal fang drove deep within his thigh, And cut the nerves; the nerves no more sustain The bulk; the bulk unpropp'd, falls headlong on the plain. Nestor had failed the fall of Troy to see, But, leaning on his lance, he vaulted on a tree; Then, gathering up his feet, looked down with fear, And thought his monstrous foe was still too near. Against a stump his tusk the monster grinds, And in the sharpened edge new vigour finds; Then, trusting to his arms, young Othrys found, And ranched his hips with one continued wound. Now Leda's twins, the future stars, appear; White were their habits, white their horses were; Conspicuous both, and both in act to throw, Their trembling lances brandished at the foe: Nor had they missed; but he to thickets fled, Concealed from aiming spears, not pervious to the steed. But Telamon rushed in, and happed to meet A rising root, that held his fastened feet; So down he fell, whom, sprawling on the ground, His brother from the wooden gyves unbound. Meantime the virgin-huntress was not slow To expel the shaft from her contracted bow. Beneath his ear the fastened arrow stood, And from the wound appeared the trickling blood. She blushed for joy: But Meleagrus raised His voice with loud applause, and the fair archer praised. He was the first to see, and first to show His friends the marks of the successful blow. “Nor shall thy valour want the praises due,” He said;—a virtuous envy seized the crew. They shout; the shouting animates their hearts, And all at once employ their thronging darts; But out of order thrown, in air they join, And multitude makes frustrate the design. With both his hands the proud Ancæus takes, And flourishes his double biting axe: Then forward to his fate, he took a stride Before the rest, and to his fellows cried,— “Give place, and mark the difference, if you can, Between a woman-warrior and a man; The boar is doomed; nor, though Diana lend Her aid, Diana can her beast defend.” Thus boasted he; then stretched, on tiptoe stood, Secure to make his empty promise good; But the more wary beast prevents the blow, And upward rips the groin of his audacious foe. Ancæus falls; his bowels from the wound Rush out, and clotted blood distains the ground. Pirithous, no small portion of the war, Pressed on, and shook his lance; to whom from far, Thus Theseus cried: “O stay, my better part, My more than mistress; of my heart, the heart! The strong may fight aloof: Ancæus tried His force too near, and by presuming died.” He said, and, while he spake, his javelin threw; Hissing in air, the unerring weapon flew; But on an arm of oak, that stood betwixt The marksman and the mark, his lance he fixt. Once more bold Jason threw, but failed to wound The boar, and slew an undeserving hound; And through the dog the dart was nailed to ground. Two spears from Meleager's hand were sent, With equal force, but various in the event; The first was fixed in earth, the second stood On the boar's bristled back, and deeply drank his blood. Now, while the tortured savage turns around, And flings about his foam, impatient of the wound, The wound's great author, close at hand, provokes His rage, and plies him with redoubled strokes; Wheels as he wheels, and with his pointed dart Explores the nearest passage to his heart. Quick, and more quick, he spins in giddy gyres, Then falls, and in much foam his soul expires. This act with shouts heaven high the friendly band Applaud, and strain in theirs the victor's hand. Then all approach the slain with vast surprise, Admire on what a breadth of earth he lies; And, scarce secure, reach out their spears afar, And blood their points, to prove their partnership of war. But he, the conquering chief, his foot impressed On the strong neck of that destructive beast; And gazing on the nymph with ardent eyes, “Accept,” said he, “fair Nonacrine, my prize; And, though inferior, suffer me to join My labours, and my part of praise, with thine.” At this presents her with the tusky head And chine, with rising bristles roughly spread. Glad, she received the gift; and seemed to take With double pleasure, for the giver's sake. The rest were seized with sullen discontent, And a deaf murmur through the squadron went: All envied; but the Thestian brethren showed The least respect, and thus they vent their spleen aloud: “Lay down those honoured spoils, nor think to share, Weak woman as thou art, the prize of war; Ours is the title, thine a foreign claim, Since Meleagrus from our lineage came. Trust not thy beauty; but restore the prize, Which he, besotted on that face and eyes, Would rend from us.” At this, inflamed with spite, From her they snatch the gift, from him the giver's right. But soon the impatient prince his falchion drew, And cried, “Ye robbers of another's due, Now learn the difference, at your proper cost, Betwixt true valour, and an empty boast.” At this advanced, and, sudden as the word, In proud Plexippus' bosom plunged the sword: Toxeus amazed, and with amazement slow, Or to revenge, or ward the coming blow, Stood doubting; and, while doubting thus he stood, Received the steel bathed in his brother's blood. Pleased with the first, unknown the second news, Althæa to the temples pays their dues For her son's conquest; when at length appear Her grisly brethren stretched upon the bier: Pale, at the sudden sight, she changed her cheer, And with her cheer her robes; but hearing tell The cause, the manner, and by whom they fell, 'Twas grief no more, or grief and rage were one Within her soul; at last 'twas rage alone; Which burning upwards, in succession dries The tears that stood considering in her eyes. There lay a log unlighted on the earth: When she was labouring in the throes of birth For the unborn chief, the Fatal Sisters came, And raised it up, and tossed it on the flame; Then on the rock a scanty measure place Of vital flax, and turned the wheel apace; And turning sung,—“To this red brand and thee, O new-born babe, we give an equal destiny;” So vanished out of view. The frighted dame Sprung hasty from her bed, and quenched the flame; The log, in secret locked, she kept with care, And that, while thus preserved, preserved her heir. This brand she now produced; and first she strows The hearth with heaps of chips, and after blows; Thrice heaved her hand, and heaved, she thrice repressed; The sister and the mother long contest, Two doubtful titles in one tender breast; And now her eyes and cheeks with fury glow, Now pale her cheeks, her eyes with pity flow; Now low'ring looks presage approaching storms, And now prevailing love her face reforms: Resolved, she doubts again; the tears, she dried With blushing rage, are by new tears supplied; And, as a ship, which winds and waves assail, Now with the current drives, now with the gale, Both opposite, and neither long prevail, She feels a double force; by turns obeys The imperious tempest, and the impetuous seas: So fares Althæa's mind; she first relents With pity, of that pity then repents: Sister and mother long the scales divide, But the beam nodded on the sister's side. Sometimes she softly sighed, then roared aloud; But sighs were stifled in the cries of blood. The pious impious wretch at length decreed, To please her brothers' ghosts, her son should bleed; And when the funeral flames began to rise, “Receive,” she said, “a sister's sacrifice; A mother's bowels burn:”—high in her hand, Thus while she spoke, she held the fatal brand; Then thrice before the kindled pile she bowed, And the three Furies thrice invoked aloud:— “Come, come, revenging sisters, come and view A sister paying her dead brothers' due; A crime I punish, and a crime commit; But blood for blood, and death for death, is fit: Great crimes must be with greater crimes repaid, And second funerals on the former laid. Let the whole household in one ruin fall, And may Diana's curse o'ertake us all. Shall fate to happy Œneus still allow One son, while Thestius stands deprived of two? Better three lost, than one unpunished go. Take then, dear ghosts, (while yet, admitted new In hell, you wait my duty,) take your due; A costly offering on your tomb is laid, When with my blood the price of yours is paid. “Ah! whither am I hurried? Ah! forgive, Ye shades, and let your sister's issue live: A mother cannot give him death; though he Deserves it, he deserves it not from me. “Then shall the unpunished wretch insult the slain, Triumphant live? not only live, but reign? While you, thin shades, the sport of winds, are tost O'er dreary plains, or tread the burning coast! I cannot, cannot bear; 'tis past, 'tis done; Perish this impious, this detested son; Perish his sire, and perish I withal; And let the house's heir, and the hoped kingdom fall. “Where is the mother fled, her pious love, And where the pains with which ten months I strove! Ah! hadst thou died, my son, in infant years, Thy little hearse had been bedewed with tears. “Thou livest by me; to me thy breath resign; Mine is the merit, the demerit thine. Thy life by double title I require; Once given at birth, and once preserved from fire: One murder pay, or add one murder more, And me to them who fell by thee restore. “I would, but cannot: my son's image stands Before my sight;—and now their angry hands My brothers hold, and vengeance these exact; This pleads compassion, and repents the fact. “He pleads in vain, and I pronounce his doom: My brothers, though unjustly, shall o'ercome; But having paid their injured ghosts their due, My son requires my death, and mine shall his pursue.” At this, for the last time, she lifts her hand, Averts her eyes, and half-unwilling drops the brand. The brand, amid the flaming fuel thrown, Or drew, or seemed to draw, a dying groan; The fires themselves but faintly licked their prey, Then loathed their impious food, and would have shrunk away. Just then the hero cast a doleful cry, And in those absent flames began to fry; The blind contagion raged within his veins; But he, with manly patience, bore his pains; He feared not fate, but only grieved to die Without an honest wound, and by a death so dry. “Happy Ancæus,” thrice aloud he cried, “With what becoming fate in arms he died!” Then called his brothers, sisters, sire, around, And her to whom his nuptial vows were bound; Perhaps his mother; a long sigh he drew, And, his voice failing, took his last adieu; For, as the flames augment, and as they stay At their full height, then languish to decay, They rise, and sink by fits; at last they soar In one bright blaze, and then descend no more: Just so his inward heats, at height, impair, Till the last burning breath shoots out the soul in air. Now lofty Calydon in ruins lies; All ages, all degrees, unsluice their eyes; And heaven and earth resound with murmurs, groans, and cries. Matrons and maidens beat their breasts, and tear Their habits, and root up their scattered hair. The wretched father, father now no more, With sorrow sunk, lies prostrate on the floor; Deforms his hoary locks with dust obscene, And curses age, and loathes a life prolonged with pain. By steel her stubborn soul his mother freed, And punished on herself her impious deed. Had I a hundred tongues, a wit so large As could their hundred offices discharge; Had Phœbus all his Helicon bestowed, In all the streams inspiring all the god; Those tongues, that wit, those streams, that god in vain Would offer to describe his sisters' pain; They beat their breasts with many a bruising blow, Till they turn livid, and corrupt the snow. The corpse they cherish, while the corpse remains, And exercise and rub with fruitless pains; And when to funeral flames 'tis borne away, They kiss the bed on which the body lay; And when those funeral flames no longer burn, The dust composed within a pious urn, Even in that urn their brother they confess, And hug it in their arms, and to their bosoms press. His tomb is raised; then, stretched along the ground, Those living monuments his tomb surround; Even to his name, inscribed, their tears they pay, Till tears and kisses wear his name away. But Cynthia now had all her fury spent, Not with less ruin, than a race, content; Excepting Gorge, perished all the seed, And her whom heaven for Hercules decreed. Satiate at last, no longer she pursued The weeping sisters; but with wings endued, And horny beaks, and sent to flit in air, Who yearly round the tomb in feathered flocks repair. BAUCIS AND PHILEMON. OUT OF THE EIGHTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. The author, pursuing the deeds of Theseus, relates how he, with his friend Pirithous, were invited by Achelous, the River-God, to stay with him till his waters were abated. Achelous entertains them with a relation of his own love to Perimele, who was changed into an island by Neptune, at his request. Pirithous, being an atheist, derides the legend, and denies the power of the Gods to work that miracle. Lelex, another companion of Theseus, to confirm the story of Achelous, relates another metamorphosis, of Baucis and Philemon into trees, of which he was partly an eye-witness. Thus Achelous ends; his audience hear With admiration, and, admiring, fear The powers of heaven; except Ixion's son, Who laughed at all the gods, believed in none; He shook his impious head, and thus replies,— “These legends are no more than pious lies; You attribute too much to heavenly sway, To think they give us forms, and take away.” The rest, of better minds, their sense declared Against this doctrine, and with horror heard. Then Lelex rose, an old experienced man, And thus with sober gravity began;— “Heaven's power is infinite; earth, air, and sea, The manufacture mass, the making power obey. By proof to clear your doubt;—In Phrygian ground Two neighbouring trees, with walls encompassed round, Stand on a moderate rise, with wonder shown, One a hard oak, a softer linden one; I saw the place and them, by Pittheus sent To Phrygian realms, my grandsire's government. Not far from thence is seen a lake, the haunt Of coots, and of the fishing cormorant. Here Jove with Hermes came; but in disguise Of mortal men concealed their deities; One laid aside his thunder, one his rod, And many toilsome steps together trod; For harbour at a thousand doors they knocked, Not one of all the thousand but was locked; At last an hospitable house they found, A homely shed; the roof, not far from ground, Was thatched with reeds and straw together bound. There Baucis and Philemon lived, and there Had lived long married, and a happy pair; Now old in love; though little was their store, Inured to want, their poverty they bore, Nor aimed at wealth, professing to be poor. For master or for servant here to call, Was all alike, where only two were all. Command was none, where equal love was paid, Or rather both commanded, both obeyed. “From lofty roofs the gods repulsed before, Now stooping, entered through the little door; The man their hearty welcome first expressed, A common settle drew for either guest, Inviting each his weary limbs to rest. But, ere they sat, officious Baucis lays Two cushions stuffed with straw, the seat to raise; Coarse, but the best she had; then takes the load Of ashes from the hearth, and spreads abroad The living coals, and, lest they should expire, With leaves and barks she feeds her infant-fire; It smokes, and then with trembling breath she blows, Till in a cheerful blaze the flames arose. With brushwood and with chips she strengthens these, And adds at last the boughs of rotten trees. The fire thus formed, she sets the kettle on, Like burnished gold the little seether shone; Next took the coleworts which her husband got From his own ground, a small well-watered spot; She stripped the stalks of all their leaves; the best She culled, and then with handy care she dressed. High o'er the hearth a chine of bacon hung; Good old Philemon seized it with a prong, And from the sooty rafter drew it down, Then cut a slice, but scarce enough for one; Yet a large portion of a little store, Which, for their sake alone, he wished were more. This in the pot he plunged without delay, To tame the flesh, and drain the salt away. The time between, before the fire they sat, And shortened the delay by pleasing chat. “A beam there was, on which a beechen pail Hung by the handle, on a driven nail; This filled with water, gently warmed, they set Before their guests; in this they bathed their feet, And after with clean towels dried their sweat: This done, the host produced the genial bed, Sallow the foot, the borders, and the stead, Which with no costly coverlet they spread, But coarse old garments; yet such robes as these They laid alone, at feasts, on holidays. The good old housewife, tucking up her gown, The table sets; the invited gods lie down. The trivet-table of a foot was lame, A blot which prudent Baucis overcame, Who thrust beneath the limping leg a sherd, So was the mended board exactly reared; Then rubbed it o'er with newly gathered mint, A wholesome herb, that breathed a grateful scent. Pallas began the feast, where first was seen The party-coloured olive, black and green; Autumnal cornels next in order served, In lees of wine well pickled and preserved; A garden-salad was the third supply, Of endive, radishes, and succory; Then curds and cream, the flower of country fare, And new-laid eggs, which Baucis' busy care Turned by a gentle fire, and roasted rare. All these in earthenware were served to board; And, next in place, an earthen pitcher, stored With liquor of the best the cottage could afford. This was the table's ornament and pride, With figures wrought; like pages at his side Stood beechen bowls; and these were shining clean, Varnished with wax without, and lined within. By this the boiling kettle had prepared, And to the table sent the smoking lard; On which, with eager appetite, they dine, A savoury bit, that served to relish wine; The wine itself was suiting to the rest, Still working in the must, and lately pressed. The second course succeeds like that before, Plums, apples, nuts, and, of their wintry-store, Dry figs and grapes, and wrinkled dates were set In canisters, to enlarge the little treat; All these a milk-white honey-comb surround, Which in the midst the country-banquet crowned. But the kind hosts their entertainment grace With hearty welcome, and an open face; In all they did, you might discern with ease A willing mind, and a desire to please. “Mean time the beechen bowls went round, and still, Though often emptied, were observed to fill; Filled without hands, and of their own accord Ran without feet, and danced about the board. Devotion seized the pair, to see the feast With wine, and of no common grape, increased; And up they held their hands, and fell to prayer, Excusing, as they could, their country fare. One goose they had, 'twas all they could allow, A wakeful sentry, and on duty now, Whom to the gods for sacrifice they vow: Her, with malicious zeal, the couple viewed; She ran for life, and, limping, they pursued; Full well the fowl perceived their bad intent, And would not make her master's compliment; But, persecuted, to the powers she flies, And close between the legs of Jove she lies. He, with a gracious ear, the suppliant heard, And saved her life; then what he was declared, And owned the god. ‘The neighbourhood,’ said he, ‘Shall justly perish for impiety; You stand alone exempted; but obey With speed, and follow where we lead the way; Leave these accursed, and to the mountain's height Ascend, nor once look backward in your flight.’ “They haste, and what their tardy feet denied, The trusty staff (their better leg) supplied. An arrow's flight they wanted to the top, And there secure, but spent with travel, stop; Then turn their now no more forbidden eyes:— Lost in a lake, the floated level lies; A watery desert covers all the plains, Their cot alone, as in an isle, remains: Wondering, with peeping eyes, while they deplore Their neighbours' fate, and country now no more, Their little shed, scarce large enough for two, Seems, from the ground increased, in height and bulk to grow. A stately temple shoots within the skies; The crotchets of their cot in columns rise; The pavement polished marble they behold, The gates with sculpture graced, the spires and tiles of gold. “Then thus the sire of gods, with looks serene, ‘Speak thy desire, thou only just of men; And thou, O woman, only worthy found To be with such a man in marriage bound.’ “Awhile they whisper; then, to Jove addressed, Philemon thus prefers their joint request:— ‘We crave to serve before your sacred shrine, And offer at your altars rites divine; And since not any action of our life Has been polluted with domestic strife, We beg one hour of death; that neither she, With widow's tears, may live to bury me, Nor weeping I, with withered arms, may bear My breathless Baucis to the sepulchre.’ The godheads sign their suit. They run their race In the same tenour all the appointed space; Then, when their hour was come, while they relate These past adventures at the temple-gate, Old Baucis is by old Philemon seen Sprouting with sudden leaves of sprightly green; Old Baucis looked where old Philemon stood, And saw his lengthened arms a sprouting wood; New roots their fastened feet begin to bind, Their bodies stiffen in a rising rind; Then, ere the bark above their shoulders grew, They give and take at once their last adieu; At once, ‘Farewell, O faithful spouse,’ they said; At once the encroaching rinds their closing lips invade. Even yet, an ancient Tyanæan shows A spreading oak, that near a linden grows; The neighbourhood confirm the prodigy, Grave men, not vain of tongue, or like to lie. I saw myself the garlands on their boughs, And tablets hung for gifts of granted vows; And offering fresher up, with pious prayer, ‘The good,’ said I, ‘are God's peculiar care, And such as honour heaven, shall heavenly honour share.’” THE FABLE OF IPHIS AND IANTHE. FROM THE NINTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. The fame of this, perhaps, through Crete had flown; But Crete had newer wonders of her own, In Iphis changed; for near the Gnossian bounds, As loud report the miracle resounds, At Phæstus dwelt a man of honest blood, But meanly born, and not so rich as good, Esteemed and loved by all the neighbourhood; Who to his wife, before the time assigned For child-birth came, thus bluntly spoke his mind:— “If heaven,” said Lygdus, “will vouchsafe to hear, I have but two petitions to prefer; Short pains for thee, for me a son and heir. Girls cost as many throes in bringing forth; Beside, when born, the tits are little worth; Weak puling things, unable to sustain Their share of labour, and their bread to gain. If, therefore, thou a creature shalt produce, Of so great charges, and so little use, Bear witness, heaven, with what reluctancy, Her hapless innocence I doom to die.” He said, and tears the common grief display, Of him who bade, and her who must obey. Yet Telethusa still persists, to find Fit arguments to move a father's mind; To extend his wishes to a larger scope, And in one vessel not confine his hope. Lygdus continues hard; her time drew near, And she her heavy load could scarcely bear; When slumbering, in the latter shades of night, Before the approaches of returning light, She saw, or thought she saw, before her bed, A glorious train, and Isis at their head; Her moony horns were on her forehead placed, And yellow sheaves her shining temples graced; A mitre, for a crown, she wore on high; The dog, and dappled bull, were waiting by; Osiris, sought along the banks of Nile; The silent god; the sacred Crocodile; And, last, a long procession moving on, With timbrels, that assist the labouring moon. Her slumbers seemed dispelled, and, broad awake, She heard a voice, that thus distinctly spake:— “My votary, thy babe from death defend, Nor fear to save whate'er the gods will send; Delude with art thy husband's dire decree; When danger calls, repose thy trust on me; And know, thou hast not served a thankless deity.” This promise made, with night the goddess fled; With joy the woman wakes, and leaves her bed; Devoutly lifts her spotless hands on high, And prays the powers their gift to ratify. Now grinding pains proceed to bearing throes, Till its own weight the burden did disclose. 'Twas of the beauteous kind, and brought to light With secrecy, to shun the father's sight. The indulgent mother did her care employ, And passed it on her husband for a boy. The nurse was conscious of the fact alone; The father paid his vows as for a son; And called him Iphis, by a common name, Which either sex with equal right may claim. Iphis his grandsire was; the wife was pleased, Of half the fraud by fortune's favour eased; The doubtful name was used without deceit, And truth was covered with a pious cheat. The habit showed a boy, the beauteous face With manly fierceness mingled female grace. Now thirteen years of age were swiftly run, When the fond father thought the time drew on Of settling in the world his only son. Ianthe was his choice; so wondrous fair, Her form alone with Iphis could compare; A neighbour's daughter of his own degree, And not more blessed with Fortune's goods than he. They soon espoused; for they with ease were joined, Who were before contracted in the mind. Their age the same, their inclinations too, And bred together in one school, they grew. Thus, fatally disposed to mutual fires, They felt, before they knew, the same desires. Equal their flame, unequal was their care; One loved with hope, one languished in despair. The maid accused the lingering days alone; For whom she thought a man, she thought her own. But Iphis bends beneath a greater grief; As fiercely burns, but hopes for no relief. E'en her despair adds fuel to her fire; A maid with madness does a maid desire. And, scarce refraining tears, “Alas,” said she, “What issue of my love remains for me! How wild a passion works within my breast! With what prodigious flames am I possest! Could I the care of Providence deserve, Heaven must destroy me, if it would preserve. And that's my fate, or sure it would have sent Some usual evil for my punishment; Not this unkindly curse; to rage and burn, Where nature shows no prospect of return. Nor cows for cows consume with fruitless fire; Nor mares, when hot, their fellow-mares desire; The father of the fold supplies his ewes; The stag through secret woods his hind pursues; And birds for mates the males of their own species choose. Her females nature guards from female flame, And joins two sexes to preserve the game; Would I were nothing, or not what I am! Crete, famed for monsters, wanted of her store, Till my new love produced one monster more. The daughter of the Sun a bull desired; And yet e'en then a male a female fired: Her passion was extravagantly new; But mine is much the madder of the two. To things impossible she was not bent, But found the means to compass her intent. To cheat his eyes she took a different shape; Yet still she gained a lover, and a leap. Should all the wit of all the world conspire, Should Dædalus assist my wild desire, What art can make me able to enjoy, Or what can change Ianthe to a boy? Extinguish then thy passion, hopeless maid, And recollect thy reason for thy aid. Know what thou art, and love as maidens ought, And drive these golden wishes from thy thought. Thou canst not hope thy fond desires to gain; Where hope is wanting, wishes are in vain. And yet no guards against our joys conspire; No jealous husband hinders our desire; My parents are propitious to my wish, And she herself consenting to the bliss. All things concur to prosper our design; All things to prosper any love but mine. And yet I never can enjoy the fair; 'Tis past the power of heaven to grant my prayer. Heaven has been kind, as far as heaven can be; Our parents with our own desires agree; But nature, stronger than the gods above, Refuses her assistance to my love: She sets the bar that causes all my pain; One gift refused makes all their bounty vain. And now the happy day is just at hand, To bind our hearts in Hymen's holy band; Our hearts, but not our bodies; thus accursed, In midst of water I complain of thirst. Why comest thou, Juno, to these barren rites, To bless a bed defrauded of delights? And why should Hymen lift his torch on high, To see two brides in cold embraces lie?” Thus love-sick Iphis her vain passion mourns; With equal ardour fair Ianthe burns; Invoking Hymen's name, and Juno's power, To speed the work, and haste the happy hour. She hopes, while Telethusa fears the day, And strives to interpose some new delay; Now feigns a sickness, now is in a fright For this bad omen, or that boding sight. But having done whate'er she could devise, And emptied all her magazine of lies, The time approached; the next ensuing day The fatal secret must to light betray. Then Telethusa had recourse to prayer, She and her daughter with dishevelled hair; Trembling with fear, great Isis they adored, Embraced her altar, and her aid implored. “Fair queen, who dost on fruitful Egypt smile, Who sway'st the sceptre of the Pharian isle, And seven-fold falls of disemboguing Nile; Relieve, in this our last distress,” she said, “A suppliant mother, and a mournful maid. Thou, goddess, thou wert present to my sight; Revealed I saw thee by thy own fair light; I saw thee in my dream, as now I see, With all thy marks of awful majesty; The glorious train that compassed thee around; And heard the hollow timbrel's holy sound. Thy words I noted, which I still retain; Let not thy sacred oracles be vain. That Iphis lives, that I myself am free From shame and punishment, I owe to thee. On thy protection all our hopes depend; Thy counsel saved us, let thy power defend.” Her tears pursued her words, and, while she spoke, The goddess nodded, and her altar shook; The temple doors, as with a blast of wind, Were heard to clap; the lunar horns, that bind The brows of Isis, cast a blaze around; The trembling timbrel made a murmuring sound. Some hopes these happy omens did impart; Forth went the mother with a beating heart, Not much in fear, nor fully satisfied; But Iphis followed with a larger stride: The whiteness of her skin forsook her face; Her looks emboldened with an awful grace; Her features and her strength together grew, And her long hair to curling locks withdrew. Her sparkling eyes with manly vigour shone; Big was her voice, audacious was her tone. The latent parts, at length revealed, began To shoot, and spread, and burnish into man. The maid becomes a youth;—no more delay Your vows, but look, and confidently pay.— Their gifts the parents to the temple bear; The votive tables this inscription wear;— “Iphis, the man, has to the goddess paid The vows, that Iphis offered when a maid.” Now when the star of day had shown his face, Venus and Juno with their presence grace The nuptial rites, and Hymen from above Descended to complete their happy love; The gods of marriage lend their mutual aid, And the warm youth enjoys the lovely maid. PYGMALION AND THE STATUE. FROM THE TENTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. The Propœtides, for their impudent behaviour, being turned into stone by Venus, Pygmalion, Prince of Cyprus, detested all women for their sake, and resolved never to marry. He falls in love with a statue of his own making, which is changed into a maid, whom he marries. One of his descendants is Cinyras, the father of Myrrha; the daughter incestuously loves her own father, for which she is changed into a tree, which bears her name. These two stories immediately follow each other, and are admirably well connected. Pygmalion, loathing their lascivious life, Abhorred all womankind, but most a wife; So single chose to live, and shunned to wed, Well pleased to want a consort of his bed. Yet fearing idleness, the nurse of ill, In sculpture exercised his happy skill; And carved in ivory such a maid, so fair, As nature could not with his art compare, Were she to work; but in her own defence, Must take her pattern here, and copy hence. Pleased with his idol, he commends, admires, Adores; and last, the thing adored desires. A very virgin in her face was seen, And, had she moved, a living maid had been: One would have thought she could have stirred, but strove With modesty, and was ashamed to move. Art, hid with art, so well performed the cheat, It caught the carver with his own deceit. He knows 'tis madness, yet he must adore, And still the more he knows it, loves the more; The flesh, or what so seems, he touches oft, Which feels so smooth, that he believes it soft. Fired with this thought, at once he strained the breast, And on the lips a burning kiss impressed. 'Tis true, the hardened breast resists the gripe, And the cold lips return a kiss unripe; But when, retiring back, he looked again, To think it ivory was a thought too mean; So would believe she kissed, and courting more, Again embraced her naked body o'er; And, straining hard the statue, was afraid His hands had made a dint, and hurt his maid; Explored her, limb by limb, and feared to find So rude a gripe had left a livid mark behind. With flattery now he seeks her mind to move, And now with gifts, the powerful bribes of love: He furnishes her closet first; and fills The crowded shelves with rarities of shells; Adds orient pearls, which from the conchs he drew, And all the sparkling stones of various hue; And parrots, imitating human tongue, And singing-birds in silver cages hung; And every fragrant flower, and odorous green, Were sorted well, with lumps of amber laid between; Rich fashionable robes her person deck; Pendants her ears, and pearls adorn her neck; Her tapered fingers too with rings are graced, And an embroidered zone surrounds her slender waist. Thus like a queen arrayed, so richly dressed, Beauteous she showed, but naked showed the best. Then from the floor he raised a royal bed, With coverings of Sidonian purple spread; The solemn rites performed, he calls her bride, With blandishments invites her to his side, And as she were with vital sense possessed, Her head did on a plumy pillow rest. The feast of Venus came, a solemn day, To which the Cypriots due devotion pay; With gilded horns the milk-white heifers led, Slaughtered before the sacred altars, bled; Pygmalion, offering, first approached the shrine, And then with prayers implored the powers divine;— “Almighty Gods, if all we mortals want, If all we can require, be yours to grant, Make this fair statue mine,”—he would have said, But changed his words for shame, and only prayed, “Give me the likeness of my ivory maid!”— The golden Goddess, present at the prayer, Well knew he meant the inanimated fair, And gave the sign of granting his desire; For thrice in cheerful flames ascends the fire. The youth, returning to his mistress, hies, And impudent in hope, with ardent eyes, And beating breast, by the dear statue lies. He kisses her white lips, renews the bliss, And looks and thinks they redden at the kiss; He thought them warm before: nor longer stays, But next his hand on her hard bosom lays; Hard as it was, beginning to relent, It seemed the breast beneath his fingers bent; He felt again, his fingers made a print, 'Twas flesh, but flesh so firm, it rose against the dint. The pleasing task he fails not to renew; Soft, and more soft at every touch it grew; Like pliant wax, when chafing hands reduce The former mass to form, and frame to use. He would believe, but yet is still in pain, And tries his argument of sense again, Presses the pulse, and feels the leaping vein. Convinced, o'erjoyed, his studied thanks and praise, To her who made the miracle, he pays; Then lips to lips he joined; now freed from fear, He found the savour of the kiss sincere. At this the wakened image oped her eyes, And viewed at once the light and lover with surprise. The goddess, present at the match she made, So blessed the bed, such fruitfulness conveyed, That ere ten moons had sharpened either horn, To crown their bliss, a lovely boy was born; Paphos his name, who, grown to manhood, walled The city Paphos, from the founder called. CINYRAS AND MYRRHA. OUT OF THE TENTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. There needs no connection of this story with the former, for the beginning of this immediately follows the end of the last. The reader is only to take notice, that Orpheus, who relates both, was by birth a Thracian, and his country far distant from Cyprus, where Myrrha was born, and from Arabia, whither she fled. You will see the reason of this note, soon after the first lines of this fable. Nor him alone produced the fruitful queen; But Cinyras, who like his sire had been A happy prince, had he not been a sire. Daughters and fathers, from my song retire! I sing of horror; and, could I prevail, You should not hear, or not believe my tale. Yet if the pleasure of my song be such, That you will hear, and credit me too much, Attentive listen to the last event, And with the sin believe the punishment: Since nature could behold so dire a crime, I gratulate at least my native clime, That such a land, which such a monster bore, So far is distant from our Thracian shore. Let Araby extol her happy coast, Her cinnamon and sweet amomum boast; Her fragrant flowers, her trees with precious tears, Her second harvests, and her double years; How can the land be called so blessed that Myrrha bears? Not all her odorous tears can cleanse her crime, Her plant alone deforms the happy clime; Cupid denies to have inflamed thy heart, Disowns thy love, and vindicates his dart; Some fury gave thee those infernal pains, And shot her venomed vipers in thy veins. To hate thy sire, had merited a curse; But such an impious love deserved a worse. The neighbouring monarchs, by thy beauty led, Contend in crowds, ambitious of thy bed; The world is at thy choice, except but one, Except but him thou canst not choose alone. She knew it too, the miserable maid, Ere impious love her better thoughts betrayed, And thus within her secret soul she said:— “Ah, Myrrha! whither would thy wishes tend? Ye Gods, ye sacred laws, my soul defend From such a crime as all mankind detest, And never lodged before in human breast! But is it sin? Or makes my mind alone The imagined sin? For nature makes it none. What tyrant then these envious laws began, Made not for any other beast but man! The father-bull his daughter may bestride, The horse may make his mother-mare a bride; What piety forbids the lusty ram, Or more salacious goat, to rut their dam? The hen is free to wed her chick she bore, And make a husband, whom she hatched before. All creatures else are of a happier kind, Whom nor ill-natured laws from pleasure bind, Nor thoughts of sin disturb their peace of mind. But man a slave of his own making lives; The fool denies himself what nature gives; Too busy senates, with an over-care To make us better than our kind can bear, Have dashed a spice of envy in the laws, And, straining up too high, have spoiled the cause. Yet some wise nations break their cruel chains, And own no laws, but those which love ordains; Where happy daughters with their sires are joined, And piety is doubly paid in kind. O that I had been born in such a clime, Not here, where 'tis the country makes the crime! . . . But whither would my impious fancy stray? Hence hopes, and ye forbidden thoughts, away! His worth deserves to kindle my desires, But with the love that daughters bear to sires. Then had not Cinyras my father been, What hindered Myrrha's hopes to be his queen? But the perverseness of my fate is such, That he's not mine, because he's mine too much: Our kindred-blood debars a better tie; He might be nearer, were he not so nigh. Eyes and their objects never must unite, Some distance is required to help the sight. Fain would I travel to some foreign shore, Never to see my native country more, So might I to myself myself restore; So might my mind these impious thoughts remove, And, ceasing to behold, might cease to love. But stay I must, to feed my famished sight, To talk, to kiss; and more, if more I might: . . . More, impious maid! What more canst thou design? To make a monstrous mixture in thy line, And break all statutes human and divine? Canst thou be called (to save thy wretched life) Thy mother's rival, and thy father's wife? Confound so many sacred names in one, Thy brother's mother! sister to thy son! And fear'st thou not to see the infernal bands, Their heads with snakes, with torches armed their hands, Full at thy face the avenging brands to bear, And shake the serpents from their hissing hair? But thou in time the increasing ill control, Nor first debauch the body by the soul; Secure the sacred quiet of thy mind, And keep the sanctions nature has designed. Suppose I should attempt, the attempt were vain; No thoughts like mine his sinless soul profane, Observant of the right; and O, that he Could cure my madness, or be mad like me!” Thus she; but Cinyras, who daily sees A crowd of noble suitors at his knees, Among so many, knew not whom to choose, Irresolute to grant, or to refuse; But, having told their names, inquired of her, Who pleased her best, and whom she would prefer? The blushing maid stood silent with surprise, And on her father fixed her ardent eyes, And, looking, sighed; and, as she sighed, began Round tears to shed, that scalded as they ran. The tender sire, who saw her blush, and cry, Ascribed it all to maiden modesty; And dried the falling drops, and, yet more kind, He stroked her cheeks, and holy kisses joined: She felt a secret venom fire her blood, And found more pleasure than a daughter should; And, asked again, what lover of the crew She liked the best? she answered, “One like you.” Mistaking what she meant, her pious will He praised, and bade her so continue still: The word of “pious” heard, she blushed with shame Of secret guilt, and could not bear the name. 'Twas now the mid of night, when slumbers close Our eyes, and soothe our cares with soft repose; But no repose could wretched Myrrha find, Her body rolling, as she rolled her mind: Mad with desire, she ruminates her sin, And wishes all her wishes o'er again: Now she despairs, and now resolves to try; Would not, and would again, she knows not why; Stops and returns, makes and retracts the vow; Fain would begin, but understands not how: As when a pine is hewn upon the plains, And the last mortal stroke alone remains, Labouring in pangs of death, and threatening all, This way and that she nods, considering where to fall; So Myrrha's mind, impelled on either side, Takes every bent, but cannot long abide: Irresolute on which she should rely, At last, unfixed in all, is only fixed to die. On that sad thought she rests; resolved on death, She rises, and prepares to choke her breath: Then while about the beam her zone she ties, “Dear Cinyras, farewell,” she softly cries; “For thee I die, and only wish to be Not hated, when thou know'st I die for thee: Pardon the crime, in pity to the cause.” This said, about her neck the noose she draws. The nurse, who lay without, her faithful guard, Though not the words, the murmurs overheard, And sighs and hollow sounds; surprised with fright, She starts, and leaves her bed, and springs a light; Unlocks the door, and, entering out of breath, The dying saw, and instruments of death. She shrieks, she cuts the zone with trembling haste, And in her arms her fainting charge embraced; Next (for she now had leisure for her tears) She weeping asked, in these her blooming years, What unforeseen misfortune caused her care, To loathe her life, and languish in despair? The maid, with downcast eyes, and mute with grief, For death unfinished, and ill-timed relief, Stood sullen to her suit: the beldame pressed The more to know, and bared her withered breast; Adjured her, by the kindly food she drew From those dry founts, her secret ill to shew. Sad Myrrha sighed, and turned her eyes aside; The nurse still urged, and would not be denied; Nor only promised secrecy, but prayed She might have leave to give her offered aid. “Good will,” she said, “my want of strength supplies, And diligence shall give what age denies. If strong desires thy mind to fury move, With charms and medicines I can cure thy love; If envious eyes their hurtful rays have cast, More powerful verse shall free thee from the blast; If heaven, offended, sends thee this disease, Offended heaven with prayers we can appease. What then remains, that can these cares procure? Thy house is flourishing, thy fortune sure; Thy careful mother yet in health survives, And, to thy comfort, thy kind father lives.” The virgin started at her father's name, And sighed profoundly, conscious of the shame; Nor yet the nurse her impious love divined, But yet surmised, that love disturbed her mind. Thus thinking, she pursued her point, and laid And lull'd within her lap the mourning maid; Then softly soothed her thus: “I guess your grief; You love, my child; your love shall find relief. My long experienced age shall be your guide; Rely on that, and lay distrust aside; No breath of air shall on the secret blow, Nor shall (what most you fear) your father know.” Struck once again, as with a thunder-clap, The guilty virgin bounded from her lap, And threw her body prostrate on the bed, And, to conceal her blushes, hid her head: There silent lay, and warned her with her hand To go; but she received not the command; Remaining still importunate to know. Then Myrrha thus: “Or ask no more, or go; I pr'ythee go, or, staying, spare my shame; What thou wouldst hear, is impious even to name.” At this, on high the beldame holds her hands, And trembling, both with age and terror, stands; Adjures, and, falling at her feet, intreats, Soothes her with blandishments, and frights with threats, To tell the crime intended, or disclose What part of it she knew, if she no further knows; And last, if conscious to her counsel made, Confirms anew the promise of her aid. Now Myrrha raised her head; but soon, oppressed With shame, reclined it on her nurse's breast; Bathed it with tears, and strove to have confessed: Twice she began, and stopped; again she tried; The faltering tongue its office still denied; At last her veil before her face she spread, And drew a long preluding sigh, and said, “O happy mother, in thy marriage bed!” . . . Then groaned, and ceased.—The good old woman shook, Stiff were her eyes, and ghastly was her look; Her hoary hair upright with horror stood, Made (to her grief) more knowing than she would; Much she reproached, and many things she said, To cure the madness of the unhappy maid: In vain; for Myrrha stood convict of ill; Her reason vanquished, but unchanged her will; Perverse of mind, unable to reply, She stood resolved or to possess, or die. At length the fondness of a nurse prevailed Against her better sense, and virtue failed: “Enjoy, my child, since such is thy desire, Thy love,” she said; she durst not say, “Thy sire.” “Live, though unhappy, live on any terms;” Then with a second oath her faith confirms. The solemn feast of Ceres now was near, When long white linen stoles the matrons wear; Ranked in procession walk the pious train, Offering first-fruits, and spikes of yellow grain; For nine long nights the nuptial bed they shun, And, sanctifying harvest, lie alone. Mixed with the crowd, the queen forsook her lord, And Ceres' power with secret rites adored. The royal couch now vacant for a time, The crafty crone, officious in her crime, The curst occasion took; the king she found Easy with wine, and deep in pleasures drowned, Prepared for love; the beldame blew the flame, Confessed the passion, but concealed the name. Her form she praised; the monarch asked her years, And she replied, “The same thy Myrrha bears.” Wine and commended beauty fired his thought; Impatient, he commands her to be brought. Pleased with her charge performed, she hies her home, And gratulates the nymph, the task was overcome. Myrrha was joyed the welcome news to hear; But, clogged with guilt, the joy was insincere. So various, so discordant is the mind, That in our will, a different will we find. Ill she presaged, and yet pursued her lust; For guilty pleasures give a double gust. 'Twas depth of night; Arctophylax had driven His lazy wain half round the northern heaven, When Myrrha hastened to the crime desired. The moon beheld her first, and first retired; The stars, amazed, ran backward from the sight, And, shrunk within their sockets, lost their light. Icarius first withdraws his holy flame; The Virgin sign, in heaven the second name, Slides down the belt, and from her station flies, And night with sable clouds involves the skies. Bold Myrrha still pursues her black intent; She stumbled thrice, (an omen of the event;) Thrice shrieked the funeral owl, yet on she went, Secure of shame, because secure of sight; Even bashful sins are impudent by night. Linked hand in hand, the accomplice and the dame, Their way exploring, to the chamber came; The door was ope, they blindly grope their way, Where dark in bed the expecting monarch lay: Thus far her courage held, but here forsakes; Her faint knees knock at every step she makes. The nearer to her crime, the more within She feels remorse, and horror of her sin; Repents too late her criminal desire, And wishes, that unknown she could retire. Her, lingering thus, the nurse, who feared delay The fatal secret might at length betray, Pulled forward, to complete the work begun, And said to Cinyras,—“Receive thy own!” . . . Thus saying, she delivered kind to kind, Accursed, and their devoted bodies joined. The sire, unknowing of the crime, admits His bowels, and profanes the hallowed sheets. He found she trembled, but believed she strove, With maiden modesty, against her love; And sought, with flattering words, vain fancies to remove. Perhaps he said, “My daughter, cease thy fears,” Because the title suited with her years; And, “Father,” she might whisper him again, That names might not be wanting to the sin. Full of her sire, she left the incestuous bed, And carried in her womb the crime she bred. Another, and another night she came; For frequent sin had left no sense of shame; Till Cinyras desired to see her face, Whose body he had held in close embrace, And brought a taper; the revealer, light, Exposed both crime, and criminal, to sight. Grief, rage, amazement, could no speech afford, But from the sheath he drew the avenging sword; The guilty fled; the benefit of night, That favoured first the sin, secured the flight. Long wandering through the spacious fields, she bent Her voyage to the Arabian continent; Then passed the region which Panchæa joined, And flying left the palmy plains behind. Nine times the moon had mewed her horns; at length, With travel weary, unsupplied with strength, And with the burden of her womb oppressed, Sabæan fields afford her needful rest; There, loathing life, and yet of death afraid, In anguish of her spirit, thus she prayed:— “Ye powers, if any so propitious are To accept my penitence, and hear my prayer, Your judgments, I confess, are justly sent; Great sins deserve as great a punishment: Yet, since my life the living will profane, And since my death the happy dead will stain, A middle state your mercy may bestow, Betwixt the realms above, and those below; Some other form to wretched Myrrha give, Nor let her wholly die, nor wholly live.” The prayers of penitents are never vain; At least, she did her last request obtain; For, while she spoke, the ground began to rise, And gathered round her feet, her legs, and thighs; Her toes in roots descend, and, spreading wide, A firm foundation for the trunk provide; Her solid bones convert to solid wood, To pith her marrow, and to sap her blood; Her arms are boughs, her fingers change their kind, Her tender skin is hardened into rind. And now the rising tree her womb invests, Now, shooting upwards still, invades her breasts, And shades the neck; and, weary with delay, She sunk her head within, and met it half the way. And though with outward shape she lost her sense, With bitter tears she wept her last offence; And still she weeps, nor sheds her tears in vain; For still the precious drops her name retain. Mean time the misbegotten infant grows, And, ripe for birth, distends with deadly throes The swelling rind, with unavailing strife, To leave the wooden womb, and pushes into life. The mother-tree, as if oppressed with pain, Writhes here and there, to break the bark, in vain; And, like a labouring woman, would have prayed, But wants a voice to call Lucina's aid; The bending bole sends out a hollow sound, And trickling tears fall thicker on the ground. The mild Lucina came uncalled, and stood Beside the struggling boughs, and heard the groaning wood; Then reached her midwife-hand, to speed the throes, And spoke the powerful spells that babes to birth disclose. The bark divides, the living load to free, And safe delivers the convulsive tree. The ready nymphs receive the crying child, And wash him in the tears the parent plant distilled. They swathed him with their scarfs; beneath him spread The ground with herbs; with roses raised his head. The lovely babe was born with every grace; Even envy must have praised so fair a face: Such was his form, as painters, when they show Their utmost art, on naked loves bestow; And that their arms no difference might betray, Give him a bow, or his from Cupid take away. Time glides along, with undiscovered haste, The future but a length behind the past, So swift are years; the babe, whom just before His grandsire got, and whom his sister bore; The drop, the thing which late the tree inclosed, And late the yawning bark to life exposed; A babe, a boy, a beauteous youth appears; And lovelier than himself at riper years. Now to the queen of love he gave desires, And, with her pains, revenged his mother's fires. CEYX AND ALCYONE. OUT OF THE TENTH [ELEVENTH] BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. CONNECTION OF THIS FABLE WITH THE FORMER. Ceyx, the son of Lucifer (the Morning Star), and King of Trachin, in Thessaly, was married to Alcyone, daughter to Æolus, god of the winds. Both the husband and the wife loved each other with an entire affection. Dœdalion, the elder brother of Ceyx, whom he succeeded, having been turned into a falcon by Apollo, and Chione, Dœdalion's daughter, slain by Diana, Ceyx prepares a ship to sail to Claros, there to consult the oracle of Apollo, and (as Ovid seems to intimate) to inquire how the anger of the Gods might be atoned. These prodigies afflict the pious prince; But, more perplexed with those that happened since, He purposes to seek the Clarian God, Avoiding Delphos, his more famed abode; Since Phlegian robbers made unsafe the road. Yet could not he from her he loved so well, The fatal voyage, he resolved, conceal; But when she saw her lord prepared to part, A deadly cold ran shivering to her heart; Her faded cheeks are changed to boxen hue, And in her eyes the tears are ever new; She thrice essayed to speak; her accents hung, And, faltering, died unfinished on her tongue, Or vanished into sighs; with long delay Her voice returned; and found the wonted way. “Tell me, my lord,” she said, “what fault unknown Thy once beloved Alcyone has done? Whither, ah whither is thy kindness gone! Can Ceyx then sustain to leave his wife, And unconcerned forsake the sweets of life? What can thy mind to this long journey move, Or need'st thou absence to renew thy love? Yet, if thou goest by land, though grief possess My soul even then, my fears will be the less. But ah! be warned to shun the watery way, The face is frightful of the stormy sea. For late I saw adrift disjointed planks, And empty tombs erected on the banks. Nor let false hopes to trust betray thy mind, Because my sire in caves constrains the wind, Can with a breath their clamorous rage appease, They fear his whistle, and forsake the seas: Not so; for, once indulged, they sweep the main, Deaf to the call, or, hearing, hear in vain; But bent on mischief, bear the waves before, And, not content with seas, insult the shore; When ocean, air, and earth, at once engage, And rooted forests fly before their rage; At once the clashing clouds to battle move, And lightnings run across the fields above: I know them well, and marked their rude comport, While yet a child, within my father's court; In times of tempest they command alone, And he but sits precarious on the throne; The more I know, the more my fears augment, And fears are oft prophetic of the event. But if not fears, or reasons will prevail, If fate has fixed thee obstinate to sail, Go not without thy wife, but let me bear My part of danger with an equal share, And present what I suffer only fear; Then o'er the bounding billows shall we fly, Secure to live together, or to die.” These reasons moved her starlike husband's heart, But still he held his purpose to depart; For as he loved her equal to his life, He would not to the seas expose his wife; Nor could be wrought his voyage to refrain, But sought by arguments to soothe her pain: Nor these availed; at length he lights on one, With which so difficult a cause he won:— “My love, so short an absence cease to fear, For, by my father's holy flame I swear, Before two moons their orb with light adorn, If heaven allow me life, I will return.” This promise of so short a stay prevails; He soon equips the ship, supplies the sails, And gives the word to launch; she trembling views This pomp of death, and parting tears renews; Last, with a kiss, she took a long farewell, Sighed, with a sad presage, and swooning fell. While Ceyx seeks delays, the lusty crew, Raised on their banks, their oars in order drew To their broad breasts,—the ship with fury flew. The queen, recovered, rears her humid eyes, And first her husband on the poop espies, Shaking his hand at distance on the main; She took the sign, and shook her hand again. Still as the ground recedes, retracts her view With sharpened sight, till she no longer knew The much-loved face; that comfort lost, supplies With less, and with the galley feeds her eyes; The galley borne from view by rising gales, She followed with her sight the flying sails; When even the flying sails were seen no more, Forsaken of all sight, she left the shore. Then on her bridal bed her body throws, And sought in sleep her wearied eyes to close; Her husband's pillow, and the widowed part Which once he pressed, renewed the former smart. And now a breeze from shore began to blow; The sailors ship their oars, and cease to row; Then hoist their yards atrip, and all their sails Let fall, to court the wind, and catch the gales. By this the vessel half her course had run, And as much rested till the rising sun; Both shores were lost to sight, when at the close Of day, a stiffer gale at east arose; The sea grew white, the rolling waves from far, Like heralds, first denounce the watery war. This seen, the master soon began to cry, “Strike, strike the top-sail; let the main sheet fly, And furl your sails.” The winds repel the sound, And in the speaker's mouth the speech is drowned. Yet of their own accord, as danger taught, Each in his way, officiously they wrought; Some stow their oars, or stop the leaky sides; Another, bolder yet, the yard bestrides, And folds the sails; a fourth, with labour, laves The intruding seas, and waves ejects on waves. In this confusion while their work they ply, The winds augment the winter of the sky, And wage intestine wars; the suffering seas Are tossed, and mingled as their tyrants please. The master would command, but, in despair Of safety, stands amazed with stupid care, Nor what to bid, or what forbid, he knows, The ungoverned tempest to such fury grows; Vain is his force, and vainer is his skill, With such a concourse comes the flood of ill; The cries of men are mixed with rattling shrouds; Seas dash on seas, and clouds encounter clouds; At once from east to west, from pole to pole, The forky lightnings flash, the roaring thunders roll. Now waves on waves ascending scale the skies, And, in the fires, above the water fries; When yellow sands are sifted from below, The glittering billows give a golden show; And when the fouler bottom spews the black, The Stygian dye the tainted waters take; Then frothy white appear the flatted seas, And change their colour, changing their disease. Like various fits the Trachin vessel finds, And now sublime she rides upon the winds; As from a lofty summit looks from high, And from the clouds beholds the nether sky; Now from the depth of hell they lift their sight, And at a distance see superior light; The lashing billows make a loud report, And beat her sides, as battering rams a fort; Or as a lion, bounding in his way, With force augmented bears against his prey, Sidelong to seize; or, unappalled with fear, Springs on the toils, and rushes on the spear; So seas impelled by winds, with added power, Assault the sides, and o'er the hatches tower. The planks, their pitchy coverings washed away, Now yield; and now a yawning breach display; The roaring waters with a hostile tide Rush through the ruins of her gaping side. Meantime, in sheets of rain the sky descends, And ocean, swelled with waters, upwards tends, One rising, falling one; the heavens and sea Meet at their confines, in the middle way; The sails are drunk with showers, and drop with rain, Sweet waters mingle with the briny main. No star appears to lend his friendly light; Darkness and tempest make a double night; But flashing fires disclose the deep by turns, And, while the lightnings blaze, the water burns. Now all the waves their scattered force unite; And, as a soldier, foremost in the fight, Makes way for others, and, an host alone, Still presses on, and, urging, gains the town; So while the invading billows come abreast, The hero tenth, advanced before the rest, Sweeps all before him with impetuous sway, And from the walls descends upon the prey; Part following enter, part remain without, With envy hear their fellows' conquering shout, And mount on others' backs, in hope to share The city, thus become the seat of war. An universal cry resounds aloud, The sailors run in heaps, a helpless crowd; Art fails, and courage falls, no succour near; As many waves, as many deaths appear. One weeps, and yet despairs of late relief; One cannot weep, his fears congeal his grief; But, stupid, with dry eyes expects his fate. One with loud shrieks laments his lost estate, And calls those happy whom their funerals wait. This wretch with prayers and vows the gods implores, And even the skies he cannot see, adores. That other on his friends his thoughts bestows, His careful father, and his faithful spouse. The covetous worldling in his anxious mind Thinks only on the wealth he left behind. All Ceyx his Alcyone employs, For her he grieves, yet in her absence joys; His wife he wishes, and would still be near, Not her with him, but wishes him with her: Now with last looks he seeks his native shore, Which fate has destined him to see no more; He sought, but in the dark tempestuous night He knew not whither to direct his sight. So whirl the seas, such darkness blinds the sky, That the black night receives a deeper dye. The giddy ship ran round; the tempest tore Her mast, and over-board the rudder bore. One billow mounts; and with a scornful brow, Proud of her conquest gained, insults the waves below; Nor lighter falls, than if some giant tore Pindus and Athos, with the freight they bore, And tossed on seas; pressed with the ponderous blow, Down sinks the ship within the abyss below; Down with the vessel sink into the main The many, never more to rise again. Some few on scattered planks with fruitless care Lay hold, and swim; but, while they swim, despair. Even he, who late a sceptre did command, Now grasps a floating fragment in his hand; And while he struggles on the stormy main, Invokes his father, and his wife, in vain: But yet his consort is his greatest care; Alcyone he names amidst his prayer; Names as a charm against the waves and wind, Most in his mouth, and ever in his mind. Tired with his toil, all hopes of safety past, From prayers to wishes he descends at last,— That his dead body, wafted to the sands, Might have its burial from her friendly hands. As oft as he can catch a gulp of air, And peep above the seas, he names the fair; And, even when plunged beneath, on her he raves, Murmuring Alcyone below the waves: At last a falling billow stops his breath, Breaks o'er his head, and whelms him underneath. Bright Lucifer unlike himself appears That night, his heavenly form obscured with tears; And since he was forbid to leave the skies, He muffled with a cloud his mournful eyes. Meantime Alcyone (his fate unknown) Computes how many nights he had been gone; Observes the waning moon with hourly view, Numbers her age, and wishes for a new; Against the promised time provides with care, And hastens in the woof the robes he was to wear; And for herself employs another loom, New-dressed to meet her lord returning home, Flattering her heart with joys that never were to come. She fumed the temples with an odorous flame, And oft before the sacred altars came, To pray for him, who was an empty name; All powers implored, but far above the rest, To Juno she her pious vows addressed, Her much-loved lord from perils to protect, And safe o'er seas his voyage to direct; Then prayed that she might still possess his heart, And no pretending rival share a part. This last petition heard, of all her prayer; The rest, dispersed by winds, were lost in air. But she, the goddess of the nuptial bed, Tired with her vain devotions for the dead, Resolved the tainted hand should be repelled, Which incense offered, and her altar held: Then Iris thus bespoke,—“Thou faithful maid, By whom the queen's commands are well conveyed, Haste to the house of Sleep, and bid the god, Who rules the night by visions with a nod, Prepare a dream, in figure and in form Resembling him who perished in the storm: This form before Alcyone present, To make her certain of the sad event.” Endued with robes of various hue she flies, And flying draws an arch, a segment of the skies; Then leaves her bending bow, and from the steep Descends to search the silent house of Sleep. Near the Cimmerians, in his dark abode, Deep in a cavern, dwells the drowsy god; Whose gloomy mansion nor the rising sun, Nor setting, visits, nor the lightsome noon; But lazy vapours round the region fly, Perpetual twilight, and a doubtful sky; No crowing cock does there his wings display, Nor with his horny bill provoke the day; Nor watchful dogs, nor the more wakeful geese, Disturb with nightly noise the sacred peace; Nor beast of nature, nor the tame, are nigh, Nor trees with tempests rocked, nor human cry; But safe repose, without an air of breath, Dwells here, and a dumb quiet next to death. An arm of Lethe, with a gentle flow, Arising upwards from the rock below, The palace moats, and o'er the pebbles creeps, And with soft murmurs calls the coming sleeps; Around its entry nodding poppies grow, And all cool simples that sweet rest bestow; Night from the plants their sleepy virtue drains, And passing sheds it on the silent plains: No door there was the unguarded house to keep, On creaking hinges turned, to break his sleep. But in the gloomy court was raised a bed, Stuffed with black plumes, and on an ebon stead; Black was the covering too, where lay the god, And slept supine, his limbs displayed abroad; About his head fantastic visions fly, Which various images of things supply, And mock their forms; the leaves on trees not more, Nor bearded ears in fields, nor sands upon the shore. The virgin, entering bright, indulged the day To the brown cave, and brushed the dreams away; The god, disturbed with this new glare of light Cast sudden on his face, unsealed his sight, And raised his tardy head, which sunk again, And, sinking on his bosom, knocked his chin; At length shook off himself, and asked the dame (And asking yawned), for what intent she came? To whom the goddess thus:—“O sacred Rest, Sweet pleasing Sleep, of all the powers the best! O peace of mind, repairer of decay, Whose balms renew the limbs to labours of the day, Care shuns thy soft approach, and sullen flies away! Adorn a dream, expressing human form, The shape of him who suffered in the storm, And send it flitting to the Trachin court, The wreck of wretched Ceyx to report: Before his queen bid the pale spectre stand, Who begs a vain relief at Juno's hand.” She said, and scarce awake her eyes could keep, Unable to support the fumes of sleep; But fled, returning by the way she went, And swerved along her bow with swift ascent. The god, uneasy till he slept again, Resolved at once to rid himself of pain; And, though against his custom, called aloud, Exciting Morpheus from the sleepy crowd; Morpheus, of all his numerous train, expressed The shape of man, and imitated best; The walk, the words, the gesture could supply, The habit mimic, and the mien belie; Plays well, but all his action is confined; Extending not beyond our human kind. Another birds, and beasts, and dragons apes, And dreadful images, and monster shapes: This dæmon, Icelos, in heaven's high hall The gods have named; but men Phobetor call: A third is Phantasus, whose actions roll On meaner thoughts, and things devoid of soul; Earth, fruits, and flowers, he represents in dreams, And solid rocks unmoved, and running streams. These three to kings and chiefs their scenes display, The rest before the ignoble commons play: Of these the chosen Morpheus is dispatched; Which done, the lazy monarch overwatched, Down from his propping elbow drops his head, Dissolved in sleep, and shrinks within his bed. Darkling the dæmon glides, for flight prepared, So soft that scarce his fanning wings are heard. To Trachin, swift as thought, the flitting shade Through air his momentary journey made: Then lays aside the steerage of his wings, Forsakes his proper form, assumes the king's; And pale as death, despoiled of his array, Into the queen's apartment takes his way, And stands before the bed at dawn of day: Unmoved his eyes, and wet his beard appears, And shedding vain, but seeming real tears; The briny water dropping from his hairs; Then staring on her, with a ghastly look And hollow voice, he thus the queen bespoke: “Knowest thou not me? Not yet, unhappy wife? Or are my features perished with my life? Look once again, and for thy husband lost, Lo! all that's left of him, thy husband's ghost! Thy vows for my return were all in vain; The stormy south o'ertook us in the main; And never shalt thou see thy loving lord again. Bear witness, heaven, I called on thee in death, And, while I called, a billow stopped my breath. Think not that flying fame reports my fate; I, present I, appear, and my own wreck relate. Rise, wretched widow, rise, nor undeplored Permit my ghost to pass the Stygian ford; But rise, prepared in black to mourn thy perished lord.” Thus said the player god; and, adding art Of voice and gesture, so performed his part, She thought (so like her love the shade appears) That Ceyx spake the words, and Ceyx shed the tears. She groaned, her inward soul with grief opprest, She sighed, she wept, and sleeping beat her breast: Then stretched her arms to embrace his body bare, Her clasping arms inclose but empty air: At this, not yet awake, she cried, “Oh stay, One is our fate, and common is our way!” So dreadful was the dream, so loud she spoke, That, starting sudden up, the slumber broke; Then cast her eyes around, in hope to view Her vanished lord, and find the vision true; For now the maids, who waited her commands, Ran in with lighted tapers in their hands. Tired with the search, not finding what she seeks, With cruel blows she pounds her blubbered cheeks; Then from her beaten breast the linen tare, And cut the golden caul that bound her hair. Her nurse demands the cause; with louder cries She prosecutes her griefs, and thus replies: “No more Alcyone, she suffered death With her loved lord, when Ceyx lost his breath: No flattery, no false comfort, give me none, My shipwrecked Ceyx is for ever gone; I saw, I saw him manifest in view, His voice, his figure, and his gestures knew: His lustre lost, and every living grace, Yet I retained the features of his face: Though with pale cheeks, wet beard, and dropping hair, None but my Ceyx could appear so fair; I would have strained him with a strict embrace, But through my arms he slipt, and vanished from the place; There, even just there he stood;”—and as she spoke, Where last the spectre was, she cast her look; Fain would she hope, and gazed upon the ground, If any printed footsteps might be found; Then sighed, and said—“This I too well foreknew, And my prophetic fear presaged too true; 'Twas what I begged, when with a bleeding heart I took my leave, and suffered thee to part, Or I to go along, or thou to stay, Never, ah never to divide our way! Happier for me, that, all our hours assigned, Together we had lived, even not in death disjoined! So had my Ceyx still been living here, Or with my Ceyx I had perished there; Now I die absent, in the vast profound, And me without myself the seas have drowned: The storms were not so cruel; should I strive To lengthen life, and such a grief survive! But neither will I strive, nor wretched thee In death forsake, but keep thee company. If not one common sepulchre contains Our bodies, or one urn our last remains, Yet Ceyx and Alcyone shall join, Their names remembered in one common line.” No further voice her mighty grief affords, For sighs come rushing in betwixt her words, And stopt her tongue; but what her tongue denied, Soft tears, and groans, and dumb complaints supplied. 'Twas morning; to the port she takes her way, And stands upon the margin of the sea; That place, that very spot of ground she sought, Or thither by her destiny was brought, Where last he stood; and while she sadly said, “'Twas here he left me, lingering here, delayed His parting kiss, and there his anchors weighed.” Thus speaking, while her thoughts past actions trace, And call to mind, admonished by the place, Sharp at her utmost ken she cast her eyes, And somewhat floating from afar descries; It seemed a corpse adrift, to distant sight, But at a distance who could judge aright? It wafted nearer yet, and then she knew, That what before she but surmised was true; A corpse it was, but whose it was, unknown, Yet moved, howe'er, she made the case her own; Took the bad omen of a shipwrecked man, As for a stranger wept, and thus began: “Poor wretch, on stormy seas to lose thy life, Unhappy thou, but more thy widowed wife!” At this she paused; for now the flowing tide Had brought the body nearer to the side: The more she looks, the more her fears increase At nearer sight, and she's herself the less: Now driven ashore, and at her feet it lies; She knows too much, in knowing whom she sees,— Her husband's corpse; at this she loudly shrieks, “'Tis he, 'tis he,” she cries, and tears her cheeks, Her hair, her vest; and, stooping to the sands, About his neck she casts her trembling hands. “And is it thus, O dearer than my life, Thus, thus return'st thou to thy longing wife!” She said, and to the neighbouring mole she strode, Raised there to break the incursions of the flood; Headlong from hence to plunge herself she springs, But shoots along supported on her wings; A bird new-made about the banks she plies, Not far from shore, and short excursions tries; Nor seeks in air her humble flight to raise, Content to skim the surface of the seas; Her bill, though slender, sends a creaking noise, And imitates a lamentable voice; Now lighting where the bloodless body lies, She with a funeral note renews her cries. At all her stretch her little wings she spread, And with her feathered arms embraced the dead; Then flickering to his pallid lips, she strove To print a kiss, the last essay of love; Whether the vital touch revived the dead, Or that the moving waters raised his head To meet the kiss, the vulgar doubt alone, For sure a present miracle was shown. The gods their shapes to winter-birds translate, But both obnoxious to their former fate. Their conjugal affection still is tied, And still the mournful race is multiplied; They bill, they tread; Alcyone compressed, Seven days sits brooding on her floating nest, A wintry queen: her sire at length is kind, Calms every storm, and hushes every wind; Prepares his empire for his daughter's ease, And for his hatching nephews smooths the seas. ÆSACUS TRANSFORMED INTO A CORMORANT. FROM THE ELEVENTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. These some old man sees wanton in the air, And praises the unhappy constant pair; Then to his friend the long-necked Cormorant shows, The former tale reviving other woes: “That sable bird,” he cries, “which cuts the flood With slender legs, was once of royal blood; His ancestors from mighty Tros proceed, The brave Laomedon and Ganymede, Whose beauty tempted Jove to steal the boy, And Priam, hapless prince! who fell with Troy; Himself was Hector's brother, and, had fate But given this hopeful youth a longer date, Perhaps had rivalled warlike Hector's worth, Though on the mother's side of meaner birth; Fair Alyxothoé, a country maid, Bare Æsacus by stealth in Ida's shade. He fled the noisy town, and pompous court, Loved the lone hills, and simple rural sport, And seldom to the city would resort. Yet he no rustic clownishness profest, Nor was soft love a stranger to his breast; The youth had long the nymph Hesperie wooed, Oft through the thicket, or the mead, pursued. Her haply on her father's bank he spied, While fearless she her silver tresses dried; Away she fled; not stags with half such speed, Before the prowling wolf, scud o'er the mead; Not ducks, when they the safer flood forsake, Pursued by hawks, so swift regain the lake, As fast he followed in the hot career; Desire the lover winged, the virgin fear. A snake unseen now pierced her heedless foot, Quick through the veins the venomed juices shoot; She fell, and 'scaped by death his fierce pursuit. Her lifeless body, frighted, he embraced, And cried, “Not this I dreaded, but thy haste; O had my love been less, or less thy fear! The victory thus bought is far too dear. Accursed snake! yet I more cursed than he! He gave the wound; the cause was given by me. Yet none shall say, that unrevenged you died.” He spoke; then climbed a cliff's o'erhanging side, And, resolute, leaped on the foaming tide. Tethys received him gently on the wave; The death he sought denied, and feathers gave. Debarred the surest remedy of grief, And forced to live, he curst the unasked relief; Then on his airy pinions upward flies, And at a second fall successless tries, The downy plume a quick descent denies. Enraged, he often dives beneath the wave, And there in vain expects to find a grave. His ceaseless sorrow for the unhappy maid Meagred his look, and on his spirits preyed. Still near the sounding deep he lives; his name From frequent diving and emerging came. THE TWELFTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES, WHOLLY TRANSLATED. CONNECTION TO THE END OF THE ELEVENTH BOOK. Æsacus, the son of Priam, loving a country life, forsakes the court; living obscurely, he falls in love with a nymph, who, flying from him, was killed by a serpent; for grief of this, he would have drowned himself; but, by the pity of the gods, is turned into a Cormorant. Priam, not hearing of Æsacus, believes him to be dead, and raises a tomb to preserve his memory. By this transition, which is one of the finest in all Ovid, the poet naturally falls into the story of the Trojan War, which is summed up in the present book; but so very briefly in many places, that Ovid seems more short than Virgil, contrary to his usual style. Yet the House of Fame, which is here described, is one of the most beautiful pieces in the whole Metamorphoses. The fight of Achilles and Cygnus, and the fray betwixt the Lapithœ and Centaurs, yield to no other part of this poet; and particularly the loves and death of Cyllarus and Hylonome, the male and female Centaur, are wonderfully moving. Priam, to whom the story was unknown, As dead, deplored his metamorphosed son; A Cenotaph his name and title kept, And Hector round the tomb, with all his brothers, wept. This pious office Paris did not share; Absent alone, and author of the war, Which, for the Spartan queen, the Grecians drew To avenge the rape, and Asia to subdue. A thousand ships were manned, to sail the sea; Nor had their just resentments found delay, Had not the winds and waves opposed their way. At Aulis, with united powers, they meet, But there, cross winds or calms detained the fleet. Now, while they raise an altar on the shore, And Jove with solemn sacrifice adore, A boding sign the priests and people see: A snake of size immense ascends a tree, And in the leafy summit spied a nest, Which, o'er her callow young, a sparrow pressed. Eight were the birds unfledged; their mother flew, And hovered round her care, but still in view; Till the fierce reptile first devoured the brood, Then seized the fluttering dam, and drank her blood. This dire ostent the fearful people view; Calchas alone, by Phœbus taught, foreknew What heaven decreed; and, with a smiling glance, Thus gratulates to Greece her happy chance. “O Argives, we shall conquer; Troy is ours, But long delays shall first afflict our powers; Nine years of labour the nine birds portend, The tenth shall in the town's destruction end. The serpent, who his maw obscene had filled, The branches in his curled embraces held; But as in spires he stood, he turned to stone; The stony snake retained the figure still his own. Yet not for this the windbound navy weighed; Slack were their sails, and Neptune disobeyed. Some thought him loath the town should be destroyed, Whose building had his hands divine employed; Not so the seer, who knew, and known foreshowed, The virgin Phœbe, with a virgin's blood, Must first be reconciled; the common cause Prevailed; and pity yielding to the laws, Fair Iphigenia, the devoted maid, Was, by the weeping priests, in linen robes arrayed. All mourn her fate, but no relief appeared; The royal victim bound, the knife already reared; When that offended Power, who caused their woe, Relenting ceased her wrath, and stopped the coming blow. A mist before the ministers she cast, And in the virgin's room a hind she placed. The oblation slain, and Phœbe reconciled, The storm was hushed, and dimpled ocean smiled; A favourable gale arose from shore, Which to the port desired the Grecian galleys bore. Full in the midst of this created space, Betwixt heaven, earth, and skies, there stands a place Confining on all three, with triple bound; Whence all things, though remote, are viewed around, And thither bring their undulating sound; The palace of loud Fame; her seat of power, Placed on the summit of a lofty tower. A thousand winding entries, long and wide, Receive of fresh reports a flowing tide; A thousand crannies in the walls are made; Nor gate nor bars exclude the busy trade. 'Tis built of brass, the better to diffuse The spreading sounds, and multiply the news; Where echoes in repeated echoes play: A mart for ever full, and open night and day. Nor silence is within, nor voice express, But a deaf noise of sounds that never cease; Confused, and chiding, like the hollow roar Of tides, receding from the insulted shore; Or like the broken thunder, heard from far, When Jove to distance drives the rolling war. The courts are filled with a tumultuous din Of crowds, or issuing forth, or entering in; A thoroughfare of news; where some devise Things never heard; some mingle truth with lies; The troubled air with empty sounds they beat; Intent to hear, and eager to repeat. Error sits brooding there; with added train Of vain credulity, and joys as vain; Suspicion, with sedition joined, are near; And rumours raised, and murmurs mixed, and panic fear. Fame sits aloft, and sees the subject ground, And seas about, and skies above, inquiring all around. The goddess gives the alarm; and soon is known The Grecian fleet, descending on the town. Fixed on defence, the Trojans are not slow To guard their shore from an expected foe. They meet in fight; by Hector's fatal hand Protesilaus falls, and bites the strand; Which with expense of blood the Grecians won, And proved the strength unknown of Priam's son; And to their cost the Trojan leaders felt The Grecian heroes, and what deaths they dealt. From these first onsets, the Sigæan shore Was strewed with carcases, and stained with gore. Neptunian Cygnus troops of Greeks had slain; Achilles in his car had scoured the plain, And cleared the Trojan ranks; where'er he fought, Cygnus, or Hector, through the fields he sought: Cygnus he found; on him his force essayed; For Hector was to the tenth year delayed. His white-maned steeds, that bowed beneath the yoke, He cheered to courage, with a gentle stroke; Then urged his fiery chariot on the foe, And rising shook his lance, in act to throw. But first he cried, “O youth, be proud to bear Thy death, ennobled by Pelides' spear.” The lance pursued the voice without delay; Nor did the whizzing weapon miss the way, But pierced his cuirass, with such fury sent, And signed his bosom with a purple dint. At this the seed of Neptune: “Goddess-born, For ornament, not use, these arms are worn; This helm, and heavy buckler, I can spare, As only decorations of the war; So Mars is armed, for glory, not for need. 'Tis somewhat more from Neptune to proceed, Than from a daughter of the sea to spring; Thy sire is mortal; mine is Ocean's king. Secure of death, I should contemn thy dart, Though naked, and impassible depart.” He said, and threw; the trembling weapon passed Through nine bull-hides, each under other placed On his broad shield, and stuck within the last. Achilles wrenched it out; and sent again The hostile gift; the hostile gift was vain. He tried a third, a tough well-chosen spear; The inviolable body stood sincere, Though Cygnus then did no defence provide, But scornful offered his unshielded side. Not otherwise the impatient hero fared, Than as a bull, encompassed with a guard, Amid the circus roars; provoked from far By sight of scarlet, and a sanguine war. They quit their ground, his bended horns elude, In vain pursuing, and in vain pursued. Before to further fight he would advance, He stood considering, and surveyed his lance. Doubts if he wielded not a wooden spear Without a point; he looked, the point was there. “This is my hand, and this my lance,” he said, By which so many thousand foes are dead. O whither is their usual virtue fled! I had it once; and the Lyrnessian wall, And Tenedos, confessed it in their fall. Thy streams, Caicus, rolled a crimson flood; And Thebes ran red with her own natives' blood. Twice Telephus employed this piercing steel, To wound him first, and afterward to heal. The vigour of this arm was never vain; And that my wonted prowess I retain, Witness these heaps of slaughter on the plain.” He said, and, doubtful of his former deeds, To some new trial of his force proceeds. He chose Menœtes from among the rest; At him he lanced his spear, and pierced his breast; On the hard earth the Lycian knocked his head, And lay supine; and forth the spirit fled. Then thus the hero: “Neither can I blame The hand, or javelin; both are still the same. The same I will employ against this foe, And wish but with the same success to throw.” So spoke the chief, and while he spoke he threw; The weapon with unerring fury flew, At his left shoulder aimed; nor entrance found; But back, as from a rock, with swift rebound Harmless returned; a bloody mark appeared, Which with false joy the flattered hero cheered. Wound there was none; the blood that was in view, The lance before from slain Menœtes drew. Headlong he leaps from off his lofty car, And in close fight on foot renews the war; Raging with high disdain, repeats his blows; Nor shield nor armour can their force oppose; Huge cantlets of his buckler strew the ground, And no defence in his bored arms is found. But on his flesh no wound or blood is seen; The sword itself is blunted on the skin. This vain attempt the chief no longer bears; But round his hollow temples and his ears, His buckler beats; the son of Neptune, stunned With these repeated buffets, quits his ground; A sickly sweat succeeds, and shades of night; Inverted nature swims before his sight: The insulting victor presses on the more, And treads the steps the vanquished trod before, Nor rest, nor respite gives. A stone there lay Behind his trembling foe, and stopped his way; Achilles took the advantage which he found, O'erturned, and pushed him backward on the ground. His buckler held him under, while he pressed, With both his knees above, his panting breast; Unlaced his helm; about his chin the twist He tied, and soon the strangled soul dismissed. With eager haste he went to strip the dead; The vanquished body from his arms was fled. His sea-god sire, to immortalise his fame, Had turned it to the bird that bears his name. A truce succeeds the labours of this day, And arms suspended with a long delay. While Trojan walls are kept with watch and ward, The Greeks before their trenches mount the guard. The feast approached; when to the blue-eyed Maid, His vows for Cygnus slain the victor paid, And a white heifer on her altar laid. The reeking entrails on the fire they threw, And to the gods the grateful odour flew; Heaven had its part in sacrifice; the rest Was broiled and roasted for the future feast. The chief invited guests were set around; And, hunger first assuaged, the bowls were crowned, Which in deep draughts their cares and labours drowned. The mellow harp did not their ears employ, And mute was all the warlike symphony; Discourse, the food of souls, was their delight, And pleasing chat prolonged the summer's night. The subject, deeds of arms; and valour shown, Or on the Trojan side, or on their own. Of dangers undertaken, fame achieved, They talked by turns, the talk by turns relieved. What things but these could fierce Achilles tell, Or what could fierce Achilles hear so well? The last great act performed, of Cygnus slain, Did most the martial audience entertain; Wondering to find a body, free by fate From steel, and which could even that steel rebate. Amazed, their admiration they renew; And scarce Pelides could believe it true. Then Nestor thus:—“What once this age has known, In fated Cygnus, and in him alone, These eyes have seen in Cæneus long before, Whose body not a thousand swords could bore. Cæneus in courage and in strength excelled, And still his Othrys with his fame is filled; But what did most his martial deeds adorn, (Though, since, he changed his sex,) a woman born.” A novelty so strange, and full of fate, His listening audience asked him to relate. Achilles thus commends their common suit:— “O father, first for prudence in repute, Tell, with that eloquence so much thy own, What thou hast heard, or what of Cæneus known; What was he, whence his change of sex begun, What trophies, joined in wars with thee, he won? Who conquered him, and in what fatal strife The youth, without a wound, could lose his life?” Neleides then:—“Though tardy age, and time, Have shrunk my sinews, and decayed my prime; Though much I have forgotten of my store, Yet, not exhausted, I remember more. Of all that arms achieved, or peace designed, That action still is fresher in my mind Than aught beside. If reverend age can give To faith a sanction, in my third I live. “'Twas in my second century, I surveyed Young Cænis, then a fair Thessalian maid. Cænis the bright was born to high command; A princess, and a native of thy land, Divine Achilles; every tongue proclaimed Her beauty, and her eyes all hearts inflamed. Peleus, thy sire, perhaps had sought her bed, Among the rest; but he had either led Thy mother then, or was by promise tied; But she to him, and all, alike her love denied. “It was her fortune once, to take her way Along the sandy margin of the sea; The Power of Ocean viewed her as she passed, And, loved as soon as seen, by force embraced. So fame reports. Her virgin treasure seized, And his new joys the ravisher so pleased, That thus, transported, to the nymph he cried, ‘Ask what thou wilt, no prayer shall be denied.’ This also fame relates; the haughty fair, Who not the rape even of a god could bear, This answer, proud, returned:—‘To mighty wrongs, A mighty recompense, of right, belongs. Give me no more to suffer such a shame; But change the woman for a better name; One gift for all.’—She said, and, while she spoke, A stern, majestic, manly tone she took. A man she was; and, as the Godhead swore, To Cæneus turned, who Cænis was before. “To this the lover adds, without request, No force of steel should violate his breast. Glad of the gift, the new-made warrior goes, And arms among the Greeks, and longs for equal foes. “Now brave Pirithous, bold Ixion's son, The love of fair Hippodame had won. The cloud-begotten race, half men, half beast, Invited, came to grace the nuptial feast. In a cool cave's recess the treat was made, Whose entrance trees with spreading boughs o'ershade. They sat: and, summoned by the bridegroom, came, To mix with those, the Lapithæan name: Nor wanted I; the roofs with joy resound; And ‘Hymen, Iö Hymen,’ rung around. Raised altars shone with holy fires; the bride, Lovely herself (and lovely by her side A bevy of bright nymphs, with sober grace,) Came glittering like a star, and took her place; Her heavenly form beheld, all wished her joy, And little wanted, but in vain their wishes all employ. “For one, most brutal of the brutal blood, Or whether wine or beauty fired his blood, Or both at once, beheld with lustful eyes The bride; at once resolved to make his prize. Down went the board, and, fastening on her hair, He seized with sudden force the frighted fair. 'Twas Eurytus began; his bestial kind His crime pursued; and each as pleased his mind, Or her, whom chance presented, took; the feast An image of a taken town expressed. “The cave resounds with female shrieks: we rise, Mad with revenge, to make a swift reprise: And Theseus first:—‘What frenzy has possessed, O Eurytus,’ he cried, ‘thy brutal breast, To wrong Pirithous, and not him alone, But, while I live, two friends conjoined in one?’ “To justify his threat, he thrusts aside The crowd of Centaurs, and redeems the bride. The monster nought replied; for words were vain, And deeds could only deeds unjust maintain; But answers with his hand, and forward pressed, With blows redoubled, on his face and breast. An ample goblet stood, of antique mould, And rough with figures of the rising gold; The hero snatched it up, and tossed in air Full at the front of the foul ravisher: He falls, and falling vomits forth a flood Of wine, and foam, and brains, and mingled blood. Half roaring, and half neighing through the hall, ‘Arms, arms!’ the double-formed with fury call, To wreak their brother's death. A medley flight Of bowls and jars, at first, supply the fight, Once instruments of feasts, but now of fate; Wine animates their rage, and arms their hate. “Bold Amycus from the robbed vestry brings The chalices of heaven, and holy things Of precious weight; a sconce, that hung on high, With tapers filled, to light the sacristy, Torn from the cord, with his unhallowed hand He threw amid the Lapithæan band. On Celadon the ruin fell, and left His face of feature and of form bereft; So, when some brawny sacrificer knocks, Before an altar led, an offered ox, His eyeballs, rooted out, are thrown to ground, His nose dismantled in his mouth is found, His jaws, cheeks, front, one undistinguished wound. “This, Belates, the avenger, could not brook; But, by the foot, a maple-board he took, And hurled at Amycus; his chin is bent Against his chest, and down the Centaur sent, Whom, sputtering bloody teeth, the second blow Of his drawn sword dispatched to shades below. “Grineus was near; and cast a furious look On the side-altar, censed with sacred smoke, And bright with flaming fires; ‘The gods,’ he cried, ‘Have with their holy trade our hands supplied: Why use we not their gifts?’—Then from the floor An altar-stone he heaved, with all the load it bore; Altar and altar's freight together flew, Where thickest thronged the Lapithæan crew, And, Broteas and at once Oryus slew. Oryus' mother, Mycale, was known Down from her sphere to draw the labouring moon. “Exadius cried: ‘Unpunished shall not go This fact, if arms are found against the foe.’ He looked about, where on a pine were spread The votive horns of a stag's branching head: At Grineus these he throws; so just they fly, That the sharp antlers stuck in either eye. Breathless and blind he fell; with blood besmeared, His eyeballs beaten out hung dangling on his beard. Fierce Rhætus from the hearth a burning brand Selects, and whirling waves, till from his hand The fire took flame; then dashed it from the right, On fair Charaxus' temples, near the sight: The whistling pest came on, and pierced the bone, And caught the yellow hair, that shrivelled while it shone; Caught, like dry stubble fired, or like seerwood; Yet from the wound ensued no purple flood, But looked a bubbling mass of frying blood. His blazing locks sent forth a crackling sound, And hissed, like red-hot iron within the smithy drowned. The wounded warrior shook his flaming hair, Then (what a team of horse could hardly rear,) He heaves the threshold-stone, but could not throw; The weight itself forbade the threatened blow; Which, dropping from his lifted arms, came down Full on Cometes' head, and crushed his crown. Nor Rhætus then retained his joy; but said, ‘So by their fellows may our foes be sped.’ Then with redoubled strokes he plies his head: The burning lever not deludes his pains, But drives the battered skull within the brains. “Thus flushed, the conqueror, with force renewed, Evagrus, Dryas, Corythus, pursued. First, Corythus, with downy cheeks, he slew; Whose fall when fierce Evagrus had in view, He cried, ‘What palm is from a beardless prey?’ Rhætus prevents what more he had to say; And drove within his mouth the fiery death, Which entered hissing in, and choked his breath. At Dryas next he flew; but weary chance No longer would the same success advance; But, while he whirled in fiery circles round The brand, a sharpened stake strong Dryas found, And in the shoulder's joint inflicts the wound. The weapon struck; which, roaring out with pain, He drew; nor longer durst the fight maintain, But turned his back for fear, and fled amain. With him fled Orneus, with like dread possessed; Thaumas and Medon, wounded in the breast, And Mermeros, in the late race renowned, Now limping ran, and tardy with his wound. Pholus and Melaneus from fight withdrew, And Abas maimed, who boars encountering slew; And augur Astylos, whose art in vain From fight dissuaded the four-footed train, Now beat the hoof with Nessus on the plain; But to his fellow cried, ‘Be safely slow; Thy death deferred is due to great Alcides' bow.’ “Meantime, strong Dryas urged his chance so well, That Lycidas, Areos, Imbreus fell; All, one by one, and fighting face to face: Crenæus fled, to fall with more disgrace; For, fearful while he looked behind, he bore, Betwixt his nose and front, the blow before. Amid the noise and tumult of the fray, Snoring and drunk with wine, Aphidas lay. Even then the bowl within his hand he kept, And on a bear's rough hide securely slept. Him Phorbas with his flying dart transfixed; ‘Take thy next draught with Stygian waters mixed, And sleep thy fill,’ the insulting victor cried; Surprised with death unfelt, the Centaur died: The ruddy vomit, as he breathed his soul, Repassed his throat, and filled his empty bowl. “I saw Petræus' arms employed around A well-grown oak, to root it from the ground. This way, and that, he wrenched the fibrous bands; The trunk was like a sapling in his hands, And still obeyed the bent: while thus he stood, Pirithous' dart drove on, and nailed him to the wood. Lycus and Chromys fell, by him oppressed: Helops and Dictys added to the rest A nobler palm: Helops, through either ear Transfixed, received the penetrating spear. This Dictys saw; and, seized with sudden fright, Leapt headlong from the hill of steepy height, And crushed an ash beneath, that could not bear his weight. The shattered tree receives his fall, and strikes, Within his full-blown paunch, the sharpened spikes. Strong Aphareus had heaved a mighty stone, The fragment of a rock, and would have thrown; But Theseus, with a club of hardened oak, The cubit-bone of the bold Centaur broke, And left him maimed, nor seconded the stroke; Then leapt on tall Bianor's back; (who bore No mortal burden but his own, before,) Pressed with his knees his sides; the double man, His speed with spurs increased, unwilling ran. One hand the hero fastened on his locks; His other plied him with repeated strokes. The club hung round his ears, and battered brows; He falls; and, lashing up his heels, his rider throws. “The same Herculean arms Nedymnus wound, And lay by him Lycotas on the ground; And Hippasus, whose beard his breast invades; And Ripheus, haunter of the woodland shades; And Tereus, used with mountain-bears to strive; And from their dens to draw the indignant beasts alive. “Demoleon could not bear this hateful sight, Or the long fortune of the Athenian knight; But pulled with all his force, to disengage From earth a pine, the product of an age. The root stuck fast: the broken trunk he sent At Theseus: Theseus frustrates his intent, And leaps aside, by Pallas warned, the blow To shun: (for so he said; and we believed it so.) Yet not in vain the enormous weight was cast, Which Crantor's body sundered at the waist: Thy father's squire, Achilles, and his care; Whom, conquered in the Dolopeian war, Their king, his present ruin to prevent, A pledge of peace implored, to Peleus sent. Thy sire, with grieving eyes, beheld his fate; And cried, ‘Not long, loved Crantor, shalt thou wait Thy vowed revenge.’ At once he said, and threw His ashen-spear, which quivered as it flew, With all his force and all his soul applied; The sharp point entered in the Centaur's side: Both hands, to wrench it out, the monster joined, And wrenched it out, but left the steel behind. Stuck in his lungs it stood; enraged he rears His hoofs, and down to ground thy father bears. Thus trampled under foot, his shield defends His head; his other hand the lance protends. Even while he lay extended on the dust, He sped the Centaur, with one single thrust. Two more his lance before transfixed from far, And two his sword had slain in closer war. To these was added Dorylas; who spread A bull's two goring horns around his head. With these he pushed; in blood already dyed, Him, fearless, I approached, and thus defied: ‘Now, monster, now, by proof it shall appear, Whether thy horns are sharper, or my spear.’ At this, I threw; for want of other ward, He lifted up his hand, his front to guard. His hand it passed, and fixed it to his brow. Loud shouts of ours attend the lucky blow: Him Peleus finished, with a second wound, Which through the navel pierced; he reeled around, And dragged his dangling bowels on the ground; Trod what he dragged, and what he trod he crushed; And to his mother earth, with empty belly, rushed. “Nor could thy form, O Cyllarus, foreshow Thy fate, if form to monsters men allow: Just bloomed thy beard, thy beard of golden hue; Thy locks, in golden waves, about thy shoulders flew. Sprightly thy look; thy shapes in every part So clean, as might instruct the sculptor's art, As far as man extended; where began The beast, the beast was equal to the man. Add but a horse's head and neck, and he, O Castor, was a courser worthy thee. So was his back proportioned for the seat; So rose his brawny chest; so swiftly moved his feet. Coal-black his colour, but like jet it shone; His legs and flowing tail were white alone. Beloved by many maidens of his kind, But fair Hylonome possessed his mind; Hylonome, for features, and for face, Excelling all the nymphs of double race. Nor less her blandishments, than beauty, move; At once both loving, and confessing love. For him she dressed; for him with female care She combed, and set in curls, her auburn hair. Of roses, violets, and lilies mixed, And sprigs of flowing rosemary betwixt, She formed the chaplet, that adorned her front; In waters of the Pegasæan fount, And in the streams that from the fountain play, She washed her face, and bathed her twice a day. The scarf of furs, that hung below her side, Was ermine, or the panther's spotted pride; Spoils of no common beast. With equal flame They loved; their sylvan pleasures were the same: All day they hunted; and when day expired, Together to some shady cave retired. Invited, to the nuptials both repair; And, side by side, they both engage in war. “Uncertain from what hand, a flying dart At Cyllarus was sent, which pierced his heart. The javelin drawn from out the mortal wound, He faints with staggering steps, and seeks the ground: The fair within her arms received his fall, And strove his wandering spirits to recall; And while her hand the streaming blood opposed, Joined face to face, his lips with hers she closed. Stifled with kisses, a sweet death he dies; She fills the fields with undistinguished cries; At least her words were in her clamour drowned; For my stunned ears received no vocal sound. In madness of her grief, she seized the dart New-drawn, and reeking from her lover's heart; To her bare bosom the sharp point applied, And wounded fell; and, falling by his side, Embraced him in her arms, and thus embracing died. “Even still, methinks, I see Phæocomes; Strange was his habit, and as odd his dress. Six lions' hides, with thongs together fast, His upper part defended to his waist; And where man ended, the continued vest, Spread on his back, the houss and trappings of a beast. A stump too heavy for a team to draw, (It seems a fable, though the fact I saw,) He threw at Pholon; the descending blow Divides the skull, and cleaves his head in two. The brains, from nose and mouth, and either ear, Came issuing out, as through a colander The curdled milk; or from the press the whey, Driven down by weights above, is drained away. “But him, while stooping down to spoil the slain, Pierced through the paunch, I tumbled on the plain. Then Chthonius and Teleboas I slew; A fork the former armed; a dart his fellow threw: The javelin wounded me; behold the scar. Then was my time to seek the Trojan war; Then I was Hector's match in open field; But he was then unborn, at least a child; Now, I am nothing. I forbear to tell By Periphantes how Pyretus fell, The Centaur by the Knight; nor will I stay On Amphix, or what deaths he dealt that day; What honour, with a pointless lance, he won, Stuck in the front of a four-footed man; What fame young Macareus obtained in fight, Or dwell on Nessus, now returned from flight; How prophet Mopsus not alone divined, Whose valour equalled his foreseeing mind. “Already Cæneus, with his conquering hand, Had slaughtered five, the boldest of their band; Pyrachmus, Helymus, Antimachus, Bromus the brave, and stronger Stiphelus; Their names I numbered, and remember well, No trace remaining, by what wounds they fell. “Latreus, the bulkiest of the double race, Whom the spoiled arms of slain Halesus grace, In years retaining still his youthful might, Though his black hairs were interspersed with white, Betwixt the embattled ranks began to prance, Proud of his helm, and Macedonian lance; And rode the ring around, that either host Might hear him, while he made this empty boast: ‘And from a strumpet shall we suffer shame? For Cænis still, not Cæneus, is thy name; And still the native softness of thy kind Prevails, and leaves the woman in thy mind. Remember what thou wert; what price was paid To change thy sex, to make thee not a maid; And but a man in show; go card and spin, And leave the business of the war to men.’ “While thus the boaster exercised his pride, The fatal spear of Cæneus reached his side; Just in the mixture of the kinds it ran, Betwixt the nether breast and upper man. The monster, mad with rage, and stung with smart, His lance directed at the hero's heart: It strook; but bounded from his hardened breast, Like hail from tiles, which the safe house invest; Nor seemed the stroke with more effect to come, Than a small pebble falling on a drum. He next his falchion tried, in closer fight; But the keen falchion had no power to bite. He thrust; the blunted point returned again:— ‘Since downright blows,’ he cried, ‘and thrusts are vain, I'll prove his side;’—in strong embraces held, He proved his side; his side the sword repelled; His hollow belly echoed to the stroke: Untouched his body, as a solid rock; Aimed at his neck at last, the blade in shivers broke. “The impassive knight stood idle, to deride His rage, and offered oft his naked side; At length, ‘Now, monster, in thy turn,’ he cried, ‘Try thou the strength of Cæneus:’—at the word He thrust; and in his shoulder plunged the sword. Then writhed his hand; and, as he drove it down Deep in his breast, made many wounds in one. “The Centaurs saw, enraged, the unhoped success, And, rushing on in crowds, together press. At him, and him alone, their darts they threw; Repulsed they from his fated body flew. Amazed they stood; till Monychus began,— ‘O shame, a nation conquered by a man! A woman-man; yet more a man is he, Than all our race; and what he was, are we. Now, what avail our nerves? the united force Of two the strongest creatures, man and horse? Nor goddess-born, nor of Ixion's seed We seem, (a lover built for Juno's bed,) Mastered by this half man. Whole mountains throw With woods at once, and bury him below. This only way remains. Nor need we doubt To choke the soul within, though not to force it out. Heap weights, instead of wounds:’—he chanced to see Where southern storms had rooted up a tree; This, raised from earth, against the foe he threw; The example shown, his fellow brutes pursue. With forest-loads the warrior they invade; Othrys and Pelion soon were void of shade, And spreading groves were naked mountains made. Pressed with the burden, Cæneus pants for breath, And on his shoulders bears the wooden death. To heave the intolerable weight he tries; At length it rose above his mouth and eyes. Yet still he heaves; and, struggling with despair, Shakes all aside, and gains a gulp of air; A short relief, which but prolongs his pain: He faints by fits, and then respires again. At last, the burden only nods above, As when an earthquake stirs the Idæan grove. Doubtful his death; he suffocated seemed To most; but otherwise our Mopsus deemed, Who said he saw a yellow bird arise From out the pile, and cleave the liquid skies. I saw it too, with golden feathers bright, Nor e'er before beheld so strange a sight; Whom Mopsus viewing, as it soared around Our troop, and heard the pinions' rattling sound, ‘All hail,’ he cried, ‘thy country's grace and love; Once first of men below, now first of birds above!’— Its author to the story gave belief; For us, our courage was increased by grief: Ashamed to see a single man, pursued With odds, to sink beneath a multitude, We pushed the foe, and forced to shameful flight: Part fell, and part escaped by favour of the night.” This tale, by Nestor told, did much displease Tlepolemus, the seed of Hercules; For often he had heard his father say, That he himself was present at the fray, And more than shared the glories of the day. “Old Chronicle,” he said, “among the rest, You might have named Alcides at the least; Is he not worth your praise?”—The Pylian prince Sighed ere he spoke, then made this proud defence:— “My former woes, in long oblivion drowned, I would have lost, but you renew the wound; Better to pass him o'er, than to relate The cause I have your mighty sire to hate. His fame has filled the world, and reached the sky; Which, oh, I wish with truth I could deny! We praise not Hector, though his name we know Is great in arms; 'tis hard to praise a foe. He, your great father, levelled to the ground Messenia's tower; nor better fortune found Elis, and Pylas; that, a neighbouring state, And this, my own; both guiltless of their fate. To pass the rest, twelve, wanting one, he slew, My brethren, who their birth from Neleus drew; All youths of early promise, had they lived; By him they perished; I alone survived. The rest were easy conquest; but the fate Of Periclymenos is wondrous to relate. To him our common grandsire of the main Had given to change his form, and, changed, resume again. Varied at pleasure, every shape he tried, And in all beasts Alcides still defied; Vanquished on earth, at length he soared above, Changed to the bird, that bears the bolt of Jove. The new dissembled eagle, now endued With beak and pounces, Hercules pursued, And cuffed his manly cheeks, and tore his face, Then, safe retired, and towered in empty space. Alcides bore not long his flying foe, But, bending his inevitable bow, Reached him in air, suspended as he stood, And in his pinion fixed the feathered wood. Light was the wound; but in the sinew hung The point, and his disabled wing unstrung. He wheeled in air, and stretched his vans in vain; His vans no longer could his flight sustain; For, while one gathered wind, one unsupplied Hung drooping down, nor poised his other side. He fell; the shaft, that slightly was impressed, Now from his heavy fall with weight increased, Drove through his neck aslant; he spurns the ground, And the soul issues through the weazand's wound. “Now, brave commander of the Rhodian seas, What praise is due from me to Hercules? Silence is all the vengeance I decree For my slain brothers; but 'tis peace with thee.” Thus with a flowing tongue old Nestor spoke; Then, to full bowls each other they provoke; At length, with weariness and wine opprest, They rise from table, and withdraw to rest. The sire of Cygnus, monarch of the main, Meantime laments his son in battle slain; And vows the victor's death, nor vows in vain. For nine long years the smothered pain he bore; Achilles was not ripe for fate before; Then when he saw the promised hour was near, He thus bespoke the god, that guides the year:— “Immortal offspring of my brother Jove, My brightest nephew, and whom best I love, Whose hands were joined with mine, to raise the wall Of tottering Troy, now nodding to her fall; Dost thou not mourn our power employed in vain, And the defenders of our city slain? To pass the rest, could noble Hector lie Unpitied, dragged around his native Troy? And yet the murderer lives; himself by far A greater plague, than all the wasteful war: He lives; the proud Pelides lives, to boast Our town destroyed, our common labour lost. O could I meet him! But I wish too late, To prove my trident is not in his fate. But let him try (for that's allowed) thy dart, And pierce his only penetrable part.” Apollo bows to the superior throne, And to his uncle's anger adds his own; Then, in a cloud involved, he takes his flight, Where Greeks and Trojans mixed in mortal fight; And found out Paris, lurking where he stood, And stained his arrows with plebeian blood. Phœbus to him alone the god confessed, Then to the recreant knight he thus addressed:— “Dost thou not blush, to spend thy shafts in vain On a degenerate and ignoble train? If fame, or better vengeance, be thy care, There aim, and with one arrow end the war.” He said; and showed from far the blazing shield And sword, which but Achilles none could wield; And how he moved a god, and mowed the standing field. The deity himself directs aright The envenomed shaft, and wings the fatal flight. Thus fell the foremost of the Grecian name, And he, the base adulterer, boasts the fame; A spectacle to glad the Trojan train, And please old Priam, after Hector slain. If by a female hand he had foreseen He was to die, his wish had rather been The lance and double axe of the fair warrior queen. And now, the terror of the Trojan field, The Grecian honour, ornament, and shield, High on a pile, the unconquered chief is placed; The god, that armed him first, consumed at last. Of all the mighty man, the small remains A little urn, and scarcely filled, contains; Yet, great in Homer, still Achilles lives, And, equal to himself, himself survives. His buckler owns its former lord, and brings New cause of strife betwixt contending kings; Who worthiest, after him, his sword to wield, Or wear his armour, or sustain his shield. Even Diomede sat mute, with downcast eyes, Conscious of wanted worth to win the prize; Nor Menelaus presumed these arms to claim, Nor he the king of men, a greater name. Two rivals only rose; Laertes' son, And the vast bulk of Ajax Telamon. The king, who cherished each with equal love, And from himself all envy would remove, Left both to be determined by the laws, And to the Grecian chiefs transferred the cause. THE SPEECHES OF AJAX AND ULYSSES, FROM THE THIRTEENTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. The chiefs were set, the soldiers crowned the field; To these the master of the sevenfold shield Upstarted fierce; and, kindled with disdain, Eager to speak, unable to contain His boiling rage, he rolled his eyes around The shore, and Grecian galleys hauled aground. Then stretching out his hands, “O Jove,” he cried, “Must then our cause before the fleet be tried? And dares Ulysses for the prize contend, In sight of what he durst not once defend But basely fled, that memorable day, When I from Hector's hands redeemed the flaming prey? So much 'tis safer at the noisy bar With words to flourish, than engage in war. By different methods we maintain our right, Nor am I made to talk, nor he to fight. In bloody fields I labour to be great; His arms are a smooth tongue, and soft deceit. Nor need I speak my deeds, for those you see; The sun and day are witnesses for me. Let him, who fights unseen, relate his own, And vouch the silent stars, and conscious moon. Great is the prize demanded, I confess, But such an abject rival makes it less. That gift, those honours, he but hoped to gain, Can leave no room for Ajax to be vain; Losing he wins, because his name will be Ennobled by defeat, who durst contend with me. Were mine own valour questioned, yet my blood Without that plea would make my title good; My sire was Telamon, whose arms, employed With Hercules, these Trojan walls destroyed; And who before, with Jason, sent from Greece, In the first ship brought home the golden fleece: Great Telamon from Æacus derives His birth: (the inquisitor of guilty lives In shades below; where Sisyphus, whose son This thief is thought, rolls up the restless heavy stone.) Just Æacus the king of gods above Begot; thus Ajax is the third from Jove. Nor should I seek advantage from my line, Unless, Achilles, it were mixed with thine: As next of kin Achilles' arms I claim; This fellow would ingraft a foreign name Upon our stock, and the Sisyphian seed By fraud and theft asserts his father's breed. Then must I lose these arms, because I came To fight uncalled, a voluntary name? Nor shunned the cause, but offered you my aid, While he, long lurking, was to war betrayed: Forced to the field he came, but in the rear, And feigned distraction, to conceal his fear; Till one more cunning caught him in the snare, Ill for himself, and dragged him into war. Now let a hero's arms a coward vest, And he, who shunned all honours, gain the best; And let me stand excluded from my right, Robbed of my kinsman's arms, who first appeared in fight. Better for us at home he had remained, Had it been true the madness which he feigned, Or so believed; the less had been our shame, The less his counselled crime, which brands the Grecian name; Nor Philoctetes had been left inclosed In a bare isle, to wants and pains exposed; Where to the rocks, with solitary groans, His sufferings and our baseness he bemoans, And wishes (so may heaven his wish fulfil!) The due reward to him who caused his ill. Now he, with us to Troy's destruction sworn, Our brother of the war, by whom are borne Alcides' arrows, pent in narrow bounds, With cold and hunger pinched, and pained with wounds, To find him food and clothing, must employ Against the birds the shafts due to the fate of Troy: Yet still he lives, and lives from treason free, Because he left Ulysses' company; Poor Palamede might wish, so void of aid, Rather to have been left, than so to death betrayed. The coward bore the man immortal spite, Who shamed him out of madness into fight; Nor daring otherwise to vent his hate, Accused him first of treason to the State; And then, for proof, produced the golden store Himself had hidden in his tent before. Thus of two champions he deprived our host, By exile one, and one by treason lost. Thus fights Ulysses, thus his fame extends, A formidable man, but to his friends; Great, for what greatness is in words and sound; Even faithful Nestor less in both is found; But, that he might without a rival reign, He left this faithful Nestor on the plain; Forsook his friend even at his utmost need, Who, tired, and tardy with his wounded steed, Cried out for aid, and called him by his name; But cowardice has neither ears nor shame. Thus fled the good old man, bereft of aid, And, for as much as lay in him, betrayed. That this is not a fable forged by me, Like one of his, an Ulyssean lie, I vouch even Diomede, who, though his friend, Cannot that act excuse, much less defend: He called him back aloud, and taxed his fear; And sure enough he heard, but durst not hear. “The gods with equal eyes on mortals look; He justly was forsaken, who forsook; Wanted that succour he refused to lend, Found every fellow such another friend. No wonder if he roared, that all might hear His elocution was increased by fear; I heard, I ran, I found him out of breath, Pale, trembling, and half-dead with fear of death. Though he had judged himself by his own laws, And stood condemned, I helped the common cause: With my broad buckler hid him from the foe, (Even the shield trembled as he lay below,) And from impending fate the coward freed; Good heaven forgive me for so bad a deed! If still he will persist, and urge the strife, First let him give me back his forfeit life; Let him return to that opprobrious field, Again creep under my protecting shield; Let him lie wounded, let the foe be near, And let his quivering heart confess his fear; There put him in the very jaws of fate, And let him plead his cause in that estate; And yet, when snatched from death, when from below My lifted shield I loosed, and let him go, Good heavens, how light he rose! with what a bound He sprung from earth, forgetful of his wound! How fresh, how eager then his feet to ply! Who had not strength to stand, had speed to fly! “Hector came on, and brought the gods along; Fear seized alike the feeble and the strong; Each Greek was an Ulysses; such a dread The approach, and even the sound, of Hector bred; Him, fleshed with slaughter, and with conquest crowned, I met, and overturned him to the ground. When after, matchless as he deemed in might, He challenged all our host to single fight, All eyes were fixed on me; the lots were thrown, But for your champion I was wished alone. Your vows were heard; we fought, and neither yield; Yet I returned unvanquished from the field. With Jove to friend, the insulting Trojan came, And menaced us with force, our fleet with flame; Was it the strength of this tongue-valiant lord, In that black hour, that saved you from the sword? Or was my breast exposed alone, to brave A thousand swords, a thousand ships to save, The hopes of your return? and can you yield, For a saved fleet, less than a single shield? Think it no boast, O Grecians, if I deem These arms want Ajax, more than Ajax them: Or, I with them an equal honour share; They, honoured to be worn, and I, to wear. Will he compare my courage with his slight? As well he may compare the day with night. Night is indeed the province of his reign; Yet all his dark exploits no more contain Than a spy taken, and a sleeper slain; A priest made prisoner, Pallas made a prey; But none of all these actions done by day; Nor aught of these was done, and Diomede away. If on such petty merits you confer So vast a prize, let each his portion share; Make a just dividend; and, if not all, The greater part to Diomede will fall. But why for Ithacus such arms as those, Who naked, and by night, invades his foes? The glittering helm by moonlight will proclaim The latent robber, and prevent his game; Nor could he hold his tottering head upright Beneath that motion, or sustain the weight; Nor that right arm could toss the beamy lance, Much less the left that ampler shield advance; Ponderous with precious weight, and rough with cost Of the round world in rising gold embossed. That orb would ill become his hand to wield, And look, as for the gold he stole the shield; Which should your error on the wretch bestow, It would not frighten, but allure the foe. Why asks he what avails him not in fight, And would but cumber and retard his flight, In which his only excellence is placed? You give him death, that intercept his haste. Add, that his own is yet a maiden-shield, Nor the least dint has suffered in the field, Guiltless of fight; mine, battered, hewed, and bored, Worn out of service, must forsake his lord. What further need of words our right to scan? My arguments are deeds, let action speak the man. Since from a champion's arms the strife arose, So cast the glorious prize amid the foes; Then send us to redeem both arms and shield, And let him wear, who wins them in the field.” He said:—A murmur from the multitude, Or somewhat like a stifled shout, ensued; Till from his seat arose Laertes' son, Looked down a while, and paused ere he begun; Then to the expecting audience raised his look, And not without prepared attention spoke; Soft was his tone, and sober was his face, Action his words, and words his action grace. “If heaven, my lords, had heard our common prayer, These arms had caused no quarrel for an heir; Still great Achilles had his own possessed, And we with great Achilles had been blessed: But since hard fate, and heaven's severe decree, Have ravished him away from you and me, (At this he sighed, and wiped his eyes, and drew, Or seemed to draw, some drops of kindly dew,) Who better can succeed Achilles lost, Than he who gave Achilles to your host? This only I request, that neither he May gain, by being what he seems to be, A stupid thing, nor I may lose the prize, By having sense, which heaven to him denies; Since, great or small, the talent I enjoyed Was ever in the common cause employed: Nor let my wit, and wonted eloquence, Which often has been used in your defence And in my own, this only time be brought To bear against myself, and deemed a fault. Make not a crime, where nature made it none; For every man may freely use his own. The deeds of long descended ancestors Are but by grace of imputation ours, Theirs in effect; but since he draws his line From Jove, and seems to plead a right divine, From Jove, like him, I claim my pedigree, And am descended in the same degree. My sire, Laertes, was Arcesius' heir, Arcesius was the son of Jupiter; No parricide, no banished man, is known In all my line; let him excuse his own. Hermes ennobles too my mother's side, By both my parents to the gods allied. But not because that on the female part My blood is better, dare I claim desert, Or that my sire from parricide is free; But judge by merit betwixt him and me. The prize be to the best; provided yet, That Ajax for a while his kin forget, And his great sire, and greater uncle's name, To fortify by them his feeble claim. Be kindred and relation laid aside, And honour's cause by laws of honour tried; For, if he plead proximity of blood, That empty title is with ease withstood. Peleus, the hero's sire, more nigh than he, And Pyrrhus, his undoubted progeny, Inherit first these trophies of the field; To Scyros, or to Phthia, send the shield: And Teucer has an uncle's right, yet he Waves his pretensions, nor contends with me. “Then, since the cause on pure desert is placed, Whence shall I take my rise, what reckon last? I not presume on every act to dwell, But take these few, in order as they fell. “Thetis, who knew the fates, applied her care To keep Achilles in disguise from war; And, till the threatening influence were past, A woman's habit on the hero cast: All eyes were cozened by the borrowed vest, And Ajax (never wiser than the rest) Found no Pelides there. At length I came With proffered wares to this pretended dame; She, not discovered by her mien or voice, Betrayed her manhood by her manly choice; And, while on female toys her fellows look, Grasped in her warlike hand, a javelin shook; Whom, by this act revealed, I thus bespoke:— ‘O goddess-born! resist not heaven's decree, The fall of Ilium is reserved for thee;’ Then seized him, and, produced in open light, Sent blushing to the field the fatal knight. Mine then are all his actions of the war; Great Telephus was conquered by my spear, And after cured; to me the Thebans owe, Lesbos and Tenedos, their overthrow; Scyros and Cylla; not on all to dwell, By me Lyrnessus and strong Chrysa fell; And, since I sent the man who Hector slew, To me the noble Hector's death is due. Those arms I put into his living hand; Those arms, Pelides dead, I now demand. “When Greece was injured in the Spartan prince, And met at Aulis to revenge the offence, 'Twas a dead calm, or adverse blasts, that reigned, And in the port the windbound fleet detained: Bad signs were seen, and oracles severe Were daily thundered in our general's ear, That by his daughter's blood we must appease Diana's kindled wrath, and free the seas. Affection, interest, fame, his heart assailed, But soon the father o'er the king prevailed; Bold, on himself he took the pious crime, As angry with the gods as they with him. No subject could sustain their sovereign's look, Till this hard enterprise I undertook; I only durst the imperial power control, And undermined the parent in his soul; Forced him to exert the king for common good, And pay our ransom with his daughter's blood. Never was cause more difficult to plead, Than where the judge against himself decreed; Yet this I won by dint of argument. The wrongs his injured brother underwent, And his own office, shamed him to consent. “'Twas harder yet to move the mother's mind, And to this heavy task was I designed: Reasons against her love I knew were vain; I circumvented whom I could not gain. Had Ajax been employed, our slackened sails Had still at Aulis waited happy gales. “Arrived at Troy, your choice was fixed on me, A fearless envoy, fit for a bold embassy. Secure, I entered through the hostile court, Glittering with steel, and crowded with resort: There, in the midst of arms, I plead our cause, Urge the foul rape, and violated laws; Accuse the foes as authors of the strife, Reproach the ravisher, demand the wife. Priam, Antenor, and the wiser few, I moved; but Paris and his lawless crew Scarce held their hands, and lifted swords; but stood In act to quench their impious thirst of blood. This Menelaus knows; exposed to share With me the rough preludium of the war. “Endless it were to tell what I have done, In arms, or counsel, since the siege begun. The first encounters past, the foe repelled, They skulked within the town, we kept the field. War seemed asleep for nine long years; at length, Both sides resolved to push, we tried our strength. Now what did Ajax while our arms took breath, Versed only in the gross mechanic trade of death? If you require my deeds, with ambushed arms I trapped the foe, or tired with false alarms; Secured the ships, drew lines along the plain, The fainting cheered, chastised the rebel-train, Provided forage, our spent arms renewed; Employed at home, or sent abroad, the common cause pursued. “The king, deluded in a dream by Jove, Despaired to take the town, and ordered to remove. What subject durst arraign the power supreme, Producing Jove to justify his dream? Ajax might wish the soldiers to retain From shameful flight, but wishes were in vain; As wanting of effect had been his words, Such as of course his thundering tongue affords. But did this boaster threaten, did he pray, Or by his own example urge their stay? None, none of these, but ran himself away. I saw him run, and was ashamed to see; Who plied his feet so fast to get aboard as he? Then speeding through the place, I made a stand, And loudly cried, ‘O base degenerate band, To leave a town already in your hand! After so long expense of blood, for fame, To bring home nothing but perpetual shame!’— These words, or what I have forgotten since, For grief inspired me then with eloquence, Reduced their minds; they leave the crowded port, And to their late forsaken camp resort. Dismayed the council met; this man was there, But mute, and not recovered of his fear: Thersites taxed the king, and loudly railed, But his wide opening mouth with blows I sealed. Then, rising, I excite their souls to fame, And kindle sleeping virtue into flame. From thence, whatever he performed in fight Is justly mine, who drew him back from flight. “Which of the Grecian chiefs consorts with thee? But Diomede desires my company, And still communicates his praise with me. As guided by a god, secure he goes, Armed with my fellowship, amid the foes; And sure no little merit I may boast, Whom such a man selects from such an host. Unforced by lots, I went without affright, To dare with him the dangers of the night; On the same errand sent, we met the spy Of Hector, double-tongued, and used to lie; Him I dispatched, but not till, undermined, I drew him first to tell what treacherous Troy designed. My task performed, with praise I had retired, But, not content with this, to greater praise aspired; Invaded Rhœsus, and his Thracian crew, And him, and his, in their own strength, I slew: Returned a victor, all my vows complete, With the king's chariot, in his royal seat. Refuse me now his arms, whose fiery steeds Were promised to the spy for his nocturnal deeds; And let dull Ajax bear away my right, When all his days outbalance this one night. “Nor fought I darkling still; the sun beheld With slaughtered Lycians when I strewed the field: You saw, and counted as I passed along, Alaster, Cromius, Ceranos the strong, Alcander, Prytanis, and Halius, Noemon, Charopes, and Ennomus, Choon, Chersidamas, and five beside, Men of obscure descent, but courage tried; All these this hand laid breathless on the ground. Nor want I proofs of many a manly wound; All honest, all before; believe not me, Words may deceive, but credit what you see.” At this he bared his breast, and showed his scars, As of a furrowed field, well ploughed with wars; “Nor is this part unexercised,” said he; “That giant bulk of his from wounds is free; Safe in his shield he fears no foe to try, And better manages his blood than I. But this avails me not; our boaster strove Not with our foes alone, but partial Jove, To save the fleet. This I confess is true, Nor will I take from any man his due; But, thus assuming all, he robs from you. Some part of honour to your share will fall; He did the best indeed, but did not all. Patroclus in Achilles' arms, and thought The chief he seemed, with equal ardour fought; Preserved the fleet, repelled the raging fire, And forced the fearful Trojans to retire. “But Ajax boasts, that he was only thought A match for Hector, who the combat sought: Sure he forgets the king, the chiefs, and me, All were as eager for the fight as he; He but the ninth, and, not by public voice, Or ours preferred, was only fortune's choice: They fought; nor can our hero boast the event, For Hector from the field unwounded went. “Why am I forced to name that fatal day, That snatched the prop and pride of Greece away? I saw Pelides sink, with pious grief, And ran in vain, alas! to his relief, For the brave soul was fled; full of my friend, I rushed amid the war, his relics to defend; Nor ceased my toil till I redeemed the prey, And, loaded with Achilles, marched away. Those arms, which on these shoulders then I bore, 'Tis just you to these shoulders should restore. You see I want not nerves, who could sustain The ponderous ruins of so great a man; Or if in others equal force you find, None is endued with a more grateful mind. “Did Thetis then, ambitious in her care, These arms, thus laboured, for her son prepare, That Ajax after him the heavenly gift should wear? For that dull soul to stare, with stupid eyes, On the learned unintelligible prize? What are to him the sculptures of the shield, Heaven's planets, earth, and ocean's watery field? The Pleiads, Hyads; Less, and Greater Bear, Undipped in seas; Orion's angry star; Two differing cities, graved on either hand? Would he wear arms he cannot understand? “Beside, what wise objections he prepares Against my late accession to the wars! Does not the fool perceive his argument Is with more force against Achilles bent? For, if dissembling be so great a crime, The fault is common, and the same in him; And if he taxes both of long delay, My guilt is less, who sooner came away. His pious mother, anxious for his life, Detained her son; and me, my pious wife. To them the blossoms of our youth were due; Our riper manhood we reserved for you. But grant me guilty, 'tis not much my care, When with so great a man my guilt I share; My wit to war the matchless hero brought, But by this fool he never had been caught. “Nor need I wonder, that on me he threw Such foul aspersions, when he spares not you: If Palamede unjustly fell by me, Your honour suffered in the unjust decree. I but accused, you doomed; and yet he died, Convinced of treason, and was fairly tried. You heard not he was false; your eyes beheld The traitor manifest, the bribe revealed. “That Philoctetes is on Lemnos left, Wounded, forlorn, of human aid bereft, Is not my crime, or not my crime alone; Defend your justice, for the fact's your own. 'Tis true, the advice was mine; that, staying there, He might his weary limbs with rest repair, From a long voyage free, and from a longer war. He took the counsel, and he lives at least; The event declares I counselled for the best; Though faith is all in ministers of State, For who can promise to be fortunate? Now since his arrows are the fate of Troy, Do not my wit, or weak address, employ; Send Ajax there, with his persuasive sense, To mollify the man, and draw him thence: But Xanthus shall run backward; Ida stand A leafless mountain; and the Grecian band Shall fight for Troy; if, when my counsels fail, The wit of heavy Ajax can prevail. “Hard Philoctetes, exercise thy spleen Against thy fellows, and the king of men; Curse my devoted head, above the rest, And wish in arms to meet me, breast to breast; Yet I the dangerous task will undertake, And either die myself, or bring thee back. “Nor doubt the same success, as when, before, The Phrygian prophet to these tents I bore, Surprised by night, and forced him to declare In what was placed the fortune of the war; Heaven's dark decrees and answers to display, And how to take the town, and where the secret lay. Yet this I compassed, and from Troy conveyed The fatal image of their guardian Maid. That work was mine; for Pallas, though our friend, Yet while she was in Troy, did Troy defend. Now what has Ajax done, or what designed? A noisy nothing, and an empty wind. If he be what he promises in show, Why was I sent, and why feared he to go? Our boasting champion thought the task not light To pass the guards, commit himself to night; Not only through a hostile town to pass, But scale, with deep ascent, the sacred place; With wandering steps to search the citadel, And from the priests their patroness to steal; Then through surrounding foes to force my way, And bear in triumph home the heavenly prey; Which had I not, Ajax in vain had held Before that monstrous bulk his seven-fold shield, That night to conquer Troy I might be said, When Troy was liable to conquest made. “Why point'st thou to my partner of the war? Tydides had indeed a worthy share In all my toil, and praise; but when thy might Our ships protected, didst thou singly fight? All joined, and thou of many wert but one; I asked no friend, nor had, but him alone; Who, had he not been well assured, that art And conduct were of war the better part, And more availed than strength, my valiant friend Had urged a better right, than Ajax can pretend; As good, at least, Eurypylus may claim, And the more moderate Ajax of the name; The Cretan king, and his brave charioteer, And Menelaus, bold with sword and spear: All these had been my rivals in the shield, And yet all these to my pretensions yield. Thy boisterous hands are then of use, when I With this directing head those hands apply. Brawn without brain is thine; my prudent care Foresees, provides, administers the war: Thy province is to fight; but when shall be The time to fight, the king consults with me. No dram of judgment with thy force is joined; Thy body is of profit, and my mind. But, how much more the ship her safety owes To him who steers, than him that only rows; By how much more the captain merits praise Than he who fights, and, fighting, but obeys; By so much greater is my worth than thine, Who canst but execute what I design. What gain'st thou, brutal man, if I confess Thy strength superior, when thy wit is less? Mind is the man; I claim my whole desert From the mind's vigour, and the immortal part. “But you, O Grecian chiefs, reward my care, Be grateful to your watchman of the war; For all my labours in so long a space, Sure I may plead a title to your grace. Enter the town; I then unbarred the gates, When I removed their tutelary fates. By all our common hopes, if hopes they be, Which I have now reduced to certainty; By falling Troy, by yonder tottering towers, And by their taken gods, which now are ours; Or, if there yet a further task remains, To be performed by prudence or by pains; If yet some desperate action rests behind, That asks high conduct, and a dauntless mind; If aught be wanting to the Trojan doom, Which none but I can manage and o'ercome; Award those arms I ask, by your decree; Or give to this what you refuse to me.” He ceased, and, ceasing, with respect he bowed, And with his hand at once the fatal statue showed. Heaven, air, and ocean rung, with loud applause, And by the general vote he gained his cause. Thus conduct won the prize, when courage failed, And eloquence o'er brutal force prevailed. The Death of Ajax. He who could often, and alone, withstand The foe, the fire, and Jove's own partial hand, Now cannot his unmastered grief sustain, But yields to rage, to madness, and disdain; Then snatching out his falchion,—“Thou,” said he, “Art mine; Ulysses lays no claim to thee. O often tried, and ever trusty sword, Now do thy last kind office to thy lord! 'Tis Ajax who requests thy aid, to show None but himself, himself could overthrow.” He said, and with so good a will to die, Did to his breast the fatal point apply, It found his heart, a way till then unknown, Where never weapon entered but his own; No hands could force it thence, so fixed it stood, Till out it rushed, expelled by streams of spouting blood. The fruitful blood produced a flower, which grew On a green stem, and of a purple hue; Like his, whom unaware Apollo slew. Inscribed in both, the letters are the same, But those express the grief, and these the name. THE STORY OF ACIS, POLYPHEMUS, AND GALATEA. FROM THE THIRTEENTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. Acis, the lovely youth, whose loss I mourn, From Faunus and the nymph Symethis born, Was both his parents' pleasure; but to me Was all that love could make a lover be. The gods our minds in mutual bands did join; I was his only joy, and he was mine. Now sixteen summers the sweet youth had seen, And doubtful down began to shade his chin; When Polyphemus first disturbed our joy, And loved me fiercely, as I loved the boy. Ask not which passion in my soul was higher, My last aversion, or my first desire; Nor this the greater was, nor that the less, Both were alike, for both were in excess. Thee, Venus, thee both heaven and earth obey; Immense thy power, and boundless is thy sway. The Cyclops, who defied the ethereal throne, And thought no thunder louder than his own, The terror of the woods, and wilder far Than wolves in plains, or bears in forests are; The inhuman host, who made his bloody feasts On mangled members of his butchered guests, Yet felt the force of love, and fierce desire, And burnt for me, with unrelenting fire; Forgot his caverns, and his woolly care, Assumed the softness of a lover's air, And combed, with teeth of rakes, his rugged hair. Now with a crooked scythe his beard he sleeks, And mows the stubborn stubble of his cheeks; Now in the crystal stream he looks, to try His simagree, and rolls his glaring eye. His cruelty and thirst of blood are lost; And ships securely sail along the coast. The prophet Telemus (arrived by chance Where Ætna's summits to the seas advance, Who marked the tracks of every bird that flew, And sure presages from their flying drew,) Foretold the Cyclops, that Ulysses' hand In his broad eye should thrust a flaming brand. The giant, with a scornful grin, replied, “Vain augur, thou hast falsely prophesied: Already Love his flaming brand has tost; Looking on two fair eyes, my sight I lost.” Thus, warned in vain, with stalking pace he strode, And stamped the margin of the briny flood With heavy steps, and, weary, sought again The cool retirement of his gloomy den. A promontory, sharpening by degrees, Ends in a wedge, and overlooks the seas; On either side, below, the water flows: This airy walk the giant-lover chose; Here on the midst he sate; his flocks, unled, Their shepherd followed, and securely fed. A pine so burly, and of length so vast, That sailing ships required it for a mast, He wielded for a staff, his steps to guide; But laid it by, his whistle while he tried. A hundred reeds, of a prodigious growth, Scarce made a pipe proportioned to his mouth; Which when he gave it wind, the rocks around, And watery plains, the dreadful hiss resound. I heard the ruffian shepherd rudely blow, Where, in a hollow cave, I sat below. On Acis' bosom I my head reclined; And still preserve the poem in my mind. “O lovely Galatea, whiter far Than falling snows, and rising lilies are; More flowery than the meads, as crystal bright, Erect as alders, and of equal height; More wanton than a kid; more sleek thy skin, Than orient shells, that on the shores are seen; Than apples fairer, when the boughs they lade; Pleasing, as winter suns, or summer shade; More grateful to the sight than goodly plains, And softer to the touch than down of swans, Or curds new turned; and sweeter to the taste, Than swelling grapes, that to the vintage haste; More clear than ice, or running streams, that stray Through garden plots, but ah! more swift than they. “Yet, Galatea, harder to be broke Than bullocks, unreclaimed to bear the yoke, And far more stubborn than the knotted oak; Like sliding streams, impossible to hold, Like them fallacious, like their fountains cold; More warping than the willow, to decline My warm embrace; more brittle than the vine; Immovable, and fixed in thy disdain; Rough, as these rocks, and of a harder grain; More violent than is the rising flood; And the praised peacock is not half so proud; Fierce as the fire, and sharp as thistles are, And more outrageous than a mother bear; Deaf as the billows to the vows I make, And more revengeful than a trodden snake; In swiftness fleeter than the flying hind, Or driven tempests, or the driving wind. All other faults with patience I can bear; But swiftness is the vice I only fear. “Yet, if you knew me well, you would not shun My love, but to my wished embraces run; Would languish in your turn, and court my stay, And much repent of your unwise delay. “My palace, in the living rock, is made By nature's hand; a spacious pleasing shade, Which neither heat can pierce, nor cold invade. My garden filled with fruits you may behold, And grapes in clusters, imitating gold; Some blushing bunches of a purple hue; And these, and those, are all reserved for you. Red strawberries in shades expecting stand, Proud to be gathered by so white a hand. Autumnal cornels latter fruit provide, And plums, to tempt you, turn their glossy side; Not those of common kinds, but such alone, As in Phæacian orchards might have grown. Nor chestnuts shall be wanting to your food, Nor garden-fruits, nor wildings of the wood. The laden boughs for you alone shall bear, And yours shall be the product of the year. “The flocks you see are all my own, beside The rest that woods and winding valleys hide, And those that folded in the caves abide. Ask not the numbers of my growing store; Who knows how many, knows he has no more. Nor will I praise my cattle; trust not me, But judge yourself, and pass your own decree. Behold their swelling dugs; the sweepy weight Of ewes, that sink beneath the milky freight; In the warm folds their tender lambkins lie; Apart from kids, that call with human cry. New milk in nut-brown bowls is duly served For daily drink, the rest for cheese reserved. Nor are these household dainties all my store; The fields and forests will afford us more; The deer, the hare, the goat, the savage boar. All sorts of venison, and of birds the best; A pair of turtles taken from the nest. I walked the mountains, and two cubs I found, Whose dam had left them on the naked ground; So like, that no distinction could be seen; So pretty, they were presents for a queen: And so they shall; I took them both away, And keep, to be companions of your play. “Oh raise, fair nymph, your beauteous face above The waves; nor scorn my presents, and my love. Come, Galatea, come, and view my face; I late beheld it in the watery glass, And found it lovelier than I feared it was. Survey my towering stature, and my size: Not Jove, the Jove you dream, that rules the skies, Bears such a bulk, or is so largely spread. My locks (the plenteous harvest of my head,) Hang o'er my manly face, and dangling down, As with a shady grove, my shoulders crown. Nor think, because my limbs and body bear A thick-set underwood of bristling hair, My shape deformed; what fouler sight can be, Than the bald branches of a leafless tree? Foul is the steed without a flowing main; And birds, without their feathers, and their train: Wool decks the sheep; and man receives a grace From bushy limbs, and from a bearded face. My forehead with a single eye is filled, Round as a ball, and ample as a shield. The glorious lamp of heaven, the radiant sun, Is Nature's eye; and she's content with one. Add, that my father sways your seas, and I, Like you, am of the watery family. I make you his, in making you my own; You I adore, and kneel to you alone; Jove, with his fabled thunder, I despise, And only fear the lightning of your eyes. Frown not, fair nymph! yet I could bear to be Disdained, if others were disdained with me. But to repulse the Cyclops, and prefer The love of Acis,—heavens! I cannot bear. But let the stripling please himself; nay more, Please you, though that's the thing I most abhor; The boy shall find, if e'er we cope in fight, These giant limbs endued with giant might. His living bowels from his belly torn, And scattered limbs, shall on the flood be borne, Thy flood, ungrateful nymph; and fate shall find That way for thee and Acis to be joined. For oh! I burn with love, and thy disdain Augments at once my passion, and my pain. Translated Ætna flames within my heart, And thou, inhuman, wilt not ease my smart.” Lamenting thus in vain, he rose, and strode With furious paces to the neighbouring wood; Restless his feet, distracted was his walk, Mad were his motions, and confused his talk; Mad as the vanquished bull, when forced to yield His lovely mistress, and forsake the field. Thus far unseen I saw; when, fatal chance His looks directing, with a sudden glance, Acis and I were to his sight betrayed; Where, nought suspecting, we securely played. From his wide mouth a bellowing cry he cast,— “I see, I see, but this shall be your last.” A roar so loud made Ætna to rebound, And all the Cyclops laboured in the sound. Affrighted with his monstrous voice, I fled, And in the neighbouring ocean plunged my head. Poor Acis turned his back, and, “Help,” he cried, “Help, Galatea! help, my parent Gods, And take me, dying, to your deep abodes!” The Cyclops followed; but he sent before A rib, which from the living rock he tore; Though but an angle reached him of the stone, The mighty fragment was enough alone, To crush all Acis; 'twas too late to save, But what the fates allowed to give, I gave; That Acis to his lineage should return, And roll among the river Gods his urn. Straight issued from the stone a stream of blood, Which lost the purple, mingling with the flood; Then like a troubled torrent it appeared; The torrent too, in little space, was cleared; The stone was cleft, and through the yawning chink New reeds arose, on the new river's brink. The rock, from out its hollow womb, disclosed A sound like water in its course opposed: When (wondrous to behold!) full in the flood, Up starts a youth, and navel-high he stood. Horns from his temples rise; and either horn Thick wreaths of reeds (his native growth) adorn. Were not his stature taller than before, His bulk augmented, and his beauty more, His colour blue, for Acis he might pass; And Acis, changed into a stream, he was. But, mine no more, he rolls along the plains With rapid motion, and his name retains. OF THE PYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHY. FROM THE FIFTEENTH BOOK OF OVID'S METAMORPHOSES. The fourteenth book concludes with the death and deification of Romulus; the fifteenth begins with the election of Numa to the crown of Rome. On this occasion, Ovid, following the opinion of some authors, makes Numa the scholar of Pythagoras, and to have begun his acquaintance with that philosopher at Crotona, a town in Italy; from thence he makes a digression to the moral and natural philosophy of Pythagoras; on both which our author enlarges; and which are the most learned and beautiful parts of the Metamorphoses. A king is sought to guide the growing State, One able to support the public weight, And fill the throne where Romulus hath sate. Renown, which oft bespeaks the public voice, Had recommended Numa to their choice; A peaceful, pious prince; who, not content To know the Sabine rites, his study bent To cultivate his mind; to learn the laws Of nature, and explore their hidden cause. Urged by this care, his country he forsook, And to Crotona thence his journey took. Arrived, he first inquired the founder's name Of this new colony; and whence he came. Then thus a senior of the place replies, Well read, and curious of antiquities:— “'Tis said, Alcides hither took his way From Spain, and drove along his conquered prey; Then, leaving in the fields his grazing cows, He sought himself some hospitable house. Good Croton entertained his godlike guest; While he repaired his weary limbs with rest. The hero, thence departing, blessed the place; ‘And here,’ he said, ‘in time's revolving race, A rising town shall take its name from thee.’ Revolving time fulfilled the prophecy; For Myscelos, the justest man on earth, Alemon's son, at Argos had his birth; Him Hercules, armed with his club of oak, O'ershadowed in a dream, and thus bespoke; ‘Go, leave thy native soil, and make abode Where Æsaris rolls down his rapid flood;’ He said; and sleep forsook him, and the God. Trembling he waked, and rose with anxious heart; His country laws forbade him to depart; What should he do? 'Twas death to go away, And the God menaced if he dared to stay. All day he doubted, and, when night came on, Sleep, and the same forewarning dream, begun; Once more the God stood threatening o'er his head, With added curses if he disobeyed. Twice warned, he studied flight; but would convey, At once, his person and his wealth away. Thus while he lingered, his design was heard; A speedy process formed, and death declared. Witness there needed none of his offence, Against himself the wretch was evidence; Condemned, and destitute of human aid, To him, for whom he suffered, thus he prayed. “‘O Power, who hast deserved in heaven a throne, Not given, but by thy labours made thy own, Pity thy suppliant, and protect his cause, Whom thou hast made obnoxious to the laws!’ “A custom was of old, and still remains, Which life or death by suffrages ordains; White stones and black within an urn are cast, The first absolve, but fate is in the last. The judges to the common urn bequeath Their votes, and drop the sable signs of death: The box receives all black; but, poured from thence, The stones came candid forth, the hue of innocence. Thus Alimonides his safety won, Preserved from death by Alcumena's son. Then to his kinsman God his vows he pays, And cuts with prosperous gales the Ionian seas; He leaves Tarentum, favoured by the wind, And Thurine bays, and Temises, behind; Soft Sybaris, and all the capes that stand Along the shore, he makes in sight of land; Still doubling, and still coasting, till he found The mouth of Æsaris, and promised ground; Then saw where, on the margin of the flood, The tomb that held the bones of Croton stood; Here, by the God's command, he built and walled The place predicted, and Crotona called. Thus fame, from time to time, delivers down The sure tradition of the Italian town. “Here dwelt the man divine whom Samos bore, But now self-banished from his native shore, Because he hated tyrants, nor could bear The chains which none but servile souls will wear. He, though from heaven remote, to heaven could move, With strength of mind, and tread the abyss above; And penetrate, with his interior light, Those upper depths, which Nature hid from sight; And what he had observed, and learnt from thence, Loved in familiar language to dispense. “The crowd with silent admiration stand, And heard him, as they heard their god's command; While he discoursed of heaven's mysterious laws, The world's original, and nature's cause; And what was God, and why the fleecy snows In silence fell, and rattling winds arose; What shook the steadfast earth, and whence begun The dance of planets round the radiant sun; If thunder was the voice of angry Jove, Or clouds, with nitre pregnant, burst above; Of these, and things beyond the common reach, He spoke, and charmed his audience with his speech. “He first the taste of flesh from tables drove, And argued well, if arguments could move:— ‘O mortals! from your fellows' blood abstain, Nor taint your bodies with a food profane; While corn and pulse by nature are bestowed, And planted orchards bend their willing load; While laboured gardens wholesome herbs produce, And teeming vines afford their generous juice; Nor tardier fruits of cruder kind are lost, But tamed with fire, or mellowed by the frost; While kine to pails distended udders bring, And bees their honey, redolent of spring; While earth not only can your needs supply, But, lavish of her store, provides for luxury; A guiltless feast administers with ease, And without blood is prodigal to please. Wild beasts their maws with their slain brethren fill, And yet not all, for some refuse to kill; Sheep, goats, and oxen, and the nobler steed, On browse, and corn, the flowery meadows feed. Bears, tigers, wolves, the lion's angry brood, Whom heaven endued with principles of blood, He wisely sundered from the rest, to yell In forests, and in lonely caves to dwell, Where stronger beasts oppress the weak by might, And all in prey and purple feasts delight. “‘O impious use! to Nature's laws opposed, Where bowels are in other bowels closed; Where, fattened by their fellows' fat, they thrive; Maintained by murder, and by death they live. 'Tis then for nought that mother earth provides The stores of all she shows, and all she hides, If men with fleshy morsels must be fed, And chew with bloody teeth the breathing bread. What else is this but to devour our guests, And barbarously renew Cyclopean feasts! We, by destroying life, our life sustain, And gorge the ungodly maw with meats obscene. “‘Not so the golden age, who fed on fruit, Nor durst with bloody meals their mouths pollute. Then birds in airy space might safely move, And timorous hares on heaths securely rove; Nor needed fish the guileful hooks to fear, For all was peaceful, and that peace sincere. Whoever was the wretch (and cursed be he!) That envied first our food's simplicity, The essay of bloody feasts on brutes began, And, after, forged the sword to murder man. Had he the sharpened steel alone employed On beasts of prey, that other beasts destroyed, Or men invaded with their fangs and paws, This had been justified by Nature's laws, And self-defence; but who did feasts begin Of flesh, he stretched necessity to sin. To kill man-killers man has lawful power, But not the extended licence, to devour. “‘Ill habits gather by unseen degrees, As brooks make rivers, rivers run to seas. The sow, with her broad snout for rooting up The intrusted seed, was judged to spoil the crop, And intercept the sweating farmer's hope; The covetous churl, of unforgiving kind, The offender to the bloody priest resigned: Her hunger was no plea; for that she died. The goat came next in order, to be tried: The goat had cropt the tendrils of the vine; In vengeance laity and clergy join, Where one had lost his profit, one his wine. Here was, at least, some shadow of offence; The sheep was sacrificed on no pretence, But meek and unresisting innocence. A patient, useful creature, born to bear The warm and woolly fleece, that clothed her murderer, And daily to give down the milk she bred, A tribute for the grass on which she fed. Living, both food and raiment she supplies, And is of least advantage when she dies. “‘How did the toiling ox his death deserve, A downright simple drudge, and born to serve? O tyrant! with what justice canst thou hope The promise of the year, a plenteous crop, When thou destroyest thy labouring steer, who tilled, And ploughed, with pains, thy else ungrateful field? From his yet reeking neck to draw the yoke, (That neck with which the surly clods he broke,) And to the hatchet yield thy husbandman, Who finished autumn, and the spring began! Nor this alone; but, heaven itself to bribe, We to the gods our impious acts ascribe; First recompense with death their creatures' toil, Then call the blessed above to share the spoil: The fairest victim must the powers appease; So fatal 'tis sometimes, too much to please! A purple fillet his broad brows adorns, With flowery garlands crowned, and gilded horns; He hears the murderous prayer the priest prefers, But understands not, 'tis his doom he hears; Beholds the meal betwixt his temples cast, The fruit and product of his labours past; And in the water views, perhaps, the knife Uplifted, to deprive him of his life; Then, broken up alive, his entrails sees Torn out, for priests to inspect the gods' decrees. “‘From whence, O mortal men, this gust of blood Have you derived, and interdicted food? Be taught by me this dire delight to shun, Warned by my precepts, by my practice won; And when you eat the well-deserving beast, Think, on the labourer of your field you feast! “‘Now since the God inspires me to proceed, Be that whate'er inspiring Power obeyed. For I will sing of mighty mysteries, Of truths concealed before from human eyes, Dark oracles unveil, and open all the skies. Pleased as I am to walk along the sphere Of shining stars, and travel with the year, To leave the heavy earth, and scale the height Of Atlas, who supports the heavenly weight; To look from upper light, and thence survey Mistaken mortals wandering from the way, And, wanting wisdom, fearful for the state Of future things, and trembling at their fate! “‘Those I would teach; and by right reason bring To think of death, as but an idle thing. Why thus affrighted at an empty name, A dream of darkness, and fictitious flame? Vain themes of wit, which but in poems pass, And fables of a world, that never was! What feels the body when the soul expires, By time corrupted, or consumed by fires? Nor dies the spirit, but new life repeats In other forms, and only changes seats. “‘Even I, who these mysterious truths declare, Was once Euphorbus in the Trojan war; My name and lineage I remember well, And how in fight by Sparta's king I fell. In Argive Juno's fane I late beheld My buckler hung on high, and owned my former shield. Then death, so called, is but old matter dressed In some new figure, and a varied vest; Thus all things are but altered, nothing dies, And here and there the unbodied spirit flies, By time, or force, or sickness dispossest, And lodges, where it lights, in man or beast; Or hunts without, till ready limbs it find, And actuates those according to their kind; From tenement to tenement is tossed; The soul is still the same, the figure only lost: And as the softened wax new seals receives, This face assumes, and that impression leaves; Now called by one, now by another name, The form is only changed, the wax is still the same: So death, so called, can but the form deface; The immortal soul flies out in empty space, To seek her fortune in some other place. “‘Then let not piety be put to flight, To please the taste of glutton appetite; But suffer inmate souls secure to dwell, Lest from their seats your parents you expel; With rabid hunger feed upon your kind, Or from a beast dislodge a brother's mind. “‘And since, like Tiphys, parting from the shore, In ample seas I sail, and depths untried before, This let me further add, that nature knows No steadfast station, but or ebbs, or flows; Ever in motion, she destroys her old, And casts new figures in another mould. Even times are in perpetual flux, and run, Like rivers from their fountain, rolling on. For time, no more than streams, is at a stay; The flying hour is ever on her way; And as the fountain still supplies her store, The wave behind impels the wave before, Thus in successive course the minutes run, And urge their predecessor minutes on, Still moving, ever new; for former things Are set aside, like abdicated kings; And every moment alters what is done, And innovates some act till then unknown. “‘Darkness, we see, emerges into light, And shining suns descend to sable night; Even heaven itself receives another dye, When wearied animals in slumbers lie Of midnight ease; another, when the grey Of morn preludes the splendour of the day. The disk of Phœbus, when he climbs on high, Appears at first but as a bloodshot eye; And when his chariot downward drives to bed, His ball is with the same suffusion red; But, mounted high in his meridian race, All bright he shines, and with a better face; For there, pure particles of ether flow, Far from the infection of the world below. “‘Nor equal light the unequal moon adorns, Or in her wexing, or her waning horns; For, every day she wanes, her face is less, But, gathering into globe, she fattens at increase. “‘Perceiv'st thou not the process of the year, How the four seasons in four forms appear, Resembling human life in every shape they wear? Spring first, like infancy, shoots out her head, With milky juice requiring to be fed; Helpless, though fresh, and wanting to be led. The green stem grows in stature and in size, But only feeds with hope the farmer's eyes; Then laughs the childish year, with flowerets crowned, And lavishly perfumes the fields around; But no substantial nourishment receives, Infirm the stalks, unsolid are the leaves. “‘Proceeding onward whence the year began, The Summer grows adult, and ripens into man. This season, as in men, is most replete With kindly moisture, and prolific heat. “‘Autumn succeeds, a sober tepid age, Not froze with fear, nor boiling into rage; More than mature, and tending to decay, When our brown locks repine to mix with odious grey. “‘Last, Winter creeps along with tardy pace; Sour is his front, and furrowed is his face. His scalp if not dishonoured quite of hair, The ragged fleece is thin, and thin is worse than bare. “‘Even our own bodies daily change receive; Some part of what was theirs before they leave, Nor are to-day what yesterday they were; Nor the whole same to-morrow will appear. “‘Time was, when we were sowed, and just began, From some few fruitful drops, the promise of a man; Then Nature's hand (fermented as it was) Moulded to shape the soft, coagulated mass; And when the little man was fully formed, The breathless embryo with a spirit warmed; But when the mother's throes begin to come, The creature, pent within the narrow room, Breaks his blind prison, pushing to repair His stifled breath, and draw the living air; Cast on the margin of the world he lies, A helpless babe, but by instinct he cries. He next essays to walk, but, downward pressed, On four feet imitates his brother beast: By slow degrees he gathers from the ground His legs, and to the rolling chair is bound; Then walks alone: a horseman now become, He rides a stick, and travels round the room: In time he vaunts among his youthful peers, Strong-boned, and strung with nerves, in pride of years: He runs with mettle his first merry stage, Maintains the next, abated of his rage, But manages his strength, and spares his age. Heavy the third, and stiff, he sinks apace, And, though 'tis down-hill all, but creeps along the race. Now sapless on the verge of death he stands, Contemplating his former feet, and hands; And, Milo-like, his slackened sinews sees, And withered arms, once fit to cope with Hercules, Unable now to shake, much less to tear, the trees. “‘So Helen wept, when her too faithful glass Reflected to her eyes the ruins of her face; Wondering what charms her ravishers could spy, To force her twice, or even but once enjoy! “‘Thy teeth, devouring Time, thine, envious Age, On things below still exercise your rage; With venomed grinders you corrupt your meat, And then, at lingering meals, the morsels eat. “‘Nor those, which elements we call, abide, Nor to this figure, nor to that, are tied; For this eternal world is said of old But four prolific principles to hold, Four different bodies; two to heaven ascend, And other two down to the centre tend. Fire, first, with wings expanded mounts on high, Pure, void of weight, and dwells in upper sky; Then Air, because unclogged in empty space, Flies after fire, and claims the second place; But weighty Water, as her nature guides, Lies on the lap of Earth; and mother Earth subsides. “‘All things are mixt with these, which all contain, And into these are all resolved again. Earth rarifies to dew; expanded more, The subtle dew in air begins to soar, Spreads as she flies, and, weary of her name, Extenuates still, and changes into flame; Thus having by degrees perfection won, Restless, they soon untwist the web they spun; And fire begins to lose her radiant hue, Mixed with gross air, and air descends to dew; And dew, condensing, does her form forego, And sinks, a heavy lump of earth, below. “‘Thus are their figures never at a stand, But changed by Nature's innovating hand; All things are altered, nothing is destroyed, The shifted scene for some new show employed. “‘Then, to be born, is to begin to be Some other thing we were not formerly; And what we call to die, is not to appear, Or be the thing that formerly we were. Those very elements, which we partake Alive, when dead, some other bodies make; Translated grow, have sense, or can discourse; But death on deathless substance has no force. “‘That forms are changed I grant, that nothing can Continue in the figure it began: The golden age to silver was debased; To copper that; our metal came at last. “‘The face of places, and their forms, decay, And that is solid earth, that once was sea; Seas, in their turn, retreating from the shore, Make solid land what ocean was before; And far from strands are shells of fishes found, And rusty anchors fixed on mountain ground; And what were fields before, now washed and worn By falling floods from high, to valleys turn, And, crumbling still, descend to level lands; And lakes, and trembling bogs, are barren sands; And the parched desert floats in streams unknown, Wondering to drink of waters not her own. “‘Here nature living fountains opes; and there Seals up the wombs where living fountains were; Or earthquakes stop their ancient course, and bring Diverted streams to feed a distant spring. So Lycus, swallowed up, is seen no more, But, far from thence, knocks out another door. Thus Erasinus dives; and blind in earth Runs on, and gropes his way to second birth, Starts up in Argos meads, and shakes his locks Around the fields, and fattens all the flocks. So Mysus by another way is led, And, grown a river, now disdains their head; Forgets his humble birth, his name forsakes, And the proud title of Caicus takes. Large Amenane, impure with yellow sands, Runs rapid often, and as often stands; And here he threats the drunken fields to drown, And there his dugs deny to give their liquor down. “‘Anigros once did wholesome draughts afford, But now his deadly waters are abhorred; Since, hurt by Hercules, as fame resounds, The Centaur in his current washed his wounds. The streams of Hypanis are sweet no more, But, brackish, lose the taste they had before. Antissa, Pharos, Tyre, in seas were pent, Once isles, but now increase the continent; While the Leucadian coast, mainland before, By rushing seas is severed from the shore. So Zancle to the Italian earth was tied, And men once walked where ships at anchor ride; Till Neptune overlooked the narrow way, And in disdain poured in the conquering sea. “‘Two cities that adorned the Achaian ground, Buris and Helice, no more are found, But, whelmed beneath a lake, are sunk and drowned; And boatmen through the crystal water show, To wondering passengers, the walls below. “‘Near Trœzen stands a hill, exposed in air To winter winds, of leafy shadows bare: This once was level ground; but (strange to tell) The included vapours, that in caverns dwell, Labouring with colic pangs, and close confined, In vain sought issue for the rumbling wind; Yet still they heaved for vent, and heaving still, Enlarged the concave, and shot up the hill; As breath extends a bladder, or the skins Of goats are blown to inclose the hoarded wines. The mountain yet retains a mountain's face, And gathered rubbish heals the hollow space. “‘Of many wonders, which I heard or knew, Retrenching most, I will relate but few. What, are not springs with qualities opposed Endued at seasons, and at seasons lost? Thrice in a day, thine, Ammon, change their form, Cold at high noon, at morn and evening warm; Thine, Athaman, will kindle wood, if thrown On the piled earth, and in the waning moon. The Thracians have a stream, if any try The taste, his hardened bowels petrify; Whate'er it touches it converts to stones, And makes a marble pavement where it runs. “‘Crathis, and Sybaris her sister flood, That slide through our Calabrian neighbour wood, With gold and amber dye the shining hair, And thither youth resort; for who would not be fair? “‘But stranger virtues yet in streams we find; Some change not only bodies, but the mind. Who has not heard of Salmacis obscene, Whose waters into women soften men? Of Æthiopian lakes, which turn the brain To madness, or in heavy sleep constrain? Clytorean streams the love of wine expel, (Such is the virtue of the abstemious well,) Whether the colder nymph, that rules the flood, Extinguishes, and balks the drunken God; Or that Melampus (so have some assured) When the mad Prœtides with charms he cured, And powerful herbs, both charms and simples cast Into the sober spring, where still their virtues last. “‘Unlike effects Lyncestis will produce; Who drinks his waters, though with moderate use, Reels as with wine, and sees with double sight, His heels too heavy, and his head too light. Ladon, once Pheneos, an Arcadian stream, (Ambiguous in the effects, as in the name,) By day is wholesome beverage; but is thought By night infected, and a deadly draught. “‘Thus running rivers, and the standing lake, Now of these virtues, now of those partake. Time was (and all things time and fate obey) When fast Ortygia floated on the sea; Such were Cyanean isles, when Typhis steered Betwixt their straits, and their collision feared; They swam where now they sit; and, firmly joined, Secure of rooting up, resist the wind. Nor Ætna, vomiting sulphureous fire, Will ever belch; for sulphur will expire, The veins exhausted of the liquid store; Time was she cast no flames; in time will cast no more. “‘For, whether earth's an animal, and air Imbibes, her lungs with coolness to repair, And what she sucks remits, she still requires Inlets for air, and outlets for her fires; When tortured with convulsive fits she shakes, That motion chokes the vent, till other vent she makes; Or when the winds in hollow caves are closed, And subtile spirits find that way opposed, They toss up flints in air; the flints that hide The seeds of fire, thus tossed in air, collide, Kindling the sulphur, till, the fuel spent, The cave is cooled, and the fierce winds relent. Or whether sulphur, catching fire, feeds on Its unctuous parts, till, all the matter gone, The flames no more ascend; for earth supplies The fat that feeds them; and when earth denies That food, by length of time consumed, the fire, Famished for want of fuel, must expire. “‘A race of men there are, as fame has told, Who, shivering, suffer Hyperborean cold, Till, nine times bathing in Minerva's lake, Soft feathers to defend their naked sides they take. 'Tis said, the Scythian wives (believe who will) Transform themselves to birds by magic skill; Smeared over with an oil of wondrous might, That adds new pinions to their airy flight. “‘But this by sure experiment we know, That living creatures from corruption grow: Hide in a hollow pit a slaughtered steer, Bees from his putrid bowels will appear; Who, like their parents, haunt the fields, and bring Their honey-harvest home, and hope another spring. The warlike steed is multiplied, we find, To wasps and hornets of the warrior kind. Cut from a crab his crooked claws, and hide The rest in earth, a scorpion thence will glide, And shoot his sting; his tail, in circles tossed, Refers the limbs his backward father lost; And worms, that stretch on leaves their filmy loom, Crawl from their bags, and butterflies become. Even slime begets the frogs' loquacious race; Short of their feet at first, in little space With arms and legs endued, long leaps they take, Raised on their hinder part, and swim the lake, And waves repel: for nature gives their kind, To that intent, a length of legs behind. “‘The cubs of bears a living lump appear, When whelped, and no determined figure wear. Their mother licks them into shape, and gives As much of form, as she herself receives. “‘The grubs from their sexangular abode Crawl out unfinished, like the maggots' brood, Trunks without limbs; till time at leisure brings The thighs they wanted, and their tardy wings. “‘The bird who draws the car of Juno, vain Of her crowned head, and of her starry train; And he that bears the artillery of Jove, The strong-pounced eagle, and the billing dove, And all the feathered kind;—who could suppose (But that from sight, the surest sense, he knows) They from the included yolk, not ambient white, arose? “‘There are who think the marrow of a man, Which in the spine, while he was living, ran; When dead, the pith corrupted, will become A snake, and hiss within the hollow tomb. “‘All these receive their birth from other things, But from himself the phœnix only springs: Self-born, begotten by the parent flame In which he burned, another and the same: Who not by corn or herbs his life sustains, But the sweet essence of Amomum drains; And watches the rich gums Arabia bears, While yet in tender dew they drop their tears. He (his five centuries of life fulfilled) His nest on oaken boughs begins to build, Or trembling tops of palm: and first he draws The plan with his broad bill, and crooked claws, Nature's artificers; on this the pile Is formed, and rises round; then with the spoil Of cassia, cinnamon, and stems of nard, (For softness strewed beneath,) his funeral bed is reared, Funeral and bridal both; and all around The borders with corruptless myrrh are crowned: On this incumbent, till ethereal flame First catches, then consumes, the costly frame; Consumes him too, as on the pile he lies; He lived on odours, and in odours dies. “‘An infant phœnix from the former springs, His father's heir, and from his tender wings Shakes off his parent dust; his method he pursues, And the same lease of life on the same terms renews. When, grown to manhood, he begins his reign, And with stiff pinions can his flight sustain, He lightens of its load the tree that bore His father's royal sepulchre before, And his own cradle; this with pious care Placed on his back, he cuts the buxom air, Seeks the sun's city, and his sacred church, And decently lays down his burden in the porch. “‘A wonder more amazing would we find? The Hyæna shows it, of a double kind, Varying the sexes in alternate years, In one begets, and in another bears. The thin cameleon, fed with air, receives The colour of the thing to which he cleaves. “‘India, when conquered, on the conquering God For planted vines the sharp-eyed lynx bestowed, Whose urine, shed before it touches earth, Congeals in air, and gives to gems their birth. So coral, soft and white in ocean's bed, Comes hardened up in air, and glows with red. “‘All changing species should my song recite, Before I ceased, would change the day to night. Nations and empires flourish and decay, By turns command, and in their turns obey; Time softens hardy people, time again Hardens to war a soft, unwarlike train. Thus Troy for ten long years her foes withstood, And daily bleeding bore the expense of blood; Now for thick streets it shows an empty space, Or only filled with tombs of her own perished race; Herself becomes the sepulchre of what she was. “‘Mycene, Sparta, Thebes of mighty fame, Are vanished out of substance into name, And Dardan Rome, that just begins to rise On Tiber's banks, in time shall mate the skies; Widening her bounds, and working on her way, Even now she meditates imperial sway: Yet this is change, but she by changing thrives, Like moons new born, and in her cradle strives To fill her infant horns; an hour shall come, When the round world shall be contained in Rome. “‘For thus old saws foretell, and Helenus Anchises' drooping son enlivened thus, When Ilium now was in a sinking state, And he was doubtful of his future fate:— “O goddess born, with thy hard fortune strive, Troy never can be lost, and thou alive; Thy passage thou shalt free through fire and sword, And Troy in foreign lands shall be restored. In happier fields a rising town I see, Greater than what e'er was, or is, or e'er shall be; And heaven yet owes the world a race derived from thee. Sages and chiefs, of other lineage born, The city shall extend, extended shall adorn; But from Iulus he must draw his birth, By whom thy Rome shall rule the conquered earth; Whom heaven will lend mankind on earth to reign, And late require the precious pledge again.” This Helenus to great Æneas told, Which I retain, e'er since in other mould My soul was clothed; and now rejoice to view My country walls rebuilt, and Troy revived anew; Raised by the fall; decreed by loss to gain; Enslaved but to be free, and conquered but to reign. “‘'Tis time my hard-mouthed coursers to control, Apt to run riot, and transgress the goal, And therefore I conclude: whatever lies In earth, or flits in air, or fills the skies, All suffer change; and we, that are of soul And body mixed, are members of the whole. Then when our sires, or grandsires, shall forsake The forms of men, and brutal figures take, Thus housed, securely let their spirits rest, Nor violate thy father in the beast, Thy friend, thy brother, any of thy kin; If none of these, yet there's a man within. Oh spare to make a Thyestean meal, To inclose his body, and his soul expel. “‘Ill customs by degrees to habits rise, Ill habits soon become exalted vice: What more advance can mortals make in sin, So near perfection, who with blood begin? Deaf to the calf that lies beneath the knife, Looks up, and from her butcher begs her life; Deaf to the harmless kid, that, ere he dies, All methods to procure thy mercy tries, And imitates in vain thy children's cries. Where will he stop, who feeds with household bread, Then eats the poultry, which before he fed? Let plough thy steers; that, when they lose their breath, To nature, not to thee, they may impute their death. Let goats for food their loaded udders lend, And sheep from winter-cold thy sides defend; But neither springes, nets, nor snares employ, And be no more ingenious to destroy. Free as in air, let birds on earth remain, Nor let insidious glue their wings constrain; Nor opening hounds the trembling stag affright, Nor purple feathers intercept his flight; Nor hooks concealed in baits for fish prepare, Nor lines to heave them twinkling up in air. “‘Take not away the life you cannot give; For all things have an equal right to live. Kill noxious creatures, where 'tis sin to save; This only just prerogative we have: But nourish life with vegetable food, And shun the sacrilegious taste of blood.’ “These precepts by the Samian sage were taught, Which godlike Numa to the Sabines brought, And thence transferred to Rome, by gift his own; A willing people, and an offered throne. O happy monarch, sent by heaven to bless A savage nation with soft arts of peace; To teach religion, rapine to restrain, Give laws to lust, and sacrifice ordain: Himself a saint, a goddess was his bride, And all the muses o'er his acts preside.” TRANSLATIONS FROM OVID'S ART OF LOVE [AND AMORES.] THE FIRST BOOK OF OVID'S ART OF LOVE. In Cupid's school whoe'er would take degree, Must learn his rudiments, by reading me. Seaman with sailing arts their vessels move; Art guides the chariot, art instructs to love. Of ships and chariots others know the rule; But I am master in Love's mighty school. Cupid indeed is obstinate and wild, A stubborn god, but yet the god's a child: Easy to govern in his tender age, Like fierce Achilles in his pupillage: That hero, born for conquest, trembling stood Before the Centaur, and received the rod. As Chiron mollified his cruel mind With art, and taught his warlike hands to wind The silver strings of his melodious lyre, So Love's fair goddess does my soul inspire, To teach her softer arts, to soothe the mind, And smooth the rugged breasts of humankind. Yet Cupid and Achilles, each with scorn And rage were filled, and both were goddess-born. The bull, reclaimed and yoked, the burden draws; The horse receives the bit within his jaws; And stubborn Love shall bend beneath my sway, Though struggling oft he strives to disobey. He shakes his torch, he wounds me with his darts; But vain his force, and vainer are his arts. The more he burns my soul, or wounds my sight, The more he teaches to revenge the spite. I boast no aid the Delphian god affords, Nor auspice from the flight of chattering birds; Nor Clio, nor her sisters, have I seen, As Hesiod saw them on the shady green: Experience makes my work; a truth so tried You may believe, and Venus be my guide. Far hence, ye vestals, be, who bind your hair; And wives, who gowns below your ankles wear. I sing the brothels loose and unconfined, The unpunishable pleasures of the kind; Which all alike, for love, or money, find. You, who in Cupid's rolls inscribe your name, First seek an object worthy of your flame; Then strive, with art, your lady's mind to gain; And, last, provide your love may long remain. On these three precepts all my works shall move; These are the rules and principles of love. Before your youth with marriage is opprest, Make choice of one who suits your humour best; And such a damsel drops not from the sky, She must be sought for with a curious eye. The wary angler, in the winding brook, Knows what the fish, and where to bait his hook. The fowler and the huntsman know by name The certain haunts and harbour of their game. So must the lover beat the likeliest grounds; The assembly where his quarry most abounds. Nor shall my novice wander far astray; These rules shall put him in the ready way. Thou shalt not sail around the continent, As far as Perseus, or as Paris went; For Rome alone affords thee such a store, As all the world can hardly show thee more: The face of heaven with fewer stars is crowned, Than beauties in the Roman sphere are found. Whether thy love is bent on blooming youth, On dawning sweetness in unartful truth, Or courts the juicy joys of riper growth; Here may'st thou find thy full desires in both. Or if autumnal beauties please thy sight, (An age that knows to give, and take delight,) Millions of matrons of the graver sort, In common prudence, will not balk the sport. In summer heats thou need'st but only go To Pompey's cool and shady portico; Or Concord's fane; or that proud edifice, Whose turrets near the bawdy suburb rise; Or to that other portico, where stands The cruel father urging his commands, And fifty daughters wait the time of rest, To plunge their poniards in the bridegroom's breast; Or Venus' temple, where, on annual nights, They mourn Adonis with Assyrian rites. Nor shun the Jewish walk, where the foul drove, On Sabbaths, rest from everything but love: Nor Isis' temple; for that sacred whore Makes others what to Jove she was before. And if the hall itself be not belied, Even there the cause of love is often tried; Near it at least, or in the palace-yard, From whence the noisy combatants are heard, The crafty counsellors, in formal gown, There gain another's cause, but lose their own. There eloquence is nonplussed in the suit, And lawyers, who had words at will, are mute. Venus, from her adjoining temple, smiles, To see them caught in their litigious wiles. Grave senators lead home the youthful dame, Returning clients, when they patrons came. But, above all, the play-house is the place; There's choice of quarry in that narrow chase. There take thy stand, and, sharply looking out, Soon may'st thou find a mistress in the rout, For length of time, or for a single bout. The theatres are buries for the fair, Like ants on mole-hills thither they repair; Like bees to hives, so numerously they throng, It may be said, they to that place belong. Thither they swarm, who have the public voice; There choose, if plenty not distracts thy choice. To see, and to be seen, in heaps they run; Some to undo, and some to be undone. From Romulus the rise of plays began, To his new subjects a commodious man; Who, his unmarried soldiers to supply, Took care the commonwealth should multiply; Providing Sabine women for his braves, Like a true king, to get a race of slaves. His play-house not of Parian marble made, Nor was it spread with purple sails for shade; The stage with rushes, or with leaves, they strewed, No scenes in prospect, no machining god. On rows of homely turf they sat to see, Crowned with the wreaths of every common tree. There, while they sat in rustic majesty, Each lover had his mistress in his eye; And whom he saw most suiting to his mind, For joys of matrimonial rape designed. Scarce could they wait the plaudit in their haste; But, ere the dances and the song were past, The monarch gave the signal from his throne, And, rising, bade his merry men fall on. The martial crew, like soldiers ready prest, Just at the word, (the word too was, “The best,”) With joyful cries each other animate; Some choose, and some at hazard seize their mate. As doves from eagles, or from wolves the lambs, So from their lawless lovers fly the dames. Their fear was one, but not one face of fear; Some rend the lovely tresses of their hair; Some shriek, and some are struck with dumb despair. Her absent mother one invokes in vain; One stands amazed not daring to complain; The nimbler trust their feet, the slow remain. But nought availing, all are captives led, Trembling and blushing, to the genial bed. She who too long resisted, or denied, The lusty lover made by force a bride; And, with superior strength, compelled her to his side. Then soothed her thus:—“My soul's far better part, Cease weeping, nor afflict thy tender heart; For what thy father to thy mother was, That faith to thee, that solemn vow I pass.” Thus Romulus became so popular; This was the way to thrive in peace and war. To pay his army, and fresh whores to bring,— Who would not fight for such a gracious king? Thus love in theatres did first improve, And theatres are still the scenes of love. Nor shun the chariot's, and the courser's race; The circus is no inconvenient place. No need is there of talking on the hand; Nor nods, nor signs, which lovers understand: But boldly next the fair your seat provide; Close as you can to hers, and side by side. Pleased or unpleased, no matter, crowding sit; For so the laws of public shows permit. Then find occasion to begin discourse; Inquire, whose chariot this, and whose that horse? To whatsoever side she is inclined, Suit all your inclinations to her mind; Like what she likes; from thence your court begin; And whom she favours, wish that he may win. But when the statues of the deities, In chariots rolled, appear before the prize; When Venus comes, with deep devotion rise. If dust be on her lap, or grains of sand, Brush both away with your officious hand; If none be there, yet brush that nothing thence, And still to touch her lap make some pretence. Touch anything of hers; and if her train Sweep on the ground, let it not sweep in vain, But gently take it up, and wipe it clean; And while you wipe it, with observing eyes, Who knows but you may see her naked thighs! Observe, who sits behind her; and beware, Lest his encroaching knee should press the fair. Light service takes light minds; for some can tell Of favours won, by laying cushions well: By fanning faces, some their fortune meet; And some by laying footstools for their feet. These overtures of love the circus gives; Nor at the sword-play less the lover thrives; For there the son of Venus fights his prize, And deepest wounds are oft received from eyes. One, while the crowd their acclamations make, Or while he bets, and puts his ring to stake, Is struck from far, and feels the flying dart, And of the spectacle is made a part. Cæsar would represent a naval fight, For his own honour, and for Rome's delight; From either sea the youths and maidens come, And all the world was then contained in Rome. In this vast concourse, in this choice of game, What Roman heart but felt a foreign flame? Once more our prince prepares to make us glad; And the remaining East to Rome will add. Rejoice, ye Roman soldiers, in your urns; Your ensigns from the Parthians shall return, And the slain Crassi shall no longer mourn. A youth is sent those trophies to demand, And bears his father's thunder in his hand; Doubt not the imperial boy in wars unseen, In childhood all of Cæsar's race are men; Celestial seeds shoot out before their day, Prevent their years, and brook no dull delay: Thus infant Hercules the snakes did press, And in his cradle did his sire confess; Bacchus, a boy, yet like a hero fought, And early spoils from conquered India brought. Thus you your father's troops shall lead to fight, And thus shall vanquish in your father's right. These rudiments you to your lineage owe; Born to increase your titles, as you grow. Brethren you had, revenge your brethren slain; You have a father, and his rights maintain; Armed by your country's parent, and your own, Redeem your country, and restore his throne. Your enemies assert an impious cause; You fight both for divine and human laws. Already in their cause they are o'ercome; Subject them too, by force of arms, to Rome. Great father Mars with greater Cæsar join, To give a prosperous omen to your line; One of you is, and one shall be divine. I prophesy you shall, you shall o'ercome; My verse shall bring you back in triumph home. Speak in my verse, exhort to loud alarms; Oh were my numbers equal to your arms! Then would I sing the Parthians' overthrow; Their shot averse sent from a flying bow: The Parthians, who already flying fight, Already give an omen of their flight. Oh when will come the day, by heaven designed, When thou, the best and fairest of mankind, Drawn by white horses shalt in triumph ride, With conquered slaves attending on thy side; Slaves, that no longer can be safe in flight; O glorious object, O surprising sight, O day of public joy, too good to end in night! On such a day, if thou, and, next to thee, Some beauty sits, the spectacle to see; If she inquire the names of conquered kings, Of mountains, rivers, and their hidden springs, Answer to all thou knowest; and, if need be, Of things unknown seem to speak knowingly. This is Euphrates, crowned with reeds; and there Flows the swift Tigris with his sea-green hair. Invent new names of things unknown before; Call this Armenia, that the Caspian shore; Call this a Mede, and that a Parthian youth; Talk probably, no matter for the truth. In feasts, as at our shows, new means abound; More pleasure there than that of wine is found. The Paphian goddess there her ambush lays; And Love betwixt the horns of Bacchus plays; Desires increase at every swelling draught; Brisk vapours add new vigour to the thought. There Cupid's purple wings no flight afford, But, wet with wine, he flutters on the board; He shakes his pinions, but he cannot move; Fixed he remains, and turns a maudlin love. Wine warms the blood, and makes the spirits flow; Care flies, and wrinkles from the forehead go; Exalts the poor, invigorates the weak; Gives mirth and laughter, and a rosy cheek. Bold truths it speaks, and, spoken, dares maintain, And brings our old simplicity again. Love sparkles in the cup, and fills it higher; Wine feeds the flames, and fuel adds to fire. But choose no mistress in thy drunken fit; Wine gilds too much their beauties and their wit. Nor trust thy judgment when the tapers dance; But sober, and by day, thy suit advance. By daylight Paris judged the beauteous three, And for the fairest did the prize decree. Night is a cheat, and all deformities Are hid, or lessened, in her dark disguise. The sun's fair light each error will confess, In face, in shape, in jewels, and in dress. Why name I every place where youths abound? 'Tis loss of time, and a too fruitful ground. The Baian baths, where ships at anchor ride, And wholesome streams from sulphur fountains glide; Where wounded youths are by experience taught, The waters are less healthful than they thought; Or Dian's fane, which near the suburb lies, Where priests, for their promotion, fight a prize. That maiden goddess is Love's mortal foe, And much from her his subjects undergo. Thus far the sportful Muse, with myrtle bound, Has sung where lovely lasses may be found. Now let me sing, how she, who wounds your mind, With art may be to cure your wounds inclined. Young nobles, to my laws attention lend; And all you, vulgar of my school, attend. First then believe, all women may be won; Attempt with confidence, the work is done. The grasshopper shall first forbear to sing In summer season, or the birds in spring, Than women can resist your flattering skill; Even she will yield, who swears she never will. To secret pleasure both the sexes move; But women most, who most dissemble love. 'Twere best for us, if they would first declare, Avow their passion, and submit to prayer. The cow, by lowing, tells the bull her flame; The neighing mare invites her stallion to the game. Man is more temperate in his lust than they, And more than women can his passion sway. Byblis, we know, did first her love declare, And had recourse to death in her despair. Her brother she, her father Myrrha sought, And loved, but loved not as a daughter ought. Now from a tree she stills her odorous tears, Which yet the name of her who shed them bears. In Ida's shady vale a bull appeared, White as the snow, the fairest of the herd; A beauty-spot of black there only rose, Betwixt his equal horns and ample brows; The love and wish of all the Cretan cows. The queen beheld him as his head he reared, And envied every leap he gave the herd; A secret fire she nourished in her breast, And hated every heifer he caressed. A story known, and known for true, I tell; Nor Crete, though lying, can the truth conceal. She cut him grass; (so much can love command,) She stroked, she fed him with her royal hand; Was pleased in pastures with the herd to roam; And Minos by the bull was overcome. Cease, queen, with gems t'adorn thy beauteous brows; The monarch of thy heart no jewel knows. Nor in thy glass compose thy looks and eyes; Secure from all thy charms thy lover lies; Yet trust thy mirror, when it tells thee true; Thou art no heifer to allure his view. Soon wouldst thou quit thy royal diadem To thy fair rivals, to be horned like them. If Minos please, no lover seek to find; If not, at least seek one of human kind. The wretched queen the Cretan court forsakes; In woods and wilds her habitation makes: She curses every beauteous cow she sees; “Ah, why dost thou my lord and master please! And think'st, ungrateful creature as thou art, With frisking awkwardly, to gain his heart!” She said, and straight commands, with frowning look, To put her, undeserving, to the yoke; Or feigns some holy rites of sacrifice, And sees her rival's death with joyful eyes: Then, when the bloody priest has done his part, Pleased, in her hand she holds the beating heart; Nor from a scornful taunt can scarce refrain; “Go, fool, and strive to please my love again.” Now she would be Europa, Io now; (One bore a bull, and one was made a cow.) Yet she at last her brutal bliss obtained, And in a wooden cow the bull sustained; Filled with his seed, accomplished her desire, Till by his form the son betrayed the sire. If Atreus' wife to incest had not run, (But, ah, how hard it is to love but one!) His coursers Phœbus had not driven away, To shun that sight, and interrupt the day. Thy daughter, Nisus, pulled thy purple hair, And barking sea-dogs yet her bowels tear. At sea and land Atrides saved his life, Yet fell a prey to his adulterous wife. Who knows not what revenge Medea sought, When the slain offspring bore the father's fault? Thus Phœnix did a woman's love bewail; And thus Hippolytus by Phædra fell. These crimes revengeful matrons did commit; Hotter their lust, and sharper is their wit. Doubt not from them an easy victory; Scarce of a thousand dames will one deny. All women are content that men should woo; She who complains, and she who will not do. Rest then secure, whate'er thy luck may prove, Not to be hated for declaring love. And yet how canst thou miss, since woman-kind Is frail and vain, and still to change inclined? Old husbands and stale gallants they despise; And more another's, than their own, they prize. A larger crop adorns our neighbour's field; More milk his kine from swelling udders yield. First gain the maid; by her thou shalt be sure A free access and easy to procure: Who knows what to her office does belong, Is in the secret, and can hold her tongue, Bribe her with gifts, with promises, and prayers; For her good word goes far in love-affairs. The time and fit occasion leave to her, When she most aptly can thy suit prefer. The time for maids to fire their lady's blood, Is, when they find her in a merry mood. When all things at her wish and pleasure move, Her heart is open then, and free to love; Then mirth and wantonness to lust betray, And smooth the passage to the lover's way. Troy stood the siege, when filled with anxious care; One merry fit concluded all the war. If some fair rival vex her jealous mind, Offer thy service to revenge in kind. Instruct the damsel, while she combs her hair, To raise the choler of that injured fair; And, sighing, make her mistress understand, She has the means of vengeance in her hand: And swear thou languishest and diest for her. Then let her lose no time, but push at all; For women soon are raised, and soon they fall. Give their first fury leisure to relent, They melt like ice, and suddenly repent. To enjoy the maid, will that thy suit advance? 'Tis a hard question, and a doubtful chance. One maid, corrupted, bawds the better for 't; Another for herself would keep the sport. Thy business may be furthered or delayed; But, by my counsel, let alone the maid; Even though she should consent to do the feat, The profit's little, and the danger great. I will not lead thee through a rugged road, But, where the way lies open, safe, and broad. Yet if thou find'st her very much thy friend, And her good face her diligence commend, Let the fair mistress have thy first embrace, And let the maid come after in her place. But this I will advise, and mark my words; For 'tis the best advice my skill affords: If needs thou with the damsel wilt begin, Before the attempt is made, make sure to win; For then the secret better will be kept, And she can tell no tales when once she's dipt. 'Tis for the fowler's interest to beware, The bird entangled should not 'scape the snare. The fish, once pricked, avoids the bearded hook, And spoils the sport of all the neighbouring brook. But if the wench be thine, she makes thy way, And, for thy sake, her mistress will betray; Tell all she knows, and all she hears her say. Keep well the counsel of thy faithful spy; So shalt thou learn whene'er she treads awry. All things the stations of their seasons keep, And certain times there are to sow and reap. Ploughmen and sailors for the season stay, One to plough land, and one to plough the sea; So should the lover wait the lucky day. Then stop thy suit, it hurts not thy design; But think, another hour she may be thine. And when she celebrates her birth at home, Or when she views the public shows of Rome, Know, all thy visits then are troublesome. Defer thy work, and put not then to sea, For that's a boding and a stormy day. Else take thy time, and, when thou canst, begin; To break a Jewish Sabbath, think no sin: Nor even on superstitious days abstain; Not when the Romans were at Allia slain. Ill omens in her frowns are understood; When she's in humour, every day is good. But than her birthday seldom comes a worse, When bribes and presents must be sent of course; And that's a bloody day, that costs thy purse. Be staunch, yet parsimony will be vain; The craving sex will still the lover drain. No skill can shift them off, nor art remove; They will be begging, when they know we love. The merchant comes upon the appointed day, Who shall before thy face his wares display; To choose for her she craves thy kind advice; Then begs again, to bargain for the price: But when she has her purchase in her eye, She hugs thee close, and kisses thee to buy:— “'Tis what I want, and 'tis a pen'orth too; In many years I will not trouble you.” If you complain you have no ready coin; No matter, 'tis but writing of a line, A little bill, not to be paid at sight; Now curse the time when thou wert taught to write! She keeps her birthday; you must send the cheer; And she'll be born a hundred times a year. With daily lies she dribs thee into cost; That ear-ring dropt a stone, that ring is lost. They often borrow what they never pay, Whate'er you lend her, think it thrown away. Had I ten mouths and tongues to tell each art, All would be wearied ere I told a part. By letters, not by words, thy love begin; And ford the dangerous passage with thy pen. If to her heart thou aim'st to find the way, Extremely flatter, and extremely pray. Priam by prayers did Hector's body gain; Nor is an angry God invoked in vain. With promised gifts her easy mind bewitch; For e'en the poor in promise may be rich. Vain hopes awhile her appetite will stay, 'Tis a deceitful, but commodious way. Who gives is mad; but make her still believe 'Twill come, and that's the cheapest way to give. E'en barren lands fair promises afford; Buy the lean harvest cheats the starving lord. But not thy first enjoyment, lest it prove Of bad example to thy future love: But get it gratis, and she'll give thee more, For fear of losing what she gave before. The losing gamester shakes the box in vain, And bleeds, and loses on, in hopes to gain. Write then, and in thy letter, as I said, Let her with mighty promises be fed. Cydippe by a letter was betrayed, Writ on an apple to the unwary maid. She read herself into a marriage-vow; (And every cheat in love the gods allow.) Learn eloquence, ye noble youth of Rome; It will not only at the bar o'ercome: Sweet words the people and the senate move; But the chief end of eloquence is love. But in thy letter hide thy moving arts; Affect not to be thought a man of parts. None but vain fools to simple women preach; A learned letter oft has made a breach. In a familiar style your thoughts convey, And write such things as present you would say; Such words as from the heart may seem to move; 'Tis wit enough, to make her think you love. If sealed she sends it back, and will not read, Yet hope, in time, the business may succeed. In time the steer will to the yoke submit; In time the restive horse will bear the bit; Even the hard ploughshare use will wear away, And stubborn steel in length of time decay. Water is soft, and marble hard; and yet We see soft water through hard marble eat. Though late, yet Troy at length in flames expired; And ten years more Penelope had tired. Perhaps thy lines unanswered she retained; No matter, there's a point already gained; For she, who reads, in time will answer too: Things must be left by just degrees to grow. Perhaps she writes, but answers with disdain, And sharply bids you not to write again: What she requires, she fears you should accord; The jilt would not be taken at her word. Mean time, if she be carried in her chair, Approach, but do not seem to know she's there. Speak softly, to delude the standers-by; Or, if aloud, then speak ambiguously. If sauntering in the portico she walk, Move slowly too, for that's a time for talk; And sometimes follow, sometimes be her guide, But when the crowd permits, go side by side. Nor in the play-house let her sit alone; For she's the play-house, and the play, in one. There thou may'st ogle, or by signs advance Thy suit, and seem to touch her hand by chance. Admire the dancer who her liking gains, And pity in the play the lover's pains: For her sweet sake the loss of time despise; Sit while she sits, and when she rises, rise. But dress not like a fop, nor curl your hair, Nor with a pumice make your body bare; Leave those effeminate and useless toys To eunuchs, who can give no solid joys. Neglect becomes a man; thus Theseus found; Uncurled, uncombed, the nymph his wishes crowned. The rough Hippolytus was Phædra's care; And Venus thought the rude Adonis fair. Be not too finical; but yet be clean, And wear well-fashioned clothes, like other men. Let not your teeth be yellow, or be foul, Nor in wide shoes your feet too loosely roll; Of a black muzzle, and long beard, beware, And let a skilful barber cut your hair; Your nails be picked from filth, and even pared, Nor let your nasty nostrils bud with beard; Cure your unsavoury breath, gargle your throat, And free your armpits from the ram and goat: Dress not, in short, too little or too much; And be not wholly French, nor wholly Dutch. Now Bacchus calls me to his jolly rites; Who would not follow, when a god invites? He helps the poet, and his pen inspires, Kind and indulgent to his former fires. Fair Ariadne wandered on the shore, Forsaken now, and Theseus loved no more: Loose was her gown, dishevelled was her hair, Her bosom naked, and her feet were bare; Exclaiming, on the water's brink she stood; Her briny tears augment the briny flood. She shrieked, and wept, and both became her face; No posture could that heavenly form disgrace. She beat her breast: “The traitor's gone,” said she; “What shall become of poor forsaken me? What shall become”—she had not time for more, The sounding cymbals rattled on the shore. She swoons for fear, she falls upon the ground; No vital heat was in her body found. The Mimallonian dames about her stood, And scudding satyrs ran before their God. Silenus on his ass did next appear, And held upon the mane; (the God was clear) The drunken sire pursues, the dames retire; Sometimes the drunken dames pursue the drunken sire. At last he topples over on the plain; The satyrs laugh, and bid him rise again. And now the God of Wine came driving on, High on his chariot by swift tigers drawn. Her colour, voice, and sense, forsook the fair; Thrice did her trembling feet for flight prepare, And thrice, affrighted, did her flight forbear. She shook, like leaves of corn when tempests blow, Or slender reeds that in the marshes grow. To whom the God:—“Compose thy fearful mind; In me a truer husband thou shalt find. With heaven I will endow thee, and thy star Shall with propitious light be seen afar, And guide on seas the doubtful mariner.” He said, and from his chariot leaping light, Lest the grim tigers should the nymph affright, His brawny arms around her waist he threw; (For Gods, whate'er they will, with ease can do) And swiftly bore her thence: the attending throng Shout at the sight, and sing the nuptial song. Now in full bowls her sorrow she may steep; The bridegroom's liquor lays the bride asleep. But thou, when flowing cups in triumph ride, And the loved nymph is seated by thy side, Invoke the God, and all the mighty Powers, That wine may not defraud thy genial hours. Then in ambiguous words thy suit prefer, Which she may know were all addrest to her. In liquid purple letters write her name, Which she may read, and, reading, find the flame. Then may your eyes confess your mutual fires; (For eyes have tongues, and glances tell desires;) Whene'er she drinks, be first to take the cup, And, where she laid her lips, the blessing sup. When she to carving does her hand advance, Put out thy own and touch it as by chance, Thy service even her husband must attend: (A husband is a most convenient friend.) Seat the fool cuckold in the highest place, And with thy garland his dull temples grace. Whether below or equal in degree, Let him be lord of all the company, And what he says, be seconded by thee. 'Tis common to deceive through friendship's name; But, common though it be, 'tis still to blame: Thus factors frequently their trust betray, And to themselves their masters' gains convey. Drink to a certain pitch, and then give o'er; Thy tongue and feet may stumble, drinking more. Of drunken quarrels in her sight beware; Pot-valour only serves to fright the fair. Eurytion justly fell, by wine opprest, For his rude riot at a wedding-feast. Sing, if you have a voice; and show your parts In dancing, if endued with dancing arts. Do anything within your power to please; Nay, even affect a seeming drunkenness: Clip every word; and if by chance you speak Too home, or if too broad a jest you break, In your excuse the company will join, And lay the fault upon the force of wine. True drunkenness is subject to offend; But when 'tis feigned, 'tis oft a lover's friend. Then safely you may praise her beauteous face, And call him happy, who is in her grace. Her husband thinks himself the man designed; But curse the cuckold in your secret mind. When all are risen, and prepare to go, Mix with the crowd, and tread upon her toe. This is the proper time to make thy court; For now she's in the vein, and fit for sport. Lay bashfulness, that rustic virtue, by; To manly confidence thy thoughts apply. On fortune's foretop timely fix thy hold; Now speak and speed, for Venus loves the bold. No rules of rhetoric here I need afford; Only begin, and trust the following word; It will be witty of its own accord. Act well the lover; let thy speech abound In dying words, that represent thy wound; Distrust not her belief; she will be moved; All women think they merit to be loved. Sometimes a man begins to love in jest, And, after, feels the torment he professed. For your own sakes be pitiful, ye fair; For a feigned passion may a true prepare. By flatteries we prevail on womankind; As hollow banks by streams are undermined. Tell her, her face is fair, her eyes are sweet; Her taper fingers praise, and little feet. Such praises even the chaste are pleased to hear; Both maids and matrons hold their beauty dear. Once naked Pallas with Jove's queen appeared, And still they grieve that Venus was preferred. Praise the proud peacock, and he spreads his train; Be silent, and he pulls it in again. Pleased is the courser in his rapid race; Applaud his running, and he mends his pace. But largely promise, and devoutly swear; And, if need be, call every God to hear. Jove sits above, forgiving with a smile The perjuries that easy maids beguile. He swore to Juno by the Stygian lake; Forsworn, he dares not an example make, Or punish falsehood, for his own dear sake. 'Tis for our interest that the gods should be; Let us believe them; I believe, they see, And both reward, and punish equally. Not that they live above like lazy drones, Or kings below, supine upon their thrones. Lead then your lives as present in their sight; Be just in dealings, and defend the right; By fraud betray not, nor oppress by might. But 'tis a venial sin to cheat the fair; All men have liberty of conscience there. On cheating nymphs a cheat is well designed; 'Tis a profane and a deceitful kind. 'Tis said, that Egypt for nine years was dry, Nor Nile did floods, nor heaven did rain supply. A foreigner at length informed the king, That slaughtered guests would kindly moisture bring. The king replied:—“On thee the lot shall fall; Be thou my guest, the sacrifice for all.” Thus Phaleris Perillus taught to low, And made him season first the brazen cow. A rightful doom, the laws of nature cry, 'Tis, the artificers of death should die: Thus, justly women suffer by deceit; Their practice authorises us to cheat. Beg her, with tears, thy warm desires to grant; For tears will pierce a heart of adamant. If tears will not be squeezed, then rub your eye, Or 'noint the lids, and seem at least to cry. Kiss, if you can; resistance if she make, And will not give you kisses, let her take. “Fie, fie, you naughty man,” are words of course; She struggles but to be subdued by force. Kiss only soft, I charge you, and beware, With your hard bristles not to brush the fair. He who has gained a kiss, and gains no more, Deserves to lose the bliss he got before. If once she kiss, her meaning is exprest; There wants but little pushing for the rest; Which if thou dost not gain, by strength or art, The name of clown then suits with thy desert; 'Tis downright dulness, and a shameful part. Perhaps, she calls it force; but, if she 'scape, She will not thank you for the omitted rape. The sex is cunning to conceal their fires; They would be forced e'en to their own desires They seem to accuse you, with a downcast sight, But in their souls confess you did them right. Who might be forced, and yet untouched depart, Thank with their tongues, but curse you with their heart. Fair Phœbe and her sister did prefer To their dull mates the noble ravisher. What Deidamia did, in days of yore, The tale is old, but worth the reading o'er. When Venus had the golden apple gained, And the just judge fair Helen had obtained; When she with triumph was at Troy received, The Trojans joyful, while the Grecians grieved; They vowed revenge of violated laws, And Greece was arming in the cuckold's cause: Achilles, by his mother warned from war, Disguised his sex, and lurked among the fair. What means Æacides to spin and sow? With spear and sword in field thy valour show; And, leaving this, the nobler Pallas know. Why dost thou in that hand the distaff wield, Which is more worthy to sustain the shield? Or with that other draw the woolly twine, The same the fates for Hector's thread assign? Brandish thy falchion in thy powerful hand, Which can alone the ponderous lance command. In the same room by chance the royal maid Was lodged, and, by his seeming sex betrayed, Close to her side the youthful hero laid. I know not how his courtship he began; But, to her cost, she found it was a man. 'Tis thought she struggled; but withal 'tis thought, Her wish was to be conquered when she fought. For when disclosed, and hastening to the field, He laid his distaff down, and took the shield; With tears her humble suit she did prefer, And thought to stay the grateful ravisher. She sighs, she sobs, she begs him not to part; And now 'tis nature, what before was art. She strives by force her lover to detain, And wishes to be ravished once again. This is the sex; they will not first begin, But, when compelled, are pleased to suffer sin. Is there, who thinks that women first should woo? Lay by thy self-conceit, thou foolish beau! Begin, and save their modesty the shame; 'Tis well for thee, if they receive thy flame. 'Tis decent for a man to speak his mind; They but expect the occasion to be kind. Ask, that thou may'st enjoy; she waits for this; And on thy first advance depends thy bliss: Even Jove himself was forced to sue for love; None of the nymphs did first solicit Jove. But if you find your prayers increase her pride, Strike sail awhile, and wait another tide. They fly when we pursue; but make delay, And, when they see you slacken, they will stay. Sometimes it profits to conceal your end; Name not yourself her lover, but her friend. How many skittish girls have thus been caught! He proved a lover, who a friend was thought. Sailors by sun and wind are swarthy made; A tanned complexion best becomes their trade: 'Tis a disgrace to ploughmen to be fair; Bluff cheeks they have, and weather-beaten hair: The ambitious youth, who seeks an olive crown, Is sunburnt with his daily toil, and brown; But if the lover hopes to be in grace, Wan be his looks, and meagre be his face. That colour from the fair compassion draws; She thinks you sick, and thinks herself the cause. Orion wandered in the woods for love; His paleness did the nymphs to pity move; His ghastly visage argued hidden love. Nor fail a nightcap, in full health, to wear; Neglect thy dress, and discompose thy hair. All things are decent, that in love avail; Read long by night, and study to be pale; Forsake your food, refuse your needful rest, Be miserable, that you may be blest. Shall I complain, or shall I warn you most? Faith, truth, and friendship in the world are lost; A little and an empty name they boast. Trust not thy friend, much less thy mistress praise; If he believe, thou may'st a rival raise. 'Tis true, Patroclus, by no lust misled, Sought not to stain his dear companion's bed; Nor Pylades Hermione embraced; Even Phædra to Pirithous still was chaste. But hope not thou, in this vile age, to find Those rare examples of a faithful mind; The sea shall sooner with sweet honey flow, Or from the furzes pears and apples grow. We sin with gust, we love by fraud to gain, And find a pleasure in our fellow's pain. From rival foes you may the fair defend; But, would you ward the blow, beware your friend: Beware your brother, and your next of kin; But from your bosom friend your care begin. Here I had ended, but experience finds, That sundry women are of sundry minds, With various crotchets filled, and hard to please; They therefore must be caught by various ways. All things are not produced in any soil; This ground for wine is proper, that for oil. So 'tis in men, but more in womankind; Different in face, in manners, and in mind; But wise men shift their sails with every wind. As changeful Proteus varied oft his shape, And did in sundry forms and figures 'scape; A running stream, a standing tree became, A roaring lion, or a bleating lamb. Some fish with harpoons, some with darts are struck, Some drawn with nets, some hang upon the hook; So turn thyself; and, imitating them, Try several tricks, and change thy stratagem. One rule will not for different ages hold; The jades grow cunning, as they grow more old. Then talk not bawdy to the bashful maid; Broad words will make her innocence afraid: Nor to an ignorant girl of learning speak; She thinks you conjure, when you talk in Greek. And hence 'tis often seen, the simple shun The learned, and into vile embraces run. Part of my task is done, and part to do; But here 'tis time to rest myself and you. FROM OVID'S AMOURS. BOOK I. ELEG. 1. For mighty wars I thought to tune my lute, And make my measures to my subject suit. Six feet for every verse the muse designed; But Cupid, laughing, when he saw my mind, From every second verse a foot purloined. Who gave thee, boy, this arbitrary sway, On subjects, not thy own, commands to lay, Who Phœbus only and his laws obey? 'Tis more absurd than if the Queen of Love Should in Minerva's arms to battle move; Or manly Pallas from that queen should take Her torch, and o'er the dying lover shake: In fields as well may Cynthia sow the corn, Or Ceres wind in woods the bugle-horn: As well may Phœbus quit the trembling string For sword and shield; and Mars may learn to sing. Already thy dominions are too large; Be not ambitious of a foreign charge. If thou wilt reign o'er all, and everywhere, The God of Music for his harp may fear, Thus, when with soaring wings I seek renown, Thou pluck'st my pinions, and I flutter down. Could I on such mean thoughts my Muse employ, I want a mistress, or a blooming boy. Thus I complained; his bow the stripling bent, And chose an arrow fit for his intent. The shaft his purpose fatally pursues;— “Now, poet, there's a subject for thy Muse!” He said. Too well, alas! he knows his trade; For in my breast a mortal wound he made. Far hence, ye proud hexameters, remove, My verse is paced and trammelled into love. With myrtle wreaths my thoughtful brows inclose, While in unequal verse I sing my woes. FROM OVID'S AMOURS. BOOK I. ELEG. 4. To his Mistress, whose husband is invited to a feast with them. The Poet instructs her how to behave herself in his company. Your husband will be with us at the treat; May that be the last supper he shall eat! And am poor I a guest invited there, Only to see, while he may touch the fair? To see you kiss and hug your nauseous lord, While his lewd hand descends below the board? Now wonder not that Hippodamia's charms, At such a sight, the Centaurs urged to arms; That in a rage they threw their cups aside, Assailed the bridegroom, and would force the bride. I am not half a horse, (I would I were!) Yet hardly can from you my hands forbear. Take then my counsel; which, observed, may be Of some importance both to you and me. Be sure to come before your man be there; There's nothing can be done; but come, howe'er. Sit next him, (that belongs to decency,) But tread upon my foot in passing by; Read in my looks what silently they speak, And slily, with your eyes, your answer make. My lifted eye-brow shall declare my pain; My right hand to his fellow shall complain, And on the back a letter shall design, Besides a note that shall be writ in wine. Whene'er you think upon our last embrace, With your fore-finger gently touch your face; If any word of mine offend my dear, Pull, with your hand, the velvet of your ear; If you are pleased with what I do or say, Handle your rings, or with your fingers play; As suppliants use at altars, hold the board, Whene'er you wish the devil may take your lord. When he fills for you, never touch the cup, But bid the officious cuckold drink it up. The waiter on those services employ; Drink you, and I will snatch it from the boy, Watching the part where your sweet mouth hath been, And thence with eager lips will suck it in. If he, with clownish manners, thinks it fit To taste, and offer you the nasty bit, Reject his greasy kindness, and restore The unsavoury morsel he had chewed before. Nor let his arms embrace your neck, nor rest Your tender cheek upon his hairy breast; Let not his hand within your bosom stray, And rudely with your pretty bubbies play; But, above all, let him no kiss receive! That's an offence I never can forgive. Do not, O do not that sweet mouth resign, Lest I rise up in arms and cry, “'Tis mine.” I shall thrust in betwixt, and, void of fear, The manifest adulterer will appear. These things are plain to sight; but more I doubt What you conceal beneath your petticoat. Take not his leg between your tender thighs, Nor, with your hand, provoke my foe to rise. How many love inventions I deplore, Which I myself have practised all before! How oft have I been forced the robe to lift In company; to make a homely shift For a bare bout, ill huddled o'er in haste, While o'er my side the fair her mantle cast! You to your husband shall not be so kind; But, lest you should, your mantle leave behind. Encourage him to tope; but kiss him not, Nor mix one drop of water in his pot. If he be fuddled well, and snores apace, Then we may take advice from time and place. When all depart, when compliments are loud, Be sure to mix among the thickest crowd; There I will be, and there we cannot miss, Perhaps to grubble, or at least to kiss. Alas! what length of labour I employ, Just to secure a short and transient joy! For night must part us; and when night is come, Tucked underneath his arm he leads you home. He locks you in; I follow to the door, His fortune envy, and my own deplore. He kisses you, he more than kisses too; The outrageous cuckold thinks it all his due. But add not to his joy by your consent, And let it not be given, but only lent. Return no kiss, nor move in any sort; Make it a dull and a malignant sport. Had I my wish, he should no pleasure take, But slubber o'er your business for my sake; And whate'er fortune shall this night befall, Coax me to-morrow, by forswearing all. TRANSLATIONS FROM THEOCRITUS. AMARYLLIS; OR, THE THIRD IDYLLIUM OF THEOCRITUS, PARAPHRASED. To Amaryllis love compels my way, My browsing goats upon the mountains stray; O Tityrus, tend them well, and see them fed In pastures fresh, and to their watering led; And 'ware the ridgling with his budding head. Ah, beauteous nymph! can you forget your love, The conscious grottoes, and the shady grove, Where stretched at ease your tender limbs were laid, Your nameless beauties nakedly displayed? Then I was called your darling, your desire, With kisses such as set my soul on fire: But you are changed, yet I am still the same; My heart maintains for both a double flame, Grieved, but unmoved, and patient of your scorn; So faithful I, and you so much forsworn! I die, and death will finish all my pain; Yet, ere I die, behold me once again: Am I so much deformed, so changed of late? What partial judges are our love and hate! Ten wildings have I gathered for my dear; How ruddy, like your lips, their streaks appear! Far-off you viewed them with a longing eye Upon the topmost branch (the tree was high); Yet nimbly up, from bough to bough, I swerved, And for to-morrow have ten more reserved. Look on me kindly, and some pity show, Or give me leave at least to look on you. Some god transform me by his heavenly power, Even to a bee to buzz within your bower, The winding ivy-chaplet to invade, And folded fern, that your fair forehead shade. Now to my cost the force of love I find, The heavy hand it bears on humankind. The milk of tigers was his infant food, Taught from his tender years the taste of blood; His brother whelps and he ran wild about the wood. Ah, nymph, trained up in his tyrannic court, To make the sufferings of your slaves your sport! Unheeded ruin! treacherous delight! O polished hardness, softened to the sight! Whose radiant eyes your ebon brows adorn, Like midnight those, and these like break of morn! Smile once again, revive me with your charms, And let me die contented in your arms. I would not ask to live another day, Might I but sweetly kiss my soul away. Ah, why am I from empty joys debarred? For kisses are but empty when compared. I rave, and in my raging fit shall tear The garland, which I wove for you to wear, Of parsley, with a wreath of ivy bound, And bordered with a rosy edging round. What pangs I feel, unpitied and unheard! Since I must die, why is my fate deferred! I strip my body of my shepherd's frock; Behold that dreadful downfall of a rock, Where yon old fisher views the waves from high! 'Tis that convenient leap I mean to try. You would be pleased to see me plunge to shore, But better pleased if I should rise no more. I might have read my fortune long ago, When, seeking my success in love to know, I tried the infallible prophetic way, A poppy-leaf upon my palm to lay. I struck, and yet no lucky crack did follow; Yet I struck hard, and yet the leaf lay hollow; And, which was worse, if any worse could prove, The withering leaf foreshowed your withering love. Yet further,—ah, how far a lover dares! My last recourse I had to sieve and sheers, And told the witch Agreo my disease: (Agreo, that in harvest used to lease; But, harvest done, to chare-work did aspire; Meat, drink, and two-pence was her daily hire;) To work she went, her charms she muttered o'er, And yet the resty sieve wagged ne'er the more; I wept for woe, the testy beldame swore, And, foaming with her God, foretold my fate, That I was doomed to love, and you to hate. A milk-white goat for you I did provide; Two milk-white kids run frisking by her side, For which the nut-brown lass, Erithacis, Full often offered many a savoury kiss. Hers they shall be, since you refuse the price; What madman would o'erstand his market twice! My right eye itches, some good-luck is near, Perhaps my Amaryllis may appear; I'll set up such a note as she shall hear. What nymph but my melodious voice would move? She must be flint, if she refuse my love. Hippomenes, who ran with noble strife To win his lady, or to lose his life, (What shift some men will make to get a wife?) Threw down a golden apple in her way; For all her haste, she could not choose but stay: Renown said, “Run;” the glittering bribe cried “Hold;” The man might have been hanged, but for his gold. Yet some suppose 'twas love, (some few indeed!) That stopt the fatal fury of her speed: She saw, she sighed; her nimble feet refuse Their wonted speed, and she took pains to lose. A prophet some, and some a poet cry, (No matter which, so neither of them lie,) From steepy Othrys' top to Pylus drove His herd, and for his pains enjoyed his love. If such another wager should be laid, I'll find the man, if you can find the maid. Why name I men, when love extended finds His power on high, and in celestial minds? Venus the shepherd's homely habit took, And managed something else besides the crook; Nay, when Adonis died, was heard to roar, And never from her heart forgave the boar. How blest was fair Endymion with his moon, Who sleeps on Latmos' top from night to noon! What Jason from Medea's love possest, You shall not hear, but know 'tis like the rest. My aching head can scarce support the pain; This cursed love will surely turn my brain: Feel how it shoots, and yet you take no pity; Nay, then, 'tis time to end my doleful ditty. A clammy sweat does o'er my temples creep, My heavy eyes are urged with iron sleep; I lay me down to gasp my latest breath, The wolves will get a breakfast by my death; Yet scarce enough their hunger to supply, For love has made me carrion ere I die. THE EPITHALAMIUM OF HELEN AND MENELAUS, FROM THE EIGHTEENTH IDYLLIUM OF THEOCRITUS. Twelve Spartan virgins, noble, young, and fair, With violet wreaths adorned their flowing hair; And to the pompous palace did resort, Where Menelaus kept his royal court. There, hand in hand, a comely choir they led, To sing a blessing to his nuptial bed, With curious needles wrought, and painted flowers bespread. Jove's beauteous daughter now his bride must be, And Jove himself was less a God than he; For this their artful hands instruct the lute to sound, Their feet assist their hands, and justly beat the ground. This was their song:—“Why, happy bridegroom, why, Ere yet the stars are kindled in the sky, Ere twilight shades, or evening dews are shed, Why dost thou steal so soon away to bed? Has Somnus brushed thy eyelids with his rod, Or do thy legs refuse to bear their load, With flowing bowls of a more generous god? If gentle slumber on thy temples creep, (But, naughty man, thou dost not mean to sleep,) Betake thee to thy bed, thou drowsy drone, Sleep by thyself, and leave thy bride alone: Go, leave her with her maiden mates to play At sports more harmless till the break of day; Give us this evening; thou hast morn and night, And all the year before thee, for delight. O happy youth! to thee, among the crowd Of rival princes, Cupid sneezed aloud; And every lucky omen sent before, To meet thee landing on the Spartan shore. Of all our heroes, thou canst boast alone, That Jove, whene'er he thunders, calls thee son; Betwixt two sheets thou shalt enjoy her bare, With whom no Grecian virgin can compare; So soft, so sweet, so balmy, and so fair. A boy, like thee, would make a kingly line; But oh, a girl like her must be divine. Her equals we in years, but not in face, Twelve score viragos of the Spartan race, While naked to Eurotas' banks we bend, And there in manly exercise contend, When she appears, are all eclipsed and lost, And hide the beauties that we made our boast. So, when the night and winter disappear, The purple morning, rising with the year, Salutes the spring, as her celestial eyes Adorn the world, and brighten all the skies; So beauteous Helen shines among the rest, Tall, slender, straight, with all the Graces blest. As pines the mountains, or as fields the corn, Or as Thessalian steeds the race adorn; So rosy-coloured Helen is the pride Of Lacedemon, and of Greece beside. Like her no nymph can willing osiers bend In basket-works, which painted streaks commend; With Pallas in the loom she may contend. But none, ah! none can animate the lyre, And the mute strings with vocal souls inspire; Whether the learned Minerva be her theme, Or chaste Diana bathing in the stream, None can record their heavenly praise so well As Helen, in whose eyes ten thousand Cupids dwell. O fair, O graceful! yet with maids enrolled, But whom to-morrow's sun a matron shall behold! Yet ere to-morrow's sun shall show his head, The dewy paths of meadows we will tread, For crowns and chaplets to adorn thy head. Where all shall weep, and wish for thy return, As bleating lambs their absent mother mourn. Our noblest maids shall to thy name bequeath The boughs of Lotus, formed into a wreath. This monument, thy maiden beauties due, High on a plane-tree shall be hung to view; On the smooth rind the passenger shall see Thy name engraved, and worship Helen's tree; Balm, from a silver box distilled around, Shall all bedew the roots, and scent the sacred ground. The balm, 'tis true, can aged plants prolong, But Helen's name will keep it ever young. “Hail bride, hail bridegroom, son-in-law to Jove! With fruitful joys Latona bless your love! Let Venus furnish you with full desires, Add vigour to your wills, and fuel to your fires! Almighty Jove augment your wealthy store, Give much to you, and to his grandsons more! From generous loins a generous race will spring, Each girl, like her, a queen; each boy, like you, a king. Now sleep, if sleep you can; but while you rest, Sleep close, with folded arms, and breast to breast. Rise in the morn; but oh! before you rise, Forget not to perform your morning sacrifice. We will be with you ere the crowing cock Salutes the light, and struts before his feathered flock. Hymen, O Hymen, to thy triumphs run, And view the mighty spoils thou hast in battle won!” THE DESPAIRING LOVER. FROM THE TWENTY-THIRD IDYLLIUM OF THEOCRITUS. With inauspicious love, a wretched swain Pursued the fairest nymph of all the plain; Fairest indeed, but prouder far than fair, She plunged him hopeless in a deep despair: Her heavenly form too haughtily she prized, His person hated, and his gifts despised; Nor knew the force of Cupid's cruel darts, Nor feared his awful power on human hearts; But either from her hopeless lover fled, Or with disdainful glances shot him dead. No kiss, no look, to cheer the drooping boy, No word she spoke, she scorned even to deny; But, as a hunted panther casts about Her glaring eyes, and pricks her listening ears to scout; So she, to shun his toils, her cares employed, And fiercely in her savage freedom joyed. Her mouth she writhed, her forehead taught to frown, Her eyes to sparkle fires to love unknown; Her sallow cheeks her envious mind did shew, And every feature spoke aloud the curstness of a shrew. Yet could not he his obvious fate escape; His love still dressed her in a pleasing shape; And every sullen frown, and bitter scorn, But fanned the fuel that too fast did burn. Long time, unequal to his mighty pain, He strove to curb it, but he strove in vain; At last his woes broke out, and begged relief With tears, the dumb petitioners of grief; With tears so tender, as adorned his love, And any heart, but only hers, would move. Trembling before her bolted doors he stood, And there poured out the unprofitable flood; Staring his eyes, and haggard was his look; Then, kissing first the threshold, thus he spoke. “Ah, nymph, more cruel than of human race! Thy tigress heart belies thy angel face; Too well thou show'st thy pedigree from stone, Thy grandame's was the first by Pyrrha thrown; Unworthy thou to be so long desired; But so my love, and so my fate required. I beg not now (for 'tis in vain) to live; But take this gift, the last that I can give. This friendly cord shall soon decide the strife Betwixt my lingering love and loathsome life: This moment puts an end to all my pain; I shall no more despair, nor thou disdain. Farewell, ungrateful and unkind! I go Condemned by thee to those sad shades below. I go the extremest remedy to prove, To drink oblivion, and to drench my love: There happily to lose my long desires; But ah! what draught so deep to quench my fires? Farewell, ye never-opening gates, ye stones, And threshold guilty of my midnight moans! What I have suffered here ye know too well; What I shall do, the Gods and I can tell. The rose is fragrant, but it fades in time; The violet sweet, but quickly past the prime; White lilies hang their heads, and soon decay, And whiter snow in minutes melts away: Such is your blooming youth, and withering so; The time will come, it will, when you shall know The rage of love; your haughty heart shall burn In flames like mine, and meet a like return. Obdurate as you are, oh! hear at least My dying prayers, and grant my last request!— When first you ope your doors, and, passing by, The sad ill-omened object meets your eye, Think it not lost a moment if you stay; The breathless wretch, so made by you, survey; Some cruel pleasure will from thence arise, To view the mighty ravage of your eyes. I wish (but oh! my wish is vain, I fear) The kind oblation of a falling tear. Then loose the knot, and take me from the place, And spread your mantle o'er my grisly face; Upon my livid lips bestow a kiss,— O envy not the dead, they feel not bliss! Nor fear your kisses can restore my breath; Even you are not more pitiless than death. Then for my corpse a homely grave provide, Which love and me from public scorn may hide; Thrice call upon my name, thrice beat your breast, And hail me thrice to everlasting rest: Last, let my tomb this sad inscription bear;— ‘A wretch, whom love has killed, lies buried here; O passengers, Aminta's eyes beware.’” Thus having said, and furious with his love, He heaved, with more than human force, to move A weighty stone, (the labour of a team,) And, raised from thence, he reached the neighbouring beam; Around its bulk a sliding knot he throws, And fitted to his neck the fatal noose; Then, spurning backward, took a swing, till death Crept up, and stopt the passage of his breath. The bounce burst ope the door; the scornful fair Relentless looked, and saw him beat his quivering feet in air; Nor wept his fate, nor cast a pitying eye, Nor took him down, but brushed regardless by; And, as she passed, her chance or fate was such, Her garments touched the dead, polluted by the touch. Next to the dance, thence to the bath did move; The bath was sacred to the God of Love; Whose injured image, with a wrathful eye, Stood threatening from a pedestal on high. Nodding a while, and watchful of his blow, He fell, and, falling, crushed the ungrateful nymph below: Her gushing blood the pavement all besmeared; And this her last expiring voice was heard;— “Lovers, farewell, revenge has reached my scorn; Thus warned, be wise, and love for love return.” DAPHNIS AND CHLORIS. FROM THE TWENTY-SEVENTH IDYLLIUM OF THEOCRITUS. DAPHNIS. The shepherd Paris bore the Spartan bride By force away, and then by force enjoyed; But I by free consent can boast a bliss, A fairer Helen, and a sweeter kiss. CHLORIS. Kisses are empty joys, and soon are o'er. DAPHNIS. A kiss betwixt the lips is something more. CHLORIS. I wipe my mouth, and where's your kissing then? DAPHNIS. I swear you wipe it to be kissed again. CHLORIS. Go, tend your herd, and kiss your cows at home; I am a maid, and in my beauty's bloom. DAPHNIS. 'Tis well remembered; do not waste your time, But wisely use it ere you pass your prime. CHLORIS. Blown roses hold their sweetness to the last, And raisins keep their luscious native taste. DAPHNIS. The sun's too hot; those olive shades are near; I fain would whisper something in your ear. CHLORIS. 'Tis honest talking where we may be seen; God knows what secret mischief you may mean; I doubt you'll play the wag, and kiss again. DAPHNIS. At least beneath yon elm you need not fear; My pipe's in tune, if you're disposed to hear. CHLORIS. Play by yourself, I dare not venture thither; You, and your naughty pipe, go hang together. DAPHNIS. Coy nymph, beware, lest Venus you offend. CHLORIS. I shall have chaste Diana still to friend. DAPHNIS. You have a soul, and Cupid has a dart. CHLORIS. Diana will defend, or heal my heart. Nay, fie, what mean you in this open place? Unhand me, or I swear I'll scratch your face. Let go for shame; you make me mad for spite; My mouth's my own; and, if you kiss, I'll bite; DAPHNIS. Away with your dissembling female tricks; What, would you 'scape the fate of all your sex? CHLORIS. I swear, I'll keep my maidenhead till death, And die as pure as Queen Elizabeth. DAPHNIS. Nay, mum for that, but let me lay thee down; Better with me, than with some nauseous clown. CHLORIS. I'd have you know, if I were so inclined, I have been woo'd by many a wealthy hind; But never found a husband to my mind. DAPHNIS. But they are absent all, and I am here. CHLORIS. The matrimonial yoke is hard to bear, And marriage is a woful word to hear. DAPHNIS. A scarecrow, set to frighten fools away; Marriage has joys, and you shall have assay. CHLORIS. Sour sauce is often mixed with our delight; You kick by day more than you kiss by night. DAPHNIS. Sham stories all; but say the worst you can, A very wife fears neither God nor man. CHLORIS. But childbirth is, they say, a deadly pain; It costs at least a month to knit again. DAPHNIS. Diana cures the wounds Lucina made; Your goddess is a midwife by her trade. CHLORIS. But I shall spoil my beauty, if I bear. DAPHNIS. But Mam and Dad are pretty names to hear. CHLORIS. But there's a civil question used of late; Where lies my jointure, where your own estate? DAPHNIS. My flocks, my fields, my woods, my pastures take, With settlement as good as law can make. CHLORIS. Swear then you will not leave me on the common, But marry me, and make an honest woman. DAPHNIS. I swear by Pan, though he wears horns you'll say, Cudgelled and kicked, I'll not be forced away. CHLORIS. I bargain for a wedding-bed at least, A house, and handsome lodging for a guest. DAPHNIS. A house well furnished shall be thine to keep; And, for a flock-bed, I can shear my sheep. CHLORIS. What tale shall I to my old father tell? DAPHNIS. 'Twill make him chuckle thou'rt bestowed so well. CHLORIS. But, after all, in troth I am to blame To be so loving, ere I know your name; A pleasant sounding name's a pretty thing. DAPHNIS. Faith, mine's a very pretty name to sing. They call me Daphnis; Lycidas my sire; Both sound as well as woman can desire. Nomæa bore me; farmers in degree; He a good husband, a good housewife she. CHLORIS. Your kindred is not much amiss, 'tis true; Yet I am somewhat better born than you. DAPHNIS. I know your father, and his family; And, without boasting, am as good as he, Menalcas; and no master goes before. CHLORIS. Hang both our pedigrees! not one word more; But if you love me, let me see your living, Your house, and home; for seeing is believing. DAPHNIS. See first yon cypress grove, a shade from noon. CHLORIS. Browse on, my goats; for I'll be with you soon. DAPHNIS. Feed well, my bulls, to whet your appetite, That each may take a lusty leap at night. CHLORIS. What do you mean, uncivil as you are, To touch my breasts, and leave my bosom bare? DAPHNIS. These pretty bubbies, first, I make my own. CHLORIS. Pull out your hand, I swear, or I shall swoon. DAPHNIS. Why does thy ebbing blood forsake thy face? CHLORIS. Throw me at least upon a cleaner place; My linen ruffled, and my waistcoat soiling— What, do you think new clothes were made for spoiling? DAPHNIS. I'll lay my lambkins underneath thy back. CHLORIS. My head-gear's off; what filthy work you make DAPHNIS. To Venus, first, I lay these offerings by. CHLORIS. Nay, first look round, that nobody be nigh: Methinks I hear a whispering in the grove. DAPHNIS. The cypress trees are telling tales of love. CHLORIS. You tear off all behind me, and before me; And I'm as naked as my mother bore me. DAPHNIS. I'll buy thee better clothes than these I tear, And lie so close I'll cover thee from air. CHLORIS. You're liberal now; but when your turn is sped, You'll wish me choked with every crust of bread. DAPHNIS. I'll give thee more, much more than I have told; Would I could coin my very heart to gold! CHLORIS. Forgive thy handmaid, huntress of the wood! I see there's no resisting flesh and blood! DAPHNIS. The noble deed is done!—my herds I'll cull; Cupid, be thine a calf; and Venus, thine a bull. CHLORIS. A maid I came in an unlucky hour, But hence return without my virgin flower. DAPHNIS. A maid is but a barren name at best; If thou canst hold, I bid for twins at least. Thus did this happy pair their love dispense With mutual joys, and gratified their sense; The God of Love was there, a bidden guest, And present at his own mysterious feast. His azure mantle underneath he spread, And scattered roses on the nuptial bed; While folded in each other's arms they lay, He blew the flames, and furnished out the play, And from their foreheads wiped the balmy sweat away. First rose the maid, and with a glowing face, Her downcast eyes beheld her print upon the grass; Thence to her herd she sped herself in haste: The bridegroom started from his trance at last, And piping homeward jocundly he past. TRANSLATIONS FROM LUCRETIUS. THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST BOOK OF LUCRETIUS. Delight of humankind, and gods above, Parent of Rome, propitious Queen of Love! Whose vital power, air, earth, and sea supplies, And breeds whate'er is born beneath the rolling skies; For every kind, by thy prolific might, Springs, and beholds the regions of the light. Thee, goddess, thee the clouds and tempests fear, And at thy pleasing presence disappear; For thee the land in fragrant flowers is drest; For thee the ocean smiles, and smooths her wavy breast, And heaven itself with more serene and purer light is blest. For, when the rising spring adorns the mead, And a new scene of nature stands displayed, When teeming buds, and cheerful greens appear, And western gales unlock the lazy year; The joyous birds thy welcome first express, Whose native songs thy genial fire confess; Then savage beasts bound o'er their slighted food, Struck with thy darts, and tempt the raging flood. All nature is thy gift; earth, air, and sea; Of all that breathes, the various progeny, Stung with delight, is goaded on by thee. O'er barren mountains, o'er the flowery plain, The leafy forest, and the liquid main, Extends thy uncontrolled and boundless reign; Through all the living regions dost thou move, And scatterest, where thou goest, the kindly seeds of love. Since, then, the race of every living thing Obeys thy power; since nothing new can spring Without thy warmth, without thy influence bear, Or beautiful, or lovesome can appear; Be thou my aid, my tuneful song inspire, And kindle with thy own productive fire; While all thy province, Nature, I survey, And sing to Memmius an immortal lay Of heaven and earth, and everywhere thy wondrous power display: To Memmius, under thy sweet influence born, Whom thou with all thy gifts and graces dost adorn. The rather then assist my Muse and me, Infusing verses worthy him and thee. Meantime on land and sea let barbarous discord cease, And lull the list'ning world in universal peace. To thee mankind their soft repose must owe, For thou alone that blessing canst bestow; Because the brutal business of the war Is managed by thy dreadful servant's care; Who oft retires from fighting fields, to prove The pleasing pains of thy eternal love; And, panting on thy breast, supinely lies, While with thy heavenly form he feeds his famished eyes; Sucks in with open lips thy balmy breath, By turns restored to life, and plunged in pleasing death. There while thy curling limbs about him move, Involved and fettered in the links of love, When, wishing all, he nothing can deny, Thy charms in that auspicious moment try; With winning eloquence our peace implore, And quiet to the weary world restore. THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND BOOK OF LUCRETIUS. 'Tis pleasant, safely to behold from shore The rolling ship, and hear the tempest roar; Not that another's pain is our delight, But pains unfelt produce the pleasing sight. 'Tis pleasant also to behold from far The moving legions mingled in the war; But much more sweet thy labouring steps to guide To virtue's heights, with wisdom well supplied, And all the magazines of learning fortified; From thence to look below on humankind, Bewildered in the maze of life, and blind; To see vain fools ambitiously contend For wit and power; their last endeavours bend To outshine each other, waste their time and health In search of honour, and pursuit of wealth. O wretched man! in what a mist of life, Inclosed with dangers and with noisy strife, He spends his little span; and overfeeds His crammed desires, with more than nature needs! For nature wisely stints our appetite, And craves no more than undisturbed delight; Which minds, unmixed with cares and fears, obtain; A soul serene, a body void of pain. So little this corporeal frame requires, So bounded are our natural desires, That wanting all, and setting pain aside, With bare privation sense is satisfied. If golden sconces hang not on the walls, To light the costly suppers and the balls; If the proud palace shines not with the state Of burnished bowls, and of reflected plate; If well-tuned harps, nor the more pleasing sound Of voices, from the vaulted roofs rebound; Yet on the grass, beneath a poplar shade, By the cool stream, our careless limbs are laid; With cheaper pleasures innocently blest, When the warm spring with gaudy flowers is drest. Nor will the raging fever's fire abate, With golden canopies, and beds of state; But the poor patient will as soon be sound On the hard mattress, or the mother ground. Then since our bodies are not eased the more By birth, or power, or fortune's wealthy store, 'Tis plain, these useless toys of every kind As little can relieve the labouring mind; Unless we could suppose the dreadful sight Of marshalled legions moving to the fight, Could, with their sound and terrible array, Expel our fears, and drive the thoughts of death away. But, since the supposition vain appears, Since clinging cares, and trains of inbred fears, Are not with sounds to be affrighted thence, But in the midst of pomp pursue the prince, Not awed by arms, but in the presence bold, Without respect to purple, or to gold; Why should not we these pageantries despise, Whose worth but in our want of reason lies? For life is all in wandering errors led; And just as children are surprised with dread, And tremble in the dark, so riper years, Even in broad day-light, are possessed with fears, And shake at shadows fanciful and vain, As those which in the breasts of children reign. These bugbears of the mind, this inward hell, No rays of outward sunshine can dispel; But nature and right reason must display Their beams abroad, and bring the darksome soul to day. THE LATTER PART OF THE THIRD BOOK OF LUCRETIUS, AGAINST THE FEAR OF DEATH. What has this bugbear, death, to frighten men, If souls can die, as well as bodies can? For, as before our birth we felt no pain, When Punic arms infested land and main, When heaven and earth were in confusion hurled, For the debated empire of the world, Which awed with dreadful expectation lay, Sure to be slaves, uncertain who should sway: So, when our mortal flame shall be disjoined, The lifeless lump uncoupled from the mind, From sense of grief and pain we shall be free; We shall not feel, because we shall not be. Though earth in seas, and seas in heaven were lost, We should not move, we only should be tost. Nay, even suppose, when we have suffered fate, The soul could feel in her divided state, What's that to us? for we are only we, While souls and bodies in one frame agree. Nay, though our atoms should revolve by chance, And matter leap into the former dance; Though time our life and motion could restore, And make our bodies what they were before; What gain to us would all this bustle bring? The new-made man would be another thing. When once an interrupting pause is made, That individual being is decayed. We, who are dead and gone, shall bear no part In all the pleasures, nor shall feel the smart, Which to that other mortal shall accrue, Whom of our matter time shall mould anew. For backward if you look on that long space Of ages past, and view the changing face Of matter, tost, and variously combined In sundry shapes, 'tis easy for the mind From thence to infer, that seeds of things have been In the same order as they now are seen; Which yet our dark remembrance cannot trace, Because a pause of life, a gaping space, Has come betwixt, where memory lies dead, And all the wandering motions from the sense are fled. For, whosoe'er shall in misfortunes live, Must be, when those misfortunes shall arrive; And since the man who is not, feels not woe, (For death exempts him, and wards off the blow, Which we, the living, only feel and bear,) What is there left for us in death to fear? When once that pause of life has come between. 'Tis just the same as we had never been. And, therefore, if a man bemoan his lot, That after death his mouldering limbs shall rot, Or flames, or jaws of beasts devour his mass, Know, he's an unsincere, unthinking ass. A secret sting remains within his mind; The fool is to his own cast offals kind. He boasts no sense can after death remain; Yet makes himself a part of life again, As if some other he could feel the pain. If, while we live, this thought molest his head, What wolf or vulture shall devour me dead? He wastes his days in idle grief, nor can Distinguish 'twixt the body and the man; But thinks himself can still himself survive, And, what when dead he feels not, feels alive. Then he repines that he was born to die, Nor knows in death there is no other he, No living he remains his grief to vent, And o'er his senseless carcase to lament. If, after death, 'tis painful to be torn By birds, and beasts, then why not so to burn, Or drenched in floods of honey to be soaked, Embalmed to be at once preserved and choked; Or on an airy mountain's top to lie, Exposed to cold and heaven's inclemency; Or crowded in a tomb, to be opprest With monumental marble on thy breast? But to be snatched from all the household joys, From thy chaste wife, and thy dear prattling boys, Whose little arms about thy legs are cast, And climbing for a kiss prevent their mother's haste, Inspiring secret pleasure through thy breast; Ah! these shall be no more; thy friends opprest Thy care and courage now no more shall free; “Ah! wretch,” thou criest, “ah! miserable me! One woful day sweeps children, friends, and wife, And all the brittle blessings of my life!” Add one thing more, and all thou say'st is true; Thy want and wish of them is vanished too; Which, well considered, were a quick relief To all thy vain imaginary grief: For thou shalt sleep, and never wake again, And, quitting life, shalt quit thy loving pain. But we, thy friends, shall all those sorrows find, Which in forgetful death thou leav'st behind; No time shall dry our tears, nor drive thee from our mind. The worst that can befall thee, measured right, Is a sound slumber, and a long good-night. Yet thus the fools, that would be thought the wits, Disturb their mirth with melancholy fits; When healths go round, and kindly brimmers flow, Till the fresh garlands on their foreheads glow, They whine, and cry, “Let us make haste to live, Short are the joys that human life can give.” Eternal preachers, that corrupt the draught, And pall the god, that never thinks, with thought; Idiots with all that thought, to whom the worst Of death, is want of drink, and endless thirst, Or any fond desire as vain as these. For, even in sleep, the body, wrapt in ease, Supinely lies, as in the peaceful grave; And, wanting nothing, nothing can it crave. Were that sound sleep eternal, it were death; Yet the first atoms then, the seeds of breath, Are moving near to sense; we do but shake And rouse that sense, and straight we are awake. Then death to us, and death's anxiety, Is less than nothing, if a less could be; For then our atoms, which in order lay, Are scattered from their heap, and puffed away, And never can return into their place, When once the pause of life has left an empty space. And, last, suppose great Nature's voice should call To thee, or me, or any of us all,— “What dost thou mean, ungrateful wretch, thou vain, Thou mortal thing, thus idly to complain, And sigh and sob, that thou shalt be no more? For, if thy life were pleasant heretofore, If all the bounteous blessings I could give Thou hast enjoyed, if thou hast known to live, And pleasure not leaked through thee like a sieve; Why dost thou not give thanks as at a plenteous feast, Crammed to the throat with life, and rise and take thy rest? But, if my blessings thou hast thrown away, If undigested joys passed through, and would not stay, Why dost thou wish for more to squander still? If life be grown a load, a real ill, And I would all thy cares and labours end, Lay down thy burden, fool, and know thy friend. To please thee, I have emptied all my store; I can invent, and can supply no more, But run the round again, the round I ran before. Suppose thou art not broken yet with years, Yet still the self-same scene of things appears, And would be ever, couldst thou ever live; For life is still but life, there's nothing new to give.” What can we plead against so just a bill? We stand convicted, and our cause goes ill. But if a wretch, a man oppressed by fate, Should beg of nature to prolong his date, She speaks aloud to him with more disdain,— “Be still, thou martyr fool, thou covetous of pain.” But if an old decrepit sot lament,— “What, thou!” she cries, “who hast outlived content! Dost thou complain, who hast enjoyed my store? But this is still the effect of wishing more. Unsatisfied with all that nature brings; Loathing the present, liking absent things; From hence it comes, thy vain desires, at strife Within themselves, have tantalised thy life, And ghastly death appeared before thy sight, Ere thou hast gorged thy soul and senses with delight. Now leave those joys, unsuiting to thy age, To a fresh comer, and resign the stage.” Is Nature to be blamed if thus she chide? No, sure; for 'tis her business to provide Against this ever-changing frame's decay, New things to come, and old to pass away. One being, worn, another being makes; Changed, but not lost; for nature gives and takes: New matter must be found for things to come, And these must waste like those, and follow nature's doom. All things, like thee, have time to rise and rot, And from each other's ruin are begot: For life is not confined to him or thee; 'Tis given to all for use, to none for property. Consider former ages past and gone, Whose circles ended long ere thine begun, Then tell me, fool, what part in them thou hast? Thus may'st thou judge the future by the past. What horror seest thou in that quiet state, What bugbear dreams to fright thee after fate? No ghost, no goblins, that still passage keep; But all is there serene, in that eternal sleep. For all the dismal tales, that poets tell, Are verified on earth, and not in hell. No Tantalus looks up with fearful eye, Or dreads the impending rock to crush him from on high; But fear of chance on earth disturbs our easy hours, Or vain imagined wrath of vain imagined powers. No Tityus torn by vultures lies in hell; Nor could the lobes of his rank liver swell To that prodigious mass, for their eternal meal; Not though his monstrous bulk had covered o'er Nine spreading acres, or nine thousand more; Not though the globe of earth had been the giant's floor; Nor in eternal torments could he lie, Nor could his corpse sufficient food supply. But he's the Tityus, who, by love opprest, Or tyrant passion preying on his breast, And ever anxious thoughts, is robbed of rest. The Sisyphus is he, whom noise and strife Seduce from all the soft retreats of life, To vex the government, disturb the laws; Drunk with the fumes of popular applause, He courts the giddy crowd to make him great, And sweats and toils in vain, to mount the sovereign seat. For, still to aim at power, and still to fail, Ever to strive, and never to prevail, What is it, but, in reason's true account, To heave the stone against the rising mount? Which urged, and laboured, and forced up with pain, Recoils, and rolls impetuous down, and smokes along the plain. Then, still to treat thy ever-craving mind With every blessing, and of every kind, Yet never fill thy ravening appetite, Though years and seasons vary thy delight, Yet nothing to be seen of all the store, But still the wolf within thee barks for more; This is the fable's moral, which they tell Of fifty foolish virgins damned in hell To leaky vessels, which the liquor spill; To vessels of their sex, which none could ever fill. As for the dog, the furies, and their snakes, The gloomy caverns, and the burning lakes, And all the vain infernal trumpery, They neither are, nor were, nor e'er can be. But here, on earth, the guilty have in view The mighty pains to mighty mischiefs due; Racks, prisons, poisons, the Tarpeian rock, Stripes, hangmen, pitch, and suffocating smoke; And last, and most, if these were cast behind, The avenging horror of a conscious mind; Whose deadly fear anticipates the blow, And sees no end of punishment and woe, But looks for more, at the last gasp of breath; This makes an hell on earth, and life a death. Meantime, when thoughts of death disturb thy head, Consider, Ancus, great and good, is dead; Ancus, thy better far, was born to die, And thou, dost thou bewail mortality? So many monarchs with their mighty state, Who ruled the world, were overruled by fate. That haughty king, who lorded o'er the main, And whose stupendous bridge did the wild waves restrain, (In vain they foamed, in vain they threatened wreck, While his proud legions marched upon their back,) Him death, a greater monarch, overcame; Nor spared his guards the more, for their immortal name. The Roman chief, the Carthaginian dread, Scipio, the thunderbolt of war, is dead, And, like a common slave, by fate in triumph led. The founders of invented arts are lost, And wits, who made eternity their boast. Where now is Homer, who possessed the throne? The immortal work remains, the immortal author's gone. Democritus, perceiving age invade, His body weakened, and his mind decayed, Obeyed the summons with a cheerful face; Made haste to welcome death, and met him half the race. That stroke even Epicurus could not bar, Though he in wit surpassed mankind, as far As does the midday sun the midnight star. And thou, dost thou disdain to yield thy breath, Whose very life is little more than death? More than one half by lazy sleep possest; And when awake, thy soul but nods at best, Day-dreams and sickly thoughts revolving in thy breast, Eternal troubles haunt thy anxious mind, Whose cause and cure thou never hop'st to find; But still uncertain, with thyself at strife, Thou wanderest in the labyrinth of life. Oh, if the foolish race of man, who find A weight of cares still pressing on their mind, Could find as well the cause of this unrest, And all this burden lodged within the breast; Sure they would change their course, nor live as now, Uncertain what to wish, or what to vow. Uneasy both in country and in town, They search a place to lay their burden down. One, restless in his palace, walks abroad, And vainly thinks to leave behind the load, But straight returns; for he's as restless there, And finds there's no relief in open-air. Another to his villa would retire, And spurs as hard as if it were on fire; No sooner entered at his country door, But he begins to stretch, and yawn, and snore, Or seeks the city, which he left before. Thus every man o'erworks his weary will, To shun himself, and to shake off his ill; The shaking fit returns, and hangs upon him still. No prospect of repose, nor hope of ease, The wretch is ignorant of his disease; Which, known, would all his fruitless trouble spare, For he would know the world not worth his care: Then would he search more deeply for the cause, And study nature well, and nature's laws; For in this moment lies not the debate, But on our future, fixed, eternal state; That never-changing state, which all must keep, Whom death has doomed to everlasting sleep. Why are we then so fond of mortal life, Beset with dangers, and maintained with strife? A life, which all our care can never save; One fate attends us, and one common grave. Besides, we tread but a perpetual round; We ne'er strike out, but beat the former ground, And the same mawkish joys in the same track are found. For still we think an absent blessing best, Which cloys, and is no blessing when possest; A new arising wish expels it from the breast. The feverish thirst of life increases still; We call for more and more, and never have our fill; Yet know not what to-morrow we shall try, What dregs of life in the last draught may lie. Nor, by the longest life we can attain, One moment from the length of death we gain; For all behind belongs to his eternal reign. When once the fates have cut the mortal thread, The man as much to all intents is dead, Who dies to-day, and will as long be so, As he who died a thousand years ago. THE LATTER PART OF THE FOURTH BOOK OF LUCRETIUS; CONCERNING THE NATURE OF LOVE. BEGINNING AT THIS LINE: Sic igitur Veneris qui elis accipit ictum, etc. Thus, therefore, he, who feels the fiery dart Of strong desire transfix his amorous heart, Whether some beauteous boy's alluring face, Or lovelier maid, with unresisting grace, From her each part the winged arrow sends, From whence he first was struck he thither tends; Restless he roams, impatient to be freed, And eager to inject the sprightly seed; For fierce desire does all his mind employ, And ardent love assures approaching joy. Such is the nature of that pleasing smart, Whose burning drops distil upon the heart, The fever of the soul shot from the fair, And the cold ague of succeeding care. If absent, her idea still appears, And her sweet name is chiming in your ears. But strive those pleasing phantoms to remove, And shun the aërial images of love, That feed the flame: when one molests thy mind, Discharge thy loins on all the leaky kind; For that's a wiser way, than to restrain Within thy swelling nerves that hoard of pain. For every hour some deadlier symptom shows, And by delay the gathering venom grows, When kindly applications are not used; The scorpion, love, must on the wound be bruised. On that one object 'tis not safe to stay, But force the tide of thought some other way; The squandered spirits prodigally throw, And in the common glebe of nature sow. Nor wants he all the bliss that lovers feign, Who takes the pleasure, and avoids the pain; For purer joys in purer health abound, And less affect the sickly than the sound. When love its utmost vigour does employ, Even then 'tis but a restless wandering joy; Nor knows the lover in that wild excess, With hands or eyes, what first he would possess; But strains at all, and, fastening where he strains, Too closely presses with his frantic pains; With biting kisses hurts the twining fair, Which shows his joys imperfect, insincere: For, stung with inward rage, he flings around, And strives to avenge the smart on that which gave the wound. But love those eager bitings does restrain, And mingling pleasure mollifies the pain. For ardent hope still flatters anxious grief, And sends him to his foe to seek relief: Which yet the nature of the thing denies; For love, and love alone of all our joys, By full possession does but fan the fire; The more we still enjoy, the more we still desire. Nature for meat and drink provides a space, And, when received, they fill their certain place; Hence thirst and hunger may be satisfied, But this repletion is to love denied: Form, feature, colour, whatsoe'er delight Provokes the lover's endless appetite, These fill no space, nor can we thence remove With lips, or hands, or all our instruments of love: In our deluded grasp we nothing find, But thin aërial shapes, that fleet before the mind. As he, who in a dream with drought is curst, And finds no real drink to quench his thirst, Runs to imagined lakes his heat to steep, And vainly swills and labours in his sleep; So love with phantoms cheats our longing eyes, Which hourly seeing never satisfies: Our hands pull nothing from the parts they strain, But wander o'er the lovely limbs in vain. Nor when the youthful pair more closely join, When hands in hands they lock, and thighs in thighs they twine, Just in the raging foam of full desire, When both press on, both murmur, both expire, They gripe, they squeeze, their humid tongues they dart, As each would force their way to t'other's heart: In vain; they only cruise about the coast; For bodies cannot pierce, nor be in bodies lost, As sure they strive to be, when both engage In that tumultuous momentary rage; So tangled in the nets of love they lie, Till man dissolves in that excess of joy. Then, when the gathered bag has burst its way, And ebbing tides the slackened nerves betray, A pause ensues; and nature nods awhile, Till with recruited rage new spirits boil; And then the same vain violence returns, With flames renewed the erected furnace burns; Again they in each other would be lost, But still by adamantine bars are crost. All ways they try, successless all they prove, To cure the secret sore of lingering love. Besides— They waste their strength in the venereal strife, And to a woman's will enslave their life; The estate runs out, and mortgages are made, All offices of friendship are decayed, Their fortune ruined, and their fame betrayed. Assyrian ointment from their temples flows, And diamond buckles sparkle in their shoes; The cheerful emerald twinkles on their hands, With all the luxury of foreign lands; And the blue coat, that with embroidery shines, Is drunk with sweat of their o'er-laboured loins. Their frugal father's gains they misemploy, And turn to point, and pearl, and every female toy. French fashions, costly treats are their delight; The park by day, and plays and balls by night. In vain;— For in the fountain, where their sweets are sought, Some bitter bubbles up, and poisons all the draught. First, guilty conscience does the mirror bring, Then sharp remorse shoots out her angry sting; And anxious thoughts, within themselves at strife, Upbraid the long misspent, luxurious life. Perhaps, the fickle fair one proves unkind, Or drops a doubtful word, that pains his mind, And leaves a rankling jealousy behind. Perhaps, he watches close her amorous eyes, And in the act of ogling does surprise, And thinks he sees upon her cheeks the while The dimpled tracks of some foregoing smile; His raging pulse beats thick, and his pent spirits boil. This is the product e'en of prosp'rous love; Think then what pangs disastrous passions prove; Innumerable ills; disdain, despair, With all the meagre family of care. Thus, as I said, 'tis better to prevent, Than flatter the disease, and late repent; Because to shun the allurement is not hard To minds resolved, forewarned, and well prepared; But wondrous difficult, when once beset, To struggle through the straits, and break the involving net. Yet, thus ensnared, thy freedom thou may'st gain, If, like a fool, thou dost not hug thy chain; If not to ruin obstinately blind, And wilfully endeavouring not to find Her plain defects of body and of mind. For thus the bedlam train of lovers use To enhance the value, and the faults excuse; And therefore 'tis no wonder if we see They dote on dowdies and deformity. Even what they cannot praise, they will not blame, But veil with some extenuating name. The sallow skin is for the swarthy put, And love can make a slattern of a slut; If cat-eyed, then a Pallas is their love; If freckled, she's a party-coloured dove; If little, then she's life and soul all o'er; An Amazon, the large two-handed whore. She stammers; oh, what grace in lisping lies! If she says nothing, to be sure she's wise. If shrill, and with a voice to drown a quire, Sharp-witted she must be, and full of fire; The lean, consumptive wench, with coughs decayed, Is called a pretty, tight, and slender maid; The o'ergrown, a goodly Ceres is exprest, A bed-fellow for Bacchus at the least; Flat-nose the name of Satyr never misses, And hanging blobber lips but pout for kisses. The task were endless all the rest to trace; Yet grant she were a Venus for her face And shape, yet others equal beauty share, And time was you could live without the fair; She does no more, in that for which you woo, Than homelier women full as well can do. Besides, she daubs, and stinks so much of paint, Her own attendants cannot bear the scent, But laugh behind, and bite their lips to hold. Meantime, excluded, and exposed to cold, The whining lover stands before the gates, And there with humble adoration waits; Crowning with flowers the threshold and the floor, And printing kisses on the obdurate door; Who, if admitted in that nick of time, If some unsavoury whiff betray the crime, Invents a quarrel straight, if there be none, Or makes some faint excuses to be gone; And calls himself a doting fool to serve, Ascribing more than woman can deserve. Which well they understand, like cunning queans, And hide their nastiness behind the scenes, From him they have allured, and would retain; But to a piercing eye 'tis all in vain: For common sense brings all their cheats to view, And the false light discovers by the true; Which a wise harlot owns, and hopes to find A pardon for defects, that run through all the kind. Nor always do they feign the sweets of love, When round the panting youth their pliant limbs they move, And cling, and heave, and moisten every kiss; They often share, and more than share the bliss: From every part, even to their inmost soul, They feel the trickling joys, and run with vigour to the goal. Stirred with the same impetuous desire, Birds, beasts, and herds, and mares, their males require; Because the throbbing nature in their veins Provokes them to assuage their kindly pains. The lusty leap the expecting female stands, By mutual heat compelled to mutual bands. Thus dogs with lolling tongues by love are tied, Nor shouting boys nor blows their union can divide; At either end they strive the link to loose, In vain, for stronger Venus holds the noose; Which never would those wretched lovers do, But that the common heats of love they know; The pleasure therefore must be shared in common too: And when the woman's more prevailing juice Sucks in the man's, the mixture will produce The mother's likeness; when the man prevails, His own resemblance in the seed he seals. But when we see the new-begotten race Reflect the features of each parent's face, Then of the father's and the mother's blood The justly tempered seed is understood; When both conspire, with equal ardour bent, From every limb the due proportion sent, When neither party foils, when neither foiled, This gives the splendid features of the child. Sometimes the boy the grandsire's image bears; Sometimes the more remote progenitor he shares; Because the genial atoms of the seed Lie long concealed ere they exert the breed; And, after sundry ages past, produce The tardy likeness of the latent juice. Hence, families such different figures take, And represent their ancestors in face, and hair, and make; Because of the same seed, the voice, and hair, And shape, and face, and other members are, And the same antique mould the likeness does prepare. Thus, oft the father's likeness does prevail In females, and the mother's in the male; For, since the seed is of a double kind, From that, where we the most resemblance find, We may conclude the strongest tincture sent, And that was in conception prevalent. Nor can the vain decrees of powers above Deny production to the act of love, Or hinder fathers of that happy name, Or with a barren womb the matron shame; As many think, who stain with victims' blood The mournful altars, and with incense load, To bless the showery seed with future life, And to impregnate the well-laboured wife. In vain they weary heaven with prayer, or fly To oracles, or magic numbers try; For barrenness of sexes will proceed Either from too condensed, or watery, seed: The watery juice too soon dissolves away, And in the parts projected will not stay; The too condensed, unsouled, unwieldy mass, Drops short, nor carries to the destined place; Nor pierces to the parts, nor, though injected home, Will mingle with the kindly moisture of the womb. For nuptials are unlike in their success; Some men with fruitful seed some women bless, And from some men some women fruitful are, Just as their constitutions join or jar: And many seeming barren wives have been, Who after, matched with more prolific men, Have filled a family with prattling boys; And many, not supplied at home with joys, Have found a friend abroad to ease their smart, And to perform the sapless husband's part. So much it does import, that seed with seed Should of the kindly mixture make the breed; And thick with thin, and thin with thick should join, So to produce and propagate the line. Of such concernment too is drink and food, To incrassate, or attenuate the blood. Of like importance is the posture too, In which the genial feat of love we do; For, as the females of the four-foot kind Receive the leapings of their males behind, So the good wives, with loins uplifted high, And leaning on their hands, the fruitful stroke may try: For in that posture will they best conceive; Not when, supinely laid, they frisk and heave; For active motions only break the blow, And more of strumpets than the wives they show, When, answering stroke with stroke, the mingled liquors flow. Endearments eager, and too brisk a bound, Throw off the plough-share from the furrowed ground; But common harlots in conjunction heave, Because 'tis less their business to conceive Than to delight, and to provoke the deed; A trick which honest wives but little need. Nor is it from the gods, or Cupid's dart, That many a homely woman takes the heart, But wives well-humoured, dutiful, and chaste, And clean, will hold their wandering husbands fast; Such are the links of love, and such a love will last. For what remains, long habitude, and use, Will kindness in domestic bands produce; For custom will a strong impression leave. Hard bodies, which the lightest stroke receive, In length of time will moulder and decay, And stones with drops of rain are washed away. FROM THE FIFTH BOOK OF LUCRETIUS. Tum porrò puer, etc. Thus, like a sailor by a tempest hurled Ashore, the babe is shipwrecked on the world. Naked he lies, and ready to expire, Helpless of all that human wants require; Exposed upon unhospitable earth, From the first moment of his hapless birth. Straight with foreboding cries he fills the room, Too true presages of his future doom. But flocks and herds, and every savage beast, By more indulgent nature are increased: They want no rattles for their froward mood, Nor nurse to reconcile them to their food, With broken words; nor winter blasts they fear, Nor change their habits with the changing year; Nor, for their safety, citadels prepare, Nor forge the wicked instruments of war; Unlaboured earth her bounteous treasure grants, And nature's lavish hand supplies their common wants. TRANSLATIONS FROM HORACE. THE THIRD ODE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE. INSCRIBED TO THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON, ON HIS INTENDED VOYAGE TO IRELAND. So may the auspicious queen of love, And the twin stars, the seed of Jove, And he who rules the raging wind, To thee, O sacred ship, be kind; And gentle breezes fill thy sails, Supplying soft Etesian gales: As thou, to whom the muse commends The best of poets and of friends, Dost thy committed pledge restore, And land him safely on the shore; And save the better part of me, From perishing with him at sea. Sure he, who first the passage tried, In hardened oak his heart did hide, And ribs of iron armed his side; Or his at least, in hollow wood, Who tempted first the briny flood; Nor feared the winds' contending roar, Nor billows beating on the shore, Nor Hyades portending rain, Nor all the tyrants of the main. What form of death could him affright, Who unconcerned, with steadfast sight, Could view the surges mounting steep, And monsters rolling in the deep! Could through the ranks of ruin go, With storms above, and rocks below! In vain did Nature's wise command Divide the waters from the land, If daring ships and men profane Invade the inviolable main; The eternal fences overleap, And pass at will the boundless deep. No toil, no hardship, can restrain Ambitious man, inured to pain; The more confined, the more he tries, And at forbidden quarry flies. Thus bold Prometheus did aspire, And stole from Heaven the seeds of fire, A train of ills, a ghastly crew, The robber's blazing track pursue; Fierce famine with her meagre face, And fevers of the fiery race, In swarms the offending wretch surround, All brooding on the blasted ground; And limping death, lashed on by fate, Comes up to shorten half our date. This made not Dædalus beware, With borrowed wings to sail in air; To hell Alcides forced his way, Plunged through the lake, and snatched the prey. Nay, scarce the gods, or heavenly climes, Are safe from our audacious crimes; We reach at Jove's imperial crown, And pull the unwilling thunder down. THE NINTH ODE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE. I Behold yon mountain's hoary height, Made higher with new mounts of snow; Again behold the winter's weight Oppress the labouring woods below; And streams, with icy fetters bound, Benumbed and crampt to solid ground. II With well-heaped logs dissolve the cold, And feed the genial hearth with fires; Produce the wine, that makes us bold, And sprightly wit and love inspires: For what hereafter shall betide, God, if 'tis worth his care, provide. III Let him alone, with what he made, To toss and turn the world below; At his command the storms invade, The winds by his commission blow; Till with a nod he bids them cease, And then the calm returns, and all is peace. IV To-morrow and her works defy, Lay hold upon the present hour, And snatch the pleasures passing by, To put them out of fortune's power: Nor love, nor love's delights, disdain; Whate'er thou gett'st to-day, is gain. V Secure those golden early joys, That youth unsoured with sorrow bears, Ere withering time the taste destroys, With sickness and unwieldy years. For active sports, for pleasing rest, This is the time to be possest; The best is but in season best. VI The appointed hour of promised bliss, The pleasing whisper in the dark, The half unwilling willing kiss, The laugh that guides thee to the mark; When the kind nymph would coyness feign, And hides but to be found again; These, these are joys the gods for youth ordain. THE TWENTY-NINTH ODE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE, PARAPHRASED IN PINDARIC VERSE, AND INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HON. LAURENCE, EARL OF ROCHESTER. I. Descended of an ancient line, That long the Tuscan sceptre swayed, Make haste to meet the generous wine, Whose piercing is for thee delayed: The rosy wreath is ready made, And artful hands prepare The fragrant Syrian oil, that shall perfume thy hair. II. When the wine sparkles from afar, And the well-natured friend cries, “Come away!” Make haste, and leave thy business and thy care, No mortal interest can be worth thy stay. III. Leave for a while thy costly country seat, And, to be great indeed, forget The nauseous pleasures of the great: Make haste and come; Come, and forsake thy cloying store; Thy turret, that surveys, from high, The smoke, and wealth, and noise of Rome, And all the busy pageantry That wise men scorn, and fools adore; Come, give thy soul a loose, and taste the pleasures of the poor. IV. Sometimes 'tis grateful to the rich to try A short vicissitude, and fit of poverty: A savoury dish, a homely treat, Where all is plain, where all is neat, Without the stately spacious room, The Persian carpet, or the Tyrian loom, Clear up the cloudy foreheads of the great. V. The sun is in the Lion mounted high; The Syrian star Barks from afar, And with his sultry breath infects the sky; The ground below is parched, the heavens above us fry: The shepherd drives his fainting flock Beneath the covert of a rock, And seeks refreshing rivulets nigh: The Sylvans to their shades retire, Those very shades and streams new shades and streams require, And want a cooling breeze of wind to fan the raging fire. VI. Thou, what befits the new Lord Mayor, And what the city factions dare, And what the Gallic arms will do, And what the quiver-bearing foe, Art anxiously inquisitive to know: But God has, wisely, hid from human sight The dark decrees of future fate, And sown their seeds in depth of night; He laughs at all the giddy turns of state, When mortals search too soon, and fear too late. VII. Enjoy the present smiling hour, And put it out of fortune's power; The tide of business, like the running stream, Is sometimes high, and sometimes low, A quiet ebb, or a tempestuous flow, And always in extreme. Now with a noiseless gentle course It keeps within the middle bed; Anon it lifts aloft the head, And bears down all before it with impetuous force: And trunks of trees come rolling down, Sheep and their folds together drown; Both house and homestead into seas are borne, And rocks are from their old foundations torn, And woods, made thin with winds, their scattered honours mourn. VIII. Happy the man, and he alone, He, who can call to-day his own; He who, secure within, can say, “To-morrow do thy worst, for I have lived today: Be fair, or foul, or rain, or shine, The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine; Not heaven itself upon the past has power, But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour.” IX. Fortune, that with malicious joy Does man, her slave, oppress, Proud of her office to destroy, Is seldom pleased to bless: Still various, and unconstant still, But with an inclination to be ill, Promotes, degrades, delights in strife, And makes a lottery of life. I can enjoy her while she's kind; But when she dances in the wind, And shakes the wings, and will not stay, I puff the prostitute away: The little or the much she gave, is quietly resigned; Content with poverty my soul I arm, And virtue, though in rags, will keep me warm. X. What is't to me, Who never sail in her unfaithful sea, If storms arise, and clouds grow black, If the mast split, and threaten wreck? Then let the greedy merchant fear For his ill-gotten gain; And pray to gods that will not hear, While the debating winds, and billows bear His wealth into the main. For me, secure from fortune's blows, Secure of what I cannot lose, In my small pinnace I can sail, Contemning all the blustering roar; And running with a merry gale, With friendly stars my safety seek, Within some little winding creek, And see the storm ashore. THE SECOND EPODE OF HORACE. “How happy in his low degree, How rich in humble poverty, is he, Who leads a quiet country life, Discharged of business, void of strife, And from the griping scrivener free? Thus, ere the seeds of vice were sown, Lived men in better ages born, Who ploughed, with oxen of their own, Their small paternal field of corn. Nor trumpets summon him to war, Nor drums disturb his morning sleep, Nor knows he merchants' gainful care, Nor fears the dangers of the deep. The clamours of contentious law, And court and state, he wisely shuns, Nor bribed with hopes, nor dared with awe, To servile salutations runs; But either to the clasping vine Does the supporting poplar wed, Or with his pruning-hook disjoin Unbearing branches from their head, And grafts more happy in their stead: Or, climbing to a hilly steep, He views his herds in vales afar, Or shears his overburthened sheep, Or mead for cooling drink prepares, Or virgin honey in the jars. Or in the now declining year, When bounteous autumn rears his head, He joys to pull the ripened pear, And clustering grapes with purple spread. The fairest of his fruit he serves, Priapus, thy rewards: Sylvanus too his part deserves, Whose care the fences guards. Sometimes beneath an ancient oak, Or on the matted grass he lies; No god of sleep he need invoke; The stream, that o'er the pebbles flies, With gentle slumber crowns his eyes. The wind, that whistles through the sprays, Maintains the concert of the song; And hidden birds, with native lays, The golden sleep prolong. But when the blast of winter blows, And hoary frost inverts the year, Into the naked woods he goes, And seeks the tusky boar to rear, With well-mouthed hounds and pointed spear: Or spreads his subtle nets from sight With twinkling glasses, to betray The larks that in the meshes light, Or makes the fearful hare his prey. Amidst his harmless easy joys No anxious care invades his health, Nor love his peace of mind destroys, Nor wicked avarice of wealth. But if a chaste and pleasing wife, To ease the business of his life, Divides with him his household care, Such as the Sabine matrons were, Such as the swift Apulian's bride, Sun-burnt and swarthy though she be, Will fire for winter nights provide, And without noise will oversee His children and his family, And order all things till he come, Sweaty and overlaboured, home; If she in pens his flocks will fold, And then produce her dairy store, With wine to drive away the cold, And unbought dainties of the poor; Not oysters of the Lucrine lake My sober appetite would wish, Nor turbot, or the foreign fish That rolling tempests overtake, And hither waft the costly dish. Not heath-pout, or the rarer bird, Which Phasis or Ionia yields, More pleasing morsels would afford Than the fat olives of my fields; Than shards or mallows for the pot, That keep the loosened body sound, Or than the lamb, that falls by lot To the just guardian of my ground. Amidst these feasts of happy swains, The jolly shepherd smiles to see His flock returning from the plains; The farmer is as pleased as he, To view his oxen sweating smoke, Hear on their necks the loosened yoke; To look upon his menial crew, That sit around his cheerful hearth, And bodies spent in toil renew With wholesome food and country mirth.” This Morecraft said within himself: Resolved to leave the wicked town, And live retired upon his own, He called his money in: But the prevailing love of pelf Soon split him on the former shelf;— He put it out again. TRANSLATIONS FROM HOMER. THE FIRST BOOK OF HOMER'S ILIAD. THE ARGUMENT. Chryses, priest of Apollo, brings presents to the Grecian princes, to ransom his daughter Chryseis, who was prisoner in the fleet. Agamemnon, the general, whose captive and mistress the young lady was, refuses to deliver her, threatens the venerable old man, and dismisses him with contumely. The priest craves vengeance of his God, who sends a plague among the Greeks; which occasions Achilles, their great champion, to summon a council of the chief officers: he encourages Calchas, the high priest and prophet, to tell the reason why the Gods were so much incensed against them. Calchas is fearful of provoking Agamemnon, till Achilles engages to protect him: then, emboldened by the hero, he accuses the general as the cause of all, by detaining the fair captive, and refusing the presents offered for her ransom. By this proceeding, Agamemnon is obliged, against his will, to restore Chryseis, with gifts, that he might appease the wrath of Phœbus; but, at the same time, to revenge himself on Achilles, sends to seize his slave Briseis. Achilles, thus affronted, complains to his mother Thetis; and begs her to revenge his injury, not only on the general, but on all the army, by giving victory to the Trojans, till the ungrateful king became sensible of his injustice. At the same time, he retires from the camp into his ships, and withdraws his aid from his countrymen. Thetis prefers her son's petition to Jupiter, who grants her suit. Juno suspects her errand, and quarrels with her husband for his grant; till Vulcan reconciles his parents with a bowl of nectar, and sends them peaceably to bed. The wrath of Peleus' son, O muse, resound, Whose dire effects the Grecian army found, And many a hero, king, and hardy knight, Were sent, in early youth, to shades of night: Their limbs a prey to dogs and vultures made; So was the sovereign will of Jove obeyed: From that ill-omened hour when strife begun, Betwixt Atrides great, and Thetis' godlike son. What power provoked, and for what cause, relate, Sowed in their breasts the seeds of stern debate: Jove's and Latona's son his wrath expressed, In vengeance of his violated priest, Against the king of men; who, swoln with pride, Refused his presents, and his prayers denied. For this the God a swift contagion spread Amid the camp, where heaps on heaps lay dead. For venerable Chryses came to buy, With gold and gifts of price, his daughter's liberty. Suppliant before the Grecian chiefs he stood, Awful, and armed with ensigns of his God: Bare was his hoary head; one holy hand Held forth his laurel crown, and one his sceptre of command. His suit was common; but above the rest, To both the brother-princes thus addressed:— “Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Grecian powers, So may the Gods, who dwell in heavenly bowers, Succeed your siege, accord the vows you make, And give you Troy's imperial town to take; So, by their happy conduct, may you come With conquest back to your sweet native home; As you receive the ransom which I bring, Respecting Jove, and the far-shooting king, And break my daughter's bonds, at my desire, And glad with her return her grieving sire.” With shouts of loud acclaim the Greeks decree To take the gifts, to set the damsel free. The king of men alone with fury burned, And haughty, these opprobrious words returned:— “Hence, holy dotard! and avoid my sight, Ere evil intercept thy tardy flight; Nor dare to tread this interdicted strand, Lest not that idle sceptre in thy hand, Nor thy god's crown, my vowed revenge withstand. Hence, on thy life! the captive maid is mine, Whom not for price or prayers I will resign; Mine she shall be, till creeping age and time Her bloom have withered, and consumed her prime. Till then my royal bed she shall attend, And, having first adorned it, late ascend; This, for the night; by day, the web and loom, And homely household-task, shall be her doom, Far from thy loved embrace, and her sweet native home.” He said: the helpless priest replied no more, But sped his steps along the hoarse-resounding shore. Silent he fled; secure at length he stood, Devoutly cursed his foes, and thus invoked his God:— “O source of sacred light, attend my prayer, God with the silver bow, and golden hair, Whom Chrysa, Cilla, Tenedos obeys, And whose broad eye their happy soil surveys! If, Smintheus, I have poured before thy shrine The blood of oxen, goats, and ruddy wine, And larded thighs on loaded altars laid, Hear, and my just revenge propitious aid! Pierce the proud Greeks, and with thy shafts attest How much thy power is injured in thy priest.” He prayed; and Phœbus, hearing, urged his flight, With fury kindled, from Olympus' height; His quiver o'er his ample shoulders threw, His bow twanged, and his arrows rattled as they flew. Black as a stormy night, he ranged around The tents, and compassed the devoted ground; Then with full force his deadly bow he bent, And feathered fates among the mules and sumpters sent, The essay of rage; on faithful dogs the next; And last, in human hearts his arrows fixed. The God nine days the Greeks at rovers killed, Nine days the camp with funeral fires was filled; The tenth, Achilles, by the queen's command, Who bears heaven's awful sceptre in her hand, A council summoned; for the goddess grieved Her favoured host should perish unrelieved. The kings, assembled, soon their chief inclose; Then from his seat the goddess-born arose, And thus undaunted spoke:—“What now remains, But that once more we tempt the watery plains, And, wandering homeward, seek our safety hence, In flight at least, if we can find defence? Such woes at once encompass us about, The plague within the camp, the sword without. Consult, O king, the prophets of the event; And whence these ills, and what the God's intent, Let them by dreams explore, for dreams from Jove are sent. What want of offered victims, what offence In fact committed could the Sun incense, To deal his deadly shafts? What may remove His settled hate, and reconcile his love? That he may look propitious on our toils, And hungry graves no more be glutted with our spoils.” Thus to the king of men the hero spoke, Then Calchas the desired occasion took; Calchas, the sacred seer, who had in view Things present and the past, and things to come foreknew; Supreme of augurs, who, by Phœbus taught, The Grecian powers to Troy's destruction brought. Skilled in the secret causes of their woes, The reverend priest in graceful act arose, And thus bespoke Pelides:—“Care of Jove, Favoured of all the immortal powers above, Wouldst thou the seeds deep sown of mischief know, And why, provoked, Apollo bends his bow, Plight first thy faith, inviolably true, To save me from those ills that may ensue. For I shall tell ungrateful truths to those, Whose boundless powers of life and death dispose; And sovereigns, ever jealous of their state, Forgive not those whom once they mark for hate: Even though the offence they seemingly digest, Revenge, like embers raked within their breast, Bursts forth in flames, whose unresisted power Will seize the unwary wretch, and soon devour. Such, and no less, is he, on whom depends The sum of things, and whom my tongue of force offends. Secure me then from his foreseen intent, That what his wrath may doom, thy valour may prevent.” To this the stern Achilles made reply:— “Be bold, (and on my plighted faith rely,) To speak what Phœbus has inspired thy soul For common good, and speak without control. His godhead I invoke; by him I swear, That while my nostrils draw this vital air, None shall presume to violate those bands, Or touch thy person with unhallowed hands; Even not the king of men, that all commands.” At this, resuming heart, the prophet said:— “Nor hecatomb unslain, nor vows unpaid, On Greeks accursed this dire contagion bring, Or call for vengeance from the bowyer king; But he the tyrant, whom none dares resist, Affronts the godhead in his injured priest; He keeps the damsel captive in his chain, And presents are refused, and prayers preferred in vain. For this the avenging power employs his darts, And empties all his quiver in our hearts; Thus will persist, relentless in his ire, Till the fair slave be rendered to her sire, And ransom-free restored to his abode, With sacrifice to reconcile the God; Then he, perhaps, atoned by prayer, may cease His vengeance justly vowed, and give the peace.” Thus having said, he sate:—Thus answered then, Upstarting from his throne, the king of men, His breast with fury filled, his eyes with fire, Which rolling round, he shot in sparkles on the sire: “Augur of ill, whose tongue was never found Without a priestly curse, or boding sound! For not one blessed event foretold to me Passed through that mouth, or passed unwillingly; And now thou dost with lies the throne invade, By practice hardened in thy slandering trade; Obtending heaven, for whate'er ills befall, And sputtering under specious names thy gall. Now Phœbus is provoked, his rites and laws Are in his priest profaned, and I the cause; Since I detain a slave, my sovereign prize, And sacred gold, your idol-god, despise. I love her well; and well her merits claim, To stand preferred before my Grecian dame: Not Clytemnestra's self in beauty's bloom More charmed, or better plied the various loom: Mine is the maid, and brought in happy hour, With every household-grace adorned, to bless my nuptial bower. Yet shall she be restored, since public good For private interest ought not to be withstood, To save the effusion of my people's blood. But right requires, if I resign my own, I should not suffer for your sakes alone; Alone excluded from the prize I gained, And by your common suffrage have obtained. The slave without a ransom shall be sent, It rests for you to make the equivalent.” To this the fierce Thessalian prince replied:— “O first in power, but passing all in pride, Griping, and still tenacious of thy hold, Wouldst thou the Grecian chiefs, though largely souled, Should give the prizes they had gained before, And with their loss thy sacrilege restore? Whate'er by force of arms the soldier got, Is each his own, by dividend of lot; Which to resume were both unjust and base, Not to be borne but by a servile race. But this we can; if Saturn's son bestows The sack of Troy, which he by promise owes, Then shall the conquering Greeks thy loss restore, And with large interest make the advantage more.” To this Atrides answered:—“Though thy boast Assumes the foremost name of all our host, Pretend not, mighty man, that what is mine, Controlled by thee, I tamely should resign. Shall I release the prize I gained by right, In taken towns, and many a bloody fight, While thou detain'st Briseis in thy bands, By priestly glossing on the God's commands? Resolve on this, (a short alternative,) Quit mine, or, in exchange, another give; Else I, assure thy soul, by sovereign right Will seize thy captive in thy own despite; Or from stout Ajax, or Ulysses, bear What other prize my fancy shall prefer: Then softly murmur, or aloud complain, Rage as you please, you shall resist in vain. But more of this, in proper time and place; To things of greater moment let us pass. A ship to sail the sacred seas prepare, Proud in her trim, and put on board the fair, With sacrifice and gifts, and all the pomp of prayer. The crew well chosen, the command shall be In Ajax; or if other I decree, In Creta's king, or Ithacus, or, if I please, in thee: Most fit thyself to see performed the intent, For which my prisoner from my sight is sent, (Thanks to thy pious care,) that Phœbus may relent.” At this Achilles rolled his furious eyes, Fixed on the king askant, and thus replies:— “O, impudent, regardful of thy own, Whose thoughts are centred on thyself alone, Advanced to sovereign sway for better ends Than thus like abject slaves to treat thy friends! What Greek is he, that, urged by command, Against the Trojan troops will lift his hand? Not I; nor such enforced respect I owe, Nor Pergamus I hate, nor Priam is my foe. What wrong from Troy remote could I sustain, To leave my fruitful soil and happy reign, And plough the surges of the stormy main? Thee, frontless man, we followed from afar, Thy instruments of death, and tools of war. Thine is the triumph; ours the toil alone; We bear thee on our backs, and mount thee on the throne. For thee we fall in fight; for thee redress Thy baffled brother,—not the wrongs of Greece. And now thou threaten'st, with unjust decree, To punish thy affronting heaven on me; To seize the prize which I so dearly bought, By common suffrage given, confirmed by lot. Mean match to thine; for, still above the rest, Thy hooked rapacious hands usurp the best; Though mine are first in fight, to force the prey, And last sustain the labours of the day. Nor grudge I thee the much the Grecians give, Nor murmuring take the little I receive; Yet even this little, thou, who wouldst ingross The whole, insatiate, enviest as thy loss. Know, then, for Phthia fixed is my return; Better at home my ill-paid pains to mourn, Than from an equal here sustain the public scorn.” The king, whose brows with shining gold were bound, Who saw his throne with sceptred slaves encompassed round, Thus answered stern:—“Go, at thy pleasure, go; We need not such a friend, nor fear we such a foe. There will not want to follow me in fight; Jove will assist, and Jove assert my right: But thou of all the kings (his care below) Art least at my command, and most my foe. Debates, dissensions, uproars are thy joy; Provoked without offence, and practised to destroy. Strength is of brutes, and not thy boast alone; At least 'tis lent from heaven, and not thy own. Fly then, ill-mannered, to thy native land, And there thy ant-born Myrmidons command. But mark this menace; since I must resign My black-eyed maid, to please the Powers divine; A well-rigged vessel in the port attends, Manned at my charge, commanded by my friends; The ship shall waft her to her wished abode, Full fraught with holy bribes to the far-shooting God. This thus despatched, I owe myself the care, My fame and injured honour to repair; From thy own tent, proud man, in thy despite, This hand shall ravish thy pretended right. Briseis shall be mine, and thou shalt see What odds of awful power I have on thee, That others at thy cost may learn the difference of degree.” At this the impatient hero sourly smiled; His heart impetuous in his bosom boiled, And, jostled by two tides of equal sway, Stood for a while suspended in his way. Betwixt his reason and his rage untamed, One whispered soft, and one aloud reclaimed; That only counselled to the safer side, This to the sword his ready hand applied. Unpunished to support the affront was hard, Nor easy was the attempt to force the guard; But soon the thirst of vengeance fired his blood, Half shone his falchion, and half sheathed it stood. In that nice moment, Pallas, from above, Commissioned by the imperial wife of Jove, Descended swift; (the white-armed Queen was loath The fight should follow, for she favoured both;) Just as in act he stood, in clouds enshrined, Her hand she fastened on his hair behind; Then backward by his yellow curls she drew; To him, and him alone, confessed in view. Tamed by superior force, he turned his eyes, Aghast at first, and stupid with surprise; But by her sparkling eyes, and ardent look, The virgin-warrior known, he thus bespoke:— “Com'st thou, Celestial, to behold my wrongs? To view the vengeance which to crimes belongs?” Thus he.—The blue-eyed Goddess thus rejoined:— “I come to calm thy turbulence of mind, If reason will resume her sovereign sway, And, sent by Juno, her commands obey. Equal she loves you both, and I protect; Then give thy guardian Gods their due respect, And cease contention; be thy words severe, Sharp as he merits; but the sword forbear. An hour unhoped already wings her way, When he his dire affront shall dearly pay; When the proud king shall sue, with treble gain, To quit thy loss, and conquer thy disdain. But thou, secure of my unfailing word, Compose thy swelling soul, and sheathe the sword.” The youth thus answered mild:—“Auspicious maid, Heaven's will be mine, and your commands obeyed. The Gods are just, and when, subduing sense, We serve their Powers, provide the recompense.” He said; with surly faith believed her word, And in the sheath, reluctant, plunged the sword. Her message done, she mounts the blessed abodes, And mixed among the senate of the Gods. At her departure his disdain returned; The fire she fanned with greater fury burned, Rumbling within till thus it found a vent:— “Dastard and drunkard, mean and insolent! Tongue-valiant hero, vaunter of thy might, In threats the foremost, but the lag in fight! When didst thou thrust amid the mingled preace, Content to bide the war aloof in peace? Arms are the trade of each plebeian soul; 'Tis death to fight, but kingly to control; Lord-like at ease, with arbitrary power, To peel the chiefs, the people to devour. These, traitor, are thy talents; safer far Than to contend in fields, and toils of war. Nor couldst thou thus have dared the common hate, Were not their souls as abject as their state. But, by this sceptre solemnly I swear, (Which never more green leaf or growing branch shall bear; Torn from the tree, and given by Jove to those Who laws dispense, and mighty wrongs oppose,) That when the Grecians want my wonted aid, No gift shall bribe it, and no prayer persuade. When Hector comes, the homicide, to wield His conquering arms, with corpse to strew the field, Then shalt thou mourn thy pride, and late confess My wrong, repented when 'tis past redress.” He said; and with disdain, in open view, Against the ground his golden sceptre threw, Then sate; with boiling rage Atrides burned, And foam betwixt his gnashing grinders churned. But from his seat the Pylian prince arose, With reasoning mild, their madness to compose; Words, sweet as honey, from his mouth distilled; Two centuries already he fulfilled, And now began the third; unbroken yet, Once famed for courage, still in council great. “What worse,” he said, “can Argos undergo, What can more gratify the Phrygian foe, Than these distempered heats, if both the lights Of Greece their private interest disunites? Believe a friend, with thrice your years increased, And let these youthful passions be repressed. I flourished long before your birth; and then Lived equal with a race of braver men, Than these dim eyes shall e'er behold again. Ceneus and Dryas, and, excelling them, Great Theseus, and the force of greater Polypheme. With these I went, a brother of the war, Their dangers to divide, their fame to share; Nor idle stood with unassisting hands, When savage beasts, and men's more savage bands, Their virtuous toil subdued: yet those I swayed, With powerful speech; I spoke, and they obeyed. If such as those my counsels could reclaim, Think not, young warriors, your diminished name Shall lose of lustre, by subjecting rage To the cool dictates of experienced age. Thou, king of men, stretch not thy sovereign sway Beyond the bounds free subjects can obey; But let Pelides in his prize rejoice, Achieved in arms, allowed by public voice. Nor thou, brave champion, with his power contend, Before whose throne even kings their lowered sceptres bend; The head of action he, and thou the hand, Matchless thy force, but mightier his command. Thou first, O king, release the rights of sway; Power, self-restrained, the people best obey. Sanctions of law from thee derive their source; Command thyself, whom no commands can force. The son of Thetis, rampire of our host, Is worth our care to keep, nor shall my prayers be lost.” Thus Nestor said, and ceased.—Atrides broke His silence next, but pondered ere he spoke:— “Wise are thy words, and glad I would obey, But this proud man affects imperial sway, Controlling kings, and trampling on our state; His will is law, and what he wills is fate. The Gods have given him strength; but whence the style Of lawless power assumed, or licence to revile?” Achilles cut him short, and thus replied:— “My worth, allowed in words, is, in effect, denied; For who but a poltroon, possessed with fear, Such haughty insolence can tamely bear? Command thy slaves; my freeborn soul disdains A tyrant's curb, and, restiff, breaks the reins. Take this along, that no dispute shall rise (Though mine the woman) for my ravished prize; But, she excepted, as unworthy strife, Dare not, I charge thee dare not, on thy life, Touch aught of mine beside, by lot my due, But stand aloof, and think profane to view; This falchion else, not hitherto withstood, These hostile fields shall fatten with thy blood.” He said, and rose the first; the council broke, And all their grave consults dissolved in smoke, The royal youth retired, on vengeance bent; Patroclus followed silent to his tent. Meantime, the king with gifts a vessel stores, Supplies the banks with twenty chosen oars; And next, to reconcile the shooter God, Within her hollow sides the sacrifice he stowed; Chryseis last was set on board, whose hand Ulysses took, intrusted with command; They plough the liquid seas, and leave the lessening land. Atrides then, his outward zeal to boast, Bade purify the sin-polluted host. With perfect hecatombs the God they graced, Whose offered entrails in the main were cast; Black bulls and bearded goats on altars lie, And clouds of savoury stench involve the sky. These pomps the royal hypocrite designed For show, but harboured vengeance in his mind; Till holy malice, longing for a vent, At length discovered his concealed intent. Talthybius, and Eurybates the just, Heralds of arms, and ministers of trust, He called, and thus bespoke:—“Haste hence your way, And from the Goddess-born demand his prey. If yielded, bring the captive; if denied, The king (so tell him) shall chastise his pride, And with armed multitudes in person come To vindicate his power, and justify his doom.” This hard command unwilling they obey, And o'er the barren shore pursue their way, Where quartered in their camp the fierce Thessalians lay. Their sovereign seated on his chair they find, His pensive cheek upon his hand reclined, And anxious thoughts revolving in his mind. With gloomy looks he saw them entering in Without salute; nor durst they first begin, Fearful of rash offence and death foreseen. He soon, the cause divining, cleared his brow, And thus did liberty of speech allow:— “Interpreters of Gods and men, be bold; Awful your character, and uncontrolled: Howe'er unpleasing be the news you bring, I blame not you, but your imperious king. You come, I know, my captive to demand; Patroclus, give her to the herald's hand, But you authentic witnesses I bring Before the Gods, and your ungrateful king, Of this my manifest, that never more This hand shall combat on the crooked shore: No; let the Grecian powers, oppressed in fight, Unpitied perish in their tyrant's sight. Blind of the future, and by rage misled, He pulls his crimes upon his people's head; Forced from the field in trenches to contend, And his insulted camp from foes defend.” He said, and soon, obeying his intent, Patroclus brought Briseis from her tent, Then to the intrusted messengers resigned: She wept, and often cast her eyes behind. Forced from the man she loved, they led her thence, Along the shore, a prisoner to their prince. Sole on the barren sands the suffering chief Roared out for anguish, and indulged his grief; Cast on his kindred seas a stormy look, And his upbraided mother thus bespoke:— “Unhappy parent of a short-lived son,— Since Jove in pity by thy prayers was won To grace my small remains of breath with fame, Why loads he this embittered life with shame, Suffering his king of men to force my slave, Whom, well deserved in war, the Grecians gave?” Set by old Ocean's side the Goddess heard, Then from the sacred deep her head she reared; Rose like a morning mist, and thus begun To soothe the sorrows of her plaintive son:— “Why cries my care, and why conceals his smart? Let thy afflicted parent share her part.” Then, sighing from the bottom of his breast, To the Sea-Goddess thus the Goddess-born addressed:— “Thou know'st my pain, which telling but recalls; By force of arms we rased the Theban walls; The ransacked city, taken by our toils, We left, and hither brought the golden spoils: Equal we shared them; but before the rest, The proud prerogative had seized the best. Chryseis was the greedy tyrant's prize, Chryseis, rosy-cheeked, with charming eyes. Her sire, Apollo's priest, arrived to buy, With proffered gifts of price, his daughter's liberty. Suppliant before the Grecian chiefs he stood, Awful, and armed with ensigns of his God; Bare was his hoary head; one holy hand Held forth his laurel crown, and one his sceptre of command. His suit was common, but, above the rest, To both the brother-princes was addressed. With shouts of loud acclaim the Greeks agree To take the gifts, to set the prisoner free. Not so the tyrant, who with scorn the priest Received, and with opprobrious words dismissed. The good old man, forlorn of human aid, For vengeance to his heavenly patron prayed: The Godhead gave a favourable ear, And granted all to him he held so dear; In an ill hour his piercing shafts he sped, And heaps on heaps of slaughtered Greeks lay dead, While round the camp he ranged: at length arose A seer, who well divined, and durst disclose The source of all our ills: I took the word; And urged the sacred slave to be restored, The God appeased: the swelling monarch stormed, And then the vengeance vowed he since performed. The Greeks, 'tis true, their ruin to prevent, Have to the royal priest his daughter sent; But from their haughty king his heralds came, And seized, by his command, my captive dame, By common suffrage given;—but thou be won, If in thy power, to avenge thy injured son! Ascend the skies, and supplicating move Thy just complaint to cloud-compelling Jove. If thou by either word or deed hast wrought A kind remembrance in his grateful thought, Urge him by that; for often hast thou said Thy power was once not useless in his aid, When he, who high above the highest reigns, Surprised by traitor Gods, was bound in chains; When Juno, Pallas, with ambition fired, And his blue brother of the seas conspired, Thou freed'st the sovereign from unworthy bands, Thou brought'st Briareus with his hundred hands, (So called in heaven, but mortal men below By his terrestrial name, Ægeon, know; Twice stronger than his sire, who sate above Assessor to the throne of thundering Jove.) The gods, dismayed at his approach, withdrew, Nor durst their unaccomplished crime pursue. That action to his grateful mind recall, Embrace his knees, and at his footstool fall; That now, if ever, he will aid our foes; Let Troy's triumphant troops the camp inclose; Ours, beaten to the shore, the siege forsake, And what their king deserves, with him partake; That the proud tyrant, at his proper cost, May learn the value of the man he lost.” To whom the Mother-goddess thus replied, Sighed ere she spoke, and while she spoke she cried: “Ah, wretched me! by fates averse decreed To bring thee forth with pain, with care to breed! Did envious heaven not otherwise ordain, Safe in thy hollow ships thou shouldst remain, Nor ever tempt the fatal field again; But now thy planet sheds his poisonous rays, And short and full of sorrow are thy days. For what remains, to heaven I will ascend, And at the Thunderer's throne thy suit commend. Till then, secure in ships, abstain from fight; Indulge thy grief in tears, and vent thy spite. For yesterday the court of heaven with Jove Removed; 'tis dead vacation now above. Twelve days the Gods their solemn revels keep, And quaff with blameless Ethiops in the deep. Returned from thence, to heaven my flight I take, Knock at the brazen gates, and Providence awake; Embrace his knees, and suppliant to the sire, Doubt not I will obtain the grant of thy desire.” She said, and, parting, left him on the place, Swoln with disdain, resenting his disgrace; Revengeful thoughts revolving in his mind, He wept for anger, and for love he pined. Meantime, with prosperous gales Ulysses brought The slave, and ship, with sacrifices fraught, To Chrysa's port; where, entering with the tide, He dropped his anchors, and his oars he plied, Furled every sail, and, drawing down the mast, His vessel moored, and made with hawsers fast. Descending on the plain, ashore they bring The hecatomb, to please the shooter king. The dame before an altar's holy fire Ulysses led, and thus bespoke her sire:— “Reverenced be thou, and be thy God adored! The king of men thy daughter has restored, And sent by me with presents and with prayer. He recommends him to thy pious care, That Phœbus at thy suit his wrath may cease, And give the penitent offenders peace.” He said, and gave her to her father's hands, Who glad received her, free from servile bands. This done, in order they, with sober grace, Their gifts around the well-built altar place. Then washed, and took the cakes, while Chryses stood With hands upheld, and thus invoked his God:— “God of the silver bow, whose eyes survey The sacred Cilla! thou, whose awful sway Chrysa the blessed, and Tenedos obey! Now hear, as thou before my prayer hast heard, Against the Grecians, and their prince, preferred. Once thou hast honoured, honour once again Thy priest, nor let his second vows be vain; But from the afflicted host and humble prince Avert thy wrath, and cease thy pestilence!” Apollo heard, and, conquering his disdain, Unbent his bow, and Greece respired again. Now when the solemn rites of prayer were past, Their salted cakes on crackling flames they cast; Then, turning back, the sacrifice they sped, The fatted oxen slew, and flayed the dead; Chopped off their nervous thighs, and next prepared To involve the lean in cauls, and mend with lard. Sweetbreads and collops were with skewers pricked About the sides, imbibing what they decked. The priest with holy hands was seen to tine The cloven wood, and pour the ruddy wine. The youth approached the fire, and, as it burned, On five sharp broachers ranked, the roast they turned; These morsels stayed their stomachs, then the rest They cut in legs and fillets for the feast; Which drawn and served, their hunger they appease With savoury meat, and set their minds at ease. Now when the rage of eating was repelled, The boys with generous wine the goblets filled: The first libations to the gods they pour, And then with songs indulge the genial hour. Holy debauch! till day to night they bring, With hymns and pæans to the bowyer king. At sunset to their ships they make return, And snore secure on decks till rosy morn. The skies with dawning day were purpled o'er; Awaked, with labouring oars they leave the shore; The Power appeased, with wind sufficed the sail, The bellying canvas strutted with the gale; The waves indignant roar with surly pride, And press against the sides, and, beaten off, divide. They cut the foamy way, with force impelled Superior, till the Trojan port they held; Then, hauling on the strand, their galley moor, And pitch their tents along the crooked shore. Meantime the goddess-born in secret pined, Nor visited the camp, nor in the council joined; But, keeping close, his gnawing heart he fed With hopes of vengeance on the tyrant's head; And wished for bloody wars and mortal wounds, And of the Greeks oppressed in fight to hear the dying sounds. Now when twelve days complete had run their race, The gods bethought them of the cares belonging to their place. Jove at their head ascending from the sea, A shoal of puny Powers attend his way. Then Thetis, not unmindful of her son, Emerging from the deep to beg her boon, Pursued their track, and wakened from his rest, Before the sovereign stood, a morning guest. Him in the circle, but apart, she found; The rest at awful distance stood around. She bowed, and, ere she durst her suit begin, One hand embraced his knees, one propped his chin; Then thus:—“If I, celestial sire, in aught Have served thy will, or gratified thy thought, One glimpse of glory to my issue give, Graced for the little time he has to live! Dishonoured by the king of men he stands; His rightful prize is ravished from his hands. But thou, O father, in my son's defence, Assume thy power, assert thy providence. Let Troy prevail, till Greece the affront has paid With doubled honours, and redeemed his aid.” She ceased; but the considering God was mute, Till she, resolved to win, renewed her suit, Nor loosed her hold, but forced him to reply:— “Or grant me my petition, or deny; Jove cannot fear; then tell me to my face That I, of all the gods, am least in grace. This I can bear.” The cloud-compeller mourned, And, sighing first, this answer he returned:— “Know'st thou what clamours will disturb my reign, What my stunned ears from Juno must sustain? In council she gives licence to her tongue, Loquacious, brawling, ever in the wrong; And now she will my partial power upbraid, If, alienate from Greece, I give the Trojans aid. But thou depart, and shun her jealous sight, The care be mine to do Pelides right. Go then, and on the faith of Jove rely, When, nodding to thy suit, he bows the sky. This ratifies the irrevocable doom; The sign ordained, that what I will shall come; The stamp of heaven, and seal of fate.” He said, And shook the sacred honours of his head: With terror trembled heaven's subsiding hill, And from his shaken curls ambrosial dews distil. The Goddess goes exulting from his sight, And seeks the seas profound, and leaves the realms of light. He moves into his hall; the Powers resort, Each from his house, to fill the sovereign's court; Nor waiting summons, nor expecting stood, But met with reverence, and received the God. He mounts the throne; and Juno took her place, But sullen discontent sate lowering on her face. With jealous eyes, at distance she had seen, Whispering with Jove, the silver-footed queen; Then, impotent of tongue, her silence broke, Thus turbulent, in rattling tone, she spoke:— “Author of ills, and close contriver Jove, Which of thy dames, what prostitute of love, Has held thy ear so long, and begged so hard, For some old service done, some new reward? Apart you talked, for that's your special care; The consort never must the council share. One gracious word is for a wife too much; Such is a marriage vow, and Jove's own faith is such.” Then thus the sire of Gods, and men below:— “What I have hidden, hope not thou to know. Even goddesses are women; and no wife Has power to regulate her husband's life. Counsel she may; and I will give thy ear The knowledge first of what is fit to hear. What I transact with others, or alone, Beware to learn, nor press too near the throne.” To whom the Goddess, with the charming eyes:— “What hast thou said, O tyrant of the skies! When did I search the secrets of thy reign, Though privileged to know, but privileged in vain? But well thou dost, to hide from common sight Thy close intrigues, too bad to bear the light. Nor doubt I, but the silver-footed dame, Tripping from sea, on such an errand came, To grace her issue at the Grecians' cost, And, for one peevish man, destroy an host.” To whom the Thunderer made this stern reply:— “My household curse! my lawful plague! the spy Of Jove's designs! his other squinting eye! Why this vain prying, and for what avail? Jove will be master still, and Juno fail. Should thy suspicious thoughts divine aright, Thou but becom'st more odious to my sight For this attempt; uneasy life to me, Still watched and importuned, but worse for thee. Curb that impetuous tongue, before too late The Gods behold, and tremble at thy fate; Pitying, but daring not, in thy defence, To lift a hand against Omnipotence.” This heard, the imperious queen sate mute with fear, Nor further durst incense the gloomy Thunderer: Silence was in the court at this rebuke; Nor could the Gods abashed sustain their sovereign's look. The limping Smith observed the saddened feast, And, hopping here and there, himself a jest, Put in his word, that neither might offend, To Jove obsequious, yet his mother's friend. “What end in heaven will be of civil war, If Gods of pleasure will for mortals jar? Such discord but disturbs our jovial feast; One grain of bad embitters all the best. Mother, though wise yourself, my counsel weigh; 'Tis much unsafe my sire to disobey; Not only you provoke him to your cost, But mirth is marred, and the good cheer is lost. Tempt not his heavy hand, for he has power To throw you headlong from his heavenly tower; But one submissive word, which you let fall, Will make him in good humour with us all.” He said no more, but crowned a bowl unbid, The laughing nectar overlooked the lid; Then put it to her hand, and thus pursued:— “This cursed quarrel be no more renewed: Be, as becomes a wife, obedient still; Though grieved, yet subject to her husband's will. I would not see you beaten; yet afraid Of Jove's superior force, I dare not aid. Too well I know him, since that hapless hour When I, and all the Gods, employed our power To break your bonds; me by the heel he drew, And o'er heaven's battlements with fury threw. All day I fell; my flight at morn begun, And ended not but with the setting sun. Pitched on my head, at length the Lemnian ground Received my battered skull, the Sinthians healed my wound.” At Vulcan's homely mirth his mother smiled, And, smiling, took the cup the clown had filled. The reconciler-bowl went round the board, Which, emptied, the rude skinker still restored. Loud fits of laughter seized the guests, to see The limping God so deft at his new ministry. The feast continued till declining light; They drank, they laughed, they loved, and then 'twas night. Nor wanted tuneful harp, nor vocal quire, The Muses sung, Apollo touched the lyre. Drunken at last, and drowsy, they depart Each to his house, adorned with laboured art Of the lame architect. The thundering God, Even he, withdrew to rest, and had his load; His swimming head to needful sleep applied, And Juno lay unheeded by his side. THE LAST PARTING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE. FROM THE SIXTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD. THE ARGUMENT. Hector returning from the field of battle, to visit Helen, his sister-in-law, and his brother Paris, who had fought unsuccessfully, hand to hand with Menelaus, from thence goes to his own palace to see his wife Andromache, and his infant son Astyanax. The description of that interview is the subject of this translation. Thus having said, brave Hector went to see His virtuous wife, the fair Andromache. He found her not at home; for she was gone, Attended by her maid and infant son, To climb the steepy tower of Ilion; From whence, with heavy heart, she might survey The bloody business of the dreadful day. Her mournful eyes she cast around the plain, And sought the lord of her desires in vain. But he, who thought his peopled palace bare, When she, his only comfort, was not there, Stood in the gate, and asked of every one, Which way she took, and whither she was gone; If to the court, or with his mother's train, In long procession to Minerva's fane? The servants answered,—Neither to the court, Where Priam's sons and daughters did resort; Nor to the temple was she gone, to move With prayers the blue-eyed progeny of Jove; But more solicitous for him alone, Than all their safety, to the tower was gone, There to survey the labours of the field, Where the Greeks conquer, and the Trojans yield; Swiftly she passed, with fear and fury wild; The nurse went lagging after with the child. This heard, the noble Hector made no stay, The admiring throng divide to give him way; He passed through every street, by which he came, And at the gate he met the mournful dame. His wife beheld him; and, with eager pace, Flew to his arms, to meet a dear embrace. His wife, who brought in dower Cilicia's crown, And in herself a greater dower alone; Ætion's heir, who, on the woody plain Of Hippoplacus, did in Thebé reign. Breathless she flew, with joy and passion wild; The nurse came lagging after with her child. The royal babe upon her breast was laid, Who, like the morning star, his beams displayed. Scamandrius was his name, which Hector gave, From that fair flood which Ilion's wall did lave; But him Astyanax the Trojans call, From his great father who defends the wall. Hector beheld him with a silent smile, His tender wife stood weeping by the while; Pressed in her own, his warlike hand she took, Then sighed, and thus prophetically spoke:— “Thy dauntless heart, which I foresee too late, Too daring man, will urge thee to thy fate. Nor dost thou pity, with a parent's mind, This helpless orphan, whom thou leav'st behind; Nor me, the unhappy partner of thy bed, Who must in triumph by the Greeks be led. They seek thy life; and, in unequal fight With many, will oppress thy single might. Better it were for miserable me To die, before the fate which I foresee; For, ah! what comfort can the world bequeath To Hector's widow, after Hector's death! Eternal sorrow and perpetual tears Began my youth, and will conclude my years; I have no parents, friends, nor brothers left, By stern Achilles all of life bereft. Then, when the walls of Thebes he overthrew, His fatal hand my royal father slew; He slew Ætion, but despoiled him not, Nor in his hate the funeral rites forgot; Armed as he was he sent him whole below, And reverenced thus the manes of his foe. A tomb he raised; the mountain-nymphs around Inclosed, with planted elms, the holy ground. My seven brave brothers, in one fatal day, To death's dark mansions took the mournful way; Slain by the same Achilles, while they keep The bellowing oxen, and the bleating sheep. My mother, who the royal sceptre swayed, Was captive to the cruel victor made, And hither led; but, hence redeemed with gold, Her native country did again behold, And but beheld; for soon Diana's dart, In an unhappy chase, transfixed her heart. “But thou, my Hector, art thyself alone My parents, brothers, and my lord, in one. O kill not all my kindred o'er again, Nor tempt the dangers of the dusty plain, But in this tower, for our defence, remain. Thy wife and son are in thy ruin lost; This is a husband's and a father's post. The Scæan gate commands the plains below; Here marshal all thy soldiers as they go; And hence, with other hands, repel the foe. By yon wild fig-tree lies their chief ascent, And thither all their powers are daily bent. The two Ajaces have I often seen, And the wronged husband of the Spartan queen; With him his greater brother; and, with these, Fierce Diomede, and bold Meriones; Uncertain if by augury, or chance, But by this easy rise they all advance; Guard well that pass, secure of all beside.” To whom the noble Hector thus replied:— “That and the rest are in my daily care; But, should I shun the dangers of the war, With scorn the Trojans would reward my pains, And their proud ladies, with their sweeping trains; The Grecian swords and lances I can bear, But loss of honour is my only fear. Shall Hector, born to war, his birthright yield, Belie his courage, and forsake the field? Early in rugged arms I took delight, And still have been the foremost in the fight; With dangers dearly have I bought renown, And am the champion of my father's crown. And yet my mind forebodes, with sure presage, That Troy shall perish by the Grecian rage: The fatal day draws on, when I must fall, And universal ruin cover all. Not Troy itself, though built by hands divine, Nor Priam, nor his people, nor his line, My mother, nor my brothers of renown, Whose valour yet defends the unhappy town,— Not these, nor all their fates which I foresee, Are half of that concern I have for thee. I see, I see thee, in that fatal hour, Subjected to the victor's cruel power; Led hence a slave to some insulting sword, Forlorn, and trembling at a foreign lord; A spectacle in Argos, at the loom, Gracing with Trojan fights, a Grecian room; Or from deep wells the living stream to take, And on thy weary shoulders bring it back. While, groaning under this laborious life, They insolently call thee Hector's wife; Upbraid thy bondage with thy husband's name, And from my glory propagate thy shame. This when they say, thy sorrows will increase With anxious thoughts of former happiness; That he is dead who could thy wrongs redress. But I, oppressed with iron sleep before, Shall hear thy unavailing cries no more.” He said; Then, holding forth his arms, he took his boy, The pledge of love and other hope of Troy. The fearful infant turned his head away, And on his nurse's neck reclining lay, His unknown father shunning with affright, And looking back on so uncouth a sight; Daunted to see a face with steel o'erspread, And his high plume that nodded o'er his head. His sire and mother smiled with silent joy, And Hector hastened to relieve his boy; Dismissed his burnished helm, that shone afar, The pride of warriors, and the pomp of war; The illustrious babe, thus reconciled, he took, Hugged in his arms, and kissed, and thus he spoke:— “Parent of Gods and men, propitious Jove! And you, bright synod of the powers above! On this my son your gracious gifts bestow; Grant him to live, and great in arms to grow, To reign in Troy, to govern with renown, To shield the people, and assert the crown; That, when hereafter he from war shall come, And bring his Trojans peace and triumph home, Some aged man, who lives this act to see, And who, in former times, remembered me, May say, the son, in fortitude and fame, Outgoes the mark, and drowns his father's name: That, at these words, his mother may rejoice, And add her suffrage to the public voice.” Thus having said; He first, with suppliant hands, the Gods adored; Then to the mother's arms the child restored. With tears and smiles she took her son, and pressed The illustrious infant to her fragrant breast. He, wiping her fair eyes, indulged her grief, And eased her sorrows with this last relief:— “My wife and mistress, drive thy fears away, Nor give so bad an omen to the day; Think not it lies in any Grecian's power To take my life, before the fatal hour. When that arrives, nor good nor bad can fly The irrevocable doom of destiny. Return; and, to divert thy thoughts at home, There task thy maids, and exercise the loom, Employed in works that womanhood become. The toils of war, and feats of chivalry Belong to men; and, most of all, to me.” At this, for new replies he did not stay, But laced his crested helm, and strode away. His lovely consort to her house returned, And, looking often back, in silence mourned. Home when she came, her secret woe she vents, And fills the palace with her loud laments; Those loud laments her echoing maids restore, And Hector, yet alive, as dead deplore.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. XIII. TRANSLATIONS FROM JUVENAL. THE FIRST SATIRE OF JUVENAL. THE ARGUMENT. The Poet gives us first a kind of humorous reason for his writing: that being provoked by hearing so many ill poets rehearse their works, he does himself justice on them, by giving them as bad as they bring. But since no man will rank himself with ill writers, it is easy to conclude, that if such wretches could draw an audience, he thought it no hard matter to excel them, and gain a greater esteem with the public. Next, he informs us more openly, why he rather addicts himself to satire than any other kind of poetry. And here he discovers that it is not so much his indignation to ill poets as to ill men, which has prompted him to write. He, therefore, gives us a summary and general view of the vices and follies reigning in his time. So that this first satire is the natural groundwork of all the rest. Herein he confines himself to no one subject, but strikes indifferently at all men in his way: in every following satire he has chosen some particular moral which he would inculcate, and lashes some particular vice or folly, (an art with which our lampooners are not much acquainted.) But our poet being desirous to reform his own age, and not daring to attempt it by an overt act of naming living persons, inveighs only against those who were infamous in the times immediately preceding his, whereby he not only gives a fair warning to great men, that their memory lies at the mercy of future poets and historians, but also, with a finer stroke of his pen, brands even the living, and personates them under dead men's names. I have avoided, as much as I could possibly, the borrowed learning of marginal notes and illustrations, and for that reason have translated this satire somewhat largely; and freely own, (if it be a fault,) that I have likewise omitted most of the proper names, because I thought they would not much edify the reader. To conclude, if in two or three places I have deserted all the commentators, it is because I thought they first deserted my author, or at least have left him in so much obscurity, that too much room is left for guessing. Still shall I hear, and never quit the score, Stunned with hoarse Codrus' Codrus, or it may be Cordus, a bad poet, who wrote the life and actions of Theseus. Theseid, o'er and o'er? Shall this man's elegies and t'other's play Unpunished murder a long summer's day? Huge Telephus, The name of a tragedy. a formidable page, Cries vengeance; and Orestes' Another tragedy. bulky rage, Unsatisfied with margins closely writ, Foams o'er the covers, and not finished yet. No man can take a more familiar note Of his own home, than I of Vulcan's grot, Or Mars his grove, Some commentators take this grove to be a place where poets were used to repeat their works to the people; but more probably, both this and Vulcan's grot, or cave, and the rest of the places and names here mentioned, are only meant for the common places of Homer in his Iliads and Odysseys. or hollow winds that blow From Ætna's top, or tortured ghosts below. I know by rote the famed exploits of Greece, The Centaurs' fury, and the Golden Fleece; Through the thick shades the eternal scribbler bawls, And shakes the statues on their pedestals. The best and worst That is, the best and the worst poets. on the same theme employs His muse, and plagues us with an equal noise. Provoked by these incorrigible fools, I left declaiming in pedantic schools; Where, with men-boys, I strove to get renown, Advising Sylla to a private gown. This was one of the themes given in the schools of rhetoricians, in the deliberative kind; whether Sylla should lay down the supreme power of dictatorship, or still keep it? But, since the world with writing is possest, I'll versify in spite; and do my best, To make as much waste paper as the rest. But why I lift aloft the satire's rod, And tread the path which famed Lucilius Lucilius, the first satirist of the Romans, who wrote long before Horace. trod, Attend the causes which my muse have led:— When sapless eunuchs mount the marriage-bed; When mannish Mævia, Mævia, a name put for any impudent or mannish woman. that two-handed whore, Astride on horseback hunts the Tuscan boar; When all our lords are by his wealth outvied, Whose razor on my callow beard was tried; Juvenal's barber, now grown wealthy. When I behold the spawn of conquered Nile, Crispinus, both in birth and manners vile, Crispinus, an Egyptian slave; now, by his riches, transformed into a nobleman. Pacing in pomp, with cloak of Tyrian dye, Changed oft a-day for needless luxury; And finding oft occasion to be fanned, Ambitious to produce his lady-hand; Charged with light summer-rings his fingers sweat, The Romans were grown so effeminate in Juvenal's time, that they wore light rings in the summer and heavier in the winter. Unable to support a gem of weight: Such fulsome objects meeting everywhere, 'Tis hard to write, but harder to forbear. To view so lewd a town, and to refrain, What hoops of iron could my spleen contain! When pleading Matho, borne abroad for air, Matho, a famous lawyer, mentioned in other places by Juvenal and Martial. With his fat paunch fills his new-fashioned chair, And after him the wretch in pomp conveyed, Whose evidence his lord and friend betrayed, And but the wished occasion does attend From the poor nobles the last spoils to rend, Whom even spies dread as their superior fiend, And bribe with presents; or, when presents fail, They send their prostituted wives for bail: When night-performance holds the place of merit, And brawn and back the next of kin disherit; (For such good parts are in preferment's way,) The rich old madam never fails to pay Her legacies, by nature's standard given, One gains an ounce, another gains eleven: A dear-bought bargain, all things duly weighed, For which their thrice concocted blood is paid. With looks as wan, as he who in the brake At unawares has trod upon a snake; Or played at Lyons a declaiming prize, For which the vanquished rhetorician dies. Lyons, a city in France, where annual sacrifices and games were made in honour of Augustus Cæsar. What indignation boils within my veins, When perjured guardians, proud with impious gains, Choke up the streets, too narrow for their trains! Whose wards, by want betrayed, to crimes are led Too foul to name, too fulsome to be read! When he who pilled his province 'scapes the laws, And keeps his money, though he lost his cause; His fine begged off, contemns his infamy, Can rise at twelve, and get him drunk ere three; Enjoys his exile, and, condemned in vain, Leaves thee, prevailing province, to complain. Here the poet complains that the governors of provinces, being accused for their unjust exactions, though they were condemned at their trials, yet got off by bribery. Such villainies roused Horace into wrath; And 'tis more noble to pursue his path, Horace, who wrote satires; it is more noble, says our author, to imitate him in that way, than to write the labours of Hercules, the sufferings of Diomedes and his followers, or the flight of Dædalus, who made the Labyrinth, and the death of his son Icarus. Than an old tale of Diomede to repeat, Or labouring after Hercules to sweat, Or wandering in the winding maze of Crete; Or with the winged smith aloft to fly, Or fluttering perish with his foolish boy. With what impatience must the muse behold The wife, by her procuring husband sold? For though the law makes null the adulterer's deed Of lands to her, the cuckold may succeed, Who his taught eyes up to the ceiling throws, And sleeps all over but his wakeful nose. When he dares hope a colonel's command, Whose coursers kept, ran out his father's land; Who yet a stripling, Nero's chariot drove, Whirled o'er the streets, while his vain master strove With boasted art to please his eunuch love. Nero married Sporus, an eunuch; though it may be, the poet meant Nero's mistress in man's apparel. Would it not make a modest author dare To draw his table-book within the square, And fill with notes, when, lolling at his ease, Mæcenas-like, Mæcenas is often taxed by Seneca and others for his effeminacy. the happy rogue he sees Borne by six wearied slaves in open view, Who cancelled an old will, and forged a new; Made wealthy at the small expense of signing With a wet seal, and a fresh interlining? The lady, next, requires a lashing line, Who squeezed a toad into her husband's wine: So well the fashionable medicine thrives, That now 'tis practised even by country wives; Poisoning, without regard of fame or fear, And spotted corpse are frequent on the bier. Wouldst thou to honours and preferments climb? Be bold in mischief, dare some mighty crime, Which dungeons, death, or banishment deserves; For virtue is but drily praised, and starves. Great men to great crimes owe their plate embost, Fair palaces, and furniture of cost, And high commands; a sneaking sin is lost. Who can behold that rank old lecher keep His son's corrupted wife, and hope to sleep? The meaning is, that the very consideration of such a crime will hinder a virtuous man from taking his repose. Or that male-harlot, or that unfledged boy, Eager to sin, before he can enjoy? If nature could not, anger would indite Such woful stuff as I or Sh?ll write. Count from the time, since old Deucalion's boat, Raised by the flood, did on Parnassus float, Deucalion and Pyrrha, when the world was drowned, escaped to the top of Mount Parnassus, and were commanded to restore mankind, by throwing stones over their heads; the stones he threw became men, and those she threw became women. And, scarcely mooring on the cliff, implored An oracle how man might be restored; When softened stones and vital breath ensued, And virgins naked were by lovers viewed; What ever since that golden age was done, What humankind desires, and what they shun; Rage, passions, pleasures, impotence of will, Shall this satirical collection fill. What age so large a crop of vices bore, Or when was avarice extended more? When were the dice with more profusion thrown? The well-filled fob not emptied now alone, But gamesters for whole patrimonies play; The steward brings the deeds which must convey The lost estate: what more than madness reigns, When one short sitting many hundreds drains, And not enough is left him to supply Board-wages, or a footman's livery? What age so many summer-seats did see? Or which of our forefathers fared so well, As on seven dishes at a private meal? Clients of old were feasted; now, a poor Divided dole is dealt at the outward door; Which by the hungry rout is soon dispatched: The paltry largess, too, severely watched, Ere given; and every face observed with care, That no intruding guest usurp a share. Known, you receive; the crier calls aloud Our old nobility of Trojan blood, Who gape among the crowd for their precarious food. The prætor's and the tribune's voice is heard; The freedman jostles, and will be preferred; “First come, first served,” he cries; “and I, in spite Of your great lordships, will maintain my right; Though born a slave, though my torn ears are bored, The ears of all slaves were bored, as a mark of their servitude; which custom is still usual in the East Indies, and in other parts, even for whole nations, who bore prodigious holes in their ears, and wear vast weights at them. 'Tis not the birth, 'tis money makes the lord. The rents of five fair houses I receive; What greater honours can the purple give? The poor patrician is reduced to keep, In melancholy walks, a grazier's sheep: Not Pallas nor Licinius Pallas, a slave freed by Claudius Cæsar, and raised by his favour to great riches. Licinius was another wealthy freedman belonging to Augustus. had my treasure; Then let the sacred tribunes wait my leisure. Once a poor rogue, 'tis true, I trod the street, And trudged to Rome upon my naked feet: Gold is the greatest God; though yet we see No temples raised to money's majesty; No altars fuming to her power divine, Such as to valour, peace, and virtue shine, And faith, and concord; where the stork on high Perhaps the storks were used to build on the top of the temple dedicated to Concord. Seems to salute her infant progeny, Presaging pious love with her auspicious cry.” But since our knights and senators account, To what their sordid begging vails amount, Judge what a wretched share the poor attends, Whose whole subsistence on those alms depends! Their household fire, their raiment, and their food, Prevented by those harpies; He calls the Roman knights, etc., harpies, or devourers. In those days the rich made doles intended for the poor; but the great were either so covetous, or so needy, that they came in their litters to demand their shares of the largess, and thereby prevented, and consequently starved, the poor. when a wood Of litters thick besiege the donor's gate, And begging lords and teeming ladies wait The promised dole; nay, some have learned the trick To beg for absent persons; feign them sick, Close mewed in their sedans, for fear of air; And for their wives produce an empty chair. “This is my spouse; dispatch her with her share; 'Tis Galla.”—“Let her ladyship but peep.”— “No, sir, 'tis pity to disturb her sleep.” The meaning is, that noblemen would cause empty litters to be carried to the giver's door, pretending their wives were within them. “'Tis Galla,” that is, “my wife;” the next words, “Let her ladyship but peep,” are of the servant who distributes the dole; “Let me see her, that I may be sure she is within the litter.” The husband answers, “She is asleep, and to open the litter would disturb her rest.” Such fine employments our whole days divide: The salutations of the morning tide Call up the sun; those ended, to the hall We wait the patron, hear the lawyers bawl; Then to the statues; where amidst the race Of conquering Rome, some Arab shows his face, Inscribed with titles, and profanes the place; The poet here tells you how the idle passed their time, in going first to the levees of the great, then to the hall, that is, to the temple of Apollo, to hear the lawyers plead, then to the market-place of Augustus, where the statues of the famous Romans were set in ranks on pedestals, amongst which statues were seen those of foreigners, such as Arabs, etc., who, for no desert, but only on account of their wealth or favour, were placed amongst the noblest. Fit to be pissed against, and somewhat more. The great man, home conducted, shuts his door. Old clients, wearied out with fruitless care, Dismiss their hopes of eating, and despair; Though much against the grain, forced to retire, Buy roots for supper, and provide a fire. Meantime his lordship lolls within at ease, Pampering his paunch with foreign rarities; Both sea and land are ransacked for the feast, And his own gut the sole invited guest. Such plate, such tables, dishes dressed so well, That whole estates are swallowed at a meal. Even parasites are banished from his board; (At once a sordid and luxurious lord;) Prodigious throat, for which whole boars are drest: (A creature formed to furnish out a feast.) But present punishment pursues his maw, When, surfeited and swelled, the peacock raw He bears into the bath; whence want of breath, Repletions, apoplex, intestate death. His fate makes table-talk, divulged with scorn, And he, a jest, into his grave is borne. No age can go beyond us; future times Can add no further to the present crimes. Our sons but the same things can wish and do; Vice is at stand, and at the highest flow. Then, Satire, spread thy sails, take all the winds can blow! Some may, perhaps, demand what muse can yield Sufficient strength for such a spacious field? From whence can be derived so large a vein, Bold truths to speak, and spoken to maintain, When godlike freedom is so far bereft The noble mind, that scarce the name is left? Ere scandalum magnatum was begot, No matter if the great forgave or not; But if that honest licence now you take, If into rogues omnipotent you rake, Death is your doom, impaled upon a stake; Smeared o'er with wax, and set on fire, to light The streets, and make a dreadful blaze by night. Shall they, who drenched three uncles in a draught Of poisonous juice, be then in triumph brought, Make lanes among the people where they go, And, mounted high on downy chariots, throw Disdainful glances on the crowd below? Be silent, and beware, if such you see; 'Tis defamation but to say, That's he! Against bold Turnus the great Trojan arm, Amidst their strokes the poet gets no harm: Achilles may in epic verse be slain, And none of all his myrmidons complain: Hylas may drop his pitcher, none will cry, Not if he drown himself for company; But when Lucilius brandishes his pen, And flashes in the face of guilty men, A cold sweat stands in drops on every part, And rage succeeds to tears, revenge to smart. A poet may safely write an heroic poem, such as that of Virgil, who describes the duel of Turnus and Æneas; or of Homer, who writes of Achilles and Hector; or the death of Hylas, the catamite of Hercules, who, stooping for water, dropt his pitcher, and fell into the well after it: but it is dangerous to write satire, like Lucilius. Muse, be advised; 'tis past considering time, When entered once the dangerous lists of rhyme; Since none the living villains dare implead, Arraign them in the persons of the dead. THE THIRD SATIRE OF JUVENAL. THE ARGUMENT. The story of this satire speaks itself. Umbritius, the supposed friend of Juvenal, and himself a poet, is leaving Rome, and retiring to Cumæ. Our author accompanies him out of town. Before they take leave of each other, Umbritius tells his friend the reasons which oblige him to lead a private life, in an obscure place. He complains, that an honest man cannot get his bread at Rome; that none but flatterers make their fortunes there; that Grecians, and other foreigners, raise themselves by those sordid arts which he describes, and against which he bitterly inveighs. He reckons up the several inconveniences which arise from a city life, and the many dangers which attend it; upbraids the noblemen with covetousness, for not rewarding good poets; and arraigns the government for starving them. The great art of this satire is particularly shown in common-places, and drawing in as many vices as could naturally fall into the compass of it. Grieved though I am an ancient friend to lose, I like the solitary seat he chose, In quiet Cumæ Cumæ, a small city in Campania, near Puteoli, or Puzzolo, as it is called. The habitation of the Cumæan Sybil. fixing his repose: Where, far from noisy Rome, secure he lives, And one more citizen to Sibyl gives; The road to Baiæ, Baiæ, another little town in Campania, near the sea; a pleasant place. and that soft recess Which all the gods with all their bounty bless; Though I in Prochyta Prochyta, a small, barren island belonging to the kingdom of Naples. with greater ease Could live, than in a street of palaces. What scene so desert or so full of fright, As towering houses, tumbling in the night, And Rome on fire beheld by its own blazing light? But worse than all the clattering tiles, and worse Than thousand padders, is the poet's curse; Rogues, that in dog-days cannot rhyme forbear, The poets in Juvenal's time used to rehearse their poetry in August. But without mercy read, and make you hear. Now while my friend, just ready to depart, Was packing all his goods in one poor cart, He stopt a little at the Conduit-gate, Where Numa modelled once the Roman State, Numa, the second King of Rome, who made their laws, and instituted their religion. In mighty councils with his nymph retired; Egeria, a nymph, or goddess, with whom Numa feigned to converse by night, and to be instructed by her in modelling his superstitions. Though now the sacred shades and founts are hired By banished Jews, who their whole wealth can lay In a small basket, on a wisp of hay: Yet such our avarice is, that every tree Pays for his head, nor sleep itself is free; Nor place, nor persons, now are sacred held, From their own grove the muses are expelled. Into this lonely vale our steps we bend, I and my sullen discontented friend; The marble caves and aqueducts we view; But how adulterate now, and different from the true! How much more beauteous had the fountain been Embellished with her first created green, Where crystal streams through living turf had run, Contented with an urn of native stone! Then thus Umbritius, with an angry frown, And looking back on this degenerate town:— “Since noble arts in Rome have no support, And ragged virtue not a friend at court, No profit rises from the ungrateful stage, My poverty increasing with my age; 'Tis time to give my just disdain a vent, And, cursing, leave so base a government. Where Dædalus his borrowed wings laid by, Dædalus, in his flight from Crete, alighted at Cumæ. To that obscure retreat I choose to fly: While yet few furrows on my face are seen, While I walk upright, and old age is green, And Lachesis has somewhat left to spin. Lachesis is one of the three Destinies, whose office was to spin the life of every man; as it was of Clotho to hold the distaff, and Atropos to cut the thread. Now, now 'tis time to quit this cursed place, And hide from villains my too honest face: Here let Arturius live, Arturius means any debauched, wicked fellow, who gains by the times. and such as he; Such manners will with such a town agree. Knaves, who in full assemblies have the knack Of turning truth to lies, and white to black, Can hire large houses, and oppress the poor By farmed excise; can cleanse the common-shore, And rent the fishery; can bear the dead, And teach their eyes dissembled tears to shed; All this for gain; for gain they sell their very head. These fellows (see what fortune's power can do!) Were once the minstrels of a country show; Followed the prizes through each paltry town, By trumpet-cheeks and bloated faces known. But now, grown rich, on drunken holidays, At their own costs exhibit public plays; Where, influenced by the rabble's bloody will, With thumbs bent back, they popularly kill. In a prize of sword-players, when one of the fencers had the other at his mercy, the vanquished party implored the clemency of the spectators. If they thought he deserved it not, they held up their thumbs, and bent them backwards in sign of death. From thence returned, their sordid avarice rakes In excrements again, and hires the jakes. Why hire they not the town, not every thing, Since such as they have fortune in a string, Who, for her pleasure, can her fools advance, And toss them topmost on the wheel of chance? What's Rome to me, what business have I there? I who can neither lie, nor falsely swear? Nor praise my patron's undeserving rhymes, Nor yet comply with him, nor with his times? Unskilled in schemes by planets to foreshow, Like canting rascals, how the wars will go: I neither will, nor can, prognosticate To the young gaping heir, his father's fate; Nor in the entrails of a toad have pried, Nor carried bawdy presents to a bride: For want of these town-virtues, thus alone I go, conducted on my way by none; Like a dead member from the body rent, Maimed, and unuseful to the government. Who now is loved, but he who loves the times, Conscious of close intrigues, and dipt in crimes, Labouring with secrets which his bosom burn, Yet never must to public light return? They get reward alone, who can betray; For keeping honest counsels none will pay. He who can Verres Verres, prætor in Sicily, contemporary with Cicero, by whom, accused of oppressing the province, he was condemned: his name is used here for any rich vicious man. when he will accuse, The purse of Verres may at pleasure use: But let not all the gold which Tagus hides, And pays the sea in tributary tides, Tagus, a famous river in Spain, which discharges itself into the ocean near Lisbon, in Portugal. It was held of old to be full of golden sands. Be bribe sufficient to corrupt thy breast, Or violate with dreams thy peaceful rest. Great men with jealous eyes the friend behold, Whose secrecy they purchase with their gold. “I haste to tell thee,—nor shall shame oppose,— What confidents our wealthy Romans chose; And whom I must abhor: to speak my mind, I hate, in Rome, a Grecian town to find; To see the scum of Greece transplanted here, Received like gods, is what I cannot bear. Nor Greeks alone, but Syrians here abound; Obscene Orontes, Orontes, the greatest river of Syria. The poet here puts the river for the inhabitants of Syria. diving under ground, Conveys his wealth to Tiber's hungry shores, And fattens Italy with foreign whores: Hither their crooked harps and customs come; All find receipt in hospitable Rome. The barbarous harlots crowd the public place:— Go, fools, and purchase an unclean embrace; The painted mitre court, and the more painted face. Old Romulus, Romulus was the first King of Rome, and son of Mars, as the poets feign. The first Romans were herdsmen. and father Mars, look down! Your herdsman primitive, your homely clown, Is turned a beau in a loose tawdry gown. His once unkem'd and horrid locks, behold 'Stilling sweet oil; his neck enchained with gold; Aping the foreigners in every dress, Which, bought at greater cost, becomes him less. Meantime they wisely leave their native land; From Sicyon, Samos, and from Alaband, And Amydon, to Rome they swarm in shoals: So sweet and easy is the gain from fools. Poor refugees at first, they purchase here; And, soon as denizened, they domineer; Grow to the great, a flattering, servile rout, Work themselves inward, and their patrons out. Quick-witted, brazen-faced, with fluent tongues, Patient of labours, and dissembling wrongs. Riddle me this, and guess him if you can, Who bears a nation in a single man? A cook, a conjurer, a rhetorician, A painter, pedant, a geometrician, A dancer on the ropes, and a physician; All things the hungry Greek exactly knows, And bid him go to heaven, to heaven he goes. In short, no Scythian, Moor, or Thracian born, But in that town which arms and arts adorn. Athens, of which Pallas, the Goddess of Arms and Arts, was patroness. Shall he be placed above me at the board, In purple clothed, and lolling like a lord? Shall he before me sign, whom t'other day A small-craft vessel hither did convey, Where, stowed with prunes, and rotten figs, he lay? How little is the privilege become Of being born a citizen of Rome! The Greeks get all by fulsome flatteries; A most peculiar stroke they have at lies. They make a wit of their insipid friend, His blubber-lips and beetle-brows commend, His long crane-neck and narrow shoulders praise,— You'd think they were describing Hercules. A creaking voice for a clear treble goes; Though harsher than a cock, that treads and crows. We can as grossly praise; but, to our grief, No flattery but from Grecians gains belief. Besides these qualities, we must agree, They mimic better on the stage than we: The wife, the whore, the shepherdess, they play, In such a free, and such a graceful way, That we believe a very woman shown, And fancy something underneath the gown. But not Antiochus, nor Stratocles, Antiochus and Stratocles, two famous Grecian mimics, or actors, in the poet's time. Our ears and ravished eyes can only please; The nation is composed of such as these. All Greece is one comedian; laugh, and they Return it louder than an ass can bray; Grieve, and they grieve; if you weep silently, There seems a silent echo in their eye; They cannot mourn like you, but they can cry. Call for a fire, their winter clothes they take; Begin but you to shiver, and they shake; In frost and snow, if you complain of heat, They rub the unsweating brow, and swear they sweat. We live not on the square with such as these; Such are our betters who can better please; Who day and night are like a looking-glass, Still ready to reflect their patron's face; The panegyric hand, and lifted eye, Prepared for some new piece of flattery. Even nastiness occasions will afford; They praise a belching, or well-pissing lord. Besides, there's nothing sacred, nothing free From bold attempts of their rank lechery. Through the whole family their labours run; The daughter is debauched, the wife is won; Nor 'scapes the bridegroom, or the blooming son. If none they find for their lewd purpose fit, They with the walls and very floors commit. They search the secrets of the house, and so Are worshipped there, and feared for what they know. “And, now we talk of Grecians, cast a view On what, in schools, their men of morals do. A rigid Stoic his own pupil slew; A friend, against a friend of his own cloth, Turned evidence, and murdered on his oath. Publius Egnatius, a Stoic, falsely accused Barea Soranus, as Tacitus tells us. What room is left for Romans in a town Where Grecians rule, and cloaks control the gown? Some Diphilus, or some Protogenes, Grecians living in Rome. Look sharply out, our senators to seize; Engross them wholly, by their native art, And fear no rivals in their bubbles' heart: And drop of poison in my patron's ear, One slight suggestion of a senseless fear, Infused with cunning, serves to ruin me; Disgraced, and banished from the family. In vain forgotten services I boast; My long dependence in an hour is lost. Look round the world, what country will appear, Where friends are left with greater ease than here? At Rome (nor think me partial to the poor) All offices of ours are out of door: In vain we rise, and to their levees run; My lord himself is up before, and gone: The prætor bids his lictors mend their pace, Lest his colleague outstrip him in the race. The childless matrons are, long since, awake, And for affronts the tardy visits take. “'Tis frequent here to see a free-born son On the left hand of a rich hireling run; Because the wealthy rogue can throw away, For half a brace of bouts, a tribune's pay; But you, poor sinner, though you love the vice, And like the whore, demur upon the price; And, frighted with the wicked sum, forbear To lend a hand, and help her from the chair. “Produce a witness of unblemished life, Holy as Numa, or as Numa's wife, Or him who bid the unhallowed flames retire, And snatched the trembling goddess from the fire; Lucius Metellus, the high priest, who, when the temple of Vesta was on fire, saved the Palladium. The question is not put how far extends His piety, but what he yearly spends; Quick, to the business; how he lives and eats; How largely gives; how splendidly he treats; How many thousand acres feed his sheep; What are his rents; what servants does he keep? The account is soon cast up; the judges rate Our credit in the court by our estate. Swear by our gods, or those the Greeks adore, Thou art as sure forsworn, as thou art poor: The poor must gain their bread by perjury; And e'en the gods, that other means deny, In conscience must absolve them, when they lie. “Add, that the rich have still a gibe in store, And will be monstrous witty on the poor; For the torn surtout and the tattered vest, The wretch and all his wardrobe, are a jest; The greasy gown, sullied with often turning, Gives a good hint, to say,—‘The man's in mourning;’ Or, if the shoe be ripped, or patches put,— ‘He's wounded! see the plaister on his foot.’ Want is the scorn of every wealthy fool, And wit in rags is turned to ridicule. ‘Pack hence, and from the covered benches rise,’ (The master of the ceremonies cries,) ‘This is no place for you, whose small estate Is not the value of the settled rate; The sons of happy punks, the pander's heir, Are privileged to sit in triumph there, To clap the first, and rule the theatre. Up to the galleries, for shame, retreat; For, by the Roscian law, the poor can claim no seat.’— Who ever brought to his rich daughter's bed, The man that polled but twelve pence for his head? Who ever named a poor man for his heir, Or called him to assist the judging chair? The poor were wise, who, by the rich oppressed, Withdrew, and sought a sacred place of rest. Once they did well, to free themselves from scorn; But had done better, never to return. Rarely they rise by virtue's aid, who lie Plunged in the depth of helpless poverty. At Rome 'tis worse, where house-rent by the year, And servants' bellies, cost so devilish dear, And tavern-bills run high for hungry cheer. To drink or eat in earthenware we scorn, Which cheaply country-cupboards does adorn, And coarse blue hoods on holidays are worn. Some distant parts of Italy are known, Where none but only dead men wear a gown; The meaning is, that men in some parts of Italy never wore a gown, the usual habit of the Romans, till they were buried in one. On theatres of turf, in homely state, Old plays they act, old feasts they celebrate; The same rude song returns upon the crowd, And, by tradition, is for wit allowed. The mimic yearly gives the same delights; And in the mother's arms the clownish infant frights. Their habits (undistinguished by degree) Are plain, alike; the same simplicity, Both on the stage, and in the pit, you see. In his white cloak the magistrate appears; The country bumpkin the same livery wears. But here attired beyond our purse we go, For useless ornament and flaunting show; We take on trust, in purple robes to shine, And poor, are yet ambitious to be fine. This is a common vice, though all things here Are sold, and sold unconscionably dear. What will you give that Cossus Any wealthy man. may but view Your face, and in the crowd distinguish you; May take your incense like a gracious God, And answer only with a civil nod? To please our patrons, in this vicious age, We make our entrance by the favourite page; Shave his first down, and when he polls his hair, The consecrated locks to temples bear; Pay tributary cracknels, which he sells, And with our offerings help to raise his vails. Who fears in country-towns a house's fall, Or to be caught betwixt a riven wall? But we inhabit a weak city here, Which buttresses and props but scarcely bear; And 'tis the village-mason's daily calling, To keep the world's metropolis from falling, To cleanse the gutters, and the chinks to close, And, for one night, secure his lord's repose. At Cumæ we can sleep quite round the year, Nor falls, nor fires, nor nightly dangers fear; While rolling flames from Roman turrets fly, And the pale citizens for buckets cry. Thy neighbour has removed his wretched store, Few hands will rid the lumber of the poor; Thy own third story smokes, while thou, supine, Art drenched in fumes of undigested wine. For if the lowest floors already burn, Cock-lofts and garrets soon will take the turn, Where thy tame pigeons next the tiles were bred, The Romans used to breed their tame pigeons in their garrets. Which, in their nests unsafe, are timely fled. Codrus Codrus, a learned man, very poor: by his books, supposed to be a poet; for, in all probability, the heroic verses here mentioned, which rats and mice devoured, were Homer's work. had but one bed, so short to boot, That his short wife's short legs hung dangling out; His cupboard's head six earthen pitchers graced, Beneath them was his trusty tankard placed; And, to support this noble plate, there lay A bending Chiron cast from honest clay; His few Greek books a rotten chest contained, Whose covers much of mouldiness complained; Where mice and rats devoured poetic bread, And with heroic verse luxuriously were fed. 'Tis true, poor Codrus nothing had to boast, And yet poor Codrus all that nothing lost; Begged naked through the streets of wealthy Rome, And found not one to feed, or take him home. But, if the palace of Arturius burn, The nobles change their clothes, the matrons mourn; The city-prætor will no pleadings hear; The very name of fire we hate and fear, And look aghast, as if the Gauls were here. While yet it burns, the officious nation flies, Some to condole, and some to bring supplies. One sends him marble to rebuild, and one White naked statues of the Parian stone, The work of Polyclete, that seem to live; While others images for altars give; One books and screens, and Pallas to the breast; Another bags of gold, and he gives best. Childless Arturius, vastly rich before, Thus, by his losses, multiplies his store; Suspected for accomplice to the fire, That burnt his palace but to build it higher. But, could you be content to bid adieu To the dear playhouse, and the players too, Sweet country-seats are purchased everywhere, With lands and gardens, at less price than here You hire a darksome dog-hole by the year. A small convenience decently prepared, A shallow well, that rises in your yard, That spreads his easy crystal streams around, And waters all the pretty spot of ground. There, love the fork, thy garden cultivate, And give thy frugal friends a Pythagorean treat; Herbs, roots, fruits, and salads. 'Tis somewhat to be lord of some small ground, In which a lizard may, at least, turn round. 'Tis frequent here, for want of sleep, to die, Which fumes of undigested feasts deny, And, with imperfect heat, in languid stomachs fry. What house secure from noise the poor can keep, When even the rich can scarce afford to sleep? So dear it costs to purchase rest in Rome, And hence the sources of diseases come. The drover, who his fellow-drover meets In narrow passages of winding streets; The wagoners, that curse their standing teams, Would wake even drowsy Drusus from his dreams. And yet the wealthy will not brook delay, But sweep above our heads, and make their way, In lofty litters borne, and read and write, Or sleep at ease, the shutters make it night; Yet still he reaches first the public place. The press before him stops the client's pace; The crowd that follows crush his panting sides, And trip his heels; he walks not, but he rides. One elbows him, one jostles in the shole, A rafter breaks his head, or chairman's pole; Stockinged with loads of fat town-dirt he goes, And some rogue-soldier, with his hobnailed shoes, Indents his legs behind in bloody rows. See, with what smoke our doles we celebrate: A hundred guests, invited, walk in state; A hundred hungry slaves, with their Dutch kitchens, wait. Huge pans the wretches on their heads must bear, Which scarce gigantic Corbulo Corbulo was a famous general, in Nero's time, who conquered Armenia, and was afterwards put to death by that tyrant, when he was in Greece, in reward of his great services. His stature was not only tall above the ordinary size, but he was also proportionably strong. could rear; Yet they must walk upright beneath the load, Nay run, and, running, blow the sparkling flames abroad. Their coats, from botching newly brought, are torn. Unwieldy timber-trees, in wagons borne, Stretched at their length, beyond their carriage lie, That nod, and threaten ruin from on high; For, should their axle break, its overthrow Would crush, and pound to dust, the crowd below; Nor friends their friends, nor sires their sons could know; Nor limbs, nor bones, nor carcase, would remain, But a mashed heap, a hotchpotch of the slain; One vast destruction; not the soul alone, But bodies, like the soul, invisible are flown. Meantime, unknowing of their fellow's fate, The servants wash the platter, scour the plate, Then blow the fire, with puffing cheeks, and lay The rubbers, and the bathing-sheets display, And oil them first; and each is handy in his way. But he, for whom this busy care they take, Poor ghost! is wandering by the Stygian lake; Affrighted with the ferryman's grim face, New to the horrors of that uncouth place, His passage begs, with unregarded prayer, And wants two farthings to discharge his fare. Return we to the dangers of the night.— And, first, behold our houses' dreadful height; From whence come broken potsherds tumbling down, And leaky ware from garret-windows thrown; Well may they break our heads, that mark the flinty stone. 'Tis want of sense to sup abroad too late, Unless thou first hast settled thy estate; As many fates attend thy steps to meet, As there are waking windows in the street. Bless the good Gods, and think thy chance is rare, To have a piss-pot only for thy share. The scouring drunkard, if he does not fight Before his bed-time, takes no rest that night; Passing the tedious hours in greater pain Than stern Achilles, when his friend was slain; 'Tis so ridiculous, but so true withal, A bully cannot sleep without a brawl. Yet, though his youthful blood be fired with wine, He wants not wit the danger to decline; Is cautious to avoid the coach and six, And on the lacqueys will no quarrel fix. His train of flambeaux, and embroidered coat, May privilege my lord to walk secure on foot; But me, who must by moonlight homeward bend, Or lighted only with a candle's end, Poor me he fights, if that be fighting, where He only cudgels, and I only bear. He stands, and bids me stand; I must abide, For he's the stronger, and is drunk beside. “Where did you whet your knife to-night?” he cries, “And shred the leeks that in your stomach rise? Whose windy beans have stuft your guts, and where Have your black thumbs been dipt in vinegar? With what companion-cobbler have you fed, On old ox-cheeks, or he-goat's tougher head? What, are you dumb? Quick, with your answer, quick, Before my foot salutes you with a kick. Say, in what nasty cellar, under ground, Or what church-porch, your rogueship may be found?”— Answer, or answer not, 'tis all the same, He lays me on, and makes me bear the blame. Before the bar for beating him you come; This is a poor man's liberty in Rome. You beg his pardon; happy to retreat With some remaining teeth, to chew your meat. Nor is this all; for when, retired, you think To sleep securely, when the candles wink, When every door with iron chains is barred, And roaring taverns are no longer heard; The ruffian robbers, by no justice awed, And unpaid cut-throat soldiers, are abroad; Those venal souls, who, hardened in each ill, To save complaints and prosecution, kill. Chased from their woods and bogs, the padders come To this vast city, as their native home, To live at ease, and safely skulk in Rome. The forge in fetters only is employed; Our iron mines exhausted and destroyed In shackles; for these villains scarce allow Goads for the teams, and ploughshares for the plough. Oh, happy ages of our ancestors, Beneath the kings and tribunitial powers! One jail did all their criminals restrain, Which now the walls of Rome can scarce contain. More I could say, more causes I could show For my departure, but the sun is low; The wagoner grows weary of my stay, And whips his horses forwards on their way. Farewell! and when, like me, o'erwhelmed with care, You to your own Aquinum The birthplace of Juvenal. shall repair, To take a mouthful of sweet country air, Be mindful of your friend; and send me word, What joys your fountains and cool shades afford. Then, to assist your satires, I will come, And add new venom when you write of Rome. THE SIXTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL. THE ARGUMENT. This Satire, of almost double length to any of the rest, is a bitter invective against the fair sex. It is, indeed, a common-place, from whence all the moderns have notoriously stolen their sharpest railleries. In his other satires, the poet has only glanced on some particular women, and generally scourged the men; but this he reserved wholly for the ladies. How they had offended him, I know not; but, upon the whole matter, he is not to be excused for imputing to all the vices of some few amongst them. Neither was it generously done of him to attack the weakest, as well as the fairest, part of the creation; neither do I know what moral he could reasonably draw from it. It could not be to avoid the whole sex, if all had been true which he alleges against them; for that had been to put an end to humankind. And to bid us beware of their artifices, is a kind of silent acknowledgment that they have more wit than men; which turns the satire upon us, and particularly upon the poet, who thereby makes a compliment where he meant a libel. If he intended only to exercise his wit, he has forfeited his judgment, by making the one-half of his readers his mortal enemies; and amongst the men, all the happy lovers, by their own experience, will disprove his accusations. The whole world must allow this to be the wittiest of his satires; and truly he had need of all his parts to maintain with so much violence so unjust a charge. I am satisfied he will bring but few over to his opinion; and on that consideration chiefly I venture to translate him. Though there wanted not another reason, which was, that no one else would undertake it; at least Sir C. S., who could have done more right to the author, after a long delay, at length absolutely refused so ungrateful an employment; and every one will grant, that the work must have been imperfect and lame, if it had appeared without one of the principal members belonging to it. Let the poet, therefore, bear the blame of his own invention; and let me satisfy the world that I am not of his opinion. Whatever his Roman ladies were, the English are free from all his imputations. They will read with wonder and abhorrence the vices of an age which was the most infamous of any on record. They will bless themselves when they behold those examples related of Domitian's time; they will give back to antiquity those monsters it produced, and believe, with reason, that the species of those women is extinguished, or, at least, that they were never here propagated. I may safely, therefore, proceed to the argument of a satire which is no way relating to them; and first observe, that my author makes their lust the most heroic of their vices; the rest are in a manner but digression. He skims them over, but he dwells on this; when he seems to have taken his last leave of it, on the sudden he returns to it: it is one branch of it in Hippia, another in Messalina, but lust is the main body of the tree. He begins with this text in the first line, and takes it up, with intermissions, to the end of the chapter. Every vice is a loader, but that is a ten. The fillers, or intermediate parts, are—their revenge; their contrivances of secret crimes; their arts to hide them; their wit to excuse them; and their impudence to own them, when they can no longer be kept secret. Then the persons to whom they are most addicted, and on whom they commonly bestow the last favours, as stage-players, fiddlers, singing-boys, and fencers. Those who pass for chaste amongst them are not really so; but only, for their vast doweries, are rather suffered, than loved, by their own husbands. That they are imperious, domineering, scolding wives; set up for learning, and criticism in poetry; but are false judges: love to speak Greek (which was then the fashionable tongue, as French is now with us). That they plead causes at the bar, and play prizes at the bear-garden: that they are gossips and newsmongers; wrangle with their neighbours abroad, and beat their servants at home: That they lie-in for new faces once a month; are sluttish with their husbands in private, and paint and dress in public for their lovers: that they deal with Jews, diviners, and fortune-tellers; learn the arts of miscarrying and barrenness; buy children, and produce them for their own; murder their husbands' sons, if they stand in their way to his estate, and make their adulterers his heirs. From hence the poet proceeds to show the occasions of all these vices, their original, and how they were introduced in Rome by peace, wealth, and luxury. In conclusion, if we will take the word of our malicious author, bad women are the general standing rule; and the good, but some few exceptions to it. In Saturn's reign, at Nature's early birth, There was that thing called Chastity on earth; When in a narrow cave, their common shade, The sheep, the shepherds, and their gods were laid; When reeds, and leaves, and hides of beasts, were spread, By mountain-housewives, for their homely bed, And mossy pillows raised, for the rude husband's head. Unlike the niceness of our modern dames, (Affected nymphs, with new-affected names,) The Cynthias, and the Lesbias of our years, Who for a sparrow's death dissolve in tears, Those first unpolished matrons, big and bold, Gave suck to infants of gigantic mould; Rough as their savage lords, who ranged the wood, And, fat with acorns, belched their windy food. For when the world was buxom, fresh, and young, Her sons were undebauched, and therefore strong; And whether born in kindly beds of earth, Or struggling from the teeming oaks to birth, Or from what other atoms they begun, No sires they had, or, if a sire, the sun. Some thin remains of chastity appeared Even under Jove, When Jove had driven his father into banishment, the Silver Age began, according to the poets. but Jove without a beard; Before the servile Greeks had learnt to swear By heads of kings; while yet the bounteous year Her common fruits in open plains exposed; Ere thieves were feared, or gardens were inclosed. At length uneasy Justice upwards flew, And both the sisters to the stars withdrew; The poet makes Justice and Chastity sisters; and says that they fled to heaven together, and left earth for ever. From that old era whoring did begin, So venerably ancient is the sin. Adulterers next invade the nuptial state, And marriage-beds creaked with a foreign weight; All other ills did iron times adorn, But whores and silver in one age were born. Yet thou, they say, for marriage dost provide; Is this an age to buckle with a bride? They say thy hair the curling art is taught, The wedding-ring perhaps already bought; A sober man like thee to change his life! What fury would possess thee with a wife? Art thou of every other death bereft, No knife, no ratsbane, no kind halter left? (For every noose compared to hers is cheap.) Is there no city-bridge from whence to leap? Wouldst thou become her drudge, who dost enjoy A better sort of bedfellow, thy boy? He keeps thee not awake with nightly brawls, Nor, with a begged reward, thy pleasure palls; Nor, with insatiate heavings, calls for more, When all thy spirits were drained out before. But still Ursidius courts the marriage-bait, Longs for a son to settle his estate, And takes no gifts, though every gaping heir Would gladly grease the rich old bachelor. What revolution can appear so strange, As such a lecher such a life to change? A rank, notorious whoremaster, to choose To thrust his neck into the marriage-noose? He who so often, in a dreadful fright, Had, in a coffer, 'scaped the jealous cuckold's sight; That he, to wedlock dotingly betrayed, Should hope, in this lewd town, to find a maid!— The man's grown mad! to ease his frantic pain, Run for the surgeon, breathe the middle vein; But let a heifer, with gilt horns, be led To Juno, regent of the marriage-bed; And let him every deity adore, If his new bride prove not an arrant whore, In head, and tail, and every other pore. On Ceres' feast, When the Roman women were forbidden to bed with their husbands. restrained from their delight, Few matrons there, but curse the tedious night; Few whom their fathers dare salute, such lust Their kisses have, and come with such a gust. With ivy now adorn thy doors, and wed; Such is thy bride, and such thy genial bed. Think'st thou one man is for one woman meant? She sooner with one eye would be content. And yet, 'tis noised, a maid did once appear In some small village, though fame says not where. 'Tis possible; but sure no man she found; 'Twas desert all about her father's ground. And yet some lustful God might there make bold; Are Jove and Mars grown impotent and old? Many a fair nymph has in a cave been spread, And much good love without a feather-bed. Whither wouldst thou, to choose a wife, resort, The park, the mall, the playhouse, or the court? Which way soever thy adventures fall, Secure alike of chastity in all. One sees a dancing-master capering high, And raves, and pisses, with pure ecstasy; Another does with all his motions move, And gapes, and grins, as in the feat of love; A third is charmed with the new opera notes, Admires the song, but on the singer dotes. The country lady in the box appears, Softly she warbles over all she hears, And sucks in passion both at eyes and ears. The rest (when now the long vacation's come, The noisy hall and theatres grown dumb) Their memories to refresh, and cheer their hearts, In borrowed breeches, act the players' parts. The poor, that scarce have wherewithal to eat, Will pinch, to make the singing-boy a treat; The rich, to buy him, will refuse no price, And stretch his quail-pipe, till they crack his voice. Tragedians, acting love, for lust are sought, Though but the parrots of a poet's thought. The pleading lawyer, though for counsel used, In chamber-practice often is refused. Still thou wilt have a wife, and father heirs, The product of concurring theatres. Perhaps a fencer did thy brows adorn, And a young swordsman to thy lands is born. Thus Hippia loathed her old patrician lord, And left him for a brother of the sword. To wondering Pharos She fled to Egypt, which wondered at the enormity of her crime. with her love she fled, To show one monster more than Afric bred; Forgetting house and husband left behind, Even children too, she sails before the wind; False to them all, but constant to her kind. But, stranger yet, and harder to conceive, She could the playhouse and the players leave. Born of rich parentage, and nicely bred, She lodged on down, and in a damask bed; Yet daring now the dangers of the deep, On a hard mattress is content to sleep. Ere this, 'tis true, she did her fame expose; But that great ladies with great ease can lose. The tender nymph could the rude ocean bear, So much her lust was stronger than her fear. But had some honest cause her passage prest, The smallest hardship had disturbed her breast. Each inconvenience makes their virtue cold; But womankind in ills is ever bold. Were she to follow her own lord to sea, What doubts and scruples would she raise to stay? Her stomach sick, and her head giddy grows, The tar and pitch are nauseous to her nose; But in love's voyage nothing can offend, Women are never sea-sick with a friend. Amidst the crew she walks upon the board, She eats, she drinks, she handles every cord; And if she spews, 'tis thinking of her lord. Now ask, for whom her friends and fame she lost? What youth, what beauty, could the adulterer boast? What was the face, for which she could sustain To be called mistress to so base a man? The gallant of his days had known the best; Deep scars were seen indented on his breast, And all his battered limbs required their needful rest; A promontory wen, with grisly grace, Stood high upon the handle of his face: His blear-eyes ran in gutters to his chin; His beard was stubble, and his cheeks were thin. But 'twas his fencing did her fancy move; 'Tis arms, and blood, and cruelty, they love. But should he quit his trade, and sheathe his sword, Her lover would begin to be her lord. This was a private crime; but you shall hear What fruits the sacred brows of monarchs bear: He tells the famous story of Messalina, wife to the Emperor Claudius. The good old sluggard but began to snore, When, from his side, up rose the imperial whore; She, who preferred the pleasures of the night To pomps, that are but impotent delight, Strode from the palace, with an eager pace, To cope with a more masculine embrace. Muffled she marched, like Juno in a cloud, Of all her train but one poor wench allowed; One whom in secret service she could trust, The rival and companion of her lust. To the known brothel-house she takes her way, And for a nasty room gives double pay; That room in which the rankest harlot lay. Prepared for fight, expectingly she lies, With heaving breasts, and with desiring eyes. Still as one drops, another takes his place, And, baffled, still succeeds to like disgrace. At length, when friendly darkness is expired, And every strumpet from her cell retired, She lags behind, and, lingering at the gate, With a repining sigh submits to fate; All filth without, and all a fire within, Tired with the toil, unsated with the sin. Old Cæsar's bed the modest matron seeks, The steam of lamps still hanging on her cheeks In ropy smut; thus foul, and thus bedight, She brings him back the product of the night. Now, should I sing what poisons they provide, With all their trumpery of charms beside, And all their arts of death,—it would be known, Lust is the smallest sin the sex can own. Cæsinia still, they say, is guiltless found Of every vice, by her own lord renowned; And well she may, she brought ten thousand pound. She brought him wherewithal to be called chaste; His tongue is tied in golden fetters fast: He sighs, adores, and courts her every hour; Who would not do as much for such a dower? She writes love-letters to the youth in grace, Nay, tips the wink before the cuckold's face; And might do more, her portion makes it good; Wealth has the privilege of widowhood. His meaning is, that a wife who brings a large dowry may do what she pleases, and has all the privileges of a widow. These truths with his example you disprove, Who with his wife is monstrously in love: But know him better; for I heard him swear, 'Tis not that she's his wife, but that she's fair. Let her but have three wrinkles in her face, Let her eyes lessen, and her skin unbrace, Soon you will hear the saucy steward say— “Pack up with all your trinkets, and away; You grow offensive both at bed and board; Your betters must be had to please my lord.” Meantime she's absolute upon the throne, And, knowing time is precious, loses none. She must have flocks of sheep, with wool more fine Than silk, and vineyards of the noblest wine; Whole droves of pages for her train she craves, And sweeps the prisons for attending slaves. In short, whatever in her eyes can come, Or others have abroad, she wants at home. When winter shuts the seas, and fleecy snows Make houses white, she to the merchant goes; Rich crystals of the rock she takes up there, Huge agate vases, and old china ware; Then Berenice's ring A ring of great price, which Herod Agrippa gave to his sister Berenice. He was King of the Jews, but tributary to the Romans. her finger proves, More precious made by her incestuous loves, And infamously dear; a brother's bribe, Even God's anointed, and of Judah's tribe; Where barefoot they approach the sacred shrine, And think it only sin to feed on swine. But is none worthy to be made a wife In all this town? Suppose her free from strife, Rich, fair, and fruitful, of unblemished life; Chaste as the Sabines, whose prevailing charms, Dismissed their husbands' and their brothers' arms; Grant her, besides, of noble blood, that ran In ancient veins, ere heraldry began; Suppose all these, and take a poet's word, A black swan is not half so rare a bird. A wife, so hung with virtues, such a freight, What mortal shoulders could support the weight! Some country girl, scarce to a curtsey bred, Would I much rather than Cornelia Cornelia was mother to the Gracchi, of the family of the Cornelii, from whence Scipio the African was descended, who triumphed over Hannibal. wed; If supercilious, haughty, proud, and vain, She brought her father's triumphs in her train. Away with all your Carthaginian state; Let vanquished Hannibal without-doors wait, Too burly, and too big, to pass my narrow gate. “O Pæan!” cries Amphion, He alludes to the known fable of Niobe, in Ovid. Amphion was her husband. Pæan was Apollo; who with his arrows killed her children, because she boasted that she was more fruitful than Latona, Apollo's mother. “bend thy bow Against my wife, and let my children go!” But sullen Pæan shoots at sons and mothers too. His Niobe and all his boys he lost; Even her, who did her numerous offspring boast, As fair and fruitful as the sow that carried The thirty pigs, at one large litter farrowed. He alludes to the white sow in Virgil, who farrowed thirty pigs. What beauty, or what chastity, can bear So great a price, if, stately and severe, She still insults, and you must still adore? Grant that the honey's much, the gall is more. Upbraided with the virtues she displays, Seven hours in twelve you loathe the wife you praise. Some faults, though small, intolerable grow; For what so nauseous and affected too, As those that think they due perfection want, Who have not learnt to lisp the Grecian cant? Women then learned Greek, as ours speak French. In Greece, their whole accomplishments they seek: Their fashion, breeding, language, must be Greek; But, raw in all that does to Rome belong, They scorn to cultivate their mother-tongue. In Greek they flatter, all their fears they speak; Tell all their secrets; nay, they scold in Greek: Even in the feat of love, they use that tongue. Such affectations may become the young; But thou, old hag, of threescore years and three, Is showing of thy parts in Greek for thee? ??? ??? ????! All those tender words The momentary trembling bliss affords; The kind soft murmurs of the private sheets Are bawdy, while thou speak'st in public streets. Those words have fingers; and their force is such, They raise the dead, and mount him with a touch. But all provocatives from thee are vain; No blandishment the slackened nerve can strain. If then thy lawful spouse thou canst not love, What reason should thy mind to marriage move? Why all the charges of the nuptial feast, Wine and desserts, and sweetmeats to digest? The endowing gold that buys the dear delight, Given for thy first and only happy night? If thou art thus uxoriously inclined, To bear thy bondage with a willing mind, Prepare thy neck, and put it in the yoke; But for no mercy from thy woman look. For though, perhaps, she loves with equal fires, To absolute dominion she aspires, Joys in the spoils, and triumphs o'er thy purse; The better husband makes the wife the worse. Nothing is thine to give, or sell, or buy, All offices of ancient friendship die, Nor hast thou leave to make a legacy. All the Romans, even the most inferior and most infamous sort of them, had the power of making wills. By thy imperious wife thou art bereft A privilege, to pimps and panders left; Thy testament's her will; where she prefers Her ruffians, drudges, and adulterers, Adopting all thy rivals for thy heirs. “Go drag that slave to death!”—“Your reason? why Should the poor innocent be doomed to die? What proofs? For, when man's life is in debate, The judge can ne'er too long deliberate.” “Call'st thou that slave a man?” the wife replies; “Proved, or unproved the crime, the villain dies. I have the sovereign power to save, or kill, And give no other reason but my will.” Thus the she-tyrant reigns, till, pleased with change, Her wild affections to new empires range; Another subject-husband she desires; Divorced from him, she to the first retires, While the last wedding-feast is scarcely o'er, And garlands hang yet green upon the door. So still the reckoning rises; and appears In total sum, eight husbands in five years. The title for a tombstone might be fit, But that it would too commonly be writ. Her mother living, hope no quiet day; She sharpens her, instructs her how to flay Her husband bare, and then divides the prey. She takes love-letters, with a crafty smile, And, in her daughter's answer, mends the style. In vain the husband sets his watchful spies; She cheats their cunning, or she bribes their eyes. The doctor's called; the daughter, taught the trick, Pretends to faint, and in full health is sick. The panting stallion, at the closet door, Hears the consult, and wishes it were o'er. Canst thou, in reason, hope, a bawd so known, Should teach her other manners than her own? Her interest is in all the advice she gives 'Tis on the daughter's rents the mother lives. No cause is tried at the litigious bar, But women plaintiffs or defendants are; They form the process, all the briefs they write, The topics furnish, and the pleas indict, And teach the toothless lawyer how to bite. They turn viragoes too; the wrestler's toil They try, and smear the naked limbs with oil; Against the post their wicker shields they crush, Flourish the sword, and at the plastron push. Of every exercise the mannish crew Fulfils the parts, and oft excels us too; Prepared not only in feigned fights to engage, But rout the gladiators on the stage. What sense of shame in such a breast can lie, Inured to arms, and her own sex to fly? Yet to be wholly man she would disclaim; To quit her tenfold pleasure at the game, For frothy praises and an empty name. Oh what a decent sight 'tis to behold All thy wife's magazine by auction sold! The belt, the crested plume, the several suits Of armour, and the Spanish leather boots! Yet these are they, that cannot bear the heat Of figured silks, and under sarcenet sweat. Behold the strutting Amazonian whore, She stands in guard with her right foot before; Her coats tucked up, and all her motions just, She stamps, and then cries,—“Hah!” at every thrust; But laugh to see her, tired with many a bout, Call for the pot, and like a man piss out. The ghosts of ancient Romans, should they rise, Would grin to see their daughters play a prize. Besides, what endless brawls by wives are bred? The curtain-lecture makes a mournful bed. Then, when she has thee sure within the sheets, Her cry begins, and the whole day repeats. Conscious of crimes herself, she teazes first; Thy servants are accused; thy whore is curst; She acts the jealous, and at will she cries; For women's tears are but the sweat of eyes. Poor cuckold fool! thou think'st that love sincere, And sucks between her lips the falling tear; But search her cabinet, and thou shalt find Each tiller there with love-epistles lined. Suppose her taken in a close embrace, This you would think so manifest a case, No rhetoric could defend, no impudence outface; And yet even then she cries, “The marriage-vow A mental reservation must allow; And there's a silent bargain still implied, The parties should be pleased on either side, And both may for their private needs provide. Though men yourselves, and women us you call, Yet homo is a common name for all.” There's nothing bolder than a woman caught; Guilt gives them courage to maintain their fault. You ask, from whence proceed these monstrous crimes? Once poor, and therefore chaste, in former times Our matrons were; no luxury found room, In low-roofed houses, and bare walls of loam; Their hands with labour hardened while 'twas light, And frugal sleep supplied the quiet night; While pinched with want, their hunger held them straight, When Hannibal was hovering at the gate: But wanton now, and lolling at our ease, We suffer all the inveterate ills of peace, And wasteful riot; whose destructive charms, Revenge the vanquished world of our victorious arms. No crime, no lustful postures are unknown, Since Poverty, our guardian god, is gone; Pride, laziness, and all luxurious arts, Pour, like a deluge, in from foreign parts: Since gold obscene, and silver found the way, Strange fashions, with strange bullion, to convey, And our plain simple manners to betray. What care our drunken dames to whom they spread? Wine no distinction makes of tail or head, Who lewdly dancing at a midnight ball, For hot eringoes and fat oysters call: Full brimmers to their fuddled noses thrust, Brimmers, the last provocatives of lust; When vapours to their swimming brains advance, And double tapers on the table dance. Now think what bawdy dialogues they have, What Tullia talks to her confiding slave, At Modesty's old statue; when by night They make a stand, and from their litters light; The good man early to the levee goes, And treads the nasty puddle of his spouse. The secrets of the goddess named the Good, The Bona Dea, or Good Goddess, at whose feasts no men were to be present. Are even by boys and barbers understood; Where the rank matrons, dancing to the pipe, Jig with their bums, and are for action ripe; With music raised, they spread abroad their hair, And toss their heads like an enamoured mare; Laufella lays her garland by, and proves The mimic lechery of manly loves. Ranked with the lady the cheap sinner lies; For here not blood, but virtue, gives the prize. Nothing is feigned in this venereal strife; 'Tis downright lust, and acted to the life. So full, so fierce, so vigorous, and so strong, That looking on would make old Nestor young. Impatient of delay, a general sound, An universal groan of lust goes round; For then, and only then, the sex sincere is found. “Now is the time for action; now begin,” They cry, “and let the lusty lovers in. The whoresons are asleep; then bring the slaves, And watermen, a race of strong-backed knaves.” I wish, at least, our sacred rites were free From those pollutions of obscenity: But 'tis well known what singer, He alludes to the story of P. Clodius, who, disguised in the habit of a singing woman, went into the house of Cæsar, where the feast of the Good Goddess was celebrated, to find an opportunity with Cæsar's wife, Pompeia. how disguised, A lewd audacious action enterprised; Into the fair, with women mixed, he went, Armed with a huge two-handed instrument; A grateful present to those holy choirs, Where the mouse, guilty of his sex, retires, And even male pictures modestly are veiled: Yet no profaneness in that age prevailed; No scoffers at religious rites were found, Though now at every altar they abound. I hear your cautious council; you would say, “Keep close your women under lock and key:” But, who shall keep those keepers? Women, nurst In craft; begin with those, and bribe them first. The sex is turned all whore; they love the game, And mistresses and maids are both the same. The poor Ogulnia, on the poet's day, Will borrow clothes and chair to see the play; She, who before had mortgaged her estate, And pawned the last remaining piece of plate. Some are reduced their utmost shifts to try; But women have no shame of poverty. They live beyond their stint, as if their store, The more exhausted, would increase the more: Some men, instructed by the labouring ant, Provide against the extremities of want; But womankind, that never knows a mean, Down to the dregs their sinking fortune drain: Hourly they give, and spend, and waste, and wear, And think no pleasure can be bought too dear. There are, who in soft eunuchs place their bliss, To shun the scrubbing of a bearded kiss, And 'scape abortion; but their solid joy Is when the page, already past a boy, Is caponed late, and to the gelder shown, With his two-pounders to perfection grown; When all the navel-string could give, appears; All but the beard, and that's the barber's loss, not theirs. Seen from afar, and famous for his ware, He struts into the bath among the fair; The admiring crew to their devotions fall, And, kneeling, on their new Priapus call. Kerved for his lady's use, with her he lies; And let him drudge for her, if thou art wise, Rather than trust him with thy favourite boy; He proffers death, in proffering to enjoy. If songs they love, the singer's voice they force Beyond his compass, till his quail-pipe's hoarse. His lute and lyre with their embrace is worn; With knots they trim it, and with gems adorn; Run over all the strings, and kiss the case, And make love to it in the master's place. A certain lady once, of high degree, To Janus vowed, and Vesta's deity, That Pollio A famous singing boy. might, in singing, win the prize; Pollio, the dear, the darling of her eyes: She prayed, and bribed; what could she more have done For a sick husband, or an only son? With her face veiled, and heaving up her hands, The shameless suppliant at the altar stands; The forms of prayer she solemnly pursues, And, pale with fear, the offered entrails views. Answer, ye Powers; for, if you heard her vow, Your Godships, sure, had little else to do. This is not all; for actors That such an actor, whom they love, might obtain the prize. they implore; An impudence unknown to heaven before. The Aruspex, He who inspects the entrails of the sacrifice, and from thence foretells the success of the prayer. tired with this religious rout, Is forced to stand so long, he gets the gout. But suffer not thy wife abroad to roam: If she loves singing, let her sing at home; Not strut in streets with Amazonian pace, For that's to cuckold thee before thy face. Their endless itch of news comes next in play; They vent their own, and hear what others say; Know what in Thrace, or what in France is done; The intrigues betwixt the stepdame and the son; Tell who loves who, what favours some partake, And who is jilted for another's sake; What pregnant widow in what month was made; How oft she did, and, doing, what she said. She first beholds the raging comet rise, Knows whom it threatens, and what lands destroys; Still for the newest news she lies in wait, And takes reports just entering at the gate. Wrecks, floods, and fires, whatever she can meet, She spreads, and is the fame of every street. This is a grievance; but the next is worse; A very judgment, and her neighbours' curse; For, if their barking dog disturb her ease, No prayer can bend her, no excuse appease. The unmannered malefactor is arraigned; But first the master, who the cur maintained, Must feel the scourge. By night she leaves her bed, By night her bathing equipage is led, That marching armies a less noise create; She moves in tumult, and she sweats in state. Meanwhile, her guests their appetites must keep; Some gape for hunger, and some gasp for sleep. At length she comes, all flushed; but ere she sup, Swallows a swinging preparation-cup, And then, to clear her stomach, spews it up. The deluge-vomit all the floor o'erflows, And the sour savour nauseates every nose. She drinks again, again she spews a lake; Her wretched husband sees, and dares not speak; But mutters many a curse against his wife, And damns himself for choosing such a life. But of all plagues, the greatest is untold; The book-learned wife, in Greek and Latin bold; The critic-dame, who at her table sits, Homer and Virgil quotes, and weighs their wits, And pities Dido's agonising fits. She has so far the ascendant of the board, The prating pedant puts not in one word; The man of law is nonplussed in his suit, Nay, every other female tongue is mute. Hammers, and beating anvils, you would swear, And Vulcan, with his whole militia, there. Tabors and trumpets, cease; for she alone Is able to redeem the labouring moon. The ancients endeavoured to help the moon, during an eclipse, by sounding trumpets. Even wit's a burthen, when it talks too long; But she, who has no continence of tongue, Should walk in breeches, and should wear a beard, And mix among the philosophic herd. O what a midnight curse has he, whose side Is pestered with a mood and figure bride! Let mine, ye Gods! (if such must be my fate,) No logic learn, nor history translate, But rather be a quiet, humble fool; I hate a wife to whom I go to school, Who climbs the grammar-tree, distinctly knows Where noun, and verb, and participle grows; Corrects her country-neighbour; and, abed, For breaking Priscian's breaks her husband's head. A woman-grammarian, who corrects her husband for speaking false Latin, which is called “breaking Priscian's head.” The gaudy gossip, when she's set agog, In jewels drest, and at each ear a bob, Goes flaunting out, and, in her trim of pride, Thinks all she says or does is justified. When poor, she's scarce a tolerable evil; But rich, and fine, a wife's a very devil. She duly, once a month, renews her face; Meantime, it lies in daub, and hid in grease. Those are the husband's nights; she craves her due, He takes fat kisses, and is stuck in glue. But to the loved adulterer when she steers, Fresh from the bath, in brightness she appears: For him the rich Arabia sweats her gum, And precious oils from distant Indies come, How haggardly soe'er she looks at home. The eclipse then vanishes, and all her face Is opened, and restored to every grace; The crust removed, her cheeks, as smooth as silk, Are polished with a wash of asses' milk; And should she to the furthest north be sent, A train of these I.e. of the milk asses. attend her banishment. But hadst thou seen her plaistered up before, 'Twas so unlike a face, it seemed a sore. 'Tis worth our while, to know what all the day They do, and how they pass their time away; For, if o'ernight the husband has been slack, Or counterfeited sleep, and turned his back, Next day, be sure, the servants go to wrack. The chambermaid and dresser are called whores, The page is stripped, and beaten out of doors; The whole house suffers for the master's crime, And he himself is warned to wake another time. She hires tormentors by the year; she treats Her visitors, and talks, but still she beats; Beats while she paints her face, surveys her gown, Casts up the day's account, and still beats on: Tired out, at length, with an outrageous tone, She bids them in the devil's name be gone. Compared with such a proud, insulting dame, Sicilian tyrants Sicilian tyrants were grown to a proverb, in Latin, for their cruelty. may renounce their name. For, if she hastes abroad to take the air, Or goes to Isis' church, (the bawdy house of prayer,) She hurries all her handmaids to the task; Her head, alone, will twenty dressers ask. Psecas, the chief, with breast and shoulders bare, Trembling, considers every sacred hair; If any straggler from his rank be found, A pinch must for the mortal sin compound. Psecas is not in fault; but in the glass, The dame's offended at her own ill face. That maid is banished; and another girl, More dexterous, manages the comb and curl. The rest are summoned on a point so nice, And, first, the grave old woman gives advice; The next is called, and so the turn goes round, As each for age, or wisdom, is renowned: Such counsel, such deliberate care they take, As if her life and honour lay at stake: With curls on curls, they build her head before, And mount it with a formidable tower. A giantess she seems; but look behind, And then she dwindles to the pigmy kind. Duck-legged, short-waisted, such a dwarf she is, That she must rise on tiptoes for a kiss. Meanwhile, her husband's whole estate is spent! He may go bare, while she receives his rent. She minds him not; she lives not as a wife, But, like a bawling neighbour, full of strife: Near him in this alone, that she extends Her hate to all his servants and his friends. Bellona's priests, Bellona's priests were a sort of fortune-tellers, and their high priest an eunuch. an eunuch at their head, About the streets a mad procession lead; The venerable gelding, large, and high, O'erlooks the herd of his inferior fry. His awkward clergymen about him prance, And beat the timbrels to their mystic dance; Guiltless of testicles, they tear their throats, And squeak, in treble, their unmanly notes. Meanwhile, his cheeks the mitred prophet swells, And dire presages of the year foretells; Unless with eggs (his priestly hire) they haste To expiate, and avert the autumnal blast; And add beside a murrey-coloured vest, A garment was given to the priest, which he threw, or was supposed to throw, into the river; and that, they thought, bore all the sins of the people, which were drowned with it. Which, in their places, may receive the pest, And, thrown into the flood, their crimes may bear, To purge the unlucky omens of the year. The astonished matrons pay, before the rest; That sex is still obnoxious to the priest. Through ye they beat, and plunge into the stream, If so the God has warned them in a dream. Weak in their limbs, but in devotion strong, On their bare hands and feet they crawl along A whole field's length, the laughter of the throng. Should Io (Io's priest, I mean) command A pilgrimage to Meroe's burning sand, Through deserts they would seek the secret spring, And holy water for lustration bring. How can they pay their priests too much respect, Who trade with heaven, and earthly gains neglect? With him domestic gods discourse by night; By day, attended by his choir in white, The bald pate tribe runs madding through the street, And smile to see with how much ease they cheat. The ghostly sire forgives the wife's delights, Who sins, through frailty, on forbidden nights, And tempts her husband in the holy time, When carnal pleasure is a mortal crime. The sweating image shakes his head, but he, With mumbled prayers, atones the deity. The pious priesthood the fat goose receive, And, they once bribed, the godhead must forgive. No sooner these remove, but full of fear, A gipsy Jewess whispers in your ear, And begs an alms; an high-priest's daughter she, Versed in their Talmud, and divinity, And prophesies beneath a shady tree. Her goods a basket, and old hay her bed, She strolls, and, telling fortunes, gains her bread: Farthings, and some small moneys, are her fees; Yet she interprets all your dreams for these, Foretells the estate, when the rich uncle dies, And sees a sweetheart in the sacrifice. Such toys, a pigeon's entrails can disclose, Which yet the Armenian augur far outgoes; In dogs, a victim more obscene, he rakes; And murdered infants for inspection takes: For gain his impious practice he pursues; For gain will his accomplices accuse. More credit yet is to Chaldeans Chaldeans are thought to have been the first astrologers. given; What they foretell, is deemed the voice of heaven. Their answers, as from Hammon's altars, come; Since now the Delphian oracles are dumb, And mankind, ignorant of future fate, Believes what fond astrologers relate. Of these the most in vogue is he, who, sent Beyond seas, is returned from banishment; His art who to aspiring Otho Otho succeeded Galba in the empire, which was foretold him by an astrologer. sold, And sure succession to the crown foretold; For his esteem is in his exile placed; The more believed, the more he was disgraced. No astrologic wizard honour gains, Who has not oft been banished, or in chains. He gets renown, who, to the halter near, But narrowly escapes, and buys it dear. From him your wife inquires the planets' will, When the black jaundice shall her mother kill; Her sister's and her uncle's end would know, But, first, consults his art, when you shall go; And,—what's the greatest gift that heaven can give,— If after her the adulterer shall live. She neither knows, nor cares to know, the rest, If Mars and Saturn Mars and Saturn are the two unfortunate planets; Jupiter and Venus the two fortunate. shall the world infest; Or Jove and Venus, with their friendly rays, Will interpose, and bring us better days. Beware the woman too, and shun her sight, Who in these studies does herself delight, By whom a greasy almanac is borne, With often handling, like chafed amber worn: Not now consulting, but consulted, she Of the twelve houses, and their lords, is free. She, if the scheme a fatal journey show, Stays safe at home, but lets her husband go. If but a mile she travel out of town, The planetary hour must first be known, And lucky moment; if her eye but aches, Or itches, its decumbiture she takes; No nourishment receives in her disease, But what the stars and Ptolemy A famous astrologer; an Egyptian. shall please. The middle sort, who have not much to spare, To chiromancers' cheaper art repair, Who clap the pretty palm, to make the lines more fair. But the rich matron, who has more to give, Her answers from the Brachman The Brachmans are Indian philosophers, who remain to this day, and hold, after Pythagoras, the translation of souls from one body to another. will receive; Skilled in the globe and sphere, he gravely stands, And, with his compass, measures seas and lands. The poorest of the sex have still an itch To know their fortunes, equal to the rich. The dairymaid inquires, if she shall take The trusty tailor, and the cook forsake. Yet these, though poor, the pain of childbed bear, And without nurses their own infants rear: You seldom hear of the rich mantle spread For the babe, born in the great lady's bed. Such is the power of herbs, such arts they use To make them barren, or their fruit to lose. But thou, whatever slops she will have bought, Be thankful, and supply the deadly draught; Help her to make manslaughter; let her bleed, And never want for savin at her need. For, if she holds till her nine months be run, Thou may'st be father to an Ethiop's son; Juvenal's meaning is, help her to any kind of slops which may cause her to miscarry, for fear she may be brought to bed of a black Moor, which thou, being her husband, art bound to father; and that bastard may, by law, inherit thy estate. A boy, who, ready gotten to thy hands, By law is to inherit all thy lands; One of that hue, that, should he cross the way, His omen would discolour all the day. The Romans thought it ominous to see a black Moor in the morning, if he were the first man they met. I pass the foundling by, a race unknown, At doors exposed, whom matrons make their own; And into noble families advance A nameless issue, the blind work of chance. Indulgent fortune does her care employ, And, smiling, broods upon the naked boy: Her garment spreads, and laps him in the fold, And covers with her wings from nightly cold: Gives him her blessing, puts him in a way, Sets up the farce, and laughs at her own play. Him she promotes; she favours him alone, And makes provision for him as her own. The craving wife the force of magic tries, And philtres for the unable husband buys; The potion works not on the part designed, But turns his brains, and stupefies his mind. The sotted moon-calf gapes, and, staring on, Sees his own business by another done: A long oblivion, a benumbing frost, Constrains his head, and yesterday is lost. Some nimbler juice would make him foam and rave, Like that Cæsonia Cæsonia, wife to Caius Caligula, the great tyrant. It is said she gave him a love-potion, which, flying up into his head, distracted him, and was the occasion of his committing so many acts of cruelty. to her Caius gave, Who, plucking from the forehead of the foal His mother's love, infused it in the bowl; The boiling blood ran hissing in his veins, Till the mad vapour mounted to his brains. The Thunderer was not half so much on fire, When Juno's girdle kindled his desire. What woman will not use the poisoning trade, When Cæsar's wife the precedent has made? Let Agrippina's mushroom Agrippina was the mother of the tyrant Nero, who poisoned her husband Claudius that Nero might succeed, who was her son, and not Britannicus, who was the son of Claudius by a former wife be forgot, Given to a slavering, old, unuseful sot; That only closed the driv'ling dotard's eyes, And sent his godhead downward to the skies; But this fierce potion calls for fire and sword, Nor spares the commons, when it strikes the lord. So many mischiefs were in one combined; So much one single poisoner cost mankind. If step-dames seek their sons-in-law to kill, 'Tis venial trespass—let them have their will; But let the child, intrusted to the care Of his own mother, of her bread beware; Beware the food she reaches with her hand,— The morsel is intended for thy land. Thy tutor be thy taster, thou eat; There's poison in thy drink and in thy meat. You think this feigned; the satire, in a rage, Struts in the buskins of the tragic stage; Forgets his business is to laugh and bite, And will of deaths and dire revenges write. Would it were all a fable that you read! But Drymon's wife The widow of Drymon poisoned her sons, that she might succeed to their estates. This was done in the poet's time, or just before it. pleads guilty to the deed. “I,” she confesses, “in the fact was caught, Two sons despatching at one deadly draught.” “What, two! two sons, thou viper, in one day!” “Yes, seven,” she cries, “if seven were in my way.” Medea's legend is no more a lie, Our age adds credit to antiquity. Great ills, we grant, in former times did reign, And murders then were done, but not for gain. Less admiration to great crimes is due, Which they through wrath, or through revenge pursue; For, weak of reason, impotent of will, The sex is hurried headlong into ill; And like a cliff, from its foundations torn By raging earthquakes, into seas is borne. But those are fiends, who crimes from thought begin, And, cool in mischief, meditate the sin, They read the example of a pious wife, Redeeming, with her own, her husband's life; Yet if the laws did that exchange afford, Would save their lap-dog sooner than their lord. Where'er you walk the Belides The Belides were fifty sisters, married to fifty young men, their cousins-german; and killed them all on their wedding-night, excepting Hypermnestra, who saved her husband Linus [Lynceus]. you meet, And Clytemnestras grow in every street; But here's the difference,—Agamemnon's wife Was a gross butcher with a bloody knife; But murder now is to perfection grown, And subtle poisons are employed alone; Unless some antidote prevents their arts, And lines with balsam all the nobler parts. In such a case, reserved for such a need, Rather than fail, the dagger does the deed. THE TENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL. THE ARGUMENT. The Poet's design, in this divine Satire, is to represent the various wishes and desires of mankind, and to set out the folly of them. He runs through all the several heads, of riches, honours, eloquence, fame for martial achievements, long life, and beauty; and gives instances in each, how frequently they have proved the ruin of those that owned them. He concludes, therefore, that, since we generally choose so ill for ourselves, we should do better to leave it to the gods to make the choice for us. All we can safely ask of heaven lies within a very small compass—it is but health of body and mind; and if we have these, it is not much matter what we want besides; for we have already enough to make us happy. Look round the habitable world, how few Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue. How void of reason are our hopes and fears! What in the conduct of our life appears So well designed, so luckily begun, But when we have our wish, we wish undone? Whole houses, of their whole desires possest, Are often ruined at their own request. In wars and peace things hurtful we require, When made obnoxious to our own desire. With laurels some have fatally been crowned; Some, who the depths of eloquence have found, In that unnavigable stream were drowned. The brawny fool, who did his vigour boast, In that presuming confidence was lost; Milo, of Crotona; who, for a trial of his strength, going to rend an oak, perished in the attempt, for his arms were caught in the trunk of it, and he was devoured by wild beasts. But more have been by avarice opprest, And heaps of money crowded in the chest: Unwieldy sums of wealth, which higher mount Than files of marshalled figures can account; To which the stores of Crœsus, in the scale, Would look like little dolphins, when they sail In the vast shadow of the British whale. For this, in Nero's arbitrary time, When virtue was a guilt, and wealth a crime, A troop of cut-throat guards were sent to seize The rich men's goods, and gut their palaces: The mob, commissioned by the government, Are seldom to an empty garret sent. The fearful passenger, who travels late, Charged with the carriage of a paltry plate, Shakes at the moonshine shadow of a rush, And sees a red-coat rise from every bush; The beggar sings, even when he sees the place Beset with thieves, and never mends his pace. Of all the vows, the first and chief request Of each, is—to be richer than the rest: And yet no doubts the poor man's draught control, He dreads no poison in his homely bowl; Then fear the deadly drug, when gems divine Enchase the cup, and sparkle in the wine. Will you not now the pair of sages praise, Who the same end pursued by several ways? One pitied, one contemned, the woful times; One laughed at follies, one lamented crimes. Laughter is easy; but the wonder lies, What stores of brine supplied the weeper's eyes. Democritus could feed his spleen, and shake His sides and shoulders, till he felt them ache; Though in his country town no lictors were, Nor rods, nor axe, nor tribune, did appear; Nor all the foppish gravity of show, Which cunning magistrates on crowds bestow. What had he done, had he beheld on high Our prætor seated in mock majesty; His chariot rolling o'er the dusty place, While, with dumb pride, and a set formal face, He moves, in the dull ceremonial track, With Jove's embroidered coat upon his back! A suit of hangings had not more opprest His shoulders, than that long laborious vest; A heavy gewgaw, called a crown, that spread About his temples, drowned his narrow head, And would have crushed it with the massy freight, But that a sweating slave sustained the weight; A slave, in the same chariot seen to ride, To mortify the mighty madman's pride. Add now the imperial eagle, raised on high, With golden beak, the mark of majesty; Trumpets before, and on the left and right A cavalcade of nobles, all in white; In their own natures false and flattering tribes, But made his friends by places and by bribes. In his own age, Democritus could find Sufficient cause to laugh at humankind: Learn from so great a wit; a land of bogs, With ditches fenced, a heaven fat with fogs, May form a spirit fit to sway the State, And make the neighbouring monarchs fear their fate. He laughs at all the vulgar cares and fears; At their vain triumphs, and their vainer tears: An equal temper in his mind he found, When fortune flattered him, and when she frowned. 'Tis plain, from hence, that what our vows request Are hurtful things, or useless at the best. Some ask for envied power; which public hate Pursues, and hurries headlong to their fate: Down go the titles; and the statue crowned, Is by base hands in the next river drowned. The guiltless horses, and the chariot wheel, The same effects of vulgar fury feel: The smith prepares his hammer for the stroke, While the lung'd bellows hissing fire provoke. Sejanus, almost first of Roman names, Sejanus was Tiberius's first favourite; and, while he continued so, had the highest marks of honour bestowed on him. Statues and triumphal chariots were everywhere erected to him. But, as soon as he fell into disgrace with the emperor, these were all immediately dismounted, and the senate and common people insulted over him as meanly as they had fawned on him before. The great Sejanus crackles in the flames: Formed in the forge, the pliant brass is laid On anvils; and of head and limbs are made, Pans, cans, and piss-pots, a whole kitchen trade. Adorn your doors with laurels; and a bull, Milk white, and large, lead to the Capitol; Sejanus with a rope is dragged along, The sport and laughter of the giddy throng; “Good Lord!” they cry, “what Ethiop lips he has; How foul a snout, and what a hanging face! By heaven, I never could endure his sight! But say, how came his monstrous crimes to light? What is the charge, and who the evidence, (The saviour of the nation and the prince?)” “Nothing of this; but our old Cæsar sent A noisy letter to his parliament.” “Nay, sirs, if Cæsar writ, I ask no more; He's guilty, and the question's out of door.” How goes the mob? (for that's a mighty thing,) When the king's trump, the mob are for the king; They follow fortune, and the common cry Is still against the rogue condemned to die. But the same very mob, that rascal crowd, Had cried “Sejanus,” with a shout as loud, Had his designs (by fortune's favour blest) Succeeded, and the prince's age opprest. But long, long since, the times have changed their face, The people grown degenerate and base; Not suffered now the freedom of their choice To make their magistrates, and sell their voice. Our wise forefathers, great by sea and land, Had once the power and absolute command; All offices of trust themselves disposed; Raised whom they pleased, and whom they pleased deposed: But we, who give our native rights away, And our enslaved posterity betray, Are now reduced to beg an alms, and go On holidays to see a puppet-show. “There was a damned design,” cries one, “no doubt, For warrants are already issued out: I met Brutidius in a mortal fright, He's dipt for certain, and plays least in sight; I fear the rage of our offended prince, Who thinks the senate slack in his defence. Come, let us haste, our loyal zeal to show, And spurn the wretched corpse of Cæsar's foe: But let our slaves be present there; lest they Accuse their masters, and for gain betray.” Such were the whispers of those jealous times, About Sejanus' punishment and crimes. Now, tell me truly, wouldst thou change thy fate, To be, like him, first minister of State? To have thy levees crowded with resort, Of a depending, gaping, servile court; Dispose all honours of the sword and gown, Grace with a nod, and ruin with a frown; To hold thy prince in pupilage, and sway That monarch, whom the mastered world obey? While he, intent on secret lusts alone, Lives to himself, abandoning the throne; Cooped in a narrow isle, The island of Caprea, which lies about a league out at sea from the Campanian shore, was the scene of Tiberius's pleasures in the latter part of his reign. There he lived, for some years, with diviners, soothsayers, and worse company; and from thence despatched all his orders to the senate. observing dreams With flattering wizards, and erecting schemes! I well believe thou wouldst be great as he, For every man's a fool to that degree: All wish the dire prerogative to kill; Even they would have the power, who want the will: But wouldst thou have thy wishes understood, To take the bad together with the good? Wouldst thou not rather choose a small renown, To be the mayor of some poor paltry town; Bigly to look, and barbarously to speak; To pound false weights, and scanty measures break? Then, grant we that Sejanus went astray In every wish, and knew not how to pray; For he, who grasped the world's exhausted store, Yet never had enough, but wished for more, Raised a top-heavy tower, of monstrous height, Which, mouldering, crushed him underneath the weight. What did the mighty Pompey's fall beget, And ruined him, who, greater than the Great, Julius Cæsar, who got the better of Pompey, that was styled The Great. The stubborn pride of Roman nobles broke, And bent their haughty necks beneath his yoke: What else but his immoderate lust of power, Prayers made and granted in a luckless hour? For few usurpers to the shades descend By a dry death, or with a quiet end. The boy, who scarce has paid his entrance down To his proud pedant, or declined a noun, (So small an elf, that, when the days are foul, He and his satchel must be borne to school,) Yet prays, and hopes, and aims at nothing less, To prove a Tully, or Demosthenes: But both those orators, so much renowned, In their own depths of eloquence were drowned: Demosthenes and Tully both died for their oratory: Demosthenes gave himself poison, to avoid being carried to Antipater, one of Alexander's captains, who had then made himself master of Athens. Tully was murdered by M. Antony's order, in return for those invectives he made against him. The hand and head were never lost of those Who dealt in doggrel, or who punned in prose. “Fortune foretuned the dying notes of Rome, Till I, thy consul sole, consoled thy doom.” The Latin of this couplet is a famous verse of Tully's, in which he sets out the happiness of his own consulship, famous for the vanity and the ill poetry of it; for Tully, as he had a good deal of the one, so he had no great share of the other. His fate had crept below the lifted swords, Had all his malice been to murder words. I rather would be Mævius, thrash for rhymes Like his, the scorn and scandal of the times, Than that Philippic, The orations of Tully against M. Antony were styled by him “Philippics,” in imitation of Demosthenes, who had given that name before to those he made against Philip of Macedon. fatally divine, Which is inscribed the second, should be mine. Nor he, the wonder of the Grecian throng, Who drove them with the torrent of his tongue, Who shook the theatres, and swayed the State Of Athens, found a more propitious fate. Whom, born beneath a boding horoscope, His sire, the blear-eyed Vulcan of a shop, From Mars his forge, sent to Minerva's schools, To learn the unlucky art of wheedling fools. With itch of honour, and opinion vain, All things beyond their native worth we strain; The spoils of war, brought to Feretrian Jove, An empty coat of armour hung above The conqueror's chariot, and in triumph borne, A streamer from a boarded galley torn, A chapfallen beaver loosely hanging by The cloven helm, an arch of victory; On whose high convex sits a captive foe, And, sighing, casts a mournful look below; This is a mock account of a Roman triumph.— Of every nation each illustrious name, Such toys as these have cheated into fame; Exchanging solid quiet, to obtain The windy satisfaction of the brain. So much the thirst of honour fires the blood; So many would be great, so few be good: For who would Virtue for herself regard, Or wed, without the portion of reward? Yet this mad chase of fame, by few pursued, Has drawn destruction on the multitude; This avarice of praise in times to come, Those long inscriptions crowded on the tomb; Should some wild fig-tree take her native bent, And heave below the gaudy monument, Would crack the marble titles, and disperse The characters of all the lying verse. For sepulchres themselves must crumbling fall In time's abyss, the common grave of all. Great Hannibal within the balance lay, And tell how many pounds his ashes weigh; Whom Afric was not able to contain, Whose length runs level with the Atlantic main, And wearies fruitful Nilus, to convey His sun-beat waters by so long a way; Which Ethiopia's double clime divides, And elephants in other mountains hides. Spain first he won, the Pyreneans past, And steepy Alps, the mounds that nature cast; And with corroding juices, as he went, A passage through the living rocks he rent: Then, like a torrent rolling from on high, He pours his headlong rage on Italy, In three victorious battles overrun; Yet, still uneasy, cries,—“There's nothing done, Till level with the ground their gates are laid, And Punic flags on Roman towers displayed.” Ask what a face belonged to this high fame, His picture scarcely would deserve a frame: A sign-post dauber would disdain to paint The one-eyed hero on his elephant. Now, what's his end, O charming Glory! say, What rare fifth act to crown this huffing play? In one deciding battle overcome, He flies, is banished from his native home; Begs refuge in a foreign court, and there Attends, his mean petition to prefer; Repulsed by surly grooms, who wait before The sleeping tyrant's interdicted door. What wondrous sort of death has heaven designed, Distinguished from the herd of humankind, For so untamed, so turbulent a mind? Nor swords at hand, nor hissing darts afar, Are doomed to avenge the tedious bloody war; But poison, drawn through a ring's hollow plate, Must finish him—a sucking infant's fate. Go, climb the rugged Alps, ambitious fool, To please the boys, and be a theme at school. One world sufficed not Alexander's mind; Cooped up, he seemed in earth and seas confined, And, struggling, stretched his restless limbs about The narrow globe, to find a passage out: Yet entered in the brick-built town, Babylon, where Alexander died. he tried The tomb, and found the strait dimensions wide. Death only this mysterious truth unfolds, The mighty soul how small a body holds. Old Greece a tale of Athos would make out, Xerxes is represented in history after a very romantic manner: affecting fame beyond measure, and doing the most extravagant things to compass it. Mount Athos made a prodigious promontory in the Ægean Sea; he is said to have cut a channel through it, and to have sailed round it. He made a bridge of boats over the Hellespont, where it was three miles broad; and ordered a whipping for the winds and seas, because they had once crossed his designs; as we have a very solemn account of it in Herodotus. But, after all these vain boasts, he was shamefully beaten by Themistocles at Salamis; and returned home, leaving most of his fleet behind him. Cut from the continent, and sailed about; Seas hid with navies, chariots passing o'er The channel, on a bridge from shore to shore: Rivers, whose depth no sharp beholder sees, Drunk at an army's dinner to the lees; With a long legend of romantic things, Which in his cups the boozy poet sings. But how did he return, this haughty brave, Who whipt the winds, and made the sea his slave? (Though Neptune took unkindly to be bound, And Eurus never such hard usage found In his Æolian prison under ground;) What god so mean, even he who points the way, Mercury, who was a god of the lowest size, and employed always in errands between heaven and hell, and mortals used him accordingly; for his statues were anciently placed where roads met, with directions on the fingers of them, pointing out the several ways to travellers. So merciless a tyrant to obey? But how returned he, let us ask again? In a poor skiff he passed the bloody main, Choked with the slaughtered bodies of his train. For fame he prayed, but let the event declare He had no mighty penn'worth of his prayer:— “Jove, grant me length of life, and years good store Heap on my bending back! I ask no more.” Both sick and healthful, old and young, conspire In this one silly mischievous desire. Mistaken blessing, which old age they call! 'Tis a long, nasty, darksome hospital: A ropy chain of rheums; a visage rough, Deformed, unfeatured, and a skin of buff; A stitch-fallen cheek, that hangs below the jaw; Such wrinkles as a skilful hand would draw For an old grandame ape, when, with a grace, She sits at squat, and scrubs her leathern face. In youth, distinctions infinite abound; No shape, or feature, just alike are found; The fair, the black, the feeble, and the strong: But the same foulness does to age belong, The self-same palsy, both in limbs and tongue; The skull and forehead one bald barren plain, And gums unarmed to mumble meat in vain; Besides, the eternal drivel, that supplies The dropping beard, from nostrils, mouth, and eyes. His wife and children loathe him, and, what's worse, Himself does his offensive carrion curse! Flatterers forsake him too; for who would kill Himself, to be remembered in a will? His taste not only palled to wine and meat, But to the relish of a nobler treat. The limber nerve, in vain provoked to rise, Inglorious from the field of battle flies; Poor feeble dotard! how could he advance With his blue head-piece, and his broken lance? Add, that, endeavouring still, without effect, A lust more sordid justly we suspect. Those senses lost, behold a new defeat, The soul dislodging from another seat. What music, or enchanting voice, can cheer A stupid, old, impenetrable ear? No matter in what place, or what degree Of the full theatre he sits to see; Cornets and trumpets cannot reach his ear; Under an actor's nose he's never near. His boy must bawl, to make him understand The hour o' the day, or such a lord's at hand; The little blood that creeps within his veins, Is but just warmed in a hot fever's pains. In fine, he wears no limb about him sound, With sores and sicknesses beleaguered round. Ask me their names, I sooner could relate How many drudges on salt Hippia wait; What crowds of patients the town doctor kills, Or how, last fall, he raised the weekly bills; What provinces by Basilus were spoiled; What herds of heirs by guardians are beguiled; How many bouts a-day that bitch has tried; How many boys that pedagogue can ride; What lands and lordships for their owner know My quondam barber, but his worship now. This dotard of his broken back complains; One his legs fail, and one his shoulder pains: Another is of both his eyes bereft, And envies who has one for aiming left; A fifth, with trembling lips expecting stands As in his childhood, crammed by others' hands; One, who at sight of supper opened wide His jaws before, and whetted grinders tried, Now only yawns, and waits to be supplied; Like a young swallow, when, with weary wings, Expected food her fasting mother brings. His loss of members is a heavy curse, But all his faculties decayed, a worse. His servants' names he has forgotten quite; Knows not his friend who supped with him last night: Not even the children he begot and bred; Or his will knows them not; for, in their stead, In form of law, a common hackney jade, Sole heir, for secret services, is made: So lewd, and such a battered brothel whore, That she defies all comers at her door. Well, yet suppose his senses are his own, He lives to be chief mourner for his son: Before his face, his wife and brother burns; He numbers all his kindred in their urns. These are the fines he pays for living long, And dragging tedious age in his own wrong; Griefs always green, a household still in tears, Sad pomps, a threshold thronged with daily biers, And liveries of black for length of years. Next to the raven's age, the Pylian king Nestor, King of Pylus; who was three hundred years old, according to Homer's account; at least as he is understood by his expositors. Was longest lived of any two-legged thing. Blest, to defraud the grave so long, to mount His numbered years, and on his right hand count! The ancients counted by their fingers; their left hands served them till they came up to an hundred; after that they used their right, to express all greater numbers. Three hundred seasons, guzzling must of wine!— But hold a while, and hear himself repine At fate's unequal laws, and at the clew Which, merciless in length, the midmost sister drew. The Fates were three sisters, who had all some peculiar business assigned them by the poets, in relation to the lives of men. The first held the distaff, the second spun the thread, and the third cut it. When his brave son upon the funeral pyre He saw extended, and his beard on fire, He turned, and, weeping, asked his friends, what crime Had cursed his age to this unhappy time? Thus mourned old Peleus for Achilles slain, And thus Ulysses' father did complain. How fortunate an end had Priam made, Among his ancestors a mighty shade, While Troy yet stood; when Hector, with the race Of royal bastards, might his funeral grace; Amidst the tears of Trojan dames inurned, And by his loyal daughters truly mourned! Had heaven so blest him, he had died before The fatal fleet to Sparta Paris bore: But mark what age produced,—he lived to see His town in flames, his falling monarchy. In fine, the feeble sire, reduced by fate To change his sceptre for a sword, too late, His last effort before Jove's altar tries, A soldier half, and half a sacrifice: Falls like an ox that waits the coming blow, Old and unprofitable to the plough. Whilst Troy was sacking by the Greeks, old King Priam is said to have buckled on his armour to oppose them; which he had no sooner done, but he was met by Pyrrhus, and slain before the altar of Jupiter, in his own palace; as we have the story finely told in Virgil's second Æneid. At least he died a man: his queen survived, To howl, and in a barking body lived. Hecuba, his queen, escaped the swords of the Grecians, and outlived him. It seems she behaved herself so fiercely and uneasily to her husband's murderers while she lived, that the poets thought fit to turn her into a bitch when she died. I hasten to our own; nor will relate Great Mithridates, Mithridates, after he had disputed the empire of the world for forty years together, with the Romans, was at last deprived of life and empire by Pompey the Great. and rich Crœsus' fate; Crœsus, in the midst of his prosperity, making his boast to Solon how happy he was, received this answer from the wise man,—that no one could pronounce himself happy, till he saw what his end should be. The truth of this Crœsus found, when he was put in chains by Cyrus, and condemned to die. Whom Solon wisely counselled to attend The name of happy, till he knew his end. That Marius was an exile, that he fled, Was ta'en, in ruined Carthage begged his bread; All these were owing to a life too long: For whom had Rome beheld so happy, young? High in his chariot, and with laurel crowned, When he had led the Cimbrian captives round The Roman streets, descending from his state, In that blest hour he should have begged his fate; Then, then, he might have died of all admired, And his triumphant soul with shouts expired. Campania, Fortune's malice to prevent, To Pompey an indulgent fever sent; But public prayers imposed on heaven to give Their much loved leader an unkind reprieve; The city's fate and his conspired to save The head reserved for an Egyptian slave. Pompey, in the midst of his glory, fell into a dangerous fit of sickness, at Naples. A great many cities then made public supplications for him. He recovered; was beaten at Pharsalia; fled to Ptolemy, King of Egypt; and, instead of receiving protection at his court, had his head struck off by his order, to please Cæsar. Cethegus, though a traitor to the State, And tortured, 'scaped this ignominious fate; Cethegus was one that conspired with Catiline, and was put to death by the Senate. And Sergius, who a bad cause bravely tried, All of a piece, and undiminished, died. Sergius Catiline died fighting. To Venus, the fond mother makes a prayer, That all her sons and daughters may be fair: True, for the boys a mumbling vow she sends, But for the girls the vaulted temple rends: They must be finished pieces; 'tis allowed Diana's beauty made Latona proud, And pleased to see the wondering people pray To the new-rising sister of the day. And yet Lucretia's fate would bar that vow; And fair Virginia Virginia was killed by her own father, to prevent her being exposed to the lust of Appius Claudius, who had ill designs upon her. The story at large is in Livy's third book; and it is a remarkable one, as it gave occasion to the putting down the power of the Decemviri, of whom Appius was one. would her fate bestow On Rutila, and change her faultless make For the foul rumple of her camel back. But, for his mother's boy, the beau, what frights His parents have by day, what anxious nights! Form joined with virtue is a sight too rare; Chaste is no epithet to suit with fair. Suppose the same traditionary strain Of rigid manners in the house remain; Inveterate truth, an old plain Sabine's heart; Suppose that nature too has done her part, Infused into his soul a sober grace, And blushed a modest blood into his face, (For nature is a better guardian far Than saucy pedants, or dull tutors are;) Yet still the youth must ne'er arrive at man, (So much almighty bribes and presents can;) Even with a parent, where persuasions fail, Money is impudent, and will prevail. We never read of such a tyrant king, Who gelt a boy deformed, to hear him sing; Nor Nero, in his more luxurious rage, E'er made a mistress of an ugly page: Sporus, his spouse, nor crooked was, nor lame, With mountain back, and belly, from the game Cross-barred; but both his sexes well became. Go, boast your springald, by his beauty curst To ills, nor think I have declared the worst; His form procures him journey-work; a strife Betwixt town-madams, and the merchant's wife: Guess, when he undertakes this public war, What furious beasts offended cuckolds are. Adulterers are with dangers round beset; Born under Mars, they cannot 'scape the net; And, from revengeful husbands, oft have tried Worse handling than severest laws provide: One stabs, one slashes, one, with cruel art, Makes colon suffer for the peccant part. But your Endymion, your smooth smock-faced boy, Unrivalled, shall a beauteous dame enjoy. Not so: one more salacious, rich, and old, Outbids, and buys her pleasure for her gold: Now, he must moil, and drudge, for one he loathes; She keeps him high in equipage and clothes; She pawns her jewels, and her rich attire, And thinks the workman worthy of his hire. In all things else immoral, stingy, mean, But, in her lusts, a conscionable quean. “She may be handsome, yet be chaste,” you say;— Good observator, not so fast away; Did it not cost the modest youth his life, Who shunned the embraces of his father's wife? Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, was loved by his mother-in-law, Phædra; but he not complying with her, she procured his death. And was not t'other stripling forced to fly, Who coldly did his patron's queen deny, And pleaded laws of hospitality? Bellerophon, the son of King Glaucus, residing some time at the court of Prœtus, king of the Argives, the queen, Sthenobæa, fell in love with him; but he refusing her, she turned the accusation upon him, and he narrowly escaped Prœtus's vengeance. The ladies charged them home, and turned the tale; With shame they reddened, and with spite grew pale. 'Tis dangerous to deny the longing dame; She loses pity, who has lost her shame. Now Silius wants thy counsel, give advice; Wed Cæsar's wife, or die—the choice is nice. Messalina, wife to the Emperor Claudius, infamous for her lewdness. She set her eyes upon C. Silius, a fine youth; forced him to quit his own wife, and marry her, with all the formalities of a wedding, whilst Claudius Cæsar was sacrificing at Ostia. Upon his return, he put both Silius and her to death. Her comet-eyes she darts on every grace, And takes a fatal liking to his face. Adorned with bridal pomp, she sits in state; The public notaries and aruspex wait; The genial bed is in the garden dressed, The portion paid, and every rite expressed, Which in a Roman marriage is professed. 'Tis no stolen wedding this; rejecting awe, She scorns to marry, but in form of law: In this moot case, your judgment to refuse Is present death, besides the night you lose: If you consent, 'tis hardly worth your pain, A day or two of anxious life you gain; Till loud reports through all the town have past, And reach the prince—for cuckolds hear the last. Indulge thy pleasure, youth, and take thy swing, For not to take is but the self-same thing; Inevitable death before thee lies, But looks more kindly through a lady's eyes. What then remains? are we deprived of will? Must we not wish, for fear of wishing ill? Receive my counsel, and securely move;— Intrust thy fortune to the powers above; Leave them to manage for thee, and to grant What their unerring wisdom sees thee want: In goodness, as in greatness, they excel; Ah, that we loved ourselves but half so well! We, blindly by our headstrong passions led, Are hot for action, and desire to wed; Then wish for heirs; but to the gods alone Our future offspring, and our wives, are known; The audacious strumpet, and ungracious son. Yet, not to rob the priests of pious gain, That altars be not wholly built in vain, Forgive the gods the rest, and stand confined To health of body, and content of mind; A soul, that can securely death defy, And count it nature's privilege to die; Serene and manly, hardened to sustain The load of life, and exercised in pain; Guiltless of hate, and proof against desire, That all things weighs, and nothing can admire; That dares prefer the toils of Hercules, To dalliance, banquet, and ignoble ease. The path to peace is virtue: what I show, Thyself may freely on thyself bestow; Fortune was never worshipped by the wise, But, set aloft by fools, usurps the skies. THE SIXTEENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL. THE ARGUMENT. The Poet in this satire proves, that the condition of a soldier is much better than that of a countryman; first, because a countryman, however affronted, provoked, and struck himself, dares not strike a soldier, who is only to be judged by a court-martial; and, by the law of Camillus, which obliges him not to quarrel without the trenches, he is also assured to have a speedy hearing, and quick dispatch; whereas, the townsman, or peasant, is delayed in his suit by frivolous pretences, and not sure of justice when he is heard in the court. The soldier is also privileged to make a will, and to give away his estate, which he got in war, to whom he pleases, without consideration of parentage, or relations, which is denied to all other Romans. This satire was written by Juvenal when he was a commander in Egypt: it is certainly his, though I think it not finished. And, if it be well observed, you will find he intended an invective against a standing army. What vast prerogatives, my Gallus, are Accruing to the mighty man of war! For if into a lucky camp I light, Though raw in arms, and yet afraid to fight, Befriend me my good stars, and all goes right. One happy hour is to a soldier better, Than mother Juno's Juno was mother to Mars, the god of war; Venus was his mistress. recommending letter, Or Venus, when to Mars she would prefer My suit, and own the kindness done to her. See what our common privileges are; As, first, no saucy citizen shall dare To strike a soldier, nor, when struck, resent The wrong, for fear of further punishment. Not though his teeth are beaten out, his eyes Hang by a string, in bumps his forehead rise, Shall he presume to mention his disgrace, Or beg amends for his demolished face. A booted judge shall sit to try his cause, Not by the statute, but by martial laws; Which old Camillus ordered, Camillus (who being first banished by his ungrateful countrymen the Romans, afterwards returned, and freed them from the Gauls) made a law, which prohibited the soldiers from quarrelling without the camp, lest upon that pretence they might happen to be absent when they ought to be on duty. to confine The brawls of soldiers to the trench and line: A wise provision; and from thence 'tis clear, That officers a soldier's cause should hear; And taking cognisance of wrongs received, An honest man may hope to be relieved. So far 'tis well; but with a general cry, The regiment will rise in mutiny, The freedom of their fellow-rogue demand, And, if refused, will threaten to disband. Withdraw thy action, and depart in peace, The remedy is worse than the disease. This cause is worthy him, who in the hall Would for his fee, and for his client, bawl: The poet names a Modenese lawyer, whom he calls Vagellius, who was so impudent, that he would plead any cause, right or wrong, without shame or fear. But would'st thou, friend, who hast two legs alone, (Which, heaven be praised, thou yet may'st call thy own,) Would'st thou to run the gauntlet these expose To a whole company of hob-nailed shoes? The Roman soldiers wore plates of iron under their shoes, or stuck them with nails, as countrymen do now. Sure the good-breeding of wise citizens Should teach them more good-nature to their shins. Besides, whom canst thou think so much thy friend, Who dares appear thy business to defend? Dry up thy tears, and pocket up the abuse, Nor put thy friend to make a bad excuse; The judge cries out, “Your evidence produce.” Will he, who saw the soldier's mutton-fist, And saw thee mauled, appear within the list, To witness truth? When I see one so brave, The dead, think I, are risen from the grave; And with their long spade beards, and matted hair, Our honest ancestors are come to take the air. Against a clown, with more security, A witness may be brought to swear a lie, Than, though his evidence be full and fair, To vouch a truth against a man of war. More benefits remain, and claimed as rights, Which are a standing army's perquisites. If any rogue vexatious suits advance Against me for my known inheritance, Enter by violence my fruitful grounds, Or take the sacred land-mark Landmarks were used by the Romans almost in the same manner as now; and as we go once a year in procession about the bounds of parishes, and renew them, so they offered cakes upon the stone, or landmark. from my bounds, Those bounds, which with procession and with prayer, And offered cakes, have been my annual care; Or if my debtors do not keep their day, Deny their hands, and then refuse to pay; I must with patience all the terms attend, Among the common causes that depend, Till mine is called; and that long-looked-for day Is still encumbered with some new delay. Perhaps the cloth of state is only spread, The courts of judicature were hung, and spread, as with us; but spread only before the hundred judges were to sit, and judge public causes, which were called by lot. Some of the quorum may be sick a-bed; That judge is hot, and doffs his gown, while this O'er night was boozy, and goes out to piss: So many rubs appear, the time is gone For hearing, and the tedious suit goes on; But buff-and-beltmen never know these cares, No time, nor trick of law, their action bars: Their cause they to an easier issue put; They will be heard, or they lug out, and cut. Another branch of their revenue still Remains, beyond their boundless right to kill, Their father yet alive, empowered to make a will. The Roman soldiers had the privilege of making a will, in their father's lifetime, of what they had purchased in the wars, as being no part of their patrimony. By this will, they had power of excluding their own parents, and giving the estate so gotten to whom they pleased: therefore, says the poet, Coranus (a soldier contemporary with Juvenal, who had raised his fortune by the wars) was courted by his own father, to make him his heir. For what their prowess gained, the law declares Is to themselves alone, and to their heirs: No share of that goes back to the begetter, But if the son fights well, and plunders better, Like stout Coranus, his old shaking sire Does a remembrance in his will desire, Inquisitive of fights, and longs in vain To find him in the number of the slain: But still he lives, and rising by the war, Enjoys his gains, and has enough to spare. For 'tis a noble general's prudent part To cherish valour, and reward desert; Let him be daub'd with lace, live high, and whore; Sometimes be lousy, but be never poor. TRANSLATIONS FROM PERSIUS. THE FIRST SATIRE OF PERSIUS. PROLOGUE TO THE FIRST SATIRE. ARGUMENT OF THE PROLOGUE TO THE FIRST SATIRE. The design of the author was to conceal his name and quality. He lived in the dangerous times of the tyrant Nero, and aims particularly at him in most of his Satires. For which reason, though he was a Roman knight, and of a plentiful fortune, he would appear in this Prologue but a beggarly poet, who writes for bread. After this, he breaks into the business of the First Satire; which is chiefly to decry the poetry then in fashion, and the impudence of those who were endeavouring to pass their stuff upon the world. I never did on cleft Parnassus dream, Nor taste the sacred Heliconian stream; Parnassus and Helicon were hills consecrated to the Muses, and the supposed place of their abode. Parnassus was forked on the top; and from Helicon ran a stream, the spring of which was called the Muses' Well. Nor can remember when my brain, inspired, Was by the Muses into madness fired. My share in pale Pyrene Pyrene, a fountain in Corinth, consecrated also to the Muses. I resign, And claim no part in all the mighty Nine. Statues, with winding ivy crowned, The statues of the poets were crowned with ivy about their brows. belong To nobler poets, for a nobler song; Heedless of verse, and hopeless of the crown, Scarce half a wit, and more than half a clown, Before the shrine Before the shrine; that is, before the shrine of Apollo, in his temple at Rome, called the Palatine. I lay my rugged numbers down. Who taught the parrot human notes to try, Or with a voice endued the chattering pye? 'Twas witty Want, fierce hunger to appease; Want taught their masters, and their masters these. Let gain, that gilded bait, be hung on high, The hungry witlings have it in their eye; Pyes, crows, and daws, poetic presents bring; You say they squeak, but they will swear they sing. THE FIRST SATIRE. IN DIALOGUE BETWIXT THE POET AND HIS FRIEND, OR MONITOR. ARGUMENT. I need not repeat, that the chief aim of the author is against bad poets in this Satire. But I must add, that he includes also bad orators, who began at that time (as Petronius in the beginning of his book tells us) to enervate manly eloquence by tropes and figures, ill placed, and worse applied. Amongst the poets, Persius covertly strikes at Nero, some of whose verses he recites with scorn and indignation. He also takes notice of the noblemen, and their abominable poetry, who, in the luxury of their fortunes, set up for wits and judges. The Satire is in dialogue betwixt the author and his friend, or monitor; who dissuades him from this dangerous attempt of exposing great men. But Persius, who is of a free spirit, and has not forgotten that Rome was once a commonwealth, breaks through all those difficulties, and boldly arraigns the false judgment of the age in which he lives. The reader may observe, that our poet was a Stoic philosopher; and that all his moral sentences, both here and in all the rest of his Satires, are drawn from the dogmas of that sect. Persius. How anxious are our cares, and yet how vain The bent of our desires! Friend. Thy spleen contain; For none will read thy satires. Persius. This to me? Friend. None, or, what's next to none, but two or three. 'Tis hard, I grant. Persius. 'Tis nothing; I can bear, That paltry scribblers have the public ear; That this vast universal fool, the town, Should cry up Labeo's stuff, Nothing is remaining of Atticus Labeo (so he is called by the learned Casaubon); nor is he mentioned by any other poet besides Persius. Casaubon, from an old commentator on Persius, says that he made a very foolish translation of Homer's Iliads. and cry me down. They damn themselves; nor will my muse descend To clap with such, who fools and knaves commend: Their smiles and censures are to me the same; I care not what they praise, or what they blame. In full assemblies let the crowd prevail; I weigh no merit by the common scale. The conscience is the test of every mind; “Seek not thyself, without thyself, to find.” But where's that Roman—Somewhat I would say, But fear—let fear, for once, to truth give way. Truth lends the Stoic courage; when I look On human acts, and read in Nature's book, From the first pastimes of our infant age, To elder cares, and man's severer page; When stern as tutors, and as uncles hard, We lash the pupil, and defraud the ward, Then, then I say—or would say, if I durst— But, thus provoked, I must speak out, or burst. Friend. Once more forbear. Persius. I cannot rule my spleen; My scorn rebels, and tickles me within. First, to begin at home:—our authors write In lonely rooms, secured from public sight; Whether in prose, or verse, 'tis all the same, The prose is fustian, and the numbers lame: All noise, and empty pomp, a storm of words, Labouring with sound, that little sense affords. They comb, and then they order every hair; A gown, or white, or scoured to whiteness, wear, A birthday jewel bobbing at their ear; He describes a poet, preparing himself to rehearse his works in public, which was commonly performed in August. A room was hired, or lent, by some friend; a scaffold was raised, and a pulpit placed for him who was to hold forth; who borrowed a new gown, or scoured his old one, and adorned his ears with jewels, etc. Next, gargle well their throats; and, thus prepared, They mount, a-God's name, to be seen and heard; From their high scaffold, with a trumpet cheek, And ogling all their audience ere they speak. The nauseous nobles, even the chief of Rome, With gaping mouths to these rehearsals come, And pant with pleasure, when some lusty line The marrow pierces, and invades the chine; At open fulsome bawdry they rejoice, And slimy jests applaud with broken voice. Base prostitute! thus dost thou gain thy bread? Thus dost thou feed their ears, and thus art fed? At his own filthy stuff he grins and brays, And gives the sign where he expects their praise. Why have I learned, say'st thou, if thus confined, I choke the noble vigour of my mind? Know, my wild fig-tree, which in rocks is bred, Will split the quarry, and shoot out the head. Trees of that kind grow wild in many parts of Italy, and make their way through rocks, sometimes splitting the tombstones. Fine fruits of learning! old ambitious fool, Darest thou apply that adage of the school, As if 'tis nothing worth that lies concealed, And “science is not science till revealed”? Oh, but 'tis brave to be admired, to see The crowd, with pointing fingers, cry,—That's he; That's he, whose wondrous poem is become A lecture for the noble youth of Rome! Who, by their fathers, is at feasts renowned, And often quoted when the bowls go round. Full gorged and flushed, they wantonly rehearse, And add to wine the luxury of verse. One, clad in purple, not to lose his time, Eats and recites some lamentable rhyme, Some senseless Phyllis, in a broken note, Snuffling at nose, and croaking in his throat. Then graciously the mellow audience nod; Is not the immortal author made a god? Are not his manes blest, such praise to have? Lies not the turf more lightly on his grave? And roses (while his loud applause they sing) Stand ready from his sepulchre to spring? All these, you cry, but light objections are, Mere malice, and you drive the jest too far: For does there breathe a man, who can reject A general fame, and his own lines neglect? In cedar tablets The Romans wrote on cedar and cypress tables, in regard of the duration of the wood. Ill verses might justly be afraid of frankincense; for the papers in which they were written, were fit for nothing but to wrap it up. worthy to appear, That need not fish, or frankincense, to fear? Thou, whom I make the adverse part to bear, Be answered thus:—If I by chance succeed In what I write (and that's a chance indeed), Know, I am not so stupid, or so hard, Not to feel praise, or fame's deserved reward; But this I cannot grant, that thy applause Is my work's ultimate, or only cause. Prudence can ne'er propose so mean a prize; For mark what vanity within it lies. Like Labeo's Iliads, in whose verse is found Nothing but trifling care, and empty sound; Such little elegies as nobles write, Who would be poets, in Apollo's spite. Them and their woful works the Muse defies; Products of citron beds, Writings of noblemen, whose bedsteads were of the wood of citron. and golden canopies. To give thee all thy due, thou hast the heart To make a supper, with a fine dessert, And to thy thread-bare friend a cast old suit impart. Thus bribed, thou thus bespeak'st him—“Tell me, friend, (For I love truth, nor can plain speech offend,) What says the world of me and of my muse?” The poor dare nothing tell but flattering news; But shall I speak? Thy verse is wretched rhyme, And all thy labours are but loss of time. Thy strutting belly swells, thy paunch is high; Thou writ'st not, but thou pissest poetry. All authors to their own defects are blind; Hadst thou but, Janus-like, Janus was the first king of Italy, who refuged Saturn when he was expelled, by his son Jupiter, from Crete (or, as we now call it, Candia). From his name the first month of the year is called January. He was pictured with two faces, one before and one behind—as regarding the past time and the future. Some of the mythologists think he was Noah, for the reason given above. a face behind, To see the people, what splay-mouths they make; To mark their fingers, pointed at thy back; Their tongues lolled out, a foot beyond the pitch, When most athirst, of an Apulian bitch: But noble scribblers are with flattery fed, For none dare find their faults, who eat their bread. To pass the poets of patrician blood, What is't the common reader takes for good? The verse in fashion is, when numbers flow, Soft without sense, and without spirit slow; So smooth and equal, that no sight can find The rivet, where the polished piece was joined; So even all, with such a steady view, As if he shut one eye to level true. Whether the vulgar vice his satire stings, The people's riots, or the rage of kings, The gentle poet is alike in all; His reader hopes no rise, and fears no fall. Friend. Hourly we see some raw pin-feathered thing Attempt to mount, and fights and heroes sing; Who for false quantities was whipt at school But t'other day, and breaking grammar-rule; Whose trivial art was never tried above The bare description of a native grove; Who knows not how to praise the country store, The feasts, the baskets, nor the fatted boar, Nor paint the flowery fields that paint themselves before; Where Romulus was bred, and Quintius born, He speaks of the country in the foregoing verses; the praises of which are the most easy theme for poets, but which a bad poet cannot naturally describe: then he makes a digression to Romulus, the first king of Rome, who had a rustical education; and enlarges upon Quintius Cincinnatus, a Roman senator, who was called from the plough to be dictator of Rome. Whose shining plough-share was in furrows worn, Met by his trembling wife returning home, And rustically joyed, as chief of Rome: She wiped the sweat from the Dictator's brow, And o'er his back his robe did rudely throw; The lictors bore in state their lord's triumphant plough. Some love to hear the fustian poet roar, And some on antiquated authors pore; Rummage for sense, and think those only good Who labour most, and least are understood. When thou shalt see the blear-eyed fathers teach Their sons this harsh and mouldy sort of speech, Or others new affected ways to try, Of wanton smoothness, female poetry; One would inquire from whence this motley style Did first our Roman purity defile. For our old dotards cannot keep their seat, But leap and catch at all that's obsolete. Others, by foolish ostentation led, When called before the bar, to save their head, Bring trifling tropes, instead of solid sense, And mind their figures more than their defence; Are pleased to hear their thick-skulled judges cry, Well moved, oh finely said, and decently! Theft (says the accuser) to thy charge I lay, O Pedius: what does gentle Pedius say? Studious to please the genius of the times, With periods, points, and tropes, Persius here names antitheses, or seeming contradictions; which, in this place, are meant for rhetorical flourishes, as I think, with Casaubon. he slurs his crimes: “He robbed not, but he borrowed from the poor, “And took but with intention to restore.” He lards with flourishes his long harangue; 'Tis fine, say'st thou;—what, to be praised, and hang? Effeminate Roman, shall such stuff prevail To tickle thee, and make thee wag thy tail? Say, should a shipwrecked sailor sing his woe, Wouldst thou be moved to pity, or bestow An alms? What's more preposterous than to see A merry beggar, mirth in misery? Persius. He seems a trap for charity to lay, And cons, by night, his lesson for the day. Friend. But to raw numbers, and unfinished verse, Sweet sound is added now, to make it terse: “'Tis tagged with rhyme, like Berecynthian Atys, The mid-part chimes with art, which never flat is. Foolish verses of Nero, which the poet repeats; and which cannot be translated properly into English. The dolphin brave, that cuts the liquid wave, Or he who in his line can chine the long-ribbed Apennine.” Persius. All this is doggrel stuff. Friend. What if I bring A nobler verse? “Arms and the man I sing.” Persius. Why name you Virgil with such fops as these? He's truly great, and must for ever please: Not fierce, but awful, is his manly page; Bold is his strength, but sober is his rage. Friend. What poems think you soft, and to be read With languishing regards, and bending head? Persius. “Their crooked horns the Mimallonian crew With blasts inspired; Other verses of Nero, that were mere bombast. I only note, that the repetition of these and the former verses of Nero, might justly give the poet a caution to conceal his name. and Bassaris, who slew The scornful calf, with sword advanced on high, Made from his neck his haughty head to fly: And Mænas, when with ivy bridles bound, She led the spotted lynx, then Evion rung around; Evion from woods and floods repairing echoes sound.” Could such rude lines a Roman mouth become, Were any manly greatness left in Rome? Mænas and Atys Poems on the Mænades, who were priestesses of Bacchus; and of Atys, who made himself an eunuch to attend on the sacrifices of Cybele, called Berecynthia by the poets. She was mother of the gods. in the mouth were bred, And never hatched within the labouring head; No blood from bitten nails those poems drew, But churned, like spittle, from the lips they flew. Friend. 'Tis fustian all; 'tis execrably bad; But if they will be fools, must you be mad? Your satires, let me tell you, are too fierce; The great will never bear so blunt a verse. Their doors are barred against a bitter flout; Snarl, if you please, but you shall snarl without. Expect such pay as railing rhymes deserve; You're in a very hopeful way to starve. Persius. Rather than so, uncensured let them be; All, all is admirably well, for me. My harmless rhyme shall 'scape the dire disgrace Of common-shores, and every pissing-place. Two painted serpents Two snakes, twined with each other, were painted on the walls, by the ancients, to show the place was holy. shall on high appear; 'Tis holy ground; you must not urine here. This shall be writ, to fright the fry away, Who draw their little baubles when they play. Yet old Lucilius Lucilius wrote long before Horace, who imitates his manner of satire, but far excels him in the design. never feared the times, But lashed the city, and dissected crimes. Mutius and Lupus both by name he brought; He mouthed them, and betwixt his grinders caught. Unlike in method, with concealed design, Did crafty Horace his low numbers join; And, with a sly insinuating grace, Laughed at his friend, and looked him in the face; Would raise a blush where secret vice he found, And tickle while he gently probed the wound, With seeming innocence the crowd beguiled, But made the desperate passes when he smiled. Could he do this, and is my muse controlled By servile awe? Born free, and not be bold? At least, I'll dig a hole within the ground, And to the trusty earth commit the sound; The reeds shall tell you what the poet fears, “King Midas has a snout, and ass's ears.” The story is vulgar, that Midas, king of Phrygia, was made judge betwixt Apollo and Pan, who was the best musician: he gave the prize to Pan; and Apollo, in revenge, gave him ass's ears. He wore his hair long to hide them; but his barber discovering them, and not daring to divulge the secret, dug a hole in the ground, and whispered into it: the place was marshy; and, when the reeds grew up, they repeated the words which were spoken by the barber. By Midas, the poet meant Nero. This mean conceit, this darling mystery, Which thou think'st nothing, friend, thou shalt not buy; Nor will I change for all the flashy wit, That flattering Labeo in his Iliads writ. Thou, if there be a thou in this base town, Who dares, with angry Eupolis, to frown; He who, with bold Cratinus, is inspired With zeal, Eupolis and Cratinus, as also Aristophanes, mentioned afterwards, were all Athenian poets; who wrote that sort of comedy which was called the Old Comedy, where the people were named who were satirised by those authors. and equal indignation fired; Who at enormous villainy turns pale, And steers against it with a full-blown sail, Like Aristophanes, let him but smile On this my honest work, though writ in homely style; And if two lines or three in all the vein Appear less drossy, read those lines again. May they perform their author's just intent, Glow in thy ears, and in thy breast ferment! But from the reading of my book and me, Be far, ye foes of virtuous poverty; Who fortune's fault upon the poor can throw, The people of Rome, in the time of Persius, were apt to scorn the Grecian philosophers, particularly the Cynics and Stoics, who were the poorest of them. Point at the tattered coat, and ragged shoe; Lay nature's failings to their charge, and jeer The dim weak eye-sight, when the mind is clear; When thou thyself, thus insolent in state, Art but, perhaps, some country magistrate, Whose power extends no further than to speak Big on the bench, and scanty weights to break. Him also for my censor I disdain, Who thinks all science, as all virtue, vain; Who counts geometry, and numbers, toys, And with his foot the sacred dust destroys; Arithmetic and geometry were taught on floors, which were strewed with dust, or sand; in which the numbers and diagrams were made and drawn, which they might strike out at pleasure. Whose pleasure is to see a strumpet tear A cynic's beard, and lug him by the hair. Such all the morning to the pleadings run; But when the business of the day is done, On dice, and drink, and drabs, they spend their afternoon. THE SECOND SATIRE OF PERSIUS. DEDICATED TO HIS FRIEND PLOTIUS MACRINUS, ON HIS BIRTHDAY. THE ARGUMENT. This Satire contains a most grave and philosophical argument, concerning prayers and wishes. Undoubtedly it gave occasion to Juvenal's Tenth Satire; and both of them had their original from one of Plato's dialogues, called the “Second Alcibiades.” Our author has induced it with great mystery of art, by taking his rise from the birthday of his friend; on which occasions prayers were made, and sacrifices offered by the native. Persius, commending, first, the purity of his friend's vows, descends to the impious and immoral requests of others. The satire is divided into three parts. The first is the exordium to Macrinus, which the poet confines within the compass of four verses: the second relates to the matter of the prayers and vows, and an enumeration of those things wherein men commonly sinned against right reason and offended in their requests: the third part consists in showing the repugnancies of those prayers and wishes to those of other men, and inconsistencies with themselves. He shows the original of these vows, and sharply inveighs against them; and, lastly, not only corrects the false opinion of mankind concerning them, but gives the true doctrine of all addresses made to heaven, and how they may be made acceptable to the powers above, in excellent precepts, and more worthy of a Christian than a Heathen. Let this auspicious morning be exprest With a white stone, The Romans were used to mark their fortunate days, or anything that luckily befell them, with a white stone, which they had from the island Creta, and their unfortunate with a coal. distinguished from the rest, White as thy fame, and as thy honour clear, And let new joys attend on thy new added year. Indulge thy genius, and o'erflow thy soul, Till thy wit sparkle, like the cheerful bowl. Pray; for thy prayers the test of heaven will bear, Nor need'st thou take the gods aside to hear; While others, even the mighty men of Rome, Big swelled with mischief, to the temples come, And in low murmurs, and with costly smoke, Heaven's help to prosper their black vows, invoke: So boldly to the gods mankind reveal What from each other they, for shame, conceal. “Give me good fame, ye powers, and make me just;” Thus much the rogue to public ears will trust: In private then,—“When wilt thou, mighty Jove, My wealthy uncle from this world remove?” Or, “O thou Thunderer's son, great Hercules, That once thy bounteous deity would please To guide my rake upon the chinking sound Of some vast treasure, hidden under ground! Hercules was thought to have the key and power of bestowing all hidden treasure. “O were my pupil fairly knocked o' the head, I should possess the estate if he were dead! He's so far gone with rickets, and with the evil, That one small dose would send him to the devil. “This is my neighbour Nerius his third spouse, Of whom in happy time he rids his house; But my eternal wife!—Grant, heaven, I may Survive to see the fellow of his day!” Thus, that thou may'st the better bring about Thy wishes, thou art wickedly devout; In Tiber ducking thrice, by break of day, To wash the obscenities of night away. The ancients thought themselves tainted and polluted by night itself, as well as bad dreams in the night; and therefore purified themselves by washing their heads and hands every morning, which custom the Turks observe to this day. But pr'ythee, tell me ('tis a small request), With what ill thoughts of Jove art thou possest? Wouldst thou prefer him to some man? Suppose I dipped among the worst, and Staius chose? Which of the two would thy wise head declare The trustier tutor to an orphan heir? Or, put it thus:—Unfold to Staius, straight, What to Jove's ear thou didst impart of late: He'll stare, and Oh, good Jupiter! will cry, Canst thou indulge him in this villainy? And think'st thou Jove himself with patience then Can hear a prayer condemned by wicked men? That, void of care, he lolls supine in state, And leaves his business to be done by fate, Because his thunder splits some burly tree, And is not darted at thy house and thee; Or that his vengeance falls not at the time, Just at the perpetration of thy crime, And makes thee a sad object of our eyes, Fit for Ergenna's prayer and sacrifice? When any one was thunderstruck, the soothsayer (who is here called Ergenna) immediately repaired to the place, to expiate the displeasure of the gods, by sacrificing two sheep. What well-fed offering to appease the God, What powerful present to procure a nod, Hast thou in store? What bribe hast thou prepared, To pull him, thus unpunished, by the beard? Our superstitions with our life begin; The poet laughs at the superstitious ceremonies which the old women made use of in their lustration, or purification days, when they named their children, which was done on the eighth day to females, and on the ninth to males. The obscene old grandam, or the next of kin, The new-born infant from the cradle takes, And, first, of spittle a lustration makes; Then in the spawl her middle-finger dips, Anoints the temples, forehead, and the lips, Pretending force of magic to prevent, By virtue of her nasty excrement; Then dandles him with many a muttered prayer, That heaven would make him some rich miser's heir, Lucky to ladies, and in time a king; Which to ensure, she adds a length of navel-string. But no fond nurse is fit to make a prayer, And Jove, if Jove be wise, will never hear; Not though she prays in white, with lifted hands. A body made of brass the crone demands For her loved nursling, strung with nerves of wire, Tough to the last, and with no toil to tire; Unconscionable vows, which when we use, We teach the gods, in reason, to refuse. Suppose they were indulgent to thy wish, Yet the fat entrails in the spacious dish Would stop the grant; the very over-care And nauseous pomp, would hinder half the prayer. Thou hop'st with sacrifice of oxen slain To compass wealth, and bribe the god of gain To give thee flocks and herds, with large increase; Fool! to expect them from a bullock's grease! And think'st that when the fattened flames aspire, Thou seest the accomplishment of thy desire! “Now, now, my bearded harvest gilds the plain, The scanty folds can scarce my sheep contain, And showers of gold come pouring in amain!” Thus dreams the wretch, and vainly thus dreams on, Till his lank purse declares his money gone. Should I present them with rare figured plate, Or gold as rich in workmanship as weight; O how thy rising heart would throb and beat, And thy left side, with trembling pleasure, sweat! Thou measur'st by thyself the powers divine; Thy gods are burnished gold, and silver is their shrine. The puny godlings of inferior race, Whose humble statues are content with brass, Should some of these, in visions purged from phlegm, Foretell events, or in a morning dream; It was the opinion both of Grecians and Romans, that the gods, in visions and dreams, often revealed to their favourites a cure for their diseases, and sometimes those of others. Thus Alexander dreamed of an herb which cured Ptolemy. These gods were principally Apollo and Esculapius; but, in aftertimes, the same virtue and goodwill was attributed to Isis and Osiris. Which brings to my remembrance an odd passage in Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, or in his Vulgar Errors; the sense whereof is, that we are beholden, for many of our discoveries in physic, to the courteous revelation of spirits. By the expression of “visions purged from phlegm,” our author means such dreams or visions as proceed not from natural causes, or humours of the body, but such as are sent from heaven; and are, therefore, certain remedies. Even those thou wouldst in veneration hold, And, if not faces, give them beards of gold. The priests in temples now no longer care For Saturn's brass, Brazen vessels, in which the public treasures of the Romans were kept: it may be the poet means only old vessels, which were called ??????, from the Greek name of Saturn. Note also, that the Roman treasury was in the temple of Saturn. or Numa's earthen ware; Under Numa, the second king of Rome, and for a long time after him, the holy vessels for sacrifice were of earthenware; according to the superstitious rites which were introduced by the same Numa: though afterwards, when Memmius had taken Corinth, and Paulus Emilius had conquered Macedonia, luxury began amongst the Romans, and then their utensils of devotion were of gold and silver, etc. Or vestal urns, in each religious rite; This wicked gold has put them all to flight. O souls, in whom no heavenly fire is found, Fat minds, and ever grovelling on the ground! We bring our manners to the blest abodes, And think what pleases us must please the gods. Of oil and cassia one the ingredients takes, And, of the mixture, a rich ointment makes; Another finds the way to dye in grain, And makes Calabrian wool The wool of Calabria was of the finest sort in Italy, as Juvenal also tells us. The Tyrian stain is the purple colour dyed at Tyrus; and I suppose, but dare not positively affirm, that the richest of that dye was nearest our crimson, and not scarlet, or that other colour more approaching to the blue. I have not room to justify my conjecture. receive the Tyrian stain; Or from the shells their orient treasure takes, Or for their golden ore in rivers rakes, Then melts the mass. All these are vanities, Yet still some profit from their pains may rise: But tell me, priest, if I may be so bold, What are the gods the better for this gold? The wretch, that offers from his wealthy store These presents, bribes the powers to give him more; As maids to Venus offer baby-toys, Those baby-toys were little babies, or poppets, as we call them; in Latin, pupæ: which the girls, when they came to the age of puberty, or child-bearing, offered to Venus; as the boys, at fifteen, offered their bullæ, or bosses. To bless the marriage-bed with girls and boys. But let us for the gods a gift prepare, Which the great man's great chargers cannot bear; A soul, where laws, both human and divine, In practice more than speculation shine; A genuine virtue, of a vigorous kind, Pure in the last recesses of the mind: When with such offerings to the gods I come, A cake, thus given, is worth a hecatomb. A cake of barley, or coarse wheat-meal, with the bran in it: the meaning is, that God is pleased with the pure and spotless heart of the offerer, and not with the riches of the offering. Laberius, in the fragments of his Mimes, has a verse like this, “Puras Deus non plenas aspicit manus.”—What I had forgotten before, in its due place, I must here tell the reader, that the first half of this satire was translated by one of my sons, now in Italy; but I thought so well of it, that I let it pass without any alteration. THE THIRD SATIRE OF PERSIUS. THE ARGUMENT. Our author has made two Satires concerning study, the first and the third: the first related to men; this to young students, whom he desired to be educated in the Stoic philosophy. He himself sustains the person of the master, or preceptor, in this admirable Satire, where he upbraids the youth of sloth, and negligence in learning. Yet he begins with one scholar reproaching his fellow-students with late rising to their books. After which, he takes upon him the other part of the teacher; and, addressing himself particularly to young noblemen, tells them, that, by reason of their high birth, and the great possessions of their fathers, they are careless of adorning their minds with precepts of moral philosophy: and withal inculcates to them the miseries which will attend them in the whole course of their life, if they do not apply themselves betimes to the knowledge of virtue, and the end of their creation, which he pathetically insinuates to them. The title of this satire, in some ancient manuscripts, was, “The Reproach of Idleness;” though in others of the scholiasts it is inscribed, “Against the Luxury and Vices of the Rich.” In both of which, the intention of the poet is pursued, but principally in the former. (I remember I translated this satire when I was a king's scholar at Westminster School, for a Thursday-night's exercise; and believe that it, and many other of my exercises of this nature in English verse, are still in the hands of my learned master, the Rev. Dr. Busby.) Is this thy daily course? The glaring sun Breaks in at every chink; the cattle run To shades, and noon-tide rays of summer shun; Yet plunged in sloth we lie, and snore supine, As filled with fumes of undigested wine. This grave advice some sober student bears, And loudly rings it in his fellow's ears. The yawning youth, scarce half awake, essays His lazy limbs and dozy head to raise; Then rubs his gummy eyes, and scrubs his pate, And cries, “I thought it had not been so late! My clothes, make haste!”—why then, if none be near, He mutters, first, and then begins to swear; And brays aloud, with a more clamorous note, Than an Arcadian ass can stretch his throat. With much ado, his book before him laid, And parchment with the smoother side displayed, The students used to write their notes on parchments; the inside, on which they wrote, was white; the other side was hairy, and commonly yellow. Quintilian reproves this custom, and advises rather table-books, lined with wax, and a style, like that we use in our vellum table-books, as more easy. He takes the papers; lays them down again, And with unwilling fingers tries the pen. Some peevish quarrel straight he strives to pick, His quill writes double, or his ink's too thick; Infuse more water,—now 'tis grown so thin, It sinks, nor can the characters be seen. O wretch, and still more wretched every day! Are mortals born to sleep their lives away? Go back to what thy infancy began, Thou, who wert never meant to be a man; Eat pap and spoon-meat, for thy gewgaws cry; Be sullen, and refuse the lullaby. No more accuse thy pen; but charge the crime On native sloth, and negligence of time. Think'st thou thy master, or thy friends, to cheat? Fool, 'tis thyself, and that's a worse deceit. Beware the public laughter of the town; Thou spring'st a leak already in thy crown; A flaw is in thy ill-baked vessel found; 'Tis hollow, and returns a jarring sound. Yet thy moist clay is pliant to command, Unwrought, and easy to the potter's hand: Now take the mould; now bend thy mind to feel The first sharp motions of the forming wheel. But thou hast land; a country seat, secure By a just title; costly furniture; A fuming pan thy Lares to appease: Before eating, it was customary to cut off some part of the meat, which was first put into a pan, or little dish, then into the fire, as an offering to the household gods: this they called a libation. What need of learning when a man's at ease? If this be not enough to swell thy soul, Then please thy pride, and search the herald's roll, Where thou shalt find thy famous pedigree Drawn from the root of some old Tuscan tree, The Tuscans were accounted of most ancient nobility, Horace observes this in most of his compliments to Mæcenas, who was derived from the old kings of Tuscany; now the dominion of the Great Duke. And thou, a thousand off, a fool of long degree; Who, clad in purple, canst thy censor greet, The Roman knights, attired in the robe called trabea, were summoned by the censor to appear before him, and to salute him in passing by, as their names were called over. They led their horses in their hands. See more of this in Pompey's Life, written by Plutarch. And loudly call him cousin in the street. Such pageantry be to the people shown: There boast thy horse's trappings, and thy own. I know thee to thy bottom, from within Thy shallow centre, to the utmost skin: Dost thou not blush to live so like a beast, So trim, so dissolute, so loosely drest? But 'tis in vain; the wretch is drenched too deep, His soul is stupid, and his heart asleep; Fattened in vice, so callous, and so gross, He sins, and sees not, senseless of his loss. Down goes the wretch at once, unskilled to swim, Hopeless to bubble up, and reach the water's brim. Great father of the gods, when for our crimes Thou send'st some heavy judgment on the times; Some tyrant-king, the terror of his age, The type, and true vicegerent of thy rage; Thus punish him: set virtue in his sight, With all her charms adorned, with all her graces bright; But set her distant, make him pale to see His gains outweighed by lost felicity! Sicilian tortures, and the brazen bull, Some of the Sicilian kings were so great tyrants, that the name is become proverbial. The brazen bull is a known story of Phalaris, one of those tyrants, who, when Perillus, a famous artist, had presented him with a bull of that metal hollowed within, which, when the condemned person was inclosed in it, would render the sound of a bull's roaring, caused the workman to make the first experiment—docuitque suum mugire juvencum. Are emblems, rather than express the full Of what he feels; yet what he fears is more: The wretch, who, sitting at his plenteous board, Looked up, and viewed on high the pointed sword Hang o'er his head, and hanging by a twine, Did with less dread, and more securely dine. He alludes to the story of Damocles, a flatterer of one of those Sicilian tyrants, namely Dionysius. Damocles had infinitely extolled the happiness of kings: Dionysius, to convince him of the contrary, invited him to a feast, and clothed him in purple; but caused a sword, with the point downward, to be hung over his head by a silken twine; which, when he perceived, he could eat nothing of the delicates that were set before him. Even in his sleep he starts, and fears the knife, And, trembling, in his arms takes his accomplice wife; Down, down he goes; and from his darling friend Conceals the woes his guilty dreams portend. When I was young, I, like a lazy fool, Would blear my eyes with oil, to stay from school: Averse from pains, and loth to learn the part Of Cato, dying with a dauntless heart; Though much my master that stern virtue praised, Which o'er the vanquisher the vanquished raised; And my pleased father came with pride to see His boy defend the Roman liberty. But then my study was to cog the dice, And dexterously to throw the lucky sice; To shun ames-ace, that swept my stakes away, And watch the box, for fear they should convey False bones, and put upon me in the play; Careful, besides, the whirling top to whip, And drive her giddy, till she fell asleep. Thy years are ripe, nor art thou yet to learn What's good or ill, and both their ends discern: Thou in the Stoic-porch, The Stoics taught their philosophy under a porticus, to secure their scholars from the weather. Zeno was the chief of that sect. severely bred, Hast heard the dogmas of great Zeno read; Where on the walls, by Polygnotus' hand, The conquered Medians in trunk-breeches stand; Polygnotus, a famous painter, who drew the pictures of the Medes and Persians conquered by Miltiades, Themistocles, and other Athenian captains, on the walls of the portico, in their natural habits. Where the shorn youth to midnight lectures rise, Roused from their slumbers to be early wise; Where the coarse cake, and homely husks of beans, From pampering riot the young stomach weans; And where the Samian Y directs thy steps to run To Virtue's narrow steep, and broad-way Vice to shun. Pythagoras, of Samos, made the allusion of the Y, or Greek upsilon, to Vice and Virtue. One side of the letter being broad, characters Vice, to which the ascent is wide and easy; the other side represents Virtue, to which the passage is strait and difficult; and perhaps our Saviour might also allude to this, in those noted words of the evangelist, “The way to heaven,” etc. And yet thou snor'st, thou draw'st thy drunken breath, Sour with debauch, and sleep'st the sleep of death: Thy chaps are fallen, and thy frame disjoined; Thy body is dissolved as is thy mind. Hast thou not yet proposed some certain end, To which thy life, thy every act, may tend? Hast thou no mark, at which to bend thy bow? Or, like a boy, pursuest the carrion crow With pellets, and with stones, from tree to tree, A fruitless toil, and livest extempore? Watch the disease in time; for when within The dropsy rages, and extends the skin, In vain for hellebore the patient cries, And fees the doctor, but too late is wise; Too late, for cure he proffers half his wealth; Conquest and Guibbons cannot give him health. Learn, wretches, learn the motions of the mind, Why you were made, for what you were designed, And the great moral end of humankind. Study thyself, what rank, or what degree, The wise Creator has ordained for thee; And all the offices of that estate Perform, and with thy prudence guide thy fate. Pray justly to be heard, nor more desire Than what the decencies of life require. Learn what thou owest thy country, and thy friend; What's requisite to spare, and what to spend: Learn this; and after, envy not the store Of the greased advocate, that grinds the poor; Fat fees Casaubon here notes, that, among all the Romans who were brought up to learning, few, besides the orators or lawyers, grew rich. from the defended Umbrian draws, And only gains the wealthy client's cause; To whom the Marsians more provision send, Than he and all his family can spend. Gammons, that give a relish to the taste, And potted fowl, and fish come in so fast, That ere the first is out, the second stinks, And mouldy mother gathers on the brinks. But here some captain of the land, or fleet, Stout of his hands, but of a soldier's wit, Cries, “I have sense to serve my turn in store, And he's a rascal who pretends to more. Damn me, whate'er those book-learned blockheads say, Solon's the veriest fool in all the play. Top-heavy drones, and always looking down, (As over-ballasted within the crown,) Muttering betwixt their lips some mystic thing, Which, well examined, is flat conjuring; Mere madmen's dreams; for what the schools have taught, Is only this, that nothing can be brought From nothing, and what is can ne'er be turned to nought. Is it for this they study? to grow pale, And miss the pleasures of a glorious meal? For this, in rags accoutred, are they seen, And made the May-game of the public spleen?” Proceed, my friend, and rail; but hear me tell A story, which is just thy parallel:— A spark, like thee, of the man-killing trade, Fell sick, and thus to his physician said,— “Methinks I am not right in every part; I feel a kind of trembling at my heart, My pulse unequal, and my breath is strong, Besides a filthy fur upon my tongue.” The doctor heard him, exercised his skill, And after bade him for four days be still. Three days he took good counsel, and began To mend, and look like a recovering man; The fourth he could not hold from drink, but sends His boy to one of his old trusty friends, Adjuring him, by all the powers divine, To pity his distress, who could not dine Without a flagon of his healing wine. He drinks a swilling draught; and, lined within, Will supple in the bath his outward skin: Whom should he find but his physician there, Who wisely bade him once again beware. “Sir, you look wan, you hardly draw your breath; Drinking is dangerous, and the bath is death.” “'Tis nothing,” says the fool; “But,” says the friend, “This nothing, sir, will bring you to your end. Do I not see your dropsy belly swell? Your yellow skin?”—“No more of that; I'm well. I have already buried two or three That stood betwixt a fair estate and me, And, doctor, I may live to bury thee. Thou tell'st me, I look ill; and thou look'st worse.” “I've done,” says the physician; “take your course.” The laughing sot, like all unthinking men, Bathes, and gets drunk; then bathes, and drinks again: His throat half throttled with corrupted phlegm, And breathing through his jaws a belching steam, Amidst his cups with fainting shivering seized, His limbs disjointed, and all o'er diseased, His hand refuses to sustain the bowl, And his teeth chatter, and his eye-balls roll, Till with his meat he vomits out his soul. Then trumpets, torches, and a tedious crew Of hireling mourners, for his funeral due. Our dear departed brother lies in state, His heels stretched out, and pointing to the gate; And slaves, now manumized, on their dead master wait. They hoist him on the bier, and deal the dole, And there's an end of a luxurious fool. “But what's thy fulsome parable to me? My body is from all diseases free; My temperate pulse does regularly beat; Feel, and be satisfied, my hands and feet: These are not cold, nor those opprest with heat. Or lay thy hand upon my naked heart, And thou shalt find me hale in every part.” I grant this true; but still the deadly wound Is in thy soul, 'tis there thou art not sound. Say, when thou seest a heap of tempting gold, Or a more tempting harlot dost behold; Then, when she casts on thee a sidelong glance, Then try thy heart, and tell me if it dance. Some coarse cold salad is before thee set; Bread with the bran, perhaps, and broken meat; Fall on, and try thy appetite to eat. These are not dishes for thy dainty tooth: What, hast thou got an ulcer in thy mouth? Why stand'st thou picking? Is thy palate sore, That beet and radishes will make thee roar? Such is the unequal temper of thy mind, Thy passions in extremes, and unconfined; Thy hair so bristles with unmanly fears, As fields of corn, that rise in bearded ears; And when thy cheeks with flushing fury glow, The rage of boiling caldrons is more slow, When fed with fuel and with flames below. With foam upon thy lips and sparkling eyes, Thou say'st, and dost, in such outrageous wise, That mad Orestes, Orestes was son to Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. Agamemnon, at his return from the Trojan wars, was slain by Ægysthus, the adulterer of Clytemnestra. Orestes, to revenge his father's death, slew both Ægysthus and his mother; for which he was punished with madness by the Eumenides, or Furies, who continually haunted him. if he saw the show, Would swear thou wert the madder of the two. THE FOURTH SATIRE OF PERSIUS. THE ARGUMENT. Our author, living in the time of Nero, was contemporary and friend to the noble poet Lucan. Both of them were sufficiently sensible, with all good men, how unskilfully he managed the commonwealth; and perhaps might guess at his future tyranny by some passages during the latter part of his first five years; though he broke not out into his great excesses, while he was restrained by the counsels and authority of Seneca. Lucan has not spared him in the poem of his Pharsalia; for this very compliment looked asquint, as well as at Nero. The compliment, at the opening of the Pharsalia, has been thought sarcastic. It certainly sounds so in modern ears: if Nero could only attain empire by civil war, as the gods by that of the giants, then says the poet, — Scelera ipsa nefasque Hac mercede placent — Persius has been bolder, but with caution likewise. For here, in the person of young Alcibiades, he arraigns his ambition of meddling with state-affairs without judgment, or experience. It is probable that he makes Seneca, in this satire, sustain the part of Socrates, under a borrowed name; and, withal, discovers some secret vices of Nero, concerning his lust, his drunkenness, and his effeminacy, which had not yet arrived to public notice. He also reprehends the flattery of his courtiers, who endeavoured to make all his vices pass for virtues. Covetousness was undoubtedly none of his faults; but it is here described as a veil cast over the true meaning of the poet, which was to satirise his prodigality and voluptuousness; to which he makes a transition. I find no instance in history of that emperor's being a Pathic, though Persius seems to brand him with it. From the two dialogues of Plato, both called “Alcibiades,” the poet took the arguments of the second and third satires; but he inverted the order of them, for the third satire is taken from the first of those dialogues. The commentators before Casaubon were ignorant of our author's secret meaning; and thought he had only written against young noblemen in general, who were too forward in aspiring to public magistracy: but this excellent scholiast has unravelled the whole mystery, and made it apparent, that the sting of the satire was particularly aimed at Nero. Whoe'er thou art, whose forward years are bent On State affairs, to guide the government; Hear first what Socrates Socrates, whom the oracle of Delphos praised as the wisest man of his age, lived in the time of the Peloponnesian war. He, finding the uncertainty of natural philosophy, applied himself wholly to the moral. He was master to Xenophon and Plato, and to many of the Athenian young noblemen; amongst the rest to Alcibiades, the most lovely youth then living; afterwards a famous captain, whose life is written by Plutarch. of old has said To the loved youth, whom he at Athens bred. “Tell me, thou pupil to great Pericles, Our second hope, my Alcibiades, Pericles was tutor, or rather overseer, of the will of Clinias, father to Alcibiades. While Pericles lived, who was a wise man, and an excellent orator, as well as a great general, the Athenians had the better of the war. What are the grounds from whence thou dost prepare To undertake, so young, so vast a care? Perhaps thy wit; (a chance not often heard, That parts and prudence should prevent the beard;) 'Tis seldom seen, that senators so young Know when to speak, and when to hold their tongue. Sure thou art born to some peculiar fate, When the mad people rise against the State, To look them into duty, and command An awful silence with thy lifted hand; Then to bespeak them thus:—‘Athenians, know Against right reason all your counsels go; This is not fair, nor profitable that, Nor t'other question proper for debate.’ But thou, no doubt, canst set the business right, And give each argument its proper weight; Know'st, with an equal hand, to hold the scale; Seest where the reasons pinch, and where they fail, And where exceptions o'er the general rule prevail; And, taught by inspiration, in a trice, Canst punish crimes, That is, by death. When the judges would condemn a malefactor, they cast their votes into an urn; as according to the modern custom, a balloting-box. If the suffrages were marked with ?, they signified the sentence of death to the offender; as being the first letter of ???????, which, in English, is death. and brand offending vice. “Leave, leave to fathom such high points as these, Nor be ambitious, e'er thy time, to please, Unseasonably wise; till age and cares Have formed thy soul to manage great affairs. Thy face, thy shape, thy outside, are but vain; Thou hast not strength such labours to sustain; Drink hellebore, The poet would say, that such an ignorant young man, as he here describes, is fitter to be governed himself than to govern others. He therefore advises him to drink hellebore, which purges the brain. my boy; drink deep, and purge thy brain. “What aim'st thou at, and whither tends thy care, In what thy utmost good? Delicious fare; And then, to sun thyself in open air. “Hold, hold; are all thy empty wishes such? A good old woman would have said as much. But thou art nobly born: 'tis true; go boast Thy pedigree, the thing thou valuest most: Besides, thou art a beau; what's that, my child? A fop, well drest, extravagant, and wild: She that cries herbs, has less impertinence, And in her calling more of common sense. “None, none descends into himself, to find The secret imperfections of his mind; But every one is eagle-eyed, to see Another's faults, and his deformity. Say, dost thou know Vectidius?” The name of Vectidius is here used appellatively, to signify any rich covetous man, though perhaps there might be a man of that name then living. I have translated this passage paraphrastically, and loosely; and leave it for those to look on, who are not unlike the picture.—“Who? the wretch Whose lands beyond the Sabines largely stretch; Cover the country, that a sailing kite Can scarce o'erfly them in a day and night; Him dost thou mean, who, spite of all his store, Is ever craving, and will still be poor? Who cheats for half-pence, and who doffs his coat, To save a farthing in a ferry-boat? Ever a glutton at another's cost, But in whose kitchen dwells perpetual frost? Who eats and drinks with his domestic slaves, A verier hind than any of his knaves? Born with the curse and anger of the gods, And that indulgent genius he defrauds? At harvest-home, and on the shearing-day, When he should thanks to Pan and Pales pay, And better Ceres, Pan, the god of shepherds, and Pales, the goddess presiding over rural affairs; whom Virgil invocates in the beginning of his second Georgic. I give the epithet of better to Ceres, because she first taught the use of corn for bread, as the poets tell us; men, in the first rude ages, feeding only on acorns, or mast, instead of bread. trembling to approach The little barrel, which he fears to broach; He 'says the wimble, often draws it back, And deals to thirsty servants but a smack. To a short meal he makes a tedious grace, Before the barley-pudding comes in place: Then bids fall on; himself, for saving charges, A peeled sliced onion eats, and tipples verjuice?” “Thus fares the drudge: but thou, whose life's a dream Of lazy pleasures, tak'st a worse extreme. 'Tis all thy business, business how to shun; To bask thy naked body in the sun; Suppling thy stiffened joints with fragrant oil: Then, in thy spacious garden walk awhile, To suck the moisture up, and soak it in; And this, thou think'st, but vainly think'st, unseen. But know, thou art observed; and there are those, Who, if they durst, would all thy secret sins expose; The depilation of thy modest part; Thy catamite, the darling of thy heart, His engine-hand, and every lewder art, When, prone to bear, and patient to receive, Thou tak'st the pleasure which thou canst not give. With odorous oil thy head and hair are sleek, And then thou kemb'st the tuzzes on thy cheek; Of these thy barbers take a costly care, While thy salt tail is overgrown with hair Not all thy pincers, nor unmanly arts, Can smooth the roughness of thy shameful parts. Not five, the strongest that the Circus breeds, The learned Holyday (who has made us amends for his bad poetry in this and the rest of these satires, with his excellent illustrations), here tells us, from good authority, that the number five does not allude to the five fingers of one man, but to five strong men, such as were skilful in the five robust exercises then in practice at Rome, and were performed in the circus, or public place ordained for them. These five he reckons up in this manner: 1. The cæstus, or whirlbats, described by Virgil in his fifth Æneid; and this was the most dangerous of all the rest. The 2d was the foot-race. The 3d, the discus, like the throwing a weighty ball, a sport now used in Cornwall, and other parts of England; we may see it daily practised in Red-Lion Fields. The 4th was the saltus or leaping; and the 5th, wrestling naked and besmeared with oil. They who practised in these five manly exercises were called ?????????. From the rank soil can root those wicked weeds, Though suppled first with soap, to ease thy pain; The stubborn fern springs up, and sprouts again. “Thus others we with defamations wound, While they stab us, and so the jest goes round. Vain are thy hopes, to 'scape censorious eyes; Truth will appear through all the thin disguise: Thou hast an ulcer which no leach can heal, Though thy broad shoulder-belt the wound conceal. Say thou art sound and hale in every part, We know, we know thee rotten at thy heart. We know thee sullen, impotent, and proud: Nor canst thou cheat thy nerve, who cheat'st the crowd.” “But when they praise me in the neighbourhood, When the pleased people take me for a god, Shall I refuse their incense? Not receive The loud applauses which the vulgar give?” “If thou dost wealth with longing eyes behold, And greedily art gaping after gold; If some alluring girl, in gliding by, Shall tip the wink, with a lascivious eye, And thou, with a consenting glance, reply; If thou thy own solicitor become, And bidst arise the lumpish pendulum; If thy lewd lust provokes an empty storm, And prompts to more than nature can perform; If, with thy guards, thou scour'st the streets by night, And dost in murders, rapes, and spoils delight; Persius durst not have been so bold with Nero as I dare now; and therefore there is only an intimation of that in him which I publicly speak; I mean, of Nero's walking the streets by night in disguise, and committing all sorts of outrages, for which he was sometimes well beaten. Please not thyself, the flattering crowd to hear, 'Tis fulsome stuff to feed thy itching ear. Reject the nauseous praises of the times; Give thy base poets back their cobbled rhymes: Survey thy soul, not what thou dost appear, But what thou art, and find the beggar there.” Look into thyself, and examine thy own conscience; there thou shalt find that, how wealthy soever thou appearest to the world, yet thou art but a beggar; because thou art destitute of all virtues, which are the riches of the soul. This also was a paradox of the Stoic school. THE FIFTH SATIRE OF PERSIUS. INSCRIBED TO THE REV. DR. BUSBY. THE SPEAKERS PERSIUS AND CORNUTUS. THE ARGUMENT. The judicious Casaubon, in his proem to this Satire, tells us that Aristophanes, the grammarian, being asked what poem of Archilochus' iambics he preferred before the rest, answered, the longest. His answer may justly be applied to the Fifth Satire; which, being of a greater length than any of the rest, is also by far the most instructive. For this reason I have selected it from all the others, and inscribed it to my learned master, Dr. Busby; to whom I am not only obliged myself for the best part of my own education, and that of my two sons; but have also received from him the first and truest taste of Persius. May he be pleased to find, in this translation, the gratitude, or at least some small acknowledgment, of his unworthy scholar, at the distance of forty-two years from the time when I departed from under his tuition. This Satire consists of two distinct parts: the first contains the praises of the Stoic philosopher, Cornutus, master and tutor to our Persius; it also declares the love and piety of Persius to his well-deserving master; and the mutual friendship which continued betwixt them, after Persius was now grown a man; as also his exhortation to young noblemen, that they would enter themselves into his institution. From hence he makes an artful transition into the second part of his subject; wherein he first complains of the sloth of scholars, and afterwards persuades them to the pursuit of their true liberty. Here our author excellently treats that paradox of the Stoics which affirms that the wise or virtuous man is only free, and that all vicious men are naturally slaves; and, in the illustration of this dogma, he takes up the remaining part of this inimitable Satire. PERSIUS. Of ancient use to poets it belongs, To wish themselves an hundred mouths and tongues: Whether to the well-lunged tragedian's rage They recommend their labours of the stage, Or sing the Parthian, when transfixed he lies, Wrenching the Roman javelin from his thighs. CORNUTUS. And why would'st thou these mighty morsels choose, Of words unchewed, and fit to choke the muse? Let fustian poets with their stuff begone, And suck the mists that hang o'er Helicon; When Progne, Progne was wife to Tereus, king of Thracia. Tereus fell in love with Philomela, sister to Progne, ravished her, and cut out her tongue; in revenge of which, Progne killed Itys, her own son by Tereus, and served him up at a feast, to be eaten by his father. or Thyestes' Thyestes and Atreus were brothers, both kings. Atreus, to revenge himself of his unnatural brother, killed the sons of Thyestes, and invited him to eat them. feast they write; And, for the mouthing actor, verse indite. Thou neither like a bellows swell'st thy face, As if thou wert to blow the burning mass Of melting ore; nor canst thou strain thy throat, Or murmur in an undistinguished note, Like rolling thunder, till it breaks the cloud, And rattling nonsense is discharged aloud. Soft elocution does thy style renown, And the sweet accents of the peaceful gown: Gentle or sharp, according to thy choice, To laugh at follies, or to lash at vice. Hence draw thy theme, and to the stage permit Raw-head and bloody-bones, and hands and feet, Ragouts for Tereus or Thyestes drest; 'Tis task enough for thee t'expose a Roman feast. PERSIUS. 'Tis not, indeed, my talent to engage In lofty trifles, or to swell my page With wind and noise; but freely to impart, As to a friend, the secrets of my heart, And, in familiar speech, to let thee know How much I love thee, and how much I owe Knock on my heart; for thou hast skill to find If it sound solid, or be filled with wind; And, through the veil of words, thou view'st the naked mind. For this a hundred voices I desire, To tell thee what an hundred tongues would tire, Yet never could be worthily exprest,— How deeply thou art seated in my breast. When first my childish robe By the childish robe is meant the Prœtexta, or first gowns which the Roman children of quality wore. These were welted with purple; and on those welts were fastened the bullæ, or little bells; which, when they came to the age of puberty, were hung up, and consecrated to the Lares, or household gods. resigned the charge, And left me, unconfined, to live at large; When now my golden bulla (hung on high To household gods) declared me past a boy, And my white shield proclaimed my liberty; The first shields which the Roman youths wore were white, and without any impress or device on them, to show they had yet achieved nothing in the wars. When, with my wild companions, I could roll From street to street, and sin without control; Just at that age, when manhood set me free, I then deposed myself, and left the reins to thee; On thy wise bosom I reposed my head, And by my better Socrates was bred. Socrates, by the oracle, was declared to be the wisest of mankind: he instructed many of the Athenian young noblemen in morality, and amongst the rest Alcibiades. Then thy straight rule set virtue in my sight, The crooked line reforming by the right. My reason took the bent of thy command, Was formed and polished by thy skilful hand; Long summer-days thy precepts I rehearse, And winter-nights were short in our converse; One was our labour, one was our repose, One frugal supper did our studies close. Sure on our birth some friendly planet shone; And, as our souls, our horoscope Astrologers divide the heaven into twelve parts, according to the number of the twelve signs of the zodiac. The sign, or constellation, which rises in the east at the birth of any man, is called the Ascendant: Persius therefore judges that Cornutus and he had the same or a like nativity. was one: Whether the mounting Twins did heaven adorn, Or with the rising Balance we were born; Both have the same impressions from above, And both have Saturn's rage, repelled by Jove. Astrologers have an axiom, that whatsoever Saturn ties is loosed by Jupiter. They account Saturn to be a planet of a malevolent nature, and Jupiter of a propitious influence. What star I know not, but some star, I find, Has given thee an ascendant o'er my mind. CORNUTUS. Nature is ever various in her frame; Each has a different will, and few the same. The greedy merchants, led by lucre, run To the parched Indies, and the rising sun; From thence hot pepper and rich drugs they bear, Bartering for spices their Italian ware; The lazy glutton safe at home will keep, Indulge his sloth, and batten with his sleep: One bribes for high preferments in the state; A second shakes the box, and sits up late; Another shakes the bed, dissolving there, Till knots upon his gouty joints appear, And chalk is in his crippled fingers found; Rots, like a doddered oak, and piecemeal falls to ground; Then his lewd follies he would late repent, And his past years, that in a mist were spent. PERSIUS. But thou art pale in nightly studies grown, To make the Stoic institutes thy own: Zeno was the great master of the Stoic philosophy; and Cleanthes was second to him in reputation. Cornutus, who was master or tutor to Persius, was of the same school. Thou long, with studious care, hast tilled our youth, And sown our well-purged ears with wholesome truth. From thee both old and young with profit learn The bounds of good and evil to discern. CORNUTUS. Unhappy he who does this work adjourn, And to to-morrow would the search delay; His lazy morrow will be like to-day. PERSIUS. But is one day of ease too much to borrow? CORNUTUS. Yes, sure; for yesterday was once to-morrow. That yesterday is gone, and nothing gained, And all thy fruitless days will thus be drained; For thou hast more to-morrows yet to ask, And wilt be ever to begin thy task; Who, like the hindmost chariot-wheels, art curst, Still to be near, but ne'er to reach the first. O freedom, first delight of humankind! Not that which bondmen from their masters find, The privilege of doles; When a slave was made free, he had the privilege of a Roman born; which was to have a share in the donatives, or doles of bread, etc., which were distributed by the magistrates among the people. nor yet to inscribe Their names in this or t'other Roman tribe; The Roman people was distributed into several tribes. He who was made free was enrolled into some one of them; and thereupon enjoyed the common privileges of a Roman citizen. That false enfranchisement with ease is found, Slaves are made citizens by turning round. The master who intended to enfranchise a slave carried him before the city prætor, and turned him round, using these words, “I will that this man be free.” “How,” replies one, “can any be more free? Here's Dama, once a groom of low degree, Not worth a farthing, and a sot beside, So true a rogue, for lying's sake he lied; But, with a turn, a freeman he became, Now Marcus Dama is his worship's name. Slaves had only one name before their freedom; after it they were admitted to a prænomen like our christened names: so Dama is now called Marcus Dama. Good gods! who would refuse to lend a sum, If wealthy Marcus surety will become! Marcus is made a judge, and for a proof Of certain truth, ‘He said it,’ is enough. A will is to be proved;—put in your claim;— 'Tis clear, if Marcus has subscribed his name. At the proof of a testament, the magistrates were to subscribe their names, as allowing the legality of the will. This is true liberty, as I believe; What further can we from our caps receive, Than as we please without control to live? Slaves, when they were set free, had a cap given them, in sign of their liberty. Not more to noble Brutus Brutus freed the Roman people from the tyranny of the Tarquins, and changed the form of the government into a glorious commonwealth. could belong.” “Hold,” says the Stoic, “your assumption's wrong: I grant true freedom you have well defined: But, living as you list, and to your mind, Are loosely tacked, and must be left behind.” “What! since the prætor did my fetters loose, And left me freely at my own dispose, May I not live without control or awe, Excepting still the letter of the law?” The text of the Roman laws was written in red letters, which was called the Rubric; translated here, in more general words, “The letter of the law.” “Hear me with patience, while thy mind I free From those fond notions of false liberty: 'Tis not the prætor's province to bestow True freedom; nor to teach mankind to know What to ourselves, or to our friends, we owe. He could not set thee free from cares and strife, Nor give the reins to a lewd vicious life: As well he for an ass a harp might string, Which is against the reason of the thing; For reason still is whispering in your ear, Where you are sure to fail, the attempt forbear. No need of public sanctions this to bind, Which nature has implanted in the mind,— Not to pursue the work, to which we're not designed. Unskilled in hellebore, if thou should'st try To mix it, and mistake the quantity, The rules of physic would against thee cry. The high-shoed ploughman, should he quit the land, To take the pilot's rudder in his hand, Artless of stars, and of the moving sand, The gods would leave him to the waves and wind, And think all shame was lost in humankind. Tell me, my friend, from whence hadst thou the skill, So nicely to distinguish good from ill? Or by the sound to judge of gold and brass, What piece is tinkers' metal, what will pass? And what thou art to follow, what to fly, This to condemn, and that to ratify? When to be bountiful, and when to spare, But never craving, or oppressed with care? The baits of gifts, and money to despise, And look on wealth with undesiring eyes? When thou canst truly call these virtues thine, Be wise and free, by heaven's consent and mine. But thou, who lately of the common strain Wert one of us, if still thou dost retain The same ill habits, the same follies too, Glossed over only with a saint-like show, Then I resume the freedom which I gave; Still thou art bound to vice, and still a slave. Thou canst not wag thy finger, or begin The least light motion, but it tends to sin.” “How's this? Not wag my finger?” he replies. “No, friend; nor fuming gums, nor sacrifice, Can ever make a madman free, or wise. ‘Virtue and vice are never in one soul; A man is wholly wise, or wholly is a fool.’ The Stoics held this paradox, that any one vice, or notorious folly, which they called madness, hindered a man from being virtuous; that a man was of a piece, without a mixture, either wholly vicious, or good; one virtue or vice, according to them, including all the rest. A heavy bumpkin, taught with daily care, Can never dance three steps with a becoming air.” PERSIUS. In spite of this, my freedom still remains. CORNUTUS. Free! what? and fettered with so many chains? Canst thou no other master understand Than him that freed thee by the prætor's wand? The prætor held a wand in his hand, with which he softly struck the slave on the head, when he declared him free. Should he, who was thy lord, command thee now, With a harsh voice, and supercilious brow, To servile duties, thou wouldst fear no more; The gallows and the whip are out of door. But if thy passions lord it in thy breast, Art thou not still a slave, and still opprest? Whether alone, or in thy harlot's lap, When thou wouldst take a lazy morning's nap, “Up, up,” says Avarice;—thou snor'st again, Stretchest thy limbs, and yawn'st, but all in vain; The tyrant Lucre no denial takes; At his command the unwilling sluggard wakes. “What must I do?” he cries.—“What?” says his lord; “Why rise, make ready, and go straight aboard; With fish, from Euxine seas, thy vessel freight; Flax, castor, Coan wines, the precious weight Of pepper, and Sabæan incense, take, With thy own hands, from the tired camel's back, And with post haste thy running markets make. Be sure to turn the penny; lie and swear, 'Tis wholesome sin.”—“But Jove,” thou say'st, “will hear.”— “Swear, fool, or starve; for the dilemma's even: A tradesman thou, and hope to go to heaven!” Resolved for sea, the slaves thy baggage pack, Each saddled with his burden on his back: Nothing retards thy voyage now, unless Thy other lord forbids, Voluptuousness: And he may ask this civil question,—“Friend, What dost thou make a-shipboard? to what end? Art thou of Bethlem's noble college free, Stark, staring mad, that thou wouldst tempt the sea? Cubbed in a cabin, on a mattress laid, On a brown george with lousy swobbers fed, Dead wine, that stinks of the borrachio, sup From a foul jack, or greasy maple-cup? Say, wouldst thou bear all this, to raise thy store From six i' the hundred, to six hundred more? Indulge, and to thy genius freely give; For, not to live at ease, is not to live; Death stalks behind thee, and each flying hour Does some loose remnant of thy life devour. Live while thou liv'st; for death will make us all A name, a nothing but an old wife's tale.” Speak; wilt thou Avarice, or Pleasure, choose To be thy lord? Take one, and one refuse. But both by turns the rule of thee will have, And thou betwixt them both wilt be a slave. Nor think when once thou hast resisted one, That all thy marks of servitude are gone: The struggling greyhound gnaws his leash in vain, If, when 'tis broken, still he drags the chain. Says Phædria to his man, This alludes to the play of Terence, called “The Eunuch;” which was excellently imitated of late in English, by Sir Charles Sedley. In the first scene of that comedy Phædria was introduced with his man, Pamphilus, discoursing whether he should leave his mistress Thais, or return to her, now that she had invited him. “Believe me, friend, To this uneasy love I'll put an end.” “Shall I run out of all, my friends disgrace, And be the first lewd unthrift of my race? Shall I the neighbour's nightly rest invade At her deaf doors, with some vile serenade?” “Well hast thou freed thyself,” his man replies, “Go, thank the gods, and offer sacrifice.” “Ah,” says the youth, “if we unkindly part, Will not the poor fond creature break her heart?” “Weak soul! and blindly to destruction led! She break her heart! she'll sooner break your head. She knows her man, and when you rant and swear, Can draw you to her with a single hair.” “But shall I not return? Now, when she sues! Shall I my own and her desires refuse?” “Sir, take your course; but my advice is plain: Once freed, 'tis madness to resume your chain.” Ay; there's the man, who, loosed from lust and pelf, Less to the prætor owes than to himself. But write him down a slave, who, humbly proud, With presents begs preferments from the crowd; He who sued for any office amongst the Romans was called a candidate, because he wore a white gown; and sometimes chalked it, to make it appear whiter. He rose early, and went to the levees of those who headed the people; saluted also the tribes severally, when they were gathered together to choose their magistrates; and distributed a largess amongst them, to engage them for their voices; much resembling our elections of Parliament-men. That early suppliant, who salutes the tribes, And sets the mob to scramble for his bribes, That some old dotard, sitting in the sun, On holidays may tell, that such a feat was done: In future times this will be counted rare. Thy superstition too may claim a share: When flowers are strewed, and lamps in order placed, And windows with illuminations graced, On Herod's day; The commentators are divided what Herod this was, whom our author mentions; whether Herod the Great, whose birthday might possibly be celebrated, after his death, by the Herodians, a sect amongst the Jews, who thought him their Messiah; or Herod Agrippa, living in the author's time and after it. The latter seems the more probable opinion. when sparkling bowls go round, And tunny's tails in savoury sauce are drowned, Thou mutter'st prayers obscene; nor dost refuse The fasts and Sabbaths of the curtailed Jews. Then a cracked egg-shell thy sick fancy frights, The ancients had a superstition, contrary to ours, concerning egg-shells: they thought that if an egg-shell were cracked, or a hole bored in the bottom of it, they were subject to the power of sorcery. We as vainly break the bottom of an egg-shell, and cross it when we have eaten the egg, lest some hag should make use of it in bewitching us, or sailing over the sea in it, if it were whole. The rest of the priests of Isis, and her one-eyed or squinting priestess, is more largely treated in the Sixth Satire of Juvenal, where the superstitions of women are related. Besides the childish fear of walking sprites. Of o'ergrown gelding priests thou art afraid; The timbrel, and the squintifego maid Of Isis, awe thee; lest the gods for sin, Should with a swelling dropsy stuff thy skin: Unless three garlic heads the curse avert, Eaten each morn devoutly next thy heart. “Preach this among the brawny guards,” say'st thou, “And see if they thy doctrine will allow:” The dull, fat captain, with a hound's deep throat, Would bellow out a laugh in a bass note, And prize a hundred Zenos just as much As a clipt sixpence, or a schilling Dutch. THE SIXTH SATIRE OF PERSIUS. TO CÆSIUS BASSUS, A LYRIC POET. THE ARGUMENT. This Sixth Satire treats an admirable common-place of moral philosophy, of the true uses of riches. They are certainly intended by the Power who bestows them, as instruments and helps of living commodiously ourselves; and of administering to the wants of others, who are oppressed by fortune. There are two extremes in the opinions of men concerning them. One error, though on the right hand, yet a great one, is that they are no helps to a virtuous life; the other places all our happiness in the acquisition and possession of them; and this is undoubtedly the worse extreme. The mean betwixt these, is the opinion of the Stoics, which is, that riches may be useful to the leading a virtuous life; in case we rightly understand how to give according to the right reason, and how to receive what is given us by others. The virtue of giving well is called liberality; and it is of this virtue that Persius writes in this satire, wherein he not only shows the lawful use of riches, but also sharply inveighs against the vices which are opposed to it; and especially of those, which consist in the defects of giving, or spending, or in the abuse of riches. He writes to Cæsius Bassus, his friend, and a poet also: inquires first of his health and studies; and afterwards informs him of his own, and where he is now resident. He gives an account of himself, that he is endeavouring, by little and little, to wear off his vices; and, particularly, that he is combating ambition, and the desire of wealth. He dwells upon the latter vice; and, being sensible that few men either desire, or use, riches as they ought, he endeavours to convince them of their folly, which is the main design of the whole Satire. Has winter caused thee, friend, to change thy seat, All the studious, and particularly the poets, about the end of August, began to set themselves on work, refraining from writing during the heats of the summer. They wrote by night, and sat up the greatest part of it; for which reason the product of their studies was called their elucubrations, or nightly labours. They who had country-seats retired to them while they studied, as Persius did to his, which was near the port of the Moon in Etruria; and Bassus to his, which was in the country of the Sabines, nearer Rome. And seek in Sabine air a warm retreat? Say, dost thou yet the Roman harp command? Do the strings answer to thy noble hand? Great master of the muse, inspired to sing The beauties of the first created spring; The pedigree of nature to rehearse, And sound the Maker's work, in equal verse; Now sporting on thy lyre the loves of youth, This proves Cæsius Bassus to have been a lyric poet. It is said of him, that by an eruption of the flaming mountain Vesuvius, near which the greatest part of his fortune lay, he was burnt himself, together with all his writings. Now virtuous age, and venerable truth; Expressing justly Sappho's wanton art Of odes, and Pindar's more majestic part. For me, my warmer constitution wants More cold, than our Ligurian winter grants; And therefore to my native shores retired, I view the coast old Ennius once admired; Where clifts on either side their points display, And, after opening in an ampler way, Afford the pleasing prospect of the bay. “'Tis worth your while, O Romans, to regard The port of Luna,” says our learned bard; Who in a drunken dream beheld his soul The fifth within the transmigrating roll; I call it a drunken dream of Ennius; not that my author in this place gives me any encouragement for the epithet, but because Horace, and all who mention Ennius, say he was an excessive drinker of wine. In a dream, or vision, call you it which you please, he thought it was revealed to him, that the soul of Pythagoras was transmigrated into him; as Pythagoras before him believed that himself had been Euphorbus in the wars of Troy. Commentators differ in placing the order of this soul, and who had it first. I have here given it to the peacock; because it looks more according to the order of nature, that it should lodge in a creature of an inferior species, and so by gradation rise to the informing of a man. And Persius favours me, by saying, that Ennius was the fifth from the Pythagorean peacock. Which first a peacock, then Euphorbus was, Then Homer next, and next Pythagoras; And, last of all the line, did into Ennius pass. Secure and free from business of the state, And more secure of what the vulgar prate, Here I enjoy my private thoughts, nor care What rots for sheep the southern winds prepare; Survey the neighbouring fields, and not repine, When I behold a larger crop than mine: To see a beggar's brat in riches flow, Adds not a wrinkle to my even brow; Nor, envious at the sight, will I forbear My plenteous bowl, nor bate my bounteous cheer; Nor yet unseal the dregs of wine that stink Of cask, nor in a nasty flagon drink. Let others stuff their guts with homely fare, For men of different inclinations are, Though born perhaps beneath one common star. In minds and manners twins opposed we see In the same sign, almost the same degree: One, frugal, on his birthday fears to dine, Does at a penny's cost in herbs repine, And hardly dares to dip his fingers in the brine; Prepared as priest of his own rites to stand, He sprinkles pepper with a sparing hand. His jolly brother, opposite in sense, Laughs at his thrift; and lavish of expense, Quaffs, crams, and guttles, in his own defence. For me, I'll use my own, and take my share, Yet will not turbots for my slaves prepare; Nor be so nice in taste myself to know If what I swallow be a thrush, or no. Live on thy annual income, spend thy store, And freely grind from thy full threshing floor; Next harvest promises as much, or more. Thus I would live; but friendship's holy band, And offices of kindness, hold my hand: My friend is shipwrecked on the Bruttian strand, Perhaps this is only a fine transition of the poet, to introduce the business of the satire; and not that any such accident had happened to one of the friends of Persius. But, however, this is the most poetical description of any in our author; and since he and Lucan were so great friends, I know not but Lucan might help him in two or three of these verses, which seem to be written in his style; certain it is, that besides this description of a shipwreck, and two lines more which are at the end of the second satire, our poet has written nothing elegantly. I will, therefore, transcribe both the passages, to justify my opinion. The following are the last verses, saving one, of the second satire— Compositum jus, fasque animi; sanctosque recessus Mentis, et incoctum generoso pectus honesto. The others are those in this present satire, which are sub joined— — trabe rupta, Bruttia saxa Prendit amicus inops: remque omnem, surdaque vota Condidit Ionio, jacet ipse in littore, et una Ingentes de puppe Dei, jamque obvia mergis Costa ratis laceræ. His riches in the Ionian main are lost, And he himself stands shivering on the coast; Where, destitute of help, forlorn and bare, He wearies the deaf gods with fruitless prayer. Their images, the relics of the wreck, Torn from the naked poop, are tided back By the wild waves, and, rudely thrown ashore, Lie impotent, nor can themselves restore; The vessel sticks, and shows her opened side, And on her shattered mast the mews in triumph ride. From thy new hope, and from thy growing store, Now lend assistance, and relieve the poor; The Latin is, Nunc et de cespite vivo, frange aliquid. Casaubon only opposes the cespes vivus, which, word for word, is the living turf, to the harvest, or annual income; I suppose the poet rather means, sell a piece of land already sown, and give the money of it to my friend, who has lost all by shipwreck; that is, do not stay till thou hast reaped, but help him immediately, as his wants require. Come, do a noble act of charity, A pittance of thy land will set him free. Let him not bear the badges of a wreck, Nor beg with a blue table on his back; Holyday translates it a green table: the sense is the same; for the table was painted of the sea-colour, which the shipwrecked person carried on his back, expressing his losses, thereby to excite the charity of the spectators. Nor tell me, that thy frowning heir will say, “'Tis mine that wealth thou squander'st thus away:” What is't to thee, if he neglect thy urn? Or without spices lets thy body burn? The bodies of the rich, before they were burnt, were embalmed with spices; or rather spices were put into the urn with the relics of the ashes. Our author here names cinnamum and cassia, which cassia was sophisticated with cherry-gum, and probably enough by the Jews, who adulterate all things which they sell. But whether the ancients were acquainted with the spices of the Molucca Islands, Ceylon, and other parts of the Indies, or whether their pepper and cinnamon, etc., were the same with ours, is another question. As for nutmegs and mace, it is plain that the Latin names for them are modern. If odours to thy ashes he refuse, Or buys corrupted cassia from the Jews? “All these,” the wiser Bestius will reply, “Are empty pomp, and dead-men's luxury:” We never knew this vain expense before The effeminated Grecians brought it o'er: Now toys and trifles from their Athens come, And dates and pepper have unsinewed Rome. Our sweating hinds their salads now defile, Infecting homely herbs with fragrant oil. But to thy fortune be not thou a slave; For what hast thou to fear beyond the grave? And thou, who gap'st for my estate, draw near; For I would whisper somewhat in thy ear. Hear'st thou the news, my friend? the express is come, With laurelled letters, from the camp to Rome: Cæsar salutes the queen and senate thus:— “My arms are on the Rhine victorious. The Cæsar here mentioned is Caius Caligula, who affected to triumph over the Germans, whom he never conquered, as he did over the Britons; and accordingly sent letters, wrapt about with laurels, to the senate and the Empress Cæsonia, whom I here call queen; though I know that name was not used amongst the Romans; but the word empress would not stand in that verse, for which reason I adjourned it to another. The dust, which was to be swept away from the altars, was either the ashes which were left there after the last sacrifice for victory, or might perhaps mean the dust or ashes which were left on the altars since some former defeat of the Romans by the Germans; after which overthrow, the altars had been neglected. From mourning altars sweep the dust away, Cease fasting, and proclaim a fat thanksgiving-day.” The goodly empress, Cæsonia, wife to Caius Caligula, who afterwards, in the reign of Claudius, was proposed, but ineffectually, to be married to him, after he had executed Messalina for adultery. jollily inclined, Is to the welcome bearer wondrous kind; And, setting her good housewifery aside, Prepares for all the pageantry of pride. The captive Germans, of gigantic size, He means only such as were to pass for Germans in the triumph, large-bodied men, as they are still, whom the empress clothed new with coarse garments, for the greater ostentation of the victory. Are ranked in order, and are clad in frize: The spoils of kings, and conquered camps we boast, Their arms in trophies hang on the triumphal post. Now for so many glorious actions done In foreign parts, and mighty battles won; For peace at home, and for the public wealth, I mean to crown a bowl to Cæsar's health. Besides, in gratitude for such high matters, Know I have vowed two hundred gladiators. A hundred pair of gladiators were beyond the purse of a private man to give; therefore this is only a threatening to his heir, that he could do what he pleased with his estate. Say, wouldst thou hinder me from this expense? I disinherit thee, if thou dar'st take offence. Yet more, a public largess I design Of oil and pies, to make the people dine; Control me not, for fear I change my will. And yet methinks I hear thee grumbling still,— “You give as if you were the Persian king; Your land does not so large revenues bring.” Well, on my terms thou wilt not be my heir? If thou car'st little, less shall be my care. Were none of all my father's sisters left; Nay, were I of my mother's kin bereft; None by an uncle's or a grandame's side, Yet I could some adopted heir provide. I need but take my journey half a day From haughty Rome, and at Aricia stay, Where fortune throws poor Manius in my way. Him will I choose:—“What? him of humble birth, Obscure, a foundling, and a son of earth?” Obscure! Why, pr'ythee, what am I? I know My father, grandsire, and great-grandsire too: If further I derive my pedigree, I can but guess beyond the fourth degree. The rest of my forgotten ancestors Were sons of earth, like him, or sons of whores. Yet why shouldst thou, old covetous wretch, aspire To be my heir, who mightst have been my sire? In nature's race, shouldst thou demand of me My torch, when I in course run after thee? Why shouldst thou, who art an old fellow, hope to outlive me, and be my heir, who am much younger? He who was first in the course or race, delivered the torch, which he carried, to him who was second. Think I approach thee, like the god of gain, With wings on head and heels, as poets feign: Thy moderate fortune from my gift receive; Now fairly take it, or as fairly leave. But take it as it is, and ask no more. “What, when thou hast embezzled all thy store? Where's all thy father left?”—'Tis true, I grant, Some I have mortgaged to supply my want: The legacies of Tadius too are flown, All spent, and on the selfsame errand gone. “How little then to my poor share will fall!” Little indeed; but yet that little's all. Nor tell me, in a dying father's tone,— “Be careful still of the main chance, my son; Put out thy principal in trusty hands, Live on the use, and never dip thy lands.” “But yet what's left for me?”—What's left, my friend! Ask that again, and all the rest I spend. Is not my fortune at my own command? Pour oil, and pour it with a plenteous hand Upon my salads, boy: shall I be fed With sodden nettles, and a singed sow's head? 'Tis holiday, provide me better cheer; 'Tis holiday, and shall be round the year. Shall I my household gods and genius cheat, To make him rich who grudges me my meat, That he may loll at ease, and, pampered high, When I am laid, may feed on giblet-pie, And, when his throbbing lust extends the vein, Have wherewithal his whores to entertain? Shall I in homespun cloth be clad, that he His paunch in triumph may before him see? Go, miser, go; for lucre sell thy soul; Truck wares for wares, and trudge from pole to pole, That men may say, when thou art dead and gone, “See what a vast estate he left his son!” How large a family of brawny knaves, Well fed, and fat as Cappadocian slaves! Who were famous for their lustiness, and being, as we call it, in good liking. They were set on a stall when they were exposed to sale, to show the good habit of their body; and made to play tricks before the buyers, to show their activity and strength. Increase thy wealth, and double all thy store; 'Tis done; now double that, and swell the score; To every thousand add ten thousand more. Then say, Chrysippus, Chrysippus, the Stoic, invented a kind of argument, consisting of more than three propositions, which is called sorites, or a heap. But as Chrysippus could never bring his propositions to a certain stint, so neither can a covetous man bring his craving desires to any certain measure of riches, beyond which he could not wish for any more. thou who wouldst confine Thy heap, where I shall put an end to mine. THE WORKS OF VIRGIL, TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH VERSE. RECOMMENDATORY POEMS. TO MR. DRYDEN, ON HIS EXCELLENT TRANSLATION OF VIRGIL. Whene'er great Virgil's lofty verse I see, The pompous scene charms my admiring eye. There different beauties in perfection meet; The thoughts as proper, as the numbers sweet; And, when wild Fancy mounts a daring height, Judgment steps in, and moderates her flight. Wisely he manages his wealthy store, Still says enough, and yet implies still more: For, though the weighty sense be closely wrought, The reader's left to improve the pleasing thought. Hence we despaired to see an English dress Should e'er his nervous energy express; For who could that in fettered rhyme inclose, Which, without loss, can scarce be told in prose? But you, great Sir, his manly genius raise, And make your copy share an equal praise. Oh! how I see thee, in soft scenes of love, Renew those passions he alone could move! Here Cupid's charms are with new art exprest. And pale Eliza leaves her peaceful rest— Leaves her Elysium, as if glad to live, To love, and wish, to sigh, despair, and grieve, And die again for him that would again deceive. Nor does the mighty Trojan less appear Than Mars himself, amidst the storms of war. Now his fierce eyes with double fury glow, And a new dread attends the impending blow: The Daunian chiefs their eager rage abate, And, though unwounded, seem to feel their fate. Long the rude fury of an ignorant age, With barbarous spite, profaned his sacred page. The heavy Dutchmen, with laborious toil, Wrested his sense, and cramped his vigorous style. No time, no pains, the drudging pedants spare, But still his shoulders must the burden bear; While, through the mazes of their comments led, We learn, not what he writes, but what they read. Yet, through these shades of undistinguished night, Appeared some glimmering intervals of light; Till mangled by a vile translating sect, Like babes by witches in effigie rackt: Till Ogleby, mature in dulness, rose, And Holbourn doggrel, and low chiming prose, His strength and beauty did at once depose. But now the magic spell is at an end, Since even the dead, in you, have found a friend. You free the bard from rude oppressors' power, And grace his verse with charms unknown before. He, doubly thus obliged, must doubting stand, Which chiefly should his gratitude command— Whether should claim the tribute of his heart, The patron's bounty, or the poet's art. Alike with wonder and delight we viewed The Roman genius in thy verse renewed: We saw thee raise soft Ovid's amorous fre, And fit the tuneful Horace to thy lyre: We saw new gall embitter Juvenal's pen, And crabbed Persius made politely plain. Virgil alone was thought too great a task— What you could scarce perform, or we durst ask; A task, which Waller's Muse could ne'er engage; A task, too hard for Denham's stronger rage. Sure of success, they some slight sallies tried; But the fenced coast their bold attempts defied: With fear, their o'ermatched forces back they drew, Quitting the province Fate reserved for you. In vain thus Philip did the Persians storm; A work his son was destined to perform. O! had Roscommon lived to hail the day, And sing loud pæans through the crowded way, When you in Roman majesty appear, Which none know better, and none come so near; The happy author would with wonder see, His rules were only prophecies of thee: And, were he now to give translators light, He'd bid them only read thy work, and write. For this great task, our loud applause is due; We own old favours, but must press for new: Th'expecting world demands one labour more; And thy loved Homer does thy aid implore, To right his injured works, and set them free From the lewd rhymes of grovelling Ogleby. Then shall his verse in graceful pomp appear, Nor will his birth renew the ancient jar: On those Greek cities we shall look with scorn, And in our Britain think the poet born. TO MR. DRYDEN, ON HIS TRANSLATION OF VIRGIL. I We read, how dreams and visions heretofore The prophet and the poet could inspire, And make them in unusual rapture soar, With rage divine, and with poetic fire. II O could I find it now!—Would Virgil's shade But for a while vouchsafe to bear the light, To grace my numbers, and that Muse to aid, Who sings the poet that has done him right. III It long has been this sacred author's fate, To lie at every dull translators will: Long, long his Muse has groaned beneath the weight Of mangling Ogleby's presumptuous quill. IV Dryden, at last, in his defence arose: The father now is righted by the son; And, while his Muse endeavours to disclose That poet's beauties, she declares her own. V In your smooth pompous numbers drest, each line, Each thought, betrays such a majestic touch, He could not, had he finished his design, Have wished it better, or have done so much. VI You, like his hero, though yourself were free, And disentangled from the war of wit— You, who secure might others' danger see, And safe from all malicious censure sit— VII Yet, because sacred Virgil's noble Muse, O'erlaid by fools, was ready to expire, To risk your fame again, you boldly choose, Or to redeem, or perish with your sire. VIII Even first and last, we owe him half to you: For, that his Æneids missed their threatened fate, Was—that his friends by some prediction knew, Hereafter, who, correcting, should translate. IX But hold, my Muse! thy needless flight restrain, Unless, like him, thou couldst a verse indite: To think his fancy to describe, is vain, Since nothing can discover light, but light. X 'Tis want of genius that does more deny; 'Tis fear my praise should make your glory less; And, therefore, like the modest painter, I Must draw the veil, where I cannot express. Henry Grahme. TO MR. DRYDEN. No undisputed monarch governed yet, With universal sway, the realms of wit: Nature could never such expense afford; Each several province owned a several lord. A poet then had his poetic wife, One Muse embraced, and married for his life. By the stale thing his appetite was cloyed, His fancy lessened, and his fire destroyed. But Nature, grown extravagantly kind, With all her treasures did adorn your mind; The different powers were then united found, And you wit's universal monarch crowned. Your mighty sway your great desert secures; And every Muse and every Grace is yours. To none confined, by turns you all enjoy: Sated with this, you to another fly, So, sultan-like, in your seraglio stand, While wishing Muses wait for your command; Thus no decay, no want of vigour, find: Sublime your fancy, boundless is your mind. Not all the blasts of Time can do you wrong— Young, spite of age—in spite of weakness, strong. Time, like Alcides, strikes you to the ground; You, like Antæus, from each fall rebound. H. St. John. TO MR. DRYDEN, ON HIS VIRGIL. 'Tis said, that Phidias gave such living grace To the carved image of a beauteous face, That the cold marble might even seem to be The life—and the true life, the imagery. You pass that artist, Sir, and all his powers, Making the best of Roman poets ours, With such effect, we know not which to call The imitation, which the original. What Virgil lent, you pay in equal weight; The charming beauty of the coin no less; And such the majesty of your impress, You seem the very author you translate. 'Tis certain, were he now alive with us, And did revolving destiny constrain To dress his thoughts in English o'er again, Himself could write no otherwise than thus. His old encomium never did appear So true as now: “Romans and Greeks, submit! Something of late is in our language writ, More nobly great than the famed Iliads were.” Ja. Wright. TO MR. DRYDEN, ON HIS TRANSLATIONS. As flowers, transplanted from a southern sky, But hardly bear, or in the raising die, Missing their native sun,—at best retain But a faint odour, and but live with pain; So Roman poetry, by moderns taught, Wanting the warmth with which its author wrote, Is a dead image, and a worthless draught. While we transfuse, the nimble spirit flies, Escapes unseen, evaporates, and dies. Who then attempts to show the ancients' wit, Must copy with the genius that they writ: Whence we conclude from thy translated song, So just, so warm, so smooth, and yet so strong, Thou heavenly charmer! soul of harmony! That all their geniuses revived in thee. Thy trumpet sounds: the dead are raised to light; New-born they rise, and take to heaven their flight; Deck'd in thy verse, as clad with rays, they shine, All glorified, immortal, and divine. As Britain, in rich soil abounding wide, Furnished for use, for luxury, and pride, Yet spreads her wanton sails on every shore, For foreign wealth, insatiate still of more; To her own wool, the silks of Asia joins, And to her plenteous harvests, Indian mines; So Dryden, not contented with the fame Of his own works, though an immortal name— To lands remote he sends his learned Muse, The noblest seeds of foreign wit to choose. Feasting our sense so many various ways, Say, is't thy bounty, or thy thirst of praise, That, by comparing others, all might see, Who most excelled, are yet excelled by thee? George Granville. PASTORALS. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HUGH, LORD CLIFFORD, BARON OF CHUDLEIGH. PASTORAL I. OR, TITYRUS AND MELIBŒUS. ARGUMENT. The occasion of the First Pastoral was this: When Augustus had settled himself in the Roman Empire, that he might reward his veteran troops for their past service, he distributed among them all the lands that lay about Cremona and Mantua; turning out the right owners for having sided with his enemies. Virgil was a sufferer among the rest, who afterwards recovered his estate by Mæcenas' intercession; and, as an instance of his gratitude, composed the following Pastoral, where he sets out his own good fortune in the person of Tityrus, and the calamities of his Mantuan neighbours in the character of Melibœus. MELIBŒUS. Beneath the shade which beechen boughs diffuse, You, Tityrus, entertain your sylvan muse. Round the wide world in banishment we roam, Forced from our pleasing fields and native home; While, stretched at ease, you sing your happy loves, And Amaryllis fills the shady groves. TITYRUS. These blessings, friend, a deity bestowed; For never can I deem him less than God. The tender firstlings of my woolly breed Shall on his holy altar often bleed. He gave my kine to graze the flowery plain, And to my pipe renewed the rural strain. MELIBŒUS. I envy not your fortune, but admire, That, while the raging sword and wasteful fire Destroy the wretched neighbourhood around, No hostile arms approach your happy ground. Far different is my fate; my feeble goats With pains I drive from their forsaken cotes: And this, you see, I scarcely drag along, Who, yeaning, on the rocks has left her young, The hope and promise of my failing fold. My loss, by dire portents, the gods foretold; For, had I not been blind, I might have seen:— Yon riven oak, the fairest of the green, And the hoarse raven, on the blasted bough, With frequent croaks, presaged the coming blow. But tell me, Tityrus, what heavenly power Preserved your fortunes in that fatal hour? TITYRUS. Fool that I was, I thought imperial Rome Like Mantua, where on market days we come, And thither drive our tender lambs from home. So kids and whelps their sires and dams express, And so the great I measured by the less. But country towns, compared with her, appear Like shrubs, when lofty cypresses are near. MELIBŒUS. What great occasion called you hence to Rome? TITYRUS. Freedom, which came at length, though slow to come. Nor did my search of liberty begin, Till my black hairs were changed upon my chin; Nor Amaryllis would vouchsafe a look, Till Galatea's meaner bonds I broke. Till then a helpless, hopeless, homely swain, I sought not freedom, nor aspired to gain: Though many a victim from my folds was bought, And many a cheese to country markets brought, Yet all the little that I got, I spent, And still returned as empty as I went. MELIBŒUS. We stood amazed to see your mistress mourn, Unknowing that she pined for your return; We wondered why she kept her fruit so long, For whom so late the ungathered apples hung. But now the wonder ceases, since I see She kept them only, Tityrus, for thee; For thee the bubbling springs appeared to mourn, And whispering pines made vows for thy return. TITYRUS. What should I do?—While here I was enchained, No glimpse of godlike liberty remained; Nor could I hope, in any place but there, To find a god so present to my prayer. There first the youth of heavenly birth I viewed, For whom our monthly victims are renewed. He heard my vows, and graciously decreed My grounds to be restored, my former flocks to feed. MELIBŒUS. O fortunate old man! whose farm remains— For you sufficient—and requites your pains; Though rushes overspread the neighbouring plains, Though here the marshy grounds approach your fields, And there the soil a stony harvest yields. Your teeming ewes shall no strange meadows try, Nor fear a rot from tainted company. Behold! yon bordering fence of sallow trees Is fraught with flowers, the flowers are fraught with bees; The busy bees, with a soft murmuring strain, Invite to gentle sleep the labouring swain. While, from the neighbouring rock, with rural songs, The pruner's voice the pleasing dream prolongs, Stock-doves and turtles tell their amorous pain, And, from the lofty elms, of love complain. TITYRUS. The inhabitants of seas and skies shall change, And fish on shore, and stags in air, shall range, The banished Parthian dwell on Arar's brink, And the blue German shall the Tigris drink, Ere I, forsaking gratitude and truth, Forget the figure of that godlike youth. MELIBŒUS. But we must beg our bread in climes unknown, Beneath the scorching or the freezing zone; And some to far Oaxis shall be sold, Or try the Libyan heat, or Scythian cold; The rest among the Britons be confined, A race of men from all the world disjoined. O! must the wretched exiles ever mourn, Nor, after length of rolling years, return? Are we condemned by fate's unjust decree, No more our houses and our homes to see? Or shall we mount again the rural throne, And rule the country kingdoms, once our own? Did we for these barbarians plant and sow? On these, on these, our happy fields bestow? Good heaven! what dire effects from civil discord flow! Now let me graff my pears, and prune the vine; The fruit is theirs, the labour only mine. Farewell, my pastures, my paternal stock, My fruitful fields, and my more fruitful flock! No more, my goats, shall I behold you climb The steepy cliffs, or crop the flowery thyme! No more, extended in the grot below, Shall see you browsing on the mountain's brow The prickly shrubs; and after on the bare, Lean down the deep abyss, and hang in air. No more my sheep shall sip the morning dew; No more my song shall please the rural crew: Adieu, my tuneful pipe! and all the world, adieu! TITYRUS. This night, at least, with me forget your care; Chestnuts, and curds and cream, shall be your fare: The carpet-ground shall be with leaves o'erspread, And boughs shall weave a covering for your head. For see yon sunny hill the shade extends, And curling smoke from cottages ascends. PASTORAL II. OR, ALEXIS. ARGUMENT. The commentators can by no means agree on the person of Alexis, but are all of opinion that some beautiful youth is meant by him, to whom Virgil here makes love, in Corydon's language and simplicity. His way of courtship is wholly pastoral: he complains of the boy's coyness; recommends himself for his beauty and skill in piping; invites the youth into the country, where he promises him the diversions of the place, with a suitable present of nuts and apples. But when he finds nothing will prevail, he resolves to quit his troublesome amour, and betake himself again to his former business.Young Corydon, the unhappy shepherd swain, The fair Alexis loved, but loved in vain; And underneath the beechen shade, alone, Thus to the woods and mountains made his moan:— Is this, unkind Alexis, my reward? And must I die unpitied, and unheard? Now the green lizard in the grove is laid, The sheep enjoy the coolness of the shade, And Thestylis wild thyme and garlic beats For harvest hinds, o'erspent with toil and heats; While in the scorching sun I trace in vain Thy flying footsteps o'er the burning plain. The creaking locusts with my voice conspire, They fried with heat, and I with fierce desire. How much more easy was it to sustain Proud Amaryllis, and her haughty reign, The scorns of young Menalcas, once my care, Though he was black, and thou art heavenly fair. Trust not too much to that enchanting face; Beauty's a charm, but soon the charm will pass. White lilies lie neglected on the plain, While dusky hyacinths for use remain. My passion is thy scorn; nor wilt thou know What wealth I have, what gifts I can bestow; What stores my dairies and my folds contain— A thousand lambs, that wander on the plain; New milk, that all the winter never fails, And all the summer overflows the pails. Amphion sung not sweeter to his herd, When summoned stones the Theban turrets reared. Nor am I so deformed; for late I stood Upon the margin of the briny flood: The winds were still; and, if the glass be true, With Daphnis I may vie, though judged by you. O leave the noisy town! O come and see Our country cots, and live content with me! To wound the flying deer, and from their cotes With me to drive a-field the browsing goats; To pipe and sing, and, in our country strain, To copy, or perhaps contend with Pan. Pan taught to join with wax unequal reeds; Pan loves the shepherds, and their flocks he feeds. Nor scorn the pipe: Amyntas, to be taught, With all his kisses would my skill have bought. Of seven smooth joints a mellow pipe I have, Which with his dying breath Damœtas gave, And said,—“This, Corydon, I leave to thee; For only thou deserv'st it after me.” His eyes Amyntas durst not upward lift; For much he grudged the praise, but more the gift. Besides, two kids, that in the valley strayed, I found by chance, and to my fold conveyed: They drain two bagging udders every day; And these shall be companions of thy play; Both flecked with white, the true Arcadian strain, Which Thestylis had often begged in vain: And she shall have them, if again she sues, Since you the giver and the gift refuse. Come to my longing arms, my lovely care! And take the presents which the nymphs prepare. White lilies in full canisters they bring, With all the glories of the purple spring. The daughters of the flood have searched the mead For violets pale, and cropped the poppy's head, The short narcissus and fair daffodil, Pansies to please the sight, and cassia sweet to smell; And set soft hyacinths with iron blue, To shade marsh marigolds of shining hue; Some bound in order, others loosely strowed, To dress thy bower, and trim thy new abode. Myself will search our planted grounds at home, For downy peaches and the glossy plum; And thrash the chestnuts in the neighbouring grove, Such as my Amaryllis used to love. The laurel and the myrtle sweets agree, And both in nosegays shall be bound for thee. Ah, Corydon! ah, poor unhappy swain! Alexis will thy homely gifts disdain: Nor, should'st thou offer all thy little store, Will rich Iollas yield, but offer more. What have I done, to name that wealthy swain? So powerful are his presents, mine so mean! The boar, amidst my crystal streams, I bring; And southern winds to blast my flowery spring. Ah, cruel creature! whom dost thou despise? The gods, to live in woods, have left the skies; And godlike Paris, in the Idæan grove, To Priam's wealth preferred Œnone's love. In cities, which she built, let Pallas reign; Towers are for gods, but forests for the swain. The greedy lioness the wolf pursues, The wolf the kid, the wanton kid the browse; Alexis, thou art chased by Corydon: All follow several games, and each his own. See, from afar, the fields no longer smoke; The sweating steers, unharnessed from the yoke, Bring, as in triumph, back the crooked plough; The shadows lengthen as the sun goes low; Cool breezes now the raging heats remove: Ah, cruel heaven, that made no cure for love! I wish for balmy sleep, but wish in vain; Love has no bounds in pleasure, or in pain. What frenzy, shepherd, has thy soul possessed? Thy vineyard lies half pruned, and half undressed. Quench, Corydon, thy long unanswered fire! Mind what the common wants of life require; On willow twigs employ thy weaving care, And find an easier love, though not so fair. PASTORAL III. OR, PALÆMON. MENALCAS, DAMŒTAS, PALÆMON. ARGUMENT. Damœtas and Menalcas, after some smart strokes of country raillery, resolve to try who has the most skill at song; and accordingly make their neighbour, Palæmon, judge of their performances; who, after a full hearing of both parties, declares himself unfit for the decision of so weighty a controversy, and leaves the victory undetermined. MENALCAS. Ho, swain! what shepherd owns those ragged sheep? DAMŒTAS. Ægon's they are: he gave them me to keep. MENALCAS. Unhappy sheep, of an unhappy swain! While he Neæra courts, but courts in vain, And fears that I the damsel shall obtain. Thou, varlet, dost thy master's gains devour; Thou milk'st his ewes, and often twice an hour; Of grass and fodder thou defraud'st the dams, And of their mothers' dugs the starving lambs. DAMŒTAS. Good words, young catamite, at least to men. We know who did your business, how, and when; And in what chapel too you played your prize, And what the goats observed with leering eyes: The nymphs were kind, and laughed; and there your safety lies. MENALCAS. Yes, when I cropt the hedges of the leys, Cut Micon's tender vines, and stole the stays! DAMŒTAS. Or rather, when, beneath yon ancient oak, The bow of Daphnis, and the shafts, you broke, When the fair boy received the gift of right; And, but for mischief, you had died for spite. MENALCAS. What nonsense would the fool, thy master, prate, When thou, his knave, canst talk at such a rate! Did I not see you, rascal, did I not, When you lay snug to snap young Damon's goat? His mongrel barked; I ran to his relief, And cried,—“There, there he goes! stop, stop the thief!” Discovered, and defeated of your prey, You skulked behind the fence, and sneaked away. DAMŒTAS. An honest man may freely take his own: The goat was mine, by singing fairly won. A solemn match was made; he lost the prize. Ask Damon, ask, if he the debt denies. I think he dares not; if he does, he lies. MENALCAS. Thou sing with him? thou booby!—Never pipe Was so profaned to touch that blubbered lip. Dunce at the best! in streets but scarce allowed To tickle, on thy straw, the stupid crowd. DAMŒTAS. To bring it to the trial, will you dare Our pipes, our skill, our voices, to compare? My brinded heifer to the stake I lay; Two thriving calves she suckles twice a day, And twice besides her beestings never fail To store the dairy with a brimming pail. Now back your singing with an equal stake. MENALCAS. That should be seen, if I had one to make. You know too well, I feed my father's flock; What can I wager from the common stock? A stepdame too I have, a cursed she, Who rules my hen-peck'd sire, and orders me. Both number twice a day the milky dams; And once she takes the tale of all the lambs. But, since you will be mad, and since you may Suspect my courage, if I should not lay, The pawn I proffer shall be full as good: Two bowls I have, well turned, of beechen wood; Both by divine Alcimedon were made; To neither of them yet the lip is laid. The lids are ivy; grapes in clusters lurk Beneath the carving of the curious work. Two figures on the sides embossed appear— Conon, and what's his name who made the sphere, And showed the seasons of the sliding year, Instructed in his trade the labouring swain, And when to reap, and when to sow the grain? DAMŒTAS. And I have two, to match your pair, at home; The wood the same; from the same hand they come, (The kimbo handles seem with bear's foot carved), And never yet to table have been served; Where Orpheus on his lyre laments his love, With beasts encompassed, and a dancing grove. But these, nor all the proffers you can make, Are worth the heifer which I set to stake. MENALCAS. No more delays, vain boaster, but begin! I prophesy beforehand, I shall win. Palæmon shall be judge how ill you rhyme: I'll teach you how to brag another time. DAMŒTAS. Rhymer, come on! and do the worst you can; I fear not you, nor yet a better man. With silence, neighbour, and attention, wait; For 'tis a business of a high debate. PALÆMON. Sing then; the shade affords a proper place, The trees are clothed with leaves, the fields with grass, The blossoms blow, the birds on bushes sing, And Nature has accomplished all the spring. The challenge to Damœtas shall belong; Menalcas shall sustain his under-song; Each in his turn your tuneful numbers bring, By turns the tuneful Muses love to sing. DAMŒTAS. From the great father of the gods above My Muse begins; for all is full of Jove: To Jove the care of heaven and earth belongs; My flocks he blesses, and he loves my songs. MENALCAS. Me Phœbus loves; for he my Muse inspires, And in her songs the warmth he gave requires. For him, the god of shepherds and their sheep, Phœbus, not Pan, is here called the god of shepherds. The poet alludes to the same story which he touches in the beginning of the Second Georgic, where he calls Phœbus the Amphrysian shepherd, because he fed the sheep and oxen of Admetus, with whom he was in love, on the hill Amphyrsus. My blushing hyacinths and my bays I keep. DAMŒTAS. With pelted fruit me Galatea plies; Then tripping to the woods the wanton hies, And wishes to be seen before she flies. MENALCAS. But fair Amyntas comes unasked to me, And offers love, and sits upon my knee. Not Delia to my dogs is known so well as he. DAMŒTAS. To the dear mistress of my love-sick mind, Her swain a pretty present has designed: I saw two stock-doves billing, and ere long Will take the nest, and hers shall be the young. MENALCAS. Ten ruddy wildings in the wood I found, And stood on tip-toes, reaching from the ground: I sent Amyntas all my present store; And will, to-morrow, send as many more. DAMŒTAS. The lovely maid lay panting in my arms, And all she said and did was full of charms. Winds! on your wings to heaven her accents bear; Such words as heaven alone is fit to hear. MENALCAS. Ah! what avails it me, my love's delight, To call you mine, when absent from my sight? I hold the nets, while you pursue the prey, And must not share the dangers of the day. DAMŒTAS. I keep my birthday; send my Phyllis home; At shearing-time, Iollas, you may come. MENALCAS. With Phyllis I am more in grace than you; Her sorrow did my parting steps pursue: “Adieu, my dear,” she said, “a long adieu!” DAMŒTAS. The nightly wolf is baneful to the fold, Storms to the wheat, to buds the bitter cold; But, from my frowning fair, more ills I find, Than from the wolves, and storms, and winterwind. MENALCAS. The kids with pleasure browse the bushy plain; The showers are grateful to the swelling grain; To teeming ewes the sallow's tender tree; But, more than all the world, my love to me. DAMŒTAS. Pollio my rural verse vouchsafes to read: A heifer, Muses, for your patron breed. MENALCAS. My Pollio writes himself:—a bull be bred, With spurning heels, and with a butting head. DAMŒTAS. Who Pollio loves, and who his Muse admires, Let Pollio's fortune crown his full desires. Let myrrh instead of thorn his fences fill, And showers of honey from his oaks distil. MENALCAS. Who hates not living Bavius, let him be (Dead Mævius!) damn'd to love thy works and thee! The same ill taste of sense would serve to join Dog-foxes in the yoke, and shear the swine. DAMŒTAS. Ye boys, who pluck the flowers, and spoil the spring, Beware the secret snake that shoots a sting. MENALCAS. Graze not too near the banks, my jolly sheep; The ground is false, the running streams are deep: See, they have caught the father of the flock, Who dries his fleece upon the neighbouring rock. DAMŒTAS. From rivers drive the kids, and sling your hook; Anon I'll wash them in the shallow brook. MENALCAS. To fold, my flock!—when milk is dried with heat, In vain the milkmaid tugs an empty teat. DAMŒTAS. How lank my bulls from plenteous pasture come! But love, that drains the herd, destroys the groom. MENALCAS. My flocks are free from love, yet look so thin, Their bones are barely covered with their skin. What magic has bewitched the woolly dams, And what ill eyes beheld the tender lambs? DAMŒTAS. Say, where the round of heaven, which all contains, To three short ells on earth our sight restrains: Tell that, and rise a Phœbus for thy pains. MENALCAS. Nay, tell me first, in what new region springs A flower, that bears inscribed the names of kings; And thou shalt gain a present as divine As Phœbus' self; for Phyllis shall be thine. PALÆMON. So nice a difference in your singing lies, That both have won, or both deserved the prize. Rest equal happy both; and all who prove The bitter sweets, and pleasing pains, of love. Now dam the ditches, and the floods restrain; Their moisture has already drenched the plain. PASTORAL IV. OR, POLLIO. ARGUMENT. The Poet celebrates the birthday of Saloninus, the son of Pollio, born in the consulship of his father, after the taking of Salona, a city in Dalmatia. Many of the verses are translated from one of the Sibyls, who prophesied of our Saviour's birth. Sicilian Muse, begin a loftier strain! Though lowly shrubs, and trees that shade the plain, Delight not all; Sicilian Muse, prepare To make the vocal woods deserve a consul's care. The last great age, foretold by sacred rhymes, Renews its finished course: Saturnian times Roll round again; and mighty years, begun From their first orb, in radiant circles run. The base degenerate iron offspring ends; A golden progeny from heaven descends. O chaste Lucina! speed the mother's pains; And haste the glorious birth! thy own Apollo reigns! The lovely boy, with his auspicious face, Shall Pollio's consulship and triumph grace; Majestic months set out with him to their appointed race. The father banished virtue shall restore, And crimes shall threat the guilty world no more. The son shall lead the life of gods, and be By gods and heroes seen, and gods and heroes see. The jarring nations he in peace shall bind, And with paternal virtues rule mankind. Unbidden earth shall wreathing ivy bring, And fragrant herbs (the promises of spring), As her first offerings to her infant king. The goats with strutting dugs shall homeward speed, And lowing herds secure from lions feed. His cradle shall with rising flowers be crowned: The serpent's brood shall die; the sacred ground Shall weeds and poisonous plants refuse to bear; Each common bush shall Syrian roses wear. But when heroic verse his youth shall raise, And form it to hereditary praise, Unlaboured harvests shall the fields adorn, And clustered grapes shall blush on every thorn; The knotted oaks shall showers of honey weep; And through the matted grass the liquid gold shall creep. Yet, of old fraud some footsteps shall remain; The merchant still shall plough the deep for gain, Great cities shall with walls be compassed round, And sharpened shares shall vex the fruitful ground; Another Tiphys shall new seas explore; Another Argo land the chiefs upon the Iberian shore; Another Helen other wars create, And great Achilles urge the Trojan fate. But when to ripened manhood he shall grow, The greedy sailor shall the seas forego; No keel shall cut the waves for foreign ware, For every soil shall every product bear. The labouring hind his oxen shall disjoin; No plough shall hurt the glebe, no pruning-hook the vine; Nor wool shall in dissembled colours shine; But the luxurious father of the fold, With native purple, or unborrowed gold, Beneath his pompous fleece shall proudly sweat; And under Tyrian robes the lamb shall bleat. The Fates, when they this happy web have spun, Shall bless the sacred clew, and bid it smoothly run. Mature in years, to ready honours move, O of celestial seed! O foster-son of Jove! See, labouring Nature calls thee to sustain The nodding frame of heaven, and earth, and main! See to their base restored, earth, seas, and air; And joyful ages, from behind, in crowding ranks appear. To sing thy praise, would heaven my breath prolong, Infusing spirits worthy such a song, Not Thracian Orpheus should transcend my lays, Nor Linus crowned with never-fading bays; Though each his heavenly parent should inspire; The Muse instruct the voice, and Phœbus tune the lyre. Should Pan contend in verse, and thou my theme, Arcadian judges should their god condemn. Begin, auspicious boy! to cast about Thy infant eyes, and, with a smile, thy mother single out. In Latin thus— Incipe, parve puer, risu cognoscere matrem, etc. I have translated the passage to this sense—that the infant, smiling on his mother, singles her out from the rest of the company about him. Erythræus, Bembus, and Joseph Scaliger are of this opinion. Yet they and I may be mistaken; for, immediately after, we find these words, cui non risere parentes, which imply another sense, as if the parents smiled on the new-born infant; and that the babe on whom they vouchsafed not to smile was born to ill-fortune: for they tell a story that, when Vulcan, the only son of Jupiter and Juno, came into the world, he was so hard-favoured that both his parents frowned on him, and Jupiter threw him out of heaven: he fell on the island Lemnos, and was lame ever afterwards. The last line of the Pastoral seems to justify this sense— Nec Deus hunc mensâ, Dea nec dignata cubili est. For, though he married Venus, yet his mother Juno was not present at the nuptials to bless them; as appears by his wife's incontinence. They say also, that he was banished from the banquets of the gods. If so, that punishment could be of no long continuance; for Homer makes him present at their feasts, and composing a quarrel betwixt his parents with a bowl of nectar. The matter is of no great consequence; and therefore I adhere to my translation, for these two reasons: first, Virgil has his following line— Matri longa decem tulerunt fastidia menses, as if the infant's smiling on his mother was a reward to her for bearing him ten months in her body, four weeks longer than the usual time. Secondly, Catullus is cited by Joseph Scaliger as favouring this opinion, in his Epithalamium of Manlius Torquatus— Torquatus, volo, parvolus, Matris e gremio suæ Porrigens teneras manus, Dulce rideat ad patrem, etc. What if I should steer betwixt the two extremes, and conclude that the infant, who was to be happy, must not only smile on his parents, but also they on him? For Scaliger notes, that the infants who smiled not at their birth, were observed to be ?????????, or sullen (as I have translated it) during all their life; and Servius, and almost all the modern commentators, affirm that no child was thought fortunate on whom his parents smiled not at his birth. I observe, further, that the ancients thought the infant who came into the world at the end of the tenth month was born to some extraordinary fortune, good or bad. Such was the birth of the late Prince of Condé's father, of whom his mother was not brought to bed till almost eleven months were expired after his father's death; yet the College of Physicians at Paris concluded he was lawfully begotten. My ingenious friend, Anthony Henley, Esq., desired me to make a note on this passage of Virgil; adding (what I had not read) that the Jews have been so superstitious as to observe not only the first look or action of an infant, but also the first word which the parent or any of the assistants spoke after the birth; and from thence they gave a name to the child, alluding to it. Thy mother well deserves that short delight, The nauseous qualms of ten long months and travail to requite. Then smile! the frowning infant's doom is read; No god shall crown the board, nor goddess bless the bed. PASTORAL V. OR, DAPHNIS. ARGUMENT. Mopsus and Menalcas, two very expert shepherds at a song, begin one by consent to the memory of Daphnis, who is supposed by the best critics to represent Julius Cæsar. Mopsus laments his death; Menalcas proclaims his divinity; the whole eclogue consisting of an elegy and an apotheosis. MENALCAS. Since on the downs our flocks together feed, And since my voice can match your tuneful reed, Why sit we not beneath the grateful shade, Which hazels, intermixed with elms, have made? MOPSUS. Whether you please that sylvan scene scent to take, Where whistling winds uncertain shadows make; Or will you to the cooler cave succeed, Whose mouth the curling vines have overspread? MENALCAS. Your merit and your years command the choice; Amyntas only rivals you in voice. MOPSUS. What will not that presuming shepherd dare, Who thinks his voice with Phœbus may compare? MENALCAS. Begin your first; if either Alcon's praise, Or dying Phyllis, have inspired your lays; If her you mourn, or Codrus you commend, Begin, and Tityrus your flock shall tend. MOPSUS. Or shall I rather the sad verse repeat, Which on the beech's bark I lately writ? I writ, and sung betwixt. Now bring the swain, Whose voice you boast, and let him try the strain. MENALCAS. Such as the shrub to the tall olive shows, Or the pale sallow to the blushing rose; Such is his voice, if I can judge aright, Compared to thine, in sweetness and in height. MOPSUS. No more, but sit and hear the promised lay; The gloomy grotto makes a doubtful day. The nymphs about the breathless body wait Of Daphnis, and lament his cruel fate. The trees and floods were witness to their tears; At length the rumour reached his mother's ears. The wretched parent, with a pious haste, Came running, and his lifeless limbs embraced. She sighed, she sobbed; and, furious with despair, She rent her garments, and she tore her hair, Accusing all the gods, and every star. The swains forgot their sheep, nor near the brink Of running waters brought their herds to drink. The thirsty cattle, of themselves, abstained From water, and their grassy fare disdained. The death of Daphnis woods and hills deplore; They cast the sound to Libya's desert shore; The Libyan lions hear, and hearing roar. Fierce tigers Daphnis taught the yoke to bear, And first with curling ivy dressed the spear. Daphnis did rites to Bacchus first ordain, And holy revels for his reeling train. As vines the trees, as grapes the vines adorn, As bulls the herds, and fields the yellow corn; So bright a splendour, so divine a grace, The glorious Daphnis cast on his illustrious race. When envious Fate the godlike Daphnis took, Our guardian gods the fields and plains forsook; Pales no longer swelled the teeming grain, Nor Phœbus fed his oxen on the plain; No fruitful crop the sickly fields return, But oats and darnel choke the rising corn; And where the vales with violets once were crowned, Now knotty burs and thorns disgrace the ground. Come, shepherds, come, and strew with leaves the plain; Such funeral rites your Daphnis did ordain. With cypress-boughs the crystal fountains hide, And softly let the running waters glide. A lasting monument to Daphnis raise, With this inscription to record his praise:— “Daphnis, the fields' delight, the shepherds' love, Renowned on earth, and deified above; Whose flock excelled the fairest on the plains, But less than he himself surpassed the swains.” MENALCAS. O heavenly poet! such thy verse appears, So sweet, so charming to my ravished ears, As to the weary swain, with cares opprest, Beneath the sylvan shade, refreshing rest; As to the feverish traveller, when first He finds a crystal stream to quench his thirst. In singing, as in piping, you excel; And scarce your master could perform so well. O fortunate young man! at least your lays Are next to his, and claim the second praise. Such as they are, my rural songs I join, To raise our Daphnis to the powers divine; For Daphnis was so good, to love whate'er was mine. MOPSUS. How is my soul with such a promise raised! For both the boy was worthy to be praised, And Stimicon has often made me long To hear, like him, so soft, so sweet a song. MENALCAS. Daphnis, the guest of heaven, with wondering eyes, Views, in the milky way, the starry skies, And far beneath him, from the shining sphere, Beholds the moving clouds, and rolling year. For this with cheerful cries the woods resound, The purple spring arrays the various ground, The nymphs and shepherds dance, and Pan himself is crowned. The wolf no longer prowls for nightly spoils, Nor birds the springes fear, nor stags the toils; For Daphnis reigns above, and deals from thence His mother's milder beams, and peaceful influence. The mountain-tops unshorn, the rocks, rejoice; The lowly shrubs partake of human voice. Assenting Nature, with a gracious nod, Proclaims him, and salutes the new-admitted god. Be still propitious, ever good to thine! Behold! four hallowed altars we design; And two to thee, and two to Phœbus rise; On both is offered annual sacrifice. The holy priests, at each returning year, Two bowls of milk, and two of oil, shall bear; And I myself the guests with friendly bowls will cheer. Two goblets will I crown with sparkling wine, The generous vintage of the Chian vine; These will I pour to thee, and make the nectar thine. In winter shall the genial feast be made Before the fire; by summer, in the shade. Damœtas shall perform the rites divine, And Lyctian Ægon in the song shall join. Alphesibœus, tripping, shall advance, And mimic Satyrs in his antic dance. When to the nymphs our annual rites we pay, And when our fields with victims we survey; While savage boars delight in shady woods, And finny fish inhabit in the floods; While bees on thyme, and locusts feed on dew— Thy grateful swains these honours shall renew. Such honours as we pay to powers divine, To Bacchus and to Ceres, shall be thine. Such annual honours shall be given; and thou Shalt hear, and shalt condemn thy suppliants to their vow. MOPSUS. What present, worth thy verse, can Mopsus find? Not the soft whispers of the southern wind, That play through trembling trees, delight me more; Nor murmuring billows on the sounding shore; Nor winding streams, that through the valley glide, And the scarce-covered pebbles gently chide. MENALCAS. Receive you first this tuneful pipe, the same That played my Corydon's unhappy flame; The same that sung Neæra's conquering eyes, And, had the judge been just, had won the prize. MOPSUS. Accept from me this sheep-hook in exchange; The handle brass, the knobs in equal range. Antigenes, with kisses, often tried To beg this present, in his beauty's pride, When youth and love are hard to be denied. But what I could refuse to his request, Is yours unasked, for you deserve it best. PASTORAL VI. OR, SILENUS. ARGUMENT. Two young shepherds, Chromis and Mnasylus, having been often promised a song by Silenus, chance to catch him asleep in this Pastoral; where they bind him hand and foot, and then claim his promise. Silenus, finding they would be put off no longer, begins his song, in which he describes the formation of the universe, and the original of animals, according to the Epicurean philosophy; and then runs through the most surprising transformations which have happened in Nature since her birth. This Pastoral was designed as a compliment to Syron the Epicurean, who instructed Virgil and Varus in the principles of that philosophy. Silenus acts as tutor, Chromis and Mnasylus as the two pupils. My Lord Roscommon's notes on this Pastoral are equal to his excellent translation of it; and thither I refer the reader. The Eighth and Tenth Pastorals are already translated, to all manner of advantage, by my excellent friend Mr Stafford. So is the episode of Camilla, in the Eleventh Æneïd. I first transferred to Rome Sicilian strains; Nor blushed the Doric Muse to dwell on Mantuan plains. But when I tried her tender voice, too young, And fighting kings and bloody battles sung, Apollo checked my pride, and bade me feed My fattening flocks, nor dare beyond the reed. Admonished thus, while every pen prepares To write thy praises, Varus, and thy wars, My pastoral Muse her humble tribute brings, And yet not wholly uninspired she sings; For all who read, and, reading, not disdain These rural poems, and their lowly strain, The name of Varus oft inscribed shall see In every grove, and every vocal tree, And all the sylvan reign shall sing of thee: Thy name, to Phœbus and the Muses known, Shall in the front of every page be shown; For he, who sings thy praise, secures his own. Proceed, my Muse!—Two Satyrs, on the ground, Stretched at his ease, their sire Silenus found. Dozed with his fumes, and heavy with his load, They found him snoring in his dark abode, And seized with youthful arms the drunken god. His rosy wreath was dropt not long before, Borne by the tide of wine, and floating on the floor. His empty can, with ears half worn away, Was hung on high, to boast the triumph of the day. Invaded thus, for want of better bands, His garland they unstring, and bind his hands; For, by the fraudful god deluded long, They now resolve to have their promised song. Ægle came in, to make their party good— The fairest Naïs of the neighbouring flood— And, while he stares around with stupid eyes, His brows with berries, and his temples, dyes. He finds the fraud, and, with a smile, demands, On what design the boys had bound his hands. “Loose me,” he cried, “'twas impudence to find A sleeping god; 'tis sacrilege to bind. To you the promised poem I will pay; The nymph shall be rewarded in her way.” He raised his voice; and soon a numerous throng Of tripping Satyrs crowded to the song; And sylvan Fauns, and savage beasts, advanced; And nodding forests to the numbers danced. Not by Hæmonian hills the Thracian bard, Nor awful Phœbus was on Pindus heard With deeper silence, or with more regard. He sung the secret seeds of Nature's frame; How seas, and earth, and air, and active flame, Fell through the mighty void, and, in their fall, Were blindly gathered in this goodly ball. The tender soil then, stiffening by degrees, Shut from the bounded earth the bounding seas. Then earth and ocean various forms disclose, And a new sun to the new world arose; And mists, condensed to clouds, obscure the sky; And clouds, dissolved, the thirsty ground supply. The rising trees the lofty mountains grace; The lofty mountains feed the savage race, Yet few, and strangers, in the unpeopled place. From thence the birth of man the song pursued, And how the world was lost, and how renewed; The reign of Saturn, and the golden age; Prometheus' theft, and Jove's avenging rage; The cries of Argonauts for Hylas drowned, With whose repeated name the shores resound; Then mourns the madness of the Cretan queen,— Happy for her if herds had never been. What fury, wretched woman, seized thy breast? The maids of Argos (though, with rage possessed, Their imitated lowings filled the grove), Yet shunned the guilt of thy preposterous love, Nor sought the youthful husband of the herd, Though tender and untried the yoke he feared, Though soft and white as flakes of falling snow, And scarce his budding horns had adorned his brow. Ah, wretched queen! you range the pathless wood, While on a flowery bank he chews the cud, Or sleeps in shades, or through the forest roves, And roars with anguish for his absent loves. “Ye nymphs, with toils his forest-walk surround, And trace his wandering footsteps on the ground. But, ah! perhaps my passion he disdains, And courts the milky mothers of the plains. We search the ungrateful fugitive abroad, While they at home sustain his happy load.” He sung the lover's fraud; the longing maid, With golden fruit, like all the sex, betrayed; The sisters mourning for their brother's loss; Their bodies hid in barks, and furred with moss; How each a rising alder now appears, And o'er the Po distils her gummy tears: Then sung, how Gallus, by a Muse's hand, Was led and welcomed to the sacred strand; The senate rising to salute their guest; And Linus thus their gratitude expressed:— “Receive this present, by the Muses made, The pipe on which the Ascræan pastor played; With which of old he charmed the savage train, And called the mountain-ashes to the plain. Sing thou, on this, thy Phœbus; and the wood Where once his fane of Parian marble stood: On this his ancient oracles rehearse, And with new numbers grace the god of verse.” Why should I sing the double Scylla's fate? The first by love transformed, the last by hate— A beauteous maid above; but magic arts With barking dogs deformed her nether parts: What vengeance on the passing fleet she poured, The master frighted, and the mates devoured. Then ravished Philomel the song exprest: The crime revealed; the sisters' cruel feast; And how in fields the lapwing Tereus reigns, The warbling nightingale in woods complains; While Procne makes on chimney-tops her moan, And hovers o'er the palace once her own. Whatever songs besides the Delphian god Had taught the laurels, and the Spartan flood, Silenus sung: the vales his voice rebound, And carry to the skies the sacred sound. And now the setting sun had warned the swain To call his counted cattle from the plain: Yet still the unwearied sire pursues the tuneful strain, Till, unperceived, the heavens with stars were hung, And sudden night surprised the yet unfinished song. PASTORAL VII. OR, MELIBŒUS. ARGUMENT. Melibœus here gives us the relation of a sharp poetical contest between Thyrsis and Corydon, at which he himself and Daphnis were present; who both declared for Corydon. Beneath a holm, repaired two jolly swains (Their sheep and goats together graze the plains), Both young Arcadians, both alike inspired To sing, and answer as the song required. Daphnis, as umpire, took the middle seat, And fortune thither led my weary feet; For, while I fenced my myrtles from the cold, The father of my flock had wandered from the fold. Of Daphnis I inquired: he, smiling, said, “Dismiss your fear;” and pointed where he fed: “And, if no greater cares disturb your mind, Sit here with us, in covert of the wind. Your lowing heifers, of their own accord, At watering time will seek the neighbouring ford. Here wanton Mincius winds along the meads, And shades his happy banks with bending reeds. And see, from yon old oak that mates the skies, How black the clouds of swarming bees arise.” What should I do? nor was Alcippe nigh, Nor absent Phyllis could my care supply, To house, and feed by hand my weaning lambs, And drain the strutting udders of their dams. Great was the strife betwixt the singing swains; And I preferred my pleasure to my gains. Alternate rhyme the ready champions chose: These Corydon rehearsed, and Thyrsis those. CORYDON. Ye Muses, ever fair, and ever young, Assist my numbers, and inspire my song. With all my Codrus, O! inspire my breast; For Codrus, after Phœbus, sings the best. Or, if my wishes have presumed too high, And stretched their bounds beyond mortality, The praise of artful numbers I resign, And hang my pipe upon the sacred pine. THYRSIS. Arcadian swains, your youthful poet crown With ivy-wreaths; though surly Codrus frown: Or, if he blast my Muse with envious praise, Then fence my brows with amulets of bays, Lest his ill arts, or his malicious tongue, Should poison, or bewitch my growing song. CORYDON. These branches of a stag, this tusky boar (The first essay of arms untried before) Young Micon offers, Delia, to thy shrine: But, speed his hunting with thy power divine; Thy statue then of Parian stone shall stand; Thy legs in buskins with a purple band. THYRSIS. This bowl of milk, these cakes (our country fare), For thee, Priapus, yearly we prepare, Because a little garden is thy care; But, if the falling lambs increase my fold, Thy marble statue shall be turned to gold. CORYDON. Fair Galatea, with thy silver feet, O, whiter than the swan, and more than Hybla sweet! Tall as a poplar, taper as the bole! Come, charm thy shepherd, and restore my soul! Come, when my lated sheep at night return, And crown the silent hours, and stop the rosy morn! THYRSIS. May I become as abject in thy sight, As sea-weed on the shore, and black as night; Rough as a bur; deformed like him who chaws Sardinian herbage to contract his jaws; Such and so monstrous let thy swain appear, If one day's absence looks not like a year. Hence from the field, for shame! the flock deserves No better feeding while the shepherd starves. CORYDON. Ye mossy springs, inviting easy sleep, Ye trees, whose leafy shades those mossy fountains keep, Defend my flock! The summer heats are near, And blossoms on the swelling vines appear. THYRSIS. With heapy fires our cheerful hearth is crowned; And firs for torches in the woods abound: We fear not more the winds, and wintry cold, Than streams the banks, or wolves the bleating fold. CORYDON. Our woods, with juniper and chestnuts crowned, With falling fruits and berries paint the ground; And lavish Nature laughs, and strews her stores around: But, if Alexis from our mountains fly, Even running rivers leave their channels dry. THYRSIS. Parched are the plains, and frying is the field, Nor withering vines their juicy vintage yield: But, if returning Phyllis bless the plain, The grass revives, the woods are green again, And Jove descends in showers of kindly rain. CORYDON. The poplar is by great Alcides worn; The brows of Phœbus his own bays adorn; The branching vine the jolly Bacchus loves; The Cyprian queen delights in myrtle groves; With hazel Phyllis crowns her flowing hair; And, while she loves that common wreath to wear, Nor bays, nor myrtle boughs, with hazel shall compare. THYRSIS. The towering ash is fairest in the woods; In garden pines, and poplars by the floods: But, if my Lycidas will ease my pains, And often visit our forsaken plains, To him the towering ash shall yield in woods, In gardens pines, and poplars by the floods. MELIBŒUS. I've heard; and, Thyrsis, you contend in vain, For Corydon, young Corydon, shall reign The Prince of Poets on the Mantuan plain. PASTORAL VIII. This Eighth Pastoral is copied by our author from two Bucolics of Theocritus. Spenser has followed both Virgil and Theocritus in the charms which he employs for curing Britomartis of her love. But he had also our poet's Ceiris in his eye; for there not only the enchantments are to be found, but also the very name of Britomartis. OR, PHARMACEUTRIA. ARGUMENT. This Pastoral contains the Songs of Damon and Alphesibœus. The first of them bewails the loss of his mistress, and repines at the success of his rival Mopsus. The other repeats the charms of some enchantress, who endeavoured, by her spells and magic, to make Daphnis in love with her. The mournful muse of two despairing swains, The love rejected, and the lovers' pains; To which the savage lynxes listening stood, The rivers stood on heaps, and stopped the running flood; The hungry herd their needful food refuse— Of two despairing swains, I sing the mournful muse. Great Pollio! thou, for whom thy Rome prepares The ready triumph of thy finished wars, Whether Timavus or the Illyrian coast, Whatever land or sea thy presence boast; Is there an hour in fate reserved for me, To sing thy deeds in numbers worthy thee? In numbers like to thine, could I rehearse Thy lofty tragic scenes, thy laboured verse, The world another Sophocles in thee, Another Homer should behold in me. Amidst thy laurels let this ivy twine: Thine was my earliest muse; my latest shall be thine. Scarce from our upper world the shades withdrew, Scarce were the flocks refreshed with morning dew, When Damon, stretched beneath an olive shade, And, wildly staring upwards, thus inveighed Against the conscious gods, and cursed the cruel maid: “Star of the morning, why dost thou delay? Come, Lucifer, drive on the lagging day, While I my Nisa's perjured faith deplore,— Witness, ye powers, by whom she falsely swore! The gods, alas! are witnesses in vain; Yet shall my dying breath to heaven complain. Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Mænalian strain. “The pines of Mænalus, the vocal grove, Are ever full of verse, and full of love: They hear the hinds, they hear their god complain, Who suffered not the reeds to rise in vain. Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Mænalian strain. “Mopsus triumphs; he weds the willing fair. When such is Nisa's choice, what lover can despair? Now griffons join with mares; another age Shall see the hound and hind their thirst assuage, Promiscuous at the spring. Prepare the lights, O Mopsus! and perform the bridal rites. Scatter thy nuts among the scrambling boys: Thine is the night, and thine the nuptial joys. For thee the sun declines: O happy swain! Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Mænalian strain. “O Nisa! justly to thy choice condemned! Whom hast thou taken, whom hast thou contemned? For him, thou hast refused my browsing herd, Scorned my thick eyebrows, and my shaggy beard. Unhappy Damon sighs and sings in vain, While Nisa thinks no god regards a lover's pain. Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Mænalian strain. “I viewed thee first, (how fatal was the view!) And led thee where the ruddy wildings grew, High on the planted hedge, and wet with morning dew. Then scarce the bending branches I could win; The callow down began to clothe my chin. I saw; I perished; yet indulged my pain. Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Mænalian strain. “I know thee, Love! in deserts thou wert bred, And at the dugs of savage tigers fed; Alien of birth, usurper of the plains! Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Mænalian strains. “Relentless Love the cruel mother led The blood of her unhappy babes to shed: Love lent the sword; the mother struck the blow; Inhuman she; but more inhuman thou: Alien of birth, usurper of the plains! Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Mænalian strains. “Old doting Nature, change thy course anew, And let the trembling lamb the wolf pursue; Let oaks now glitter with Hesperian fruit, And purple daffodils from alder shoot; Fat amber let the tamarisk distil, And hooting owls contend with swans in skill; Hoarse Tityrus strive with Orpheus in the woods, And challenge famed Arion on the floods. Or, oh! let Nature cease, and Chaos reign! Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Mænalian strain. “Let earth be sea; and let the whelming tide The lifeless limbs of luckless Damon hide: Farewell, ye secret woods, and shady groves, Haunts of my youth, and conscious of my loves! From yon high cliff I plunge into the main; Take the last present of thy dying swain; And cease, my silent flute, the sweet Mænalian strain.” Now take your turns, ye Muses, to rehearse His friend's complaints, and mighty magic verse: “Bring running water; bind those altars round With fillets, and with vervain strew the ground: Make fat with frankincense the sacred fires, To re-inflame my Daphnis with desires. 'Tis done: we want but verse.—Restore, my charms, My lingering Daphnis to my longing arms. “Pale Phœbe, drawn by verse, from heaven descends; And Circe changed with charms Ulysses' friends. Verse breaks the ground, and penetrates the brake, And in the winding cavern splits the snake: Verse fires the frozen veins.—Restore, my charms, My lingering Daphnis to my longing arms. “Around his waxen image first I wind Three woollen fillets, of three colours joined; Thrice bind about his thrice-devoted head, Which round the sacred altar thrice is led. Unequal numbers please the gods.—My charms, Restore my Daphnis to my longing arms. “Knit with three knots the fillets; knit them straight; Then say, ‘These knots to love I consecrate.’ Haste, Amaryllis, haste!—Restore, my charms, My lovely Daphnis to my longing arms. “As fire this figure hardens, made of clay, And this of wax with fire consumes away; Such let the soul of cruel Daphnis be— Hard to the rest of women, soft to me. Crumble the sacred mole of salt and corn: Next in the fire the bays with brimstone burn; And, while it crackles in the sulphur, say, ‘This I for Daphnis burn; thus Daphnis burn away! This laurel is his fate.’—Restore, my charms, My lovely Daphnis to my longing arms. “As when the raging heifer, through the grove, Stung with desire, pursues her wandering love; Faint at the last, she seeks the weedy pools, To quench her thirst, and on the rushes rolls, Careless of night, unmindful to return; Such fruitless fires perfidious Daphnis burn, While I so scorn his love!—Restore, my charms, My lingering Daphnis to my longing arms. “These garments once were his, and left to me, The pledges of his promised loyalty, Which underneath my threshold I bestow: These pawns, O sacred earth! to me my Daphnis owe. As these were his, so mine is he.—My charms, Restore their lingering lord to my deluded arms. “These poisonous plants, for magic use designed, (The noblest and the best of all the baneful kind), Old Mœris brought me from the Pontic strand, And culled the mischief of a bounteous land. Smeared with these powerful juices, on the plain, He howls a wolf among the hungry train; And oft the mighty necromancer boasts, With these, to call from tombs the stalking ghosts, And from the roots to tear the standing corn, Which, whirled aloft, to distant fields is borne: Such is the strength of spells.—Restore, my charms, My lingering Daphnis to my longing arms. “Bear out these ashes; cast them in the brook; Cast backwards o'er your head; nor turn your look: Since neither gods nor godlike verse can move, Break out, ye smothered fires, and kindle smothered love. Exert your utmost power, my lingering charms; And force my Daphnis to my longing arms. “See while my last endeavours I delay, The walking ashes rise, and round our altars play! Run to the threshold, Amaryllis—hark! Our Hylax opens, and begins to bark. Good heaven! may lovers what they wish believe? Or dream their wishes, and those dreams deceive? No more! my Daphnis comes! no more, my charms! He comes, he runs, he leaps, to my desiring arms.” PASTORAL IX. In the Ninth Pastoral, Virgil has made a collection of many scattering passages, which he had translated from Theocritus; and here he has bound them into a nosegay. OR, LYCIDAS AND MŒRIS. ARGUMENT. When Virgil, by the favour of Augustus, had recovered his patrimony near Mantua, and went in hope to take possession, he was in danger to be slain by Arius the centurion, to whom those lands were assigned by the Emperor, in reward of his service against Brutus and Cassius. This Pastoral therefore is filled with complaints of his hard usage; and the persons introduced are the bailiff of Virgil, Mœris, and his friend Lycidas. LYCIDAS. Ho, Mœris! whither on thy way so fast? This leads to town. MŒRIS. O Lycidas! at last The time is come, I never thought to see, (Strange revolution for my farm and me!) When the grim captain in a surly tone Cries out, “Pack up, ye rascals, and be gone.” Kicked out, we set the best face on't we could; And these two kids, t'appease his angry mood, I bear,—of which the Furies give him good! LYCIDAS. Your country friends were told another tale,— That, from the sloping mountain to the vale, And doddered oak, and all the banks along, Menalcas saved his fortune with a song. MŒRIS. Such was the news, indeed; but songs and rhymes Prevail as much in these hard iron times, As would a plump of trembling fowl, that rise Against an eagle sousing from the skies. And, had not Phœbus warned me, by the croak Of an old raven from a hollow oak, To shun debate, Menalcas had been slain, And Mœris not survived him, to complain. LYCIDAS. Now heaven defend! could barbarous rage induce The brutal son of Mars t'insult the sacred Muse? Who then should sing the nymphs? or who rehearse The waters gliding in a smoother verse? Or Amaryllis praise that heavenly lay, That shortened, as we went, our tedious way,— “O Tityrus, tend my herd, and see them fed; To morning pastures, evening waters, led; And 'ware the Libyan ridgil's butting head.” MŒRIS. Or what unfinished he to Varus read:— “Thy name, O Varus (if the kinder powers Preserve our plains, and shield the Mantuan towers, Obnoxious by Cremona's neighbouring crime), The wings of swans, and stronger-pinioned rhyme, Shall raise aloft, and soaring bear above— The immortal gift of gratitude to Jove.” LYCIDAS. Sing on, sing on; for I can ne'er be cloyed. So may thy swarms the baleful yew avoid; So may thy cows their burdened bags distend, And trees to goats their willing branches bend. Mean as I am, yet have the Muses made Me free, a member of the tuneful trade: At least the shepherds seem to like my lays; But I discern their flattery from their praise: I nor to Cinna's ears, nor Varus', dare aspire, But gabble, like a goose, amidst the swan-like choir. MŒRIS. 'Tis what I have been conning in my mind; Nor are they verses of a vulgar kind. “Come, Galatea! come! the seas forsake! What pleasures can the tides with their hoarse murmurs make? See, on the shore inhabits purple spring, Where nightingales their love-sick ditty sing: See, meads with purling streams, with flowers the ground, The grottoes cool, with shady poplars crowned, And creeping vines on arbours weaved around. Come then, and leave the waves' tumultuous roar; Let the wild surges vainly beat the shore.” LYCIDAS. Or that sweet song I heard with such delight; The same you sung alone one starry night. The tune I still retain, but not the words. MŒRIS. “Why, Daphnis, dost thou search in old records, To know the seasons when the stars arise? See, Cæsar's lamp is lighted in the skies,— The star, whose rays the blushing grapes adorn, And swell the kindly ripening ears of corn. Under this influence, graft the tender shoot; Thy children's children shall enjoy the fruit.” The rest I have forgot; for cares and time Change all things, and untune my soul to rhyme. I could have once sung down a summer's sun; But now the chime of poetry is done: My voice grows hoarse; I feel the notes decay, As if the wolves had seen me first to-day. But these, and more than I to mind can bring, Menalcas has not yet forgot to sing. LYCIDAS. Thy faint excuses but inflame me more: And now the waves roll silent to the shore; Husht winds the topmost branches scarcely bend, As if thy tuneful song they did attend: Already we have half our way o'ercome; Far off I can discern Bianor's tomb. Here, where the labourer's hands have formed a bower Of wreathing trees, in singing waste an hour. Rest here thy weary limbs; thy kids lay down: We've day before us yet to reach the town; Or if, ere night, the gathering clouds we fear, A song will help the beating storm to bear. And, that thou may'st not be too late abroad, Sing, and I'll ease thy shoulders of thy load. MŒRIS. Cease to request me; let us mind our way: Another song requires another day. When good Menalcas comes, if he rejoice, And find a friend at court, I'll find a voice. PASTORAL X. OR, GALLUS. ARGUMENT. Gallus, a great patron of Virgil, and an excellent poet, was very deeply in love with one Cytheris, whom he calls Lycoris, and who had forsaken him for the company of a soldier. The poet therefore supposes his friend Gallus retired, in his height of melancholy, into the solitudes of Arcadia (the celebrated scene of pastorals), where he represents him in a very languishing condition, with all the rural deities about him, pitying his hard usage, and condoling his misfortune. Thy sacred succour, Arethusa, bring, To crown my labour ('tis the last I sing), Which proud Lycoris may with pity view:— The Muse is mournful, though the numbers few. Refuse me not a verse, to grief and Gallus due. So may thy silver streams beneath the tide, Unmixed with briny seas, securely glide. Sing then my Gallus, and his hopeless vows; Sing, while my cattle crop the tender browse. The vocal grove shall answer to the sound, And echo, from the vales, the tuneful voice rebound. What lawns or woods withheld you from his aid, Ye nymphs, when Gallus was to love betrayed, To love, unpitied by the cruel maid? Not steepy Pindus could retard your course, Nor cleft Parnassus, nor the Aonian source: Nothing, that owns the Muses, could suspend Your aid to Gallus:—Gallus is their friend. For him the lofty laurel stands in tears, And hung with humid pearls the lowly shrub appears. Mænalian pines the godlike swain bemoan, When, spread beneath a rock, he sighed alone; And cold Lycæus wept from every dropping stone. The sheep surround their shepherd, as he lies: Blush not, sweet poet, nor the name despise. Along the streams, his flock Adonis fed; And yet the queen of beauty blest his bed. The swains and tardy neat-herds came, and last Menalcas, wet with beating winter mast. Wondering, they asked from whence arose thy flame. Yet more amazed, thy own Apollo came. Flushed were his cheeks, and glowing were his eyes: “Is she thy care? is she thy care?” he cries. “Thy false Lycoris flies thy love and thee, And, for thy rival, tempts the raging sea, The forms of horrid war, and heaven's inclemency.” Silvanus came: his brows a country crown Of fennel, and of nodding lilies, drown. Great Pan arrived; and we beheld him too, His cheeks and temples of vermilion hue. “Why, Gallus, this immoderate grief?” he cried. “Think'st thou that love with tears is satisfied? The meads are sooner drunk with morning dews, The bees with flowery shrubs, the goats with browse.” Unmoved, and with dejected eyes, he mourned: He paused, and then these broken words returned:— “'Tis past; and pity gives me no relief: But you, Arcadian swains, shall sing my grief, And on your hills my last complaints renew: So sad a song is only worthy you. How light would lie the turf upon my breast, If you my sufferings in your songs exprest! Ah! that your birth and business had been mine— To pen the sheep, and press the swelling vine! Had Phyllis or Amyntas caused my pain, Or any nymph or shepherd on the plain, (Though Phyllis brown, though black Amyntas were, Are violets not sweet, because not fair?) Beneath the sallows and the shady vine, My loves had mixed their pliant limbs with mine: Phyllis with myrtle wreaths had crowned my hair, And soft Amyntas sung away my care. Come, see what pleasures in our plains abound; The woods, the fountains, and the flowery ground. As you are beauteous, were you half so true, Here could I live, and love, and die with only you. Now I to fighting fields am sent afar, And strive in winter camps with toils of war; While you, (alas, that I should find it so!) To shun my sight, your native soil forego, And climb the frozen Alps, and tread the eternal snow. Ye frosts and snows, her tender body spare! Those are not limbs for icicles to tear. For me, the wilds and deserts are my choice; The Muses, once my care; my once harmonious voice. There will I sing, forsaken, and alone: The rocks and hollow caves shall echo to my moan. The rind of every plant her name shall know; And, as the rind extends, the love shall grow. Then on Arcadian mountains will I chase (Mixed with the woodland nymphs) the savage race; Nor cold shall hinder me, with horns and hounds To thrid the thickets, or to leap the mounds. And now methinks o'er steepy rocks I go, And rush through sounding woods, and bend the Parthian bow; As if with sports my sufferings I could ease, Or by my pains the god of love appease. My frenzy changes: I delight no more On mountain tops to chase the tusky boar: No game but hopeless love my thoughts pursue: Once more, ye nymphs, and songs, and sounding woods, adieu! Love alters not for us his hard decrees, Not though beneath the Thracian clime we freeze, Or Italy's indulgent heaven forego, And in mid-winter tread Sithonian snow; Or, when the barks of elms are scorched, we keep On Meroë's burning plains the Libyan sheep. In hell, and earth, and seas, and heaven above, Love conquers all; and we must yield to Love.” My Muses, here your sacred raptures end: The verse was what I owed my suffering friend. This while I sung, my sorrows I deceived, And bending osiers into baskets weaved. The song, because inspired by you, shall shine; And Gallus will approve, because 'tis mine— Gallus, for whom my holy flames renew, Each hour, and every moment rise in view; As alders, in the spring, their boles extend, And heave so fiercely, that the bark they rend. Now let us rise; for hoarseness oft invades The singer's voice, who sings beneath the shades. From juniper unwholesome dews distil, That blast the sooty corn, the withering herbage kill. Away, my goats, away! for you have browsed your fill. END OF THE THIRTEENTH VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. XIV., VOL. XV. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PHILIP, EARL OF CHESTERFIELD, &amp;c. GEORGICS. BOOK I. ARGUMENT. The Poet, in the beginning of this Book, propounds the general design of each Georgic: and, after a solemn invocation of all the gods who are any way related to his subject, he addresses himself, in particular, to Augustus, whom he compliments with divinity; and after strikes into his business. He shows the different kinds of tillage proper to different soils; traces out the original of agriculture; gives a catalogue of the husbandman's tools; specifies the employments peculiar to each season; describes the changes of the weather, with the signs in heaven and earth that forebode them; instances many of the prodigies that happened near the time of Julius Cæsar's death; and shuts up all with a supplication to the gods for the safety of Augustus, and the preservation of Rome. The poetry of this Book is more sublime than any part of Virgil, if I have any taste. And if ever I have copied his majestic style, it is here. The compliment he makes Augustus, almost in the beginning, is ill imitated by his successors, Lucan and Statius. They dedicated to tyrants; and their flatteries are gross and fulsome. Virgil's address is both more lofty and more just. In the three last lines of this Georgic, I think I have discovered a secret compliment to the emperor, which none of the commentators have observed. Virgil had just before described the miseries which Rome had undergone betwixt the triumvirs and the commonwealth party: in the close of all, he seems to excuse the crimes committed by his patron Cæsar, as if he were constrained, against his own temper, to those violent proceedings, by the necessity of the times in general, but more particularly by his two partners, Antony and Lepidus, Fertur equis auriga, neque audit currvs habenas. They were the headstrong horses, who hurried Octavius, the trembling charioteer, along, and were deaf to his reclaiming them. I observe, further, that the present wars, in which all Europe, and part of Asia, are engaged at present, are waged in the same places here described— Hinc movet Euphrates, illinc Germania, bellum, etc., as if Virgil had prophesied of this age. What makes a plenteous harvest, when to turn The fruitful soil, and when to sow the corn; The care of sheep, of oxen, and of kine, And how to raise on elms the teeming vine; The birth and genius of the frugal Bee, I sing, Mæcenas, and I sing to thee. Ye deities! who fields and plains protect, Who rule the seasons, and the year direct, Bacchus and fostering Ceres, powers divine, Who gave us corn for mast, for water, wine— Ye Fauns, propitious to the rural swains, Ye Nymphs, that haunt the mountains and the plains, Join in my work, and to my numbers bring Your needful succour; for your gifts I sing. And thou, whose trident struck the teeming earth, And made a passage for the courser's birth; And thou, for whom the Cæan shore sustains The milky herds, that graze thy flowery plains; And thou, the shepherds' tutelary god, Leave, for a while, O Pan! thy loved abode; And, if Arcadian fleeces be thy care, From fields and mountains to my song repair. Inventor, Pallas, of the fattening oil, Thou founder of the plough, and ploughman's toil; And thou, whose hands the shroud-like cypress rear, Come, all ye gods and goddesses, that wear The rural honours, and increase the year; You, who supply the ground with seeds of grain; And you, who swell those seeds with kindly rain; And chiefly thou, whose undetermined state Is yet the business of the gods' debate, Whether in after times to be declared The patron of the world, and Rome's peculiar guard, Or o'er the fruits and seasons to preside, And the round circuit of the year to guide— Powerful of blessings, which thou strew'st around, And with thy goddess-mother's myrtle crowned. Or wilt thou, Cæsar, choose the watery reign, To smooth the surges, and correct the main? Then mariners, in storms, to thee shall pray; Even utmost Thule shall thy power obey; And Neptune shall resign the fasces of the sea. The watery virgins for thy bed shall strive, And Tethys all her waves in dowry give. Or wilt thou bless our summers with thy rays, And, seated near the Balance, poise the days, Where, in the void of heaven, a space is free, Betwixt the Scorpion and the Maid, for thee? The Scorpion, ready to receive thy laws, Yields half his region, and contracts his claws. Whatever part of heaven thou shalt obtain (For let not hell presume of such a reign; Nor let so dire a thirst of empire move Thy mind, to leave thy kindred gods above; Though Greece admires Elysium's blest retreat, Though Proserpine affects her silent seat, And, importuned by Ceres to remove, Prefers the fields below to those above), Be thou propitious, Cæsar! guide my course, And to my bold endeavours add thy force: Pity the poet's and the ploughman's cares; Interest thy greatness in our mean affairs, And use thyself betimes to hear (and grant) our prayers. While yet the spring is young, while earth unbinds Her frozen bosom to the western winds; While mountain snows dissolve against the sun, And streams, yet new, from precipices run; Even in this early dawning of the year, Produce the plough, and yoke the sturdy steer, And goad him till he groans beneath his toil, Till the bright share is buried in the soil. That crop rewards the greedy peasant's pains, Which twice the sun, and twice the cold sustains, And bursts the crowded barns with more than promised gains. But, ere we stir the yet unbroken ground, The various course of seasons must be found; The weather, and the setting of the winds, The culture suiting to the several kinds Of seeds and plants, and what will thrive and rise, And what the genius of the soil denies. This ground with Bacchus, that with Ceres, suits: That other loads the trees with happy fruits: A fourth, with grass unbidden, decks the ground. Thus Tmolus is with yellow saffron crowned: India black ebon and white ivory bears; And soft Idume weeps her odorous tears. Thus Pontus sends her beaver-stones from far; And naked Spaniards temper steel for war: Epirus, for the Elean chariot, breeds (In hopes of palms) a race of running steeds. This is th'original contract; these the laws Imposed by Nature, and by Nature's cause, On sundry places, when Deucalion hurled His mother's entrails on the desert world; Whence men, a hard laborious kind, were born. Then borrow part of winter for thy corn; And early, with thy team, the glebe in furrows turn; That, while the turf lies open and unbound, Succeeding suns may bake the mellow ground. But, if the soil be barren, only scar The surface, and but lightly print the share, When cold Arcturus rises with the sun; Lest wicked weeds the corn should overrun In watery soils; or lest the barren sand Should suck the moisture from the thirsty land. Both these unhappy soils the swain forbears, And keeps a sabbath of alternate years, That the spent earth may gather heart again, And, bettered by cessation, bear the grain. At least where vetches, pulse and tares, have stood, And stalks of lupines grew (a stubborn wood), The ensuing season, in return, may bear The bearded product of the golden year: For flax and oats will burn the tender field, And sleepy poppies harmful harvests yield. But sweet vicissitudes of rest and toil Make easy labour, and renew the soil. Yet sprinkle sordid ashes all around, And load with fattening dung thy fallow ground. Thus change of seeds for meagre soils is best; And earth manured, not idle, though at rest. Long practice has a sure improvement found, With kindled fires to burn the barren ground, When the light stubble, to the flames resigned, Is driven along, and crackles in the wind. Whether from hence the hollow womb of earth Is warmed with secret strength for better birth; Or, when the latent vice is cured by fire, Redundant humours through the pores expire; Or that the warmth distends the chinks, and makes New breathings, whence new nourishment she takes; Or that the heat the gaping ground constrains, New knits the surface, and new strings the veins; Lest soaking showers should pierce her secret seat, Or freezing Boreas chill her genial heat, Or scorching suns too violently beat. Nor is the profit small the peasant makes, Who smooths with harrows, or who pounds with rakes, The crumbling clods: nor Ceres from on high Regards his labours with a grudging eye; Nor his, who ploughs across the furrowed grounds, And on the back of earth inflicts new wounds; For he, with frequent exercise, commands The unwilling soil, and tames the stubborn lands. Ye swains, invoke the powers who rule the sky, For a moist summer, and a winter dry; For winter drought rewards the peasant's pain, And broods indulgent on the buried grain. Hence Mysia boasts her harvests, and the tops Of Gargarus admire their happy crops. When first the soil receives the fruitful seed, Make no delay, but cover it with speed: So fenced from cold, the pliant furrows break, Before the surly clod resists the rake; And call the floods from high, to rush amain With pregnant streams, to swell the teeming grain. Then, when the fiery suns too fiercely play, And shrivelled herbs on withering stems decay, The wary ploughman, on the mountain's brow, Undams his watery stores—huge torrents flow, And, rattling down the rocks, large moisture yield, Tempering the thirsty fever of the field— And, lest the stem, too feeble for the freight, Should scarce sustain the head's unwieldy weight, Sends in his feeding flocks betimes, to invade The rising bulk of the luxuriant blade, Ere yet the aspiring offspring of the grain O'ertops the ridges of the furrowed plain; And drains the standing waters, when they yield Too large a beverage to the drunken field. But most in autumn, and the showery spring, When dubious months uncertain weather bring; When fountains open, when impetuous rain Swells hasty brooks, and pours upon the plain; When earth with slime and mud is covered o'er, Or hollow places spew their watery store. Nor yet the ploughman, nor the labouring steer, Sustain alone the hazards of the year: But glutton geese, and the Strymonian crane, With foreign troops invade the tender grain; And towering weeds malignant shadows yield; And spreading succory chokes the rising field. The sire of gods and men, with hard decrees, Forbids our plenty to be bought with ease, And wills that mortal men, inured to toil, Should exercise, with pains, the grudging soil; Himself invented first the shining share, And whetted human industry by care; Himself did handicrafts and arts ordain, Nor suffered sloth to rust his active reign. Ere this, no peasant vexed the peaceful ground, Which only turfs and greens for altars found: No fences parted fields, nor marks nor bounds Distinguished acres of litigious grounds; But all was common, and the fruitful earth Was free to give her unexacted birth. Jove added venom to the viper's brood, And swelled, with raging storms, the peaceful flood; Commissioned hungry wolves t'infest the fold, And shook from oaken leaves the liquid gold; Removed from human reach the cheerful fire, And from the rivers bade the wine retire; That studious need might useful arts explore; From furrowed fields to reap the foodful store, And force the veins of clashing flints t'expire The lurking seeds of their celestial fire. Then first on seas the hollowed alder swam; Then sailors quartered heaven, and found a name For every fixed and every wandering star— The Pleiads, Hyads, and the Northern Car. Then toils for beasts, and lime for birds, were found, And deep-mouthed dogs did forest-walks surround; And casting-nets were spread in shallow brooks, Drags in the deep, and baits were hung on hooks. Then saws were toothed, and sounding axes made (For wedges first did yielding wood invade); And various arts in order did succeed, (What cannot endless labour, urged by need?) First Ceres taught, the ground with grain to sow, And armed with iron shares the crooked plough; When now Dodonian oaks no more supplied Their mast, and trees their forest-fruit denied. Soon was his labour doubled to the swain, And blasting mildews blackened all his grain: Tough thistles choked the fields, and killed the corn, And an unthrifty crop of weeds was born: Then burs and brambles, an unbidden crew Of graceless guests, the unhappy fields subdue; And oats unblest, and darnel domineers, And shoots its head above the shining ears; So that, unless the land with daily care Is exercised, and, with an iron war Of rakes and harrows, the proud foes expelled, And birds with clamours frighted from the field— Unless the boughs are lopped that shade the plain, And heaven invoked with vows for fruitful rain— On other crops you may with envy look, And shake for food the long-abandoned oak. Nor must we pass untold what arms they wield, Who labour tillage and the furrowed field; Without whose aid the ground her corn denies, And nothing can be sown, and nothing rise— The crooked plough, the share, the towering height Of waggons, and the cart's unwieldy weight, The sled, the tumbril, hurdles, and the flail, The fan of Bacchus, with the flying sail— These all must be prepared, if ploughmen hope The promised blessing of a bounteous crop. Young elms, with early force, in copses bow, Fit for the figure of the crooked plough. Of eight foot long a fastened beam prepare: On either side the head, produce an ear; And sink a socket for the shining share. Of beech the plough-tail, and the bending yoke, Or softer linden hardened in the smoke. I could be long in precepts; but I fear So mean a subject might offend your ear. Delve of convenient depth your thrashing-floor: With tempered clay then fill and face it o'er; And let the weighty roller run the round, To smooth the surface of the unequal ground; Lest, cracked with summer heats, the flooring flies, Or sinks, and through the crannies weeds arise: For sundry foes the rural realm surround: The field-mouse builds her garner under ground For gathered grain: the blind laborious mole In winding mazes works her hidden hole: In hollow caverns vermin make abode— The hissing serpent, and the swelling toad: The corn-devouring weasel here abides, And the wise ant her wintry store provides. Mark well the flowering almonds in the wood: If odorous blooms the bearing branches load, The glebe will answer to the sylvan reign; Great heats will follow, and large crops of grain. But, if a wood of leaves o'ershade the tree, Such and so barren will thy harvest be: In vain the hind shall vex the thrashing-floor; For empty chaff and straw will be thy store. Some steep their seed, and some in caldrons boil, With vigorous nitre and with lees of oil, O'er gentle fires, the exuberant juice to drain, And swell the flattering husks with fruitful grain. Yet is not the success for years assured, Though chosen is the seed, and fully cured, Unless the peasant, with his annual pain, Renews his choice, and culls the largest grain. Thus all below, whether by Nature's curse, Or Fate's decree, degenerate still worse. So the boat's brawny crew the current stem, And, slow advancing, struggle with the stream: But, if they slack their hands, or cease to strive, Then down the flood with headlong haste they drive. Nor must the ploughman less observe the skies, When the Kids, Dragon, and Arcturus rise, Than sailors homeward bent, who cut their way Through Helle's stormy straits, and oyster-breeding sea. But, when Astræa's balance, hung on high, Betwixt the nights and days divides the sky, Then yoke your oxen, sow your winter grain, Till cold December comes with driving rain. Linseed and fruitful poppy bury warm, In a dry season, and prevent the storm. Sow beans and clover in a rotten soil, And millet rising from your annual toil, When with his golden horns, in full career, The Bull beats down the barriers of the year, And Argos and the Dog forsake the northern sphere. But, if your care to wheat alone extend, Let Maia with her sisters first descend, And the bright Gnossian diadem downward bend, Before you trust in earth your future hope; Or else expect a listless lazy crop. Some swains have sown before; but most have found A husky harvest from the grudging ground. Vile vetches would you sow, or lentils lean, The growth of Egypt, or the kidney-bean? Begin when the slow waggoner descends; Nor cease your sowing till mid-winter ends. For this, through twelve bright signs Apollo guides The year, and earth in several climes divides. Five girdles bind the skies: the torrid zone Glows with the passing and repassing sun: Far on the right and left, the extremes of heaven To frosts and snows and bitter blasts are given: Betwixt the midst and these, the gods assigned Two habitable seats for human kind, And, 'cross their limits, cut a sloping way, Which the twelve signs in beauteous order sway. Two poles turn round the globe; one seen to rise O'er Scythian hills, and one in Libyan skies; The first sublime in heaven, the last is whirled Below the regions of the nether world. Around our pole the spiry Dragon glides, And, like a winding stream, the Bears divides— The less and greater, who, by Fate's decree, Abhor to dive beneath the southern sea. There, as they say, perpetual night is found In silence brooding on the unhappy ground: Or, when Aurora leaves our northern sphere, She lights the downward heaven, and rises there; And, when on us she breathes the living light, Red Vesper kindles there the tapers of the night. From hence uncertain seasons we may know, And when to reap the grain, and when to sow; Or when to fell the furzes; when 'tis meet To spread the flying canvas for the fleet. Observe what stars arise, or disappear; And the four quarters of the rolling year. But, when cold weather and continued rain The labouring husband in his house restrain, Let him forecast his work with timely care, Which else is huddled, when the skies are fair: Then let him mark the sheep, or whet the shining share, Or hollow trees for boats, or number o'er His sacks, or measure his increasing store, Or sharpen stakes, or head the forks, or twine The sallow twigs to tie the straggling vine; Or wicker baskets weave, or air the corn, Or grinded grain betwixt two marbles turn. No laws, divine or human, can restrain From necessary works the labouring swain. Even holidays and feasts permission yield To float the meadows, or to fence the field, To fire the brambles, snare the birds, and steep In wholesome water-falls the woolly sheep. And oft the drudging ass is driven, with toil, To neighbouring towns with apples and with oil; Returning, late and loaden, home with gain Of bartered pitch, and hand-mills for the grain. The lucky days, in each revolving moon, For labour choose: the fifth be sure to shun; That gave the Furies and pale Pluto birth, And armed, against the skies, the sons of earth. With mountains piled on mountains, thrice they strove To scale the steepy battlements of Jove; And thrice his lightning and red thunder played, And their demolished works in ruin laid. The seventh is, next the tenth, the best to join Young oxen to the yoke, and plant the vine. Then, weavers, stretch your stays upon the weft: The ninth is good for travel, bad for theft. Some works in dead of night are better done, Or when the morning dew prevents the sun. Parched meads and stubble mow by Phœbe's light, Which both require the coolness of the night; For moisture then abounds, and pearly rains Descend in silence to refresh the plains. The wife and husband equally conspire To work by night, and rake the winter fire: He sharpens torches in the glimmering room; She shoots the flying shuttle through the loom, Or boils in kettles must of wine, and skims, With leaves, the dregs that overflow the brims: And, till the watchful cock awakes the day, She sings, to drive the tedious hours away. But, in warm weather, when the skies are clear, By daylight reap the product of the year; And in the sun your golden grain display, And thrash it out, and winnow it by day. Plough naked, swain, and naked sow the land; For lazy winter numbs the labouring hand. In genial winter, swains enjoy their store, Forget their hardships, and recruit for more. The farmer to full bowls invites his friends, And, what he got with pains, with pleasure spends. So sailors, when escaped from stormy seas, First crown their vessels, then indulge their ease. Yet that's the proper time to thrash the wood For mast of oak, your fathers' homely food; To gather laurel-berries, and the spoil Of bloody-myrtles, and to press your oil; For stalking cranes to set the guileful snare; T'inclose the stags in toils, and hunt the hare! With Balearic slings, or Gnossian bow, To persecute from far the flying doe, Then, when the fleecy skies new clothe the wood, And cakes of rustling ice come rolling down the flood. Now sing we stormy stars, when autumn weighs The year, and adds to nights, and shortens days, And suns declining shine with feeble rays: What cares must then attend the toiling swain; Or when the low'ring spring, with lavish rain, Beats down the slender stem and bearded grain, While yet the head is green, or, lightly swelled With milky moisture, overlooks the field. Even when the farmer, now secure of fear, Sends in the swains to spoil the finished year, Even while the reaper fills his greedy hands, And binds the golden sheaves in brittle bands, Oft have I seen a sudden storm arise, From all the warring winds that sweep the skies: The heavy harvest from the root is torn, And whirled aloft the lighter stubble borne: With such a force the flying rack is driven, And such a winter wears the face of heaven: And oft whole sheets descend of sluicy rain, Sucked by the spongy clouds from off the main: The lofty skies at once come pouring down, The promised crop and golden labours drown. The dykes are filled; and, with a roaring sound, The rising rivers float the nether ground, And rocks the bellowing voice of boiling seas rebound. The father of the gods his glory shrouds, Involved in tempests, and a night of clouds; And, from the middle darkness flashing out, By fits he deals his fiery bolts about. Earth feels the motions of her angry god; Her entrails tremble, and her mountains nod, And flying beasts in forests seek abode: Deep horror seizes every human breast; Their pride is humble, and their fear confessed, While he from high his rolling thunder throws, And fires the mountains with repeated blows: The rocks are from their old foundations rent; The winds redouble, and the rains augment: The waves on heaps are dashed against the shore; And now the woods, and now the billows, roar. In fear of this, observe the starry signs, Where Saturn houses, and where Hermes joins. But first to heaven thy due devotions pay, And annual gifts on Ceres' altars lay. When winter's rage abates, when cheerful hours Awake the spring, and spring awakes the flowers, On the green turf thy careless limbs display, And celebrate the mighty Mother's day; For then the hills with pleasing shades are crowned, And sleeps are sweeter on the silken ground: With milder beams the sun securely shines; Fat are the lambs, and luscious are the wines. Let every swain adore her power divine, And milk and honey mix with sparkling wine: Let all the choir of clowns attend the show, In long procession, shouting as they go; Invoking her to bless their yearly stores, Inviting plenty to their crowded floors. Thus in the spring, and thus in summer's heat, Before the sickles touch the ripening wheat, On Ceres call; and let the labouring hind With oaken wreaths his hollow temples bind: On Ceres let him call, and Ceres praise, With uncouth dances, and with country lays. And that by certain signs we may presage Of heats and rains, and wind's impetuous rage, The Sovereign of the heavens has set on high The moon, to mark the changes of the sky; When southern blasts should cease, and when the swain Should near their folds his feeding flocks restrain. For, ere the rising winds begin to roar, The working seas advance to wash the shore; Soft whispers run along the leafy woods, And mountains whistle to the murmuring floods. Even then the doubtful billows scarce abstain From the tossed vessel on the troubled main; When crying cormorants forsake the sea, And, stretching to the covert, wing their way; When sportful coots run skimming o'er the strand; When watchful herons leave their watery strand, And, mounting upward with erected flight, Gain on the skies, and soar above the sight. And oft, before tempestuous winds arise, The seeming stars fall headlong from the skies, And, shooting through the darkness, gild the night With sweeping glories, and long trails of light; And chaff with eddy-winds is whirled around, And dancing leaves are lifted from the ground; And floating feathers on the waters play. But, when the winged thunder takes his way From the cold north, and east and west engage, And at their frontiers meet with equal rage, The clouds are crushed; a glut of gathered rain The hollow ditches fills, and floats the plain; And sailors furl their dropping sheets amain. Wet weather seldom hurts the most unwise; So plain the signs, such prophets are the skies. The wary crane foresees it first, and sails Above the storm, and leaves the lowly vales; The cow looks up, and from afar can find The change of heaven, and snuffs it in the wind; The swallow skims the river's watery face; The frogs renew the croaks of their loquacious race; The careful ant her secret cell forsakes, And drags her eggs along the narrow tracks: At either horn the rainbow drinks the flood; Huge flocks of rising rooks forsake their food, And, crying, seek the shelter of the wood. Besides, the several sorts of watery fowls, That swim the seas, or haunt the standing pools, The swans that sail along the silver flood, And dive with stretching necks to search their food, Then lave their backs with sprinkling dews in vain, And stem the stream to meet the promised rain. The crow with clamorous cries the shower demands, And single stalks along the desert sands. The nightly virgin, while her wheel she plies, Foresees the storm impending in the skies, When sparkling lamps their sputtering light advance, And in the sockets oily bubbles dance. Then, after showers, 'tis easy to descry Returning suns, and a serener sky: The stars shine smarter; and the moon adorns, As with unborrowed beams, her sharpened horns. The filmy gossamer now flits no more, Nor halcyons bask on the short sunny shore: Their litter is not tossed by sows unclean; But a blue droughty mist descends upon the plain; And owls, that mark the setting sun, declare A starlight evening, and a morning fair. Towering aloft, avenging Nisus flies, While, dared, below the guilty Scylla lies. Wherever frighted Scylla flies away, Swift Nisus follows, and pursues his prey: Where injured Nisus takes his airy course, Thence trembling Scylla flies, and shuns his force. This punishment pursues the unhappy maid, And thus the purple hair is dearly paid: Then, thrice the ravens rend the liquid air, And croaking notes proclaim the settled fair. Then round their airy palaces they fly, To greet the sun; and, seized with secret joy, When storms are over-blown, with food repair To their forsaken nests, and callow care. Not that I think their breasts with heavenly souls Inspired, as man, who destiny controls; But, with the changeful temper of the skies, As rains condense, and sunshine rarefies, So turn the species in their altered minds, Composed by calms, and discomposed by winds. From hence proceeds the birds' harmonious voice; From hence the cows exult, and frisking lambs rejoice. Observe the daily circle of the sun, And the short year of each revolving moon: By them thou shalt foresee the following day, Nor shall a starry night thy hopes betray. When first the moon appears, if then she shrouds Her silver crescent tipped with sable clouds, Conclude she bodes a tempest on the main, And brews for fields impetuous floods of rain. Or, if her face with fiery flushing glow, Expect the rattling winds aloft to blow. But, four nights old (for that's the surest sign), With sharpened horns if glorious then she shine, Next day, nor only that, but all the moon, 'Till her revolving race be wholly run, Are void of tempests, both by land and sea, And sailors in the port their promised vow shall pay. Above the rest, the sun, who never lies, Foretells the change of weather in the skies: For, if he rise unwilling to his race, Clouds on his brow, and spots upon his face, Or if through mists he shoots his sullen beams, Frugal of light, in loose and straggling streams; Suspect a drizzling day, with southern rain, Fatal to fruits, and flocks, and promised grain. Or if Aurora, with half-opened eyes, And a pale sickly cheek, salute the skies; How shall the vine, with tender leaves, defend Her teeming clusters, when the storms descend, When ridgy roofs and tiles can scarce avail To bar the ruin of the rattling hail? But, more than all, the setting sun survey, When down the steep of heaven he drives the day: For oft we find him finishing his race, With various colours erring on his face. If fiery red his glowing globe descends, High winds and furious tempests he portends: But, if his cheeks are swoln with livid blue, He bodes wet weather by his watery hue: If dusky spots are varied on his brow, And, streaked with red, a troubled colour show; That sullen mixture shall at once declare Winds, rain, and storms, and elemental war. What desperate madman then would venture o'er The frith, or haul his cables from the shore? But, if with purple rays he brings the light, And a pure heaven resigns to quiet night, No rising winds, or falling storms, are nigh; But northern breezes through the forest fly, And drive the rack, and purge the ruffled sky. The unerring sun by certain signs declares, What the late even or early morn prepares, And when the south projects a stormy day, And when the clearing north will puff the clouds away. The sun reveals the secrets of the sky; And who dares give the source of light the lie? The change of empires often he declares, Fierce tumults, hidden treasons, open wars. He first the fate of Cæsar did foretell, And pitied Rome, when Rome in Cæsar fell; In iron clouds concealed the public light, And impious mortals feared eternal night. Nor was the fact foretold by him alone,— Nature herself stood forth, and seconded the sun. Earth, air, and seas, with prodigies were signed; And birds obscene, and howling dogs, divined. What rocks did Ætna's bellowing mouth expire From her torn entrails! and what floods of fire! What clanks were heard, in German skies afar, Of arms, and armies rushing to the war! Dire earthquakes rent the solid Alps below, And from their summits shook the eternal snow; Pale spectres in the close of night were seen, And voices heard, of more than mortal men, In silent groves: dumb sheep and oxen spoke; And streams ran backward, and their beds forsook: The yawning earth disclosed the abyss of hell, The weeping statues did the wars foretell, And holy sweat from brazen idols fell. Then, rising in his might, the king of floods Rushed through the forests, tore the lofty woods, And, rolling onward, with a sweepy sway, Bore houses, herds, and labouring hinds away. Blood sprang from wells, wolves howled in towns by night, And boding victims did the priests affright. Such peals of thunder never poured from high, Nor lightnings flashed from so serene a sky. Red meteors ran across the ethereal space; Stars disappeared, and comets took their place. For this, the Emathian plains once more were strewed With Roman bodies, and just heaven thought good To fatten twice those fields with Roman blood. Then, after length of time, the labouring swains, Who turn the turfs of those unhappy plains, Shall rusty piles from the ploughed furrows take, And over empty helmets pass the rake— Amazed at antique titles on the stones, And mighty relics of gigantic bones. Ye home-born deities, of mortal birth! Thou father Romulus, and mother Earth, Goddess unmoved! whose guardian arms extend O'er Tuscan Tiber's course, and Roman towers defend; With youthful Cæsar your joint powers engage, Nor hinder him to save the sinking age. O! let the blood, already spilt, atone For the past crimes of cursed Laomedon! Heaven wants thee there; and long the gods, we know, Have grudged thee, Cæsar, to the world below, Where fraud and rapine right and wrong confound, Where impious arms from every part resound, And monstrous crimes in every shape are crowned. The peaceful peasant to the wars is pressed; The fields lie fallow in inglorious rest; The plain no pasture to the flock affords; The crooked scythes are straightened into swords: And there Euphrates her soft offspring arms, And here the Rhine rebellows with alarms; The neighbouring cities range on several sides, Perfidious Mars long-plighted leagues divides, And o'er the wasted world in triumph rides. So four fierce coursers, starting to the race, Scour through the plain, and lengthen every pace; Nor reins, nor curbs, nor threatening cries, they fear, But force along the trembling charioteer. BOOK II. ARGUMENT. The subject of the following Book is planting: in handling of which argument, the poet shows all the different methods of raising trees, describes their variety, and gives rules for the management of each in particular. He then points out the soils in which the several plants thrive best, and thence takes occasion to run out into the praises of Italy: after which, he gives some directions for discovering the nature of every soil, prescribes rules for dressing of vines, olives, &amp;c., and concludes the Georgic with a panegyric on a country life. The Praises of Italy (translated by the learned and every way excellent Mr. Chetwood), which are printed in one of my Miscellany Poems, are the greatest ornament of this Book: wherein, for want of sufficient skill in gardening, agriculture, etc., I may possibly be mistaken in some terms. But concerning grafting, my honoured friend Sir William Bowyer has assured me that Virgil has shown more of poetry than skill, at least in relation to our more northern climates; and that many of our stocks will not receive such grafts as our poet tells us would bear in Italy. Nature has conspired with art to make the garden at Denham Court, of Sir William's own plantation, one of the most delicious spots of ground in England: it contains not above five acres (just the compass of Alcinoüs' garden, described in the Odysses); but Virgil says, in this very Georgic, ? Laudato ingentia rura; Exiguum colito. Thus far of tillage, and of heavenly signs: Now sing, my Muse, the growth of generous vines, The shady groves, the woodland progeny, And the slow product of Minerva's tree. Great father Bacchus! to my song repair; For clustering grapes are thy peculiar care: For thee, large bunches load the bending vine, And the last blessings of the year are thine. To thee his joys the jolly autumn owes, When the fermenting juice the vat o'erflows. Come, strip with me, my god! come drench all o'er Thy limbs in must of wine, and drink at every pore. Some trees their birth to bounteous Nature owe; For some, without the pains of planting, grow. With osiers thus the banks of brooks abound, Sprung from the watery genius of the ground. From the same principles grey willows come, Herculean poplar, and the tender broom. But some, from seeds inclosed in earth, arise; For thus the mastful chestnut mates the skies. Hence rise the branching beech and vocal oak, Where Jove of old oraculously spoke. Some from the root a rising wood disclose: Thus elms, and thus the savage cherry grows: Thus the green bay, that binds the poet's brows, Shoots, and is sheltered by the mother's boughs. These ways of planting Nature did ordain, For trees and shrubs, and all the sylvan reign. Others there are, by late experience found: Some cut the shoots, and plant in furrowed ground; Some cover rooted stalks in deeper mould; Some, cloven stakes; and (wondrous to behold!) Their sharpened ends in earth their footing place; And the dry poles produce a living race. Some bow their vines, which buried in the plain, Their tops in distant arches rise again. Others no root require; the labourer cuts Young slips, and in the soil securely puts. Even stumps of olives, bared of leaves, and dead, Revive, and oft redeem their withered head. 'Tis usual now an inmate graff to see With insolence invade a foreign tree: Thus pears and quinces from the crabtree come, And thus the ruddy cornel bears the plum. Then let the learned gardener mark with care The kinds of stocks, and what those kinds will bear; Explore the nature of each several tree, And, known, improve with artful industry: And let no spot of idle earth be found, But cultivate the genius of the ground: For open Ismarus will Bacchus please; Taburnus loves the shade of olive-trees. The virtues of the several soils I sing.— Mæcenas, now thy needful succour bring! O thou! the better part of my renown, Inspire thy poet, and thy poem crown: Embark with me, while I new tracts explore, With flying sails and breezes from the shore: Not that my song, in such a scanty space, So large a subject fully can embrace— Not though I were supplied with iron lungs, A hundred mouths, filled with as many tongues: But steer my vessel with a steady hand, And coast along the shore in sight of land. Nor will I tire thy patience with a train Of preface, or what ancient poets feign. The trees, which of themselves advance in air, Are barren kinds, but strongly built and fair, Because the vigour of the native earth Maintains the plant, and makes a manly birth. Yet these, receiving graffs of other kind, Or thence transplanted, change their savage mind, Their wildness lose, and, quitting Nature's part, Obey the rules and discipline of art. The same do trees, that, sprung from barren roots, In open fields transplanted bear their fruits. For, where they grow, the native energy Turns all into the substance of the tree, Starves and destroys the fruit, is only made For brawny bulk, and for a barren shade. The plant that shoots from seed, a sullen tree, At leisure grows, for late posterity; The generous flavour lost, the fruits decay, And savage grapes are made the birds' ignoble prey. Much labour is required in trees, to tame Their wild disorder, and in ranks reclaim. Well must the ground be digged, and better dressed, New soil to make, and meliorate the rest. Old stakes of olive-trees in plants revive; By the same method Paphian myrtles live; But nobler vines by propagation thrive. From roots hard hazels, and from cions, rise; Tall ash, and taller oak that mates the skies; Palm, poplar, fir, descending from the steep Of hills, to try the dangers of the deep. The thin-leaved arbute hazel-graffs receives; And planes huge apples bear, that bore but leaves. Thus mastful beech the bristly chestnut bears, And the wild ash is white with blooming pears, And greedy swine from grafted elms are fed With falling acorns, that on oaks are bred. But various are the ways to change the state Of plants, to bud, to graff, to inoculate. For, where the tender rinds of trees disclose Their shooting gems, a swelling knot there grows; Just in that space a narrow slit we make, Then other buds from bearing trees we take; Inserted thus, the wounded rind we close, In whose moist womb the admitted infant grows. But, when the smoother bole from knots is free, We make a deep incision in the tree, And in the solid wood the slip inclose; The batt'ning bastard shoots again and grows; And in short space the laden boughs arise, With happy fruit advancing to the skies. The mother plant admires the leaves unknown Of alien trees, and apples not her own. Of vegetable woods are various kinds, And the same species are of several minds. Lotes, willows, elms, have different forms allowed; So funeral cypress, rising like a shroud. Fat olive-trees of sundry sorts appear, Of sundry shapes their unctuous berries bear. Radii long olives, Orchites round produce, And bitter Pausia, pounded for the juice. Alcinoüs' orchard various apples bears: Unlike are bergamots and pounder pears. Nor our Italian vines produce the shape, Or taste, or flavour, of the Lesbian grape. The Thasian vines in richer soils abound; The Mareotic grow in barren ground. The Psythian grape we dry: Lagean juice Will stammering tongues and staggering feet produce. Rathe ripe are some, and some of later kind, Of golden some, and some of purple rind. How shall I praise the Rhætian grape divine, Which yet contends not with Falernian wine? The Aminean many a consulship survives, And longer than the Lydian vintage lives, Or high Phanæus, king of Chian growth: But, for large quantities and lasting, both, The less Argitis bears the prize away. The Rhodian, sacred to the solemn day, In second services is poured to Jove, And best accepted by the gods above. Nor must Bumastus his old honours lose, In length and largeness like the dugs of cows. I pass the rest, whose every race, and name, And kinds, are less material to my theme; Which who would learn, as soon may tell the sands, Driven by the western wind on Libyan lands, Or number, when the blustering Eurus roars, The billows beating on Ionian shores. Nor every plant on every soil will grow: The sallow loves the watery ground, and low; The marshes, alders: Nature seems to ordain The rocky cliff for the wild ash's reign; The baleful yew to northern blasts assigns, To shores the myrtles, and to mounts the vines. Regard the extremest cultivated coast, From hot Arabia to the Scythian frost: All sorts of trees their several countries know; Black ebon only will in India grow, And odorous frankincense on the Sabæan bough. Balm slowly trickles through the bleeding veins Of happy shrubs in Idumæan plains. The green Egyptian thorn, for medicine good, With Æthiops' hoary trees and woolly wood, Let others tell; and how the Seres spin Their fleecy forests in a slender twine; With mighty trunks of trees on Indian shores, Whose height above the feathered arrow soars, Shot from the toughest bow, and, by the brawn Of expert archers, with vast vigour drawn. Sharp-tasted citrons Median climes produce, (Bitter the rind, but generous is the juice,) A cordial fruit, a present antidote Against the direful stepdame's deadly draught, Who, mixing wicked weeds with words impure, The fate of envied orphans would procure. Large is the plant, and like a laurel grows, And, did it not a different scent disclose, A laurel were: the fragrant flowers contemn The stormy winds, tenacious of their stem. With this, the Medes to labouring age bequeath New lungs, and cure the sourness of the breath. But neither Median woods (a plenteous land), Fair Ganges, Hermus rolling golden sand, Nor Bactria, nor the richer Indian fields, Nor all the gummy stores Arabia yields, Nor any foreign earth of greater name, Can with sweet Italy contend in fame. No bulls, whose nostrils breathe a living flame, Have turned our turf; no teeth of serpents here Were sown, an armed host and iron crop to bear. But fruitful vines, and the fat olive's freight, And harvests heavy with their fruitful weight, Adorn our fields; and on the cheerful green The grazing flocks and lowing herds are seen. The warrior horse, here bred, is taught to train: There flows Clitumnus through the flowery plain, Whose waves, for triumphs after prosperous war, The victim ox and snowy sheep prepare. Perpetual spring our happy climate sees: Twice breed the cattle, and twice bear the trees; And summer suns recede by slow degrees. Our land is from the rage of tigers freed, Nor nourishes the lion's angry seed; Nor poisonous aconite is here produced, Or grows unknown, or is, when known, refused; Nor in so vast a length our serpents glide, Or raised on such a spiry volume ride. Next add our cities of illustrious name, Their costly labour, and stupendous frame; Our forts on steepy hills, that far below See wanton streams in winding valleys flow; Our twofold seas, that, washing either side, A rich recruit of foreign stores provide; Our spacious lakes; thee, Larius, first; and next Benacus, with tempestuous billows vexed. Or shall I praise thy ports, or mention make Of the vast mound that binds the Lucrine lake? Or the disdainful sea, that, shut from thence, Roars round the structure, and invades the fence, There, where secure the Julian waters glide, Or where Avernus' jaws admit the Tyrrhene tide? Our quarries, deep in earth, were famed of old For veins of silver, and for ore of gold. The inhabitants themselves their country grace: Hence rose the Marsian and Sabellian race, Strong-limbed and stout, and to the wars inclined, And hard Ligurians, a laborious kind, And Volscians armed with iron-headed darts. Besides—an offspring of undaunted hearts— The Decii, Marii, great Camillus, came From hence, and greater Scipio's double name, And mighty Cæsar, whose victorious arms To furthest Asia carry fierce alarms, Avert unwarlike Indians from his Rome, Triumph abroad, secure our peace at home. Hail, sweet Saturnian soil! of fruitful grain Great parent, greater of illustrious men! For thee my tuneful accents will I raise, And treat of arts disclosed in ancient days, Once more unlock for thee the sacred spring, And old Ascræan verse in Roman cities sing. The nature of the several soils now see, Their strength, their colour, their fertility: And first for heath, and barren hilly ground, Where meagre clay and flinty stones abound, Where the poor soil all succour seems to want— Yet this suffices the Palladian plant. Undoubted signs of such a soil are found; For here wild olive-shoots o'erspread the ground, And heaps of berries strew the fields around. But, where the soil, with fattening moisture filled, Is clothed with grass, and fruitful to be tilled, Such as in cheerful vales we view from high, Which dripping rocks with rolling streams supply, And feed with ooze; where rising hillocks run In length, and open to the southern sun; Where fern succeeds, ungrateful to the plough— That gentle ground to generous grapes allow. Strong stocks of vines it will in time produce, And overflow the vats with friendly juice, Such as our priests in golden goblets pour To gods, the givers of the cheerful hour, Then when the bloated Tuscan blows his horn, And reeking entrails are in chargers borne. If herds or fleecy flocks be more thy care, Or goats that graze the field, and burn it bare, Then seek Tarentum's lawns, and furthest coast, Or such a field as hapless Mantua lost, Where silver swans sail down the watery road, And graze the floating herbage of the flood. There crystal streams perpetual tenor keep, Nor food nor springs are wanting to thy sheep; For, what the day devours, the nightly dew Shall to the morn in pearly drops renew. Fat crumbling earth is fitter for the plough, Putrid and loose above, and black below; For ploughing is an imitative toil, Resembling nature in an easy soil. No land for seed like this; no fields afford So large an income to the village lord: No toiling teams from harvest-labour come So late at night, so heavy-laden home. The like of forest land is understood, From whence the surly ploughman grubs the wood, Which had for length of ages idle stood. Then birds forsake the ruins of their seat, And, flying from their nests, their callow young forget. The coarse lean gravel, on the mountain-sides, Scarce dewy beverage for the bees provides; Nor chalk nor crumbling stones, the food of snakes, That work in hollow earth their winding tracks The soil exhaling clouds of subtile dews, Imbibing moisture which with ease she spews, Which rusts not iron, and whose mould is clean, Well clothed with cheerful grass, and ever green, Is good for olives, and aspiring vines, Embracing husband elms in amorous twines; Is fit for feeding cattle, fit to sow, And equal to the pasture and the plough. Such is the soil of fat Campanian fields; Such large increase Vesuvian mola yields; And such a country could Acerra boast, Till Clanius overflowed the unhappy coast. I teach thee next the different soils to know, The light for vines, the heavier for the plough. Choose first a place for such a purpose fit: There dig the solid earth, and sink a pit; Next fill the hole with its own earth again, And trample with thy feet, and tread it in: Then, if it rise not to the former height Of superfice, conclude that soil is light, A proper ground for pasturage and vines. But, if the sullen earth, so pressed, repines Within its native mansion to retire, And stays without, a heap of heavy mire, 'Tis good for arable, a glebe that asks Tough teams of oxen, and laborious tasks. Salt earth and bitter are not fit to sow, Nor will be tamed or mended with the plough. Sweet grapes degenerate there; and fruits, declined From their first flavorous taste, renounce their kind. This truth by sure experiment is tried; For first an osier colander provide Of twigs thick wrought (such toiling peasants twine, When through straight passages they strain their wine): In this close vessel place that earth accursed, But filled brimful with wholesome water first; Then run it through; the drops will rope around, And, by the bitter taste, disclose the ground. The fatter earth by handling we may find, With ease distinguished from the meagre kind: Poor soil will crumble into dust; the rich Will to the fingers cleave like clammy pitch: Moist earth produces corn and grass, but both Too rank and too luxuriant in their growth. Let not my land so large a promise boast, Lest the lank ears in length of stem be lost. The heavier earth is by her weight betrayed; The lighter in the poising hand is weighed. 'Tis easy to distinguish by the sight, The colour of the soil, and black from white. But the cold ground is difficult to know; Yet this the plants, that prosper there, will show— Black ivy, pitch-trees, and the baleful yew. These rules considered well, with early care The vineyard destined for thy vines prepare: But, long before the planting, dig the ground, With furrows deep that cast a rising mound. The clods, exposed to winter winds, will bake; For putrid earth will best in vineyards take; And hoary frosts, after the painful toil Of delving hinds, will rot the mellow soil. Some peasants, not to omit the nicest care, Of the same soil their nursery prepare, With that of their plantation; lest the tree, Translated, should not with the soil agree. Beside, to plant it as it was, they mark The heaven's four quarters on the tender bark, And to the north or south restore the side, Which at their birth did heat or cold abide: So strong is custom; such effects can use In tender souls of pliant plants produce. Choose next a province for thy vineyard's reign, On hills above, or in the lowly plain. If fertile fields or valleys be thy choice, Plant thick; for bounteous Bacchus will rejoice In close plantations there; but, if the vine On rising ground be placed, or hills supine, Extend thy loose battalions largely wide, Opening thy ranks and files on either side, But marshalled all in order as they stand; And let no soldier straggle from his band. As legions in the field their front display, To try the fortune of some doubtful day, And move to meet their foes with sober pace, Strict to their figure, though in wider space, Before the battle joins, while from afar The field yet glitters with the pomp of war, And equal Mars, like an impartial lord, Leaves all to fortune, and the dint of sword— So let thy vines in intervals be set, But not their rural discipline forget; Indulge their width, and add a roomy space, That their extremest lines may scarce embrace: Nor this alone to indulge a vain delight, And make a pleasing prospect for the sight; But, for the ground itself, this only way Can equal vigour to the plants convey, Which, crowded, want the room, their branches to display. How deep they must be planted, wouldst thou know? In shallow furrows vines securely grow. Not so the rest of plants; for Jove's own tree, That holds the woods in awful sovereignty, Requires a depth of lodging in the ground, And, next the lower skies, a bed profound: High as his topmost boughs to heaven ascend, So low his roots to hell's dominion tend. Therefore, nor winds, nor winter's rage o'erthrows His bulky body, but unmoved he grows; For length of ages lasts his happy reign, And lives of mortal man contend in vain. Full in the midst of his own strength he stands, Stretching his brawny arms, and leafy hands; His shade protects the plains, his head the hills commands. The hurtful hazel in thy vineyard shun; Nor plant it to receive the setting sun; Nor break the topmost branches from the tree; Nor prune, with blunted knife, the progeny. Root up wild olives from thy laboured lands; For sparkling fire, from hinds' unwary hands, Is often scattered o'er their unctuous rinds, And after spread abroad by raging winds: For first the smouldering flame the trunk receives; Ascending thence, it crackles in the leaves; At length victorious to the top aspires, Involving all the wood with smoky fires; But most, when, driven by winds, the flaming storm Of the long files destroys the beauteous form. In ashes then the unhappy vineyard lies; Nor will the blasted plants from ruin rise; Nor will the withered stock be green again; But the wild olive shoots, and shades the ungrateful plain. Be not seduced with wisdom's empty shows, To stir the peaceful ground where Boreas blows. When winter frosts constrain the field with cold, The fainty root can take no steady hold. But, when the golden spring reveals the year, And the white bird returns, whom serpents fear, That season deem the best to plant thy vines: Next that, is when autumnal warmth declines, Ere heat is quite decayed, or cold begun, Or Capricorn admits the winter sun. The spring adorns the woods, renews the leaves; The womb of earth the genial seed receives: For then almighty Jove descends, and pours Into his buxom bride his fruitful showers; And, mixing his large limbs with hers, he feeds Her births with kindly juice, and fosters teeming seeds. Then joyous birds frequent the lonely grove, And beasts, by nature stung, renew their love. Then fields the blades of buried corn disclose; And, while the balmy western spirit blows, Earth to the breath her bosom dares expose. With kindly moisture then the plants abound; The grass securely springs above the ground; The tender twig shoots upward to the skies, And on the faith of the new sun relies. The swerving vines on the tall elms prevail; Unhurt by southern showers, or northern hail, They spread their gems, the genial warmth to share, And boldly trust their buds in open air. In this soft season (let me dare to sing), The world was hatched by heaven's imperial king— In prime of all the year, and holidays of spring Earth knew no season then but spring alone; On the moist ground the sun serenely shone; Then winter winds their blustering rage forbear, And in a silent pomp proceeds the mighty year. Sheep now were sent to people flowery fields, And savage beasts were banished into wilds; Then heaven was lighted up with stars, and man, A hard relentless race, from stones began. Nor could the tender new creation bear The excessive heats or coldness of the year, But, chilled by winter, or by summer fired, The middle temper of the spring required, When warmth and moisture did at once abound, And heaven's indulgence brooded on the ground. For what remains, in depth of earth secure Thy covered plants, and dung with hot manure; And shells and gravel in the ground inclose; For through their hollow chinks the water flows, Which, thus imbibed, returns in misty dews, And, steaming up, the rising plant renews. Some husbandmen of late, have found the way, A hilly heap of stones above to lay, And press the plants with shards of potters' clay. This fence against immoderate rain they found, Or when the Dog-star cleaves the thirsty ground. Be mindful, when thou hast entombed the shoot, With store of earth around to feed the root; With iron teeth of rakes and prongs, to move The crusted earth, and loosen it above. Then exercise thy struggling steers to plough Betwixt thy vines, and teach thy feeble row To mount on reeds, and wands, and, upward led, On ashen poles to raise their forky head. On these new crutches let them learn to walk, Till, swerving upwards with a stronger stalk, They brave the winds, and, clinging to their guide, On tops of elms at length triumphant ride. But, in their tender nonage, while they spread Their springing leaves, and lift their infant head, And upward while they shoot in open air, Indulge their childhood, and the nurslings spare; Nor exercise thy rage on new-born life; But let thy hand supply the pruning-knife, And crop luxuriant stragglers, nor be loth To strip the branches of their leafy growth. But, when the rooted vines, with steady hold, Can clasp their elms, then, husbandman, be bold To lop the disobedient boughs, that strayed Beyond their ranks; let crooked steel invade The lawless troops, which discipline disclaim, And their superfluous growth with rigour tame. Next, fenced with hedges and deep ditches round, Exclude the encroaching cattle from thy ground, While yet the tender gems but just appear, Unable to sustain the uncertain year; Whose leaves are not alone foul winter's prey, But oft by summer suns are scorched away, And, worse than both, become the unworthy browse Of buffaloes, salt goats, and hungry cows. For not December's frost, that burns the boughs, Nor dog-days' parching heat, that splits the rocks, Are half so harmful as the greedy flocks, Their venomed bite, and scars indented on the stocks. For this, the malefactor goat was laid On Bacchus' altar, and his forfeit paid. At Athens thus old comedy began, When round the streets the reeling actors ran, In country villages, and crossing ways, Contending for the prizes of their plays; And, glad with Bacchus, on the grassy soil, Leaped o'er the skins of goats besmeared with oil. Thus Roman youth, derived from ruined Troy, In rude Saturnian rhymes express their joy; With taunts, and laughter loud, their audience please, Deformed with vizards, cut from barks of trees: In jolly hymns they praise the god of wine, Whose earthen images adorn the pine, And there are hung on high, in honour of the vine. A madness so devout the vineyard fills; In hollow valleys and on rising hills, On whate'er side he turns his honest face, And dances in the wind, those fields are in his grace. To Bacchus therefore let us tune our lays, And in our mother tongue resound his praise. Thin cakes in chargers, and a guilty goat, Dragged by the horns, be to his altars brought; Whose offered entrails shall his crime reproach, And drip their fatness from the hazel broach. To dress thy vines, new labour is required; Nor must the painful husbandman be tired: For thrice, at least, in compass of the year, Thy vineyard must employ the sturdy steer To turn the glebe, besides thy daily pain To break the clods, and make the surface plain, To unload the branches, or the leaves to thin, That suck the vital moisture of the vine. Thus in a circle runs the peasant's pain, And the year rolls within itself again. Even in the lowest months, when storms have shed From vines the hairy honours of their head, Not then the drudging hind his labour ends, But to the coming year his care extends. Even then the naked vine he persecutes; His pruning knife at once reforms and cuts. Be first to dig the ground; be first to burn The branches lopt; and first the props return Into thy house, that bore the burdened vines; But last to reap the vintage of thy wines. Twice in the year luxuriant leaves o'ershade The encumbered vine; rough brambles twice invade: Hard laboured both! Commend the large excess Of spacious vineyards; cultivate the less. Besides, in woods the shrubs of prickly thorn, Sallows and reeds on banks of rivers born, Remain to cut; for vineyards useful found, To stay thy vines, and fence thy fruitful ground. Nor, when thy tender trees at length are bound, When peaceful vines from pruning-hooks are free, When husbands have surveyed the last degree, And utmost files of plants, and ordered every tree; Even when they sing at ease in full content, Insulting o'er the toils they underwent, Yet still they find a future task remain, To turn the soil, and break the clods again; And, after all, their joys are unsincere, While falling rains on ripening grapes they fear. Quite opposite to these are olives found: No dressing they require, and dread no wound, Nor rakes nor harrows need; but, fixed below, Rejoice in open air, and unconcernedly grow. The soil itself due nourishment supplies: Plough but the furrows, and the fruits arise, Content with small endeavours, till they spring. Soft peace they figure, and sweet plenty bring, Then olives plant, and hymns to Pallas sing. Thus apple-trees, whose trunks are strong to bear Their spreading boughs, exert themselves in air, Want no supply, but stand secure alone, Not trusting foreign forces, but their own, Till with the ruddy freight the bending branches groan. Thus trees of nature, and each common bush, Uncultivated thrive, and with red berries blush. Vile shrubs are shorn for browse; the towering height Of unctuous trees are torches for the night. And shall we doubt (indulging easy sloth), To sow, to set, and to reform their growth? To leave the lofty plants—the lowly kind Are for the shepherd or the sheep designed. Even humble broom and osiers have their use, And shade for sleep, and food for flocks, produce; Hedges for corn, and honey for the bees, Besides the pleasing prospect of the trees. How goodly looks Cytorus, ever green With boxen groves! with what delight are seen Narycian woods of pitch, whose gloomy shade Seems for retreat of heavenly Muses made! But much more pleasing are those fields to see, That need not ploughs, nor human industry. Even cold Caucasian rocks with trees are spread, And wear green forests on their hilly head. Though bending from the blast of eastern storms, Though shent their leaves, and shattered are their arms, Yet heaven their various plants for use designs— For houses, cedars—and, for shipping, pines— Cypress provides for spokes and wheels of wains, And all for keels of ships, that scour the watery plains. Willows in twigs are fruitful, elms in leaves; The war, from stubborn myrtle, shafts receives— From cornels, javelins; and the tougher yew Receives the bending figure of a bow. Nor box, nor limes, without their use are made, Smooth-grained, and proper for the turner's trade; Which curious hands may carve, and steel with ease invade. Light alder stems the Po's impetuous tide, And bees in hollow oaks their honey hide. Now balance, with these gifts, the fumy joys Of wine, attended with eternal noise, Wine urged to lawless lust the Centaurs' train; Through wine they quarrelled, and through wine were slain. O happy, if he knew his happy state, The swain, who, free from business and debate, Receives his easy food from nature's hand, And just returns of cultivated land! No palace, with a lofty gate, he wants, To admit the tide of early visitants, With eager eyes devouring, as they pass, The breathing figures of Corinthian brass. No statues threaten, from high pedestals; No Persian arras hides his homely walls, With antic vests, which, through their shady fold, Betray the streaks of ill-dissembled gold: He boasts no wool, whose native white is dyed With purple poison of Assyrian pride; No costly drugs of Araby defile, With foreign scents, the sweetness of his oil: But easy quiet, a secure retreat, A harmless life that knows not how to cheat, With home-bred plenty, the rich owner bless, And rural pleasures crown his happiness. Unvexed with quarrels, undisturbed with noise, The country king his peaceful realm enjoys— Cool grots, and living lakes, the flowery pride Of meads, and streams that through the valley glide, And shady groves that easy sleep invite, And, after toilsome days, a soft repose at night. Wild beasts of nature in his woods abound; And youth, of labour patient, plough the ground, Inured to hardship, and to homely fare. Nor venerable age is wanting there, In great examples to the youthful train; Nor are the gods adored with rites profane. From hence Astræa took her flight; and here The prints of her departing steps appear. Ye sacred Muses! with whose beauty fired, My soul is ravished, and my brain inspired— Whose priest I am, whose holy fillets wear— Would you your Virgil's first petition hear; Give me the ways of wandering stars to know, The depths of heaven above, and earth below: Teach me the various labours of the moon, And whence proceed the eclipses of the sun; Why flowing tides prevail upon the main, And in what dark recess they shrink again; What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays The summer nights, and shortens winter days. But, if my heavy blood restrain the flight Of my free soul, aspiring to the height Of nature, and unclouded fields of light— My next desire is, void of care and strife, To lead a soft, secure, inglorious life— A country cottage near a crystal flood, A winding valley, and a lofty wood. Some god conduct me to the sacred shades, Where Bacchanals are sung by Spartan maids, Or lift me high to Hæmus' hilly crown, Or in the plains of Tempe lay me down, Or lead me to some solitary place, And cover my retreat from human race. Happy the man, who, studying nature's laws, Through known effects can trace the sacred cause— His mind possessing in a quiet state, Fearless of fortune, and resigned to fate! And happy too is he, who decks the bowers Of Sylvans, and adores the rural powers— Whose mind, unmoved, the bribes of courts can see, Their glittering baits, and purple slavery— Nor hopes the people's praise, nor fears their frown, Nor, when contending kindred tear the crown, Will set up one, or pull another down. Without concern he hears, but hears from far, Of tumults, and descents, and distant war; Nor with a superstitious fear is awed, For what befalls at home, or what abroad. Nor envies he the rich their happy store, Nor with a helpless hand condoles the poor. He feeds on fruits, which, of their own accord, The willing ground and laden trees afford. From his loved home no lucre him can draw; The senate's mad decrees he never saw; Nor heard, at bawling bars, corrupted law. Some to the seas, and some to camps, resort, And some with impudence invade the court: In foreign countries, others seek renown; With wars and taxes, others waste their own, And houses burn, and household gods deface, To drink in bowls with glittering gems enchase, To loll on couches, rich with citron steads, And lay their guilty limbs in Tyrian beds. This wretch in earth entombs his golden ore, Hovering and brooding on his buried store. Some patriot fools to popular praise aspire Of public speeches, which worse fools admire, While, from both benches, with redoubled sounds, The applause of lords and commoners abounds. Some, through ambition, or through thirst of gold, Have slain their brothers, or their country sold, And, leaving their sweet homes, in exile run To lands that lie beneath another sun. The peasant, innocent of all these ills, With crooked ploughs the fertile fallows tills, And the round year with daily labour fills. From hence the country markets are supplied: Enough remains for household charge beside, His wife and tender children to sustain, And gratefully to feed his dumb deserving train. Nor cease his labours, till the yellow field A full return of bearded harvest yield— A crop so plenteous, as the land to load, O'ercome the crowded barns, and lodge on ricks abroad. Thus every several season is employed, Some spent in toil, and some in ease enjoyed. The yeaning ewes prevent the springing year: The laded boughs their fruits in autumn bear: 'Tis then the vine her liquid harvest yields, Baked in the sunshine of ascending fields. The winter comes; and then the falling mast For greedy swine provides a full repast: Then olives, ground in mills, their fatness boast, And winter fruits are mellowed by the frost. His cares are eased with intervals of bliss; His little children, climbing for a kiss, Welcome their father's late return at night; His faithful bed is crowned with chaste delight. His kine with swelling udders ready stand, And, lowing for the pail, invite the milker's hand. His wanton kids, with budding horns prepared, Fight harmless battles in his homely yard: Himself, in rustic pomp, on holidays, To rural powers a just oblation pays, And on the green his careless limbs displays. The hearth is in the midst; the herdsmen, round The cheerful fire, provoke his health in goblets crowned. He calls on Bacchus, and propounds the prize; The groom his fellow-groom at butts defies, And bends his bow, and levels with his eyes; Or, stript for wrestling, smears his limbs with oil, And watches, with a trip his foe to foil. Such was the life the frugal Sabines led; So Remus and his brother god were bred, From whom the austere Etrurian virtue rose; And this rude life our homely fathers chose. Old Rome from such a race derived her birth (The seat of empire, and the conquered earth), Which now on seven high hills triumphant reigns, And in that compass all the world contains. Ere Saturn's rebel son usurped the skies, When beasts were only slain for sacrifice, While peaceful Crete enjoyed her ancient lord, Ere sounding hammers forged the inhuman sword, Ere hollow drums were beat, before the breath Of brazen trumpets rung the peals of death, The good old god his hunger did assuage With roots and herbs, and gave the golden age. But, over-laboured with so long a course, 'Tis time to set at ease the smoking horse. BOOK III. ARGUMENT. This book begins with the invocation of some rural deities, and a compliment to Augustus; after which Virgil directs himself to Mæcenas, and enters on his subject. He lays down rules for the breeding and management of horses, oxen, sheep, goats, and dogs; and interweaves several pleasant descriptions of a chariot-race, of the battle of the bulls, of the force of love, and of the Scythian winter. In the latter part of the book, he relates the diseases incident to cattle; and ends with the description of a fatal murrain that formerly raged among the Alps. Thy fields, propitious Pales, I rehearse; And sing thy pastures in no vulgar verse, Amphrysian shepherd! the Lycæan woods, Arcadia's flowery plains, and pleasing floods. All other themes, that careless minds invite, Are worn with use, unworthy me to write. Busiris' altars, and the dire decrees Of hard Eurystheus, every reader sees: Hylas the boy, Latona's erring isle, And Pelops' ivory shoulder, and his toil For fair Hippodame, with all the rest Of Grecian tales, by poets are expressed. New ways I must attempt, my grovelling name To raise aloft, and wing my flight to fame. I, first of Romans, shall in triumph come From conquered Greece and bring her trophies home, With foreign spoils adorn my native place, And with Idume's palms my Mantua grace. Of Parian stone a temple will I raise, Where the slow Mincius through the valley strays, Where cooling streams invite the flocks to drink, And reeds defend the winding water's brink. Full in the midst shall mighty Cæsar stand, Hold the chief honours, and the dome command. Then I, conspicuous in my Tyrian gown (Submitting to his godhead my renown), A hundred coursers from the goal will drive: The rival chariots in the race shall strive. All Greece shall flock from far, my games to see; The whirlbat, and the rapid race, shall be Reserved for Cæsar, and ordained by me. Myself, with olive crowned, the gifts will bear. Even now methinks the public shouts I hear; The passing pageants, and the pomps appear. I to the temple will conduct the crew, The sacrifice and sacrificers view, From thence return, attended with my train, Where the proud theatres disclose the scene, Which interwoven Britons seem to raise, And show the triumph which their shame displays. High o'er the gate, in elephant and gold, The crowd shall Cæsar's Indian war behold: The Nile shall flow beneath; and, on the side, His shattered ships on brazen pillars ride. Next him Niphates, It has been objected to me, that I understood not this passage of Virgil, because I call Niphates a river, which is a mountain in Armenia. But the river arising from the same mountain is also called Niphates; and, having spoken of Nile before, I might reasonably think that Virgil rather meant to couple two rivers, than a river and a mountain. with inverted urn, And dropping sedge, shall his Armenia mourn; And Asian cities in our triumph borne. With backward bows the Parthian shall be there, And, spurring from the fight, confess their fear. A double wreath shall crown our Cæsar's brows— Two differing trophies, from two different foes. Europe with Afric in his fame shall join; But neither shore his conquest shall confine. The Parian marble there shall seem to move In breathing statues, not unworthy Jove, Resembling heroes, whose ethereal root Is Jove himself, and Cæsar is the fruit. Tros and his race the sculptor shall employ; And he—the god who built the walls of Troy. Envy herself at last, grown pale and dumb (By Cæsar combated and overcome), Shall give her hands, and fear the curling snakes Of lashing Furies, and the burning lakes; The pains of famished Tantalus shall feel, And Sisyphus, that labours up the hill The rolling rock in vain; and curst Ixion's wheel. Meantime we must pursue the sylvan lands (The abode of nymphs), untouched by former hands: For such, Mæcenas, are thy hard commands. Without thee, nothing lofty can I sing. Come then, and, with thyself, thy genius bring, With which inspired, I brook no dull delay: Cithæron loudly calls me to my way; Thy hounds, Täygetus, open, and pursue their prey. High Epidaurus urges on my speed, Famed for his hills, and for his horses' breed: From hills and dales the cheerful cries rebound; For Echo hunts along, and propagates the sound. A time will come, when my maturer Muse, In Cæsar's wars, a nobler theme shall choose, And through more ages bear my sovereign's praise, Than have from Tithon past to Cæsar's days. The generous youth, who, studious of the prize, The race of running coursers multiplies, Or to the plough the sturdy bullocks breeds, May know, that from the dam the worth of each proceeds. The mother cow must wear a lowering look, Sour-headed, strongly necked, to bear the yoke. Her double dew-lap from her chin descends, And at her thighs the ponderous burden ends. Long are her sides and large; her limbs are great; Rough are her ears, and broad her horny feet. Her colour shining black, but flecked with white; She tosses from the yoke; provokes the fight: She rises in her gait, is free from fears, And in her face a bull's resemblance bears: Her ample forehead with a star is crowned, And with her length of tail she sweeps the ground. The bull's insult at four she may sustain; But, after ten, from nuptial rites refrain. Six seasons use; but then release the cow, Unfit for love, and for the labouring plough. Now, while their youth is filled with kindly fire, Submit thy females to the lusty sire: Watch the quick motions of the frisking tail; Then serve their fury with the rushing male, Indulging pleasure, lest the breed should fail. In youth alone, unhappy mortals live; But, ah! the mighty bliss is fugitive: Discoloured sickness, anxious labours, come, And age, and death's inexorable doom. Yearly thy herds in vigour will impair. Recruit and mend them with thy yearly care: Still propagate; for still they fall away: 'Tis prudence to prevent the entire decay. Like diligence requires the courser's race, In early choice, and for a longer space. The colt, that for a stallion is designed, By sure presages shows his generous kind: Of able body, sound of limb and wind, Upright he walks, on pasterns firm and straight; His motions easy; prancing in his gait; The first to lead the way, to tempt the flood, To pass the bridge unknown, nor fear the trembling wood; Dauntless at empty noises; lofty necked; Sharp-headed, barrel-bellied, broadly backed; Brawny his chest, and deep; his colour gray; For beauty, dappled, or the brightest bay: Faint white and dun will scarce the rearing pay. The fiery courser, when he hears from far The sprightly trumpets, and the shouts of war, Pricks up his ears; and, trembling with delight, Shifts place, and paws, and hopes the promised fight. On his right shoulder his thick mane reclined, Ruffles at speed, and dances in the wind. His horny hoofs are jetty black and round; His chine is double; starting with a bound He turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground. Fire from his eyes clouds from his nostrils flow: He bears his rider headlong on the foe. Such was the steed in Grecian poets famed, Proud Cyllarus, by Spartan Pollux tamed: Such coursers bore to fight the god of Thrace; And such, Achilles, was thy warlike race. In such a shape, grim Saturn did restrain His heavenly limbs, and flowed with such a mane, When, half-surprised, and fearing to be seen, The lecher galloped from his jealous queen, Ran up the ridges of the rocks amain, And with shrill neighings filled the neighbouring plain. But, worn with years, when dire diseases come, Then hide his not ignoble age at home, In peace to enjoy his former palms and pains; And gratefully be kind to his remains. For, when his blood no youthful spirits move, He languishes and labours in his love; And, when the sprightly seed should swiftly come, Dribbling he drudges, and defrauds the womb. In vain he burns, like hasty stubble-fires. And in himself his former self requires. His age and courage weigh; nor those alone, But note his father's virtues and his own: Observe, if he disdains to yield the prize, Of loss impatient, proud of victories. Hast thou beheld, when from the goal they start, The youthful charioteers with beating heart Rush to the race; and, panting, scarcely bear The extremes of feverish hope and chilling fear; Stoop to the reins and lash with all their force? The flying chariot kindles in the course: And now alow, and now aloft, they fly, As borne through air, and seem to touch the sky. No stop, no stay: but clouds of sand arise, Spurned, and cast backward on the followers' eyes. The hindmost blows the foam upon the first: Such is the love of praise, an honourable thirst. Bold Erichthonius was the first who joined Four horses for the rapid race designed, And o'er the dusty wheels presiding sate: The Lapithæ, to chariots, add the state Of bits and bridles; taught the steed to bound, To run the ring, and trace the mazy round; To stop, to fly, the rules of war to know; To obey the rider, and to dare the foe. To choose a youthful steed with courage fired, To breed him, break him, back him, are required Experienced masters; and, in sundry ways, Their labours equal, and alike their praise. But, once again, the battered horse beware: The weak old stallion will deceive thy care, Though famous in his youth for force and speed, Or was of Argos or Epirian breed, Or did from Neptune's race, or from himself, proceed. These things premised, when now the nuptial time Approaches for the stately steed to climb, With food enable him to make his court; Distend his chine, and pamper him for sport: Feed him with herbs, whatever thou canst find, Of generous warmth, and of salacious kind: Then water him, and (drinking what he can) Encourage him to thirst again, with bran. Instructed thus, produce him to the fair, And join in wedlock to the longing mare. For, if the sire be faint, or out of case, He will be copied in his famished race, And sink beneath the pleasing task assigned (For all's too little for the craving kind). As for the females, with industrious care Take down their mettle; keep them lean and bare: When conscious of their past delight, and keen To take the leap, and prove the sport again, With scanty measure then supply their food; And, when athirst, restrain them from the flood; Their bodies harass; sink them when they run; And fry their melting marrow in the sun. Starve them, when barns beneath their burden groan, And winnowed chaff by western winds is blown; For fear the rankness of the swelling womb Should scant the passage, and confine the room; Lest the fat furrows should the sense destroy Of genial lust, and dull the seat of joy. But let them suck the seed with greedy force, And close involve the vigour of the horse. No more of coursers yet, we now proceed To teeming kine, and their laborious breed. The male has done: The transition is obscure in Virgil. He began with cows, then proceeds to treat of horses, now returns to cows. thy care must now proceed To teeming females, and the promised breed. First let them run at large, and never know The taming yoke, or draw the crooked plough. Let them not leap the ditch, or swim the flood, Or lumber o'er the meads, or cross the wood; But range the forest, by the silver side Of some cool stream, where Nature shall provide Green grass and fattening clover for their fare, And mossy caverns for their noontide lair, With rocks above, to shield the sharp nocturnal air. About the Alburnian groves, with holly green, Of winged insects mighty swarms are seen: This flying plague (to mark its quality) Œstros the Grecians call—Asylus, we— A fierce loud-buzzing breeze.—Their stings draw blood, And drive the cattle gadding through the wood. Seized with unusual pains, they loudly cry: Tanagrus hastens thence, and leaves his channel dry. This curse the jealous Juno did invent, And first employed for Iö's punishment. To shun this ill, the cunning leech ordains, In summer's sultry heats (for then it reigns) To feed the females ere the sun arise, Or late at night, when stars adorn the skies. When she has calved, then set the dam aside, And for the tender progeny provide. Distinguish all betimes with branding fire, To note the tribe, the lineage, and the sire; Whom to reserve for husband of the herd, Or who shall be to sacrifice preferred; Or whom thou shalt to turn thy glebe allow, To smooth the furrows, and sustain the plough: The rest, for whom no lot is yet decreed, May run in pastures, and at pleasure feed. The calf, by nature and by genius made To turn the glebe, breed to the rural trade. Set him betimes to school; and let him be Instructed there in rules of husbandry, While yet his youth is flexible and green, Nor bad examples of the world has seen. Early begin the stubborn child to break; For his soft neck, a supple collar make Of bending osiers; and (with time and care Inured that easy servitude to bear) Thy flattering method on the youth pursue: Joined with his school-fellows by two and two, Persuade them first to lead an empty wheel, That scarce the dust can raise, or they can feel: In length of time produce the labouring yoke, And shining shares, that make the furrows smoke. Ere the licentious youth be thus restrained, Or moral precepts on their minds have gained, Their wanton appetites not only feed With delicates of leaves, and marshy weed, But with thy sickle reap the rankest land, And minister the blade with bounteous hand: Nor be with harmful parsimony won To follow what our homely sires have done, Who filled the pail with beestings of the cow, But all her udder to the calf allow. If to the warlike steed thy studies bend, Or for the prize in chariots to contend, Near Pisa's flood the rapid wheels to guide, Or in Olympian groves aloft to ride, The generous labours of the courser, first, Must be with sight of arms and sounds of trumpets nursed; Inured the groaning axle-tree to bear, And let him clashing whips in stables hear. Soothe him with praise, and make him understand The loud applauses of his master's hand: This, from his weaning, let him well be taught; And then betimes in a soft snaffle wrought, Before his tender joints with nerves are knit, Untried in arms, and trembling at the bit. But, when to four full springs his years advance, Teach him to run the round, with pride to prance, And (rightly managed) equal time to beat, To turn, to bound in measure, and curvet. Let him to this, with easy pains, be brought, And seem to labour, when he labours not. Thus formed for speed, he challenges the wind, And leaves the Scythian arrow far behind: He scours along the field, with loosened reins, And treads so light, he scarcely prints the plains; Like Boreas in his race, when, rushing forth, He sweeps the skies, and clears the cloudy north: The waving harvest bends beneath his blast, The forest shakes, the groves their honours cast; He flies aloft, and with impetuous roar Pursues the foaming surges to the shore. Thus, o'er the Elean plains, thy well-breathed horse Sustains the goring spur, and wins the course, Or, bred to Belgian waggons, leads the way, Untired at night, and cheerful all the day. When once he's broken, feed him full and high; Indulge his growth, and his gaunt sides supply. Before his training, keep him poor and low; For his stout stomach with his food will grow: The pampered colt will discipline disdain, Impatient of the lash, and restiff to the rein. Wouldst thou their courage and their strength improve? Too soon they must not feel the stings of love. Whether the bull or courser be thy care, Let him not leap the cow, nor mount the mare. The youthful bull must wander in the wood Behind the mountain, or beyond the flood, Or in the stall at home his fodder find, Far from the charms of that alluring kind. With two fair eyes his mistress burns his breast: He looks, and languishes, and leaves his rest, Forsakes his food, and, pining for the lass, Is joyless of the grove, and spurns the growing grass. The soft seducer, with enticing looks, The bellowing rivals to the fight provokes. A beauteous heifer in the wood is bred: The stooping warriors, aiming head to head, Engage their clashing horns: with dreadful sound The forest rattles, and the rocks rebound. They fence, they push, and, pushing, loudly roar: Their dewlaps and their sides are bathed in gore. Nor, when the war is over, is it peace; Nor will the vanquished bull his claim release; But, feeding in his breast his ancient fires, And cursing fate, from his proud foe retires. Driven from his native land to foreign grounds, He with a generous rage resents his wounds, His ignominious flight, the victor's boast, And, more than both, the loves, which unrevenged he lost. Often he turns his eyes, and, with a groan, Surveys the pleasing kingdoms, once his own: And therefore to repair his strength he tries, Hardening his limbs with painful exercise, And rough upon the flinty rock he lies. On prickly leaves and on sharp herbs he feeds, Then to the prelude of a war proceeds. His horns, yet sore, he tries against a tree, And meditates his absent enemy. He snuffs the wind; his heels the sand excite; But, when he stands collected in his might, He roars, and promises a more successful fight. Then, to redeem his honour at a blow, He moves his camp, to meet his careless foe. Not more with madness, rolling from afar, The spumy waves proclaim the watery war, And mounting upwards, with a mighty roar, March onwards, and insult the rocky shore. They mate the middle region with their height, And fall no less than with a mountain's weight; The waters boil, and, belching, from below Black sands, as from a forceful engine, throw. Thus every creature, and of every kind, The secret joys of sweet coition find. Not only man's imperial race, but they That wing the liquid air, or swim the sea, Or haunt the desert, rush into the flame: For Love is lord of all, and is in all the same. 'Tis with this rage, the mother lion stung, Scours o'er the plain, regardless of her young: Demanding rites of love, she sternly stalks, And hunts her lover in his lonely walks. 'Tis then the shapeless bear his den forsakes; In woods and fields a wild destruction makes: Boars whet their tusks; to battle tigers move, Enraged with hunger, more enraged with love. Then woe to him, that, in the desert land Of Libya, travels o'er the burning sand! The stallion snuffs the well-known scent afar, And snorts and trembles for the distant mare; Nor bits nor bridles can his rage restrain, And rugged rocks are interposed in vain: He makes his way o'er mountains, and contemns Unruly torrents, and unforded streams. The bristled boar, who feels the pleasing wound, New grinds his arming tusks, and digs the ground. The sleepy lecher shuts his little eyes; About his churning chaps the frothy bubbles rise: He rubs his sides against a tree; prepares And hardens both his shoulders for the wars. What did the youth, when Love's unerring dart Transfixed his liver, and inflamed his heart? Alone, by night, his watery way he took; About him, and above, the billows broke; The sluices of the sky were open spread, And rolling thunder rattled o'er his head; The raging tempest called him back in vain And every boding omen of the main: Nor could his kindred, nor the kindly force Of weeping parents, change his fatal course; No, not the dying maid, who must deplore His floating carcase on the Sestian shore. I pass the wars that spotted lynxes make With their fierce rivals for the female's sake, The howling wolves', the mastiffs' amorous rage; When even the fearful stag dares for his hind engage. But, far above the rest, the furious mare, Barred from the male, is frantic with despair: For, when her pouting vent declares her pain, She tears the harness, and she rends the rein. For this (when Venus gave them rage and power) Their master's mangled members they devour, Of love defrauded in their longing hour. For love, they force through thickets of the wood, They climb the steepy hills, and stem the flood. When, at the spring's approach, their marrow burns (For with the spring their genial warmth returns), The mares to cliffs of rugged rocks repair, And with wide nostrils snuff the western air: When (wondrous to relate!) the parent wind, Without the stallion, propagates the kind. Then, fired with amorous rage, they take their flight Through plains, and mount the hills' unequal height; Nor to the north, nor to the rising sun, Nor southward to the rainy regions, run, But boring to the west, and hovering there, With gaping mouths, they draw prolific air; With which impregnate, from their groins they shed A slimy juice, by false conception bred. The shepherd knows it well, and calls by name Hippomanes, to note the mother's flame. This, gathered in the planetary hour, With noxious weeds, and spelled with words of power, Dire stepdames in the magic bowl infuse, And mix, for deadly draughts, the poisonous juice. But time is lost, which never will renew, While we too far the pleasing path pursue, Surveying nature with too nice a view. Let this suffice for herds: our following care Shall woolly flocks and shaggy goats declare. Nor can I doubt what oil I must bestow, To raise my subject from a ground so low; And the mean matter, which my theme affords, To embellish with magnificence of words. But the commanding Muse my chariot guides, Which o'er the dubious cliff securely rides; And pleased I am, no beaten road to take, But first the way to new discoveries make. Now, sacred Pales, in a lofty strain I sing the rural honours of thy reign. First, with assiduous care from winter keep, Well foddered in the stalls, thy tender sheep: Then spread with straw the bedding of thy fold, With fern beneath, to 'fend the bitter cold; That free from gouts thou mayst preserve thy care, And clear from scabs, produced by freezing air. Next, let thy goats officiously be nursed, And led to living streams, to quench their thirst. Feed them with winter-browse; and, for their lair, A cote, that opens to the south, prepare; Where basking in the sunshine they may lie, And the short remnants of his heat enjoy. This during winter's drizzly reign be done, Till the new Ram receives the exalted sun. Astrologers tell us that the sun receives his exaltation in the sign Aries: Virgil perfectly understood both astronomy and astrology. For hairy goats of equal profit are With woolly sheep, and ask an equal care. 'Tis true, the fleece, when drunk with Tyrian juice, Is dearly sold; but not for needful use: For the salacious goat increases more, And twice as largely yields her milky store. The still distended udders never fail, But, when they seem exhausted, swell the pail. Meantime the pastor shears their hoary beards, And eases of their hair the loaden herds. Their camlets, warm in tents, the soldier hold, And shield the shivering mariner from cold. On shrubs they browse, and, on the bleaky top Of rugged hills, the thorny bramble crop. Attended with their family they come At night, unasked, and mindful of their home; And scarce their swelling bags the threshold overcome. So much the more thy diligence bestow In depth of winter, to defend the snow, By how much less the tender helpless kind, For their own ills, can fit provision find. Then minister the browse with bounteous hand, And open let thy stacks all winter stand. But, when the western winds with vital power Call forth the tender grass and budding flower, Then, at the last, produce in open air Both flocks; and send them to their summer fare. Before the sun while Hesperus appears, First let them sip from herbs the pearly tears Of morning dews, and after break their fast On greensward ground—a cool and grateful taste. But, when the day's fourth hour has drawn the dews, And the sun's sultry heat their thirst renews; When creaking grasshoppers on shrubs complain, Then lead them to their watering-troughs again. In summer's heat, some bending valley find, Closed from the sun, but open to the wind; Or seek some ancient oak, whose arms extend In ample breadth, thy cattle to defend, Or solitary grove, or gloomy glade, To shield them with its venerable shade. Once more to watering lead; and feed again When the low sun is sinking to the main, When rising Cynthia sheds her silver dews, And the cool evening-breeze the meads renews, When linnets fill the woods with tuneful sound, And hollow shores the halcyon's voice rebound. Why should my Muse enlarge on Libyan swains, Their scattered cottages, and ample plains, Where oft the flocks without a leader stray, Or through continued deserts take their way, And, feeding, add the length of night to day? Whole months they wander, grazing as they go; Nor folds nor hospitable harbour know: Such an extent of plains, so vast a space Of wilds unknown, and of untasted grass, Allures their eyes: the shepherd last appears, And with him all his patrimony bears, His house and household gods, his trade of war, His bow and quiver, and his trusty cur. Thus, under heavy arms, the youth of Rome Their long laborious marches overcome, Cheerly their tedious travels undergo, And pitch their sudden camp before the foe. Not so the Scythian shepherd tends his fold, Nor he who bears in Thrace the bitter cold, Nor he who treads the bleak Mæotian strand, Or where proud Ister rolls his yellow sand. Early they stall their flocks and herds; for there No grass the fields, no leaves the forests, wear: The frozen earth lies buried there, below A hilly heap, seven cubits deep in snow; And all the west allies of stormy Boreas blow. The sun from far peeps with a sickly face, Too weak the clouds and mighty fogs to chase, When up the skies he shoots his rosy head, Or in the ruddy ocean seeks his bed. Swift rivers are with sudden ice constrained; And studded wheels are on its back sustained, A hostry now for waggons, which before Tall ships of burden on its bosom bore. The brazen caldrons with the frost are flawed; The garment, stiff with ice, at hearths is thawed; With axes first they cleave the wine; and thence, By weight, the solid portions they dispense. From locks uncombed, and from the frozen beard, Long icicles depend, and crackling sounds are heard. Meantime perpetual sleet, and driving snow, Obscure the skies, and hang on herds below. The starving cattle perish in their stalls; Huge oxen stand inclosed in wintry walls Of snow congealed; whole herds are buried there Of mighty stags, and scarce their horns appear. The dexterous huntsman wounds not these afar With shafts or darts, or makes a distant war With dogs, or pitches toils to stop their flight, But close engages in unequal fight; And, while they strive in vain to make their way Through hills of snow, and pitifully bray, Assaults with dint of sword, or pointed spears, And homeward, on his back, the joyful burden bears. The men to subterranean caves retire, Secure from cold, and crowd the cheerful fire: With trunks of elm and oaks the hearth they load, Nor tempt the inclemency of heaven abroad. Their jovial nights in frolics and in play They pass, to drive the tedious hours away, And their cold stomachs with crowned goblets cheer Of windy cider, and of barmy beer. Such are the cold Rhipæan race, and such The savage Scythian, and unwarlike Dutch, Where skins of beasts the rude barbarians wear, The spoils of foxes, and the furry bear. Is wool thy care? Let not thy cattle go Where bushes are, where burs and thistles grow; Nor in too rank a pasture let them feed; Then of the purest white select thy breed. Even though a snowy ram thou shalt behold, Prefer him not in haste for husband to thy fold: But search his mouth; and, if a swarthy tongue Is underneath his humid palate hung, Reject him, lest he darken all the flock, And substitute another from thy stock. 'Twas thus, with fleeces milky white (if we May trust report), Pan, god of Arcady, Did bribe thee, Cynthia; nor didst thou disdain, When called in woody shades, to cure a lover's pain. If milk be thy design, with plenteous hand Bring clover-grass; and from the marshy land Salt herbage for the foddering rack provide, To fill their bags, and swell the milky tide. These raise their thirst, and to the taste restore The savour of the salt, on which they fed before. Some, when the kids their dams too deeply drain, With gags and muzzles their soft mouths restrain, Their morning milk the peasants press at night; Their evening meal, before the rising light, To market bear; or sparingly they steep With seasoning salt, and stored for winter keep. Nor, last, forget thy faithful dogs; but feed With fattening whey the mastiffs' generous breed, And Spartan race, who, for the fold's relief, Will prosecute with cries the nightly thief, Repulse the prowling wolf, and hold at bay The mountain robbers rushing to the prey. With cries of hounds, thou mayst pursue the fear Of flying hares, and chase the fallow deer, Rouse from their desert dens the bristled rage Of boars, and beamy stags in toils engage. With smoke of burning cedars scent thy walls, And fume with stinking galbanum thy stalls, With that rank odour from thy dwelling-place To drive the viper's brood, and all the venomed race; For often, under stalls unmoved, they lie, Obscure in shades, and shunning heaven's broad eye: And snakes, familiar, to the hearth succeed, Disclose their eggs, and near the chimney breed— Whether to roofy houses they repair, Or sun themselves abroad in open air, In all abodes, of pestilential kind To sheep and oxen, and the painful hind. Take, shepherd, take a plant of stubborn oak, And labour him with many a sturdy stroke, Or with hard stones demolish from afar His haughty crest, the seat of all the war; Invade his hissing throat, and winding spires; Till, stretched in length, the unfolded foe retires. He drags his tail, and for his head provides, And in some secret cranny slowly glides; But leaves exposed to blows his back and battered sides. In fair Calabria's woods a snake is bred, With curling crest, and with advancing head: Waving he rolls, and makes a winding track; His belly spotted, burnished is his back. While springs are broken, while the southern air And dropping heavens the moistened earth repair, He lives on standing lakes and trembling bogs, And fills his maw with fish, or with loquacious frogs: But when, in muddy pools, the water sinks, And the chapt earth is furrowed o'er with chinks, He leaves the fens, and leaps upon the ground, And, hissing, rolls his glaring eyes around. With thirst inflamed, impatient of the heats, He rages in the fields, and wide destruction threats. Oh! let not sleep my closing eyes invade In open plains, or in the secret shade, When he, renewed in all the speckled pride Of pompous youth, has cast his slough aside, And in his summer livery rolls along, Erect, and brandishing his forky tongue, Leaving his nest, and his imperfect young, And thoughtless of his eggs, forgets to rear The hopes of poison for the following year. The causes and the signs shall next be told, Of every sickness that infects the fold. A scabby tetter on their pelts will stick, When the raw rain has pierced them to the quick, Or searching frosts have eaten through the skin, Or burning icicles are lodged within; Or, when the fleece is shorn, if sweat remains Unwashed, and soaks into their empty veins; When their defenceless limbs the brambles tear, Short of their wool, and naked from the shear. Good shepherds, after shearing, drench their sheep: And their flock's father (forced from high to leap) Swims down the stream, and plunges in the deep. They oint their naked limbs with mothered oil; Or, from the founts where living sulphurs boil, They mix a med'cine to foment their limbs, With scum that on the molten silver swims; Fat pitch, and black bitumen, add to these, Besides the waxen labour of the bees, And hellebore, and squills deep-rooted in the seas. Receipts abound; but, searching all thy store, The best is still at hand, to launch the sore, And cut the head; for, till the core be found, The secret vice is fed, and gathers ground, While, making fruitless moan, the shepherd stands, And, when the launching-knife requires his hands, Vain help, with idle prayers, from heaven demands. Deep in their bones when fevers fix their seat, And rack their limbs, and lick the vital heat, The ready cure to cool the raging pain Is underneath the foot to breathe a vein. This remedy the Scythian shepherds found: The inhabitants of Thracia's hilly ground, And Gelons, use it, when for drink and food They mix their cruddled milk with horses' blood. But, where thou seest a single sheep remain In shades aloof, or couched upon the plain, Or listlessly to crop the tender grass, Or late to lag behind with truant pace; Revenge the crime, and take the traitor's head, Ere in the faultless flock the dire contagion spread. On winter seas we fewer storms behold, Than foul diseases that infect the fold. Nor do those ills on single bodies prey, But oftener bring the nation to decay, And sweep the present stock and future hope away. A dire example of this truth appears, When, after such a length of rolling years, We see the naked Alps, and thin remains Of scattered cots, and yet unpeopled plains, Once filled with grazing flocks, the shepherds' happy reigns. Here, from the vicious air and sickly skies, A plague did on the dumb creation rise: During the autumnal heats the infection grew, Tame cattle and the beasts of nature slew, Poisoning the standing lakes, and pools impure; Nor was the foodful grass in fields secure. Strange death! for, when the thirsty fire had drunk Their vital blood, and the dry nerves were shrunk, When the contracted limbs were cramped, even then A waterish humour swelled and oozed again, Converting into bane the kindly juice, Ordained by nature for a better use. The victim ox, that was for altars prest, Trimmed with white ribbons, and with garlands drest, Sunk of himself, without the god's command, Preventing the slow sacrificer's hand. Or, by the holy butcher if he fell, The inspected entrails could no fates foretell; Nor, laid on altars, did pure flames arise; But clouds of smouldering smoke forbade the sacrifice. Scarcely the knife was reddened with his gore, Or the black poison stained the sandy floor. The thriven calves in meads their food forsake, And render their sweet souls before the plenteous rack. The fawning dog runs mad; the wheezing swine With coughs is choked, and labours from the chine: The victor horse, forgetful of his food, The palm renounces, and abhors the flood. He paws the ground; and on his hanging ears A doubtful sweat in clammy drops appears: Parched is his hide, and rugged are his hairs. Such are the symptoms of the young disease; But, in time's process, when his pains increase, He rolls his mournful eyes; he deeply groans With patient sobbing, and with manly moans. He heaves for breath; which, from his lungs supplied, And fetched from far, distends his labouring side. To his rough palate his dry tongue succeeds; And ropy gore he from his nostrils bleeds. A drench of wine has with success been used, And through a horn the generous juice infused, Which, timely taken, oped his closing jaws, But, if too late, the patient's death did cause: For the too vigorous dose too fiercely wrought, And added fury to the strength it brought. Recruited into rage, he grinds his teeth In his own flesh, and feeds approaching death. Ye gods, to better fate good men dispose, And turn that impious error on our foes! The steer, who to the yoke was bred to bow (Studious of tillage, and the crooked plough), Falls down and dies; and, dying, spews a flood Of foamy madness, mixed with clotted blood. The clown, who, cursing Providence, repines, His mournful fellow from the team disjoins; With many a groan forsakes his fruitless care, And in the unfinished furrow leaves the share. The pining steer, no shades of lofty woods, Nor flowery meads, can ease, nor crystal floods Rolled from the rock: his flabby flanks decrease; His eyes are settled in a stupid peace; His bulk too weighty for his thighs is grown, And his unwieldy neck hangs drooping down. Now what avails his well-deserving toil To turn the glebe, or smooth the rugged soil? And yet he never supped in solemn state (Nor undigested feasts did urge his fate), Nor day to night luxuriously did join, Nor surfeited on rich Campanian wine. Simple his beverage, homely was his food, The wholesome herbage, and the running flood: No dreadful dreams awaked him with affright; His pains by day secured his rest by night. 'Twas then that buffaloes, ill paired, were seen To draw the car of Jove's imperial queen, For want of oxen; and the labouring swain Scratched, with a rake, a furrow for his grain, And covered with his hand the shallow seed again. He yokes himself, and up the hilly height, With his own shoulders, draws the waggon's weight. The nightly wolf, that round the inclosure prowled To leap the fence, now plots not on the fold, Tamed with a sharper pain. The fearful doe, And flying stag, amidst the greyhounds go, And round the dwellings roam of man, their fiercer foe. The scaly nations of the sea profound, Like shipwrecked carcases, are driven aground, And mighty phocæ, never seen before In shallow streams, are stranded on the shore. The viper dead within her hole is found: Defenceless was the shelter of the ground. The water-snake, whom fish and paddocks fed, With staring scales lies poisoned in his bed: To birds their native heavens contagious prove; From clouds they fall, and leave their souls above. Besides, to change their pasture 'tis in vain, Or trust to physic; physic is their bane. The learned leeches in despair depart, And shake their heads, desponding of their art. Tisiphone, let loose from under ground, Majestically pale, now treads the round, Before her drives diseases and affright, And every moment rises to the sight, Aspiring to the skies, encroaching on the light. The rivers, and their banks, and hills around, With lowings and with dying bleats resound. At length, she strikes an universal blow; To death at once whole herds of cattle go; Sheep, oxen, horses, fall; and, heaped on high, The differing species in confusion lie, 'Till, warned by frequent ills, the way they found To lodge their loathsome carrion under ground: For useless to the currier were their hides; Nor could their tainted flesh with ocean tides Be freed from filth; nor could Vulcanian flame The stench abolish, or the savour tame. Nor safely could they shear their fleecy store (Made drunk with poisonous juice, and stiff with gore), Or touch the web: but, if the vest they wear, Red blisters rising on their paps appear, And flaming carbuncles, and noisome sweat, And clammy dews, that loathsome lice beget; Till the slow-creeping evil eats his way, Consumes the parching limbs, and makes the life his prey. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. Virgil has taken care to raise the subject of each Georgic. In the first, he has only dead matter on which to work. In the second, he just steps on the world of life, and describes that degree of it which is to be found in vegetables. In the third, he advances to animals: and, in the last, he singles out the Bee, which may be reckoned the most sagacious of them, for his subject. In this Georgic he shows us what station is most proper for the bees, and when they begin to gather honey; how to call them home when they swarm; and how to part them when they are engaged in battle. From hence he takes occasion to discover their different kinds; and, after an excursion, relates their prudent and politic administration of affairs, and the several diseases that often rage in their hives, with the proper symptoms and remedies of each disease. In the last place, he lays down a method of repairing their kind, supposing their whole breed lost; and gives at large the history of its invention. The gifts of heaven my following song pursues, Aërial honey, and ambrosial dews. Mæcenas, read this other part, that sings Embattled squadrons, and adventurous kings— A mighty pomp, though made of little things. Their arms, their arts, their manners, I disclose, And how they war, and whence the people rose. Slight is the subject, but the praise not small, If heaven assist, and Phœbus hear my call. First, for thy bees a quiet station find, And lodge them under covert of the wind (For winds, when homeward they return, will drive The loaded carriers from their evening hive), Far from the cows' and goats' insulting crew, That trample down the flowers, and brush the dew. The painted lizard, and the birds of prey, Foes of the frugal kind, be far away— The titmouse, and the pecker's hungry brood, And Procne, with her bosom stained in blood: These rob the trading citizens, and bear The trembling captives through the liquid air, And for their callow young a cruel feast prepare. But near a living stream their mansion place, Edged round with moss, and tufts of matted grass: And plant (the winds' impetuous rage to stop) Wild olive-trees, or palms, before the busy shop; That, when the youthful prince, My most ingenious friend, Sir Henry Shere, has observed, through a glass-hive, that the young prince of the bees, or heir-presumptive of the crown, approaches the king's apartment with great reverence; and, for three successive mornings, demands permission to lead forth a colony of that year's bees. If his petition be granted (which he seems to make by humble hummings), the swarm arises under his conduct. If the answer be, le roi s'avisera—that is, if the old monarch think it not convenient for the public good to part with so many of his subjects,—the next morning the prince is found dead before the threshold of the palace. with proud alarm, Calls out the venturous colony to swarm— When first their way through yielding air they wing, New to the pleasures of their native spring— The banks of brooks may make a cool retreat For the raw soldiers from the scalding heat, And neighbouring trees with friendly shade invite The troops, unused to long laborious flight. Then o'er the running stream, or standing lake, A passage for thy weary people make; With osier floats the standing water strow; Of massy stones make bridges, if it flow; That basking in the sun thy bees may lie, And, resting there, their flaggy pinions dry, When, late returning home, the laden host By raging winds is wrecked upon the coast. Wild thyme and savory set around their cell, Sweet to the taste, and fragrant to the smell: Set rows of rosemary with flowering stem, And let the purple violets drink the stream. Whether thou build the palace of thy bees With twisted osiers, or with barks of trees, Make but a narrow mouth: for, as the cold Congeals into a lump the liquid gold, So 'tis again dissolved by summer's heat, And the sweet labours both extremes defeat. And therefore, not in vain, the industrious kind With dauby wax and flowers the chinks have lined, And, with their stores of gathered glue, contrive To stop the vents and crannies of their hive. Not birdlime, or Idæan pitch, produce A more tenacious mass of clammy juice. Nor bees are lodged in hives alone, but found In chambers of their own beneath the ground; Their vaulted roofs are hung in pumices, And in the rotten trunks of hollow trees. But plaster thou the chinky hives with clay, And leafy branches o'er their lodgings lay: Nor place them where too deep a water flows, Or where the yew, their poisonous neighbour, grows; Nor roast red crabs, to offend the niceness of their nose; Nor near the steaming stench of muddy ground; Nor hollow rocks that render back the sound, And doubled images of voice rebound. For what remains, when golden suns appear, And under earth have driven the winter year, The winged nation wanders through the skies, And o'er the plains and shady forest flies; Then, stooping on the meads and leafy bowers, They skim the floods, and sip the purple flowers. Exalted hence, and drunk with secret joy, Their young succession all their cares employ: They breed, they brood, instruct and educate, And make provision for the future state; They work their waxen lodgings in their hives, And labour honey to sustain their lives. But when thou seest a swarming cloud arise, That sweeps aloft, and darkens all the skies, The motions of their hasty flight attend; And know, to floods or woods, their airy march they bend. Then melfoil beat, and honey-suckles pound; With these alluring savours strew the ground; And mix with tinkling brass the cymbal's droning sound. Straight to their ancient cells, recalled from air, The reconciled deserters will repair. But, if intestine broils alarm the hive (For two pretenders oft for empire strive), The vulgar in divided factions jar; And murmuring sounds proclaim the civil war. Inflamed with ire, and trembling with disdain, Scarce can their limbs their mighty souls contain. With shouts, the coward's courage they excite, And martial clangours call them out to fight; With hoarse alarms the hollow camp rebounds, That imitate the trumpet's angry sounds; Then to their common standard they repair; The nimble horsemen scour the fields of air; In form of battle drawn, they issue forth, And every knight is proud to prove his worth. Prest for their country's honour, and their king's, On their sharp beaks they whet their pointed stings, And exercise their arms, and tremble with their wings. Full in the midst the haughty monarchs ride; The trusty guards come up, and close the side; With shouts the daring foe to battle is defied. Thus, in the season of unclouded spring, To war they follow their undaunted king, Crowd through their gates, and, in the fields of light, The shocking squadrons meet in mortal fight. Headlong they fall from high, and, wounded, wound, And heaps of slaughtered soldiers bite the ground. Hard hailstones lie not thicker on the plain, Nor shaken oaks such showers of acorns rain. With gorgeous wings, the marks of sovereign sway, The two contending princes make their way; Intrepid through the midst of danger go, Their friends encourage and amaze the foe. With mighty souls in narrow bodies prest, They challenge, and encounter breast to breast; So fixed on fame, unknowing how to fly, And obstinately bent to win or die, That long the doubtful combat they maintain, Till one prevails—for one can only reign. Yet all these dreadful deeds, this deadly fray, A cast of scattered dust will soon allay, And undecided leave the fortune of the day. When both the chiefs are sundered from the fight, Then to the lawful king restore his right; And let the wasteful prodigal be slain, That he, who best deserves, alone may reign. With ease distinguished is the regal race: One monarch wears an honest open face; Large are his limbs, and godlike to behold, His royal body shines with specks of gold, And ruddy scales; for empire he designed, Is better born, and of a nobler kind. That other looks like nature in disgrace: Gaunt are his sides, and sullen is his face; And like their grisly prince appear his gloomy race, Grim, ghastly, rugged, like a thirsty train That long have travelled through a desert plain, And spit from their dry chaps the gathered dust again. The better brood, unlike the bastard crew, Are marked with royal streaks of shining hue; Glittering and ardent, though in body less: From these, at pointed seasons, hope to press Huge heavy honeycombs, of golden juice, Not only sweet, but pure, and fit for use, To allay the strength and hardness of the wine, And with old Bacchus new metheglin join. But, when their swarms are eager of their play, And loathe their empty hives, and idly stray, Restrain the wanton fugitives, and take A timely care to bring the truants back. The task is easy—but to clip the wings Of their high-flying arbitrary kings. At their command, the people swarm away; Confine the tyrant, and the slave will stay. Sweet gardens, full of saffron flowers, invite The wandering gluttons, and retard their flight— Besides the god obscene, who frights away, With his lath sword, the thieves and birds of prey— With his own hand, the guardian of the bees, For slips of pines may search the mountain trees, And with wild thyme and savory plant the plain, Till his hard horny fingers ache with pain; And deck with fruitful trees the fields around, And with refreshing waters drench the ground. Now, did I not so near my labours end, Strike sail, and hastening to the harbour tend, My song to flowery gardens might extend— To teach the vegetable arts, to sing The Pæstan roses, and their double spring; How succory drinks the running streams, and how Green beds of parsley near the river grow; How cucumbers along the surface creep With crooked bodies, and with bellies deep— The late narcissus, and the winding trail Of bear's-foot, myrtles green, and ivy pale: For, where with stately towers Tarentum stands, And deep Galæsus soaks the yellow sands, I chanced an old Corycian swain to know, Lord of few acres, and those barren too, Unfit for sheep or vines, and more unfit to sow; Yet, labouring well his little spot of ground, Some scattering pot-herbs here and there he found, Which, cultivated with his daily care, And bruised with vervain, were his frugal fare. Sometimes white lilies did their leaves afford, With wholesome poppy-flowers, to mend his homely board; For, late returning home, he supped at ease, And wisely deemed the wealth of monarchs less; The little of his own, because his own, did please. To quit his care, he gathered, first of all, In spring the roses, apples in the fall; And, when cold winter split the rocks in twain, And ice the running rivers did restrain, He stripped the bear's-foot of its leafy growth, And, calling western wind, accused the Spring of sloth. He therefore first among the swains was found To reap the product of his laboured ground, And squeeze the combs with golden liquor crowned. His limes were first in flowers; his lofty pines, With friendly shade, secured his tender vines. For every bloom his trees in spring afford, An autumn apple was by tale restored. He knew to rank his elms in even rows, For fruit the grafted pear-tree to dispose, And tame to plums the sourness of the sloes. With spreading planes he made a cool retreat, To shade good fellows from the summer's heat. But, straitened in my space, I must forsake This task, for others afterwards to take. Describe we next the nature of the bees, Bestowed by Jove for secret services, When, by the tinkling sound of timbrels led, The king of heaven in Cretan caves they fed. Of all the race of animals, alone The bees have common cities of their own, And common sons; beneath one law they live, And with one common stock their traffic drive. Each has a certain home, a several stall; All is the state's, the state provides for all. Mindful of coming cold, they share the pain, And hoard, for winter's use, the summer's gain. Some o'er the public magazines preside, And some are sent new forage to provide; These drudge in fields abroad, and those at home Lay deep foundations for the laboured comb, With dew, narcissus-leaves, and clammy gum. To pitch the waxen flooring some contrive; Some nurse the future nation of the hive; Sweet honey some condense; some purge the grout; The rest, in cells apart, the liquid nectar shut: All, with united force, combine to drive The lazy drones from the laborious hive: With envy stung, they view each other's deeds; With diligence the fragrant work proceeds. As, when the Cyclops, at the almighty nod, New thunder hasten for their angry god, Subdued in fire the stubborn metal lies; One brawny smith the puffing bellows plies, And draws and blows reciprocating air: Others to quench the hissing mass prepare; With lifted arms they order every blow, And chime their sounding hammers in a row; With laboured anvils Ætna groans below. Strongly they strike; huge flakes of flames expire; With tongs they turn the steel, and vex it in the fire. If little things with great we may compare, Such are the bees, and such their busy care; Studious of honey, each in his degree, The youthful swain, the grave experienced bee— That in the field; this, in affairs of state Employed at home, abides within the gate, To fortify the combs, to build the wall, To prop the ruins, lest the fabric fall: But, late at night, with weary pinions come The labouring youth, and heavy laden, home. Plains, meads, and orchards, all the day he plies; The gleans of yellow thyme distend his thighs: He spoils the saffron flowers; he sips the blues Of violets, wilding blooms, and willow dews. Their toil is common, common is their sleep; They shake their wings when morn begins to peep, Rush through the city-gates without delay, Nor ends their work, but with declining day. Then, having spent the last remains of light, They give their bodies due repose at night, When hollow murmurs of their evening bells Dismiss the sleepy swains, and toll them to their cells. When once in beds their weary limbs they steep, No buzzing sounds disturb their golden sleep: 'Tis sacred silence all. Nor dare they stray, When rain is promised, or a stormy day; But near the city walls their watering take, Nor forage far, but short excursions make. And as, when empty barks on billows float, With sandy ballast sailors trim the boat; So bees bear gravel-stones, whose poising weight Steers through the whistling winds their steady flight. But (what's more strange) their modest appetites, Averse from Venus, fly the nuptial rites. No lust enervates their heroic mind, Nor wastes their strength on wanton woman-kind; But in their mouths reside their genial powers: They gather children from the leaves and flowers. Thus make they kings to fill the regal seat, And thus their little citizens create, And waxen cities build, the palaces of state. And oft on rocks their tender wings they tear, And sink beneath the burdens which they bear: Such rage of honey in their bosom beats, And such a zeal they have for flowery sweets. Thus though the race of life they quickly run, Which in the space of seven short years is done, The immortal line in sure succession reigns; The fortune of the family remains, And grandsires' grandsires the long list contains. Besides, not Egypt, India, Media, more, With servile awe, their idol king adore: While he survives, in concord and content The commons live, by no divisions rent; But the great monarch's death dissolves the government. All goes to ruin; they themselves contrive To rob the honey, and subvert the hive. The king presides, his subjects' toil surveys, The servile rout their careful Cæsar praise: Him they extol; they worship him alone; They crowd his levees, and support his throne: They raise him on their shoulders with a shout; And, when their sovereign's quarrel calls them out, His foes to mortal combat they defy, And think it honour at his feet to die. Induced by such examples, some have taught, That bees have portions of ethereal thought— Endued with particles of heavenly fires; For God the whole created mass inspires. Through heaven, and earth, and ocean's depth, He throws His influence round, and kindles as He goes. Hence flocks, and herds, and men, and beasts, and fowls, With breath are quickened, and attract their souls; Hence take the forms His prescience did ordain, And into Him at length resolve again. No room is left for death: they mount the sky, And to their own congenial planets fly. Now, when thou hast decreed to seize their stores, And by prerogative to break their doors, With sprinkled water first the city choke, And then pursue the citizens with smoke. Two honey-harvests fall in every year: First, when the pleasing Pleiades appear, And, springing upward, spurn the briny seas: Again, when their affrighted choir surveys The watery Scorpion mend his pace behind, With a black train of storms, and winter wind, They plunge into the deep, and safe protection find. Prone to revenge, the bees, a wrathful race, When once provoked, assault the aggressor's face, And through the purple veins a passage find; There fix their stings, and leave their souls behind. But, if a pinching winter thou foresee, And wouldst preserve thy famished family; With fragrant thyme the city fumigate, And break the waxen walls to save the state. For lurking lizards often lodge, by stealth, Within the suburbs, and purloin their wealth; And worms, that shun the light, a dark retreat Have found in combs, and undermined the seat; Or lazy drones, without their share of pain, In winter-quarters free, devour the gain; Or wasps infest the camp with loud alarms, And mix in battle with unequal arms; Or secret moths are there in silence fed; Or spiders in the vault their snary webs have spread. The more oppressed by foes, or famine-pined, The more increase thy care to save the sinking kind: With greens and flowers recruit their empty hives, And seek fresh forage to sustain their lives. But, since they share with man one common fate, In health and sickness, and in turns of state,— Observe the symptoms. When they fall away, And languish with insensible decay, They change their hue; with haggard eyes they stare; Lean are their looks, and shagged is their hair: And crowds of dead, that never must return To their loved hives, in decent pomp are borne: Their friends attend the hearse; the next relations mourn. The sick, for air, before the portal gasp, Their feeble legs within each other clasp, Or idle in their empty hives remain, Benumbed with cold, and listless of their gain. Soft whispers then, and broken sounds, are heard, As when the woods by gentle winds are stirred; Such stifled noise as the close furnace hides, Or dying murmurs of departing tides. This when thou seest, galbanean odours use, And honey in the sickly hive infuse. Through reeden pipes convey the golden flood, To invite the people to their wonted food. Mix it with thickened juice of sodden wines, And raisins from the grapes of Psythian vines: To these add pounded galls, and roses dry, And, with Cecropian thyme, strong-scented centaury. A flower there is, that grows in meadow-ground, Amellus called, and easy to be found; For, from one root, the rising stem bestows A wood of leaves, and violet-purple boughs: The flower itself is glorious to behold, And shines on altars like refulgent gold— Sharp to the taste—by shepherds near the stream Of Mella found; and thence they gave the name. Boil this restoring root in generous wine, And set beside the door, the sickly stock to dine. But, if the labouring kind be wholly lost, And not to be retrieved with care or cost; 'Tis time to touch the precepts of an art, The Arcadian master did of old impart; And how he stocked his empty hives again, Renewed with putrid gore of oxen slain. An ancient legend I prepare to sing, And upward follow Fame's immortal spring:— For, where with seven-fold horns mysterious Nile Surrounds the skirts of Egypt's fruitful isle, And where in pomp the sun-burnt people ride, On painted barges, o'er the teeming tide, Which, pouring down from Ethiopian lands, Makes green the soil with slime, and black prolific sands— That length of region, and large tract of ground, In this one art a sure relief have found. First, in a place by nature close, they build A narrow flooring, guttered, walled, and tiled. In this, four windows are contrived, that strike, To the four winds opposed, their beams oblique. A steer of two years old they take, whose head Now first with burnished horns begins to spread: They stop his nostrils, while he strives in vain To breathe free air, and struggles with his pain. Knocked down, he dies: his bowels, bruised within, Betray no wound on his unbroken skin. Extended thus, in this obscene abode They leave the beast; but first sweet flowers are strowed Beneath his body, broken boughs and thyme, And pleasing cassia just renewed in prime. This must be done, ere spring makes equal day, When western winds on curling waters play; Ere painted meads produce their flowery crops, Or swallows twitter on the chimney-tops. The tainted blood, in this close prison pent, Begins to boil, and through the bones ferment. Then (wondrous to behold) new creatures rise, A moving mass at first, and short of thighs; 'Till, shooting out with legs, and imped with wings, The grubs proceed to bees with pointed stings; And, more and more affecting air, they try Their tender pinions, and begin to fly: At length, like summer storms from spreading clouds, That burst at once, and pour impetuous floods— Or flights of arrows from the Parthian bows, When from afar they gall embattled foes— With such a tempest through the skies they steer, And such a form the winged squadrons bear. What god, O Muse! this useful science taught? Or by what man's experience was it brought? Sad Aristæus from fair Tempe fled— His bees with famine or diseases dead:— On Peneus' banks he stood, and near his holy head; And, while his falling tears the streams supplied, Thus, mourning, to his mother goddess cried:— “Mother Cyrene! mother, whose abode Is in the depth of this immortal flood! What boots it, that from Phœbus' loins I spring, The third, by him and thee, from heaven's high king? O! where is all thy boasted pity gone, And promise of the skies to thy deluded son? Why didst thou me, unhappy me, create, Odious to gods, and born to bitter fate? Whom scarce my sheep, and scarce my painful plough, The needful aids of human life allow: So wretched is thy son, so hard a mother thou! Proceed, inhuman parent, in thy scorn; Root up my trees; with blights destroy my corn; My vineyards ruin, and my sheepfolds burn. Let loose thy rage; let all thy spite be shown, Since thus thy hate pursues the praises of thy son.” But, from her mossy bower below the ground, His careful mother heard the plaintive sound— Encompassed with her sea-green sisters round. The poet here records the names of fifteen river-nymphs; and for once I have translated them all; but in the Æneïs I thought not myself obliged to be so exact; for, in naming many men, who were killed by heroes, I have omitted some which would not sound in English verse. One common work they plied; their distaffs full With carded locks of blue Milesian wool. Spio, with Drymo brown, and Xantho fair, And sweet Phyllodoce with long dishevelled hair; Cydippe with Lycorias, one a maid, And one that once had called Lucina's aid; Clio and Beroë, from one father both; Both girt with gold, and clad in party-coloured cloth; Opis the meek, and Deiopeia proud; Nisæa lofty, with Ligea loud; Thalia joyous, Ephyre the sad, And Arethusa, once Diana's maid, But now (her quiver left) to love betrayed. To these Clymene the sweet theft declares Of Mars; and Vulcan's unavailing cares; And all the rapes of gods, and every love, From ancient Chaos down to youthful Jove. Thus while she sings, the sisters turn the wheel, Empty the woolly rock, and fill the reel. A mournful sound again the mother hears; Again the mournful sound invades the sisters' ears. Starting at once from their green seats, they rise— Fear in their heart, amazement in their eyes. But Arethusa, leaping from her bed, First lifts above the waves her beauteous head, And, crying from afar, thus to Cyrene said:— “O sister, not with causeless fear possest! No stranger voice disturbs thy tender breast. 'Tis Aristæus, 'tis thy darling son, Who to his careless mother makes his moan. Near his paternal stream he sadly stands, With downcast eyes, wet cheeks, and folded hands, Upbraiding heaven from whence his lineage came, And cruel calls the gods, and cruel thee, by name.” Cyrene, moved with love, and seized with fear, Cries out,—“Conduct my son, conduct him here: 'Tis lawful for the youth, derived from gods, To view the secrets of our deep abodes.” At once she waved her hand on either side; At once the ranks of swelling streams divide. Two rising heaps of liquid crystal stand, And leave a space betwixt of empty sand. Thus safe received, the downward track he treads, Which to his mother's watery palace leads. With wondering eyes he views the secret store Of lakes, that, pent in hollow caverns, roar; He hears the crackling sounds of coral woods, And sees the secret source of subterranean floods; And where, distinguished in their several cells, The fount of Phasis, and of Lycus, dwells; Where swift Enipeus in his bed appears, And Tiber his majestic forehead rears; Whence Anio flows, and Hypanis profound Breaks through the opposing rocks with raging sound; Where Po first issues from his dark abodes, And, awful in his cradle, rules the floods: Two golden horns on his large front he wears, And his grim face a bull's resemblance bears; With rapid course he seeks the sacred main, And fattens, as he runs, the fruitful plain. Now, to the court arrived, the admiring son Beholds the vaulted roofs of pory stone, Now to his mother goddess tells his grief, Which she with pity hears, and promises relief. The officious nymphs, attending in a ring, With waters drawn from their perpetual spring, From earthly dregs his body purify, And rub his temples, with fine towels, dry; Then load the tables with a liberal feast, And honour with full bowls their friendly guest. The sacred altars are involved in smoke; And the bright choir their kindred gods invoke. Two bowls the mother fills with Lydian wine; Then thus: “Let these be poured, with rites divine, To the great authors of our watery line— To father Ocean, this; and this,” she said, “Be to the nymphs his sacred sisters paid, Who rule the watery plains, and hold the woodland shade.” She sprinkled thrice, with wine, the Vestal fire; Thrice to the vaulted roof the flames aspire. Raised with so blest an omen, she begun, With words, like these, to cheer her drooping son:— “In the Carpathian bottom, makes abode The shepherd of the seas, a prophet and a god. High o'er the main in watery pomp he rides, His azure car and finny coursers guides— Proteus his name.—To his Pallenian port I see from far the weary god resort. Him not alone we river gods adore, But aged Nereus hearkens to his lore. With sure foresight, and with unerring doom, He sees what is, and was, and is to come. This Neptune gave him, when he gave to keep His scaly flocks, that graze the watery deep. Implore his aid; for Proteus only knows The secret cause, and cure, of all thy woes. But first the wily wizard must be caught; For, unconstrained, he nothing tells for nought; Nor is with prayers, or bribes, or flattery bought. Surprise him first, and with hard fetters bind; Then all his frauds will vanish into wind. I will myself conduct thee on thy way: When next the southing sun inflames the day, When the dry herbage thirsts for dews in vain, And sheep, in shades, avoid the parching plain; Then will I lead thee to his secret seat, When, weary with his toil, and scorched with heat, The wayward sire frequents his cool retreat. His eyes with heavy slumber overcast— With force invade his limbs, and bind him fast. Thus surely bound, yet be not over bold: The slippery god will try to loose his hold, And various forms assume, to cheat thy sight, And with vain images of beasts affright; With foamy tusks he seems a bristly boar, Or imitates the lion's angry roar; Breaks out in crackling flames to shun thy snares, A dragon hisses, or a tiger stares; Or, with a wile thy caution to betray, In fleeting streams attempts to slide away. But thou, the more he varies forms, beware To strain his fetters with a stricter care. Till, tiring all his arts, he turns again To his true shape, in which he first was seen.” This said, with nectar she her son anoints, Infusing vigour through his mortal joints: Down from his head the liquid odours ran; He breathed of heaven, and looked above a man. Within a mountain's hollow womb, there lies A large recess, concealed from human eyes, Where heaps of billows, driven by wind and tide, In form of war, their watery ranks divide, And there, like sentries set, without the mouth abide: A station safe for ships, when tempests roar, A silent harbour, and a covered shore. Secure within resides the various god, And draws a rock upon his dark abode. Hither with silent steps, secure from sight, The goddess guides her son, and turns him from the light: Herself, involved in clouds, precipitates her flight. 'Twas noon; the sultry Dog-star from the sky Scorched Indian swains; the rivelled grass was dry; The sun with flaming arrows pierced the flood, And, darting to the bottom, baked the mud; When weary Proteus, from the briny waves, Retired for shelter to his wonted caves. His finny flocks about their shepherd play, And, rolling round him, spurt the bitter sea. Unwieldily they wallow first in ooze, Then in the shady covert seek repose. Himself, their herdsman, on the middle mount, Takes of his mustered flocks a just account. So, seated on a rock, a shepherd's groom Surveys his evening flocks returning home, When lowing calves and bleating lambs, from far, Provoke the prowling wolf to nightly war. The occasion offers, and the youth complies: For scarce the weary god had closed his eyes, When, rushing on with shouts, he binds in chains The drowsy prophet, and his limbs constrains. He, not unmindful of his usual art, First in dissembled fire attempts to part: Then roaring beasts, and running streams, he tries, And wearies all his miracles of lies; But, having shifted every form to 'scape, Convinced of conquest, he resumed his shape, And thus, at length, in human accent spoke:— “Audacious youth! what madness could provoke A mortal man to invade a sleeping god? What business brought thee to my dark abode?” To this the audacious youth:—“Thou know'st full well My name and business, god; nor need I tell. No man can Proteus cheat: but, Proteus, leave Thy fraudful arts, and do not thou deceive. Following the gods' command, I come to implore Thy help, my perished people to restore.” The seer, who could not yet his wrath assuage, Rolled his green eyes, that sparkled with his rage And gnashed his teeth, and cried,—“No vulgar god Pursues thy crimes, nor with a common rod. Thy great misdeeds have met a due reward; And Orpheus' dying prayers at length are heard. The episode of Orpheus and Eurydice begins here, and contains the only machine which Virgil uses in the Georgics. I have observed, in the epistle before the Æneïs, that our author seldom employs machines but to adorn his poem, and that the action which they seemingly perform is really produced without them. Of this nature is the legend of the bees restored by miracle; when the receipt, which the poet gives, would do the work without one. The only beautiful machine which I remember in the modern poets, is in Ariosto, where God commands St. Michael to take care that Paris, then besieged by the Saracens, should be succoured by Rinaldo. In order to this, he enjoins the archangel to find Silence and Discord; the first to conduct the Christian army to relieve the town, with so much secrecy that their march should not be discovered; the latter to enter the camp of the infidels, and there to sow dissension among the principal commanders. The heavenly messenger takes his way to an ancient monastery, not doubting there to find Silence in her primitive abode; but, instead of Silence, finds Discord: the monks, being divided into factions about the choice of some new officer, were at snic and snee with their drawn knives. The satire needs no explanation. And here it may be also observed that ambition, jealousy, and worldly interest, and point of honour, had made variance both in the cloister and the camp; and strict discipline had done the work of Silence, in conducting the Christian army to surprise the Turks. For crimes, not his, the lover lost his life, And at thy hands requires his murdered wife: Nor (if the Fates assist not) canst thou 'scape The just revenge of that intended rape. To shun thy lawless lust, the dying bride, Unwary, took along the river's side, Nor at her heels perceived the deadly snake, That kept the bank, in covert of the brake. But all her fellow-nymphs the mountains tear With loud laments, and break the yielding air: The realms of Mars remurmur all around, And echoes to the Athenian shores rebound. The unhappy husband, husband now no more, Did on his tuneful harp his loss deplore, And sought his mournful mind with music to restore. On thee, dear wife, in deserts all alone, He called, sighed, sung: his griefs with day begun, Nor were they finished with the setting sun. Even to the dark dominions of the night He took his way, through forests void of light, And dared amidst the trembling ghosts to sing, And stood before the inexorable king. The infernal troops like passing shadows glide, And, listening, crowd the sweet musician's side— Not flocks of birds, when driven by storms or night, Stretch to the forest with so thick a flight— Men, matrons, children, and the unmarried maid, The mighty hero's more majestic shade, This whole line is taken from the Marquis of Normanby's translation. And youths, on funeral piles before their parents laid. All these Cocytus bounds with squalid reeds, With muddy ditches, and with deadly weeds; And baleful Styx encompasses around, With nine slow circling streams, the unhappy ground. Even from the depths of hell the damned advance; The infernal mansions, nodding, seem to dance; The gaping three-mouthed dog forgets to snarl; The Furies hearken, and their snakes uncurl; Ixion seems no more his pain to feel, But leans attentive on his standing wheel. All dangers past, at length the lovely bride In safety goes, with her melodious guide, Longing the common light again to share, And draw the vital breath of upper air— He first; and close behind him followed she; For such was Proserpine's severe decree— When strong desires the impatient youth invade, By little caution and much love betrayed: A fault, which easy pardon might receive, Were lovers judges, or could hell forgive: For, near the confines of ethereal light, And longing for the glimmering of a sight, The unwary lover cast his eyes behind, Forgetful of the law, nor master of his mind. Straight all his hopes exhaled in empty smoke, And his long toils were forfeit for a look. Three flashes of blue lightning gave the sign Of covenants broke; three peals of thunder join. Then thus the bride:—‘What fury seized on thee, Unhappy man! to lose thyself and me? Dragged back again by cruel destinies, An iron slumber shuts my swimming eyes. And now, farewell! Involved in shades of night, For ever I am ravished from thy sight. In vain I reach my feeble hands, to join In sweet embraces—ah! no longer thine!’ She said; and from his eyes the fleeting fair Retired like subtile smoke dissolved in air, And left her hopeless lover in despair. In vain, with folding arms, the youth essayed To stop her flight, and strain the flying shade: He prays, he raves, all means in vain he tries, With rage inflamed, astonished with surprise; But she returned no more, to bless his longing eyes. Nor would the infernal ferryman once more Be bribed to waft him to the further shore. What should he do, who twice had lost his love? What notes invent? what new petitions move? Her soul already was consigned to Fate, And shivering in the leaky sculler sate. For seven continued months, if Fame say true, The wretched swain his sorrows did renew: By Strymon's freezing streams he sate alone: The rocks were moved to pity with his moan; Trees bent their heads to hear him sing his wrongs: Fierce tigers couched around, and lolled their fawning tongues. So, close in poplar shades, her children gone, The mother nightingale laments alone, Whose nest some prying churl had found, and thence, By stealth, conveyed the unfeathered innocence. But she supplies the night with mournful strains; And melancholy music fills the plains. Sad Orpheus thus his tedious hours employs, Averse from Venus, and from nuptial joys. Alone he tempts the frozen floods, alone The unhappy climes, where spring was never known: He mourned his wretched wife, in vain restored, And Pluto's unavailing boon deplored. The Thracian matrons—who the youth accused Of love disdained, and marriage rites refused— With furies and nocturnal orgies fired, At length against his sacred life conspired. Whom even the savage beasts had spared, they killed, And strewed his mangled limbs about the field. Then, when his head, from his fair shoulders torn, Washed by the waters, was on Hebrus borne, Even then his trembling tongue invoked his bride; With his last voice, ‘Eurydice,’ he cried. ‘Eurydice,’ the rocks and river-banks replied.” This answer Proteus gave; nor more he said, But in the billows plunged his hoary head; And, where he leaped, the waves in circles widely spread. The nymph returned, her drooping son to cheer, And bade him banish his superfluous fear: “For now,” said she, “the cause is known, from whence Thy woe succeeded, and for what offence. The nymphs, companions of the unhappy maid, This punishment upon thy crimes have laid; And sent a plague among thy thriving bees.— With vows and suppliant prayers their powers appease: The soft Napæan race will soon repent Their anger, and remit the punishment. The secret in an easy method lies; Select four brawny bulls for sacrifice, Which on Lycæus graze without a guide; Add four fair heifers yet in yoke untried. For these, four altars in their temple rear, And then adore the woodland powers with prayer. From the slain victims pour the streaming blood, And leave their bodies in the shady wood: Nine mornings thence, Lethæan poppy bring, To appease the manes of the poet's king: And, to propitiate his offended bride, A fatted calf and a black ewe provide: This finished, to the former woods repair.” His mother's precepts he performs with care; The temple visits, and adores with prayer; Four altars raises; from his herd he culls, For slaughter, four the fairest of his bulls: Four heifers from his female store he took, All fair, and all unknowing of the yoke. Nine mornings thence, with sacrifice and prayers, The powers atoned, he to the grove repairs. Behold a prodigy! for, from within The broken bowels, and the bloated skin, A buzzing noise of bees his ears alarms: Straight issue through the sides assembling swarms. Dark as a cloud, they make a wheeling flight, Then on a neighbouring tree, descending, light: Like a large cluster of black grapes they show, And make a large dependence from the bough. Thus have I sung of fields, and flocks, and trees, And of the waxen work of labouring bees; While mighty Cæsar, thundering from afar, Seeks on Euphrates' banks the spoils of war; With conquering arts asserts his country's cause, With arts of peace the willing people draws; On the glad earth the golden age renews, And his great father's path to heaven pursues; While I at Naples pass my peaceful days, Affecting studies of less noisy praise; And, bold through youth, beneath the beechen shade, The lays of shepherds, and their loves, have played. ÆNEÏS TO THE MOST HONOURABLE JOHN, LORD MARQUIS OF NORMANBY, EARL OF MULGRAVE, &amp;c. AND KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER. BOOK I. ARGUMENT. The Trojans, after a seven years' voyage, set sail for Italy, but are overtaken by a dreadful storm, which Æolus raises at Juno's request. The tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest. Neptune drives off the Winds, and calms the sea. Æneas, with his own ship, and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus complains to Jupiter of her son's misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the Carthaginians. Æneas, going out to discover the country, meets his mother, in the shape of a huntress, who conveys him in a cloud to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido, by a device of Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some discourse with him, desires the history of his adventures since the siege of Troy, which is the subject of the two following Books. Arms, and the man I sing, who, forced by Fate, And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate, Expelled and exiled, left the Trojan shore. Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore, And in the doubtful war, before he won The Latian realm, and built the destined town; His banished gods restored to rites divine, And settled sure succession in his line, From whence the race of Alban fathers come, And the long glories of majestic Rome. O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate; What goddess was provoked, and whence her hate; For what offence the queen of heaven began To persecute so brave, so just a man; Involved his anxious life in endless cares, Exposed to wants, and hurried into wars! Can heavenly minds such high resentment show, Or exercise their spite in human woe? Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away, An ancient town was seated on the sea, A Tyrian colony; the people made Stout for the war, and studious of their trade: Carthage the name; beloved by Juno more Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore. Here stood her chariot; here, if heaven were kind, The seat of awful empire she designed. Yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly, (Long cited by the people of the sky), That times to come should see the Trojan race Her Carthage ruin, and her towers deface; Nor thus confined, the yoke of sovereign sway Should on the necks of all the nations lay. She pondered this, and feared it was in fate; Nor could forget the war she waged of late, For conquering Greece against the Trojan state. Besides, long causes working in her mind, And secret seeds of envy, lay behind: Deep graven in her heart, the doom remained Of partial Paris, and her form disdained; The grace bestowed on ravished Ganymed, Electra's glories, and her injured bed. Each was a cause alone; and all combined To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind. For this, far distant from the Latian coast, She drove the remnants of the Trojan host: And seven long years the unhappy wandering train Were tossed by storms, and scattered through the main. Such time, such toil, required the Roman name, Such length of labour for so vast a frame. Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars, Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores, Entering with cheerful shouts the watery reign, And ploughing frothy furrows in the main; When, labouring still with endless discontent, The queen of heaven did thus her fury vent: “Then am I vanquished? must I yield?” said she: “And must the Trojans reign in Italy? So Fate will have it; and Jove adds his force; Nor can my power divert their happy course. Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen, The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men? She, for the fault of one offending foe, The bolts of Jove himself presumed to throw: With whirlwinds from beneath she tossed the ship, And bare exposed the bosom of the deep: Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game, The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame, She strongly seized, and with a burning wound Transfixed, and, naked, on a rock she bound. But I, who walk in awful state above, The majesty of heaven, the sister wife of Jove, For length of years my fruitless force employ Against the thin remains of ruined Troy! What nations now to Juno's power will pray, Or offerings on my slighted altars lay?” Thus raged the goddess; and, with fury fraught, The restless regions of the storms she sought, Where, in a spacious cave of living stone, The tyrant Æolus, from his airy throne, With power imperial curbs the struggling winds, And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds. This way, and that, the impatient captives tend, And, pressing for release, the mountains rend. High in his hall the undaunted monarch stands, And shakes his sceptre, and their rage commands; Which did he not, their unresisted sway Would sweep the world before them in their way; Earth, air, and seas, through empty space would roll, And heaven would fly before the driving soul. In fear of this, the Father of the Gods Confined their fury to those dark abodes, And locked them safe within, oppressed with mountain loads; Imposed a king, with arbitrary sway, To loose their fetters, or their force allay; To whom the suppliant queen her prayers addressed, And thus the tenor of her suit expressed:— “O Æolus! for to thee the king of heaven The power of tempests and of winds has given; Thy force alone their fury can restrain, And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main— A race of wandering slaves, abhorred by me, With prosperous passage cut the Tuscan sea: To fruitful Italy their course they steer, And, for their vanquished gods, design new temples there. Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies; Sink or disperse my fatal enemies. Twice seven, the charming daughters of the main, Around my person wait, and bear my train: Succeed my wish, and second my design, The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine, And make thee father of a happy line.” This was an obliging promise to Æolus, who had been so unhappy in his former children, Macareus and Canace. To this the god:—“'Tis yours, O queen! to will The work, which duty binds me to fulfil. These airy kingdoms, and this wide command, Are all the presents of your bounteous hand: Yours is my sovereign's grace; and, as your guest, I sit with gods at their celestial feast. Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue; Dispose of empire, which I hold from you.” He said, and hurled against the mountain-side His quivering spear, and all the god applied. The raging winds rush through the hollow wound, And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground; Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep, Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep. South, East, and West, with mixed confusion roar, And roll the foaming billows to the shore. The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries Ascend; and sable night involves the skies; And heaven itself is ravished from their eyes. Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue; Then flashing fires the transient light renew; The face of things a frightful image bears; And present death in various forms appears. Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief, With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief; And “Thrice and four times happy those,” he cried, “That under Ilian walls, before their parents, died! Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train! Why could not I by that strong arm be slain, And lie by noble Hector on the plain, Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields, Where Simoïs rolls the bodies and the shields Of heroes, whose dismembered hands yet bear The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!” Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails, Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails, And rent the sheets: the raging billows rise, And mount the tossing vessel to the skies: Nor can the shivering oars sustain the blow; The galley gives her side, and turns her prow; While those astern, descending down the steep, Through gaping waves behold the boiling deep. Three ships were hurried by the Southern blast, And on the secret shelves with fury cast. Those hidden rocks the Ausonian sailors knew: They called them Altars, when they rose in view, And showed their spacious backs above the flood. Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood, Dashed on the shallows of the moving sand, And in mid ocean left them moored a-land. Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew, (A horrid sight!) even in the hero's view, From stem to stern by waves was overborne: The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn, Was headlong hurled: thrice round the ship was tossed, Then bulged at once, and in the deep was lost; And here and there above the waves were seen Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men. The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way, And sucked, through loosened planks, the rushing sea. Ilioneus was her chief: Aletes old, Achates faithful, Abas young and bold, Endured not less: their ships, with gaping seams, Admit the deluge of the briny streams. Mean time imperial Neptune heard the sound Of raging billows breaking on the ground. Displeased, and fearing for his watery reign, He reared his awful head above the main, Serene in majesty; then rolled his eyes Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies. He saw the Trojan fleet dispersed, distressed, By stormy winds and wintry heaven oppressed. Full well the god his sister's envy knew, And what her aims and what her arts pursue. He summoned Eurus and the Western blast, And first an angry glance on both he cast, Then thus rebuked—“Audacious winds! from whence This bold attempt, this rebel insolence? Is it for you to ravage seas and land, Unauthorised by my supreme command? To raise such mountains on the troubled main? Whom I—but first 'tis fit the billows to restrain; And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign. Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear— The realms of ocean and the fields of air Are mine, not his. Poetically speaking, the fields of air are under the command of Juno, and her vicegerent Æolus. Why then does Neptune call them his? I answer, Because, being god of the seas, Æolus could raise no tempest in the atmosphere above them without his leave. But why does Juno address to her own substitute? I answer, He had an immediate power over the winds, whom Juno desires to employ on her revenge. That power was absolute by land; which Virgil plainly insinuates: for, when Boreas and his brethren were let loose, he says at first, terras turbine perflant—then adds, Incubuere mari. To raise a tempest on the sea was usurpation on the prerogative of Neptune, who had given him no leave, and therefore was enraged at his attempt. I may also add, that they who are in a passion, as Neptune then was, are apt to assume to themselves more than is properly their due. By fatal lot to me The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea. His power to hollow caverns is confined: There let him reign, the jailor of the wind, With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call, And boast and bluster in his empty hall.” He spoke—and, while he spoke, he smoothed the sea, Dispelled the darkness, and restored the day. Cymothoë, Triton, and the sea-green train Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main, Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands: The god himself with ready trident stands, And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands; Then heaves them off the shoals.—Where'er he guides His finny coursers, and in triumph rides, The waves unruffle, and the sea subsides. As, when in tumults rise the ignoble crowd, Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud; And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly, And all the rustic arms that fury can supply: If then some grave and pious man appear, They hush their noise, and lend a listening ear: He soothes with sober words their angry mood, And quenches their innate desire of blood: So, when the father of the flood appears, And o'er the seas his sovereign trident rears, Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains, High on his chariot, and, with loosened reins, Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains. The weary Trojans ply their shattered oars To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores. Within a long recess there lies a bay: An island shades it from the rolling sea, And forms a port secure for ships to ride: Broke by the jutting land, on either side, In double streams the briny waters glide, Betwixt two rows of rocks: a sylvan scene Appears above, and groves for ever green: A grot is formed beneath, with mossy seats, To rest the Nereïds, and exclude the heats. Down through the crannies of the living walls, The crystal streams descend in murmuring falls. No hawsers need to bind the vessels here, Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear. Seven ships within this happy harbour meet, The thin remainders of the scattered fleet. The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes, Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wished repose. First, good Achates, with repeated strokes Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes: Short flame succeeds: a bed of withered leaves The dying sparkles in their fall receives: Caught into life, in smoking fumes they rise, And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies. The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground. Some dry their corn, infected with the brine, Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine. Æneas climbs the mountain's airy brow, And takes a prospect of the seas below, If Capys thence, or Antheus, he could spy, Or see the streamers of Caïcus fly. No vessels were in view: but, on the plain, Three beamy stags command a lordly train Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along. He stood; and, while secure they fed below, He took the quiver and the trusty bow Achates used to bear: the leaders first He laid along, and then the vulgar pierced: Nor ceased his arrows, till the shady plain Seven mighty bodies with their blood distain. For the seven ships he made an equal share, And to the port returned, triumphant from the war. The jars of generous wine (Acestes' gift, When his Trinacrian shores the navy left) He set abroach, and for the feast prepared, In equal portions with the venison shared. Thus, while he dealt it round, the pious chief, With cheerful words, allayed the common grief:— “Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose, To future good, our past and present woes. With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried; The inhuman Cyclops, and his den defied. What greater ills hereafter can you bear? Resume your courage, and dismiss your care. An hour will come, with pleasure to relate Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate. Through various hazards and events, we move To Latium, and the realms foredoomed by Jove. Called to the seat (the promise of the skies) Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise, Endure the hardships of your present state; Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate.” These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart; His outward smiles concealed his inward smart. The jolly crew, unmindful of the past, The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste. Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil; The limbs, yet trembling, in the cauldrons boil; Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil. Stretched on the grassy turf, at ease they dine, Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with wine. Their hunger thus appeased, their care attends The doubtful fortune of their absent friends: Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess, Whether to deem them dead, or in distress. Above the rest, Æneas mourns the fate Of brave Orontes, and the uncertain state Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus.— The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus; When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas: At length on Libyan realms he fixed his eyes— Whom, pondering thus on human miseries, When Venus saw, she with a lowly look, Not free from tears, her heavenly sire bespoke:— “O king of gods and men! whose awful hand Disperses thunder on the seas and land; Disposes all with absolute command; How could my pious son thy power incense? Or what, alas! is vanished Troy's offence? Our hope of Italy not only lost, On various seas by various tempests tossed, But shut from every shore, and barred from every coast. You promised once, a progeny divine, Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line, In after-times should hold the world in awe, And to the land and ocean give the law. How is your doom reversed, which eased my care When Troy was ruined in that cruel war? Then fates to fates I could oppose: but now, When Fortune still pursues her former blow, What can I hope? What worse can still succeed? What end of labours has your will decreed? Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts, Could pass secure, and pierce the Illyrian coasts, Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves, And through nine channels disembogues his waves. At length he founded Padua's happy seat, And gave his Trojans a secure retreat; There fixed their arms, and there renewed their name, And there in quiet rules, and crowned with fame. But we, descended from your sacred line, Entitled to your heaven and rites divine, Are banished earth, and, for the wrath of one, Removed from Latium, and the promised throne. Are these our sceptres? these our due rewards? And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?” To whom the Father of the immortal race, Smiling with that serene indulgent face, With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies, First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies:— “Daughter, dismiss thy fears: to thy desire, The fates of thine are fixed, and stand entire. Thou shalt behold thy wished Lavinian walls; And, ripe for heaven, when fate Æneas calls, Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me: No councils have reversed my firm decree. And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state, Know, I have searched the mystic rolls of Fate: Thy son (nor is the appointed season far) In Italy shall wage successful war, Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field, And sovereign laws impose, and cities build, Till, after every foe subdued, the sun Thrice through the signs his annual race shall run: This is his time prefixed. Ascanius then, Now called Iülus, shall begin his reign. He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear, Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer, And, with hard labour, Alba-longa build. The throne with his succession shall be filled, Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen, Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes, Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose. The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain: Then Romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain, Of martial towers the founder shall become, The people Romans call, the city Rome. To them no bounds of empire I assign, Nor term of years to their immortal line. Even haughty Juno, who, with endless broils, Earth, seas, and heaven, and Jove himself, turmoils, At length atoned, her friendly power shall join, To cherish and advance the Trojan line. The subject world shall Rome's dominion own, And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown. An age is ripening in revolving fate, When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state, And sweet revenge her conquering sons shall call, To crush the people that conspired her fall. Then Cæsar from the Julian stock shall rise, Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies, Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils, Our heaven, the just reward of human toils, Securely shall repay with rites divine; And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine. Then dire debate, and impious war, shall cease, And the stern age be softened into peace: Then banished Faith shall once again return, And Vestal fires in hallowed temples burn; And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain. Janus himself before his fane shall wait, And keep the dreadful issues of his gate, With bolts and iron bars: within remains Imprisoned Fury, bound in brazen chains: High on a trophy raised, of useless arms, He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms.” He said, and sent Cyllenius with command To free the ports, and ope the Punic land To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate, The queen might force them from her town and state. Down from the steep of heaven Cyllenius flies, And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies. Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god, Performs his message, and displays his rod. The surly murmurs of the people cease; And, as the Fates required, they give the peace. The queen herself suspends the rigid laws, The Trojans pities, and protects their cause. Mean time, in shades of night Æneas lies: Care seized his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes. But, when the sun restored the cheerful day, He rose, the coast and country to survey, Anxious and eager to discover more.— It looked a wild uncultivated shore: But, whether humankind, or beasts alone, Possessed the new-found region, was unknown. Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides: Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides: The bending brow above a safe retreat provides. Armed with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends, And true Achates on his steps attends. Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood, Before his eyes his goddess mother stood— A huntress in her habit and her mien: Her dress a maid, her air confessed a queen. Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind; Loose was her hair, and wantoned in the wind; Her hand sustained a bow; her quiver hung behind. She seemed a virgin of the Spartan blood: With such array Harpalyce bestrode Her Thracian courser, and outstripped the rapid flood. “Ho! strangers! have you lately seen,” she said, “One of my sisters, like myself arrayed, Who crossed the lawn, or in the forest strayed? A painted quiver at her back she bore; Varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore; And at full cry pursued the tusky boar.” Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:— “None of your sisters have we heard or seen, O virgin! or what other name you bear Above that style:—O more than mortal fair! Your voice and mien celestial birth betray! If, as you seem, the sister of the day, Or one at least of chaste Diana's train, Thus in the original— O quam te memorem, virgo ? An Phœbi soror, an nympharum sanguinis una? This is a family compliment, which Æneas here bestows on Venus. His father Anchises had used the very same to that goddess when he courted her. This appears by that very ancient Greek poem, “The Hymn on Venus.” in which that amour is so beautifully described, and which is thought Homer's, though it seems to be written before his age. Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain; But tell a stranger, long in tempests tossed, What earth we tread, and who commands the coast? Then on your name shall wretched mortals call, And offered victims at your altars fall.”— “I dare not,” she replied, “assume the name Of goddess, or celestial honours claim: For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear, And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear. Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are— A people rude in peace, and rough in war. The rising city, which from far you see, Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony. Phœnician Dido rules the growing state, Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate. Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; Which I will sum in short. Sichæus, known For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne, Possessed fair Dido's bed; and either heart At once was wounded with an equal dart. Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid; Pygmalion then the Tyrian sceptre swayed— One who contemned divine and human laws. Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth, With steel invades his brother's life by stealth; Before the sacred altar made him bleed, And long from her concealed the cruel deed. Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coined, To soothe his sister, and delude her mind. At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares, And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. The cruel altars, and his fate, he tells, And the dire secret of his house reveals, Then warns the widow, with her household gods, To seek a refuge in remote abodes. Last, to support her in so long a way, He shows her where his hidden treasure lay. Admonished thus, and seized with mortal fright, The queen provides companions of her flight: They meet, and all combine to leave the state, Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate. They seize a fleet, which ready rigged they find; Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind. The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea With prosperous winds; a woman leads the way. I know not, if by stress of weather driven, Or was their fatal course disposed by heaven; At last they landed, where from far your eyes May view the turrets of new Carthage rise; There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa called, From the bull's hide) they first inclosed, and walled. But whence are you? what country claims your birth? What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?” To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes, And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:— “Could you with patience hear, or I relate, O nymph! the tedious annals of our fate, Through such a train of woes if I should run, The day would sooner than the tale be done. From ancient Troy, by force expelled, we came— If you by chance have heard the Trojan name. On various seas by various tempests tossed, At length we landed on your Libyan coast. The good Æneas am I called—a name, While Fortune favoured, not unknown to fame. My household gods, companions of my woes, With pious care I rescued from our foes. To fruitful Italy my course was bent; And from the king of heaven is my descent. With twice ten sail I crossed the Phrygian sea; Fate and my mother goddess led my way. Scarce seven, the thin remainders of my fleet, From storms preserved, within your harbour meet. Myself distressed, an exile, and unknown, Debarred from Europe, and from Asia thrown, In Libyan deserts wander thus alone.” His tender parent could no longer bear, But, interposing, sought to soothe his care. “Whoe'er you are—not unbeloved by heaven, Since on our friendly shore your ships are driven— Have courage: to the gods permit the rest, And to the queen expose your just request. Now take this earnest of success, for more: Your scattered fleet is joined upon the shore; The winds are changed, your friends from danger free; Or I renounce my skill in augury. Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move, And stoop with closing pinions from above; Whom late the bird of Jove had driven along, And through the clouds pursued the scattering throng: Now, all united in a goodly team, They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream. As they, with joy returning, clap their wings, And ride the circuit of the skies in rings; Not otherwise your ships, and every friend, Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend. No more advice is needful; but pursue The path before you, and the town in view.” Thus having said, she turned, and made appear Her neck refulgent, and dishevelled hair, Which, flowing from her shoulders, reached the ground, And widely spread ambrosial scents around. In length of train descends her sweeping gown; And, by her graceful walk, the queen of love is known. The prince pursued the parting deity With words like these:—“Ah! whither do you fly? Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son In borrowed shapes, and his embrace to shun; Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown; And still to speak in accents not your own.” Against the goddess these complaints he made, But took the path, and her commands obeyed. They march obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds, With mists, their persons, and involves in clouds, That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay, Or force to tell the causes of their way. This part performed, the goddess flies sublime, To visit Paphos, and her native clime; Where garlands, ever green and ever fair, With vows are offered, and with solemn prayer: A hundred altars in her temple smoke; A thousand bleeding hearts her power invoke. They climb the next ascent, and, looking down, Now at a nearer distance view the town. The prince with wonder sees the stately towers, (Which late were huts, and shepherds' homely bowers, The gates and streets; and hears, from every part, The noise and busy concourse of the mart. The toiling Tyrians on each other call, To ply their labour: some extend the wall; Some build the citadel; the brawny throng Or dig, or push unwieldy stones along. Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground, Which, first designed, with ditches they surround. Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice Of holy senates, and elect by voice. Here some design a mole, while others there Lay deep foundations for a theatre, From marble quarries mighty columns hew, For ornaments of scenes, and future view. Such is their toil, and such their busy pains, As exercise the bees in flowery plains, When winter past, and summer scarce begun, Invites them forth to labour in the sun; Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense; Some at the gate stand ready to receive The golden burden, and their friends relieve; All, with united force, combine to drive The lazy drones from the laborious hive. With envy stung, they view each other's deeds; The fragrant work with diligence proceeds. “Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!” Æneas said, and viewed, with lifted eyes, Their lofty towers: then entering at the gate, Concealed in clouds (prodigious to relate), He mixed, unmarked, among the busy throng, Borne by the tide, and passed unseen along. Full in the centre of the town there stood, Thick set with trees, a venerable wood: The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground, And digging here, a prosperous omen found: From under earth a courser's head they drew, Their growth and future fortune to foreshew: This fated sign their foundress Juno gave, Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave. Sidonian Dido here with solemn state Did Juno's temple build, and consecrate, Enriched with gifts, and with a golden shrine; But more the goddess made the place divine. On brazen steps the marble threshold rose, And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose: The rafters are with brazen coverings crowned; The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound. What first Æneas in this place beheld, Revived his courage, and his fear expelled. For—while, expecting there the queen, he raised His wondering eyes, and round the temple gazed, Admired the fortune of the rising town, The striving artists, and their art's renown— He saw, in order painted on the wall, Whatever did unhappy Troy befall— The wars that fame around the world had blown, All to the life, and every leader known. There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies, And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies. He stopped, and weeping said,—“O friend! even here The monuments of Trojan woes appear! Our known disasters fill even foreign lands: See there, where old unhappy Priam stands! Even the mute walls relate the warrior's fame, And Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim.” He said (his tears a ready passage find), Devouring what he saw so well designed, And with an empty picture fed his mind: For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield, And here the trembling Trojans quit the field, Pursued by fierce Achilles through the plain, On his high chariot driving o'er the slain. The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew, By their white sails betrayed to nightly view; And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword The sentries slew, nor spared their slumbering lord, Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood. Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied Achilles, and unequal combat tried; Then, where the boy disarmed, with loosened reins, Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains, Hung by the neck and hair; and, dragged around, The hostile spear yet sticking in his wound, With tracks of blood inscribed the dusty ground. Meantime the Trojan dames, oppressed with woe, To Pallas' fane in long procession go, In hopes to reconcile their heavenly foe. They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair, And rich embroidered vests for presents bear; But the stern goddess stands unmoved with prayer. Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew. Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold, The lifeless body of his son is sold. So sad an object, and so well expressed, Drew sighs and groans from the grieved hero's breast, To see the figure of his lifeless friend, And his old sire his helpless hands extend. Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train, Mixed in the bloody battle on the plain; And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew, His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew. Penthesilea there, with haughty grace, Leads to the wars an Amazonian race: In their right hands a pointed dart they wield; The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield. Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws, Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes, And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose. Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes, Fixed on the walls with wonder and surprise, The beauteous Dido, with a numerous train, And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane. Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height, Diana seems; and so she charms the sight, When in the dance the graceful goddess leads The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads. Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien, She walks majestic, and she looks their queen: Latona sees her shine above the rest, And feeds with secret joy her silent breast. Such Dido was; with such becoming state, Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great. Their labour to her future sway she speeds, And passing with a gracious glance proceeds, Then mounts the throne, high placed before the shrine; In crowds around, the swarming people join. She takes petitions, and dispenses laws, Hears and determines every private cause: Their tasks in equal portions she divides, And, where unequal, there by lot decides. Another way by chance Æneas bends His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends, Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong, And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng, Whom late the tempest on the billows tossed, And widely scattered on another coast. The prince, unseen, surprised with wonder stands, And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands: But, doubtful of the wished event, he stays, And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys, Impatient till they told their present state, And where they left their ships, and what their fate, And why they came, and what was their request; For these were sent commissioned by the rest, To sue for leave to land their sickly men, And gain admission to the gracious queen. Entering, with cries they filled the holy fane; Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:— “O queen! indulged by favour of the gods To found an empire in these new abodes, To build a town, with statutes to restrain The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign— We wretched Trojans, tossed on every shore, From sea to sea, thy clemency implore. Forbid the fires our shipping to deface! Receive the unhappy fugitives to grace, And spare the remnant of a pious race! We come not with design of wasteful prey, To drive the country, force the swains away: Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire; The vanquished dare not to such thoughts aspire. A land there is, Hesperia named of old— The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold— The Œnotrians held it once—by common fame, Now called Italia, from the leader's name. To that sweet region was our voyage bent, When winds, and every warring element, Disturbed our course, and, far from sight of land, Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand: The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar, Dispersed and dashed the rest upon the rocky shore. Those few you see escaped the storm, and fear, Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here. What men, what monsters, what inhuman race, What laws, what barbarous customs of the place, Shut up a desert shore to drowning men, And drive us to the cruel seas again? If our hard fortune no compassion draws, Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws, The gods are just, and will revenge our cause. Æneas was our prince—a juster lord, Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword— Observant of the right, religious of his word. If yet he lives, and draws this vital air, Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair, Nor you, great queen, these offices repent, Which he will equal, and perhaps prevent. We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts, Where king Acestes Trojan lineage boasts. Permit our ships a shelter on your shores, Refitted from your woods with planks and oars, That, if our prince be safe, we may renew Our destined course, and Italy pursue. But if, O best of men! the Fates ordain, That thou art swallowed in the Libyan main, And if our young Iülus be no more, Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore, That we to good Acestes may return, And with our friends our common losses mourn.” Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew With cries and clamours his request renew. The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes, Pondered the speech, then briefly thus replies:— “Trojans! dismiss your fears; my cruel fate, And doubts attending an unsettled state, Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes. Who has not heard the story of your woes, The name and fortune of your native place, The fame and valour of the Phrygian race? We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense, Nor so remote from Phœbus' influence. Whether to Latian shores your course is bent, Or, driven by tempests from your first intent, You seek the good Acestes' government, Your men shall be received, your fleet repaired, And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard: Or, would you stay, and join your friendly powers To raise and to defend the Tyrian towers, My wealth, my city, and myself, are yours. And would to heaven, the storm, you felt, would bring On Carthaginian coasts your wandering king. My people shall, by my command, explore The ports and creeks of every winding shore, And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest Of so renowned and so desired a guest.” Raised in his mind the Trojan hero stood, And longed to break from out his ambient cloud; Achates found it, and thus urged his way:— “From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay? What more can you desire, your welcome sure, Your fleet in safety, and your friend secure? One only wants; and him we saw in vain Oppose the storm, and swallowed in the main. Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid; The rest agrees with what your mother said.” Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way, The mists flew upward, and dissolved in day. The Trojan chief appeared in open sight, August in visage, and serenely bright. His mother goddess, with her hands divine, Had formed his curling locks, and made his temples shine, And given his rolling eyes a sparkling grace, And breathed a youthful vigour on his face; Like polished ivory, beauteous to behold, Or Parian marble, when enchased in gold; Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke, And thus with manly modesty he spoke:— “He whom you seek am I; by tempests tossed, And saved from shipwreck on your Libyan coast; Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne, A prince that owes his life to you alone. Fair majesty! the refuge and redress Of those whom Fate pursues, and wants oppress! You, who your pious offices employ To save the reliques of abandoned Troy; Receive the shipwrecked on your friendly shore, With hospitable rites relieve the poor; Associate in your town a wandering train, And strangers in your palace entertain. What thanks can wretched fugitives return, Who, scattered through the world, in exile mourn? The gods, (if gods to goodness are inclined— If acts of mercy touch their heavenly mind), And, more than all the gods, your generous heart, Conscious of worth, requite its own desert! In you this age is happy, and this earth, And parents more than mortal gave you birth. While rolling rivers into seas shall run, And round the space of heaven the radiant sun; While trees the mountain-tops with shades supply, Your honour, name, and praise, shall never die. Whate'er abode my fortune has assigned, Your image shall be present in my mind.” Thus having said, he turned with pious haste, And joyful his expecting friends embraced: With his right hand Ilioneus was graced, Serestus with his left; then to his breast Cloanthus and the noble Gyas pressed; And so by turns descended to the rest. The Tyrian queen stood fixed upon his face, Pleased with his motions, ravished with his grace; Admired his fortunes, more admired the man; Then recollected stood, and thus began:— “What fate, O goddess-born! what angry powers Have cast you shipwrecked on our barren shores? Are you the great Æneas, known to fame, Who from celestial seed your lineage claim? The same Æneas, whom fair Venus bore To famed Anchises on the Idæan shore? It calls into my mind, though then a child, When Teucer came, from Salamis exiled, And sought my father's aid, to be restored: My father Belus then with fire and sword Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare, And, conquering, finished the successful war. From him the Trojan siege I understood, The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood. Your foe himself the Dardan valour praised, And his own ancestry from Trojans raised. Enter, my noble guest! and you shall find, If not a costly welcome, yet a kind: For I myself, like you, have been distressed, Till heaven afforded me this place of rest. Like you, an alien in a land unknown, I learn to pity woes so like my own.” She said, and to the palace led her guest, Then offered incense, and proclaimed a feast. Nor yet less careful for her absent friends, Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends; Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs, With bleating cries, attend their milky dams; And jars of generous wine, and spacious bowls, She gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls. Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls, And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls: On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine; With loads of massy plate the side-boards shine, And antique vases, all of gold embossed, (The gold itself inferior to the cost Of curious work), where on the sides were seen The fights and figures of illustrious men, From their first founder to the present queen. The good Æneas, whose paternal care Iülus' absence could no longer bear, Dispatched Achates to the ships in haste, To give a glad relation of the past, And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy, Snatched from the ruins of unhappy Troy— A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire; An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire, From Argos by the famed adultress brought, With golden flowers and winding foliage wrought— Her mother Leda's present, when she came To ruin Troy, and set the world on flame; The sceptre Priam's eldest daughter bore, Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore Of double texture, glorious to behold; One order set with gems, and one with gold. Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes, And, in his diligence, his duty shows. But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs, New counsels tries, and new designs prepares: That Cupid should assume the shape and face Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace; Should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead, And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed: For much she feared the Tyrians, double-tongued, And knew the town to Juno's care belonged. These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke, And thus, alarmed, to winged Love she spoke:— “My son, my strength, whose mighty power alone Controls the Thunderer on his awful throne, To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies, And on thy succour and thy faith relies. Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife, By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life; And often hast thou mourned with me his pains. Him Dido now with blandishment detains; But I suspect the town where Juno reigns. For this, 'tis needful to prevent her art, And fire with love the proud Phœnician's heart— A love so violent, so strong, so sure, That neither age can change, nor art can cure. How this may be performed, now take my mind: Ascanius, by his father is designed To come, with presents laden, from the port, To gratify the queen, and gain the court. I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep, And, ravished, in Idalian bowers to keep, Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat. Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace, But only for a night's revolving space, Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face; That when, amidst the fervour of the feast, The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast, And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains, Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins.” The god of love obeys, and sets aside His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride; He walks Iülus in his mother's sight, And in the sweet resemblance takes delight. The goddess then to young Ascanius flies, And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes: Lulled in her lap, amidst a train of Loves, She gently bears him to her blissful groves, Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head, And softly lays him on a flowery bed. Cupid meantime assumed his form and face, Following Achates with a shorter pace, And brought the gifts. The queen already sate Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state, High on a golden bed: her princely guest Was next her side; This, I confess, is improperly translated, and according to the modern fashion of sitting at table. But the ancient custom of lying on beds had not been understood by the unlearned reader. in order sate the rest. Then canisters with bread are heaped on high; The attendants water for their hands supply, And, having washed, with silken towels dry. Next fifty handmaids in long order bore The censers, and with fumes the gods adore: Then youths and virgins, twice as many, join To place the dishes, and to serve the wine. The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast, Approach, and on the painted couches rest. All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze, But view the beauteous boy with more amaze, His rosy-coloured cheeks, his radiant eyes, His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise; Nor pass unpraised the vest and veil divine, Which wandering foliage and rich flowers entwine. But, far above the rest, the royal dame, (Already doomed to love's disastrous flame), With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy, Beholds the presents, and admires the boy. The guileful god, about the hero long, With children's play, and false embraces, hung; Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms With greedy pleasure, and devoured his charms. Unhappy Dido little thought what guest, How dire a god, she drew so near her breast, But he, not mindless of his mother's prayer, Works in the pliant bosom of the fair, And moulds her heart anew, and blots her former care. The dead is to the living love resigned; And all Æneas enters in her mind. Now, when the rage of hunger was appeased, The meat removed, and every guest was pleased, The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crowned, And through the palace cheerful cries resound. From gilded roofs depending lamps display Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day. A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine, The queen commanded to be crowned with wine— The bowl that Belus used, and all the Tyrian line. Then, silence through the hall proclaimed, she spoke:— “O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke, With solemn rites, thy sacred name and power; Bless to both nations this auspicious hour! So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line In lasting concord from this day combine. Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer, And gracious Juno, both be present here! And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address To heaven with mine, to ratify the peace.” The goblet then she took, with nectar crowned (Sprinkling the first libations on the ground), And raised it to her mouth with sober grace, Then, sipping, offered to the next in place. 'Twas Bitias whom she called—a thirsty soul; He took the challenge, and embraced the bowl, With pleasure swilled the gold, nor ceased to draw, Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw. The goblet goes around: Iöpas brought His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught— The various labours of the wandering moon, And whence proceed the eclipses of the sun; The original of men and beasts; and whence The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense, And fixed and erring stars dispose their influence; What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays The summer nights, and shortens winter days. With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song; Those peals are echoed by the Trojan throng. The unhappy queen with talk prolonged the night, And drank large draughts of love with vast delight; Of Priam much inquired, of Hector more; Then asked what arms the swarthy Memnon wore, What troops he landed on the Trojan shore; The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse, And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force; At length, as Fate and her ill stars required, To hear the series of the war desired. “Relate at large, my god-like guest,” she said, “The Grecian stratagems, the town betrayed: The fatal issue of so long a war, Your flight, your wanderings, and your woes, declare; For, since on every sea, on every coast, Your men have been distressed, your navy tossed, Seven times the sun has either tropic viewed, The winter banished, and the spring renewed.” BOOK II. ARGUMENT. Æneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years' siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse. He declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive the ruin of his country, and the various adventures he met with in the defence of it. At last, having been before advised by Hector's ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household gods in another country. In order to this, he carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his wife following him behind. When he comes to the place appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed for him. The destruction of Veii is here shadowed under that of Troy. Livy, in his description of it, seems to have emulated in his prose, and almost equalled, the beauty of Virgil's verse. All were attentive to the godlike man, When from his lofty couch he thus began:— “Great queen, what you command me to relate, Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: An empire from its old foundations rent, And every woe the Trojans underwent; A peopled city made a desert place; All that I saw, and part of which I was; Not even the hardest of our foes could hear, Nor stern Ulysses tell, without a tear. And now the latter watch of wasting night, And setting stars, to kindly rest invite. But, since you take such interest in our woe, And Troy's disastrous end desire to know, I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell What in our last and fatal night befell. “By destiny compelled, and in despair, The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war, And, by Minerva's aid, a fabric reared, Which like a steed of monstrous height appeared: The sides were planked with pine: they feigned it made For their return, and this the vow they paid. Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side, Selected numbers of their soldiers hide: With inward arms the dire machine they load, With iron bowels stuff the dark abode. In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle (While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile) Renowned for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay, Where ships exposed to wind and weather lay. There was their fleet concealed. We thought, for Greece Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release. The Trojans, cooped within their walls so long, Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng, Like swarming bees, and with delight survey The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay: The quarters of the several chiefs they showed— Here Phœnix, here Achilles, made abode; Here joined the battles; there the navy rode. Part on the pile their wondering eyes employ— The pile by Pallas raised to ruin Troy. Thymœtes first ('tis doubtful whether hired, Or so the Trojan destiny required) Moved, that the ramparts might be broken down, To lodge the monster fabric in the town. But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind, The fatal present to the flames designed, Or to the watery deep; at least to bore The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore. The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide, With noise say nothing, and in parts divide. Laocoon, followed by a numerous crowd, Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:— ‘O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns? What more than madness has possessed your brains? Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone? And are Ulysses' arts no better known? This hollow fabric either must inclose, Within its blind recess, our secret foes; Or 'tis an engine raised above the town, To o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down. Somewhat is sure designed, by fraud or force— Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.’ Thus having said, against the steed he threw His forceful spear, which, hissing as it flew, Pierced through the yielding planks of jointed wood, And trembling in the hollow belly stood. The sides, transpierced, return a rattling sound, And groans of Greeks inclosed come issuing through the wound. And, had not heaven the fall of Troy designed, Or had not men been fated to be blind, Enough was said and done to inspire a better mind. Then had our lances pierced the treacherous wood, And Ilian towers and Priam's empire stood. Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring A captive Greek in bands, before the king— Taken, to take—who made himself their prey, To impose on their belief, and Troy betray; Fixed on his aim, and obstinately bent To die undaunted, or to circumvent. About the captive, tides of Trojans flow; All press to see, and some insult the foe. Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguised; Behold a nation in a man comprised. Trembling the miscreant stood; unarmed and bound, He stared, and rolled his haggard eyes around, Then said, ‘Alas! what earth remains, what sea Is open to receive unhappy me? What fate a wretched fugitive attends, Scorned by my foes, abandoned by my friends?’ He said, and sighed, and cast a rueful eye; Our pity kindles, and our passions die. We cheer the youth to make his own defence, And freely tell us what he was, and whence: What news he could impart, we long to know, And what to credit from a captive foe. “His fear at length dismissed, he said,—‘Whate'er My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere: I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim; Greece is my country, Sinon is my name. Though plunged by Fortune's power in misery, 'Tis not in Fortune's power to make me lie. If any chance has hither brought the name Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame, Who suffered from the malice of the times, Accused and sentenced for pretended crimes, Because the fatal wars he would prevent; Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament— Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare Of other means, committed to his care, His kinsman and companion in the war. While Fortune favoured, while his arms support The cause, and ruled the counsels of the court, I made some figure there; nor was my name Obscure, nor I without my share of fame. But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts, Had made impression in the people's hearts, And forged a treason in my patron's name (I speak of things too far divulged by fame), My kinsman fell. Then I, without support, In private mourned his loss, and left the court. Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate With silent grief, but loudly blamed the state, And cursed the direful author of my woes.— 'Twas told again; and hence my ruin rose. I threatened, if indulgent heaven once more Would land me safely on my native shore, His death with double vengeance to restore. This moved the murderer's hate; and soon ensued The effects of malice from a man so proud. Ambiguous rumours through the camp he spread, And sought, by treason, my devoted head; New crimes invented; left unturned no stone, To make my guilt appear, and hide his own; Till Calchas was by force and threatening wrought— But why—why dwell I on that anxious thought? If on my nation just revenge you seek, And 'tis to appear a foe, to appear a Greek; Already you my name and country know; Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow: My death will both the kingly brothers please, And set insatiate Ithacus at ease.’ This fair unfinished tale, these broken starts, Raised expectations in our longing hearts; Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts. His former trembling once again renewed, With acted fear, the villain thus pursued:— ‘Long had the Grecians (tired with fruitless care, And wearied with an unsuccessful war) Resolved to raise the siege, and leave the town; And, had the gods permitted, they had gone. But oft the wintry seas, and southern winds, Withstood their passage home, and changed their minds. Portents and prodigies their souls amazed; But most, when this stupendous pile was raised: Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen, And thunders rattled through a sky serene. Dismayed, and fearful of some dire event, Eurypylus, to inquire their fate, was sent. He from the gods this dreadful answer brought: “O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought, Your passage with a virgin's blood was bought: So must your safe return be bought again, And Grecian blood once more atone the main.” The spreading rumour round the people ran; All feared, and each believed himself the man. Ulysses took the advantage of their fright; Called Calchas, and produced in open sight, Then bade him name the wretch, ordained by fate The public victim, to redeem the state. Already some presaged the dire event, And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant. For twice five days the good old seer withstood The intended treason, and was dumb to blood, Till, tired with endless clamours and pursuit Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute, But, as it was agreed, pronounced that I Was destined by the wrathful gods to die. All praised the sentence, pleased the storm should fall On one alone, whose fury threatened all. The dismal day was come; the priests prepare Their leavened cakes, and fillets for my hair. I followed nature's laws, and must avow, I broke my bonds, and fled the fatal blow. Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay, Secure of safety when they sailed away. But now what further hopes for me remain, To see my friends, or native soil, again; My tender infants, or my careful sire, Whom they returning will to death require; Will perpetrate on them their first design, And take the forfeit of their heads for mine? Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move, If there be faith below, or gods above, If innocence and truth can claim desert, Ye Trojans, from an injured wretch avert.’ “False tears true pity move; the king commands To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands, Then adds these friendly words:—‘Dismiss thy fears; Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs; But truly tell, was it for force or guile, Or some religious end, you raised the pile?’ Thus said the king.—He, full of fraudful arts, This well-invented tale for truth imparts:— ‘Ye lamps of heaven!’ he said, and lifted high His hands now free,—‘thou venerable sky! Inviolable powers, adored with dread! Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head! Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled! Be all of you adjured; and grant I may, Without a crime, the ungrateful Greeks betray, Reveal the secrets of the guilty state, And justly punish whom I justly hate! But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave, If I, to save myself, your empire save. The Grecian hopes, and all the attempts they made, Were only founded on Minerva's aid. But from the time when impious Diomede, And false Ulysses, that inventive head, Her fatal image from the temple drew, The sleeping guardians of the castle slew, Her virgin statue with their bloody hands Polluted, and profaned her holy bands; From thence the tide of fortune left their shore, And ebbed much faster than it flowed before: Their courage languished, as their hopes decayed; And Pallas, now averse, refused her aid. Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare Her altered mind, and alienated care. When first her fatal image touched the ground, She sternly cast her glaring eyes around, That sparkled as they rolled, and seemed to threat: Her heavenly limbs distilled a briny sweat. Thrice from the ground she leaped, was seen to wield Her brandished lance, and shake her horrid shield. Then Calchas bade our host for flight prepare, And hope no conquest from the tedious war, Till first they sailed for Greece; with prayers besought Her injured power, and better omens brought. And now their navy ploughs the watery main, Yet soon expect it on your shores again, With Pallas pleased; as Calchas did ordain. But first, to reconcile the blue-eyed maid For her stolen statue and her tower betrayed, Warned by the seer, to her offended name We raised and dedicate this wondrous frame, So lofty, lest through your forbidden gates It pass, and intercept our better fates: For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost; And Troy may then a new Palladium boast; For so religion and the gods ordain, That, if you violate with hands profane Minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn (Which omen, O ye gods, on Græcia turn!) But if it climb, with your assisting hands, The Trojan walls, and in the city stands; Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenæ burn, And the reverse of fate on us return.’ “With such deceits he gained their easy hearts, Too prone to credit his perfidious arts. What Diomede, nor Thetis' greater son, A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done— False tears and fawning words the city won. “A greater omen, and of worse portent, Did our unwary minds with fear torment, Concurring to produce the dire event. Laocoön, Neptune's priest by lot that year, With solemn pomp then sacrificed a steer; When (dreadful to behold!) from sea we spied Two serpents, ranked abreast, the seas divide, And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide. Their flaming crests above the waves they show; Their bellies seem to burn the seas below; Their speckled tails advance to steer their course, And on the sounding shore the flying billows force. And now the strand, and now the plain, they held. Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were filled; Their nimble tongues they brandished as they came, And licked their hissing jaws, that sputtered flame. We fled amazed; their destined way they take, And to Laocoön and his children make; And first around the tender boys they wind, Then with their sharpened fangs their limbs and bodies grind. The wretched father, running to their aid With pious haste, but vain, they next invade; Twice round his waist their winding volumes rolled; And twice about his gasping throat they fold. The priest thus doubly choked—their crests divide, And towering o'er his head in triumph ride. With both his hands he labours at the knots; His holy fillets the blue venom blots; His roaring fills the flitting air around. Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound, He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies, And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies. Their tasks performed, the serpents quit their prey, And to the tower of Pallas make their way: Couched at her feet, they lie protected there, By her large buckler, and protended spear. Amazement seizes all; the general cry Proclaims Laocoön justly doomed to die, Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood, And dared to violate the sacred wood. All vote to admit the steed, that vows be paid, And incense offered, to the offended maid. A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare; Some hoisting-levers, some the wheels, prepare, And fasten to the horse's feet; the rest With cables haul along the unwieldy beast. Each on his fellow for assistance calls; At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls, Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crowned, And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around. Thus raised aloft, and then descending down, It enters o'er our heads, and threats the town. O sacred city, built by hands divine! O valiant heroes of the Trojan line! Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound. Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate, We haul along the horse in solemn state; Then place the dire portent within the tower. Cassandra cried, and cursed the unhappy hour; Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree, All heard, and none believed the prophecy. With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste, In jollity, the day ordained to be the last. Meantime the rapid heavens rolled down the light, And on the shaded ocean rushed the night; Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held, But easy sleep their weary limbs compelled. The Grecians had embarked their naval powers From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores, Safe under covert of the silent night, And guided by the imperial galley's light; When Sinon, favoured by the partial gods, Unlocked the horse, and oped his dark abodes; Restored to vital air our hidden foes, Who joyful from their long confinement rose. Thessander bold, and Sthenelus their guide, And dire Ulysses, down the cable slide: Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus, haste; Nor was the Podalirian hero last, Nor injured Menelaüs, nor the famed Epeus, who the fatal engine framed. A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join To invade the town, oppressed with sleep and wine. Those few they find awake, first meet their fate; Then to their fellows they unbar the gate. “'Twas in the dead of night, when sleep repairs Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares, When Hector's ghost before my sight appears: A bloody shroud he seemed, and bathed in tears; Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain, Thessalian coursers dragged him o'er the plain. Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust Through the bored holes; his body black with dust; Unlike that Hector, who returned, from toils Of war, triumphant in Æacian spoils, Or him, who made the fainting Greeks retire, And launched against their navy Phrygian fire. His hair and beard stood stiffened with his gore; And all the wounds he for his country bore, Now streamed afresh, and with new purple ran. I wept to see the visionary man, And, while my trance continued, thus began:— ‘O light of Trojans, and support of Troy, Thy father's champion, and thy country's joy! O, long expected by thy friends! from whence Art thou so late returned for our defence? Do we behold thee, wearied as we are, With length of labours, and with toils of war? After so many funerals of thy own, Art thou restored to thy declining town? But say, what wounds are these? what new disgrace Deforms the manly features of thy face?’ “To this the spectre no reply did frame, But answered to the cause for which he came, And, groaning from the bottom of his breast, This warning, in these mournful words, expressed: ‘O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight, The flames and horrors of this fatal night. The foes already have possessed the wall; Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall. Enough is paid to Priam's royal name, More than enough to duty and to fame. If by a mortal hand my father's throne Could be defended, 'twas by mine alone. Now Troy to thee commends her future state, And gives her gods companions of thy fate: From their assistance, happier walls expect, Which, wandering long, at last thou shalt erect.” He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes, The venerable statues of the gods, With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir, The wreaths and reliques of the immortal fire. “Now peals of shouts come thundering from afar, Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war: The noise approaches, though our palace stood Aloof from streets, encompassed with a wood. Louder, and yet more aloud, I hear the alarms Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms. Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay, But mount the terrace, thence the town survey, And hearken what the frightful sounds convey. Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne, Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn; Or deluges, descending on the plains, Sweep o'er the yellow year, destroy the pains Of labouring oxen, and the peasant's gains; Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away Flocks, folds, and trees, an undistinguished prey— The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far The wasteful ravage of the watery war. Then Hector's faith was manifestly cleared, And Grecian frauds in open light appeared. The palace of Deïphobus ascends In smoky flames, and catches on his friends. Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright With splendour not their own, and shine with Trojan light. New clamours and new clangours now arise, The sound of trumpets mixed with fighting cries. With frenzy seized, I run to meet the alarms, Resolved on death, resolved to die in arms, But first to gather friends, with them to oppose (If Fortune favoured) and repel the foes; Spurred by my courage, by my country fired, With sense of honour and revenge inspired. “Panthûs, Apollo's priest, a sacred name Had 'scaped the Grecian swords, and passed the flame: With reliques loaden, to my doors he fled, And by the hand his tender grandson led. ‘What hope, O Panthûs? whither can we run? Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?’ Scarce had I said, when Panthûs, with a groan,— ‘Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town! The fatal day, the appointed hour, is come, When wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands. The fire consumes the town, the foe commands; And armed hosts, an unexpected force, Break from the bowels of the fatal horse. Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about The flames; and foes, for entrance, press without, With thousand others, whom I fear to name, More than from Argos or Mycenæ came. To several posts their parties they divide; Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide: The bold they kill, the unwary they surprise; Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies. The warders of the gate but scarce maintain The unequal combat, and resist in vain.’ “I heard; and heaven, that well-born souls inspires, Prompts me, through lifted swords and rising fires, To run, where clashing arms and clamour calls, And rush undaunted to defend the walls. Ripheus and Iphitus by my side engage, For valour one renowned, and one for age. Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew My motions and my mien, and to my party drew; With young Corœbus, who by love was led To win renown, and fair Cassandra's bed; And lately brought his troops to Priam's aid, Forewarned in vain by the prophetic maid: Whom when I saw resolved in arms to fall, And that one spirit animated all, ‘Brave souls!’ said I,—‘but brave, alas! in vain— Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain. You see the desperate state of our affairs, And heaven's protecting powers are deaf to prayers. The passive gods behold the Greeks defile Their temples, and abandon to the spoil Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire To save a sinking town, involved in fire. Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes: Despair of life the means of living shows’ So bold a speech encouraged their desire Of death, and added fuel to their fire. “As hungry wolves, with raging appetite, Scour through the fields, nor fear the stormy night— Their whelps at home expect the promised food, And long to temper their dry chaps in blood— So rushed we forth at once: resolved to die, Resolved, in death, the last extremes to try, We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare The unequal combat in the public square: Night was our friend; our leader was despair. What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night? What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright? An ancient and imperial city falls; The streets are filled with frequent funerals; Houses and holy temples float in blood, And hostile nations make a common flood. Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn, The vanquished triumph, and the victors mourn. Ours take new courage from despair and night; Confused the fortune is, confused the fight. All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears; And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears. Androgeos fell among us, with his band, Who thought us Grecians newly come to land. ‘From whence,’ said he, ‘my friends, this long delay? You loiter, while the spoils are borne away: Our ships are laden with the Trojan store; And you, like truants, come too late ashore.’ He said, but soon corrected his mistake, Found, by the doubtful answers which we make. Amazed, he would have shunned the unequal fight; But we, more numerous, intercept his flight. As when some peasant in a bushy brake, Has with unwary footing pressed a snake; He starts aside, astonished, when he spies His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes; So, from our arms, surprised Androgeos flies— In vain; for him and his we compass round, Possessed with fear, unknowing of the ground, And of their lives an easy conquest found, Thus Fortune on our first endeavour smiled. Corœbus then, with youthful hopes beguiled, Swoln with success, and of a daring mind, This new invention fatally designed. ‘My friends,’ said he, ‘since Fortune shows the way, 'Tis fit we should the auspicious guide obey. For what has she these Grecian arms bestowed, But their destruction, and the Trojans' good? Then change we shields, and their devices bear: Let fraud supply the want of force in war. They find us arms.’ This said, himself he dressed In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest, His painted buckler, and his plumy crest. Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train, Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain. Mixed with the Greeks, we go with ill presage, Flattered with hopes to glut our greedy rage; Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet, And strew, with Grecian carcases, the street. Thus while their straggling parties we defeat, Some to the shore and safer ships retreat; And some, oppressed with more ignoble fear, Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there. “But, ah! what use of valour can be made, When heaven's propitious powers refuse their aid? Behold the royal prophetess, the fair Cassandra, dragged by her dishevelled hair, Whom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands, In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands: On heaven she cast her eyes, she sighed, she cried— 'Twas all she could—her tender arms were tied. So sad a sight Corœbus could not bear; But, fired with rage, distracted with despair, Amid the barbarous ravishers he flew. Our leader's rash example we pursue: But storms of stones, from the proud temple's height, Pour down, and on our battered helms alight: We from our friends received this fatal blow, Who thought us Grecians, as we seemed in show. They aim at the mistaken crests, from high; And ours beneath the ponderous ruin lie. Then, moved with anger and disdain, to see Their troops dispersed, the royal virgin free, The Grecians rally, and their powers unite, With fury charge us, and renew the fight. The brother kings with Ajax join their force, And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse. “Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try, Contending for the kingdom of the sky, South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne— The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn: Then Nereus strikes the deep: the billows rise, And, mixed with ooze and sand, pollute the skies. The troops we squandered first, again appear From several quarters, and inclose the rear. They first observe, and to the rest betray, Our different speech; our borrowed arms survey. Oppressed with odds, we fall; Corœbus first, At Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierced. Then Ripheus followed, in the unequal fight; Just of his word, observant of the right: Heaven thought not so. Dymas their fate attends, With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends. Nor, Panthûs, thee thy mitre, nor the bands Of awful Phœbus, saved from impious hands. Ye Trojan flames! your testimony bear, What I performed, and what I suffered there; No sword avoiding in the fatal strife, Exposed to death, and prodigal of life. Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault: I strove to have deserved the death I sought. But, when I could not fight, and would have died, Borne off to distance by the growing tide, Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence, With Pelias wounded, and without defence. New clamours from the invested palace ring: We run to die, or disengage the king. So hot the assault, so high the tumult rose, While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose, As all the Dardan and Argolic race Had been contracted in that narrow space; Or as all Ilium else were void of fear, And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there. Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes, Secure advancing, to the turrets rose: Some mount the scaling-ladders; some, more bold, Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold: Their left hand gripes their bucklers in the ascent, While with the right they seize the battlement. From the demolished towers, the Trojans throw Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe: And heavy beams and rafters from the sides, (Such arms their last necessity provides!) And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high, The marks of state, and ancient royalty. The guards below, fixed in the pass, attend The charge undaunted, and the gate defend. Renewed in courage with recovered breath, A second time we ran to tempt our death, To clear the palace from the foe, succeed The weary living, and revenge the dead. “A postern-door, yet unobserved and free, Joined by the length of a blind gallery, To the king's closet led—a way well known To Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne— Through which she brought Astyanax, unseen, To cheer his grandsire, and his grandsire's queen. Through this we pass, and mount the tower, from whence With unavailing arms the Trojans make defence. From this the trembling king had oft descried The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride. Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew, Then, wrenching with our hands, the assault renew; And, where the rafters on the columns meet, We push them headlong with our arms and feet. The lightning flies not swifter than the fall, Nor thunder louder than the ruined wall: Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death. Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent: We cease not from above, nor they below relent. Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threatening loud, With glittering arms conspicuous in the crowd. So shines, renewed in youth, the crested snake, Who slept the winter in a thorny brake, And, casting off his slough when spring returns, Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns, Restored with poisonous herbs; his ardent sides Reflect the sun; and, raised on spires, he rides High o'er the grass: hissing he rolls along, And brandishes by fits his forky tongue. Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon, His father's charioteer, together run To force the gate: the Scyrian infantry Rush on in crowds, and the barred passage free. Entering the court, with shouts the skies they rend; And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend. Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows, And with his axe repeated strokes bestows On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply, Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly. He hews apace: the double bars at length Yield to his axe, and unresisted strength. A mighty breach is made: the rooms concealed Appear, and all the palace is revealed— The halls of audience, and of public state, And where the lonely queen in secret sate. Armed soldiers now by trembling maids are seen, With not a door, and scarce a space, between. The house is filled with loud laments and cries, And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies. The fearful matrons run from place to place, And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace. The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies, And all his father sparkles in his eyes. Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain: The bars are broken, and the guards are slain. In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill; Those few defendants whom they find, they kill. Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood; Bears down the dams with unresisted sway, And sweeps the cattle and the cots away. These eyes beheld him, when he marched between The brother kings: I saw the unhappy queen, The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood, To stain his hallowed altar with his blood. The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he, So large a promise, of a progeny), The posts of plated gold, and hung with spoils, Fell the reward of the proud victor's toils. Where'er the raging fire had left a space, The Grecians enter, and possess the place. “Perhaps you may of Priam's fate inquire. He—when he saw his regal town on fire, His ruined palace, and his entering foes, On every side inevitable woes— In arms disused, invests his limbs, decayed, Like them, with age; a late and useless aid. His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain; Loaded, not armed, he creeps along with pain, Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain! Uncovered but by heaven, there stood in view An altar: near the hearth a laurel grew, Doddered with age, whose boughs encompass round The household gods, and shade the holy ground. Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain. Driven like a flock of doves along the sky, Their images they hug, and to their altars fly. The queen, when she beheld her trembling lord, And hanging by his side a heavy sword, ‘What rage,’ she cried, ‘has seized my husband's mind? What arms are these, and to what use designed? These times want other aids! Were Hector here, Even Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear. With us, one common shelter thou shalt find, Or in one common fate with us be joined.’ She said, and with a last salute embraced The poor old man, and by the laurel placed. Behold! Polites, one of Priam's sons, Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs. Through swords and foes, amazed and hurt, he flies Through empty courts, and open galleries. Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues, And often reaches, and his thrusts renews. The youth transfixed, with lamentable cries, Expires before his wretched parents' eyes: Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw, The fear of death gave place to nature's law; And, shaking more with anger than with age, ‘The gods,’ said he, ‘requite thy brutal rage! As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must, If there be gods in heaven, and gods be just— Who tak'st in wrongs an insolent delight; With a son's death to infect a father's sight. Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire To call thee his—not he, thy vaunted sire, Thus used my wretched age: the gods he feared, The laws of nature and of nations heard. He cheered my sorrows, and, for sums of gold, The bloodless carcase of my Hector sold; Pitied the woes a parent underwent, And sent me back in safety from his tent.’ “This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw, Which, fluttering, seemed to loiter as it flew: Just, and but barely, to the mark it held, And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield. “Then Pyrrhus thus: ‘Go thou from me to fate, And to my father my foul deeds relate. Now die!’—With that he dragged the trembling sire, Sliddering through clottered blood and holy mire (The mingled paste his murdered son had made), Hauled from beneath the violated shade, And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid. His right hand held his bloody falchion bare, His left he twisted in his hoary hair; Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found; The lukewarm blood came rushing through the wound, And sanguine streams distained the sacred ground. Thus Priam fell, and shared one common fate With Troy in ashes, and his ruined state— He, who the sceptre of all Asia swayed, Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obeyed. On the bleak shore now lies the abandoned king, A headless carcase, and a nameless thing. “Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood: My father's image filled my pious mind, Lest equal years might equal fortune find. Again I thought on my forsaken wife, And trembled for my son's abandoned life. I looked about, but found myself alone, Deserted at my need! My friends were gone. Some spent with toil, some with despair oppressed, Leaped headlong from the heights; the flames consumed the rest. Thus wandering in my way without a guide, The graceless Helen in the porch I spied Of Vesta's temple; there she lurked alone; Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown: But, by the flames that cast their blaze around, That common bane of Greece and Troy I found. For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword; More dreads the vengeance of her injured lord; Even by those gods, who refuged her, abhorred. Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard, Resolved to give her guilt the due reward. ‘Shall she triumphant sail before the wind, And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind? Shall she her kingdom and her friends review, In state attended with a captive crew, While unrevenged the good old Priam falls, And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls? For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood Were swelled with bodies, and were drunk with blood? 'Tis true, a soldier can small honour gain, And boast no conquest, from a woman slain: Yet shall the fact not pass without applause, Of vengeance taken in so just a cause. The punished crime shall set my soul at ease, And murmuring manes of my friends appease.’ Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light Spread o'er the place; and, shining heavenly bright, My mother stood revealed before my sight— Never so radiant did her eyes appear; Not her own star confessed a light so clear— Great in her charms, as when on gods above She looks, and breathes herself into their love. She held my hand, the destined blow to break; Then from her rosy lips began to speak:— ‘My son! from whence this madness, this neglect Of my commands, and those whom I protect? Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind. Look if your helpless father yet survive, Or if Ascanius or Creüsa live. Around your house the greedy Grecians err; And these had perished in the nightly war, But for my presence and protecting care. Not Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault; But by the gods was this destruction brought. Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve The mists and films that mortal eyes involve, Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see The shape of each avenging deity. Enlightened thus, my just commands fulfil, Nor fear obedience to your mother's will. Where yon disordered heap of ruin lies, Stones rent from stones,—where clouds of dust arise,— Amid that smother, Neptune holds his place, Below the wall's foundation drives his mace, And heaves the building from the solid base. Look, where, in arms, imperial Juno stands Full in the Scæan gate, with loud commands, Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands. See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud, Bestrides the tower, refulgent through the cloud: See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies, And arms against the town the partial deities. Haste hence, my son! this fruitless labour end: Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend: Haste! and a mother's care your passage shall befriend.’ She said, and swiftly vanished from my sight, Obscure in clouds, and gloomy shades of night. I looked, I listened; dreadful sounds I hear; And the dire forms of hostile gods appear. Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent), And Ilium from its old foundations rent— Rent like a mountain-ash, which dared the winds, And stood the sturdy strokes of labouring hinds. About the roots the cruel axe resounds; The stumps are pierced with oft-repeated wounds: The war is felt on high; the nodding crown Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honours down. To their united force it yields, though late, And mourns with mortal groans the approaching fate: The roots no more their upper load sustain; But down she falls, and spreads a ruin through the plain. “Descending thence, I 'scape through foes and fire: Before the goddess, foes and flames retire. Arrived at home, he, for whose only sake, Or most for his, such toils I undertake— The good Anchises—whom, by timely flight, I purposed to secure on Ida's height— Refused the journey, resolute to die, And add his funerals to the fate of Troy, Rather than exile and old age sustain. ‘Go you, whose blood runs warm in every vein. Had heaven decreed, that I should life enjoy, Heaven had decreed to save unhappy Troy. 'Tis, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown. Make haste to save the poor remaining crew, And give this useless corpse a long adieu. These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; At least the pitying foes will aid my death, To take my spoils, and leave my body bare: As for my sepulchre, let heaven take care. 'Tis long since I, for my celestial wife, Loathed by the gods, have dragged a lingering life; Since every hour and moment I expire, Blasted from heaven by Jove's avenging fire.’ This oft repeated, he stood fixed to die: Myself, my wife, my son, my family, Entreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry— ‘What! will he still persist, on death resolve, And in his ruin all his house involve?’ He still persists his reasons to maintain; Our prayers, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. “Urged by despair, again I go to try The fate of arms, resolved in fight to die. What hope remains, but what my death must give? ‘Can I, without so dear a father, live? You term it prudence, what I baseness call: Could such a word from such a parent fall? If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain, That nothing should of ruined Troy remain, And you conspire with Fortune to be slain; The way to death is wide, the approaches near: For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear, Reeking with Priam's blood—the wretch who slew The son (inhuman) in the father's view, And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew. O goddess mother! give me back to Fate; Your gift was undesired, and came too late. Did you, for this, unhappy me convey Through foes and fires, to see my house a prey? Shall I my father, wife, and son, behold, Weltering in blood, each other's arms infold? Haste! gird my sword, though spent, and overcome: 'Tis the last summons to receive our doom. I hear thee, Fate! and I obey thy call! Not unrevenged the foe shall see me fall. Restore me to the yet unfinished fight: My death is wanting to conclude the night.’ Armed once again, my glittering sword I wield, While the other hand sustains my weighty shield, And forth I rush to seek the abandoned field. I went; but sad Creüsa stopped my way, And 'cross the threshold in my passage lay, Embraced my knees, and, when I would have gone, Showed me my feeble sire, and tender son. ‘If death be your design—at least,’ said she, ‘Take us along to share your destiny. If any further hopes in arms remain, This place, these pledges of your love, maintain. To whom do you expose your father's life, Your son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife?’ While thus she fills the house with clamorous cries, Our hearing is diverted by our eyes: For, while I held my son, in the short space Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace (Strange to relate!) from young Iülus’ head A lambent flame arose, which gently spread Around his brows, and on his temples fed. Amazed, with running water we prepare To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair; But old Anchises, versed in omens, reared His hands to heaven, and this request preferred:— ‘If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend Thy will—if piety can prayers commend— Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleased to send.’ Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear A peal of rattling thunder roll in air: There shot a streaming lamp along the sky, Which on the winged lightning seemed to fly: From o'er the roof the blaze began to move, And, trailing, vanished in the Idæan grove. It swept a path in heaven, and shone a guide, Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died. “The good old man with suppliant hands implored The gods' protection, and their star adored. ‘Now, now,’ said he, ‘my son, no more delay! I yield, I follow where heaven shows the way. Keep (O my country gods!) our dwelling-place, And guard this relic of the Trojan race, This tender child!—These omens are your own, And you can yet restore the ruined town. At least accomplish what your signs foreshow: I stand resigned, and am prepared to go.’ “He said.—The crackling flames appear on high, And driving sparkles dance along the sky. With Vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire, And near our palace roll the flood of fire. ‘Haste, my dear father! ('tis no time to wait), And load my shoulders with a willing freight. Whate'er befalls, your life shall be my care; One death, or one deliverance, we will share. My hand shall lead our little son; and you, My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue. Next you, my servants, heed my strict commands: Without the walls a ruined temple stands, To Ceres hallowed once; a cypress nigh Shoots up her venerable head on high, By long religion kept; there bend your feet, And in divided parties let us meet. Our country gods, the relics, and the bands, Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands: In me 'tis impious holy things to bear, Red as I am with slaughter, new from war, Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.’ Thus ordering all that prudence could provide, I clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide, And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back, The welcome load of my dear father take; While on my better hand Ascanius hung, And with unequal paces tript along. Creüsa kept behind: by choice we stray Through every dark and every devious way. I, who so bold and dauntless, just before, The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore, At every shadow now am seized with fear, Not for myself, but for the charge I bear; Till, near the ruined gate arrived at last, Secure, and deeming all the danger past, A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear. My father, looking through the shades with fear, Cried out,—‘Haste, haste, my son! the foes are nigh; Their swords and shining armour I descry.’ Some hostile god, for some unknown offence, Had sure bereft my mind of better sense; For, while through winding ways I took my flight, And sought the shelter of the gloomy night, Alas! I lost Creüsa: hard to tell If by her fatal destiny she fell, Or weary sate, or wandered with affright; But she was lost for ever to my sight. I knew not, or reflected, till I meet My friends, at Ceres' now deserted seat. We met: not one was wanting; only she Deceived her friends, her son, and wretched me. What mad expressions did my tongue refuse? Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse? This was the fatal blow, that pained me more Than all I felt from ruined Troy before. Stung with my loss, and raving with despair, Abandoning my now forgotten care, Of counsel, comfort, and of hope, bereft, My sire, my son, my country gods, I left. In shining armour once again I sheathe My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death. Then headlong to the burning walls I run, And seek the danger I was forced to shun. I tread my former tracks, through night explore Each passage, every street I crossed before. All things were full of horror and affright, And dreadful even the silence of the night. Then to my father's house I make repair, With some small glimpse of hope to find her there. Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met: The house was filled with foes, with flames beset. Driven on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire, Through air transported, to the roofs aspire. From thence to Priam's palace I resort, And search the citadel, and desert court. Then, unobserved, I pass by Juno's church: A guard of Grecians had possessed the porch; There Phœnix and Ulysses watch the prey, And thither all the wealth of Troy convey— The spoils which they from ransacked houses brought, And golden bowls from burning altars caught, The tables of the gods, the purple vests, The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests. A rank of wretched youths, with pinioned hands, And captive matrons, in long order stands. Then, with ungoverned madness, I proclaim, Through all the silent streets, Creüsa's name: Creüsa still I call; at length she hears, And sudden, through the shades of night, appears— Appears, no more Creüsa, nor my wife, But a pale spectre, larger than the life. Aghast, astonished, and struck dumb with fear, I stood; like bristles rose my stiffened hair. Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief:— ‘Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief. Desist, my much-loved lord, to indulge your pain; You bear no more than what the gods ordain. My fates permit me not from hence to fly; Nor he, the great controller of the sky. Long wandering ways for you the powers decree— On land hard labours, and a length of sea. Then, after many painful years are past, On Latium's happy shore you shall be cast, Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds The flowery meadows, and the feeding folds. There end your toils; and there your fates provide A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride: There Fortune shall the Trojan line restore, And you for lost Creüsa weep no more. Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame, The imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame, Or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace My goddess mother, or my royal race. And now, farewell! the parent of the gods Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes. I trust our common issue to your care.’ She said, and gliding passed unseen in air. I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue; And thrice about her neck my arms I flung, And, thrice deceived, on vain embraces hung. Light as an empty dream at break of day, Or as a blast of wind, she rushed away. “Thus having passed the night in fruitless pain, I to my longing friends return again— Amazed the augmented number to behold, Of men and matrons mixed, of young and old— A wretched exiled crew together brought, With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught, Resolved, and willing, under my command, To run all hazards both of sea and land. The Morn began, from Ida, to display Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day: Before the gates the Grecians took their post, And all pretence of late relief was lost. I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire. BOOK III. ARGUMENT. Æneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the fleet with which he sailed, and the success of his first voyage to Thrace. From thence he directs his course to Delos, and asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his habitation? By a mistake of the oracle's answer, he settles in Crete. His household gods give him the true sense of the oracle, in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy. He is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprising adventures, till at length he lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies. This is the place which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose, and threw him upon the Carthaginian coast. “When heaven had overturned the Trojan state And Priam's throne, by too severe a fate; When ruined Troy became the Grecian's prey, And Ilium's lofty towers in ashes lay; Warned by celestial omens, we retreat, To seek in foreign lands a happier seat. Near old Antandros, and at Ida's foot, The timber of the sacred groves we cut, And build our fleet—uncertain yet to find What place the gods for our repose assigned. Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, When old Anchises summoned all to sea: The crew my father and the Fates obey. With sighs and tears I leave my native shore, And empty fields, where Ilium stood before. My sire, my son, our less and greater gods, All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods. “Against our coast appears a spacious land, Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command, (Thracia the name—the people bold in war— Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care), A hospitable realm while Fate was kind, With Troy in friendship and religion joined. I land, with luckless omens; then adore Their gods, and draw a line along the shore: I lay the deep foundations of a wall, And Ænos, named from me, the city call. To Dionæan Venus vows are paid, And all the powers that rising labours aid; A bull on Jove's imperial altar laid. Not far, a rising hillock stood in view; Sharp myrtles, on the sides, and cornels grew. There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes, And shade our altar with their leafy greens, I pulled a plant—with horror I relate A prodigy so strange, and full of fate— The rooted fibres rose; and, from the wound, Black bloody drops distilled upon the ground. Mute and amazed, my hair with terror stood; Fear shrunk my sinews, and congealed my blood. Manned once again, another plant I try: That other gushed with the same sanguine dye. Then, fearing guilt for some offence unknown, With prayers and vows the Dryads I atone, With all the sisters of the woods, and most The god of arms, who rules the Thracian coast— That they, or he, these omens would avert, Release our fears, and better signs impart. Cleared, as I thought, and fully fixed at length To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength: I bent my knees against the ground: once more The violated myrtle ran with gore. Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb, A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renewed My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:— ‘Why dost thou thus my buried body rend? O! spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend! Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood: The tears distil not from the wounded wood; But every drop this living tree contains, Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins. O! fly from this inhospitable shore, Warned by my fate; for I am Polydore! Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued, Again shoot upward, by my blood renewed.’ “My faltering tongue and shivering limbs declare My horror, and in bristles rose my hair. When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent, Old Priam, fearful of the war's event, This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent: Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far From noise and tumults, and destructive war, Committed to the faithless tyrant's care; Who, when he saw the power of Troy decline, Forsook the weaker with the strong to join— Broke every bond of nature and of truth, And murdered, for his wealth, the royal youth. O sacred hunger of pernicious gold! What bands of faith can impious lucre hold? Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears, I call my father, and the Trojan peers— Relate the prodigies of heaven—require What he commands, and their advice desire. All vote to leave that execrable shore, Polluted with the blood of Polydore; But, ere we sail, his funeral rites prepare, Then, to his ghost, a tomb and al ars rear. In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round, With baleful cypress and blue fillets crowned, With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound. Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour, And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore. “Now, when the raging storms no longer reign, But southern gales invite us to the main, We launch our vessels, with a prosperous wind, And leave the cities and the shores behind. “An island in the Ægæan main appears: Neptune and watery Doris claim it theirs. It floated once, till Phœbus fixed the sides To rooted earth, and now it braves the tides. Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore, With needful ease our weary limbs restore, And the Sun's temple and his town adore. “Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crowned, His hoary locks with purple fillets bound, Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend, Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend; Invites him to his palace; and, in sign Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join. Then to the temple of the god I went, And thus, before the shrine, my vows present:— ‘Give, O Thymbræus! give a resting place To the sad relics of the Trojan race; A seat secure, a region of their own, A lasting empire, and a happier town. Where shall we fix? where shall our labours end? Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend? Let not my prayers a doubtful answer find; But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.’ Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground, The laurels, and the lofty hills around; And from the tripos rushed a bellowing sound. Prostrate we fell; confessed the present god, Who gave this answer from his dark abode:— ‘Undaunted youths! go, seek that mother earth From which your ancestors derive their birth. The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race, In her old bosom, shall again embrace. Through the wide world the Æneian house shall reign, And children's children shall the crown sustain.’ Virgil translated this verse from Homer, Homer had it from Orpheus, and Orpheus from an ancient oracle of Apollo. On this account it is that Virgil immediately subjoins these words, Hæc Phœbus, etc. Eustathius takes notice that the old poets were wont to take whole paragraphs from one another; which justifies our poet for what he borrows from Homer. Bochartus, in his letter to Segrais, mentions an oracle which he found in the fragments of an old Greek historian, the sense whereof is this in English, that, when the empire of the Priamidæ should be destroyed, the line of Anchises should succeed. Venus therefore, says the historian, was desirous to have a son by Anchises, though he was then in his decrepit age; accordingly she had Æneas. After this, she sought occasion to ruin the race of Priam, and set on foot the intrigue of Alexander (or Paris) with Helena. She being ravished, Venus pretended still to favour the Trojans, lest they should restore Helen, in case they should be reduced to the last necessity. Whence it appears, that the controversy betwixt Juno and Venus was on no trivial account, but concerned the succession to a great empire. Thus Phœbus did our future fates disclose: A mighty tumult, mixed with joy, arose. All are concerned to know what place the god Assigned, and where determined our abode. My father, long revolving in his mind The race and lineage of the Trojan kind, Thus answered their demands:—‘Ye princes, hear Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear. The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame, Sacred of old to Jove's imperial name, In the mid ocean lies, with large command, And on its plains a hundred cities stand. Another Ida rises there, and we From thence derive our Trojan ancestry. From thence, as 'tis divulged by certain fame, To the Rhœtean shores old Teucer came; There fixed, and there the seat of empire chose, Ere Ilium and the Trojan towers arose. In humble vales they built their soft abodes, Till Cybele, the mother of the gods, With tinkling cymbals charmed the Idæan woods. She secret rites and ceremonies taught, And to the yoke the savage lions brought. Let us the land, which heaven appoints, explore; Appease the winds, and seek the Gnosian shore. If Jove assists the passage of our fleet, The third propitious dawn discovers Crete.’ Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid On smoking altars, to the gods he paid— A bull, to Neptune an oblation due, Another bull to bright Apollo, slew— A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please, And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas. Ere this, a flying rumour had been spread, That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled, Expelled and exiled; that the coast was free From foreign or domestic enemy. We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea; By Naxos, famed for vintage, make our way; Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight Of Paros' isle, with marble quarries white. We pass the scattered isles of Cyclades, That, scarce distinguished, seem to stud the seas. The shouts of sailors double near the shores; They stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars. ‘All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!’ they cry, And swiftly through the foamy billows fly. Full on the promised land at length we bore, With joy descending on the Cretan shore. With eager haste a rising town I frame, Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name: The name itself was grateful:—I exhort To found their houses, and erect a fort. Our ships are hauled upon the yellow strand; The youth begin to till the laboured land; And I myself new marriages promote, Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot; When rising vapours choke the wholesome air, And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year; The trees devouring caterpillars burn; Parched was the grass, and blighted was the corn: Nor 'scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high, With pestilential heat infects the sky: My men—some fall, the rest in fevers fry. Again my father bids me seek the shore Of sacred Delos, and the god implore, To learn what end of woes we might expect, And to what clime our weary course direct. “'Twas night, when every creature, void of cares, The common gift of balmy slumber shares; The statues of my gods (for such they seemed), Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeemed, Before me stood, majestically bright, Full in the beams of Phœbe's entering light. Then thus they spoke, and eased my troubled mind: ‘What from the Delian god thou goest to find, He tells thee here, and sends us to relate. Those powers are we, companions of thy fate, Who from the burning town by thee were brought, Thy fortune followed, and thy safety wrought. Through seas and lands as we thy steps attend, So shall our care thy glorious race befriend. An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain, A town, that o'er the conquered world shall reign. Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build; Nor let thy weary mind to labours yield: But change thy seat; for not the Delian god, Nor we, have given thee Crete for our abode. A land there is, Hesperia called of old (The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold— The Œnotrians held it once), by later fame Now called Italia, from the leader's name. Iasius there and Dardanus were born; From thence we came, and thither must return. Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet. Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.’ “Astonished at their voices and their sight (Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night; I saw, I knew their faces, and descried, In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied), I started from my couch; a clammy sweat On all my limbs and shivering body sate. To heaven I lift my hands with pious haste, And sacred incense in the flames I cast. Thus to the gods their perfect honours done, More cheerful to my good old sire I run, And tell the pleasing news. In little space He found his error of the double race; Not, as before he deemed, derived from Crete; No more deluded by the doubtful seat; Then said,—‘O son, turmoiled in Trojan fate! Such things as these Cassandra did relate. This day revives within my mind, what she Foretold of Troy renewed in Italy, And Latian lands; but who could then have thought, That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought? Or who believed what mad Cassandra taught? Now let us go, where Phœbus leads the way.’ He said; and we with glad consent obey, Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, We spread our sails before the willing wind. Now from the sight of land our galleys move, With only seas around, and skies above; When o'er our heads descends a burst of rain, And night with sable clouds involves the main; The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; The scattered fleet is forced to several ways; The face of heaven is ravished from our eyes, And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. Cast from our course, we wander in the dark; No stars to guide, no point of land to mark. Even Palinurus no distinction found Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reigned around. Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays, Without distinction, and three sunless days; The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds, We view a rising land, like distant clouds; The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight, And curling smoke ascending from their height. The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply; From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly. At length I land upon the Strophades, Safe from the danger of the stormy seas. Those isles are compassed by the Ionian main, The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign, Forced by the winged warriors to repair To their old homes, and leave their costly fare. Monsters more fierce offended heaven ne'er sent From hell's abyss, for human punishment— With virgin-faces, but with wombs obscene, Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean; With claws for hands, and looks for ever lean. “We landed at the port, and soon beheld Fat herds of oxen graze the flowery field, And wanton goats without a keeper strayed.— With weapons we the welcome prey invade, Then call the gods for partners of our feast, And Jove himself, the chief invited guest. We spread the tables on the greensward ground; We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round; When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry, And clattering wings, the hungry Harpies fly: They snatch the meat, defiling all they find, And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind. Close by a hollow rock, again we sit, New dress the dinner, and the beds refit, Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade, Where tufted trees a native arbour made. Again the holy fires on altars burn; And once again the ravenous birds return, Or from the dark recesses where they lie, Or from another quarter of the sky— With filthy claws their odious meal repeat, And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat. I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare, And with the hellish nation wage the war. They, as commanded, for the fight provide, And in the grass their glittering weapons hide; Then, when along the crooked shore we hear Their clattering wings, and saw the foes appear, Misenus sounds a charge: we take the alarm, And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm. In this new kind of combat, all employ Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy— In vain:—the fated skin is proof to wounds; And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds. At length rebuffed, they leave their mangled prey, And their stretched pinions to the skies display. Yet one remained—the messenger of Fate, High on a craggy cliff Celæno sate, And thus her dismal errand did relate:— ‘What! not contented with our oxen slain, Dare you with heaven an impious war maintain, And drive the Harpies from their native reign? Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind What Jove decrees, what Phœbus has designed, And I, the Furies' queen, from both relate— You seek the Italian shores, foredoomed by Fate: The Italian shores are granted you to find, And a safe passage to the port assigned. But know, that, ere your promised walls you build, My curses shall severely be fulfilled. Fierce famine is your lot—for this misdeed, Reduced to grind the plates on which you feed.’ She said, and to the neighbouring forest flew. Our courage fails us, and our fears renew. Hopeless to win by war, to prayers we fall, And on the offended Harpies humbly call, And (whether gods or birds obscene they were) Our vows, for pardon and for peace, prefer. But old Anchises, offering sacrifice, And lifting up to heaven his hands and eyes, Adored the greater gods—‘Avert,’ said he, ‘These omens! render vain this prophecy, And from the impending curse a pious people free.’ Thus having said, he bids us put to sea; We loose from shore our halsers, and obey, And soon with swelling sails pursue our watery way. Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear; And next by rocky Neritos we steer: We fly from Ithaca's detested shore, And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore. At length Leucate's cloudy top appears, And the Sun's temple, which the sailor fears. Resolved to breathe a while from labour past, Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast, And joyful to the little city haste. Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay To Jove, the guide and patron of our way. The customs of our country we pursue, And Trojan games on Actian shores renew. Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil, And exercise the wrestlers' noble toil— Pleased to have sailed so long before the wind, And left so many Grecian towns behind. The sun had now fulfilled his annual course, And Boreas on the seas displayed his force: I fixed upon the temple's lofty door The brazen shield which vanquished Abas bore; The verse beneath my name and action speaks:— ‘These arms Æneas took from conquering Greeks.’ Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly. The sight of high Phæacia soon we lost, And skimmed along Epirus' rocky coast. Then to Chaonia's port our course we bend, And, landed, to Buthrotus' heights ascend. Here wondrous things were loudly blazed by Fame— How Helenus revived the Trojan name, And reigned in Greece; that Priam's captive son Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne; And fair Andromache, restored by Fate, Once more was happy in a Trojan mate. I leave my galleys riding in the port, And long to see the new Dardanian court. By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate, Then solemnised her former husband's fate. Green altars, raised of turf, with gifts she crowned, And sacred priests in order stand around, And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound. The grove itself resembles Ida's wood; And Simoïs seemed the well-dissembled flood. But when, at nearer distance, she beheld My shining armour and my Trojan shield, Astonished at the sight, the vital heat Forsakes her limbs, her veins no longer beat: She faints, she falls, and scarce recovering strength, Thus, with a faltering tongue, she speaks at length: ‘Are you alive, O goddess-born?’ she said, ‘Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?’ At this she cast a loud and frightful cry.— With broken words I made this brief reply: ‘All of me, that remains, appears in sight; I live, if living be to loathe the light— No phantom; but I drag a wretched life, My fate resembling that of Hector's wife. What have you suffered since you lost your lord? By what strange blessing are you now restored? Still are you Hector's? or is Hector fled, And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus' bed?’ With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone, After a modest pause, she thus begun:— “Oh, only happy maid of Priam's race, Whom death delivered from the foe's embrace! Commanded on Achilles' tomb to die, Not forced, like us, to hard captivity, Or in a haughty master's arms to lie. In Grecian ships, unhappy we were borne, Endured the victor's lust, sustained the scorn: Thus I submitted to the lawless pride Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride. Cloyed with possession, he forsook my bed, And Helen's lovely daughter sought to wed; Then me to Trojan Helenus resigned, And his two slaves in equal marriage joined; Till young Orestes, pierced with deep despair, And longing to redeem the promised fair, Before Apollo's altar slew the ravisher. By Pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regained: At least one half with Helenus remained. Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls, And names, from Pergamus, his rising walls. But you what fates have landed on our coast? What gods have sent you, or what storms have tossed? Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy, Saved from the ruins of unhappy Troy? O! tell me how his mother's loss he bears, What hopes are promised from his blooming years, How much of Hector in his face appears?’— She spoke; and mixed her speech with mournful cries, And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes. At length her lord descends upon the plain, In pomp, attended with a numerous train; Receives his friends, and to the city leads, And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds. Proceeding on, another Troy I see, Or, in less compass, Troy's epitome. A rivulet by the name of Xanthus ran, And I embrace the Scæan gate again. My friends in porticoes were entertained, And feasts and pleasures through the city reigned. The tables filled the spacious hall around, And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crowned. Two days we passed in mirth, till friendly gales, Blown from the south, supplied our swelling sails. Then to the royal seer I thus began:— ‘O thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of man, The laws of heaven, and what the stars decree, Whom Phœbus taught unerring prophecy, From his own tripod, and his holy tree; Skilled in the winged inhabitants of air, What auspices their notes and flights declare— O! say; for all religious rites portend A happy voyage, and a prosperous end; And every power and omen of the sky Direct my course for destined Italy; But only dire Celæno, from the gods, A dismal famine fatally forebodes— O! say, what dangers I am first to shun, What toils to vanquish, and what course to run.’ “The prophet first with sacrifice adores The greater gods; their pardon then implores; Unbinds the fillet from his holy head; To Phœbus, next, my trembling steps he led, Full of religious doubts and awful dread. Then, with his god possessed, before the shrine, These words proceeded from his mouth divine:— ‘O goddess-born! (for heaven's appointed will, With greater auspices of good than ill, Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs; Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects), Of many things, some few I shall explain, Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main, And how at length the promised shore to gain. The rest the Fates from Helenus conceal, And Juno's angry power forbids to tell. First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh, Will far from your deluded wishes fly; Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy: For you must cruise along Sicilian shores, And stem the currents with your struggling oars; Then round the Italian coast your navy steer; And, after this, to Circe's island veer; And, last, before your new foundations rise, Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies. Now mark the signs of future ease and rest, And bear them safely treasured in thy breast. When, in the shady shelter of a wood, And near the margin of a gentle flood, Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground, With thirty sucking young encompassed round; The dam and offspring white as falling snow— These on thy city shall their name bestow, And there shall end thy labours and thy woe. Nor let the threatened famine fright thy mind; For Phœbus will assist, and Fate the way will find. Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent, Which fronts from far the Epirian continent: Those parts are all by Grecian foes possessed. The savage Locrians here the shores infest: There fierce Idomeneus his city builds, And guards with arms the Salentinian fields; And on the mountain's brow Petilia stands, Which Philoctetes with his troops commands. Even when thy fleet is landed on the shore, And priests with holy vows the gods adore, Then with a purple veil involve your eyes, Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice. These rites and customs to the rest commend, That to your pious race they may descend. “‘When, parted hence, the wind, that ready waits For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits, Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way, Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea: Veer starboard sea and land. The Italian shore, And fair Sicilia's coast, were one, before An earthquake caused the flaw: the roaring tides The passage broke, that land from land divides; And, where the lands retired, the rushing ocean rides. Distinguished by the straits, on either hand, Now rising cities in long order stand, And fruitful fields:—so much can time invade The mouldering work, that beauteous Nature made.— Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides: Charybdis roaring on the left presides, And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides; Then spouts them from below: with fury driven, The waves mount up, and wash the face of heaven. But Scylla from her den, with open jaws, The sinking vessel in her eddy draws, Then dashes on the rocks.—A human face, And virgin bosom, hides her tail's disgrace: Her parts obscene below the waves descend, With dogs inclosed, and in a dolphin end. 'Tis safer, then, to bear aloof to sea, And coast Pachynus, though with more delay, Than once to view misshapen Scylla near, And the loud yell of watery wolves to hear. “‘Besides, if faith to Helenus be due, And if prophetic Phœbus tell me true, Do not this precept of your friend forget, Which therefore more than once I must repeat: Above the rest, great Juno's name adore; Pay vows to Juno; Juno's aid implore. Let gifts be to the mighty queen designed, And mollify with prayers her haughty mind. Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free, And you shall safe descend on Italy. Arrived at Cumæ, when you view the flood Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood, The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find, Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclined. She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits, The notes and names, inscribed, to leaves commits. What she commits to leaves, in order laid, Before the cavern's entrance are displayed: Unmoved they lie; but, if a blast of wind Without, or vapours issue from behind, The leaves are borne aloft in liquid air, And she resumes no more her museful care, Nor gathers from the rocks her scattered verse, Nor sets in order what the winds disperse. Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid The madness of the visionary maid, And with loud curses leave the mystic shade. “‘Think it not loss of time a while to stay, Though thy companions chide thy long delay; Though summoned to the seas, though pleasing gales Invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails: But beg the sacred priestess to relate With willing words, and not to write, thy fate. The fierce Italian people she will show, And all thy wars, and all thy future woe, And what thou may'st avoid, and what must undergo. She shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind, And teach thee how the happy shores to find. This is what heaven allows me to relate; Now part in peace; pursue thy better fate, And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state.’ “This when the priest with friendly voice declared, He gave me licence, and rich gifts prepared: Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want With heavy gold, and polished elephant, Then Dodonæan caldrons put on board, And every ship with sums of silver stored. A trusty coat of mail to me he sent, Thrice chained with gold, for use and ornament; The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest, That flourished with a plume and waving crest. Nor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends; And large recruits he to my navy sends— Men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores; Supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars. Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails, Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales. The prophet blessed the parting crew, and, last, With words like these, his ancient friend embraced:— ‘Old happy man, the care of gods above, Whom heavenly Venus honoured with her love, And twice preserved thy life when Troy was lost! Behold from far the wished Ausonian coast: There land; but take a larger compass round, For that before is all forbidden ground. The shore that Phœbus has designed for you, At further distance lies, concealed from view. Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes, Blessed in a son, and favoured by the gods: For I with useless words prolong your stay, When southern gales have summoned you away.’ “Nor less the queen our parting thence deplored, Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord. A noble present to my son she brought, A robe with flowers on golden tissue wrought, A Phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside Of precious texture, and of Asian pride. ‘Accept,’ she said, ‘these monuments of love, Which in my youth with happier hands I wove: Regard these trifles for the giver's sake; 'Tis the last present Hector's wife can make. Thou call'st my lost Astyanax to mind; In thee, his features and his form I find. His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame; Such were his motions; such was all his frame; And ah! had heaven so pleased, his years had been the same.’ “With tears I took my last adieu, and said,— ‘Your fortune, happy pair, already made, Leaves you no further wish. My different state, Avoiding one, incurs another fate. To you a quiet seat the gods allow: You have no shores to search, no seas to plough, Nor fields of flying Italy to chase— Deluding visions, and a vain embrace! You see another Simoïs, and enjoy The labour of your hands, another Troy, With better auspice than her ancient towers, And less obnoxious to the Grecian powers. If e'er the gods, whom I with vows adore, Conduct my steps to Tiber's happy shore; If ever I ascend the Latian throne, And build a city I may call my own; As both of us our birth from Troy derive, So let our kindred lines in concord live, And both in acts of equal friendship strive. Our fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same: The double Troy shall differ but in name; That what we now begin, may never end, But long to late posterity descend.’ “Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore, The shortest passage to the Italian shore. Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light, And hills were hid in dusky shades of night: We land, and, on the bosom of the ground, A safe retreat and a bare lodging found. Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep Their watches, and the rest securely sleep. The night, proceeding on with silent pace, Stood in her noon, and viewed with equal face Her steepy rise, and her declining race. Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy The face of heaven, and the nocturnal sky; And listened, every breath of air to try; Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course, The Pleiads, Hyads, and their watery force; And both the Bears is careful to behold, And bright Orion, armed with burnished gold. Then, when he saw no threatening tempest nigh, But a sure promise of a settled sky, He gave the sign to weigh: we break our sleep, Forsake the pleasing shore, and plough the deep. And now the rising morn with rosy light Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight; When we from far, like bluish mists, descry The hills, and then the plains, of Italy. Achates first pronounced the joyful sound; Then ‘Italy!’ the cheerful crew rebound. My sire Anchises crowned a cup with wine, And, offering, thus implored the powers divine:— ‘Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas, And you who raging winds and waves appease, Breathe on our swelling sails a prosperous wind, And smooth our passage to the port assigned!’ The gentle gales their flagging force renew, And now the happy harbour is in view. Minerva's temple then salutes our sight, Placed, as a landmark, on the mountain's height. We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore; The curling waters round the galleys roar. The land lies open to the raging east, Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compressed, Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain, And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain. The port lies hid within; on either side, Two towering rocks the narrow mouth divide. The temple, which aloft we viewed before, To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore. Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld Were four white steeds that cropped the flowery field. ‘War, war is threatened from this foreign ground,’ (My father cried), ‘where warlike steeds are found. Yet since reclaimed to chariots they submit, And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit, Peace may succeed to war.’—Our way we bend To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend; There prostrate to the fierce virago pray, Whose temple was the landmark of our way. Each with a Phrygian mantle veiled his head, And all commands of Helenus obeyed, And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid. These dues performed, we stretch our sails, and stand To sea, forsaking that suspected land. From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view, For Hercules renowned, if fame be true. Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands; Caulonian towers, and Scylacæan strands For shipwrecks feared. Mount Ætna thence we spy, Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky. Far off we hear the waves with surly sound Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound. The billows break upon the sounding strand, And roll the rising tide, impure with sand. Then thus Anchises, in experience old:— ‘'Tis that Charybdis which the seer foretold, And those the promised rocks! Bear off to sea!’ With haste the frighted mariners obey. First Palinurus to the larboard veered; Then all the fleet by his example steered. To heaven aloft on ridgy waves we ride, Then down to hell descend, when they divide; And thrice our galleys knocked the stony ground, And thrice the hollow rocks returned the sound, And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around. The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun; And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run. The port capacious, and secure from wind, Is to the foot of thundering Ætna joined. By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high; By turns hot embers from her entrails fly, And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky. Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown, And, shivered by the force, come piece-meal down. Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow, Fed from the fiery springs that boil below. Enceladus, they say, transfixed by Jove, With blasted limbs came tumbling from above; And, where he fell, the avenging father drew This flaming hill, and on his body threw. As often as he turns his weary sides, He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides. In shady woods we pass the tedious night, Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright, Of which no cause is offered to the sight. For not one star was kindled in the sky, Nor could the moon her borrowed light supply; For misty clouds involved the firmament, The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent. Scarce had the rising sun the day revealed, Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispelled, When from the woods there bolts, before our sight, Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite, So thin, so ghastly meagre, and so wan, So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man. This thing, all tattered, seemed from far to implore Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore. We look behind, then view his shaggy beard; His clothes were tagged with thorns, and filth his limbs besmeared; The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face, Appeared a Greek, and such indeed he was. He cast on us, from far, a frightful view, Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew— Stood still, and paused; then all at once began To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran. Soon as approached, upon his knees he falls, And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls:— ‘Now, by the powers above, and what we share From Nature's common gift, this vital air, O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more; But bear me far from this unhappy shore. Tis true, I am a Greek, and farther own, Among your foes besieged the imperial town. For such demerits if my death be due, No more for this abandoned life I sue: This only favour let my tears obtain, To throw me headlong in the rapid main: Since nothing more than death my crime demands, I die content, to die by human hands.’ He said, and on his knees my knees embraced: I bade him boldly tell his fortune past, His present state, his lineage, and his name, The occasion of his fears, and whence he came. The good Anchises raised him with his hand; Who thus, encouraged, answered our demand:— ‘From Ithaca, my native soil, I came To Troy; and Achæmenides my name. Me my poor father with Ulysses sent (O! had I stayed, with poverty content!) But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen Left me forsaken in the Cyclops' den. The cave, though large, was dark; the dismal floor Was paved with mangled limbs and putrid gore. Our monstrous host, of more than human size, Erects his head, and stares within the skies. Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue. Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view! The joints of slaughtered wretches are his food; And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood. These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand He seized two captives of our Grecian band; Stretched on his back, he dashed against the stones Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones: With spouting blood the purple pavement swims, While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs. Not unrevenged Ulysses bore their fate, Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state; For, gorged with flesh, and drunk with human wine, While fast asleep the giant lay supine, Snoring aloud, and belching from his maw His indigested foam, and morsels raw— We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround The monstrous body, stretched along the ground: Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand To bore his eye-ball with a flaming brand. Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye; For only one did the vast frame supply— But that a globe so large, his front it filled, Like the sun's disk, or like a Grecian shield. The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends; This vengeance followed for our slaughtered friends.— But haste, unhappy wretches! haste to fly! Your cables cut, and on your oars rely! Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears, A hundred more this hated island bears: Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep; Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep; Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep. And now three moons their sharpened horns renew, Since thus in woods and wilds, obscure from view, I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright, And in deserted caverns lodge by night; Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree: From far I hear his thundering voice resound, And trampling feet that shake the solid ground. Cornels and savage berries of the wood, And roots and herbs, have been my meagre food. While all around my longing eyes I cast, I saw your happy ships appear at last. On those I fixed my hopes, to these I run; 'Tis all I ask, this cruel race to shun; What other death you please, yourselves bestow.’ Scarce had he said, when on the mountain's brow We saw the giant shepherd stalk before His following flock, and leading to the shore— A monstrous bulk, deformed, deprived of sight; His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright. His ponderous whistle from his neck descends; His woolly care their pensive lord attends: This only solace his hard fortune sends. Soon as he reached the shore, and touched the waves, From his bored eye the guttering blood he laves: He gnashed his teeth, and groaned; through seas he strides, And scarce the topmost billows touched his sides. Seized with a sudden fear, we run to sea, The cables cut, and silent haste away; The well-deserving stranger entertain; Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main. The giant hearkened to the dashing sound: But, when our vessels out of reach he found, He strided onward, and in vain essayed The Ionian deep, and durst no further wade. With that he roared aloud: the dreadful cry Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly, Before the bellowing noise, to distant Italy. The neighbouring Ætna trembling all around, The winding caverns echo to the sound. His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar, And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore. We saw their stern distorted looks, from far, And one-eyed glance, that vainly threatened war— A dreadful council! with their heads on high (The misty clouds about their foreheads fly), Not yielding to the towering tree of Jove, Or tallest cypress of Diana's grove. New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail; We tug at every oar, and hoist up every sail, And take the advantage of the friendly gale. Forewarned by Helenus, we strive to shun Charybdis' gulf, nor dare to Scylla run. An equal fate on either side appears: We, tacking to the left, are free from fears; For, from Pelorus' point, the North arose, And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows. His rocky mouth we pass; and make our way By Thapsus and Megara's winding bay. This passage Achæmenides had shown, Tracing the course which he before had run. Right o'er-against Plemmyrium's watery strand, There lies an isle, once called the Ortygian land. Alpheüs, as old fame reports, has found From Greece a secret passage under ground, By love to beauteous Arethusa led; And, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed. As Helenus enjoined, we next adore Diana's name, protectress of the shore. With prosperous gales we pass the quiet sounds Of still Helorus, and his fruitful bounds. Then, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey The rocky shore extended to the sea. The town of Camarine from far we see, And fenny lake, undrained by Fate's decree. In sight of the Geloan fields we pass, And the large walls, where mighty Gela was; Then Agragas, with lofty summits crowned, Long for the race of warlike steeds renowned. We passed Selinus, and the palmy land, And widely shun the Lilybæan strand, Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand. At length on shore the weary fleet arrived, Which Drepanum's unhappy port received, Here, after endless labours, often tossed By raging storms, and driven on every coast, My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost— Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain, Saved through a thousand toils, but saved in vain. The prophet, who my future woes revealed, Yet this, the greatest and the worst, concealed; And dire Celæno, whose foreboding skill Denounced all else, was silent of this ill. This my last labour was. Some friendly god From thence conveyed us to your blest abode.” Thus, to the listening queen, the royal guest His wandering course and all his toils expressed; And here concluding, he retired to rest. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Æneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting-match for his entertainment. Juno, by Venus's consent, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives Æneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed. Jupiter dispatches Mercury to Æneas, to warn him from Carthage. Æneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister's entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing would prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes. But anxious cares already seized the queen; She fed within her veins a flame unseen; The hero's valour, acts, and birth, inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire. His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart, Improve the passion, and increase the smart. Now, when the purple morn had chased away The dewy shadows, and restored the day, Her sister first with early care she sought, And thus in mournful accents eased her thought:— “My dearest Anna! what new dreams affright My labouring soul! what visions of the night Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast With strange ideas of our Trojan guest! His worth, his actions, and majestic air, A man descended from the gods declare. Fear ever argues a degenerate kind; His birth is well asserted by his mind. Then, what he suffered, when by Fate betrayed! What brave attempts for falling Troy he made! Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke, That, were I not resolved against the yoke Of hapless marriage—never to be cursed With second love, so fatal was my first— To this one error I might yield again; For, since Sichæus was untimely slain, This only man is able to subvert The fixed foundations of my stubborn heart. And, to confess my frailty, to my shame, Somewhat I find within, if not the same, Too like the sparkles of my former flame. But first let yawning earth a passage rend, And let me through the dark abyss descend— First let avenging Jove, with flames from high, Drive down this body to the nether sky, Condemned with ghosts in endless night to lie— Before I break the plighted faith I gave! No! he who had my vows shall ever have; For, whom I loved on earth, I worship in the grave.” She said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes, And stopped her speech. Her sister thus replies:— “O dearer than the vital air I breathe! Will you to grief your blooming years bequeathe, Condemned to waste in woes your lonely life, Without the joys of mother, or of wife? Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe, Are known or valued by the ghosts below? I grant, that, while your sorrows yet were green, It well became a woman, and a queen, The vows of Tyrian Princes to neglect, To scorn Iarbas, and his love reject, With all the Libyan lords of mighty name; But will you fight against a pleasing flame? This little spot of land, which heaven bestows, On every side is hemmed with warlike foes; Gætulian cities here are spread around, And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound; Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land, And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand; Barcæan troops besiege the narrow shore, And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more. Propitious heaven, and gracious Juno, led This wandering navy to your needful aid: How will your empire spread, your city rise, From such a union, and with such allies! Implore the favour of the powers above, And leave the conduct of the rest to love. Continue still your hospitable way, And still invent occasions of their stay, Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat, And planks and oars repair their shattered fleet.” These words, which from a friend and sister came, With ease resolved the scruples of her fame, And added fury to the kindled flame. Inspired with hope, the project they pursue; On every altar sacrifice renew; A chosen ewe of two years old they pay To Ceres, Bacchus, and the god of day. Preferring Juno's power (for Juno ties The nuptial knot, and makes the marriage-joys), The beauteous queen before her altar stands, And holds the golden goblet in her hands. A milk-white heifer she with flowers adorns, And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns; And, while the priests with prayer the gods invoke, She feeds their altars with Sabæan smoke, With hourly care the sacrifice renews, And anxiously the panting entrails views. What priestly rites, alas! what pious art, What vows, avail to cure a bleeding heart? A gentle fire she feeds within her veins, Where the soft god secure in silence reigns. Sick with desire, and seeking him she Ioves, From street to street the raving Dido roves. So, when the watchful shepherd, from the blind, Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind, Distracted with her pain she flies the woods, Bounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods— With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart. And now she leads the Trojan chief along The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng; Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town, Which love, without his labour, makes his own. This pomp she shows, to tempt her wandering guest; Her faltering tongue forbids to speak the rest. When day declines, and feasts renew the night, Still on his face she feeds her famished sight; She longs again to hear the prince relate His own adventures, and the Trojan fate. He tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain, For still she begs to hear it once again. The hearer on the speaker's mouth depends, And thus the tragic story never ends. Then, when they part, when Phœbe's paler light Withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite, She last remains, when every guest is gone, Sits on the bed he pressed, and sighs alone; Absent, her absent hero sees and hears; Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears, And seeks the father's image in the child, If love by likeness might be so beguiled. Meantime the rising towers are at a stand; No labours exercise the youthful band, Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know; The mole is left unfinished to the foe; The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie, Short of their promised height, that seemed to threat the sky. But when imperial Juno, from above, Saw Dido fettered in the chains of love, Hot with the venom which her veins inflamed, And by no sense of shame to be reclaimed, With soothing words to Venus she begun:— “High praises, endless honours, you have won, And mighty trophies, with your worthy son! Two gods a silly woman have undone! Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect This rising city, which my hands erect: But shall celestial discord never cease? 'Tis better ended in a lasting peace. You stand possessed of all your soul desired; Poor Dido with consuming love is fired. Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join; So Dido shall be yours, Æneas mine— One common kingdom, one united line. Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey, And lofty Carthage for a dower convey.” Then Venus (who her hidden fraud descried, Which would the sceptre of the world misguide To Libyan shores) thus artfully replied:— “Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, And such alliance and such gifts refuse, If Fortune with our joint desires comply? The doubt is all from Jove, and destiny; Lest he forbid, with absolute command, To mix the people in one common land— Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line, In lasting leagues and sure succession, join. But you, the partner of his bed and throne, May move his mind; my wishes are your own.” “Mine,” said imperial Juno, “be the care:— Time urges now:—to perfect this affair, Attend my counsel, and the secret share. When next the Sun his rising light displays, And gilds the world below with purple rays, The queen, Æneas, and the Tyrian court, Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort. There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around, And cheerful horns, from side to side, resound, A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain; The fearful train shall take their speedy flight, Dispersed, and all involved in gloomy night; One cave a grateful shelter shall afford To the fair princess and the Trojan lord. I will myself the bridal bed prepare, If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there: So shall their loves be crowned with due delights, And Hymen shall be present at the rites.” The queen of love consents, and closely smiles At her vain project, and discovered wiles. The rosy morn was risen from the main, And horns and hounds awake the princely train: They issue early through the city gate, Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait, With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse. The Tyrian peers and officers of state, For the slow queen, in antechambers wait; Her lofty courser, in the court below, Who his majestic rider seems to know, Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground, And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around. The queen at length appears: on either hand, The brawny guards in martial order stand. A flowered cymar with golden fringe she wore, And at her back a golden quiver bore; Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains, A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains. Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase. But far above the rest in beauty shines The great Æneas, when the troop he joins; Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost Of wintery Xanthus, and the Lycian coast, When to his native Delos he resorts, Ordains the dances, and renews the sports; Where painted Scythians, mixed with Cretan bands, Before the joyful altars join their hands: Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below The merry madness of the sacred show. Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose; A golden fillet binds his awful brows; His quiver sounds.—Not less the prince is seen In manly presence, or in lofty mien. Now had they reached the hills, and stormed the seat Of savage beasts, in dens, their last retreat. The cry pursues the mountain-goats: they bound From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground: Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train, In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain, And a long chase, in open view, maintain. The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides, Spurs through the vale, and these and those outrides. His horse's flanks and sides are forced to feel The clanking lash, and goring of the steel. Impatiently he views the feeble prey, Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way, And rather would the tusky boar attend, Or see the tawny lion downward bend. Meantime, the gathering clouds obscure the skies: From pole to pole the forky lightning flies; The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours A wintry deluge down, and sounding showers. The company, dispersed, to coverts ride, And seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow side. The rapid rains, descending from the hills, To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills. The queen and prince, as Love or Fortune guides, One common cavern in her bosom hides. Then first the trembling earth the signal gave, And flashing fires enlighten all the cave; Hell from below, and Juno from above, And howling nymphs, were conscious to their love. From this ill-omen'd hour, in time arose Debate and death, and all succeeding woes, The queen, whom sense of honour could not move, No longer made a secret of her love, But called it marriage, by that specious name To veil the crime, and sanctify the shame. The loud report through Libyan cities goes. Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows— Swift from the first; and every moment brings New vigour to her flights, new pinions to her wings. Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size; Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies. Enraged against the gods, revengeful Earth Produced her, last of the Titanian birth— Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste— A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast. As many plumes as raise her lofty flight, So many piercing eyes enlarge her sight; Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong, And every mouth is furnished with a tongue, And round with listening ears the flying plague is hung. She fills the peaceful universe with cries; No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes; By day, from lofty towers her head she shews, And spreads through trembling crowds disastrous news; With court informers haunts, and royal spies; Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with lies. Talk is her business; and her chief delight To tell of prodigies, and cause affright. She fills the people's ears with Dido's name, Who, “lost to honour and the sense of shame, Admits into her throne and nuptial bed A wandering guest, who from his country fled: Whole days with him she passes in delights, And wastes in luxury long winter nights, Forgetful of her fame, and royal trust, Dissolved in ease, abandoned to her lust.” The goddess widely spreads the loud report, And flies at length to king Iarbas' court. When first possessed with this unwelcome news, Whom did he not of men and gods accuse? This prince, from ravished Garamantis born, A hundred temples did with spoils adorn, In Ammon's honour, his celestial sire; A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire; And, through his vast dominions, priests ordained, Whose watchful care these holy rites maintained. The gates and columns were with garlands crowned, And blood of victim beasts enriched the ground. He, when he heard a fugitive could move The Tyrian princess, who disdained his love, His breast with fury burned, his eyes with fire, Mad with despair, impatient with desire; Then on the sacred altars pouring wine, He thus with prayers implored his sire divine:— “Great Jove, propitious to the Moorish race, Who feast on painted beds, with offerings grace Thy temples, and adore thy power divine With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine! Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign? Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance? Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance? A wandering woman builds, within our state, A little town, bought at an easy rate; She pays me homage (and my grants allow A narrow space of Libyan lands to plough); Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led, Admits a banished Trojan to her bed! And now this other Paris, with his train Of conquered cowards, must in Afric reign! (Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess, Their locks with oil perfumed, their Lydian dress.) He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame; And I, rejected I, adore an empty name!” His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferred, And held his altar's horns. The mighty Thunderer heard, Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drowned, Lost in their loves, insensible of shame, And both forgetful of their better fame. He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends, By whom this menacing command he sends:— “Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky; Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly: There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days In slothful riot and inglorious ease, Nor minds the future city, given by Fate. To him this message from my mouth relate:— Not so fair Venus hoped, when twice she won Thy life with prayers, nor promised such a son. Hers was a hero, destined to command A martial race, and rule the Latian land; Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw, And on the conquered world impose the law. If glory cannot move a mind so mean, Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean, Yet why should he defraud his son of fame, And grudge the Romans their immortal name? What are his vain designs? what hopes he more From his long lingering on a hostile shore, Regardless to redeem his honour lost, And for his race to gain the Ausonian coast? Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake; With this command the slumbering warrior wake.” Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds His flying feet, and mounts the western winds: And, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies, With rapid force they bear him down the skies. But first he grasps within his awful hand The mark of sovereign power, his magic wand; With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves; With this he drives them down the Stygian waves; With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight, And eyes, though closed in death, restores to light. Thus armed, the god begins his airy race, And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space; Now sees the top of Atlas, as he flies, Whose brawny back supports the starry skies; Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crowned, Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapours bound. Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin The founts of rolling streams their race begin; A beard of ice on his large breast depends.— Here, poised upon his wings, the god descends: Then, rested thus, he from the towering height Plunged downward with precipitated flight, Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood. As water-fowl, who seek their fishy food, Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show; By turns they dance aloft, and dive below: Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies, And near the surface of the water flies, Till, having passed the seas, and crossed the sands, He closed his wings, and stooped on Libyan lands, Where shepherds once were housed in homely sheds; Now towers within the clouds advance their heads. Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince New ramparts raising for the town's defence. A purple scarf, with gold embroidered o'er (Queen Dido's gift), about his waist he wore; A sword, with glittering gems diversified, For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side. Then thus, with winged words, the god began, Resuming his own shape—“Degenerate man! Thou woman's property! what mak'st thou here, These foreign walls and Tyrian towers to rear, Forgetful of thy own? All-powerful Jove, Who sways the world below and heaven above, Has sent me down with this severe command: What means thy lingering in the Libyan land? If glory cannot move a mind so mean, Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean, Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir: The promised crown let young Ascanius wear, To whom the Ausonian sceptre, and the state Of Rome's imperial name, is owed by Fate.” So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight, Involved in clouds, and vanished out of sight. The pious prince was seized with sudden fear; Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair. Revolving in his mind the stern command, He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land. What should he say? or how should he begin? What course, alas! remains to steer between The offended lover and the powerful queen? This way, and that, he turns his anxious mind, And all expedients tries, and none can find. Fixed on the deed, but doubtful of the means, After long thought, to this advice he leans: Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair The fleet, and ship their men, with silent care: Some plausible pretence he bids them find, To colour what in secret he designed. Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose, Before the love-sick lady heard the news; And move her tender mind, by slow degrees, To suffer what the sovereign power decrees: Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say.— They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey. But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise: (What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes?) She was the first to find the secret fraud, Before the fatal news was blazed abroad. Love the first motions of the lover hears, Quick to presage, and even in safety fears. Nor impious Fame was wanting to report The ships repaired, the Trojans' thick resort, And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court. Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound, And impotent of mind, she roves the city round. Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear, When, from afar, their nightly god they hear, And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear. At length she finds the dear perfidious man; Prevents his formed excuse, and thus began:— “Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly, And undiscovered 'scape a lover's eye? Nor could my kindness your compassion move, Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love? Or is the death of a despairing queen Not worth preventing, though too well foreseen? Even when the wintry winds command your stay, You dare the tempests, and defy the sea. False, as you are, suppose you were not bound To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound; Were Troy restored, and Priam's happy reign, Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main? See, whom you fly! am I the foe you shun? Now, by those holy vows, so late begun, By this right hand (since I have nothing more To challenge, but the faith you gave before), I beg you by these tears too truly shed, By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed; If ever Dido, when you most were kind, Were pleasing in your eyes, or touched your mind; By these my prayers, if prayers may yet have place, Pity the fortunes of a falling race! For you, I have provoked a tyrant's hate, Incensed the Libyan and the Tyrian state; For you alone, I suffer in my fame, Bereft of honour, and exposed to shame! Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest? (That only name remains of all the rest!) What have I left? or whither can I fly? Must I attend Pygmalion's cruelty, Or till Iarbas shall in triumph lead A queen, that proudly scorned his proffered bed? Had you deferred, at least, your hasty flight, And left behind some pledge of our delight, Some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight, Some young Æneas to supply your place, Whose features might express his father's face; I should not then complain to live bereft Of all my husband, or be wholly left.” Here paused the queen. Unmoved he holds his eyes, By Jove's command; nor suffered love to rise, Though heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:— “Fair queen, you never can enough repeat Your boundless favours, or I own my debt; Nor can my mind forget Eliza's name, While vital breath inspires this mortal frame. This only let me speak in my defence— I never hoped a secret flight from hence, Much less pretended to the lawful claim Of sacred nuptials, or a husband's name. For, if indulgent heaven would leave me free, And not submit my life to Fate's decree, My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore, Those relics to review, their dust adore, And Priam's ruined palace to restore. But now the Delphian oracle commands, And Fate invites me to the Latian lands. That is the promised place to which I steer, And all my vows are terminated there. If you, a Tyrian and a stranger born, With walls and towers a Libyan town adorn, Why may not we—like you, a foreign race— Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place? As often as the night obscures the skies With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise, Anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears, Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears; And young Ascanius justly may complain, Defrauded of his fate and destined reign. Even now the herald of the gods appeared— Waking I saw him, and his message heard. From Jove he came commissioned, heavenly bright With radiant beams, and manifest to sight (The sender and the sent I both attest): These walls he entered, and those words expressed:— Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command; Forced by my fate, I leave your happy land.” Thus while he spoke, already she began, With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man; From head to foot surveyed his person o'er, Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore:— “False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn! Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born, But hewn from hardened entrails of a rock! And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck! Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear? Did he once look, or lent a listening ear, Sighed when I sobbed, or shed one kindly tear? All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind, So foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find. Of man's injustice why should I complain? The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies, Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes; Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies! Justice is fled, and truth is now no more! I saved the shipwrecked exile on my shore; With needful food his hungry Trojans fed; I took the traitor to my throne and bed: Fool that I was—'tis little to repeat The rest—I stored and rigged his ruined fleet. I rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads, And makes heaven accessory to his deeds. Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god, Now Hermes is employed from Jove's abode, To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state Of heavenly powers were touched with human fate! But go! thy flight no longer I detain— Go! seek thy promised kingdom through the main! Yet, if the heavens will hear my pious vow, The faithless waves, not half so false as thou, Or secret sands, shall sepulchres afford To thy proud vessels, and their perjured lord. Then shalt thou call on injured Dido's name: Dido shall come in a black sulphury flame, When death has once dissolved her mortal frame— Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep: Her angry ghost, arising from the deep, Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep. At least my shade thy punishment shall know, And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.” Abruptly here she stops—then turns away Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day. Amazed he stood, revolving in his mind What speech to frame, and what excuse to find. Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led, And softly laid her on her ivory bed. But good Æneas, though he much desired To give that pity which her grief required— Though much he mourned, and laboured with his love— Resolved at length, obeys the will of Jove; Reviews his forces: they with early care Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare. The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride, And well-caulked galleys in the harbour ride. Then oaks for oars they felled; or, as they stood, Of its green arms despoiled the growing wood, Studious of flight. The beach is covered o'er With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore: On every side are seen, descending down, Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town. Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants, Fearful of winter, and of future wants, To invade the corn, and to their cells convey The plundered forage of their yellow prey. The sable troops, along the narrow tracks, Scarce bear the weighty burden on their backs: Some set their shoulders to the ponderous grain; Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train; All ply their several tasks, and equal toil sustain. What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore, When, from the tower, she saw the covered shore, And heard the shouts of sailors from afar, Mixed with the murmurs of the watery war! All-powerful Love! what changes canst thou cause In human hearts, subjected to thy laws! Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends: To prayers and mean submissions she descends. No female arts or aids she left untried, Nor counsels unexplored, before she died. “Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea; They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh. The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind, Invoke the sea-gods, and invite the wind. Could I have thought this threatening blow so near, My tender soul had been forewarned to bear. But do not you my last request deny; With yon perfidious man your interest try, And bring me news, if I must live or die. You are his favourite; you alone can find The dark recesses of his inmost mind: In all his trusted secrets you have part, And know the soft approaches to his heart. Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe; Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go, Nor did my fleet against his friends employ, Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy, Nor moved with hands profane his father's dust: Why should he then reject a suit so just? Whom does he shun? and whither would he fly? Can he this last, this only prayer deny? Let him at least his dangerous flight delay, Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea. The nuptials he disclaims, I urge no more: Let him pursue the promised Latian shore. A short delay is all I ask him now— A pause of grief, an interval from woe, Till my soft soul be tempered to sustain Accustomed sorrows, and inured to pain. If you in pity grant this one request, My death shall glut the hatred of his breast.” This mournful message pious Anna bears, And seconds, with her own, her sister's tears: But all her arts are still employed in vain; Again she comes, and is refused again. His hardened heart nor prayers nor threatenings move; Fate, and the god, had stopped his ears to love. As, when the winds their airy quarrel try, Jostling from every quarter of the sky, This way and that the mountain oak they bend, His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend; With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground; The hollow valleys echo to the sound: Unmoved, the royal plant their fury mocks, Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks; Far as he shoots his towering head on high, So deep in earth his fixed foundations lie.— No less a storm the Trojan hero bears; Thick messages and loud complaints he hears, And bandied words, still beating on his ears. Sighs, groans, and tears, proclaim his inward pains; But the firm purpose of his heart remains. The wretched queen, pursued by cruel Fate, Begins at length the light of heaven to hate, And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees, To hasten on the death her soul decrees— Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine, She pours in sacrifice the purple wine, The purple wine is turned to putrid blood, And the white offered milk converts to mud. This dire presage, to her alone revealed, From all, and even her sister, she concealed. A marble temple stood within the grove, Sacred to death, and to her murdered love; That honoured chapel she had hung around With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crowned: Oft, when she visited this lonely dome, Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb: She thought she heard him summon her away, Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay. Hourly 'tis heard, when with a boding note The solitary screech-owl strains her throat, And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height, With songs obscene, disturbs the silence of the night. Besides, old prophecies augment her fears; And stern Æneas in her dreams appears, Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone, To wander in her sleep, through ways unknown, Guideless and dark; or, in a desert plain, To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain— Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear, He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear; Or mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost Full in his face infernal torches tossed, And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight, Flies o'er the stage, surprised with mortal fright; The Furies guard the door, and intercept his flight. Now, sinking underneath a load of grief, From death alone she seeks her last relief; The time and means resolved within her breast, She to her mournful sister thus addressed:— (Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears, And a false vigour in her eyes appears) “Rejoice!” she said. “Instructed from above, My lover I shall gain, or lose my love. Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun, Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run: There a Massylian priestess I have found, Honoured for age, for magic arts renowned: The Hesperian temple was her trusted care; 'Twas she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare. She poppy-seeds in honey taught to steep, Reclaimed his rage, and soothed him into sleep: She watched the golden fruit. Her charms unbind The chains of love, or fix them on the mind; She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry, Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky. The yawning earth rebellows to her call, Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall. Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part, How loth I am to try this impious art! Within the secret court, with silent care, Erect a lofty pile, exposed in air: Hang, on the topmost part, the Trojan vest, Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest. Next, under these, the bridal bed be placed, Where I my ruin in his arms embraced. All relics of the wretch are doomed to fire; For so the priestess and her charms require.” Thus far she said, and further speech forbears. A mortal paleness in her face appears: Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find The secret funeral, in these rites designed; Nor thought so dire a rage possessed her mind. Unknowing of a train concealed so well, She feared no worse than when Sichæus fell; Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear, Within the secret court, exposed in air. The cloven holms and pines are heaped on high, And garlands on the hollow spaces lie. Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath, And every baleful green denoting death. The queen, determined to the fatal deed, The spoils and sword he left, in order spread, And the man's image on the nuptial bed. And now (the sacred altars placed around) The priestess enters, with her hair unbound, And thrice invokes the power below the ground. Night, Erebus, and Chaos, she proclaims, And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names, And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round, With feigned Avernian drops, the hallowed ground; Culls hoary simples, found by Phœbe's light, With brazen sickles reaped at noon of night; Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl, And cuts the forehead of a new-born foal, Robbing the mother's love.—The destined queen Observes, assisting at the rites obscene: A leavened cake in her devoted hands She holds, and next the highest altar stands: One tender foot was shod, her other bare, Girt was her gathered gown, and loose her hair. Thus dressed, she summoned, with her dying breath, The heavens and planets conscious of her death, And every power, if any rules above, Who minds, or who revenges, injured love. 'Twas dead of night, when weary bodies close Their eyes in balmy sleep, and soft repose: The winds no longer whisper through the woods, Nor murmuring tides disturb the gentle floods. The stars in silent order moved around; And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground. The flocks and herds, and party-coloured fowl, Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool, Stretched on the quiet earth, securely lay, Forgetting the past labours of the day. All else of nature's common gift partake: Unhappy Dido was alone awake. Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find; Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind. Despair, and rage, and love, divide her heart; Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part. Then thus she said within her secret mind:— “What shall I do? what succour can I find? Become a suppliant to Iarbas' pride, And take my turn to court, and be denied? Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go, Forsake an empire, and attend a foe? Himself I refuged, and his train relieved— 'Tis true—but am I sure to be received? Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place? Laomedon still lives in all his race! Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew, Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue? What force have I but those, whom scarce before I drew reluctant from their native shore? Will they again embark at my desire, Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre? Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade, And take the fortune thou thyself hast made. Your pity, sister, first seduced my mind, Or seconded too well what I designed. These dear-bought pleasures had I never known, Had I continued free, and still my own— Avoiding love, I had not found despair, But shared with savage beasts the common air. Like them, a lonely life I might have led, Not mourned the living, nor disturbed the dead.” These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast.— On board, the Trojan found more easy rest. Resolved to sail, in sleep he passed the night; And ordered all things for his early flight. To whom once more the winged god appears; His former youthful mien and shape he wears, And with this new alarm invades his ears:— “Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born? and canst thou drown Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town, Beset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails? She harbours in her heart a furious hate, And thou shalt find the dire effects too late; Fixed on revenge, and obstinate to die. Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast power to fly. The sea with ships will soon be covered o'er, And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore. Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies, And sail before the purple morn arise. Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring? Woman's a various and a changeful thing.”— Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight Aloft in air unseen, and mixed with night. Twice warned by the celestial messenger, The pious prince arose with hasty fear; Then roused his drowsy train without delay: “Haste to your banks! your crooked anchors weigh, And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea! A god commands: he stood before my sight, And urged us once again to speedy flight. O sacred power! what power soe'er thou art, To thy blessed orders I resign my heart. Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands, And prosper the design thy will commands.”— He said; and, drawing forth his flaming sword, His thundering arm divides the many-twisted cord. An emulating zeal inspires his train: They run; they snatch; they rush into the main. With headlong haste they leave the desert shores, And brush the liquid seas with labouring oars. Aurora now had left her saffron bed, And beams of early light the heavens o'erspread, When, from a tower, the queen, with wakeful eyes, Saw day point upward from the rosy skies. She looked to seaward; but the sea was void, And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried. Stung with despite, and furious with despair, She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair. “And shall the ungrateful traitor go” (she said), “My land forsaken, and my love betrayed? Shall we not arm? not rush from every street, To follow, sink, and burn, his perjured fleet? Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe! Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!— What have I said? where am I? Fury turns My brain; and my distempered bosom burns. Then, when I gave my person and my throne, This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown. See now the promised faith, the vaunted name, The pious man, who, rushing through the flame, Preserved his gods, and to the Phrygian shore The burden of his feeble father bore! I should have torn him piece-meal—strewed in floods His scattered limbs, or left exposed in woods— Destroyed his friends, and son; and, from the fire, Have set the reeking boy before the sire. Events are doubtful, which on battle wait: Yet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate? My Tyrians, at their injured queen's command, Had tossed their fires amid the Trojan band; At once extinguished all the faithless name; And I myself, in vengeance of my shame, Had fallen upon the pile, to mend the funeral flame. Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world below! Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow! Thou Hecate, hearken from thy dark abodes! Ye Furies, Fiends, and violated Gods! All powers invoked with Dido's dying breath, Attend her curses and avenge her death! If so the Fates ordain, and Jove commands, The ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands, Yet let a race untamed, and haughty foes, His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose: Oppressed with numbers in the unequal field, His men discouraged, and himself expelled, Let him for succour sue from place to place, Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace. First, let him see his friends in battle slain, And their untimely fate lament in vain: And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease, On hard conditions may he buy his peace: Nor let him then enjoy supreme command; But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand, And lie unburied on the barren sand! These are my prayers, and this my dying will; And you, my Tyrians, every curse fulfil. Perpetual hate, and mortal wars proclaim, Against the prince, the people, and the name. These grateful offerings on my grave bestow; Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know! Now, and from hence, in every future age, When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage, Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood, With fire and sword pursue the perjured brood; Our arms, our seas, our shores, opposed to theirs; And the same hate descend on all our heirs!” This said, within her anxious mind she weighs The means of cutting short her odious days. Then to Sichæus' nurse she briefly said (For, when she left her country, hers was dead), “Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare The sheep, and all the atoning offerings, bring; Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring With living drops; then let her come, and thou With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow. Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove, And end the cares of my disastrous love; Then cast the Trojan image on the fire, And, as that burns, my passion shall expire.” The nurse moves onward with officious care, And all the speed her aged limbs can bear. But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involved, Shook at the mighty mischief she resolved. With livid spots distinguished was her face; Red were her rolling eyes, and discomposed her pace; Ghastly she gazed, with pain she drew her breath, And nature shivered at approaching death. Then swiftly to the fatal place she passed, And mounts the funeral pile with furious haste; Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind (Not for so dire an enterprise designed). But when she viewed the garments loosely spread, Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed, She paused, and, with a sigh, the robes embraced, Then on the couch her trembling body cast, Repressed the ready tears, and spoke her last:— “Dear pledges of my love, while heaven so pleased, Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eased. My fatal course is finished; and I go, A glorious name, among the ghosts below. A lofty city by my hands is raised; Pygmalion punished, and my lord appeased. What could my fortune have afforded more, Had the false Trojan never touched my shore?” Then kissed the couch; and “Must I die,” she said, “And unrevenged? 'tis doubly to be dead! Yet even this death with pleasure I receive: On any terms, 'tis better than to live. This is certainly the sense of Virgil, on which I have paraphrased, to make it plain. His words are these— — Moriemur inultæ? Sed moriamur, ait; sic, sic juvat ire sub umbras. Servius makes an interrogation at the word sic; thus sic? Sic juvat ire sub umbras; which Mr. Cowley justly censures: but his own judgment may perhaps be questioned; for he would retrench the latter part of the verse, and leave it a hemistich,—Sed moriamur, ait. That Virgil never intended to have left any hemistich, I have proved already in the preface. That this verse was filled up by him with these words, sic, sic juvat ire sub umbras, is very probable, if we consider the weight of them; for this procedure of Dido does not only contain that dira execratio, quæ nullo expiatur carmine (as Horace observes in his “Canidia”), but, besides that, Virgil, who is full of allusions to history, under another name describes the Decii devoting themselves to death this way, though in a better cause, in order to the destruction of the enemy. The reader, who will take the pains to consult Livy in his accurate description of those Decii thus devoting themselves, will find a great resemblance betwixt these two passages. And it is judiciously observed upon that verse, Nulla fides populis nec fœdera sunto, that Virgil uses, in the word sunto, a verbum juris, a form of speaking on solemn and religious occasions. Livy does the like. Note also, that Dido puts herself into the habitus Gabinus, which was the girding herself round with one sleeve of her vest; which is also according to the Roman pontifical in this dreadful ceremony, as Livy has observed; which is a further confirmation of this conjecture. So that, upon the whole matter, Dido only doubts whether she should die before she had taken her revenge, which she rather wished; but, considering that this devoting herself was the most certain and infallible way of compassing her vengeance, she thus exclaims: — Sic, sic juvat ire sub umbras! Hauriat hunc oculis ignem crudelis ab alto Dardanus, et nostræ secum ferat omina mortis? Those flames from far may the false Trojan view; Those boding omens his base flight pursue! which translation I take to be according to the sense of Virgil. I should have added a note on that former verse, Infelix Dido! nunc te fata impia tangunt— which, in the edition of Heinsius, is thus printed, nunc te facta impia tangunt? The word facta, instead of fata, is reasonably altered; for Virgil says afterwards, she died not by fate, nor by any deserved death, nec fato, meritâ nec morte, peribat, etc. When I translated that passage, I doubted of the sense, and therefore omitted that hemistich, nunc te fata impia tangunt. But Heinsius is mistaken only in making an interrogation-point instead of a period. The words facta impia, I suppose, are genuine; for she had perjured herself in her second marriage, having firmly resolved, as she told her sister in the beginning of this Æneïd, never to love again, after the death of her first husband; and had confirmed this resolution by a curse on herself, if she should alter it— Sed mihi vel tellus, optem, prius ima dehiscat, etc. Ante, pudor, quam te violem, aut tua jura resolvam. Ille meos, primus qui me sibi junxit, amores Abstulit: ille habeat secum, servetque sepulcro. These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view; These boding omens his base flight pursue!” She said, and struck; deep entered in her side The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed: Clogged in the wound the cruel weapon stands; The spouting blood came streaming on her hands. Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke, And with loud cries the sounding palace shook. Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled, And through the town the dismal rumour spread. First, from the frighted court the yell began; Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran: The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies. Not less the clamour, than if—ancient Tyre, Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire— The rolling ruin, with their loved abodes, Involved the blazing temples of their gods. Her sister hears; and, furious with despair, She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair, And, calling on Eliza's name aloud, Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd. “Was all that pomp of woe for this prepared, These fires, this funeral pile, these altars reared? Was all this train of plots contrived” (said she), “All only to deceive unhappy me? Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend? Thy summoned sister, and thy friend, had come; One sword had served us both, one common tomb: Was I to raise the pile, the powers invoke, Not to be present at the fatal stroke? At once thou hast destroyed thyself and me, Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony! Bring water! bathe the wound; while I in death Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath.” This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste, And in her arms the gasping queen embraced; Her temples chafed; and her own garments tore, To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore. Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head, And, fainting, thrice fell grovelling on the bed; Thrice oped her heavy eyes, and sought the light, But, having found it, sickened at the sight, And closed her lids at last in endless night. Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain A death so lingering, and so full of pain, Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife Of labouring nature, and dissolve her life. For, since she died, not doomed by heaven's decree, Or her own crime, but human casualty, And rage of love, that plunged her in despair, The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair, Which Proserpine and they can only know; Nor made her sacred to the shades below.— Downward the various goddess took her flight, And drew a thousand colours from the light; Then stood above the dying lover's head, And said, “I thus devote thee to the dead. This offering to the infernal gods I bear.” Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair: The struggling soul was loosed, and life dissolved in air. BOOK V. ARGUMENT. Æneas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a storm on the coast of Sicily, where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of part of the island, and born of Trojan parentage. He applies himself to celebrate the memory of his father with divine honours, and accordingly institutes funeral games, and appoints prizes for those who should conquer in them. While the ceremonies were performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan women to burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them; which burned four, and would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter, by a miraculous shower, extinguished it. Upon this, Æneas, by the advice of one of his generals, and a vision of his father, builds a city for the women, old men, and others, who were either unfit for war, or weary of the voyage, and sails for Italy. Venus procures of Neptune a safe voyage for him and all his men, excepting only his pilot Palinurus, who was unfortunately lost. A great part of this book is borrowed from Apollonius Rhodius; and the reader may observe the great judgment and distinction of our author, in what he borrows from the ancients, by comparing them. I conceive the reason why he omits the horse-race in the funeral games, was, because he shows Ascanius afterwards on horseback, with his troops of boys, and would not wear that subject thread-bare, which Statius, in the next age, described so happily. Virgil seems, to me, to have excelled Homer in those sports, and to have laboured them the more in honour of Octavius, his patron, who instituted the like games for perpetuating the memory of his uncle Julius: piety, as Virgil calls it, or dutifulness to parents, being a most popular virtue among the Romans. Meantime the Trojan cuts his watery way, Fixed on his voyage, through the curling sea; Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze. The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind The fate of Dido from the fire divined; He knew the stormy souls of woman-kind, What secret springs their eager passions move, How capable of death for injured love. Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw; Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw. Now seas and skies their prospect only bound— An empty space above, a floating field around. But soon the heavens with shadows were o'erspread; A swelling cloud hung hovering o'er their head: Livid it looked—the threatening of a storm: Then night and horror ocean's face deform. The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud,— “What gusts of weather from that gathering cloud My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars, Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars; Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.” The frighted crew perform the task assigned. Then, to his fearless chief,—“Not heaven” (said he), “Though Jove himself should promise Italy, Can stem the torrent of this raging sea. Mark, how the shifting winds from west arise, And what collected night involves the skies! Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea, Much less against the tempest force their way. 'Tis Fate diverts our course, and Fate we must obey. Not far from hence, if I observed aright The southing of the stars, and polar light, Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores In safety we may reach with struggling oars.” Æneas then replied:—“Too sure I find, We strive in vain against the seas and wind: Now shift your sails; what place can please me more Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore, Whose hallowed earth Anchises' bones contains, And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?” The course resolved, before the western wind They scud amain, and make the port assigned. Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, Beheld the fleet descending on the land; And, not unmindful of his ancient race, Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, And held the hero in a strict embrace. Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, And either hand a pointed javelin bore. His mother was a dame of Dardan blood; His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood. He welcomes his returning friends ashore With plenteous country cates, and homely store. Now, when the following morn had chased away The flying stars, and light restored the day, Æneas called the Trojan troops around, And thus bespoke them from a rising ground:— “Offspring of heaven, divine Dardanian race! The sun, revolving through the ethereal space, The shining circle of the year has filled, Since first this isle my father's ashes held: And now the rising day renews the year— A day for ever sad, for ever dear. This would I celebrate with annual games, With gifts on altars piled, and holy flames, Though banished to Gætulia's barren sands, Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands: But since this happy storm our fleet has driven (Not, as I deem, without the will of heaven) Upon these friendly shores, and flowery plains, Which hide Anchises and his blest remains, Let us with joy perform his honours due, And pray for prosperous winds, our voyage to renew— Pray, that, in towns and temples of our own, The name of great Anchises may be known, And yearly games may spread the god's renown. Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race, With royal gifts ordained, is pleased to grace: Two steers on every ship the king bestows: His gods and ours shall share your equal vows. Besides, if nine days hence, the rosy morn Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn, That day with solemn sports I mean to grace: Light galleys on the seas shall run a watery race: Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend, And others try the twanging bow to bend: The strong, with iron gauntlets armed, shall stand Opposed in combat on the yellow sand. Let all be present at the games prepared, And joyful victors wait the just reward. But now assist the rites, with garlands crowned.” He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound. Then Helymus, by his example led, And old Acestes, each adorned his head; Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, His temples tied, and all the Trojan race. Æneas then advanced amidst the train, By thousands followed through the fruitful plain, To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found, He poured to Bacchus, on the hallowed ground, Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more, And two (from offered bulls) of purple gore. With roses then the sepulchre he strow'd, And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:— “Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again, Paternal ashes, now reviewed in vain! The gods permitted not, that you, with me, Should reach the promised shores of Italy, Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be.” Scarce had he finished, when, with speckled pride, A serpent from the tomb began to glide; His hugy bulk on seven high volumes rolled; Blue was his breadth of back, but streaked with scaly gold: Thus riding on his curls, he seemed to pass A rolling fire along, and singe the grass. More various colours through his body run, Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun. Betwixt the rising altars, and around, The sacred monster shot along the ground; With harmless play amidst the bowls he passed, And with his lolling tongue assayed the taste: Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest Within the hollow tomb retired to rest. The pious prince, surprised at what he viewed, The funeral honours with more zeal renewed, Doubtful if this the place's genius were, Or guardian of his father's sepulchre. Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew; As many swine, and steers of sable hue; New generous wine he from the goblets poured, And called his father's ghost, from hell restored. The glad attendants in long order come, Offering their gifts at great Anchises' tomb: Some add more oxen; some divide the spoil; Some place the chargers on the grassy soil; Some blow the fires, and offered entrails broil. Now came the day desired. The skies were bright With rosy lustre of the rising light: The bordering people, roused by sounding fame Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name, The crowded shore with acclamations fill, Part to behold, and part to prove their skill. And first the gifts in public view they place, Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace: Within the circle, arms and tripods lie, Ingots of gold and silver heaped on high, And vests embroidered, of the Tyrian dye. The trumpet's clangour then the feast proclaims, And all prepare for their appointed games. Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear, Advancing, in the watery lists appear. The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind, Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind: Gyas the vast Chimæra's bulk commands, Which rising like a towering city stands: Three Trojans tug at every labouring oar; Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore; Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar. Sergestus, who began the Sergian race, In the great Centaur took the leading place: Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood, From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood. Far in the sea, against the foaming shore, There stands a rock: the raging billows roar Above his head in storms; but, when 'tis clear, Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear. In peace below the gentle waters run; The cormorants above lie basking in the sun. On this the hero fixed an oak in sight, The mark to guide the mariners aright. To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars; Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores. The lots decide their place. Above the rest, Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest; The common crew, with wreaths of poplar boughs, Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows: Besmeared with oil, their naked shoulders shine. All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign: They gripe their oars; and every panting breast Is raised by turns with hope, by turns with fear depressed. The clangour of the trumpet gives the sign; At once they start, advancing in a line: With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies; Lashed with their oars, the smoky billows rise; Sparkles the briny main, and the vexed ocean fries. Exact in time, with equal strokes they row: At once the brushing oars and brazen prow Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below. Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race, Invade the field with half so swift a pace: Not the fierce driver with more fury lends The sounding lash, and ere the stroke descends, Low to the wheels his pliant body bends. The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide, And aid, with eager shouts, the favoured side. Cries, murmurs, clamours, with a mixing sound, From woods to woods, from hills to hills, rebound. Amidst the loud applauses of the shore, Gyas outstripped the rest, and sprung before: Cloanthus, better manned, pursued him fast, But his o'er-masted galley checked his haste. The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine With equal oars, advancing in a line; And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead, And now the speedy Dolphin gets a-head; Now board to board the rival vessels row, The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below. They reached the mark. Proud Gyas and his train In triumph rode, the victors of the main; But, steering round, he charged his pilot stand More close to shore, and skim along the sand;— “Let others bear to sea!”—Menœtes heard; But secret shelves too cautiously he feared, And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steered. With louder cries the captain called again:— “Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main.” He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw. Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood, And in a closer compass ploughed the flood. He passed the mark; and, wheeling, got before:— Gyas blasphemed the gods, devoutly swore, Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore. Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown His rising rage), and careless of his own, The trembling dotard to the deck he drew, And hoisted up, and overboard he threw: This done, he seized the helm; his fellows cheered, Turned short upon the shelves, and madly steered. Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears, Clogged with his clothes, and cumbered with his years: Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain. The crowd, that saw him fall and float again, Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laught, To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught. The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew, Their vanished hopes of victory renew; While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race, To reach the mark. Sergestus takes the place; Mnestheus pursues; and, while around they wind, Comes up, not half his galley's length behind; Then on the deck, amidst his mates, appeared, And thus their drooping courages he cheered:— “My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore, Exert your vigour; tug the labouring oar; Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquered crew, Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew. In this our common interest, let me find That strength of hand, that courage of the mind, As when you stemmed the strong Malean flood, And o'er the Syrtes' broken billows rowed. I seek not now the foremost palm to gain; Though yet—but, ah! that haughty wish is vain! Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain. But to be last, the lags of all the race!— Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace.” Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow. The sea beneath them sinks; their labouring sides Are swelled, and sweat runs guttering down in tides. Chance aids their daring with unhoped success: Sergestus, eager with his beak to press Betwixt the rival galley and the rock, Shuts up the unwieldy Centaur in the lock. The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock, Her oars she shivered, and her head she broke. The trembling rowers from their banks arise, And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize. With iron poles they heave her off the shores, And gather from the sea their floating oars. The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds, Urge their success, and call the willing winds, Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way In larger compass on the roomy sea. As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes, Roused in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes; The cavern rings with clattering; out she flies, And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies: At first she flutters; but at length she springs To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings: So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea; And, flying with a force, that force assists his way. Sergestus in the Centaur soon he passed, Wedged in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast. In vain the victor he with cries implores, And practises to row with shattered oars. Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies: The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize. Unvanquished Scylla now alone remains; Her he pursues, and all his vigour strains. Shouts from the favouring multitude arise; Applauding Echo to the shouts replies; Shouts, wishes, and applause, run rattling through the skies. These clamours with disdain the Scylla heard, Much grudged the praise, but more the robbed reward: Resolved to hold their own, they mend their pace, All obstinate to die, or gain the race. Raised with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran; For they can conquer, who believe they can. Both urge their oars, and Fortune both supplies, And both perhaps had shared an equal prize; When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands, And succour from the watery powers demands:— “Gods of the liquid realms on which I row! If, given by you, the laurel bind my brow, (Assist to make me guilty of my vow!) A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain; His offered entrails cast into the main, And ruddy wine from golden goblets thrown, Your grateful gift and my return shall own.” The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below, With virgin Panopea, heard his vow; And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand, Pushed on, and sped the galley to the land. Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies, And, darting to the port, obtains the prize. The herald summons all, and then proclaims Cloanthus conqueror of the naval games. The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head, And three fat steers are to his vessel led, The ship's reward; with generous wine beside, And sums of silver, which the crew divide. The leaders are distinguished from the rest; The victor honoured with a nobler vest, Where gold and purple strive in equal rows, And needle-work its happy cost bestows. There, Ganymede is wrought with living art, Chasing through Ida's groves the trembling hart: Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue; When from aloft descends, in open view, The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey, With crooked talons bears the boy away. In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes, His guards behold him soaring through the skies, And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries. Mnestheus the second victor was declared; And, summoned there, the second prize he shared— A coat of mail, which brave Demoleus bore, More brave Æneas from his shoulders tore, In single combat on the Trojan shore. This was ordained for Mnestheus to possess— In war for his defence, for ornament in peace. Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold, But yet so ponderous with its plates of gold, That scarce two servants could the weight sustain; Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain Pursued, and lightly seized, the Trojan train. The third, succeeding to the last reward, Two goodly bowls of massy silver shared, With figures prominent, and richly wrought, And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought. Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands, Their conquering temples bound with purple bands, And now Sergestus, clearing from the rock, Brought back his galley shattered with the shock. Forlorn she looked, without an aiding oar, And, hooted by the vulgar, made to shore; As when a snake, surprised upon the road, Is crushed athwart her body by the load Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound Her belly bruised, and trodden to the ground— In vain, with loosened curls, she crawls along; Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue; Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales; But, grovelling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails. So slowly to the port the Centaur tends, But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends. Yet, for his galley saved, the grateful prince Is pleased the unhappy chief to recompense. Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care, Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair. From thence his way the Trojan hero bent Into the neighbouring plain, with mountains pent, Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. Full in the midst of this fair valley, stood A native theatre, which, rising slow By just degrees, o'erlooked the ground below. High on a sylvan throne the leader sate; A numerous train attend in solemn state. Here those, that in the rapid course delight, Desire of honour, and the prize, invite. The rival runners without order stand; The Trojans, mixed with the Sicilian band. First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears— Euryalus a boy of blooming years, With sprightly grace and equal beauty crowned— Nisus, for friendship to the youth, renowned. Diores next, of Priam's royal race, Then Salius, joined with Patron, took their place (But Patron in Arcadia had his birth, And Salius, his from Acarnanian earth); Then two Sicilian youths—the names of these, Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes (Both jolly huntsmen, both in forests bred, And owning old Acestes for their head), With several others of ignobler name, Whom time has not delivered o'er to fame. To these the hero thus his thoughts explained, In words which general approbation gained:— “One common largess is for all designed (The vanquished and the victor shall be joined), Two darts of polished steel and Gnossian wood, A silver-studded axe, alike bestowed. The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed: The first of these obtains a stately steed Adorned with trappings; and the next in fame, The quiver of an Amazonian dame, With feathered Thracian arrows well supplied: A golden belt shall gird his manly side, Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied. The third this Grecian helmet shall content.” He said. To their appointed base they went; With beating hearts the expected sign receive, And, starting all at once, the barrier leave. Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew, And seized the distant goal with greedy view. Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'er-passed; Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste. The next, but, though the next, yet far disjoined, Came Salius, and Euryalus behind; Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied, Step after step, and almost side by side, His shoulders pressing—and, in longer space, Had won, or left at least a dubious race. Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last, When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste, Slipped first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain, Soaked with the blood of oxen newly slain. The careless victor had not marked his way; But, treading where the treacherous puddle lay, His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor He fell, besmeared with filth and holy gore. Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee, Nor of the sacred bonds of amity, He strove the immediate rival's hope to cross, And caught the foot of Salius as he rose: So Salius lay extended on the plain: Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain, And leaves the crowd:—applauding peals attend The victor to the goal, who vanquished by his friend. Next Helymus; and then Diores came, By two misfortunes made the third in fame. But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd; Urges his cause may in the court be heard; And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferred. But favour for Euryalus appears; His blooming beauty, with his tender years, Had bribed the judges for the promised prize; Besides, Diores fills the court with cries, Who vainly reaches at the last reward, If the first palm on Salius be conferred. Then thus the prince: “Let no disputes arise: Where Fortune placed it, I award the prize. But Fortune's errors give me leave to mend, At least to pity my deserving friend.” He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws (Ponderous with shaggy mane and golden paws) A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives: Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves. “If such rewards to vanquished men are due” (He said) “and falling is to rise by you, What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim Who merited the first rewards and fame? In falling, both an equal fortune tried; Would Fortune for my fall so well provide!” With this he pointed to his face, and showed His hands and all his habit smeared with blood. The indulgent father of the people smiled, And caused to be produced an ample shield, Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought, Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought. This given to Nisus, he divides the rest, And equal justice in his gifts expressed. The race thus ended, and rewards bestowed, Once more the prince bespeaks the attentive crowd:— “If there be here, whose dauntless courage dare In gauntlet fight, with limbs and body bare, His opposite sustain in open view, Stand forth the champion, and the games renew. Two prizes I propose, and thus divide— A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied, Shall be the portion of the conquering chief: A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief.” Then haughty Dares in the lists appears; Stalking he strides, his head erected bears: His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield, And loud applauses echo through the field. Dares alone in combat used to stand The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand; The same, at Hector's funerals, undertook Gigantic Butes, of the Amycian stock, And, by the stroke of his resistless hand, Stretched the vast bulk upon the yellow sand. Such Dares was; and such he strode along, And drew the wonder of the gazing throng. His brawny back and ample breast he shows; His lifted arms around his head he throws, And deals, in whistling air, his empty blows. His match is sought: but, through the trembling band, Not one dares answer to the proud demand. Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes Already he devours the promised prize. He claims the bull with awless insolence, And, having seized his horns, accosts the prince:— “If none my matchless valour dares oppose, How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes? Permit me, chief, permit, without delay, To lead this uncontended gift away.” The crowd assents, and, with redoubled cries, For the proud challenger demands the prize. Acestes, fired with just disdain, to see The palm usurped without a victory, Reproached Entellus thus, who sate beside, And heard and saw, unmoved, the Trojan's pride:— “Once, but in vain, a champion of renown, So tamely can you bear the ravished crown, A prize in triumph borne before your sight, And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight? Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name, The god, who taught your thundering arm the game? Where now your baffled honour? where the spoil That filled your house, and fame that filled our isle?” Entellus, thus:—“My soul is still the same, Unmoved with fear, and moved with martial fame; But my chill blood is curdled in my veins, And scarce the shadow of a man remains. Oh! could I turn to that fair prime again, That prime, of which this boaster is so vain, The brave, who this decrepit age defies, Should feel my force, without the promised prize.” He said; and, rising at the word, he threw Two ponderous gauntlets down in open view— Gauntlets, which Eryx wont in fight to wield, And sheathe his hands with, in the listed field. With fear and wonder seized, the crowd beholds The gloves of death, with seven distinguished folds Of tough bull-hides; the space within is spread With iron, or with loads of heavy lead: Dares himself was daunted at the sight, Renounced his challenge, and refused to fight. Astonished at their weight, the hero stands, And poised the ponderous engines in his hands. “What had your wonder” (said Entellus) “been, Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen, Or viewed the stern debate on this unhappy green! These, which I bear, your brother Eryx bore, Still marked with battered brains and mingled gore. With these he long sustained the Herculean arm; And these I wielded while my blood was warm, This languished frame while better spirits fed, Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnowed my head. But, if the challenger these arms refuse, And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use; If great Æneas and Acestes join In his request, these gauntlets I resign; Let us with equal arms perform the fight, And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right.” This said, Entellus for the strife prepares; Stripped of his quilted coat, his body bares; Composed of mighty bones and brawn, he stands, A goodly towering object on the sands. Then just Æneas equal arms supplied, Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied. Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent, Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent; Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar; With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war. One on his youth and pliant limbs relies; One on his sinews, and his giant size. The last is stiff with age, his motion slow; He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro, And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow. Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike; Their ways are different, but their art alike. Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound. A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies, And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes— Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws. Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground, But with his warping body wards the wound. His hand and watchful eye keep even pace; While Dares traverses, and shifts his place, And, like a captain who beleaguers round Some strong-built castle on a rising ground, Views all the approaches with observing eyes; This and that other part in vain he tries, And more on industry than force relies. With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe; But Dares watched the motion from below, And slipped aside, and shunned the long descending blow. Entellus wastes his forces on the wind, And, thus deluded of the stroke designed, Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast, And weighty limbs, his ancient mother pressed. So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood, Torn from the roots. The differing nations rise; And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies. Acestes runs with eager haste, to raise The fallen companion of his youthful days. Dauntless he rose, and to the fight returned; With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burned. Disdain and conscious virtue fired his breast, And with redoubled force his foe he pressed. He lays on load with either hand, amain, And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain; Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows; But storms of strokes descend about his brows, A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows. But now the prince, who saw the wild increase Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease, And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace. First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came, And soothed his sorrow for the suffered shame. “What fury seized my friend? The gods” (said he) “To him propitious, and averse to thee, Have given his arm superior force to thine. 'Tis madness to contend with strength divine.” The gauntlet-fight thus ended, from the shore His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore: His mouth and nostrils poured a purple flood, And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood. Faintly he staggered through the hissing throng, And hung his head, and trailed his legs along. The sword and casque are carried by his train; But with his foe the palm and ox remain. The champion, then, before Æneas came, Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame; “O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host, Mark with attention, and forgive my boast; Learn what I was, by what remains; and know, From what impending fate you saved my foe.” Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull; And, on his ample forehead aiming full, The deadly stroke, descending, pierced the skull. Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound, But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground. Then, thus:—“In Dares's stead I offer this. Eryx! accept a nobler sacrifice: Take the last gift my withered arms can yield: The gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field.” This done, Æneas orders, for the close, The strife of archers, with contending bows. The mast, Sergestus' shattered galley bore, With his own hands he raises on the shore. A fluttering dove upon the top they tie, The living mark at which their arrows fly. The rival archers in a line advance, Their turn of shooting to receive from chance. A helmet holds their names: the lots are drawn; On the first scroll was read Hippocoon: The people shout. Upon the next was found Young Mnestheus, late with naval honours crowned. The third contained Eurytion's noble name, Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame, Whom Pallas urged the treaty to confound, And send among the Greeks a feathered wound. Acestes, in the bottom, last remained, Whom not his age from youthful sports restrained. Soon all with vigour bend their trusty bows, And from the quiver each his arrow chose. Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way. Fixed in the mast the feathered weapon stands: The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands, And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries Of the pleased people rend the vaulted skies. Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove, With lifted eyes, and took his aim above, But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove; Yet missed so narrow, that he cut the cord Which fastened, by the foot, the flitting bird. The captive thus released, away she flies, And beats, with clapping wings, the yielding skies. His bow already bent, Eurytion stood; And, having first invoked his brother god, His winged shaft with eager haste he sped. The fatal message reached her as she fled: She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground, And renders back the weapon in the wound. Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains, Without a prize to gratify his pains. Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow. The feathered arrow gave a dire portent, And latter augurs judge from this event. Chafed by the speed, it fired; and, as it flew, A trail of following flames, ascending drew: Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way; Across the skies as falling meteors play, And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay. The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare, And, trembling, turn their wonder into prayer. The Dardan prince put on a smiling face, And strained Acestes with a close embrace; Then honouring him with gifts above the rest, Turned the bad omen, nor his fears confessed. “The gods” (said he) “this miracle have wrought, And ordered you the prize without the lot. Accept this goblet, rough with figured gold, Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old: This pledge of ancient amity receive, Which to my second sire I justly give.” He said, and, with the trumpet's cheerful sound, Proclaimed him victor, and with laurel crowned. Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize, Though he transfixed the pigeon in the skies. Who cut the line, with second gifts was graced; The third was his, whose arrow pierced the mast. The chief, before the games were wholly done, Called Periphantes, tutor to his son, And whispered thus:—“With speed Ascanius find; And, if his childish troop be ready joined, On horseback let him grace his grandsire's day, And lead his equals armed in just array.” He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears. The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears. And now the noble youths, of form divine, Advance before their fathers, in a line: The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine. Thus marching on in military pride, Shouts of applause resound from side to side. Their casques adorned with laurel wreaths they wear, Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear. Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore; Their chains of burnished gold hung down before. Three graceful troops they formed upon the green; Three graceful leaders at their head were seen; Twelve followed every chief, and left a space between. The first young Priam led—a lovely boy, Whose grandsire was the unhappy king of Troy; (His race in after-times was known to fame, New honours adding to the Latian name,) And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became. White were the fetlocks of his feet before, And on his front a snowy star he bore. Then beauteous Atys, with Iülus bred, Of equal age, the second squadron led. The last in order, but the first in place, First in the lovely features of his face, Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed, Queen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed. Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains, With golden bits adorned, and purple reins. The pleased spectators peals of shouts renew, And all the parents in the children view; Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace, And hopes and fears alternate in their face. The unfledged commanders, and their martial train, First make the circuit of the sandy plain Around their sires, and, at the appointed sign, Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line. The second signal sounds, the troop divides In three distinguished parts, with three distinguished guides. Again they close, and once again disjoin: In troop to troop opposed, and line to line. They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar, With harmless rage, and well-dissembled war. Then in a round the mingled bodies run: Flying they follow, and pursuing shun; Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew In other forms the military show. At last, in order undiscerned they join, And march together in a friendly line. And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old, With wandering ways, and many a winding fold, Involved the weary feet, without redress, In a round error, which denied recess; So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play, Turned and returned, and still a different way. Thus dolphins, in the deep, each other chase In circles, when they swim around the watery race. This game, these carousals, Ascanius taught; And, building Alba, to the Latins brought, Showed what he learned: the Latin sires impart To their succeeding sons the graceful art: From these imperial Rome received the game, Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name. Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate: But Fortune soon resumed her ancient hate; For, while they pay the dead his annual dues, Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views; And sends the goddess of the various bow, To try new methods of revenge below; Supplies the winds to wing her airy way, Where in the port secure the navy lay. Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends, And, undiscerned, her fatal voyage ends. She saw the gathering crowd; and, gliding thence, The desert shore, and fleet without defence. The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone, With sighs and tears Anchises' death bemoan: Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes, Their pity to themselves renews their cries. “Alas!” said one, “what oceans yet remain For us to sail! what labours to sustain!” All take the word, and, with a general groan, Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own. The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains, And in a woman's form her heavenly limbs restrains. In face and shape, old Beroë she became, Doryclus' wife, a venerable dame, Once blessed with riches, and a mother's name. Thus changed, amidst the crying crowd she ran, Mixed with the matrons, and these words began:— “O wretched we! whom not the Grecian power, Nor flames, destroyed, in Troy's unhappy hour! O wretched we! reserved by cruel Fate, Beyond the ruins of the sinking state! Now seven revolving years are wholly run, Since this improsperous voyage we begun; Since, tossed from shores to shores, from lands to lands, Inhospitable rocks and barren sands, Wandering in exile, through the stormy sea, We search in vain for flying Italy. Now cast by fortune on this kindred land, What should our rest and rising walls withstand, Or hinder here to fix our banished band? O country lost, and gods redeemed in vain, If still in endless exile we remain! Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew, Or streams of some dissembled Simoïs view? Haste! join with me! the unhappy fleet consume! Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom. In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands (For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands: ‘With these’ (said she), ‘these wandering ships destroy: These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.’ Time calls you now; the precious hour employ: Slack not the good presage, while heaven inspires Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires. See! Neptune's altars minister their brands: The god is pleased; and the god supplies our hands.” Then, from the pile, a flaming fir she drew, And, tossed in air, amidst the galleys threw. Rapt in amaze, the matrons wildly stare: Then Pyrgo, reverenced for her hoary hair, Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam's numerous race, “No Beroë this, though she belies her face! What terrors from her frowning front arise! Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes! What rays around her heavenly face are seen! Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien! Beroë but now I left, whom, pined with pain, Her age and anguish from these rites detain.” She said. The matrons, seized with new amaze, Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze. They fear, and hope, and neither part obey: They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way. The goddess, having done her task below, Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow. Struck with the sight, and seized with rage divine, The matrons prosecute their mad design: They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands, The food of altars; firs and flaming brands, Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste, And smoking torches, on the ships they cast. The flame, unstopped at first, more fury gains, And Vulcan rides at large with loosened reins: Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars, And seizes, in his way, the banks and crackling oars. Eumelus was the first, the news to bear, While yet they crowd the rural theatre. Then, what they hear, is witnessed by their eyes: A storm of sparkles, and of flames, arise. Ascanius took the alarm, while yet he led His early warriors on his prancing steed, And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpassed; Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste. Soon as the royal youth appeared in view, He sent his voice before him as he flew:— “What madness moves you, matrons! to destroy The last remainders of unhappy Troy? Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn, And on your friends your fatal fury turn. Behold your own Ascanius!”—While he said, He drew his glittering helmet from his head, In which the youths to sportful arms he led. By this, Æneas and his train appear; And now the women, seized with shame and fear, Dispersed, to woods and caverns take their flight, Abhor their actions, and avoid the light; Their friends acknowledge, and their error find, And shake the goddess from their altered mind. Not so the raging fires their fury cease, But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace, Work on their way amid the smouldering tow, Sure in destruction, but in motion slow. The silent plague through the green timber eats, And vomits out a tardy flame by fits. Down to the keels, and upward to the sails, The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; Nor buckets poured, nor strength of human hand, Can the victorious element withstand. The pious hero rends his robe, and throws To heaven his hands, and, with his hands, his vows.— “O Jove!” (he cried) “if prayers can yet have place; If thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race; If any spark of pity still remain; If gods are gods, and not invoked in vain; Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train! Yet from the flames our burning vessels free! Or let thy fury fall alone on me. At this devoted head thy thunder throw, And send the willing sacrifice below.” Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise: From pole to pole the forky lightning flies; Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain; Heaven bellies downward, and descends in rain. Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent, Which, hissing through the planks, the flames prevent, And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone. But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide, If he should still in Sicily reside, Forgetful of his fates,—or tempt the main, In hope the promised Italy to gain. Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone The will of heaven by Pallas was foreshown; Versed in portents, experienced, and inspired To tell events, and what the Fates required— Thus while he stood, to neither part inclined, With cheerful words relieved his labouring mind:— “O goddess-born! resigned in every state, With patience bear, with prudence push, your fate. By suffering well, our fortune we subdue; Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue. Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind; To him disclose the secrets of your mind: Trust in his hands your old and useless train; Too numerous for the ships which yet remain— The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease, The dames who dread the dangers of the seas, With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand The shock of battle with your foes by land. Here you may build a common town for all, And, from Acestes' name, Acesta call.” The reasons, with his friend's experience joined, Encouraged much, but more disturbed, his mind. 'Twas dead of night; when, to his slumbering eyes, His father's shade descended from the skies; And thus he spoke:—“O, more than vital breath, Loved while I lived, and dear even after death! O son, in various toils and troubles tossed! The king of heaven employs my careful ghost On his commands—the god, who saved from fire Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire. The wholesome counsel of your friend receive, And here the coward train and women leave: The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare, Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war. The stern Italians will their courage try; Rough are their manners, and their minds are high. But first to Pluto's palace you shall go, And seek my shade among the blest below: For not with impious ghosts my soul remains, Nor suffers, with the damned, perpetual pains, But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains. The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey, And blood of offered victims free the way. There shall you know what realms the gods assign, And learn the fates and fortunes of your line. But now, farewell! I vanish with the night, And feel the blast of heaven's approaching light.” He said, and mixed with shades, and took his airy flight.— “Whither so fast?” the filial duty cried; “And why, ah! why the wished embrace denied?” He said, and rose: as holy zeal inspires, He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires; His country gods and Vesta then adores With cakes and incense, and their aid implores. Next, for his friends and royal host he sent, Revealed his vision, and the god's intent, With his own purpose.—All, without delay, The will of Jove, and his desires, obey. They list with women each degenerate name, Who dares not hazard life for future fame. These they cashier. The brave remaining few, Oars, banks, and cables, half consumed, renew. The prince designs a city with the plough: The lots their several tenements allow, This part is named from Ilium, that from Troy, And the new king ascends the throne with joy; A chosen senate from the people draws; Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws. Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin A rising temple to the Paphian queen. Anchises, last, is honoured as a god: A priest is added, annual gifts bestowed, And groves are planted round his blest abode. Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crowned; And fumes of incense in the fanes abound. Then from the south arose a gentle breeze, That curled the smoothness of the glassy seas: The rising winds a ruffling gale afford, And call the merry mariners aboard. Now loud laments along the shores resound, Of parting friends in close embraces bound. The trembling women, the degenerate train, Who shunned the frightful dangers of the main, Even those desire to sail, and take their share Of the rough passage, and the promised war: Whom good Æneas cheers, and recommends To their new master's care his fearful friends. On Eryx' altars three fat calves he lays; A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas; Then slips his hawsers, and his anchors weighs. High on the deck the godlike hero stands, With olive crowned, a charger in his hands; Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine, And poured the sacrifice of purple wine. Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie, And brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly. Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears, To Neptune thus addressed, with tender tears:— “The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage, The malice, which no sufferings can assuage, Compel me to these prayers; since neither fate, Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate. Even Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife; Still vanquished, yet she still renews the strife. As if 'twere little to consume the town Which awed the world, and wore the imperial crown, She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains, And gnaws, e'en to the bones, the last remains. Let her the causes of her hatred tell; But you can witness its effects too well. You saw the storm she raised on Libyan floods, That mixed the mounting billows with the clouds; When, bribing Æolus, she shook the main, And moved rebellion in your watery reign. With fury she possessed the Dardan dames, To burn their fleet with execrable flames, And forced Æneas, when his ships were lost, To leave his followers on a foreign coast. For what remains, your godhead I implore, And trust my son to your protecting power. If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand, Secure his passage to the Latian land.” Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:— “What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign? My kingdom claims your birth; my late defence Of your endangered fleet may claim your confidence. Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare, How much your loved Æneas is my care. Thee, Xanthus! and thee, Simoïs! I attest— Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles pressed, And drove before him headlong on the plain, And dashed against the walls the trembling train; When floods were filled with bodies of the slain; When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way, Stood up on ridges to behold the sea, New heaps came tumbling in, and choked his way; When your Æneas fought, but fought with odds Of force unequal, and unequal gods; I spread a cloud before the victor's sight, Sustained the vanquished, and secured his flight— Even then secured him, when I sought with joy The vowed destruction of ungrateful Troy. My will's the same: fair goddess! fear no more, Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore; Their lives are given; one destined head alone Shall perish, and for multitudes atone.” Thus having armed with hopes her anxious mind, His finny team Saturnian Neptune joined, Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws, And to the loosened reins permits the laws. High on the waves his azure car he guides; Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides, And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides. The tempests fly before their father's face, Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace, And monster whales before their master play, And choirs of Tritons crowd the watery way. The marshalled powers in equal troops divide To right and left; the gods his better side Inclose; and, on the worse, the Nymphs and Nereids ride. Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude, Within the hero's mind his joys renewed. He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display; The cheerful crew with diligence obey; They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea. Ahead of all the master-pilot steers; And, as he leads, the following navy veers. The steeds of Night had travelled half the sky, The drowsy rowers on their benches lie, When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight, Descends, and draws behind a trail of light. Thou, Palinurus, art his destined prey; To thee alone he takes his fatal way. Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears; And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears. Then thus the traitor god began his tale:— “The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale; The ships, without thy care, securely sail. Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I Will take the rudder, and thy room supply.” To whom the yawning pilot, half-asleep:— “Me dost thou bid to trust the treacherous deep, The harlot-smiles of her dissembling face, And to her faith commit the Trojan race? Shall I believe the Siren South again, And, oft betrayed, not know the monster main?” He said: his fastened hands the rudder keep, And, fixed on heaven, his eyes repel invading sleep. The god was wroth, and at his temples threw A branch in Lethe dipped, and drunk with Stygian dew: The pilot, vanquished by the power divine, Soon closed his swimming eyes, and lay supine. Scarce were his limbs extended at their length, The god, insulting with superior strength, Fell heavy on him, plunged him in the sea, And, with the stern, the rudder tore away. Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main, Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain. The victor Dæmon mounts obscure in air, While the ship sails without the pilot's care. On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies; But what the man forsook, the god supplies, And, o'er the dangerous deep, secure the navy flies; Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast, Long infamous for ships and sailors lost, And white with bones. The impetuous ocean roars, And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores. The watchful hero felt the knocks; and found The tossing vessel sailed on shoaly ground. Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf. Inly he grieved, and, groaning from the breast, Deplored his death; and thus his pain expressed:— “For faith reposed on seas, and on the flattering sky, Thy naked corpse is doomed on shores unknown to lie.” BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. The Sibyl foretells Æneas the adventures he should meet with in Italy. She attends him to hell; describing to him the various scenes of that place, and conducting him to his father Anchises, who instructs him in those sublime mysteries of the soul of the world, and the transmigration; and shows him that glorious race of heroes, which was to descend from him and his posterity. He said, and wept; then spread his sails before The winds, and reached at length the Cuman shore: Their anchors dropped, his crew the vessels moor. They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land, And greet with greedy joy the Italian strand. Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed; Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed, Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods, Or trace through valleys the discovered floods. Thus while their several charges they fulfil, The pious prince ascends the sacred hill Where Phœbus is adored; and seeks the shade, Which hides from sight his venerable maid. Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode; Thence full of Fate returns, and of the god. Through Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold, And enter now, the temple roofed with gold. When Dædalus, to shun the Cretan shore, His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore (The first who sailed in air), 'tis sung by Fame, To the Cumæan coast at length he came, And, here alighting, built this costly frame. Inscribed to Phœbus, here he hung on high The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky: Then, o'er the lofty gate, his art embossed Androgeos' death, and (offerings to his ghost) Seven youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet The fate appointed by revengeful Crete. And next to these the dreadful urn was placed, In which the destined names by lots were cast: The mournful parents stand around in tears, And rising Crete against their shore appears. There too, in living sculpture, might be seen The mad affection of the Cretan queen; Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye; The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny— The lower part a beast, a man above— The monument of their polluted love. Nor far from thence he graved the wondrous maze, A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways: Here dwells the monster, hid from human view, Not to be found, but by the faithful clew; Till the kind artist, moved with pious grief, Lent to the loving maid this last relief, And all those erring paths described so well, That Theseus conquered, and the monster fell. Here hapless Icarus had found his part, Had not the father's grief restrained his art. He twice essayed to cast his son in gold; Twice from his hands he dropped the forming mould. All this with wondering eyes Æneas viewed: Each varying object his delight renewed. Eager to read the rest . . . Achates came, And by his side the mad divining dame, The priestess of the god, Deïphobe her name. “Time suffers not,” she said, “to feed your eyes With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice. Seven bullocks, yet unyoked, for Phœbus choose, And for Diana seven unspotted ewes.” This said, the servants urge the sacred rites, While to the temple she the prince invites. A spacious cave, within its farmost part, Was hewed and fashioned by laborious art, Through the hill's hollow sides: before the place, A hundred doors a hundred entries grace: As many voices issue, and the sound Of Sibyl's words as many times rebound. Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries,— “This is the time! inquire your destinies! He comes! behold the god!” Thus while she said, (And shivering at the sacred entry stayed), Her colour changed; her face was not the same, And hollow groans from her deep spirit came. Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possessed Her trembling limbs, and heaved her labouring breast. Greater than humankind she seemed to look, And, with an accent more than mortal, spoke. Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll, When all the god came rushing on her soul. Swiftly she turned, and, foaming as she spoke,— “Why this delay?” she cried—“the powers invoke. Thy prayers alone can open this abode; Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god.” She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear, O'erspread with a damp sweat, and holy fear. The prince himself, with awful dread possessed, His vows to great Apollo thus addressed:— “Indulgent god! propitious power to Troy, Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy! Directed by whose hand, the Dardan dart Pierced the proud Grecian's only mortal part! Thus far, by Fate's decrees and thy commands, Through ambient seas and through devouring sands, Our exiled crew has sought the Ausonian ground; And now, at length, the flying coast is found. Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place, With fury has pursued her wandering race. Here cease, ye powers, and let your vengeance end: Troy is no more, and can no more offend. And thou, O sacred maid, inspired to see The event of things in dark futurity! Give me, what heaven has promised to my fate, To conquer and command the Latian state; To fix my wandering gods, and find a place For the long exiles of the Trojan race. Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear To the twin gods, with vows and solemn prayer; And annual rites, and festivals, and games, Shall be performed to their auspicious names. Nor shalt thou want thy honours in my land; For there thy faithful oracles shall stand, Preserved in shrines; and every sacred lay, Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey— All shall be treasured by a chosen train Of holy priests, and ever shall remain. But, oh! commit not thy prophetic mind To flitting leaves, the sport of every wind, Lest they disperse in air our empty fate; Write not, but, what the powers ordain, relate.” Struggling in vain, impatient of her load, And labouring underneath the ponderous god, The more she strove to shake him from her breast, With more and far superior force he pressed; Commands his entrance, and, without control, Usurps her organs, and inspires her soul. Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores:— “Escaped the dangers of the watery reign, Yet more and greater ills by land remain. The coast, so long desired (nor doubt the event), Thy troops shall reach, but, having reached, repent. Wars, horrid wars, I view—a field of blood, And Tiber rolling with a purple flood. Simoïs nor Xanthus shall be wanting there: A new Achilles shall in arms appear, And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate, Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate. To what strange nations shalt not thou resort, Driven to solicit aid at every court! The cause the same which Ilium once oppressed— A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest. But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes, The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose. The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown, From, whence thou least shall hope, a Grecian town.” Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke, And the resisting air the thunder broke; The cave rebellowed, and the temple shook. The ambiguous god, who ruled her labouring breast, In these mysterious words his mind expressed; Some truths revealed, in terms involved the rest. At length her fury fell, her foaming ceased, And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreased. Then thus the chief:—“No terror to my view, No frightful face of danger, can be new. Inured to suffer, and resolved to dare, The Fates, without my power, shall be without my care. This let me crave—since near your grove the road To hell lies open, and the dark abode, Which Acheron surrounds, the innavigable flood— Conduct me through the regions void of light, And lead me longing to my father's sight. For him, a thousand dangers I have sought, And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought, Safe on my back the sacred burden brought. He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried, And wrath of heaven (my still auspicious guide), And bore, beyond the strength decrepit age supplied. Oft, since he breathed his last, in dead of night, His reverend image stood before my sight; Enjoined to seek, below, his holy shade— Conducted there by your unerring aid. But you, if pious minds by prayers are won, Oblige the father, and protect the son. Yours is the power; nor Proserpine in vain Has made you priestess of her nightly reign. If Orpheus, armed with his enchanting lyre, The ruthless king with pity could inspire, And from the shades below redeem his wife; If Pollux, offering his alternate life, Could free his brother, and can daily go By turns aloft, by turns descend below;— Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend, Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend? Not less than theirs, from Jove my lineage came; My mother greater, my descent the same.” So prayed the Trojan prince, and, while he prayed, His hand upon the holy altar laid. Then thus replied the prophetess divine:— “O goddess-born, of great Anchises' line! The gates of hell are open night and day; Smooth the descent, and easy is the way: But, to return, and view the cheerful skies— In this the task and mighty labour lies. To few great Jupiter imparts this grace, And those of shining worth, and heavenly race. Betwixt those regions and our upper light, Deep forests and impenetrable night Possess the middle space: the infernal bounds Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds. But, if so dire a love your soul invades, As twice below to view the trembling shades; If you so hard a toil will undertake, As twice to pass the innavigable lake; Receive my counsel. In the neighbouring grove There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night Conceal the happy plant from human sight. One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!) The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold: This from the vulgar branches must be torn, And to fair Proserpine the present borne, Ere leave be given to tempt the nether skies. The first thus rent, a second will arise, And the same metal the same room supplies. Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see The lurking gold upon the fatal tree: Then rend it off, as holy rites command; The willing metal will obey thy hand, Following with ease, if, favoured by thy fate, Thou art foredoomed to view the Stygian state: If not, no labour can the tree constrain; And strength of stubborn arms, and steel, are vain. Besides, you know not, while you here attend, The unworthy fate of your unhappy friend: Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost, Deprived of funeral rites, pollutes your host. Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead, Two sable sheep around his hearse be led; Then, living turfs upon his body lay: This done, securely take the destined way, To find the regions destitute of day.” She said, and held her peace.—Æneas went Sad from the cave, and full of discontent, Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. Achates, the companion of his breast, Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppressed. Walking, they talked, and fruitlessly divined, What friend the priestess by those words designed. But soon they found an object to deplore: Misenus lay extended on the shore— Son of the god of winds:—none so renowned, The warrior trumpet in the field to sound, With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms, And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms He served great Hector, and was ever near, Not with his trumpet only, but his spear. But, by Pelides' arms when Hector fell, He chose Æneas; and he chose as well. Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more, He now provokes the sea-gods from the shore. With envy, Triton heard the martial sound, And the bold champion, for his challenge, drowned; Then cast his mangled carcase on the strand:— The gazing crowd around the body stand. All weep; but most Æneas mourns his fate, And hastens to perform the funeral state. In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear; The basis broad below, and top advanced in air. An ancient wood, fit for the work designed (The shady covert of the savage kind), The Trojans found: the sounding axe is plied; Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the towering pride Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke, And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak. Huge trunks of trees, felled from the steepy crown Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down. Armed like the rest the Trojan prince appears, And, by his pious labour, urges theirs. Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind The ways to compass what his wish designed, He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove, And then with vows implored the queen of love:— “O! may thy power, propitious still to me, Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree, In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus' death.” Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight, Two doves, descending from their airy flight, Secure upon the grassy plain alight. He knew his mother's birds; and thus he prayed:— “Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid, And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, Whose glittering shadow gilds the sacred ground. And thou, great parent! with celestial care, In this distress, be present to my prayer.” Thus having said, he stopped, with watchful sight, Observing still the motions of their flight, What course they took, what happy signs they shew. They fed, and, fluttering, by degrees withdrew Still further from the place, but still in view: Hopping and flying thus, they led him on To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun, They winged their flight aloft, then, stooping low, Perched on the double tree, that bears the golden bough. Through the green leaves the glittering shadows glow; As, on the sacred oak, the wintry misletoe, Where the proud mother views her precious brood, And happier branches, which she never sowed. Such was the glittering; such the ruddy rind, And dancing leaves, that wantoned in the wind. He seized the shining bough with griping hold, And rent away, with ease, the lingering gold, Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize. Meantime, the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes, To dead Misenus pay his obsequies. First, from the ground, a lofty pile they rear, Of pitch-trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir: The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew, And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew. The topmost part his glittering arms adorn; Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne. Are poured to wash his body, joint by joint, And fragrant oils the stiffened limbs anoint. With groans and cries Misenus they deplore: Then on a bier, with purple covered o'er, The breathless body, thus bewailed, they lay, And fire the pile, their faces turned away (Such reverent rites their fathers used to pay). Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw, And fat of victims, which his friends bestow. These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour; Then, on the living coals, red wine they pour; And, last, the relics by themselves dispose, Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose. Old Corynæus compassed thrice the crew, And dipped an olive-branch in holy dew; Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud Invoked the dead, and then dismissed the crowd. But good Æneas ordered on the shore A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore, A soldier's falchion, and a seaman's oar. Thus was his friend interred; and deathless fame Still to the lofty cape consigns his name. These rites performed, the prince, without delay, Hastes, to the nether world, his destined way. Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent; And here the access a gloomy grove defends, And here the innavigable lake extends, O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light, No bird presumes to steer his airy flight; Such deadly stenches from the depth arise, And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies. From hence the Grecian bards their legends make, And give the name Avernus to the lake. Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught, For sacrifice the pious hero brought. The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns; Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns, Invoking Hecat hither to repair— A powerful name in hell and upper air. The sacred priests, with ready knives, bereave The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night (The sable wool without a streak of white) Æneas offers; and, by Fate's decree, A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee. With holocausts he Pluto's altar fills: Seven brawny bulls with his own hand he kills: Then, on the broiling entrails, oil he pours; Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours. Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun, Nor ended, till the next returning sun. Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance, And howling dogs in glimmering light advance, Ere Hecat came.—“Far hence be souls profane!” The Sibyl cried—“and from the grove abstain! Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford; Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword.” She said, and passed along the gloomy space; The prince pursued her steps with equal pace. Ye realms, yet unrevealed to human sight! Ye Gods, who rule the regions of the night! Ye gliding ghosts! permit me to relate The mystic wonders of your silent state. Obscure they went through dreary shades, that led Along the waste dominions of the dead. Thus wander travellers in woods by night, By the moon's doubtful and malignant light, When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies, And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes. Just in the gate, and in the jaws of hell, Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell, And pale Diseases, and repining Age, Want, Fear, and Famine's unresisted rage; Here Toils, and Death, and Death's half-brother, Sleep (Forms terrible to view), their sentry keep; With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind, Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind; The Furies' iron beds; and Strife, that shakes Her hissing tresses, and unfolds her snakes. Full in the midst of this infernal road, An elm displays her dusky arms abroad: The god of sleep there hides his heavy head, And empty dreams on every leaf are spread. Of various forms unnumbered spectres more, Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door. Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands, And Briareus with all his hundred hands; Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame; And vain Chimæra vomits empty flame. The chief unsheathed his shining steel, prepared, Though seized with sudden fear, to force the guard, Offering his brandished weapon at their face; Had not the Sibyl stopped his eager pace, And told him what those empty phantoms were— Forms without bodies, and impassive air. Hence to deep Acheron they take their way, Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay, Are whirled aloft, and in Cocytus lost: There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast— A sordid god: down from his hoary chin A length of beard descends, uncombed, unclean: His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire; A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire. He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers; The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears. He looked in years; yet, in his years, were seen A youthful vigour, and autumnal green. An airy crowd came rushing where he stood, Which filled the margin of the fatal flood— Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids, And mighty heroes' more majestic shades, And youths, entombed before their father's eyes, With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries. Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods, Or fowls, by winter forced, forsake the floods, And wing their hasty flight to happier lands— Such, and so thick, the shivering army stands, And press for passage with extended hands. Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore: The rest he drove to distance from the shore. The hero, who beheld, with wondering eyes, The tumult mixed with shrieks, laments, and cries, Asked of his guide, what the rude concourse meant? Why to the shore the thronging people bent? What forms of law among the ghosts were used? Why some were ferried o'er, and some refused? “Son of Anchises! offspring of the gods!” (The Sibyl said) “you see the Stygian floods, The sacred streams, which heaven's imperial state Attests in oaths, and fears to violate. The ghosts rejected are the unhappy crew Deprived of sepulchres and funeral due: The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host, He ferries over to the further coast; Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves With such whose bones are not composed in graves. A hundred years they wander on the shore; At length, their penance done, are wafted o'er.” The Trojan chief his forward pace repressed, Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast. He saw his friends, who, whelmed beneath the waves, Their funeral honours claimed, and asked their quiet graves. The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew, And the brave leader of the Lycian crew, Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met; The sailors mastered, and the ship o'erset. Amidst the spirits, Palinurus pressed, Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest, Who, while he steering viewed the stars, and bore His course from Afric to the Latian shore, Fell headlong down. The Trojan fixed his view, And scarcely through the gloom the sullen shadow knew. Then thus the prince:—“What envious power, O friend! Brought your loved life to this disastrous end? For Phœbus, ever true in all he said, Has, in your fate alone, my faith betrayed. The god foretold you should not die, before You reached, secure from seas, the Italian shore. Is this the unerring power?”—The ghost replied: “Nor Phœbus flattered, nor his answers lied; Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep: But, while the stars and course of heaven I keep, My wearied eyes were seized with fatal sleep. I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrained Was drawn along, which yet my grip retained. Now by the winds and raging waves I swear, Your safety, more than mine, was then my care; Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost, Your ship should run against the rocky coast. Three blustering nights, borne by the southern blast, I floated, and discovered land at last: High on a mounting wave my head I bore, Forcing my strength, and gathering to the shore. Panting, but past the danger, now I seized The craggy cliffs, and my tired members eased. While, cumbered with my dropping clothes, I lay, The cruel nation, covetous of prey, Stained with my blood the unhospitable coast; And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are tossed: Which, O! avert, by yon ethereal light, Which I have lost for this eternal night: Or, if by dearer ties you may be won, By your dead sire, and by your living son, Redeem from this reproach my wandering ghost. Or with your navy seek the Velin coast, And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose; Or, if a nearer way your mother shows, (Without whose aid, you durst not undertake This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake), Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore.” Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:— “What hopes delude thee, miserable man? Think'st thou, thus unintombed, to cross the floods, To view the Furies and infernal gods, And visit, without leave, the dark abodes? Attend the term of long revolving years; Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears. This comfort of thy dire misfortune take— The wrath of heaven, inflicted for thy sake, With vengeance shall pursue the inhuman coast, Till they propitiate thy offended ghost, And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn prayer; And Palinurus' name the place shall bear.” This calmed his cares; soothed with his future fame, And pleased to hear his propagated name. Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw: Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw; Observed their passage through the shady wood, And marked their near approaches to the flood: Then thus he called aloud, inflamed with wrath:— “Mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path In arms presum'st to tread! I charge thee, stand, And tell thy name, and business in the land. Know, this the realm of night—the Stygian shore: My boat conveys no living bodies o'er; Nor was I pleased great Theseus once to bear (Who forced a passage with his pointed spear), Nor strong Alcides—men of mighty fame, And from the immortal gods their lineage came. In fetters one the barking porter tied, And took him trembling from his sovereign's side: Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride.” To whom the Sibyl thus:—“Compose thy mind; Nor frauds are here contrived, nor force designed. Still may the dog the wandering troops constrain Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train, And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain. The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove, Much famed for arms, and more for filial love, Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove. If neither piety, nor heaven's command, Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand, This fatal present shall prevail, at least.”— Then showed the shining bough, concealed within her vest. No more was needful: for the gloomy god Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod; Admired the destined offering to his queen— A venerable gift, so rarely seen. His fury thus appeased, he puts to land; The ghosts forsake their seats at his command: He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight; The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight. Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides; The pressing water pours within her sides. His passengers at length are wafted o'er, Exposed, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore. No sooner landed, in his den they found The triple porter of the Stygian sound, Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear His crested snakes, and armed his bristling hair. The prudent Sibyl had before prepared A sop, in honey steeped, to charm the guard; Which, mixed with powerful drugs, she cast before His greedy grinning jaws, just oped to roar. With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight, With hunger pressed, devours the pleasing bait. Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave; He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave. The keeper charmed, the chief without delay Passed on, and took the irremeable way. Before the gates, the cries of babes new born, Whom Fate had from their tender mothers torn, Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws, Condemned to die, when traitors judged their cause. Nor want they lots, nor judges to review The wrongful sentence, and award a new. Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears; And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears. Round, in his urn, the blended balls he rolls, Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls. The next, in place and punishment, are they Who prodigally throw their souls away— Proxima sorte tenent mœsti loca, qui sibi letum Insontes peperere manu, lucemque perosi, Projecere animas, etc. This was taken, amongst many other things, from the tenth book of Plato de Republicâ: no commentator, besides Fabrini, has taken notice of it. Self-murder was accounted a great crime by that divine philosopher; but the instances which he brings are too many to be inserted in these short notes. Sir Robert Howard, in his translation of this Æneïd, which was printed with his poems in the year 1660, has given us the most learned and the most judicious observations on this book which are extant in our language. Fools, who, repining at their wretched state, And loathing anxious life, suborned their fate. With late repentance, now they would retrieve The bodies they forsook, and wish to live; Their pains and poverty desire to bear, To view the light of heaven, and breathe the vital air: But Fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose, And, with nine circling streams, the captive souls inclose. Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear, So called from lovers that inhabit there. The souls, whom that unhappy flame invades, In secret solitude and myrtle shades Make endless moans, and, pining with desire, Lament too late their unextinguished fire. Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound Made by her son. He saw Pasiphaë there, With Phædra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair. Their Laodamia, with Evadne, moves— Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves: Cæneus, a woman once, and once a man, But ending in the sex she first began. Not far from these Phœnician Dido stood, Fresh from her wound, her bosom bathed in blood; Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew, Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view (Doubtful as he who sees, through dusky night, Or thinks he sees, the moon's uncertain light), With tears he first approached the sullen shade; And, as his love inspired him, thus he said;— “Unhappy queen! then is the common breath Of rumour true, in your reported death, And I, alas! the cause?—By heaven, I vow, And all the powers that rule the realms below, Unwilling I forsook your friendly state, Commanded by the gods, and forced by Fate— Those gods, that Fate, whose unresisted might Have sent me to these regions void of light Through the vast empire of eternal night. Nor dared I to presume, that, pressed with grief, My flight should urge you to this dire relief. Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows! 'Tis the last interview that Fate allows!” In vain he thus attempts her mind to move With tears and prayers, and late-repenting love. Disdainfully she looked; then turning round, But fixed her eyes unmoved upon the ground, And, what he says and swears, regards no more, Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar; But whirled away, to shun his hateful sight, Hid in the forest, and the shades of night; Then sought Sichæus through the shady grove, Who answered all her cares, and equalled all her love. Some pious tears the pitying hero paid, And followed with his eyes the flitting shade, Then took the forward way, by Fate ordained, And, with his guide, the further fields attained, Where, severed from the rest, the warrior souls remained. Tydeus he met, with Meleager's race, The pride of armies, and the soldiers' grace; And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face. Of Trojan chiefs he viewed a numerous train, All much lamented, all in battle slain— Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest, Antenor's sons, and Ceres' sacred priest. And proud Idæus, Priam's charioteer, Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear. The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend, And with unwearied eyes behold their friend; Delight to hover near, and long to know What business brought him to the realms below. But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train, When his refulgent arms flashed through the shady plain, Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear, As when his thundering sword and pointed spear Drove headlong to their ships, and gleaned the routed rear. They raised a feeble cry, with trembling notes; But the weak voice deceived their gasping throats. Here Priam's son, Deïphobus, he found, Whose face and limbs were one continued wound. Dishonest, with lopped arms, the youth appears, Spoiled of his nose, and shortened of his ears. He scarcely knew him, striving to disown His blotted form, and blushing to be known; And therefore first began:—“O Teucer's race! Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface? What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace? 'Twas famed, that, in our last and fatal night, Your single prowess long sustained the fight, Till, tired, not forced, a glorious fate you chose, And fell upon a heap of slaughtered foes. But, in remembrance of so brave a deed, A tomb and funeral honours I decreed; Thrice called your manes on the Trojan plains: The place your armour and your name retains. Your body too I sought, and, had I found, Designed for burial in your native ground.” The ghost replied:—“Your piety has paid All needful rites, to rest my wandering shade: But cruel Fate, and my more cruel wife, To Grecian swords betrayed my sleeping life. These are the monuments of Helen's love— The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above. You know in what deluding joys we past The night, that was by heaven decreed our last. For, when the fatal horse, descending down, Pregnant with arms, o'erwhelmed the unhappy town, She feigned nocturnal orgies; left my bed, And, mixed with Trojan dames, the dances led; Then, waving high her torch, the signal made, Which roused the Grecians from their ambuscade. With watching overworn, with cares oppressed, Unhappy I had laid me down to rest, And heavy sleep my weary limbs possessed. Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid, And, from beneath my head, my sword conveyed; The door unlatched, and, with repeated calls, Invites her former lord within my walls. Thus in her crime her confidence she placed, And with new treasons would redeem the past. What need I more? Into the room they ran, And meanly murdered a defenceless man. Ulysses, basely born, first led the way.— Avenging powers! with justice if I pray, That fortune be their own another day!— But answer you; and in your turn relate, What brought you, living, to the Stygian state. Driven by the winds and errors of the sea, Or did you heaven's superior doom obey? Or tell what other chance conducts your way, To view, with mortal eyes, our dark retreats, Tumults and torments of the infernal seats.” While thus, in talk, the flying hours they pass, The sun had finished more than half his race: And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent The little time of stay which heaven had lent: But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay:— “Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day: 'Tis here, in different paths, the way divides; The right to Pluto's golden palace guides; The left to that unhappy region tends, Which to the depth of Tartarus descends— The seat of night profound, and punished fiends.” Then thus Deïphobus:—“O sacred maid! Forbear to chide, and be your will obeyed. Lo! to the secret shadows I retire, To pay my penance till my years expire. These two verses in English seem very different from the Latin— Discedam; explebo numerum, reddarque tenebris. Yet they are the sense of Virgil; at least, according to the common interpretation of this place—“I will withdraw from your company, retire to the shades, and perform my penance of a thousand years.” But I must confess, the interpretation of those two words, explebo numerum, is somewhat violent, if it be thus understood, minuam numerum; that is, I will lessen your company by my departure: for Deïphobus, being a ghost, can hardly be said to be of their number. Perhaps the poet means by explebo numerum, absolvam sententiam; as if Deïphobus replied to the Sibyl, who was angry at his long visit, “I will only take my last leave of Æneas, my kinsman and my friend, with one hearty good wish for his health and welfare, and then leave you to prosecute your voyage.” That wish is expressed in the words immediately following, I, decus, i, nostrum, etc., which contain a direct answer to what the Sibyl said before, when she upbraided their long discourse, nos flendo ducimus horas. This conjecture is new, and therefore left to the discretion of the reader. Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crowned, And born to better fates than I have found.” He said; and, while he said, his steps he turned To secret shadows, and in silence mourned. The hero, looking on the left, espied A lofty tower, and strong on every side With treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds, Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds; And, pressed betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds. Wide is the fronting gate, and, raised on high With adamantine columns, threats the sky. Vain is the force of man, and heaven's as vain, To crush the pillars which the pile sustain. Sublime on these a tower of steel is reared; And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward, Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day, Observant of the souls that pass the downward way. From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains Of sounding lashes, and of dragging chains. The Trojan stood astonished at their cries, And asked his guide, from whence those yells arise; And what the crimes, and what the tortures were, And loud laments, that rent the liquid air. She thus replied:—“The chaste and holy race Are all forbidden this polluted place. But Hecat, when she gave to rule the woods, Then led me trembling through these dire abodes, And taught the tortures of the avenging gods. These are the realms of unrelenting Fate; And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state. He hears and judges each committed crime; Inquires into the manner, place, and time. The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal (Loth to confess, unable to conceal), From the first moment of his vital breath, To his last hour of unrepenting death. Straight, o'er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes The sounding whip, and brandishes her snakes, And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes. Then, of itself unfolds the eternal door; With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar. You see before the gate, what stalking ghost Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post. More formidable Hydra stands within, Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin. The gaping gulf low to the centre lies, And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies. The rivals of the gods, the Titan race, Here, singed with lightning, roll within the unfathomed space. Here lie the Aloëan twins (I saw them both), Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth, Who dared in fight the Thunderer to defy, Affect his heaven, and force him from the sky. Salmoneus, suffering cruel pains, I found, For emulating Jove with rattling sound Of mimic thunder, and the glittering blaze Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays. Through Elis, and the Grecian towns, he flew: The audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew: He waved a torch aloft, and, madly vain, Sought god-like worship from a servile train. Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass O'er hollow arches of resounding brass, To rival thunder in its rapid course, And imitate inimitable force! But he, the king of heaven, obscure on high, Bared his red arm, and, launching from the sky His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke, Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon struck. There Tityus was to see, who took his birth From heaven, his nursing from the foodful earth. Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace, Infold nine acres of infernal space. A ravenous vulture, in his opened side, Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried; Still for the growing liver digged his breast; The growing liver still supplied the feast; Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains: The immortal hunger lasts, the immortal food remains. Ixion and Pirithoüs I could name, And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame. High o'er their heads a mouldering rock is placed, That promises a fall, and shakes at every blast. They lie below, on golden beds displayed; And genial feasts with regal pomp are made. The queen of Furies by their sides is set, And snatches from their mouths the untasted meat, Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears, Tossing her torch, and thundering in their ears. Then they, who brothers' better claim disown, Expel their parents, and usurp the throne; Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold, Sit brooding on unprofitable gold— Who dare not give, and even refuse to lend, To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend— Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train Of lustful youths, for foul adultery slain— Hosts of deserters, who their honour sold, And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold. All these within the dungeon's depth remain, Despairing pardon, and expecting pain. Ask not what pains; nor further seek to know Their process, or the forms of law below. Some roll a mighty stone; some, laid along, And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung. Unhappy Theseus, doomed for ever there, Is fixed by Fate on his eternal chair: And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries (Could warning make the world more just or wise), “Learn righteousness, and dread the avenging deities.” To tyrants others have their country sold, Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold: Some have old laws repealed, new statutes made, Not as the people pleased, but as they paid. With incest some their daughters' bed profaned. All dared the worst of ills, and, what they dared, attained. Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, And throats of brass, inspired with iron lungs, I could not half those horrid crimes repeat, Nor half the punishments those crimes have met. But let us haste our voyage to pursue: The walls of Pluto's palace are in view; The gate, and iron arch above it, stands, On anvils laboured by the Cyclops' hands. Before our further way the Fates allow, Here must we fix on high the golden bough.” She said: and through the gloomy shades they past, And chose the middle path.—Arrived at last, The prince, with living water, sprinkled o'er His limbs and body; then approached the door, Possessed the porch, and on the front above He fixed the fatal bough, required by Pluto's love. These holy rites performed, they took their way, Where long extended plains of pleasure lay; The verdant fields with those of heaven may vie, With ether vested, and a purple sky— The blissful seats of happy souls below: Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know: Their airy limbs in sports they exercise, And, on the green, contend the wrestler's prize. Some, in heroic verse, divinely sing; Others in artful measures lead the ring. The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest, There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest. His flying fingers, and harmonious quill, Strike seven distinguished notes, and seven at once they fill. Here found they Teucer's old heroic race, Born better times and happier years to grace. Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy. The chief beheld their chariots from afar, Their shining arms, and coursers trained to war. Their lances fixed in earth, their steeds around, Free from their harness, graze the flowery ground. The love of horses which they had, alive, And care of chariots, after death survive. Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain; Some did the song, and some the choir, maintain, Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below. Here patriots live, who, for their country's good, In fighting-fields, were prodigal of blood: Priests of unblemished lives here make abode, And poets worthy their inspiring god; And searching wits, of more mechanic parts, Who graced their age with new invented arts: Those, who to worth their bounty did extend, And those who knew that bounty to commend. The heads of these with holy fillets bound, And all their temples were with garlands crowned. To these the Sibyl thus her speech addressed, And first to him surrounded by the rest— Towering his height, and ample was his breast:— “Say, happy souls! divine Musæus! say, Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way To find the hero, for whose only sake We sought the dark abodes, and crossed the bitter lake?” To this the sacred poet thus replied:— “In no fixed place the happy souls reside. In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds, By crystal streams, that murmur through the meads: But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; The path conducts you to your journey's end.” This said, he led them up the mountain's brow, And shows them all the shining fields below. They wind the hill, and through the blissful meadows go. But old Anchises, in a flowery vale, Reviewed his mustered race, and took the tale— Those happy spirits, which, ordained by Fate, For future being and new bodies wait— With studious thought observed the illustrious throng, In Nature's order as they passed along— Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care, In peaceful senates, and successful war. He, when Æneas on the plain appears, Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.— “Welcome,” he said, “the gods' undoubted race! O long expected to my dear embrace! Once more 'tis given me to behold your face! The love and pious duty which you pay, Have passed the perils of so hard a way. 'Tis true, computing times, I now believed The happy day approached; nor are my hopes deceived. What length of lands, what oceans have you passed, What storms sustained, and on what shores been cast? How have I feared your fate! but feared it most, When love assailed you on the Libyan coast.” To this, the filial duty thus replies:— “Your sacred ghost, before my sleeping eyes, Appeared, and often urged this painful enterprise. After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea, My navy rides at anchor in the bay. But reach your hand, oh parent shade! nor shun The dear embraces of your longing son!” He said; and falling tears his face bedew: Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw; And thrice the flitting shadow slipped away, Like winds, or empty dreams, that fly the day. Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees A separate grove, through which a gentle breeze Plays with a passing breath, and whispers through the trees: And, just before the confines of the wood, The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood. About the boughs an airy nation flew, Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew In summer's heat; on tops of lilies feed, And creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed: The winged army roams the field around; The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound. Æneas wondering stood, then asked the cause, Which to the stream the crowding people draws. Then thus the sire:—“The souls that throng the flood Are those, to whom, by Fate, are other bodies owed: In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste, Of future life secure, forgetful of the past. Long has my soul desired this time and place, To set before your sight your glorious race, That this presaging joy may fire your mind, To seek the shores by destiny designed.”— “O father! can it be, that souls sublime Return to visit our terrestrial clime, And that the generous mind, released by death, Can covet lazy limbs, and mortal breath?” Anchises then, in order, thus begun To clear those wonders to his godlike son:— “Know, first, that heaven, and earth's compacted frame, And flowing waters, and the starry flame, And both the radiant lights, Principio cœlum, et terras, camposque liquentes, Lucentemque globum lunæ, Titaniaque astra, etc. Here the sun is not expressed, but the moon only, though a less, and also a less radiant, light. Perhaps the copies of Virgil are all false, and that, instead of Titaniaque astra, he writ, Titanaque, et astra; and according to these words I have made my translation. It is most certain, that the sun ought not to be omitted; for he is frequently called the life and soul of the world: and nothing bids so fair for a visible divinity to those who know no better, than that glorious luminary. The Platonists call God the archetypal sun, and the sun the visible deity, the inward vital spirit in the centre of the universe, or that body to which that spirit is united, and by which it exerts itself most powerfully. Now it was the received hypothesis amongst the Pythagoreans, that the sun was situate in the centre of the world. Plato had it from them, and was himself of the same opinion, as appears by a passage in the Timœus; from which noble dialogue is this part of Virgil's poem taken. one common soul Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole. This active mind, infused through all the space, Unites and mingles with the mighty mass. Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain, And birds of air, and monsters of the main. The ethereal vigour is in all the same, And every soul is filled with equal flame— As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay Of mortal members subject to decay, Blunt not the beams of heaven and edge of day. From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts, Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts, And grief, and joy; nor can the grovelling mind, In the dark dungeon of the limbs confined, Assert the native skies, or own its heavenly kind: Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains; But long-contracted filth even in the soul remains. The relics of inveterate vice they wear, And spots of sin obscene in every face appear. For this are various penances enjoined; And some are hung to bleach upon the wind, Some plunged in waters, others purged in fires, Till all the dregs are drained, and all the rust expires. All have their manes, and those manes bear: The few, so cleansed, to these abodes repair, And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air. Then are they happy, when by length of time The scurf is worn away, of each committed crime; No speck is left of their habitual stains, But the pure ether of the soul remains. But, when a thousand rolling years are past (So long their punishments and penance last), Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god, Compelled to drink the deep Lethæan flood, In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares Of their past labours, and their irksome years, That, unremembering of its former pain, The soul may suffer mortal flesh again.” Thus having said, the father spirit leads The priestess and his son through swarms of shades, And takes a rising ground, from thence to see The long procession of his progeny.— “Survey” (pursued the sire) “this airy throng, As, offered to thy view, they pass along. These are the Italian names, which Fate will join With ours, and graff upon the Trojan line. Observe the youth who first appears in sight, And holds the nearest station to the light, Already seems to snuff the vital air, And leans just forward on a shining spear: Silvius is he, thy last-begotten race, But first in order sent, to fill thy place— An Alban name, but mixed with Dardan blood; Born in the covert of a shady wood, Him fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife, Shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life. In Alba he shall fix his royal seat, And, born a king, a race of kings beget;— Then Procas, honour of the Trojan name, Capys, and Numitor, of endless fame. A second Silvius after these appears; Silvius Æneas, for thy name he bears; For arms and justice equally renowned, Who, late restored, in Alba shall be crowned. How great they look! how vigorously they wield Their weighty lances, and sustain the shield! But they, who crowned with oaken wreaths appear, Shall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear; Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found; And raise Collatian towers on rocky ground. All these shall then be towns of mighty fame, Though now they lie obscure, and lands without a name. See Romulus the great, born to restore The crown that once his injured grandsire wore. This prince a priestess of our blood shall bear, And like his sire in arms he shall appear. Two rising crests his royal head adorn; Born from a god, himself to godhead born, His sire already signs him for the skies, And marks his seat amidst the deities. Auspicious chief! thy race, in times to come, Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome— Rome, whose ascending towers shall heaven invade, Involving earth and ocean in her shade; High as the mother of the gods in place, And proud, like her, of an immortal race. Then, when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round, With golden turrets on her temples crowned; A hundred gods her sweeping train supply, Her offspring all, and all command the sky. Now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see Your Roman race, and Julian progeny. The mighty Cæsar waits his vital hour, Impatient for the world, and grasps his promised power. But next behold the youth of form divine— Cæsar himself, exalted in his line— Augustus, promised oft, and long foretold, Sent to the realm that Saturn ruled of old; Born to restore a better age of gold. Afric and India shall his power obey; He shall extend his propagated sway Beyond the solar year, without the starry way, Where Atlas turns the rolling heavens around, And his broad shoulders with their lights are crowned. At his foreseen approach, already quake The Caspian kingdoms and Mæotian lake. Their seers behold the tempest from afar; And threatening oracles denounce the war. Nile hears him knocking at his sevenfold gates, And seeks his hidden spring, and fears his nephew's fates. Nor Hercules more lands or labours knew, Not though the brazen-footed hind he slew, Freed Erymanthus from the foaming boar, And dipped his arrows in Lernæan gore; Nor Bacchus, turning from his Indian war, By tigers drawn triumphant in his car, From Nysa's top descending on the plains, With curling vines around his purple reins. And doubt we yet through dangers to pursue The paths of honour, and a crown in view? But what's the man, who from afar appears, His head with olive crowned, his hand a censer bears? His hoary beard and holy vestments bring His lost idea back: I know the Roman king. He shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain, Called from his mean abode, a sceptre to sustain. Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds, An active prince, and prone to martial deeds. He shall his troops for fighting-fields prepare, Disused to toils, and triumphs of the war. By dint of sword his crown he shall increase, And scour his armour from the rust of peace. Whom Ancus follows, with a fawning air, But vain within, and proudly popular. Next view the Tarquin kings, the avenging sword Of Brutus, justly drawn, and Rome restored. He first renews the rods and axe severe, And gives the consuls royal robes to wear. His sons, who seek the tyrant to sustain, And long for arbitrary lords again, With ignominy scourged in open sight, He dooms to death deserved, asserting public right. Unhappy man! to break the pious laws Of nature, pleading in his children's cause! Howe'er the doubtful fact is understood, 'Tis love of honour, and his country's good: The consul, not the father, sheds the blood. Behold Torquatus the same track pursue; And, next, the two devoted Decii view— The Drusian line, Camillus loaded home With standards well redeemed, and foreign foes o'ercome. The pair you see in equal armour shine, Now, friends below, in close embraces join; But, when they leave the shady realms of night, And, clothed in bodies, breathe your upper light, With mortal hate each other shall pursue; What wars, what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue! From Alpine heights the father first descends; His daughter's husband in the plain attends: His daughter's husband arms his eastern friends. Embrace again, my sons! be foes no more; Nor stain your country with her children's gore! And thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim, Thou, of my blood, who bear'st the Julian name! This note, which is out of its proper place, I deferred on purpose, to place it here, because it discovers the principles of our poet more plainly than any of the rest. Tuque prior, tu parce, genus qui ducis Olympo: Projice tela manu, sanguis meus! Anchises here speaks to Julius Cæsar, and commands him first to lay down his arms; which is a plain condemnation of his cause. Yet observe our poet's incomparable address; for, though he shows himself sufficiently to be a commonwealth's man, yet, in respect to Augustus, who was his patron, he uses the authority of a parent, in the person of Anchises, who had more right to lay this injunction on Cæsar than on Pompey, because the latter was not of his blood. Thus our author cautiously veils his own opinion, and takes sanctuary under Anchises; as if that ghost would have laid the same command on Pompey also, had he been lineally descended from him. What could be more judiciously contrived, when this was the Æneïd which he chose to read before his master? Another comes, who shall in triumph ride, And to the Capitol his chariot guide, From conquered Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils. And yet another, famed for warlike toils, On Argos shall impose the Roman laws, And, on the Greeks, revenge the Trojan cause; Shall drag in chains their Achillean race; Shall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace, And Pallas, for her violated place. Great Cato there, for gravity renowned, Quis te, magne Cato, etc.—There is no question but Virgil here means Cato Major, or the censor. But the name of Cato being also mentioned in the Eighth Æneïd, I doubt whether he means the same man in both places. I have said in the preface, that our poet was of republican principles; and have given this for one reason of my opinion that he praised Cato in that line, Secretosque pios, his dantem jura Catonem— and accordingly placed him in the Elysian fields. Montaigne thinks this was Cato the Utican, the great enemy of arbitrary power, and a professed foe to Julius Cæsar. Ruæus would persuade us that Virgil meant the censor. But why should the poet name Cato twice, if he intended the same person? Our author is too frugal of his words and sense, to commit tautologies in either. His memory was not likely to betray him into such an error. Nevertheless I continue in the same opinion concerning the principles of our poet. He declares them sufficiently in this book, where he praises the first Brutus for expelling the Tarquins, giving liberty to Rome, and putting to death his own children, who conspired to restore tyranny. He calls him only an unhappy man, for being forced to that severe action— Infelix! utcunque ferent ea facta minores, Vincet amor patriæ laudumque immensa cupido. Let the reader weigh these two verses, and he must be convinced that I am in the right, and that I have not much injured my master in my translation of them. And conquering Cossus goes with laurels crowned. Who can omit the Gracchi? who declare The Scipios' worth, those thunderbolts of war, The double bane of Carthage? Who can see, Without esteem for virtuous poverty, Severe Fabricius, or can cease to admire The ploughman consul in his coarse attire? Tired as I am, my praise the Fabii claim; And thou, great hero, greatest of thy name, Ordained in war to save the sinking state, And, by delays, to put a stop to fate! Let others better mould the running mass Of metals, and inform the breathing brass, And soften into flesh a marble face; Plead better at the bar; describe the skies, And when the stars descend, and when they rise. But, Rome! 'tis thine alone, with awful sway, To rule mankind, and make the world obey, Disposing peace and war thy own majestic way; To tame the proud, the fettered slave to free:— These are imperial arts, and worthy thee.” He paused—and, while with wondering eyes they viewed The passing spirits, thus his speech renewed:— “See great Marcellus! how, untired in toils, He moves with manly grace, how rich with regal spoils! He, when his country (threatened with alarms) Requires his courage and his conquering arms, Shall more than once the Punic bands affright; Shall kill the Gaulish king in single fight; Then to the Capitol in triumph move, And the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove.” Æneas here beheld, of form divine, A godlike youth in glittering armour shine, With great Marcellus keeping equal pace; But gloomy were his eyes, dejected was his face. He saw, and, wondering, asked his airy guide, What and of whence was he, who pressed the hero's side? “His son, or one of his illustrious name? How like the former, and almost the same! Observe the crowds that compass him around; All gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting sound: But hovering mists around his brows are spread, And night, with sable shades, involves his head.” “Seek not to know” (the ghost replied with tears) “The sorrows of thy sons in future years. This youth (the blissful vision of a day) Shall just be shown on earth, and snatched away. The gods too high had raised the Roman state, Were but their gifts as permanent as great. What groans of men shall fill the Martian field! How fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield! What funeral pomp shall floating Tiber see, When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity! No youth shall equal hopes of glory give, No youth afford so great a cause to grieve. The Trojan honour, and the Roman boast, Admired when living, and adored when lost! Mirror of ancient faith in early youth! Undaunted worth, inviolable truth! No foe, unpunished, in the fighting-field Shall dare thee, foot to foot, with sword and shield. Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force, When thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse. Ah! couldst thou break through Fate's severe decree, A new Marcellus shall arise in thee! In Virgil thus— Tu Marcellus eris. How unpoetically and badly had this been translated, “Thou shalt Marcellus be!” Yet some of my friends were of opinion that I mistook the sense of Virgil in my translation. The French interpreter observes nothing on this place, but that it appears by it the mourning of Octavia was yet fresh for the loss of her son Marcellus, whom she had by her first husband, and who died in the year ab urbe conditâ 731; and collects from thence that Virgil, reading this Æneïd before her in the same year, had just finished it; that, from this time to that of the poet's death, was little more than four years; so that, supposing him to have written the whole Æneïs in eleven years, the first six books must have taken up seven of those years; on which account the six last must of necessity be less correct. Now, for the false judgment of my friends, there is but this little to be said for them; the words of Virgil, in the verse preceding, are these— — Siquâ fata aspera rumpas— as if the poet had meant, “If you break through your hard destiny, so as to be born, you shall be called Marcellus:” but this cannot be the sense; for, though Marcellus was born, yet he broke not through those hard decrees which doomed him to so immature a death. Much less can Virgil mean, “You shall be the same Marcellus by the transmigration of his soul:” for, according to the system of our author, a thousand years must be first elapsed before the soul can return into a human body: but the first Marcellus was slain in the second Punic war; and how many hundred years were yet wanting to the accomplishing his penance may with ease be gathered by computing the time betwixt Scipio and Augustus. By which it is plain, that Virgil cannot mean the same Marcellus; but one of his descendants, whom I call a new Marcellus, who so much resembled his ancestor, perhaps in his features and his person, but certainly in his military virtues, that Virgil cries out, quantum instar in ipso est! which I have translated, How like the former, and almost the same! Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring, Mixed with the purple roses of the spring; Let me with funeral flowers his body strow; This gift which parents to their children owe, This unavailing gift, at least, I may bestow!” Thus having said, he led the hero round The confines of the blest Elysian ground; Which when Anchises to his son had shown, And fired his mind to mount the promised throne, He tells the future wars, ordained by Fate; The strength and customs of the Latian state; The prince, and people; and fore-arms his care With rules, to push his fortune, or to bear. Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn; Of polished ivory this, that of transparent horn; Virgil borrowed this imagination from Homer, Odyssey xix. line 562. The translation gives the reason why true prophetic dreams are said to pass through the gate of horn, by adding the epithet transparent, which is not in Virgil, whose words are only these: Sunt geminæ Somni portæ quarum altera fertur Cornea — What is pervious to the sight is clear; and (alluding to this property) the poet infers such dreams are of divine revelation. Such as pass through the ivory gate are of the contrary nature—polished lies. But there is a better reason to be given; for the ivory alludes to the teeth, the horn to the eyes. What we see is more credible than what we only hear; that is, words that pass through the portal of the mouth, or “hedge of the teeth;” which is Homer's expression for speaking. True visions through transparent horn arise; Through polished ivory pass deluding lies. Of various things discoursing as he passed, Anchises hither bends his steps at last. Then, through the gate of ivory, he dismissed His valiant offspring, and divining guest. Straight to the ships Æneas took his way, Embarked his men, and skimmed along the sea, Still coasting, till he gained Caieta's bay. At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turned to sea, their sterns to shore. BOOK VII. ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Æneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and stirred up by Juno nd Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders, are particularly related. And thou, O matron of immortal fame! Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; Caieta still the place is called from thee, The nurse of great Æneas' infancy. Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia's plains; Thy name ('tis all a ghost can have) remains. Now, when the prince her funeral rites had paid, He ploughed the Tyrrhene seas with sails displayed. From land a gentle breeze arose by night, Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, And the sea trembled with her silver light. Now near the shelves of Circe's shores they run (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun), A dangerous coast!—The goddess wastes her days In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays. In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, And cedar brands supply her father's light. From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main, The roars of lions that refuse the chain, The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears. These from their caverns, at the close of night, Fill the sad isle with horror and affright. Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's power (That watched the moon, and planetary hour), With words and wicked herbs, from humankind Had altered, and in brutal shapes confined. Which monsters lest the Trojans' pious host Should bear, or touch upon the enchanted coast, Propitious Neptune steered their course by night, With rising gales, that sped their happy flight. Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore, And hear the swelling surges vainly roar. Now, when the rosy morn began to rise, And waved her saffron streamer through the skies, When Thetis blushed in purple, not her own, And from her face the breathing winds were blown, A sudden silence sate upon the sea, And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way. The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood, Which thick with shades, and a brown horror, stood: Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course, With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force, That drove the sand along, he took his way, And rolled his yellow billows to the sea. About him, and above, and round the wood, The birds that haunt the borders of his flood, That bathed within, or basked upon his side, To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied. The captain gives command; the joyful train Glide through the gloomy shade, and leave the main. Now, Erato! thy poet's mind inspire, And fill his soul with thy celestial fire. Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings; Declare the past and present state of things, When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought, And how the rivals loved, and how they fought. These are my theme, and how the war began, And how concluded by the godlike man: For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage, Which princes and their people did engage; And haughty souls, that, moved with mutual hate, In fighting fields pursued and found their fate; That roused the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms, And peaceful Italy involved in arms. A larger scene of action is displayed; And, rising hence, a greater work is weighed. Latinus, old and mild, had long possessed The Latian sceptre, and his people blessed: His father Faunus: a Laurentian dame His mother; fair Marica was her name. But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew His birth from Saturn, if records be true. Thus king Latinus, in the third degree, Had Saturn author of his family. But this old peaceful prince, as heaven decreed, Was blessed with no male issue to succeed; His sons in blooming youth were snatched by fate: One only daughter heired the royal state. Fired with her love, and with ambition led, The neighbouring princes court her nuptial bed. Among the crowd, but far above the rest, Young Turnus to the beauteous maid addressed. Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien, Was first, and favoured by the Latian queen; With him she strove to join Lavinia's hand; But dire portents the purposed match withstand. Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood; Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair Was kept and cut with superstitious care. This plant Latinus, when his town he walled, Then found, and from the tree Laurentum called: And last, in honour of his new abode, He vowed the laurel to the laurel's god. It happened once (a boding prodigy!) A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky (Unknown from whence they took their airy flight), Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight; There, with their clasping feet, together clung, And a long cluster from the laurel hung. An ancient augur prophesied from hence:— “Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince! From the same parts of heaven his navy stands, To the same parts on earth; his army lands; The town he conquers, and the tower commands.” Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire Before the gods, and stood beside her sire, (Strange to relate!) the flames, involved in smoke Virgil, in this place, takes notice of a great secret in the Roman divination: the lambent fires, which rose above the head, or played about it, were signs of prosperity; such were those which he observed in the Second Æneïd, which were seen mounting from the crown of Ascanius— Ecce, levis summo de vertice visus Iüli Fundere lumen apex. Smoky flames (or involved in smoke) were of a mixed omen: such were those which are here described; for smoke signifies tears, because it produces them, and flames happiness. And therefore Virgil says that this ostent was not only mirabile visu, but horrendum. Of incense, from the sacred altar broke, Caught her dishevelled hair, and rich attire; Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire: From thence the fuming trail began to spread, And lambent glories danced about her head. This new portent the seer with wonder views, Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:— “The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around, Shall shine with honour, shall herself be crowned, But, caused by her irrevocable fate, War shall the country waste, and change the state.” Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent, For counsel to his father Faunus went, And sought the shades renowned for prophecy, Which near Albunea's sulphurous fountain lie. To those the Latian and the Sabine land Fly, when distressed, and thence relief demand. The priest on skins of offerings takes his ease, And nightly visions in his slumber sees; A swarm of thin aërial shapes appears, And, fluttering round his temples, deafs his ears. These he consults, the future fates to know, From powers above, and from the fiends below. Here, for the god's advice, Latinus flies, Offering a hundred sheep for sacrifice: Their woolly fleeces, as the rites required, He laid beneath him, and to rest retired. No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound, When, from above, a more than mortal sound Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:— “Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke. A foreign sun upon thy shore descends, Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends. His race, in arms and arts of peace renowned, Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound: 'Tis theirs whate'er the sun surveys around.” These answers, in the silent night received, The king himself divulged, the land believed: The fame through all the neighbouring nations flew, When now the Trojan navy was in view. Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread His table on the turf, with cakes of bread; And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed. They sate; and (not without the god's command) Their homely fare dispatched, the hungry band Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour, To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour. Ascanius this observed, and, smiling, said,— “See! we devour the plates on which we fed.” The speech had omen, that the Trojan race Should find repose, and this the time and place. Æneas took the word, and thus replies (Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes): “All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods! Behold the destined place of your abodes! For thus Anchises prophesied of old, And this our fatal place of rest foretold:— ‘When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat, By famine forced, your trenchers you shall eat, Then ease your weary Trojans will attend, And the long labours of your voyage end. Remember on that happy coast to build, And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.’ This was that famine, this the fatal place, Which ends the wandering of our exiled race. Then, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ, To search the land, and where the cities lie, And what the men; but give this day to joy. Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest, Call great Anchises to the genial feast: Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught; Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought.” Thus having said, the hero bound his brows With leafy branches, then performed his vows; Adoring first the genius of the place, Then Earth, the mother of the heavenly race, The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown, And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne, And ancient Cybel, and Idæan Jove, And last his sire below, and mother queen above. Then heaven's high monarch thundered thrice aloud, And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud. Soon through the joyful camp a rumour flew, The time was come their city to renew. Then every brow with cheerful green is crowned, The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round. When next the rosy morn disclosed the day, The scouts to several parts divide their way, To learn the natives' names, their towns explore, The coasts, and trendings of the crooked shore: Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands; Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands. The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways To found his empire, and his town to raise, A hundred youths from all his train selects, And to the Latian court their course directs (The spacious palace where their prince resides), And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides. They go commissioned to require a peace, And carry presents to procure access. Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs The new-elected seat, and draws the lines. The Trojans round the place a rampire cast, And palisades about the trenches placed. Meantime the train, proceeding on their way, From far the town and lofty towers survey; At length approach the walls. Without the gate, They see the boys and Latian youth debate The martial prizes on the dusty plain: Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein; Some bend the stubborn bow for victory, And some with darts their active sinews try. A posting messenger, dispatched from hence, Of this fair troop advised their aged prince, That foreign men, of mighty stature, came; Uncouth their habit, and unknown their name. The king ordains their entrance, and ascends His regal seat, surrounded by his friends. The palace built by Picus, vast and proud, Supported by a hundred pillars stood, And round encompassed with a rising wood. The pile o'erlooked the town, and drew the sight, Surprised at once with reverence and delight. There kings received the marks of sovereign power; In state the monarchs marched; the lictors bore Their awful axes and the rods before. Here the tribunal stood, the house of prayer, And here the sacred senators repair; All at large tables, in long order set, A ram their offering, and a ram their meat. Above the portal, carved in cedar wood, Placed in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood; Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high; And Italus, that led the colony; And ancient Janus, with his double face, And bunch of keys, the porter of the place. There stood Sabinus, planter of the vines; On a short pruning-hook his head reclines, And studiously surveys his generous wines; Then warlike kings, who for their country fought, And honourable wounds from battle brought. Around the posts, hung helmets, darts, and spears, And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars, And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars. Above the rest, as chief of all the band, Was Picus placed, a buckler in his hand, His other waved a long divining wand. Girt in his Gabine gown the hero sate, Yet could not with his art avoid his fate: For Circe long had loved the youth in vain, Till love, refused, converted to disdain: Then, mixing powerful herbs, with magic art, She changed his form, who could not change his heart; Constrained him in a bird, and made him fly, With party-coloured plumes, a chattering pie. In this high temple, on a chair of state, The seat of audience, old Latinus sate; Then gave admission to the Trojan train; And thus, with pleasing accents, he began:— “Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own, Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown— Say what you seek, and whither were you bound; Were you by stress of weather cast aground? (Such dangers of the sea are often seen, And oft befall to miserable men), Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay, Spent and disabled in so long a way? Say what you want: the Latians you shall find Not forced to goodness, but by will inclined; For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign, His hospitable customs we retain. I call to mind (but time the tale has worn) The Aurunci told, that Dardanus, though born On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore, And Samothracia, Samos called before. From Tuscan Corythum he claimed his birth; But after, when exempt from mortal earth, From thence ascended to his kindred skies, A god, and as a god, augments their sacrifice.” He said.—Ilioneus made this reply: “O king, of Faunus' royal family! Nor wintry winds to Latium forced our way, Nor did the stars our wandering course betray. Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound, The port, so long desired, at length we found; From our sweet homes and ancient realms expelled; Great as the greatest that the sun beheld, The god began our line, who rules above; And, as our race, our king descends from Jove: And hither are we come, by his command, To crave admission in your happy land. How dire a tempest, from Mycenæ poured, Our plains, our temples, and our town, devoured; What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms Shook Asia's crown with European arms; Even such have heard, if any such there be, Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea; And such as, born beneath the burning sky And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie. From that dire deluge, through the watery waste, (Such length of years, such various perils past), At last escaped, to Latium we repair, To beg what you without your want may spare— The common water, and the common air; Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes, Fit to receive and serve our banished gods. Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace, Nor length of time our gratitude efface— Besides what endless honour you shall gain, To save and shelter Troy's unhappy train. Now, by my sovereign, and his fate, I swear— Renowned for faith in peace, for force in war— Oft our alliance other lands desired, And, what we seek of you, of us required. Despise not then, that in our hands we bear These holy boughs, and sue with words of prayer. Fate and the gods, by their supreme command, Have doomed our ships to seek the Latian land. To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends; Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends; Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force, And where Numicus opes his holy source. Besides, our prince presents, with his request, Some small remains of what his sire possessed. This golden charger, snatched from burning Troy, Anchises did in sacrifice employ: This royal robe and this tiara wore Old Priam, and this golden sceptre bore, In full assemblies, and in solemn games; These purple vests were weaved by Dardan dames.” Thus while he spoke, Latinus rolled around His eyes, and fixed a while upon the ground. Intent he seemed, and anxious in his breast; Not by the sceptre moved, or kingly vest, But pondering future things of wondrous weight— Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate. On these he mused within his thoughtful mind, And then revolved what Faunus had divined This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed To share his sceptre, and Lavinia's bed: This was the race, that sure portents foreshew To sway the world, and land and sea subdue. At length he raised his cheerful head, and spoke:— “The powers,” said he, “the powers we both invoke, To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be, And firm our purpose with their augury! Have what you ask; your presents I receive; Land, where and when you please, with ample leave; Partake and use my kingdom as your own; All shall be yours, while I command the crown. And, if my wished alliance please your king, Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring: Then let him not a friend's embraces fear; The peace is made when I behold him here. Besides this answer, tell my royal guest, I add to his commands my own request: Only one daughter heirs my crown and state, This has seemed to some an odd passage; that a king should offer his daughter and heir to a stranger prince, and a wanderer, before he had seen him, and when he had only heard of his arrival on his coasts. But these critics have not well considered the simplicity of former times, when the heroines almost courted the marriage of illustrious men. Yet Virgil here observes the rule of decency: Lavinia offers not herself; it is Latinus who propounds the match; and he had been foretold, both by an augur and an oracle, that he should have a foreign son-in-law, who was also a hero;—fathers, in those ancient ages, considering birth and virtue, more than fortune, in the placing of their daughters; which I could prove by various examples; the contrary of which being now practised, I dare not say in our nation, but in France, has not a little darkened the lustre of their nobility. That Lavinia was averse to this marriage, and for what reason, I shall prove in its proper place. Whom not our oracles, nor heaven, nor fate, Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join With any native of the Ausonian line. A foreign son-in-law shall come from far (Such is our doom), a chief renowned in war, Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name, And through the conquered world diffuse our fame. Himself to be the man the fates require, I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire.” He said, and then on each bestowed a steed. Three hundred horses, in high stables fed, Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dressed: Of these he chose the fairest and the best, To mount the Trojan troop. At his command, The steeds caparisoned with purple stand, With golden trappings, glorious to behold, And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold. Then to his absent guest the king decreed A pair of coursers born of heavenly breed, Who from their nostrils breathed ethereal fire; Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire, By substituting mares produced on earth, Whose wombs conceived a more than mortal birth. These draw the chariot which Latinus sends, And the rich present to the prince commends. Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, To their expecting lord with peace return. But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height, As she from Argos took her airy flight, Beheld, with envious eyes, this hateful sight. She saw the Trojan, and his joyful train, Descend upon the shore, desert the main, Design a town, and, with unhoped success, The ambassadors return with promised peace. Then, pierced with pain, she shook her haughty head, Sighed from her inward soul, and thus she said:— “O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes! O fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose! Could they not fall unpitied on the plain, But slain revive, and taken 'scape again? When execrable Troy in ashes lay, Through fires and swords and seas they forced their way. Then vanquished Juno must in vain contend,— Her rage disarmed, her empire at an end! Breathless and tired, is all my fury spent? Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? As if 'twere little from their town to chase, I through the seas pursued their exiled race; Engaged the heavens, opposed the stormy main; But billows roared, and tempests raged in vain. What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, When these they overpass, and those they shun? On Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate, Triumphant o'er the storm's and Juno's hate! Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath, Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon; (What great offence had either people done?) But I, the consort of the Thunderer, Have waged a long and unsuccessful war, With various arts and arms in vain have toiled, And by a mortal man at length am foiled! If native power prevail not, shall I doubt To seek for needful succour from without? If Jove and heaven my just desires deny, Hell shall the power of heaven and Jove supply. Grant that the fates have firmed, by their decree, The Trojan race to reign in Italy: At least I can defer the nuptial day, And, with protracted wars, the peace delay: With blood the dear alliance shall be bought, And both the people to destruction brought; So shall the son-in-law and father join, With ruin, war, and waste of either line. O fatal maid! thy marriage is endowed With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood! Bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand; Another queen brings forth another brand, To burn with foreign fires her native land! A second Paris, differing but in name, Shall fire his country with a second flame.” Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground, With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound, To rouse Alecto from the infernal seat Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat. This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose; One who delights in wars, and human woes. Even Pluto hates his own misshapen race; Her sister Furies fly her hideous face; So frightful are the forms the monster takes, So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes. Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite:— “O virgin daughter of eternal Night, Give me this once thy labour, to sustain My right, and execute my just disdain. Let not the Trojans, with a feigned pretence Of proffered peace, delude the Latian prince. Expel from Italy that odious name, And let not Juno suffer in her fame. 'Tis thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a state, Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate, And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate. Thy hand o'er towns the funeral torch displays, And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways. Now shake, from out thy fruitful breast, the seeds Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds: Confound the peace established, and prepare Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war.” Smeared as she was with black Gorgonian blood, The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood; And on her wicker wings, sublime through night, She to the Latian palace took her flight: There sought the queen's apartments, stood before The peaceful threshold, and besieged the door. Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast Fired with disdain for Turnus dispossessed, And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest. From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes Her darling plague, the favourite of her snakes: With her full force she threw the poisonous dart, And fixed it deep within Amata's heart, That, thus envenomed, she might kindle rage, And sacrifice to strife her house and husband's age, Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs, His baleful breath inspiring as he glides. Now like a chain around her neck he rides, Now like a fillet to her head repairs, And with his circling volumes folds her hairs. At first the silent venom slid with ease, And seized her cooler senses by degrees; Then, ere the infected mass was fired too far, In plaintive accents she began the war, And thus bespoke her husband:—“Shall,” she said, “A wandering prince enjoy Lavinia's bed? If nature plead not in a parent's heart, Pity my tears, and pity her desert. I know, my dearest lord, the time will come, You would, in vain, reverse your cruel doom: The faithless pirate soon will set to sea, And bear the royal virgin far away! A guest like him, a Trojan guest before, In show of friendship sought the Spartan shore, And ravished Helen from her husband bore. Think on a king's inviolable word; And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord. To this false foreigner you give your throne, And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son. Resume your ancient care; and, if the god Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood, Know all are foreign, in a larger sense, Not born your subjects, or derived from hence. Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace, He springs from Inachus of Argive race.” But, when she saw her reasons idly spent, And could not move him from his fixed intent, She flew to rage; for now the snake possessed Her vital parts, and poisoned all her breast. She raves, she runs with a distracted pace, And fills, with horrid howls, the public place. And, as young striplings whip the top for sport, On the smooth pavement of an empty court; The wooden engine flies and whirls about, Admired, with clamours, of the beardless rout; They lash aloud; each other they provoke, And lend their little souls at every stroke: Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes. Nor yet content, she strains her malice more, And adds new ills to those contrived before: She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng Of madding matrons, bears the bride along, Wandering through woods and wilds, and devious ways, And with these arts the Trojan match delays. She feigned the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud, And to the buxom god the virgin vowed. “Evœ! O Bacchus!” thus began the song; And “Evœ!” answered all the female throng. “O virgin worthy thee alone!” she cried; “O worthy thee alone!” the crew replied. “For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance. And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance.” Like fury seized the rest: the progress known, All seek the mountains, and forsake the town: All, clad in skins of beasts, the javelin bear, Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair, And shrieks and shoutings rend the suffering air. The queen herself, inspired with rage divine, Shook high above her head a flaming pine, Then rolled her haggard eyes around the throng, And sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song:— “Iö! ye Latian dames, if any here Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear; If there be here,” she said, “who dare maintain My right, nor think the name of mother vain; Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair, And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare.” Amata's breast the Fury thus invades, And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades. Then, when she found her venom spread so far, The royal house embroiled in civil war, Raised on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies, And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies. His town, as Fame reports, was built of old By Danaë, pregnant with almighty gold, Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train Of following Argives, through the stormy main, Driven by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign. 'Twas Ardua once: now Ardea's name it bears; Once a fair city, now consumed with years; Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay, Betwixt the confines of the night and day, Secure in sleep.—The Fury laid aside Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried The foulness of the infernal form to hide. Propped on a staff, she takes a trembling mien: Her face is furrowed, and her front obscene; Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws; Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws; Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound, Her temples with an olive wreath are crowned. Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane Of Juno, now she seemed, and thus began, Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:— “Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain? Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize, Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories? The bride and sceptre, which thy blood has bought, The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought. Go now, deluded man, and seek again New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain! Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize; Protect the Latians in luxurious ease! This dream all-powerful Juno sends; I bear Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear. Haste! arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain; With faith to friend, assault the Trojan train: Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy. The Latian king, unless he shall submit, Own his old promise, and his new forget— Let him, in arms, the power of Turnus prove, And learn to fear whom he disdains to love. For such is heaven's command.”—The youthful prince With scorn replied, and made this bold defence:— “You tell me, mother, what I knew before, The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore. I neither fear nor will provoke the war; My fate is Juno's most peculiar care. But time has made you dote, and vainly tell Of arms, imagined in your lonely cell. Go! be the temple and the gods your care; Permit to men the thought of peace and war.” These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke, And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke. Her eyes grow stiffened, and with sulphur burn; Her hideous looks and hellish form return; Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place, And open all the furies of her face: Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes, She cast him backward as he strove to rise, And, lingering, sought to frame some new replies. High on her head she rears two twisted snakes: Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes; And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:— “Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell Of arms, imagined in her lonely cell! Behold the Fates' infernal minister! War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear.” Thus having said, her smouldering torch, impressed With her full force, she plunged into his breast. Aghast he waked; and, starting from his bed, Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread.— “Arms! arms!” he cries: “my sword and shield prepare!” He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war. So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries, The bubbling waters from the bottom rise: Above the brims they force their fiery way; Black vapours climb aloft, and cloud the day. The peace polluted thus, a chosen band He first commissions to the Latian land, In threatening embassy; then raised the rest, To meet in arms the intruding Trojan guest, To force the foes from the Lavinian shore, And Italy's endangered peace restore. Himself alone an equal match he boasts, To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts. The gods invoked, the Rutuli prepare Their arms, and warm each other to the war. His beauty these, and those his blooming age, The rest his house and his own fame engage. While Turnus urges thus his enterprise, The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies; New frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand, Which overlooks the vale with wide command; Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train, With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain, And pitch their toils around the shady plain. The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent, And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent. 'Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise High o'er his front, his beams invade the skies. From this light cause, the infernal maid prepares The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars. The stately beast the two Tyrrhidæ bred, Snatched from his dam, and the tame youngling fed. Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring, Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king: Their sister Silvia cherished with her care The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied His tender neck, and combed his silken hide, And bathed his body. Patient of command In time he grew, and, growing used to hand, He waited at his master's board for food; Then sought his savage kindred in the wood, Where grazing all the day, at night he came To his known lodgings, and his country dame. This household beast, that used the woodland grounds, Was viewed at first by the young hero's hounds, As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat In the cool waters, and to quench his heat. Ascanius, young, and eager of his game, Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim: But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides, Which pierced his bowels through his panting sides. The bleeding creature issues from the floods, Possessed with fear, and seeks his known abodes, His old familiar hearth, and household gods. He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans, Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans. Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud For succour from the clownish neighbourhood: The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay In the close woody covert, urged their way. One with a brand yet burning from the flame, Armed with a knotty club another came: Whate'er they catch or find, without their care, Their fury makes an instrument of war. Tyrrheus, the foster-father of the beast, Then clenched a hatchet in his horny fist, But held his hand from the descending stroke, And left his wedge within the cloven oak, To whet their courage, and their rage provoke. And now the goddess, exercised in ill, Who watched an hour to work her impious will, Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn, Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne, Adds all her breath. The rocks and woods around, And mountains, tremble at the infernal sound. The sacred lake of Trivia from afar, The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar, Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war. Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possessed, And strain their helpless infants to their breast. The clowns, a boisterous, rude, ungoverned crew, With furious haste to the loud summons flew. The powers of Troy, then issuing on the plain, With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain: Not theirs a raw and unexperienced train, But a firm body of embattled men. At first, while fortune favoured neither side, The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried: But now, both parties reinforced, the fields Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields. A shining harvest either host displays, And shoots against the sun with equal rays. Thus, when a black-browed gust begins to rise, White foam at first on the curled ocean fries; Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies; Till, by the fury of the storm full blown, The muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown. First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care, Pierced with an arrow from the distant war: Fixed in his throat the flying weapon stood, And stopped his breath, and drank his vital blood. Huge heaps of slain around the body rise: Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies; A good old man, while peace he preached in vain, Amidst the madness of the unruly train: Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures filled; His lands a hundred yoke of oxen tilled. Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood, The Fury bathed them in each other's blood; Then, having fixed the fight, exulting flies, And bears fulfilled her promise to the skies. To Juno thus she speaks:—“Behold! 'tis done, The blood already drawn, the war begun; The discord is complete; nor can they cease The dire debate, nor you command the peace. Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood Have tasted vengeance, and the sweets of blood; Speak, and my power shall add this office more: The neighbouring nations of the Ausonian shore Shall hear the dreadful rumour, from afar, Of armed invasion, and embrace the war.” Then Juno thus:—“The grateful work is done, The seeds of discord sowed, the war begun: Frauds, fears, and fury, have possessed the state, And fixed the causes of a lasting hate. A bloody Hymen shall the alliance join Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line: But thou with speed to night and hell repair; For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear Thy lawless wandering walks in upper air. Leave what remains to me.” Saturnia said: The sullen fiend her sounding wings displayed, Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade. In midst of Italy, well known to fame, There lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name) Below the lofty mounts: on either side Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide. Full in the centre of the sacred wood, An arm arises of the Stygian flood, Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound, Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around. Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell, And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell. To this infernal lake the Fury flies; Here hides her hated head, and frees the labouring skies. Saturnian Juno now, with double care, Attends the fatal process of the war. The clowns, returned from battle, bear the slain, Implore the gods, and to their king complain. The corpse of Almon, and the rest, are shown: Shrieks, clamours, murmurs, fill the frighted town. Ambitious Turnus in the press appears, And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears; Proclaims his private injuries aloud, A solemn promise made, and disavowed; A foreign son is sought, and a mixed mongrel brood. Then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear, In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear, And lead his dances with dishevelled hair, Increase the clamour, and the war demand (Such was Amata's interest in the land), Against the public sanctions of the peace, Against all omens of their ill success. With fates averse, the rout in arms resort, To force their monarch, and insult the court. But, like a rock unmoved, a rock that braves The raging tempest and the rising waves— Propped on himself he stands; his solid sides Wash off the sea-weeds, and the sounding tides— So stood the pious prince unmoved, and long Sustained the madness of the noisy throng. But, when he found that Juno's power prevailed, And all the methods of cool counsel failed, He calls the gods to witness their offence, Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence. “Hurried by fate,” he cries, “and borne before A furious wind, we leave the faithful shore! O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war: Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate, And pray to heaven for peace, but pray too late. For me, my stormy voyage at an end, I to the port of death securely tend. The funeral pomp which to your kings you pay, Is all I want, and all you take away.” He said no more, but, in his walls confined, Shut out the woes which he too well divined; Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive, But left the helm, and let the vessel drive. A solemn custom was observed of old, Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold, Their standard when in fighting fields they rear Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war— Or from the boasting Parthians would regain Their eagles, lost in Carræ's bloody plain. Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear, And still are worshipped with religious fear) Before his temple stand: the dire abode, And the feared issues of the furious god, Are fenced with brazen bolts; without the gates, The wary guardian Janus doubly waits. Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars, The Roman consul their decree declares, And in his robes the sounding gates unbars. The youth in military shouts arise, And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies. These rites, of old by sovereign princes used, Were the king's office: but the king refused, Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar Of sacred peace, or loose the imprisoned war; But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms, Abhorred the wicked ministry of arms. Then heaven's imperious queen shot down from high; At her approach the brazen hinges fly; The gates are forced, and every falling bar; And, like a tempest, issues out the war. The peaceful cities of the Ausonian shore, Lulled in their ease, and undisturbed before, Are all on fire; and some, with studious care, Their restive steeds in sandy plains prepare; Some their soft limbs in painful marches try, And war is all their wish, and arms the general cry. Part scour their rusty shields with seam; and part New grind the blunted axe, and point the dart: With joy they view the waving ensigns fly, And hear the trumpet's clangour pierce the sky. Five cities forge their arms—the Atinian powers, Antemne, Tibur with her lofty towers, Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town: All these of old were places of renown. Some hammer helmets for the fighting field; Some twine young sallows to support the shield; The corselet some, and some the cuishes mould, With silver plated, and with ductile gold. The rustic honours of the scythe and share Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war. Old falchions are new tempered in the fires: The sounding trumpet every soul inspires. The word is given; with eager speed they lace The shining head-piece, and the shield embrace. The neighing steeds are to the chariots tied; The trusty weapon sits on every side. And, now the mighty labour is begun, Ye Muses, open all your Helicon. Sing you the chiefs that swayed the Ausonian land, Their arms, and armies under their command; What warriors in our ancient clime were bred; What soldiers followed, and what heroes led. For well you know, and can record alone, What fame to future times conveys but darkly down. Mezentius first appeared upon the plain: Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain, Defying earth and heaven. Etruria lost, He brings to Turnus' aid his baffled host. The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire, Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire; To Turnus only second in the grace Of manly mien, and features of the face. A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred, With fates averse a thousand men he led: His sire unworthy of so brave a son; Himself well worthy of a happier throne. Next Aventinus drives his chariot round The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crowned. Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field; His father's hydra fills his ample shield: A hundred serpents hiss about the brims; The son of Hercules he justly seems, By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs— Of heavenly part, and part of earthly blood, A mortal woman mixing with a god. For strong Alcides, after he had slain The triple Geryon, drove from conquered Spain His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led, On Tuscan Tiber's flowery banks they fed. Then, on mount Aventine, the son of Jove The priestess Rhea found, and forced to love. For arms, his men long piles and javelins bore; And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore. Like Hercules himself, his son appears In savage pomp; a lion's hide he wears; About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin; The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin. Thus, like the god his father, homely drest, He strides into the hall, a horrid guest. Then two twin-brothers from fair Tibur came, (Which from their brother Tiburs took the name), Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear: Armed Argive horse they led, and in the front appear, Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's height With rapid course descending to the fight; They rush along, the rattling woods give way; The branches bend before their sweepy sway. Nor was Præneste's founder wanting there, Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber: Found in the fire, and fostered in the plains, A shepherd and a king at once he reigns, And leads to Turnus' aid his country swains. His own Præneste sends a chosen band, With those who plough Saturnia's Gabine land; Besides the succour which cold Anien yields, The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields, Anagnia fat, and father Amasene— A numerous rout, but all of naked men: Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield, Nor drive the chariot through the dusty field, But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead, And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head; The left foot naked, when they march to fight But in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right. Messapus next (great Neptune was his sire), Secure of steel, and fated from the fire, In pomp appears, and with his ardour warms A heartless train, unexercised in arms: The just Faliscans he to battle brings, And those who live where lake Ciminius springs; And where Feronia's grove and temple stands, Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands: All these in order march, and marching sing The warlike actions of their sea-born king; Like a long team of snowy swans on high, Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky, When, homeward from their watery pastures borne, They sing, and Asia's lakes their notes return. Not one, who heard their music from afar, Would think these troops an army trained to war, But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar, With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore. Then Clausus came, who led a numerous band Of troops embodied from the Sabine land, And, in himself alone, an army brought. 'Twas he the noble Claudian race begot, The Claudian race, ordained, in times to come, To share the greatness of imperial Rome. He led the Cures forth of old renown, Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town, And all the Eretian powers; besides a band That followed from Velinum's dewy land, And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame, And mountaineers, that from Severus came, And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica, And those where yellow Tiber takes his way, And where Himella's wanton waters play. Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli: The warlike aids of Horta next appear, And the cold Nursians come to close the rear Mixed with the natives born of Latine blood, Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood. Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main, When pale Orion sets in wintry rain, Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise, Or Lycian fields, when Phœbus burns the skies, Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around; Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground. High in his chariot then Halesus came, A foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name: From Agamemnon born—to Turnus' aid, A thousand men the youthful hero led, Who till the Massic soil, for wine renowned, And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground, And those who live by Sidicinian shores, And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars, Cales' and Osca's old inhabitants, And rough Saticulans, inured to wants. Light demi-lances from afar they throw, Fastened with leathern thongs, to gall the foe. Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear, And on their warding arm light bucklers bear. Nor, Œbalus, shalt thou be left unsung, From nymph Sebethis and old Telon sprung, Who then in Teleboan Capri reigned; But that short isle the ambitious youth disdained, And o'er Campania stretched his ample sway, Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea— O'er Batulum, and where Abella sees, From her high towers, the harvest of her trees. I observe that Virgil names not Nola, which was not far distant from Abella; perhaps because that city (the same in which Augustus died afterwards) had once refused to give him entertainment, if we may believe the author of his life. Homer heartily curses another city which had used him in the same manner; but our author thought his silence of the Nolans a sufficient correction. When a poet passes by a place or person, though a fair occasion offers of remembering them, it is a sign he is, or thinks himself, much disobliged. And these (as was the Teuton use of old) Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold; Sling weighty stones when from afar they fight; Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light. Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went, And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent. The rude Æquiculæ his rule obeyed; Hunting their sport, and plundering was their trade. In arms they ploughed, to battle still prepared: Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard. Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led, By king Archippus sent to Turnus' aid, And peaceful olives crowned his hoary head. His wand and holy words, the viper's rage, And venomed wounds of serpents, could assuage. He, when he pleased with powerful juice to steep Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep. But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art, To cure the wound given by the Dardan dart. Yet his untimely fate the Angitian woods In sighs remurmured to the Fucine floods. The son of famed Hippolytus was there, Famed as his sire, and, as his mother, fair; Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore, And nursed his youth along the marshy shore, Where great Diana's peaceful altars flame, In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name. Hippolytus, as old records have said, Was by his stepdame sought to share her bed: But, when no female arts his mind could move, She turned to furious hate her impious love. Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore, Another's crimes the unhappy hunter bore, Glutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore. But chaste Diana, who his death deplored, With Æsculapian herbs his life restored: When Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain, The dead inspired with vital breath again, Struck to the centre, with his flaming dart, The unhappy founder of the godlike art. But Trivia kept in secret shades alone, Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown; And called him Virbius in the Egerian grove, Where then he lived obscure, but safe from Jove. For this, from Trivia's temple and her wood, Are coursers driven, who shed their master's blood, Affrighted by the monsters of the flood. His son, the second Virbius, yet retained His father's art, and warrior steeds he reined. Amid the troops, and like the leading god, High o'er the rest in arms, the graceful Turnus rode: A triple pile of plumes his crest adorned, On which with belching flames Chimæra burned: The more the kindled combat rises higher, The more with fury burns the blazing fire. Fair Iö graced his shield; but Iö now With horns exalted stands, and seems to low— A noble charge! Her keeper by her side, To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied; And on the brims her sire, the watery god, Rolled from his silver urn his crystal flood. A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields With swords, and pointed spears, and clattering shields; Of Argive, and of old Sicanian bands, And those who plough the rich Rutulian lands; Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields, And the proud Labicans, with painted shields, And those who near Numician streams reside, And those whom Tiber's holy forests hide, Or Circe's hills from the main land divide; Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands, Or the black water of Pomptina stands. Last from the Volscians fair Camilla came, And led her warlike troops, a warrior dame: Unbred to spinning, in the loom unskilled, She chose the nobler Pallas of the field. Mixed with the first, the fierce virago fought, Sustained the toils of arms, the danger sought, Outstripped the winds in speed upon the plain, Flew o'er the field, nor hurt the bearded grain: She swept the seas, and, as she skimmed along, Her flying feet unbathed on billows hung. Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise, Where'er she passes, fix their wondering eyes: Longing they look, and gaping at the sight, Devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight; Her purple habit sits with such a grace On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face; Her head with ringlets of her hair is crowned, And in a golden caul the curls are bound. She shakes her myrtle javelin; and, behind, Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind. END OF THE FOURTEENTH VOLUME. VOL. XV. BOOK VIII. ARGUMENT. The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Æneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Æneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his powers, His standard planted on Laurentum's towers, When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had given the signal of approaching war, Had roused the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clattered on their shields, Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join the allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphemed aloud. These through the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force. Then Venulus to Diomede they send, To beg his aid Ausonia to defend, Declare the common danger, and inform The Grecian leader of the growing storm: “Æneas, landed on the Latian coast, With banished gods, and with a baffled host, Yet now aspired to conquest of the state, And claimed a title from the gods and fate; What numerous nations in his quarrel came, And how they spread his formidable name. What he designed, what mischiefs might arise, If fortune favoured his first enterprise, Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, And common interest, was involved in theirs.” While Turnus and the allies thus urge the war, The Trojan, floating in a flood of care, Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare. This way, and that, he turns his anxious mind; Thinks and rejects the counsels he designed; Explores himself in vain, in every part, And gives no rest to his distracted heart. So, when the sun by day, or moon by night, Strike on the polished brass their trembling light, This similitude is literally taken from Apollonius Rhodius; and it is hard to say whether the original or the translation excels. But, in the shield which he describes afterwards in this Æneïd, he as much transcends his master Homer, as the arms of Glaucus were richer than those of Diomedes—?????? ???????? The glittering species here and there divide, And cast their dubious beams from side to side; Now on the walls, now on the pavement play, And to the ceiling flash the glaring day. 'Twas night; and weary nature lulled asleep The birds of air, and fishes of the deep, And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief Was laid on Tiber's banks, oppressed with grief, And found, in silent slumber, late relief. Then, through the shadows of the poplar wood, Arose the father of the Roman flood; An azure robe was o'er his body spread, A wreath of shady reeds adorned his head: Thus, manifest to sight, the god appeared, And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheered:— “Undoubted offspring of ethereal race, O long expected in this promised place! Who, through the foes, hast borne thy banished gods, Restored them to their hearths, and old abodes— This is thy happy home, the clime where fate Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state. Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace, And all the rage of haughty Juno cease. And that this nightly vision may not seem The effect of fancy, or an idle dream, A sow beneath an oak shall lie along, All white herself, and white her thirty young. When thirty rolling years have run their race, Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space, Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame, Which from this omen shall receive the name. Time shall approve the truth.—For what remains, And how with sure success to crown thy pains, With patience next attend. A banished band, Driven with Evander from the Arcadian land, Have planted here, and placed on high their walls; Their town the founder Pallanteum calls, Derived from Pallas, his great grandsire's name: But the fierce Latians old possession claim, With war infesting the new colony. These make thy friends, and on their aid rely. To thy free passage I submit my streams. Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams; And, when the setting stars are lost in day, To Juno's power thy just devotion pay; With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease: Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease. When thou return'st victorious from the war, Perform thy vows to me with grateful care. The god am I, whose yellow water flows Around these fields, and fattens as it goes: Tiber my name—among the rolling floods, Renowned on earth, esteemed among the gods. This is my certain seat. In times to come, My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome.” He said, and plunged below. While yet he spoke, His dream Æneas and his sleep forsook. He rose, and, looking up, beheld the skies With purple blushing, and the day arise. Then water in his hollow palm he took From Tiber's flood, and thus the powers bespoke:— “Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed, And father Tiber, in thy sacred bed Receive Æneas, and from danger keep. Whatever fount, whatever holy deep, Conceals thy watery stores—where'er they rise, And, bubbling from below, salute the skies— Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn, For this thy kind compassion of our woes, Shalt share my morning song, and evening vows. But, oh! be present to thy people's aid, And firm the gracious promise thou hast made.” Thus having said, two galleys, from his stores, With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars. Now on the shore the fatal swine is found— Wonderous to tell!—She lay along the ground: Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung; She white herself, and white her thirty young. Æneas takes the mother and her brood, And all on Juno's altar are bestowed. The translation is infinitely short of Virgil, whose words are these,— — Tibi enim, tibi maxima Juno, Mactat, sacra ferens, et cum grege sistit ad aram— for I could not turn the word enim into English with any grace, though it was of such necessity in the Roman rites, that a sacrifice could not be performed without it. It is of the same nature (if I may presume to name that sacred mystery), in our words of consecration at the altar. The following night, and the succeeding day, Propitious Tiber smoothed his watery way: He rolled his river back, and poised he stood, A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood. The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore, Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. Shouts from the land give omen to their course, And the pitched vessels glide with easy force. The woods and waters wonder at the gleam Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream. One summer's night and one whole day they pass Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass. The fiery sun had finished half his race, Looked back, and doubted in the middle space, When they from far beheld the rising towers, The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bowers, Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay, Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway. These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor) The Trojan saw, and turned his ships to shore. 'Twas on a solemn day: the Arcadian states, The king and prince, without the city gates, Then paid their offerings in a sacred grove To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove. Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies, And fat of entrails on his altar fries. But, when they saw the ships that stemmed the flood, And glittered through the covert of the wood, They rose with fear, and left the unfinished feast, Till dauntless Pallas reassured the rest To pay the rites. Himself without delay A javelin seized, and singly took his way, Then gained a rising ground, and called from far:— “Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are; Your business here; and bring you peace or war?” High on the stern Æneas took his stand, And held a branch of olive in his hand, While thus he spoke:—“The Phrygians' arms you see, Expelled from Troy, provoked in Italy By Latian foes, with war unjustly made— At first affianced, at last betrayed. This message bear:—The Trojans and their chief Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.” Struck with so great a name, and all on fire, The youth replies:—“Whatever you require, Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend, A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend.” He said, and, downward hasting to the strand, Embraced the stranger prince, and joined his hand. Conducted to the grove, Æneas broke The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:— “Best of the Greeks! to whom, by fate's command, I bear these peaceful branches in my hand— Undaunted I approach you, though I know Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe; From Atreus though your ancient lineage came, And both the brother kings your kindred claim; Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown, Your virtue, through the neighbouring nations blown, Our fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice, Have led me hither, less by need than choice. Our father Dardanus, as fame has sung, And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung: Electra from the loins of Atlas came— Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame. Your sire is Mercury, whom long before On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore. Maia the fair, on fame if we rely, Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky. Thus from one common source our streams divide; Ours is the Trojan, yours the Arcadian side. Raised by these hopes, I sent no news before, Nor asked your leave, nor did your faith implore; But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador. The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue The Trojan race, are equal foes to you. Our host expelled, what farther force can stay The victor troops from universal sway? Then will they stretch their power athwart the land, And either sea from side to side command. Receive our offered faith, and give us thine; Ours is a generous and experienced line: We want not hearts nor bodies for the war; In council cautious, and in fields we dare.” He said; and while he spoke, with piercing eyes Evander viewed the man with vast surprise— Pleased with his action, ravished with his face; Then answered briefly, with a royal grace:— “O valiant leader of the Trojan line, In whom the features of thy father shine! How I recall Anchises! how I see His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee! Long though it be, 'tis fresh within my mind, When Priam to his sister's court designed A welcome visit, with a friendly stay, And through the Arcadian kingdom took his way. Then, past a boy, the callow down began To shade my chin, and call me first a man. I saw the shining train with vast delight, And Priam's goodly person pleased my sight: But great Anchises, far above the rest, With awful wonder fired my youthful breast. I longed to join, in friendship's holy bands, Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands, I first accosted him: I sued, I sought, And with a loving force, to Pheneus, brought. He gave me, when at length constrained to go, A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow, A vest embroidered, glorious to behold, And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold, Which my son's coursers in obedience hold. The league you ask, I offer, as your right; And, when to-morrow's sun reveals the light, With swift supplies you shall be sent away. Now celebrate, with us, this solemn day, Whose holy rites admit no long delay. Honour our annual feast; and take your seat, With friendly welcome, at a homely treat.” Thus having said, the bowls (removed for fear) The youths replaced, and soon restored the cheer. On sods of turf he set the soldiers round: A maple throne, raised higher from the ground, Received the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed, A lion's shaggy hide, for ornament, they spread. The loaves were served in canisters; the wine In bowls; the priest renewed the rites divine: Broiled entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine. But, when the rage of hunger was repressed, Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:— “These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king, From no vain fears or superstition spring, Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance, Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance: But, saved from danger, with a grateful sense, The labours of a god we recompense. See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky, About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie; Such undigested ruin; bleak and bare, How desert now it stands, exposed in air! 'Twas once a robber's den, inclosed around With living stone, and deep beneath the ground. The monster Cacus, more than half a beast, This hold, impervious to the sun, possessed. The pavement ever foul with human gore; Heads, and their mingled members, hung the door. Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire, Black clouds he belched, and flakes of livid fire. Time, long expected, eased us of our load, And brought the needful presence of a god. The avenging force of Hercules, from Spain, Arrived in triumph, from Geryon slain:— Thrice lived the giant, and thrice lived in vain. His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove Near Tiber's banks, to graze the shady grove. Allured with hope of plunder, and intent By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent, The brutal Cacus, as by chance they strayed, Four oxen thence, and four fair kine, conveyed. And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen, He dragged them backwards to his rocky den. The tracks averse a lying notice gave, And led the searcher backward from the cave. Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place, To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass. The beasts, who missed their mates, filled all around With bellowings, and the rocks restored the sound. One heifer, who had heard her love complain, Roared from the cave, and made the project vain. Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook, And tossed about his head his knotted oak. Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight, He clomb, with eager haste, the aerial height. Then first we saw the monster mend his pace; Fear in his eyes, and paleness in his face, Confessed the god's approach. Trembling he springs, As terror had increased his feet with wings; Nor stayed for stairs; but down the depth he threw His body, on his back the door he drew (The door, a rib of living rock; with pains His father hewed it out, and bound with iron chains): He broke the heavy links, the mountains closed, And bars and levers to his foe opposed. The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast; The fierce avenger came with bounding haste; Surveyed the mouth of the forbidden hold, And here and there his raging eyes he rolled. He gnashed his teeth; and thrice he compassed round With winged speed the circuit of the ground. Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pulled in vain, And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain. A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black, Grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back; Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night, Here built their nests, and hither winged their flight. The leaning head hung threatening o'er the flood, And nodded to the left. The hero stood Averse, with planted feet, and, from the right, Tugged at the solid stone with all his might. Thus heaved, the fixed foundations of the rock Gave way; heaven echoed at the rattling shock. Tumbling, it choked the flood: on either side The banks leap backward, and the streams divide; The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread, And trembling Tiber dived beneath his bed. The court of Cacus stands revealed to sight; The cavern glares with new-admitted light. So the pent vapours, with a rumbling sound, Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground; A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high, The gods with hate behold the nether sky: The ghosts repine at violated night, And curse the invading sun, and sicken at the sight. The graceless monster, caught in open day, Enclosed, and in despair to fly away, Howls horrible from underneath, and fills His hollow palace with unmanly yells. The hero stands above, and from afar Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war. He, from his nostrils and huge mouth, expires Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires, Gathering, with each repeated blast, the night, To make uncertain aim, and erring sight. The wrathful god then plunges from above, And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove, There lights; and wades through fumes, and gropes his way, Half singed, half stifled, till he grasps his prey. The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found; He squeezed his throat; he writhed his neck around, And in a knot his crippled members bound; Then, from their sockets, tore his burning eyes. Rolled on a heap, the breathless robber lies. The doors, unbarred, receive the rushing day, And thorough lights disclose the ravished prey. The bulls, redeemed, breathe open air agen. Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den. The wondering neighbourhood, with glad surprise, Beheld his shagged breast, his giant size, His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguished eyes. From that auspicious day, with rites divine, We worship at the hero's holy shrine. Potitius first ordained these annual vows: As priests, were added the Pinarian house, Who raised this altar in the sacred shade, Where honours, ever due, for ever shall be paid. For these deserts, and this high virtue shown, Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown: Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood, And with deep draughts invoke our common god.” This said, a double wreath Evander twined, And poplars black and white his temples bind. Then brims his ample bowl. With like design The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine. Meantime the sun descended from the skies, And the bright evening-star began to rise. And now the priests, Potitius at their head, In skins of beasts involved, the long procession led; Held high the flaming tapers in their hands, As custom had prescribed their holy bands; Then with a second course the tables load, And with full chargers offer to the god. The Salii sing, and cense his altars round With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound— One choir of old, another of the young, To dance, and bear the burden of the song. The lay records the labours, and the praise, And all the immortal acts of Hercules: First, how the mighty babe, when swathed in bands, The serpents strangled with his infant hands; Then, as in years and matchless force he grew, The Œchalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew. Besides, a thousand hazards they relate, Procured by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate. “Thy hands, unconquered hero, could subdue The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew: Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood, Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood. The triple porter of the Stygian seat, With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet, And, seized with fear, forgot his mangled meat. The infernal waters trembled at thy sight; Thee, god! no face of danger could affright; Not huge Typhöeus, nor the unnumbered snake, Increased with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake. Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace To heaven and the great author of thy race! Receive the grateful offerings which we pay, And smile propitious on thy solemn day!” In numbers thus they sung: above the rest, The den and death of Cacus crown the feast. The woods to hollow vales convey the sound, The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound. The rites performed, the cheerful train retire. Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire, The Trojan passed, the city to survey, And pleasing talk beguiled the tedious way. The stranger cast around his curious eyes, New objects viewing still with new surprise; With greedy joy inquires of various things, And acts and monuments of ancient kings. Then thus the founder of the Roman towers:— “These woods were first the seat of sylvan powers, Of Nymphs and Fauns, and savage men, who took Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak. Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care Of labouring oxen, nor the shining share, Nor arts of gain, nor what they gained to spare. Their exercise the chase; the running flood Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food. Then Saturn came, who fled the power of Jove, Robbed of his realms, and banished from above. The men, dispersed on hills, to towns he brought, And laws ordained, and civil customs taught, And Latium called the land where safe he lay From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway. With his mild empire, peace and plenty came; And hence the golden times derived their name. A more degenerate and discoloured age Succeeded this, with avarice and rage. The Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians, came; And Saturn's empire often changed the name. Then kings—gigantic Tybris, and the rest— With arbitrary sway the land oppressed: For Tiber's flood was Albula before, Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore. I last arrived, driven from my native home, By fortune's power, and fate's resistless doom. Long tossed on seas, I sought this happy land, Warned by my mother nymph, and called by heaven's command.” Thus, walking on, he spoke, and showed the gate, Since called Carmental by the Roman state; Where stood an altar, sacred to the name Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame, Who to her son foretold the Ænean race, Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place;— Then shows the forests, which, in after-times, Fierce Romulus, for perpetrated crimes, A sacred refuge made;—with this, the shrine Where Pan below the rock had rites divine;— Then tells of Argus' death, his murdered guest, Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest. Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads— Now roofed with gold, then thatched with homely reeds. A reverent fear (such superstition reigns Among the rude) even then possessed the swains. Some god, they knew—what god, they could not tell— Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell. The Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw The mighty Thunderer with majestic awe, Who shook his shield, and dealt his bolts around, And scattered tempests on the teeming ground. Then saw two heaps of ruins (once they stood Two stately towns, on either side the flood), Saturnia's and Janiculum's remains; And either place the founder's name retains. Discoursing thus together, they resort Where poor Evander kept his country court. They viewed the ground of Rome's litigious hall (Once oxen lowed, where now the lawyers bawl); Then, stooping, through the narrow gate they pressed, When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:— “Mean as it is, this palace, and this door, Received Alcides, then a conqueror. Dare to be poor; accept our homely food, Which feasted him, and emulate a god.” Then underneath a lowly roof he led The weary prince, and laid him on a bed; The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread. Now Night had shed her silver dews around, And with her sable wings embraced the ground, When love's fair goddess, anxious for her son (New tumults rising, and new wars begun), Couched with her husband in his golden bed, With these alluring words invokes his aid— And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move, Inspires each accent with the charms of love:— “While cruel fate conspired with Grecian powers, To level with the ground the Trojan towers, I asked not aid the unhappy to restore, Nor did the succour of thy skill implore; Nor urged the labours of my lord in vain, A sinking empire longer to sustain, Though much I owed to Priam's house, and more The danger of Æneas did deplore. But now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree, His race is doomed to reign in Italy; With humble suit I beg thy needful art, O still propitious power, that rul'st my heart! A mother kneels a suppliant for her son. By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won To forge impenetrable shields, and grace With fated arms a less illustrious race. Behold, what haughty nations are combined Against the relics of the Phrygian kind, With fire and sword my people to destroy, And conquer Venus twice, in conquering Troy.” She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue, About her unresolving husband threw. Her soft embraces soon infuse desire; His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire; And all the godhead feels the wonted fire. Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies, Or forky lightnings flash along the skies. The goddess, proud of her successful wiles, And conscious of her form, in secret smiles. Then thus the Power, obnoxious to her charms, Panting, and half dissolving in her arms:— “Why seek you reasons for a cause so just, Or your own beauties or my love distrust? Long since, had you required my helpful hand, The artificer and art you might command, To labour arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor Fate, Confined their empire to so short a date. And, if you now desire new wars to wage, My skill I promise, and my pains engage. Whatever melting metals can conspire, Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire, Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove, And think no task is difficult to love.” Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms, He snatched the willing goddess to his arms; Till, in her lap infused, he lay possessed Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest. Now when the night her middle race had rode, And his first slumber had refreshed the god— The time when early housewives leave the bed; When living embers on the hearth they spread, Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise;— With yawning mouths, and with half-opened eyes, They ply the distaff by the winking light, And to their daily labour add the night: Thus frugally they earn their children's bread, And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed— Not less concerned, nor at a later hour, Rose from his downy couch the forging power. Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay, Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare, Raised high on smoking rocks: and, deep below, In hollow caves the fires of Ætna glow. The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal; Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel, Are heard around; the boiling waters roar, And smoky flames through fuming tunnels soar. Hither the father of the fire, by night, Through the brown air precipitates his flight. On their eternal anvils here he found The brethren beating, and the blows go round: A load of pointless thunder now there lies Before their hands, to ripen for the skies: These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast— Consumed on mortals with prodigious waste. Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more, Of winged southern winds and cloudy store As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame; And fears are added, and avenging flame. Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair His broken axle-trees, and blunted war, And send him forth again with furbished arms, To wake the lazy war, with trumpets' loud alarms. The rest refresh the scaly snakes, that fold The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold. Full on the crest the Gorgon's head they place, With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face. “My sons!” said Vulcan, “set your tasks aside; Your strength and master-skill must now be tried. Arms for a hero forge—arms that require Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire.” He said. They set their former work aside, And their new toils with eager haste divide. A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold, And deadly steel, in the large furnace rolled; Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare, Alone sufficient to sustain the war. Seven orbs within a spacious round they close: One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows. The hissing steel is in the smithy drowned; The grot with beaten anvils groans around. By turns, their arms advance in equal time; By turns, their hands descend, and hammers chime. They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs; The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs. While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge Their labours thus, and ply the Æolian forge, The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes, And songs of chirping birds invite to rise. He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet Above his ankles; sandals sheath his feet: He sets his trusty sword upon his side, And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide. Two menial dogs before their master press'd. Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest. Mindful of promised aid, he mends his pace, But meets Æneas in the middle space. Young Pallas did his father's steps attend, And true Achates waited on his friend. They join their hands; a secret seat they chuse; The Arcadian first their former talk renews: “Undaunted prince! I never can believe The Trojan empire lost, while you survive. Command the assistance of a faithful friend: But feeble are the succours I can send. Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds; That other side the Latian state surrounds, Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds. But mighty nations I prepare to join Their arms with yours, and aid your just design. You come, as by your better genius sent, And Fortune seems to favour your intent. Not far from hence there stands a hilly town, Of ancient building, and of high renown, Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race, Who gave the name of Cære to the place, Once Agyllina called. It flourished long, In pride of wealth and warlike people strong, Till cursed Mezentius, in a fatal hour, Assumed the crown, with arbitrary power. What words can paint those execrable times, The subjects' sufferings, and the tyrant's crimes? That blood, those murders, O ye gods! replace On his own head, and on his impious race! The living and the dead, at his command, Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand, Till, choked with stench, in loathed embraces tied, The lingering wretches pined away and died. Thus plunged in ills, and meditating more— The people's patience, tried, no longer bore The raging monster; but with arms beset His house, and vengeance and destruction threat. They fire his palace: while the flame ascends, They force his guards, and execute his friends. He cleaves the crowd, and, favoured by the night, To Turnus' friendly court directs his flight. By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire, With arms, their king to punishment require: Their numerous troops, now mustered on the strand, My counsel shall submit to your command. Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny. An ancient augur, skilled in future fate, With these foreboding words restrains their hate:— “Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flower Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their power, Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms, To seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms! Know this: no native of our land may lead This powerful people; seek a foreign head.” Awed with these words in camps they still abide, And wait with longing looks their promised guide. Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent Their crown, and every regal ornament: The people join their own with his desire; And all my conduct, as their king, require. But the chill blood that creeps within my veins, And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains, And a soul conscious of its own decay, Have forced me to refuse imperial sway. My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne, And should, but he's a Sabine mother's son, And half a native: but, in you, combine A manly vigour, and a foreign line Where Fate and smiling Fortune show the way, Pursue the ready path to sovereign sway. The staff of my declining days, my son, Shall make your good or ill success his own; In fighting fields, from you shall learn to dare, And serve the hard apprenticeship of war; Your matchless courage and your conduct view, And early shall begin to admire and copy you. Besides, two hundred horse he shall command— Though few, a warlike and well-chosen band. These in my name are listed; and my son As many more has added in his own.” Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest, With downcast eyes, their silent grief expressed; Who, short of succours, and in deep despair, Shook at the dismal prospect of the war. But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud, To cheer her issue, thundered thrice aloud; Thrice forky lightning flashed along the sky, And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high. Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear; And in a heaven serene, refulgent arms appear: Reddening the skies, and glittering all around, The tempered metals clash, and yield a silver sound. The rest stood trembling: struck with awe divine, Æneas only, conscious to the sign, Presaged the event, and joyful viewed, above, The accomplished promise of the queen of love. Then, to the Arcadian king:—“This prodigy (Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me. Heaven calls me to the war: the expected sign Is given of promised aid, and arms divine. My goddess mother, whose indulgent care Foresaw the dangers of the growing war, This omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms, Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms, Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshowed Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood. Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn; And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne, Shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms; And, Latian troops, prepare your perjured arms.” He said, and, rising from his homely throne, The solemn rites of Hercules begun, And on his altars waked the sleeping fires; Then cheerful to his household gods retires; There offers chosen sheep. The Arcadian king And Trojan youth the same oblations bring. Next, of his men and ships he makes review; Draws out the best, and ablest of the crew. Down with the falling stream the refuse run, To raise with joyful news his drooping son. Steeds are prepared to mount the Trojan band, Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land. A sprightly courser, fairer than the rest, The king himself presents his royal guest. A lion's hide his back and limbs infold, Precious with studded work, and paws of gold. Fame through the little city spreads aloud The intended march: amid the fearful crowd, The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears, And double their devotion in their fears. The war at hand appears with more affright, And rises every moment to the sight. Then old Evander, with a close embrace, Strained his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face. “Would heaven (said he) my strength and youth recall, Such as I was beneath Præneste's wall— Then when I made the foremost foes retire, And set whole heaps of conquered shields on fire; When Herilus in single fight I slew, Whom with three lives Feronia did endue; And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore, Till the last ebbing soul returned no more— Such if I stood renewed, not these alarms, Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas' arms; Nor proud Mezentius thus, unpunished, boast His rapes and murders on the Tuscan coast. Ye gods! and mighty Jove! in pity bring Relief, and hear a father and a king! If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see My son returned with peace and victory; If the loved boy shall bless his father's sight; If we shall meet again with more delight; Then draw my life in length; let me sustain, In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain. But, if your hard decrees—which, O! I dread— Have doomed to death his undeserving head; This, O! this very moment let me die, While hopes and fears in equal balance lie; While, yet possessed of all his youthful charms, I strain him close within these aged arms— Before that fatal news my soul shall wound!” He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground. His servants bore him off, and softly laid His languished limbs upon his homely bed. The horsemen march; the gates are opened wide; Æneas at their head, Achates by his side. Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along; Last, follows in the rear the Arcadian throng. Young Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest; Gilded his arms, embroidered was his vest. So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head The star, by whom the lights of heaven are led; Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews, Dispels the darkness, and the day renews. The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd, And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud, Which winds disperse by fits, and show from far The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war. The troops, drawn up in beautiful array, O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way. Repeated peals of shouts are heard around; The neighing coursers answer to the sound, And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground. A greenwood shade, for long religion known, Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town, Encompassed round with gloomy hills above, Which add a holy horror to the grove. The first inhabitants, of Grecian blood, That sacred forest to Silvanus vowed, The guardian of their flocks and fields—and pay Their due devotions on his annual day. Not far from hence, along the river's side, In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide, By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground, Æneas cast his wondering eyes around, And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight, Stretched on the spacious plain from left to right. Thither his warlike train the Trojan led, Refreshed his men, and wearied horses fed. Meantime the mother goddess, crowned with charms, Breaks through the clouds, and brings the fated arms. Within a winding vale she finds her son, On the cool river's banks, retired alone. She shows her heavenly form without disguise, And gives herself to his desiring eyes. “Behold (she said) performed, in every part, My promise made, and Vulcan's laboured art. Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy, And haughty Turnus to the field defy.” She said; and, having first her son embraced, The radiant arms beneath an oak she placed. Proud of the gift, he rolled his greedy sight Around the work, and gazed with vast delight. He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires: His hands the fatal sword and corselet hold, One keen with tempered steel, one stiff with gold: Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright; So shines a cloud, when edged with adverse light. He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try The plaited cuishes on his manly thigh; But most admires the shield's mysterious mould, And Roman triumphs rising on the gold: For those, embossed, the heavenly smith had wrought (Not in the rolls of future fate untaught) The wars in order, and the race divine Of warriors issuing from the Julian line. The cave of Mars was dressed with mossy greens: There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins. Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung: The foster-dam lolled out her fawning tongue: They sucked secure, while, bending back her head, She licked their tender limbs, and formed them as they fed. Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games Projected for the rape of Sabine dames. The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds, For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds. Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend; The Romans there with arms the prey defend. Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease; And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace. The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand, Both armed, with each a charger in his hand: A fatted sow for sacrifice is led, With imprecations on the perjured head. Near this, the traitor Metius, stretched between Four fiery steeds, is dragged along the green, By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood; And his torn limbs are left, the vulture's food. There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings, And would by force restore the banished kings. One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights: The Roman youth assert their native rights. Before the town the Tuscan army lies, To win by famine, or by fraud surprise. Their king, half-threatening, half-disdaining stood, While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemmed the flood. The captive maids there tempt the raging tide, 'Scaped from their chains, with Clœlia for their guide. High on a rock heroic Manlius stood, To guard the temple, and the temple's god. Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold The palace thatched with straw, now roofed with gold. The silver goose before the shining gate There flew, and, by her cackle, saved the state. She told the Gauls' approach: the approaching Gauls, Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls. The gold dissembled well their yellow hair, And golden chains on their white necks they wear. Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield, And their left arm sustains a length of shield. Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance; And naked through the streets the mad Luperci dance: In caps of wool; the targets dropt from heaven. Here modest matrons, in soft litters driven, To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear, And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear. Far hence removed, the Stygian seats are seen; Pains of the damned, and punished Catiline, Hung on a rock—the traitor; and, around, The Furies hissing from the nether ground. Apart from these, the happy souls he draws, And Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws. Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea; But foaming surges there in silver play. The dancing dolphins with their tails divide The glittering waves, and cut the precious tide. Amid the main, two mighty fleets engage— Their brazen beaks opposed with equal rage. Actium surveys the well-disputed prize: Leucate's watery plain with foamy billows fries. Young Cæsar, on the stern, in armour bright, Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight: His beamy temples shoot their flames afar, And o'er his head is hung the Julian star. Agrippa seconds him, with prosperous gales, And, with propitious gods, his foes assails. A naval crown, that binds his manly brows, The happy fortune of the fight foreshows. Ranged on the line opposed. Antonius brings Barbarian aids, and troops of Eastern kings, The Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar, Of tongues discordant, and a mingled war: And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife, His ill fate follows him—the Egyptian wife. Moving they fight: with oars and forky prows, The froth is gathered, and the water glows. It seems, as if the Cyclades again Were rooted up, and jostled in the main; Or floating mountains floating mountains meet; Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet. Fireballs are thrown, and pointed javelins fly; The fields of Neptune take a purple dye. The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms, With cymbals tossed, her fainting soldiers warms— Fool as she was! who had not yet divined Her cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind. Her country gods, the monsters of the sky, Great Neptune, Pallas, and love's queen defy. The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain, Nor longer dares oppose the ethereal train. Mars, in the middle of the shining shield, Is graved, and strides along the liquid field. The Diræ souse from heaven with swift descent: And Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent, Divides the press: her steps Bellona treads, And shakes her iron rod above their heads. This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height, Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight The trembling Indians and Egyptians yield, And soft Sabæans quit the watery field. The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails, And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales. Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath, Panting, and pale with fear of future death. The god had figured her, as driven along By winds and waves, and scudding through the throng. Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide His arms and ample bosom to the tide, And spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast, In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host. The victor to the gods his thanks expressed, And Rome triumphant with his presence blessed. Three hundred temples in the town he placed; With spoils and altars every temple graced. Three shining nights, and three succeeding days, The fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise, The domes with songs, the theatres with plays. All altars flame: before each altar lies, Drenched in his gore, the destined sacrifice, Great Cæsar sits sublime upon his throne, Before Apollo's porch of Parian stone; Accepts the presents vowed for victory, And hangs the monumental crowns on high. Vast crowds of vanquished nations march along, Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue. Here, Mulciber assigns the proper place For Carians, and the ungirt Numidian race; Then ranks the Thracians in the second row, With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow. And here the tamed Euphrates humbly glides, And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind. The Danes' unconquered offspring march behind; And Morini, the last of human kind. These figures, on the shield divinely wrought, By Vulcan laboured, and by Venus brought, With joy and wonder fill the hero's thought. Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace, And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race. BOOK IX. ARGUMENT. Turnus takes advantage of Æneas' absence, fires some of his ships (which are transformed into sea-nymphs), and assaults his camp. The Trojans, reduced to the last extremities, send Nisus and Euryalus to recall Æneas; which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship, generosity, and the conclusion of their adventures. While these affairs in distant places passed, The various Iris Juno sends with haste, To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, The secret shade of his great grandsire sought. Retired alone she found the daring man, And oped her rosy lips, and thus began:— “What none of all the gods could grant thy vows— That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. Æneas, gone to seek the Arcadian prince, Has left the Trojan camp without defence; And, short of succours there, employs his pains In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs; Unite thy forces, and attack their lines.” This said, on equal wings she poised her weight, And formed a radiant rainbow in her flight. The Daunian hero lifts his hands and eyes, And thus invokes the goddess as she flies:— “Iris, the grace of heaven! what power divine Has sent thee down, through dusky clouds to shine? See, they divide: immortal day appears, And glittering planets dancing in their spheres! With joy, these happy omens I obey, And follow, to the war, the god that leads the way.” Thus having said, as by the brook he stood, He scooped the water from the crystal flood; Then with his hands the drops to heaven he throws, And loads the powers above with offered vows. Now march the bold confederates through the plain, Well horsed, well clad—a rich and shining train. Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear, The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear. In the main battle, with his flaming crest, The mighty Turnus towers above the rest. Silent they move, majestically slow, Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow. The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far, And the dark menace of the distant war. Caïcus from the rampire saw it rise, Blackening the fields, and thickening through the skies. Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:— “What rolling clouds my friends, approach the walls? Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears, And pointed darts! the Latian host appears.” Thus warned, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend: For their wise general, with foreseeing care, Had charged them not to tempt the doubtful war, Nor, though provoked, in open fields advance, But close within their lines attend their chance. Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command, And sourly wait in arms the hostile band. The fiery Turnus flew before the rest: A piebald steed of Thracian strain he pressed; His helm of massy gold; and crimson was his crest. With twenty horse to second his designs, An unexpected foe, he faced the lines.— “Is there (he said) in arms, who bravely dare His leader's honour and his dangers share?” Then spurring on, his brandished dart he threw, In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue. Amazed to find a dastard race, that run Behind the rampires, and the battle shun, He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes, And stops at every post, and every passage tries. So roams the nightly wolf about the fold: Wet with descending showers, and stiff with cold, He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain (His gnashing teeth are exercised in vain), And, impotent of anger, finds no way In his distended paws to grasp the prey. The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams. Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain, Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain; Surveys each passage with a piercing sight, To force his foes in equal field to fight. Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies, Where, fenced with strong redoubts, their navy lies. Close underneath the walls: the washing tide Secures from all approach this weaker side. He takes the wished occasion, fills his hand With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand. Urged by his presence, every soul is warmed, And every hand with kindled fires is armed. From the fired pines the scattering sparkles fly; Fat vapours, mixed with flames, involve the sky. What power, O Muses, could avert the flame, Which threatened, in the fleet, the Trojan name? Tell: for the fact, through length of time obscure, Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure. 'Tis said, that, when the chief prepared his flight, And felled his timber from Mount Ida's height, The Grandame goddess then approached her son, And with a mother's majesty begun:— “Grant me (she said) the sole request I bring, Since conquered heaven has owned you for its king. On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood, With firs and maples filled, a shady wood; And on the summit rose a sacred grove, Where I was worshipped with religious love. These woods, that holy grove, my long delight, I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight. Now, filled with fear, on their behalf I come; Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves entomb, The floating forests of the sacred pine; But let it be their safety to be mine.” Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls The radiant stars, and heaven and earth controls:— “How dare you, mother, endless date demand For vessels moulded by a mortal hand? What then is fate? Shall bold Æneas ride, Of safety certain, on the uncertain tide? Yet, what I can, I grant: when, wafted o'er, The chief is landed on the Latian shore, Whatever ships escape the raging storms, At my command shall change their fading forms To nymphs divine, and plough the watery way, Like Doto and the daughters of the sea.” To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore, The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore, And Phlegethon's innavigable flood, And the black regions of his brother god. He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod. And now at length the numbered hours were come, Prefixed by fate's irrevocable doom, When the great mother of the gods was free To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree. First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung A light that signed the heavens, and shot along; Then from a cloud, fringed round with golden fires, Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs; And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds, Both hosts, in arms opposed, with equal horror wounds:— “O Trojan race! your needless aid forbear, And know, my ships are my peculiar care. With greater ease the bold Rutulian may, With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea, Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge, Loosed from your crooked anchors, launch at large, Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand, And swim the seas, at Cybele's command.” No sooner had the goddess ceased to speak, When, lo! the obedient ships their hawsers break; And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again: As many beauteous maids the billows sweep, As rode before tall vessels on the deep. The foes, surprised with wonder, stood aghast; Messapus curbed his fiery courser's haste: Old Tiber roared, and, raising up his head, Called back his waters to their oozy bed. Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock, And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:— “These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant, And are by Jove for black presages sent. He takes the cowards' last relief away; For fly they cannot, and, constrained to stay, Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey. The liquid half of all the globe is lost; Heaven shuts the seas, and we secure the coast. Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground, Which myriads of our martial men surround. Their feats I fear not, or vain oracles. 'Twas given to Venus they should cross the seas, And land secure upon the Latian plains: Their promised hour is passed, and mine remains. 'Tis in the fate of Turnus, to destroy, With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy. Shall such affronts as these, alone, inflame The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name? My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife, And final ruin, for a ravished wife. Was't not enough, that, punished for the crime, They fell—but will they fall a second time? One would have thought they paid enough before, To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more. Can they securely trust their feeble wall, A slight partition, a thin interval, Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, though built By hands divine, yet perished by their guilt? Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands, To force from out their lines these dastard bands. Less than a thousand ships will end this war, Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare. Let all the Tuscans, all the Arcadians, join! Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design. Let them not fear the treasons of the night, The robbed Palladium, the pretended flight: Our onset shall be made in open light. No wooden engine shall their town betray; Fires they shall have around, but fires by day. No Grecian babes before their camp appear, Whom Hector's arms detained to the tenth tardy year. Now, since the sun is rolling to the west, Give we the silent night to needful rest: Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare; The morn shall end the small remains of war.” The post of honour to Messapus falls, To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls, To pitch the fires at distances around, And close the Trojans in their scanty ground. Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand, And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command; All clad in shining arms the works invest, Each with a radiant helm and waving crest. Stretched at their length, they press the grassy ground; They laugh, they sing (the jolly bowls go round), With lights and cheerful fires renew the day, And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play. The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld, And with armed legions all the rampires filled. Seized with affright, their gates they first explore; Join works to works with bridges, tower to tower: Thus all things needful for defence abound: Mnestheus and brave Serestus walk the round, Commissioned by their absent prince to share The common danger, and divide the care. The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall, By turns relieve each other on the wall. Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance, To watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance. His father Hyrtacus of noble blood; His mother was a huntress of the wood, And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear, But better skilled unerring shafts to send. Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend— Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast. Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. One was their care, and their delight was one. One common hazard in the war they shared, And now were both by choice upon the guard. Then Nisus thus:—“Or do the gods inspire This warmth, or make we gods of our desire? A generous ardour boils within my breast, Eager of action, enemy to rest: This urges me to fight, and fires my mind, To leave a memorable name behind. Thou seest the foe secure; how faintly shine Their scattered fires: the most, in sleep supine Along the ground, an easy conquest lie: The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply: All hushed around. Now hear what I revolve— A thought unripe—and scarcely yet resolve. Our absent prince both camp and council mourn; By message both would hasten his return: If they confer what I demand on thee (For fame is recompense enough for me), Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied A way that safely will my passage guide.” Euryalus stood listening while he spoke; With love of praise, and noble envy struck; Then to his ardent friend exposed his mind:— “All this, alone, and leaving me behind! Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be joined? Think'st thou I can my share of glory yield, Or send thee unassisted to the field? Not so my father taught my childhood arms— Born in a siege, and bred among alarms. Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend, Nor of the heaven-born hero I attend. The thing, called life, with ease I can disclaim, And think it over-sold to purchase fame.” Then Nisus thus:—“Alas! thy tender years Would minister new matter to my fears. So may the gods, who view this friendly strife, Restore me to thy loved embrace with life, Condemned to pay my vows (as sure I trust), This thy request is cruel and unjust. But if some chance—as many chances are, And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war— If one should reach my head, there let it fall, And spare thy life; I would not perish all. Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date: Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate, To bear my mangled body from the foe, Or buy it back, and funeral rites bestow. Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny, Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply. O! let not me the widow's tears renew, Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue— Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee, Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily, Her age committing to the seas and wind, When every weary matron stayed behind.” To this, Euryalus:—“You plead in vain, And but protract the cause you cannot gain. No more delays! but haste!” With that, he wakes The nodding watch: each to his office takes. The guard relieved, the generous couple went To find the council at the royal tent. All creatures else forgot their daily care, And sleep, the common gift of nature, share; Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate In nightly council for the endangered state. They vote a message to their absent chief, Show their distress, and beg a swift relief. Amid the camp a silent seat they chose, Remote from clamour, and secure from foes. On their left arms their ample shields they bear, Their right reclined upon the bending spear. Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard, And beg admission, eager to be heard— The affair important, not to be deferred. Ascanius bids them be conducted in, Ordering the more experienced to begin. Then Nisus thus:—“Ye fathers, lend your ears; Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years. The foe, securely drenched in sleep and wine, Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine; And, where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies, Covering the plain, and curling to the skies, Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, Close by the sea, a passage we have spied, Which will our way to great Æneas guide. Expect each hour to see him safe again, Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain. Snatch we the lucky minute while we may; Nor can we be mistaken in the way; For, hunting in the vales, we both have seen The rising turrets, and the stream between, And know the winding course, with every ford.” He ceased; and old Aletes took the word:— “Our country gods, in whom our trust we place, Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race, While we behold such dauntless worth appear In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear.” Then into tears of joy the father broke; Each in his longing arms by turns he took; Panted and paused; and thus again he spoke:— “Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we, In recompense of such desert, decree? The greatest, sure, and best you can receive, The gods and your own conscious worth will give. The rest our grateful general will bestow, And young Ascanius, till his manhood, owe.” “And I, whose welfare in my father lies,” Ascanius adds, “by the great deities, By my dear country, by my household gods, By hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes, Adjure you both (on you my fortune stands; That and my faith I plight into your hands), Make me but happy in his safe return, Whose wanted presence I can only mourn; Your common gift shall two large goblets be Of silver, wrought with curious imagery, And high embossed, which, when old Priam reigned, My conquering sire at sacked Arisba gained; And, more, two tripods cast in antique mould, With two great talents of the finest gold; Beside a costly bowl, engraved with art, Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart. But, if in conquered Italy we reign, When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain— Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus pressed, That, Nisus! and his arms, and nodding crest, And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share; Twelve labouring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair, All clad in rich attire, and trained with care; And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains, And a large portion of the king's domains. But thou, whose years are more to mine allied, No fate my vowed affection shall divide From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine; Take full possession; all my soul is thine. One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend: My life's companion, and my bosom friend— My peace shall be committed to thy care; And, to thy conduct, my concerns in war.” Then thus the young Euryalus replied:— “Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide, The same shall be my age, as now my youth; No time shall find me wanting to my truth. This only from your goodness let me gain— (And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain), Of Priam's royal race my mother came— And sure the best that ever bore the name— Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold From me departing, but, o'erspent and old, My fate she followed. Ignorant of this (Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss, Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave, And in this only act of all my life deceive. By this right hand, and conscious night, I swear, My soul so sad a farewell could not bear. Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place (Permit me to presume so great a grace); Support her age, forsaken and distressed. That hope alone will fortify my breast Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears.” He said. The moved assistants melt in tears. Then thus Ascanius, wonder-struck to see That image of his filial piety:— “So great beginnings, in so green an age, Exact the faith which I again engage. Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim, Creüsa had, and only want the name. Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have, 'Tis merit to have borne a son so brave. Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear (My father used it), what, returning here Crowned with success, I for thyself prepare, That, if thou fail, shall thy loved mother share.” He said, and, weeping while he spoke the word, From his broad belt he drew a shining sword, Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made, And in an ivory scabbard sheathed the blade. This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend A lion's hide, his body to defend; And good Aletes furnished him, beside, With his own trusty helm, of temper tried. Thus armed they went. The noble Trojans wait Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears Ascanius, manly far beyond his years, And messages committed to their care, Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air. The trenches first they passed; then took their way Where their proud foes in pitched pavilions lay; To many fatal, ere themselves were slain. They found the careless host dispersed upon the plain, Who, gorged, and drunk with wine, supinely snore. Unharnessed chariots stand along the shore: Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by, A medley of debauch and war, they lie. Observing Nisus showed his friend the sight:— “Behold a conquest gained without a fight. Occasion offers, and I stand prepared; There lies our way: be thou upon the guard, And look around, while I securely go, And hew a passage through the sleeping foe.” Softly he spoke; then, striding, took his way, With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay; His head raised high on tapestry beneath, And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath— A king and prophet, by king Turnus loved; But fate by prescience cannot be removed. Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies. His armour-bearer first, and next he kills His charioteer, intrenched betwixt the wheels And his loved horses; last invades their lord; Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword: The gasping head flies off; a purple flood Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood, Which, by the spurning heels dispersed around, The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground. Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong, He slew, and then Sarranus fair and young. From dice and wine the youth retired to rest, And puffed the fumy god from out his breast: Even then he dreamt of drink and lucky play— More lucky, had it lasted till the day. The famished lion thus, with hunger bold, O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold, And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw. Nor with less rage Euryalus employs The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys: But on the ignoble crowd his fury flew; He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhœtus slew. Oppressed with heavy sleep the former fall, But Rhœtus wakeful, and observing all: Behind a spacious jar he slinked for fear; The fatal iron found and reached him there; For, as he rose, it pierced his naked side, And, reeking, thence returned in crimson dyed. The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood; The purple soul comes floating in the flood. Now, where Messapus quartered, they arrive. The fires were fainting there, and just alive: The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed; Nisus observed the discipline, and said:— “Our eager thirst of blood may both betray; And see the scattered streaks of dawning day, Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend; Here let our glutted execution end. A lane through slaughtered bodies we have made.” The bold Euryalus, though loth, obeyed. Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find A precious load; but these they leave behind. Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay To make the rich caparison his prey, Which on the steed of conquered Rhamnes lay. Nor did his eyes less longingly behold The girdle-belt, with nails of burnished gold. This present Cædicus the rich bestowed On Remulus, when friendship first they vowed, And, absent, joined in hospitable ties: He, dying, to his heir bequeathed the prize; Till, by the conquering Ardean troops oppressed, He fell; and they the glorious gift possessed. These glittering spoils (now made the victor's gain) He to his body suits, but suits in vain. Messapus' helm he finds among the rest, And laces on, and wears the waving crest. Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey, They leave the camp, and take the ready way. But far they had not passed, before they spied Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide. The queen a legion to king Turnus sent; But the swift horse the slower foot out went, And now, advancing, sought the leader's tent. They saw the pair; for, through the doubtful shade, His shining helm Euryalus betrayed, On which the moon with full reflection played. “'Tis not for nought,” cried Volscens from the crowd, “These men go there;” then raised his voice aloud: “Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent? From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?” Silent they scud away, and haste their flight To neighbouring woods, and trust themselves to night. The speedy horse all passages belay, And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way; And watch each entrance of the winding wood. Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood, Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn; Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn. The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey, And fear, misled the younger from his way. But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste, And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest passed, And Alban plains (from Alba's name so called) Where king Latinus then his oxen stalled; Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground, And missed his friend, and cast his eyes around:— “Ah wretch!” he cried—“where have I left behind The unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find? Or what way take?” Again he ventures back, And treads the mazes of his former track. He winds the wood, and, listening, hears the noise Of trampling coursers, and the riders' voice. The sound approached; and suddenly he viewed The foes enclosing, and his friend pursued, Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain The shelter of the friendly shades to gain. What should he next attempt? what arms employ, What fruitless force, to free the captive boy? Or desperate should he rush and lose his life, With odds oppressed, in such unequal strife? Resolved at length, his pointed spear he shook; And, casting on the moon a mournful look,— “Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night! Fair queen!” he said, “direct my dart aright. If e'er my pious father, for my sake, Did grateful offerings on thy altars make, Or I increased them with my sylvan toils, And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils, Give me to scatter these.” Then from his ear He poised, and aimed, and launched the trembling spear. The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove, Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove; Pierced his thin armour, drank his vital blood, And in his body left the broken wood. He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death, And with short sobs he gasps away his breath. All stand amazed:—a second javelin flies With equal strength, and quivers through the skies. This through thy temples, Tagus, forced the way, And in the brain-pan warmly buried lay. Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round, Descried not him who gave the fatal wound, Nor knew to fix revenge:—“But thou,” he cries, “Shalt pay for both,” and at the prisoner flies With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair, That cruel sight the lover could not bear; But from his covert rushed in open view, And sent his voice before him as he flew:— “Me! me!” he cried—“turn all your swords alone On me—the fact confessed, the fault my own. He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth— Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth! His only crime (if friendship can offend) Is too much love to his unhappy friend.” Too late he speaks:—the sword, which fury guides, Driven with full force, had pierced his tender sides. Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound Gushed out a purple stream, and stained the ground. His snowy neck reclines upon his breast, Like a fair flower by the keen share oppressed— Like a white poppy sinking on the plain, Whose heavy head is overcharged with rain. Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vowed, Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd. Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends: Borne back and bored by his surrounding friends, Onward he pressed, and kept him still in sight, Then whirled aloft his sword with all his might: The unerring steel descended while he spoke, Pierced his wide mouth, and through his weasand broke. Dying, he slew; and, staggering on the plain, With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain; Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell, Content, in death, to be revenged so well. O happy friends! for, if my verse can give Immortal life, your fame shall ever live, Fixed as the Capitol's foundation lies, And spread, where'er the Roman eagle flies! The conquering party first divide the prey, Then their slain leader to the camp convey. With wonder, as they went, the troops were filled, To see such numbers whom so few had killed. Sarranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found; Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround; And the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground. All knew the helmet which Messapus lost, But mourned a purchase that so dear had cost. Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed, And with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread: Nor long the sun his daily course withheld, But added colours to the world revealed: When early Turnus, wakening with the light, All clad in armour, calls his troops to fight. His martial men with fierce harangues he fired, And his own ardour in their souls inspired. This done—to give new terror to his foes, The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows, Raised high on pointed spears—a ghastly sight! Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight. Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls: They line their trenches, and they man their walls. In front extended to the left they stood: Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood. But, casting from their towers a frightful view, They saw the faces, which too well they knew, Though then disguised in death, and smeared all o'er With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore. Soon hasty fame through the sad city bears The mournful message to the mother's ears. An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes; Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes. She runs the rampires round amidst the war, Nor fears the flying darts: she rends her hair, And fills with loud laments the liquid air. “Thus, then, my loved Euryalus appears! Thus looks the prop of my declining years! Was't on this face my famished eyes I fed? Ah! how unlike the living is the dead! And could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone? Not one kind kiss from a departing son! No look, no last adieu before he went, In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent! Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay, To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey! Nor was I near to close his dying eyes, To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies, To call about his corpse his crying friends, Or spread the mantle (made for other ends) On his dear body, which I wove with care, Nor did my daily pains or nightly labours spare. Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains His trunk dismembered, and his cold remains? For this, alas! I left my needful ease, Exposed my life to winds, and winter seas! If any pity touch Rutulian hearts, Here empty all your quivers, all your darts: Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe, And send me thunder-struck to shades below!” Her shrieks and clamours pierce the Trojans' ears, Unman their courage, and augment their fears: Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain, Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain, But Actor and Idæus jointly sent, To bear the madding mother to her tent. And now the trumpets terribly, from far, With rattling clangour, rouse the sleepy war. The soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds; And heaven, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds. The Volscians bear their shields upon their head, And, rushing forward, from a moving shed. These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down; Some raise the ladders; others scale the town. But, where void spaces on the walls appear, Or thin defence, they pour their forces there. With poles and missive weapons, from afar, The Trojans keep aloof the rising war. Taught, by their ten years' siege, defensive fight, They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight, To break the penthouse with the ponderous blow, Which yet the patient Volscians undergo— But could not bear the unequal combat long; For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng, The ruin falls: their shattered shields give way, And their crushed heads become an easy prey. They shrink for fear, abated of their rage, Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage— Contented now to gall them from below With darts and slings, and with the distant bow. Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view, A blazing pine within the trenches threw. But brave Messapus, Neptune's warlike son, Broke down the palisades, the trenches won, And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town. Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine, Inspire your poet in his high design, To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made, What souls he sent below the Stygian shade, What fame the soldiers with their captain share, And the vast circuit of the fatal war; For you, in singing martial facts, excel; You best remember, and alone can tell. There stood a tower, amazing to the sight, Built up of beams, and of stupendous height: Art, and the nature of the place, conspired To furnish all the strength that war required. To level this, the bold Italians join; The wary Trojans obviate their design; With weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below, Shoot through the loopholes, and sharp javelins throw. Turnus, the chief, tossed from his thundering hand, Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand: It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high; The planks were seasoned, and the timber dry. Contagion caught the posts; it spread along, Scorched, and to distance drove, the scattered throng. The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain, Still gathering fast upon the trembling train; Till, crowding to the corners of the wall, Down the defence and the defenders fall. The mighty flaw makes heaven itself resound: The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground. The tower, that followed on the fallen crew, Whelmed o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew: Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent; All the same equal ruin underwent. Young Lycus and Helenor only 'scape; Saved—how, they know not—from the steepy leap. Helenor, elder of the two: by birth, On one side royal, one a son of earth, Whom, to the Lydian king, Licymnia bare, And sent her boasted bastard to the war (A privilege which none but freemen share). Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield: No marks of honour charged its empty field. Light as he fell, so light the youth arose, And rising, found himself amidst his foes; Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way. Emboldened by despair, he stood at bay; And, like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds— Resolved on death, he dissipates his fears, And bounds aloft against the pointed spears: So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws His dying body on his thickest foes. But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far, Runs, doubles, winds, and turns, amidst the war; Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind, And snatches at the beam he first can find; Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch, In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach. But Turnus followed hard his hunted prey (His spear had almost reached him in the way, Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind), “Fool!” said the chief, “though fleeter than the wind, Could'st thou presume to 'scape, when I pursue?” He said, and downward by the feet he drew The trembling dastard; at the tug he falls; Vast ruins come along rent from the smoking walls. Thus on some silver swan, or timorous hare, Jove's bird comes sousing down from upper air; Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey: Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way. So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb, In vain lamented by the bleating dam. Then rushing onward with a barbarous cry, The troops of Turnus to the combat fly. The ditch with faggots filled, the daring foe Tossed firebrands to the steepy turrets throw. Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came To force the gate, and feed the kindling flame, Rolled down the fragment of a rock so right, It crushed him double underneath the weight. Two more young Liger and Asylas slew: To bend the bow young Liger better knew; Asylas best the pointed javelin threw. Brave Cæneus laid Ortygius on the plain; The victor Cæneus was by Turnus slain. By the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall, Sagar, and Idas standing on the wall. From Capys' arms his fate Privernus found: Hurt by Temilla first—but slight the wound— His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart, He clapped his hand upon the wounded part: The second shaft came swift and unespied, And pierced his hand, and nailed it to his side, Transfixed his breathing lungs, and beating heart: The soul came issuing out, and hissed against the dart. The son of Arcens shone amid the rest, In glittering armour and a purple vest (Fair was his face, his eyes inspiring love), Bred by his father in the Martian grove, Where the fat altars of Palicus flame, And sent in arms to purchase early fame. Him when he spied from far, the Tuscan king Laid by the lance, and took him to the sling, Thrice whirled the thong around his head, and threw; The heated lead half melted as it flew: It pierced his hollow temples and his brain; The youth came tumbling down, and spurned the plain. Then young Ascanius, who, before this day, Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey, First bent in martial strife the twanging bow, And exercised against a human foe— With this bereft Numanus of his life, Who Turnus' younger sister took to wife. Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride, Vaunting before his troops, and lengthened with a stride, In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied:— “Twice-conquered cowards! now your shame is shown— Cooped up a second time within your town! Who dare not issue forth in open field, But hold your walls before you for a shield. Thus threat you war? thus our alliance force? What gods, what madness, hither steered your course? You shall not find the sons of Atreus here, Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear. Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood, We bear our new-born infants to the flood; There bathed amid the stream, our boys we hold, With winter hardened, and inured to cold. They wake before the day to range the wood, Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquered food. No sports, but what belong to war, they know— To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow. Our youth, of labour patient, earn their bread; Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed. From ploughs and harrows sent to seek renown, They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town. No part of life from toils of war is free, No change in age, or difference in degree. We plough and till in arms: our oxen feel, Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel: The inverted lance makes furrows in the plain. Even time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain— The body, not the mind—nor can control The immortal vigour, or abate the soul. Our helms defend the young, disguise the grey: We live by plunder, and delight in prey. Your vests embroidered with rich purple shine; In sloth you glory, and in dances join. Your vests have sweeping sleeves: with female pride, Your turbans underneath your chins are tied. Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again! Go, less than women, in the shapes of men! Go! mixed with eunuchs in the Mother's rites (Where with unequal sound the flute invites), Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida's shade: Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade.” This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear With patience, or a vowed revenge forbear. At the full stretch of both his hands, he drew, And almost joined, the horns of the tough yew. The first of these lines is all of monosyllables, and both verses are very rough, but of choice; for it had been easy for me to have smoothed them. But either my ear deceives me, or they express the thing which I intended in their sound: for the stress of a bow, which is drawn to the full extent, is expressed in the harshness of the first verse, clogged not only with monosyllables, but with consonants; and these words, the tough yew, which conclude the second line, seem as forceful as they are unharmonious. Homer and Virgil are both frequent in their adapting sounds to the thing they signify. One example will serve for both; because Virgil borrowed the following verses from Homer's Odyssees:— Una Eurusque Notusque ruunt, creberque procellis Africus, et vastos volvunt ad litora fluctus. ??? ?? ???????, ??????? ??????, ????????? ??????, ??? ?????? ????????????, ???? ???? ????????. Our language is not often capable of these beauties, though sometimes I have copied them, of which these verses are an instance. But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood, And thus with lifted hands invoked the god:— “My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed! An annual offering in thy grove shall bleed, A snow-white steer, before thy altar led, Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head, Butts with his threatening brows, and bellowing stands, And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands.” Jove bowed the heavens, and lent a gracious ear, And thundered on the left, amidst the clear. Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies The feathered death, and hisses through the skies. The steel through both his temples forced the way: Extended on the ground, Numanus lay. “Go now, vain boaster! and true valour scorn! The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.” Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake The heavens with shouting, and new vigour take. Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud, To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:— “Advance, illustrious youth! increase in fame, And wide from east to west extend thy name— Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe To thee a race of demigods below. This is the way to heaven: the powers divine From this beginning date the Julian line. To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs, The conquered war is due, and the vast world is theirs. Troy is too narrow for thy name.” He said, And plunging downward shot his radiant head; Dispelled the breathing air, that broke his flight: Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight, Old Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire, Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:— “Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son, The warlike prize thou hast already won. The god of archers gives thy youth a part Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. Now tempt the war no more.” He said, and flew Obscure in air, and vanished from their view. The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know, And hear the twanging of his heavenly bow. Then duteous force they use, and Phœbus' name, To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame. Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun; From wall to wall, the shouts and clamours run; They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around; Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground; And helms, and shields, and rattling arms, resound. The combat thickens, like the storm that flies From westward, when the showery Kids arise; Or pattering hail comes pouring on the main, When Jupiter descends in hardened rain, Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound, And with an armed winter strew the ground. Pand'rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war, Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare On Ida's top—two youths of height and size Like firs that on their mother mountain rise— Presuming on their force, the gates unbar, And of their own accord invite the war, With fates averse, against their king's command. Armed, on the right and on the left they stand, And flank the passage: shining steel they wear, And waving crests above their heads appear. Thus two tall oaks, that Padus' banks adorn, Lift up to heaven their leafy heads unshorn, And, overpressed with nature's heavy load, Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod. In flows a tide of Latians, when they see The gate set open, and the passage free; Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on, Aquicolus, that in bright armour shone, And Hæmon first: but soon repulsed they fly, Or in the well-defended pass they die. These with success are fired, and those with rage, And each on equal terms at length engage. Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain, The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain. Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought, When suddenly the unhoped-for news was brought, The foes had left the fastness of their place Prevailed in fight, and had his men in chase. He quits the attack, and, to prevent their fate, Runs, where the giant brothers guard the gate. The first he met, Antiphates the brave (But base-begotten on a Theban slave— Sarpedon's son), he slew: the deadly dart, Found passage through his breast, and pierced his heart. Fixed in the wound the Italian cornel stood, Warmed in his lungs, and in his vital blood. Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies, And Meropes, and the gigantic size Of Bitias, threatening with his ardent eyes. Not by the feeble dart he fell oppressed (A dart were lost within that roomy breast), But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong, Which roared like thunder as it whirled along: Not two bull-hides the impetuous force withhold, Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold. Down sunk the monster-bulk, and pressed the ground (His arms and clattering shield on the vast body sound), Not with less ruin than the Baian mole, Raised on the seas, the surges to control— At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall; Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall Of the vast pile; the scattered ocean flies; Black sands, discoloured froth, and mingled mud, arise: The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores: Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars: Typhöeus, thrown beneath by Jove's command, Astonished at the flaw that shakes the land, Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake, With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back. The warrior god the Latian troops inspired, New strung their sinews, and their courage fired, But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright: Then black despair precipitates their flight. When Pandarus beheld his brother killed, The town with fear and wild confusion filled, He turns the hinges of the heavy gate With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight; Some happier friends within the walls enclosed; The rest shut out, to certain death exposed: Fool as he was, and frantic in his care, To admit young Turnus, and include the war! He thrust amid the crowd, securely bold, Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold. Too late his blazing buckler they descry, And sparkling fires that shot from either eye, His mighty members, and his ample breast, His rattling armour, and his crimson crest. Far from that hated face the Trojans fly, All but the fool who sought his destiny. Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vowed For Bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:— “These are not Ardea's walls, nor this the town Amata proffers with Lavinia's crown: 'Tis hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft, No means of safe return by flight are left.” To whom, with countenance calm, and soul sedate, Thus Turnus:—“Then begin, and try thy fate: My message to the ghost of Priam bear; Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there.” A lance of tough ground-ash the Trojan threw, Rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew: With his full force he whirled it first around; But the soft yielding air received the wound: Imperial Juno turned the course before, And fixed the wandering weapon in the door. “But hope not thou,” said Turnus, “when I strike, To shun thy fate: our force is not alike, Nor thy steel tempered by the Lemnian god.” Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood And aimed from high: the full descending blow Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two. Down sinks the giant with a thundering sound: His ponderous limbs oppress the trembling ground; Blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound. Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides; And the shared visage hangs on equal sides. The Trojans fly from their approaching fate: And, had the victor then secured the gate, And, to his troops without, unclosed the bars, One lucky day had ended all his wars. But boiling youth, and blind desire of blood, Push on his fury, to pursue the crowd. Hamstringed behind, unhappy Gyges died; Then Phalaris is added to his side. The pointed javelins from the dead he drew, And their friends' arms against their fellows threw. Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phegeus flies; Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies. Then Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall— Engaged against the foes who scaled the wall: But, whom they feared without, they found within. At last, though late, by Lynceus he was seen. He calls new succours, and assaults the prince: But weak his force, and vain is their defence. Turned to the right, his sword the hero drew, And at one blow the bold aggressor slew. He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong, The helm flies off, and bears the head along. Next him, the huntsman Amycus he killed, In darts envenomed and in poison skilled. Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear, And Cretheus, whom the Muses held so dear: He fought with courage, and he sung the fight; Arms were his business, verses his delight. The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief, Their slaughtered friends, and hasten their relief. Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train, Whom brave Serestus and his troop sustain. To save the living, and revenge the dead, Against one warrior's arms all Troy they led. “O, void of sense and courage!” Mnestheus cried, “Where can you hope your coward heads to hide? Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run? One man, and in your camp enclosed, you shun! Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast, And pass unpunished from a numerous host? Forsaking honour, and renouncing fame, Your gods, your country, and your king, you shame!” This just reproach their virtue does excite: They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight. Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield, But with slow paces measures back the field, And inches to the walls, where Tiber's tide, Washing the camp, defends the weaker side. The more he loses, they advance the more, And tread in every step he trod before. They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight. As, compassed with a wood of spears around, The lordly lion still maintains his ground; Grins horrible, retires, and turns again; Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane; He loses while in vain he presses on, Nor will his courage let him dare to run: So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight, Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight. Yet twice, enraged, the combat he renews, Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues. But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied, Come rolling on, and rush from every side: Nor Juno, who sustained his arms before, Dares with new strength suffice the exhausted store; For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down, To force the invader from the frighted town. With labour spent, no longer can he wield The heavy falchion, or sustain the shield, O'erwhelmed with darts, which from afar they fling: The weapons round his hollow temples ring: His golden helm gives way, with stony blows Battered, and flat, and beaten to his brows. His crest is rashed away; his ample shield Is falsified, and round with javelins filled. When I read this Æneïd to many of my friends in company together, most of them quarrelled at the word falsified, as an innovation in our language. The fact is confessed; for I remember not to have read it in any English author, though perhaps it may be found in Spenser's Faerie Queene; but, suppose it be not there, why am I forbidden to borrow from the Italian (a polished language) the word which is wanting in my native tongue? Terence has often Grecised; Lucretius has followed his example, and pleaded for it— Sic quia me cogit patrii sermonis egestas. Virgil has confirmed it by his frequent practice; and even Cicero in prose, wanting terms of philosophy in the Latin tongue, has taken them from Aristotle's Greek. Horace has given us a rule for coining words, si Græco fonte cadant; especially when other words are joined with them which explain the sense. I use the word falsify in this place to mean, that the shield of Turnus was not of proof against the spears and javelins of the Trojans, which had pierced it through and through (as we say) in many places. The words which accompany this new one make my meaning plain, according to the precept which Horace gave. But I said I borrowed the word from the Italian. Vide Ariosto, Cant. 26— Ma sì l'usbergo d'ambi era perfetto, Che mai poter falsario in nessun canto. Falsar cannot otherwise be turned than by falsified; for his shield was falsed is not English. I might, indeed, have contented myself with saying, his shield was pierced, and bored, and stuck with javelins, nec sufficit umbo ictibus. They who will not admit a new word may take the old; the matter is not worth dispute. The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm; And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm. Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at every pore; With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er; Shorter and shorter every gasp he takes; And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes. Armed as he was, at length he leaped from high, Plunged in the flood, and made the waters fly. The yellow god the welcome burden bore, And wiped the sweat, and washed away the gore; Then gently wafts him to the farther coast, And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host. BOOK X. ARGUMENT. Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party. At Æneas' return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Æneas, Lausus and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus, as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heaven unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all the inferior world. From first to last, The sovereign senate in degrees are placed. Then thus the almighty sire began:—“Ye gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes! From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first designed? Why thus protracted war, when my commands Pronounced a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heavens, and arms our powers on different sides? A lawful time of war at length will come (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contest the world with Rome; Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then is your time for faction and debate, For partial favour, and permitted hate. Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.” Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus replies at large:— “O power immense! eternal energy! (For to what else protection can we fly?) Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare In fields, unpunished, and insult my care? How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train, In shining arms triumphant on the plain? Even in their lines and trenches they contend, And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend: The town is filled with slaughter, and o'erfloats, With a red deluge, their increasing moats. Æneas, ignorant, and far from thence, Has left a camp exposed, without defence. This endless outrage shall they still sustain? Shall Troy renewed be forced and fired again? A second siege my banished issue fears, And a new Diomede in arms appears. One more audacious mortal will be found; And I, thy daughter, wait another wound. Yet, if, with fates averse, without thy leave, The Latian lands my progeny receive, Bear they the pains of violated law, And thy protection from their aid withdraw. But, if the gods their sure success foretell— If those of heaven consent with those of hell, To promise Italy; who dare debate The power of Jove, or fix another fate? What should I tell of tempests on the main, Of Æolus usurping Neptune's reign? Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat To inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet? Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends, Solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends. That new example wanted yet above— An act that well became the wife of Jove! Alecto, raised by her, with rage inflames The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames. Imperial sway no more exalts my mind (Such hopes I had indeed, while heaven was kind), Now let my happier foes possess my place, Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race; And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace. Since you can spare, from all your wide command, No spot of earth, no hospitable land, Which may my wandering fugitives receive (Since haughty Juno will not give you leave), Then, father (if I still may use that name), By ruined Troy, yet smoking from the flame, I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care, Be freed from danger, and dismissed the war: Inglorious let him live, without a crown: The father may be cast on coasts unknown, Struggling with fate; but let me save the son. Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian towers: In those recesses, and those sacred bowers, Obscurely let him rest; his right resign To promised empire, and his Julian line. Then Carthage may the Ausonian towns destroy, Nor fear the race of a rejected boy. What profits it my son, to 'scape the fire, Armed with his gods, and loaded with his sire; To pass the perils of the seas and wind; Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind; To reach the Italian shores; if, after all, Our second Pergamus is doomed to fall? Much better had he curbed his high desires, And hovered o'er his ill-extinguished fires. To Simoïs' banks the fugitives restore, And give them back to war, and all the woes before.” Deep indignation swelled Saturnia's heart: “And must I own,” she said, “my secret smart— What with more decence were in silence kept, And, but for this unjust reproach, had slept? Did god or man your favourite son advise, With war unhoped the Latians to surprise? By fate, you boast, and by the gods' decree, He left his native land for Italy! Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more Than heaven, inspired, he sought a foreign shore. Did I persuade to trust his second Troy To the raw conduct of a beardless boy, With walls unfinished, which himself forsakes, And through the waves a wandering voyage takes? When have I urged him meanly to demand The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land? Did I or Iris give this mad advice? Or made the fool himself the fatal choice? You think it hard, the Latians should destroy With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy! Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw Their native air, nor take a foreign law! That Turnus is permitted still to live, To whom his birth a god and goddess give! But yet 'tis just and lawful for your line To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join; Realms, not your own, among your clans divide, And from the bridegroom tear the promised bride; Petition, while you public arms prepare; Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war! 'Twas given to you, your darling son to shroud, To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd, And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud. From flaming fleets you turned the fire away, And changed the ships to daughters of the sea. But 'tis my crime—the queen of heaven offends, If she presume to save her suffering friends! Your son, not knowing what his foes decree, You say, is absent: absent let him be. Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian towers, The soft recesses, and the sacred bowers. Why do you then these needless arms prepare, And thus provoke a people prone to war? Did I with fire the Trojan town deface, Or hinder from return your exiled race? Was I the cause of mischief, or the man, Whose lawless lust the fatal war began? Think on whose faith the adulterous youth relied; Who promised, who procured, the Spartan bride? When all the united states of Greece combined, To purge the world of the perfidious kind, Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate:— Your quarrels and complaints are now too late.” Thus Juno. Murmurs rise, with mixed applause, Just as they favour or dislike the cause. So winds, when yet unfledged in woods they lie, In whispers first their tender voices try, Then issue on the main with bellowing rage, And storms to trembling mariners presage. Then thus to both replied the imperial god, Who shakes heaven's axles with his awful nod. (When he begins, the silent senate stand, With reverence listening to the dread command: The clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain; And the hushed waves lie flatted on the main.) “Celestials! your attentive ears incline! Since (said the god) the Trojans must not join In wished alliance with the Latian line— Since endless jarrings and immortal hate, Tend but to discompose our happy state— The war henceforward be resigned to fate: Each to his proper fortune stand or fall; Equal and unconcerned I look on all. Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me; And both shall draw the lots their fates decree. Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend; And, if she favours those, let those defend:— The Fates will find their way.” The Thunderer said; And shook the sacred honours of his head, Attesting Styx, the inviolable flood, And the black regions of his brother god. Trembled the poles of heaven, and earth confessed the nod. This end the sessions had: the senate rise, And to his palace wait their sovereign through the skies. Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes Within their walls the Trojan host enclosed: They wound, they kill, they watch at every gate; Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate. The Æneans wish in vain their wanted chief, Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief. Thin on the towers they stand; and even those few, A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew. Yet in the face of danger some there stood: The two bold brothers of Sarpedon's blood, Asius and Acmon: both the Assaraci; Young Hæmon, and, though young, resolved to die. With these were Clarus and Thymœtes joined; Thymbris and Castor, both of Lycian kind. From Acmon's hands a rolling stone there came, So large, it half deserved a mountain's name! Strong-sinewed was the youth, and big of bone: His brother Mnestheus could not more have done, Or the great father of the intrepid son. Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send; And some with darts, and some with stones, defend. Amid the press appears the beauteous boy, The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy. His lovely face unarmed, his head was bare; In ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair. His forehead circled with a diadem; Distinguished from the crowd he shines a gem, Enchased in gold, or polished ivory set, Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet. Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war, Directing ointed arrows from afar, And death with poison armed—in Lydia born, Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn; Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands, And leaves a rich manure of golden sands. There Capys, author of the Capuan name, And there was Mnestheus too, increased in fame, Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame. Thus mortal war was waged on either side. Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide: For, anxious, from Evander when he went, He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon's tent; Exposed the cause of coming to the chief; His name and country told, and asked relief; Proposed the terms; his own small strength declared; What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepared; What Turnus, bold and valiant, designed; Then showed the slippery state of humankind, And fickle fortune; warned him to beware, And to his wholesome counsel added prayer. Tarchon, without delay the treaty signs, And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins, They soon set sail; nor now the Fates withstand; Their forces trusted with a foreign hand. Æneas leads; upon his stern appear Two lions carved, which rising Ida bear— Ida, to wandering Trojans ever dear. Under their grateful shade Æneas sate, Revolving war's events, and various fate. His left young Pallas kept, fixed to his side, And oft of winds inquired, and of the tide; Oft of the stars, and of their watery way; And what he suffered both by land and sea. Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring! The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing, The poet here begins to tell the names of the Tuscan captains who followed Æneas to the war: and I observe him to be very particular in the description of their persons, and not forgetful of their manners; exact also in the relation of the numbers which each of them command. I doubt not but as, in the Fifth Book, he gave us the names of the champions who contended for the several prizes, that he might oblige many of the most ancient Roman families, their descendants,—and as, in the Seventh Book, he mustered the auxiliary forces of the Latins on the same account,—so here he gratifies his Tuscan friends with the like remembrance of their ancestors, and, above the rest, Mæcenas, his great patron, who, being of a royal family in Etruria, was probably represented under one of the names here mentioned, then known among the Romans, though, at so great a distance, unknown to us. And, for his sake chiefly, as I guess, he makes Æneas (by whom he always means Augustus) to seek for aid in the country of Mæcenas, thereby to endear his protector to his emperor, as if there had been a former friendship betwixt their lines. And who knows, but Mæcenas might pretend that the Cilnian family was derived from Tarchon, the chief commander of the Tuscans? Which followed great Æneas to the war: Their arms, their numbers, and their names, declare. A thousand youths brave Massicus obey, Borne in the Tiger through the foaming sea; From Clusium brought, and Cosa, by his care: For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear. Fierce Abas next: his men bright armour wore: His stern Apollo's golden statue bore. Six hundred Populonia sent along, All skilled in martial exercise, and strong. Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins, An isle renowned for steel, and unexhausted mines. Asylas on his prow the third appears, Who heaven interprets, and the wandering stars; From offered entrails, prodigies expounds, And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds. A thousand spears in warlike order stand, Sent by the Pisans under his command. Fair Astur follows in the watery field, Proud of his managed horse, and painted shield. Gravisca, noisome from the neighbouring fen, And his own Cære, sent three hundred men; With those which Minio's fields, and Pyrgi gave, All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave. Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew, And brave Cupavo followed but by few; Whose helm confessed the lineage of the man, And bore, with wings displayed, a silver swan. Love was the fault of his famed ancestry, Whose forms and fortunes in his ensign fly. For Cycnus loved unhappy Phaëthon, And sung his loss in polar groves, alone, Beneath the sister shades, to sooth his grief. Heaven heard his song, and hastened his relief, And changed to snowy plumes his hoary hair, And winged his flight, to chant aloft in air. His son Cupavo brushed the briny flood; Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood, Who heaved a rock, and, threatening still to throw, With lifted hands alarmed the seas below: They seemed to fear the formidable sight, And rolled their billows on, to speed his flight. Ocnus was next, who led his native train Of hardy warriors through the watery plain— The son of Manto, by the Tuscan stream, From whence the Mantuan town derives the name— An ancient city, but of mixed descent: Three several tribes compose the government; Four towns are under each; but all obey The Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway. Hate to Mezentius armed five hundred more, Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore— Mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead covered o'er. These grave Aulestes leads: a hundred sweep With stretching oars at once the glassy deep. Him, and his martial train, the Triton bears; High on his poop the sea-green god appears: Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound, And at the blast the billows dance around. A hairy man above the waist he shows; A porpoise-tail beneath his belly grows; And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides, And froth and foam augment the murmuring tides. Full thirty ships transport the chosen train, For Troy's relief, and scour the briny main. Now was the world forsaken by the sun, And Phœbe half her nightly race had run. The careful chief, who never closed his eyes, Himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies. A choir of Nereids meet him on the flood, These were transformed from ships to sea-nymphs. This is almost as violent a machine as the death of Arruns by a goddess in the episode of Camilla. But the poet makes use of it with greater art; for here it carries on the main design. These new-made divinities not only tell Æneas what had passed in his camp during his absence, and what was the present distress of his besieged people, and that his horsemen, whom he had sent by land, were ready to join him at his descent; but warn him to provide for battle the next day, and foretell him good success: so that this episodical machine is properly a part of the great poem; for, besides what I have said, they push on his navy with celestial vigour, that it might reach the port more speedily, and take the enemy more unprovided to resist the landing; whereas the machine relating to Camilla is only ornamental; for it has no effect, which I can find, but to please the reader, who is concerned that her death should be revenged. Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida's wood; But now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep, As rode, before, tall vessels on the deep. They know him from afar; and in a ring Enclose the ship that bore the Trojan king. Cymodoce, whose voice excelled the rest, Above the waves advanced her snowy breast; Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides The curling ocean, and corrects the tides. She spoke for all the choir; and thus began, With pleasing words, to warn the unknowing man:— “Sleeps our loved lord? O goddess-born! awake! Spread every sail, pursue your watery track, And haste your course. Your navy once were we, From Ida's height descending to the sea; Till Turnus, as at anchor fixed we stood, Presumed to violate our holy wood. Then, loosed from shore, we fled his fires profane (Unwillingly we broke our master's chain), And since have sought you through the Tuscan main. The mighty Mother changed her forms to these, And gave us life immortal in the seas. But young Ascanius, in his camp distressed, By your insulting foes is hardly pressed. The Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host, Advance in order on the Latian coast: To cut their way the Daunian chief designs, Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines. Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light, First arm thy soldiers for the ensuing fight: Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield, And bear aloft the impenetrable shield. To-morrow's sun, unless my skill be vain, Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain.” Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force Pushed on the vessel in her watery course; For well she knew the way. Impelled behind, The ship flew forward, and outstript the wind. The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause, The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws. Then thus he prayed, and fixed on heaven his eyes:— “Hear thou, great Mother of the deities, With turrets crowned! (on Ida's holy hill, Fierce tigers, reined, and curbed, obey thy will.) Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight; And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right.” He said no more. And now renewing day Had chased the shadows of the night away. He charged the soldiers, with preventing care, Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare; Warned of the ensuing fight, and bade them hope the war. Now, from his lofty poop, he viewed below His camp encompassed, and the enclosing foe. His blazing shield, embraced, he held on high; The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply. Hope arms their courage: from their towers they throw Their darts with double force, and drive the foe. Thus, at the signal given, the cranes arise Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies. King Turnus wondered at the fight renewed, Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he viewed, The seas with swelling canvas covered o'er, And the swift ships descending on the shore. The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes, The radiant crest that seemed in flames to rise, And dart diffusive fires around the field, And the keen glittering of the golden shield. Thus threatening comets, when by night they rise, Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies: So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights, Pale human kind with plagues and with dry famine frights. Yet Turnus, with undaunted mind is bent To man the shores, and hinder their descent, And thus awakes the courage of his friends:— “What you so long have wished, kind Fortune sends— In ardent arms to meet the invading foe: You find, and find him at advantage now. Yours is the day: you need but only dare; Your swords will make you masters of the war. Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands, And dearest wives, are all within your hands. Be mindful of the race from whence you came, And emulate in arms your fathers' fame. Now take the time, while staggering yet they stand With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand: Fortune befriends the bold.” No more he said, But balanced, whom to leave, and whom to lead; Then these elects, the landing to prevent; And those he leaves, to keep the city pent. Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore: Some are by boats exposed, by bridges more. With labouring oars they bear along the strand, Where the tide languishes, and leap a-land. Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes, And, where no ford he finds, no water fries, Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar, But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore, That course he steered, and thus he gave command: “Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land: Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground. Let me securely land—I ask no more; Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore.” This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends: They tug at every oar, and every stretcher bends: They run their ships aground; the vessels knock (Thus forced ashore), and tremble with the shock. Tarchon's alone was lost, and stranded stood: Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood, She breaks her back; the loosened sides give way, And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea. Their broken oars and floating planks withstand Their passage, while they labour to the land, And ebbing tides bear back upon the uncertain sand. Nor Turnus leads his troops without delay, Advancing to the margin of the sea. The trumpets sound: Æneas first assailed The clowns new-raised and raw, and soon prevailed. Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight— Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height. He first in open fields defied the prince: But armour scaled with gold was no defence Against the fated sword, which opened wide His plated shield, and pierced his naked side. Next Lichas fell, who, not like others born, Was from his wretched mother ripped and torn; Sacred, O Phœbus! from his birth to thee; For his beginning life from biting steel was free. Not far from him was Gyas laid along, Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong: Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assailed, Nor valour nor Herculean arms availed, Nor their famed father, wont in war to go With great Alcides, while he toiled below. The noisy Pharos next received his death: Æneas writhed his dart, and stopped his bawling breath. Then wretched Cydon had received his doom, Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom, And sought with lust obscene polluted joys— The Trojan sword had cured his love of boys, Had not his seven bold brethren stopped the course Of the fierce champion, with united force. Seven darts were thrown at once; and some rebound From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound: The rest had reached him; but his mother's care Prevented those, and turned aside in air. The prince then called Achates, to supply The spears, that knew the way to victory— “Those fatal weapons, which, inured to blood, In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood: Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain Against our foes, on this contended plain.” He said; then seized a mighty spear, and threw; Which, winged with fate, through Mæon's buckler flew, Pierced all the brazen plates, and reached his heart: He staggered with intolerable smart. Alcanor saw; and reached, but reached in vain, His helping hand, his brother to sustain. A second spear, which kept the former course, From the same hand, and sent with equal force, His right arm pierced, and holding on, bereft His use of both, and pinioned down his left. Then Numitor from his dead brother drew The ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw: Preventing fate directs the lance awry, Which, glancing, only marked Achates' thigh. In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came, And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim. The spear flew hissing through the middle space, And pierced his throat, directed at his face; It stopped at once the passage of his wind, And the free soul to flitting air resigned: His forehead was the first that struck the ground; Life-blood and life rushed mingled through the wound. He slew three brothers of the Borean race, And three, whom Ismarus, their native place, Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace. Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads: The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds, Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand, These fight to keep, and those to win, the land. With mutual blood the Ausonian soil is dyed, While on its borders each their claim decide. As wintry winds, contending in the sky, With equal force of lungs their titles try: They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heaven Stands without motion, and the tide undriven: Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield, They long suspend the fortune of the field. Both armies thus perform what courage can; Foot set to foot, and crowded, man to man. But, in another part, the Arcadian horse With ill success engage the Latin force: For, where the impetuous torrent, rushing down, Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown, They left their coursers, and, unused to fight On foot, were scattered in a shameful flight. Pallas, who, with disdain and grief, had viewed His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued, Used threatenings mixed with prayers, his last resource, With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force. “Which way, companions? whither would you run? By you yourselves, and mighty battles won, By my great sire, by his established name, And early promise of my future fame; By my youth, emulous of equal right To share his honours—shun ignoble flight! Trust not your feet: your hands must hew your way Through yon black body, and that thick array: 'Tis through that forward path that we must come; There lies our way, and that our passage home. Nor powers above, nor destinies below, Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go, With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe. See on what foot we stand! a scanty shore— The sea behind, our enemies before; No passage left, unless we swim the main; Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain.” This said, he strode with eager haste along, And bore amidst the thickest of the throng. Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe, Had heaved a stone of mighty weight, to throw: Stooping, the spear descended on his chine, Just where the bone distinguished either loin: It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay, That scarce the victor forced the steel away. Hisbo came on: but, while he moved too slow To wished revenge, the prince prevents his blow; For, warding his at once, at once he pressed, And plunged the fatal weapon in his breast. Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust, Who stained his stepdame's bed with impious lust. And, after him, the Daunian twins were slain, Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain; So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size, As caused an error in their parents' eyes— Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides The nice distinction, and their fate divides: For Thymbrus' head was lopped; and Laris' hand, Dismembered, sought its owner on the strand: The trembling fingers yet the falchion strain, And threaten still the extended stroke in vain. Now, to renew the charge, the Arcadians came: Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame, And grief, with anger mixed, their minds inflame. Then, with a casual blow was Rhœteus slain, Who chanced, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain: The flying spear was after Ilus sent; But Rhœteus happened on a death unmeant: From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled, The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead: Rolled from his chariot with a mortal wound, And intercepted fate, he spurned the ground. As when, in summer, welcome winds arise, The watchful shepherd to the forest flies, And fires the midmost plant; contagion spreads, And catching flames infect the neighbouring heads; Around the forest flies the furious blast, And all the leafy nation sinks at last, And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste; The pastor, pleased with his dire victory, Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:— So Pallas' troops their scattered strength unite, And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight. Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood; But first collected in his arms he stood: Advancing then, he plied the spear so well, Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell. Around his head he tossed his glittering brand, And from Strymonius hewed his better hand, Held up to guard his throat; then hurled a stone At Thoas' ample front, and pierced the bone: It struck beneath the space of either eye; And blood, and mingled brains, together fly. Deep skilled in future fates, Halesus' sire Did with the youth to lonely groves retire: But, when the father's mortal race was run, Dire destiny laid hold upon the son, And hauled him to the war, to find, beneath The Evandrian spear, a memorable death. Pallas the encounter seeks, but, ere he throws, To Tuscan Tiber thus addressed his vows:— “O sacred stream! direct my flying dart, And give to pass the proud Halesus' heart: His arms and spoils the holy oak shall bear.” Pleased with the bribe, the god received his prayer: For, while his shield protects a friend distressed, The dart came driving on, and pierced his breast. But Lausus, no small portion of the war, Permits not panic fear to reign too far, Caused by the death of so renowned a knight; But by his own example cheers the fight. Fierce Abas first he slew—Abas, the stay Of Trojan hopes, and hinderance of the day. The Phrygian troops escaped the Greeks in vain: They, and their mixed allies, now load the plain. To the rude shock of war both armies came; Their leaders equal, and their strength the same. The rear so pressed the front, they could not wield Their angry weapons, to dispute the field. Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there: Of equal youth and beauty both appear, But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air. Their congress in the field great Jove withstands— Both doomed to fall, but fall by greater hands. Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief Of Lausus' danger, urging swift relief. With his driven chariot he divides the crowd, And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:— “Let none presume his needless aid to join; Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine: To this right hand is Pallas only due; Oh! were his father here, my just revenge to view!” From the forbidden space his men retired. Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admired; Surveyed him o'er and o'er with wondering sight, Struck with his haughty mien, and towering height. Then to the king:—“Your empty vaunts forbear; Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear. Alive, or dead, I shall deserve a name; Jove is impartial, and to both the same.” He said, and to the void advanced his pace: Pale horror sat on each Arcadian face. Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light, Addressed himself on foot to single fight. And, as a lion—when he spies from far A bull that seems to meditate the war, Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand— Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand: Imagine eager Turnus not more slow, To rush from high on his unequal foe. Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance Within due distance of his flying lance, Prepares to charge him first—resolved to try If fortune would his want of force supply; And thus to heaven and Hercules addressed:— “Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest! His son adjures you by those holy rites, That hospitable board, those genial nights; Assist my great attempt to gain this prize, And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes, His ravished spoils.” 'Twas heard, the vain request; Alcides mourned, and stifled sighs within his breast. Then Jove, to sooth his sorrow, thus began:— “Short bounds of life are set to mortal man. 'Tis virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span. So many sons of gods, in bloody fight Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light: My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe; Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow. I have mentioned this passage in my preface to the Æneïs, to prove that fate was superior to the gods, and that Jove could neither defer nor alter its decrees. Sir Robert Howard has since been pleased to send me the concurrent testimony of Ovid: it is in the last book of his Metamorphoses, where Venus complains that her descendant, Julius Cæsar, was in danger of being murdered by Brutus and Cassius, at the head of the commonwealth faction, and desires [the gods] to prevent that barbarous assassination. They are moved to compassion; they are concerned for Cæsar; but the poet plainly tells us that it was not in their power to change destiny. All they could do was to testify their sorrow for his approaching death by foreshowing it by signs and prodigies, as appears by the following lines:— Talia necquidquam toto Venus anxia cælo Verba jacit; superosque movet: qui rumpere quanquam Ferrea non possunt veterum decreta sororum, Signa tamen luctûs dant haud incerta futuri. Then she addresses to her father, Jupiter, hoping aid from him, because he was thought omnipotent. But he, it seems, could do as little as the rest; for he answers thus:— — sola insuperabile Fatum, Nata, movere paras? Intres licet ipsa sororum Tecta trium; cernes illic, molimine vasto, Ex ære et solido rerum tabularia ferro, Quæ neque concursum cæli, neque fulminis iram, Nec metuunt ullas, tuta atque æterna, ruinas. Invenies illic, incisa adamante perenni, Fata tui generis. Legi ipse, animoque notavi; Et referam, ne sis etiamnum ignara futuri. Hic sua complevit (pro quo, Cytherea, laboras) Tempora, perfectis, quos terræ debuit, annis, etc. Jupiter, you see, is only library keeper, or custos rotulorum, to the Fates: for he offers his daughter a cast of his office, to give her a sight of their decrees, which the inferior gods were not permitted to read without his leave. This agrees with what I have said already in the preface; that they, not having seen the records, might believe they were his own handwriting, and consequently at his disposing, either to blot out or alter, as he saw convenient. And of this opinion was Juno in those words, tua, qui potes, orsa reflectas. Now the abode of those Destinies being in hell, we cannot wonder why the swearing by Styx was an inviolable oath amongst the gods of heaven, and that Jupiter himself should fear to be accused of forgery by the Fates, if he altered anything in their decrees; Chaos, Night, and Erebus being the most ancient of the deities, and instituting those fundamental laws by which he was afterwards to govern. Hesiod gives us the genealogy of the gods; and I think I may safely infer the rest. I will only add, that Homer was more a fatalist than Virgil; for it has been observed that the word ????, or Fortune, is not be to found in his two poems; but, instead of it, always ?????. Even Turnus shortly shall resign his breath And stands already on the verge of death.” This said, the god permits the fatal fight, But from the Latian fields averts his sight. Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw, And, having thrown, his shining falchion drew. The steel just grazed along the shoulder-joint, And marked it slightly with the glancing point. Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew, And poised his pointed spear, before he threw: Then, as the winged weapon whizzed along, “See now,” said he, “whose arm is better strung.” The spear kept on the fatal course, unstayed By plates of iron, which o'er the shield were laid: Through folded brass, and tough bull-hides, it passed, His corselet pierced, and reached his heart at last. In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood; The soul comes issuing with the vital blood: He falls; his arms upon his body sound; And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground. Turnus bestrode the corpse:—“Arcadians, hear,” Said he; “my message to your master bear: Such as the sire deserved, the son I send; It costs him dear to be the Phrygian's friend. The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow Unasked, to rest his wandering ghost below.” He said, and trampled down, with all the force Of his left foot, and spurned the wretched corse; Then snatched the shining belt, with gold inlaid— The belt Eurytion's artful hands had made, Where fifty fatal brides, expressed to sight, All in the compass of one mournful night, Deprived their bridegrooms of returning light. In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore. O mortals! blind in fate, who never know To bear high fortune, or endure the low! The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain, Shall wish untouched the trophies of the slain— Shall wish the fatal belt were far away, And curse the dire remembrance of the day. The sad Arcadians, from the unhappy field, Bear back the breathless body on a shield. O grace and grief of war! at once restored, With praises, to thy sire, at once deplored. One day first sent thee to the fighting field, Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle killed; One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield. This dismal news, not from uncertain fame, But sad spectators, to the hero came: His friends upon the brink of ruin stand, Unless relieved by his victorious hand. He whirls his sword around, without delay, And hews through adverse foes an ample way, To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud. Evander, Pallas, all that friendship owed To large deserts, are present to his eyes— His plighted hand, and hospitable ties. Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred, He took in fight, and living victims led, To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire, In sacrifice, before his funeral fire. At Magus next he threw: he stooped below The flying spear, and shunned the promised blow, Then, creeping, clasped the hero's knees, and prayed: “By young Iulus, by thy father's shade, O! spare my life, and send me back to see My longing sire, and tender progeny. A lofty house I have, and wealth untold, In silver ingots, and in bars of gold: All these, and sums besides, which see no day, The ransom of this one poor life shall pay. If I survive, shall Troy the less prevail? A single soul's too light to turn the scale.” He said. The hero sternly thus replied:— “Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside, Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke All rules of war by one relentless stroke, When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone, My father's shadow, but my living son.” Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft, He seized his helm, and dragged him with his left; Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreathed, Up to the hilts his shining falchion sheathed. Apollo's priest, Hæmonides, was near; His holy fillets on his front appear; Glittering in arms, he shone amidst the crowd, Much of his god, more of his purple, proud. Him the fierce Trojan followed through the field: The holy coward fell; and, forced to yield, The prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow, Sent him an offering to the shades below. His arms Serestus on his shoulders bears, Designed a trophy to the god of wars. Vulcanian Cæculus renews the fight, And Umbro born upon the mountain's height. The champion cheers his troops to encounter those, And seeks revenge himself on other foes. At Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow, Both shield and arm to ground together go. Anxur had boasted much of magic charms, And thought he wore impenetrable arms, So made by muttered spells; and, from the spheres, Had life secured, in vain, for length of years. Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod; A nymph his mother, and his sire a god. Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince: With his protended lance he makes defence; Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on, Arrests his better hand, and drags him down; Stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and (as he lay, Vain tales inventing, and prepared to pray) Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood, Then sunk, and rolled along the sand in blood. The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain:— “Lie there, proud man, unpitied on the plain; Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb, Far from thy mother and thy native home, Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey, Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea.” On Lucas and Antæus next he ran, Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van. They fled for fear; with these, he chased along Camers the yellow-locked, and Numa strong; Both great in arms, and both were fair and young. Camers was son to Volscens lately slain, In wealth surpassing all the Latian train, And in Amyclæ fixed his silent easy reign. And, as Ægæon, when with heaven he strove, Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove; Moved all his hundred hands, provoked the war, Defied the forky lightning from afar; At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires, And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires; In his right hand as many swords he wields, And takes the thunder on as many shields: With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood; And soon the fields with falling corpse were strowed, When once his falchion found the taste of blood. With fury scarce to be conceived, he flew Against Niphæus, whom four coursers drew. They, when they see the fiery chief advance, And pushing at their chests his pointed lance, Wheeled with so swift a motion, mad with fear, They threw their master headlong from the chair. They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before They bear the bounding chariot to the shore. Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains, With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins, And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains— Bold brethren both. The former waved in air His flaming sword: Æneas couched his spear, Unused to threats, and more unused to fear. Then Liger thus:—“Thy confidence is vain To 'scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain: Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode, Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode; Nor Venus' veil is here, nor Neptune's shield; Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field.” Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer Returned his answer with his flying spear. As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends, Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends, Prepared for fight—the fatal dart arrives, And through the border of his buckler drives; Passed through, and pierced his groin. The deadly wound, Cast from his chariot, rolled him on the ground: Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:— “Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight; Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat; But you yourself forsake your empty seat.” He said, and seized at once the loosened rein; For Liger lay already on the plain By the same shock; then, stretching out his hands, The recreant thus his wretched life demands:— “Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man! By her and him from whom thy breath began, Who formed thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's prayer.” Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said; But the stern hero turned aside his head, And cut him short:—“I hear another man; You talked not thus before the fight began. Now take your turn; and, as a brother should, Attend your brother to the Stygian flood.” Then through his breast his fatal sword he sent, And the soul issued at the bloody vent. As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground, Thus raged the prince, and scattered deaths around. At length Ascanius, and the Trojan train, Broke from the camp, so long besieged in vain. Meantime the king of gods and mortal man Held conference with his queen, and thus began:— “My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife, Still think you Venus' aid supports the strife— Sustains her Trojans—or themselves, alone, With inborn valour force their fortune on? How fierce in fight, with courage undecayed! Judge if such warriors want immortal aid.” To whom the goddess with the charming eyes, Soft in her tone, submissively replies:— “Why, O my sovereign lord, whose frown I fear, And cannot, unconcerned, your anger bear— Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still (As once I was) were mistress of your will, From your almighty power your pleasing wife Might gain the grace of lengthening Turnus' life, Securely snatch him from the fatal fight, And give him to his aged father's sight. Now let him perish, since you hold it good, And glut the Trojans with his pious blood. Yet from our lineage he derives his name, And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came! Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine, And offers daily incense at your shrine.” Then shortly thus the sovereign god replied:— “Since in my power and goodness you confide, If, for a little space, a lengthened span, You beg reprieve for this expiring man, I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence From instant fate, and can so far dispense. But, if some secret meaning lies beneath, To save the short-lived youth from destined death, Or, if a further thought you entertain, To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain.” To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:— “And what if that request, your tongue denies, Your heart should grant—and not a short reprieve, But length of certain life, to Turnus give? Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth, If my presaging soul divines with truth; Which, O! I wish, might err through causeless fears, And you (for you have power) prolong his years!” Thus having said, involved in clouds, she flies, And drives a storm before her through the skies. Swift she descends, alighting on the plain, Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain. Of air condensed, a spectre soon she made; And, what Æneas was, such seemed the shade. Adorned with Dardan arms, the phantom bore His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore: This hand appeared a shining sword to wield, And that sustained an imitated shield. With manly mien he stalked along the ground, Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound. (Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight, Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.) The spectre seems the Daunian chief to dare, And flourishes his empty sword in air. At this, advancing, Turnus hurled his spear: The phantom wheeled, and seemed to fly for fear. Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled, And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed. “Whither, O coward?” (thus he calls aloud, Nor found he spoke to wind, and chased a cloud), “Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me The fated land you sought so long by sea.” He said, and, brandishing at once his blade, With eager pace pursued the flying shade. By chance a ship was fastened to the shore, Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore: The plank was ready laid for safe ascent; For shelter there the trembling shadow bent, And skipped and skulked, and under hatches went. Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste, Ascends the plank, and to the galley passed. Scarce had he reached the prow; Saturnia's hand The hawsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land. With wind in poop, the vessel ploughs the sea, And measures back with speed her former way. Meantime Æneas seeks his absent foe, And sends his slaughtered troops to shades below. The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud, And flew sublime, and vanished in a cloud. Too late young Turnus the delusion found, Far on the sea, still making from the ground. Then, thankless for a life redeemed by shame, With sense of honour stung, and forfeit fame, Fearful besides of what in fight had passed, His hands and haggard eyes to heaven he cast:— “O Jove!” he cried—“for what offence have I Deserved to bear this endless infamy? Whence am I forced, and whither am I borne? How, and with what reproach, shall I return? Shall ever I behold the Latian plain, Or see Laurentum's lofty towers again? What will they say of their deserting chief? The war was mine: I fly from their relief! I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave; And even from hence their dying groans receive. Here, overmatched in fight, in heaps they lie, There, scattered o'er the fields, ignobly fly. Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive! Or, oh! ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve! On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive; Or set me shipwrecked on some desert shore, Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more— Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious fame, Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.” Thus Turnus raved, and various fates revolved: The choice was doubtful, but the death resolved. And now the sword, and now the sea, took place— That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace. Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main, By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain. Thrice he the sword essayed, and thrice the flood; But Juno, moved with pity, both withstood, And thrice repressed his rage; strong gales supplied, And pushed the vessel o'er the swelling tide. At length she lands him on his native shores, And to his father's longing arms restores. Meantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius armed, Succeeding Turnus, with his ardour warmed His fainting friends, reproached their shameful flight, Repelled the victors, and renewed the fight. Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire; Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire Of wished revenge—on him, and him alone, All hands employed, and all their darts are thrown. He, like a solid rock by seas enclosed, To raging winds and roaring waves opposed, From his proud summit looking down, disdains Their empty menace, and unmoved remains. Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead, Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled. At Latagus a weighty stone he flung: His face was flatted, and his helmet rung. But Palmus from behind receives his wound: Hamstringed he falls, and grovels on the ground: His crest and armour, from his body torn, Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head, adorn. Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew. Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew— Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire, The queen produced young Paris to his sire. But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain, Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain. And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred, With forest mast and fattening marshes fed, When once he sees himself in toils enclosed, By huntsmen and their eager hounds opposed, He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war, The invaders dart their javelins from afar: All keep aloof, and safely shout around; But none presumes to give a nearer wound: He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide, And shakes a grove of lances from his side: Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspired, And just revenge against the tyrant fired, Their darts with clamour at a distance drive, And only keep the languished war alive. From Corythus came Acron to the fight, Who left his spouse betrothed, and unconsummate night. Mezentius sees him through the squadron ride, Proud of the purple favours of his bride. Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds, Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain— He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane; He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws: The prey lies panting underneath his paws: He fills his famished maw; his mouth runs o'er With unchewed morsels, while he churns the gore: So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes, And first unhappy Acron overthrows: Stretched at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground; The lance, besmeared with blood, lies broken in the wound. Then with disdain the haughty victor viewed Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued, Nor thought the dastard's back deserved a wound, But, running, gained the advantage of the ground: Then turning short, he met him face to face, To give his victory the better grace. Orodes falls, in equal fight oppressed: Mezentius fixed his foot upon his breast, And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:— “Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!” The fields around with “Iö Pæan!” ring; And peals of shouts applaud the conquering king. At this the vanquished, with his dying breath, Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:— “Nor thou, proud man, unpunished shalt remain. Like death attends thee on this fatal plain.” Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:— “For what belongs to me, let Jove provide; But die thou first, whatever chance ensue.” He said, and from the wound the weapon drew. A hovering mist came swimming o'er his sight, And sealed his eyes in everlasting night. By Cædicus, Alcathöus was slain; Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain; Orses the strong to greater strength must yield; He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo killed. Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew, Who from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew. But from his headstrong horse his fate he found, Who threw his master, as he made a bound: The chief, alighting, struck him to the ground; Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails: The Trojan sinks, and Neptune's son prevails. Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride, To single fight the boldest foe defied; Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame, And not belied his mighty father's fame. Salius to death the great Authronius sent: But the same fate the victor underwent, Slain by Nealces' hand, well skilled to throw The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow. Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance: By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance, Victors and vanquished in the various field, Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield. The gods from heaven survey the fatal strife, And mourn the miseries of human life. Above the rest, two goddesses appear Concerned for each: here Venus, Juno there. Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes. Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain, Brandished his spear, and rushed into the plain, Where towering in the midmost ranks he stood, Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood (When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves, His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves), Or like a mountain-ash, whose roots are spread, Deep fixed in earth—in clouds he hides his head. The Trojan prince beheld him from afar, And dauntless undertook the doubtful war. Collected in his strength, and like a rock Poised on his base, Mezentius stood the shock, He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries:— “My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke! (Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.) His armour, from the Trojan pirate torn, By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn.” He said; and with his utmost force he threw The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew, Reached the celestial shield: that stopped the course; But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force Took a new bent obliquely, and, betwixt The side and bowels, famed Antores fixed. Antores had from Argos travelled far, Alcides' friend, and brother of the war; Till, tired with toils, fair Italy he chose, And in Evander's palace sought repose. Now falling by another's wound, his eyes He casts to heaven, on Argos thinks, and dies. The pious Trojan then his javelin sent; The shield gave way; through treble plates it went Of solid brass, of linen trebly rolled, And three bull-hides which round the buckler rolled. All these it passed, resistless in the course, Transpierced his thigh, and spent its dying force. The gaping wound gushed out a crimson flood. The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood, His falchion drew, to closer fight addressed, And with new force his fainting foe oppressed. His father's peril Lausus viewed with grief; He sighed, he wept, he ran to his relief. And here, heroic youth, 'tis here I must To thy immortal memory be just, And sing an act so noble and so new, Posterity will scarce believe 'tis true. Pained with his wound, and useless for the fight, The father sought to save himself by flight: Encumbered, slow he dragged the spear along, Which pierced his thigh, and in his buckler hung. The pious youth, resolved on death, below The lifted sword, springs forth to face the foe; Protects his parent, and prevents the blow. Shouts of applause ran ringing through the field, To see the son the vanquished father shield. All, fired with generous indignation, strive, And with a storm of darts, to distance drive The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far, On his Vulcanian orb sustained the war. As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind, The ploughman, passenger, and labouring hind, For shelter to the neighbouring covert fly, Or, housed, or safe in hollow caverns, lie; But, that o'erblown, when heaven above them smiles, Return to travail, and renew their toils: Æneas thus, o'erwhelmed on every side, The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide; And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threatening cried:— “Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age, Betrayed by pious love?”—Nor, thus forborne, The youth desists, but with insulting scorn Provokes the lingering prince, whose patience, tired, Gave place; and all his breast with fury fired. For now the Fates prepared their cruel shears; And lifted high the flaming sword appears, Which, full descending with a frightful sway, Through shield and corselet forced the impetuous way, And buried deep in his fair bosom lay. The purple streams through the thin armour strove, And drenched the embroidered coat his mother wove; And life at length forsook his heaving heart, Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart. But when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread, The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead, He grieved; he wept (the sight an image brought Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought), Then stretched his hand to hold him up, and said:— “Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid To love so great, to such transcendent store Of earthly worth, and sure presage of more? Accept whate'er Æneas can afford; Untouched thy arms, untaken be thy sword; And all that pleased the living, still remain Inviolate, and sacred to the slain. Thy body on thy parents I bestow, To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know, Or have a sense of human things below. There to thy fellow-ghosts with glory tell, 'Twas by the great Æneas' hand I fell.” With this, his distant friends he beckons near, Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear: Himself assists to lift him from the ground, With clotted locks, and blood that welled from out the wound. Meantime, his father, now no father, stood, And washed his wounds, by Tiber's yellow flood: Oppressed with anguish, panting, and o'erspent, His fainting limbs against an oak he leant. A bough his brazen helmet did sustain; His heavier arms lay scattered on the plain: A chosen train of youth around him stand; His drooping head was rested on his hand: His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought; And all on Lausus ran his restless thought. Careful, concerned his danger to prevent, He much inquired, and many a message sent To warn him from the field—alas! in vain! Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain! O'er his broad shield still gushed the yawning wound, And drew a bloody trail along the ground. Far off he heard their cries, far off divined The dire event with a foreboding mind. With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head; Then both his lifted hands to heaven he spread; Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:— “What joys, alas! could this frail being give, That I have been so covetous to live? To see my son, and such a son, resign His life, a ransom for preserving mine? And am I then preserved, and art thou lost? How much too dear has that redemption cost! 'Tis now my bitter banishment I feel: This is a wound too deep for time to heal. My guilt thy growing virtues did defame; My blackness blotted thy unblemished name. Chased from a throne, abandoned, and exiled For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild: I owed my people these, and, from their hate, With less resentment could have borne my fate. And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight Of hated men, and of more hated light— But will not long.” With that he raised from ground His fainting limbs, that staggered with his wound; Yet, with a mind resolved, and unappalled With pains or perils, for his courser called— Well-mouthed, well-managed, whom himself did dress With daily care, and mounted with success— His aid in arms, his ornament in peace. Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke, The steed seemed sensible, while thus he spoke:— “O Rhœbus! we have lived too long for me— If life and long were terms that could agree. This day thou either shalt bring back the head And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead— This day thou either shalt revenge my woe, For murdered Lausus, on his cruel foe; Or, if inexorable Fate deny Our conquest, with thy conquered master die: For, after such a lord, I rest secure, Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load, endure.” He said; and straight the officious courser kneels, To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills With pointed javelins; on his head he laced His glittering helm, which terribly was graced With waving horse-hair, nodding from afar; Then spurred his thundering steed amidst the war. Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought, Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought Of inborn worth, his labouring soul oppressed, Rolled in his eyes, and raged within his breast. Then loud he called Æneas thrice by name: The loud repeated voice to glad Æneas came. “Great Jove,” he said, “and the far-shooting god, Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!” He spoke no more, but hastened, void of fear, And threatened with his long protended spear. To whom Mezentius thus:—“Thy vaunts are vain. My Lausus lies extended on the plain: He's lost! thy conquest is already won; The wretched sire is murdered in the son. Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy. Forbear thy threats: my business is to die; But first receive this parting legacy.” He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent; Another after, and another, went. Round in a spacious ring he rides the field, And vainly plies the impenetrable shield. Thrice rode he round; and thrice Æneas wheeled, Turned as he turned: the golden orb withstood The strokes, and bore about an iron wood. Impatient of delay, and weary grown, Still to defend, and to defend alone, To wrench the darts which in his buckler light, Urged, and o'er-laboured in unequal fight— At length resolved, he throws, with all his force, Full at the temples of the warrior horse. Just where the stroke was aimed, the unerring spear Made way, and stood transfixed through either ear. Seized with unwonted pain, surprised with fright, The wounded steed curvets, and, raised upright, Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind. Down comes the rider headlong from his height: His horse came after with unwieldy weight, And, floundering forward, pitching on his head, His lord's encumbered shoulder overlaid. From either host, the mingled shouts and cries Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies: Æneas, hastening, waved his fatal sword High o'er his head, with this reproachful word:— “Now! where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?” Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies With scarce recovered sight he thus replies:— “Why these insulting words, this waste of breath, To souls undaunted, and secure of death? 'Tis no dishonour for the brave to die: Nor came I here with hope of victory; Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design. As I had used my fortune, use thou thine. My dying son contracted no such band; The gift is hateful from his murderer's hand. For this, this only favour let me sue, If pity can to conquered foes be due, Refuse it not; but let my body have The last retreat of human kind, a grave. Too well I know the insulting people's hate; Protect me from their vengeance after fate: This refuge for my poor remains provide, And lay my much-loved Lausus by my side.” He said, and to the sword his throat applied. The crimson stream distained his arms around, And the disdainful soul came rushing through the wound. BOOK XI. ARGUMENT. Æneas erects a trophy of the spoils of Mezentius, grants a truce for burying the dead, and sends home the body of Pallas with great solemnity. Latinus calls a council, to propose offers of peace to Æneas; which occasions great animosity betwixt Turnus and Drances. In the meantime there is a sharp engagement of the horse; wherein Camilla signalises herself, is killed; and the Latine troops are entirely defeated. Scarce had the rosy morning raised her head Above the waves, and left her watery bed; The pious chief, whom double cares attend For his unburied soldiers and his friend, Yet first to heaven performed a victor's vows: He bared an ancient oak of all her boughs; Then on a rising ground the trunk he placed, Which with the spoils of his dead foe he graced. The coat-of-arms by proud Mezentius worn, Now on a naked snag in triumph borne, Was hung on high, and glittered from afar, A trophy sacred to the god of war. Above his arms, fixed on the leafless wood, Appeared his plumy crest, besmeared with blood: His brazen buckler on the left was seen; Truncheons of shivered lances hung between; And on the right was placed his corselet, bored; And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword. A crowd of chiefs enclose the godlike man, Who thus, conspicuous in the midst, began:— “Our toils, my friends, are crowned with sure success; The greater part performed, achieve the less. Now follow cheerful to the trembling town; Press but an entrance, and presume it won. Fear is no more: For fierce Mezentius lies, As the first-fruits of war, a sacrifice. Turnus shall fall extended on the plain, And, in this omen, is already slain. Prepared in arms, pursue your happy chance; That none unwarned may plead his ignorance, And I, at heaven's appointed hour, may find Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind. Meantime the rites and funeral pomps prepare, Due to your dead companions of the war— The last respect the living can bestow, To shield their shadows from contempt below. That conquered earth be theirs, for which they fought, And which for us with their own blood they bought. But first the corpse of our unhappy friend To the sad city of Evander send, Who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom Was hurried hence by too severe a doom.” Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay. Acœtes watched the corpse; whose youth deserved The father's trust; and now the son he served With equal faith, but less auspicious care. The attendants of the slain his sorrow share. A troop of Trojans mixed with these appear, And mourning matrons with dishevelled hair. Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky. They rear his drooping forehead from the ground; But, when Æneas viewed the grisly wound Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore, And the fair flesh distained with purple gore; First, melting into tears, the pious man Deplored so sad a sight, then thus began:— “Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest Of my full wishes she refused the best! She came; but brought not thee along, to bless My longing eyes, and share in my success: She grudged thy safe return, the triumphs due To prosperous valour, in the public view. Not thus I promised, when thy father lent Thy needless succour with a sad consent; Embraced me, parting for the Etrurian land, And sent me to possess a large command. He warned, and from his own experience told, Our foes were warlike, disciplined, and bold. And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return, Rich odours on his loaded altars burn, While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare To send him back his portion of the war, A bloody breathless body, which can owe No further debt, but to the powers below. The wretched father, ere his race is run, Shall view the funeral honours of his son! These are my triumphs of the Latian war, Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care! And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see A son, whose death disgraced his ancestry: Thou shalt not blush, old man, however grieved: Thy Pallas no dishonest wound received. He died no death to make thee wish, too late, Thou hadst not lived to see his shameful fate. But what a champion has the Ausonian coast, And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!” Thus having mourned, he gave the word around, To raise the breathless body from the ground; And chose a thousand horse, the flower of all His warlike troops, to wait the funeral, To bear him back and share Evander's grief— A well-becoming, but a weak relief. Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier, Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear. The body on this rural hearse is borne: Strewed leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn. All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flower, New cropt by virgin hands, to dress the bower: Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below, No more to mother earth or the green stem shall owe. Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost, Of purple woven, and with gold embossed, For ornament the Trojan hero brought, Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought. One vest arrayed the corpse; and one they spread O'er his closed eyes, and wrapped around his head, That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall, The catching fire might burn the golden caul. Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain, When he descended on the Latian plain— Arms, trappings, horses—by the hearse are led In long array—the achievements of the dead. Then, pinioned with their hands behind, appear The unhappy captives, marching in the rear, Appointed offerings in the victor's name, To sprinkle with their blood the funeral flame. Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne; Gauntlets and helms their heads and hands adorn; And fair inscriptions fixed, and titles read Of Latian leaders conquered by the dead. Acœtes on his pupil's corpse attends, With feeble steps, supported by his friends. Pausing at every pace, in sorrow drowned, Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground; Where grovelling while he lies in deep despair, He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair. The champion's chariot next is seen to roll, Besmeared with hostile blood, and honourably foul. To close the pomp, Æthon, the steed of state, Is led, the funerals of his lord to wait. Stripped of his trappings, with a sullen pace He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face. The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest, Are borne behind:—the victor seized the rest. The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound; The pikes and lances trail along the ground. Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse To Pallantean towers direct their course, In long procession ranked; the pious chief Stopped in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:— “The public care,” he said, “which war attends, Diverts our present woes, at least suspends. Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell! Hail, holy reliques! and a last farewell!” He said no more, but, inly though he mourned, Restrained his tears, and to the camp returned. Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand A truce, with olive-branches in their hand; Obtest his clemency, and from the plain Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain. They plead, that none those common rites deny To conquered foes, that in fair battle die. All cause of hate was ended in their death; Nor could he war with bodies void of breath. A king, they hoped, would hear a king's request, Whose son he once was called, and once his guest. Their suit, which was too just to be denied, The hero grants, and further thus replied:— “O Latian princes! how severe a fate In causeless quarrels has involved your state, And armed against an unoffending man, Who sought your friendship ere the war began! You beg a truce, which I would gladly give, Not only for the slain, but those who live. I came not hither but by heaven's command, And sent by fate to share the Latian land. Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied My proffered friendship, and my promised bride; Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try His cause in arms, to conquer or to die. My right and his are in dispute: the slain Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain. In equal arms let us alone contend; And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. This is the way (so tell him) to possess The royal virgin, and restore the peace. Bear this my message back—with ample leave, That your slain friends may funeral rites receive.” Thus having said—the ambassadors, amazed, Stood mute a while, and on each other gazed. Drances, their chief, who harboured in his breast Long hate to Turnus, as his foe professed, Broke silence first, and to the god-like man, With graceful action bowing, thus began:— “Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name, But yet whose actions far transcend your fame! Would I your justice or your force express, Thought can but equal; and all words are less. Your answer we shall thankfully relate, And favours granted to the Latian state. If wished success our labour shall attend, Think peace concluded, and the king your friend: Let Turnus leave the realm to your command, And seek alliance in some other land: Build you the city which your fates assign; We shall be proud in the great work to join.” Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade The rest empowered, that soon a truce is made. Twelve days the term allowed: and, during those, Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes, Mixed in the woods, for funeral piles prepare To fell the timber, and forget the war. Loud axes through the groaning groves resound; Oak, mountain-ash, and poplar spread the ground; Firs fall from high; and some the trunks receive In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave. And now the fatal news by Fame is blown Through the short circuit of the Arcadian town, Of Pallas slain—, by Fame, which just before His triumphs on distended pinions bore. Rushing from out the gate, the people stand, Each with a funeral flambeau in his hand. Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze: The fields are lightened with a fiery blaze, That casts a sullen splendour on their friends— The marching troop which their dead prince attends. Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry; The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply, And their mixed mourning rends the vaulted sky. The town is filled with tumult and with tears, Till the loud clamours reach Evander's ears: Forgetful of his state, he runs along, With a disordered pace, and cleaves the throng; Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies, With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes. Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:— “O Pallas! thou hast failed thy plighted word! To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword, I warned thee, but in vain; for well I knew What perils youthful ardour would pursue— That boiling blood would carry thee too far, Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war! O curst essay of arms! disastrous doom! Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come! Hard elements of inauspicious war! Vain vows to heaven, and unavailing care! Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed! Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled— Præscious of ills, and leaving me behind, To drink the dregs of life by fate assigned. Beyond the goal of nature I have gone: My Pallas late set out, but reached too soon. If, for my league against the Ausonian state, Amidst their weapons I had found my fate (Deserved from them), then I had been returned A breathless victor, and my son had mourned. Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid, Nor grudge the alliance I so gladly made. 'Twas not his fault, my Pallas fell so young, But my own crime for having lived too long. Yet, since the gods had destined him to die, At least, he led the way to victory: First for his friends he won the fatal shore, And sent whole herds of slaughtered foes before— A death too great, too glorious to deplore. Nor will I add new honours to thy grave, Content with those the Trojan hero gave— That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends designed, In which the Tuscan chiefs and army joined. Great spoils and trophies, gained by thee, they bear: Then let thy own achievements be thy share. Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, Whose mighty trunk had better graced the wood, If Pallas had arrived, with equal length Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. But why, unhappy man! dost thou detain These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain? Go, friends! this message to your lord relate: Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, And, after Pallas' death, live lingering on, 'Tis to behold his vengeance for my son. I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head Is owing to the living and the dead. My son and I expect it from his hand; 'Tis all that he can give, or we demand. Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, To greet my Pallas with such news below.” The morn had now dispelled the shades of night, Restoring toils, when she restored the light. The Trojan king, and Tuscan chief, command To raise the piles along the winding strand. Their friends convey the dead to funeral fires; Black smouldering smoke from the green wood expires; The light of heaven is choked, and the new day retires. Then thrice around the kindled piles they go (For ancient custom had ordained it so); Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led; And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead. Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw The spoils, in battle taken from the foe— Helms, bitts embossed, and swords of shining steel; One casts a target, one a chariot-wheel; Some to their fellows their own arms restore— The falchions which in luckless fight they bore, Their bucklers pierced, their darts bestowed in vain, And shivered lances gathered from the plain. Whole herds of offered bulls, about the fire, And bristled boars, and woolly sheep, expire. Around the piles a careful troop attends, To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends— Lingering along the shore, till dewy night New decks the face of heaven with starry light. The conquered Latians, with like pious care, Piles without number for their dead prepare. Part, in the places where they fell, are laid; And part are to the neighbouring fields conveyed. The corps of kings, and captains of renown, Borne off in state, are buried in the town; The rest, unhonoured, and without a name, Are cast a common heap to feed the flame. Trojans and Latians vie with like desires To make the field of battle shine with fires, And the promiscuous blaze to heaven aspires. Now had the morning thrice renewed the light, And thrice dispelled the shadows of the night, When those who round the wasted fires remain, Perform the last sad office to the slain. They rake the yet warm ashes from below; These, and the bones unburned, in earth bestow; These relics with their country rites they grace, And raise a mount of turf to mark the place. But, in the palace of the king, appears A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears. Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans; Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons. All in that universal sorrow share, And curse the cause of this unhappy war— A broken league, a bride unjustly sought, A crown usurped, which with their blood is bought! These are the crimes, with which they load the name Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim: “Let him, who lords it o'er the Ausonian land, Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand: His is the gain; our lot is but to serve; 'Tis just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve.” This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite, His foe expects, and dares him to the fight. Nor Turnus wants a party, to support His cause and credit in the Latian court. His former acts secure his present fame, And the queen shades him with her mighty name. While thus their factious minds with fury burn, The legates from the Ætolian prince return: Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost And care employed, their embassy is lost; That Diomede refused his aid in war, Unmoved with presents, and as deaf to prayer. Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought, Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought. Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late, A foreign son is pointed out by fate; And, till Æneas shall Lavinia wed, The wrath of heaven is hovering o'er his head. The gods, he saw, espoused the juster side, When late their titles in the field were tried: Witness the fresh laments, and funeral tears undried. Thus full of anxious thought, he summons all The Latian senate to the council-hall. The princes come, commanded by their head, And crowd the paths that to the palace lead. Supreme in power, and reverenced for his years, He takes the throne, and in the midst appears. Majestically sad, he sits in state, And bids his envoys their success relate. When Venulus began, the murmuring sound Was hushed, and sacred silence reigned around. “We have,” said he, “performed your high command, And passed with peril a long tract of land: We reached the place desired; with wonder filled, The Grecian tents and rising towers beheld. Great Diomede has compassed round with walls The city, which Argyripa he calls, From his own Argos named. We touched, with joy, The royal hand that razed unhappy Troy. When introduced, our presents first we bring, Then crave an instant audience from the king. His leave obtained, our native soil we name, And tell the important cause for which we came. Attentively he heard us, while we spoke; Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look, Made this return:—‘Ausonian race, of old Renowned for peace, and for an age of gold, What madness has your altered minds possest, To change for war hereditary rest, Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword— A needless ill, your ancestors abhorred? We—for myself I speak, and all the name Of Grecians, who to Troy's destruction came— (Omitting those who were in battle slain, Or borne by rolling Simoïs to the main), Not one but suffered, and too dearly bought The prize of honour which in arms he sought; Some doomed to death, and some in exile driven, Outcasts, abandoned by the care of heaven— So worn, so wretched, so despised a crew, As even old Priam might with pity view. Witness the vessels by Minerva tossed In storms—the vengeful Capharean coast— The Eubœan rocks—the prince, whose brother led Our armies to revenge his injured bed, In Egypt lost. Ulysses, with his men, Have seen Charybdis, and the Cyclops' den. Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain Restored to sceptres, and expelled again? Or young Achilles, by his rival slain? Even he, the king of men, the foremost name Of all the Greeks, and most renowned by fame, The proud revenger of another's wife, Yet by his own adulteress lost his life— Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy The foul polluters of his bed enjoy. The gods have envied me the sweets of life, My much-loved country, and my more loved wife: Banished from both, I mourn; while in the sky, Transformed to birds, my lost companions fly: Hovering about the coasts, they make their moan, And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own. What squalid spectres, in the dead of night, Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight! I might have promised to myself those harms, Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms, Presumed against immortal powers to move, And violate with wounds the queen of love. Such arms this hand shall never more employ. No hate remains with me to ruined Troy. I war not with its dust; nor am I glad To think of past events, or good or bad. Your presents I return: whate'er you bring To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king. We met in fight: I know him, to my cost: With what a whirling force his lance he tossed! Heavens! what a spring was in his arm, to throw! How high he held his shield, and rose at every blow! Had Troy produced two more his match in might, They would have changed the fortune of the fight: The invasion of the Greeks had been returned, Our empire wasted, and our cities burned. The long defence the Trojan people made, The war protracted, and the siege delayed, Were due to Hector's and this hero's hand: Both brave alike, and equal in command; Æneas, not inferior in the field, In pious reverence to the gods excelled. Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care The impending dangers of a fatal war.’ He said no more; but, with this cold excuse, Refused the alliance, and advised a truce.” Thus Venulus concluded his report. A jarring murmur filled the factious court: As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force, And dashes o'er the stones that stop the course, The flood, constrained within a scanty space, Roars horrible along the uneasy race; White foam in gathering eddies floats around; The rocky shores rebellow to the sound. The murmur ceased: then from his lofty throne The king invoked the gods, and thus begun:— “I wish, ye Latians, what we now debate Had been resolved before it was too late. Much better had it been for you and me, Unforced by this our last necessity, To have been earlier wise, than now to call A council, when the foe surrounds the wall. O citizens! we wage unequal war, With men, not only heaven's peculiar care, But heaven's own race—unconquered in the field, Or, conquered, yet unknowing how to yield. What hopes you had in Diomede, lay down: Our hopes must centre in ourselves alone. Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain, You see too well; nor need my words explain— Vanquished without resource—laid flat by fate— Factions within, a foe without the gate! Not but I grant that all performed their parts With manly force, and with undaunted hearts: With our united strength the war we waged; With equal numbers, equal arms, engaged: You see the event.—Now hear what I propose, To save our friends, and satisfy our foes. A tract of land the Latians have possessed Along the Tiber, stretching to the west, Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till, And their mixed cattle graze the fruitful hill. Those mountains filled with firs, that lower land, If you consent, the Trojans shall command, Called into part of what is ours; and there, On terms agreed, the common country share. There let them build and settle, if they please; Unless they choose once more to cross the seas, In search of seats remote from Italy, And from unwelcome inmates set us free. Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed, Or twice as many more, if more they need. Materials are at hand: a well-grown wood Runs equal with the margin of the flood: Let them the number and the form assign; The care and cost of all the stores be mine. To treat the peace, a hundred senators Shall be commissioned hence with ample powers, With olive crowned: the presents they shall bear, A purple robe, a royal ivory chair, And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear, And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate This great affair, and save the sinking state.” Then Drances took the word, who grudged, long since, The rising glories of the Daunian prince. Factious and rich, bold at the council-board, But cautious in the field, he shunned the sword— A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord. Noble his mother was, and near the throne; But, what his father's parentage, unknown. He rose, and took the advantage of the times, To load young Turnus with invidious crimes. “Such truths, O king,” said he, “your words contain, As strike the sense, and all replies are vain; Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek What common needs require, but fear to speak. Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man, Whose pride this inauspicious war began; For whose ambition (let me dare to say, Fear set apart, though death is in my way), The plains of Latium run with blood around; So many valiant heroes bite the ground; Dejected grief in every face appears; A town in mourning, and a land in tears; While he, the undoubted author of our harms, The man who menaces the gods with arms, Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight, And sought his safety in ignoble flight. Now, best of kings, since you propose to send Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend; Add yet a greater at our joint request, One which he values more than all the rest: Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride; With that alliance let the league be tied, And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide. Let insolence no longer awe the throne; But, with a father's right, bestow your own. For this maligner of the general good, If still we fear his force, he must be woo'd; His haughty godhead we with prayers implore, Your sceptre to release, and our just rights restore. O cursed cause of all our ills! must we Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee? What right hast thou to rule the Latian state, And send us out to meet our certain fate? 'Tis a destructive war: from Turnus' hand Our peace and public safety we demand. Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain; If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain. Turnus, I know you think me not your friend, Nor will I much with your belief contend: I beg your greatness not to give the law In other realms, but, beaten, to withdraw. Pity your own, or pity our estate; Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate. Your interest is, the war should never cease; But we have felt enough, to wish the peace— A land exhausted to the last remains, Depopulated towns, and driven plains. Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of power, A beauteous princess, with a crown in dower, So fire your mind, in arms assert your right, And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight. Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone! We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne— A base ignoble crowd, without a name, Unwept, unworthy of the funeral flame, By duty bound to forfeit each his life, That Turnus may possess a royal wife! Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew Should share such triumphs, and detain from you The post of honour, your undoubted due. Rather alone your matchless force employ, To merit what alone you must enjoy.” These words, so full of malice mixed with art, Inflamed with rage the youthful hero's heart. Then groaning from the bottom of his breast, He heaved for wind, and thus his wrath expressed:— “You, Drances, never want a stream of words, Then, when the public need requires our swords. First in the council-hall to steer the state, And ever foremost in a tongue-debate, While our strong walls secure us from the foe, Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow: But let the potent orator declaim, And with the brand of coward blot my name; Free leave is given him, when his fatal hand Has covered with more corps the sanguine strand, And high as mine his towering trophies stand. If any doubt remains, who dares the most, Let us decide it at the Trojans' cost, And issue both abreast, where honour calls (Foes are not far to seek without the walls)— Unless his noisy tongue can only fight, And feet were given him but to speed his flight. I beaten from the field? I forced away? Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say? Had he but even beheld the fight, his eyes Had witnessed for me what his tongue denies— What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain, And how the bloody Tiber swelled the main. All saw, but he, the Arcadian troops retire In scattered squadrons, and their prince expire. The giant brothers, in their camp, have found, I was not forced with ease to quit my ground. Not such the Trojans tried me, when, enclosed, I singly their united arms opposed— First forced an entrance through their thick array, Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way. 'Tis a destructive war? So let it be, But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee! Meantime proceed to fill the people's ears With false reports, their minds with panic fears: Extol the strength of a twice-conquered race; Our foes encourage, and our friends debase. Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o'erthrown; Suppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies, And Diomede from fierce Æneas flies! Say, rapid Aufidus with awful dread Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head, When the great Trojan on his bank appears; For that's as true as thy dissembled fears Of my revenge: dismiss that vanity: Thou, Drances, art below a death from me. Let that vile soul in that vile body rest; The lodging is well worthy of the guest. Now, royal father, to the present state Of our affairs, and of this high debate— If in your arms thus early you diffide, And think your fortune is already tried; If one defeat has brought us down so low, As never more in fields to meet the foe; Then I conclude for peace: 'tis time to treat, And lie like vassals at the victor's feet. But, oh! if any ancient blood remains, One drop of all our fathers, in our veins, That man would I prefer before the rest, Who dared his death with an undaunted breast; Who comely fell by no dishonest wound, To shun that sight, and, dying, gnawed the ground. But, if we still have fresh recruits in store, If our confederates can afford us more; If the contended field we bravely fought, And not a bloodless victory was bought; Their losses equalled ours; and, for their slain, With equal fires they filled the shining plain; Why thus, unforced, should we so tamely yield, And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field? Good unexpected, evils unforeseen, Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene. Some, raised aloft, come tumbling down amain; Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again. If Diomede refuse his aid to lend, The great Messapus yet remains our friend: Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours: The Italian chiefs, and princes, join their powers: Nor least in number, nor in name the last, Your own brave subjects have our cause embraced. Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon Contains an army in herself alone, And heads a squadron, terrible to sight, With glittering shields, in brazen armour bright. Yet, if the foe a single fight demand, And I alone the public peace withstand; If you consent, he shall not be refused, Nor find a hand to victory unused. This new Achilles, let him take the field, With fated armour, and Vulcanian shield! For you, my royal father, and my fame, I, Turnus, not the least of all my name, Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand; And I alone will answer his demand. Drances shall rest secure, and neither share The danger, nor divide the prize, of war.” While they debate, nor these nor those will yield, Æneas draws his forces to the field, And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed Return, and through the frighted city spread The unpleasing news,—“The Trojans are descried, In battle marching by the river-side, And bending to the town.” They take the alarm: Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm. The impetuous youth press forward to the field; They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield: The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry; Old feeble men with fainter groans reply; A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky, Like that of swans remurmuring to the floods, Or birds of differing kinds in hollow woods. Turnus the occasion takes, and cries aloud:— “Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd: Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls, And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls.” He said, and, turning short with speedy pace, Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place.— “Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band. Messapus, and Catillus, post your force Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse. Some guard the passes, others man the wall; Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call.” They swarm from every quarter of the town, And with disordered haste the rampires crown. Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late, The gathering storm just breaking on the state, Dismissed the council till a fitter time, And owned his easy temper as his crime, Who, forced against his reason, had complied To break the treaty for the promised bride. Some help to sink new trenches; others aid To ram the stones, or raise the palisade. Hoarse trumpets sound the alarm; around the walls Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labour calls. A sad procession in the streets is seen, Of matrons, that attend the mother queen: High in her chair she sits, and, at her side, With downcast eyes appears the fatal bride. They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands; Prayers in their mouths, and presents in their hands. With censers, first they fume the sacred shrine, Then in this common supplication join:— “O patroness of arms! unspotted maid! Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid! Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate, And lay the Phrygian low before the gate.” Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast Well-tempered steel and scaly brass invest: The cuishes, which his brawny thighs enfold, Are mingled metal damasked o'er with gold. His faithful falchion sits upon his side; Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide: But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends, With godlike grace, he from the tower descends. Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare His absent rival, and to promise war. Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins, The wanton courser prances o'er the plains, Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds, And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds, Or seeks his watering in the well-known flood, To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood: He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain, And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane: He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high; Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly. Soon as the prince appears without the gate, The Volscians, and their virgin leader, wait His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien, Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen: Her squadron imitates, and each descends; Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:— “If sense of honour, if a soul secure Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure, Can promise aught, or on itself rely Greatly to dare to conquer or to die; Then, I alone, sustained by these, will meet The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat. Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown: You, general, stay behind, and guard the town.” Turnus a while stood mute with glad surprise, And on the fierce virago fixed his eyes, Then thus returned:—“O grace of Italy! With what becoming thanks can I reply? Not only words lie labouring in my breast, But thought itself is by thy praise oppressed. Yet rob me not of all; but let me join My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine. The Trojan, not in stratagem unskilled, Sends his light horse before to scour the field: Himself, through steep ascents and thorny brakes, A larger compass to the city takes. This news my scouts confirm: and I prepare To foil his cunning, and his force to dare; With chosen foot his passage to forelay, And place an ambush in the winding way. Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse: The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce With those of Tibur, and the Latian band, Subjected all to thy supreme command.” This said, he warns Messapus to the war, Then every chief exhorts with equal care. All thus encouraged, his own troops he joins, And hastes to prosecute his deep designs. Enclosed with hills, a winding valley lies, By nature formed for fraud, and fitted for surprise. A narrow track, by human steps untrode, Leads, through perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands, Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands. The top is level—an offensive seat Of war; and from the war a safe retreat: For, on the right and left, is room to press The foes at hand, or from afar distress; To drive them headlong downward; and to pour, On their descending backs, a stony shower. Thither young Turnus took the well-known way, Possessed the pass, and in blind ambush lay. Meantime, Latonian Phœbe, from the skies, Beheld the approaching war with hateful eyes, And called the light-foot Opis to her aid, Her most beloved and ever-trusty maid; Then with a sigh began:—“Camilla goes To meet her death amidst her fatal foes— The nymph I loved of all my mortal train, Invested with Diana's arms, in vain. Nor is my kindness for the virgin new: 'Twas born with her; and with her years it grew. Her father Metabus, when forced away From old Privernum for tyrannic sway, Snatched up, and saved from his prevailing foes, This tender babe, companion of his woes. Casmilla was her mother; but he drowned One hissing letter in a softer sound, And called Camilla. Through the woods he flies; Wrapped in his robe the royal infant lies. His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace; With shouts and clamours they pursue the chase. The banks of Amasene at length he gains: The raging flood his farther flight restrains, Raised o'er the borders with unusual rains. Prepared to plunge into the stream, he fears, Not for himself, but for the charge he bears. Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste, Then, desperate in distress, resolves at last. A knotty lance of well-boiled oak he bore; The middle part with cork he covered o'er: He closed the child within the hollow space; With twigs of bending osier bound the case, Then poised the spear, heavy with human weight, And thus invoked my favour for the freight:— ‘Accept, great goddess of the woods (he said), Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid! Through air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine; And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.’ He said; and with full force the spear he threw: Above the sounding waves Camilla flew. Then, pressed by foes, he stemmed the stormy tide, And gained, by stress of arms, the farther side. His fastened spear he pulled from out the ground, And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound; Nor, after that, in towns which walls enclose, Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes; But, rough, in open air he chose to lie; Earth was his couch, his covering was the sky. On hills unshorn, or in a desert den, He shunned the dire society of men. A shepherd's solitary life he led; His daughter with the milk of mares he fed. The dugs of bears, and every savage beast, He drew, and through her lips the liquor pressed. The little Amazon could scarcely go— He loads her with a quiver and a bow; And, that she might her staggering steps command, He with a slender javelin fills her hand. Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound; Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground. Instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread Her back and shoulders, fastened to her head. The flying dart she first attempts to fling, And round her tender temples tossed the sling; Then, as her strength with years increased, began To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan, And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane. The Tuscan matrons with each other vied, To bless their rival sons with such a bride: But she disdains their love, to share with me The sylvan shades, and vowed virginity. And, oh! I wish, contented with my cares Of savage spoils, she had not sought the wars: Then had she been of my celestial train, And shunned the fate that dooms her to be slain. But since, opposing Heaven's decree, she goes To find her death among forbidden foes, Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight, Where, with the gods adverse, the Latins fight. This bow to thee, this quiver, I bequeath, This chosen arrow, to revenge her death: By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain, Or of the Trojan or Italian train, Let him not pass unpunished from the plain. Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid To bear the breathless body of my maid: Unspoiled shall be her arms, and unprofaned Her holy limbs with any human hand, And in a marble tomb laid in her native land.” She said. The faithful nymph descends from high With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky: Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly. By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse, Drawn up in squadrons, with united force Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound, Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground. Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far; And the fields glitter with a waving war. Opposed to these, come on with furious force Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse; These in the body placed, on either hand Sustained and closed by fair Camilla's band. Advancing in a line, they couch their spears; And less and less the middle space appears. Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen The neighing coursers, and the shouting men. In distance of their darts they stop their course; Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse. The face of heaven their flying javelins hide, And deaths unseen are dealt on either side. Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus void of fear, By mettled coursers borne in full career, Meet first opposed; and, with a mighty shock, Their horses' heads against each other knock. Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast, As with an engine's force, or lightning's blast: He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last. The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright, And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight. Spurring at speed, to their own walls they drew; Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue, And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase; Till, seized with shame, they wheel about, and face, Receive their foes, and raise a threatening cry. The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly. So swelling surges, with a thundering roar, Driven on each other's backs, insult the shore, Bound o'er the rocks, encroach upon the land, And far upon the beach eject the sand; Then backward, with a swing, they take their way, Repulsed from upper ground, and seek their mother sea; With equal hurry quit the invaded shore, And swallow back the sand and stones they spewed before. Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field, Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repelled. Ashamed at length, to the third charge they ran— Both hosts resolved, and mingled man to man. Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strowed With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood. Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie: Confused the fight, and more confused the cry. Orsilochus, who durst not press too near Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear, And struck the steel beneath his horse's ear. The fiery steed, impatient of the wound, Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound, His helpless lord cast backward on the ground. Catillus pierced Iolas first; then drew His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw, The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew. His neck and throat unarmed, his head was bare, But shaded with a length of yellow hair: Secure, he fought, exposed on every part, A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart. Across the shoulders came the feathered wound; Transfixed he fell, and doubled to the ground. The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed, And death, with honour, sought on either side. Resistless, through the war Camilla rode, In danger unappalled, and pleased with blood. One side was bare for her exerted breast; One shoulder with her painted quiver pressed. Now from afar her fatal javelins play; Now with her axe's edge she hews her way: Diana's arms upon her shoulder sound; And when, too closely pressed, she quits the ground, From her bent bow she sends a backward wound. Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side, Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride— Italians all—in peace, their queen's delight; In war, the bold companions of the fight. So marched the Thracian Amazons of old, When Thermodon with bloody billows rolled: Such troops as these in shining arms were seen, When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen: Such to the field Penthesilea led, From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled; With such returned triumphant from the war, Her maids with cries attend the lofty car; They clash with manly force their moony shields; With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields. Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid, On the cold earth were by thy courage laid? Thy spear, of mountain-ash, Eunæus first, With fury driven, from side to side transpierced: A purple stream came spouting from the wound; Bathed in his blood he lies, and bites the ground. Liris and Pagasus at once she slew: The former, as the slackened reins he drew, Of his faint steed—the latter, as he stretched His arm to prop his friend—the javelin reached. By the same weapon, sent from the same hand, Both fall together, and both spurn the sand. Amastrus next is added to the slain: The rest in rout she follows o'er the plain: Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon, And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun. Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost; Each was attended with a Trojan ghost. Young Ornytus bestrode a hunter steed, Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed. Him, from afar, she spied, in arms unknown: O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown; His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread A covering for his cheeks, and grinned around his head. He clenched within his hand an iron prong, And towered above the rest, conspicuous in the throng. Him soon she singled from the flying train, And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:— “Vain hunter! didst thou think through woods to chase The savage herd, a vile and trembling race? Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory: A woman warrior was too strong for thee. Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqueror's name, Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame.” Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew, The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew— But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends Above the gorget, where his helmet ends, And o'er the shield which his left side defends. Orsilochus, and she, their coursers ply: He seems to follow, and she seems to fly. But in a narrower ring she makes the race; And then he flies, and she pursues the chase. Gathering at length on her deluded foe, She swings her axe, and rises to the blow; Full on the helm behind, with such a sway The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way: He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace; Brains, mingled with his blood, besmears his face. Astonished Aunus just arrives by chance, To see his fall, nor farther dares advance; But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye, He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly; Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat (At least while Fortune favoured his deceit), Cries out aloud,—“What courage have you shown, Who trust your courser's strength, and not your own? Forego the 'vantage of your horse, alight, And then on equal terms begin the fight: It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can, When, foot to foot, you combat with a man.” He said. She glows with anger and disdain, Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain, And leaves her horse at large among her train; With her drawn sword defies him to the field, And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield. The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed, Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed, Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides The goring rowels in his bleeding sides. “Vain fool, and coward!” cries the lofty maid, “Caught in the train, which thou thyself hast laid! On others practise thy Ligurian arts; Thin stratagems, and tricks of little hearts, Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire, With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire.” At this, so fast her flying feet she sped, That soon she strained beyond his horse's head: Then turning short, at once she seized the rein, And laid the boaster grovelling on the plain. Not with more ease the falcon, from above, Trusses, in middle air, the trembling dove, Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound: The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground. Now mighty Jove, from his superior height, With his broad eye surveys the unequal fight. He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain, And sends him to redeem the abandoned plain. Between the broken ranks the Tuscan rides, And these encourages, and those he chides; Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight; Renews their ardour, and restores the fight. “What panic fear has seized your souls? O shame, O brand perpetual of the Etrurian name! Cowards incurable! a woman's hand Drives, breaks, and scatters, your ignoble band! Now cast away the sword, and quit the shield! What use of weapons which you dare not wield? Not thus you fly your female foes by night, Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite; When to fat offerings the glad augur calls, And the shrill horn-pipe sounds to bacchanals. These are your studied cares, your lewd delight— Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight.” Thus having said, he spurs amid the foes, Not managing the life he meant to lose. The first he found he seized, with headlong haste, In his strong gripe, and clasped around the waist: 'Twas Venulus, whom from his horse he tore, And (laid athwart his own) in triumph bore. Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes, And view the unusual sight with vast surprise. The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains, Pressed in his arms the ponderous prey sustains, Then, with his shortened spear, explores around His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound. Nor less the captive struggles for his life: He writhes his body to prolong the strife, And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts His utmost vigour, and the point averts. So stoops the yellow eagle from on high, And bears a speckled serpent through the sky, Fastening his crooked talons on the prey: The prisoner hisses through the liquid way; Resists the royal hawk; and, though oppressed, She fights in volumes, and erects her crest: Turned to her foe she stiffens every scale, And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threatening tail. Against the victor, all defence is weak: The imperial bird still plies her with his beak; He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores, Then claps his pinions, and securely soars. Thus, through the midst of circling enemies, Strong Tarchon snatched and bore away his prize. The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press The Latins, and presume the like success. Then Arruns, doomed to death, his arts essayed To murder, unespied, the Volscian maid: This way and that his winding course he bends, And, wheresoe'er she turns, her steps attends. When she retires victorious from the chase, He wheels about with care, and shifts his place: When, rushing on, she seeks her foes in fight, He keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight: He threats, and trembles, trying every way, Unseen to kill, and safely to betray. Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far, Glittering in Phrygian arms amidst the war, Was by the virgin viewed. The steed he pressed Was proud with trappings; and his brawny chest With scales of gilded brass was covered o'er: A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore. With deadly wounds he galled the distant foe; Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow: A golden helm his front and head surrounds; A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds. Gold, weaved with linen, on his thighs he wore, With flowers of needlework distinguished o'er, With golden buckles bound, and gathered up before. Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes, Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize, Or that the temple might his trophies hold, Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold. Blind in her haste, she chases him alone, And seeks his life, regardless of her own. This lucky moment the sly traitor chose; Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose, And threw, but first to heaven addressed his vows:— “O patron of Soracte's high abodes! Phœbus, the ruling power among the gods! Whom first we serve: whole woods of unctuous pine Are felled for thee, and to thy glory shine; By thee protected, with our naked soles, Through flames unsinged we march, and tread the kindled coals. Give me, propitious power, to wash away The stains of this dishonourable day: Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim, But with my future actions trust my fame. Let me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome, And from the field return inglorious home.” Apollo heard, and, granting half his prayer, Shuffled in winds the rest, and tossed in empty air. He gives the death desired: his safe return By southern tempests to the seas is borne. Now, when the javelin whizzed along the skies, Both armies on Camilla turned their eyes, Directed by the sound. Of either host, The unhappy virgin, though concerned the most, Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent On golden spoils, and on her prey intent; Till in her pap the winged weapon stood Infixed, and deeply drunk the purple blood. Her sad attendants hasten to sustain Their dying lady drooping on the plain. Far from their sight the trembling Arruns flies, With beating heart, and fear confused with joys; Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow, Or even to bear the sight of his expiring foe. As, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide At unawares, or ranched the shepherd's side, Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies, And claps his quivering tail between his thighs: So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends, But, spurring forward, herds among his friends. She wrenched the javelin with her dying hands, But wedged within her breast the weapon stands: The wood she draws, the steely point remains; She staggers in her seat with agonising pains (A gathering mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes, And from her cheeks the rosy colour flies); Then turns to her, whom, of her female train, She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain:— “Acca, 'tis past! he swims before my sight, Inexorable Death; and claims his right. Bear my last words to Turnus: fly with speed, And bid him timely to my charge succeed, Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve:— Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive.” She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain: Dying, her opened hand forsakes the rein; Short, and more short, she pants: by slow degrees Her mind the passage from her body frees. She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest, Her drooping head declining on her breast: In the last sigh her struggling soul expires, And, murmuring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires. A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued; Despair and rage, and languished fight renewed. The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line, Advance to charge; the mixed Arcadians join. But Cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar Surveys the field, and fortune of the war, Unmoved a while, till, prostrate on the plain, Weltering in blood, she sees Camilla slain, And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train. Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue:— “Too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid! For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid: Nor aught availed, in this unhappy strife, Diana's sacred arms, to save thy life. Yet unrevenged thy goddess will not leave Her votary's death, nor with vain sorrow grieve. Branded the wretch, and be his name abhorred; But after-ages shall thy praise record. The inglorious coward soon shall press the plain: Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain.” High o'er the field, there stood a hilly mound— Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around— Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay, A king that once in Latium bore the sway. The beauteous Opus thither bent her flight, To mark the traitor Arruns from the height. Him in refulgent arms she soon espied, Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried:— “Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late; Turn, like a man, at length, and meet thy fate. Charged with my message to Camilla go, And say I sent thee to the shades below— An honour undeserved from Cynthia's bow.” She said, and from her quiver chose with speed The winged shaft, predestined for the deed; Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied, Till the far distant horns approached on either side. The bowstring touched her breast, so strong she drew; Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew. At once the twanging bow and sounding dart The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart. Him beating with his heels in pangs of death, His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath. The conquering damsel, with expanded wings, The welcome message to her mistress brings. Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field; And, unsustained, the chiefs of Turnus yield. The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly, More on their speed than on their strength rely. Confused in flight, they bear each other down, And spur their horses headlong to the town. Driven by their foes, and to their fears resigned, Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind. These drop the shield, and those the lance forego, Or on their shoulders bear the slackened bow. The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound, Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground. Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky, And o'er the darkened walls and rampires fly. The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands, Rend heaven with female shrieks, and wring their hands. All pressing on, pursuers and pursued, Are crushed in crowds, a mingled multitude. Some happy few escape: the throng too late Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate. Even in the sight of home, the wretched sire Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire. Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close, But leave their friends excluded with their foes. The vanquished cry; the victors loudly shout; 'Tis terror all within, and slaughter all without. Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall, Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall. The Latian virgins, valiant with despair, Armed on the towers, the common danger share: So much of zeal their country's cause inspired; So much Camilla's great example fired. Poles, sharpened in the flames, from high they throw, With imitated darts to gall the foe. Their lives, for godlike freedom, they bequeath, And crowd each other to be first in death. Meantime to Turnus, ambushed in the shade, With heavy tidings came the unhappy maid:— “The Volscians overthrown—Camilla killed— The foes entirely masters of the field, Like a resistless flood, come rolling on: The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town.” Inflamed with rage (for so the Furies fire The Daunian's breast, and so the Fates require), He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain Possessed, and downward issues on the plain. Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. Through the black forest and the ferny brake, Unknowingly secure, their way they take, From the rough mountains to the plain descend, And there, in order drawn, their line extend. Both armies now in open fields are seen; Not far the distance of the space between. Both to the city bend. Æneas sees, Through smoking fields, his hastening enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears the approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle joined; But westward to the sea the sun declined. Intrenched before the town, both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII. ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Æneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Æneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quelled, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour questioned for the promised fight— The more he was with vulgar hate opprest, The more his fury boiled within his breast: He roused his vigour for the last debate, And raised his haughty soul, to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed javelin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain, His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares: his eyeballs flash with fire; Through his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approached the king, and thus began:— “No more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepared to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land. The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take The same conditions which himself did make. Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare, And to my single virtue trust the war. The Latians unconcerned shall see the fight: This arm unaided shall assert your right: Then, if my prostrate body press the plain, To him the crown and beauteous bride remain.” To whom the king sedately thus replied:— “Brave youth! the more your valour has been tried, The more becomes it us, with due respect, To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect. You want not wealth, or a successive throne, Or cities which your arms have made your own: My towns and treasures are at your command, And stored with blooming beauties is my land: Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees, Unmarried, fair, of noble families. Now let me speak, and you with patience hear, Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear, But sound advice, proceeding from a heart Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art. The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown, No prince, Italian born, should heir my throne: Oft have our augurs, in prediction skilled, And oft our priests, a foreign son revealed. Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood, Bribed by my kindness to my kindred blood, Urged by my wife, who would not be denied, I promised my Lavinia for your bride: Her from her plighted lord by force I took; All ties of treaties, and of honour, broke: On your account I waged an impious war— With what success, it is needless to declare; I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share. Twice vanquished while in bloody fields we strive, Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive: The rolling flood runs warm with human gore; The bones of Latians blanch the neighbouring shore. Why put I not an end to this debate, Still unresolved, and still a slave to fate? If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give, Why should I not procure it whilst you live? Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray, What would my kinsmen, the Rutulians, say? And, should you fall in fight (which heaven defend!), How curse the cause, which hastened to his end The daughter's lover, and the father's friend? Weigh in your mind the various chance of war; Pity your parent's age, and ease his care.” Such balmy words he poured, but all in vain: The proffered medicine but provoked the pain. The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief, With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:— “The care, O best of fathers! which you take For my concerns, at my desire forsake. Permit me not to languish out my days, But make the best exchange of life for praise. This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize; And the blood follows, where the weapon flies. His goddess mother is not near, to shroud The flying coward with an empty cloud.” But now the queen, who feared for Turnus' life, And loathed the hard conditions of the strife, Held him by force; and, dying in his death, In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:— “O Turnus! I adjure thee by these tears, And whate'er price Amata's honour bears Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope, My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop— Since on the safety of thy life alone Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne— Refuse me not this one, this only prayer, To waive the combat, and pursue the war. Whatever chance attends this fatal strife, Think it includes, in thine, Amata's life. I cannot live a slave, or see my throne Usurped by strangers, or a Trojan son.” At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed; A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread, Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red. Amata, ever partial to the cause of Turnus, had just before desired him, with all manner of earnestness, not to engage his rival in single fight; which was his present resolution. Virgil, though (in favour of his hero) he never tells us directly that Lavinia preferred Turnus to Æneas, yet has insinuated this preference twice before. For mark, in the Seventh Æneïd, she left her father (who had promised her to Æneas without asking her consent), and followed her mother into the woods, with a troop of Bacchanals, where Amata sung the marriage-song, in the name of Turnus; which, if she had disliked, she might have opposed. Then, in the Eleventh Æneïd, when her mother went to the temple of Pallas, to invoke her aid against Æneas, whom she calls by no better name than Phrygius prædo, Lavinia sits by her in the same chair or litter, juxtaque comes Lavinia virgo,—oculos dejecta decoros. What greater sign of love, than fear and concernment for the lover? In the lines which I have quoted, she not only sheds tears, but changes colour. She had been bred up with Turnus; and Æneas was wholly a stranger to her. Turnus, in probability, was her first love, and favoured by her mother, who had the ascendant over her father. But I am much deceived, if (besides what I have said) there be not a secret satire against the sex, which is lurking under this description of Virgil, who seldom speaks well of women,—better, indeed, of Camilla, than any other, for he commends her beauty and valour, because he would concern the reader for her death. But valour is no very proper praise for womankind; and beauty is common to the sex. He says also somewhat of Andromache, but transiently: and his Venus is a better mother than a wife; for she owns to Vulcan she had a son by another man. The rest are Junos, Dianas, Didos, Amatas, two mad prophetesses, three Harpies on earth, and as many Furies under ground. This fable of Lavinia includes a secret moral: that women, in their choice of husbands, prefer the younger of their suitors to the elder; are insensible of merit, fond of handsomeness, and, generally speaking, rather hurried away by their appetite than governed by their reason. The driving colours, never at a stay, Run here and there, and flush, and fade away. Delightful change! thus Indian ivory shows, Which with the bordering paint of purple glows; Or lilies damasked by the neighbouring rose. The lover gazed, and, burning with desire, The more he looked, the more he fed the fire: Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite, Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight. Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes, Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:— “O mother! do not by your tears prepare Such boding omens, and prejudge the war. Resolved on fight, I am no longer free To shun my death, if Heaven my death decree.”— Then turning to the herald, thus pursues: “Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news; Denounce from me, that, when to-morrow's light Shall gild the heavens, he need not urge the fight; The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore: Our single swords the quarrel shall decide, And to the victor be the beauteous bride.” He said, and, striding on with speedy pace, He sought his coursers of the Thracian race. At his approach they toss their heads on high, And, proudly neighing, promise victory. The sires of these Orithyia sent from far, To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war. The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white, Nor northern winds in fleetness matched their flight. Officious grooms stand ready by his side; And some with combs their flowing manes divide, And others stroke their chests, and gently soothe their pride. He sheathed his limbs in arms; a tempered mass Of golden metal those, and mountain-brass. Then to his head his glittering helm he tied, And girt his faithful falchion to his side. In his Ætnæan forge, the god of fire That falchion laboured for the hero's sire, Immortal keenness on the blade bestowed, And plunged it hissing in the Stygian flood. Propped on a pillar, which the ceiling bore, Was placed the lance Auruncan Actor wore; Which with such force he brandished in his hand, The tough ash trembled like an osier wand: Then cried,—“O ponderous spoil of Actor slain, And never yet by Turnus tossed in vain! Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go, Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe: Give me to tear his corselet from his breast, And from that eunuch head to rend the crest; Dragged in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil, Hot from the vexing iron, and smeared with fragrant oil.” Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes. So fares the bull in his loved female's sight: Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight: He tries his goring horns against a tree, And meditates his absent enemy: He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand. Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms, To future fight his manly courage warms: He whets his fury, and with joy prepares To terminate at once the lingering wars; To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates What Heaven had promised, and expounds the fates. Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease The rage of arms, and ratify the peace. The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height, Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light; The ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea, From out their flaming nostrils breathed the day; When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard, In friendly labour joined, the list prepared. Beneath the walls they measure out the space; Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass, Where, with religious rites, their common gods they place. In purest white, the priests their heads attire, And living waters bear, and holy fire; And, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair, Long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear. In order issuing from the town, appears The Latin legion, armed with pointed spears; And from the fields, advancing on a line, The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join: Their various arms afford a pleasing sight: A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepared for fight. Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride, Glittering with gold, and vests in purple dyed— Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line, And there Messapus, born of seed divine. The sign is given; and, round the listed space, Each man in order fills his proper place. Reclining on their ample shields, they stand, And fix their pointed lances in the sand. Now, studious of the sight, a numerous throng Of either sex promiscuous, old and young, Swarm from the town: by those who rest behind, The gates and walls, and houses' tops, are lined. Meantime the queen of heaven beheld the sight, With eyes unpleased, from Mount Albano's height (Since called Albano by succeeding fame, But then an empty hill, without a name). She thence surveyed the field, the Trojan powers, The Latian squadrons, and Laurentine towers. Then thus the goddess of the skies bespake, With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake, King Turnus' sister, once a lovely maid, Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betrayed— Compressed by force, but, by the grateful god, Now made the Naïs of the neighbouring flood. “O nymph, the pride of living lakes! (said she) O most renowned, and most beloved by me! Long hast thou known, nor need I to record, The wanton sallies of my wandering lord. Of every Latian fair, whom Jove misled To mount by stealth my violated bed, To thee alone I grudged not his embrace, But gave a part of heaven, and an unenvied place. Now learn from me thy near approaching grief, Nor think my wishes want to thy relief While fortune favoured, nor heaven's king denied To lend my succour to the Latian side, I saved thy brother, and the sinking state: But now he struggles with unequal fate, And goes, with gods averse, o'ermatched in might, To meet inevitable death in fight; Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight. Thou, if thou dar'st, thy present aid supply; It well becomes a sister's care to try.” At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppressed, Thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast. To whom Saturnia thus:—“Thy tears are late: Haste, snatch him, if he can be snatched, from fate: New tumults kindle; violate the truce. Who knows what changeful Fortune may produce? 'Tis not a crime to attempt what I decree; Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me.” She said, and, sailing on the winged wind, Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind. And now in pomp the peaceful kings appear: Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear: Twelve golden beams around his temples play, To mark his lineage from the god of day. Two snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke, And in his hand two massy spears he shook: Then issued from the camp, in arms divine, Æneas, author of the Roman line; And by his side Ascanius took his place, The second hope of Rome's immortal race. Adorned in white, a reverend priest appears, And offerings to the flaming altars bears— A porket, and a lamb that never suffered shears. Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes, And strews the beasts designed for sacrifice, With salt and meal: with like officious care He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair. Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds; With the same generous juice the flame he feeds. Æneas then unsheathed his shining sword, And thus with pious prayers the gods adored:— “All-seeing sun! and thou, Ausonian soil, For which I have sustained so long a toil, Thou, king of heaven! and thou, the queen of air, Propitious now, and reconciled by prayer; Thou, god of war, whose unresisted sway The labours and events of arms obey! Ye living fountains, and ye running floods! All powers of ocean, all ethereal gods! Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field, Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield, My Trojans shall increase Evander's town; Ascanius shall renounce the Ausonian crown: All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease; Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace. But, if my juster arms prevail in fight, (As sure they shall, if I divine aright), My Trojans shall not o'er the Italians reign: Both equal, both unconquered, shall remain, Joined in their laws, their lands, and their abodes; I ask but altars for my weary gods. The care of those religious rites be mine: The crown to King Latinus I resign: His be the sovereign sway. Nor will I share His power in peace, or his command in war. For me, my friends another town shall frame, And bless the rising towers with fair Lavinia's name.” Thus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands, The Latian king before his altar stands. “By the same heaven (said he), and earth, and main, And all the powers that all the three contain; By hell below, and by that upper god, Whose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod; So let Latona's double offspring hear, And double-fronted Janus, what I swear: I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames, And all those powers attest, and all their names: Whatever chance befall on either side, No term of time this union shall divide: No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind, Or shake the stedfast tenor of my mind; Not, though the circling seas should break their bound, O'erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground; Not, though the lamps of heaven their spheres forsake, Hurled down, and hissing in the nether lake: Even as this royal sceptre” (for he bore A sceptre in his hand) “shall never more Shoot out in branches, or renew the birth— An orphan now, cut from the mother earth By the keen axe, dishonoured of its hair, And cased in brass, for Latian kings to bear.” When thus in public view the peace was tied With solemn vows, and sworn on either side, All dues performed which holy rites require, The victim beasts are slain before the fire, The trembling entrails from their bodies torn, And to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne. Already the Rutulians deemed their man O'ermatched in arms, before the fight began. First rising fears are whispered through the crowd; Then, gathering sound, they murmur more aloud. Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes The champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size: The nearer they approach, the more is known The apparent disadvantage of their own. Turnus himself appears in public sight Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight. Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands, And, while he mutters undistinguished prayers: A livid deadness in his cheeks appears. With anxious pleasure when Juturna viewed The increasing fright of the mad multitude, When their short sighs and thickening sobs she heard, And found their ready minds for change prepared; Dissembling her immortal form, she took Camertes' mien, his habit, and his look— A chief of ancient blood:—in arms well known Was his great sire, and he his greater son. His shape assumed, amid the ranks she ran, And humouring their first motions, thus began:— “For shame, Rutulians! can you bear the sight Of one exposed for all, in single fight? Can we, before the face of Heaven, confess Our courage colder, or our numbers less? View all the Trojan host, the Arcadian band, And Tuscan army; count them as they stand: Undaunted to the battle if we go, Scarce every second man will share a foe. Turnus, 'tis true, in this unequal strife, Shall lose, with honour, his devoted life, Or change it rather for immortal fame, Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came: But you, a servile and inglorious band, For foreign lords shall sow your native land, Those fruitful fields, your fighting fathers gained, Which have so long their lazy sons sustained.” With words like these, she carried her design. A rising murmur runs along the line. Then even the city troops, and Latians, tired With tedious war, seem with new souls inspired: Their champion's fate with pity they lament, And of the league, so lately sworn, repent. Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage With lying wonders, and a false presage; But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes, Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise. For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above, Appears in pomp the imperial bird of Jove: A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes, And o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes; Then, stooping on the fairest of the train, In his strong talons trussed a silver swan. The Italians wonder at the unusual sight: But while he lags, and labours in his flight, Behold, the dastard fowl return anew, And with united force the foe pursue: Clamorous around the royal hawk they fly, And, thickening in a cloud, o'ershade the sky. They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course; Nor can the encumbered bird sustain their force; But vexed, not vanquished, drops the ponderous prey, And, lightened of his burden, wings his way. The Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight, Eager of action, and demand the fight. Then King Tolumnius, versed in augurs' arts, Cries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts:— “At length 'tis granted, what I long desired! This, this is what my frequent vows required. Ye gods! I take your omen, and obey.— Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way. These are the foreign foes, whose impious band, Like that rapacious bird, infest our land: But soon, like him, they shall be forced to sea By strength united, and forego the prey. Your timely succour to your country bring; Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king.” He said; and, pressing onward through the crew, Poised in his lifted arm, his lance he threw. The winged weapon, whistling in the wind, Came driving on, nor missed the mark designed. At once the cornel rattled in the skies; At once tumultuous shouts and clamours rise. Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood, Born of Arcadian mixed with Tuscan blood, Gylippus' sons; the fatal javelin flew, Aimed at the midmost of the friendly crew. A passage through the jointed arms it found, Just where the belt was to the body bound, And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground. Then, fired with pious rage, the generous train Run madly forward to revenge the slain. And some with eager haste their javelins throw; And some with sword in hand assault the foe. The wished insult the Latine troops embrace, And meet their ardour in the middle space. The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line, With equal courage obviate their design. Peace leaves the violated fields; and hate Both armies urges to their mutual fate. With impious haste their altars are o'erturned, The sacrifice half-broiled, and half-unburned. Thick storms of steel from either army fly, And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky; Brands from the fire are missive weapons made, With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade. Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray, And bears his unregarded gods away. These on their horses vault; those yoke the car; The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war. Messapus, eager to confound the peace, Spurred his hot courser through the fighting prease, At King Aulestes, by his purple known A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown; And, with a shock encountering, bore him down. Backward he fell; and, as his fate designed, The ruins of an altar were behind: There pitching on his shoulders and his head, Amid the scattering fires he lay supinely spread. The beamy spear, descending from above, His cuirass pierced, and through his body drove. Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries:— “The gods have found a fitter sacrifice.” Greedy of spoils, the Italians strip the dead Of his rich armour, and uncrown his head. Priest Corynæus armed his better hand, From his own altar, with a blazing brand; And, as Ebusus with a thundering pace Advanced to battle, dashed it on his face: His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires; The crackling crop a noisome scent expires. Following the blow, he seized his curling crown With his left hand; his other cast him down. The prostrate body with his knees he pressed, And plunged his holy poniard in his breast. While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued The shepherd Alsus through the flying crowd, Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow Full on the front of his unwary foe. The broad axe enters with a crashing sound, And cleaves the chin with one continued wound; Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around. An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppressed, And sealed their heavy lids in endless rest. But good Æneas rushed amid the bands: Bare was his head, and naked were his hands, In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:— “What sudden rage, what new desire of blood, Inflames your altered minds? O Trojans! cease From impious arms, nor violate the peace. By human sanctions, and by laws divine, The terms are all agreed; the war is mine. Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue; This hand alone shall right the gods and you: Our injured altars, and their broken vow, To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe.” Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defence, A winged arrow struck the pious prince. But, whether from some human hand it came, Or hostile god, is left unknown by fame: No human hand, or hostile god, was found, To boast the triumph of so base a wound. When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain, His chiefs dismayed, his troops a fainting train, The unhoped event his heightened soul inspires: At once his arms and coursers he requires; Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains, And with a ready hand assumes the reins. He drives impetuous, and, where'er he goes, He leaves behind a lane of slaughtered foes. These his lance reaches: over those he rolls His rapid car, and crushes out their souls. In vain the vanquished fly: the victor sends The dead men's weapons at their living friends. Thus, on the banks of Hebrus' freezing flood, The god of battles, in his angry mood, Clashing his sword against his brazen shield, Lets loose the reins, and scours along the field: Before the wind his fiery coursers fly; Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky. Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair (Dire faces, and deformed), surround the car— Friends of the god, and followers of the war. With fury not unlike, nor less disdain, Exulting Turnus flies along the plain: His smoking horses, at their utmost speed, He lashes on; and urges o'er the dead. Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound, The gore and gathering dust are dashed around. Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war, He killed at hand, but Sthenelus afar: From far the sons of Imbrasus he slew, Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew— Both taught to fight on foot, in battle joined, Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind. Meantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field, New fired the Trojans, and their foes repelled. This son of Dolon bore his grandsire's name, But emulated more his father's fame— His guileful father, sent a nightly spy, The Grecian camp and order to descry— Hard enterprise! and well he might require Achilles' car and horses, for his hire: But, met upon the scout, the Ætolian prince In death bestowed a juster recompense. Fierce Turnus viewed the Trojan from afar, And launched his javelin from his lofty car, Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow, And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe, Wrenched from his feeble hold the shining sword, And plunged it in the bosom of its lord. “Possess,” said he, “the fruit of all thy pains, And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains. Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand; Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!” Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris, he slew, Whom o'er his neck the floundering courser threw. As when loud Boreas, with his blustering train, Stoops from above, incumbent on the main; Where'er he flies, he drives the rack before, And rolls the billows on the Ægæan shore: So, where resistless Turnus takes his course, The scattered squadrons bend before his force: His crest of horse's hair is blown behind By adverse air, and rustles in the wind. This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain, And, as the chariot rolled along the plain, Light from the ground he leapt, and seized the rein. Thus hung in air, he still retained his hold, The coursers frighted, and their course controlled. The lance of Turnus reached him as he hung, And pierced his plated arms, but passed along, And only razed the skin. He turned, and held Against his threatening foe his ample shield, Then called for aid: but, while he cried in vain, The chariot bore him backward on the plain. He lies reversed; the victor king descends, And strikes so justly where his helmet ends, He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk. While he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield, The wounded prince is forced to leave the field: Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried, And young Ascanius, weeping by his side, Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear His limbs from earth, supported on his spear. Resolved in mind, regardless of the smart, He tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart The steel remains. No readier way he found To draw the weapon, than to enlarge the wound. Eager of fight, impatient of delay, He begs; and his unwilling friends obey. Iäpis was at hand to prove his art, Whose blooming youth so fired Apollo's heart, That, for his love, he proffered to bestow His tuneful harp, and his unerring bow: The pious youth, more studious how to save His aged sire now sinking to the grave, Preferred the power of plants, and silent praise Of healing arts, before Phœbean bays. Propped on his lance the pensive hero stood, And heard and saw, unmoved, the mourning crowd. The famed physician tucks his robes around With ready hands, and hastens to the wound. With gentle touches he performs his part, This way and that, soliciting the dart, And exercises all his heavenly art. All softening simples, known of sovereign use, He presses out, and pours their noble juice. These first infused, to lenify the pain— He tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain. Then to the patron of his art he prayed: The patron of his art refused to aid. Meantime the war approaches to the tents: The alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments: The driving dust proclaims the danger near; And first their friends, and then their foes, appear: Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear. The camp is filled with terror and affright: The hissing shafts within the trench alight; An undistinguished noise ascends the sky— The shouts of those who kill, and groans of those who die. But now the goddess mother, moved with grief, And pierced with pity, hastens her relief. A branch of healing dittany she brought, Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought (Rough is the stem, which woolly leaves surround; The leaves with flowers, the flowers with purple crowned)— Well known to wounded goats; a sure relief To draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief. This Venus brings, in clouds involved, and brews The extracted liquor with ambrosian dews, And odorous panacea. Unseen she stands, Tempering the mixture with her heavenly hands, And pours it in a bowl, already crowned With juice of medicinal herbs prepared to bathe the wound. The leech, unknowing of superior art Which aids the cure, with this foments the part; And in a moment ceased the raging smart. Stanched is the blood, and in the bottom stands: The steel, but scarcely touched with tender hands, Moves up, and follows of its own accord, And health and vigour are at once restored. Iäpis first perceived the closing wound, And first the footsteps of a god he found. “Arms! arms!” he cries: “the sword and shield prepare, And send the willing chief, renewed, to war. This is no mortal work, no cure of mine, Nor art's effect, but done by hands divine. Some god our general to the battle sends; Some god preserves his life for greater ends.” The hero arms in haste: his hands enfold His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold: Inflamed to fight, and rushing to the field, That hand sustaining the celestial shield, This gripes the lance, and with such vigour shakes, That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes. Then with a close embrace he strained his son, And, kissing through his helmet, thus begun:— “My son! from my example learn the war, In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare; But happier chance than mine attend thy care! This day my hand thy tender age shall shield, And crown with honours of the conquered field: Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth To toils of war, be mindful of my worth: Assert thy birthright; and in arms be known, For Hector's nephew, and Æneas' son.” He said; and, striding, issued on the plain. Antheus and Mnestheus, and a numerous train, Attend his steps: the rest their weapons take, And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake. A cloud of blinding dust is raised around, Labours beneath their feet the trembling ground. Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far Beheld the progress of the moving war: With him the Latins viewed the covered plains, And the chill blood ran backward in their veins. Juturna saw the advancing troops appear, And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear. Æneas leads; and draws a sweeping train, Closed in their ranks, and pouring on the plain. As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore From the mid-ocean, drives the waves before; The painful hind with heavy heart foresees The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees; With such impetuous rage the prince appears, Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears. And now both armies shock in open field; Osiris is by strong Thymbræus killed. Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain (All famed in arms, and of the Latian train) By Gyas', Mnestheus', and Achates' hand. The fatal augur falls, by whose command The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued With Trojan blood, the unhappy fight renewed. Loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky; And o'er the field the frighted Latins fly. The prince disdains the dastards to pursue, Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few. Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain, He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain. Juturna heard, and, seized with mortal fear, Forced from the beam her brother's charioteer; Assumes his shape, his armour, and his mien, And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen. As the black swallow near the palace plies; O'er empty courts, and under arches, flies; Now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood, To furnish her loquacious nest with food: So drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains; The smoking horses run with loosened reins. She steers a various course among the foes; Now here, now there, her conquering brother shows; Now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight, She turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight. Æneas, fired with fury, breaks the crowd, And seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud: He runs within a narrower ring, and tries To stop the chariot; but the chariot flies. If he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears, And far away the Daunian hero bears. What should he do? Nor arts nor arms avail; And various cares in vain his mind assail. The great Messapus, thundering through the field, In his left hand two pointed javelins held: Encountering on the prince, one dart he drew, And with unerring aim, and utmost vigour, threw. Æneas saw it come, and, stooping low Beneath his buckler, shunned the threat'ning blow. The weapon hissed above his head, and tore The waving plume, which on his helm he wore. Forced by this hostile act, and fired with spite, That flying Turnus still declined the fight, The prince, whose piety had long repelled His inborn ardour, now invades the field; Invokes the powers of violated peace, Their rites and injured altars to redress; Then, to his rage abandoning the rein, With blood and slaughtered bodies fills the plain. What god can tell, what numbers can display, The various labours of that fatal day? What chiefs and champions fell on either side, In combat slain, or by what deaths they died? Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero killed? Who shared the fame and fortune of the field? Jove! could'st thou view, and not avert thy sight, Two jarring nations joined in cruel fight, Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite? Æneas first Rutulian Sucro found, Whose valour made the Trojans quit their ground; Betwixt his ribs the javelin drove so just, It reached his heart, nor needs a second thrust. Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw: Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assailed Diores, and in equal fight prevailed. Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw, Whom without respite at one charge he slew: Cethegus, Tanaïs, Talus, fell oppressed, And sad Onytes, added to the rest— Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore. Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore, And from Apollo's fane to battle sent, O'erthrew; nor Phœbus could their fate prevent. Peaceful Menœtes after these he killed, Who long had shunned the dangers of the field: On Lerna's lake a silent life he led, And with his nets and angle earned his bread. Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew, But wisely from the infectious world withdrew. Poor was his house: his father's painful hand Discharged his rent, and ploughed another's land. As flames among the lofty woods are thrown On different sides, and both by winds are blown: The laurels crackle in the sputtering fire; The frighted sylvans from their shades retire: Or as two neighbouring torrents fall from high, Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry; They roll to sea with unresisted force, And down the rocks precipitate their course. Not with less rage the rival heroes take Their different ways; nor less destruction make. With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike; And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike. Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field; And hearts are pierced, unknowing how to yield: They blow for blow return, and wound for wound; And heaps of bodies raise the level ground. Murrhanus, boasting of his blood, that springs From a long royal race of Latian kings, Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown, Crushed with the weight of an unwieldy stone: Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore His living load, his dying body tore. His starting steeds, to shun the glittering sword, Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord. Fierce Hyllus threatened high, and, face to face, Affronted Turnus in the middle space: The prince encountered him in full career, And at his temples aimed the deadly spear; So fatally the flying weapon sped, That through his brazen helm it pierced his head. Nor, Cisseus, could'st thou 'scape from Turnus' hand, In vain the strongest of the Arcadian band: Nor to Cupencus could his gods afford Availing aid against the Ænean sword, Which to his naked heart pursued the course; Nor could his plated shield sustain the force. Iölas fell, whom not the Grecian powers, Nor great subverter of the Trojan towers, Were doomed to kill, while Heaven prolonged his date; But who can pass the bounds prefixed by Fate? In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held Two palaces, and was from each expelled: Of all the mighty man, the last remains A little spot of foreign earth contains. And now both hosts their broken troops unite In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight Serestus and undaunted Mnestheus join The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line: Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads. The poet had said, in the preceding lines, that Mnestheus, Serestus, and Asylas led on the Trojans, the Tuscans, and the Arcadians; but none of the printed copies which I have seen mention any leader of the Rutulians and Latins, but Messapus the son of Neptune. Ruæus takes notice of this passage, and seems to wonder at it; but gives no reason why Messapus is alone without a coadjutor. The four verses of Virgil run thus— Totæ adeo conversæ acies, omnesque Latini, Omnes Dardanidæ; Mnestheus, acerque Serestus, Et Messapus equûm domitor, et fortis Asylas, Tuscorumque phalanx, Evandrique Arcades alæ. I doubt not but the third line was originally thus— Et Messapus equûm domitor, et fortis Atinas; for the two names of Asylas and Atinas are so like that one might easily be mistaken for the other by the transcribers. And to fortify this opinion, we find afterward, in the relation of Saces to Turnus, that Atinas is joined with Messapus— Soli, pro portis, Messapus et acer Atinas Sustentant aciem — In general I observe, not only in this Æneïd, but in all the last six Books, that Æneas is never seen on horseback, and but once before, as I remember, in the fourth, where he hunts with Dido. The reason of this, if I guess aright, was a secret compliment which the poet made to his countrymen the Romans, the strength of whose armies consisted most in foot, which, I think, were all Romans and Italians. But their wings or squadrons were made up of their allies, who were foreigners. They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space, Resolved on death, impatient of disgrace; And, where one falls, another fills his place. The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son To leave the unfinished fight, and storm the town: For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain, He views the unguarded city from afar, In careless quiet, and secure of war. Occasion offers, and excites his mind To dare beyond the task he first designed. Resolved, he calls his chiefs: they leave the fight: Attended thus, he takes a neighbouring height: The crowding troops about their general stand, All under arms, and wait his high command. Then thus the lofty prince:—“Hear and obey, Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay. Jove is with us; and what I have decreed, Requires our utmost vigour, and our speed. Your instant arms against the town prepare, The source of mischief, and the seat of war. This day the Latian towers, that mate the sky, Shall, level with the plain, in ashes lie: The people shall be slaves, unless in time They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime. Twice have our foes been vanquished on the plain: Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain? Your force against the perjured city bend; There it began, and there the war shall end; The peace profaned our rightful arms requires; Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires.” He finished; and—one soul inspiring all— Formed in a wedge, the foot approach the wall. Without the town, an unprovided train Of gaping gazing citizens are slain. Some firebrands, others scaling ladders, bear, And those they toss aloft, and these they rear: The flames now launched, the feathered arrows fly, And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky. Advancing to the front, the hero stands, And, stretching out to heaven his pious hands, Attests the gods, asserts his innocence, Upbraids with breach of faith the Ausonian prince; Declares the royal honour doubly stained, And twice the rites of holy peace profaned. Dissenting clamours in the town arise: Each will be heard, and all at once advise. One part for peace, and one for war, contends: Some would exclude their foes, and some admit their friends. The helpless king is hurried in the throng, And (whate'er tide prevails) is borne along. Thus, when the swain, within a hollow rock, Invades the bees with suffocating smoke, They run around, or labour on their wings, Disused to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings; To shun the bitter fumes, in vain they try; Black vapours, issuing from the vent, involve the sky. But Fate and envious Fortune now prepare To plunge the Latins in the last despair. The queen, who saw the foes invade the town, And brands on tops of burning houses thrown, Cast round her eyes, distracted with her fear:— No troops of Turnus in the field appear. Once more she stares abroad, but still in vain, And then concludes the royal youth is slain. Mad with her anguish, impotent to bear The mighty grief, she loaths the vital air. She calls herself the cause of all this ill, And owns the dire effects of her ungoverned will; She raves against the gods; she beats her breast; She tears with both her hands her purple vest: Then round a beam a running noose she tied, And, fastened by the neck, obscenely died. Soon as the fatal news by fame was blown, And to her dames and to her daughter known, The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair, And rosy cheeks: the rest her sorrow share: With shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair. The spreading rumour fills the public place: Confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace, And silent shame, are seen in every face. Latinus tears his garments as he goes, Both for his public and his private woes; With filth his venerable beard besmears, And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs. And much he blames the softness of his mind, Obnoxious to the charms of womankind, And soon reduced to change what he so well designed— To break the solemn league so long desired, Nor finish what his fates, and those of Troy, required, Now Turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains. And here and there some straggling foes he gleans. His flying coursers please him less and less, Ashamed of easy fight, and cheap success. Thus half-contented, anxious in his mind, The distant cries come driving in the wind— Shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drowned; A jarring mixture, and a boding sound. “Alas!” said he, “what mean these dismal cries? What doleful clamours from the town arise?” Confused, he stops, and backward pulls the reins. She, who the driver's office now sustains, Replies:—“Neglect, my lord, these new alarms: Here fight, and urge the fortune of your arms: There want not others to defend the wall. If by your rival's hand the Italians fall, So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress, In honour equal, equal in success.” To this, the prince:—“O sister!—for I knew, The peace infringed proceeded first from you: I knew you, when you mingled first in fight: And now in vain you would deceive my sight— Why, goddess, this unprofitable care? Who sent you down from heaven, involved in air, Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain, And see your brother bleeding on the plain? For to what power can Turnus have recourse, Or how resist his fate's prevailing force? These eyes beheld Murrhanus bite the ground— Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound. I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath, My name invoking to revenge his death. Brave Ufens fell with honour on the place, To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace. On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies; His vest and armour are the victor's prize. Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame, Which only wanted, to complete my shame? How will the Latins hoot their champion's flight! How Drances will insult and point them to the sight! Is death so hard to bear?—Ye gods below! (Since those above so small compassion show), Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame, Which not belies my great forefathers' name.” He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed Came Saces urging on his foamy steed: Fixed on his wounded face a shaft he bore, And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before: “Turnus! on you, on you alone, depends Our last relief:—compassionate your friends! Like lightning, fierce Æneas, rolling on, With arms invests, with flames invades, the town: The brands are tossed on high; the winds conspire To drive along the deluge of the fire. All eyes are fixed on you: your foes rejoice; Even the king staggers, and suspends his choice— Doubts to deliver or defend the town, Whom to reject, or whom to call his son. The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were placed, Herself suborning death, has breathed her last. 'Tis true, Messapus, fearless of his fate, With fierce Atinas' aid, defends the gate: On every side surrounded by the foe, The more they kill, the greater numbers grow; An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow. You, far aloof from your forsaken bands, Your rolling chariot drive o'er empty sands.” Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declined, And various cares revolving in his mind: Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast, And sorrow mixed with shame, his soul opprest; And conscious worth lay labouring in his thought, And love by jealousy to madness wrought. By slow degrees his reason drove away The mists of passion, and resumed her sway. Then, rising on his car, he turned his look, And saw the town involved in fire and smoke. A wooden tower with flames already blazed, Which his own hands on beams and rafters raised. And bridges laid above to join the space, And wheels below to roll from place to place. “Sister! the Fates have vanquished: let us go The way which Heaven and my hard fortune show. The fight is fixed; nor shall the branded name Of a base coward blot your brother's fame. Death is my choice; but suffer me to try My force, and vent my rage before I die.” He said; and leaping down without delay, Through crowds of scattered foes he freed his way. Striding he passed, impetuous as the wind, And left the grieving goddess far behind. As, when a fragment, from a mountain torn By raging tempests, or by torrents borne, Or sapped by time, or loosened from the roots— Prone through the void the rocky ruin shoots, Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep; Down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep: Involved alike, they rush to nether ground; Stunned with the shock they fall, and stunned from earth rebound: So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town, Shouldering and shoving, bore the squadrons down. Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew, Where shafts and spears and darts promiscuous flew, And sanguine streams the slippery ground embrue. First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace, He cries aloud, to make the combat cease:— “Rutulians, hold! and Latin troops, retire! The fight is mine; and me the gods require. 'Tis just that I should vindicate alone The broken truce, or for the breach atone. This day shall free from wars the Ausonian state, Or finish my misfortunes in my fate.” Both armies from their bloody work desist, And, bearing backward, from a spacious list. The Trojan hero, who received from fame The welcome sound, and heard the champion's name, Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls: Greedy of war where greater glory calls, He springs to fight, exulting in his force; His jointed armour rattles in the course. Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows, Or father Apennine, when, white with snows, His head divine obscure in clouds he hides, And shakes the sounding forest on his sides. The nations, overawed, surcease the fight; Immovable their bodies, fixed their sight. Even death stands still; nor from above they throw Their darts, nor drive their battering-rams below. In silent order either army stands, And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands. The Ausonian king beholds, with wondering sight, Two mighty champions matched in single fight, Born under climes remote, and brought by fate, With swords to try their titles to the state. Now, in closed field, each other from afar They view; and, rushing on, begin the war. They launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet, The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet: Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high, And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly. Courage conspires with chance; and both engage With equal fortune and with mutual rage. As, when two bulls for their fair female fight In Sila's shades, or on Taburnus' height, With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies; Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes, And wait the event—which victor they shall bear, And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year: With rage of love the jealous rivals burn, And push for push, and wound for wound, return; Their dewlaps gored, their sides are laved in blood; Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow through the wood: Such was the combat in the listed ground; So clash their swords, and so their shields resound. Jove sets the beam: in either scale he lays The champions' fate, and each exactly weighs. On this side, life, and lucky chance ascends; Loaded with death, that other scale descends. Raised on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow Full on the helm of his unguarded foe: Shrill shouts and clamours ring on either side, As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide. But all in pieces flies the traitor sword, And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord. Now 'tis but death or flight; disarmed he flies, When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies. Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he joined, Hurrying to war, disordered in his mind, Snatched the first weapon which his haste could find. 'Twas not the fated sword his father bore, But that his charioteer Metiscus wore. This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held: But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield, The mortal-tempered steel deceived his hand: The shivered fragments shone amid the sand. Surprised with fear, he fled along the field, And now forthright, and now in orbits wheeled: For here the Trojan troops the list surround, And there the pass is closed with pools and marshy ground. Æneas hastens, though with heavier pace— His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase, And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse— Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues. Thus, when a fearful stag is closed around With crimson toils, or in a river found, High on the bank the deep-mouthed hound appears, Still opening, following still, where'er he steers; The persecuted creature, to and fro, Turns here and there, to 'scape his Umbrian foe: Steep is the ascent, and, if he gains the land, The purple death is pitched along the strand: His eager foe, determined to the chase, Stretched at his length, gains ground at every pace: Now to his beamy head he makes his way, And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey: Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear; He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air: The rocks, the lakes, the meadows, ring with cries; The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies. Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames His tardy troops, and calling by their names, Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats To lay in ashes, if they dare supply, With arms or aid, his vanquished enemy; Thus menacing, he still pursues the course, With vigour, though diminished of his force. Ten times already, round the listed place, One chief had fled, and t'other given the chase: No trivial prize is played; for on the life Or death of Turnus, now depends the strife. Within the space, an olive-tree had stood, A sacred shade, a venerable wood, For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god. Here hung the vests, and tablets were engraved, Of sinking mariners from shipwreck saved. With heedless hands the Trojans felled the tree, To make the ground enclosed for combat free. Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance, Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance; Then stooped, and tugged with force immense, to free The encumbered spear from the tenacious tree; That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain, His flying weapon might from far attain. Confused with fear, bereft of human aid, Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus, prayed:— “O Faunus! pity! and thou, mother Earth, Where I thy foster-son received my birth, Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand Your plant has honoured, which your foes profaned, Propitious hear my pious prayer!” He said, Nor with successless vows invoked their aid. The incumbent hero wrenched, and pulled, and strained; But still the stubborn earth the steel detained. Juturna took her time; and, while in vain He strove, assumed Metiscus' form again, And, in that imitated shape, restored To the despairing prince his Daunian sword. The queen of love—who, with disdain and grief, Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief— To assert her offspring with a greater deed, From the tough root the lingering weapon freed. Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance: One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance; And both resolved alike, to try their fatal chance. Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke, Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:— “What new arrest, O queen of heaven! is sent To stop the Fates now labouring in the event? What further hopes are left thee to pursue? Divine Æneas (and thou know'st it too), Foredoomed, to these celestial seats is due. What more attempts for Turnus can be made, That thus thou lingerest in this lonely shade? Is it becoming of the due respect And awful honour of a god elect, A wound unworthy of our state to feel, Patient of human hands, and earthly steel? Or seems it just, the sister should restore A second sword, when one was lost before, And arm a conquered wretch against his conqueror? For what, without thy knowledge and avow, Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do? At last, in deference to my love, forbear To lodge within thy soul this anxious care: Reclined upon my breast, thy grief unload:— Who should relieve the goddess, but the god? Now all things to their utmost issue tend, Pushed by the Fates to their appointed end. While leave was given thee, and a lawful hour For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted power, Tossed on the seas thou could'st thy foes distress, And, driven ashore, with hostile arms oppress; Deform the royal house; and, from the side Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:— Now cease at my command.” The Thunderer said; And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made:— “Because your dread decree too well I knew, From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew. Else should you not behold me here, alone, Involved in empty clouds, my friends bemoan, But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight Engaged against my foes in mortal fight. 'Tis true, Juturna mingled in the strife By my command, to save her brother's life, At least to try; but (by the Stygian lake— The most religious oath the gods can take) With this restriction, not to bend the bow, Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw. And now, resigned to your superior might, And tired with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight. This let me beg (and this no fates withstand) Both for myself and for your father's land, The words in the original are these— Pro Latio obtestor, pro majestate tuorum. Virgil very artfully uses here the word majestas, which the Romans loved so well that they appropriated it to themselves —Majestas populi Romani. This title, applied to kings, is very modern; and that is all I will say of it at present, though the word requires a larger note. In the word tuorum is included the sense of my translation, Your father's land, because Saturn, the father of Jove, had governed that part of Italy after his expulsion from Crete. But that on which I most insist, is the address of the poet in this speech of Juno. Virgil was sufficiently sensible, as I have said in the preface, that whatever the common opinion was concerning the descent of the Romans from the Trojans, yet the ancient customs, rites, laws, and habits of those Trojans were wholly lost, and perhaps also that they had never been: and, for this reason, he introduces Juno in this place, requesting of Jupiter that no memory might remain of Troy (the town she hated), that the people hereafter should not be called Trojans, nor retain anything which belonged to their predecessors. And why might not this also be concerted betwixt our author and his friend Horace, to hinder Augustus from rebuilding Troy, and removing thither the seat of empire, a design so unpleasing to the Romans? But of this I am not positive, because I have not consulted Dacier, and the rest of the critics, to ascertain the time in which Horace writ the ode relating to that subject. That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace (Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless), The laws of either nation be the same; But let the Latins still retain their name, Speak the same language which they spoke before, Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore. Call them not Trojans: perish the renown And name of Troy, with that detested town. Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign, And Rome's immortal majesty remain.” Then thus the founder of mankind replies (Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes):— “Can Saturn's issue, and Heaven's other heir, Such endless anger in her bosom bear? Be mistress, and your full desires obtain; But quench the choler you foment in vain. From ancient blood, the Ausonian people, sprung, Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue: The Trojans to their customs shall be tied. I will, myself, their common rites provide. The natives shall command, the foreigners subside. All shall be Latium; Troy without a name; And her lost sons forget from whence they came. From blood so mixed, a pious race shall flow, Equal to gods, excelling all below. No nation more respect to you shall pay, Or greater offerings on your altars lay.” Juno consents, well pleased that her desires Had found success, and from the cloud retires. The peace thus made, the Thunderer next prepares To force the watery goddess from the wars. Deep in the dismal regions void of light, Three daughters, at a birth, were born to Night: The father of these (not here mentioned) was Acheron: the names of the three were Alecto, Megæra, and Tisiphone. They were called Furies in hell, on earth Harpies, and in heaven Diræ. Two of these assisted at the throne of Jupiter, and were employed by him to punish the wickedness of mankind. These two must be Megæra and Tisiphone—not Alecto; for Juno expressly commands her to return to hell, from whence she came; and gives this reason— Te super ætherias errare licentius auras Haud pater ipse velit, summi regnator Olympi, Cede locis. Probably this Dira, unnamed by the poet in this place, might be Tisiphone; for, though we find her in hell, in the Sixth Æneïd, employed in the punishment of the damned— Continuo sontes ultrix, accincta flagello, Tisiphone quatit insultans, etc., yet afterwards she is on earth in the Tenth Æneïd, and amidst the battle— Pallida Tisiphone media inter millia sævit — which I guess to be Tisiphone, the rather, by the etymology of her name, which is compounded of ??? ulciscor, and ?????, cædes; part of her errand being to affright Turnus with the stings of a guilty conscience, and denounce vengeance against him for breaking the first treaty, by refusing to yield Lavinia to Æneas, to whom she was promised by her father—and, consequently, for being the author of an unjust war; and also for violating the second treaty, by declining the single combat, which he had stipulated with his rival, and called the gods to witness before their altars. As for the names of the Harpies (so called on earth), Hesiod tells us they were Iris, Aëllo, and Ocypete. Virgil calls one of them Celæno: this, I doubt not, was Alecto, whom Virgil calls, in the Third Æneïd, Furiarum maxima, and in the sixth again by the same name—Furiarum maxima juxta accubat. That she was the chief of the Furies, appears by her description in the Seventh Æneïd; to which, for haste, I refer the reader. These their brown mother, brooding on her care, Endued with windy wings to flit in air, With serpents girt alike, and crowned with hissing hair. In heaven the Diræ called, and still at hand, Before the throne of angry Jove they stand, His ministers of wrath, and ready still The minds of mortal men with fears to fill, Whene'er the moody sire, to wreak his hate On realms or towns deserving of their fate, Hurls down diseases, death, and deadly care, And terrifies the guilty world with war. One sister plague of these from heaven he sent, To fright Juturna with a dire portent. The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow, Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies, And drenched in poisonous juice, the sure destruction flies. With such a sudden, and unseen a flight, Shot through the clouds the daughter of the night. Soon as the field enclosed she had in view, And from afar her destined quarry knew— Contracted, to the boding bird she turns, Which haunts the ruined piles and hallowed urns, And beats about the tombs with nightly wings, Where songs obscene on sepulchres she sings. Thus lessened in her form, with frightful cries The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies, Flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes. A lazy chillness crept along his blood; Choked was his voice; his hair with horror stood. Juturna from afar beheld her fly, And knew the ill omen, by her screaming cry, And stridor of her wing. Amazed with fear, Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair. “Ah me!” she cries—“in this unequal strife, What can thy sister more to save thy life? Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend In arms with that inexorable fiend? Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night! The lashing of your wings I know too well, The sounding flight, and funeral screams of hell! These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove, The worthy recompense of ravished love! Did he for this exempt my life from fate? O hard conditions of immortal state! Though born to death, not privileged to die, But forced to bear imposed eternity! Take back your envious bribes, and let me go Companion to my brother's ghost below! The joys are vanished: nothing now remains Of life immortal, but immortal pains. What earth will open her devouring womb, To rest a weary goddess in the tomb? She drew a length of sighs; nor more she said, But in her azure mantle wrapped her head, Then plunged into her stream, with deep despair, And her last sobs came bubbling up in air. Now stern Æneas waves his weighty spear Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:— “What farther subterfuge can Turnus find? What empty hopes are harboured in his mind? 'Tis not thy swiftness can secure thy flight; Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight. Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare What skill and courage can attempt in war; Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky; Or hid within the hollow earth to lie!” The champion shook his head, and made this short reply:— “No threats of thine my manly mind can move; 'Tis hostile Heaven I dread, and partial Jove.” He said no more, but, with a sigh, repressed The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast. Then, as he rolled his troubled eyes around, An antique stone he saw, the common bound Of neighbouring fields, and barrier of the ground— So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days The enormous weight from earth could hardly raise. He heaved it at a lift, and, poised on high, Ran staggering on against his enemy, But so disordered, that he scarcely knew His way, or what unwieldy weight he threw. His knocking knees are bent beneath the load, And shivering cold congeals his vital blood. The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short For want of vigour, mocks his vain effort. And as, when heavy sleep has closed the sight, The sickly fancy labours in the night; We seem to run; and, destitute of force, Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course: In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry; The nerves, unbraced, their usual strength deny; And on the tongue the faltering accents die; So Turnus fared; whatever means he tried, All force of arms, and points of art employed, The Fury flew athwart, and made the endeavour void. A thousand various thoughts his soul confound; He stared about, nor aid nor issue found; His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround. Once more he pauses, and looks out again, And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain. Trembling he views the thundering chief advance, And brandishing aloft the deadly lance: Amazed he cowers beneath his conquering foe, Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow. Astonished while he stands, and fixed with fear, Aimed at his shield he sees the impending spear. The hero measured first, with narrow view, The destined mark; and, rising as he threw, With its full swing the fatal weapon flew. Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls, Or stones from battering-engines break the walls: Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong, The lance drove on, and bore the death along. Nought could his sevenfold shield the prince avail, Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail: It pierced through all, and with a grisly wound Transfixed his thigh, and doubled him to ground. With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky: Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply. Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid, With eyes cast upwards, and with arms displayed, And, recreant, thus to the proud victor prayed:— “I know my death deserved, nor hope to live: Use what the gods and thy good fortune give. Yet think, oh! think, if mercy may be shown (Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son), Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave; And, for Anchises' sake, old Daunus save! Or, if thy vowed revenge pursue my death, Give to my friends my body void of breath! The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life: Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife: Against a yielded man, 'tis mean ignoble strife.” In deep suspense the Trojan seemed to stand, And, just prepared to strike, repressed his hand. He rolled his eyes, and every moment felt His manly soul with more compassion melt; When, casting down a casual glance, he spied The golden belt that glittered on his side, The fatal spoil which haughty Turnus tore From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore. Then, roused anew to wrath, he loudly cries (Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes), “Traitor! dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend, Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend? To his sad soul a grateful offering go! 'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow.” He raised his arm aloft, and, at the word, Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword. The streaming blood distained his arms around, And the disdainful soul came rushing through the wound. POEMS ASCRIBED TO DRYDEN. AN ESSAY UPON SATIRE. The attribution of this poem is questionable. How dull, and how insensible a beast Is man, who yet would lord it o'er the rest! Philosophers and poets vainly strove In every age the lumpish mass to move; But those were pedants, when compared with these, Who know, not only to instruct, but please. Poets alone found the delightful way, Mysterious morals gently to convey In charming numbers; so that as men grew Pleased with their poems, they grew wiser too. Satire has always shone among the rest; And is the boldest way, if not the best, To tell men freely of their foulest faults, To laugh at their vain deeds, and vainer thoughts. In satire, too, the wise took different ways, To each deserving its peculiar praise. Some did all folly with just sharpness blame, Whilst others laughed and scorned them into shame. But of these two, the last succeeded best, As men aim rightest when they shoot in jest. Yet, if we may presume to blame our guides, And censure those, who censure all besides, In other things they justly are preferred; In this alone methinks the ancients erred: Against the grossest follies they declaim; Hard they pursue, but hunt ignoble game. Nothing is easier than such blots to hit, And 'tis the talent of each vulgar wit: Besides, 'tis labour lost; for, who would preach Morals to Armstrong, or dull Aston teach? 'Tis being devout at play, wise at a ball, Or bringing wit and friendship to Whitehall. But with sharp eyes those nicer faults to find, Which lie obscurely in the wisest mind, That little speck which all the rest does spoil,— To wash off that would be a noble toil; Beyond the loose-writ libels of this age, Or the forced scenes of our declining stage; Above all censure too, each little wit Will be so glad to see the greater hit; Who judging better, though concerned the most, Of such correction will have cause to boast. In such a satire all would seek a share, And every fool will fancy he is there. Old story-tellers, too, must pine and die, To see their antiquated wit laid by; Like her, who missed her name in a lampoon, And grieved to find herself decayed so soon. No common coxcomb must be mentioned here; Not the dull train of dancing sparks appear; Nor fluttering officers, who never fight; Of such a wretched rabble, who would write? Much less half-wits; that's more against our rules; For they are fops, the other are but fools. Who would not be as silly as Dunbar? As dull as Monmouth, rather than Sir Carr? The cunning courtier should be slighted too, Who with dull knavery makes so much ado; Till the shrewd fool, by thriving too too fast, Like Æsop's fox, becomes a prey at last. Nor shall the royal mistresses be named, Too ugly or too easy to be blamed; With which each rhyming fool keeps such a pother, They are as common that way as the other; Yet, sauntering Charles, between his beastly brace, Meets with dissembling still in either place, Affected humour, or a painted face. In loyal libels we have often told him, How one has jilted him, the other sold him: How that affects to laugh, how this to weep; But who can rail so long as he can sleep? Was ever prince by two at once misled, False, foolish, old, ill-natured, and ill-bred? Earnely and Aylesbury, with all that race— Of busy blockheads, shall have here no place; At council set as foils on Dorset's score, To make that great false jewel shine the more; Who all that while was thought exceeding wise, Only for taking pains, and telling lies. But there's no meddling with such nauseous men; Their very names have tired my lazy pen: 'Tis time to quit their company, and choose Some fitter subject for a sharper muse. First, let's behold the merriest man alive Against his careless genius vainly strive; Quit his dear ease, some deep design to lay, 'Gainst a set time, and then forget the day: Yet he will laugh at his best friends, and be Just as good company as Nokes and Lee. But when he aims at reason or at rule, He turns himself the best to ridicule. Let him at business ne'er so earnest sit, Show him but mirth, and bait that mirth with wit, That shadow of a jest shall be enjoyed, Though he left all mankind to be destroyed. So cat transformed sat gravely and demure, Till mouse appeared, and thought himself secure; But soon the lady had him in her eye, And from her friend did just as oddly fly. Reaching above our nature does no good; We must fall back to our old flesh and blood; As by our little Machiavel we find, That nimblest creature of the busy kind. His limbs are crippled, and his body shakes; Yet his hard mind, which all this bustle makes, No pity of its poor companion takes. What gravity can hold from laughing out, To see him drag his feeble legs about, Like hounds ill-coupled? Jowler lugs him still Through hedges, ditches, and through all that's ill. 'Twere crime in any man but him alone, To use a body so, though 'tis one's own: Yet this false comfort never gives him o'er, That, whilst he creeps, his vigorous thoughts can soar; Alas! that soaring to those few that know, Is but a busy grovelling here below. So men in rapture think they mount the sky, Whilst on the ground the entranced wretches lie: So modern fops have fancied they could fly. As the new earl, with parts deserving praise, And wit enough to laugh at his own ways, Yet loses all soft days and sensual nights, Kind nature checks, and kinder fortune slights; Striving against his quiet all he can, For the fine notion of a busy man. And what is that at best, but one, whose mind Is made to tire himself and all mankind? For Ireland he would go; faith, let him reign; For, if some odd fantastic lord would fain Carry in trunks, and all my drudgery do, I'll not only pay him, but admire him too. But is there any other beast that lives, Who his own harm so wittingly contrives? Will any dog that has his teeth and stones, Refinedly leave his bitches and his bones, To turn a wheel? and bark to be employed, While Venus is by rival dogs enjoyed? Yet this fond man, to get a statesman's name, Forfeits his friends, his freedom, and his fame. Though satire nicely writ with humour stings But those who merit praise in other things; Yet we must needs this one exception make, And break our rules for silly Tropos' sake; Who was too much despised to be accused, And therefore scarce deserves to be abused; Raised only by his mercenary tongue, For railing smoothly, and for reasoning wrong. As boys, on holidays let loose to play, Lay waggish traps for girls that pass that way; Then shout to see, in dirt and deep distress, Some silly cit in her flowered foolish dress,— So have I mighty satisfaction found, To see his tinsel reason on the ground: To see the florid fool despised, and know it, By some who scarce have words enough to show it; For sense sits silent, and condemns for weaker The finer, nay, sometimes the wittier speaker: But 'tis prodigious so much eloquence Should be acquired by such little sense; For words and wit did anciently agree, And Tully was no fool, though this man be: At bar abusive; on the bench unable; Knave on the woolsack; fop at council-table. These are the grievances of such fools as would Be rather wise than honest, great than good. Some other kind of wits must be made known, Whose harmless errors hurt themselves alone; Excess of luxury they think can please, And laziness call loving of their ease; To live dissolved in pleasures still they feign, Though their whole life's but intermitting pain; So much of surfeits, headaches, claps are seen, We scarce perceive the little time between; Well-meaning men, who make this gross mistake, And pleasure lose only for pleasure's sake; Each pleasure has its price, and when we pay Too much of pain, we squander life away. Thus Dorset, purring like a thoughtful cat, Married,—but wiser puss ne'er thought of that; And first he worried her with railing rhyme, Like Pembroke's mastiffs at his kindest time; Then for one night sold all his slavish life, A teeming widow, but a barren wife. Swelled by contact of such a fulsome toad, He lugged about the matrimonial load; Till fortune, blindly kind as well as he, Has ill restored him to his liberty; Which he would use in his old sneaking way, Drinking all night, and dozing all the day; Dull as Ned Howard, whom his brisker times Had famed for dulness and malicious rhymes. Mulgrave had much ado to 'scape the snare, Though learned in all those arts that cheat the fair; For, after all his vulgar marriage-mocks, With beauty dazzled, Numps was in the stocks; Deluded parents dried their weeping eyes, To see him catch his Tartar for his prize: The impatient town waited the wished-for change, And cuckolds smiled in hopes of sweet revenge; Till Petworth plot made us with sorrow see, As his estate, his person too was free: Him no soft thoughts, no gratitude could move; To gold he fled from beauty and from love; Yet failing there he keeps his freedom still, Forced to live happily against his will; 'Tis not his fault, if too much wealth and power Break not his boasted quiet every hour. And little Sid. for simile renowned, Pleasure has always sought, but never found; Though all his thoughts on wine and women fall, His are so bad, sure he ne'er thinks at all. The flesh he lives upon is rank and strong, His meat and mistresses are kept too long. But sure we all mistake this pious man, Who mortifies his person all he can: What we uncharitably take for sin, Are only rules of this odd capuchin; For never hermit, under grave pretence, Has lived more contrary to common sense; And 'tis a miracle, we may suppose, No nastiness offends his skilful nose; Which from all stink can, with peculiar art, Extract perfume and essence from a f?t. Expecting supper is his great delight; He toils all day but to be drunk at night; Then o'er his cups this night-bird chirping sits, Till he takes Hewet and Jack Hall for wits. Rochester I despise for want of wit, Though thought to have a tail and cloven feet; For, while he mischief means to all mankind, Himself alone the ill effects does find; And so, like witches, justly suffers shame, Whose harmless malice is so much the same. False are his words, affected is his wit; So often he does aim, so seldom hit; To every face he cringes while he speaks, But when the back is turned the head he breaks. Mean in each action, lewd in every limb, Manners themselves are mischievous in him; A proof that chance alone makes every creature, A very Killigrew without good nature. For what a Bessus has he always lived, And his own kickings notably contrived? For, there's the folly that's still mixt with fear, Cowards more blows than any hero bear; Of fighting sparks some may their pleasures say, But 'tis a bolder thing to run away. The world may well forgive him all his ill, For every fault does prove his penance still; Falsely he falls into some dangerous noose, And then as meanly labours to get loose; A life so infamous is better quitting, Spent in base injury and low submitting. I'd liked to have left out his poetry; Forgot by all almost as well as me. Sometimes he has some humour, never wit, And if it rarely, very rarely, hit, 'Tis under so much nasty rubbish laid, To find it out's the cinderwoman's trade, Who, for the wretched remnants of a fire, Must toil all day in ashes and in mire. So lewdly dull his idle works appear, The wretched text deserves no comments here; Where one poor thought sometimes, left all alone, For a whole page of dulness must atone. How vain a thing is man, and how unwise! E'en he, who would himself the most despise! I, who so wise and humble seem to be, Now my own vanity and pride can't see. While the world's nonsense is so sharply shown, We pull down others but to raise our own; That we may angels seem, we paint them elves, And are but satires to set up ourselves. I, who have all this while been finding fault, E'en with my master, who first satire taught; And did by that describe the task so hard, It seems stupendous and above reward; Now labour with unequal force to climb That lofty hill, unreached by former time,— 'Tis just that I should to the bottom fall, Learn to write well, or not to write at all. A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO MR. JULIAN, SECRETARY OF THE MUSES. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Thou common shore of this poetic town, Where all the excrements of wit are thrown; For sonnet, satire, bawdry, blasphemy, Are emptied, and disburdened all in thee: The choleric wight, untrussing all in rage, Finds thee, and lays his load upon thy page. Thou Julian, or thou wise Vespasian rather, Dost from this dung thy well-pickt guineas gather. All mischief's thine; transcribing, thou wilt stoop From lofty Middlesex to lowly Scroop. What times are these, when, in the hero's room, Bow-bending Cupid doth with ballads come, And little Aston offers to the bum? Can two such pigmies such a weight support, Two such Tom Thumbs of satire in a court? Poor George grows old, his muse worn out of fashion, Hoarsely he sung Ephelia's lamentation. Less art thou helped by Dryden's bed-rid age; That drone has lost his sting upon the stage. Resolve me, poor apostate, this my doubt, What hope hast thou to rub this winter out? Know, and be thankful then, for Providence By me hath sent thee this intelligence. A knight there is, if thou canst gain his grace, Known by the name of the hard-favoured face. For prowess of the pen renowned is he, From Don Quixote descended lineally; And though, like him, unfortunate he prove, Undaunted in attempts of wit and love. Of his unfinished face, what shall I say,— But that 'twas made of Adam's own red clay; That much, much ochre was on it bestowed; God's image 'tis not, but some Indian god: Our Christian earth can no resemblance bring, But ware of Portugal for such a thing; Such carbuncles his fiery face confess, As no Hungarian water can redress. A face which, should he see (but Heaven was kind, And, to indulge his self, Love made him blind), He durst not stir abroad for fear to meet Curses of teeming women in the street: The best could happen from this hideous sight, Is, that they should miscarry with the fright,— Heaven guard them from the likeness of the knight: Such is our charming Strephon's outward man, His inward parts let those disclose who can. One while he honoureth Birtha with his flame, And now he chants no less Lovisa's name; For when his passion hath been bubbling long, The scum at last boils up into a song; And sure no mortal creature, at one time, Was e'er so far o'ergone with love and rhyme. To his dear self of poetry he talks, His hands and feet are scanning as he walks; His writhing looks his pangs of wit accuse, The airy symptoms of a breeding muse, And all to gain the great Lovisa's grace, But never pen did pimp for such a face; There's not a nymph in city, town, or court, But Strephon's billet-doux has been their sport Still he loves on, yet still he's sure to miss, As they who wash an Ethiop's face, or his. What fate unhappy Strephon does attend, Never to get a mistress, nor a friend! Strephon alike both wits and fools detest, 'Cause he's like Esop's bat, half-bird, half-beast; For fools to poetry have no pretence, And common wit supposes common sense; Not quite so low as fool, nor quite a top, He hangs between them both, and is a fop. His morals, like his wit, are motley too; He keeps from arrant knave with much ado. But vanity and lying so prevail, That one grain more of each would turn the scale; He would be more a villain had he time, But he's so wholly taken up with rhyme, That he mistakes his talent; all his care Is to be thought a poet fine and fair. Small beer and gruel are his meat and drink, The diet he prescribes himself to think; Rhyme next his heart he takes at the morn peep, Some love epistles at the hour of sleep;— So, betwixt elegy and ode, we see Strephon is in a course of poetry. This is the man ordained to do thee good, The pelican to feed thee with his blood; Thy wit, thy poet, nay thy friend, for he Is fit to be a friend to none but thee. Make sure of him, and of his muse betimes, For all his study is hung round with rhymes. Laugh at him, jostle him, yet still he writes, In rhyme he challenges, in rhyme he fights. Charged with the last, and basest infamy, His business is to think what rhymes to lie; Which found, in fury he retorts again. Strephon's a very dragon at his pen; His brother murdered, and his mother's whored, His mistress lost, and yet his pen's his sword. THE ART OF POETRY. CANTO I. Rash author, 'tis a vain presumptuous crime, To undertake the sacred art of rhyme; If at thy birth the stars that ruled thy sense Shone not with a poetic influence, In thy strait genius thou wilt still be bound, Find Phœbus deaf, and Pegasus unsound. You, then, that burn with the desire to try The dangerous course of charming poetry, Forbear in fruitless verse to lose your time, Or take for genius the desire of rhyme; Fear the allurements of a specious bait, And well consider your own force and weight. Nature abounds in wits of every kind, And for each author can a talent find. One may in verse describe an amorous flame, Another sharpen a short epigram; Waller a hero's mighty acts extol, Spencer sing Rosalind in pastoral: But authors, that themselves too much esteem, Lose their own genius, and mistake their theme; Thus in times past Dubartas vainly writ, Allaying sacred truth with trifling wit; Impertinently, and without delight, Described the Israelites' triumphant flight; And, following Moses o'er the sandy plain, Perished with Pharaoh in the Arabian main. Whate'er you write of pleasant or sublime, Always let sense accompany your rhyme. Falsely they seem each other to oppose; Rhyme must be made with Reason's laws to close; And when to conquer her you bend your force, The mind will triumph in the noble course. To Reason's yoke she quickly will incline, Which, far from hurting, renders her divine; But if neglected, will as easily stray, And master Reason, which she should obey. Love Reason, then; and let whate'er you write Borrow from her its beauty, force, and light. Most writers mounted on a resty muse, Extravagant and senseless objects chuse; They think they err, if in their verse they fall On any thought that's plain or natural. Fly this excess; and let Italians be Vain authors of false glittering poetry. All ought to aim at sense; but most in vain Strive the hard pass and slippery path to gain; You drown, if to the right or left you stray; Reason to go has often but one way. Sometimes an author, fond of his own thought, Pursues its object till it's overwrought: If he describes a house, he shows the face, And after walks you round from place to place; Here is a vista, there the doors unfold, Balconies here are ballustred with gold; Then counts the rounds and ovals in the halls, “The festoons, friezes, and the astragals:” Tired with his tedious pomp, away I run, And skip o'er twenty pages, to be gone. Of such descriptions the vain folly see, And shun their barren superfluity. All that is needless carefully avoid; The mind once satisfied is quickly cloyed: He cannot write, who knows not to give o'er; To mend one fault, he makes a hundred more: A verse was weak, you turn it much too strong, And grow obscure for fear you should be long. Some are not gaudy, but are flat and dry; Not to be low, another soars too high. Would you of every one deserve the praise? In writing vary your discourse and phrase; A frozen style, that neither ebbs nor flows, Instead of pleasing, makes us gape and dose. Those tedious authors are esteemed by none Who tire us, humming the same heavy tone. Happy who in his verse can gently steer, From grave to light; from pleasant to severe: His works will be admired wherever found, And oft with buyers will be compassed round. In all you write, be neither low nor vile; The meanest theme may have a proper style. The dull burlesque appeared with impudence, And pleased by novelty in spite of sense. All, except trivial points, grew out of date; Parnassus spoke the cant of Billingsgate; Boundless and mad, disordered rhyme was seen; Disguised Apollo changed to Harlequin. This plague, which first in country towns began, Cities and kingdoms quickly overran; The dullest scribblers some admirers found, And the “Mock Tempest” was a while renowned. But this low stuff the town at last despised, And scorned the folly that they once had prized; Distinguished dull from natural and plain, And left the villages to Flecknoe's reign. Let not so mean a style your muse debase, But learn from Butler the buffooning grace; And let burlesque in ballads be employed, Yet noisy bombast carefully avoid; Nor think to raise, though on Pharsalia's plain, “Millions of mourning mountains of the slain:” Nor with Dubartas bridle up the floods, And periwig with wool the baldpate woods. Chuse a just style; be grave without constraint, Great without pride, and lovely without paint: Write what your reader may be pleased to hear, And for the measure have a careful ear. On easy numbers fix your happy choice; Of jarring sounds avoid the odious noise: The fullest verse, and the most laboured sense, Displease us, if the ear once take offence. Our ancient verse, as homely as the times, Was rude, unmeasured, only tagged with rhymes; Number and cadence, that have since been shown, To those unpolished writers were unknown. Fairfax was he, who, in that darker age, By his just rules restrained poetic rage; Spenser did next in pastorals excel, And taught the noble art of writing well; To stricter rules the stanza did restrain, And found for poetry a richer vein. Then D'Avenant came, who, with a new-found art, Changed all, spoiled all, and had his way apart; His haughty muse all others did despise, And thought in triumph to bear off the prize, 'Til the sharp-sighted critics of the times, In their Mock-Gondibert, exposed his rhymes; The laurels he pretended did refuse, And dashed the hopes of his aspiring muse. This headstrong writer falling from on high, Made following authors take less liberty. Waller came last, but was the first whose art Just weight and measure did to verse impart; That of a well-placed word could teach the force, And showed for poetry a nobler course; His happy genius did our tongue refine, And easy words with pleasing numbers join; His verses to good method did apply, And changed hard discord to soft harmony. All owned his laws; which, long approved and tried, To present authors now may be a guide. Tread boldly in his steps, secure from fear, And be, like him, in your expressions clear. If in your verse you drag, and sense delay, My patience tires, my fancy goes astray; And from your vain discourse I turn my mind, Nor search an author troublesome to find. There is a kind of writer pleased with sound, Whose fustian head with clouds is compassed round, No reason can disperse them with its light: Learn then to think ere you pretend to write. As your idea's clear, or else obscure, The expression follows perfect or impure: What we conceive with ease we can express; Words to the notions flow with readiness. Observe the language well in all you write, And swerve not from it in your loftiest flight. The smoothest verse, and the exactest sense, Displease us, if ill English give offence: A barbarous phrase no reader can approve; Nor bombast, noise, or affectation love. In short, without pure language, what you write Can never yield us profit or delight. Take time for thinking; never work in haste; And value not yourself for writing fast. A rapid poem, with such fury writ, Shows want of judgment, not abounding wit. More pleased we are to see a river lead His gentle streams along a flowery mead, Than from high banks to hear loud torrents roar, With foamy waters on a muddy shore. Gently make haste, of labour not afraid; A hundred times consider what you've said: Polish, repolish, every colour lay, And sometimes add, but oftener take away. 'Tis not enough, when swarming faults are writ, That here and there are scattered sparks of wit: Each object must be fixed in the due place, And differing parts have corresponding grace; Till, by a curious art disposed, we find One perfect whole, of all the pieces joined. Keep to your subject close in all you say; Nor for a sounding sentence ever stray. The public censure for your writings fear, And to yourself be critic most severe. Fantastic wits their darling follies love; But find you faithful friends that will reprove, That on your works may look with careful eyes, And of your faults be zealous enemies: Lay by an author's pride and vanity, And from a friend a flatterer descry, Who seems to like, but means not what he says: Embrace true counsel, but suspect false praise. A sycophant will every thing admire; Each verse, each sentence sets his soul on fire: All is divine! there's not a word amiss! He shakes with joy, and weeps with tenderness; He overpowers you with his mighty praise. Truth never moves in those impetuous ways; A faithful friend is careful of your fame, And freely will your heedless errors blame; He cannot pardon a neglected line, But verse to rule and order will confine; Reprove of words the too-affected sound;— Here the sense flags, and your expression's round, Your fancy tires, and your discourse grows vain, Your terms improper; make it just and plain.— Thus 'tis a faithful friend will freedom use; But authors, partial to their darling muse, Think to protect it they have just pretence, And at your friendly counsel take offence.— Said you of this, that the expression's flat? Your servant, sir, you must excuse me that, He answers you.—This word has here no grace, Pray leave it out;—that, sir, 's the properest place.— This turn I like not;—'tis approved by all. Thus, resolute not from one fault to fall, If there's a syllable of which you doubt, 'Tis a sure reason not to blot it out. Yet still he says you may his faults confute, And over him your power is absolute. But of his feigned humility take heed; 'Tis a bait laid to make you hear him read. And when he leaves you happy in his muse, Restless he runs some other to abuse, And often finds; for in our scribbling times No fool can want a sot to praise his rhymes. The flattest work has ever in the court Met with some zealous ass for its support; And in all times a forward scribbling fop Has found some greater fool to cry him up. CANTO II. PASTORAL. As a fair nymph, when rising from her bed, With sparkling diamonds dresses not her head, But without gold, or pearl, or costly scents, Gathers from neighbouring fields her ornaments; Such, lovely in its dress, but plain withal, Ought to appear a perfect Pastoral. Its humble method nothing has of fierce, But hates the rattling of a lofty verse; There native beauty pleases, and excites, And never with harsh sounds the ear affrights. But in this style a poet often spent, In rage throws by his rural instrument, And vainly, when disordered thoughts abound, Amidst the Eclogue makes the trumpet sound: Pan flies alarmed into the neighbouring woods, And frighted nymphs dive down into the floods. Opposed to this, another, low in style, Makes shepherds speak a language base and vile: His writings, flat and heavy, without sound, Kissing the earth, and creeping on the ground, You'd swear that Randal, in his rustic strains, Again was quavering to the country swains, And changing, without care of sound or dress, Strephon and Phyllis, into Tom and Bess. 'Twixt these extremes 'tis hard to keep the right; For guides take Virgil, and read Theocrite: Be their just writings, by the gods inspired, Your constant pattern, practised, and admired. By them alone you'll easily comprehend How poets, without shame, may condescend To sing of gardens, fields, of flowers, and fruit, To stir up shepherds, and to tune the flute; Of love's rewards to tell the happy hour, Daphne a tree, Narcissus made a flower, And by what means the Eclogue yet has power To make the woods worthy a conqueror: This of their writings is the grace and flight; Their risings lofty, yet not out of sight. ELEGY. The Elegy, that loves a mournful style, With unbound hair weeps at a funeral pile; It paints the lover's torments and delights, A mistress flatters, threatens, and invites: But well these raptures if you'll make us see, You must know love as well as poetry. I hate those lukewarm authors, whose forced fire In a cold style describes a hot desire; That sigh by rule, and, raging in cold blood, Their sluggish muse whip to an amorous mood; Their feigned transports appear but flat and vain; They always sigh, and always hug their chain, Adore their prison, and their sufferings bless, Make sense and reason quarrel as they please. 'Twas not of old in this affected tone, That smooth Tibullus made his amorous moan; Nor Ovid, when instructed from above, By nature's rules he taught the art of love. The heart in Elegies forms the discourse. ODE. The Ode is bolder, and has greater force; Mounting to heaven in her ambitious flight, Amongst the gods and heroes takes delight; Of Pisa's wrestlers tells the sinewy force, And sings the dusty conqueror's glorious course; To Simois' streams does fierce Achilles bring, And makes the Ganges bow to Britain's king, Sometimes she flies like an industrious bee, And robes the flowers by nature's chemistry, Describes the shepherd's dances, feasts, and bliss, And boasts from Phyllis to surprise a kiss, When gently she resists with feigned remorse, That what she grants may seem to be by force: Her generous style at random oft will part, And by a brave disorder shows her art. Unlike those fearful poets, whose cold rhyme In all their raptures keeps exactest time, That sing the illustrious hero's mighty praise (Lean writers!) by the terms of weeks and days; And dare not from least circumstances part, But take all towns by strictest rules of art: Apollo drives those fops from his abode; And some have said that once the humorous god Resolving all such scribblers to confound, For the short Sonnet ordered this strict bound; Set rules for the just measure, and the time, The easy running and alternate rhyme; But above all, those licences denied Which in these writings the lame sense supplied; Forbade an useless line should find a place, Or a repeated word appear with grace. A faultless Sonnet, finished thus, would be Worth tedious volumes of loose poetry. A hundred scribbling authors without ground, Believe they have this only phœnix found: When yet the exactest scarce have two or three, Among whole tomes from faults and censure free. The rest, but little read, regarded less, Are shovelled to the pastry from the press. Closing the sense within the measured time, 'Tis hard to fit the reason to the rhyme. EPIGRAM. The Epigram, with little art composed, Is one good sentence in a distich closed. These points that by Italians first were prized, Our ancient authors knew not, or despised: The vulgar dazzled with their glaring light, To their false pleasures quickly they invite; But public favour so increased their pride, They overwhelmed Parnassus with their tide The Madrigal at first was overcome, And the proud Sonnet fell by the same doom; With these grave Tragedy adorned her flights, And mournful Elegy her funeral rites: A hero never failed them on the stage, Without his point a lover durst not rage; The amorous shepherds took more care to prove True to his point, than faithful to their love. Each word, like Janus, had a double face; And prose, as well as verse, allowed it place: The lawyer with conceits adorned his speech, The parson without quibbling could not preach. At last affronted Reason looked about, And from all serious matters shut them out; Declared that none should use them without shame, Except a scattering in the Epigram; Provided that by art, and in due time, They turned upon the thought, and not the rhyme. Thus in all parts disorders did abate: Yet quibblers in the court had leave to prate; Insipid jesters, and unpleasant fools, A corporation of dull punning drolls. 'Tis not, but that sometimes a dexterous muse May with advantage a turned sense abuse, And on a word may trifle with address; But above all avoid the fond excess, And think not, when your verse and sense are lame, With a dull point to tag your Epigram. Each poem his perfection has apart; The British round in plainness shows his art. The Ballad, though the pride of ancient time, Has often nothing but his humorous rhyme; The Madrigal may softer passions move, And breathe the tender ecstasies of love. Desire to show itself, and not to wrong, Armed Virtue first with Satire in its tongue. SATIRE. Lucilius was the man, who, bravely bold, To Roman vices did his mirror hold, Protected humble goodness from reproach, Showed worth on foot, and rascals in the coach. Horace his pleasing wit to this did add, And none uncensured could be fool or mad: Unhappy was that wretch, whose name might be Squared to the rules of their sharp poetry. Persius obscure, but full of sense and wit, Affected brevity in all he writ; And Juvenal, learned as those times could be, Too far did stretch his sharp hyperbole; Though horrid truths through all his labours shine, In what he writes there's something of divine, Whether he blames the Caprean debauch, Or of Sejanus' fall tells the approach, Or that he makes the trembling senate come To the stern tyrant to receive their doom; Or Roman vice in coarsest habits shows, And paints an empress reeking from the stews: In all he writes appears a noble fire; To follow such a master then desire. Chaucer alone, fixed on this solid base, In his old style conserves a modern grace: Too happy, if the freedom of his rhymes Offended not the method of our times. The Latin writers decency neglect; But modern authors challenge our respect, And at immodest writings take offence, If clean expression cover not the sense. I love sharp Satire, from obsceneness free; Not impudence, that preaches modesty: Our English, who in malice never fail, Hence in lampoons and libels learn to rail; Pleasant detraction, that by singing goes From mouth to mouth, and as it marches grows: Our freedom in our poetry we see, That child of joy begot by liberty. But, vain blasphemer, tremble when you chuse God for the subject of your impious muse: At last, those jests which libertines invent, Bring the lewd author to just punishment. Even in a song there must be art and sense; Yet sometimes we have seen that wine, or chance, Have warmed cold brains, and given dull writers mettle, And furnished out a scene for Mr. Settle. But for one lucky hit, that made thee please, Let not thy folly grow to a disease, Nor think thyself a wit; for in our age If a warm fancy does some fop engage, He neither eats nor sleeps till he has writ, But plagues the world with his adulterate wit. Nay, 'tis a wonder, if, in his dire rage, He prints not his dull follies for the stage; And in the front of all his senseless plays, Makes David Logan crown his head with bays. CANTO III. TRAGEDY. There's not a monster bred beneath the sky, But well-disposed by art, may please the eye: A curious workman by his skill divine, From an ill object makes a good design. Thus to delight us, Tragedy, in tears For Œdipus, provokes our hopes and fears; For parricide Orestes asks relief, And, to increase our pleasure, causes grief. You, then, that in this noble art would rise, Come, and in lofty verse dispute the prize. Would you upon the stage acquire renown, And for your judges summon all the town? Would you your works for ever should remain, And after ages past be sought again? In all you write, observe with care and art To move the passions, and incline the heart. If in a laboured act, the pleasing rage Cannot our hopes and fears by turns engage, Nor in our mind a feeling pity raise, In vain with learned scenes you fill your plays: Your cold discourse can never move the mind Of a stern critic, naturally unkind, Who, justly tired with your pedantic flight, Or falls asleep, or censures all you write. The secret is, attention first to gain; To move our minds, and then to entertain; That from the very opening of the scenes, The first may show us what the author means. I'm tired to see an actor on the stage, That knows not whether he's to laugh or rage; Who, an intrigue unravelling in vain, Instead of pleasing keeps my mind in pain. I'd rather much the nauseous dunce should say Downright, my name is Hector in the play; Than with a mass of miracles, ill-joined, Confound my ears, and not instruct my mind. The subject's never soon enough exprest; Your place of action must be fixed, and rest. A Spanish poet may with good event, In one day's space whole ages represent; There oft the hero of a wandering stage Begins a child, and ends the play of age: But we, that are by reason's rules confined, Will, that with art the poem be designed; That unity of action, time, and place, Keep the stage full, and all our labours grace. Write not what cannot be with ease conceived; Some truths may be too strong to be believed. A foolish wonder cannot entertain; My mind's not moved if your discourse be vain. You may relate what would offend the eye: Seeing, indeed, would better satisfy; But there are objects that a curious art Hides from the eyes, yet offers to the heart. The mind is most agreeably surprised, When a well-woven subject, long disguised, You on a sudden artfully unfold, And give the whole another face and mould. At first the Tragedy was void of art; A song, where each man danced and sung his part, And of god Bacchus roaring out the praise, Sought a good vintage for their jolly days: Then wine and joy were seen in each man's eyes, And a fat goat was the best singer's prize. Thespis was first, who, all besmeared with lee, Began this pleasure for posterity: And with his carted actors, and a song, Amused the people as he passed along. Next Æschylus the different persons placed, And with a better mask his players graced: Upon a theatre his verse expressed, And showed his hero with a buskin dressed. Then Sophocles, the genius of his age, Increased the pomp and beauty of the stage, Engaged the chorus song in every part, And polished rugged verse by rules of art: He in the Greek did those perfections gain, Which the weak Latin never could attain. Our pious fathers, in their priest-rid age, As impious and profane, abhorred the stage: A troop of silly pilgrims, as 'tis said, Foolishly zealous, scandalously played, Instead of heroes, and of love's complaints, The angels, God, the Virgin, and the saints. At last, right Reason did his laws reveal, And showed the folly of their ill-placed zeal, Silenced those nonconformists of the age, And raised the lawful heroes of the stage: Only the Athenian mask was laid aside, And chorus by the music was supplied. Ingenious love, inventive in new arts, Mingled in plays, and quickly touched our hearts: This passion never could resistance find, But knows the shortest passage to the mind. Paint then, I'm pleased my hero be in love; But let him not like a tame shepherd move; Let not Achilles be like Thyrsis seen, Or for a Cyrus show an Artamen; That struggling oft, his passions we may find, The frailty, not the virtue of his mind. Of romance heroes shun the low design; Yet to great hearts some human frailties join: Achilles must with Homer's heat engage; For an affront I'm pleased to see him rage. Those little failings in your hero's heart Show that of man and nature he has part. To leave known rules you cannot be allowed; Make Agamemnon covetous and proud, Æneas in religious rites austere. Keep to each man his proper character. Of countries and of times the humours know; From different climates different customs grow: And strive to shun their fault, who vainly dress An antique hero like some modern ass; Who make old Romans like our English move, Show Cato sparkish, or make Brutus love. In a romance those errors are excused: There 'tis enough that, reading, we're amused: Rules too severe would there be useless found; But the strict scene must have a juster bound; Exact decorum we must always find. If, then, you form some hero in your mind, Be sure your image with itself agree; For what he first appears, he still must be. Affected wits will naturally incline To paint their figures by their own design; Your bully poets, bully heroes write; Chapman in Bussy D'Ambois took delight, And thought perfection was to huff and fight. Wise nature by variety does please; Clothe differing passions in a differing dress. Bold anger, in rough haughty words appears; Sorrow is humble, and dissolves in tears. Make not your Hecuba with fury rage, And show a ranting grief upon the stage; Or tell in vain how the rough Tanais bore His sevenfold waters to the Euxine shore: These swoln expressions, this affected noise, Shows like some pedant that declaims to boys. In sorrow you must softer methods keep; And, to excite our tears, yourself must weep. Those noisy words with which ill plays abound, Come not from hearts that are in sadness drowned. The theatre for a young poet's rhymes Is a bold venture in our knowing times: An author cannot easily purchase fame; Critics are always apt to hiss, and blame: You may be judged by every ass in town, The privilege is bought for half-a-crown. To please, you must a hundred changes try; Sometimes be humble, then must soar on high; In noble thoughts must everywhere abound, Be easy, pleasant, solid, and profound; To these you must surprising touches join, And show us a new wonder in each line; That all, in a just method well-designed, May leave a strong impression in the mind. These are the arts that tragedy maintain: THE EPIC. But the Heroic claims a loftier strain. In the narration of some great design, Invention, art, and fable, all must join: Here fiction must employ its utmost grace; All must assume a body, mind, and face: Each virtue a divinity is seen; Prudence is Pallas; Beauty, Paphos' queen. 'Tis not a cloud from whence swift lightnings fly, But Jupiter, that thunders from the sky; Nor a rough storm that gives the sailor pain, But angry Neptune plowing up the main; Echo's no more an empty airy sound, But a fair nymph that weeps her lover drowned. Thus in the endless treasure of his mind, The poet does a thousand figures find; Around the work his ornaments he pours, And strows with lavish hand his opening flowers. 'Tis not a wonder if a tempest bore The Trojan fleet against the Libyan shore; From faithless fortune this is no surprise, For every day 'tis common to our eyes: But angry Juno, that she might destroy, And overwhelm the rest of ruined Troy; That Æolus, with the fierce goddess joined, Opened the hollow prisons of the wind; Till angry Neptune, looking o'er the main, Rebukes the tempest, calms the waves again, Their vessels from the dangerous quicksands steers. These are the springs that move our hopes and fears: Without these ornaments before our eyes, The unsinewed poem languishes and dies: Your poet in his art will always fail, And tell you but a dull insipid tale. In vain have our mistaken authors tried To lay these ancient ornaments aside, Thinking our God, and prophets that he sent, Might act like those the poet did invent, To fright poor readers in each line with hell, And talk of Satan, Ashtaroth, and Bel. The mysteries which Christians must believe, Disdain such shifting pageants to receive: The gospel offers nothing to our thoughts But penitence, or punishment for faults; And mingling falsehoods with these mysteries, Would make our sacred truths appear like lies. Besides, what pleasure can it be to hear The howlings of repining Lucifer, Whose rage at your imagined hero flies, And oft with God himself disputes the prize? Tasso, you'll say, has done it with applause:— It is not here I mean to judge his cause: Yet though our age has so extolled his name, His works had never gained immortal fame, If holy Godfrey in his ecstasies Had only conquered Satan on his knees; If Tancred and Armida's pleasing form Did not his melancholy theme adorn. 'Tis not, that Christian poems ought to be Filled with the fictions of idolatry; But, in a common subject, to reject The gods, and heathen ornaments neglect; To banish Tritons, who the seas invade, To take Pan's whistle, or the Fates degrade, To hinder Charon in his leaky boat To pass the shepherd with the man of note, Is with vain scruples to disturb your mind, And search perfection you can never find: As well they may forbid us to present Prudence or Justice for an ornament, To paint old Janus with his front of brass, And take from Time his scythe, his wings, and glass, And everywhere, as 'twere idolatry, Banish descriptions from our poetry. Leave them their pious follies to pursue; But let our reason such vain fears subdue: And let us not, amongst our vanities, Of the true God create a god of lies. In fable we a thousand pleasures see, And the smooth names seem made for poetry; As Hector, Alexander, Helen, Phyllis, Ulysses, Agamemnon, and Achilles: In such a crowd, the poet were to blame To choose King Chilperic for his hero's name. Sometimes the name, being well or ill applied, Will the whole fortune of your work decide. Would you your reader never should be tired, Choose some great hero, fit to be admired, In courage signal, and in virtue bright; Let even his very failings give delight; Let his great actions our attention bind, Like Cæsar, or like Scipio, frame his mind, And not like Œdipus his perjured race; A common conqueror is a theme too base. Choose not your tale of accidents too full; Too much variety may make it dull: Achilles' rage alone, when wrought with skill, Abundantly does a whole Iliad fill. Be your narrations lively, short, and smart; In your descriptions show your noblest art: There 'tis your poetry may be employed. Yet you must trivial accidents avoid, Nor imitate that fool, who, to describe The wondrous marches of the chosen tribe, Placed on the sides, to see their armies pass, The fishes staring through the liquid glass; Described a child, who, with his little hand, Picked up the shining pebbles from the sand. Such objects are too mean to stay our sight; Allow your work a just and nobler flight. Be your beginning plain; and take good heed Too soon you mount not on the airy steed; Nor tell your reader, in a thundering verse, “I sing the conqueror of the universe.” What can an author after this produce? The labouring mountain must bring forth a mouse. Much better are we pleased with his address, Who, without making such vast promises, Says, in an easier style and plainer sense, “I sing the combats of that pious prince, Who from the Phrygian coasts his armies bore, And landed first on the Lavinian shore.” His opening muse sets not the world on fire, And yet performs more than we can require: Quickly you'll hear him celebrate the fame, And future glory of the Roman name; Of Styx and Acheron describe the floods, And Cæsar's wandering in the Elysian woods; With figures numberless his story grace, And everything in beauteous colours trace. At once you may be pleasing and sublime: I hate a heavy melancholy rhyme: I'd rather read Orlando's comic tale, Than a dull author always stiff and stale, Who thinks himself dishonoured in his style, If on his works the Graces do but smile. 'Tis said that Homer, matchless in his art, Stole Venus' girdle to engage the heart: His works indeed vast treasures do unfold, And whatsoe'er he touches turns to gold: All in his hands new beauty does acquire; He always pleases, and can never tire. A happy warmth he everywhere may boast; Nor is he in too long disgressions lost: His verses without rule a method find, And of themselves appear in order joined; All without trouble answers his intent; Each syllable is tending to the event. Let his example your endeavours raise; To love his writings is a kind of praise. A poem, where we all perfections find, Is not the work of a fantastic mind; There must be care, and time, and skill, and pains; Not the first heat of inexperienced brains. Yet sometimes artless poets, when the rage Of a warm fancy does their minds engage, Puffed with vain pride, presume they understand, And boldly take the trumpet in their hand: Their fustian muse each accident confounds; Nor can she fly, but rise by leaps and bounds, Till, their small stock of learning quickly spent, Their poem dies for want of nourishment. In vain mankind the hot-brained fool decries, No branding censures can unveil his eyes; With impudence the laurel they invade, Resolved to like the monsters they have made. Virgil, compared to them, is flat and dry; And Homer understood not poetry: Against their merit if this age rebel, To future times for justice they appeal. But waiting till mankind shall do them right, And bring their works triumphantly to light, Neglected heaps we in bye-corners lay, Where they become to worms and moths a prey. Forgot, in dust and cobwebs let them rest, Whilst we return from whence we first digrest. The great success which tragic writers found, In Athens first the comedy renowned. The abusive Grecian there, by pleasing ways, Dispersed his natural malice in his plays: Wisdom and virtue, honour, wit, and sense, Were subject to buffooning insolence: Poets were publicly approved, and sought, That vice extolled, and virtue set at nought; A Socrates himself, in that loose age, Was made the pastime of a scoffing stage. At last the public took in hand the cause, And cured this madness by the power of laws; Forbade at any time, or any place, To name the person, or describe the face. The stage its ancient fury thus let fall, And comedy diverted without gall: By mild reproofs recovered minds diseased, And, sparing persons, innocently pleased. Each one was nicely shown in this new glass, And smiled to think he was not meant the ass: A miser oft would laugh at first, to find A faithful draught of his own sordid mind; And fops were with such care and cunning writ, They liked the piece for which themselves did sit. You, then, that would the comic laurels wear, To study nature be your only care. Whoe'er knows man, and by a curious art Discerns the hidden secrets of the heart; He who observes, and naturally can paint The jealous fool, the fawning sycophant, A sober wit, an enterprising ass, A humorous Otter, or a Hudibras,— May safely in those noble lists engage, And make them act and speak upon the stage. Strive to be natural in all you write, And paint with colours that may please the sight. Nature in various figures does abound, And in each mind are different humours found; A glance, a touch, discovers to the wise, But every man has not discerning eyes. All-changing time does also change the mind, And different ages different pleasures find; Youth, hot and furious, cannot brook delay, By flattering vice is easily led away; Vain in discourse, inconstant in desire, In censure, rash; in pleasures, all on fire. The manly age does steadier thoughts enjoy; Power and Ambition do his soul employ; Against the turns of fate he sets his mind; And by the past the future hopes to find. Decrepit age, still adding to his stores, For others heaps the treasure he adores; In all his actions keeps a frozen pace; Past times extols, the present to debase: Incapable of pleasures youth abuse, In others blames what age does him refuse. Your actors must by reason be controlled; Let young men speak like young, old men like old. Observe the town, and study well the court; For thither various characters resort. Thus 'twas great Jonson purchased his renown, And in his art had borne away the crown, If, less desirous of the people's praise, He had not with low farce debased his plays; Mixing dull buffoonery with wit refined, And Harlequin with noble Terence joined. When in the Fox I see the tortoise hist, I lose the author of the Alchemist. The comic wit, born with a smiling air, Must tragic grief and pompous verse forbear; Yet may he not, as on a market-place, With bawdy jests amuse the populace; With well-bred conversation you must please, And your intrigue unravelled be with ease; Your action still should reason's rules obey, Nor in an empty scene may lose its way. Your humble style must sometimes gently rise; And your discourse sententious be, and wise: The passions must to nature be confined; And scenes to scenes with artful weaving joined. Your wit must not unseasonably play; But follow business, never lead the way. Observe how Terence does this error shun: A careful father chides his amorous son; Then see that son, whom no advice can move, Forget those orders, and pursue his love: 'Tis not a well-drawn picture we discover; 'Tis a true son, a father, and a lover. I like an author that reforms the age, And keeps the right decorum of the stage; That always pleases by just reason's rule: But for a tedious droll, a quibbling fool, Who with low nauseous bawdry fills his plays, Let him be gone, and on two tressels raise Some Smithfield stage, where he may act his pranks, And make Jack-Puddings speak to mountebanks. CANTO IV. In Florence dwelt a doctor of renown, The scourge of God, and terror of the town, Who all the cant of physic had by heart, And never murdered but by rules of art. The public mischief was his private gain: Children their slaughtered parents sought in vain; A brother here his poisoned brother wept; Some bloodless died, and some by opium slept; Colds, at his presence, would to phrenzies turn, And agues, like malignant fevers, burn. Hated, at last, his practice gives him o'er; One friend, unkilled by drugs, of all his store, In his new country-house affords him place ('Twas a rich abbot, and a building ass). Here first the doctor's talent came in play; He seems inspired, and talks like Wren or May; Of this new portico condemns the face, And turns the entrance to a better place; Designs the staircase at the other end: His friend approves, does for his mason send. He comes; the doctor's arguments prevail; In short, to finish this our humorous tale, He Galen's dangerous science does reject, And from ill doctor turns good architect. In this example we may have our part; Rather be mason ('tis a useful art) Than a dull poet; for that trade accurst, Admits no mean betwixt the best and worst. In other sciences, without disgrace, A candidate may fill a second place; But poetry no medium can admit, No reader suffers an indifferent wit: The ruined stationers against him bawl, And Herringman degrades from his stall. Burlesque at least our laughter may excite; But a cold writer never can delight. The Counter-scuffle has more wit and art, Than the stiff formal style of Gondibert. Be not affected with that empty praise Which your vain flatterers will sometimes raise; And when you read, with ecstasy will say, “The finished piece! the admirable play!” Which, when exposed to censure and to light, Cannot endure a critic's piercing sight. A hundred authors' fates have been foretold, And Shadwell's works are printed, but not sold. Hear all the world; consider every thought; A fool by chance may stumble on a fault: Yet, when Apollo does your muse inspire, Be not impatient to expose your fire; Nor imitate the Settles of our times, Those tuneful readers of their own dull rhymes, Who seize on all the acquaintance they can meet, And stop the passengers that walk the street: There is no sanctuary you can chuse For a defence from their pursuing muse. I said before, be patient when they blame; To alter for the better is no shame. Yet yield not to a fool's impertinence; Sometimes conceited sceptics, void of sense, By their false taste condemn some finished part, And blame the noblest flights of wit and art. In vain their fond opinions you deride, With their loved follies they are satisfied; And their weak judgment, void of sense and light, Thinks nothing can escape their feeble sight: Their dangerous counsels do not cure, but wound; To shun the storm they run your verse aground, And thinking to escape a rock, are drowned. Chuse a sure judge to censure what you write, Whose reason leads, and knowledge gives you light, Whose steady hand will prove your faithful guide, And touch the darling follies you would hide: He, in your doubts, will carefully advise, And clear the mist before your feeble eyes. 'Tis he will tell you, to what noble height A generous Muse may sometimes take her flight; When too much fettered with the rules of art, May from her stricter bounds and limits part: But such a perfect judge is hard to see, And every rhymer knows not poetry; Nay some there are for writing verse extolled, Who know not Lucan's dross from Virgil's gold. Would you in this great art acquire renown? Authors, observe the rules I here lay down. In prudent lessons everywhere abound; With pleasant join the useful and the sound: A sober reader a vain tale will slight; He seeks as well instruction as delight. Let all your thoughts to virtue be confined, Still offering nobler figures to our mind: I like not those loose writers, who employ Their guilty muse, good manners to destroy; Who with false colours still deceive our eyes, And show us vice dressed in a fair disguise. Yet do I not their sullen muse approve, Who from all most writings banish love; That stript the playhouse of its chief intrigue, And make a murderer of Roderigue: The lightest love, if decently exprest, Will raise no vicious motions in our breast. Dido in vain may weep, and ask relief; I blame her folly, whilst I share her grief. A virtuous author, in his charming art, To please the sense needs not corrupt the heart: His heat will never cause a guilty fire: To follow virtue then be your desire. In vain your art and vigour are exprest; The obscene expression shows the infected breast. But, above all, base jealousies avoid, In which detracting poets are employed. A noble wit dares liberally commend, And scorns to grudge at his deserving friend. Base rivals, who true wit and merit hate, Caballing still against it with the great, Maliciously aspire to great renown, By standing up, and pulling others down. Never debase yourself by treacherous ways, Nor by such abject methods seek for praise: Let not your only business be to write; Be virtuous, just, and in your friends delight. 'Tis not enough your poems be admired; But strive your conversation be desired: Write for immortal fame; nor ever chuse Gold for the object of a generous muse. I know a noble wit may, without crime, Receive a lawful tribute for his time: Yet I abhor those writers, who despise Their honour, and alone their profits prize; Who their Apollo basely will degrade, And of a noble science make a trade. Before kind Reason did her light display, And government taught mortals to obey, Men, like wild beasts, did nature's laws pursue, They fed on herbs, and drink from waters drew; Their brutal force, on lust and rapine bent, Committed murder without punishment: Reason at last, by her all-conquering arts, Reduced these savages, and tuned their hearts; Mankind from bogs, and woods, and caverns calls, And towns and cities fortifies with walls: Thus fear of justice made proud rapine cease, And sheltered innocence by laws and peace. These benefits from poets we received; From whence are raised those fictions since believed, That Orpheus, by his soft harmonious strains, Tamed the fierce tigers of the Thracian plains; Amphion's notes, by their melodious powers, Drew rocks and woods, and raised the Theban towers: These miracles from numbers did arise; Since which, in verse Heaven taught his mysteries, And by a priest, possessed with rage divine, Apollo spoke from his prophetic shrine. Soon after, Homer the old heroes praised, And noble minds by great examples raised; Then Hesiod did his Grecian swains incline To till the fields, and prune the bounteous vine. Thus useful rules were, by the poet's aid, In easy numbers to rude men conveyed, And pleasingly their precepts did impart; First charmed the ear, and then engaged the heart; The Muses thus their reputation raised, And with just gratitude in Greece were praised. With pleasure mortals did their wonders see, And sacrificed to their divinity; But want, at last, base flattery entertained, And old Parnassus with this vice was stained; Desire of gain dazzling the poets' eyes, Their works were filled with fulsome flatteries. Thus needy wits a vile revenue made, And verse became a mercenary trade. Debase not with so mean a vice thy art; If gold must be the idol of thy heart, Fly, fly the unfruitful Heliconian strand! Those streams are not enriched with golden sand; Great wits, as well as warriors, only gain Laurels and honours for their toil and pain. But what? an author cannot live on fame, Or pay a reckoning with a lofty name: A poet, to whom fortune is unkind, Who when he goes to bed has hardly dined, Takes little pleasure in Parnassus' dreams, Or relishes the Heliconian streams; Horace had ease and plenty when he writ, And free from cares for money or for meat, Did not expect his dinner from his wit. 'Tis true; but verse is cherished by the great, And now none famish who deserve to eat: What can we fear, when virtue, arts, and sense, Receive the stars' propitious influence; When a sharp-sighted prince, by early grants, Rewards your merits, and prevents your wants? Sing then his glory, celebrate his fame; Your noblest theme is his immortal name. Let mighty Spenser raise his reverend head, Cowley and Denham start up from the dead; Waller his age renew, and offerings bring, Our monarch's praise let bright-eyed virgins sing: Let Dryden with new rules our stage refine, And his great models form by this design. But where's a second Virgil, to rehearse Our hero's glories in his epic verse? What Orpheus sing his triumph o'er the main, And make the hills and forests move again; Show his bold fleet on the Batavian shore, And Holland trembling as his cannons roar; Paint Europe's balance in his steady hand, Whilst the two worlds in expectation stand Of peace or war, that wait on his command? But, as I speak, new glories strike my eyes, Glories, which Heaven itself does give, and prize, Blessings of peace; that with their milder rays Adorn his reign, and bring Saturnian days. Now let rebellion, discord, vice, and rage, That have in patriots' forms debauched our age, Vanish with all the ministers of hell; His rays their poisonous vapours shall dispel: 'Tis he alone our safety did create, His own firm soul secured the nation's fate, Opposed to all the boutefeus of the state. Authors, for him your great endeavours raise; The loftiest numbers will but reach his praise. For me, whose verse in satire has been bred, And never durst heroic measures tread; Yet you shall see me, in that famous field, With eyes and voice, my best assitance yield; Offer you lessons, that my infant muse Learnt, when she Horace for her guide did chuse; Second your zeal with wishes, heart, and eyes, And afar off hold up the glorious prize. But pardon too, if, zealous for the right, A strict observer of each noble flight, From the fine gold I separate the allay, And show how hasty writers sometimes stray; Apter to blame, than knowing how to mend; A sharp, but yet a necessary friend. ON THE YOUNG STATESMEN. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Clarendon had law and sense, Clifford was fierce and brave; Bennet's grave look was a pretence, And Danby's matchless impudence Helped to support the knave. But Sunderland, Godolphin, Lory, These will appear such chits in story, 'Twill turn all politics to jests, To be repeated like John Dory, When fiddlers sing at feasts. Protect us, mighty Providence! What would these madmen have? First, they would bribe us without pence, Deceive us without common sense, And without power enslave. Shall free-born men, in humble awe, Submit to servile shame, Who from consent and custom draw The same right to be ruled by law, Which kings pretend, to reign? The Duke shall wield his conquering sword, The Chancellor make a speech, The King shall pledge his honest word, The pawned revenue sums afford, And then, come kiss my breech. So have I seen a king in chess (His rooks and knights withdrawn, His queen and bishops in distress), Shifting about grow less and less, With here and there a pawn. TARQUIN AND TULLIA. The attribution of this poem is questionable. In times when princes cancelled nature's law, And declarations which themselves did draw; When children used their parents to dethrone, And gnaw their way, like vipers, to the crown; Tarquin, a savage, proud, ambitious prince, Prompt to expel, yet thoughtless of defence, The envied sceptre did from Tullius snatch, The Roman king, and father by the match. To form his party, histories report, A sanctuary was opened in his court, Where glad offenders safely might resort. Great was the crowd, and wonderous the success, For those were fruitful times of wickedness; And all that lived obnoxious to the laws, Flocked to prince Tarquin, and embraced his cause. 'Mongst these a pagan priest for refuge fled; A prophet deep in godly faction read; A sycophant, that knew the modish way To cant and plot, to flatter and betray, To whine and sin, to scribble and recant, A shameless author, and a lustful saint. To serve all times he could distinctions coin And with great ease flat contradictions join A traitor now, once loyal in extreme, And then obedience was his only theme: He sung in temples the most passive lays And wearied monarchs with repeated praise But managed awkwardly that lawful part, To vent foul lies and treason was his art, And pointed libels at crowned heads to dart. This priest, and others, learned to defame, First murder injured Tullius in his name; With blackest calumnies their sovereign load, A poisoned brother, and dark league abroad; A son unjustly top'd upon the throne, Which yet was proved undoubtedly his own; Though, as the law was then, 'twas his behoof, Who dispossessed the heir, to bring the proof. This hellish charge they backed with dismal frights, The loss of property, and sacred rights, And freedom; words which all false patriots use As surest names the Romans to abuse; Jealous of kings, and always malcontent, Forward in change, yet certain to repent. Whilst thus the plotters needful fears create, Tarquin with open force invades the state. Lewd nobles join him with their feeble might, And atheist fools for dear religion fight. The priests their boasted principles disown, And level their harangues against the throne. Vain promises the people's minds allure: Slight were these ills, but desperate the cure. 'Tis hard for kings to steer an equal course, And they who banish one oft gain a worse. Those heavenly bodies we admire above, Do every day irregularly move; Yet Tullius, 'tis decreed, must lose the crown, For faults that were his council's, not his own. He now in vain commands even those he payed, By darling troops deserted and betrayed, By creatures which his generous warmth had made. Of these a captain of the guards was worst, Whose memory to this day stands accurst. This rogue, advanced to military trust By his own whoredom, and his sister's lust, Forsook his master, after dreadful vows, And plotted to betray him to his foes; The kindest master to the vilest slave, As free to give, as he was sure to crave. His haughty female, who, as books declare, Did always toss wide nostrils in the air, Was to the younger Tullia governess, And did attend her, when, in borrowed dress, She fled by night from Tullius in distress. This wretch, by letters, did invite his foes, And used all arts her father to depose; A father, always generously bent, So kind, that even her wishes he'd prevent. 'Twas now high time for Tullius to retreat, When even his daughter hastened his defeat; When faith and duty vanished, and no more The name of father and of king he bore: A king, whose right his foes could ne'er dispute; So mild, that mercy was his attribute; Affable, kind, and easy of access; Swift to relieve, unwilling to oppress; Rich without taxes, yet in payment just; So honest, that he hardly could distrust: His active soul from labours ne'er did cease, Valiant in war, and vigilant in peace; Studious with traffic to enrich the land, Strong to protect, and skilful to command; Liberal and splendid, yet without excess; Prone to relieve, unwilling to distress: In sum, how godlike must his nature be, Whose only fault was too much piety! This king removed, the assembled states thought fit, That Tarquin in the vacant throne should sit; Voted him regent in their senate-house, And with an empty name endowed his spouse. The elder Tullia, who, some authors feign, Drove o'er her father's corse a rumbling wain: But she, more guilty, numerous wains did drive, To crush her father and her king alive; And in remembrance of his hastened fall, Resolved to institute a weekly ball. The jolly glutton grew in bulk and chin, Feasted on rapine, and enjoyed her sin; With luxury she did weak reason force, Debauched good-nature, and cram'd down remorse; Yet when she drank cold tea in liberal sups, The sobbing dame was maudling in her cups. But brutal Tarquin never did relent, Too hard to melt, too wicked to repent; Cruel in deeds, more merciless in will, And blest with natural delight in ill. From a wise guardian he received his doom To walk the change, and not to govern Rome. He swore his native honours to disown, And did by perjury ascend the throne. Oh! had that oath his swelling pride represt, Rome had been then with peace and plenty blest. But Tarquin, guided by destructive fate, The country wasted, and embroiled the state, Transported to their foes the Roman pelf, And by their ruin hoped to save himself. Innumerable woes oppress the land, When it submitted to his curs'd command. So just was Heaven, that 'twas hard to tell, Whether its guilt or losses did excel. Men that renounced their God for dearer trade, Were then the guardians of religion made. Rebels were sainted, foreigners did reign, Outlaws returned, preferment to obtain, With frogs, and toads, and all their croaking train. No native knew their features nor their birth; They seemed the greasy offspring of the earth. The trade was sunk, the fleet and army spent; Devouring taxes swallowed lesser rent; Taxes imposed by no authority; Each lewd collection was a robbery. Bold self-creating men did statutes draw, Skilled to establish villainy by law; Fanatic drivers, whose unjust careers. Produced new ills exceeding former fears: Yet authors here except a faithful band, Which the prevailing faction did withstand; And some, who bravely stood in the defence Of baffled justice, and their exiled prince. These shine to after-times; each sacred name Stands still recorded in the rolls of fame. SUUM CUIQUE. The attribution of this poem is questionable. When lawless men their neighbours dispossess, The tenants they extirpate or oppress, And make rude havoc in the fruitful soil, Which the right owners ploughed with careful toil. The same proportion does in kingdoms hold; A new prince breaks the fences of the old, And will o'er carcases and deserts reign, Unless the land its rightful lord regain. He gripes the faithless owners of the place, And buys a foreign army to deface The feared and hated remnant of their race; He starves their forces, and obstructs their trade; Vast sums are given, and yet no native paid. The church itself he labours to assail, And keeps fit tools to break the sacred pale. Of those let him the guilty roll commence, Who has betrayed a master and a prince; A man, seditious, lewd, and impudent; An engine always mischievously bent; One who from all the bans of duty swerves, No tie can hold but that which he deserves; An author dwindled to a pamphleteer; Skilful to forge, and always insincere; Careless exploded practices to mend; Bold to attack, yet feeble to defend. Fate's blindfold reign the atheist loudly owns, And providence blasphemously dethrones. In vain the leering actor strains his tongue To cheat, with tears and empty noise, the throng; Since all men know, whate'er he says or writes, Revenge, or stronger interest, indites; And that the wretch employs his venal wit How to confute what formerly he writ. Next him the grave Socinian claims a place, Endowed with reason, though bereft of grace; A preaching pagan of surpassing fame, No register records his borrowed name. O, had the child more happily been bred, A radiant mitre would have graced his head: But now unfit, the most he should expect, Is to be entered of T? F?'s sect. To him succeeds, with looks demurely sad, A gloomy soul, with revelation mad; False to his friend, and careless of his word; A dreaming prophet, and a gripping lord; He sells the livings which he can't possess, And forms that sinecure, his diocese. Unthinking man! to quit thy barren see And vain endeavours in chronology, For the more fruitless care of royal charity. Thy hoary noddle warns thee to return, The treason of old age in Wales to mourn; Nor think the city-poor may less sustain, Thy place may well be vacant in this reign. I should admit the booted prelate now, But he is even for lampoon too low; The scum and outcast of a royal race, The nation's grievance, and the gown's disgrace. None so unlearned did e'er at London sit; This driveller does the sacred chair besh?t. I need not brand the spiritual parricide, Nor draw the weapon dangling by his side; The astonished world remembers that offence, And knows he stole the daughter of his prince. 'Tis time enough, in some succeeding age, To bring this mitred captain on the stage. These are the leaders in apostasy, And the blind guides of poor elective majesty; A thing which commonwealths-men did devise, Till plots were ripe, to catch the people's eyes. Their king's a monster, in a quagmire born, Of all the native brutes the grief and scorn; With a big snout, cast in a crooked mould, Which runs with glanders and an inborn cold; His substance is of clammy snot and phlegm; Sleep is his essence, and his life a dream. To Caprea this Tiberius does retire, To quench with catamite his feeble fire. Dear catamite! who rules alone the state, While monarch dozes on his unpropt height, Silent, yet thoughtless, and secure of fate. Could you but see the fulsome hero led By loathing vassals to his noble bed! In flannel robes the coughing ghost does walk, And his mouth moats like cleaner breech of hawk; Corruption, springing from his cankered breast, Furs up the channel, and disturbs his rest. With head propt up, the bolstered engine lies; If pillow slip aside, the monarch dies.</field>
