      <field name="fulltext">A Dreame. Morpheus (thou Turn-key to all humane sense) Unlock my braine, that I may flie from hence, Out of this Cage of sleep, let me not lie And drowne my senses in stupidity. My thoughts surprise my thoughts, I cannot rest, I have a Civill Warre within my brest; I'me full of thoughts: what uncontroled streams Flow from the fancies Ocean? Oh! what dreams Have sail'd into my story mind? And bring No other burthen with them but a King, A King! could I but kisse that word, and not be thought An Idolizer; 'tis too great a fault To kisse his hand. Nor can I think it strange. For times, &amp; m?ners, needs must have their change. Tis true, I dream'd methoughts my watchful eyes Observ'd a King, and than a sacrifice; And ravish'd with that majesty and grace I saw united in his modest face. I ran to kisse his hand, but with a fall I wak'd, and lost both King, and kisse, and all. And thus restored to my former sense, I thus proceeded in my thoughts; from whence Arise these fancies, what? did fancy meane To cause a sudden fall to intervene Between a kisse and me? 'twas an abuse That runs beyond the limits of excuse. I was enrag'd to think that I should misse (Being so near his hand) so sweet a kisse. I check'd my fancy; which was too precise To make me run so fast, yet lose the prize. Thoughts, follow thoughts, and when the first is spent A second rises, which does oft prevent An inconvenient action, many time A second thought gaines virtue by a crime. The first being banish'd, reason thought it good To place a second, where the first thought stood, And then I found my active fancy play'd The Politician, and that thought allay'd The former flames of passion in my brest, Then was I pleas'd w?? what mythoughts exprest, Which was to this effect? ?Methoughts I saw A grieved King, whose very looks were Law. He sigh'd as if his tender heart had taken A farewell of his body, and forsaken This lower world, his star-like eyes were fixt Upon the face of Heav'n, his hands conmixt. His tongue was parsimonious, yet my eare (That was attentive) could not prevaile to heare This whisp'ring eccho: Oh be pleas'd t'incline Thy sacred eares! was ever grief life mine? Was ever heart so sad? was ever any So destitute of joy, that had so many As I have had? though all be snacth'd from me, Yet let me have an interest in thee. Oh Heaven! and there he stop'd, as if his breath Had stept aside to entertaine a death. My soul was ravish'd, and the private dart Of new-bred love, struck pity to my heart, I could not hold, but silently bequeath Some drops unto the ground, my soule did cleave Unto his lips, for every word he spoke Was ponderous, and would have easily broke Th'obdurest heart; I turn'd away my eye, And suddenly methoughts I did espie A sacrifice; which when I did behold, My bloud recoiled, and my heart grew cold: I was transported, and methoughts the place Whereon I stood, seem'd bloudy for a space: I trembling, cast my wearied eyes about, Thinking to finde my former object out, But he was gone; and in his roome was plac'd A many-headed monster, that disgrac'd The very place: they vanish'd, then appear'd A large-pretending rout, as well be-ear'd As Balam's Asse, methoughts they did excell The Asse in eares, but could not speak so well. Methoughts they call'd a Counsell to contrive Their high designes, and zealously dislive Some great Offenders that they thought too wise To live amongst such eares, such cast-up eyes. “One I observ'd amongst the studious race “That had (methoughts) a bone-fire in his face: “Another I discry'd amongst the pack “That seem'd to bear a Kingdome on his back: “Another I beheld which pleas'd me best, “That could not rule himself, yet rul'd the rest: “Another I espy'd which seem'd to look “And read, but at the wrong end of his book: “Another I observ'd, which seem'd to weep, “And in conclusion, pray'd himself a sleep: “Another I discry'd, among these Brothers, “That vow'd 'twas right, because he'd please the others: “Another he stood up, and wisely broke “His long-kept silent lips, and thus bespoke. Come! let's no longer now be kept in awe, I'me sure our welfare is the Supreme Law; A King, that's nothing but a power that is Subordinate; the Lawes are ours, not His; Is't not the People makes a King? well, then If we let him be King, we're fools, not Men: For now we have him in his own-made snare, We'l keep him fast, oh that we had His haire! Come, let's proceed, and if our plots hit right You shall be Lords at least, and I, a Knight. And let Malignants prate, their Purses shall Pay tribute for their tongues at Gold-smiths-hall: And if they grumble at what we shall doe, We'l make them pay their lives and money too; The day is ours, let's not abuse that powre Which Heav'n hath lent us; for sweet things prove sowre If not made use of, have we not been poore And others rich? Come, let's increase our store: Had we but our deserts, might we not crave The priviledge of all that others have? All's ours, and yet our miseries are such That we are rich in little, poor in much; Alas! our tender hearts are fill'd with pity To see so many blind in one poor City; If they would please in a true zealous fashion To moderate their long-continued passion, 'Twould much rejoice the Saints, &amp; we will pray That they may live untill a wiser day; The'are very pious People, and we could Both live, and die together, if they would But furnish our desires with every thing We want, and dote not too much on a King; He's but a man at most, and yet they must Adore His Person, though He be unjust. I could not chuse but laugh the other day, I 'spy'd a Cavalier that closely lay Perdue to kisse his hand, and by and by He starts away, and when he was as nigh (That which they call a King) as his own length His legs (not having that sufficient strength His hast requir'd) receiv'd a sudden fall And overturn'd himselfe, his King, and all: The sight much pleas'd me, being very near, I never help'd the King, nor a Cavalier: I soone retreated from that happy place, And left them both in a distracted case; But as I went, I was so blest to meet An upright Sister, whose dividing feet Stept with such innocency; that my heart Did almost leap upon her to impart My new-bred joy; her very looks betray'd Her heart, indeed she was a lovely Maid; I bow'd my self, and zealously imbrac'd The small circumf'rence of her bending waste, I kiss'd her mouth, and having done that duty, My lips divided, and I prais'd her beauty; Extreams of joy did almost make me faint: I thought, oh! here's a Sister for a Saint: I was amaz'd; my very soule did move Between the great extreams of feare, and love; She smil'd upon me, and that very smile Prov'd a Restorative, and for a while I mus'd; at last my lips began to break As that smile had licenced them to speak; Oh! then my mouth being ram'd with words, let flie Both wit, and language, and did soare as nigh As our Remonstrance, oh! how I did heat Her eares with my discourse, it was so neat As if my ready mouth had been the Schoole Of language, yet she pleas'd to call me Foole; But 'twas in jest I'm sure, or were it not 'Tis nothing, since my goodnesse has forgot My Sisters weaknesse, and indeed we men Must bear with Sisters failings, now, and then; They often trip in zeal, and sometimes take A fall, and love it for the Giver's sake: Our greatest faults they'l pardon for a buss, Come, we must bear with them, they bear with us; But after she had call'd me fool, she checkt Her self; I wisely own'd it with neglect, I spread my cloake upon the ground, and there We cool'd our passions in the open aire: Sister, said I, you have been pleas'd to spend The name of Foole upon your faithfull friend, It was my worth you rashly did eclips, And I'le have satisfaction from those lips That gave th'affront, let me no longer stay, My fury will admit of no delay. Dear Brother, she reply'd, if it be so You must have satisfaction, tak't below; You soare too high at first, I must detest Your lofty play, the middle way is best; But if you are resolv'd, you shall not say I'm obstinate; for if you will, you may: I soone return'd her thanks, and with my hand I pull'd her close, and made her understand What I had seen: but oh how she was pleas'd! Ah verily (said she) the news has eas'd My longing heart. But when the King fell downe Thou wert unwise thou hadst not snatch'd His Crowne. 'Tis rarely spoken Sister, had I had The Crown, I should have made a gallant Lad; Should I but sway the Scepter of this Land, I'd make my Subjects die at my command; I'd lop the great ones off, and make the low Subordinate to me, I'd make them know The reines were mine; but at the first I'de steale Into their hearts, and fool them with my zeal. I would declare unto the world, and take An Oath, I acted for Religions sake: I'd fill them full of novelties, and then Sister thou knowst the common sort of Men (Like flies) will buz about my new-made light; I'd call them Babes of grace, and make them fight With Cerberus himself in my defence, My Soule now tells me, 'tis a rare pretence: I'd hire some baubling Preachers to infuse Division; and to flatter them with newes. I'd plump their soules with promises, that they Should never faile to swear, what should I say; I'd make my Preachers urge them all to joyne And fight for God; then will their Plate be mine: This is an art that lies above the reach Of every braine: I'd suffer all to Preach And sow sedition, every one should be At least a Saint and preach upon a Tree: And if my great occasions should require Large summes of money, then would I inspire A Publique faith; and if it would not rise That way, I'd make the bellows of Excise To puffe it up; this is a cleanly way To sweep up money, Souldiers must have pay. Sister, thou know'st 'tis no disgracing stealth To make Religion rob the Common-wealth: What though Malignants raile at our designes, We can extract our livings from their fines: I've spoke enough, now Sister I'le divorce My nimble tongue from this profound discourse: Now give me leave to dedicate my heart To thee (my Patronesse) before I part. Brother, alas! I am a harmlesse maid, And we you know are easily betrai'd By mens delusion: If your love be true, The zeal of my affections light on you; You know we ought to love, and none can be More honest in their harmlesse loves than we, For we may love each other in the spirit, And pray, and preach together, and inherit Our owne desires, whilst others send their cries To their beloveds, and yet loose the prize. Sister, thou hast exactly satisfy'd My large desires: may happinesse bety'd The thriving spirit, truly 'tis a paine To part, but that I hope to meet againe: London, (that nest of worth) that yeilding place, I am resolv'd to view, within the space Of forty howres, where I intend to spare Some time, and see some Brethren I have there, It is a goodly place, as fame relates, For there the Sisters live, and all the States; Truly, th'are very godly, and pretend Just like our selves, to be a faithfull friend To King, and Monarchie, when as Alas— And then I wak'd, and let the other passe Unutter'd, but indeed I doe confesse I wish that I had heard a great deale lesse, And yet (to speak the truth) I was perplext Because I could not hear what followed next. This was a midnights dreame, I was in paine Till night had lull'd me in her armes againe, And for the space of half a tedious howre I was disturb'd, till sleep had gain'd some power Over my slumb'ring senses, but at last Call'd to the bar of sleep, I there was cast: I had not long in peacefull pleasure slumber'd, Before an interposing dreame incumber'd My quiet fancy, suddenly my eare Was fill'd with such a noise, as none could heare Without much fear, as if th'incurved back Of burth'ned Atlas had begun to crack. Methoughts I saw the Heav'ns how they begun (As if th'ad scorn'd the glory of the Sun) To frowne upon the earth, which seem'd to flame Like sulpherous Etna from whose bowels came Whole Regiments of Spirits which disturb'd The aire, whose fury hated to be curb'd; Methoughts they were ambitious to expell Some Potentate, and make his seat, their Hell: Methoughts at last (I slumb'ring) seem'd to heare A single voice that whisper'd in my eare, Yet thund'red in my heart, which made me grone At every word; exprest in such a tone Which would with great facility have turn'd A Tyrants heart, or else consum'd and burn'd His breast to ashes, and if language could Move pity in a flinty-soule, this would, He bolted forth his griefs, like claps of thunder, As if each word should cleave a heart in sunder; His voice being guarded with a pleasing force, I sacrific'd my eares to his discourse; Methoughts my soule, my very eares were blest In giving audience, whilst he thus exprest. Oh Heaven! oh Earth! how can they chuse but frown To see them make a foot-ball of a Crown? How long shall I be made an aym'd at mark Of pointed envie? shall they make me dark That I made light? and shall that light devoure The former principle? Unhappy howre When my abused willingnesse was made A Stalk-horse unto those, who have bet'rayd An Island unto tyranny; whose Lawes Oppresse true Subjects, and make me the Cause: Malitious age, and will their fury have My end, untill it send me to my grave? A grave most peacefull Place, for I'm sure There's no Rebellion; there I'le rest secure Where neither grief, nor care, shall date torment My sublime soule, there, there lies true content. There there's the death of sorrow, and the life Of Peace, and there's a period to all strife. There's none can mock my woes, there's none can trie A King, nor make a Garrison, but I. And what I spake, my soule protests is true, I am no slave to death, but unto you My soul's my Gods, and Tyrants doe your worst. Job's soul was free, when's body was accurst. But you bloud-thirsty Zelots, learn to know You never can rise high, if I fall low. I fear no threats, let torments all conjoyne Themselves, at last ye'l find them yours, not mine. What though I suffer here, my sufferings shall Advance my soul; May they not make you fall? Let out my life, goe make a streaming floud, And bath your selves in my diffused bloud. Let loose your furies, give your passions breath; And let them biat my body unto death. I am resolv'd, my heart shall flie above The reach of fear, and view the God of love; Consider well, what glory can accrew From my destruction, to such soules as you; Be not too rash, but know a cause that's dy'd In guiltlesse bloud cannot be justify'd, A prosperous vice shall never claime a right To perpetuity, 'twill but in-right A totall ruine, 'tis a greater Fame To die with virtue, than to live with shame: You seek for truth, and yet you goe the way To make the field of truth a Golgatha; There is a great antipathy between Faction, and Feate, and yet my eyes have seen How you (whose restlesse spirits, still increase With Faction) seem to study for a Peace; Doe not mistake, for they that will compose A difference, must never doe't by blowes. The worst of Apprehensions may descrie You nourish Spiders, and destroy the Flie. Who glories in a crime, will in conclusion Receive a curse, and with that curse confusion: I long to be resolv'd, pray tell me why Ye thinke ye cannot live, except I die? Your thoughts are vain, 'twill be a tainted breath That has it's derivation from my death. Am I a Basiliske? and can my eyes Devoure you? for you know my body lies Subject to be destroy'd, not to destroy (By taking up of Arms) your Kingly joy: But you suppose, If I should long survive, I would become laborious, and contrive Some new designes, &amp; with my numerous forces Divert the streame of your unlawfull courses; Make reason your Companions, walke a while, Consult together, stride not o're the stile When as the gap lies open, they're unwise That will (when they foresee a harme) despise Preventing means; for if you take this life From my enjoyment, ye'l beget a strife That will not end, and when that strife is bred Then will my wrongs survive, though I am dead, And you that caus'd my guiltlesse heart to bleed Will find another to revenge the deed; Aske Heaven's forgivenesse, for ye cannot crave Leave to abscond your crimes within my Grave: Be well assur'd, that ev'ry drop which parts Out of my veins, shall cleave unto your hearts Like tangling bird-lime which will hold you fast, And vengance too, shall find you out at last, Heav'ns all-surveying eye must needs observe Your late unpolish'd actions, which deserve As many torments as th'inraged hand Of veng'ance can impose, or Heav'n command: Did I not labour with a serious brest During the Treaty, to restore some rest To this distemper'd Kingdome; but the gales Of Malice, wore oppugnant to my sailes; My heart was loaded with the large encrease Of hopeful thoughts, my soul was fill'd with peace But at the last my hopes prov'd uselesse drosse, And then I lost a Crowne, and found a Crosse; Heav'n heare my wish, oh grant I may c?mence A Doctor, in the art of Patience! It matters not how poor my Person be, If at the last I may be crown'd with thee, Thou knowst the secret corners of my heart Which is at thy disposing, for thou art The King of Kings, and unto thee i'le pay The tribute of my soul, both night, and day. I am thy Subject, give me grace to stand Firmly obedient to thy just command. When for my sins I shall receive thy blowes, Oh give me power to suffer, not oppose! Pardon my Enemies which have been strong, And alwayes studious how to doe me wrong: And though they'ave vented that which is untrue, Father forgive, they know not what they doe. They hate their King, &amp; are not pleasd with any, O grant, good God, they may not find too many The chiefest of their worke, is to devoure; (Stones have usurpt their hearts, as they my powre!) Against the sound of Peace, their eares are bar'd Oh never sure, was Pharaohs heart so hard. They disrespect their King; it was not so With Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; Their tongues have vilifi'd me oftentimes, These three were never guilty of such Crimes; Their hearts had vow'd obedience to their King, And never try'd by force of Armes to bring Their own Designes to passe; but their submission Sent comfort to their souls, and much contrition To him, whose more then seven times heated brest Did soon regrest what his hot rage exprest. But well, since thus it is, I'le strive to sway The Scepter of my miseries, and lay A good foundation, that my Foes may build Their torments on my breast, which shall be fill'd With true content, I'le labour to support, (But yet must yeeld, when death shal storm the fort) I cannot start at death, I know it brings A finis to my ancient griefs, and sings Anthems of Peace: how happy's he that can Flie to his God, and scorne the rage of Man: Thunder ye Sons of tyranny, let rage Flash from your sulph'rous souls, strive to ingage The flames of Etna too, and let them dash Against my breasts I'le owne them as a flash; Flatter your souls, prepare your hands to do A deed, that Heav'n will not advise you to. I pitty you, my heart cannot forbeare To sigh; and Nature too, commands a teare; Oh that my head (like to a Fountaine) could Furnish my eyes with teares, oh then I would Begin the morning, and conclude the day With Dropps, and wash the black-brow'd night away; Oh let my language whet your dull belief, 'Twas you that fill'd my flowing heart with grief, And now my Torments more and more excell, Heav'n grant me breath enough to bid Farewell. Farewell; sad word, that like a bolt of thunder Hath more then cleft my reaving heart in sunder. Death's nothing like the sorrow which I finde Rasing a towre of woe within my minde. Thou partner of my soul, how can I die And leave thee here to weep a Lullaby To my indulgent babes, how can it be That I must leave so dear a spouse as thee. Poor hearts, If I must goe and leave you all Confus'd together in the common hall Of this inraged world, what will ye doe But mourne for me, as I have mourn'd for you? Oh where will you retire your selves, and spend Your groaning houres, oh what regarding friend Will give a minnits audience, or relieve Your pining wants, or moan to hear you grieve? What Nation will regard, or entertaine (A royall) though a miserable traine; This is a sorrow that divides my breast; This is a grief that cannot be exprest Without a fractur'd heart, this is a wound That makes confusion active to confound. Were it a possibility to have Ten thousand Lyons lodg'd within this Cave, (This trunke of mine) they could not more torment My heart, then this unbounded discontent; Should all the Tyrants in the world contrive A way to make a dying soul survive With living paine, they never could exceed The Tyrants of these Times in such a deed; I have been long imprison'd; and at last Call'd to the barr; how soon I may be cast Heav'n knows, not I, for they that were so bold To bring me thither, will, if not controul'd, Force me to death, their very looks declare Their resolutions, whilst their hearts prepare To suck my veins; Ah thus they have betray'd me, And smile to see how glorious they have made me They swell'd like mountain:, and at last brough forth The Mouse of Reformation, whose worth Is seated in all lofty braines, and hurl'd Through every corner of th'inquiring World. But why should I insist upon your Crimes. May heav'n forgive you, and send better times: I know my dayes are short, 'tis therefore meet To leave this crowne, and buy a winding-sheet, Be gon terrestiall pleasures, for ye are But Goalers to your Keepers, and insnare Your fond beleevers, goe, my heart's no tombe To give you buriall, seek some other roome; Fly then my soul; but stay, what hand is this That seems to hold me from my long'd for blisse; More sorrows yet; will not th'almighty please 'T afford my soul on earth a minnits ease, Oh thou that mak'st my harvest full of paines, Grant that my working soul may reap the gaines; Grief's grown a Pollitition, and it keeps A strong reserve; what eye is this that weeps These briny tears into my fluent heart, As if those floods should drownd me e're I part; What voice is this I seem to heare? what tones Are these that lavish out themselves in groanes? What ayles my thoughts? what neer related breath Is this that seems to breath a sudden death Into my panting breast? methinks I heare A female voice, cry, must I languish here? Hard-hearted death, why art thou thus unkinde To take him hence and leave me here behinde To weep his obsequies, draw up thy boe, And send me whether I desire to goe. Shoot, shoot, oh Death, thou shalt not be withstood, Come dip thy arrows in my crimson blood, Feare not, let fly, and let thy rovers hide Their twi-fork'd heads within my wounded side: Oh Heav'n, since thou wert pleas'd to joyn our hands And hearts together, let thy strict c?mands Urge death to strike us both, that we may fly, And dedicate our souls t'eternity; Alasse, what joy, what comfort can acrew To me, when he shall bid this world adue. I liv'd within his heart, but ah, if he Shall quit this earth, what life remaines in me. Alasse sad heart, what canst thou doe but pine; Never could grief be parralel'd with mine; I am the sea of grief, all streames doe tend Towards me, for ah my sorrows know no end; The sturdy winds of care, and trouble blowes Into my soul, my Ocean alwayes flowes And never ebbes; oh miserable age; How am I made a subject to their rage Whose pare-boyl'd souls observe no other dyet But blood; and seem to rest, in our disquiet; You all-exceeding Tyrants, if ye thirst For royall blood, be pleas'd to take mine first, Mines but a draught, yee'le quickly swill it up, Alas, it will not yeeld each soul a supp; You are the fountains from whose brests do spring The streames of murder, and your souls can sing Nothing but bloody notes; you can contract The body of all mischief, and enact What pleases you; But will you subjugate Your legall King, whose patience is your hate; But if you seek his fatall overthrow, Ye'le murder more then thousands at one blow; But why doe I thus lavish breath in vain, On those whose fury have no ears; refraine My trembling tongue; Tyrants; Ile leave you here, And turn my thoughts to Charls, whose lif's as dear To me, as death is cheap to you; Alasse, My heart is full, I cannot let thee passe Without a sigh, nor can my eyes forbeare To wash thy sad remembrance with a teare; Has Heav'n decreed it? must we be devided Deare King; and must our sorrows be derided; Thou great Recorder of my thoughts, to thee I will resigne; command, and I will be A subject to thy will; Oh let me have Thy gracious pardon, then a speedy grave, For ah what comfort can my wasting breast Hope to receive, when I am dispossest Of such a Ioy, alas where shall I seate My heart; teares are my drink, and sighes my meate, These palled lippes of mine shall never dare To owne a smile; I'le live with grief and care, Except my God will please to take me hence, And make his glorious Kingdome my defence; Was it not grief enough to be absented Five yeers from him, whose absence was lamented With reall dropps, yet then I could obtaine Some hopes to see him in his throne againe. But harke! methinks my Fancy seems to heare An aire of comfort breathing in my eare, It is the voice of Charles, whose pleasing breath Seems to advance me from the shades of death, Methinkes I heare his language, which distills Out from the Limbicke of his soul, and fills My pining heart with a triumphing joy His voice revives me, but his words destroy, He thus proceeds;—oh thou that are the vine Which twists about this twining heart of mine, Approach my presence, and I will declare How great my suffrings, and my comforts are: First I was tost, and banded too, and froe From place, to place, permitted not to goe Without a guard, a guard that did pretend Rather to act a murder, then defend: Then was I hurred to that fatall place Of London, where I know I must uncase My willing soul, which shall rejoyce, when they That are my Iudges shall presume to lay Their accusations on me, and declare My new-coyn'd faults, with their pretended care. And to advance their plotts, they first infirr I am a Tyrant, and a Murderer, Nay, and a Traytor too; If so it be That I'm a Tyrant, where's my Tyranny? Or if a Murderer; I here require To know whose blood it was that quench'd my fire. Suppose (but Heav'n forbid) it should be true, It was against my God I sinn'd, not you. Oh what an age is this, where seeming Reason Pretends to make me, Traytor, without Treason: Death; come, and welcome, to my heart, I know That my Redeemer lives, and that I owe A debt to Nature, which cannot be pay'd Till these condemned corps of mine are lay'd; Now grief be gon, and let my comforts take Possession of my soul, awake, awake My slumbring senses, I'le tryumph and sing, For I have found, that Death hath lost her sting; My soul informes me, that I must lay downe This Mortall for a true immortall Crowne, I'm ravish'd with delight, methinks I have A Heav'n within my bosome, to inslave The Hell of torments; grief must stand aloof, Not daring to approach within my roof; The pleasures of this world doe seem to run, And fly (like mists) before the morning Sun, They're all but transetory; and can lay No claime to perpetuity, to day They seem like messengers of Joy; to morrow They prove sad Heraulds, &amp; proclaime a sorrow. As for the Joyes of heav'n, they farre surmount My souls arethmatick, I cannot count Those numerous delights, which alwayes be Attendants to the souls eternitie: Thou great Redeemer, to whose sacred powre I now addresse my self, my long'd for houre Is almost come, ther's but a little blase Remains behinde, and yet methinks my dayes Seem tedious to my soul; I long to throw This burden downe, that presses me below, But since thy pleasure must be done, not mine Call when thou pleasest; for my soul is thine; I'le not resist thy hand; but kisse thy rod, I am thy Creature, thou my gracious God: Come my indulgent Ioyes, and let my breath Inhabbit in your eares before my death, Thou Consort of my heart, why dost thou waste Those pearly dropps, why do they make such hast To leave the sweet possessions of thy eyes, What? wi't thou make a watry Sacrifice; Oh doe not weep, Heav'n is not pleas'd to see Those gliding streames, which trickle down for me; My tender Babes, oh why doe you stand by And imitate your Mothers stormy eye, Restraine those tears; for every drop you shed Falls on my moyst'ned heart, and there hath bred A brim-fill'd fountaine, which at last will dround My heart, and give your selves the greatest wound. Let not, oh let not, your sad eyes exprssse So great a sorrow, for my happinesse; Cheer up; cheer up deare souls, &amp; learne to keep Those tears, or weep, to see your Mother weep, Weep not for me, I'm going to receive A lasting Crowne, oh leave (for heav'ns sake) leave Those heart-infringing groans, why doe ye vex My Heav'n-desiring soul, and thus perplex Your pensive hearts, forbeare, and be appeasd, Be not displeased, with what Heav'n is pleas'd; Oh how can ye expect that hee'l fulfill Your large desires, if thus you thwart his will; Come smile upon me, and that smile will give My heart a great incouragement to live, Death's but a speedy passage from this life, Unto a better, and concludes all strife Between this World and us, whilst here we draw Corrupted aire we're subject to the law Of grief and care, which daily circumvents Discordious hearts with griping discontents. Be not dejected at my death, but rather Rejoyce, to think that heav'n will be your father, Comfort your woefull mother, that hath been A carefull Parent, and my loyall Queen; Give her that full Obedience which is due, And Heav'n will be affectionate to you. Oh let the feare of God be alwaes plac'd Before your eyes; Let virtue be imbrac'd; What ere ye doe, be carefull to reserve A spotlesse minde, which will at last preserve Your heav'n-bred souls, let not your furies rage Into revenge, but labour to asswage The flames of anger, let them not aspire Beyond your reach; Passion's the worst of fire: Be not too much addicted to the hate Of any, but be wisely moderate, And when your hands begin to undertake A consequentiall worke, be sure t'awake Your slumb'ring reasons, labour to advise With hea'n, and he will crowne your enterprise With full successe; and if your foes should chance To gaine the day, permit your thoughts to glance Upon your private Crimes, and learne to know Th'effect can never absolutely show The justnesse of a cause, for oftentimes Just Heav'n is pleas'd to punishing private Crimes With publique means; God knows my cause was iust; An yet he lay'd my Armies in the dust: Shall I repine because I dayly see My foes prevaile, and triumph over me, No, no I will not, they shall live to dye, When I shall dye, to live, and glorifie The Generall of Heav'n, within wohse Tent I hope to rest, where Time will ne're be spent. But now, ah now, these lipps must bid farewell, Methinks I hear (Deaths Orator) the Bell Plead for an issue, and I must not stay, Death comes in haste, and I must post away: Come then my tender Babes, &amp; Dearest Spouse, (Thou that wert alwayes constant to thy vows) And let these short-liv'd armes of mine inclose You all together, e're I doe repose My earth-defatigated limbs; forbeare To drench my farewell in so large a teare; My deare Relations, if my wasting glasse Afford no sand, I must be gon; Alasse Teares cannot hold my soul; and who may have More priviledge to take, then he that gave; My Iourney's almost ended, and I must Take up an Inn, and lodge my self in dust, Then shine upon me with the beams of mirth, That I may say, I saw a heav'n on earth, A pleasing smile, or two, will make me know No paine in death, but if in teares you flow, Oh then— —But know, my dearest, Heav'n will be A fitter husband for thee far than me. Thou need'st not fear thy foes contriving harmess They cannot keep thee from his folding armes, As they have done from mine; oh may wee meet, I dare not say, within a winding sheet; For I am sure those weeping Babes will misse Th'unwelcome absence of so great a blisse; But when thy husband, heav'n shal please to bring Thy soul into his Quire, oh then wee'l sing Prolonged Anthems, where we shall combine Our souls together, in a place divine; Till then—oh why, why does thy trembling hand Freeze within mine? Ah me, why dost thou stand And gaze upon me? are thy veins afray'd To entertaine thy blood? has grief betray'd Thy fainting heart to death, wilt thou precede My resolutions, give me leave to lead The way to heav'n; Alasse, and wilt thou die Because I cannot live? cast back thine eye Upon thy Royall Issue, doe but see How fast their sighes doe saile in tears to thee, Oh let the sight of them revive thy heart, Cheer up, and give me courage to depart; For they that dye because another dyes, Usurpe a Death, and make themselves a prize; Doe not, oh doe not, thus torment thy soul For my departure, if you must condole, Condole my stay, my soul desires to be Disolu'd (Indulgent God) and rest with thee; A bed of Roses; that's a fading sweet, Oh there's no comfort to a winding sheet, A Grave's the best of Pallaces; for there Is neither whining grief, nor pining care: Why should we scorne this earth that entertains Our wearied bones, and hides us from our paines; Earth is a place of worth, yet would I have Not any dote upon't but for a grave: Now death; march bravely on, and let thy dart Sing as it flies unto my obvious heart, What? art thou daunted? dost thou feare to kill Because I am a King; what? daunted still? Why dost thou look so pale? what, art thou charm'd By Majesty: or has thy self disarm'd Thy self, or else art thou asham'd to doe So foul a deed, or wil't thou not imbrew Thy shaft in Royall blood? Come, lay aside Thy feare, and shoot, or else my foes will chide: But hold a while (nor doe I bid thee stay, Because my soul's desirous of delay) Once more thou sole-Commandresse of my brest, Draw nere, before I fall into my rest, Approach unto me, let these lipps of mine In?t?aile a farewell on those cheeks of thine, Weep not, but let thy tender knees salute The ground with mine, let's labour to confute Our sorrows with our prayers, and recommend Our souls to heav'n, whose glory knows no end; Thou great, thou glorious, thou all-ruling King, Thou Rocke, thou fountaine, thou eternall spring Of Grace; we that are cloathed with the night Of sin, present our selves into thy sight, And with unfained hearts devoutly pray That thou wouldst send thy Son to chase away Our soul-absconding cloudes, that thou mayst take A pleasure to behold us, for his sake We begg this needfull grace, in whom we know Thou art well pleased, and to whom we owe A debt unpayable, oh therefore let Thy satisfying mercy pay our debt; Oh hear our prayres, which strongly do importune Thy gracious pardon, though it was our fortune To be unfortunate, yet let us be Indulgent Father, fortunate with thee, Forgive our youthfull sins, and speak some peace Unto our souls, and as our sins encrease, So let thy mercy, more, and more abound, That having lost our sinnes, thou may'st be found; Heale our back-slidings, guide us in thy way, That so our feet may never goe astray; Oh blesse these blessings, which thy blessed hand Bestow'd upon me, let them fill the Land With good examples, guard them from their foes And send them patience, when thou send'st them woes. Hear me for them, oh God, &amp; them for me And hear our Saviour for us all, and be A father, and a husband to them all, And let me rise in mercy when I fall; Strengthen their soules, and teach them to renew Their patience, when my soul shall bid adue To this infatuated world, oh let Their hearts seclude all grief, for 'tis a debt That must be pay'd, let thy exchequer take Such ill-coyn'd treasure, as my soul can make, Oh grant (dear Father) this my great request, Then take me when thou pleasest to thy rest: So; now my Ioyes, be cheerfull, let's create A heav'nly mirth, and let our sorrowes waite Upon our pleasures, let our watchfull eyes Observe our makers great imunities. Let's first observe how his free hand provided For us, before we were, how he devided The water from the land, and made it drie To entertaine our feet, and made the skie To give us light, and afterwards, he made Poor helplesse Man, that suddenly betray'd Himself to ruine, and by deviation, Abus'd the glory of his free Creation, But see the bounty of our God above, Who quickly turn'd his fury into love, And sent a speedy balsome to make sound The deadly anguish of so deep a wound; And shall we be ungratefull? shall wee not Remember him, that never yet forgot To pitty us? and shall we waste our dayes In vaine contentions, and not give him prayse That gave us his owne Son? whose willing breath Redeem'd our souls from everlasting death. Alasse how miserable had we been, Had his spontanious death not stept between Veng'ance, and us, and shall we then deny What he requirs, if he command that I Retire unto him, shall my soul refuse To run unto him, and imbrace the newes, Oh no, it must not, hee's accurst that shall Desire to stay, if heav'n be pleas'd to call, Death has no ears to hear complaint, 'tis vaine To weep for that which teares cannot regain: You my sad standers by, when death shall send A Message to my heart, forbear to spend Offensive teares, but rather joy, that I Am gone before you to Eternity, Where now methinks I see you all, and heare The lofty Seraphims salute my eare VVith heav'n-bred raptures, which does even woe My soul out of my eares, I long to goe And fill my self with melody, and sing Perpetuall halalujahs to my King: So; now my wasting lampe begins to blase, Come Death, and put a period to my dayes, Let out my life, that I may fly unto My God, and bid this loathed world adue: Adue vaine pleasures of unconstant earth, Adue false Ioyes, and world-derived mirth: My dear Relations, I must now expresse A farewell to you all, and then adresse My self to Heav'n, within whose Court I shall (My soul now tells me) shortly meet you all. Till then enjoy what heav'n shall please to give, And rather study how to dye, then live; Make use of time; and lavish not in vaine Those houres which cannot be recall'd againe, Comfort each other, and if fortune frowne, Smile you at fortune, lay your sorrows downe Before the face of Heav'n, and hee'l releeve Your pining wants; oh let your hearts not grieve For food, and raiment, labour to be true, And he that feeds the Ravens, will feed you; Oh let your morning thoughts be sure to mount To heav'ns high Altar, give him an account Of all your Actions, they which every day Make their accounts to God, prepare a way To goe to Heav'n; But time will give me leave T'expresse no more, my soul begins to cleave Unto a blest eternity, my heart Declares unto me, that I must depart; Time whets his sithe: oh doe not ring my Knell, With sighs and sobbs, farewell, my Ioyes, farewell: So: now the Load-stone of this world shall have, No art t'atract my soul, I'le not enslave My self to earth, shall transitory toyes Surrept my soul from heavens eternall joyes? Oh no, they shall not; now I'le dedicate My self to thee (my God) who didst create Both soul &amp; body; thou that knowst the thoughts And hearts of Kings, and numerates their faults, Pardon what I have done amisse to thee, Forgive my enemies; Thou know'st I'm free From what I suffer for; thou know'st my hands Are clear from blood, thou know'st that my commands Were not tyranical, thou knowst my brest Was never stain'd with Treason; My request Oh God is this; That thou would'st make them know (And timely feel) what a most wilful blow Th'ave given to their Consciences; oh turne Their flaming hearts to thee, which daily burne Against thy servants, cause them to relent; And let their griefs induce them to repent, Be mercifull to them, as they were cruell To me, and mine, oh quench the blazing feuell Of their desires, give them not their deserts, But wash my blood from their Infountain'd hearts; And as for me, presented to thy eyes Suppos'd (as an attoning Sacrifice) By them whose seav'n yeers mallice have contriv'd My downfall; when my body is disliv'd Receive my soul into thy glorious Tent, And mak't a member of thy Parliament; Now farewell world, and dirt-composed Crowns Farewell earths smiles, &amp; fortunes surly frowns. Farewell to you that thus my life expell, Oh may my farewell, make you all farewell. Reader; the sound of death hath made me start Out of my slumbers, and my wakned heart Trembles within me; Oh what shall we doe? Oh may I never dreame, to dreame thus true; But since 'tis so, (kind Reader) let thy eye Survay the pathes of his sad Elegie, Lavish not out your teares too fast, but keep A strong reserve, your eyes must bleed, or weep. Till then adue, and when I meet thee there, Reader, assure thy self, I'le spend a teare. AN ELEGY UPON That never to be forgotten CHARLES, THE FIRST; Late (but too soon Martyr'd) King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland. VVho with unmoved Constancy, lay'd downe His Life, t'exchange it, for a heav'nly Crowne. Ian. 30. 1648. ? In edibus Regum Mors venit ? My shivering body, oh what stormy weather Was that, which violently tost me hither; Where am I now? what rubicundious light Is this? that bloodyes my amazed sight? What Reformation's this that's newly bred, And turnes my white, into so deep a Red. Awake my fancy, come, delude no more, Say; are my feet upon the English shore? Sure not; these are usurping thoughts that raine Within the Kingdom of a troubl'd braine: If this be England, oh what alteration Is lately bred within so blest a Nation; My soul is now assured; for I see Those lofty Structures where mild Majestie Did once recide; abounding with a flood That swells (&amp; almost moates them round) with blood, England, sad object, that wer't lately crown'd with a most glorious prince; how art thou drownd In Royall blood? was not thy master-veine Open'd of late; ah, who can stop't againe? Look round about thee, and thou shalt discry How every face imports an Elegy. Review thy self, see how thou art ingrain'd With guiltlesse blood? was ever Land so stain'd? Needs must your hearts expect a cloudy night Now Sol is set, and Cynthia wants her light: And dost thou thinke, O England, to immure Thy self in blood, and alwayes rest secure? Oh no, assure thy self, there is a hand That rules above, which will correct thy land: Be well advis'd, oh Nation; learn to know That language cannot ebb, when blood shal flow, All hearts all eyes, all hands, all tongues, all Quills Will think, will weep, will write, &amp; speak their wills, I'le not invoke; this Subject will invite Th'obdurest hearts, and teach that pen to write Which never fram'd a Letter, and infuse The seed of Life, into a barren Muse: Thou Great Instructer, teach me to distill An Eagles Vertues, with an Eagles quill: Rais'd by a fall, my Muse begins to sing The melancholly farewells of a King. And is he gone! did not the dolefull Bells Desolve, when as they told his sad Farwells. If he be gone? what language can there be Remaining in this land, except, Ah me. Ah me, Ah lasse, how is this realme unblest In such a losse?—I cannot speak the rest: My heart is full of arrowes short of late From the stiffe Bowe of a commanding State. Each wound is mortall, yet in spight of paine; I'le pull them out, and shoot them back againe; And when my tongue shall empty out my heart, Let death surprize me with a single dart, I'le strive t'out-face Rebellion; and my eyes Shall scorne all new invented Tyrannies; Sorrow will not be tongue-tyd, tydes must run Their usuall courses, till their strength is done, I have a streame of grief within my brest, That tumbles up, and down, and cannot rest, I am resolv'd (let death diswade) to speake What Reason dictates, or my heart must break, I'le mount the stage, let standers by behold My actions, for my sorrows must be bold, I feare not those, whose powers may controul The language of my tongue, but not my soul; Advance dejected seuls, hear reason call, Let not the truth be passive, though we fall. Blush not to owne those teares, which you have spent In private, for a Publick discontent; Let not your tongues be Pris'ners to your lippes When Iustice calls, oh let not fear ecclipse The light of truth, rouse up your selves, draw neare When Iustice findes a tongue, finde you an eare. The day's expir'd, bright Sol hath drawn his head Within the curtaines of his Tethean bed, Where shall we hide our slumbring soules, and lay Our wearied limbes, till he renewes the day? A day! Alasse, have not our wretched eyes Seen a great fall? can we expect a Rise? Should Heav'n (who justly may) command his powres T'expell his light, as we have lately ours, What should we doe? where should we finde a sun, That have by too much doing, quite undone Our wilfull selves? by snuffing out that light Which he inspir'd, to guard us from the night Of sad confusion; Ah, how could we spoile So pure a lampe, and so usurpe that oyle Which was ordain'd to nourish us? We run To light a Candle, and put out the Sun; In vaine we waste our times, and range about To look for new lights, now the old Light's out, We seek; and we may finde; but heav'n knows when Old lights were made by God, &amp; new by men. Shake England, for thy Grand Vpholders downe, Thy feet have lately spurn'd against thy Crowne, Thy hands are daub'd with blood, one ruine calls An other, to the others funeralls; Destruction thunders, and the earth is fill'd With doleful ecchoes; blood that hath been spill'd By unjust hands (like Seas) begin to roare, As if 'twould take revenge upon the shore: The whistling woods, and their subjected springs Sends forth Elegious blasts, each corner rings With unaccustom'd sounds; All things expresse (By their prognosticating looks) unhappinesse; Deploring Philomel does now repeate Contristed notes, upon her Thorny seate; She has forgot those sweet nocturnall notes Which lately charm'd all sorrow, now she dotes Upon her woefull, her prolixed tones, And findes no sweetnesse in her bitter groanes: The Commons of the aire conspire to throw Their Soveraigne downe, and will not fly so low As formerly; but are resolu'd to be Oppugnant to the Eagles Majesty. How pregnant is Rebellion every where, Not onely here on earth, but in the aire? Can thunder roare, and not the lofty found Be heard? can Cedars fall unto the ground, And not be seen? can Mountaines shrinke away And not observ'd? or can there be a day Without a Sun? or can there be a night Without some darknesse? can there be a light Put out unwanted? or can murther be Committed upon sacred Majestie, And not lamented? sure no humane heart Can be so brazen, as not to impart Some sorrow to the world, for such a losse, When gold is gone, how uselesse is the drosse: Now mournfull Muses, light your Torches all, T'attend your glory to his Funerall; Shall your Mecænas dye, and you stand still, And not appeare upon Parnassus hill? Away, away, invoke Appolloes aide, Tell him that your Mecænas was betray'd To an unlawfull death, and you desire To sacrifice a verse; And then retire: Could I translate my heart into a verse, I'de pinne it with my soul upon his herse. Could I command the word, I'de make it burne Like a pure lampe upon his sacred Vrne: Could I command all eyes, I'de have them make (As a memoriall for Great Charles his sake) A sea of teares, that after ages, may Lament to see, but not lament to say He dy'd without a teare; and it should be Call'd the salt Sea of flowing Loyaltie: Could I command all hearts, I'de make them spend Some drops of blood upon his tombe, and send Millions of sighes to Heav'n, that may expresse His death was Englands great unhappinesse; Could I command all tongues, I'd make them run Devision on his praise, till time were done; Could I command all hands, I'de strike them dead Because they should not rise against their head. Could I command all feet, I'de make them goe And give the Son that duty which they owe To His deserts? ?I'm in a desert, and I know not where To guide my steps, that path which seems most faire, Proves most pernicious to me, and will lend My feet a good beginning, but no end. Great Charles, oh happy word, but what's the next (Bad's th'application of so good a Text) Is dead; most killing word; what is he dead? Nay more (if more may be) hee's murthered; Ah then my thoughts are murther'd; my sad eyes Shall never cease to weep his Obsequies: I'le turne this place into a bubbl'ing spring Of briny teares; and then I'le freely bring A Sacrifice to sorrow, which shall be A flaming heart that's crown'd with Loyaltie: Now could I spend an age in thoughts, and tyre The night with sighes, methinks I could inspire. Sorrow it self, and teach it to proclaime What ruine waites upon our new-bred flame: But 'tis in vaine, perswasions have no powre On them, whose resolutions can devoure Both Law and Reason, two most horrid Crimes In these pernicious, these contentious Times: Come then my thoughts, and let us ruminate Upon our sorrows; oh unhappy Fate, Why didst thou snuffe out Charles his royall blaze In the Aurora of his well-spent dayes? But 'tis in vaine to blame thee, for thy hand Cannot refraine to strike, if God command; Heav'n saw he was too good to be enjoy'd By us; but not too good to be destroy'd For his owne glory; Let's rejoyce, we had So good a King; but grieve, to thinke how bad We us'd his goodnesse; VVe may justly say, He gave in mercy, what he took away In Iudgement, for his owne commands appointed We should not touch, (much more slay) his anointed And yet we have, (as if our hearts had sworn To contradict his will) abus'd, and torn His owne Vicegerent, to whose thriving hand He gave the Scepter of a glorious Land: But now (unhappy Land) thy glorie's fled, Thy Crowne is fallen, and thy Charles is dead; Goe then, deplore thy self, whilst others sing The living vertues of thy martyr'd King; His glory shall survive with Fame, when they Shall lye forgotten in a heape of Clay That were the Authors of his death, their bones Shall turne to ashes, as their hearts are stones But did my tongue expresse that they should be Forgot; oh no, their long liv'd Tyrannie Shall be perpetuall; harke, misfortune sings The worst of Tyrants, kill'd the best of Kings. He was the best; what impious tongue shall dare To contradict my language, or impare His living worth, and they that goe about To blast his Fame, oh may their tongues drop out. Pardon oh Heav'n, if passion make me breake Into extreames, who can forbeare to speake In such a lawfull cause? may we not claime A Priviledge to speak in Charles his name. Is any timerous? then let them keep Their language, and reserve themselves to weep: Is any Joyfull? let them keep their mirth To please the Tyrants of this groaning earth. Is any sorry? let them keep their grief Till heav'n shall please to send their souls reliefe; Did ever Iland finde so great a losse? Was ever Nation crownd with such a crosse? Could ever Kingdome boast they had a Prince That could be more laborious to convince The errours of his times, or contradict The dictates of his rage, or be more strict In his Devotions; ne're did Prince inherrit So rich a Crowne, with so inrich'd a spirit. He was the best of conquerours; he made Conquests of hearts, although he was betray'd By some inferiour spirits, which he found Had lately started from the lowely grownd, And were not worth a conquest; yet he gave Them more respects then their deserts could crave None could observe during the the time he stood Before his Pilates, that his royall blood Mov'd into fury, but his heart was prone To hear their speeches, and retort his owne; But when they found his language did increase With sense, he was desir'd to hold his peace, And some related that their furies bred, Because his hatt inclos'd his royall head. Good God, what times are these, when subjects dare Presume to make their Soveraigne stand bare; And when they sent him from their new-made place Of Iustice, basely spit upon his face, But he, whose patience could admit no date, Conquer'd their envies, and subdu'd their hate. Ah who could blame our Soveraigne to decline Their wayes, and say, was ever grief like mine? First when his feet approach'd into the Hall, The ill-tun'd tongues of sycophants would call Aloud for Iustice, though they never knew What Iustice was, yet still they would renew Their most confounding, and discordious noates, And baul for Iustice with their sluce-like throats; But he, that Lambe of Patience, never vented A word of anger, but with speed prevented Their louder cryes, and with a pleasing breath Reply'd; If Iustice can be gain'd by death, Ye shall not want it, only be content, Ye may as soon endeavor to repent, As now ye doe to spill my blood; advise, Your souls will suffer for your forward cryes; Having thus spoke, immediately he stept Unto the barre, where for a time he kept Himself in silence; like a sun he shin'd Amongst those gloomy clowds which had combin'd Themselves together, plotting to disgrace His orient luster, and impal'd his face: And with a thundring voice, they first salute His ears with Tyrant, Traytor, and impute Murder unto him: with a pleasing smile He look'd upon them, and a little while He made a pause; but by, and by, he broke His silent lipps, and moderately spoke To this effect: May I desire to know From whence this great authority doth flow That you pretend to act by? If it be Derivative; I shall desire to see, And know from whom; till then I shall deny To give my tongue a licence to reply. You are our Pris'ner Sir, you ought not to Demand what your appointed Iudges doe, For our Authority 'tis known at large Unto our selves; pray answer to your charge, Or else we shall proceed. I thought t'have seen My Lords and Peers together, that had been A means to make my fading hopes renew, For most of them I know, but none of you. As for my Charge, I owne it as a thing Of small concernment, as I am a King You cannot try me, what your new made laws May doe, I know not, have a care, and pause Before you act in blood, strive to convince Your stubborn hearts, &amp; know, I am your Prince; Y'are but abortive Iudges, have a care, Ye may be tangl'd in your own made snare: Proceed; ye can but throw me to the earth, They which parturiate needs must owne the birth, God knows my heart; 'tis not my life, that I Account of, but my Subjects Liberty, That's all that I desire;—Sir, now we must A little interrupt you, 'tis unjust A Prisoner (as you are) should be allow'd So great a priviledge; y'ave disavow'd Our known Authority, and make a sport Of reall Iustice, and affront the Court; Feed not your guilty heart with such delay, Waste no more time, for Iustice will not stay? Pray give me leave to speak, great Charles reply'd You ought not Sir to speak, we're satisfy'd Already of your guilt, you must prepare To heare your Sentence, and you must forbeare Your vaine, and weake discourses: Is it so, He then reply'd; that I am forc'd to goe Away unheard; Alasse, 'tis not the voice Of death can daunt my breast, ye may rejoyce At my destruction; though you have no eare To entertaine my language, heav'n will heare. Take notice people; that your King's deny'd To speake: was ever Iustice rul'd by Pride? Thus having lay'd the burthen of their spight Upon his head, they sent him from their sight; But he (that was inspir'd by heav'n) did show A countenance that did import their woe, More then a sorrow for his death, his face Was dy'd with honor, theirs, with foul disgrace, His patience was their passions, and they found His minde a kingdom, where his heart was crown'd With constant love; oh that I could rehearse His living vertues, with a living verse: But now my Pen must leave him for a time, And dwell upon the mountaines of that crime Which they committed; Put a King to death! Oh horrid action! what venomous breath Pronounc'd that fatall sentence? may it live To poyson Scorpions, and not dare to give The least of sounds, to any humane eare. Sure he was deaf himself, and cou'd not heare The cadence of his language; for the sound Had been sufficient to inflict a wound Within his marble heart; oh such a deed Stabbe Kingdoms to the hearts, and makes them bleed Themselves to death; to loose so good a King, By such base means, will prove a viperous sting To this detested Land;— —If Kings transgresse, And prove Tyrannical, we must addresse Our selves to Heav'n, and by our Prayers desire Th'assistance of his mercy, to inspire Our Soules with true obedience, that we may Strengthen our selves, and passively Obey What actively we cannot; for Kings reigne By God, we therefore ought not to maintaine Our rage against them; he that shall controul The actions of a King, burthens his Soul With a most ponderous crime; If, to suppose But Ill of Kings be sin; oh how have those Transgress'd that have destroy'd their King, and made Him subject, to bad subjects, that betray'd Their Souls to Tyranny: Oh Heav'n forgive What they have done, and let their sorrows live Within their Souls; Oh make them to behold Their errors; Let not Conquest make them bold. Here stop my Muse, let's labour to accost Our former glory, Charles, though we have lost His Sacred Person, yet we must not loose His happy memory; Ah who can chuse But sigh, when as they seate his glorious name Within their serious thoughts: If ever Fame Receiv'd a Crown; It was from him, whose worth My wearied Quill's too weak to blazon forth; And when the best of my endeavor's done, I shall but light a Candle to the Sun, Yet I will spend my strength; a feeble light Plac'd by a greater, makes it shine more bright: He was ('tis not unknown to all the earth) A Prince by vertue, and a Prince by birth. In the exordium of his Reigne, he sway'd The Scepter of this Land, (till time betray'd Cupid to Mars) with a Majestique brow, And made his cheerfull subjects hearts to bowe In honor, and it could not be exprest Whether he rul'd himself, or subjects best; He was a Prince, whose life and conversation Impoverish'd vices, and inrich'd his Nation With good examples, honor never found So sweet a harbour, vertue never crown'd So rare a heart; Love reign'd within his eye, And there was cloathed with Divinitie, Vertue and Majesty did seem to strive Within his Royall breast, which should suruive In greatest glory, but 'twas soon decided, Martha and Mary, would not be devided, No more would they, there was a simpathy Between them both, for if the one should dye, The other could not live, they were combin'd Within his breast, and could not be disjoyn'd. Oh happy is that Land, where Vertue shall Meet Majesty within a Princes hall. He was a King, not onely over Land, But over Passion, for he could command His Royall self, and when approaching trouble Assail'd his minde, his wisedome would redouble His present patience, and he would allow The worst of sorrows, a contented brow; His undevided soul was alwayes free To propagate the workes of Pietie; His heart was still attracted to good motions, By the true Loadstone of his firme devotions. He alwayes studied how to recompence Good deeds with full rewards: as for offence He sooner would forgive it, then impose A punishment; his meeknesse made his foes Grow supercillious, and at last, they made A private snare, and zealously betray'd The Lord of Englands life, whose free consent Granted them a trieniall Parliament To salve the Kingdomes grievances, but they Took not the grievances, but Him away; It could not be distinguish'd which did Reigne Mars or Apollo, most within his braine: He was a Cæsar, and the equall fame Of Warr, and Wisdome dwelt upon his Name; As for his Martiall parts, Edge-hill will beare An everlasting record, how his care And resolution did maintain that fight, Till day submitted to th'incroaching night; Although Heav'ns Generall was pleas'd to bring Such small conditions, to so great a King; We must not judge, that 'tis successe, that can Procure the title of a Valiant man, For that, will but instruct him how to fly Upon the wings of popularity; As for his Theologick parts I may Without presumption absolutely say He was a second David, and could raise A lofty straine to sing his Makers praise; Read but his Meditations, and you'le finde His breast retain'd a heav'n-enamel'd minde: Now Reader, close thine eyes, &amp; doe not read My following lines, except thy heart can bleed, And thou not dye; ah heer's a mournfull text, Imports a death, suppose what follows next, And 'tis enough; oh that I could ingrosse The language of the world, t'expresse this losse; Break hearts, weep eyes, lament your Soveraigns fall, And let him swimme unto his funerall In Subjects teares; oh had yon seen his feet Mounted the stage of blood, and run to meet The fury of his foes, and how his breath Proclaim'd a correspondency with death; Oh then thy diving heart most needs have found The depth of sorrow, and receiv'd a wound That Time could not recure, oh such a fight Had been sufficient to have made a night Within this little world, hadst thou but seen What foul-defending patience stood between Passion, and him; with what a pleasing grace, (As if that Death had blush'd within his face) He look'd upon his people, which surrounded His mourning Scaffold, whilst his thoughts abounded With heav'nly raptures; his Angellike voice Taught Ioy to weep and sorrow to rejoyce; Teares blinded many, that they could not see So bloody, so abhorr'd a Tragedie. He look'd, as if he rather came to view His Subjects, then to bid them all adue; Feare had no habitation in his breast, And what he spoke, was reddily exprest; Heav'ns sacred Orator devinely tipp'd His tongue with golden languages, and dipp'd His soul in Loves sweet fountaine, so that all That lov'd, admir'd, and griev'd to see him fall; Whilst he (submitting Prince) devoutly pray'd That heav'n would pardon those that had betray'd His body to the grave; as from his soul He had forgave them all, and did condole Their sad conditions; having spent his breath, He yeelded (like a lambe) unto his death. Much more he utter'd; but my burthen'd Quill Recoyles, and will not prosecute my will; My Pen, and I, must now abruptly part, Pardon (oh Reader) for love bindes my heart With chaines of sorrow, let me crave, what I Shall want in language, that thou wilt supply In Meditation; but before I let My quill desert my hand, I'le make it sett This Tragi comick period to my story, Charles liv'd in trouble, and he dy'd in glory. FINIS. Habakkuck. cap. 1. vers. 13. Thou art of purer eyes (Oh God) then to behold evill, and canst not look on iniquity: Wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous then they? AN EPITAPH Upon Caines, having kill'd their Abel, lay'd Him underneath, whom they betray'd And forc'd to death (Kinde Reader) know Religion was his overthrow. Lament, lament, this fatall losse, England never had a Crosse So great as this; Let every eye Keep teares to weep his Elegie. I may presume to say, a Tombe Never had a richer wombe. Goe not till your sorrows have Offer'd teares unto his grave; Faile not to spend some reall groanes, Except your hearts are turn'd to stones. Now methinkes his ashes cryes Guiltlesse blood's a Sacrifice, London lately lost her heart, And is sick in every part, Nothing could appease but blood, Death took her King, and left a flood. FINIS. AN ELEGY UPON The Right Honorable, the Lord CAPELL, Baron of Hadham; Who was beheaded at Westminster, for maintaining the ancient and Fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdom of England. March the 9. 1648. Heu jacet, aut factis vivat ubiq; suis. Disturbe me not, my thoughts are mounting high, To build a Nest for Capells memory. Fool that I am, I doe not meane, a Nest, No, nor a Kingdome neither, that's the least Of all my thoughts, It is a world, that shall Be rul'd by Capells eccho; hollow all Ye sacred Muses, and conspire to bring Matterialls for this worke, and learne to sing; For should ye weep, your eyes might undertake To drown that world, which I intend to make. Forbeare; your teares are uselesse, you must now Gaze upon death with an undaunted brow, Capell has taught us how to entertaine The palled looks of Mars, by him we gaine The art of dying, and from him we have The diffinition of a Noble grave; Rare soul, I say, thy ever active Fame Shall build a world upon thy pregnant name, And every Letter of thy Name shall raise A spacious kingdom, where thy ample praise Shall be recorded, every hearkning eare Shall prove Ambitious, and admire to heare: 'Twill be a glory, when the world shall say 'Twas bravely done, his Soveraigne lead the way, And he (as valiant Souldiers ought to doe) March'd boldly after, and was alwayes true To sacred Majesty; his Noble breath Disdain'd the fear of a Tyrannick death; Death added life unto his thoughts, for he Contemn'd a life, if bought, with infamie. The very birds shall learne to prate, and sing, How Capell suffer'd for his Royall King. Rouze then ye stupid sons of Morpheus; Let This shining Sun of English valour set And rise within your horizons, your hearts I mean, and teach you how to sing in parts The Anthems of his worth; oh understand That this was he, whose death hath fill'd the land With living sorrow; this was he, whose glory Shall lend the world an everlasting story: You lust-obeying Tarquins, that permit And tollerate your pleasures, to commit Adulterated actions, and command England, our poor Lucretia, to stand Subject to our libidinous desires, And cannot help her self, heav'n grant your fires May soon expire, that at the last we may (Like Tarquins) see you banish'd quite away. Say, will your hung'ry appetites receive No satisfaction? have ye vow'd to leave No noble blood? A lasse how can your meek And tender consciences, thus roar, and seek Like greedy Lyons, scenting up, and downe To finde your prey in every Royall Towne. Where is that zeal which was in former times A golden pretext, to your drossy crimes? Doe ye not think of heav'n? have ye forgot There is a God? or will ye owne him not; Where is Religion (your upholder) fled? What? is that murther'd too; or have ye spread A vaile upon her, that she may not be Observ'd, or own'd, but in necessitie, Has not Religion all this while maintain'd Your unjust cause? what money's ye have gain'd Was for Religions sake, which still supply'd Your wants, but now ye're full, that's lay'd aside; Vnhappy is that land, whose People braggs, That they have put Religion up in baggs. Money preceds Religion now; but stay Precipitating quill, I've lost my way, Nay, and my subject too; how came my minde Thus much to deviate; oh where shall I finde My former subject? shall my thoughts abject His memory, and own him with Neglect: No, no, they shall not, come my Muse, repose Let's thinke upon our Friend, and let our foes Remember us, Capell, thy worth shall fill The black-mouth'd concave of my mourning quil. He was a Pompie, but receiv'd his harme From Tyrants, not from Cæsar's noble arme, He had an Army in his minde, could call Vertue to be their bold-fac'd Generall; He had no Pride, no faction to create Or nurse division in his peacefull state; He had a Court of Iustice in his breast, But not to tyrannize, or make inquest After the sons of Loyalty, or bring Illegall Iudgements, to their legall King; He had a heart, that never us'd to hide The heate of envie, or the flames of Pride; He had a Conscience never us'd t'exact Upon a widdowed Kingdome, or extract The treasures of a Nation, to defray His owne desires, he never us'd to play The Devill in the habit of a Saint, Or teach his Agitators how to paint A vice with pleasing colours, or prepare His ready eyes to shed a zealous teare With a false heart, he never striv'd to please, And turne the peoples hearts with Peter Reyes; And to conclude, he never would desire Other mens faults to maintaine his fire; Now Reader, thou hast heard he had a minde Not morgag'd unto basenesse, but inclin'd To honorable actions; It was he That was the Embleme of true Charitie, Yet some unworthy Spirits have exprest He was a son of Rome, because his breast Was fill'd with piety, and would still relieve The Poore, whose wants, instructed him to grieve. False are those base reports, he was a man Alwayes reputed a great Puritan, And not a Papist, and he had a care To have that hated Book of Common Prayre Read to his Family, himself would joyne His aide to any thing that was Devine; The church did seldome faile to entertaine His Noble self, and his domestique traine, Untill this blessed Reformation spread It self abroad, and struck Religion dead; And then indeed his Conscience would refuse To let him heare some Rabshekah abuse His Gods Annointed, and his reall heart Could not endure to hear time-servers dart Arrrows of envy at his King, and raile Against his Consort, lab'ting to intaile Disgrace upon their names, and fill the earth With heapes of errours, and rebellious mirth; These things his heart abhorr'd, he could not hear His King abused with a patient care: He was the soul of Loyalty, his minde Was alwayes active, for he still inclin'd His thoughts to goodnesse, striving how to bring Peace to his Country, honor to his King; He was a man that alwayes us'd to fly Upon the wings of true sollidity; He was compleat, and rich in every part, His tongue was never traytor to his heart; But now, ah now (I shall make Death too proud To speake it) he hath lately left this clowd, This world of envy, and is gon t'inherit Those joyes which wait upon a Noble Spirit: Now, now hee's gone to heav'ns sublimer court, Where Iustice lives, a place, where false report Shall finde no care; a place, where none shall dye For being rich, or wise; there Loyalty Shall be respected; there, the weeping eyes Of Orphans shall be pittied; there, the cryes Of Ladyes pleading for their Lords, shall finde A full respect; where Vertue is refinde, There must be happinesse, oh thinke but where It is, (kinde Reader) and brave Capells there: There, there, he rests, who stoutly trode the stage Of blood, whose life, whose death, no age Will ever paralel, his courage gave A life to death, and pleasure to a grave; He had a pleasing countenance, his face Did seem to blush, but 'twas for their disgrace, And not his guilt, he never seem'd t'expresse The least of feare, but hasted to addresse Himself to heav'n, and like a stagge, he bay'd At his unsatiated hounds, and lay'd His life before them, and contemn'd their powre Because he knew, they onely could devoure His little world; but for his soul, that went Before a more conscientious Parliament, Where now he rests in peacefulnesse, &amp; doubles His pleasures, whilst his foes survive in troubles. There rest heroick Capell, and enjoy Those rich delights, which time cannot destroy; Rest thou, whilst those are restlesse, which deny'd To let thee rest on earth, whose hearts are ty'd In bloody fetters, which conglutinates Their souls, and leades them to the worst of fates, But now my quill growes weake, I must forsake These sable pathes, I dare not undertake So great a journey, for my feeble pen Begins to stagger, grief can teach me when I shall begin, but will not prove my friend, And lead my sorrows to a peacefull end; My thoughts encrease, this subject would infuse A youthfull life, into an ancient Muse. My heart's compos'd of raptures, and my hand Receives new strength; methinks I could c?mand The spacious world, and teach it to expresse His praise on earth, though not his happinesse In heav'n, where now I'le leave him, and retire; I'le cease to write, and practise to admire. Ye have killed, and condemned the Just, and he doth not resist you. Jam. 5. 6. An EPITAPH, Upon The Right Honorable A towre is fallen, and it lyes Represented to thy eyes: Therefore, Reader, if thy breath Had an interest in his death, Unfix thy thoughts, and post away, Reason forbids a Tyrants stay: Lavish out your hearty cryes, Open wide your flowing eyes, Record his worth, and let all hearts Doate upon his living parts: Can any thinke upon his Name, And not labour to proclaime Perpetuall praises to his worth, Engaging hearts to set him forth: Let all men say, and not repent, Loe, here lyes Murthers Complement. Dignum laude virum musa vetat mori. ? A CURSE, AGAINST The Enemies of PEACE. Peace, peace Rebellious Vipers; you that cry, Advance Mechannicks, downe with Majestie. Cease your vaine wishes, may ye never rest That love no Peace; nay, may ye ne're be blest That envie Sion; ah! shall Sions glory Be thus abstracted, and thus made a story To after ages hath your hungry zeale Devoured all your senses at one meale What doe ye meane? doe ye intend to try A Reformation with Phlebotomy? Or has your hell-bred thoughts found out a way To turne a Canaan, to a Golgotha? Hath the Tartarian Counsellour invented Such thriving plotts, that cannot be prevented, Leave off base acts Mechannicks, and begin To deal uprightly, and reforme within: Bury your aged crimes, and then goe call Your stragling senses to the funerall: Thus I advise you, if this will not doe, Assure your selves I'le learne to curse ye too. May heav'n, whose frowning countenance doth show An angry resolution, overthrow You, and your prick-ear'd Progeny, and make Your children suffer, for their parents sake; May ye all begge, and wander up and downe Like vagabonds, be lash'd from Towne to Towne; And may the Loadstones of your crimes attract Ten thousand plagues, and may those plagues exact Upon your lavish souls, let impious Fate Blush, if she chance to make you fortunate. May torments pursue torments, and still grow Till Rithmatick be non-plust, and o'rethrow Your Treason-loaded hearts; And if this Curse Will not succeed, may't yeeld unto a worse For you, that this declining age may see The just rewards of your impietie. Let basenesse be entayl'd upon your names, Too strong for all recovery; Let shames And lasting infamies remaine In deeper Charactars then that of Cain. May your souls burn, till heav'n shall think it good To quench them in your generations blood, That all the world may heare you hisse, and cry Who lov'd no Peace, in Peace shall never dye. THE AVTHORS FAREWELL To England. England, farewell; th'affections that I beare To thee, I cannot name without a teare; I must be gon, my troubled Conscience loathes To staine it's welfare with thy new-made oathes, Heav'n knowes my heart, I truely hate disorders, And pitty them that live within thy boarders As for my self; I cannot stoop so low, To be subordinate to them, I know Are but inferiors, though they have of late Converted Monarchy into a State; Though heav'n conceales his anger for a time, Giving them leave to doate upon a crime; A day will come to plague their souls, and then They'le prove but devills, in the shapes of men. And so farewell, poor England, quite farewell, Where Furyes reigne, there needs must be a Hell. Anglia, jam quantum, quantum mutata vetustas, Nunc caput es sceleris, qui caput orbis eras.
