From the pure sympill hammer &amp; steth s[v]bstanciall. The celestiall soundes of musyk first made &amp; dyd exp??s They fet them not from curiosite nor grete riches. 2 Oute of the trewe plaine songe the[y] Judgyde the melody Curius conueyinge hydithe muche armanye Therfore of the playne nottis to sette a sure grounde Makithe a modulacion of moste p??fyte sounde. In curiosite oftyme trowthe slippith by. And in the playne trew nottis all the swetenes dothe lye. 3 A song myssowndithe yf the prickynge be not right. So marryd is the melody for lac of fore syght The sownde of a trew songe makithe trew concorde. But subtill prickynge mystymythe &amp; causith grete discorde. [truth.] 4 A naturall breste is goode / with sowndes of moderacion A glorifiede beste is to curyus withe notis of alteracion But he that syngithe a trewe songe mesurithe in the meane. And he that rechithe to hye a trebill / his tewnis is not clene. [moderaci?.] 5 Perfyte vowellynge of a songe to the eere is delectable He that quadribilithe to hy his voice is variable. But he is no goode Judge whiche disalowith the songe. When the ere of parcialite Judgithe it to wronge. [vnpartialnes.] 6 He that settithe a songe and makithe it new. If his warbellis be more curyus than trew. Or his songe be songe greate faute shall be fownde. In the dyuers proporciones of the mystvnyde sownde. [curiosite.] 7 A breste to audible mowntithe to affexion He that mesurithe in the meane causithe more deuocion. And he that caryethe more crochettis than his cvnnynge can prove Makithe more discorde of doblenes then melody of loue. [doublenes.] 8 He that hathe a brym brest and littill inspexion withe all. Ought to be advisede twyse of his notis musicall. For he whiche hathe a voice exaltynge to hy Fo[r] lac of goode knowlege marrithe much melody. 9 He that lyst to sett a goode trew songe. May not make his breuys to short nor his largs to longe. He that triethe his tewnes tretabilly vpon a trew grownde. If connynge be smale the trouthe may make a plesan[t]e sounde. 10 The harpe is an instrumente of swete melodye. Rude intelligens of the sounde conceyuethe no armonye. But whoso in that instrumente hathe no speculacion. What restithe withyn the sownde borde hathe but smale p??bacion. 11 He that fyngerithe well the keyes of the clavicordis makithe a goode songe For in the meane is the melodye withe a rest longe. If the tewnys be not plesant to hym that hathe no skyll. Yet no lac to the Claricorde for he doith his goode will. 12 He that is a p??fyte musicion. P??ceyvithe the lute tewnes and the goode p??porcion In myddest of the body the stryngis sowndith best. For stoppide in the freytis they abyde the pynnes wrest. 13 Many a swete refreet the musycion dothe synge. Which is litill conceyvide of light herynge. For whos sownde is applyede allway to discorde. Can never deserne the tewnes of a trew monacorde. 14 How may a mysmovede tymer Judge a trew instrument. For in tunabill tewnys he hathe non experyment. And he that hath an ere oblyvi?? &amp; febill stomake of affexion The tewnys of tuball sholde not prayse to Judge wher of he lack?? discrecion 15 A slac strynge in a virgynall soundithe not aright. It dothe abyde no wrastinge it is so louse and light. The sounde borde crasede forsith the instrumente. Throw mysgouernaunce to make notis whiche was not his intent. 16 He that couytithe in clarisymballis to make goode concordaunce. Ought to fynger the keyes withe discrete temporaunce. To myche wynd[in]ge of the pipis is not the best. Whiche may cause them to sypher wher armoney shulde rest. 17 Immoderate wyndes in a clarion causithe it for to rage. Soft wynde and moderate makithe the sounde to asswage. Therfore he whiche in that instrument wolde haue swete modulacion Bustius wyndes must leue and vse moderacion. 18 A shawme makithe a swete sounde for he tunyth basse.

If passyones of angre inflame youre brest To deffer vengeaunce yt is the best Vnto youre yre asswage and relent by pacience Then shall ye do right and not offende yo? conscience. The proverbis in the syde of thutter chamb?r aboue of the hous in the gardyng at wresyll. Remorde thyne ey Inwordly Fyx not thy mynde on fortune y? delythe dyu??sly Regarde not the worlde whiche workith craftely Sequester y? self frome them &amp; y?? cast thy syght Where it may reseyue dyuersly light. Haue thy meditacion in thyngis celestiall Worldely vanitees ar but fantasticall The gyftis of grace prent in thy memory For all worldly pleasures be transitory Of heuenly remembraunce cummythe grace Worldly vanitees indurithe no space. No thynge to fortune thow apply For her gyftis vanyshithe as dothe fantasy The more thou receyuethe of her gyftis moste vnsure The more to the aprochethe displeasure. Then in blynde fortune put not thy truste For her brightnes sone receyuethe ruste. ffortune is fykill fortune is blynde Her rawardes be fekill and vnkynde. fforsake the glory of fortune is fyckillnes of whom c?mythe worldly glory &amp; yet muche vnkyndnes. Put thy trust and in hym sett thy mynde Whiche when fortune faylithe will neuyr be vnkynde. The worlde is rounde lyke a ball And to dalyaunce it dothe the call But I here a nother sownde Whiche bidithe an other way rebounde For fere of a wors that may confounde. The one bydithe me to inclyne The other bydithe me draw from the lyne Ther be but thyng?? twayne To apply or to refrayne. Two soundes thou dost here To the better inclyne thyne ere The worlde is swete And fortune is fauoure plesaunte But the worlde variethe and fortune is vnconstaunt. The one is very delicius But it makithe the stomake foule and tedius The other is pleasaunt to the ey And no thinge confortable euyrlastyngly Therfore lat thyne inwarde ey be thy Judge Nother in the worlde nor in fortune put thy refuge. Neuyr in certaynte is the rowndnes of the ball And fortune is bretall &amp; of a glassy metall Lyke an adamunde vertue is sure To purchase her onely do thy besy cure. In chosys of lyf naturall be but thingis twayne To do as a man lyst or by reason refrayne Reason deseruyth allwayes to haue a guyde Where sensuall appetyte des??ithe grace will not abyde. Lyff covatyth worldely proteccion Bloode is inclynede to p??ciall affection Abiect thes whiche be bot temporall And thou shalt attayne to the grace eternall. Redynge and lookinge on this sympyll yf it be Abhorre not w? yt but consider and se That it was lefte the for a memoriall Of loue and kyndnes and gode mynd speciall. Repeate in thy mynde That goode nature ande kynde Hathe left the this If sensualite be blynde Repugne not agaynste kynde whiche so lovynge is. Make thy proporcion by moode Judge no thinge bot goode Haue this in thy mynde Vnto the tyme experiens dothe proue And that thou can deserue an loue As becu?ethe thy kynde. The wyse and aunciente. May err in ther Jugement. Notwithstondynge experiens Than infancy whiche ignorant is May sore erre and do amys Forget not this sentence.

And myche to y? lacke of youthe y? judgithe or he enterith g??vite. His mynde whiche this dyuysede and ment Towarde the had goode entente Accepte yt and yf affeccion wolde cause y? h? to abiecte Let reason refrayne &amp; yet in thy self haue a respecte. As his mynde was to leve this goode memory So as the goodnes requyrith haue respecte kyndly And that shall brynge ? remembraunce to posterite That other shall se y? goodnes is not forgotten whiche is lent the. More of loue than of dewte That this is doÃ±e reason may see If it be not takyn equally The mynde Judgithe sensually, Lacke of experiens and infancy of mynde. Makith thyng?? kynde to seme vnkynde Judge no thynge but goode vnto the season That loue knowyth kynde &amp; sensualyte be vnder reason. Evyll customes of Judgement By corrupte mynde makithe men Improvident. Vnto prudens aproche nere Juge the best When she enterithe ignoraunce no lengar dar rest.
