      <field name="fulltext">To the Author. Thy sugred wearses, and thy sacred songe Shall make thy neame (O Gordon) glorius Thou make forgottin Bruce obscurd so longe Reuieud to ryise againe victorious Thou crownis him with a laurell in thy storie Thou greaces him, and be augments thy Glorie. Thy greaue heroik Muse disdanis to treat Of basse and seruill loue, or fond afectione But of a Kingdome, and a Contries staet Of naturs cheifest worth, and hir perfectione Of Fortuns Champione, whom the world renounis For conquering Kingdoms, cities, touris, and tounes. Those are the first fruets of thy rair ingine The braue beginning of a virtous mind Presaging plaintie what thou'l prooue in fine Whose lamp skarsse fird doth many lights outshine Long may thou lieue whose lins braue Bruce adorne And let Bruce Ghost be glaid that thow was borne. A. Gordone. In prais of the prais worthie Author. Wise Virgill wreat Æneades long to prais Anchisis sone whome he did not behold Octauian lykd his heigh and loftie phrais And gaue the Mantuan monie myone gold The prais of Bruce (no questione) thou proclames To pleas and prais the faithes defender Iames.

If Allexander wish'd, (yit sighd') to see, That famous tombe, wher fierce Achilles lay Thow worthie chiftain, euer blesd quod he, Had Homers penn, thy praises to display, And if Eneas danger, night and day And longsome labours, bothe by sea and land, Are recompensd, and more: and he for ay, Famos'd, be Maroes martial pen doe stand. Mak Allexander judge, fame shall avow Bruce hath his guerdone of a Gordon now. M. Th. Michell. The first Booke of THE FAMOVS HISTORIE OF THE Excellent &amp; most valiaunt Prince Robert Surnamed the Brvce King of Scotland corrected and enlarged by Patrik Gordon Gentleman. Caput. 1. The Argument. The Douglas hears his Countries shame her fall And back returns from France with wofull Heart Vewing herwoes her ruine wrak and all He muche laments her lose in eurie parte, When lo a Kinght from dumps doeth him recall With whome he fights with valour strength and arte When each of life dispaires and death attends They other knoe, the fight in friendship ends, Of Martiall deeds of dreadful warres I sing Of Potentates, firce Knightes, &amp; Champions bold Who to mantaine, o're threw a valiant King Most brave atchieuments well perform'd of old What flamming swords, blood, terror, death can bring Love, tyme, and fortuns wheele that still is rold. My vrigine Muse doeth laboure to bring forth Crownd with the golden starrs which grace the North Those Heroese old whose glory seems obscure, Of which in Fames steel tables nought remains, I offer on your sacred shrines most pure, whose strength my labours weighty swey sustains, Those antients worth in you doth liue secure, which once may be the subiect of my paines, wherewith my Iaies adornd shal flie a long And make the earth enamored of my song. Why heau'ns powrd out such a deludge of woes which to the world my weeping muse doth sing, And how those sad tumultuous broiles arose, O who can tell since heauens eternal King After his wil earths Empires doth dispoese, And fatal periods to all Rengs doth bring, Who shakes the earth assunder in his wrath, And melts the heau'ns with his consuming breath But ô what wast involu'd those daies in warres? Was't not that age by force gouerning al? Which now is reuld by arte, or was't the starres? From whose coniunctions these mishaps might fall, Or was't helbred enuie that al things marres? Forcing themselues destruction forth to call No no it seemes eternal heau'ns decree, That sines owne weight, by sine ouer'throwne, 'shold be But soft my home-bred muse sore not too high Least thou or'epas what erst thou did'st intend, Send passion hence, be modest flie enuie, With pow're deuine bring this great worke to end Thou eu'erie verse, each line, each woord, must trie In my fraile brest thy sacred furie send, That who so reades these lines for those respects, Maie praise thy deeds, and pardon my defects To wit FraunceIn that faier Land where floweth al delight That heauen on earth whose paradisian plains Had drawne the Douglas farre from Fathers sight Where he both arts and elloquence obtaines He stai'd till dreidful warr with thundring might, Soundes forth his countreis ruin, woes &amp; paines Then fortune, fate, reuenge &amp; glories spoile Inuites him home vnto his natiue soyl. And once ariuing heree he might behold, The murnfull monuments of death &amp; feare, It seem'd that heauen &amp; fortune had controld The Fates, &amp; Joue by hoaried Stix did sweare, Those daies in vengeance bookes shold be enrold Those worthles times, al worthy time shold teare From memorie, as monuments of shame, The blotts of age and onely stains of Fame. As one within a Garden faire in maie Seis flora deck'd in bewtis brauest pride Sweet smelling Roses fragrant, fresh &amp; gaie, Pincks, Violets, and thousand flowers beside That parradice there onely seemes to staie. Yet Pisces coolling once faire Phæbus side; That fruitful place by frost &amp; hailes disgrac'd, So seemd this pleasant land now quite defac'd. For loe a straunger nation doth he sie Inhabit all the countrey round about, And al his natiue countrie men did flie, Yealding to feare fate, fortun, chance &amp; dout Waste ruinde walls, tours, touns &amp; hamlets be The meids and pleasant valleis in and out, Vntil'd like deserts voyd and quite forsaken. Abandon'd of their owne of strangers taken And where he goes the ground did seeme to moorne Planing for lose of her deir naturall Brood The floodes their sweetest murmuring streames did turne From fair cleir cristall dropes to crimsone blood From Forrests hone the whisling winds Retoorne Dwlce sounds of sorrows Melancholique Mood Thus in his Eares, Earth, water, winds, and Treis, Sad Musick make of sadder, Tragedeis. To see so fair a kingdome desolate And snche a mightie Nation thus forlorne His Frends all lost him self disconsolate Tears, sighs, and grons made speiche Long time forborne, At last, those Doolfull words thus Intricat With sorrows deip his woful heart has torne Ah was I borne and must I leive to sie The Sone to shine on this Thy Infamie? Ah now Poore Cuntrey wofull is thy fall But ah moire wofull is thy wretched State Thy Blis to Bail the heavens to soone did call But farre too swift now comes thy helples fate For ere vndone and no remede at all. Ah no remede, said I? yea though too late. Can heauens thy Croun of glorie from thy brow So soone teare of so famous stil til now? Where was treue vallor found if not in thee? In thee was virtue neu'r by time outworne The source of Loue the Nursse of Vnitie Where Faith and Treuth were bred brought forth &amp; borne Witts habitation Fortuns Constancie, But now al theise euen theise are quite forlorne. And in a dolful den thy Genius lies Howling for Blood &amp; vengeance to the Skyes. Hence cursed time more wold the knight haue said But he beheld a warriour at hand, His furniture and Armour sanguin red, A bunch of fethers, on his Crest did stand. Him wold this fearce, sad, angrie Earle inuade. And in the other like desire he fand, Each other with tempestuous furie greet, So in the aer the bolting thunder meet. Loth was each spear to wond his enemie, Their wrathful masters message while they go Al shiuered, moorning through the aer they fly, Complaining of vnkindly discord so, While that the Champions chaft with anger be For each disdaines, a match in armes to know, Each takes the other for an English Knight, And seeks reuenge, with force, hate, rage, dispight Eu'n as two aged strong and sturdy Oakes Against a thundring tempest firmly stand, Or as two raggid Clifs of mighty Rocks Beare of the wasting surges from the land. So each abides the others pondrous stroaks, These onely two, trew vallor did commaund. Yea who so eu'r had sien that warrlike fight, Feare would haue bred, both terror and delight. By thrusts and foins their bloes seconded be, Each waits occation, each aduantage spying. Each on the other hath a watchful Eie, Each shuns the fents, for open wards stil prying, Where plats were iyond, and buckles ty'd they fie, Yeat eithers foresight, others slight denying. Stil fretting in themselues, with rage and ire, That neither could, their conquest wisht aspire. Somtime their Swords, forth from their helm &amp; shield Send firie sparkles, spangling all the Aier. Euen so the Meteors fighting lightning yeald, Beneath the Northern Pole, that doe prepare, To cleare the starrie firmamental field. With cold extream, pure, subtil, sherp, and raire. That els wold geall, the cloustred clouds aloft, And make a bad confusion straunge and oft. As fast as haile, in sharpe and Iscie balles, Vpon the tiled housses doth alight, So thik, so fast each speedie blow doun falles, batring their helms, and shields with furious might, They fighting, wishe each others funerals: Four houres it was, since they began the fight Some litle wonds, had each of others woon, Yeat both as fresh as when they first begun. Now was the Sun, declining, to the West, When both did seem of Conquest to dispair, And yet, the Knight vnknowne, wes lustiest, His Curage, and his strength, did still repair For as, a loytring Slaue, in Lasie rest, Has spent the day, that for his Task should care And tho, to lait, at last to work doth stand Repenting, that he took, so much, in hand. Ev'ne so, the straunger Knight, did ferslie flie, Against his Foe, with Vn-resisted Might, And thogh indeed, he, some what Stronger be His Breath, induring, Longer, yet in fight, The Douglas, did that want with art supplie For, holding forth, his Suord, and Sheild, outright, He geuards him self, and bears, the others, Blo's, Now, Out now in, now heir, now thair, he goes, Both breathles now, both forc'd a while to staie, Botth leane upon their swords a while to rest: The vnknow'ne knight, thus to himselfe did saie, Ah, foolish man with madnes thus possest, Thy labor's great, great pains, great workes, to daie. With sorrows new, new woes, new cares increast, Heated by heavin, by faits, Long Coorst, ere borne, Proud Fortune holds, Thy heighe attempts in skorne Thy foile, thy shame, and thy disgrace receau'd, Not onely thou, but all the world doth know Fond man, of non but of thy selfe deceu'd, What vallor canst thou boast, what strength can show O thou, eu'ne thou, who once a kingdom crau'd Ah folly great, ah great presumtion, lo, Ah shame, thate're thou shold'st be sien or knowne, Vanquish'd by one, ou'rcom, and overthrowne. But so the Fates, and so, the heavin prouids That thou, thy strength, and weaknes, might perceave To Errors gross, Thy foolishe Mind, Thee guids Which to abait, what doth Remaine, to Crave Lost is thy Crowne, lost be thy frends, besids Chaisd from thy kingdome, hunted, like a Slave. And savadge-like, thou liu'st on herbs, and Root's In Deserts wild, those of thy panis, ar fruits. Then, fertill Scotland, fair, Adew, for Ay Good was my will, and great, was my Desire On thy blacks Hemispheare to bring the day And to Restore, Thy Friedome, Crowne, Impire But to my fond Attempts, the heavins said nay Whill Thou'rt counsumd, by Jov's wraith, hot as feire Now, wo is Mee, (for my owne wois, I say not) Bot O Thee fain, I wold remeid, and may not, The Douglas, also, was perplexed so For still him self, Condem's him self, of folie Art thou returnd from France, (quod he) to sho Thou vow'd, thy Syrs revenge, A vow most holie This mightie Task, when thou should vndergo Thy first Attemp, Thy shame returneth sollie Why then, fond man if thou be oue'rthrowne Yeild not, but Die: and keip, thy vow on-knowne. And if the heavins decree, Thy Ouerthrow And that thy vow must still be vnperfected, Yeat who the Victor is, faine would I know, If but a priuate man, then I dispit it, But if his praise, Fame, eu'rie where doth blow Then on my graue, these lines shalbe ind tit, Though chaunce, and fortune made him loose the fild, He merits praise, whose courage scorns to yealde. Where are my Predecessors deeds of old, Which like a wall impregnable did stand, And did like Pillers, firme, &amp; strong vphold, The weale, the peace, &amp; saftie of the land? Though non of those I boast, yet am I bold The worthie name of Scot, for to demaund, Whereof so manie Worthies still proceeds, As makes their Contrey famous by their deeds. Yea and this present Age, augments our Fame, With warrlik knights, that al the world admires, As machles Wallace, and the ualiant Grhame, The worthie Bruce, most glorious that appears. If one of those it were, lesse were my shame, My credit more, and more my fortune cleers. Therefore to cleere this doubt he thought it best His speech shold thus be, to the knight addrest. Stout, hardie, valliant man at armes quod he, Before our combat end, I pray thee show, Whom I ou'rcom, or who ou'rcommeth me, Since non of vs, the quarrel yet doth know, No quod the other, Sir, that may not bee, For that you made the challenge first, and so, As challenger, your cause must first be know'n, The Douglas answer'd that shall soone be showne Vnles I err, you are an English knight, I ame a Scot, and in defence will stand Of Scots free libertie, and auntient Right, So long as I can bear a sword in hand, It may be so, quod he, but in my sight You are too weake alone for to withstand, So great a taske, craues more then one I feare, Against great Edward, if you mind to warre. Quod, Douglas, tho I be alone you sie I were enough, for to Revenge, Oure harms, If I had Edwarde heir, as I have Thee, Al tho the Matchles Bruce, with Conquering Arms, Has thousands Mo, whoes valors, worth, shall flie, For dreed Revenge, with Trumpets, Loude, alar'ms Throgh all the Regions, of the English soill, And havok mak, with Rewin, blood, and spoill. Yet know an other Querrell, for Oure fight, And my iust Caus, which Iust revenge requiers: My Syre, that somtime, Erel, of Douglas hight, In Edwards prisson, spent, his Aged, yeers And their he deid, by wrong, without all Right, Whoes guietles blood, Blood-guiltie Edward, beers For whoes sad Death, eu'ne Th'ou, thy life, must lois And with these words, he thunders on the Blo's. Hold, hold, quod he, stay thy revenge, for schame, I am thy frend, no foe, nor English I, I am that Lukles Bruce, whose haples Name, Thou dus so much Exalt, and magnifie Whose froward Fortun, fate, and far-knowne fame, Is turn'd disgrace, to all eternitie, At these sad words, the Douglas stood, and gazed Blushing, astonisht, speichles, and amazed: At last he falls, before the warlik Prince, And says, my gratious Soveragne thou may Pardon, my hastie fault, my Rude offence, Or, my, Death-worthie Crime, with death Repay, That Durst offend Thy worth, thy excellence Ah curled Tyme, Ah blacke, and dismall, Day, No no sweit freind, quod he, Thy peace enioy, Long may Thou liue, in spight of fates anoy, And thus, when he had Raisd him from the Ground, He in his Arms, him Lovinglie, imbrac'd Whoes Love and Favour: alway, did abound, And alway did Indure, whill life did lest, Now both their horse, agane, at last they found And both, theme selfe, at last, from thence addrest, Both, vows, their Cuntries wo's for to Revenge, Both, to Indur, eahc others, fortuns, strange. Together then they ride a plaine throughout, Til in a forrest faier, themselues they fand, While night with sable curtens, Round about, Breaths darknes out, or shaddowing all the land, Vppon her lowring brows, sate feare and dobt: And round about, in horror trembling stand, The duskie clouds, that threts a second flood, Such Seas there swelling clusters doth includ. Cap. 2. The Argument. The Douglase coureteslye Requirs the King For to vnfold the caus of al his Greif Wherby he taks Occasion for to bring To outward vew the ground of this mischeif He schews the worthles Bate'els haples Reigne That heapt new woes on woes without releif Braue barwick, Lost Scots fall at ods and yeeld, Losing Their fredome, in a bloodie feild. Those machles champions throw the forest gon At last allight, &amp; then th?mselues adrest, Til cheirful daies bright gold? lamp should shone, within a arbour faier, to take their rest. But as ambitious minds, ar neuer alone, Til they haue honour, glorie, Fame possest, So they no rest at all, cold here attain, Such high confusion in their brests remaine. At last, the Douglas thus began, braue Prince, And my most gratious Souerainge quod he, Long may thou liue in Natures excelence, Iou's loue, Fates fauour, fortunes constancie, Thy worth exalted, by heauens influence, And thy braue selfe, long haue I wsht to sie, God graunt thy shining sonne with golden Raies, Our darkest nights may chaunge to brightest daies. Let not my bold presumtion thee offend If I require to know the woefull birth, Of sorrows which thy countenance forth send, For loe swift Fame, did sound thy praise, thy worth In Fraunce, while carelesse, I on court attend, which cleers my clouds of care, with lamps of mirth, And did my sad, vnsetled, Thoughts, destroy Thy sweit report, so fild, my Eares, with Ioy Then I returnd in hope of blest reliefe, Which I foresawe, thy worth would soone afford, And thou, eu'ne thou, would ease thy contreis griefe, Whose glorïe great, must be by the restord, Sene to Reuenge our blood, woe, wrake, mischiefe By Iustest Heauens, thou onely art implord, Doe then braue Prince, what heauen for thee ordains Thy Knight I am, in warre, peace, Ioy, or pains. The gallant Bruce, sat long tyme much amazd, Loth to vnfould his straunge misfortunes, rare, In wrath he star'd, he lookt, about he gaz'd, He sigh'd, he grond, as One, Into Dispair His rolling Eies, at last, from Earth, he Ras'ed And Cleird with heavenlie smylls, the clowds, of cair Whill as the Douglas, long did him, behold This sadd, and wofull, Tragedie, he told. Sad may it seeme and sorrowfull, to Thee Thois wofull news Thou do's Requeir' to heare but much more cair, and greif, it breids, to Mee Who must not onely heare and lend my eare, But must relate euen what my eies did siee, Yea what myselfe did act, yet I'le forbeare Those fond complaints, and make a true narration, What most offends me, and afflicts my Nation. And to vnfould this tragick storie soe To know the motiue, first, it doth requier And eu'rie truest circumstance to sho, Whereof is much that will delight the eare, Than to th'intentall may mor cleerly know The ground of this, so firce &amp; crwel warr, Our various speach let vs devert and view, The dreidfull, horreid horrors, that ensew Thrie Alexanders, thrise waere Scotlands, King The first, for valiaunt deids, surnam'd, the fierce Was Malcolm, Canmoirs, sone, the second, Rings Was after, good, king Will'iame, did, deceas Whois braue, vndanted, Deids, made fame, to sing The Lion-king, as histories Rehers The thrid that did Oure, Crown, and scepter wear Henre, the third, of Englands, doghter, fair. In mariage took which haple he devynd Should then conclud, A full, and finall Peace That both these Antient kingdoms, thus Combind Those great and Mightie Nations, might Imbrace A Freindlie League, and Concordance, in mind An happie Time to thair Ensewing race, By ending all the warrs, the broyls, the steir's, That had remain'd, full, thryse five hindreth zeirs. But heavens decreed it, should not so Remaine For the appointed Time, was not foretolde Mans subtill plots, and wits ar, all in vaine In vaine their wais, in vaine this work, they wold, In vaine they go about, for to obtaine What Ioue as secret to himself did hold, In uaine was al these fond deuises thought, Since heaujn decred, that al shold turne to noght. For lo betwixt burnt Illion and King orne, King Alexander di'd by fall of horse, When thirtiefoure yeres of, his Raigne was worne, He no succession liad, and which was wors, Blood-thristie-warr by wings, of veng'ance borne, Did tear Our kingdom's bouwells but Remors, Waikining by oft Diminishings, at Lenght, The vains, the Nerv's the sinne vs, of oure strenght, Six yeares the land gouerned was in Peace, By Regents fix, at laste some broiles arose, Whereby soe straunge gouernament did cease Such bloodie factions, did themselues oppose, who from that boundage wold the land release, And of annot her King wold make a chose, For wel they knew what trains they shold imbark To set this headstrong Nations once awarke A councel then of all, they call to choose The neerest of the Roiall bloode for king, The Baliol there his right did wel peruse, From the first female his descent to spring, And from the first borne Male, I not refuse My lineall and iust descent to bring Thus plead wee both, nor can we once accord, No peace our haughtie stomaks cold afford. And thus our hate grew greater daie by daie, Both thirsting for a Princely Diadem, Nor cold the meanest thought of wife delaie, Preuent our wo, our wrack, our countreis shame, On wo, on wracke, on ruine and decaie, Ambition can not looke, nor thinke, nor dreame, But for the Croun, while wee're a spyring thus Wee robd of what shold make it Glorious. For with vs two, two mightie armies rose, To winn the Croun or lose our selfe and all, Scotlands great Primat did himselfe oppose Betwixt vs then a treat of peace to call, Who did so much, at last wee made a choise, Thus to accord and to agrement fall, To iudge our right by Englands mighty King, Who shold decerne, which of vs both shold reigne. Wherefore in haste to Englands King wee send, Requesting him to take the cause in hand, Who then prepard his conquest to defend, In fertill Fraunce, with many warlike band, And their his large Dominions to extend By force of armes, and by his valiant hand, Yet for to put our Kingdom to a rest, He turnd, and bake to Yorke himselfe adrest, Of learned men he twentifour there brought, Whose graue aduise in this great worke he vs'd, But lo my proud competetor bethought Him thus, If I and my iust right were chusd Than were he all vndon, and threfore soght By some lewd meane to get mee quite refus'd, At last resolu'd to buie a Diadem With fowle dishonour, and eternall shame. Wherfore he dealt in secret with the King, If him he wold preferre the Croune to weare, By chatter, Seale, by Oth and eu'ry thing, He bound himselfe of him the Croune to beare, And for the same his homage to resigne, To whose base minde, at first he gaue noe Eare The most part of the Lawiers parted thence All iudging me iust heire and Righteous Prince. But counsell caused this mightie King to err, Counsell of these that by dissention liue Still vrging him the Bailiol to preferr, That for his guerdon would a Kindom giue, But he that knew my right farr worthier Euen from my foes proud offer did deriue His argument, and vnto me presentes The Croune, if I fullfild the same contents. Which offer base I plainely did refuse, Wherefore King Edward in his wrathful Ire, With Baliol decreits, and did abuse My right, enstalling him whose blind desire Led him for honor, Infamie to choose And for a crovne to slave a free Empire, For loe in him two contraries agree, Base Avarice, and Prodigalitie. Thus he returnd with pomp and Majesty Whom all the Lords and Princes of Estate Conuaied to Skoene with royall dignity, Where stood the Auncient Marble cheir of late, There was he cround with Kingly Roialty, In Robs whose worth were longsum to repeat, Imbroadred al with stons, with pearle, with gold, Gorgious to weare, and glorious to behold. But litle knew the Princes of the Land, That he to Englands King shold homage paie, The croune that sixtien hundreth yeers did stand, Gainst endles warr and cruel Armes Essay, Nor Romans, Danes, nor Saxons cold command, Vnconquer'd still, nor conquer'd wold obaie, Was now betraied by him whose haples name Became his countreis skorne and Kingdoms shame. But when report had showne the haples losse, The commons gan to murmur here &amp; ther, Against the Nobles, vowing that their choise Shold be with armes, their freedom to repaiere, And all the Princes of Estate by those Were schandalizd with shame, reproch &amp; feare, Thus ciuill descord broght a fearful fall On King, on countrey, Kingdom, croune and all. For now the king in heigh contempt was brought With all the Lords and Princes of Estate The Lords in hait and great disgrace were thought With all the commoun Multitude of Late When al with wit and valor should have wrought Thus Raise a fearfull straunge and new debaite That hardest Adamantine hearts wold move But for Their sin so heavens decree'd aboue Of these ensewing sorrows now the King Forseis forthinks and Meditats and Moins A Thousand greifs did in his bosome spring Assailing all his wofull heart at ons One day he wold be secret furth to bring The wofull birth of tears of sighs and grons Throune on his bed with Rageing Discontents At last he thus burst furth in heighe complaints Ah haples wretch Curst be the Fatall hour. Wherein I did Obtaine a Diadem By false conceat by strong entysing Pow'r Not cairing for Disgrace for loss for shame While auarice and ambition did deuour Treuth, Knowledge, witt, discretion praise and fame, Ah Auarice, inchaunter of the wise, The blind devouror of faire honours prize. O bloodie starres why did you thus agree, To make a bad conjunction at my birth? Why did you al power doune mischiefe from hie? To make vyle me, the abject of the earth, What shall al times and ages saie of me? To buie a croune, that sold a Kingdoms woorth, The reuenews I sold to buie the Name, Exchaunging honour for eternall shame. What woe or griefe but time can make it old, Yet Infamie time neuer can svppresse, The meaner sort their faults will pas vntold, But faults of Kings by Fame doe stil increase, Such spotts are in my leaprous sowle enrold, As still accuse me of my guiltines, And while my wronged people me doe vewe, Me thinks their eies to death doe me persue, In midst of this his sorowful complaint, His eies grew heauie dround with floods of tears, His tongue, his throt no more their sound forth-sent Thus slummerd he full fraght with greifes &amp; fears At last this fearfull vision did present A dreadful sounding noice that pearst his eares, Hee thought he saw before him all at once, Were nintie Kings, and two on golden Throns. Each bore a close rich couerd glorious Croune, In forme like an Emperiall Diadem, With ribs of gold o'rthwart aboue &amp; doune, All round about each bowing like a beame, In the fore front were made of Iacinths broune Faire letters, shewing eurie Prince his Name, Beneath their feet an iron throne was made, Whereon of lead an Open croune was laid. He thought they set him on the iron Throne, And cround him with that leaden croune in scorne, Whereon was written this Inscription, This non but bastard Baliol hath borne, Then saied the firste and grauest all alone Whose aged haires had many yeares outworne Thou wreched catine most accurst of all Thy place is great but, greater farre thy fall. This Diadem Pointing his Ow'ne by Me Erected was with honor strength and Might And from my Aged loyns discendit be By Iust discent thes Nyntye two in sight Eche bure this Crowne with Royall dignitie Adding as much by Conquiest to ther Right Defending It gainst Romains saxons Dains For witnes famous victories Remains. But vn-compeld vn sought or on requierd By words by warr by Conquest or by gane Thou Randert vp what we aloft had Reard And what we keipt with travell cair and Pane The thretning trompet that all Nati'ons feard Which worlds of Armeis newer could obtaine Yet this thou could not do without consent Of all the Thrie Estates of Parl'ament. But for thy fault, thy shame, thy losse, thy wrong, This iust and heauie Iudgment shall correct thee, The Kingdom shalbe reft from thee e're long And thy owne subjects shamefully rejectt thee, In blinded darknes woes shalbe thy song. For want of daie, yet no man shall affect thee, And to all ages thy Infamous name, Shalbe a prouerbe of eternal shame. For lo Thou shall be cal'd in littill space Thy countreis ruine and thy Nations wo Much harmles Blood shall pay for thy disgrace Theas yet onborne thy Doome shall feill and kno A mightie Nation shall thy land Deface Beneth whois havie yok She grons, but lo She Viper-like brings furth vn nat'rall Brood That most shall waist her, wond her, drink her Blood. At last her tears her Cry's her sad Complaint Shal Pearce the heavins and Iove to Mercie move Who pit is sinners when they first repent And looking Meeklie dounward from above Shall Raise Them vp that shall her wrak prevent Whose manlie Valors shall her woes Remoue And bring to end the warr Thou wroght with shame But neu'r an end to Thy Infamous Name. Therfor this leaden croune, base, worthles, poore, Thou hast as one vnworthy to put on, The croune which I the famous Fergus boore And al these warrlike Princes One, by one, And while this mightie Nation shal indure, Hauing a Prince to sitt vpon my Throne, Thou of a Princes name shalt be refus'd Because my croune vn-conqu'erd thou abu'sd. At these last woords he wak'd with sodain fear, But nothing saw while in his braine was tost, These woful warnings buzing in his eare, That threatn'd was by great King Fergus ghost, Which burthen great his soule could skarsly beare Till moueing, fieling, speach and all was lost, His vitall powers hemd in with thousand cares, At last burst forth in these or like dispaires. O Sad and wearied Soull quod he depairt And leaue the lothed Lodge thou doest posse Stop vp my breath within my lothed heart My life make les if shame may not be les Hev'ne from aboue thy vengence at me Daiert Heel from below thy Torment still Incres Devouring Earth my damned bodie smoother Heav'ne, Earth and hell destroy mee altogither. Thus swallow'd vp of mankind most abhord If any should Inquire for worthles Mee Say that some Rav'ning monster me Devoir'd And let my Name, O? fame forgotten be Let al my day's t'obliu'on be Restoir'd Lest thou O tyme theirwith dishonor thee Thus Rol'd in clouds of smook let it be said That such a One was neu'r fram'd nor made, Thus while he lay half dead for greif and wo A herauld came from Englands mightie king And straitle charg'd him haistelie to go To york and all his princes their to bring And homage dew for Scotlands kingdome sho: Which brought the Nobill's secret murmuring To light at last, and thus they work with all To mak him sie his Error, shame and fall. Saltons great Lord that Abirnethie hicht he had vniustle wrong'd (A huinows thing) Wherfore from him in all his Princes sight He did Apeall vnto the English king: This heigh disgrace he took in great dispight For in Contempt with all it did him bring At last he casts about to right the wrongs That to his Endles Infamie belong's. A message to the English King he send For to discharge that base infamous Band Since he without consent could not pretend Thus for to Slave a frie-vn-conquerd land But too too late Repentance Coms in End Thus shallow with deip Iudgment doth with stand So children vse for to repent their Error When nocht Remains but Punishment and Terror The mighty English rise in dreadfull arms, Still threatning Blood, wrake, ruin, vengeance, sorrow Performing still their vow's with griefs &amp; harms That from their firie wraths new woes did borrow, Faire Fortune towks their Droms with lowd allarm's, And waits on bloodie Mars, from day to morrow, Whose dreadfull Trumpet blow's a deadly blast, And rowls our daie in doulful night at last. First Barwick tane was by a subtil traine Wherein seau'n thousand men of Arms were lost, Wœmen and children pitiles were slaine, None left aliue of Scotish blood cold boast, Now at Dunbar foure Princes did remaine, That had conueind of Scots a mightie hoste, But hate of Baliol such dissention brings, In his dispight they loue their foes design's. Which caus'd a straunge vn-lookt-for long decay For English Edward Marcheing therin haist Encountred them Impatient of Delay Amongst them selfs in wofull factions plast Now Edward Causd mee in his camp to stay For to my loue were most of them addrest So when the armys, ioyning did abyd Twelf thowsand turnd vpon the English syd. This was full sore against my will God knows Nor was I euer privie to this treasson My Deids on Edwards side was but in shows Nor could I disobey him in that Season On no les paine then huntington to lose But ah these foolish Scots had no such Reason Whoe by their new discord struk blind with wrath Wold mak mee cloake vnto their brokin faith. For they vnworthie of the Scottish name Against their Cuntreis friedome Rudlie stand Onworthie also of their Elders fame That gainst them selfs dars lift thair conquering hand When foraigne force could not their stomaks tame Them selfs against them selfs opposd they fand The Sone the father, father kills the sone Eache kills his frend and help's his foe to winne; Such thinges were wrought by heaunes feirce destanye Becaus the land with sinne did overflow Evne as a statelie ship with sails on hie If iustlie poysd with ballance feares no blow Of windes, but if o're chargd with weight she be Her speed is staiy'd impaird her glorious show Then angrie Neptunes foemeing surges beat-her And with decay the thundring tempests threat her Ev'ne so whill as in Scotland did remaine The sword of iustice feare of god aboue The loue of vertue hate of vice profane And whill the sprituall state the treuth did loue We saild in seas of peace and did obtaine Wealth, honor, all which landes most blisd do prove But once borne downe with pride, lust blindnes error Our calmes of peace heavnes tempests shook with terror For mightie God that sittes vpon the throne Of iustice grace and mercie from that hight Did vew our sinnes in burning rage anone His countenance with fyrie flammes grew bright That heavnes did quaek for feare and Angells mone For men poore men at that astonicing sight Dayes glorious lamp, nightes Queene, heavens tapers stay'd Wrapt vp in clowdes at his dread lookes affray'd. Within his wattrie pallace Neptun quaekes The roaring streames were quyet whist and still His azurd crowne from crisped lockes he tackes His monsters all the lower Regions fill His forked scepter then for fear he breakes And to obey his lord and makers wil He myldlie fals before his mercies throne Whoes glorie made the heavnes with lightnings shone The solid earth did quak with trembling feare And downward seemd to change her wonted rowme Such grevous weyght and burdene did she beare Of hynous sinne, whose punishement to come She did forsee as when throw subtel act Dame Thetis foull with Alabastre Downe Fleis downe with wofull plaintes and murnfull cryes Before a dreadfull tempest doeth aryse, The hellishe feindes that scatterd were abroad Through all the earth and for mischeif still soght Reann headlonges downe vnto their greislie god And was through these infernall kingdomes brought Where Proserpin with Pluto grimme abode Whoes rustie scepters were of yron wrought On thrones they sate bout which ferce feinds did rore Two heavie crownes of burning brase they bore. Prodigious signes and wounders then were seene Which did presage what after might befall From the cold North did in our climat shyne A bright and blazing Comet and with all Reid showres of blood in sundrie had beene The last the latest warning of our fall Yet dreadfull signes and fearfull wonders sent Sinne made not lesse but iudgement did augment. Cap. 3. The Argument. Greif haueing som what interrupt the Prince He showes at last his caus of discontent And followes furth with eurie tragick chance Wheir with proud Fortun erst did him present The wittie Count conforteth him and thence Desires him goe where Fergus ghost him sent Wheron they both conclude and with a dreame Sleep drownes discours at last in silence streame. O subiect sad o sad vnsolid Muse In Cypres wreathd in murning blak attyre Blott confort out and in your layes refuse All mirth yea in your wofull task desyre Sad tragick tuns the which while you peruse In Nightes dark Inn's her dreadfull cave retire Tears serve for ink and if you ayme at mirth O sighes let all be smotherd in their brith. But wailing Muse Ay mee why do you sho To outward view the onlie staine of Time? Why in rememb'raunce of such horredwo Do you not weip to wash your wofull Rime? O thry's Infamous! Tims Inglorious! O That this their shame had ended with their Cryme, But hev'n and Time, fate, Fortun, chance and all Had with Them selfs decreed them selfs to fall Where was the Conquering Arm's the valiaunt heart's. Where was wonted Loyltie now gone When for their faith their valor their deserts Oure Elders mounted vp to honors Throne When Rudelie They Opposd their Arm's and Arts In Belgia fair, against this foe alone, Such prais they wan beneth those temp'red Clim's As maks them famous to Eternall Tim's. Indeed such praise and Glorie great they wan As these whoes grevous wrong's they cam to right Ingratelie and Vnnat'rallie began T'Invy thair greatnes and to feare their might How soone their Suord freed them of fo's eu'ne then Of them they make a, Massacre by night And as a sad Remembr'aunce of this Acti'on Scots onlie gwards their king for satisfaction. O had you soght your contreies honor still, As those for honor from theier contrey came. Your golden praise had gilt my rusty quill, And with perfumes, had fir'd my sacred flames, But now my wofull song kinde Eies may fiil With teares, and harts with sorrow for the same, For had the Scots trew to themselues remaind, Long-shanks had not soe great a glory gain'd. But O why am I thus with passion led? For pardon curteous Reader must I sue, Earths brauest Prince wee left within a shade, Who hauing made a period, did renew His woefull historie and thus he saied, Now doth our endles tragedie ensue, The Scots wee left still fighting at Dunbarr, Them-selues against themselues: O cruel warr! The rest of wofull Scoots that did remaine, Perceauing this new losse and sodaine chaunge, They fainted, yet they fought for to obtaine That honour which their fellows did infringe, Each one thus by his second selfe was slaine, While as the English smils at such reuenge, And thus whem nought but death to Scots ensue They yeald to Fortune, not to Valor trew. Now onlie English Edward was Renownd all yeelds to him and to his fortuns Rare He with our Auntient Diadem was Crown'd To him the Princes of the land Repaire Whill Baleoll in seas of sorrows Drownd By english Scots was broght in blak dispair Before great Edward when he did deny All title, Right and soveraguitie, Thus Edward made a conquest of oure crowne And homage did Requyre of all the lande Which sundrie Lords and Princes of Renowne Refus'd nor wold they yeeld to his demand And while the wrathfull heavins lookt mildlie doun They for a space wold flie his vengfull hand Wheirfore two hundreth yeowths he with him led These were the first borne son's of those that fled. Th'Imperiale Treassour hence he did convoy With all the Iewells of oure Diadem Oure antient monuement's he did distroy And from all time to blot the Scottish name He burnt with fyir what ere we did enjoy Wreits, Books and works and to augment our shame The marbill chear oure oldest Monument He reft away wheiron these lyns were pent Ni fallat fætum Scoti, quæcunque Locætum Invenient lapidem, Regnare tenentur Ibidem. If fatall desteines be trew the scots shall find this stone And wheirsoew'r They find the same their they shall Regne allon King Edward thus of all our welth possest And all wheir to we did good Right pretend To eurie toun a garesone addrest And to each Strength his captains did he send And english lords did in the land invest Of those that to his Scepter wold not bend Thus long we leu'd in care in wo and sorrow that alway did augment from day to morrow. In this tyme lew'd a worthie valiant knight Most fortun at who Wallas heght to name Wallas by wit, by valor, fate and might Who Scotland thrise from Bondage did Recleame His coadherent in that cause of right Was that braue Mars of men the val'aunt grhame Both fortunat and famous both wheirby Tho dead They Liue to all Eternitye. Scotland the fourth tyme was in thraldome broght After good Wallas had relev'd it thrice When him betrayde by that accursed thought Of fals Monteith the English did surprise Eu'ne curst manteith by heauin's for vengence wroght By fortun, fate and cruell.

Whoes lawles act, whoeis leud and haetfull name Polluts my virgin vn-polluted ryms Yet theese so calld As faultles I reclaime Thoght I vnfold his neu'r concealed cryms Let them not greive at me nor at his shame If they leiue spotles to Eternall tims I blame the Man but not the lyne discendit The deide but not the name is reprehendit Poore Scotland thus in all calametie While Bondage like ane Earth-quaik Rents the state Assunder quyte, and still oure Infamie Incressing by the Means of priuat hate Oure selfs amongst, oure selfs divided be Which maks this vncouth straunge and new debait Comfussion thus cast doun from heavins above Doth still Increase and can not yet remove. Much I lamented this my cuntries wo And oft desird to remedie the same Till fortun, heau'ns and fate at last did sho A meane to blaze abroad my secret flame To mak the variows wondring world to kno My great desire my Countreis will to frame Yet fortuns frowns on my designe sattendid And hevi'ne was with my rash attempts offendet. The cumin euer Infamous for that crime Of mee a secret Parle did require And thus he said now fortun fits the Time wheirin thy right may to the crowne aspyr The variws mynds beneth this variws clime Do now more stedfastlie them selfs Retire Wissing their curst allegaince now were broke Yet groane they still beneth the English yoke What glorie great the warrlike Scots haue woon, From age, to age, all time can witnesse beare, Scots onely keeps a free vnconquer'd croune, Scots onely gaue the mighty Romans warre, At whom beg'd peace the Romans of renoune? Was't not the valiant Corbred they did feare? Who but the Scots the valiant Pichts subdu'd, And warrlike Danes whose force seau'n times reneud? But we, eu'ne wee degenerat and bare, Doe challenge yet from them our blood, our being Tho prostitute to infamie and care, Our selues eu'ne with our selues still disagreeing, For courage, feare, for worth &amp; wit dispaire, To vice inclining still, from vertue flying, Thus haue wee made ourselues a woful praie. Vnto our Foe (ne're siene before this day) Where is becom our Elders vallerous harts? Their deeds, their virtue, and their conquering sword, Their dignities, their office, place &amp; parts, Their victories with Monuments decoird, Their auntient Armes woone by their braue deserts? Can these noe good, noe strength, noe wit afford? No no I sie wee faint, wee feare, wee fall, From honour, Greatnes Libertie and all. Yet that we may at their desertes but aime, As those who shold inherit them by right, Rise thou in Armes, thy right for to reclaime, My selfe, my power, my strength and all my might, Shall follow thee my race and all my name, Shall with Victorious Armes maintane the fight, Giue me thy lande, but when the Crown is thine Or for thy right therof Receaue thou mine. Soone to these sugred words I did accord And then betuixt vs two a band was made That when I to the Crowne should be restord Assisted their to by the Cumins Aide The Cumin then of Cartik should be Lord This don we both Reioisd and both seimd glad But loe, the Cumin traitrouslie repented Ew'n to his endeles Infamie lamented. To Englands mightie King the band he send Declairing how that I him would betray Whoe gravelie did advise their with in end I soone was chairg'd to court without delay At mee the King requird if that I kend That band and seall yet did I not dismay But framd my countenance more bold and stout Offe'ring on morrow nixt to cleir the dout My Patrimony for a pledge I left And after to my Innis reteird Anone Our Hemisphere of day was then bereft Whill night spred fourth her sabel wings alone Such fearfull darknes ou'r the Earth she wef't As seimd to say in friendschip now begone Thus secreitlie alone I took my flight Helped by Joue and by the freindlie night. Five Tyms had Hesper Titan warn'd away Five tyms agane did Lucifer Apeir Wiueing the glorious standard of the Day On tops of Touring clouds reid, whit and cleir And cheng'd their sabel hew to siluer gray When fyre Steids the golden carr drew neir Whill sullen night in towny sutes addrest Did schrink abak and shrewd her in the west. When as I then Arriu'd like Fortuns knight Within the confins of oure kingdome old Then presentlie appeard vnto my sight Two valiant knights stout, hardie, fearce and bold The one wherof my brother Edward hight The vther fleiming vnto those I told Cumins deceat and how by heau'ns revenger I had escaip'd so imminent a danger. Thus tallked wee and thus along we pas Till by good hap a Messinger we met Who after streat Inquerie did confes He was vpone a secreat Message set To Englands King for Cumins busines Whose letters did requyre the King to let Mee soone by death from my revolting Mind Els Scots to mee shold shorthie be enclind. Wheir Cumin was we vrgd him to declair Within the Cloister of Drumfreice quod he Thither with restles speid we did repair. And in the Church he seimd devotiuslie To kneile, for as he sat, we kild him their The which I fear his caus'd my miserie For that Jov's sacred hous we thus defild Rashlie with his sin gultie blood so wild. Then was I soone receau'd of al as King And on my head I weere the Crowne alone I did a great and mightie Armie bring To rais my state cast doun from honors Throne In whose brave strength good hope I had to wring The reull from Edwards hand and Marching on With dreadfull Terror on the trembling Earth I pitcht my Tents before the Wall's of Pearth. Whill thus I did my rightfull Claime beginn With warrs sterne shok and Trumpets dreidfull blast My kingdome by victorious Arm's to winn Trew Scots with my Jmperiall standart past The Scots arms a lion.The Lion fierce a feild of Gold within Which seimd throw th'air agrumling Noise to cast Whose Chaine thus brok made mightie Edward quake Fearing much blood wold hot his Fuerie slake But then eu'ne then began my Endles caire My sorrou's great my wo my wrack and all Proud fortun then did all Her frouns prepair Wheirwith she ever siince my hairt do'th gall For then she broght mee with a wondrous snair My Jnfamie my wrak my los and fall A Period long heir made the wofull king Sob's from his Breist send secreit Murmwring Yet in the sad confussioun of his mind This too too sad a Tragedie he 3told Within the towne of Perth then did we find The English armie with their Captane bold My Sold'ours harts to Battel all inclind Oft darr'd them forth with bravads from their hold But they nor we in warr more wys and warrie Knew by what means to make vs all miscarie.

Then chusing furth aduantage of the Ground Neu'r doubting that he wold his word infrenge Made all my Camp that eirst no rest had found Refresh them selfs in hope of blest revenge Thus all at rest when eche was sleiping sound No reest I got (and which was yet more strainge A kynd of vncouth fear assaild my heart I neids wold ryis and furth I walk'd aparte, Now was't about the dead hour of the night While as the Watch in heavie sleip didly When noys of neighing horssis heare I might And throgh the Air men's voices sound neir by I stood amazd till Phebe with her light Piteit my cause and made me to discry A mightie Armie Marching hard at hand As many thryse as those I did command. I caus'd to sound allarum presentlie Which made them with a showt to hast their pace And with their Drums and Trumpets roaring cry They make a sadd and dreadfull noyse allas Fyve hundreth of my Camp no more had I Yea those half arm'd with faintnes fear Embrase The rest were sleiping kild some fled along For lo oure foes wer tuentie thousand strong. And nat'rall Scots the greatest parte of those Natural said I no most vnnatrall rather For these ew'ne these were still oure greatest foes Most Viper-like and worsh then Vipers ether For vs at last They forst, Much ground to lose Freind gainst his freind the Sone against the father I stay'd behind their furie to gainestand Till softlie thence reteir'd my mangled band. As Hunters keen that douth a parke enclose To take or slay the staige Deir, hynd or hart So were we now en compast by our foes Six and my self the rest were fled a heart The randell was ane of the six.All which wer tane thought honor none did lose Eache hardie bold eache bare a valiant part Yet I escap'd out through these Squadron's strong So del't my fate to work my greater wrong, Nor was proud fortune thus suffeisd at al With those misluks and these my greuous mo'ns Triumphing on my shame my fate my fall And heaping on a thousand wo's at onc'e But when my brok'ne force I did recall Vniting them for new Invasions I fand seuen tyms as many mo had left me As my fearce foes revenging sword bereft me. And yet with those all hopeles hartles faint I forc't was to the Montans for to flie Wheir nothing els but penurie did hant Much trauel paine and sorow suffred we Yet none at all did pitie this oure want Tho we abode for them this miserie And which was wors this Terror did enseue Ev'ne native Scots did most oure liu's persue Ev'ne native Scots my life persew'd indeid Altho for them this task I vndergo Their welth to winn broght all my want my neid Yet for my Love, dispight, and hate they sho And this my love did so all bounds exceid I made my freind my foe; becaus their foe Yet whill I seik Their honor wealth and ease They seik my death my fall this To with Edward King of England. foe to pleas, Like to that fishe the mightie Whale doth gu'ide From craggie Rocks and shallows throw the Deip In the waist bosome of the Occeane wide The Whale her brood wold fain devoure to keip Her self aliue, and yet she stealls aside When she espy's the Monster rest or sleip Brings forth her brood with care to keip them frie But they doe her devour Immediatlie So fair's with mee that cait's to keip alive My Natioun frie from mightie Edwards Iaw's The greater pairt of my owne subiects strive Who shall devoit mee first with tearing Paw's For lo when to the Montain's I arive Left of my owne and left without a cause The lord of Lorne a mightie armie bring's The Lord of loirne his armie was abowe fyve thousand. To bring my self to end with my design's. Of all my Armie was five hundreth left That took a pairt with mee in weile and wo Which Number few of strength was clene bereft For pining Famein had opprest them so In their paill Face was pailler death ingraft Vpon their wereid lims they fanting go Yet curage did their weikned strength renew And willinglie they wish the fight t'insew, Thrice they their fo'es with woundrous strength assaild And thrice agane their deing forces spent Thrie tyms with matchles valor they prevaild Thrie tyms their foes their Number did augment Yea which is most of all to be bewaild Oure foes tho ten too one did still prevent Oure victorie with fresh and new suppleis, For one cum's in still, as ane other deis. At last their forces did so much abound That we're encompasd in on eu'rie syde Whill as dark night ou'r shaddow't all the ground As piteing vs whill she our lose espyde Thrie hundreth lost of my best Knights I found The rest sore wounded fighting still abide Nor wold they once be tane or yeeld or flie But wold their blood revenge and fighting die. Yet when I causd to sound a sad Retreat They hewd a passage throw these Squadrons strong Still fighting they Reteir and still their date With valors endles praise thay do prolong At last they entred all a narrow streat On each side streatch'd a mounting rock a long When I by Fortun last of all did stand Them to restraine that wold oure lyves demand. Thrie Knights was their mee by my armour knew And were suborn'd before my life to take Who seing mee allone did fast persew Two lights theirby aduantage for to make The thrid befoir me did the fight renew Whill they mount vp the crags and wins my bak Thus was I sore assaild on ew'rie side But mightie Ioue my saiftie did provide. I did of Uictorie almost dispair But Iove, hev'ne fate and fortun wild not so To end my wrack my miserie my care Preserving me to greater shame and wo To fight whill as the formest did prepair It was my luke to kill him with a blo The one a foot essay'd with mightie force By my one leg to pull me from my horse. And in the Stirro'p thrust all his arme weel nye The third leapt vp vpone my hors behind And thrust his dagger in my side awry Whill as the vther draw's me to the ground But in the Stir'p his arme so bruzed I And with his heills my hors such way has found That he the vse of feit had quyte bereft him Then I cut of his arme and so I left him. But now the third that all this time allone Was siurlie set behind me on my hors Did wound me thrice altho not mortall one Whome in my arms at last I straind by force And on my hors befoir I laid him on The dagger then wheirwith he wroght my losse I made to digg a passage throw his hearte And thence his Cursed Soul did sone departe. Thus fred of all my foes and frie from danger For all the rest did long before reteir I wandred throgh the Desart like a stranger And of my mangled Band no news could heire So dois a Shipheard sad and wofull rainger That holds the Wolf in chace till night draw neir Then to his flleecie flock returneth back But of their fearfull flight has lost the tracke. At last when I a forrest did espy Grim night look't furth with greislie countenance Her smookie breath in duskie clouds doth flie From her paill lip's, and darkned heavins bright glance Ou'r vailling all the earth and azur Sea With shaddow's dim that dreadfull sights aduance I stray'd a fortnight in this wood vnsterv'd Roots herbs and water still my life preserv'd. Wearie at last with feant nes all possest Amongst the Flowrs I layd me doun to prove If my sore wearid Soull could find some rest Since daeth did scorne my wois for to remove Neir wheir I lay from mightie Roks increst A siluer Brook doun tumbling from above With cheirling Murmurs sweit and dulceit sounds Whose Echo from a hollow Pit redounds. The treis about me Arbour like did grow With bushie topps and tender twists aloft Whilst Zephyres milde sweit gentle breath did blow The leav's with muttring made a murmor oft That with the bubling of the streame below Had Rock'd my senses in a slumber soft Whill as my Spreit was trubled from above Straunge Aparitions in my Soull did move. Mee thought great Fergus did before mee stand With ghostlie looks with fearce and angrie cheir I hard his voice like thunder to demand A compt most sharp of all my labors heir So great a task as thow has taine in hand With greater pains quod he thy Ioys must cleir Vp then arise this life wold blot thy fame And shuld redound to thy Eternall shame, In the waiste bosom of the western laike Of Albion neir Jrish montains hore Neptune a pene Jnsula doth make Stretching his azure arms along the shore Their must thow all thy sorrows quite forsaik And comfort find for all thy greifs of yore Vp then with speid I say and thither go Wheir thow Jov's will and Mercie both shall kno. This said through Shaiples air he went away I suddantlie awak't and was agast Yet weyghing weill the sentence he did say I soght my hors in haste and thence I past When as I traveld had but half a day Within that Valey I arriv'd at last Wheir yow I fand thus may yow sie with all How greate misfortuns works my greater fall. Then quod the Douglass Sir I yow desire Forget these passions straunge, too straung alace Since Fortune now shall change her sad attire And ever after look with cheirfull face An hard beginning to an end aspire Of ewerlasting happines and grace The mightie minds to honor still repare Throw rare difficulties and daungers rare. Wheir Fergus Ghost directs their must yow go Winter draws neir heir must yow noght abide Their havin's your fortune fait shall to yow sho Eu'ne vnto yow and all the world beside In these and suche like speaches past these two The longsome night till Morpheus provide For drowsie flight, who ou'r the Earth soone past And lights on them with lazie wings at last. When nights swift cours with silence was outworne She givs a kinde fairweill vnto the day The wing'd Musitians which awake the morne With hollow throts and horned bills did play The Nightingale whose Musik Match dooth scorne The Maues that throw Forrest Echois ay The lark that warns the craftsmen of their paine And laborers that daylie toyll for gaine. Eu'n as a Man in sleip that seems to heare Of Instruments and song a hevn'lie sound To them in sleepe such sounds did now appeare Their Soulls transported were when Ioys abound They hard the Ængells heav'nlie Musick cleir In Paradise it seemd them selfs they found Cloy'd whill they walk throw groves of all delight Sweit to the smell and plesant to the sight. And in this pleasant Slumber whill they lay This fetherd Crue with their enchanting sound Above them on the tender twists do play Wheir Musicks weilset descant did abound When in the east arois the glorious day His crisped loks in siluer Cisterns drownd Waueing his golden vaill bright poure and cleir Wheir throw the clouds like crimsone flams apeir. Caput. 4. The Argument. The Bruce dispersed host their Lord doeth know Who to Kintyre reteirs and their doeth sie An aged Syre that vnto him doeth show The heauenlie constullations curiouslie And his blesd race and princelie stemm doeth draw From these rair purtrates in the heauens that be He showes eche Prince and doeth the lyne aduance To that fair matchles Douager of France. Soft now my Muse and do not sore to hye Waed not in curious questiones too deep Let thy pure ground be trueth and veritie And learne the cheefest pointe's &amp; heads to keep Altho thou somtyme wantonize awry To recreat thy self yet softlie creep So neir the treuth as none may heare nor se To taint the chastest eare nor sharpest eye. The chyld doeth learne his lessone euerie day Yet play doeth oftin recreat his Sprite play sharpes th ingyne makes pregnant witt's they say After long studie honest mirth is meet The purest trueth doeth harshslie rune away But sau'cd with Parnass streames it sounds more sweet The strength es stomak waek and wanting power With sugar sweet accepts a portion sover. Whill Bruce and Douglas sleepes and dreames of toyes That in their moystned braine impression makes Evne as the Day comes in they heare a noyes A noyes that suddanelye them both awakes Yet makes them both therafter to reioyse And greif's sad vale from their sharp eyes it shaekes For heaune blissd Bruce was so with patience cround Adversitie his mynd could neuer wound. Altho he gravelie did vnfold his ill Vnto the valiant Count his woes bewaeling Yet with a constant minde he actes them still His cheerfull lookes and words so muche prevailling As in their heartes all thought of feare did kill And winnes their love their curage still appealling Who were his followers in eche wofull fight And could no danger feare if in his sight. Which made them all way vp and doun to rainge Throw desarts Montains plains and Forrests hore Bewailling their hard lots and fortuns strainge Their want of food, but want of him much more They did lament: and in this wofull chainge They sweare to venge his death or die theirfore For sure they thoght he by mishap did stray Amongst his foes when night did parte the fray Now were they come neir to the grove wheir ho And Douglas slumberd soundlie in a dreme Who both awaekt rush'd furt he and streight they sie An armed man the King knew weill his name whome when he cald the rest did quicklie flie Furth through the groves; some feares, and some thinkes shame Yet loue and ioie recald them all at last Before his feit them selfes they humblie cast. So haue I fiene a moore-hen in the spring Missing her tender Brood throw desearts straying She in her throat some chirping nots doth sing Which when they heare with naturall loue repaying Her kyndlie cair in haist them selfs they bring And floks about her all her will obeying She seims right glad to sie her yung ones so Scap'd from the Daunger of their rawning foe When he vnlac'd his burnishd helme of gold His milde, Sueit, manlie countenance they knew Vertue and Grace diuyne they might behold Like Phebus beams from his fair looks t'ensew As Phebus draw's the dew vp from the mold His eies their hearts so from their bosoms drew Before him still vpone their kneis they fall To gratious hea'uens they render thankes for all He thankes them for their faith their trueth their love And to eche man did seuerall favores sho Soone after they from thence did all remove And westward to Dumberton glaedlie go From thence great Neptunes freindship wold they prove And th'Oceans watrie force they neids wold kno Shipd for Kyntire fleing the wind before Ere morrow nixt they saiflie came to shore. The king his men in throgh the cuntrie sent With them the Errl of lennox for their Lord An vther way he with the Douglas went To sie what fauour fortuon wold affoord They trawelling allong with this Intent At last their way them to a wod restord Wheir half a myill at most they had not riddin When both to ryd one way were thus forbiddin. Two vglie monstruos wolfs they might espy Had kild a harte and on the same was feiding Eche choosd a wolf his hors swift Paise to try For Boare-spears serud their launce in this proceeding Eche wolf his follower leads a sundrie way Their eger chase and ther persuit deriding What fortun hevins for Douglas had apointed We'll after show, now to the Lords anointed I mean the Bruce that brave and valiant Prince Who with an egger mind perseu'd the chace The wolf had left the wood and for defence Vnto a mighte Rock he rins a pace Breathles he seimd so slowlie runing thence As made the Prince hope weill to winne the race He quyts his horse rins vp the Rock in haiste But soone he loste the sight of whome he chaist His trevell lost he wold returne o're night Yet anye where to ryid he doeth not knoe The Rock he seis of such a wondrous hight As all the countrey round about would show Vp then he goes to view so fair a sight Whill he ascends the sone discendet low But e're he could vnto the top attaine Night spreds her painted vaile o're all the plaine. In heavns heighe court the lampes all lighted shynes Which him constraind to searche some place of rest The montaines top was deckt with oakes and pynes Where nature hade a garden rairlie drest With fontanes walkes and groves without ingynes Of arte: yet seemd of artes best skill poseest But sad it seemd to Nightes sad shad inclyning Showne to the Prince by Phæbes feble shyning. At last arryving by a fontane syid Beneath a leavie aged oak he lyes A heartie draught of the cold streame he tryed Which for a daintie maill did him suffice And now his cogitation deeplie weyghed Earthes glorie vane and wordlie fantasies Compairing all beneath heavns syluer boures.

A dark gray clowde past furthe o're all the air But nightes pale Qveene cleird all the heavns at last When to him did an old grave man repair Whoes head and beard had youthes freshe cullor past A cristall glob his trembling hand vpbeare Where heavne o're earth did move from east to west Their starres and planets shynd most bright and cleir Which by a sprit was mov'd as might appeare. A Spherik glob within hung lyk a ball That figurd rairhe furth the earth and sea Which round about was frie from heavns cleir wall Whose restles course round o're this glob did flie The glassie sea now calme then seemd to swell Where wind-tost shipes with tydes and tempests be Whill Neptunes azurd armes the earth embraceth That cirquits yles and shore from shore vnlaceth.

Vnto the Prince this aged Syre drew neir Whill chast Diana shynd more fair and bright Cled in a horye mantle white and cleir He seemd devote in prayers to spend the night Leane flesh'd, his wattrie blood sweld vaines appeir His ghostlie lookes still offerd death his right Whoe pausing long with stedfast staering eyes This salutation did at last devyse. Peace be to thee my Lord and Prince sayd he Whom great and mightie Ioue has hither sent That thow might kno his mercies great by me And of thy bad and by past life repent The shame the foyle the losse that falles to thee Is Ioues iust doome because thow gave consent.

Caput. 6. The Argument. By Fortune Valor and aduentrous chance The Douglas doth releiue thrie Scottish Dames In Arrans Ile and doth from thence aduance Whill hee is brunt with loues Insulting flames Yet showes he that on Mars not Cupide launce Glorie prouids to hing triumphand Palmes He finds his Lord to Scotland whoe returns And Turnberrie he sacks distroys and burns. Now may you think that I haue lost the sight Of Douglas and forgot his warlick deids Whoe still persues his chaise till Sable nighte To saiue her frend &amp; end his game furth speids Then from his weill spurd hors he doth alight To rest till heauns smyld on Apollos steids But long he rests not when he hears a noyse Confus'dlie Iarring with a weiping voyce. He taks his hors and their in haist doth ride Wheir as him thoght he hard the wofull sound By Phebœs sight at last he hes espi'de On horse some fiftie knights whoe led fast bound Fiue knights thrie Ladeis all behind them tyed Vpon their horse the knights from many a wound Dyit the grein grase in reid that seemd to call For dread reuenge shewing the way with all. Hee follous still but lo they ride so fast That they by this had gottin to the shore Theis war his frends.And in a Tall schip soone from thence thay past He seis Sextein in arms their him before That them persew'd with those he gois at last Vnto a Bairge oft wissing to restore To libertie those poore distressed wights The wofull Ladeis and the woundit knights, Theis englishmen whom they folowit was keipers of the castell of breithwick in arran.Now these were led he met vpon the shore By one Sir Robert Boyd a val'aunt knight They from the Armie stray'd not long before When on thrie Gentlemen thay hap't to light Whoe them besoght to aid them to restore Thrie Ladeis tane by crewell English might And comeing neir to Arren they conclude With Douglas onlye forto spend their blood. Wheirfore he causd them presentlie to land In haist to get betuixt them and their hold Which straight was doune o happie they that fand So braue a Guide Wise hardie fearles Bold In whoes myld look in whoes all conqu'ring hand They Victorie alreddie might behold Now were they to the Castell neir hand by Wheir all in secreit they did cloislie ly By then the Englishe to the shore had brought Their Prisoners but all their wealth and store Within their Schip they left which all for noght From merchands schips they had bereft of yore And now straight to the Castell when thay soght The Douglas gius the signe and steps before His warlickrout and with his sword and sheild He cuts a bloodie way out throgh the feild. Thus in a raige furth throgh his foes he dreue Whoes virtuos valor thrists for gloreis croune With eurie blow a soull bids earth adew Their new array he breaks their ranks beat doune So many sheilds he cleif't and knights our threw That too much Ualor hindred much renoune For lo a wall of bodeis deid he layid Wheirof the rest in neid a Rampere made. Transported thus with heat with wraeth and Ire Now heir now their he wofull Slaughter's wroght Astonisht then some did with feare retire Yet some for shame stikx to't amazde in thoght Vthers that scornd such wounders to admire Vou's dread reuenge and on him still they soght Yet those that foolls were thoght did wiselie flie And those that wiselie stays like fools they die. Whill he not weried thus with killing fights Their Captane stout that Hastings heght to name Furth from the Castell cums with twentie knights Whoes freshe supplies with furie most extreame Beats doun their foes and stays eu'ne in their sights Fair Victorie with glorie prais and fame That cround was cum and smyld on them before But now [illeg.] and threats the[illeg.].

In their warme blood his heat so oft renew'd That now they first did flie whoe first persew'd. Thus rairlie chang'd the fortune of the broyll Hastings with threats manace them still that flie And now in equall ballance stood the toyll Ah heauins yow feble Soldiors said hee Shall yow almost a hundreth haue the foyll Of but few more, then half a scoir yow sie Ah shame you euer hence the name to beare Of English so victorious in weare. This said hee gaizd and staring round about At last he flees with fierce and angrie look Furth throw the throng against the douglas stout A stiffsteill pointed dairt he stronglie schook And as an bow an arrow swift schoots out Singing throghe air such sounding aire it took Whill as the hardie fearles knight opposd. His sheild against all daungers on disclosd. This straunge and mightie throw peirst douglas scheild And in his armour stayed which queiklie done The warlick douglas doeth the wapin weild And gaue his foe no leasure for to schune Gainst whoes strong arme his arms could be no beild Quyte through his right syde past it too too soone For at his heart he aymd yit forcd him fal Which doeth abate the curage of them all. Loue sorrow feare threu furth confution fast Yet quicklie they resolue and in their fray Taks vp their wounded Lord and thence they past Yea soorlie this had bein their laitest day But nights dark schaids betwene them slipt at last And forst them both a syd their arms to lay For if heauns cheirful lamp had biddin in The val'annt douglase force the towre had winn. Now they the wofull Prisoners vntye'd Whoe fell with humble reverence on the ground Praising almightie Joue whoe did provide The douglas that their way to saftie found When he the ladeis Beauties weill espy'd He wondred what wyld sauage wold haue bound Their ming[illeg.]d bodies with their daintie hands Fitter for arms imbrace then iron bands. For their neat bodies-daintie sweit and rare Was exquiseit and excellent he thoght That eune almost his martiall mynd, all care Of Arms forgot and loues delight he soght The youngests beutie did his thoghtes Insnare Her face, Eies, hair, her all, by nature wroght, Was in the rarest and the finest Mold That heart could wishe, hand touch or eie behold, But now becaus the Night was waxing dark He did from thence vnto the shore reteir Wheir they at anker fand the English bark Which they of all resistants soone did cleir And lancing from the shore they did remark What store of wins they had what daintie cheir And as ther former task greate Praise obtaind So by the last a woundrous wealth they gaind. With dainteis cloi'd at last they go to rest And setts their weatch but lo no rest at all The Douglas finds loue did him so molest Now he's becom inchanting beauteis thrall Loth was he that his loue should be possest By one to whom he was a debter small And by her changeing passiouns sore it seimde That she of late sum knight had much asteimd. But that you may the treuth more cleirlie kno Thrie sisters borne were these fair ladeis thrie Their noble syir of children had no mo Great was his wealth his house and linnage hie His reueneus he whollie did bestow On those thrie ladeis yet did thus forsie To giue the yongest whom he most afected The better half whoes worth he most respected. All thrie to their old Syir suche reuerence boore And eche to vther had suche mutuall loue As still his pleasure was their pleasure sure His will they did with willing minds approue A braue yung knight the yungest wold procure In mareage and still his soote did moue Whom she did nather loue nor hait outright Sir Andrew Murray heght this valiant knight Those ladeis chanc'd one day abroad to go To Neptuns sandie shore for their delight With whom this knight went foorth and tuentie mo No Armour but a sword had eurie knight It chanc'd eune then hard by a crag belo Those English came a shore whoes suddant sight Putts those poore ladeis in so greate a fray That they obtaind a ritch yet esie pray. Murray long time the ladeis did defend With cheirfull words encuraging the rest But lo their was no saiftie for in end Fiftein their dyit the remander, possest As presoners they hold and then extend Their wreth which in that land their walth increst At last they fled with shame and withrebook These folloud thame whom Douglas overtook. And onlie by this warlick Erlls brave hand Warre they repaid of all their former wrong Amongst the rest of Prisoners he fand This Murray who had looud this ladie long All this the valiaunt erll did vnderstand Informd by conferrence the rest among And thoght indeid he loued that gallant knight Yet in the ladie was his cheif delight. Now on the seas they stray a certane space Till on a night the count that silent lay Vpone his bed did heare one cry allace Will thus my ladie all my hope betray is my long loue rewardit with disgrace Ah greif allace what will the world now say On wings of hope I mount aboue my might And now am forst with Phaeton to light. Ah who so seids on wemens double wordes Runs with a straingeling Toue to meit dispare Who kyndnes to their wantoun looks affoords Heaps on them self a hell of endles care Who to her smills applies Loues sweit concords With scorne and shame they shall their thoghts insnare Yea whoe vpone a Womans voues shal dreame Can neu'r be red of woe, greif, cair and shame But I must loue her I must loue her still And loueing her eune loving I must die Or shall I leiue my freindly foe to kill That thus deprius my hops, O no not I, I will my verie soule in tears distill, In sighs consume my heart, with groans Iyll ty, On willing death vnto my torterd mynd, And with all pains, end to one paine shall find, Thogh this disdaind disgrat'd and quyte forlorne Yet her poore soule eu'ne her I can not blame But fortune proud that to this knight hath sworns Ou'r all the Earth she will extoll his name And nature that did weip when he was borne For all her wealth hangs at his virteus beame Yea she in him her self excells so fare Compaerd with him all vthers she douth marre. Ah thrise vnhappie I that eu'r did yeeld As Prisoner vnto the english foe Thrise happie I, if slaine into the feild Then had she piteid if not lou'd I kno But o this knight did with his sword and scheild Frie me from bands and yet he fred me so As giving life and sauing this my Breath, He sends to me a farr more cruell death Heir sorow cuts his sad discours at last With manie greuous groans, with sighs and tear's Whereat this warlick Lord was much agast When as this wofull song had perst his Ears His ladeis loue all other caer's surpast Her diuine shape graft in his mind he bear's And yet he thinks he wrongs that worthie knight Whoes faithful loue long since made knowne his right. Wheirfore in time hee wold command these fitts And loues fond flammig passiouns wold remoue But o commanding in his heart she sitts Ruelling the motionis of his soule aboue It wold him kill or neir destraught of witts If he the meanest thoght of lose shuold proue Yet streght he thinks with reasone man's Indeut That by him self his lusts might be subduet Thus tossing thousand, Passions in his mynd At last he vouis him self for to command Now Phebus had his golden locks vntwind And them in Thetis cristall glas vpband When cuttinge Neptouns back a fare they find Thrie warlike ships come toward them from land Wheirfore in Arms each one them self addrest And at their Lords deuotion then they rest. Now all of them did in his presence stand And furth he cau'sd the ladeis to be broght And thus said hee fair Dames yow vnderstand What I and these most valiant men haue wroght By Ioue his onlie, aide we took in hand Your honors saftie your releif we soght Tho Heauins did fauor this our interprise Yow know it was more desperat then wise. And thogh all knights indeid should Armour beare For ladeis and in their defence to feght Yet I more shameles then the rest I feare Of you fair Eue for so the yungest heght Wold craue reward which you may weill forbeare Yea I wold haue your oth in all their sight That what I charge you with you will obey Nor what I seik may you offend I pray. The modest Baishfull dame in silent mood Her mild swit looks she bent vpon the ground Throgh sone bright beautie shind her crimsone blood Which suddain Tempest past she quiklie found This answer (whill the Gallant trembling stood Expecting that which his poore Soule shold wound) Curst be the child his Dame ganesayis in Oght, Whoe his deir life with her lifes hasard boght. Glade was she for to grant what eu'r he wold Whoe wold to him haue geu'ne her self and all Wheirfore againe she made this answer bold, Braue knight your will I promesse and I shall (Myne honor saiff) performe so shall you hold My fate cume life or death or what you call To which my grant I heir the heauns attest, Let me be plagd if I refuse the rest. A shiuring cold throgh all his Vains, forth-went Stopping the Organe of his speache a space To what he wold he should nocht giue consent And what he should he wold noght that imbrace Proud Cupid from her firie looks foorth-sent Loue burning dairts that more and more incres His thoghts at last he thinks his oune he'll make her Her heart fleis throgh her eies and prays him take her. And whill he goes within hes arms to catche her Casting his Eie aside he their espyis Her faithfull knight who all this time did watche her Loue, Furie, Wrathe, Disdain, a combat tries A stryffe betwix the passions of the mynd and ressone. In his sad looks and Rage bids still dispatch her But blak Dispair did thus to him deuis More honor is't thy self to Saccrefies And tell disloyall her thou loyall dyes. So shalt thou end thy els eu'r endles paine And die with honor to her endles shame No take his life quod Jelosie againe Quod reasone why he does not bear her blame Quod Curage shall hee vn-reprou'd obtaine Then thou no man much les a knight by name Quod Reasone if he die she hate thee shall Then quod Despair kill Him, her thee and all. But reasone says and Pitie taks her parte O will thou kill thy Natiouns lamp of light No rather go to him with all thy hearte And giue him all thy intrest all thy right So shall thou winn great praise and heighe desart Quod Beautie first depriue thine Eies of sight No then quod Loue thy heart first must thou tear Foorth from thy breist for her Jdea's their. Which is the starr that reulls thy life thow knois Whill he thus reuld with Iaring passions stands Sad pitie mou'd this braue yung erle mak chois Beautie to flie and brak loues mightie bands And thus he said if heau'ne will that wee lose And that those pirats get ws in their hands No torment shall sufficientlie assuage Their cruell will their furie and their rage So gladlie wold they wish reuenge to tak Of fourtie which we last of theirs did kill Wounding their Lord tho we but few did laik But so Eternall Maiestie did will Now theirfoir first I wish you to forsake Our companie let hap ws good or Ill And tak those knights which heir on you attend Those shall with you home to your counttie wend. And in the light swift sailling Bairge yow may Be out of reache or these oure foes cum neir But this is it I will you to obey Which of your heauins sworne oath sall mak you cleir That presentlie you tak without delay Braue murray for your Knight and husband deir Tho I my self yow to my self could wish If to my taste were tyed no other dish.

Till this sharp threatning storme be our bloune Or els I surlie were to much to blame Yea and the like goodwill the test hath shoune But none wold he accept nor none wold name Except braue Boyd in fates of arms weill knowne And with him ten bold fearles full of fame But eue thus gone proud loue must neids obey She deis for greif braue Murray murnes for ay. Our gallant Earll the sight abids by sea And verye long in fearfull hazard stands At last he winns and Sinks one of the thrie And mightelie the vther two demands To yeild, till both in end ar forc'd to flie By the approache furth from the western lands Of one new fleit eu'ne quikle riggid forth By Bruce that famous Prince and full of worth Whoe glad was Douglas thus againe to find Whose lose with wondrous care he oft lamented All what the Prophet had to him divind He told him there whoe therof much contented Praisis almightie Ioue with thankfull mynd Now that their foes might quicklie be preuented The King his armie their wold set on shore To witi[illeg.] Carrik Wheir persie reul't and hee was Lord before. Two tyms heauns glorious golden Post had past Mesuring the boundles bounds of all the skie When Auster to the shore their fleit had chast With cheirfull shoutes eche one a land did flie With thundring sounds of Trumpets interlaist They rear aloft the royall standart hy Wheir as the princelie Lion in his Iaus Wold so's intombe assunder torne with Paus. Their Tents they Pitch doun in a pleasant plaine Whill their glade rumor throgh the land aroise Freshe troups from eche pairt to them fleis amaine All wishd to shak ye yok of their proud foes Braue Eduard hear's his brother's come againe To him he with a gallant troup forth goes This dantles Prince so fearce was and so bold He thretning Fortun by the hair did hold. Now oure great King a Nece had neir hand by A Ladie full of wisdome wealth and worth Who marchis to the Camp Maiestiklie To view her Royall Cusing cam she forth And with her broght a gallant companie In Arms, dreid Mars the Lord was of their birth Into his Warrs those knights she did conuoy Hee thanks her, her he intertains with Ioy, She vnto him those sad misfortouns told That by mischance had chanc'd since he departed How his fair Queene to his proud foe was sold His brother Neill and Mares greate Earll had smarted Kindrimme also woon, and how that hold By filthie treasone brint was, she imparted And how his greatest foe King Eduart dyit Whoes sone young Eduard now his place supplyit Throgh all the Camp these rumors sadlie goes Of these misfortouns that eche one abased For all doth ade these new mislucks to thoes That had so much before their fames defaced Their Prince that seis their curage now they lose And for trew worth hade frantik fear embraced Causd bring them all before his royall throne And wiselie thus encorag'd eurie one. Braue gallant freinds with mee that haue remaind Against so many fearfull dangers past, So many painfull trauells that sustaind Nor from your necks my yock for want wold cast Of hunger thrist and lose you neu'r complaind Nor nothing could your noble mynds agast Thogh fortune thus hath smyld vpon our foes Shall we of feare and not of fame make chois? No no the Lord forbid we should refuse This warr so iust wheirto we all ar borne Tho conquest with our foes soe long doth vse And our poore wofull cuntrie seimes forlorne It is not destenie but Sinns abuse Not man but God that hath oure cuntrie torne That wee may euill and sin and pride reiect And with repentance murne for our defecte. Yea if wee do with sad repentaunce murne No doubt but his sweit merceis he'el extend His loue and fauor bak he will returne So hard beginings haue an happie end Our foes hee will consume distroy and burne So it fell furth sone after.To cruell them hee this rewerd shal send That when wee haue triumphd on their decay Them selfs shall be vnto them selfs a pray. Thus endit his Prophetik speach devine Which breathing life in their dead hope they leiue His countenance with lightning seimd to shine From his bright looks did courage them reuiue And humbled all befoir Joues sacred shrine With fasts and Prayr these starrie walls they cleiue Before the Lord them selfs they humblie lay With brokin hearts and weiping soules they pray The King and all his Princes of estate Of Godlines and faith ensampills be With fasting publike prayr and sins regrait The one eternall euerlasting thrie They do beseich to Pardon them ingrait And vieu with mercie this their miserie Thus they inuoek and from the Lord aboue On them discends grace, mercie conquest, loue. Now whill they broght their solemm fast to end And holie vous vnto the lord had made To turnberry their haistie course they bend It wold they first besige and first invade Which toun the warlick Perse did defend Within the castell strong him self abade By warlick bruce inuirond so about That noght but feare getts in and curage out. So suddantlie so vnawars They came That they no time had left vnto them so Their towne to victuall or their strenghts to frame Them to defend or to offend their foe No rolling forc no Ingine nor no ram Oure Gallants soght the walls to overthro By force hee enters at the first essay And to his armie giu's it as a prey But still the Persie did the castell hold Built on a rock impregnalbe it stands Thrice feirslie he assaults and thrise the bold Northumbrean, beats bak his valiant bands At last the warlik Persie yeild it wold For want of victalls in the Prince his hands Not mou'd forsd feard by Gold by strength nor terror want breeds his faultlesse fault his guilteles error. This worthie Prince his armie heir wold rest Wereit with trauell both by sea and land His foes disigns to vieu he thinks it best Which charge he putts unto the Douglas hand For this attempt him self he soone addrest With him twise twelf hid dangers to withstand And furth they went the Contreie for to vew. What they by valor wroght doth nixt enseu. Caput. 7. The Argument. The warlick Douglase on his iournay goas Wheir his most loued Lord did him command He finds a deing knight that sadlie shoes A tale most Pitifull to vnderstand Which dooth a wofull Iniurie disclose Wheirof he vous reuenge and in that land He knou's a knight whois counsall doth obtane Douglase cheif strength the English bands ar slane. Fair fortuns knight that erst had tane in h?d The cuntrie al about to vieu and sie And all the fois designs to vnderstand wh? titanes spous with purple wings forth flie The golden barrs heaunis siluer gates vpb?d She straight vndois when with dreid majestie On silver pauid heauins her Lord of light Rolls forth his golden whils and chareot bright The weestern lands in clouds of night enrold From shaddowis dark of death he doth releas When as the earle so strong so stout so bold Brings foorth his troup weill armd and thence a pais He marcht ou'r daells, hills vaills and forrests old And paissaige frie he finds in euerie place For being oft encountred by his foes Fair victoorie still foreward with him gois. This conquering Lord thrie dayis surth Iournay't right When in a wod hard by a riuer side A pitifull teild told the douglae by a gentilman of dou glaisdail cald kenedie.They sadlie heare a wofull groning knight Forth throu the grous to him in haist thy ride Who deidlie woundit lay a wofull sight His gorie blood the flourie verdir dyit The erle with pitie sadlie him desoght What murtherers that cruell act had wroght. He weaklie leans his head vpone his hand Wan was his face paile death haith dim'd his sight An holow sound his deing voice yet fand These words he braethed faintlie as he might Ah shall the conquerd conquerours with stand When eu'ne them selfs against them selfs still fight Ah heauins thy wrath procur'd doth nou discend, Ah Scotts, your name, fame, glorie, nou must end. In Douglas duelt I kennedie I hight My wife a ladie was allace too fair To fair allace my sorrous doth indight Her too chaste mind was frought with virtues rair In her was all my ioy all my delight With her remaind my heart my thoght my cair Yea she me also lou'd as much and more She me esteimd all earthlie ioys before A hundreth soldiers and a captane bold In Douglas strongest castell doth remane This captane his name was Heslillrig. These hath the land in all mischeiff inrold Which nou by wrong to clifford doth pertane By wrong vsurping Edwards gift and gold whill the right heyre deferrs his right to gane And all the land obeys this captains will Ether in right or wrong in good or Iil. One day hee chancd my ladie for to vew Whill she one diuine seruice did attend Whill as enamord straight of her he greu Whom not enioy't death wold affectioun end Freindship he vrg't on me thus did enseu Tuixt mee and him greate loue but still he faign'd For all his freindship was for to desceaue me And of my cheifest ioy for to bereaue me. Such freindlie loue he seim'd to me to bear Confermd with words with vous with oaths not feu That my too trustie mind could noway fear From such fair sugrad words decept t 'inseu But lo he whisperd in my ladeis ear That I to her did bear a mind vntrew By this one Slight to winn his soot he tryit When by all vther means he was denyit No head to this fond taill at first she took At last he vrg'd so far he taks on hand She should it sie her eie theiron should look Prouiding that she wold but cloisltie stand And nothing wold beuray to his rebook Wheir to she yeilds at last which erst I fand Then foorth into a Groue he did her bring Our which a mightie clifted rock did hing Neir to my house this quiet walk doth ly By which a cleir swist runing riuer glyds A Sister hath my ladie neir hand by That with her sire a graue old knight abids For her the captane seimd in loue to dy When Pensiue oftentims allone he rids He hants my house and yet no Ill I deim'd His virteus worth I still so much esteim'd Whill oft he pensiue seimd and sad with greif I much desird the caus thereof to kno Oft wishd I to his woi's to find releif When after greate and much Intreatie lo He so disgueis'd his thoghts that to be breif He made me to beleiue his ceasles wo Proceids from ladie Anns fair beauties beame For so my ladeis sister heght to name I pitied him and glad of this his loue Promeisd his sute should cunninglie be wrought For which in sacreit I her mind wold proue This he allous for this was all he soght But praied I to my wife sould nothing moue Nor she nor any els shuld know his thoght But trist her to that secret Groue I should And their allone to moue her if I could When night driu's day doun from the westerne lands Eu'ne then he brings my ladie foorth to vieu Wheir I and her fair sister cloislie stands Within a Groue of bussis thik that greu My Aarms Imbrac't I gript and wrong her hands And of these words I softlie did reneu Thow then most worthie fear not lou's annoy Be secreit still and thou shall all enioy. This hard my ladie like to burst for greif Tortred with burning love and cold disdane Whilst I poore Soule knew noght of this mischeif Whiche to aquite my paines he doth ordane Yet to his loue this finds him no releif Her spotles name for this she wold not staine But closlie heapes her pane her greif her woe In her poore heart till it sould burst in two. As dooth a neu fresse strong and mighte wyne Perse throw and burst his vessell ould a shunder So wold her sorrous split her heart in twyne So oft she wishd to fall her Burden vnder But hee that could not worke with this Ingine His lust to furie turn'd almost ô wonder Yet loth by force to work this cruell fate Lest hee were thoght of all the most ingrate. Not that he cair'd for credet faith or fame But that he fear'd some fatall punishment Whill as his passion birneth so extreame As if it lested death wold all preuent For seiknes doth him quite from health reclame His vitall pour's a burning ague spent Wheirwith he seimd tormented so indeid As his disease all humane panes exceid. Such greif for his diseas I did conceaue And such the loue was I to him did beare Of food of rest of sleip did me bereaue Nor can I half expres my louing feare One day I hapt of his diseas to craue The ground or caus wich long I could not heare Ah if your health were in my pou'r said I Or that my life with death your life might by. Doe then to mee your Sorrous all declare That if I can both wold and should reliue you Hope helith woe wisdome our cums dispare And counsall can remeid all paines that greiue you By craft by strength by witt or forsights care Wee shall haue hence all hurt that doth mischiefe you Let not fond shame gainst health and faiftie striue Flie willing death whill hope is yet on liue. So ernestlie in woe these words furth brak As he at last to tell me' seimd content And haveing pausd a little thus he spak Deare frend it fear's me much you shall repent When yee haue knowne what doth my sorrous mak And to my death you will giue soone consent For in my death much pleasur does belong you In life I can not leiue except I wrong you, No then said I, I feare not let me know It Come weill, come woe, come death, come life, come either Weill then said he vnwilling I shall show It Your wife her beautie nay my folie Rather From both of these or either loue doth droue it Or shall I say more treulie fate and nather Which secretlie I smotherd haue so long And rather chuisd to die then do you wrong. To chaiss this frantik-passion from my mind I you desired to moue her Sister Ann For to her beautie had I bein inclind I haplie had left off wheir I began But since remeid at all I can not find Except of all the earth the onlie man Whom I lou'd best I should so fare injure Death first vnto my loue shall end procure. These speiches pearst my heart in throgh mine eare Nor tongue nor hand nor fute could sturr or moue Greate was the loue I to my wife did beare Him both I lou'd and pitied as did proue Who rather chuisd to die without all feare Then me to wrong this all the rest aboue This this I say eu'ne this allone did kill me This one respect his life to saif did will me. Wheirfore at last I said first shall I lose Both her my self and all my Ioys beside Then such a worthie frend should mak a choise Of death if I can for his life prouide And to be short at length we did dispose The matter so that kind too kind I tride For in my place I did him so conuoy Her thoghts vn-stain'd he did her self enioy. But I my self such greife did soone conceaue A thousand deaths vnto my self I wish'd For Jelosie did in my soule engraue Such endles pains that I no torment mis'd Such eating corrasius my witts bereaue That my too wofull heart was like to burst Ah woful acte which doth my soule afraie, My self consents my self for to betray But he all reasone did exceid so farr And with Jngratitude so muche was staind That of my ioy he did me quite debar For when he had his filthie lust obtaind He then bewrayt him self which all did marr And whiche was more of mee hee also faignd That I contriued the Plot that I did sende him Her I disdaind her I did gladlie lend him Wheirat she did conceaue such endles greife That presentlie she doth resolue to die Whill hee eu'ne he that wroght this greate mischeif Departs in hast and to his strength doth flie, I all this Time of cares found noe reliefe Wondring that to his bedd retornd not he. Wherefore I in the morning straight arose, And to the Chambre where she laie forth-goes. But there I found her, ah I found her there, As she was then, would God that I had been, A purple streame with milke mixt white &amp; faire, Ran her more white and snowie brests between, With child she was, the milke cold wel declare, Ah too vntimely fate, ah death I meane, Thus past al helpe forth from the bed I drew her, And in my arms (ah woful sight) did view her. Eu'en as the Lillie cliere, fresh, faire &amp; white, Widdred with drught; grows wrinkled pale &amp; blak, So her faire face faire bewties choice delight, Did swartish seeme, that life, bloode, moisture lack, In her dimm Eies, death did my Crime indite, Once lookd shee vp, and once these words she spake, Æh let my guilty blood wash forth the staine, That cruell you, to my chast-bed did gaine. Ah let my Soule mount to heighe Iustice throne And their sound foorth a sad still sad reuenge Heauins onlie viewed my Chaste Chaste thoghts allone Heauins onlie may forgiue this murther straunge Heauins onlie oues my chaste vous eurie one Heauins onlie wrongd since I my voues infring Heauins onlie then your wrath fierce wrath surceas you And let my blood thus sacrafiz'd apeas you. These words Apeasd you seal'd vp deaths sad birth And her last breath deir breath deir life deir all Ah cursed death bereft earths rarest worth Ay me for shame whill hee on shame did call Shame closd his lips the sound went warklie forth Shameing to shaw what after did befall His moueing, speiche, his sight and all was lost Doun fals his head and hee yeelds vp the Ghost. Him self had kild him self they surlie scand But when they wey these his first speiches right Ah shall the conquerd conquerours with stand When euin them selfs against them selfs do fight They think some freind of hers that their him fand, Had doone the deid or els some English knight Aidet by Scotts had kild him for the same Surmiseing that himself had kild his dame. But why or housoeur he shed his blood They all lament this wofull tragedie Whill their braue Lord auou'd to taist no food Till he had tane reuenge most rigoruslie Of that same English Lords Ingratitood Wheirto occasion fitlie did applie A present meane wheirby he might forthfill His weell made vow and wirk his warlick-will. By this the light gaue place to schaddous broune And sable clouds had maskit all the skie When from the hills and forrests they come doune And in an valley fare they might espie Ane staitlie pallace far from anie toune To which this warlick creu did haist in hie This ould gentilman was callit dictione and is now cald sunintone of yat ilk and duelleth as yit kard by the castell of douglas and hes his liuing of that hous for the same.Wheir they a reuerent aged knight did find That gius them Entertainment to their mind. To a Chambre richlie heung the Erle was broght And their disarmed by a ladie fair The rest was all vnarm'd and with a thoght Thay to a staitlie hall did then repair Whoes Tables ritchlie spred their soone was broght All kynd of meats all kynd of dainteis rair Thus were they serud to supper in such sort As might become a king for Princelie port The supper done the worthie count began To questioun with his hoasts both graue and wise His linage house and name requird he than And who doth reule that Prouence wheir he lyis Braue sir quod he, I'le till you treulie when Fair Schotlands glorie mounted to the sky'is When in sueit calms of peace her natiue borne Dekt her fair front whoes wealth did thame adorne. Eu'ne then I seru'd a too too noble Lord Heir silent long scarce could the rest essay Greif kindnes, loue, and pitie weill deploird His greuous lose, tears did his woes beuray This quandarie once past and speiche restoird He thus begane agane eu'ne him I say Whom english Edward did by wrong surmeis In prison close and their ah their he deis. Douglas great Erldome did this Lord enioy A sone he had both young strong fair and wise The fruct that keipt his yeers from age annoy The Caskat ritche wheir all his tressour lyis Sent vnto fraunce whill he is yet a boy. And to returne it seems he still denyis Whill heir the Clifford holds his reueneus Whoe tirranizing all the land subdeus. Ah were hee heir aige from my wrinkled brou Wold sone depairt and youth wold once transport Those siluer hair's with strength and vigor neu That wold my limms and weakned arms support This arme should mak him way for to reneu His iust reuenge in such a woundrous sort That Englands King shold quake for feare and shame When in his ears fame thunderd foorth his name. Why said the Erle and if him self were heir Hou could he be reuengd vpone his foes Whoes strenth nor his mutch greater doth apeir Which maks our Prince eu'ne Bruce so oft to lose No no said he God shall his wraith reteir And mak braue Bruce shine like the morning rose Whose beauteous br?ches eche wheir spreds &amp; springs Whose odours sueit the sences confort Brings. The count for Ioy cutting his speiches short In quir's his name who told he Dikson heght And then he call's to mynd his fathers court Wheir he hade sein him many a ioyfull night So that Embraceing him he doth report His name and hou he was his Lord by right Whereat hee humblie Kneills and doth Imbrace His feitt for Ioy whill tears bedeu's his face Nou eche of vthers sight did much reioise And after they had talk'd and argu'd long The erlle inquirs what way he might oppose Him self against his foes inflicting wrong Braue Lord said hee too Morrou all oure foes Will muster foorth their glorious forces strong Vnder the conduct of a valiaunt knight Whoe heir reulls all beneth the Cliffords might. This man within your cheifest strenth doth byde His proud commanding Garesone with all Palme Sonday is to morrou: All prouide Their Palms to bear at that cheif festuall They all to Church in sumptuos maner ryde Yow by the way may caus them catche a fall My self shall lead the way vnto your trane And if I can the formest Bront sustane, Glaid was the erle so fitt a mein to find Wheiron they both concloud then goes to rest And on Olimpus or proud Titan shind The antient knight in arms him self addrest He raisd the Douglas whoes still restles mind Had baneist sleip and for reuenge was prest Nou with this knight he and his train departs Reuengfull fire still burning in their haerts. And neir into the Church when they were got They hapt to meit an horie aiged sire Whose wofull looks his wofull lose did note At whome the Erle did ernestlie inquire What did he laike Sir knight quod he my lot Is for to laike what most is my desire Which is allace my long desired Graue Aige, lose greif sorrou, doth all ioys bereaue. An daughter had I which was all my ioy In whom I more then in oght els delighted But her from me an English did conuoy An English that my natioun ay dispighted I to the captane Plaind of this annoy The captane that my wrongs should all haue righted But greater wrongs then these him self hath doone Wherfore to right all wrongs he still doth shune And thus my Doughter with my foe doth stay Her wrging to his pleasure for to yeild Whill me thus scornd and mock'd with long delay Eu'ne nou the captane with proud words reuild As he with all his troups from churche to day With Palms in hand was marching throu the feild They all reiosing whill my Greifs reneu And nou they come my life for to perseu. The aintient knight looks vp that diksone hight They war one a place cald the bred libank ouer against the church from the which they come &amp; ioind with the English as they come out of the Church. And seis a hundreth Armed men drau neir And saeis braue Lord lo heare the long wishd sight You of your vous and me of mine shall cleir Then with these words he doth begin the fight Whill as his Lord the rest with conforts cheir Whoes countenance their curage all appeill'd Their Eis, hearts, hands and all their foes assaild. Then burnt with hate of Glorie praise reuenge This all subdweing Erle rushd throu the rout Bright schind his looks, of sun-like beams a reange About his head did flame, his curage stout did his mild looks to sparkling furie change That shoots forth noble anger round about: On eu'n they fight, and yet with valiaunt hand Their noble Lord made way to his small band. Who hemd about in midst of all his foes His valiaunt heart and curage weill made knowne His name and fame his deids did weill disclose And eurie one to vther has him schoune All runs to him his life to mak him lose Which fondlie whill they seik they lose their oune For on his sword accusing eche of error Sat dreidfull death all armd with feir and terror. Long foght he thus imbreud with goir and blood Till he at last their captane did espie Whoes knightlie valor long he vieuing stood By whoes strong hand four knights did breathles ly Wheirfore he steps to him with angrie mood And him to mortall Battel did defy Which long in equall Ballance did abide Whill eche his strenth and vtmost valor tride. The angrie count at last with wrathfull heart Did in his stirrops raise him self on hie His foe with force wold set the blou apart But nou no force his force could beir away On his left shoulder to his greif and smart The crimsone collord Brand did light whereby His warlike arme was from his bodie shorne Him self with force and pane to earth was borne. Nou he who late did captanlike comand Was as a captiue forst for to obey Whill as this noble Erle with conquiring hand No longer with his prisoner wold stay But where the rest in Battell stronglie stand He thither haists, his sword sheirs fourth the way And shortlie victor was of all the feild Forsing them all to die to flie or yeild. The victorie by Heaunis decree obtaind They thence depart the castell to supprise Wherin no souldiour at all remaind Nor anie to gainstand them did arise This fortres since he had so brauelie gaind Heir wold he rest and heir wold he deuise To mak his Captiues by ane vucouth death To knou his vou and iustlie kindled wraith. Low in a vault the captaine first he band And all the vther captiues him beside The grane and flour the Beir and wine he fand It was euer efter called the douglas Ladner. Which they before could neu'r yneuch prouide With this he fild the house wherin they stand Thus chokt with meit and dround with drink they died Whoes gredie gorgis neu'r suffisd with Ill Now in their death might gurmandize their fill. Then all the tours he raisd vnto the ground And leueld all the ditches with the plane Poisond the springs, and fontans which he found And to the wonted libertie againe Restorde that land which long before lay bound Beneth a Tirrants seruill zoak with paine But this estate they long remand not In Such was the wrath of angrie heauins for sinne. Caput 8. The Argument. Scotlands great King from treasone ill contriued By heauens and his oune valour is relieued Inspight of twyce two hundreth he repriued The victorie which he alone atchiued He resteth their till all his knightes aryud The wittie Hay is with his hast agrieud Ferce Eduard ayd vnto his brother lendes Douglas to winn his strength agane in tendes. Whill fame with brasen breath did souud o're all What she had heard in Scota's faerest land Of Bruce returne, whoes arme imperiall Now our the westerne regions did command Greate Eduards Uiceroy did a consall call Wherin with graue aduise he chuisd a band Of warlik Soldiers and ther Captane bold Sir Jngrham Bell, A champion wife and old. Now these for to gane stand his poure he sends And for to keip him still Into the wast For he him self with greater poure intends To pull the wyde vp be the root at last That squadron then their Warlick poure extends And marcheing to the toune of air they past Wheir as their warie captane minds be slight To work his valiaunt foe a foull dispight. Within this land an antient kinght did dwell Whoe of oure prince had secret frendscip got He liebail heght whome th'Englishe did compell Of his sad death for to contriue the plot Two valiant sons he had nay sons of hell Who stainis thair fame with filthie treassons blot Nor this their treassone wold at all reveale But waits to tak occatioun by the heale. Neir to king Roberts camp a Groue their lay Low by a riuers side and out of sight Wheir aiged oaks their branshed arms display And maks dimm shaids with dark and glomie light Heir oft oure prince in secret vft to pray Heir lay the murtherers till on a nicht Doune to this groue the Prince allone descended On whois returne a paige without attended No sooner mong these thickets did he go When he beheld wheir thay had cloislie lyen By what intelligence I do not know Or rather reuelatioun most diwyne He calls his paige and from his hand does throw A crosbow and a bolt both sharp and fyne The auntient knight he killeth with the same As he vnwar's too rashlie fordward came, All armed the vther tuo in wraith and rage Began him cruellie for to assaill But his good sword did both their wraiths assuage And did so much against them both preuaill Eu'ne then expird the daits of both their aige They in their death dispaering curse and raill Against their fate and fortuns bad decree Of God who cairles leues shall cairles die. Thus to the camp the Prince returns agane Loud, honord, feard, admird, and praisd of all When night of day the victorie did gane The Scoutts returnd befoir his feit thay fall Whill in his Regall Tent he did remane Presenting their a prisoner with all Whoe to this worthie Prince in secret shoes That he should be assailed by his foes. And how they wold aproche that veray night Vnder thik darknes blak and cloudie vaile And wold assault his Camp with suddain fight Nor wold strong Trenches noght at all preuaill With fire throune furth their Tents shold burne so bright Yet could not this his wonted curage quaill But with a glaide and cheirfull countenance He doth inquir what way they wold aduance. Beyond this riuer ar they yet said he And by a secreit foord they pas vnknoune Then quod the Prince heauins oure Protector be As is oure caus such be oure fortons shoune Now he commands his captans for to sie That his small armie from the Camp be drowne And rank't in Battell furth vpone the plane Wheir they in arms must all that night remane. To Guarde the Camp he sixtie maks to stay And brings four hundreth foorth with speir and sheild With this small armie he wold neids essay To force his subtill foe to flie or yeild And that braue Lord that bears the name of hay He doth creat as Gen'rall of the feild Him self with onlie two wold go and view The foord wheir they sould pas that wold persew. Now doun the Riuer side his course he bent From whoes steip banks heig he crags and rocks arise And still he seis the farther that he went Heigher the Shoir louer the streame still lyis At last wheir as the rocks in two was rent Their nature did a narrow path devyiss So to the Riuer doun or vp might go But one in rank or at the most but two. When this braue Prince this strength did weil behold Quicklie these two that with him thither went He bak derects and prays in haist they wold Drow vp the rest his foes for to preuent For heir quod he oure foes to ws ar sold To die what death we list for to inuent Craft without craft we should with stand in vane Heir wil I stay till you returne agane. When they were gone he softlie nerer drew Whill as he hears a noise and ratling sound Which still the longer heard the greater grew At last horse Braying mens shrill voice confound Yet these he vous his flight shall neu'r persew Nor oght but death sall mak him lose his ground When lo paill Phebe shynd so bright and cleir That he discryis four hundreth horse well neir. These crossing ou'r the Riuer did ascend The passage wheir with sword heighe borne he stands And with an bloth first bright Crest doth rend Nor head nor breist the mortall blaid with stands Doun falls the knight his reilling horse doth bend And fordward leaps but lo in both his hands The Prince his sword sheirs throu his hoarie syds And for his Lord a bloodie Tomb prouyds, Now with a shout the rest of this proud crue Throngs vp the path and stronglie him Inuaid Part climing vp the crags vpon him flew And at his feitt they fall Leam'd, Bruisd dismayd Troad by their frends they die the rest furth drew Their swords each other hurts, hast Loue betraied Strait waie, darke night, firce raige doth blind them so Each hurts his frend, for haste to harme his foe. But as a Roke, a Craig, or Cap of lande, That fire air watter raiging wold diuide Doth stedfast still and vnremoued stand Gainst thunder lightning tempests storme or tide Eu'ne so the Prince ganstands this warlick band And all their raige their wrath their strength doth bide Still as they came in troups confoosd to find him He marcheing leau's them slaine in heaps behind him. Their Leader formest now to speak began Ah shame quod he now neuer leiue we more So manie hundreth beat by one poore man Should die a thousand deaths death cloisd the dore An organe of his speache he staggring ran And relling twice he fall's the Prince before Whoes sword had perst his hart he lifts his eies With half groned words he threats &amp; threatning deis. The captains Brother thristing for reuenge Thrusts throu the throng and to the Prince he hyis Wrath from his eies foorth sparkled lightning straunge And with an Angrie voice he sternlie cryis Ah villans you your credet thus infreinge Ah soldiers you no soldiers thus that seis Your captane slane ah now returne yow neuer You Fasards wretches Ourcasts curst for euer Waik feble faint for horse for sword or spear More fit for iron toolls then Armour bright Your heads Breists baks should hauie burdens bear No helms nor sheilds should you adorne with light In curage place, is entred shame and fear No hope is left but in your feit and flight In darkest night your cheifest strenth abyds Darknes your shame your feare and faintnes hyds. And full of raige for eu'rie word a stroak He gius oure Prince whoes sword bears eurie blo And whill he yet enraig'd wold more haue spok He cuts his words and with them cuts in two His Iaws on him death spreads his mistie cloak He on his brother falls whoe leiuing lo Him doth imbrace both kish both soules remoue O! Pitie, great, O! Blesd, O! wandrous love Now foreward rushd this single Campioun stout And maks such hauock alway wheir he goes As Boreas when he has blasted out His storms: of Herbs, Treis, Beists, and Foulls, the foes Or as the raiging Floods that rore and rout Gainst Rooks or Thunders that heigh Tours doun throes As Earthquaks threat to burst the eairh a sunder His force so shaks thois bands O Strenth! O wonder Whill thus he kills and driu's them bak by force And all their bloes vn-harm'd vn-hurt sustaind Horse bruisd their Maisters whill he treds the horse In and beyond the stream they all remaind Forst doun with might the passage quite they lose When lo the armie cums and quiklie raind A storme of swords whill trumpets roaring blast Warr's thundring tempests foorth with lightning cast. Death, horror, murther, feare Greif sorrou Paine Came fare before aud with thier tallons wide Sease on their hearts and chilid in eurie vaine Their vitall Breath, that fleis it self to hide: Nou ar they so benoum'd that scarce remiane Strenth for to flie Or force for to abide Some flee some fall some droun dispaird allone Eche vther hurts for haist for to be Gone The Prince by this of al his foes was cleird And setts him doune vpone a stone to rest Sueat on his face Blood on his arms appeird His breath was short faint heat his hairt opprest Wearie his arms his hands so stiflie steird He could not weild his sword which he possest And lo the sword did seeme no sword at all So blunted was the Edge and hack't so small. By this his Troups were come vnto the place And for him calls and for him loudlie cryis But when they fand him when they kneu his face In heaps they run to feid their longing eies And doun they fall his feitt for to imbrace With thanks and praise to God they rend the skeis That hee allone overcums a thousand foes They doubt who wonders most or most reioes. They find the captaine and his Brother slane And fiftein more ly wallowing in their blood Some English were some Scotts who felt the pane They gane who gainst their king and cuntrie stood? In Gallowoy these Troups did all remane Holding that cuntrie in great seruitude They took King Edwards pay their captane bold Broght them in hope of gane praise, Glorie, gold. But the Lord hay and vthers graue and wise Against his rashnes bitterlie did chide Quod they what proue you in this interprise No Generall nor no captane Prince nor Guide In whoes deir lose eu'ne all oure losse non lyis Nor ours allone but all this all beside Ah should you not to mind oure natioun call That but for yow no natioun were at all. Allace do you of Glorie so at count That It to gane ane Empire you wold lose Nor can you not to endles glorie mount But to all dangers you your self expose In vaine poore valor doth for Glorie hount If noght for Goode of wisdome he maks choise Be wise deare Lord since of our croun and camp You ar the head the heart the life the lamp. He litle answere to these speeches made But said he forcd was ether fight or flee Now to the camp triumph and waies they ryid Whil day shuttes furth his siluer hornes on hie Fame flees oure all on Warr's winges sanguino reid And stroues the seid of this great victorie, Which back vnto the camp brought manie skore Who crost with fortunes bad hade fled before, Edward the bold in Lennox nou remiand And with thrie hundreth did that land subdeu Who hearing what his brother late hade gaind Returnes vnto the campe with all his creu The Douglas with his traine that late obtaind His oune cheef strenth which last he ou'r threu Heares that the Clifford hade with wondrous care Reedified the bulding much more faire. And left a warr-like man a valiaunt knight To keep the hold with him three hundreth strong And he who thus commanded Thirswall hight A man who hade in warre experience long Yet wold the Douglas needs essay his might And to the world mak knowne his right their wrong To sixtie now his traine augmented werre With those he wold essay the chance of warre. Caput. 9. The Argument. An English visard with great arte foreshowes The Douglas of spring great to these our daies And how that happie famelie aroise To fortunes height where at the world may gaize The secound time he doeth him self apoise Against his foe and their with endles praise Oure throwes the captain of his cheifest streinth Then back to ead his Prince returnes at leinth.

Who weied with him, doeth equalize his woorth And yet with fame can not the world propine So loth is time to bring occasioune forthe Yet vertue for his sone shall grace prepair And thus to fame shall measour forthe his shair, Heauin cheanging time shall siuill discord reas And wrap the Scotts in wealth consuming woes When he by god set vp vnto thees daies Shall leaue his soil to forren lands he goes Widing throu rtubles streame and thear with praise Williame his sone erle of angus died in pareis Anno 1611. He hes writtin then cronicklie of that name to which I haue refered most pairte of their actiouns. His pen vnto his predicessoures showes The way to win from darck obliuiones night Boolding their tropheis with his vertues might. This lamp gone out o then his sone succeides Reasing that hous declind to former height Whoes mind is great with child of glorious deids And as a Collon fair vpholds the weight Of ane learge frame so from his witt proceids The strenth that onder props that neames great might Williame now Erle of angus. Yet he by airt stops natures streame to flow With Junos string still bending Pallas bow. He ripes the tumbes of his Ancestors old And brings them clad with robes of heauenlie light For all enshewing aiges to behold They shute furth beams of fame and glorie bright Which long lay hidde in nightes dark pitchie mold Ou'r vaelde by sadd obliuion from our sight Their ghostes reioising that so rich a geme Springs from thear loynes t'immortaliz their name, The dissent of Erles of mortoune.Now cumes the nixt great famelie in sight That iointlie with the first at first shall spring Which eurie where sendes furth such lampes of light As Earth and other firmament doeth bring Wherin eche fixed starre doeth burne so bright As yeelldes both lyf and light to eurie thing So farre those glorie lighting flammes doeth shine Moueing their orbe with influence deuine. Iohn Lord of dakeith Sir Iames Douglas his yongest brother he had tua sones the ouldest was Lord of dakeith &amp; the second leard of lochleuin.The first that shall illuminat the skie Of this bright orber this hea'une reflexing sphere Armed with his fathers magnaminitie Shall be a great and mightie man of warre Of whom shall two arise to rectifie Two lines that shall their fame to heaune vprear: Yet to the younger shall the elder fall And both thus ioined shall one great house install. The discent of the lairdes of loghleoin. The first laird of loghlevin. He was with arichbald grim at intoune battel Wheer heauing vin the enemies standard from the hand of Sir Thomas Kolbuth was the cheif of the victorie. The second laird of loghlevin who going with the Erle of buchan to france defended the passage of a brig there with thrie handreth agains the dooke of clarens his armie whom he maid reteir &amp; inperseung forceie was kild.O thou thrice famous lake and strand of Leuine Famous, for that great reace shall come from the Inrich'd with graces by the wandering Seuin That still aloft in th'azure valleis flee The first that shall adorne thy watrie hea'une With sure and stay'd establisd reul I sie By fatell deades shall manie fortunes shair And Pallas sword shall all his pathes prepair. The beaies thy temples shall at lintoune beare Whear thow by valour from a valiant knight The leopard and Flourdeluce shall teare Thus shall thy arme put all thy foes to flight But when the valiant Persie wageth warre Against his Prince in that ontimlie fight Thow valiantlie aduentring then shall fall Yet after death thy fame shall sore oure all. But thou braue youth altho a stripling young Scornes in thy natiue soil for to remeaine Thou heirs Belonas dreadfull bell was roung Following the voice with honoures thristing paine Wheer all the plaines inbroudert war along With gorre, blood, rent armes and souldiers slaine Theer haiueing win fair conquest by the hair Thou leapes from of this wordlie theater. And then succeides that all prais worthie youth The thrid leard of loghleuin. That with the ground stone laies a fairer streame Mounting that house vp to the secound grouth Whois worth in varre illusterates his name Then cumes that blaizing comet of the south Whoes voundrous deads with terror soundes his fame His lookes sendes vertue furth so graic'd with art As striks mild reuerence in each barbarous heart. And yet his galent sone shall with him striue The forth leard of loghleuin. Who to that aige shall greatest light restore As painefull bees still workes to serue the hiue And leaziedrons that deoth their wealth deuore Their dares not enter nor with them may striue So nature doeth prouid for to decore That fruitfull Stem with such whoes pains exceides Past all cumpare in heigh and vertues deades No frutles drone shall from that reace arise The fift laird of loghleuin. Ech giues testificats of honours height What praises to the sext can I deuise The saixt laird of loghleuen. That serues his Prince in manie a blooddie fight Nor conquest euer to croune his pains denies The seuinth leard who was alwaies with King Iames the 3 against the [illeg.] &amp; the habrons, his good seruice was often times of grit walue to his Prince. Nixt him cumes one whoes worth and pourfull might Doeth aid his Prince against vsurping foes Whois-vant at last that mightie Prince ouerthoues.

Williame now Erle of mortune.O but his sone is Mars and Phebus knight For valour corrage wit and beutie store The foggie mistes of ignorantes dark night He cleres, to knowleg day he ops the doore Eu'ne as a lanterne from a toures proud height Shoues the seas port for shipes to win the shore So his cleir lamp of judgment showes the vay For dark grose wites to land in vertues beay. The actiue boldnes by his spreit refind Produce resistles actiouns stronglie Knut The quick vivasitie that meltes his mind In streames of eloquence ou're flous his with And yet so much to courtassie inclind That humble mildnes on his broue doeth sit Which tempers passioune still with facultie And makes a simphatheising hermonie, For lo his soules reare faculteis devine Is so cut furth on his humaine perfectioune Yat in his lowkes heigh maiestie doeth shine By modestie held in so sweit subiectioune As alvay holdes a meane nor doeth dicline To simple mildnes or to proud infectioune Thus descentie stells furth with euerie glance And freames a persing amorouss countinance. Which breeds respectiue reuerance with dilyt In euerie heart whois eyis doeth him behold With admiratioune and amezment gryt That streans a sweit obedience on controld But now I feare if I the rest indyt To cloy your ears with my discours to bold Yet quod the captain I would glaidlie kno If still that name produice such fruits or no. O still quod he and shall be still increst For both thoes mightie famaleis proceides To honoures great whearof they ar posest Mounting aloft with heigh and glorious deades And this lordes sone; whill he would say the rest A sudden tumult their amezment breides Ou'r all the land great clamoures they might heir Which did forshow sum deanger to droue neir, Wherwith they leap to earmes the captain cryes For all the Garisone in armes to be When lo hard by the castell he aspyes Weer driu'n great heardes of cattell hestilie This was the conquering knight that doeth deuyis How he that countray might of thraldome frie And neids would treane the captain from his hold Whoes strenth he would assay with currag bold. But this his purpoiss greatlie doeth with stand They hardlie could be broght vnto the feild Wheirfor he takes this Stratagem in hand To treane theame out to feght to flie or yeild A wooddie pleane neir Sandie Landes he fand Whoes vmbrage seemd from Phebus heat to sheild On eche syd grew the Treeis so bushie thick It seem'd that Nature freamd it for a trick. Thither the Erlle by night his troups forth gwids Wheir eche lyis closlie quiet whist and still His wantcuriours in haist he thus prowyds To bring their heards of cattell from the hill And those that neirrest to the tour abids Those driue they hence whill as the heard men fill The air with schricks, the land with loud allarms Wheir with proud Thirswall cled in glorious arms. With all his Garesone addrest for warre Isht foorth in haist for to returne the pray And followed haiuing nether dout nor feare Till they were past the Ambush fare away Then these that fled returnd, their swords they reare Aloft their sheilds, before their strong arms stay Their blous they beare they pushe strik stab and kill Th'amased foe, who yet resisted still. Till at their baks a suddant storme a rose Whoes horrid noyss doth mak them all to quaik And with their force their furie and their blois Their brokin rancks begins to faint and shaik The first rank bakward on the second gois The second on the third the third doth brak Crusht by the fourt and fift and at eche end They leap furth scattring heir and their they bend So doe the cluds disperst from East to West In ranks and roues that hing cleir white and fair When as the Northerne and the Southerne blast Foorth from their caues breaks throu the trubled aer Rank gainst a rank cloud gainst a cloud they cast Till in a heap confoosd at last they tear And burst a sunder crush'd with furious bloes Scattred in drops fleis from betwene their foes. Thriswall their deid beneath the Douglas sword Of all his men but nintie went away Who in the Castell got from thence they pourd Dairts quarreis Stones like haill without delay The Erlle reuerd his band when they were tourd And from his Prince no longer wold he stay Gainst whom he hard an armie was prepaird Of which in tyme to show him he repaird. Caput. 10. The Argument. Whill Fortune houeres doutfull of hir cho's Nor peace nor warre on ether syd displays Hard fait anon prepaireth greatter voes Great diss forsies that Ioue the Scots wil reaise To former height and furth his feinds he throwes Who temps the Scots they leaue the Bruce whoes praise Augmentes whill vnawarrs his foe assailles His wittie flight his valour twyse prevailes. The Prince of Darknes now long tyme reiosd Of Gods great wrath am?g his childr? throun Whoes foull offences had his fauor los'd Fearing if they repent that Grace were shoune A thousand Ills into his mynd he tost Wheir with to tempt them yet to heauins vnknoune Thus wyldlie Staird he when he muisd allone Whill as he sitts on his Infernall Throne, And now resoluing to his work he falls And with a dreadfull greislie countenance The curst and haitfull Fureis vp he calls The Mounsters trembling gius obedience Their poisond Gorgis all with Uenome swalls Enflamd with his reid Eies hote flaming glance Whill his strong breath furth from his ratling throat A noyse like to a fearfull tempest shot. Which made the Earth to quaik and deafned hell Thus vnderstood they this confused Sound Yow malice proud and yow inuy that dwell Amid oure firie Regious vnder ground Haist vp and with infecting breath expell All peace and let no ametie be found In the greate North and sie that you defyle With blood and warr great Europs greatest Iile, Mak Englands King to forge some causes new To keip the right which he by wrong hes got Tell him that heau'ne ordains him to renew Sinns iust reward vpon the sinfull Scot Mak English all with deadlie hait persew The Scots their onlie antient foes by lot The onlie blok that euer bears them doune From all their greatnes Glorie and renoune, Scotts only wer the ouer throuwers of them selfis deuiditt in thrie factions the brooce the baliol, and the cumming, both the last took pairt with England against the Bruce.Thus edge them on, It were greate lose great shame If they vnto their wonted greatnes rise Your strength allone was neuer so extreame To mak them once to shrink nor could deuise By slight or might to droune their famous name Till now that loe them selfs them felfs defyis And what your swords before could neuer doo Their swords haue doune and winn them selfs to yow. So that yow sie heau'ne fauors your intent With these and vther your intendit slight Arme them with pride hate Anger discontent And moue the Scotts still gainst them selfs to fight For lo I sie Joue doth his wrathe relent And minds to raise the Scotts to greater might For in that famous Bruce and in his lyne They must be blisd and ou'r all Europe shyne. Though what great Joue decrees we can not mend Yet may we oft delay th'intendit blise Which he ordains vpon fraill man to send Since sluggish man by Nature cairles is And wee may moue him thankles to offend And oft to disobey his law I wish For man is fleshlie geu'ne to foull delight And God is alway pure cleir holie right, Since wee of all the damned heyres as cheiff And has no longer tyme from Torments frie Then till the cup be full of Gods hote greiff And that greate day of his fierce wrathe wee sie Then with the soules which now without releif We still torment shall wee tormented be And which is worse oure pains shall neu'r be spent Whill we oure selfs must still oure selfs torment. Then heauins decree to stay oure strength is small Yet heaueing tyme we may not tyre of Ill Since what we wold that can we not at all Do what we may we may not what we will At these his words Invy and malice swell With murdring hate their breists with venom fill And vp they flie to view days glorious light Bringing Mischeif, Greif, horror, warr, dispight. Arriuing heir they fill eche Godles heart With anger, raige, Mischeif, pride, hate, inuie, Then to the camp they hie to vse their airt But their vane Slight the nobler sort descrie Whill grace, loue, wisdome, with their worths dese[illeg.] Did dreiue them thence in endles infamie Yet in the basser sort great pou'r they winne Throu whoes faint hearts dispair, feir, danger, rune Greate bands of these by their deceat they dreu Whoe stelling from the camp by night doth flie And still these feinds to their fant minds doth show For hoped Conquest shamefull Infamie Ther former lose remembrance lets them knou Which oft repeated maks their hopes to die These words they murmur still them selfs among On shamefull death shall we attend so long. Allace what strength what might what pou'r haue we Ritch England warlick Schotland to ganestand May not oure Lord behold his infamie And in the glas of former works haue scand That gainst his will heaunis bend their iust decrie Earth scorns to build a Trophee for his hand Fate to his fall his frouning fortun brings Heauen, earth, fate fortun all crose his desings. Heauins neuer yet did feuour his intent Earth neu'r lookt for conquest at his hand Fate neuer fraimd his will to find content And fortun neuer lik't of his demand Fair victorie her cheifest wealth has spent On his proud foe whoe conquering doth command Vs all if got like robbers hangd to bee Thus we'r but outlawes to his maiestie. With Greif and sorrou pane and trauel sore We hunger-sterud Amidst the montans ly Oure frends still aid oure foes and which is more Eu'ne oure oune natioun vs with scorne defie Thousands that rose in oure defence before Now with oure foes gainst vs ther forces trie Whill wee that noght but shame and want doth gane Attend on hope and still attend in vane, Why stay we then to immitat ther flight Whoe with our foes abide in wealth and ease No let vs render vp this camp but fight And giue our Lorde to vse him as they please Or if noght this then let vs flie by night And yeildinge to our foes, their wrathe appease This laste opinioun eache approueth so That eu'rie night in troups away they Goe Thus wroght blak Plutos messingers their will And now to worke the rest of their mischeife Sir Odomer de wallance was erll of Pembrok.Braue Pembroks ear with these glad neus they fill And fills his warrlik mind with raige and greif To mak an end of warr they show him still That now he may at ease without releif His waikned foe of forder hopes depriue Quite ouerthroune or kild or tane aliue Then fed with hope he doth an armie raise Of Scotts and English neir ten thousand strong Whoes minds with hate and with desire of praise They do inflame nor stay they those among But heir and their throgh all the land they gaise Subiects to find whereby to work more wrong At last of lorne that cruell Lord they find And vnto new reuenge they stirre his mind, To nev reuenge of his deir cusings blood Greate Cummernald whom Bruce before had slane He to this warr brings foorth fiue thousand good And to greate Englands generall ioins amane Thus foreward prikt with hope and hatfull mood They brauelie martch ou'r hil ou'r daill ou'r plane Whereof our Gallant noght at all did kno So spedelie and secretlie they go. Now of fiue hundreth thrise with him remaind Thrie hundreth scant the rest war fled and gone Whereof he oft and secretlie complaind Yet wiselie in him self conceall'd his mone But nou his scouts by trauell that obtaind A sight of their Proud foe return anone And to him bring those wofull neus at last Whoes sound from eare to eare right sadlie past. The relicts small of his forsaeken host Wheir all about him standing in a round Whill as bold Edward thus did him accost My Lord and brother let not this confound Your noble thoghts tho numbers quite be lost In this small band must all your hops be cround Tho fortun beare your iust desings aurie She can not let vs brauelie for to die. Will is it knowne since first we Armour tooke When in oure cuntreis cause we swore to stand That euer since wee suffred haue rebooke Nor fortun once wold fauour oure demand With shame and lose oure. Frends vs all forsooke Oure soldiers seing noght but lose at hand Haue left vs Cowards worthie not to breath, That we may look for nothing now but death. Yet sall it neu'r be said nor sein nor knowne That in oure latest hour we shrink or flie No let oure hearts oure hands and al be shoune Eu'ne in dispight of fortuns crueltie To work most dread reuenge if ouerthroune And with their brauest captains let vs die Lo fame and Glorie shall oure death attend Nor shall they much reioise in this oure end. The rest whome Anger curage greif dispair Tormenting made to wish their deaths were nie Applaudeth all that he had said and their All crie dye die reuenge and brauelie die But their braue Prince with mild looks doth declair His counsall wise and his command whereby Their fiurie hote and fond dispair refraining: He to his brother answers thus complaning. Thy counsall in the wise no place will find With such dispairing hezerds to betray Oure selfs vnto oure foes they proue to kind To please their foe that works their oune decay What tho the basser sort their beastlie mind In flieing from oure camp doth weill beuray Yet hope and forsight fortun still commands And warrs good luuk in wisdoms counsall stands. What though oure fainting troups haue fled before Who e'r the neues of ill with terror stings These at the reall sight will feare much more And confort none but meir disconfort brings Yea when they fled my hopes they did restore And with them fled the Douts of my desings Greate foolls ar they that builds their hopfull goods Vpone the euer changeing multitude In you that doth remane my confort lies Nor can a world of armeis me effray For heau'ne promeisd mee that I should ryise Vnto my foes shame ruin and decay I cair not I what earth or hell deuyis They can not hinder heauin though they dalay Fraill mans intendit blish by heauins decreed With heauinlie faith is eathlie wants suppleid. Knou then this praise to Scotts is onlie deu Neu'r conquerd yet neu'r yeild it to their foes For want refusing neuer to perseu With endles warr the iust reuenge of those That wold their liues or liberteis subdeu For Scotts will ether all way mak a chose Of friedome euer poore with warre maintaind Then bondage euer riche with peace still gaind. By this they sie an armie to appeir Before their face and at their baks they vieu The Lord of Lorne with all his troups drau neir By secreit by-waes led, them to perseu Whereat they stand amaz'd vntill, they heire Their Lords wise hardie resolutioun treu Whoe thus to cheir and confort them began Fear not their slight for do the worst they can, Wee shall esheu their craft their hate their force Then he commands his brother to depairt And Lennox Erle with them ane hundreth horse Douglas and Hay vnto the contrair Airt With equall number bend their speedie course Now freinds quod he eche bear a valliaunt hearte And fleing fight and fighting flie your foes For your braue flight hew forth your wais with bloes. So our's shal be the Glorie of this day And wee with fame returne but thay with shame We with the rest will likewais hold oure way Betuixt their armeis so shall we reclame Oure life and honor whiche thay count their pray Yea and perhaps er long may pay thame hame This said all Thrie thrie sundrie way's oppose Their Warlick breists gainst thousands of their foes.

Beneath the knights good suord the fourt soone dyis Death after him that flees wes quicklie sent This strattagem the Prince doth sone devyse To learne to sie and know his foes intent He on this horse in this knight arms doth Rise And to his foes bak as a freind he went His knight he their Commands for to soiurne Till he againe dead or alive Returne This bak agane a Myll he had not gone When as he meits the Forward of his foe Come with a spedie marche that way anone And them before a hundreth knights and moe Come towards him before all these allone A senting Slewth hound coms with Squyars two The hound his owne he knew without all dout Which by his foes was broght to find him out.

But him commands in haist to kill that hound Which he him self could not abide to doe Hard by a Forrest couered all the ground Whoes treis our all the Rockie montans Bow Hither they flie where such dark ways they found As from their foes their saiftie did allow Thus mockt and scornd, the armie turns againe With lose and Shame their travell spent in vaine. Caput. 11. The Argument. Hells damnd fiends finds Scots renouned King And by three theeues works him a niew dispight, To God he praies who graunts his iust designe. Through deserts wild alone he flies by night, He findes his men at last, whom he doth bring. On his proud foe who slawghterd fear's his might Winter maks both their Camps brak vp at last At hunts greate Bruce a fearfull danger past. Infernall Pluto Missing his Intent Began to rore his voice his words confound From whoes foull throat such thundring noise forthwent As schook the hel resovnding throw the ground His Bowells deip a mistie smook foorth sent Which made the Soules in endles Torments bond To dive in floods and in the flams to hide them Eschewing paine whill greater paines abide them, His dreadfull looks effrayd the feinds and Ghosts Chokt with the savour of his noysum breath Like fleghts of Crows Hell musters forth her hosts, From Herebus with horor feare and death, In clouds of daungers on our Northern coasts, They raine the bloodie tempests of theire wrath And scatred here and there, they soon untwinde The webs of Woe, wouen in each sinfull minde And one of them eu'ne then did hap to light On Robbers thrie that in this forrest lay Wheirthrou the valiant Bruce had tane his flight Him [illeg.] they whom they count an easie pray For which greate Eduard ritche rewards had heght Wheirfore their Treassone thus they did essay Myldlie they come vnto that noble Prence And vous to spend their lives in his defence. They Scotts-men war by right his subiects too Which to their treasoun ads more credit still Dark night to shroud the rest which they wold doo Heauins siluer walls with sabill hingings fill Within this fortest stood a Schiphirds croo No other ludging were they neir vntill Thither those theius this noble Prince furth guid And with their Schift a supper soone prouid. When hee right pleasandlie hand tane repast Of viands such as tyme wold then affoord On the cold earth he lays him doune at last A sheld for pillow serud this noble Lord When thousand cairfull thoghts were ouerpast Sleips charning rod of silence him restord Vnto a slumber, soft but whill he lay He thoght he hard a voice him threatning say. Though careles of they self heauins for thee care Vp vp arise from daunger the defend Whaerat he starts aloft begines to stare When as he seis com from the houssis end The Robbers thrie that with their swords prepare Death on his Knight and him in sleip to send But with his sword he their designment braks And with his foot his faithfull knight awaiks, Yet or he could arise one of the thrie Vnto him step't and with his trenshant blad He forc'd his soull furth from his brest to flie Which in the Prince both greif and anger bred And in his wrathe his death so venged he That of these Traitours thrie he soone was red Then thanks he God who saift him from that snare And thence depairts loadned with greif and care. Wheir as his horse was feiding their he goes Whill as the darknes sum what cleirer greu And being monted then no way he knoes And yet from thence him self he soone with dreu Yea oftentims him self him self did lose In desarts wyld in paths but vsed by feu Reuoluing still within his troubled thoght What greuons cair's proud fortun had him wroght At last beseching his great Lord of Grace To pitie him and confort to him send His earnest praier cleius heauins starrie face And at Jous throne for mercie did attend Whoe bends his gratious eies on mortalls race Vieuing their woes their waiknes weill he kend The splendour of his glorious countenance Cleir's heaune and earth and chaisd hells feinds fare hence. Earth fred of such a sinfull Burthen vild Begins to smill on heauins all glorious sphear's When from the Prince all sorou was exyld Confort from heauin to his sad soule repair's His faith had broght from his deir saueour mild Assured hope of what his soule requear's Now to that place he goes the neirest way Wheir he appointed all his men to stay. When bright Auror her treasurs had furthsought She edgd the siluer clouds with freing's of gold And hangs the skies, with Arras rarely wroght Powdred with Paarle and pretious stones vntold Then roses reid and whit from inde she broght And strou'd heauins floor most glorious to behold Yet weips she for she thinks it all to small To welcum great Apollo to her hall. Ere Sole could shine his way did him restor Wheir Edward and the Douglas did abide With all his troups that scattred wer befor With whome the Prince doth secretlie prouide For to assalt his foes so proud of yore For them he cairles kneu dispersed wide Disordred quite and scatterd heir and their Nor for him wold they look nor for him care. They all agrie yet thus he wold them cheir Braue frends (quod he) behold this happie day That shall the clouds of oure disasters cleir And bring the Garland from oure foes away Me thinks I sie fair victorie appeir To croune vs that triuphms on their decay And their hot blood ritch trophes vs aduances. Borne on the points of oure victorious lances. Me thinks vpone oure glistring creste I sie The glorious garland of the conquest worne Whill fether-futted-fame before vs flie Vpone the golden wings of Honor borne Altho nor ours their numbers greater be Yet fear them not Jehoua heighe hath sworne To yeild them in your hands that ye may steip Your thristie blaids in blood whill as they sleip This said from heauen reflected on his face A lightning beame bright shining pure and cleir His countinance shind with such heaunilie grace As lightned all about both farr and neir a Martiall furie in his breist took place Whoes sparkling did his eies with lightning cheir So that his gallant port and gracefull looks The bold conferms the faint with shame rebooks. A Guide he got whoe broght him wheir they lay Encamped in a fair and open plane And or the glorious soun could guilt the day Four hundreth he had wounded hurt and slane For these before the camp a littel way Within a village cairles did remane Yea eu'ne the camp at last they did perseu And their with slaughter did the fight reneu The fire yet stay'd within his assie coath When they began the camp for to invaid Sleip rest or silence eurie one did touch And heir and their they lay disordered Some were a sleip of wine that drunk too much And some with cards and some with dice wer led Some lasie lubbards quafd carrousis deip Till eurie drink began an endles sleep Whill thus they ly thois warreours enter in Too strik Iustiriars for to pairt the fray The wine and blood both foorth togidder rin From bak from brest or side eu'ne as they lay Half words confoosd their hollow throts within Made billowing nois their blood their breath did stay Some rise to strik some op's their, mouth to chide Those fall and these with blood chokt gasping diede Thus whill eche sword dislodg'd a hundreth liues Braue Bruce made knowne his rancour wrath and ire Squadrons he kills cuts cords and tents he riu's And for reuenge enflam'd with hote desire To ouerthrou them all alone he strius To kill the men and set the camp on fire And foreward still allone he Murthring goes giuing more deaths then wounds more wounds then bloes But as a hungrie Lion for his foode Kills thousand beasts mo then he can deuore So thou stout Edward doth their liues seclude Whom thy braue Brothers haist had past before And tredding proudlie on the multitude Thou seemest sad becaus thou findst no more Whereon to exerceis thy valor so Wishing eche trunk could raise a stronger foe. Now at an vther Parte doth enter in The conquering knight that dreidful slaughter maks So from the west the drying winds begin To cleir heauins cloudie front and stronglie braks The spoungie bann exhal'd vp by the Sunne Furth of the Germane laik which Æoll taks Vpone his wings and mousters forth in hosts Wheir with he threats to droun the northern costs. Eu'ne so this campioun driueth bak by force The multitude of armed Squadrons strong His warlik wepon kill's without remorse His eies such firie splendor dairts along As burns their hearts but fear concealls their lose All turning baks forget to venge their wrong And cairles of their shame their fame their fall They lose their liues their honor hope and all. And he that to gainestand will proue so bold As not to flie but brauelie beare it out Soone lyis he breathles tumbling on the mold Which in the rest conferms their fear and doubt Thus foreward none his furie can with hold Till with his Lord he meits wheir all the rout Assembled were and weareid nou with killing The souldiers disperst the tents were pilling. But Scots greate king who saw them cairles, care More for their gaine then conquest to prolong Causd sound retreat least some neu force repare And bring the conquest backe with shame and wrong By this the English Generall did prepare Of armed knights aboue fiue thousand strong But this braue Lord in time reteird his crew Whill as they had no lust for to persew. The worthie Bruce thus haueing payd his foe Of that disgrace which he had lait receau'd He was both lou'd and fear'd and hatit so As the iust worth of his greate deids had crau'd Yea Englands warlick Generall thogth iu woe Extold him much when he his worth perceau'd Swearing by Joue that heauins decred to raise him And in the midst of hate was forcd to praise him. Wheirfore he breaketh vp his camp that night Letting his Soldiers to their home reteire The mightie Scot to Carrick marcheth right And soiorns their the deade time of the yeare Wheir noght befell him worthie to reciet Saif once he went a hunting of the Deare For their hee thoght no foes could harme afford Since all that land obeyd him as their Lord. Now being much delighted with that sport His warlik knights were neir about him still One day vnto an forrest they resort The hart and hind with Grewhounds for to kill And he allone stai'd in a priuat sort With two swift hounds aboue them on a hill, Till all the rest were scattred farr and niere, Rousing the woods to bring him in the deere. While here he staied, three men he did espie Come from the wood with awfull countenance, Each bends a bowe and thus doth him defie, To venge the Cumings blood is our pretence Braue Sirs quod he then, first I praie you trie Me with your swords, if I can make defence, Thrie one to kill so farre were endles shame So Cowards fight, the ualiant hates such game. At these his words, their bows awaie they threw, And with their swoords they sharply him assaile, His hounds he loos'd, his sword he quickly drew, And many bloes on either hand they deale, The hounds that sie such foes their Lord persue One by the gorge vnto the ground they haile, One of the other two by this he kil'd Then kills him whom the hounds at ground still hild The third who fears such guerdon for to trie, Staied not, but soon betakes himselfe to flight Whom when these Heauen-ordained hounds espie They follow both with kien and aufull might And in a Trace they force him by and by Most furiouslie vpon the ground to light Their Lord at last from them did him reswme And striklie giv's him his deserved doome. When all his knights returnd they wondring view How heavens their Prince from danger had preserv'd To God they gaue greate thanks and Praises dew Reioysing that so braue a Lord they serv'd This did his fame throu all the land renew All wish'd him now what his great worth deserv'd Who skap'd so many Dangers they conclude Must be reserved for a greater goode. Caput. 12. The Argument. First at Glentroll doth Scotts renowned Prince Get victorie aboue the English foe Douglas at Ederfoord with valiaunce By fourtie doth a thousand overthro Then Pembrok Sews for Batrell with pretence To frie the land from longer warr and so To Lowdon-hill he brings an armie fare But vanquist, Fleis the land in greate Dispare. When in his goolden carroish Sol returns From Zenith bake into the northern starr The Ram growne proud with am'rous heat so burne That with his horns he seimis too make him warr Hils turns in tearis their milk whit Robs and murns To se them selfs so strip'd by Sol afarr Who too redresse that wrong is quicklie seen For ermins poore to cloith them all in green The Gardens pranckt with rosie buds still spring Whill Flora dalleis in her flowire bed Whom Zepheir Cowrts and swit to her doth sing Wiping away the Tears Aurora sched Whoes shril sweit notts throu all the forrests ring When Meids with grase and woods with Leavs ar cled So that the spring thus following Phebus treace Made ewre thing to look with cheirfull face When Bruce Scotts hope their confort and their Ioy With all his knights doth too the feilds repeare, Stout hardie Eduard feirles of Annoy And fortuns knight braue Douglas als wes there Whom victorie did sewintie tyms convoy Crownd with the Garlands of her golden hare And many mo all knights of highe renowne Pillars of State and Pearles vnto the Crowne Thrice nyntie knights their number were at most All marcheing furth with cheirfull Countenance Whoes worth was knowne so to their Enemeis cost As their brave Generall feard not to aduance With these against a great and mightie host And hazard all vpon a Battells chance Thus marcheth he and wold with these beginn To conquer all or lose what he hath winn. This warlik Lord when as the night drew nere Camps on a hill a strength by nature wrought And as the second morning did appeare The watch a Woman had before him broght In beggers weid whom he did straight Inqueir What her Intention was or what her thoght That way to come She answerd to betray him And that his foe wold presentlie Essay him. Pembroks braue Erle (saide she) within a myll Is come with thousands five thee to supprise That Scots and Englishe are and swears the whill That they triumphing on thy death must rise I hope quod he their hopes shall them begyll The right is ours and with the word he crys To arms to arms and in a moment their. All cled in dreadfull arms to fight prepare. The Prince without the Camp his armie drew In thrie Battalions or Squadrons strong The vangard gave he to the Douglas trew Vnder whoes standard Sixtie marcht along Expert in Arms that feats of warrs well knew The reirward too prince Eduard did belong Which also did consist of Sixtie moe That faint fearis ghostlie house did newer kno. The King him self the greate Battalion led Wherin ther stood thryce fyftie borne too fight There Scotlands, constabill, in arms was cled The worthie hay, a bold and, fearles knight. There Lenox faithfull er'le his ensigne spred There Walorous Boyd and others scorning flight All Soldiers old all weill aprou'd at arms all breathed warr and conquests loud allarms. Be they were ranckt and well in Ordre sett A cloud of men of horse of spears and scheilds Comes from a Wood, a heard of Deir besett By huntars kein to fearfull flight so yeilds Whoes horned heids a ratling noyse begett Such noyse their lances made when all the fields Were hid with Troups and ew'ne as flights of Croes Sing throw the air their haist such sounding shoes. But to the Scots when they approched nere They stood Amazd to sie there good Array Till their Curagious Genrall did them cheir With hopfull words of Conquest spoill and Pray Lo what are those said he which you sie here But Robbers which dare newer vew the day Outcasts and not trew Scots whoes warlik force You oft before haue tryde vnto their lose And tho they were there Nations flour and choise Yet are they but a handfull vnto you Gainst ew'rie one let ten them selffe oppose So they beneth Oure conquring sword shall bow At these braue words the Armie foreward goes With schouts and clamors greate and with a show A front the Douglas troupe they giue the charge Whoe was too few against these squadrons large. Yet make they nether murmur noise nor Dinn Saif Armours clash and death resounding blows, Till they had pearst these squadrons wide within. On eurie hand a streame of blood forth floes, That o're their Man-made bankes to swell begin And on their freinds they helpe to venge theer foes. For such as wounded cold not stand for paine, Falling vntimlie, were both dround and slaine. The conquering Knight with his victorious band That now hade brokin all the ranks well niere. Beholds the Clifford that still fighting stand. Whose valors, worth, he cold not but admire, For by that gallant Earls strong conquring hand Some slaine, some hurt, some forc'd were to retire, To him for iust conceaued hate, he hies, And him to bloodie mortal fight defies. Now firste when as the Bruce his foes did view, Vnder an ensigne al to march in groe, He chargd his Troups their distance to renew, And leaue more ground twixt eu'rie batel soe, In seu'rall parts they did their foes persue, One chargd a front, one to each flanke did goe. And each a solem vow had made with all, Mid-waie to meet, or by the waie to fall. On the right side firce Edward gaue essaie, Whose courage hote cold scarcely be refraind, By those more cold by his braue Troupe to staie, And yet the vallor of his foes constraind Faire Victorie aboue them both to plaie With doubtful wings, till at the last detaind By his all conquering hand beneth his sword They fall yeld, flie and tremble at his word. But Scotlands famous Champioun the while Whoes chairge he kneu was their left syid to charge Brak throu the ranks with long and bloodie toill And to his troup he made an entrie lairge Whill th'English Generall chusd their force to foill Fiue hundreth strong, with lance, with sourd, with targe. Whoes armed ranks he settes into the way Of Scotts renouned king his force to stay These at the first so feirclie doe assaill They brak the Scotts with wraith and heigh disdaine Who yeelding straight begins to bend and reill And braik their ranks nor could from flight refraine Which th'Englishe captane harringtone sau weill By whoess braue hand aught deid the nint neu slaine The standart bore: which winn he loudlie cryis The victorie is ours who yeeldis not dyis. Scotlands great campioun who this while had fought Amidst his foes and left his men behind Rushd throu the throng and this stout captane soght Whome got his head he from his shoulders twind And wan agane that standart deirlie boght With which he fordward goes wheir he did find His men dispersd but with his cheirfull words They rank them selfs and march with conquring swords The victorie recouerd thus with pane And raerlie wroung out of the English hands Earths brauest Prince leads on his troups agane The standart still he bears and throu the bands Of his proud foes he looks if they contane Some obiect worth the hyir of his demands He shaiks his sword wheirat the English quaik And shrunk oway and out of order brak. Then he espyis a littel him before Lennox stout Erle and Hays vnconquerd Lord And famous Boyd all thrie assailed sore And hemnd in by their fois, he much deplord Their danger great, and valors worthie store They shou, for to be tane they still abhord And all the ground to strou it seems they striue, With woundit men half deid and half a liue. Not fare from them he also might espy Wheit as the conquering knight with clifford stood Clifford was strong but fought too furiouslie And nou groune faint with sheidding too muche blood His cairfull band to saif their Lord wold try Thrusting betuix him and the Douglas good Yea all at once him furiourslie assaill But his vnconquerd valor doth preuaill. All this the Prince of warriours did behold And as a Lion nev cum from the wod Roring for pray espyis a scheiphirds fold His hungrie Whelps still follow houling loud Whoes sight and sound effrais the heardmen bold: Thy flie that fearfull foe resistles proud Who killeth all, tho one wold serue for food His Whelps by his example feids on blood. Euneso he cums with scarled cullored bled His conquring creu, encurage by his sight Before whoes terror threatning face they fled Yea eune greate Pembrok yeelds him nou to flight This vprore such a greate confusioun bred The English throws away their armour bright With still sad murmurs Scotts perseu their foes And noght was hard but dying Groans and bloes. From Erebus blak darknes taks her flight And spred her wings aboue ou'r half of Ground When th'English aided by the freindlie Night Ow're Hills and Daills dark wais for saiftie found And of their Natiue soill to haue a sight The greater pairt by solempt vous was bund For noght they fand in this oure barren soill But death and wounds in stead of wealth and spoill. After this victorie so rai[illeg.]lie got The choise of Princes with ane humble mind Gaue thanks to God for his successiue lot And holie vous vnto the Lord enshrind Then marching furth in haist he resteth not Till all the western cuntreis were inclind To his meik reull and with aduise more stai'd Kill, Cuningham, and Carrik, him obay'd. Whill in the West he regnd as conquerour Sir Odomer was greiud at his succes And thought he had dissolud his strongest pou'r Seing his oune atcheuments fortunles Yet fortun on ane vther wold not lour An vther captaine whoes greate worthines Had giuene good proufe in many a bloodie fight A Scotts man he, sir Phillip mubray hight Him wold he neids imploy vnto this fate And to his chairge commits a thousand horse With these to vieu Scotlands greate Kings estate And wait aduantage to imploy his forse But mightie Bruce exper'ence had of lait That strenth shall oft of craft receaue the worse And being cairfull vigilant and wise Preuents his craftie foes slie interprise. With fortuns knight tuyce tuentie furth he send To vnderstand and knou the foes desings Who haueing searchd and traueld fat in end His way him to an narrou Passage brings Called the Edderford, On eurie hand did mightie crags ascend On eurie side beloue deip marras springs And of this place he fitlie maks a choise For to ganestand or to assalt his foes Long staid he not when all his foes drew neir For by that way they neids must onlie go Stout moubray then his warlik troups did cheir Whill they curagiouslie did chairge their foe And as on Neptuns humid sky so cleir Sterne Borias to the land the walls doth blo Till waue on waue brak on the Baltik shore Whoes dying voice ou'r all the land doth rore. So eurie Rank on Rank is beaten bak By that braue count and his resistles crew Their ranks in Ordour ordourles they brak To [illeg.] Douglas. They kill the bold and fliers faint persew All gois to death they none to mercie tak And with meir strenth and valor overthrew Their foes at last and forced all with might Nor can their captaine stay their fearfull flight, But Moubray stout wise valiaunt fearles bold Whoes words nor deids lets not his men to flie Scornd such a flight, nor could his foes with hold His Resolution Acted constantlie Forththrou their ranks he doth his wey vnfold Wheir much blood doth his sterne wrath satisfie At last he lost his brand and shund the fight Els had he yeildit captiue to their might. His fanting troups fled home the way they came Which when he vieud vpone the vther side Such raige and furie did his breist inflame As he wold neids returne and wold abide Gainst all his fois but that could no way frame For want of wapins forst him turne aside Whill as the count whoes deids ar eu'r glorious Triumphing to his Prince returns victorious. His Prince that nou was vnder Loudon hill And all that cuntrie to his Peace had broght These Losses all great Pembroks ear's did fill And sets fierce rage on edge for this he thoght If Scottlands King had fortun thus at will Englands intendit Conquest turns to noght Wherefore this motione has vnto him sent By which their wraith should soone or neu'r be spent. He bids him vnder Loudon hill prepair To giue him Battell on the tenth of may And if the Conquest fell to Scottlands shair England sould quite the land that verie day And neu'r returne to clame a conquest their But if the English wan without delay Then yeild he should vnto fair Englands Prince And at his sentence stand for his offence. To this the graue wise worthie Bruce agreis And for that day great Preparation maks But with greate foresight wiselie he foreseis How that his mightie foe aduantage taks Of multituds of men and lairge suppleis Whoes endles numbers his meane forces braks For which thrie walls he raises wondrous hie Eunt their wheir as the battell fought should be. And in the midst he leans a Plaine so wide, As hundreths fiue might martch &amp; feight at ease, At euerie ende laie Marrasis beside, So at their back, they could no forces raise, Thus onely here he wold his foes abide, Let Fortune, froune or fauour whom she please, But twise three hundreth march'd with him along Altho his foes were full seauen thousand strong. Syr Odomer the bold doth keip the day And marched brauelie vnder Lowdon low He puts his warlick armie in array Whill as the king of men him self doth show With his small pour his passage for to stay His hardie knights the art of warr did know These oft approu'd so oft had tryde their might He neids not to encurage theme to fight Yet Earths great Warriour restles still did raunge Now here, now there his restles troups among Kindling their breasts to hote and new reuenge. Of olde done Deeds, and long receaued wrong, The Captains of his troups he need not chaunge. For these were matchles, hardy, wise &amp; strong, The worthie Douglas and the valiant Haye, Edward the firce impatient of delaie. Whoe with his troup did first assail the foe For his fierce wrath could brook delay no more How soone this angrie Prince him self did sho Terror and feare went sadlie him before As when strong winds doth caus heighe tyds to flo Whoes brackish waus still beat the brokin shore Seas smoth back rold before with gentle breath In briffels set, spits forth his foamie wreath. Soe after furious Edward all the plaine Was ouer-run with Ranks of spears &amp; shields, Horse, armour, weapons ecchos aye againe The dreadful noise that Drumme &amp; Trumpet yeilds Strife, Terrour, Rage, follow both Hoasts, anon Death softens armour and strong weapons weilds, Furie and Strife stalks through the hoasts with fire Of deadly wonds kindled with blood-blown Ire. Now both the armeis iusteling roodlie met And spears and sheilds gainst spears and shelds opposd Strength answerd strength &amp; wound for wound they get Swords targets piks with piks swords targets closd Then Tumult coms to heauin her head she sett And from her throt a thousand sounds she lousd That throu the Air confusdlie Iarring roar Such sound greate waters send from brokin shoar. Or as when Raine by nights blak tempests borne Doun from heighe Rocks and mountans to the plane Stons earth and treis vp by the roots hath torne Till streams and all in one pit fall agane Whoes bullring noyse when cums the pleasant morne The herdmen frights that with their floks remane Such sounds their conflict yeilds and throu the aer Sends clamors groans and all th'affects of fear. But thou braue Eduard was the first did wound And wounding kild and killing did affright Thy Enemeis whill through the troupe redound The neus of thy greate deads, which raise on hight Thy soldiers hairts; their valor did abound With aufull strenght resistles still they fight And thou bold Hay aduentrouslie did venter Heuing a way nixt for thy troups to enter The woes Hay wroght, an English lord their brings Whoe wonders at his deids, at last in wrathe A darte he sends that to his labors sings And weill neir broght with it a haistie death Persing his Curace from his breist out springs A streame of blood neir wheir his life took breath Wheir with the throuer call's, now do not bost If thou has kild, thy blood appease their Ghost. My blood quod he cums from an honord wound But this kein dairt from ane deceitfull hand To tell me of thy treasone it did sound And vows to ayme more right at my command By this the English campeoun was bound With chains of death no longer could he stand Death child his blood and strength within his vains For lo the Schaft send bak had perst his breans. The warlick English Generall seis him fall And thrusts vnto the front or face of fight His brand he shaks so dreadfullie with all That many fanting schrunk out of his sight But oure bold Hay wold not his steps recall Whoes honord marche reproou'd their shamefull flight And for him self he wisheth death were ny So that braue Imp of Englands race might dy, The conquering knight this while had march'd so fare And led his troups so brauelie on his foes That their they yeeld vnto the chance of warr Their ranks sore shakkin now much ground they lose Bak went the first their ordour quite they marr And then the Scotts with clamours hudge arose Some stuffs the chase whoes breists with curage boild And other some drew furth the deid and spoild. Greate Odomer of all this nothing knew Whoe being woundit by the valiant Hay Enraged like a sauage bore he grew And with a fureous blow he doth him lay Senceles to ground, and off his helmet flew Yea surlie this had bein his laitest day But that he saw his side go to the worse And turns to stay their flight his en'meis force. He haisteth furth and shaems to sie their foill Whoes cheirfull count'nance maks them all returne Against the Scotts whoe still dispysd their toyll And thikning their instructed pour's they burne With hote desire, of their expected spoill And in that verie place wold they soiurne Whill as the light was pent vp in the skyes With swartish clouds of dust that did aryse. Eu'ne as in Mills wheir Graine is ground non may Stand neir for dust blowne vp by breathing aer That turns to paled hew their bright array So from returning troups and squadrons faire The clouds of dust suted the Scotts in gray Now fights the English fierslie to repare Their faults; the Scotts wold keip what they had winn Both sides stands firme and freshlie doth beginn Bold hay recouered of his trance agane With angrie shame did venge him of his foes Searching for him that left him so in paine Many their lifes for their lordes fault did lose Whill he on wereid killing did remane And gainst wholle trowps he doth him self oppose Whoes good example cheirs eche englishe band And to their bold lordes work they boldlie stand. Weill bakt with trowps this Mars-like man coms in Whos deids strook feare through all the Scottish host Who lossing ground to flight doth nou begin But Edward, Douglas, Haye and Boyd doth cost, Along their troups and here and there doth rinn, Praising the bold and cowards still they boast, Yet their braue deids preuaileth more then cries In leaders deeds, the souldiers confort lies. But worthie Bruce, their harts with courage fills, A cloud of Knights with spears &amp; shields he brings, And as when sheepheards sees from tops of hills, A cloud broght from the sea on Eurus wings, Amazd they stand, and gaze against their wills, While heauen on earth a smoakee darknes wrings, Which drawing neire to them, affrighted then, They dreue their heards into some couert den, So darkning Earth with spears, with swords, with shields They came, and in their breast a tempest broght, To whose apparent wrath the English yeilds For they had seein what these before had wroght, Of their left wing they quite had scourd the fields, Thus quickly they resolue, and with a thought, All yeilds to flight, and down their weapons threw Scotts kill anb chase til night her conrteins drew. Caput. 13. The Argument. Bruce falleth sick neir to the Northern Shore Tho armie mutines for his sore diseas Whom at that instant heauins to speich restore Els all had dyit his speich doth all appease They fight with Buchans Erle and thence they bore Their Lord in spight of foes their camp they raise Auld-Meldrums Battell brings his health agane He wins Sanct Iohnstoun with a subtill trane.

Hereafter we will think on this your loue When heaune to wonted health shall vs restore Whill thus he spak the lightning beams did moue Of maiestie his sparkling eies before That all the armie who did lait approue Wraith folie Raige, sheams with repentaunce sore, Bak to his tent he goes his soldiers kind Cry all go too go too to fight inclind. By this their proud and mightie foe drew neir Whoes number ten to one did them surmount Yet martch they on whill ech did vther cheir Nor neid their captans do as they had wount Their to menace or to encurage heir But rather forcd to stay by wise atcount Their too too foreward haist for still they cry Let eurie One a rebell kill or dy. The rebells se them disapointed clein Their hearts begin to faint their hands to faill The royall armeis trumpets soundet bein, And valiantlie they gan for to assaill, The fois so great a Multitude ver sene, They shame a handful should their curags quaill; Thus eche on vther rusht with furous might First wounds then blood then death aproch'd their sight. Greate deids of Arms on ether side were shoune Till Phebus piteing such vnkindlie warre Shrunk doun anone on siluer skyis were throune Dark sabill clouds that thikned all the air Than by the rebells the retreat was bloune Which made the royall hoist seim sade with cair Nor wold reteir till by their leaders au Their forcd within their trinches to with draw. Four daies within their camp still they remand Four dais their foes encamped in their sight No day did pas wherein they once refraind From skirmish hot and many singil fight At last the royall armie was constraind To raise their camp and for to martche fourth right For victualis in their camp were waxing small Nor Phisick helps their kings diseas at all. He in a glorious chariot ritchlie wroght Goes in the mids they marching round about In Battell rank and all their Baggage broght Within the formest ranks thus all the rout still reddie was to fight if theirto soght Their foes perceiud their resolutioun stout And for that time they thoght not good to moue the But follou still at vnwarrs to proue them. Eduard the fierce whill his deir brother lay Ou'r all the royall armie did command Wheir with he martcht a soft and easie way By Citeis faire through mony a fertill land At last he causd the armie for to stay In Marrs renowind schire wheir as he fand A willaige situat one a pleasant plaine Wheir walthie Ceres, treasure doth remaine. This famous toun Eururie heght to name Famous for that greate victorie obtaind By Bruce vnto his foes eternall shame For in this toun for health whill he remaind Buchans bold erle still thristing efter fame From vrging Battell could not be refraind Within two mylls besyid old Meldrum long Vpon a hill he lay encamped strong. A chosin band with Brechius Lord he send At vnawarrs his Princelie foe to find Whoe of his long diseas began to mend Whoes haughtie mind was neu'r to rest inclind His armies forward at the village end. Encamped lay of foes that had no mind Whill Brechins Lord against their wills wold will them Battell to giue or in their tents to kill them. But he and all his chossin crew discryi'd Hade bene by them when neir to them he drew Whoe fand not as he hopt faire Scotlands guyde Vnwars nor yet vnreddie to persew These that espyid him for the fight prouide All rankt in ordour furth their wapins drew And tho their foes were farr the stronger might They boldlie byde the Battell and the fight But these so few that could not long indure Wer forc'd with lose for to reteir at last Whill swift report with Informatioun sure Of their succes vnto the King had past Which did his wonted curage so procure As vp h'arois and calls for armour fast His Lords wictheld him till he cryed aloud His health was only gaind by thretnings proud, His owne cheif Guard he with his brother send To hold them play till he the armie broght Whoe boldlie met them forcing them in end To flie and by that meins their saiftie soght He following to their camp did them attend Wheir Buchans erll still freting in his thoght Ledd furth his troups vnto a valey wyde Wheir stronglie rank't, the batell wold abyde, By this the King was cum whoe thoght it best Eune then to Ioyne and giue a furious charge Him self aduancing fare before the rest Let Horror, Terror, Fear, and Death at large Wheirwith the rebells hearts were sore possest Dismaid they fant their deutie to discharge They flie, his looks prents feir in euerie harte Euin so our stars their influence doth imparte Few was their left vnkill'd vnto the chaise The erll and Moubray vnto England fled But neu'r returnd whill for their worthines The King gaue Buchans schire thus conquered As soldiers pray wheir plentie did incres Such store of wealth from thence the armie led As eune the poorest soldier for his shair Boght lands and ritche possessiouns to his heyre. All the greate north now to his peace was broght Erlls Lords and Barrons were his liegmen sworne Touns Citeis Castells strengths vnto him soght And still their oaths with presents ritche adorne Benorth the famous Grangeben was noght One schire but his myld yok had glaidlie borne Then bak to Anguse he his armie guyds And to reduce that pleasant land prouids. Forfars strong hold did Fraser of Platane Recouer from the English by a traine Then all trew Scotts to shew them selfs begane And with some worthie seruice peace t'obtaine Atholls bold Erll Brechin both Seigd and wane And broght that Lord vnto his Prince againe Thus both the Merns and Angus did obey him No foe was sein from conquest for to stay him. Then sodainlie to perth, he marchd and raisd Strong men made walls about thoes walls of stone Wher with encompast round they stood amazd Yet did resolue to yeild at last to none Ther pouer was such as all ther feir apeasd Ther strength was such as broght ther curaige one But this their pouer and this ther strength agrie To bring them to ther end with imfamie. For being two within for one without And heauing so impregnabill a hold They fedd securitie and banist dout In wain greate Bruce had spent his soldiers old Who had reneud th'assault ther walls about In thryce seuine dayis full sewintie tyms, so bold As, of nyne hundreith thryce, he with him broght Six hundreith soldiers he had lost for noght. Wheir for by offering peace he tryd their might Since nether strength nor force culd them supprisse Their Walls was built of such a wondrous hight On which strong, Tours their entrie still denise The Ditches war so brode and deiplie dight Wheirin Tayis flood vp too the brinks did rise Still in thoes Touris and all thois Walls along War armed men aboue five thousand strong. Then after he two months had staied before The walls in haist he raisd his seige at last Wheir with the Citizens with threatnings sore Wold brag and taunt the armie as they past But Scotlands campeoun wishd nothing more Then this their insolence and noght agast With silence he reply'd nor minds to stay them For ten to one he hops or long to pay them. Thrie dayes the armie marcheth to the west Till they ariue within ane forrest faire And their the King commands greate Treis to cast Wheir of they ledders mak and doth prepare Bake to returne thus secretlie they past The way they came by night nor whispring are Of their approche let furth the meanest sound Till they arriue hard at the ditch profound. Weill knew their Lord the way that they should go For he him self had markit it before A schald he found into the ditch belo And he for to encurage them the more First wydeth ou'r and on his shulders two The longest and the lairgest Ledder bore His shulders bred Iumpt with the waters crop Yet ou'r he goes and setts his ledder vp. Eche one admeird and woundring prais'd the deid This Frenshman was Thomas of Longouell.But most of all a Frenshman standing by And all into the water leapt with speid Raising their ledders to these walls so hie The King first montis with weill deserwing meid All mounted then and none did them discrie For all securelie sleipt nor feard offence The doubtfull night yet had not parted thence, Their Glorius Ensigns on the walls they spred Then to the dreadfull work of death thay fall Death that throw eurie Street his troups furthled Whom by their names heighe Tumult furth doth call Sorrow in Sabill Clouds all muffilled With cankred care came murning first of all Then Infant pitie weiping then Dispare Then Horror, Terror, Error, Pain, and Fear. Fear that ran witles heartles bloodles faint And trembling like ane espin leaf did quaik Base shame and drousie Slouth that gaip and gant Sadnes that set in secret wyes hir wrak And thousands mo in nature discrepant Eche one from these and all came heir to sack The wofull Toune their gredie pansche to glut And Warr to eurie one his Morsell cut. Warr that with her led laules leud Enormitie Rapt, Reiuing, Wrong, Raige, Discord, and Jmpietie Sakt, Sacraledge and sin in one conformitie Atheismie dispising Faith and scorning Deitie Wrathe Anger, Hate, and monstrous Deformitie That Laus Aer[illeg.]s, Maners Marrs and braks societie Poore Pouertie and waistfull Desolatioun Life turnd in bloodie Deaths sad Transmigratioun. These fill the toune and send a dreadfull sound Vp to the heauine with clamors rapts and cryis Tears mixt with blood ouerflo the streits a round Warrs bloodie arms lift clouds aboue the skyis Of deid groand sighs, delighting in eche wound Her looks ar lightning from her eies that fleis Her Jron feitt shak Touns and Tours asunder The roaring of her voice is dreadfull Thunder. All night this fearfull Massacre did lest Till Titan cround Olimpus top with fire Then death and all this hellish creu addrest Them selfs to flight to darknes they retire And in a sabill cloud them selfs they plac'd Then to the west they flie with Night their sire And all the way they went they left a track That did infect the air with vapors blak This they once gone both blood and slaughter ceast All that wold yeeld was then to mercie tane Stratherns old Erle got by his sones request His Princes peace tho he wold not abstane To help the toun for with the King at least His sone remaind nor wold from him refrane And then the toune was leuelled with the ground The walls war raized the ditches fild around. Caput. 14. The Argument. The feild of Cree feirce Edwards praise beginn He beats with fiftie fiftein hundreth foes The thrid time Douglas doth his castell winn Then Bonkill, Randolph, Huntleis Lord doth lose The bloodie and the cruell fight of Linn The first two Douglas taks frie Gordone goes Greate Bruce doth Lorne to his obedience bring The virgin-Tour is Randolphs conquesing. Shrink not deare Muse nor rest thy restles Team Tied to the labors of this endles storie Pend in the narrow path of treuths poore theam Wind in these Laborinths yet be not sorie Because that Phebus baies thou dares not cleam Nor range abroad for gaine nor hunt for glorie Nor with smooth Uenus, sweitest songs can sport the But heir rude Mars harsh iarring must consort the. Thou art not heir set in an open plaine Wheir as thou may in eurie pairt be bold To wantonez or like the horse of Spaine Who bursts the helter erst that did him hold Scouring the medous heir and their amaine Coruets and leaps with curage vncontrold Nor drinks thou heir of Heliconian fontains But walks throu barren creiks and bo'lls of Montains. Be north the banks of Sea-like-forth did bow All in obedience to their natiue King When in Brigantia called Gallo'way now The English raige and mightelie did regne To wit Edward.Wherefore the ferce knight boldlie doth auow That cuntrie in subiectioun for to bring And thither with his brothers leaue he goes Small was his trine but many war his foes. When he ariud within this pleasant land Euene all with sword and fire he did distroy He hight that our the English did command Sir Jngrhame Omphraueill whoes greatest ioy Was still his foes by battell to with stand Whoe ay vnto the Scotts did much annoy Experience long had made him wise and bold Cuning in feats of Warr in counsall old, Furth then this mightie man the English broght And did a mightie Armie soone prouide Of which when Edward hear's he feareth noght But on the banks of Cree wold them abide Cree a water or reuer in galway.Tho thy were ten to one that to him soght Yet cair'd he not for these whom he did guide Wer worthie men whoes valour weill he knew With ten of whome he tuentie wold persew. At this fair flood his foes he neids wold stay The stream was to his bake a rampeir strong The soothern now at Butell Castell lay From which they broght her armed force along Wise Omphrauell still marcht in good aray. Fearing some traine thoes hills and daillis among Whill Edward choosd betuix the toure and stream A valey fitt for bloodie Mars his geam. And when the warlick English cums in sight Fearce Edward furth his bands to battel brings Tho feu yet famous whoes greate valors might My long spent Muse groune hoars but harshlie sings Both sids approcheth futiouslie to fight Their bloodie raige throu all the montains rings Send furth by Drums and Trumpets roaring cryis Which Roks and Montains Echoes through the skyis. As two stout Rams when Jelous haits infus'd In their hote Renis a front two fleissie floks Meit with their horned heads to pushe inus'd And rush on other with still ceasles knoks So meits those armeis and with bloes confus'd Their arms resounds and with tempesteous schoks Earth rius but when dread Wrathe her drouth remembers Sche's drunk with blood &amp; cled with marterd m?bers. For the fierce champione gius so fierce a chairge His foes vn ablle longer to resist Shrink bak at last and brak their ranks at lairge Some fleis some falls some fight some freinds assist Altho their warlik Gen'rall did dischrage A gen'ralls pairt yet neids he not t'insist For nather words nor martiall deids at all Could hearts from fear nor feit from flight recall. Whereat he taks such Indignatioun great That shameing of their deids and scorning flight He last abyds and with a braue dispite This was the generall of the English armore calid sir ingrem emphranell. Assalts his foes with onresisted might With him a cornet staies for to indite Their fellous shame in their death-wishing fight And their braue Lord with this small band assisted His foes fierce wrathe with manlie brest ressisted, But as a bush of Saplings tender crops Is soone cut doun by Pesants vndertakin Eu'ue so their gilded casks and ploomed tops Fell doun like blasted leaus all winter shakin And yet their Lords braue valor vnder props Their yeilding strenth their dieing spreits, t'awakin But hemmid in with multitude at length All deis that yeilds not to such pourfull strength. Their Generall non that seis no help at all Scorns to be tane and maks a worthie choise Frie must he go and leiue or die he shall Dieing the best with him his life must loise Thus all his strongest pours he doth recall And braks furth throw the thikest of his foes Hewing a way for four that folloud still Whoe by his valor skaipt deaths endles Ill. Fierce Edward come eune as they took the flight Who being loth they should escaip so frie Still follous them but now they cam in sight Buttell Castell a strong hoild in gallaway.Of Buttell Castell to the which they flie This strength Inpregnabill they wan ere night. Yet for to force them Ishe immediatlie He causd some troups beneth their castell wall To bring away their heards their floks and all, But all availls not their they must remaine Till Englands King with forces them releiue Bold Edward seiged the castell but in vaine In thrice two weiks he could them nothing griue Till Englands mightie King at last did gaine Sir Odomer de Wallange to reuiue Old hate, and came in Scotland to reuenge Long passed harms but doth his oath infrenge He onlie fiftene hundreth with him broght To rais the seige and to releiue his freind Edward gatt word of his intendit thoght Whoes armie skant but hundreths thrie conteind The choise of which but fiftie furth he soght With these weill horsd his foe he thus preueind Ten leagues from thens within a forest learge He staies at onawars his foe to chairge, Tims restles hours vndoes the Gates of day. All quikning bright Apollo wold be gone Whoes golden tressis gilds with glistring ray The toples tops of famous Lebanone When English Odomer was on his way And being come within the wod anone Fierce Edward wold haue charg'd such was his rage If noght with held by graue aduise of aige. As hungrie Rauening Wolfs that do intend To pray on flocks by Schipherds call'd to fold In Paths vnknowne their silent way they bend Their fetherd feitt by winges of hope made bold Farr of they follow warlie till in end Occasioun quiklie by the top they hold So follow these their foes vnto the plaine Whoe still securlie marcht nor feard their traine. And on them now they sett with curage stout With shouts and cryis they mak a fearfull sound Their first assalt disordred all the rout With lancis stiff they bore them doune to ground Who feard they were an armie great no dout So suddan furie doth the thoghts confound But their braue Lord sir Odomer suspected Their craftie gyll the which he thus detected. Ah fear them not quod he I know their trains I know their craft I know their force their might We twentie ar wheir one of them remains Ah villans this is but a sillie slight Come yow shall haue your weill deserued pains In your owne netts your selfs ar taine full right Com we at for yow come receaue your bloes I sie yow long your wretched lius to lose. Nou nou oure swords shall all those wrongs amend Bold, Odomer, with visage sterne cryes out And sindrie of his troups with him contend To force them bak but they with curage stout An ansuer sharpe on points of launces send Who broght by this an vther course about Fierce Eduard then with suord and sheild so hollow Cuts doun their ranks wh? blood &amp; death did follow. From his sterne looks his fearfull foes withdrew Their eies that winkt which clouds of night bedims Their fanting hearts distills a bloodie dew Deaths thriefold horror through their ears still swims Their feit seme light to flie fant to persew A shevering cold throw all their bodyis clims Yea at his verie sight his foes resemble The Seggs or reids in fens with wind that tremble. And now no more their captane they obey His aw seims nothing to their aufull foe Altho them selfs were willing for to stay Their legs hearts hands vnto their will said no All go to flight and heir and their doth stray Their Lord altho vnwilling neids must go He shams to England whill he heasts with speid That he had brok his vow for such a deid. Victorious Eduard to the Seige retornd Whill omphrauell that hears this ouerthro Knew that proud fortun now her bak had tornd Whoes smylls were chaingd to frouns remeidles we Wheirfore he yeilds the strength wheir he soiornd With passage frie in England for to go To this ferce youth now all the land obeys None his commands nor his behests gainseys. Whill thus he raignd and rewled ouer all His valiaunt brother that all conquring King The Lord of Lorns old hate he did recall Which all in one his angrie pour's did bring His Heralds gius the camp but leasur small To Lorne to Lorne their proclamatioun sing But all this time the worthie Douglas goes Victorious still amongst his armed foes. Douglas strong tour essais he first of all And fiftie load of hay in saiks weill bound He causd to driue hard by the Castell wall This capten heght wobtoune.The Captane hoping victualls to haue found Isht with his troups whome or he did recall He seis that conquering knight so mouch renound Betuixt him and his strength who now with might Wold force him ather for to flie or fight. And thus the Scotts assaill with rageing mood Whom long the English valiauntlie withstands Till like a Lion wet with luke warme blood The Douglas slops their ranks and braks their bands He heauid his sword aboue their heads wheir stood Both life and death that vrgd him with demands But as his furie led him all to kill Fear led them for to shun remeidles Ill. Wobtoun him self dyit by his valiaunt hand Wobtoun that captane was of all the rout This wobtoun was inioynd by his mistres to keip thee venterous Castell of Douglas anzeir befoir she wauld fauour him which in Iuncktione was found in a letter gottin on him when he was sleane. The rest from him that fled no mercie fand All dy't, yea eune the fearfull with the stout Nor wall nor tour nor Castell let they stand All throune to ground the dirchis fild about Greate Douglas fame now fleis ou'r all the land All yeilds to him ou'r all he doth command. All Douglas Daill and Etrik Forrest faire And Jedburch to their natiue Prince then soght But the Lord Steuart Bonkills only heyre A man that valors rairest fructs furth broght Was chairgd by Englands King for to repare Gainst fortuns knight for this great wrongs he wroght The Lord stewart of bu[illeg.]kill risith agenst the douglace Whoe with him broght the valiaunt Randolph furth And bold Sir Adam Gordone much of worth. With these and fiftie more he came to view The land and how the people stood affected But worthie Douglas of their cuming knew Their secret drifts to him were all detected Then after them he softlie did persew And folloud them a fair still vnsuspected Till they at night reteird vnto ane Inn Was ritchlie bult vpon the banks of Linn. Then round about the house his men he set And threatned fire till they came thronging foorth With bloodie fight then both the pairteis met And both did proue the vtmost of their worth Thus Scotts against the Scotts were hardlie set A crewell fight, Nor was their anye their of English birth Greate is the heat and furie blouis the fire Wheir freinds against their freinds ar moued with Ire. Greats pitie was to view this wofull fight Still was the killer kill'd yet none wold flie The Douglas partie was of greater might Yet still the vthers fight and fighting die At last when death and slaughters at the hight Of fiftie none was left aliue but thrie That with the Stewart came and Douglas lost Of fiftie twis[illeg.] neir sixte six all most. Bonkills bold Lord that could no more defend With Randolph and with Gordone steps aside And soune was horst to flie but lo in end The Douglas did so weill for that prouide Their way was stept what course so eu'r they bend Sir Adame Gordone leads and was their guide Who with a disperat hazard braue and bold Braks throu his foes and saiff his way doth hold, The vther two did to the Douglas yeild Who intertaind them as his freinds most deir He manie days theirafter keept the feild But sawe no enemie at all appeir Yet neu'r Irkt he armour for to weild Wheirfore vnto his Prince he wold reteir Who now was on his Iournay Lorne to vew Yet to the Camp he came are any knew Eu'ne to the royall Tent swift fame had borne The news of his approache vnto the King Who from his throne rose like the glorious morne And to him says my thoghts were combatting If my loue'd Erlle did leiue, or died forlorne And with his arms about his neck did hing Whill as he kneild my gratious Prince said he I leiue if in your grace, if noght I die. Much more they said at last the knight presents Randolph was his sister sone.His prisoners vnto his royall Prence Whoes loue, his Nephew too too soune preuents, With speiches proud and spit'full conferrence But wisdome myld and graue with raige conuents And stai'd wrath haisting death for his offence Yet Bonkills Lord and he's to prison sent Wheir they must stay till Lorns new warre bespent. But now the Lord of Lorne that cleirlie knew Of their approach so weill did him prouide By schip him self on sea the sight wold view And left two thousand on the land beside That to a montans tope them self withdrew Which did that cuntrie by it self diuide And vnderneth that hill the passage lay So that the arme's forst to pas that way. The King that of them had intelligence Sends Douglas furth with him a chosen band Who with much paine but schort continuance Had winn their baks by hid wais which they fand Now comes the armie to the strait and thence They sie their foes aboue all armed stand On crags, and hurld doun mightie stons from hie And thence they lat their clouds of arrous flie. Wherefore an vther chosen band intend With valiant Hay to giue the chairge before Of these the stons broght many to their end And some returnd leamd briusd and wonded sore Yet to his foes bold Hay did still ascend Still formest to encurage them the more And tho but feu in spight of all their foes They wan the montains heighest top with bloes. But surlie their eche one had losd his life Their foes so hudge encompast them about If Douglas, who with labor pane and strife Had not arriued with his resistles rout But then o then bloes, wounds, and deaths were rise Long faught they long was victorie in dout But Douglas now gan on his men to froune Becaus they were so long vn-ouerthroune Then with the strongest ranks it faireth worce His sword their maks a wide and bloodie laine He treds them kild and wounded by his force Who yeeldeth leius, all that resists ar slaine So kill's a hound the cur without remorse That bits when he that yeelds his life doth gaine Oure knight still kills the armd with best assistance And scorns t'assaill but wheir he finds resistance, Good valiaunt Hay that through the rout furthwent Fand matchles Douglas dealling deaths anew And to his side he step't incontinent A hardie freind bold constant wise and trew These two once mett were all sufficient A greate and mightie Armie to subdew Yea thogh bold Hay had bidden from the fight Douglas allone had put them all to flight. At Iast discomfeit all doth flie away Doune to a tumbling riuer deip and read They past a bridg that our this riuer lay Which they wold cut of danger to be fred But of their work they did them quiklie stay And gaue so fierce a chairge till thence they fled By this one bridg the Armie past the flood And fand from thence that no man them with stood. A wondrous strength was their Dunstaffage heght The vanquest rebells mand this fortres strong But with a Seige inuirond hard and straight They forced ar to yeeld it vp or long The Lord of lorn was sone to the Erll of Argill. Argills old Erle a man of wondrous might Got peace whoes sone had done such endles wrong Then all submit them selfs the King before Eu'ne all the Lords along the westerne shore. All faithfull Scotts reioise of his succes And forto shew their iust conceaud Ire Their craftie foe by craft they wold supres Still when occasioun winkd at their defire Amongst the rest that shew his willingnes A contrey suaine their duelt in Lithgo shire That was both fearles hardie strong and bold He to his natiue Prince some seruice wold. A peill or strength by Lithgo lake their stood That held in aw the countrie round about A hundreth English with their captane good Comands the strength well fortified about This contrey cloune, oft for their horses food With prouender and hay came in and out Fiue sones he hade as bold as was their sire Thrie brether borne and bred in Mars his ire. And these weill arm'd within a wane he set And cuninglie he couerd them with Hay Then driueth furth his wane straght to the gate Wheir he ariued with the morning gray The porter rose and in the wane he let This driuer Binny heght who made no stay But to the porter lept and soone dispatchd him Then furth he lets the rest whill nothing fashd him. And soone them selfs they throw the chambres spred Some sleipt some armd and naiked some they fand But all their liues at length they quiklie red None that resists could their rude rage with stand Thret tien were to the captains chalmer fled Who with him tho vn armd thes houses mand But tours nor walls could not preuent their smerte Mild pitie dualls not in a Curish heart. The King returnd from Lorne did weill reward This binnie for so hazardous a deid Then of his nepheu Randolph heth regaird For still his loue his Anger did exceid Morais great Erldome he for him prepaird Of whom hereafter he might stand in neid And sure his worth is worthelie renound A brauer knight neu'r tred vpone the Ground. Whoe being to his vncle reconceild Wishd oft within his haughtie heart, to sho Some peice of rarest seruice in the feild Whoes fame his former faults might far outgo Fortun eu'ne then did fit occasioun yeild Whereby the King his willing mind should kno Nine prouinces with England yet did stand Besouth the siluer Forth eu'ne all the land. Obeid to Englands King but onlie thrie Iedbrughe and Etrik and fair Douglas dail These by the mightie Douglas conquerd be Gainst whose all couquring arme none could preuaill In all these lands braue Randolph weill did sie Many strong holds and castells to assaill Amongst the which was one whoes strenth exceld The Uirgin-tour or Maiden-castell cald. Of that heigh erag this beautifies the top Whereon the famous Edinburghe doth stand And that fair touns frie liberteis doth stop So proudlie doth the Garesone command Whoes wills to tame their insolence to crop His vncle puts the chairge into his hand Which he obeis and being furneishd out With a strait seige he sets the walls about.

A messinger vnto the King doth scho Sad news that doth incense his wrathfull Ire From Roxbrughs tours braue Douglas beats the foe Eduards bold answer Quenshd his brothers fire To view the Englis camp doth Douglas go The Scots obey their Princes Iust desire Few men they send but valiant fierce and bold Chusde furth of eurie Region vncontrold, Scotlands great King that all this tyme had gone From toun to toune from citie strength and tour Throgh fiffe, Stratherne, Merns, Angus one by one And Goureis cars which all vnto his pou'r Did glaidlie yeild, and he eune he allone Their natiue Lord was their greate conquerour But he to Edinbrughe returnd at last Till Isickles his chilling breth furth blast. No greater pompe, Solempnitie, nor glorie, Magnificence, Praise, ritches, nor renowne Got Cesar as records the Romane storie When as he made the westerne world bow doune To Rooms proud reull wheirof he might be sorie Nor entred he more brauelie in that toune Then oure greate Lord when first he enterd heir Whoe was more lou'd whom all as much did fear. Whill heir he stayd admeird feard lou'd of all To him braue Randolph did the Castell yeild Which to the ground he raizd both tour and wall. That their his foe agane sould haue no beild And on a day set in his Princelie hall He to his knights and Lords his will reueild When straght a messinger doth to him bring Tydings of Ioy wheirof new trubbles spring. The Messinger vpon his face doth fall And sayis great King and my most Gratious Prence All praise be geune to God that doth enstall Vpon oure throne thy worth thy excellence God grant that in thy seid he may recall Thy glorie and resume thy greatnes thence Thy brother Eduard humblie greiteth thee And warns the thus of what is past by me. Rugleins strong peill is tane by Eduard bold That warrlike toun Dundie by him is winn And also royall Stirling vncontrold Gladlie receau'd his conquring armie Inn But that inpregnable and matchles hold Stirlings strong Castell wold not once begin To heare of peace till famein forcd at last They parle thus, and thus their peace is past, A yeir to keip the hold he them permits And if within that tyme greate Englands King Releius them noght but cairles them omits Then in his hands they shall the place resing Sir Philip Moubray their in reuling sitts He's gone to England Succor thence to bring And now that mightie King prouids we heare By Gaine and gold to bring all Europe heir. For he by proclamatioun great hath sworne Through eu'rie kingdome cuntrie toune and shire That Scotlands name by him shall be out worne He will distroy that nation in his Ire And all that comes of vther nations borne To keip that day shall haue what they desire And of this Kingdome greate without extorsioun Eche equall to his worth shall haue his portioun, Greate multitude of straungers day by day Broght by these means in England doth ariue So that they think ritche England scarslie may Find store ynuch to keip them all alliue Besids those cuntreis greate that him obey In France all Princes his confedrats striue Whoe shall the best and greatest armeis raise OS willing seims all Europe him to please. And thus in time your grace wold neids be ware To sue with guifts the angrie King to please Or giue you mind to try the chance of Warr Prouide in time your forces for to raise Wheir with the Kings eies brunt with wraeths teid star Should we his Iyre with guifts quod he appease Why villane what base fear so timerous Ere till this day hath thow espy'd in vs Haue wee till now sustaind such endles pane And storms of Warrs sad tempests hath out worne Oure Kingdome croune and cuntrie to obtane And raisd oure self in spight of Englands scorne For braggs thus for to fold with shame agane When Fortune to oure foot the Ball hath borne No heauins forbid such clouds of fear and shame Sould so obscuir oure mornings rising beame. What tho the pride of oure imperious foe With euer soll destructioun doth vs bost Oure forces mene his multituds doth kno Yea tho a world of men augment his host Oure mite incresseth with his talent lo The widous oill when blisd tho leist was most He must be many still and still be glorious And feu we must be still, and still victorious. Let him bring furth his England, Jreland, Waills, With Britange Gascon and fair Aquitane Poitew and Guian and all cuntreis els With Scotlands better pairt yet all in vane God vs protects gainst whoes strong arme preuaills No Earthlie pour in him oure hopes remane Trew Scotts we bring and brings this prais with all Gainst Scotts allone all Europs thoght too small Thus spak the King whill all his Lords and peers Reioisd thereat and hoped in heauins reuenger Whill he not onlie fearles bold appeirs But also ware and wyislie weyis the danger He for each captain sends who sone compeirs Consulting all how to bear af the straunger The conquering knight came their whoes worthie actes My tird quill mends and my dull Museawaiks. How soone the King returned was from Lorne And progres took through eurie regione faire To vieu the land wheirto him self was borne As righteous King iust Prince and onlie heire Douglas that rest and ease did euer scorne Did bak vnto the south agane repair Wheir he the English oft did ouerthrou But Roxbrugh how he wan Iyll onlie shoun. And thus it was on fastingeuins dark night Thrie scoir he brings in armour pitchie blak All on their hands and feit doth creip out right No noyse no sound no word bewraid their tract The watch them seis but so as in their sight They seimd a heard of bews and this they spak This night good Rodger lets his heard at learg Whereof er long blak Douglas may tak chearg. He smils to sie their sight disceaued so But hard below the wall arriu'd at last In goes the watch such thundring tempests blo Ledhous a Ledder made of Touis vp cast Whoes cleiks of jron soundeth with the thro Yet full of euraige he ascendith fast This ingine he deuisd wherebe to gaine Him self sume glorie and his foe fume paine. The Sentinell that hears the sound espyis Ledhous ascend and quiklie to him goes Who doth not only on the walls arise But kills him too; then doun the carkas throes When all was mounted Douglas quiklie hyis Doun to the hall for to assail his foes Who now amid their feastuall Ioyis var caght Sum play to death sum drink their leatest draght The captane hight Guilliame Ferms whereby it appeirs he was a French man,With lyf devoring swords the Scotts, ariue That Douglas Douglas cryis whoes verey name So dreadfull seimd, that few for wapins strine, But flei to saue their lius not cairing shame Or day thrie hundreth they of life depriue The captane with the rest them selfs reclame In an strong tour but Douglas kept the feild. Till famien forcd them all at last to zeild. And then braue Douglas they intreat for peace To whom anon they render vp the hold Them selfis their liwes and all vnto his grace Who was as wise and mild as feirce and bold Them of that bondaige streight he did relace And send them home with all their wealth their gold And then to Edinbruche his cours he bent Wher warlik Bruce for all his Lords hade sent. Their Edward their greate Stewarde might he sie Trew Marr wise Lenox, Hey, and Randolph strong, With manie more graue counsalours that be To their braue Prince who satt them all among All silence keipt he muisd with maiestie Whill one his throne he satt att last of wrong Acuisd his brother who with reuerend fear Too this his wise and solid words gaue ear. Brother what haist what raschnes did you guide What folie causd you giue so long a day To Englands mightie king for to prouide His forces greate when weill you know he may Bring furth for euerie one vpon our side A hundreth warlik knights in good aray How could yow think that we culd him gainstand Who yet most parte of Scotland doth command. Yea thoght he wold no vther forces raise But onlie Scots for to releiue the hold Eu'ne these can ouermatche vs if he please Much more with Irish English Welshmen bold With Almans Frenshe and Dutchis by all these Whom in subiection he in France doth hold All these shall come and with a world of men Shall we be able to encounter then. Surlie you had no foresight heir at all And to oure rising state you wronged much What we haue conquest yet is verie small Nor ar we siure of these, the commouns such Inconstant minds do beare, and so oure fall Is neir, if one the brokin reid but tuche, Better had bein we neu'r had soght with paine To clim so hie so soone to fall againe. His brother answers heauins forbid that so Should fall, what I haue done we can not mend, Not neid we much to feare oure mightie foe, Thoght he bring armeis from the worlds end, His Sunne is at his Sommerr Solsteice lo And neids he must returne for to discend Fortun must Froune when she too long hath smild Who surest hopeth oft is oft begild. Yea tho he hed a hundreth Kingdoms more And could a hundreth Englands bring to warr By heaune he shall haue Battell once before He come to Stirling if to come he dare This spak bold Edward whoes bold words restore The shining light of Gloreis darkned Starr In many hearts which to greate loue doth raise him His Brother in his heart doth greatlie praise him. But grauelie thus agane the King began My Lords my captains and my chiftains all, I gladlie wold we were assured when Oure foes should come, and when oure troups recall, For oure meane force must be made stronger then To catche occasioun and giue vantage small Then Douglas sai's my Lord let one be sent That war he can perceaue whaat's their intent And surlie I my self the man must be Iyll slilie walk through all their squadrons braue A Frensh man of a Scot they all shall sie With Almans Erensh and Dutch I can disceaue I Knou their Lords and Princes of degrie Through all their camp the secrets I will haue Iyll raise my beard and bazane mak my face Iyll change my voice my gesture and my Grace Loth was the King that he should vndergo This fearfull task he for him self prouids But neids he wold be gone at last and so Disguised like a Frensh man forth he rids His face straik with ane oile no paint did sho Of his first Grace his countenance it hids The accents hard of Frensh he sounds so right That eune the Frensh them selfs mistak their sight The worthie Bruce his tyme not idlie spent But forth to muster calls his men of warr Furth to the flourie banks of forth they went Vnto a pleasant Medou lairge and squair Deir Muse tho time hath in obliuion pent These wortheis names that heir did armour beit And made their of springs nams to differ fare Thou knows bothe what they were &amp; what they are.

The English armie furth before their King To ma[illeg.]ter comes and all their foraigne aid Douglas returnd recounteth eurie thing Ditchis t'intrap his foes greate Bruce hath made Randolphs rare fight fair conquest first doth bring Bruce Beaumout kills the English dooth vpbraid The Scots with tants two Brabanders defend theme For which the King vnto the Scots doth send theme. Strong Beruiks toun on Scotlands fronteir stands Their wheir with siluer streams the Riuer Tueid Diuyds oure kingdome from the English lands And wasts his waus t'enritch the Ocean flood Heir broght the Monarch all his warlick bands At whoes great name all Europe trembling stood And eurie Lord and eurie Prince and King Some gold sume gifts and all greate aid did bring. This mightie Prince his poure assembling sought To kill the Scots or send them all in rout O're whome he streachd his Empyre with a thought Nor for to work the thing had anie dout Douglas his way eu'ne at that hour him broght When this hudge armie Bervicks walls about Incamped lay and when to sie eche crue The regall, throne reard on the walls they view. Him self in glorie sat vpon the throne A diaddeime vpon his head he wore A paill aboue of glistring gold cloth shone He trod on carpets, ritche in pratious store Poudred with stones the robs which he had on And streight in ranks repeared him before His armed guard, thus set each troup he knoes Whilst on the plaine ther Martiall glorie floes.

From these strong Illands made so strong by arte Zeland is all Islands within the sea which the sea sum tym ouerfloued as appeirs by sundrie good arguments. Gainst Neptun who still proous their greatest foe Becaus his floods ouerfloud the greatest parte Of all these lands as some thinks long ago But when els wheir his swelling streams conuert The lands to seas these lands the sea did sho Six thousand thence vnto this warr was send Vpone the Etglish Monarch that depend.

When these greate regiments all were past and gone Doun from his throne, the monarch did discend Inuirond round with Lords and knights anone Vnto a royall tent his course he bend That stood in midst of all the camp allone Without the walls and did him their attend And their him self first by him self was plac'd Then all his Princes at a royall feast. All that was past the Douglas weill espyis Now throu the camp from tent to tent he goes Hearing straunge tongs but straunger harmonyis Of drums and Trumpets which to heaune arose He hears their brags their braues and their defyis The Scotts were now their slaws and not their foes And oft he hears him self condemd to die A crwell death in shamefull Infamie. He smild and to the royall tent agane He turnd, assembleis greate neus affoords The feast was done and to the counsail then Set was the King with Princes duks and Lords He could haue wishd to heir them but in vaine No cuning slight could mak him heare their words For round about the tent the gaurd did stand And none from thence Approcheth nearer hand Wherfore for oght that he could find at all By conferrence with English Frensh or Dutche He seis to trains nor slight they wold not fall So proud they were of strength their force was such This Kingdome lairge by lots too greate and small Was geuen, nor would of Scotts be left so much As one, that monarchs wraithe was so extrame From of the werie earth too raise their name The counsail rais and furth the heraulds went Chairging that spatious hoist in arms to be Raising to morrow with a full intent To march derectlie to their enemie The Douglas heirs and vould their haist preuent From thence that night departing secretlie Vntoo his Lord he haistelie with drew Longing too shou all that he learnd or knew. Thus furth he ryds through silence of the night Fair Cinthea seimd to fauour his intent Wrapping her self and all her beautie bright In duskie clouds which oft in two she rent Where throu she pri'd to sie iff he were right Oft wishing him vp in the firmament Beside the whirlling Pole their stellefyid His bright aspect might gilt her swartish side. When golden haird Apollo first did light Earths better half then could he weill discry The Scottsh camp which enterd once he might Perceaue the soldeors giue a ioyfull cry Heir drums and trumpets their ror's furth on highe His ioyfull welcum thundett throu the skie All to the royall tent did him conuoy Whom his good Lord receaud with woundrous ioy. Vp was the King that night no rest he got Such sad confused thoghts his brains did fill Of greate effairs and many mightie plot Of Douglas he hade dreamd and fearing still His Lords and Princes round about did not His loue to him and Ioy'd in his goodwill The knight kneld doune and kist his Princes hand Who reasd him vp and thus did him demand. Where haue you bein why haue you staied so long What haue you veiud hou faires fair Englands Prince My royall Lord quod he att Berwike strong I stayde til Englands armie came from thence I veiud and walkt their squadrons all among I saue that monarchs greatt magnificence Whoes Royall pomp and mightie pouer in warr Surmonts all, Europeian Princes farr. The number greate of that so mightie host Passeth thrie hundreth thousand as I think They couer all the land from cost to cost They spoyle the cuntreis dry the floods they drink Thither all Europe gatherd is almost And if proud vaunts be deads they scorne to shrink But in a word such their confussioun is Joue be our aid they shall the Garland mis. For of the greatest part of all their bands Both horse and fute their disciplein is small They keip no ranks their captains stil with stands They knou no drum nor trumpets sound at all Naiked vn armd their wapins few commands Onlie the English archers bold and tall All valiant men so weill traind vp in warrs Or pace should raigne from heauin they'll tear the starrs. And their is twentie thousand horsmen more That alway on the King him self auait's Earth can no brauer men then these restore The rest of English knoes no war lik feates Nor were they euer vsd to warre before But hope of Lordships rents and heigh estaits Hath broght them furth for all this Kingdome great Is geu'ne and Scotts by thoght distroyed quit. And that your grace should not eschaip their hands Two knights vnto that mightie King hath sworne Dead or aliue to bring yow bound in bands T'abid what Death he list impose inscorne Of your new croune, which each of them demands In meir disdaine their trophes to adorne Greate Glocester is one as doth apeir. Sir Henrie Boem the vther hight I heir. They to your brother and my self applyis Greate torments too for our so bloodie mind This said furth from the Princes angrie eies Fleu sparks of wrath flams from his face furth shind Praise be to god quod he our enemies He blinded hath and that Kings hautie kind He hardnes still with Pharaos, so his shame And fall I wish may glorefie his name. Now stronglie were the Scotts encamped their Where Banoghes burne mongst shaddie bankes doeth plaie The Torwood neir within a valley fair And for the battell their they neids wold stay Whill as this worthie Generall did prepair To stoppe their foes least they should find away Them to encompas round, which threatning storme Their multitude might easilie performe. Wherfore eune their where their great host should stand With ditches deep the plaine he overcl[illeg.]d Wherein sharp Staiks were pitcd at his command Then cuninglie againe al couered The enemie by this was hard at hand Whoes squadrons lairge ouer al the land was spred When their for-front was at the valeis end Their last Battaillon did thrie leagues extend. My [illeg.]Author saies ane h?derith but al the cronickles agre on fiue h?drethWherefore the King his matcheles Nepheu sent With him fiue hundreth Martiall men of warr Doune to a way that throu the valey went To sterling castell and would neids debarr That hold of aid yee he would still preuent His foes great slight or strength thus broght from farr But this his forsight did the sootherne know That would ou'r shoot him self in his oune bow. Cliffords braue Lord a bold and warlik knight They sent before the hoist a mille and more With twice four hundreth horsmen swift and light That choos'd from all the armie martchd before Ane other way to Sterling go they right Bruce seis and sends Randolph this chek full sore Thy, Garlands, cheifest flour is lost this day If those haue past the way, wheir thou doest stay, They craftilie escheud wher he did ly Nor feard they him nor anie erthly foe But they another secret way wold try And by him were they past er he could kno Yet he his vncles bitter tant doth wey Which stung full deip but he concealls his wo His silence shoes he bears a generous mind That of a Iust reprooff best fruct will find. For with his band he follous hastelie And ouerraichst them like a storme of wind They scorne from fewer then themselfs to flie And for to giue them battell turns around One knight ambitious of some victorie That for his valour had bein much renound Before the rest him self did fare aduance And challengd Randolph for to brek a launce Glaidlie the erlle accepts and furth he goes A strong stiff launce into his hand he bore Swiftlie their steids bore furth these noblle foes Yet their desirs farr swifter came before As Bo[illeg.]eas brok from erthin prison bloes Eune from the Toples heights and craggie shore Of Coucasus, the clifted rocks a sunder, Such furie bring they, Earth-resounding vnder. Sir Williame Hauecourt hight the English knight My author calls him Haucourt but I tak it rather to be Hauort. Whoes speir too weake to harme so strong a foe Breaks on his breist but his stif launce doth light Beneth his curas sklenting vp ward so As from his head of heuines it got a sight His helme then lights vpon the earth belo Furth at his croune the spears point lookt and thence. Bears him to earth then breks with violence. This deed prouocks the Scotts aduancing light, And doth inflame the English all with Ire, A shout the Scotts encurage to the fight, Of English wrath still silence blous the fire, Braue Randolph cairs nor fears not all their might Nor for his men wold stay nor once retire But throgh the rout he breaks with wondrous force And stronglie bears to earth both men and horse. Rudlie both Syds togidder rushith in And blow on blow they giue and wound on wound Death Horror Blood from rank to rank doth rinn Yet nather side wold shrink or lose their ground Whill Scotts thus striue to keip what they had winn And English to repair their lose new found The valiant Bruce was sodainlie assaild With in his camp yet his awin worth preuaild. And thus it was the wantgaird of his foe Still marcht two leagues before that mightie host Straight touards him they cume or he culd kno Who sheam'd within his trenchis to be forst But in the plaine him self did quiklie sho Drew foorth his bands in haist no tyme he lost Nor could his foes refrean from fight at all Still as they marcht for battell still they call. Yet did the rest of this great armie stay Two leagues from thence encamped one a plaine The King comandit so, so they obay The day neir spent to fight war all in waine, The wantgard knew not of this new delay Nor with such strength d[illeg.]rs leasie dout remaine One hors and foote they fiftie thousand wer Led by that mightie erlle of Glocester. The Scotts broght furth by their braue worthie Prence His cheirful looks did conquests hope restore Encuraging each one to mak defence From band to band he rode the ranks before The English knew him by his countenance A Mass or Brasen staf in hand he bore Whill thus he rode Sir Henrie Beome espi'd him And to performe his promeis past he tri'd him. This was the one that should him tak or kill And furth before the host he doth aduance Toward the King he bent his course so ful He hops to mak him yeild beneth his lance But quiklie doth the King auoid this Ill And with a more then manlie countenance Gaue with his Brasen-staf so hudge a blo As kild the knight and brak the mass in two. In th'English that hath sene their campeon fall Disdane and Wrath with Shame and feir contends Disdane and Wrath for dread Reuenge doth call But shame and fear bewrays their want of freends That they were thus allone now knew they all A spur to haist both shame and fear it lends Thus in amazement long they stand in dout If they should flie reteir, or fight it out Yet heighe disdain did fearis faint strok rebatt Now they wold force the Scotts to fight or flie Eache to him self these words doth ruminat Oure number farr exceideth theirs we sie But lo their leader strenght repins their at Softlie reteir and keip your ranks quod he Oure last commissioun is expird of right We had in chairge to martche but not to fight, Wheir with the Scots so fircelie doeth persew As they war vrgd a forcd retreatt to take And scattered in disordered flight with drew When wislie Bruce, his galland troups drew bake Ill to preuent, deceate for to eschew He thinkst, to tymlie fortune to awake Haist wanteth witt, rashnes, shall loose his winning. And maks greate lose attend a fair beginning, Now wer the Scots reteird and left their wrathe When all the Lords thus to their King doth say What may this natioun look for els but death What may this Kingdome look for but decay In yow consists oure being life and Breath Yow gone we die yow lost we'r lost for ay Yet yow your self and ws in yow expose To Danger still and hazards all to lose. To this was answerd ah my Lords quod he I broke the brauest staf that eure was made I must confes: O wisdome worth to flie On golden wings of fame for euer laid This answer seimd no answer for to be And yet theirin both witt and patience stayed He clois'd their mouthes ere half their speach was doun For what he did vnkilld, he could not shune. Yea he the daunger braulie did awoid And Iust praise merits not vniust reproof He deimd no lose, if he hade keipt his rod But all this tyme Randolph without releif Inuirond with his mightie foes abod Which to the worthie Douglas breid such greif That when the King refuisd him leaue to aid him To braek furth throu the camp in raige it made him. But as he neirer to the Battell drew He saw the Englishe bands begin to reill O then quod he it wer noe freindschip trew To reaue the glorie thou deserus so weill Then stood he with his band a fare to view The will of Mars and works of cutting steil Mars blisd him oft that wapins first inuented. But Pitie cursd and wishd him oft tormented. At last he seis them whollie put to flight And bak vnto their camp they haist with speed The Scots for to persew them seimd not light So werrie they so fant so much they bleid Many of them were wounded in the fight Tho none but one was kild and for that deid Thrie hundreth foes lay dead into the place Or eu'r their fellous wold the flight embrace. Lo onlie heir trew valor might be seine Blew Theetis boundles arms did noght contein More worth in warr more strength more curage kein Then in thoes gallant English did remaine No falt in them: no conquerours to haue bein One earth to striue with fortune is but vaine What Mars requeris, was theiris without Intrutione Only ou'r matcht in constant resolusione. These loses throgh the English camp do flie Whill Terror fear and Conscience leads the way Confusioun follous after spedelie Of these when Curage hears he maks no stay Furth from the camp he stelleth secretlie And to the Scotts he came er braek of day But Pride and h[illeg.]ighe Disdane behind abaid That all the world could to distructioun leid. Yet heir and their in twoes and threis they go Their leaders conscience large accusing thus He wold an antient natioun ouerthro A frie croune reaue, O this is dangerus Joue fights for them Gods thundring wrath we kno What heart so bold but heaune maks timerus If heir we fall as we must surlie fall Heigh iustice dealls with vs with them and all. Vthers that on Disdaine and Pride still fed Thus say, tush Scotts what ar these Scotts to vs Meire dunces grose by simple outlaus led Wild sauage naked poore and barbarous Their Lord a montain climber baslie cled More like a cloune then King victorius A hundreth thousand doth adorne our hoast In whoes sterne face he darrs not look allmost. No sooner we shall in the feilds appeir When they in Caues and Dens them selfs shall hide Gainst flights of Egills darres poore Crous compeir Or sillie sheip the dreadfull Lions bide Dare a poore band of cuntrie swans draw neir Vnto a world of martiall soldeors tride In bloodie fights, no no if we but sight them Oure veray drums and trumpets shall affright them. Thus brage the English whill two courteous knights Whois chaist ears still abhord vane glorious bosts Replied, these Scotts whome your cleir day benights A handfull ay compaird with your greate hosts Poore sauage simple whom your neame afrights These many hundreth yeirs hath keipt these costs And throu the wordle haue wone a famous name Their trophes darkning oft your gloreis beame. And sure these Crous do merit double praise That beat the Princelie Egills from their nest These scheip aboue all beasts them selfs doth raise That tear the Lions which disturb their rest If a poore band of fermors nou adais Of conquests wrong, great Kings hath dispossest Eune in dispight of such great strenght so neir They merit most whoes worth doth most appeir. As for the Bruce whome you so much disdaine And rather termis a ruffian then a roy We heir that he but with a simple traine Eune Englands mightie armeis doth distroy And tho the Scotts them selfs be him againe He conquers still a Greek in midst of Troy Ah if he be so worthles as you mak him Why trouble you all Europe thus to tak him. In Brabant borne these knights were both that mak Their parte so good whome yet they neuer knew Such indignatioun heighe the English tak Both Sids leap furth to arms and wapins drew But soone commanders wise their furie brak. And both wer broght to that greate Monarchs view Who when he hard what they had boldlie said This hauie punishment vpone them laid. We chairge you quiklie from oure camp quod he And presentlie vnto the Scotts repare. Their hinder what you can oure victorie Both with your counsail valour strenth and care And who soeuer too morrou lets vs sie. Their Sotish heads cut from their trunks I swear Gainst eurie head a hundreth punds to set And think the dead good seruice to oure state. The Scotts hous boolded in hand war[illeg.] wherein Bruce Portrat and the Scotts Arms was set.Then wheir the Scotts encamped were they go A guard of horsmen did them their conuoy When greate and worthie Bruce their cause did kno He did receaue them with exceiding Ioy And when the battell endit was did sho Suche bountie high as ritche without annoy To Antuerp they returnd and bulded their In honor of the Scoots a Mansion fair. Each Armie now for battel sterne prouids Each on their Lord and maker loudlie call Long time the Scotts in zealous pray'r abids Before the Lord in humble wise they fall That Faith that Trueth that Right and Justice gids In which they pray him to protect them all Whill heauins gold spongled Gannob[illeg.] was spred And silent Morpheus broght them to their bed. Caput. 17. The Argument. Both Armeis Ioyne in long and doubtful fight And threttie thousand in the ditches die King Edwards deids encurage eurie knight And Scotts for to preuent their victorie Is forcd to Ioyne with them in Singill fight When th'Argentine greate Bruce hath ki[illeg.]d they flie Their King abids and wold the flight restore But seis new aid and fleis his foes before. When bright Hiperion's goldine carr arose Both armes soone were cled in glistring armes Whoes golden splendor gainst the Sune furth shoes Earthes lightning hote the Aers cold region warmes First eche braue Scot to diuine seruice goes No trumpets blast was heard nor drumes allarmes The sacrament they take to heaune vpfleis Eche humbled hearts best pleasing sacrafice. The English squadrons marchd vnto the plaines And all the land with arms doth ouerflo A iust half moone their battells forme containes Sharp to eche point brod to the mids they gro In battells fiue their mightie Host remaines Two on the right and on the left hand two Of their greate King that in his battel large A hunderth thousand horsmen led to charge: Greate Arrandell nixt him on his right hand The chairge our fiftie thousand Archers bore Those English wer all come from English-land No brauer warriors could the earth restore Nixt vnto him did valiant Hairtfoord stand On horse and futt that led as many more From Scotland, England, France, and Jreland broght With Sheilds, with Launces, Piks, &amp; Swords, they foght Nixt on the left hand valiaunt Oxfoord stood That fiftie thousand footmen broght to fight All these did seim approued Souldiors good With dairts sword Piks and vther Ingins wight And Glochester nixt him that thrists for blood Had in his battell many warlick knight Like to the vther wing his wing was pleac'd With arms and curage both alik ar greac'd In the greate battel with the King abod Henolis greate Erle and many Princes mo On his right hand that warlick campioun rode Whoes fame so much out all the world did go Sir Giles of argentine &amp; Sir Odomer de vallange rode on eather hand of the King.Of Argentine sir Giles that gaind abrod So many conquests our the pagane foe Greate Pembroks Erle on his left band did stay His saiftie onlie in their valors lay. And then greate Bruce came to the plane at last And this new moone thus for to perse essayis First brod behind his battells forme was cast Then stretched furth to a point Pirameid wayis Seuin thousand warriours in the vantgard past With the feirce knight in warr more bold then wyise Whome Scotlands Stewart seconds in command His feirce and firie nature to withstand. Manie braue knights vnto this battell drew Bold warlick, ferce and men of worthie fame And then the second battell did ensew Randolph. Morais stout Erle them led whoes famous name Shall neuer die and many werlick crew With him: whoes hearts did fleit in valors streame Their number like the first and these did beare Spears Piks and Suords and all Ingins of warr the Valient DouglasThe conquering knight the third Batallione broght Seauin thousand also did this host containe Scotlands greate Constabill vnto him soght the Erl of erol.Braue Hay and these that did with him remaine The Boid and vther Lords still worthie thoght But last of all did marche vnto the plaine The greatest battell which the King commands. Wheir fourtein thousand armed warreors stands. Many of all the noble men ware their And all these hosts on fut did march to fight To eurie battell did the King repair Whoes quick cleir eies send furth a cheirfull light His visard vp he mildlie doth declair The price of conquest punishment of flight And with a countenance which wold haue, made Euen cowardis hardie thus into them said. My freinds quod he behold this glorious day The Bruce his oratione. Multitood maks no victorie. Wheirin the heauins to croune oure Ioys hath sworne Let none of yow their multituds effray Gainst God and querrells Iust force seims forlorne In Scotland fiftie thousand yet doth stay Meit for the warre whome we haue all forborne And yow we chuisd whoes hearts could neuer fail-yow Nor could base fear of death, at all assaill yow. The worst of yow his Gentreis will declair And of his reputatioun still will bost; The Scots wer all chosin Gentilmen no commons am?gst theme. A Gentleman may with a Lord compair But what is he if honor once be lost And heir on honor waiteth ritches fair These two that all the world so much do cost Which if yow wish, do now but cair for fame He neuer deis that winns a famous name. What is that armie which yow now behold But eune a new raisd Babell of confusioun The Soldeors mistak their captans bold To colonels reull the captans mak intrusioun Thus eurie one by vther is controld And Iarring foundeth forth a ghostlie visioun All kind of beasts wold in one heard confound Their reullers witt with their confused sound. Besids they came oure natioun to distroy And from the earth to roote and rais oure name Look not by flight your life for to enioy But rather thousand torments most extreame Your Maids and Wyfs to death they shall convoy When in your sight they raueishd ar with shame Yee all must die and they inioy as theirs What yow haue buld or planted for your heyrs. Then if yow wold preuent their crueltie And endles praise and endles wealth obtaine Let eurie one of yow mak one to die So one triumph and conquest shall we gaine As for ten thousand which among yow be We know such valor doth in them remaine Eche shall kill two and whoe of yow be is soft We sweare his Airs their wairds shall nothing cost. Yea what I seik yow may performe at will For what ar they a Chaos heap confuisde Naiked or slightlie armd and wanting skill To till the ground and keip their flocks more vsd How can their King preuent their following Ill When feare and ignorance hath reull abusde In danger who wants skill hath curage lost One coward disconforts a mightie host. The English King (his armie in array) King edward his oratione.Thus by him self and by his Trinshmen spak If I were not so weill assuirde too day Of victorie and of these Dastards wrak, An other forme of speache I wold essay, But Bruce that Fox now may not turne his bak, God doth him thus within this feild inclose That we may giue what death we list impose. King Robert head 2. brether taken presoners who ware both slaine.His brether by oure Princelie Syir was taine And Iustlie punishd were as they deserud King Robert and Eduard his brother.And onlie but these two doth yet remaine By ws it rests they should alike be seru'd These Scotts which yet their small host doth containe Ar noght but Robbers poore and hunger sterud Thefe ar not they that hath so oft before Fors'd oure bold English from the northern shore. In this long warr all these ar spent and lost, Noght but the dregs remains run is the wine Distroy them kill them scatter all their host, We sie them els to fearfull flight incline, This kingdome, fair and lairge from cost to cost Tak yow for eu're: Noght but the name is mine Dare one poore slaue gainst thousand Captans fight. No no oure shad shall put them all to flight. Whill thus he spoke the Scots on kneis doun fall And prayd to Christ, whill as they did espy His Croce reard vp on hight before them all By him that reuld Sanct Androes Priorie Si[illeg.] quod the King how they for mercie call Wheir at the English armie gius a cry But thus that Antient Graue and warlik knight Did answer him Sir Omphrauell that hight. Your maiestie indeid hath spokin trew They call for mercie to the Lord of grace But at your grace they do no pardon sew Nor will they flie this mightie host a space The more their wounds the more their strength renew To sie their blood their valor doth increes But if your maiestie wold ouerthrow them Vse this devise for surlie best I know them. Before them let your armie feim to flie And yow shall sie them brak their Battells strong None with his Captane will commanded be Thus quyte disordred shall they be er long Tush quod the King, I scorne they flight should sie When both oure force and valor is too strong Let these that feare them vse such craft or flie them We mind if they darr fight at all, to sie them. Thus martching on the English armie goes, The Scots enflamd with furie hate and Ire Wold giue the Chairge, but their wise Lord that knoes Their haist doth Curb and brydill their Desire, Vntill the pits prepaired for his foes, They could not shune: and then he bloes the fire Of their feirce Curage, when his will was done: And both the armeis rush togither sone. It was a wondrous straunge and dreadfull sight, To sie these squadrons meit vpon the plaine, How eurie soldior Captane Lord and knight, Straue endles praise and glorie to obtaine, The Scotts schrill trumpets thunders furth the fight, Their foes send furth heaune deafning sound againe, Both armeis seimd two woods their leaus that cast When Winter foorth his bitter breath doth blast. Both sides approche their blooddie rage to glutt And terrible the coward seemes to be Hote furie flammes within and burnes without Blood heates their heart fire from their brests do flie Trew Curage and Desire had banishd Doubt Their hand and foote stroue with their thoght and Eie In gesture this they were alreddie ioynd By thought their triumphes all were quikly ioynd. Earth shrinkes and aer was darkned with the dust Tumult ascendes whill thunder shaekes the ground Both armeis rudelie meet and brauelie iust Braue yet in show till terror beautie dround Swords sheeldes and helmes glistred like heaune almost Horror it self seemd first with pleasure cround Blood had not garde their armes, caskes keep their head No members cutt, nor murdred heapes lay dead. But as in Autums first and fairest Prime The angrie wrath of heauins reuengefull King For hell bred sinns, furth of sterne Boreas clime Scharp shouts of hail with blustring winds doth bring So heir the shours of arrous lairger tyme Darkins heauins face whill throw the air they sing A heaune new framd of yron cloudes they view Whoes pearsing beames the vitall blood furth drew Ther stormes pourd doune whoes haell wer yrone stinges And funde no earth but couerd horse and men And eche a wakning wound or death furth bringes Heaune sends doune suddane harme nor know they wh? Chance seemis trew fate hape killith hopes disignes. But aim the archer spends no shalt in vane The brauest kills triumphing our his foe But he is kild of whome he doeth not kno. This was the Lord Mershall &amp; heght Robert Keith. Scotts worthie King that seis the harmefull wrong Done to his men by English archers kene Fiue hundreth horsmen sends freshe hardie strong Led by the euer famous Keith I wene Who goes about and at their baks ere long With stiff strong launces all in reast were sene Through all their ranks they brak with furious might And beats them to the earth with sad affright. Scotlands greate Merschall heir suche Ualor shew As maks his glorie leiue in endles fame For more then seauintie tims he did renew Vnequall fight with Danger most extreame Greate Arandell in fight he did subdew And by his onlie valors lightining beame Foyld fiftie thousand warlik men of pride Whill sears fiue hundreth did with him abide. Thus whill the fronts of both the armeis fight The greate Battalion of the English Host Fourth ouer the couered ditchis mairchith right, Wheir more then threttie thousand horse almost, With groning Earth doth shak, and turns to flight, But such dreid Thunders earths wid bowells tost As tumbling in her brest, doth vaune a way To suellow them in darknes hid from day Some break their necks legs arms their horse below Some smoird some crushd to Death with vthers weight Some horse and men with shairp stroks persid throw The liueles truncks semis carued stone in sight This fearfull accident doth ouerflow Their fellous hearts with Horror Fear and Flight They stand: not mairtch amazd they look at lairge Till their bold foes gaue them a furious chairge. Thronging throu tanks &amp; ech wheir strous their way With Herror Terror Slaughter blood and Feare In harvest so reapers reap without delay A feild of Wheite of Oars of Rie or Beare And raizeth all the pleane nor maks no stay Till want of Corne mak them their task forbeare And Ceres locks cut doun in heaps doth ly Such heaps the Scotts still kills and passeth by. Their angrie King that led them this doth view And brauelie from his troups doth furth aduance And wheir his steid he turnd or sword he drew The kild fell doun hurt fled his countenance From his fair eies dread Maiestie furth flew Manie fell doun struk with the lightning glance But better he whom he had kild before For these with teith and feit his curto tore And their were killed by his Princelie hand Seuin valiant knights whoes names hath time forgot From rank to rank he martchd from band to band And whome he meits death sure must be his lot Stratherns old Erle their deid beneth his brand The Erll of Stratherne and his sone both kild by the King of England. Whoes sone with sorrow prickd with furie hote Did ferslie him assaill but all in vaine Death made him soone forget his fathers paine These two w[illeg.]r Sir geills of argentine and gir adomer de vall[illeg.]nge.Now I almost forgot the wondrous deids Of these bold campions set on ather hand Of this greate King who after him furth speids When first he left his battel guarde and stand And still on death on blood and murder feids Marching from troup to troup from band to band Yea these thrie campions fearles bold and strong Cut furth thrie bloodie lains their foes among. So doth thrie mightie Cannons shot at once A front an armie standing all in gro The heaune with lightning earth with thunder grons Eche firie bullet cuts the ranks in two Heir lyis the head and their the helmet shons A furlong thence the Bodie fells a foe Scheilds Arms and Legs heir monts and their doth mank And mak wid windoes deip in curie rank. And now the greate Battallion which they led Wheir yet remand thrice twentie thousand horse By their example all encuraged Rushd foreward on their foes with wondrous forse And in a moment all the plaine vas cled With corps whereon they tred without remorse Proud fortun seimd to froune vpone the Scot And victorie to croune the English lor. Now seimd the Scotts too walk against their foe Squadrons of barded horse still beats them doun And these thrie campiouns that before them goe Thrie Wonder-wirkers conquering a croun Greate Bruce espyis this Danger wrak and woe With noble wrath Ielous of their renoune Wold with the strongest cop by fatall chance And to the Argentine doth furth aduance. A gallant fight betuex the Bruce &amp; the argentine.O who had sene that fight so bold and strong Their was the Scool that taught the arte of warr These Masters were and had beine Loureat Long Nor Mars nor Pallas could the fight forbear Wondring on earth the mortalls all among To find such two as eune them selfs wold fear And think if these two onlie took in hand To conquer earth none could their force gainstand. These matchles Lords these warriors bold did weild Two heauie masts rather then lances strong Two horse of Spaine forth bear them trough the feild With force alike they meit amid the throng O sacred Mase some golden phraises zeild T'enritch my verse and guild my lais along Make of those lines a heaune reard throne renound Where lett this famous fight for aie be cround. The fureous stroke made all the earth to quaik And Woods and montains echod bak the sound Yet could it not these valiant champions shak Nor beare them from their seat nor force a wound In fleinders flie their spears their horses brak Their neks, and both the riders lay on ground Yet vp they they flie with swords they soone addres By death warrs dreadfull sound for to suppres. Both swordes weill couch'd eche at his ward doth ly Their eies their handes their feit they wische guide Then ceasles stroakes thrustes foines and bloues they try They ward trauerse retoir marchd leape a side Both giues and both receaues both falsefie Both shunes and both lyife garding wardes prouide Both oppin stand for death like despirat louers Which craft in th'one the others art discouers. The Prince on futt was readie suift and light And could with stand the Argentins bold sute Who was on hots more skilfull in the fight But he more stong more quik to execute Sir Gilles hade more art and cunning slight The King more painfull kein and resolute More fearce he was this foe more could and slie And yet in arte both seemd a like to bee. The Prince vpone the Argentine would enter Shuning his doun-right blow his strength to teame Then at his heart the Argentine doth ventre Which whill the Prince strikes by he doth reclame And paintes his brest too cuning was the painter For show of blood floues furth a bloodie streame Which so inflammed the King with curage fire Arte now reteird shaine bringes reuenge and yre. This knew the knight but would not seeme to know Whill as greate Bruce his brest to daunger laid Whereat the Argentine soone reacht a blow But left his syid quite nacked to inuade The worthe King first shunes his furious throw And then a wound both large and deip he made This his reuenge the prouerb old belied Heir cunning Arte and furious Raige agreid. Whill thus they striue and double wound on wound Bold Edward matcht with Pembrocks Erle in fight Of whome fames sweit shrill trumpet shall resound From Jude to Ockades their praise their might Deseruing weill with Glorie to be cround And in all age to shine with glorious light Their woundrous strength their Curage ech did sho But nather side aduantage yet doth kno. Now Englands King not one darres match at all Whome blood and death attends throu all the feild Hay Erll of [illeg.]ell constabill of Scotland.But woorthie Hay his curage did appaill No daunger maks him shrink or fear or yeild Alcides club with more strength did not fall Vpone that mightie Tirrant Brouseirs sheild Then on the helmett of this dreadfull King The Erle his feirce and furious bloes doth bring Eune their wheir goold and perll and pratious stone Vpon the Prince his curious helm was wroght He lightis and cleft the cask which brightlie shone And to his horses crest his head doune brought For paine th'inraged King sendes furth a grone Trembling for Ire whill droid reuenge he soght And on his helme he gius a blo so rood That from his noise and mouth Isht crimsone blood But to repay him when the warr-lik knight Hade lift his sword gone was the Prince in rage Still where his furie ledd him through the fight No generall ought a combat for to waige But all this while in equall ballence right Both armeis stand conquest departes the staige But in the left winge with the Douglas bold Great Glocester a bloodie fight did hold. This was the man that swear to Englands King To bring the Bruce capteiw in chaines and cordes The Douglas fand him aiming at the thing A band of knights with him thairto accords But furth to combat Douglas did him bring In spight of all these Sold'ors knights and Lords A squadron strong at his command had foght With them and both almost were broght to noght These campions strong thus fought a Battell bold Troy neuer vieud the like in all her wrack Their Skill their Strength their valor to vnfold My slender Muse darts noght in hand to tak But sure I know the worthie Douglas wold Noght leaue the fight till his proud foe he mak To yeild his nek beneth his conquring bled And for his fault his guiltie blood he shed. This done he marcheth throw the host at last Working new wonders still wheir euer he goes Close ranks he breaks and oppins as he past Before his face still fleis his fearfull foes He seis braue Randolph haisting conquest fast And craftie Omphrauell beat by his bloes Steward the great with Hartefurd striuing standes Whoe first should gett a kisse of conquests handes. Long foght the knights but neither side wold yeild Equall their hope and equall was their feare Spears helms &amp; swords were stroud through all the feild Heads arms and legs by headles bodeis were Some dieing look to heauin leans on their shield In deaths pane some blood from their wounds furth tear These ranks to marche reteir or chairge that minds Trods on the bodeis of their slauchtred freinds. Their horses kild lay with their masters dead And he to death that did his foe persew Now in his bosome laid his heauie head The conqueror by him he ouerthrew Is prest to death and findeth no remeid O're all confusione tumult and terror flow Their nather silence was nor noyse perfite But sounds of Death paine pitie rage dispight. The Glorious arms that lait did glistring show Now blood and dust and myir had dinid their beams Fear Herror Terror on sw[illeg.]h hight doth grow That sullen pryde sunck doune no honor clames Her glorie strond vpon the earth below O're all her beautie blood floues furth in streames Now Greif and Sorrow beats Delight fra thence And all doth look with wofull countenence. Earths rairest King that all this while had fought With his fierce foe and geuin him many a wound Yet doubts who thence with conquest will be broght Such valor greate was in that knight renound At last to kill or die him self he thoght And with a strength far more then erst he found He thrustis againe and from his side furth tore A deadlie stream, a flood of blood and Gore. Ah matchles Prince when thow hes knoune the man Whoes days by the must now be broght to end Thow shalbe like to burst for sorrow then No confort shall thy conquest to the lend He was thy frend thy deir companioun when In th'Englishe court thy youth thow hapt to spend No Fauor he at all to the did sho But Vertuous minds lous Vertue in their foe. The Argentine that seis this bloodie sight Bathd in his louk-warme blood him self doth stay Ire in his fanting hairt prolongs his might Feble his force for to renew the fray Furie Disdane and Raige mantaind the fight For strength was gone and Curage was away Lyfe leaues his toure and in the breache remaines, That death should gaine so braue a hold disdaines. Vnitting his spent pours a blow he lendes The Prince, that woundes his head and cuttes his cask With whoes last force and weyght doune he discendes Death winnes the breache, beginnes his endles task Furth from his lippes lifes aged Syre he sendes Then on his face he spreds his doolfull mask To heaune his soulle fleis throw the cloudie Air Whoes greate name som tyme all the Eist did fear. In thrie set Battells thrice he did with stand The Sarasins and still with conquest cround And twice beneath his all victorious hand With chains of death their cheifest Lords he bund But now when endles sleip did him command No longer durst proud Fortun their be fund Wheir English fight but she and victorie Rankt with the Scotts, vpon ther enemeis flie. The English Irckt and wiered then disrank All flie yea eu'ne the boldest yeilds to flight Their Cullors throune away with thankles thank Threats Cryes and Plaints redoubles their Affright Their King still threats but still away they shrank For yet with him vnbrokin byds the fight Whole tuentie thousand horse with whom he wold Their Fight, or Die or, Conquer vncontrold. But as the seas when tempests past and gone That rold her tombling waus vnto the shoars Of lait past storms retanes some shoues anone And heir and their sume swelling Billow roars So thoght faint feare triumph'd do're these allone Some sponks of their spent Ualor hope restors Wheiron sustaind their task they new beginn But wound on wound and death on death doth rinn. The Carriers of the Scottish camp arose And see their Masters still mantane the fray Both Lak[illeg.]ys Carters Wemen Slaues and those That carage keept, came in their best array And disperatlie wold assaill their foes So al should winn or al should lose the day Long napkins white vnto their staues they bind These seru'd for Ensigns wauing in the wind. Whill thus the English fighting loth to flie Eune suddandlie appears into their sight An armie freshe that seimd in arms to be With th'eir their siluer Ensigns wauing bright They haste their pace and with a shout they sie That these curagiouslie intend to fight Disconfeit quite they now resist no more But flees that wold haue fled long time before. The Scotts persew them in a dispirat sort Some through the plains some to the montans flie Wheir eu'r their headles fear doth them transport A whirll wind seims to beare them haistelie Thousands the tumbling forth of lyfe cuts short And thousands mo in flight their foes our hy Base deaths they seik but fleis the death which lend In Glorious fight a fare more Glorious end.
