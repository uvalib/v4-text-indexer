      <field name="fulltext">THE Merry Travellers: OR, A Trip upon Ten-Toes, FROM Moorfields to Bromley. An Humorous Poem. Intended as the Wandering Spy. In these dull mournful Times, a merry Tale, Like South-Sea Stock of late, perhaps may fail; But if it shou'd, 'twou'd spoil the Authos's Joke, For if the Poem's damn'd, the Poet's broke. Part I. In that dull Time of Recreation, By Lawyers call'd, The Long Vacation, When Pettifogs and Hackny-Writers, Sneak up and down like poor Sheep-biters; When Taylors too, for want of Trade, Make Cucumbers their daily Bread, And destitute of Pence to spend, At All-Fours, Nine-Pins, or Board's-End, Turn Aquæpotes, when Credit fails, And Homage pay to Pumps and Wells; Nor is it shameful in the least, For Man to tipple like a Beast, Since Gen'rals and their armed Forces, Are glad sometimes to drink like Horses, And when they're warm'd with Field Disputes, Swill Water, just like other Brutes. When Wholesale Dealers mount their Steeds, And strut on Finsb'ry Quadrupedes, To plague their distant Country Chaps, With strenuous Duns, Bills, Bums and Knaps, And thus are forc'd to be severe, To save themselves from breaking here. When wealthy Vintners send their Spouses And Daughters to their Hampsted Houses, Whilst they themselves neglect their Bars, To hunt with Sheriffs and Lord May'rs; Or twice a Week forsake their Cellars To revel at some Country Dealers, Where, with their Friends, they stuff their Paunches, With Stockdon Hams or Venson Haunches, And draw in all they can invite, To make their own Expence more light. When Vict'lers, to promote the Sale Of muddy Beer and Goosb'ry Ale, Are forc'd to trust, in spight of Law, At least one half of what they draw, Till Kather'n-Wheels, round O's, and Crosses, Those Signs of doubtful Debts and Losses, Shine round their chalky Bars as bright As Planetary Orbs by Night, Glitt'ring by Sixes and by Sevens, Like Constellations in the Heavens, Till Trade improves and Money comes By slow Degrees, in little Sums, Then a wet Finger does its Duty, And robs the Bar-board of its Beauty. In such afflicting Times as these, When thinskin'd Ladies hunt the Fleas, And shoals of Fools, depriv'd of Riches, Pray backwards for the South, like Witches, My Jolly Friend and I, not finding Domestick Bus'ness worth our minding, Mov'd by the fineness of the Weather, Agreed to take a Trip together, Leaving our careful Wives to mourn Our Absence, till our safe return; For Women that have known the Sweets Of Love, between the Nuptial Sheets, Are always in a peck of Troubles, Like Children, when they lose their Baubles. On Monday, August Twenty-one, When Morning Clouds eclips'd the Sun, My Friend and I, with nimble Heels, Took our departure from Moorfields, A Place once famous thro' the Nation, For sporting Nymphs and Conjuration; Also for Gaming, Wrestling, Cudgelling, And what your modest Whores call Fudgelling, But now, by dint of Grace, 'tis grown, A Pious Quarter of the Town, And Meetings, for the Peoples good, Are built where Bawdyhouses stood; Whilst Saints reform the neighb'ring Allies, Once stuff'd with common Sluts and Baili's. Thus Time turns ev'ry Place and Creature, To something worse, or something better; All Things on Earth have ups and downs, As fickle Fortune Smiles or Frowns. When thus my chuffy Comrade, Guy, That mortal Cherubim, and I, Had left our loving Babes and Spouses, And turn'd our Backs upon our Houses, We walk'd and talk'd, did laugh and frisk, And on each other look'd as brisk, As if our Wives had both been bury'd Some Months, or that we'd ne'er been marry'd. Thus happy our Companions find us, When Nuptial Cares are thrown behind us. But such kind Intervals as these Last seldom long without a Tease. Now plagu'd with neither Child nor Woman, We steer'd our Course tow'rds Bromly Common, Debating whether we should Coach it, Or keep back that Expence in Pocket: At length our frugal Tempers bent us, To gently trip it on our Ten-toes, Altho' in Flesh, Blood, Guts and Grease, We walk'd near Eighteen Stone apiece. That is, in case my bulky Mate Would add to my inferior weight, And kindly lend me six or seven Score Pounds, to make the Ballance even: Therefore my Muse, on this Occasion, Craves leave to make a small Digression, Wherein she justly does intend To draw the Picture of my Friend, That he that reads may have a sight Of honest Will, in black and white. Reuben, that wond'rous Man of Art, In Sacred History expert, Whose Head and Hand by Fancy fir'd, Seem'd both for Holy Works inspir'd, Yet he, in all the Clouds he'as painted, Where Angels oft are represented, Ne'er bless'd the World with such a Face As Will can show, when o'er the Glass: Nor does the Carving in St. Paul's, Of winged Cherubs o'er the Stalls, Afford us one Seraphick Phiz, So Cherubimical as his; Especially when wash'd and scowr'd, Or newly doctor'd by my A neigbouring Barber always so stil'd, Lord; Then when he's seated o'er a Bowl, With this good Freind and that dear Soul, No Michael, Zeus, or Peter Paul, Coul'd e'er produce among 'em all, So glorious an Original. His Body's of a comely growth, Betwixt Activity and Sloth, Can nimbly to the Cellar run, Then sit and snoar as soon as done; Yet when in Chair he lolls his Breech, Or on a Bench, no matter which, His Head aside, his Peepers winking, In a soft Slumber, to one's thinking, Let any Friend a Cup but fill, And say, Here's to thee, honest Will, Then up he starts, I dare engage ye, And cries, Your Servant, Sir, I'll pledge ye, Nay, if a Mouse should chance to creep But near him, when he's fast asleep, And squeak, 'twixt Cupboard and the Wall, He'd answer, Gentlemen d'ye call, So wakeful when a Nap he takes, And yet so drowzy when he wakes, That he must ken him well that knows When he's Awake, or in a Doze; For as some People walk when dead Asleep, as 'tis by many said, So, vice versa, when he walks, Poor honest Will both Sleeps and Talks; Wherefore no mortal Man knows, whether He always really sleeps, or never; For all his Words and Actions seem, Except in Bed, a very Dream, And there, for his good Spouse's sake, We hope sometimes he's broad awake. Now, Reader, Cheek by Jowl we jog, Both freed alike from Nuptial Clog, As merry as two slavish Creatures, Who just had shaken off their Fetters, Shaping the Course we had to take, Will half asleep, I scarce awake, Till into Gracechurch-Street we came, Where wealthy Quakers live in Fame, In whose well-furnish'd Shops there stood, Such lusheous Female Flesh and Blood, So gravely dress'd, without a Hoop, But yet so rich, from Head to Poop, So fair their Bubbies and their Faces, So smooth their Sattins, without Laces, Their Petticoats in Folds depending, The common Mode so far transcending, As if they thought, when Love had quite Extinguished what they call the Light, Their pritty Legs, those underprops, Could stretch their Coats instead of Hoops, Whose width discovers, to our wonder, How far some Toes can part asunder. Therefore no Woman ought to hide Her Charms in Hoops so wond'rous wide, Except sh'as a confounded Stride. From hence I lug'd my honest Friend, Who on a Post some time had lean'd, To take a little Nap, whilst I Apply'd unto the Wall hard by; And when I'd shook him once or twice, And made him open his drowsy Eyes, Downwards we almost run a Race To Fishstreet-Hill, that noted Place, Where shoals of Lobsters lay in view, Some stinking stale, some crawling new, With sundry sort of Fish beside, That smelt as strong as if ally'd To Venus, that adult'rous Slattern, Begot upon the Sea by Saturn. Whence Lovers do observe, and't please ye, The fairest Ladies smell most fishy: If so, then who would not by marrying, Enjoy Fish, Flesh and good Red-Herring. From hence we mov'd directly forward, Our Noses South, our Arses Norward, Till we proceeded to that ridge Of arched Stones, call'd London-Bridge, Where wooden Houses tott'ring stood On Props, above the raging Flood, Whose roaring Billows, as they past Each stubborn Arch in angry hast, Seem'd, as they rowl'd along in fury, To threaten, in their foaming hurry, Destruction to that vaulted Row That checks their Passage to and fro. Since Rivers thus aloud complain, When we their native Course restrain, And with their utmost Power attack, The Banks and Mounds that keep 'em back, Well may poor Nations, when they've lost That freedom which they once could boast, Unite their Forces and agree, To roar aloud for Liberty. By this time my somnif'rous Friend And I Eliza's House had gain'd, And to the wracking of our Bones, Slid on from greasy Stones to Stones, Giving, like civil Men, the way To Hackney Coach and Brewer's Dray, Or lab'ring Horses that came nigh us, Loaded from Tan-yard and from Dye-house, Which so fatigu'd my Friend's fat Corpus, He blow'd and snorted like a Porpus: But at the Visto's of the Draw-Bridge Got Breath, by seeing Boats go thro' Bridge. So Travellers, when almost tir'd, By sweating much and walking hard, Lean on their Staves, for ease design'd, And turn their Noses to the Wind. When thus my Friend had cool'd his Liver, By Breezes that came off the River, We blow'd our Noses, wip'd our Faces, And then advanc'd, by gentle Paces, To Southwark-Market, where we view'd Such vast variety of Food, That no luxurious Fornicator Could pass, without indulging Nature; For as we squeez'd and jostl'd thorough The right-hand side o'th' crowded Borough, The Butchers made a bloody show, And stood like Cuckolds all-a-row, Some stock'd with Beef, some stor'd with Veal, Some wetting Knives upon a Steel; Some selling Mutton, others Ram-stones, As big as Turkey-Eggs, for Lamb-stones. For he that cannot by his Eyes Distinguish, knows not what he buys. Among the Butchers, here and there, Was plac'd a useful Poulterer, One in his Shop (besides his Wares, Rang'd on his Shelves for Customers) Had those two Comforts of his Life, A Spaniel Puppy and his Wife, But which he really lov'd the best, I can't determine, I protest, Tho' I observ'd him as I past, He strok'd the first, but not the last; Whence some would think he lov'd his Dog Much better than his Nuptial Clog; Which if he does, she ought to scorn him, And into better Manners Horn him. Another, destin'd by his Stars, To deal in Pigs and Poultry Wares, Is by the Saints so much respected, No Muse can pass him by neglected. His blund'ring Head looks Sarazantick, His Body's of a bulk Gygantick, So fat, so weighty, and so large, 'Twould freight a little Western Barge; His Belly, in its spacious hollow, Contains at least ten Stone of Tallow, Besides, of Filth such ample store, 'Twou'd dung a Rood of Land, or more; His Legs, like Pavier's Rammers, level The Stones, wheree'er they walk or travel; His Cheeks and Nose are of a true Refulgent Bacchanalian hue, So dy'd with Claret, that, in short, His Face sweat nothing else but Port. His Principles are Het'rodox, As taught by Naylor and by Fox; And when he's well inspir'd by Claret, Like them can babble by the Spirit, And at the Meeting prate and say, As much dull stuff, Poz roz, as they; Yet notwithstanding that, the Light Within him shines so very bright, He can sometimes, like other Sots, Come loaded home with Farlton Pots, And give his Wife good Cause to say, Ah! Robin, Robin, why this Day Would'st thou prophane the Light within thee, And drown those Gifts the Lord has gi'n thee. Woe to these Doings that undo thee, Thrice Woe I do pronounce unto thee. Woe, Woe, are words for Roan or Dobbin; Prithee let's Gee to Bed, says Robin. So up the Stairs the Spirit moves him, Whilst Rachel props behind and shoves him. Next to his Preaching and his Guzz'ling, He's famous for the Art of Puzz'ling, For on his Stall sometimes is laid A Turkey with a Goose's Head, And oft he stitches, to our wonder, A Turkey-Cock's-Comb to a Gander. Thus puzzles Fools with monstrous Fowls, By joining Woodcocks Bills to Owls, And making Partridges and Plover Change Heads and Wings with one another. The next Curiosity he shows, Are Pigs stitch'd up in Body-clothes, And thinks 'twould spoil a merry Joke, To sell a Pig without a Poke. No yellow Fowl, or stale one, green, Can ever in his Shop be seen, Because he puts in use a strange Device, to white 'em when they change; For first he greases o'er the Skin, With fat of some drawn Fowl, and then With Drudging-Box, and what's within it, Strikes a fine Colour in a Minute. Thus serves his Poultry and his Pigs, As Barbers do their sandy Wigs, Who Oil 'em first, and then prepare Their Puffs to hide the Carrot Hair. No Folly more delights the Dunce, Than that he pos'd a Parson once. Pray Friend, said he, art thou so knowing, To tell where the first Man was going When he was Twenty Years of Age. Not I, reply'd the Reverend Sage. Why then, says Robin, be it known To thee, and all that wear the Gown, Adam, when Twenty Years were spun, Was going into Twenty-one. This he reports, when o'er his Liquor, And brags how he buffoon'd the Vicar. No Fowls or Rabbits, stale or turning, He sells, except on Sunday Morning, First deals out Goods scarce fit for eating, And then Holds-forth at Quaker's Meeting, Which shews the the Godly may prophane The Sabbath, when it is for Gain. Therefore, Friend Robin, we advise thee, To let no Journal advertise thee, But silently to Brentford jog, Attended by thy Spaniel Dog, Whose noisy Gift of barking loud, Is like thy preaching to the Croud. Nor is it difficult to find The various Tempers of Mankind, By making a judicious handle O'th' diff'rent Dogs we're apt to fondle. The Country Squire that doats upon His Hounds, above his Wife or Son, And twice or thrice a Week prepares To worry Foxes, Bucks, or Hares, Discovers that his Dogs and he, Each other love by sympathy, And that his Worship and his Creatures Are both of persecuting Natures; Only this difference we find, 'Twixt rav'noues Hounds and human kind; One only hunts their proper Game, When Hunger prompts 'em to the same, But cruel Man, with Plenty blest, His Pride and Avarice to feast, Will prey on Man as well as Beast. The Mod'rate Sportsman thinks it better To keep a Greyhound, or a Setter, By which he shows himself too wise For any Break-neck Exercise. Hunting, he thinks, is only fit For March-Beer Sots, not Men of Wit, To carry off last Night's Carouzing, And Spirit up another Boozing; But Fishing, Coursing, Shooting, Setting, The ranging of the Dogs, the Netting, Are Pastimes that in safety yield All the true Pleasures of the Field; Such as delight, but never tease The Mind that loves to be at ease: Besides, the Greyhound and the Setter, Are of a soothing tender Nature, So beauteous in their Limbs and Heads, Altho' of diff'rent Shapes and Breeds, That they are worthy of their Food, For only to be stroak'd and view'd. And as these Dogs are of a kind And gentle Temper, so we find Their Masters seldom want a Soul, Free, Generous and Affable; Tho' we must own, no gen'ral Rules Without Exceptions in the Schools. The killing Tribe, who are the Sole Support of Hockley in the Hole, Who at their Arses hang their Steels, Must have their Bull-Dogs at their Heels, Those low'ring ill-look'd ugly Creatures, That threat'n destruction in their Features, Leering at e'ery step they take, With vicious Eyes and Noses black, Expressing so much Spight and Ire, As if the Devil had been their Sire, And that their hold-fast moody kind, For Mischief only were design'd. Therefore, we in the Brute may see His Master's Rage and Cruelty. For e'ery Mortal that is prone To keep a Dog, will pick out one Whose Qualities are like his own. The Poulterer, bred up to deal In Wigeon, Mallard, Duck and Teal, As well as Dunghil-Fowl, and broods Of Birds, that dwell in Fields and Woods, Keeps and admires the Water-Breed, For his long Ears and mottl'd Head, And for his chief Diversion hugs The Spaniel, as the Dog of Dogs; Because his Keeper knows full well, Poor Tray does in two Gifts excel, That is, he'll play both fast and loose, And hunt a Duck, or steal a Goose; Therefore his Master loves that Sort Of Dog, for Profit and for Sport, And can apply the Whelp, at leisure, Either to Int'rest or to Pleasure. So Strumpets of the lower Class Do the like Qualities embrace, And make a pretty decent Living, Of sometimes Sporting, sometimes Thieving. Poor Alley Scoundrels, at their Doors, Have always little yelping Curs, Who by their noisy Barkings tell, Where Sots and Scolds in Discord dwell, And to each Passenger make known Their Keeper's Failings by their own. The surly Tinker, when he Travels, Who prides in drunken Broils and Cavils, Must have a Dog to bear is Budget, Wheree'er his Worship's pleas'd to trudge it: A Mongrel of some ugly Breed, That's better for to hang than feed: In whose sowre Aspect we may find The Master's rough unpolish'd Mind: Or, vice versa, in the Rogue, Behold the Nature of the Dog. Thus both in each we may discover, For one's the Picture of the other. Ladies have little Lap-Dog Elves, Cross-grain'd, and pretty, like themselves. Who snarl and bark at all but those To whom fair Madam favour shows; And if the Mistress does approve you, Jewel, in course, is taught to love you. Bailiffs and Watchmen have their Dogs, Who growl at all that pass, but Rogues. Beggars their Curs, that disagree, And yelp at e'ery thing they see, But stinking Rags and Poverty. All Men, in short, that take delight In surly Brutes, that snarl and bite, Make choice, tho' to themselves unknown, Of such whose Natures sute their own, That each judicious Observator May guess the Master by the Creature. Reader, I beg you will excuse This long digression of my Muse; Consider, Travellers will stray, Sometimes, a little out o'th' Way, But now again we steer our Feet Into the common Road or Street. By this time Will and I had straddl'd, Or rather puff'd, and blow'd, and waddl'd, 'Till we arriv'd, by gentle Paces, At those two miserable Places, Where poor insolvent Debtors dwell, Confin'd within a local Hell, Where Goalers act the Parts of Devils, And punish Mortals for their Evils; As if within those cursed Walls, Where Man in vain for Mercy calls, Each surly Keeper, in his Place, Could find no other Happiness, Than in tormenting those poor Wretches, Secur'd within their Iron Hatches. Here bearded Scarecrows, almost dead, Stood begging at the Grates for Bread, Imploring Help, in doleful Tones, Succeeded by such Sighs and Groans, As would have mov'd Hearts made of Stones. Their Keepers standing within hearing, Grasping full Flaggons, drinking, swearing, As if their Pleasure and their Pride, And all the Comforts they enjoy'd, Consisted in the dismal Fare Of those beneath their cursed Care. So Imps, appointed to torment The damn'd, as some Divines consent, Make their own Miseries the less, By plaguing others to excess. From thence our crooked Course we bent, Into the famous Street of Kent, Where Wholesale Broom-men live in State, Like Merchants, tho' not quite so Great, Because they chuse to dwell in Cots, Not bigger much then Rabbit-Huts, They take no Pride in useless Splendor, But scoff at all external Grandeur, And laugh at Prodigals brought low, By wracking Rents and outward show: They labour hard for Beef and Pudding, And live without much Thought or Stud'ing, Their daily Bus'ness needs no Brains, Their Work is at their Fingers ends; And when it's o'er they wet their Beards, And guzzle till as great as Lords. This makes their Vict'lers Rich and Proud, Who soar above the common Crowd, And by the help of others Labours, Exalt their Horns above their Neighbours, And wallow with their swanking Spouses, Not in low Hunts, but lofty Houses, Above the rest, so near the Sky, That they're at least—Two Story high. So Lawyers, in our Country Towns, Not only fleece and awe the Clowns, But by their Cunning live like Lords, In the best House each Town affords. Here Piles of Brooms in order lay, By Chandlers to be swept away; Where frowning Sluts lean'd o'er their Hatches, Whose Pimples serv'd their Cheeks for Patches, Some looking with their Beetle Brows, And Udders dirtier than a Sows, As fierce as any Bedlam Queen, When teasing Boys have rais'd her Spleen. Some of a Scotch Complexion were, With freckly Cheeks and yellow Hair, Cover'd with Night-caps worn to Rags, Black as the Devil's Nutting-Bags, Thro' Holes of which their sweaty Locks Appear'd uncomb'd, like matted Flocks That from a tatter'd Cushion start, Where Grandsire us'd to sit and Fart. Others more tidy than the rest, Were dress'd one half, and half undress'd, Brisk jolly Dames, who, tho' their Faces Could boast no courtly Smiles or Graces, Yet each appear'd to be a Woman Too good, for Water-man or Broom-man; Tho' here and there perhaps a Blemish Might pall an Appetite that's squeamish; That is, a sweaty Ear, or so, Might thro' a dirty Pinner flow; Or other small defects arise, Offensive to the Nose or Eyes, That even whilst their Charms invade us Their Failings, from their Arms disswade us. Thus Woman's Beauty has its Darts, But does not always wound our Hearts; 'Tis Cleanliness, as well as Feature, That makes her such a lovely Creature. As for the moody rugged Spouses, In Wedlock ty'd to these poor Hussies, With frowsy Beards and rusty Hides, Herculean Limbs and Rawbone Sides, They seem'd like Slaves that got a Living By Working, some, the rest by Thieving; Some looking like good honest Fellows, Others as if they drop'd from Gallows, Wearing their Fortunes in their Faces, Just as Rogues do in other Places; For where the Conscience is not clear, Guilt in the Forehead will appear. By this time our industrious Feet Had measur'd this long tedious Street, And brought us to that famous House, The Lock, where Sinners lie in Souse, Till by long driv'ling they remove The painful Fruits of pleasing Love, And after all their loose Debauches, Become as safe and sound as Roaches. Here rev'rend Bawds and batter'd Bullies. Young rotten Punks and ruin'd Cullies, Discarded Mistresses and Play'rs, From Barthol'mew and Southwark Fairs; Daughters that run away from Mothers, And Wives that leave their Mates for others; Here all are welcome to repair Their aching Limbs or damag'd Ware; And by low Diet and Purgation, At least by gentle Salivation, In spight of Ulcers, Scabs and Tetters, May soon be made new wholsome Creatures, Altho' perhaps not quite so fair And handsome as before they were: Because in such a Case, you know, A Nose may chance to drop, or so. Now, to the easing of our Bones, We turn'd our backs upon the Stones, Which had not only tir'd our Hocks, But ruffl'd my Companions Socks, Which made him hobble, pick and chuse His Way, as if h'ad Peas in's Shoes: But now the Coss-way that we trod B'ing smoothly rais'd above the Road, Our Pedestals much more at ease, And all things mending by degrees, Fine Gardens to refresh the Sight, Upon the Left and on the Right, Rich Yeomen jogging their fat Arses To Town, upon their long-tail'd Horses, With here and there a Sunburnt Higler, 'Twixt Panniers, on a pacing Rigler, Sometimes a Hackney Coach and Six, In which both Sexes kindly mix Their wanton Legs, conceal'd from sight, And so sit crowded, with delight, Till Tunbridge-wells they do arrive at, And there consummate what they drive at. These various Scenes that did appear, The Fields, the Trees, the Heavens clear, And many more engaging Views, That did our Eyes and Minds amuse, Besides a cooling Breeze to fan us, And chirping Birds to entertain us, Refresh'd us so, when we were gone Some Furlongs from the stinking Town, That we began to mend our Pace, And walk—as if we walk'd a Race. Now no uneasiness appear'd, Nor were the least Complainings heard, The ruffl'd Socks were quite forgot, And both were pleas'd, tho' sweating hot: But that which made our Journey still The more delightful, was, that Will Had against Sleep so well provided, He look'd as broad awake as I did; Had shaken off his drowsy Fits, That ty'd his Tongue and numb'd his Wits, And drown'd his old Lethargick Sloth, In merry Whims that pleas'd us both. At length a Parson in his Gown, Came gently jogging tow'rds the Town, Upon a little shag-tail'd Mare, Her colour Grey, her Bones but bare, Looking as if alike expert, At galling Saddle, or at Cart: The Rev'rend Rider, as he met us, Did with most courteous Manners treat us, Good Morrow, Gentlemen, said he; Your Servant, Doctor, answer'd we: And so we pass'd as Friends, or rather, As Christian Sons should pass a Father. For he that Honours not his Guide, Has no Religion but his Pride. The next we met appear'd to be, By his external Sanctity, A surly Nonconformist Teacher, By solemn Face, some Alley Preacher, With Lanthorn Jaws and Roman Nose, A flapping Hat without a Rose; A Wig whose formal Curls bespoke him A hungry Saint, Church Porridge The Common-Prayer is so call'd by some Dissenters. choak him. His Riding Coat not black nor gray, But of a hue quite out o'th' way; As if his awkward Dress and Frame Were meant, in Holy Calvin's Name, To shew his Conscience eke the same. The Horse that he vouchsaf'd to sit Upon, was neither Scrub not Tit, But a large pamper'd Jade that trod As if he scorn'd the common Road, And into Sloughs and Ruts would stray, To show he lov'd no beaten Way. For Horses, when Fanaticks ride 'em, Like the poor Asses that provide 'em, Must go which way their Riders guide 'em Stirrups of Metal, I suppose, Were too fatiguing to his Toes, Or whether he might think 'em Fop'ry, Vain Baubles us'd in time of Pop'ry, I know not, but his skinny pair Of Legs, of which he'd wondrous Care, Were safely shelter'd in Gambages, Worn by the Saints in former Ages, When Hippocrites spurn'd Holy Robes, And pious Coblers preach'd in Tubs. As thus the Saint was riding by, Good Morrow, Sir, said Will and I; For Men of Breeding love to show Good Manners, whether due or no. He turn'd his Head and frown'd upon us, As if by dint of Grace h'ad known us, Pass'd by as haughty as a Lord, And puff'd, but answer'd ne'er a Word. Where was that Fellow bred, said Guy, At Utrick? Where d'ye think? said I, A foreign College far exceeding All others, for Fanatick Breeding, Where Men, like Lawyers in a Court, Ne'er speak except we pay 'em for't. 'Tis hard, said I, that yonder Guide, Who jogs tow'rd London, should bestride So poor a Tit, and Doctor Cant, On such a costly Gelding vaunt. But so it is, for Vertue here Does in the lowest Rank appear, Whilst moody Blockheads gain the start, Of learn'd Divines and Men of Art. Besides, i'th' Parson's Mare we see The Rider's meek Humility, And by her Shapes and Paces know She's kept for Service more than show; But by the other's pamper'd Horse, You may unmask the Saint in course. And read his Temper and his Trade, In the proud Goings of the Jade; For as he keeps and does bestride A stately Gelding for his Pride, So, for his Profit, the good Man, Like others of his crafty Clan, Will ride his Betters if he can. By this time we began to think Of Breakfast, and a little Drink, Resolving to refresh and ease Our hungry Maws with Bread and Cheese, And moisten well our dusty Clay, At the next Alehouse in our Way: Accordingly, we found a Place Which suited well our present Case, A pretty little tippling Hovel, Where Pedlars call at as they travel, And where the Kentish Drovers stop To light their Pipes and take a Cup: Here also we agreed to bait; So in we stept, and down we sat, Attended by a fair young Maiden, No frisky Lass, no Country Hoyden, But one that in her sober Face, Had outward Signs of inward Grace. Sweetheart, said I, (but first I kiss'd her, Who took it like a Holy Sister) Prithee assist us, if you please, With some good Ale, and Bread and Cheese. She answer'd, Yes, it should be done, But slur'd a Fizzle as she run: Which gave my Friends fat Sides a fit Of Laughing, till they almost split. But this unhappy Flirt delay'd The coming of the conscious Maid, Who tarry'd till she'd quite defac'd Those Blushes her Mischance had rais'd, And then return'd with what she went for, Without being further call'd or sent for. But as one Failing did betide The Maid's unfortunate Backside, Which by a little Slip behind, Discover'd Women are but Wind; So now worse Fortune did attend The pond'rous Crupper of my Friend, Which caus'd the Maid to laugh much more At him, than he at her before; For Will, who had by chance forgot His bulky Sides and weight, god wot, Had plac'd his Bum, for want of Care, Upon an ancient feeble Chair, Beneath whose crazy Bottom sat A poor old fond familiar Cat, Licking her mundifying Paws, With which she stroak'd her Ears and Jaws, Will having in his Mouth a Crust Of Bread and Cheese, to please his gust, And in his Hand a Mug of Beer, To wash down his dry husky Cheer; But as between the Cup and Lip Impediments do often slip, The rotten Chair at once fell flat, And down came Will upon the Cat; The Drink, in this unhappy Fall, Was quite demolish'd, Mug and all; Some had the luck to find its way Into his Codpiece, as he lay, Which put his Tarriwags in Pickle, And made 'em shrink to very little: Poor Puss, beneath his Breech lay squalling, As if she'd been a Caterwauling, And that poor Will, who turn'd her over, Had been some strenuous Boar-cat Lover: Puss cry'd out Murder very loudly, And scratch'd &amp; claw'd for Life most blood'ly, Till Will, whose Bum began to feel Her Tallons, sharp as pointed Steel, Made from the Cat a nimble Bound, And rais'd his Body from the Ground, Ram her, says Will, that Witch of Witches, Has claw'd by Arse quite thro' my Breeches. Then groaping for his Ware, he found That all was very safe, but drown'd; So squeezing from his Shirt the Stout And Ale, as well as Hands could do't, Wringing his Lappets with his Fist, As Nurses do their Clouts bepist; He button'd up his damag'd Ware, And beg'd they'd bring a stronger Chair, Whilst the poor Cat, 'twixt Life and Death, Lay struggling on the Floor for Breath, Mew'd very faintly, 'till at length, Poor Wretch, she gather'd so much Strength, As to arise and crawl away To Chimney-corner, where she lay, And smooth'd her Fur from Head to Tail, Oppress'd by Weight and soil'd by Ale, Mewing as if she meant Forgiveness To him that wrong'd her with his Heaviness, And that in case she pin'd and dy'd, He should not be arraign'd, or try'd On her account, for Caticide, Our Landlord, who might justly fear The downful of a second Chair, Rowl'd in a mighty round of Oak, That long had been some Butcher's Blocks, And fixing it upon the Floor, Where Will had foil'd his Bum before, Humbly desir'd him to dispence With that soft Stool, without Offence, Because his Chairs were all too slight And feeble to support his weight. My Cherubim, not pleas'd to think He'd broke his Chair and spilt his Drink, Reply'd, But Landlord, (Lord defend me) Have you no Cushion you could lend me, I've bruis'd my Buttocks by my fall, And this damn'd Stool's the Dev'l and all. With that the Daughter fetch'd him down A Pillow to repose upon; And placing it beneath his Rump, My Cherub Will now sat in Pomp, Eat Bread and Cheese like Country Carter, And guzzl'd like a London Porter, Till Thirst and Hunger were subdu'd, And Sleep more welcome was than Food. Then with his drowzy Eyelids clos'd, He breath'd such Musick whilst he doz'd, That drew my Landlord's grunting Herd, From their old Swill-Trough in the Yard, To see what Hog it was that snor'd. Whilst Will thus slept, as if h'ad got French Horns and Bagpipes in his Throat, And that they stuck so by the way, He could not breathe, but he must play, I smoak'd my Pipe, enjoy'd my Whim, And view'd my drowsy Cherubim: His Back he plac'd against a stout Brick-Wall, and turn'd t'wards Heav'n his Snout, Which awkward Posture made him seem To be Stargazing in his Dream; His Left-hand on his Knee for ease, His Right-hand stuff'd with Bread and Cheese, Not grasp'd so close but that between His Fingers Vict'als might be seen: As this unhappy Hand of his Was hanging down betwixt his Thighs, A mettl'd Cock, as 'twas his use, Came boldly stalking thro' the House, And at his Heels a cackling Crowd Of Hens and all their little Brood, Their nimble roving Eyes soon found The Crumbs we'd scatter'd on the Ground, Then flocking hastily together, As Birds will do of the same Feather; After the Cock had chose his place And said a chuckling sort of Grace, They all fell furiously on, Like Ravens in a Field new sown, Dispatching with exceeding haste, Their slender accidental Feast; The Cock, when they had clear'd the Floor, As he was peering round for more, Espy'd the Bread and Cheese contain'd In Will's repository Hand, Whose Fingers at some distance lay, As Rackstaves do before the Hay, The Cock he boldly peck'd between, Chuckl'd, withdrew, then to't agen, Till his Example taught the rest, O'th' cackling Brood to take a taste, Who now contending who should share The most of the voluptuous Fare, So peck'd his Fingers that the smart Awak'd poor Will and made him start And stare as if some frightful Dream Of murd'ring Rogues had gally'd him; But finding that the Hens were busy About him, and his Hand uneasy, He flings the remnant of his Bread And Cheese at this and t'other's Head, Call'd for the Reck'ning in a hurry, And thus express'd his Rage and Fury: Have I, said he, forsook the best Of Wives, that ever Man embrac'd, And left my Dwelling and my Dear, To be Cat-claw'd and Hen-peck'd here? Have I declin'd an easy Seat, Whose strength would bear an Ox's weight, And rambl'd all these Miles from Home, To bruise and thus abuse my Bum, First by a crazy Chair that broke, And next by this damn'd Heart of Oak; So hard, 'tis fitter, by my Soul, For a Smith's Anvil than a Stool. Then summ'd up all his Exclamation, Arising from his frothy Passion, With, Come, here's to thee, Friend,—let's pay And go,—We've made too long a stay. So giving to the House content, We Conge'd, and away we went. Now, like true Travellers we drudg'd Along, and chatted as we trudg'd. By this time Sol full South was got, And shin'd so very bright and hot, That we began to melt, and run To Oil, like Butter in the Sun, Or rather drip'd, as on we trotted, Like Woodcocks at the Fire ungutted. Says Will, If walking in such Weather Can really be esteem'd a pleasure. Who thinks it so might take a pride In being roasted, bak'd, or fry'd; Or in a Glass-House dwell in Summer, As most delightful to their Humour. My transitory Corps, I find, Is not o'th' Salamander kind; I'd rather, like a Frog, desire To live in Water than in Fire: And as for this same sweet delight Of Walking, now the Sun's so bright, I think such Exercise and Air, Are Trifles to an Elbow-Chair. 'Tis wondrous pleasant, you must know, To sweat, and gall, and puff, and blow, And with the scorching Gravel heat Our tender and uneasy Feet. Then lifting up his Eyes he said, I'm almost spent; and thus he pray'd: Lord grant us, in this sultry Way, Coach, Waggon, Cart, or Brewer's Dray, Or any Vehicle to bless A dripping Mortal in distress; If not, I shall be melted quite T'a Skeleton before 'tis Night, And lose more bulk by this damn'd sweating, Than I shall gain by six Months eating. Come, come, (said I) chear up my Mate, We have not many Miles to sweat, Besides, a Country Walk is good To breathe your Lungs and stir your Blood, And carry off, by Perspiration, Nutritious Juices that occasion That drowsy Humour of Nutation. Prithee, (says Will) torment me not, I'm sick, I'm faint, I'm dry and hot: You talk like an Apothecary, I tell you I'm both gall'd and weary, And that to ambulate much further, Would be to me, at least, Self-murder, Therefore I'll tarry at next Inn, And not commit that deadly Sin. As thus we dialogu'd for Sport, To make our Journey seem more short, A formal Quaker and his Bride Came riding by us, side by side. Rachel, 'tis true, had in her Face Some sprinkl'd Signs of Love and Grace, Dissembling, when we look'd upon her, As if no mortal Man had known her, But Thomas leer'd beneath his Hat, As if he well knew what was what, And had uncover'd in his Youth, Many a poor Handmaid's naked Truth. For as the wisest often stray, So G? Almighty's Lambs will play. Says I to Will, This godly pair Of Saints, as they believe they are, Remind me of a Buxom Jade, A pritty Friend, but lately wed, Who finding that her Spouse neglected Those carnal Comforts she expected, And one day visiting her Mother, Chatting about this, that, and 'tother, As the old Matron sat demure, She put this merry Question to her, Pray, Mother, dost thee think, at Night, That Men enjoy as much delight In Bed, as Women do, when they Their Husband's carnal Wills obey. Yes, Child, reply'd the grave old Dame, No doubt but they enjoy the same. Lord, Mother, if thy Words be true, Said Ruth, I wonder, so may you, Men do't no oftner than they do. A merry Jade, says Will, I'll warrant, As e'er complain'd to such a Parent, For all their formal Looks and Dress, And their external Holiness, Among themselves they have their Jokes And Gibes as well as other Fo'kes. By this time my complaining Friend And I, had hobbl'd to South-End, Where, in a wooden Mansion dwells A Man of Metal, that excels All other Vulcans in the rare Calibeate Art of cutting Ware: No Yorkshire Carrier, at a Meal, Durst draw a Sheffield Blade of Steel, And boast his cutting Country Bauble, If one of How's adorn the Table: Thrir rustick Tools are only fit For rural Poesies, void of Wit, And to divide fat Pork and Peasen, Or cut down Hooks in Nutting Season; But hungry Mortals must allow, A Blade beneath the Stamp of How, If touch'd upon a Stair or Stone, Will slice a Surloin to the Bone, And at one stroak, to human Wonder, Divide the stubborn Joints asunder, Nah, if it's whetted as it ought, Will shave a Beard or cut a Throat. A sharp Experiment, 'tis true, But Fools have try'd the same e're now, For poor desparing Souls that find The Conflicts of a troubl'd Mind, Oft kill themselves by the abuse Of things design'd for human use. Near to How's boarded Palace stood A Brick House, facing that of Wood, Whose Sign sufficiently denoted, It was a place where Bumpkins sotted, And at Good Times, like merry Rogues, Treated their home-spun Joans and Jugs. Says Will, No Man shall make me stir, God save the King, beyond this Door; In this same House, as I'm a Sinner, I'll ease my Corps and eat my Dinner. Accordingly we stop'd our speed, And enter'd in, both well agreed. Tho' oft we find, when two consort In any one fatiguing Sport, The Man that first desires to rest, Is made his own Companions Jest. My Cherub now took special care In chusing of a strong built Chair, His injur'd Bum not yet forgetting Its last deceitful oversetting: He also peer'd beneath his Seat, Lest Puss should lurk between the Feet, As an ill Omen to portend Some ugly Mischief in the end; But finding no defect, nor Cat, With manly Courage down he sat, Pull'd off his Stockings, to remove And change his Socks from Hoof to Hoof, Whilst I to wipe my Face began, And fed my Nose with Parmazan. When Bill had eas'd his tender Feet, And I had dry'd my Head from Sweat, We then conceiv'd 'twas time to think Of what to eat and what to drink; For not a Clown, or rural Swain, Retir'd from Plough, or from the Plain, Could boast a keener Appetite Than we, to either soop or bite; But Drought b'ing more predominant Than Hunger, as the Learned grant; We both agreed to call at first For Beer, to quench our craving Thirst, Only a bit of Bread to chew, For fear a Surfeit should ensue: Accordingly a thumping Pot Of humming Liquor soon was brought. Which smil'd and look'd as brisk upon us, As if some Favour had been done us; And that the jolly handsome Dame, Who, to oblige us, drew the same, Had broach'd a Cask of Aristippus, In hopes she might the longer keep us. For cunning Alewives, when they'r grown Expert, to diff'rent Taps can run, When their poor Husbands know but one. Now, by delicious hissing Draughts We quench'd the Fever in our Throats, With Liquor so divinely good, Bacchus no richer ever brew'd, Or Heathen God, when thirsty, boast Such Nectar at so little cost: 'Twas old and soft, strong, pale and bright, Well boil'd, well tasted, smooth and light, And fit, in droughty Climes, to rince The Gullet of the greatest Prince. Poets may please themselves with thinking Of their Gods eating and their drinking: But their thin Food, for ought we know, And Bowls that at their Banquets flow, Would starve us Mortals here below. Therefore my Friend and I took care To ask for more substantial Fare, And, by th'assistance of our Dame, Regal'd our selves with Stakes of Lamb; Which being fry'd, altho' but coarsly, Went down with Butter and some Parsly, And check'd that Fury which, 'tis said, Will break Stone Walls to come at Bread. If so, 'tis hard the Poor should die For only stealing to supply That Hunger which the Rich defy. Our Bellies now b'ing fully blest, Our Bones desir'd to be at rest; According, we, by joint consent, To sleep our Inclinations bent, And in a trice were both as fast As Dormice, when the Summer's past. Old Morpheus had no sooner hung His Plummets on my Eyes and Tongue, But an odd Dream possest my Crown, That I was driving Hogs to Town: For Fancy, which so often keeps, Her Revels whilst the Body sleeps, Transform'd me to a Country Hob, With a white Felt upon my Nob, A canvas Frock to save my Cloaths, And clouted Shoes to guard my Toes; Haybands about my Ankles girt, To skreen my Stockings from the Dirt, And in my Hand a cutting Thong, To drive my stubborn Herd along: Sometimes, methoughts they'd scowre like Gennets, And then run retrograde like Planets, Some stop and wallow in the Mire, Others like founder'd Jades would tire; Or like Fanaticks full of spight, Turn e'ery Way, except the right; I flog'd their Tails, as angry Pedant Does his Boys Bums when they have need on't, And laid about me till they grunted, Like Farmers Hogs by Towzer hunted. At length I wak'd in great surprise, First scratch'd my Ears, then rub'd my Eyes, Look'd round me, found my self mistaken, And that I'd lost, not sav'd my Bacon; For all my wild unruly Herd Vanish'd as soon as Light appear'd. Nor could I guess what caus'd my Dream, Except my snoring Cherubim, Who, as he slumbet'd in his Chair, Breath'd forth such strange sonif'rous Air, As fill'd my Head with all the Sounds That grunting Hogs or yelping Hounds Could yield; from whence I do suppose My sympathizing Dream arose. For if we dozing chance to hear The Watch, at Night, cry Thieves or Fire, 'Tis odds but that 'twixt then and Morning, We dream of Robbing or of Burning. So, slumbring near a snoring Mortal, Loud as a Bagpipe, Drone, or Curtel, His various Snortings might incline My drowsy Head to dream of Swine. The Heavens now began to lower, And threat'n us with a hasty Shower, Which soon refresh'd the dusty Roads, And turn'd to Clay the thirsty Clods. My Cherub waking from his Doze, And turning up his Eyes and Nose, Surpris'd to hear so very plain The noisy pett'rings of the Rain, Cry'd out, These pistail Clouds, I fear, Will fix us, till the Morning, here. Says he, I'm like a Cat, or rather, A Bird, I can't abide foul Weather. I'd sooner put the Pot about, And wet my Inside well with Stout, Than travel to be wet without. Said I, If't must be so, then fill A Pipe: Here's to thee honest Will, Remembring both our distant Spouses, That like sweet Bryars grace our Houses, And all those little Comforts too, To whom our loving Care is due. With all my Heart and Soul, replies My Cherub, tend'ring with his Eyes, As if the kind good-natur'd Creature Had been convey'd by Wind and Water, A thousand Leagues from Wife &amp; Daughter. As thus we near the Window sat, Smoaking and talking this and that, Hoping that Providence would send us Some Coach, that might from Rain defend us, Who should we cast our Eyes upon, But our Friend's Servant, honest John, Riding Post haste upon a Steed That wanted neither Strength nor Speed, We hal'd him till we made him hear, And quickly stop'd his full career, First bid him drink, then told our Case, And beg'd th'assistance of a Chaise: He answer'd, much to our delight, We should have one 'twixt that and Night, But he to Greenwich first must ride, And back, e'er we could be supply'd. However promis'd, that indeed He'd come, with all convenient speed. So took his leave, rid off in haste, As if he ment no time to waste. This joyful News, with t'other Cup, So rais'd my Cherub's Spirits up, That no King's Jester, of a certain, Could be more pleasant and diverting: Whate'er he said was smart and witty, And all he did was wond'rous pritty. He now could move his Legs about, Before, he could not stir a Foot. But gave 'em ease, and would excuse 'em, For fear he should be forc'd to use 'em, Till promise of the Chaise, we needed, Secur'd him from the Walk he dreaded. So lazy Persons oft complain Of Lameness, Numbness, or of Pain, To save themselves a little trouble, By making it to others double. We now began to pass away The small remainder of the Day, In that redundant Chat of Chats, Concerning our dear Wives and Brats, That by exhibiting, like Nodies, The Graces of their Minds and Bodies, We might dissemblingly express Our own great Joy and Happiness, And thus with seeming Pleasure bear, The Shackles we were forc'd to wear. So those Philosophers of old, That hug'd their Rags and slighted Gold, Labour'd to make the World agree The sweetest Bride was Poverty. Lord send no Friend of mine may wed her, Or any honest Mortal Bed her. For wheresoe'er she comes, she brings A thousand cursed Plagues and Stings, Which an old Sage, to Wisdom bent, Perhaps may turn into Content. To him we'll leave her, who knows how To manage such a vagrant Sow; Daughter of Laziness and Vice, Mother of Nastiness and Lice, Hated by Country, Shire and Borough, And dreaded all the Kingdom thorough, Tho' now at present forc'd upon us, By artful Knaves that have undone us. May Trade soon banish her abroad, And Justice put an end to Fraud. Old England mourn her Follies past, And her Hope-Anchor wisely cast, Where she may safely ride once more, In Grandure, as She did before She struck upon the South-Sea Shore. After we'd sat an Hour or two Expecting, we impatient grew, Uneasy Fears and teasing Doubts, Began to put us in the Pouts, Lest Fortune, who to often plays Her jilting Tricks, should stop our Chaise, And after all our Hopes, compel us To Walk, or lodge that Night in Alehouse; But as we thus divided were, 'Twixt Expectation and Despair, Our watchful Eyes, as we sat humming, Beheld our two-wheel'd Chariot coming, Which fill'd us with such sudden Joys, We skip'd and leap'd like two great Boys, Call'd for the Reck'ning, paid our Cash, And gladly mounted our Calash, Buckl'd our Leathern Curtains close, To keep out two intruding Foes, The Wind and Rain, which join'd together, And made but sorry Harvest Weather. However, we sat well secur'd, But John the heavy Drops endur'd, Sitting before expos'd to all The Hardships that from Heaven could fall; For he the flogging Scepter sway'd, Whose gentle Strokes the Horse obey'd, And by his mild Correction knew What sort of Work he was to do; A Chirrup made him Trot full fast, A Lash would make him mend his haste: But when John Whistl'd, then the Horse Would stop, at leastwise hang an Arse, And showing he was sound at Heart, Would labour hard to Piss and Fart; Therefore ye Learned Heads that pry Into deep Myst'ries, tell we why, A Coachman's or a Carman's Whistle, Should cause a Horse to Stale and Fizzle. Night drawing on, our Charioteer Now flog'd his Prancer flank and reer, And drove us, Jehu-like, along The splashy Road, by dint of Thong, Till Will and I in State were drawn, By painful Pulls to Bromley Town, Where our kind Friend vouchsaf'd to meet us, And with a Flask of Red would treat us, We neither of us car'd for lighting, But took a flying Bumper sitting, That made our drowsy Hearts more light And fit to travel in the Night, Which prov'd as dismal and as dark As the low'r Deck of Noah's Ark, Or any Dungeon in the deep, Where Neptune and his Tritons sleep. We had not travel'd far beyond The Town, on wet and slipp'ry Ground, But the poor Horse, tho' tough and strong, Fatigu'd to drag his Load along, In lab'ring with a hearty Will, To pull three Lubbers up the Hill, Put his old Geer so out of order, That the poor Jade could draw no further, Till some judicious Hand had mended The Harness, which our Weight had rended. My drowsy Cherub, honest Will, Slept on the while and thought no ill, But snor'd behind his Leathern Curtain, Not dreaming of our sad Misfortune; Till Friends, who had at Bromley stay'd Sometime, to end their Flask of Red, Came riding up, with horned Light, To guide 'em in so dark a Night, And finding us in this Distress, Enquir'd into our present Case; Which when we told 'em, some assisted With Garters, which we strongly twisted: Another found a Knife to cut The Holes thro' which the Strings were put; So that we made a shift to cobble Our broken Trace with little trouble. But as our Heads and Hands together, Thus strove to mend our Harness Leather, The tattling of our Tongues, by chance, Awak'd my Cherub from his Trance, Who hearing such a verbal clutter, Put by his Leathern Skreen, or Shutter, And by the glim'ring Candle-light, Beholding this uncommon sight, On Horseback some, and some on Foot, Engag'd about our little Hut, And finding also that it stood Quite motionless upon the Road, Rashly concluded, in amaze, A Gang of Rogues had stop'd our Chaise; And thus possess'd with pannick Fear, Cry'd out, Lord, what's the matter here? How is it John? Who, where, and what! Must we be rob'd, or must we not? Then fumbl'd up and down his Clothes, To hide his Gold, as I suppose, But glancing on a Friend he knew, Cry'd out, My Father, how d'ye do? I'm glad, dear Sir, to find 'tis you. I dreamt just now we were beset, Which put me in a bloody Sweat. But pray, what is't that stops our going, For God's sake, what are we a doing? To that our Friend reply'd, in course, You sleepy Knave, your heavy Arse Has broke the Harness of the Horse, And we are fixing Matters right, That you mayn't tarry here all Night. I'm glad, says Will, to hear you tell us, No worse an Accident befel us. Since 'tis no greater a Mishap, Good Night, I'll e'en take t'other Nap. Then drew the Curtains of his Bed, And did according as he said. Thus Morpheus does by turns surprise, With leaden Weights, all human Eyes, But does his Pow'r the most exert, O'er bulky Mortals fat at Heart. Our Tackle now was well repair'd, And Dobbin trotted on full hard. Tho' as our nimble Wheels run round, They deeply plow'd the yielding Ground, And made the Ruts still more profound. So Northern Coaches, when the're full Of drowsy Scribes, from York or Hull, The Wheels complaining of their Load, To Furrows grind the level Road. Our Lanthorn now, by means of Light, Drew Bats and other Birds of Night, To sport before our moving Chaise, And wonder at the glim'ring Rays, Whilst hooting Owls, our Ears to please, Forsook their Barns and hollow Trees, And with their sweet nocturnal Strains, That Fairies dance to on the Plains, Most kindly charm'd us as we went, And bid us welcome into Kent. So when a Highland Lord goes down To Scotland, from this wicked Town, His Vassals with their Bagpipes come To meet him, and with squeak and hum, Conduct him safe along the Road, Thus tweedle 'im to his old abode, With Musick that would fright a Toad. We now most gladly had obtain'd Our Wish, that is, our Journey's end, For at new whited Gates, as bright As Stars, and visible by Night, The chearful Driver and his Steed, Put a full Punctum to their Speed, Our Charioteer soon made a Bound From his low Coachbox to the Ground, The eager Horse knock'd with his Pate, To gain admission at the Gate, And neigh'd as loud as he was able, For Joy he was so near his Stable. My drowsy Cherub fell to stroaking His Eyes, and wak'd, for want of rocking, Stretching his Arms above his Head, Then, after gaping thrice, he said, O John! i'th' name of Peace, Amen. What are the Harness broke again. No, no, said I, this Stop, my Friend, I hope, compleats our Journey's end, John's only gone to fetch a Light, And then you'll see I tell you right. 'Tis News I'm very glad to hear, Replies my Fellow-Traveller, I vow I'm sorely tir'd from Head To Heel, I wish I was a Bed. For shame, said I, forbear to spake Of Bed, and thus but just awake. Had'st thou for seven Years no Food, But Dormice, and cold Lettice chew'd, And drank no other Liquor a'ter, But Lodinum, or Poppy-Water, You could not bend your nodding Brow To sleep, much more than you do now. By this time honest John return'd, Whose Absence my Companion mourn'd, And us, with the same Light befriended, Which on the Horsemen had attended, Who also came and lent a hand, To help us down upon the Land; My Cherub, who at e'ery Quarter Requir'd at least a Tackle Porter, Desir'd their utmost Care and Pow'r, To bring his Carcase safe a Shoar, Which, by good Conduct and main Strength, Was done effectually, at length, Altho' his pond'rous Body weigh'd As much as two Welch Cows, and made A perfect Earthquake round about The place where first he trod his Foot. So when great Jove, or other god, Descends in Chariot, or a Cloud, To visit Mortals, or ensnare Some beauteous Queen, divinely fair, Wheree'er he does vouchsafe to set His Foot, Earth trembles with the weight. Alike, unto the sodden Ground, We both were handed safe and sound, Walking a little, as 'twas fitting, To ease our Limbs, benumb'd with sitting, Fancy'ng the Earth, on which we trod, Mov'd like our Chaise upon the Road. Thus found at present, by our Brains, We both were turn'd Copernicans. So Sailors, who have long been toss'd And tumbl'd on the Seas they've cross'd, When they their Bark in Harbour moor, And quit the Water for the Shoar, They, for some time, retain the Motion Their Brains once borrow'd from the Ocean. Our kind and courteous Friend now show'd The Way into his sweet Abode, Where Friendship, Love, and Honour dwell, Those gen'rous Virtues that excel The common Mode of living low Within, to make an outside Show. 'Tis true, a stately Coach and Six, Fat Horses full of wanton Tricks, Rich Liv'ries, lazy Footmen, Pages, And swarms of Servants at Board-Wages, May lull the Great, and make 'em dream Of Pow'r and popular Esteem, But rural Peace and Happiness Appear in quite another Dress, And show their Grandeur in a free Access and Hospitality. Without regard to dirty Feet, We now were led into a neat Warm Parlour, where we found a kind, And hearty Welcome from our Friend; I'th' Chimney, to our Hearts desire, A flaming Pyramid of Fire, And round the Room a rich Collection Of Lutt'rel's Paintings to Perfection, Fine Creon Heads, that nothing wanted But Speech, to make 'em live, tho' painted; Some Fathers, whose sagacious Looks, Discover'd their chief Food was Books, And that they had at least digested A Volume to each Meal they tasted. Others were Pictures of the Fair, Whose Eyes would tempt, altho' but Air, Sweet charming Angels as they hung, The more—because without a Tongue. These were with Judgment interspers'd, As if they with the rest convers'd, To shew our Fathers lov'd to mix. Their Wisdoms with the beauteous Sex, Or else 'tis very plain and clear, That we their Sons had ne'er been here. Now Wines of divers sorts were brought, And noble Beer to quench our Drought, The Tankard and the Glass pursu'd Each other round, and both were good; Nor did we spare our Liquors, really, But oil'd our Gullets very freely, Just as old Gossips do their Throats At Christ'nings, and such merry Bouts, Where e'ery soop of Wine or Ale, Produces some new jocund Tale. The Cloth now decently was spread, And all things in good Order laid, A Supper plac'd upon the Board, Sufficient to have pleas'd a Lord: And that which more oblig'd each Guest, A hearty Welcome to the Feast. We all fell too, as soon as Grace Was said, like Hunters from a Chace, Or Bumpkins who had spent the Day In keeping Sheep or making Hay: Except my Cherub Will, whose Case Was very hard, I must confess, For Morpheus o'er his Eyes came creeping, And would not let him Eat for Sleeping: Not but he wanted to be tasting, But Somnus vow'd he'd keep him fasting. Just so a second-sighted Scot, Can charm a Bridegroom by a Knot, That when he strives to kiss his Bride, He shall not, till the Knot's unty'd. Quick Work we made and cut apace Our Way to th'periodick Grace, With which we soon agreed to seal Our plenteous and respectful Meal, That he who had an Inclination To moralize o'er Fumigation, Might blow his Tube, for fear of failure, Charge, Fire and Smoke, to show his Valour, And puff his Bob like any Sailor. Now some to Funking, some to Drinking, Others to Talking, without Thinking, Each forwarding such Tittle-tattle, As most diverting o'er the Bottle, Whilst honest Will, who snor'd in State, Like any midnight Magistrate, Gave now and then, with drowsy Head, Consenting Nods to what we said. Just so, a sleepy-headed May'r, When he assumes his Lordly Chair, Hears Causes often, when the Toil Of Bus'ness makes him dream the while. Good Manners now, by Time attended, From Wisdom's polish'd Throne descended, And humbly bowing down her Head, Declar'd old Tempus call'd to Bed: We kindly did the Hint receive, And beg'd our Friend would give us leave To be conducted to the Sheets, Meant for our several Retreats. To which Request, when we had mended Our Draughts, his Goodness condescended, For there's no parting in such Cases, Without our peremptory Glasses. Now the old Compliment, Good Night, Went round, and each Two had their Light And Servant, to conduct and show Each Couple to their bon Repo. We now began to shove and shake My Cherubim to make him wake, Crying aloud, Hold up your Head, You drowsy Mortal and to Bed. To Bed! that Saying made him start, Ay, ay, where is't? with all my Heart. Then rowz'd, and hasten'd to his Hive, As brisk as any Man alive. Thus as the Loadstone draws the Steel, So does the Bed my Cherub Will. All things in Nature covet rest, And join with what they like the best. As Will and I thro' Wind and Weather, Had travell'd all the Day together, 'Twas thought convenient we should close At Night, and join in our repose, To which we mutually consented, Undress'd, and went to Bed contented. No sooner had our Weight comprest The Down whereon we were to rest, Enclos'd with Curtains wrought by Art, Too richly fine for our Desert, But Will began to Serenade me, And with his Pipes such Musick made me, That sure Belfegar never heard, When the poor marry'd Devil was scar'd With Catcalls, Gelders-Horns, and Drumming, To make him think his Wife was coming. Sometimes he'd start upright in Bed, Brandish his Arms around his Head, As if he dreamt he was in deep Dispute with Monsters, in his Sleep, And that he fear'd he should be wounded By Bears and Dragons that surrounded. Amus'd at this unusual Scene, I strove to wake him now and then, But all I got by interposing, Whilst he was fighting thus and dozing, Was a good Knock upon my Noddle, The common Fate of those that meddle With such that in their groundless Passion Are dealing Blows without occasion, Or in their Sleep, possess'd with Fear, Scatter their Thumps they know not where. In this Disorder and Defiance Of Goblins, Bloody Bones, and Giants, And other sad tremendous Dreams, Of burning Mounts and drowning Streams, My Cherub in a sweating Fright, Consum'd (as I suppose) the Night. Whilst I, who lay'd awake beside him, Beat off the Hags they should not ride him, And like a good and faithful Guard, Till Morning, kept true Watch and Ward. The End of the First Part. Part II. The Sun now chasing from our sight, The fading Stars and dusky Night, With Blushes stain'd the azure Skies, And let us see 'twas time to rise; Accordingly, like nimble Fellows, We started from our downy Pillows, Each firing from his windy Stern, A Gun to welcome in the Morn. So Ships that battle Storms and Tides, With roaring Engines by their sides, At e'ery accidental meeting, Let thund'ring Farts, by way of greeting. My Chum and I, well pleas'd to gaze On bright Apollo's chearful Rays, Which glancing on the dewy Sward, Soon dry'd the sodden Surface hard, And to our comfort and delight, Exhal'd the Damps that fell by Night, Rend'ring the Garden, in a trice, So like a fruitful Paradise, That had a naked Eve been there, Adorn'd with nothing but her Hair, She might have found a loving, free, Kind Adam of my Friend or me, For both so very brisk were grown, That Woman, with her Charms alone, Might soon have tempted us to Evil, Without an Apple or the Devil. We now began to put our Cloaths on, And puff'd and blow'd to draw our Hose on; But when we were oblig'd to stoop, To garter and to buckle up, No huge tall lusty Granadier, Grown fat with Sutlers Ale and Beer, Ty'd Neck and Heels near half a Day, Perhaps for grumbling for his Pay, Could ever show a Face more red And black, with bowing down his Head, Than Will and I, when forc'd to squeeze Our Guts between our Breasts and Knees, To bring our Hands to dress our Feet, And make our Pedestals compleat. Such puffing was there then between us, And painful Pulls, that had you seen us, How like poor sweating Tackle-Porters, We lug'd and tug'd at our Shoe-Quarters, The dullest Mortal must have lent A Smile, amidst our Punishment; And that to show no Pains were spar'd, Each crack'd behind, we pull'd so hard; At length, half drown'd in Sweat and Slabber, We conquer'd the Herculean Labour; Not that the Fault was in our Shoes, Or largeness of our Feet and Toes, But in excess of Guts and Garbage, That show'd we eat more Flesh than Herbage. At length, my honest Comrade Will, And I, half dress'd in disabil, Descended the adjacent Grades, To wash, and be as clean as Maids, Which soon was done, and then we join'd Our Friends, who were alike inclin'd, To take a cool refreshing blast Of Air, before we broke our Fast: Accordingly we walk'd and prattl'd, Banter'd, told merry Tales, and rattl'd, Talk'd of false Mistresses and true ones, Knaves, Slaves, old Parliaments and new ones, Of Country, City, Army, Court, Or any trump'ry Stuff, in short, That might promote a little Sport. At length, as sant'ring to and fro, Tattling of Things we did not know, A merry Race was undertaken, By two arch Wags, as fat as Bacon, One was my Cherub, and the other, In length and breadth his very Brother: No Gog and Magog, I may say, Were ever better match'd than they, Their Heads, their Bellies, and their Arses, As like as any two Coach Horses: No Eastern Monarch, proudly drawn By Elephants, from Town to Town, Could ever boast two liker Creatures, In Bulk, Flesh, Squabbiness and Features. The carpet Ground the Heroes chose, As most commodious for their Toes, Was finely rowl'd, and cover'd o'er With Grass, a hundred Yards and more, No Molehil to retard their speed, Or Clod, that could their haste impede, Nor Stone upon the Surface seen, But level as a Bowling-Green; This was the Walk they were to strain Their Limbs upon, and back again; That is, in case the Heroes found They'd Breath enough to run the Ground. A Flask the Loser was to pay To him that fairly won the day, And the best Man that first came in To th'place of starting, was to win. When all the Articles we'd need on, Were thus well settl'd and agreed on, The Racers then began to strip Into their Shirts, from Neck to Hip, Like two Prize-fighting Hockly Swordmen, The Joy of Butchers and Tomturdmen, Then shaking Hands for half a Minute, To show no Breast had Anger in it, Each took, with a couragious Heart, The Ground from whence they were to start, Smiling, or rather, proudly grinning, As if both Sides were sure of winning. When fix'd alike, the Word was given, And so they started very even, We scow'ring after, helter skelter, To see 'em labour, tug and swelter, Some crying out, Run, Dumplin, run, Now make a loose or you're undone, Pull up your Heels, have a good Heart: Nouns, flank him, or you've nothing for't. Others, that back'd my merry Chum, Ran just behind his waddling Bum, And to improve the sweating Farce, Cry'd out, Well straddl'd, Pudding-Arse, Take care, don't overstrain your Barrel Of Guts, and you may win the Laurel, Dumplin can never hold the Race, He flags already, slack your pace, Hold up your Belly, save your Wind, He's twenty Yards at least behind. Thus e'ery Man made some Excursion, T'improve and heighten our Diversion, Till Dumplin's Breath began to fail, Which turn'd his Redness to a Pale, And made him look as if his Breeches Were smoking hot with Gard'ners Riches, Which put him into such disorder, That he, alas, could run no furder, But crawl'd, in sight of the Beholders, Some Steps aside, and lean'd his Shoulders Against a Fruit-Tree, call'd a Codling, There puff'd &amp; blow'd, half dead with wadling So the huge warlike Persian Beast, With his own weight and bulk opprest, Does to some sturdy Plant repair, And rests his Limbs by leaning there. My Cherub having won the Day, And fairly born the Bell away, Upon a Rowling-stone sat down, Warm'd for his Buttocks by the Sun, There drip'd a while at e'ery Pore, And rub'd his Noddle o'er and o'er, Foaming at Mouth, like one half drown'd, Just snatch'd from some destructive Pond, Panting like broken-winded Horse, Or Greyhound that had run a Course, Retching and puking as he sat, Like teeming Bride new got with Brat, As yet unable to express The Joy he found in his Success. So Combatants that take the Field, And fight till one is forc'd to yield, When almost knock'd and thump'd to death, Sit down, like Fools, to gather Breath. No whirling Race, in former Years, Perform'd by Roman Charioteers, When clouds of Atoms, as they run, Arose, and choak'd the Lookers on, Could e'er deserve a Poet's Skill, Like Dumplin and my Cherub Will; Such Strength appear'd in e'ery Stride, As they contended Side by Side, That at each pond'rous Step they stept, Alas, the dying Herbage wept; The yielding Earth, where either set Their Tentoes, shrunk beneath the weight, And the poor Bugs and Worms that lay Before conceal'd in Dirt and Clay, Came crawling out upon the Surf, To see what Monsters press'd the Turf, Fearing the heavy Shocks they felt, Should close their Cells wherein they dwelt, And ram the Earth so very tight, That they no more should crawl to Light. So cunning Rats, as some agree, Forsake the falling Granary, For fear their Dwelling should inclose Their Tribe, the next high Wind that blows. By this time my Victorious Chum, From Rowling-Stone had rais'd his Bum, And gather'd Strength enough to walk, Tho' scarce quite Breath enough to talk. Poor Dumplin also had forsaken The Codling-Tree, that sav'd his Bacon, And having eas'd his Lungs, began To walk a high-lone, like a Man. My Cherub, who with painful Strides Had beaten t'others brawny Sides, Inspir'd with Vict'ry, now grew merry, And thus reproach'd his Adversary: You run with me, you boldface Noodle, Your Tub of Guts can only woddle, I'll give you all the Ods you'll ask, And try once more for t'other Flask, Jump, Wrestle, Hop, or pitch the Bar, Dance, or do any thing you dare, Name your own Exercise, that's fair. Poor Dumplin vex'd at the Disgrace Of losing this unhappy Race, Silenc'd with Bashfulness, gave way To all the Victor pleas'd to say, Rubbing his sweaty Ears the while, Concluding with a shamefac'd Smile. Just so two Carmen, when they Box Till one's subdu'd, by Thumps and Knocks, The Victor then sits down and crows, Whilst t'other wipes his bloody Nose. This ending, we were summon'd all To a nice Breakfast in the Hall, Where modish liquid Dainties grac'd The Table, to delight our Taste. My Cherub Will, who'd but a light Thin snoring Supper over Night, And having by the Race he'ad run, Improv'd his Stomach two to one, So like a brawny Dutchman fed, On Bread and Butter ready spread, As if he thought his craving Guts Wanted more greasing than his Boots, Swilling down Tea and Coffee a'ter, As thirsty Cattle do cold Water: A rare Companion for the Dame Or Lady that affects the same. For that fair She that wants an able Gallant to grace her fine Tea-Table, May, if she pleases, soon discover My Chum is a fit Man all over. When e'ery one had broke his Fast, And frankly shar'd in the Repast, My strong-back'd Cherub soon forgetting His plenteous Drinking and his Eating, Proud of the Conquest he had won, O'er Guts as weighty as his own, Prompt by Success and Vanity, Presum'd at last to challenge me, To run the length of that same Green, Whereon he'ad so Victorious been: This second Match was soon agreed, And out we went to try our speed, Doft nothing but our Coats and Wigs, And soon began to stretch our Legs, But half the Course we scarce had run, Before I'd evidently won, For my poor Cherub slack'd his pace About the middle of the Race, Finding it would be wilful Murther, To strain his Guts by running further, So stop'd his Speed, and in distress, Did the same Codling-Tree embrace, Which sav'd poor Dumplin just before, When his faint Limbs could run no more. So Heroes that insult their Foes, Tho' prosp'rous now, may in the close, Lose the next Battle with disgrace, And fall into the like Distress. Having thus won, I step'd to see My Cherub at the Codling-Tree, Whose trembling Limbs and palled Looks Were Symptoms he was off the Hooks. Chear up, said I, recall your Strength, What! dead with running such a Length? Thy fat full Belly and full speed, I fear, have greatly disagreed, I thought you gorg'd too much Provision For such a Morning's Expedition. No skilful Jocky feeds his Horse The Day that he's to run his Course. With that poor Will began to speak, And faintly cry'd, O sick! O sick! Then retching, strove to puke and sputter, Till up came Tea and Bread and Butter, Which from his heaving Stomach flow'd, In such a Stream and such a Load, Enough to've giv'n, as I'm a Sinner, Two Mastiffs a voluptuous Dinner. No sooner had he thus discharg'd The plenteous Breakfast he had gorg'd, But he began to mend apace, And shew some Colour in his Face, Yet could not well forbear to rue The loss of Fame and Breakfast too, Because he always had, in troth, A very great regard for both. Yet willing to be Idem semper, And of a chearful Princely Temper, He reassum'd his sprightly Ayre, And grew as jocund as a Play'r, Wisely consid'ring the uncertain Vicissitudes and turns of Fortune, And in a few short Minutes more, Became a true Philosopher; So, ram'd and damn'd the poreblind Jilt, And laugh'd at what he'd lost and spilt. Thus, like Democritus, despis'd The Honour I so highly priz'd, And show'd he scoffingly could bear What others lose with Grief and Care. Racing still running in our Heads, We now resolv'd to beat the Meads, And with a brace of Greyhounds try To course a Hare that lay hard by; Accordingly, like merry Rogues, We laugh'd, and hoop'd, and call'd the Dogs, Then rang'd the Meadows, beat the Bushes, And peep'd in e'ery tuft of Rushes, Until at length we chanc'd to strole From Pasture into Arable, And there upon a Stubble Ground, A Lev'ret in her Form we found; So ho! the nearest Sportsman cry'd, With both the Greyhounds by his side, To us, Pray Gentlemen withdraw, Call off the Dogs and give her Law. Which sporting Language, three, or more, Fat Cockneys ne'er had heard before, Nor e'er had seen so strange a Creature, Except 'twas dress'd and in a Platter: However, we the Word obey'd, Sneak'd back and at a distance stay'd, Not knowing but a living Hare Might be as dang'rous as a Bear; Therefore we thought a proper distance Might prove much safer than Resistance, And having heard that Hares, when running, Have scar'd Lord May'rs, for all their Cunning, We did not know what Risques or Dangers, In Coursing, might attend us Strangers, We therefore thought it best to stay, In safety, out of all Harms way, Whilst the young Country Hick that found her, With a long Pole, walk'd round and round her; Without which Weapon, we suppose, He'd scarce have ventur'd quite so close. At length he put her up, and then Cry'd, Loo're, with all his Might and Main. Away run Puss before the Wind, As if the Dev'l had been behind; And after her the Dogs, as fast As Witches when they fly in hast, Or ride on Broomstaves to carouse In some old Miser's haunted House. We fat Folks following in the Rear, O'er Gates and Styles, the Lord knows where, Quite out of sight of all the Sport, Altho' we tug'd and sweated for't, Till my poor honest Comrade, Will, Stumbl'd in climbing up a Hill, And like a Hogshead turn'd so roundly, We could not stop him as the ground-lay, But down he rowl'd, now Guts and Face, Then Back and Buttocks next the Grass, Till an old Hedge, where rotten Sticks Did with live Thorns and Brambles mix, Most kindly catch'd him by the Breech, And sav'd him from a watry Ditch; So that no Damage did accrue, But here and there a Scratch or two, Which only serv'd as Scars to grace And beautify our Hero's Face. I think, said I, thou'rt Sancho's Brother, Ne'er out of one ill Scrape or other: What made you rowl your heavy Arse Down Hill, so much beside the Course. Says Chuff, What makes you ask poor Billy, A Question, so profoundly silly, D'ye think I did not rowl down Hill, And Hedgehog turn, against my Will; I took not all that pains on purpose To scratch my Face and bruise my Corpus. Said I, Thy Looks too plainly show Thou couldst not help it, that I know, But we have lost our Sport, in short, And truly we may blame you for't. Blame me, says Will, that's very hard, I've made more Pastime than I've mar'd. Pox take the Dogs and Hare and all, To them I owe this ugly Fall; I'd rather see a Farmer's Hogs Well hunted by his mungril Dogs, There's Musick, Sirs, in such a Chase, The Pigs squeak Treble, Sow grunts Base, That were a Set of Bagpipes near, They could not more delight the Ear; But this is such dull silent Sport, I'd not skip o'er a Threshold for't; This Coursing ne'er could be design'd For fat Folks, such as us, to mind; But for lean, hungry Skin and Bones, Just one degree from Skeletons, Light-timber'd, meagre, fleshless Fellows, Whose Lungs are like a Blacksmith's Bellows, Young Rogues, that at one nimble Stretch Can top a Gate or leap a Ditch, And play two Hours at Prisonbase, Before they show a sweaty Face. 'Tis true, we Squabs were ne'er cut out, Said I, for coursing Hares on foot, But rather like the King of Tunquin, To ride on Elephants a Hunting, Such strong-back'd Creatures that can wallow Thro' Mire, beneath a Tun of Tallow. I wish I had one here, says Will, To bear me up this plaguy Hill, For this high climbing, I must tell ye, Does ill agree with my great Belly. The Coursers having kill'd their Game, Were now returning home with Fame, A Sportsman at his Shoulders bearing Poor Puss, as dead as any Herring, Having in's Hat most proudly put The Huntsman's Trophy, call'd the Scut; And thus in Pomp they march'd the Fields, With Greyhounds panting at their Heels, Whilst we three fat Folks walk'd our best, And puff'd and blow'd to meet the rest. No sooner had our Bacon Flitches, By hobbling over Stiles and Ditches, Join'd our lean Friends, who were no less Than greatly pleas'd with their Success, But we had all the distant Sport Rehears'd in proper Terms of Art, And e'ery shift and turn poor Puss Had made, for Life, reported to us. Then we, to give a small addition To their diverting Repetition, Laid open the Fatigue poor Will Had met with at the neighb'ring Hill, And in conclusion of the Matter, How Wood had sav'd him from the Water: Not that my Muse is so severe To use the Seaman's Proverb here, Because my Chum, I must say that, Is full as honest as he's fat. We thus, by Steps and Conversation, Return'd to our Friend's Habitation, Who keeping in his House a Fawn, Bred tamely up and stoutly grown, Would entertain us now with Sport, Well worthy of a Prince's Court, Accordingly the trembling Deer, Whose weeping Eyes declar'd her Fear, Was led into the neighb'ring Grounds, And there let loose before the Hounds, But with such Law as might secure Her Haunches from the Greyhound's Pow'r. A noble Course indeed she held, And bounding run from Field to Field; Close at her Haunch, within a Yard, A brace of Long-Dogs lab'ring hard, But nimble Heels and lasting Wind, Still sav'd her from her Foes behind, Till finding by her yielding Feet 'Twas time to make a safe Retreat; Then swift as any Swallow throu' The Garden she like Light'ning flew, There bolted int' a little House, Design'd for Ladies private use, The Door of which flap'd closely to, And there the Greyhounds lost their view. So the poor caterwouling Cat, That stroles abroad to seek a Mate, If chas'd by Dogs, is glad to fly Into some Jakes or Sink-hole nigh, And there sit down, like one forlorn, To save her Fur from being torn. Now weary of these sundry sorts Of chast Diana's Rural Sports, And hearing of a Pedagogue, For Greek and Latin once in vogue, Who'ad turn'd his School but lately into A House where Punch was sold and Wine too, We all agreed to go and take A Sneaker there for Learning's sake, It being but an easy Mile, A pleasant Walk, without a Stile, To th'House, where we desir'd to spend Our Losings with our Learned Friend, Who now had stoop'd to sell good Claret, A Station far below his Merit. My Cherub, tho' his Guts were grumbling, With Racing, Rowling and with Tumbling, Yet, never flinching from the Bowl, Stept on with all his Heart and Soul, Till ready with the Heat to faint, But scorn'd to make the least Complaint. As thus in very sultry Weather, We travel'd, fat and lean together, Some dripping hot, from top to bottom, And others cooly laughing at 'em, We chanc'd upon the Road to meet A little Man in a great heat, Lugging a mighty Sword along, That cross his Buttocks dangling hung, Between his Shoulder-Blades a Hump, Projecting far beyond his Rump, And these agreeably supported, By two splay Feet and Legs distorted, But dress'd as nice as if he'ad been A Dwarf to some Inchanted Queen. My Cherub, who had Wit at Will, For all he tumbl'd down the Hill, Could not forbear to have a Throw At this strange Pigmy of a Beau; Accordingly he fix'd his Eye Upon him, as he strutted by, Then nodding tow'rds him with his Head, My Cherub Will thus scoffing said, Oft have I read the merry Tales Of Æsop, once at Tunbridge-Wells, But sure as we are here together, We now have met him walking thither. Our laughing at my Cherub's Jest, Gave Æsop's likeness some distast, That he reply'd, as he pass'd by us, You're like the Army of Darius, Among whose Persian Troops were seen More clumsy Beasts than warlike Men. Come, come, said I, one Joke's enough, Let us move on, and him march off, And not, like Indian Cranes, thus cavil With Mountain Pigmies as we travel, Whose bloody Wars are so severe, That Thousands perish ev'ry Year, Tho' neither, as the Story runs, Do ever fight with Swords or Guns, But one Side with their Beaks make Pushes, The other with their Spears of Rushes, And they that in the Battle gain The Conquest, feed upon the slain. So Bears and Indians often meet, And what the strongest kill they eat. By slow Gradations we had now Arriv'd at place of Rendevou', Where Domine, like Man of Fashion, Gave us a friendly Salutation, And show'd us into that same Room Where callow Pupils us'd to come, And at their Master's Instigation, Suck in the Milk of Education: Here Forms, where Emulation sprung, And seedling Scholars us'd to throng, Neglected stood, which heretofore Young Poets and Grammarians bore, And where aspiring studious Wits, Contended for superior Seats: Here Shelves where Authors us'd to stand In order, for each Student's Hand, Were now disgrac'd, and doom'd to bear Punch Bowls and other China Ware, With Lemons, Squeezers, Strainers, Ladles, And twenty more such Fiddle-faddles: In one dark Nook lay Aristotle, And by him a huge Brandy Bottle: Descartes next had place, by whom Stood that damn'd Devil's Piss, call'd Rum: In Company of these old staunch Philosophers lay Malebranch, Searching for Truth; and at his Back French Claret, and a Keg of 'Rack: Among the rest was lightly hurl'd, Sir Walter's History of the World; And by its side, 'gainst time of Need, A Box of good Virginia Weed, Such as himself, without a Joke, In his own Study us'd to smoke. Thus ancient Authors of Renown, On Shelves, lay scatter'd up and down, With drunken Trophies interspers'd, And Biskets bak'd to be immers'd In noble Nectar, that the Bowl, At once, when crown'd with Toast, and full Might feast the Body'nd chear the Soul. Thus wanton Bacchus now prophan'd The House where once Apollo reign'd, And Men grow Fools in drunken Fits, Where Boys of late improv'd their Wits. So have I known an ancient Seat Abandon'd by the Rich and Great, And Swine possess the ruin'd Place, Once fit to entertain his Grace. Having thus taken a Survey Of all that offer'd in our way, We call'd for a capacious Bowl, To spirit up each thirsty Soul, Which now, to e'ery Mortal's thinking, Began to droop for want of drinking; Accordingly a plenteous Dose Of Punch was quickly handed to us, A Liquor so divinely good, When by the Learned rightly brew'd, That even Gods affect the same, Call'd only by another Name. As Madam, when she warms her Pallat With comfortable Nantz, will call it Cold Tea, because she'd not be thought, By sober Dames, a Brandy Sot. So Nectar, which the Poets say Their Heathen Gods drink e'ery Day, Could we the same rich Liquor tast, Might prove, perhaps, but Punch at last: For Mortals oft by Names are cheated, And by bifarious Terms outwitted; Therefore let merry Sots proclaim Nectar and Punch to be the same: Only when tippl'd by the Gods And Goddesses in their Abodes, In rev'rence to their lofty Station, It bears a diff'rent Appellation; As Red and Green, with Men of Art, In common Coats, are Gules and Vert; But when the Bearings of a King Shall fall beneath our blazoning, If we're in Heraldry ingenious, Those Colours must be Mars and Venus. Besides, sometimes the World may see High-Treason blazon'd Loyalty: And then again, for some new reason, Loyalty shall be call'd High-Treason: Therefore Words signify no more Than what our Betters take 'em for. Which shows, that mighty Men, as proud As Heathen Gods, must be allow'd To cheat, with Names, the common Crowd. By this time the celestial Cup Had wound the Springs of Nature up, That like pert Gossips at a Christ'ning, We had much Talking, but no List'ning. My Chum, who'd all the Morn been tost About, from Pillar unto Post, And having taken special care, In turn, to drink at least his Share, He now began, like one that's Lousy, To shrug, and seem a little Drowsy, Stealing a Nod to ease his Limbs, Whilst others broach'd their merry Whims; But still, by instinct or by chance, Suddenly 'wak'd, as from a Trance, When e'er the Ladle pointed to him, That Justice we are bound to do him; For Will's true Steel, grant that a Maxim, The Cup the Magnet that attracts him, Place but that Loadstone at his Door, Up starts the Steel that slept before. Some pleas'd the rest with merry Catches, Others compar'd their Rings and Watches; Some wildly talk'd of Prussian Troops, Some of Great Ladies monstrous Hoops, Some punn'd upon what others said, And others strange Cunnundrums made; My Landlord, who was born in Wales, And of great Learning, Splutterannails, Told us, as plain as he could speak, Th'analogy 'twixt Welsh and Greek, And croak'd the Gutterels as roundly, As if he knew 'em both profoundly; Latin he talk'd with much more ease Than Lawyers wrangle for their Fees, And, tho' a Welshman, made no stammer At any Part or Rule of Grammar, But had it at his Fingers ends, To pleasure and instruct his Friends; Just as Musicians have their Tunes, Or Playhouse Wits their merry Puns, To court and gratify the Sence Of others that command the Pence; For e'ery Artist must, in course, Submit to those that bear the Purse. 'Tis hard, thought I, that Men of Sence, Good Learning, Wit and Eloquence, Should fall beneath the Frowns of Fate, And worthless Blockheads ride in State, As if designing Knaves and Fools, Court Minions, Pimps, and Statesmens Tools, Were only destin'd to the Smiles Of Fortune, in these wicked Isles, Where Men by Infamy aspire, From humble Stations into higher, And Women, at the vile expence Of Vertue, crow o'er Innocence, Whilst, Justice, Honesty, and Truth, Those Ornaments of Age and Youth, Are laugh'd at by the Great and Proud, And render'd odious to the Croud. When moral Vertues lose their force, Religion must decline in course; And as that fades—the want of Grace Draws publick Ruin on apace; For when Preferments are bestow'd Upon the Bad, instead of Good, And heath'nish Arguments shall raise A Man to sacred Dignities, What must the Christian Church expect, From such abuse and such neglect, But fatal Heresies and Schisms, In spight of Creeds and Catechisms. If Guides shall openly despise Religion's sacred Mysteries, And teach the Croud to disagree, Or cavil with the Trinity, That great united Three in One, In whom Christianity begun, That Pow'r eternal, which alone, By Faith, is to be seen or known. I say, if those that wear the Cloth Deny this fundamental Truth, And with their Tongues and Pens prophane Those Myst'ries that they should maintain. Well may the common People stray, If their Learn'd Guides mistake the Way, And Christians stagger in their Faith, When Bishops shall dispute the Path. But hold! on what am I thus pond'ring? Or, whither is my Fancy wand'ring? Excuse this Punch-Bowl Rumination, That led me into this Disgression; Remember, when good Liquor gains Th'ascendency in teeming Brains, We're then most apt to take in hand Those things that least we understand. Ale makes the Farrier a Physician, The Cobler a wise Politician, The Parish Clerk a good Divine, The Dunce a Man of great Design, The prating pettifogging Drudge, In Law, as knowing as a Judge. If muddy Ale, when swill'd by Fools, Has these effects on common Souls, Sure noble Punch, that liquid Fire, May raise a Poet's Frenzy high'r, And cause his Muse, in such a case, To soar and fly a Wild Goose chase: Therefore, if any Faults you see, Blame the good Liquor, and not me, Because Religion's most debated, By Mortals, when most elevated; Which shows, when fuddl'd, we affect To talk of what we most neglect. The Bromley Coach, which we before Bespoke, now coming to the Door, We Cocknies, who were four in number, For Coach or Cart sufficient Lumber, Call'd for the Reck'ning, paid our Shots, And stagg'ring took our leave like Sots. But when the jocund Coachman saw The Weight his Horses were to draw, Greatly surpris'd at our approach, He nimbly started from his Coach, And hiding with his Hat the Eyes Of his near Horse, he nodding cries, Pray Masters, whilst I blind my Horses, Walk in and seat your heavy Arses, For should they see four Men so large, They would not draw one step, by George. Pleas'd with the Jest, then in we crouded, No Waggon could be heavier loaded, Our Bodies closer wedg'd, by far, Than Hogsheads in a Thames-street Car. And thus we travel'd, wreaking warm, Confin'd from stirring Leg or Arm, But sat like Sacks of Meal stow'd up I'th' corner of a Baker's Shop, Squeezing our squabby Sides together, And Elbows almost thro' the Leather, Expecting, e'ery shock, our Bones Receiv'd from rugged Ruts and Stones, The whole Machine would be confounded, And our poor selves dislodg'd and wounded. However, all these Fears and Cares, Of Mischiefs happ'ning unawares, Would not restrain us, on our Way, From Sleep, to either Watch or Pray, But tir'd with Sporting and with Drinking, Our Eyes were now inclin'd to winking; Accordingly we clos'd our Peepers, And slept like four o'th' seven Sleepers, Not near so long, but full as sound, For half an Hour we napp'd it round, Whilst to each drowsy dreaming Noddle The rocking Coach became a Cradle, The Wheels supply'd the Nurse's Song, And lull'd us as they rowl'd along. The Coachman drowthy with the Dust, Now stop'd a while, to quench his Thirst, At a small Cottage on the Road, Where wholsome nappy Ale was brew'd, Such Liquor as deserves the Praise Of Bumpkins upon Holy-days, And oft intoxicates the Brains Of rural Nymphs and merry Swains. No sooner had the thirsty Driver Call'd for some Ale to cool his Liver, But my poor Cherub, hot and dry With Punching, like the rest and I, Awak'd at the approach of Drink, And could no longer sleep a wink, But rub'd his Eyes, and cry'd, Good People, For G?d's sake bring a Jug of Tipple. So drowsy Swine, that snoring ly, Pent close in their unsav'ry Sty, Start from their Slumbers when they hear Their Feeder with his Hogwash near, And by their loud impatient grunts, Express their Gladness and their Wants. Now each Man shaking from his Soul, The Influence of our Bromley Bowl, Resolv'd to guard himself, and keep His Senses from the Pow'r of Sleep, Till Time, that universal Friend, Had brought us to our Journey's end; But finding that the Punch, together With the hot Sunshine dusty Weather, Had clam'd our Mouths &amp; parch'd our Throats As dry as old unliquor'd Boots, W'agreed at once to rince our Pallats, And lubricate our drowthy Gullets, With home-brew'd Ale, which Ages since Was Liquor for an English Prince, When Virtue was indulg'd at Court, And reign'd among the Nobler Sort, And when the Kingdom's happy fare Was truly e'ery Statesman's Care, But since adult'rate foreign Juices Take place of what our Isle produces, We turn all Justice out of door, Treat Publick Credit like a Whore, And grow more Wicked and more Poor. When thus, with good fresh English Ale, We'd cool'd ourselves from Head to Tail, And to our Comfort, Malt be prais'd, Had quench'd that drouth the Punch had rais'd, Ge-up, away the Coachman flog'd His Prancers, and along we jog'd, Like Kentish Yeomen fat at Heart, With Pickl'd Pork and Damson Tart. As thus we mov'd tow'rds London Town, That second Sodom of Renown, A Hackney Chaise came whirling by, As fast as one poor Horse could fly, And in the same were seated two, An Exchange Seamster and a Jew, Both known, upon their swift approach, To me, and others in the Coach: The Infidel, of Heber's Race, Had the old Leaven in his Face, And look'd as if he'ad suck'd at Nurse, Two Saffron-Bags, or something worse; Or that his Parents, as they bred him, With Turm'ric Pudding only fed him. Of his lascivious Eyes the Sights Were black as Charcoal, but the Whites As yellow as a Christmas Candle, Or an old Case-knife's Iv'ry Handle, That in his Looks a Man might see His ancient Jewish Pedigree, Deriv'd of R?s that rob'd the poor Ægyptians in the days of yore, Debauch'd each handsome Wife and Daughter And stript 'em of their Jewels a'ter; Then with the Booty they had made, To other distant Nations fled, There sold their glitt'ring Ware, to grace This Lady's Fingers, t'other's Face. And thus did into Kingdoms bring That coz'ning Trade of Jewelling, Till Kings, enamour'd with the sight Of beauteous Dames, that shone so bright, Exchang'd their own for Ægypt's Stones, And hung the Gngaws on their Crowns; For precious Stones that Women wore As Ornaments in Times of Yore, Were first affected by the Fair, As means to gain a living Pair. The Damsel full of Life and Ayre, That sat with Moses in his Chair, Was not a Prostitute that's common, But a good-natur'd pritty Woman, That keeps a Shop, as People say, For Countenance, but sins for Pay; A purchasable Lass, that gains More by her Pleasantry than Pains: Just such a kind Seam-sowing Lady As Chaucer has describ'd already, Who made Shop-keeping her pretence, But by her Favours gain'd the Pence. As cunning Dames, we often find, Hang out a Cradle for a blind, When Bawding chiefly is the Trade By which they earn their daily Bread. 'Tis hard, said I, a Lass so pritty, That dwells in such a Christian City, For want of Grace, or due Provision, Should yield her Charms to Circumcision, And all her beauteous Limbs unveil, To a vile swarthy Infidel. Poh! says my Cherub, that's no News, For Christian Whores to mix with Jews, Or Turks, that are but well supply'd With Gold, to pay for't when they ride. Didst ever know a Dame that comes To Market with her Pears and Plums, Ask the Religion of her Buyers, That bid the Price which she requires? No, any Villain that can spare But Pence, may buy her lusheous Ware. 'Tis well remark'd, said I, indeed, Money makes all Intrigues succeed, And tempts the Fair to greater Wrongs Than Lust itself, or flatt'ring Tongues. 'Tis Money makes the old Wife trot, And young ones do we know not what; Allures the Great, tho' nobly born, To act those very things they scorn, Bribes the bold Enemies of State, To creep and cringe to those they hate; Corrupts the Judge, deludes the Guide, And draws even Loyalty aside, Makes Statesmen wicked, Kingdoms mad. In short, does e'ery thing that's bad; Because, if we the Truth may tell, 'Tis oftner ill-apply'd than well: But Mortals, that contend about it, Will urge, that none can live without it, And therefore it becomes each Man, To gain as much on't as he can. Money we own's a useful Evil, But in ill hands may prove the Devil: As doubtless noble Wine is good To chear the Heart and cleanse the Blood; But still we find that the abuse Of what's design'd for common use, Makes Thousands damn the noble Juice. So those that do their Coffers line, May buy destruction with their Coin, And live to curse the means by which They thrive and make themselves so rich. By this time our uneasy Bones Began to feel old Southwark Stones, Which by unwelcome Jolts and Jumbles, Gave our full Guts such ugly grumbles, That being forc'd for ease to light, We paid, and bid our Coach good Night: The Driver glad to find his Horses Well rid of four such heavy Arses, And we as highly pleas'd to see Our crippl'd Limbs at liberty, Walk'd off like four great brawny Dutchmen, With no less Comfort than the Coachman. So fares it in a coupl'd Life, When Wife plagues Husband, Husband Wife, Each tugs with a repenting Heart, Till one side does elope or start, Then both are joyful when they part. As all Men, by instinct of Nature, Make something else besides warm Water, To ease their Intrails when replete With nauseous dregs of what they eat; So now the struggling Ordure pent In our Hogs-Puddings wanting vent, We all were forc'd, in this Distress, To seek the next convenient place, Which prov'd to be a House of Note, Renown'd for humming Beer and Stout, Yet humbly stands in Half-Horse Alley, Where rare Malt Liquors never fail ye: In doors we rush'd with eager Hands, Imploy'd to loose our Breeches Bands, And asking for the Seat we wanted, The stinking Hovel soon was granted, Which prov'd too little to admit Of more than one at once to sit; This caus'd us all to disagree, And struggle for precedency, Till one fat Friend, among the rest, Like a Hen frighted from her Nest, Being in great distress to lay, Was forc'd to drop an Egg by th'way. Thus like Competitors that wait At Court for Places in the State, We all contended till our Ends Were serv'd, and then we all grew Friends. But this Conveniency, for which Each struggl'd to relieve his Breech, Was scarce so big upon the square, As an old Grannams Wicker Chair, That as we sat by turns, each Man Look'd like a Squab in a Sedan, Or pamper'd Lord, whose Bulk is fitter To load a Waggon or Horse-litter. My Cherub, who was least in hast, And chanc'd to take his Turn the last, Had wedg'd his brawny Sides so close Into this Dung-box of an House, That when he strove to raise his great Fat Buttocks from the narrow Seat, The House stuck to him as the Shell Does to a crawling Garden Snail, That he had much ado to shake The boarded Privy from his Back, But bustl'd, during this mishap, Like Rat just taken in a Trap, Before he could his Shoulders free, Or set his Bum at liberty. We laugh'd to see the odd Event Of this new merry Accident, Which did my Cherub's Wrath provoke, And made him damn his wooden Cloak, That caus'd him thus above the rest, To be his old Companion's Jest, But had no sooner button'd fast His Buckskin Breeches round his Waste, E're he began to be as clever And cherubimical as ever, At once quite banishing away, The past Mischances of the Day; So that we now, like mutual Friends, Walk'd in to make the House amends, For granting us their Privy Place, To ease our Bowels in distress; Accordingly we chose a Table Among a Kitchen full of Rabble, And call'd aloud like other People, For Pipes, Tobacco, and some Tipple, O'er which we talk'd, and while we staid, The foll'wing Observations made. Our Host, who seemingly was near His greatest Climacteric Year, Was yet as brisk among his Guests, As an old Hunter in a Chase, Or a blind Fidler when he Jokes And scrapes among the Country Fo'kes, Ask him concerning this or that, He always answers very pat, No matter whether right or wrong, He'll show ye that he wants no Tongue, But by the dint of florid Jargon, Can drown a Bagpipe or an Organ. Should any Man presume to run Upon him with a Jest or Pun, He soon would let the Coxcomb see No bant'ring Knave at Repartee, Could show more ready Wit than he. He's seldom Sick, tho' often ailing, And for each Virtue has some failing, Both which, so artfully are blended, He seems best pleas'd, when most offended, That is, when teas'd with other Scoffs, The more he's vex'd, the more he laughs, As if he scorn'd the Lash of Satyr, And drown'd Resentment in good Nature, He's rich and happy in his Station, Vies Beer with all the Brewing Nation, And never draws a Pint to wet A Cobler's Whistle, but in Plate, Which Top, and Bottom, pays my Host Good Interest, for the Sum it cost. So Harlots find the most Success And Profit in the finest Dress. The cunning Doctor, that for ease, Can keep his Coach, has double Fees, And the proud Vict'ler that can draw In Silver, will, in spight of Law, Make twice the Advantage of his Sots, O'er him that sells in Pewter Pots. For as the Taylor, that designs To thrive and heap up Riches, finds Most Profit from his Trade accrues, By charging what he does not use. So the wise Vict'ler that intends T'improve his Fortune by his Friends, Must make 'em pay alike, for what He draws, and what he draws 'em not. No Man can boast a better Wife, To sooth the galling Cares of Life, No proud Dame, but a saving Matron, Not over nice, nor yet a Slattern, But One, whose fading Years express The Ruins of a handsome Face, Sufficient to remind my Host Of former Charms she now has lost, And make him still attempt to shew His Will to what he cannot do, 'Tis true, my Landlord bears the Sway, But she the Burden of the Day, He sits at ease enjoys his Friends, Smokes much, drinks more, but nothing spends, Whilst She, good Dame, t'enrich her Spouse, Submits to all things in the House, And drudges like an Indian Slave, To please and ease the idle Knave. A Custom never known before The lazy Palatines came o'er; By whose Example, Men were taught To santer, loll, and strole about, Whilst the good Wife and buxom Daughter Were Slaves to fetch in Wood and Water. My Landlord to secure his Wealth, From Midnight Rogues that live by Stealth, Had quarter'd in his House a tall Young Irish Soldier, by my Shoul, Who for strong Drink, and Bread and Cheese, Serv'd him in two Capacities, And, to give honest Teague his due, Was Body-guard and Tapster too, Did faithful Service Night and Day, Made wrangling Sots their Reck'ning pay, And at too late unlawful Hours, Turn'd noisy Drunkards out of Doors. Pray Teague, said I, Inform us right, What Hour it is, what Time of Night. Says Teague, before I do come back I'll tell you when I've ask'd the Clock. With that he step'd aside, and staid A while, and then returning, said, Fait Master, I do understand The Bell much better than the Hand, But by and by 'twill ring, and then By my Shalvashion 'twill be Ten. This Answer caus'd us all to smile, And made us merry for a while, Which Teague observing, shook his Skull, And cry'd, You take me for a Fool, But by St. Patrick, look me thorow, You'll find I was not born to Morrow. The tipling Mansion seem'd to be A House of great Antiquity, Or rather humble Cottage meant, For Dwarfs and Pigmies to frequent, Tall Men may fancy when they're here, That they're aboard some Privateer, And if they stand, must bend their Necks, As Seamen do between the Decks. Therefore, t'escape a knock oth' Pate, The safest Way's to chuse a Seat; But then, if they too long sit down, The Drink will catch them by the Crown; And thus, if they Caribdis shun, They may perhaps on Scylla run. The Kitchen, where we sat in common, With smoking Coblers and with Broom-men, At Night was like a Gravesend Barge, Cram'd very full, tho' not so large, Each prating o'er his Evening's Draught, Some reeling drunk, some piping hot; Yet great Complaints by all were made, O'th' want of Mony and of Trade, Except my Host, wh'ad no regard To th'Suff'rings of the grumbling Herd, Because, he found to his Content, The less they work'd, the more they spent. For lab'ring Mortals, when they fare Most hard, drink most to drown their Care, And, Tinker like, will warm the Head With Beer, altho' they beg their Bread. But that which did above the rest Amuse us most, and please us best, Was an old Dunghil in the Room, Exempt from Shovel and from Broom, That long had lain before the Fire, High as an Ant-hill, if not high'r, On which our Landlord us'd to crow, When fuddl'd, o'er his Guests below, And mount his Corps, when he thought fit To exercise his bant'ring Wit; Nay, sometimes preach'd to Sots and Fools, His own domestick Laws and Rules, And told 'em what a sinful Way It was, to score and never pay. Thus much we'ad heard, before we came To see my Landlord and his Dame, But now desir'd a clear Account Of this uncommon little Mount. Pray, Landlord, says my Cherub Will, What means that useless dirty Hill? Is it design'd by lying there, To skreen your Roast-meat from the Air? Ah! Sir, says he, I'd have you think I ne'er was bred to Pen and Ink, I know but little, I confess, Of Letters, and of Figures less; Therefore, by that informing Mount Of Dirt, I keep my whole Account, I know by that what Trade I drive, When I go back, and when I thrive, That tells me e'ery Brewer's Day, When to put off, and when to pay, Whether my Beer be good or no, When it's fresh tap'd, and when it's low; And does a Thousand Wonders more Than ever Dunghil did before. But, how do you make this appear, Said I, pray, Landlord, let us hear. ‘Lord, Sir, reply'd my Host, ne'er doubt, ‘But I can plainly make it out. ‘Don't ridicule my Words, but pray ‘Give ear to what I further say. ‘'Twas well observ'd by our Forefathers, Who gains most Dirt, most Riches gathers, ‘The Truth of which old Proverb, I ‘Shall now attempt to verify; ‘When first I humbly laid aside ‘My flogging Scepter Once a Coachman. for a Bride, ‘And took this good old Mansion here, ‘To live by selling Ale and Beer, ‘We then imploy'd our Mops and Brooms ‘To wash our Harths, and sweep our Rooms, ‘And made our Pewter shine as bright, ‘As any Glow-worm's Tail by Night; ‘But this we did, to tell you true, ‘Because we'd nothing else to do: ‘At length, my Beer obtain'd a Vogue ‘With this and t'other merry Rogue, ‘Till jolly Broom-men, Coblers, Porters, ‘In Winter, finding good warm Quarters, ‘Flock'd in with clouted Shoes all o'er ‘As dirty as the Common Shore, ‘Call'd for full Winchester's of Stout, ‘And at one Guzzle toap'd 'em out, ‘Drank much, paid well, to my Desire, ‘Then knock'd their Heels before the Fire, ‘Some leaving Flakes of Clay behind. ‘Some, Rubbish of another kind. ‘This, ever since, I've taken Pains ‘To save, by which I know my Gains; ‘For as my Dunghil wasts or grows, ‘I find my Mony ebbs or flows, ‘And when 'tis much encreas'd, besure ‘I keep touch rarely with my Brewer, ‘But if the Clark observes 'tis wasting, ‘He durst not dun for fear of basting, ‘Because he knows his Master's Drink ‘Proves bad, or th'Dunghil would not sink, ‘For 'tis the jolly Rogues that keep ‘Their Meetings here, that swell the Heap, ‘But when they're poor, and fail to call, ‘My Mount does to a Mole-hill fall: ‘Thus, when good store of Dirt they make, ‘The more good Mony do I take; ‘But when my House looks clean and fine, ‘My Dunghil and my self decline, ‘For want of Dirt, and want of Coin. ‘Besides, yon little Bank or Hill ‘Has Properties more useful still, ‘For when the freezing Winter drives ‘The rambling Bees into their Hives, ‘The neighb'ring Fleas in such cold Weather, ‘Quit Dames and Dogs, and all hop hither, ‘And in that warm reviving Heap ‘Of Dirt, their Winter Revels keep, ‘So that if any chatt'ring Broom-man, ‘Scrub, Porter, Drab, or Basket-Woman, ‘Should sleep, or sing a tedious Song, ‘And keep a good warm Birth too long, ‘Up skips a Swarm of hungry Fleas ‘About their Buttocks, Thighs and Knees, ‘And makes 'em, scratching, fly the Fire, ‘That colder Guests may draw the nigh'r; ‘So that no room have I to huff, ‘Or say, Come Friends you're warm enough, ‘Remove your Places, and withdraw, ‘That others may have Cobler's Law. ‘The very Fleas do this, I say, ‘And more to serve me e'ery Day. ‘Who then, that from a Swarm of Fleas, ‘Receives such Benefits as these, ‘Would not esteem the dirty Place ‘That harbours such a useful Race. ‘Landlord, said I, we must acknowledge, ‘No Sophister bred up in College, ‘Could with more Ease, or artful Sence ‘Explain your Dunghil's Excellence, ‘Who could imagine you should reap ‘Such Service from a mouldy Heap, ‘And make more useful Observations ‘From Dirt, than some from Constellations; ‘Farmers, 'tis true, and Gard'ners raise ‘Estates from Dunghils, to their Praise, ‘But theirs are by industrious Hands, ‘Expended on their poorest Lands; ‘But you, contrarywise become ‘More rich by keeping yours at home; ‘Sure Gresham College never knew ‘A Virtuoso like to you, ‘That can with Art and Nature sport ‘And draw Conclusions from the Dirt; ‘Let us engage you to bequeath ‘This famous Dunghil at your Death, ‘To that Repository, where ‘Earth, Water, Spirits, Fire and Air, ‘And all the Wonders they produce ‘Are in Subjection kept for use. ‘Then shall Philosopers display ‘The Vertues of your Lump of Clay, ‘And in their Lectures spread abroad ‘The Worth of your mysterious Clod, ‘Which shall to endless Honours rise, ‘And sleep among their Rarities, ‘Whilst you that did, when living, own ‘This little Dunghil of Renown, ‘Shall, when you're dead, be well rewarded, ‘In having Name and Gift recorded ‘Among those worthy Benefactors, ‘To th'Philosophical Transactors, ‘Whose Wisdom, as a Man may say, ‘Will last for ever and for aye. The End of the Second Part. THE Contending Candidates: OR, THE Broom-Staff Battles, DIRTY SKIRMISHES, AND OTHER Comical Humours of the late Southwark Election. When some by Fraud and some by Stealth, Had fleec'd Britannia of her Wealth, And Rump had gall'd itself by sitting Full four Years longer than 'twas fitting, Till most Men found their Money flown, And Trade declining into none. Then Whig and Tory, Saint and Quaker, The Wealthy, Wise, and poor Wiseaker, Against the common Evil join'd, As if they all were of a Mind, And growing great as Kan and Cup, Cry'd down, what they had not long cry'd up. So he that chooses, thro' mistake, A Wife that does a bad one make, Commends her till the odious stain Of Levity appears, and then With the same Lips he prais'd the Jade, He damns the foolish Choice he made. The universal Cries that round The restless Kingdom spread their Sound, At length, by way of Retribution, Procur'd a joyful Dissolution: The Tories all seem'd highly pleas'd, And tender Consciences much eas'd: Great Expectations now subdu'd The Fears that had possess'd the Crowd, And every Party hop'd to see A Parliament both new and free; One that would pass no Bill to skreen Ill Projects and designing Men, But such as would redress the Wrongs, Which Thousand bear with silent Tongues, For Men of Wisdom in Distress, By Patience make their Suff'rings less, Whilst Fools, by their impatient Nature, Make e'ery small Misfortune greater. The Writs being issu'd from the Crown, And sent to e'ery Borough Town, The Candidates now drop'd their Pride, And humbly to their Slaves apply'd For Votes, and till they'd gain'd their Ends, Were e'ery Fool's obsequious Friends, With Liquors made the Husbands glad, And kiss'd the merry Wives like mad: But if these Measures chanc'd to fail, They'd other Methods to prevail. As he that courts a pritty Lass, For nothing but a loose Embrace; If Hugs and Flatt'ries will not win her, Gold, that will make a Saint a Sinner, Will gain her, or the Devil's in her. Among the rest, that ancient Borough, Where Farnam Hops oft travel thorow, Put up four Candidates, to try Which two, should t'other two outvie: The first, whose Title and Degree, May justly claim Precedency, Had with due Wariness prepar'd A Troop of Firemen for his Guard, As if his Worship, being wise, Foresaw some hot work would arise; And therefore, thought if Feuds and Heats Should happen, to perplex the Streets, His Salamanders might protect him From such, as did not much affect him. Accordingly this sturdy Train, With armed Noddles, led the Van, And in their hands they bore upright Their Fire-hooks, to defend the Knight, Who, lest some spightful Rogues, or other, Should think him a Dissenting Brother, To shew his mighty Zeal, Good Lord, Upon a Pole had fix'd a Board, Whereon was wrote the sacred Name Of Church, to his eternal Fame, But us'd no Epithet to show, Whether he meant the High or Low; Which made some think he was of neither, And had but small regard to either. However, let the quaint Device Be prais'd, or laugh'd at by the Wise, This wooden Mace, with great decorum, Was born in solemn Pomp before him, That Men might know, or guess at least, What Faith the doubty Knight profest, So those that hamper Rats and Moles, Carry their show Cloths upon Poles, That any Fool that passes by, May read their Trade with half an Eye. Behind his Body-guard, the Knight Appear'd, and made a gallant Sight, Upon a prancing Steed, that caper'd As if his Arse had been well pepper'd, Or, that some Jockey Rogue had given him An Eel that Morning to enliven him, For as the Trumpet sounded sweetly, He danc'd and cock'd his Tail most neatly, And with his fine accomplish'd Feet, Just as the Musick plaid, he beat True Time, upon the Stones i'th' Street. The Knight, thus mounted like a King, And dress'd as fine as any Thing, Made such a Figure in his Saddle, As on his Steed he sat a straddle, That even those that lin'd the Borough, To see the Cavalcade march thorow, Could not agree, which most, or least Deserv'd their Praise, the Man, or Beast; So that the Horse, some think, had quite As many Vot'ries as the Knight. To back our noble Hero's Rump, A Troop of Scarecrows march'd in Pomp, Just such as Undertakers call, To grace a solemn Funeral; Mounted on Higlers hobb'ling Pads, Lean Scrubs, and founder'd Hackney Jades, Such Dog's-meat Tits, or rather worse Than those that crawl before a Hearse, And fright old Women into Fits Of groaning, as they pass the Streets. Thus, arm'd with Oaken Sticks and Bludgeons, They fish'd about to catch more Gudgeons, And march'd their Rounds upon their Wo-balds, To gather strength like rowling Snow-balls. In this good Order and Condition, We'll leave 'em to their grand Procession, And when we want 'em, we'll contrive A Way to meet 'em, if alive. The next, whose Name is much renown'd, Tho' often in a Nutshel found, Was too much indispos'd, to head The num'rous Troops he should have led; However, in respect to those Good Friends, that did his Cause espouse, He ventur'd in his Coach to view 'em, And paid his Compliment unto 'em; That in his Aspect they might see all His Illness was not feign'd, but real; When this the prudent Sage had done, He left the Conduct to his Son, A Youth that charm'd the Lookers on; His dress so rich, himself so gay, So well accouter'd for the Day, That all the Dames, and Men of Fashion, Beheld him with just Admiration: No Turkish Aga ever rid A nobler Horse than he bestrid, So finely limb'd, so boldly chested, So neat his Head, so highly crested, So brisk his Eye, his Tail so long, All Parts so active and so strong; That the young Grecian seated close I'th' Saddle of Bucephalus, Could not in Stateliness exceed Our English Hero and his Steed; The Ladies view'd him with delight, And seem'd to languish at the sight, As if they strove to let him see, How much they lik'd his Gallantry, Whilst others rode curvetting by, Neglected by each Lady's Eye, And look'd as if they took distast, That one fine Youth above the rest, Should thus, by his engaging Air, Ingross the Praises of the Fair. So when the Rising-Sun expands His Lustre o'er the dewy Lands, The Stars that shone before so bright, At his appearance lose their Light, Whilst all the rural Nymphs and Swains, With Joy express a grateful Sence Of his enliv'ning Influence. Before the Troop, to please the Crowd, Two Boats were mimically row'd, By River-Slaves, in Coats and Badges, Supported by inferior Drudges, At e'ery Pull they puff'd and blow'd, And all the Arts of Charon show'd, As if their Oars had been imploy'd I'th' Thames, against both Wind and Tyde; Sometimes an arch unlucky Hand That row'd, forgetful of the Land, Mistook the Rabble Rout for Water, And with their Heads made ugly Slaughter; Then Oaths and Curses were bestow'd In Volleys, on the Rogues that row'd, Who, like true Maritim Bravadoes, Return'd, instead of Hand Granadoes, Rude Water Language fit to spout Away on such a Rabble Rout; New flying Streamers did adorn The painted Boats from Stem to Stern, Which, dress'd in Pomp, appear'd as gay, As Barges on my Lord May'r's Day, When the Twelve Tribes by Water go With Musick, which, to grace the Show, Play London Cuckolds all a row. Round these a huge Alsatian Throng March'd bellowing like Bulls along, Some clad in Fustian, some in Leather, Ratt'ling their Oaken Clubs together, In Love exchanging Knocks and Thumps, Bawling aloud, Down with the Rumps, Then roar'd like Thunder as they mov'd, In Favour of the Side th'approv'd, Jostling all others they suspected, As Persons diff'rently affected, And not by Principle inclin'd, To serve that Int'rest they had join'd. Thus, when the Rabble fill the Street, And Mobs of different Tempers meet, The strongest Number will impose The Truth and Justice of their Cause Upon the Weak, with Thumps and Knocks, As if their Clubs were Orthodox. Then rode the noble Youth, array'd In Marshal Habit, at the Head Of Thousands all compleatly mounted, A Troop too num'rous to be counted, No Horsemen hir'd to aggrandize The Show, and cheat the Peoples Eyes; But trusty Friends, and Men of Note, Who'd right to ride, and right to vote, Brave jolly Mortals, that appear'd As bold, as if they nothing fear'd, But in their looks express'd a strong Aversion to a double Tongue, And such loose Consciences that break Thro' Friendship's Bonds for Int'rest's sake. Thus e'ery Aspect did display An Ayre agreeable to the Day, And show'd that each possess'd a Soul, That could contend as well as pole, And bravely fight upon Occasion, To back the Int'rest of the Nation. Thus like a Regiment of strong And warlike Horse they march'd along, In Rank and File, as if they'd been Well skill'd in Martial Discipline, And that they now, like Men of Mettle, Were moving to the Field of Battle, In order to decide the Matter, Instead of Votes, by Blood and Slaughter. A Brewer next in Pomp appear'd, Behind a neighb'ring Body-guard, The First a very famous Rattle, That bullies much, but hates to battle, Yet we allow that e'ery Day He lives, he's free to dye for Pay, Not that the Hero is a Soldier, Tho', out of Danger, no Man bolder, But one, who, tho' of Death so shy, Yet dyes to live, and lives to dye. The next was of a Spaniel Nature, Whose Business lies by Land and Water, A Man that deals in Wharfs and Cranes, And gathers Wealth by others Pains, A Trade that first taught silly Rogues To run in Wheels like Turnspit-Dogs, And there, like Gally-Slaves, to sweat, And listen for the Word, Set, Set; No mortal Man among the Saints, More fam'd for Querpoes and for Quaints, His formal Dress and stiff Deportment Are both of the fanatick Sortment, He always gracing what he says, With Hums and Ha's, or Ekes and Ayes, As if in these Religious Times, He hop'd to sanctify his Crimes, By robbing Hopkins of his Rhymes. The Third that came, as People say, From o'er the Hills and far away, Is one that does increase his Pounds, By dabling much in Blood and Wounds; Surgeons perhaps there may be greater, But no Man knows the Crinkums better, And if he's call'd to undertake A Female Patient, tho' a Crack, Before he's paid, he will be bound To prove by Trial that she's sound; Therefore ne'er wants a double Share Of Business with the trading Fair, Sometimes his Pride will stoop so low, As Broken-Heads, Cut-Thumbs, or so, But then he cures all such Disasters, As fast as he can spread his Plasters; But, notwithstanding all his Skill, To make himself more famous still, He adds the Business of a Jockey, To that of patching up the Pocky; So that if any Friend by chance, Has brought a running Nag from France, He'll take away that fiery Racer, And sell him a good English Pacer. To these ill coupl'd Trades he joins A third, but all of diff'rent kinds; His next Pretence, tho' something strange, Is Broking on the Old Exchange, Where, neither crafty Jews, or Gentiles, Church-Tories, or the Sons of Pantiles, Can exercise, in trading Cases, More Stratagems, or sly Finesses; Therefore, as cunning Dealers know, Two Strings are proper to one Bow, He that takes caution to have three, Seems by his over-care to be Stock'd with more Craft, than Probity. The Fourth a Gallenist of Fame, Well known by th'Colour of his Name, As also by the Serpent's Tongue, Which in his fiery Mouth is hung, For when the restless Member speaks Of Churches, Crowns, or Politicks, He blends more Poyson with his Words Than his destructive Shop affords, And does more envious Rage discover, Than e'er was broach'd by slighted Lover; No Whig of Int'rest in the State, Can with more Spight or Rancour bate The Man that durst to speak in Praise Of former Kings, or former Days, Nor will the soundest Truths prevail Against his canker'd lying Zeal, Or Reason, with its utmost Force, Evince what he imbib'd at Nurse, But still supports, with Heat and Passion, The Prejudice of Education: And thus resolves, in spight of Truth, To hug the Errors of his Youth, And die with Breast-Milk in his Mouth. Thus early frighted with old Stories Of Raw-heads, Bloody-bones and Fairies, Men suffer oft their childish Fears T'impose upon their riper Years. The Fifth is of so vile a Nature, His greatest Virtues are a Satyr, And would no less than Vices seem In e'ery Profligate but him, Who'n Blasphemy so far surpasses All Rakehel's of a lower Classis, That e'ery little Sin, that he Commits, appears like Modesty, If but compar'd to some Offences, Wherein he gratifies his Senses, Foul Language is with him as common, As Scolding to an Oyster-Woman, And from him Oaths in clusters slip, Like Flatt'ries from a Courtier's Lip, Yet seldom swears, but swears awry, That is, to justify a Lye, Or, vice versa, stains his Mouth With Oaths, to falsify the Truth, As if it was his sole delight, To make Right Wrong and Falshood Right; Nor is there any way to know The Truth of what he does avow, But to believe the quite reverse Of e'ery thing he says or swears; For when he undertakes a Story, And aims to lay down Fact before ye, He utters Truth the self-same way That Conjurers and Witches pray, And must be backwards understood, If he means any thing that's good. So Optick Glasses manag'd right, Give great Improvements to our sight, But the wrong way if we apply 'em, Our Eyes are but confounded by 'em. The Sixth is one that scrapes and cobbles A Living out of Hops and Bubbles, Both bitter, tho' the last is curst, As more destructive than the first; By which our Hero, once a Songster, And Puppit-Dancer, when a Youngster, With other Tricks behind the Curtain, Has rais'd at length a pritty Fortune; Forgetting, that in Times of Yore, When Dad and Mam were special poor, They us'd to strole thro' Wind and Weather, And beat the dusty Roads together, With a fine Puppit-Show, to tickle The Humours of the Country People, And please each merry Dame and Fellow With Butterfly and Puncheonello. At other Times our young Cantator Strol'd as a chanting Ambulator, To distant Fairs and Market Towns, And there among the Rural Clowns, Old Gammars and young gigling Wenches, Sung smutty Songs on Alehouse Benches, For Bread and Cheese, and now and then A Penny, from a Nymph or Swain, Which, like a dutiful young Knave, At Night he to his Parents gave, Or, else they shook the Youngster's Breeches, Suspecting he conceal'd his Riches. But now the Case is alter'd much, And Time has stifl'd the Reproach, For he that us'd to sweetly sing, And please the Maids like any thing, On this Occasion rode with Sword And Pistol, like a Petty Lord, His Horse so richly dress'd, and he So full of Ayre and Gallantry, That none would guess, he ever follow'd A Puppit-Show, or sung a Ballad. But 'tis no Wonder, Men of late Should rise from such an humble State, Since Numbers into Coaches start, Whose Crimes have merited a Cart. These all were mounted for the Day, On Horses fit to drag a Dray, Strong Jades, that with a hearty Will, Could pull a Load of Stout up Hill, Tho' now adorn'd to make a Show, With Trappings fit to mount a Beau, Yet march'd before the Brewer's Face, In such a grave and solemn Pace, As if 'twas fancy'd by each Horse, He felt ten Barrels at his Arse. The Riders, fearing to be harm'd, Were all with Sword and Pistol arm'd, To awe the Mob, and fright away The naughty Boys and Girls from play, Who cry'd aloud, No P?n F?s, No B?rr?s, P?s, or S?r?t N?r?s, No L?m?h B?e, no S?h D?ct?s, No C?t?s, no S?m P?t, P?t?s, Down with the Rumps, no H?s and G?s, But Men of P?b?y and B?s. Thus, when the Sons of Satan quit Their Allies, and in Streets unite, The best sometimes cannot escape The Insults of the saucy Frape. Amidst the Mob the 'Squire advanc'd Upon a Steed that nobly pranc'd, Proudly attended, be it known, By many Footmen, not his own, Whose painted Jackets did declare To all the Croud, whose Fools they were, Borrow'd that Day, to aggrandize The Show, and please the People's Eyes, In hopes the Mob, those erring Judges, Would take the Train for Brewer's Drudges, And think what Lacqueys did appear, Were all the Froth of Ale and Beer. So Mountebanks that strole from home, To gull the Counties where they roam, Delude the Croud by outward Splendor, And false Appearances of Grandure. Behind th'Squire a swanking Troop Of Vict'lers, came in order up, Whose dropsick Guts, b'ing over tallow'd With fattening Hogwash they had swallow'd, Projected, as they sat a Straddle, Full half a Yard beyond the Saddle, Their great fat Arses hanging o'er Behind, as did their Guts before, Some nodding as they rode, some winking, O'ercome with Lethargies by Drinking, Whilst others puff'd and blow'd for Ease, Like Cramposes in stormy Seas, Each riding close unto his Brother, That one fat Squab might prop another. So my Lord May'r, when e'er he mounts His Palfrey, upon grand Accounts, Has always Heralds to support him, For fear his Horse should fall and hurt him. Draymen, among this heavy ars'd Tunbelly'd Troop, were interspers'd, Whose blubber Cheeks, by drinking swell'd, A sounding Trumpeters excell'd, And Lips seem'd harden'd into Horn, By Pipes they'd smoak'd, &amp; Oaths they'd sworn, Their Bodies of a Looby Stature, Beyond the common growth of Nature, Appear'd, as if they'd stretch'd their Guts To Cellars, or at least to Buts, By guzzling, to promote the Sale Of bitter Beer and muddy Ale: The Beasts that bore their pondrous Arses, Seem'd rather Elephants than Horses, And the huge Sots they did sustain, Look'd more like Castles, than like Men. Just such as made a threatning Show In Persian Armies long ago, When lazy Monarchs fought in Char'ots, And common Slaves pent up in Turrets, Threw Jav'lings from their moving Garrets. The rest that march'd in Pomp along, Were such an ill mix'd mottl'd Throng, That look'd like old Tuisco's Rabble, When first confus'dly led from Babel; Some Horsemen booted, but without A Spur, some spurr'd without a Boot, Others were such ungainly Curs, They rode with neither Boots nor Spurs, And wanting Whips to flog their Prancers, Had Oaken Plants like Country Grandsirs, Which oft they brandish'd, and with Shouts, Proclaim'd themselves true English Brutes. Among this strange promiscuous Crew, Scarce worthy of a Poet's View, Two Southwark Butchers chanc'd to ride, Both Beaus, and famous for their Pride, Bob Perriwigs they scorn'd to wear, Tho' made of the most costly Hair, But must like Quality adorn Their empty Noddles, closely shorn, With light Tye Wigs that cost the Ninnies, No less than ten or fifteen Guineas; Whence I conceive, if I guess right, Their Heads or Weights must be too light, Else they would think Tye Wigs and Beavers, Sute ill with Choppers, Steels and Cleavers, And sit upon a Butcher's Brow, Like a rich Saddle on a Sow; Nor does their Pride alone appear In Wigs and Hats the Blockheads wear, But in their charming costly Linnen, Too good for them to work, or sin in, Fine Cambrick Holland, dazling white, Fit only for a Wedding Night, When Bride and Bridegroom may compare Their Skins, as well as Shifts they wear: Nor do these Laniarian Beaus Stop here, as all the Borough knows, But furbilo their common Shirts With Laces, which, as Fame reports, Must cost three Pounds a Yard, or more, If bought of neither Thief nor Whore; Rare Ornaments, to grace the Cry Of what d'ye want, Sir, what d'ye buy, Fat Beef, or Veal, fine Lamb, or Mutton, As good as ever Hands were put on, There's a rich Sirloin, Master Hall, Not great coarse Meat, nor yet too small. Move you old Hag, you blind my Stall. These are fine Fellows, fit to strole To Maribone, or Hockley Hole, In costly Holland Shirts, and there To let go Dogs at Bull or Bear, And arch their sturdy Backs half round, To save poor Brindle from the Ground. Therefore, since Butchers can appear In Linnen, fit for Lords to wear, It speaks their Pride, and shows us, even The World is very fleshly given, Or Gain that from their Business flows, Could not turn Butchers into Beaus, And make 'em change their greasy Hair For Wigs, the proudest Fop may wear. Betwixt these two a certain Bride, Her Favours freely does divide, But when she grants to one blew Brother The Freedoms only due to t'other, She has the Grace, at least the Pride, To turn her Feather-bed aside, Because it never should be said, She e'er defil'd her Marriage Bed. Thus Wives that make adult'rous Leagues, And manage well their vile Intrigues, If tax'd, by some evasive Oath Affirm, they never broke their Troth, And even, whilst they're acting evil, Study new Ways to cheat the Devil. Among the rest, damn'd Sarah's Spouse Prick'd up his forked beetle Brows, Endeav'ring by a sham Grimmace To hide the Trigon in his Face. But all in vain, for ev'ry Eye May there behold his Destiny, And by his Features understand, He'll never drown, but die by Land, For if his Neck in danger stands, That breaks the eighth of God's Commands, What Man with Safety can be blest, That breaks the eighth and all the rest? This precious Mortal was imploy'd, To mount all such as pleas'd to ride On hireling Horses, to proclaim, Thro' dirty Streets, their Brewer's Fame, And teach the Mob to hallow forth Their Candidate's fictitious Worth, As did the factious Croud long since, Who'n Malice to their Sov'reign Prince, Cry'd up the Rump 'gainst Church and Crown, Till glad at last to cry it down. For who that's to Obedience bred, Can bear the Arse above the Head, Besides, all Rumps will grow too strong, And stink, if they are kept too long. Who then would chuse that Rump once more, That sat too many Years by four. The next good Work, this Bully Scrub, Engag'd in with the Southwark Mob, Was, by dark Measures, to procure Their Polls, for his Septennial Brewer, Among such Wretches, as would sell Their Country for a Cup of Ale, Or promise their precarious Votes, For petty Bribes, and drunken Bouts. Such stupid Miscreants, as think All Happiness consists in Drink, Will therefore of the Man approve, That gives 'em most of what they love: And thus, upon the Days of Choice, When drunk, and mad, and full of noise, They mount their crippl'd Roans and Sorrels, Elections turn to drunken Quarrels, And chuse their Members by their Barrels. 'Tis true, some Gentlemen appear'd, To grace the scoundrel mottl'd Herd, But look'd, as if abash'd, to find Themselves with such a Rabble join'd: Pray, therefore, take 'em not together, As Birds, that were of all one Feather, Because they seem'd a Comprehension Of all Opinions, Ross does mention; Yet join'd to serve the brewing Squire, According to his Heart's Desire, Having two cogent Reasons for't, First, for his Usefulness at Court; And, Secondly, because they knew He was a South Director too. Thus Whig and Tory will unite, To gratify their Love or Spight, And can disserve, or serve a Cause, According as their Int'rest draws. These we shall leave in Rank and File, Possess'd of Old St. Marg'ret's Hill, There for the Bailiff of the Borough, To view 'em as he marches thorow. The last, whose chosen Numbers made A bold Puissant Cavalcade, Crown'd, with himself, and his Adherents, The whole electorat Appearance. No Alley Scrubs on Hackney Jades, No Minters, Sots, or Bully Blades, No old fanatical Pawn Brokers, No Vict'lers, Tubmen, Draymen, Stoakers, Whose Wives, to please a Brewing Brother, Can stretch one Hole within another. No swearing Clarks, or Puppit-Show-men, No Jockey Prigs, or Kentstreet Broom-men, No stiff-neck'd Quaker to controul The Voters, when they came to poll, A Man of Paper, but no Letters, Chose only to insult his Betters, A rude imperious forward Saint, Proud of Formality and Cant, Whose Broad-brim'd Hat, of late was seen Converted to a useful Skreen, That Matters might be carried on By cunning Arts, discern'd by none But such good Men, who, tho' they look Like Saints, and will not swear by Book, Yet are so giv'n to falsifying, They'll lose no Cause for want of Lying. No awkward Horsemen here appear'd On scrooby Tits, like Asses ear'd, No Enemies to Church or Nation, But Men of Figure and of Fashion, True Lovers of their native Soil, Haters of every thing that's vile, Friends to Religion, Honour, Vertue, And e'ery Pow'r that does not hurt you. All nobly mounted on their own Fine Steeds, and fit to guard a Throne, A Credit to their worthy Friend, Whose Merits do themselves commend, And need no Art to set 'em forth, For Flatt'ry would debase their Worth. As should we gild a precious Stone, No sooner is the Gold laid on, But by our vain and fruitless Aim To add more Riches to the Gem, We wrong the Lustre that it bore, And darken what was bright before. The Magottorian Foot and Horse, Superior to the rest in Force, By this Time having march'd their Rounds, In order to survey their Bounds, Determin'd now to penetrate Into Alsatia, that free State, But closely meeting unawares The Knight and all his Curasiers. Firemen with Steel Caps on. A mighty Conflict soon arose Between the jostling stubborn Foes, Who fought full Ankle deep in Mud And Minters Dung, instead of Blood, Till with their Feet, the Dirt they stood in, Was mash'd into a Hasty-Pudding, Yet nothing heard but thundring Oaths, And hollow Sounds of Knocks and Blows, Till the puissant Knight, by dint Of Dirt, being pelted thro' the Mint, The Maggottorians gain'd the Pass, And gave the routed Army Chase, Who by the Help of nimble Heels, Retreated to the Neighb'ring Fields, Where Numbers, to their Comfort found They'd dirty Dabs, but scarce a Wound, Tho' many, to the Knight's Dismay, Were lost, that is, were run away; However, hoping for Recruits Among the Kentstreet squabbling Brutes, He took a Tour thro' Blackman-street, Near which, once more he chanc'd to meet The Magottorian Troops, whose Pow'r The Knight had felt but just before, And here, from the Superior Foe, Sustain'd a second Overthrow, Quite losing, in this last Defeat, The Honour of a safe Retreat, And therefore by his routed Host, Was thought unequal to his Post, And no ways quallify'd, or able, Like Captain Tom, to lead a Rabble; His Banner which the Motto bore Of Church and Trade but just before, Was now defac'd with Mud and Dirt, And made the Common Peoples Sport: An Emblem that too plainly shows The Treatment both have had from Foes, And that those politick Pretenders, Who would be thought their great Defenders, Behind the Skreen obstruct their Growth, And make their Markets of 'em both. So Rebels once pursu'd their Game, I'th' King and Parliament's good Name, But when aspir'd above the Crown, Their Business was to pull both down. The Victors having put the Knight, And all his dirty Troops to Flight, And thus a second Time subdu'd Their Foes, without the Loss of Blood, Now march'd uninterrupted, thorough Kentstreet into the crowded Borough, Where all the Rushian Party lin'd The Street, and complementing join'd The Col'nel's Troops, as moving on, Commanded by his active Son, To whose good Conduct in the Quarrel, His trusty Followers ow'd the Laurel. As Honours won by Sea or Land, Are due to no inferior Hand, But him that bears the chief Command. The Victors thus in solemn Pomp March'd forward, crying, Down the Rump, The Van-Guard pointing out their Way To th'Hill, where the Halsetians lay, Then turning to the left, when near, They made a Feint, as if thro' Fear, And thus obtain'd a Pass behind The Foe, by vertue of a blind, And by this well design'd Finess, Inclos'd their thoughtless Enemies, Then rush'd with mighty Force upon 'em, And at one daring Push o'er-run 'em, Unhors'd the Squire amidst the Fray, And made his Brewhouse-Guards give way, His Draymen, from their Horses thrown, Did into Vict'lers Cellars run, And hid their huge short-winded Guts Behind the Barrels, Fats and Butts, His routed Hop-men, being crafty, Fled to Inn Warehouses for Safety, And skreen'd themselves from Danger there, Among their Bags of Farnam Ware: His Backmen, overthrown by Force, To the next Brewhouse had recourse, And there conceal'd their batter'd Bones From further Thumps of Sticks and Stones; His Stoakers fled, in this Disaster, To th'Hole, where once they found their Master And there secur'd their empty Noddles From knock-down Blows and dirty Puddles. Thus e'ery Soul was glad to fly To some good Place of Refuge nigh, Leaving their frighted Steeds adrift, That Man and Beast alike might shift; Saving one Hero, nobly mounted, The boldest of the Troop accounted, Who made a Figure like a Lord, Arm'd with his Pistols and his Sword, And he, as soon as e'er he found The Danger, caring for no Wound, Rode off with all the speedy Force He could, to save both Man and Horse, Believing, whilst he spurr'd the Brute, That Thousands were in close Pursuit, Till at a Distance, growing bolder, He glanc'd an Eye athwart his Shoulder, And finding that he was not hunted, He stop'd, and fac'd about undaunted, Drawing his Sword, when out of Danger, Then damn'd his Wife to e'ery Stranger, By whom he swore he'ad been disswaded From riding with his Pistols loaded, Or, Blood and Thunder, he'd have driven The saucy Dogs to Hell, or Heaven. Amidst this raving Fit of Folly, We'll leave this Southwark dying Bully To boast his Courage, blame his Wife, And act the Coward to the Life. Thus Freemen oft with Clubs and Staves, Contend like Rebels to be Slaves, And squabble in their Cups, for those That are the Nations greatest Foes: What tho' this Man, or that excels, In shining Numbers at his Heels, Perhaps his Grandure may be owing To Mischiefs he has long been brewing. My Friends, pray, therefore, learn to know, That outward Pomp and noisy Show, Are but to gull the Croud below. FINIS. THE NORTHERN CUCKOLD: OR, THE Gardenhouse INTRIGUE. Far North from London may be seen An ancient famous Magazine, For which the Rebel Rump, long since, Contended with their Injur'd Prince, And standing upon Walls of Stone, Deny'd Obedience to the Throne. In this old Town that sounds so well, When nam'd with Hallifax and Hell, There dwells a Cuckold of renown, Whose Antlers are so overgrown, That e'ery Neighbour's Wife that's given To send her Husband's Soul to Heaven, Seems angry such a waspish Dolthead Should wear his Horns so high exalted, When each good Woman knows her 'Spouse Has title to as splendid Brows, And therefore thinks it hard, one Brother Cornutus should out-top another. Thus Strife and Envy will arise, Not only'n Virtue but in Vice; For as no pious Lady cares To see herself outdone at Pray'rs, So she that's wicked hates to be Excell'd, tho' in Iniquity. But, Reader, now before we enter Upon our amorous Adventure, Or tell you how our Northern Blade Was dub'd a Buck of the first Head, We'll speak a Word or two concerning His Occupation and his Learning, And let you know what sort of Dame He hugs, to sooth his Nuptial Flame; As also what a servile Tool His Buxom Lady chose to cool That lustful Itch, which many say, Her Husband ne'er had Power to lay, Did therefore, like a good Man, hire An Understrapper to supply her, That what the Master did delay At Night, his Man might do by Day. Thus merry Gossips love, we know, To have two Strings unto their Bow, That when one fails their Expectation, T'other may give them titulation. This fam'd Actæon, whom I chuse At present, to inspire my Muse, That she may sing in chearful Meter, Of Horns and Cuckoldom the better, Is Jack of all Trades by Profession, So call'd i'th' Northern part o'th' Nation, A Man of Wood, and eke of Metal, That deals by Wholesale and Retail, In Planks and divers Wares that come From distant Parts of Christendom; Yet ne'er cou'd find one Stick of Wood, To baste a bad Wife for her good; Not but, when Drunk, he now and then Corrects her, but 'tis all in vain: For when he beats her, 'tis her nature To still grow worse, instead of better, Pursuing with undaunted Gust, The thing for which she suffers most. Thus modern Wives, like Saints of old, Are made by Punishments more bold, And always shew most Resolution, When under greatest Persecution. Not all the Wood our Noddy boasts, If saw'd to Pails and hew'd to Posts, Would build a strong sufficient Fence To bound his Wife's Concupiscence, But still she'd leap o'er all to find Some Jolly Youngster to her Mind; For sporting Ladies are such Witches, No Bars can keep 'em from the Breeches, But, Hunter like, they'll boldly fly O'er all that interrupts their Joy, And wildly hazard their undoing, To catch the Game they are pursuing. Nor is her Spouse, whose Forehead bears The Failings of her younger Years, Without a darling Vice, as great As that which taints his Nuptial Mate, For, as she dearly loves gallanting, He's charm'd with drinking, roaring, ranting, And hugs the Bottle with as great Delight as she can hug her Mate, That few can tell, 'tixt Man and Wife, Which leads the most voluptuous Life; Or who, in truth, is most to blame, The toaping Cuckold, or the Dame, Tho' were her hidden amorous Tricks, As open as his drunken Freaks, We then perhaps might justly say, Her droughty soft salacious Clay, Would swallow more of human Spirit, Than all his Intrails does of Claret. For wou'd lewd Women in reality, Confess their own weak Sex's frailty, We then should find some Tittle-tattles, Would bear more Men than Men can Bottles. Not that our Northern Cuckold's Whither D'ye go, is such a Doxy neither, For tho' she does require, 'tis true, Much more than what her Spouse can do, Yet she was ne'er but once detected, And for that only stands corrected; For tho' a thousand times we Sin At that old Game of in and in, 'Tis prudence still to save our Bacon, And not to own our Faults till taken; Nay, then t'affirm it o'er and o'er, We never did the like before. For as the Spy that lays the Snare, Will make things worse than what they are, So Sinners catch'd, by dint of Nature, Will Lye and Swear to make things better. This is the Case, I dare averr, Of our obliging Lady fair; Who, tho' some Eyes had been upon her, And almost see her stain her Honour, Like Woman causelesly abus'd, Deny'd it stifly when accus'd. Thus Lying, tho' a Sin so paultry, Is highly useful in Adult'ry, May also claim a near relation To venial simple Fornication; For Bawdy Batchelors and Maids, Unmarry'd Punks and single Blades, When catch'd administring the Nipple, Will Fib as bad as marry'd People; For she that values Reputation, Yet loves a little Titulation, Tho' you surprize her Spark upon her, Will swear 'tis false, to save her Honour, And if you'd know the Reason why, All Lovers thus are giv'n to lye, Most Casuists skill'd in Rem and Re, In am'rous Cases do agree, The shame of being catch'd therein, Is ten times greater than the Sin. Madam in this Opinion, sure, Had been instructed o'er and o'er, Or else she could not have deny'd A Fact so plainly testify'd, That not a Midwife, should she hear her Defence, has Impudence to clear her; And therefore I'll proceed to put The Case, as Things fell in and out, And show how Envy did discover The Pastime of herself and Lover. As ancient Hist'ries are exact In Days and Years, as well as Fact, That after Ages may be wise, In judging former Truths from Lyes; So Poets, when they sing and rhime Of Love, should have regard to Time; Or how should studious Ambulators, That search Moorfields for Songs and Satyrs, Point out the Day to Brother Ninny, When bonny Jockey mow'd young Jenny, Or when poor Roger, to his Sorrow, Gave fruitful Dol a kind Good-morrow; Therefore, since these are Things of moment, On which the World are apt to comment, I'll sing in Form, without delay, O'th' Season first, and then the Day. In sultry Weather, when the Fleas Bit Wives and Maids above their Knees, And forc'd 'em, e'ery Summer's Night, To look their Smocks by Candle-light; 'Twas then, upon the first of July, A Sunday, kept by Christians Holy, When Sinners go to Church to seek The Lord for all the following Week, That Madam, having not the Grace Of God before her pretty Face, Guided by pow'rful Inclination, Resolv'd to sooth her am'rous Passion, And to improve that Afternoon, Whilst Jealous Jack was out of Town. Accordingly she Sighs, and feigns The Vapours in her Love-sick Brains, T'excuse her from that Day's Devotion, For something else she had in Motion. Her good old Uncle and her Mother, As Pious each as one another, To Church repair'd, and with them took A third, with e'ery one their Book, Not thinking what was to be done, Behind their Backs, as soon as gone; Tho' Mothers, who have felt the Pow'r Of Love, and know the pleasing Cure, Will rather cloak and forward Matters, Than baulk the Longings of their Daughters, Because they find, let who will grant it, Women must have it when they want it. The only Stumbling-block that spoil'd The Sport, were now the Nurse and Child; But as kind Ladies Heads ne'er fail Of cunning Shifts to serve the Tail, A Quaking Sister of the Light, Who'd bid this sinful World good Night, That Afternoon was to be carry'd On four Saints Shoulders to be bury'd; This furnish'd Madam with a Thought Convenient to advance her Plot, Like a true Female Politician, Without the danger of Suspicion. Accordingly she feigns an Ayre As grave as any Bawd at Pray'r, And tells the Nurse, the solemn Sight, Perhaps, might give the Child delight, And therefore bids the Gossip go With the young Babe to see the Show: The willing Nurse, not thinking harm, Departs with Infant in her Arm, And leaves her solitary Dame To Nod, kill Fleas, or take a Dram. But Madam, now the Coast was clear, And all things ripe to meet her Dear, Her Bubbies wash'd, her Smock as white As Cloe's on her Wedding Night, Before Enjoyment has defil'd it, And with the Tears of Pleasure soil'd it, Her Apron like the driven Snow, Her Head-dress fit to charm a Beau; No Stays around her yielding Waste, But all as soft as rising Paste, Before it's form'd for Fruit or Meat, Or harden'd into Crust by Heat; Her Belly round with often Brooding, But tender as a Quaking-Pudding; Her Buttocks plump, but pliant grown As Velvet Cushions stuff'd with Down, Which serve not only those that own 'em, But yield to all that press upon 'em. Thus loosly for the Sport attir'd, With Love and Lust alike inspir'd, Her Court she crosses at the Hour Appointed, to her shady Bower, Which she unlock'd, then look'd about her, As if she fear'd some Spy should tout her, Then turning of the Key, secur'd The Door, and so became immur'd. From thence she crept, like fearful Mouse, In silence to her Garden-house, There feasted for a while upon The thoughts of what was to be done, As soon as her Gallant should meet her, And like a trusty Lover greet her. For Women, tho' 'tis sultry Weather, Delight in things put well together, Who therefore can do less than wonder, How Men and Maids are kept asunder? At length another Garden Door Flew open, that was lock'd before, And in there pop'd an am'rous Beau, Who look'd as if well mann'd below. Then fast'ning well the Door within, At which he'd slily enter'd in, He step'd to th'place where Madam sat In pain, expecting you know what. Now all was hush, no Squeaks or Cries Did any Neighbour's Ear surprise, No Pray Sir, Nay Sir, Pish, or Fie Sir, Be civil, or I vow I'll cry Sir; No sign of any Rape committed, But both were still as if things fitted; For neither side, in all their Sport, Complain'd of Rudeness or of Hurt: Thus what they did, pass'd off in silence, A proof she was not kiss'd by violence, But that both Parties were agreed To freely do whate'er they did. So mutual Lovers, when they meet With equal Souls and equal Heat, Hug, Clasp and Kiss, without a pother, And jump with Joy one into t'other. At length, when Madam had been well Refresh'd, and towz'd from Head to Tail, And her Gallant, as we may guess, Quite surfeited with Happiness, Out comes the sweating Spark from sinning, And sets to rights his rumpl'd Linnen, Hitches his Breeches up more fast, As if fresh button'd round his Wast, Like one just started from the Seat, Where Mortals drop one half they eat; But he had been, we may surmise, At much more noble Exercise; Tho' some unpolish'd Brutes, perhaps, Who deal in Drabs and meet with Claps, Will say that Squtt'ring far surpasses The Pleasures of a Nymph's Embraces. No sooner had our spruce young Beau Trim'd all above and all below, But hanging down his Head, like one That had some shameful Action done, He makes his Exit at the Door He'd enter'd at not long before, Locks it, and in a Hole bestows The Key, and then to Church he goes, Like any Saint, to ask God's Pardon For Sins committed in the Garden. So pious Knaves, who thrive by Fraud, By no Religion check'd or aw'd, When Rich, would fain compound with Heav'n, And humbly pray to be forgiven. Next out came Madam from her Bower, More red than any blushing Flow'r, Who was, and is, 'till warm'd with Action, By nature of a pale Complexion, Her Garment much gallanted look'd, Which, with her Hands she smooth'd and stroak'd And likewise, with her tender Fingers, New quill'd her curling rumpl'd Pinners, Puff'd up her Gown and Coif behind, Made flat by being over kind, As if she'd stretch'd herself upon The Floor, which happen'd to be Stone, Too hard a Cushion for the Joys Of Love's sweet downy Exercise: But Proverb says, and we must own, Hard Shifts are better far than none. When Madam thus had stoll'n the Bliss, And righted all she found amiss, She reassumes her modest Ayres, And to her Lodge again repairs, Not dreaming any Eye had seen 'em, Or overlook'd what pass'd between 'em; But, Fortune, who does often prove A spightful Enemy to Love, Tho' blind herself she had her Spies To watch 'em with revengeful Eyes, Such as well knew the Cuckoldmaker To be her Husband's Understrapper, A Jolly Youth, employ'd to share The burthen of his Master's Care; But not behind his Back to do The drudg'ry of his Mistress too, Which if he did, without some Profit, He'd but a damn'd hard Bargain of it; For who, that's wise, would take the Pains To Sin for Pleasure without Gains, Or give another's Wife manuring, For nothing but the sake of Whoring. However, this young Blade was ready To please the Merchant or his Lady, Bought in and sold, receiv'd and paid, And carry'd on the Timber Trade, Thro' all the Week, excepting Sunday, But for dear Madam, work'd that one Day, Because in Proverbs old we read, The better Day the better Deed; And therefore they resolv'd to play Their Game upon that Holy Day. As if the Pleasure was the sweeter, Because the Fault was made the greater. So Armies that dispute the Right Of Kings, with so much heat and spight, Chuse Sunday often to decide The doubtful Cause by Battle try'd. No sooner had some curious Eye Beheld the Dame's Obliquity, But round the Town the merry Tale Was spread, and told o'er nappy Ale, Till made the Jest of e'ery Sinner, When o'er his Cups, or at his Dinner, The Mirth of Gossips, and the Pride Of all to Cuckoldom ally'd; For who that's Woman can conceal A Female Sister's doing ill, And not be glad to bear the Tidings Of any neighb'ring Wife's Backslidings. Thus was the Story buz'd about, Attested well, you need not doubt, For Women ne'er want open Mouths To broach or witness bawdy Truths, When 'tis to slander or bespatter A handsome Wife or buxom Daughter. As evil Secrets seldom long Lie hid from those that bear the Wrong, So this sad Family disaster Soon reach'd fair Madam's Lord and Master; For bosom Friend or busy Foe Will tell us what we would not know, And always take delight to tease us With News they're well assur'd wont please us. Alas! the same ill-favour'd Luck Attended our poor Northern Buck, For e'ery one was glad to tell him O'th' sad Mischance that had befel him, News as delightful to his Ear As sound of Drum to Wolf or Bear; For tho' a Man believes or thinks His Wife to be a naughty Minx, He hates to hear another say She's loose, or that she runs astray; Because his Brows must be the Sharers Of all her sinful slipp'ry Errors; Therefore the Husband must defend The Honour of his Wife's But-end, Or else submit his sprouting Head Toth' wanton Tail that wrongs his Bed, And own himself to be a poor Tame Cuckold and his Wife a Who?r 'Twas for these Reasons, many say, Cornutus thought it the best way To justify his Lady's Honour, Against the Scandal thrown upon her, Consid'ring if the Voice of Fame Should credit gain, that all her Shame Must fall at last upon his Head, And ever there be rivetted; Therefore, when Drunk, with addl'd Crown, He rav'd and roar'd about the Town, And vow'd Revenge on Whig or Tory, That durst report this spightful Story. At length, when he had lain perdu Some time, to catch he knew not who; After much watchful Pains and Labour, By chance, he fixes on a Neighbour, Resolving to severely handle Him, as the Author of the Scandal: Accordingly, to plague him for't, He cites him to the Bishop's Court, And makes him, after much Expence, Do Penance for his great Offence, Mounted in Church on Buffet Stool, Pursuant to the ancient Rule, There, in a Winding-Sheet, as white As any Ghost that walks by Night, He made a penitent Confession Of his unneighbourly Transgression, And, midst the Rabble got together, Declar'd what Cuckold brought him thither, And, to the Husband's further Shame, Publish'd the Failings of the Dame. Thus Fools that do their Pursestrings draw, In hopes to stifle Guilt by Law, At their own Cost the Scandal spread, And highten the Reproach they dread. Now, if the Reader wants to hear What the kind Dame can say to clear Her Innocence against the Charge Some busy Tongues set forth at large, True Woman like, she'll cry and quibble, And vow and swear upon a Bible, She met not, in the Garden-house, Her Confident, to wrong her 'Spouse, But to discover, if she cou'd, How'r Husband's Circumstances stood, To judge from thence, if he was able To spare her some new costly Bauble, Perhaps a Watch, Gold Chain and Locket, Or some few Guineas for her Pocket; Tho' most believe the thing she wanted, Was what her dear Gallant had granted, Else she had not appear'd all over Like Blowze just tumbl'd by her Lover, Sweating as much as Gammar Laycock, Just rais'd by Ralph from Mow or Haycock. Next this pretence, another lame Excuse she frames, to hide her Shame, Which is, that she by chance had found An ancient Author, much renown'd, Whose Print was obsolete and hard To read, and therefore she desir'd Her Servant, whom she knew to be A better Scholar far than she, To con o'er half a dozen Pages, To shew the Wit of former Ages, Hoping from thence to gather more Than Woman ever knew before. Thus, Madam, from young Flesh and Blood, Soon learn'd by Book how Matters stood, And grew so knowing that her 'Spouse Felt Female Wisdom on his Brows, The place which, Artists do agree, Tells Tales in Physiognomy; Therefore all Conj'rors read the Forehead, To know Folks Fortunes that are marry'd, Because the upper Lines best show The bent of what lies hid below; Or how should Wizards guess by Faces, The Marks and Moles in other Places, Or find by Ladies rowling Eyes, Which way their Inclination lies. Thus Madam, when detected, try'd All ways to prove she'd been bely'd, But still her blushing Cheeks betray'd Her Guilt, in spight of all she said. Therfore her Cuckold had much better Subscribe himself a Horned Creature, Than labour to defend his Head From Horns so firmly rivetted: Besides, they cannot shameful be, Since worn by greater Men than he. FINIS. THE Dancing Devils: OR, THE Roaring Dragon. A Dumb Farce. As it was lately Acted at Both Houses, but particularly at one, with unaccountable Success. Pray tell me, whether, in a vicious Age, The Stage corrupts the Town, or Town the Stage? For both concur, when Folly makes its way; But where the Fault begins, 'tis hard to say. Veluti in speculum.—Utile dulci. Near barren Fields, where Honour dwells, Disgrac'd with rotten Posts and Rails, Which long have fenc'd that spacious Square, Where Bawds and Bailiffs take the Air, And crippl'd Rogues, with Fronts of Brass, Implore the Aid of all that pass; Where loit'ring Vagabonds, by Day, Walk, gaze and starve their Hours away, And Bullies wrangle in the Night, With money'd Rakes that fear to fight; Where Players often take their Turns, To con their Parts in Summer Morns, And broken Gamesters strole to meet Some Cully that will Lend or Treat; Where neighb'ring Porters reel about, When gorg'd with Winchesters of Stout, To belch and fizzle out the Stinks Engender'd by their nauseous Drinks; Where Butchers often have a Call To Cricket, Boxing, or Trap-Ball; And where, when they in Summer curse The Flies, and sultry Weather worse, They drop at Night their stinking Veal, And other Meats too rank for Sale; Tho' 'tis ill Manners to offend The Nostrils of their bounteous Friend, For whom they cock their greasy Beavers, Battle their Bludgeons into Shivers, And ring their Marrowbones and Cleavers. Near to these Fields, as I before Have said, and now I say, encore, There stands a Fabrick of Renown, Erected to amuse the Town, Sometimes with Heroes raving mad For Love, or something else as bad; Whose Rants, too oft, perswade the Fair, They're greater Witches than they are; And that, when any charming Dame Has in her Champion rais'd a Flame, Her Frowns, if sh'as a mind to swagger, Will wound him deeper than a Dagger. At other times this famous Pile, With comick Scenes would make ye Smile, And show bad Husbands and ill Wives, Their very Pictures and their Lives, That each might laugh alike to see Themselves, and take the Stage to be Their own salacious Family. This House was, also, once design'd T'instruct, as well as please Mankind, That all degrees of humane Creatures Might learn their Duty to their Betters, And, by Examples on the Stage, Be taught the Manners of the Age, How Quality should be accosted, And how far Honour might be trusted, What Courtiers Promises are binding, And when their Words are worth the minding. Here Statesmen should, by Wolsey's Fall, Be caution'd how they grasp at all; And learn of Cecil how to steer The Helm, when threat'ning Storms are near; What Tools to bribe, what Cause to prop, How far to go, and when to stop; For Riders often lose the Race, By setting out too swift a pace. Here vicious Governors should see The dire Effects of Tyranny, And how proud Fav'rites have been torn From Kings, and made the Peoples scorn: What Vertues reign'd in Ages past, When Men were Wise and Women Chast, And how whole Kingdoms have been won By Valour, and by Vice undone: How Crowns, which purple Seas have cost, By treach'ry have been gain'd and lost; And how Great Men, misled by Passions, Have prov'd the bane of wealthy Nations: How Beauty, by engaging Arts, Hath charm'd the most heroick Hearts, And made Imperial Rulers wave Their Scepters to some female Slave. Here all degrees of human Race, Should see themselves, as in a Glass, And, by a well-digested Play, Be taught to govern and obey. Here Innocence should see the great Rewards that do on Vertue wait; And Libertines, that scoff at Priests, And make the Holy Text their Jests, Should in Don John behold the fate Of Princely Rakes, who sin in state, And prove as Wicked as they're Great. This also should have been the Seat Of Language, of Humour and of Wit, Of Musick, Poetry, and all The pleasing Arts Theatrical. Here Shakespere to Elizion fled, And, O rare Ben, should live, tho' dead, That their inimitable Plays, In others, might a Genius raise, And teach 'em to deserve the Bays. Here modern Wits, by Art, should court The Favour of the Noble Sort, And in just Characters expose, Sots, Cowards, Prostitutes and Beaus, Who langh at Vertue, and despise The sober Counsels of the Wise. But now, the Stage revolts from these Dramatick Rules, that us'd to please, And does, in scorn of Wit, impose Upon the Town, Dumb Raree Shows, Compos'd of Vizards and Grimaces, Fine Scenes, Machines, and Antick Dresses; As if old Plays were, by the Proud, Thought too instructive for the Croud, Because they show, in Ages past, How evil Statesmen far'd at last; Ought therefore to be quite suspended, Until the wicked World is mended, And nothing be allow'd to teach The Town, but Action without Speech, But Wisemen stil'd, Dumb foolish Whims, But by learn'd Blockheads Pantomims. Here Jove transforms himself, when mad For Love, into a Horned Pad, And then, his raging Lust to please, Bulls fair Europa cross the Seas: As if our Stage-Projectors meant, When this Dumb Op'ra they present, T'inform us, by their speechless fooling, How Dames of old, like Cows, lov'd Bulling; Or, that the Charms one Maid possest, Could change a God into a Beast. Why not? since Women oft, we find, New-mould their Husbands to their Mind, And Ladies, with their sweetest Looks, To Bucks and Rams, turn Lords and Dukes; Nah! ride 'em, if they bear the Rule, As fair Europa did her Bull, And wisely make the Nuptial Crest, At once their Holdfast and their Jest. Some damn'd the Bull, upon the Stage, And thought it gor'd the present Age; The blushing Ladies wish'd it thence, Thro' Fear the Horns should give Offence, Knowing, by Nuptial Observation, As well as skilful Penetration, That Cuckolds, like Fanatick Meeters, Are very tender-conscienc'd Creatures, And always seem much discontented, When e'er themselves are represented. However, now, all horned Brutes Are laid aside, to please Cornutes, And, in their room, a Beast of Prey, More fierce and terrible than they, Does from the distant Clouds fly down, And, roaring, scares the gazing Town; Not only with his pointed Wings, His Tail, his Tallons, and his Stings, But with loud Thunder-claps and Light'ning, Added to make his Looks more fright'ning. Therefore, fair Ladies, when you go To see this sad tremendous Show, If, by good Luck, you pregnant are, Take Courage, or at least take care, This monstrous Enemy to Marriage, Makes you not quake and spill your Porrage; For dreadful Sounds and Sights uncommon, Are dang'rous to a breeding Woman. But I, in hopes to please you better, Shall here describe this frightful Creature, In such a manner as no Bride May at the sight be terrify'd, But gaze her fill, and not fear losing What teeming Ladies gain by 'Spousing. In Ballads and in penny Books, Oft sung and said in Chimney-Nooks, There is an ancient Tale, concerning One Faustus, famous for his Learning, Whose wond'rous Feats, in Times of yore, At Fairs and Wakes were lyrick'd o'er, And made the Sport of rural Sinners, At Christmas Feasts and Wedding-Dinners. Now was this Doctor fam'd for prating Of Hebrew, Heathen Greek, or Latin, Or, for those common Scraps of Knowledge, By e'ery Dunce pick'd up in College; But for his depth in Magick Art, As good old Grand-dames do assert, By which, when e'er he wav'd his Wand, He could whole Troops of Dev'ls command, And make a thousand Imps and Furies, Dance Minuets, Rigadoons, and Bories; Force wand'ring Spirits to arise, And show their Shapes to human Eyes. Nah! by his magick Pow'r, compel The Dev'l himself, in spight of Hell, To sing a Song, when wise Men know They have no Harmony below, And that th'infernal Dominator Loves Musick next to Holy-Water: It sounds not therefore very well, That Songsters should arise from Hell, A place where no Musicians dwell. However, be it false or true, What Books report, and Ballads too, By all, who would be well contented, To have these Devils represented, Such Wonders may be heard and seen, At the Great Booth near Lincolns-Inn, As do with Crouds their Benches fill, Tho' fitter much for Windmil-Hill; Or for the Rounds of Smithfield, where That Lordly Magistrate the Mayor, Proclaims a Fair in solemn Pomp, With twenty Catchpoles at his Rump. Thus, when instead of Wit, we find Dumb Shows, of an inferior kind, Fit only for the Approbation Of Mortals in the lowest Station, Wherein a huge Sham-Dragon flies, And dancing Dev'ls in Crouds arise, The Stage where Poets should delight us, Is then, become a Hell to fright us. Nor does this Pile, which heretofore Was justly deem'd a Theatre, Deserve, from Harlequin's uncouth Designs, a better Name than Booth: For whilst the Lass preserves her Honour, We put the style of Maid upon her, But when corrupted, to her shame, We brand her with an odious Name. At this new metamorphos'd House, Where Hell does very oft break loose, And where they've little more to brag on, Than two good Dev'ls and one huge Dragon, The fam'd Projector of these Shows, That vex the Wits but please the Beaus, Does, by his Hocus pocus Art, Make all the gazing Audience start, In representing to their view, The Tricks old Faustus us'd to shew, Hoping e'relong he shall obtain The with'ring Bays from Drury-Lane, Therefore poor Harlequin's so civil, To sign a Contract with the Devil, That the New-House may damn its Rival. So envious discontented Wretches, When despicably poor, turn Witches, And then on Broomstaves ride in state, To be reveng'd of those they hate. Thus Harlequin, who long had vied With Drury-Lane, to low'r its Pride, And puzzl'd his contriving Wits, To plague his thriving Opposites, Labour'd in vain till he became A Wizard, under Faustus Name, And then, by th'Pow'r of Necromancy, He charm'd and tickl'd e'ery Fancy, From mighty Lords, to City Culls, And from great Ladies, down to Trulls; For tho' some Folks, in these good Days, Like Puritans, may keck at Plays, Yet they conceive it no Offence, To see the Doctor's Devil dance; And that's the Reason, I suppose, Why Saints and Sinners, Bels and Beaus, In crouds, dance aft'r'im, e'ery Night He's pleas'd to make himself a Sight. Thus far, my rude unpolish'd Song Is but a Proem, tho' too long, And now my Muse intends to make The speechless Show of Faustus spake; That is, in Hudibrastick Verse, He means to lyrick o'er the Farce, Which, by dumb Action and Grimaces, Has gull'd so many thousand Asses; But, lest I should offend the Town, I freely own myself as one. Excuse my Muse, she's forc'd sometimes, To use ill-natur'd Words for Rhimes, When really she intends no hurt, But only Snarls to make you sport; As Madam's Lap-Dog does, when e'er We kiss or touch his Lady fair, Too long I've kept you in suspence, I doubt, by dull Impertinence; But now my Muse has eas'd her Spleen, She's just beginning to begin, Tho' fears, her Farce will only seem, To Men of Sence, the Devil's Dream. The Necromancer: OR Harlequin turn'd Doctor Faustus. Act I. Scene, The Doctor's Study. The first thing Harlequin presents ye, Most humbly hoping to content ye, Is his own Person, in the shape Of Faustus, whom he strives to ape, But dress'd in a Pricisian's Coat, Or formal Cloak, as if he taught Some Alley Conventicle, where The Saints, for good Advice, repair, Just such a Dress as, heretofore, Old Faustus in his Study wore, When the poor Conj'rer was so civil, To strike a Bargain with the Devil, Which made the subterranean Prince Of Darkness, love the Garb e'er since, Expecting each fanatick Brother, Will Sign and Seal some time or other; Not such as deal in Alms and Pray'rs, But those Religious Conjurers, Who, tho' they boast their Gospel-Labours, Thro' Envy, make it their Endeavours, To raise the Dev'l among their Neighbours. As Harlequin with sober Looks, Sits musing near his Shelves of Books, With his good Genius and his bad, In white and sable Garments clad, Contending, in harmonious Lays, To lead the Doctor diff'rent ways, But thirst of Knowledge makes him chuse Th'Advice he's caution'd to refuse. Now from a corner of the Skies, A strange Epistle downward flies, And shoots itself, directly plumb, 'Twixt Harle's Finger and his Thumb. The Superscription of which Letter Is turn'd tow'rds every Spectator, That Boxes, Galleries and Pit, Should see what Hand the Dev'l had writ, Which, to each curious Eye, appears As grand as a Commissioner's, Who, when he Signs, will let us see He scribbles by Authority. But tell me, Criticks, if you please, You that are skill'd in Niceties, Why does this Letter from above Fly down, as if it came from Jove? When some young trap-door Imp, from Hell, Might have deliver'd it as well; For what's directed from the Clouds, Seems to be sent us by the Gods; But what th'Infernal Prince dispatches, To Wizards, Conjurers, or Witches, Should upwards be convey'd, to show, 'Twas Hocus'd-pocus'd from below; Tho' this their Advocates may say, That the Post-Dev'l mistook his Way. But that Excuse is next to none, Since Doctor Harlequin must own, There's not an Imp the Dev'l espouses, Or tempting Fiend that Hell produces, But knows the Road to both the Houses. Therefore the Reason to be given, Why the Scrowl drops, as if from Heaven, Must be our Conjurer's desire To shew what Magick lies in Wire, By th'Pow'r of which, we do suppose, All Puppits move in Puppit-Shows, Leap, tumble, dance like little Fairies, And play a thousand strange Figaries, Which oft delude the fond Spectators, To vow and swear they're living Creatures. Why then should such ingenious Arts Be ridicul'd by Men of Parts? When us'd with Judgment to surprize Great Persons, most profoundly wise. O vain attempt! to thus impose On Lords and Ladies, Wits and Beaus, When, by the way, tho' Juglers Tricks May puzzle Fools and Country Hicks, Yet wiser Heads discern the Cheat, And, scoffing, laugh at the Deceit. The Dev'l who has more Traps to take us, Than Mouse-trap-builder e'er could make us, Exhibits, now, Bait after Bait, T'entice the Doctor to his Net, Sings like an Angle to allure him; But can't, as yet, in Bonds secure him, Tempts him with e'ery worldly Good, To sign the Contract with his Blood, Lays him down Crowns and Scepters too, But still the Dev'l a bit 'twill do. At last, by means of some Adviser, His sable Highness growing wiser, Resolv'd to introduce so sweet, So fine, so charming a Deceit, That Flesh and Blood, tho' ne'er so cautious, Should not withstand a Bait so lusheous. And what d'ye think this strange uncommon Expedient prov'd to be, but Woman, A tempting Dev'l in Helen's Shape, On whom Young Paris made a Rape; And by his vile adult'rous action Brought Ilium into sad distraction: Accordingly up starts the Shade Of this alluring pritty Jade, With Face so fair, and Eyes so bright, Her Breasts so round, her Skin so white, Her Hips so plump, her Waste so small, Her Looks so Angel-like withal, That not a gazing Saint or Sinner, Could guess she had the Devil in her, Nor had this lovely Grecian Ghost Alone these soothing Charms to boast, But sung so sweetly to entice The Doctor's Ears, as well as Eyes, That he was all on fire to board her, As soon as e'er he'ad seen and heard her, But that the Devil, who watch'd the Water Of his new fine bewitching Daughter, Step'd in between, and would not suffer What Faustus was about to offer, Or else the Doctor would have try'd Whether his new intended Bride, Had been equip'd, like other Lasses, With Flesh and Blood, for Man's Embraces. Now after all the fruitless Baits, The Wiles, the Traps, the Snares, the Nets, That Maferstofiles had try'd, Aud Harlequin as oft defy'd, This last Temptation was so bright, That Reason stagger'd at the sight; And as that great Director fail'd, The Dev'l and all his Works prevail'd. So that poor Faustus now was ready To sign and seal, for one sweet Play-day With this fine Visionary Lady. Thus Beauty, tho' it's all but Air, A glossy Shade that decks the Fair, Yet wiser Man cannot secure His Breast against that fatal Lure, But when he's tempted flies in haste, To grasp what proves his bane at last; For so our Zany-Faustus far'd, When beauteous Helen's Shade appear'd, And with her Charms so struck his Heart, In spight of all his magick Art, That he, like other am'rous Fools, Broke thro', at once, weak Reason's Rules, And yielding to the fair Temptation, In hopes to gratify his Passion, Both sign'd and seal'd his own Damnation. From hence, we learn what Love will make Poor Lovers do, for Beauty's sake, Whose Pow'r no Mortal can withstand, Till Age has gain'd the upper-hand. No sooner had the Doctor sign'd His Contract to the Devil's Mind, Upon Condition to enjoy The Fair One who had ruin'd Troy, But running with extended Arms To take possession of her Charms, Young Helen, like a jilting Minx, From his Embraces downwards sinks, And when poor Faustus would have kiss'd her, Up starts old Belzebub's own Sister, An ugly Hag, as lean and frightful As Envy, and her Looks as spightful, So despicably poor and thin, As if her Food had only been Tobacco Quids and Royal Gin. Thus he that's fond, to an Excess, Of painted Looks and gaudy Dress, May fancy his alluring Bride, An Angel in her wedding Pride, But when the Damsel's unattir'd, The Beauty's fled that he admir'd; And he that chose her for her Charms, May find the Devil in his Arms. The Doctor now thought very strange Of this prepost'rous sudden Change, And stood a while in such surprise, That he could scarce believe his Eyes, But found, as most Men do, too late, His am'rous Folly and his Fate, And that the Dev'l had quite undone him, By putting this damn'd Trick upon him; Therefore resolv'd to triumph o'er Th'Infernals, by his magick Pow'r, And make 'em servile for the time Agreed upon, 'twixt them and him, Almost forgetting to condole The loss of his immortal Soul, Which pleas'd the Dev'l so wondrous well, He laugh'd three times, and sunk to Hell. Faustus, of Helen thus bereft, In mournful Solitude is left, And to his Books does now repair, In hopes to find some Comfort there, Striking a Folio with his Wand, And down it drops into his Hand, O'er which he musing sits a while, Reflecting on the Devil's Guile. Thus he that's guided by his Lust, Does to a dang'rous Pilot trust, Who shows him oft the pleasing Strand, Or wish'd for Shore that's near at hand, But drowns him e're he gains the Land. The End of the First Act. Act II. Scene, The Doctor's House. 'Twas now about the Ides of June, When Men and Maids together run, With Forks and Rakes to spend the Day In rural Sports and making Hay, That Faustus first began to shew The Wonders he had pow'r to do, Resolving now to make some Sport, And lead a merry Life, tho' short; Accordingly, as half a Score Brisk Lads and Lasses pass'd his Door, All dancing in a merry Mood, Tow'rds Fields adjacent to a Wood, The Doctor, by his Art, well knowing Which way the Nymphs and Swains were going Soon follow'd, bearing in his Hand That pow'rful Staff, his Conj'ring Wand, Without the skilful use of which No Dev'l would e'er rise off his Breech, But all, like lazy Louts, withstand The Doctor's positive Command. So stubborn School-boys ne'er apply To Book, except the Rod be nigh. Nor will the Jade that's resty, stir, Without the use of Whip or Spur. [Scene a Hay-Catr in a Meadow surrounded by a Wood.] The Doctor now, with nimble Heels, Ent'ring the fertile Meads and Fields, Found some at Work, some full of Play, Some carting, others cocking Hay, Some lazing on the shady Banks, Some telling Tales, some playing Pranks, Some hungry Clowns dispos'd to guttle, Some sucking at the Leathern Bottle, Whilst those that thought a Whet no let, Did to their Scythes new edges set, And lavish'd half their time in fidd'ling About their Tools, to cloak their id'ling. As Lawyers Clerks, who hate much pains, Neglectful of their Masters Gains, Instead of minding Bonds or Leases, Sit whitt'ling useful Pens to pieces. The Doctor having now a fancy To exercise his Necromancy, Strikes with his magick Wand the Ground, And strait is heard a pleasing Sound, The Lads and Lasses rowl their Eyes Around the Fields in great surprise, Unable to discover whence Arose these sweet melodious Strains, No blind Crowdero, lame and old, Or piping Swain, could they behold, No Fidlers stroling to a Fair, Or Barber, with his Citern, there; Yet with the Musick which they heard, They were at once both pleas'd and scar'd. Like Damsel's ripe for Generation, Ravish'd 'twixt Force and Inclination. Faustus observing some delighted, And others with his Musick frighted, Resolv'd, before the Rusticks parted, To make the gaping Crew light-hearted; Accordingly, with awful hand, He waves his diabolick Wand, And by his Pow'r compels 'em all To dance as at a Buttock-Ball, Where Belly-Bobs give no distaste, But Rudeness passes for a Jest, And e'ery close indecent Squeese, Betwixt the Navel and the Knees, Are only taken by the Fair, To signify the Love you bear. When, for some time, the Revel-Rout Had frisk'd their nimble Tails about, The Doctor, willing to conclude This merry hoid'ning Interlude, Circles his magick Sceptre round And round, upon the inchanted Ground, Till by the Motions of his Rod, With now and then a Stamp or Nod, He does the Clowns together muster, And makes 'em dance into a Cluster; Then, as directed by the Spell, They hobble out, so fare 'em well. Thus when the Dev'l, as here 'tis shown us, Has got an ugly hank upon us, Our Bodies and our Minds he teases, And makes us do what e'er he pleases. Therefore, ye Clowns, from hence take warning, And say your Pray'rs both Night and Morning, Then can no Fairies pinch your Arms, Or Wizards plague ye with their Charms, No Hags bestride you in your Beds, And gallup ye like Hackney Jades, At Midnight, thro' the misty Air, O'er Hills and Steeples, G? knows where, But, as your good old Grandames say, You may defy, if you but pray, All magick Spells, or Witches pride, The Dev'l and all his Works beside. Scene, The Doctor's House. The Doctor, having play'd his Tricks Among the Jugs and Country Hicks, Does to his Mansion-House repair, T'attend his Fortune-telling there. No sooner is the Wizard come, From the adjacent Meadows, home, But two young merry Jades make bold, And knock, to have their Fortunes told. The Doctor's Man, as arch a Knave As any Conjurer need have, Opens the Door with humble Mein, And, bowing low, invites 'em in. Scene, The Doctor's Study. Then leads 'em to the Study, where They silently sit down and stare At the Books, Globes, and Allegators, Huge Snakes, and other monstrous Creatures, Us'd by most Emp'ricks to delight, Or rather to amuse the sight Of the poor Fools they mean to bite. Thus Faustus makes the Maidens wait A little while, in point of State, At length approaches, and to show His College-Breeding, bows full low. For you must know, that artful Men Can bend in e'ery part for Gain, Yet still the pride of Heart retain. The Doctor thus salutes the Lasses, But not a Word between 'em passes; For Scholars vers'd in magick Art, By Signs, their Sentiments impart, And can another's Meaning reach, By gaping, better than by Speech. So the Free-Masons have a way, By private Signals, to convey Their secret Minds to one another, And can at once command a Brother, To quit his Scaffold and descend The Ladder, to salute his Friend; And this they do, as Fame records, Without the needless sound of Words, Which makes th'illnatur'd World conjecture, (Instead of useful Architecture) They, in Ars Magic, have some dealing, And with the Dev'l a fellow-feeling; For Secrets by such numbers held, Must be suspected, whilst conceal'd, Because, if good, they'd be reveal'd. Faustus, who is, among the rest, As free a Mason as the best, Having thus giv'n, by dumb Expression, The Maids a silent Salutation, Now importunes 'em, by a Sign, To eat, and drink a Glass of Wine, The Damsels freely condescend, And, No, I thank you, Sir, suspend; The Doctor then lifts up his Hand, And strikes the Wainscot with his Wand; Upon which Signal out there starts A Table, spread with Fowls and Tarts; Also a Sideboard fill'd with Glasses, And Wine to entertain the Lasses, All conjur'd in with so much haste, T'amuse the Eye and please the Taste, As if the Dev'l, give him his due, Had been both Cook and Butler too; For Br?n, whose bus'ness 'tis to please Rich Beaus with costly Frigasies, In twice the time, was never able To furnish out so nice a Table. The Maids now eat and drink their fill, As rural hungry Stomachs will, Not thinking that the Doctor's Feast Had been in Satan's Kitchen dress'd, But fed like any Farmer's Daughters, Suspecting nothing of such Matters; For had they known by whose kind Aid Their Banquet had been thus convey'd, And that Old Nick had cook'd the Treat, Perhaps, in spight, the Dev'l a Bit The squeamish Gossips would have eat. Loud knocking at the Doctor's Door, Is now repeated o'er and o'er: At length two tumbling Knaves, truss'd up In Trunks, like Dancers on the Rope, Are gravely introduc'd, to show Their Palms, that they their Fates may know. For Conjurers, who Fortunes tell, Altho' their Cunning is from Hell, Yet they pretend to Laws and Rules, By which they cheat believing Fools, And oft perswade 'em to agree, That they can future Chance foresee, By Planets, Moles, or Palmestry. Accordingly the Doctor looks Upon their Hands as Nature's Books, Examines e'ery Line or Streak, Tho' harder to be read than Greek; At length, discovers in their Palms, Carts, Gibbets, penitential Psalms, Ropes, Nosegays, Pray'r-Books, and a Rout Of gazing Rabble round about, The Hangman and a guard of Ruffians, Lamenting Whores, coach'd up with Coffins, And all the Marks that could portend A sinful Life and shameful End: Then thinking he by Art had read What Satan thus had put in's Head, By Signs, he makes the Tumblers know, The Rope would prove their overthrow: They, fearless of their Fate, despise The Doctor and their Destinies, And so concluding not to pay Their Fees, they laughing skip away. The Wizard, vexing to behold Himself and Art thus ridicul'd, Now shakes his Wand with Indignation, And brings 'em back by Conjuration, Dancing upon their Hands and Heads, To further entertain the Maids: Thus plagues the Rogues, 'till meer Compassion Makes him revoke his Incantation, And then away the Vagrants scour, Like Light'ning, from the Doctor's Door, Dreading what they despis'd before. So Orchard-Thieves, as Grandames tell, Encompass'd by a Midnight Spell, When early Day-light has dissolv'd The Charm by which they were involv'd, Run home more wild than Forest Horses; As if Old Nick was at their Arses. From whence all Mortals may deduce This exc'lent Rule, of wond'rous use; Which is, Who values peaceful Hours, Must ne'er offend Superior Pow'rs. Whether deriv'd from Good or Evil, 'Tis always safe, as well as civil, To hold a Candle to the Devil. The Doctor now his Exit makes, And with him both the Lasses takes: No sooner has he turn'd his Back Upon the Claret and the Sac, But the arch Man, behind his Master, Resolves to make himself a Taster; Accordingly he goes about To fill a thumping Bumper out; But Faustus cheats him, in a Joke, And turns the Wine to Fire and Smoke, From whence such hellish Fumes arose, As gave Offence to e'ery Nose, Touching the Sense so piping hot, That e'ery grave Fanatick thought He smelt a second Powder-Plot. This artful piece of Conjuration, This pritty witty Transmutation, Commands an Upper-Gallery Laugh, The while, Pilgarlick marches off. Thus many things, we find, will slip As Proverb says, 'twixt Cup and Lip: Nothing is sure i'th' course of Fortune, But Death and Taxes, they are cettain. Scene, a Windmil. The Miller's Wife now steps, by chance, Down from the Mill to take a Dance; By chance, we say, because we know There's not one Motive in the Show, That could induce her to become So merry by herself at Home, Except the Gossip meant, for ease, To shake off her tormenting Fleas, Those Plagues that skip from Breast to Breast, And feast, where Man is glad to taste. The Miller, who abroad had been, To take a Cup of Ale or Gin, Returns, does to his Mill repair, But finds no trusty Helpmate there; Comes down and spies the airy Jade Frisking her Tail about like mad. The Miller, pleas'd to see her Humour, Chimes in and dances with his Gammar: Now both their Heels were so employ'd, And tost about, as if they try'd Who was the nimblest, who the strongest, And which o'th'two could dance the longest; Just as they do at Fairs and Wakes, When Smocks or Gloves are made the Stakes. At length their active Legs and Thighs, B'ing weary of this exercise, They kiss, when they have danc'd their fill, And trip the Stairs into the Mill, As if their Inclinations stood To sweeter Pastimes, full as good, To please the Limbs and stir the Blood. So rakish Beaus and buxom Jades, At Buttock-Balls and Masquerades, First dance, and then away they move In couples, to refresh their Love. The Doctor in his hand now takes A Letter, and his entry makes, Calls down the Miller from his Dame, To send the Bumpkin with the same. The Miller, fearing to offend, Does at the Doctor's Beck descend, And after many Points and Signs, Receives, and Pockets up the Lines; But still, thro' Dulness, could not find The Place to which they were consign'd. The Doctor huffs and struts about, The Miller then begins to flout, And sucks his horny Thumbs, to show He will not of the Errand go; The Doctor, angry with the Looby, To find him such a sullen Booby, Strikes up his Heels, and turns the Clown Upon his brawny Buttocks, down: The Miller, whose impatient Rump Grew angry at this mortal Thump, Starts up, and with his mealy Cap, Gives Harlequin a dusty flap, Which sets the Conjurer a sneezing, And to his Eyes proves very teasing. This pretty Jest, in which does shine, So much Contrivance and Design, Does such a Laugh and Clap command, From e'ery Mouth and e'ery Hand, As if our brightest Wits had been Projectors of this wondrous Scene; Tho' some ill-natur'd carping Fools, Unskill'd in new Dramatick Rules, Suspect the Author stole the whole From some old Merry-Andrew's Droll, Contriv'd to make the Rabble laugh, And push his Master's Packets off. But Quality, in this bright Age, Those awful Judges of the Stage, On whose dread Looks, as Poets say, Depends the Fate of e'ery Play, May, surely, if themselves think fit, Applaud what's neither Sense nor Wit, And for their own Diversion chuse Dumb Action, such as Monkeys use. The Doctor, having lost fair Helen, Now wants to have a fellow-feeling With buxom Joan, the Miller's Wife, And only darling of his Life; Accordingly, to gain his Will, Upstairs he runs into the Mill, And at the Window finds the Dame, With whom he hop'd to quench his Flame, There gives her Earnest, in a few Sweet Kisses, what he meant to do. The Miller, looking upwards, sees him About such Work as did not please him, Then mounts the Mill, with jealous Heart And nimble Heels, to spoil their Sport, But running to the Window where He'ad seen the Doctor and his Dear; From thence they undiscover'd creep, And at another op'ning peep. The Miller, growing now as full Of Fury as a jealous Bull, Takes it, by what he'ad seen, for granted, His Horns were planting, if not planted: And thus enrag'd, Revenge he vows, Upon his Rival and his 'Spouse: But Doctor Harlequin, to fly The Danger that appear'd so nigh, Climbs the out Cornish of the Mill, But angry Ralph persues him still, And round they run, like Rats when Sporting, Or Rival-Boar-Cats when they're courting, Endang'ring, by a Trip or Stumble, Their Necks, at least an ugly Tumble, That must have cool'd the heat of Youth, And laid the Courage of them both. But Lovers seldom fear their Lives, When Woman draws and Fancy drives. Now Harlequin, with giddy Crown, Forsakes his rounding and comes down, The Miller after him, as fast As sweet Revenge could give him hast; Both eager, one to shun his Fate, Which t'other hop'd to perpetrate; But Harlequin, whose Heels had still The start of him that own'd the Mill, Now climbs the Shrowds unto the top, And leaves the Cuckold staring up: But headstrong Jealousy, that fears No Female Traps or Rival's Snares, Still spurs and urges him to chase His nimble Foe, from Place to Place, Who stands aloft, and with his Laughter, Teases and dares him to come after: The Miller highly vex'd hereat, Begins to climb like any Cat; Which Harlequin no sooner sees, But jumping quits the Shrowds with ease; And having now again recourse To his old Art, does, by the force Of Magick, whirl about the Sail, As fast as if it blow'd a Gale: The Miller clinging close, thro' fear He should be toss'd the L?d knows where, Cries out aloud for help, but none Can stop his Wings from flying on. The Wife comes running down in hast, Beholds the Sight, and looks aghast, Stands trembling, whilst her Looby flies, With Heels now pointing tow'rds the Skies, Which then again, in half the round, Are turn'd near Neighbours to the Ground. This merry Whimsy does obtain A Laugh from all Degrees of Men; And when they laugh, you may be sure The Women never look demure. A Sack of Grain, which had before Been planted near the Miller's Door, In order, as we may suppose, For grinding, when the Wind arose, Now takes a sudden strange Figary, And skips and dances like a Fairy: A rare Conceit, the World must own, To please the Humour of the Town: For it must needs delight the Eye, To see a Sack of Wheat or Rye So merry, when it's tax'd so high. The Conjurer, who thus had teas'd Poor Ralph, and his own Fancy pleas'd, Now slides away, concludes the Jest, And leaves the flying Sails to rest. The Miller's Man, amaz'd to see His Master in this Jeopardy, But finding that the Shrowds inclin'd To slack their pace, for want of Wind, Now lends a hand in time of need, That does at once obstruct their speed, And, like a kind good-natur'd Clown, Helps his poor giddy Master down, Depriv'd of Sense by panick Fear, And drunk with Motion and with Air, Who, at first Landing, reels about, As if o'ercome with Ale or Stout, And belches out the swallow'd Wind, Not only upwards, but behind, Till, by degrees, poor Ralpho gains His Legs and reconciles his Brains; Which he'as no sooner done, but in Again comes merry Harlequin, Disguis'd like an odd looking Fellow, I'th' shape of a huge Punchionello, With artificial Head and Hat Fix'd o'er his own unlucky Pate, And two false Arms upon his Shoulders, To cheat the Eyes of the Beholders, A wonderful surprising Piece Of Art, unknown to Rome or Greece, Contriv'd upon this grand Occasion, To gain the House a Reputation. For when our Players please the tast Of Fools, they always thrive the best: The wiser few are sorry Friends, The Stage upon the Crowd depends, They raise the Pence, and by their Praise Direct that Fools-cap call'd, the Baies. Therefore no wonder Wit should fail, And idle Whims succeed so well, Since in these Times we may discern Men love to laugh, and not to learn. Punch nimbly dances to and fro, His great activity to show, And with distorted Back and Breast Makes e'ery Step he takes, a Jest; But had the Butterfly been there, Which always should with Punch appear, The Lords and Ladies must have hurt Their Sides with laughing at the Sport. But since the Butterfly was missing, Which made the Show not half so pleasing, They shou'd have turn'd their Claps to Hissing The Miller and his trusty Fellow, Stood gaping now at Punchionello. At length, for Reasons good, surmis'd, That Punch was Harlequin disguis'd, The very Knave that had of late So plagu'd him and defil'd his Mate, Therefore resolv'd to have his Blood, Or at least cripple him, if he cou'd; The Clowns accordingly advancing, Seize Punchionello as he's dancing, And, without Mercy, drawing out Their stick-pig Knives to cut his Throat, Persue their Rage, and with a jirk Whip off his Head, to make sure work. Punch troubles not his Brains about it, But dances full as well without it: Th'Assassins both seem greatly frighted, But the Spectators much delighted: Twas very pritty, all Folks said, To see Punch dance without his Head, And keep true Time when's Ears were gone, As well as if he'ad had 'em on. The Miller and his Man stood quite Confounded at so odd a sight, At last take courage and agree, Once more t'attack their Enemy; And now, whilst their Revenge is warm, Each Ruffain amputates an Arm, And in a Fury tosses by The same, where they neglected ly, Punch keeps on dancing, not regarding The loss of Head or Arms a Farthing, But seems as brisk to the Beholders, As if they still were on his Shoulders, Tho' numbers stood amaz'd and said, 'Twas strange, in all the Steps he made, His Heels should never miss his Head. His cruel Foes perplex'd to see This long surviving Prodigy, Once more resolve to have his Blood, And rip his Guts out, if they cou'd; Accordingly, a third Essay They make, to take his Life away; But as the Clowns are cutting ope Poor Punch, to let his Garbish drop, Out skuttles Harlequin, and saves His Intrails from the bloody Knaves: Thus flies their Rage, as quick as Wind, And leaves his mangl'd Case behind. The frighted Miller claws his Ears, His Man, worse gally'd, gapes and stares, Both looking as profoundly silly, As Tipstaff, Constable, or Baily, When to their Scandal and their Cost, They have some scuffling Pris'ner lost. Excessive Claps, profusely loud, Were now most lavishly bestow'd. No wonder, for what Tongue could hiss At such a grand Device as this? Not only worthy of the Smiles Of those that rule the British Isles, But e'ery Mortal that delights, In Raree-Shows and pritty Sights, Next, to compleat this artful Scene, Aloft appears a fine Machine, A Chariot, such as Play-house Gods Oft take a turn in thro' the Clouds, When they descend near Earth, to know How merry Mortals live below, Upon the flying Horse or Mare, That whirls this Chariot thro' the Air, The Miller and his Man Lol-poop, Sit highly mounted, Cock-a-hoop, And in the Body of the Machine, The Miller's Wife and Harlequin, He toying, she as ripe for Jading, As if just come from Masquerading; And thus the Rivals, who, of late, Were greater Foes than Dog and Cat, Now ride aloft, 'twixt Earth and Sky, As Witches do on Hurdles fly, And after all their snarling Ruffles, Revengeful Broils and bloody Scuffles, They in a Moment seem to be In perfect Love and Amity; So, without further jealous Feuds, The Scene, in nubibus, concludes. Hereby we see how Men that dread The scandal of a forked Head, Bluster like Bullies, to secure Their Wives from any loose Amour; But when, by chance, they shall discover The thing they fear'd is done and over, Their Courage flags, and they become Obedient Slaves to Cuckoldom, Fondle their Wives, like tame Wiseakers. And fawn upon their Cuckoldmakers. Act III. Scene, The Doctor's House. Now Faustus having gain'd renown, In e'ery neighb'ring School and Town, For thus reducing to obedience The Dev'l and all his airy Legions, Some learn'd Collegiats have a Fancy To pry into his Necromancy, And see by what strange Conjuration, He'ad merited such Reputation, Accordingly, in Scholars-Gowns And Trenchard-Caps upon their Crowns, They knock at Faustus Gate, and gain Admittance by the Doctor's Man; Apologies they seem to make, By Signs, but not a Word they speak; Which to an Audience from the City, Seems wondrous Fine, prodigious Pritty, Because they give, as it appears, Their Eyes the pref'rence of their Ears, And wave their Intellects to fix Their minds on hocus pocus Tricks The Scholars being usher'd in, To Doctor Faustus Harlequin, Find several other Gownmen there, Conversing with the Conjurer; For Students touch'd with Melancholick, Are prone to Mysteries Diabolick, And love to talk with Men that know The Secrets of the Pow'rs below, Who by infernal Arts can bring The Dev'l to follow'm in a String, And, Hibre Biske, make him Shew What ever Tricks they bid him do. The Scholars having humbly paid Their silent Compliment, and made A tacit Signal, that exprest A dumb but mannerly Request, That the learn'd Doctor would impart, A Spec'men of his Magick Art. In answer, Faustus signifies, By courteous Signs, that he complies; Accordingly he strikes his Wand Against the Ground, and does command, The Shades of Hero and Leander, To cross the Styx and hither wander, A strange long Journey from below: But if the Reader wants to know Th'important Bus'ness they have here, I'll tell him why they do appear; These Lovers who had long been drown'd, Tho' living now upon dry Ground, Are conjur'd from Elysium hither, To chant a doleful Song together, In the fine new familiar way Of Singing, as a Man may say; 'Tis true, Old Charon Acts his part, And Sings a Ballad with some Art, Wherein he proves that Thunder, Plunder, And Wonder, gingle well with Blunder; Yet without Scandal to the rest, Of all their Devils D?k's the best, Who has acquir'd, by Time, and Study, The nack of pleasing e'ery Body; A happy Talent, which the Great, That Rule in Pomp and Ride in State, Could never boast—except of late. The Lovers having sung their Song, Not short and sweet, but dull and long, Soon vanish'd from this grosser Air, To live in Bliss, we know not where; Charon attending in his Post To ferry 'm to the happy Coast, A Paradise, or place of Joy, To which departed Spirits fly, But ne'er possess'd until we Die. Now Ladies, you that have been bedded By trusty Friends, or fairly wedded, If powerful Love's prolifick Dart Has touch'd you in a tender Part, Pray fortify the fruits of Marriage, And all stol'n Leaps, against Miscarriage, That what I shall describe, to please ye, May make no pregnant Dame uneasy; For lo, a Monster next appears, Not seen till now, this Thousand Years, As big and long from Teeth to Tail, As Trojan Horse or Greenland Whale, And at one Meal can swallow down A Church, or little Country Town, Provided neither are too large For his extensive Throat to gorge: No fam'd St. George, or Moor of Essex, Those Valiant Champions for the She-sex, E'er kill'd, to save fair Maids or Wives, A Beast like this, in all their Lives; For Serpents in those early Days, When Stout Knight-Errants fought for Praise, Were not much bigger than a Horse, Poor weakly Creatures starv'd at Nurse, But the bare Head of our Proud Dragon, Were it cut off, would load a Waggon; And when he gapes, his Mouth may par With Ludgate, or with Temple-bar; His glaring Rainbow-colour'd Eyes Give all Spectators great Surprise, And shine as dazl'ing in the Night, As any new-rub'd Convex-light: His Wings, a due proportion bear, As Sails do to a Man of War, And thro' the' Air convey the Creature, As t'other does the Ship thro' Water: His scaly Tail, that's twisted round, To save it from the dusty Ground, Stands always ready cock'd, to Dart His Sting into a Gyant's Heart, Or sturdy Knight, that should attack His Rump, or flinch behind his Back. For Dragons fierce like Women frail Bear venom both in Tongue and Tail, And if one End can't Execute Revenge, they'll make the other do't: His clumsy Legs, which are no more Than two behind and two before, On which he crawls sometimes for Ease, Are hollow, like old trunks of Trees: And in his huge Surprising Heels Four dancing Devil's he conceals; Which active Spirits, once a Day, He sends abroad to seek his Prey, As hungry Lyons do Jackalls, To hunt down other Animals. In this Condition, does appear Old Draco, hov'ring in the Air, Till by degrees he does descend, The Doctor's Fun'ral to attend; Then from his Legs four Devils start, And e'ery Demon, plays his Part, With other Spirits conjur'd in, To highten this amusing Scene, And make the Doctor's last Farewel, To humane Eyes, more terrible. So the poor Convict, when he's drawn Thro' London Streets to Paddington, The greater Croud surrounds the Tree, More solemn and more sad must be The dying Rogue's Catastrophe. Now up and down the Devils frisk, And e'ery Fiend seems wond'rous brisk, As if they waited for the Ghost Of some great Man from some high Post, Who when alive had been the bane Of thousands, for immod'rate Gain, Too tame and passive to complain. Now all the speechless Merriment, That Jovial Demons could invent, Pass'd round the Diabolick Crew, As Mirth, which Drunkards us'd to do, Some capering from side to side; With Kimbo'd Arms, to shew their Pride, Whilst others rowl'd their Sauscr-Eyes About, to give the Croud surprise: Among the rest, who thus attend The Doctor to his dismal End, A strange infernal ill-look'd Fellow, Hump-back'd and dress'd like Punchionello, Appear'd so very Brisk and Airy, So Active and profusely Merry, As if he was of high degree, Some ruling Dev'l of Quality, For in Proud Pluto's wealthy Court, Are gainful Posts of e'ery Sort, Which makes so many Thousands here, So vile and wicked as they are, In hopes of great Preferments there. At length the fatal Hour is struck, By some adjacent doleful Clock, Which sound informs the Doctor's Ear, That his sad End was drawing near, And told him he had sin'd beyond Relief, in signing Satan's Bond. The Doctor, starting, looks aghast, To hear the Clock proclaim his last, A dismal Passing-Bell indeed, When no Repentance can succeed; He having left no spark of Hope, In Pater-Noster, Priest, or Pope, But from the last tremendous Hour, Was solely in the Devil's Power, Who now with awful Looks and Signs, Commands his dancing Underlings, To seise with speed the reptile Sinner And give him Draco for his Dinner. Accordingly, a Sumpter Devil, Crook-back'd like Æsop, was so civil To mount the Doctor's driping Rump, Upon his huge distorted Hump; And thus, by th'help of two Supporters, Conveys him to his last new Quarters, The Dragon roaring, opens wide His Sparrow-Mouth, from side to side, And down he gulps him at one swallow, As glib as if he'ad all been Tallow; Then bellow'd like a greedy Beast, In pain for such another Feast; Now peals of Thunder rowl aloud, To terrify the gazing Croud, And render the tremendous Scene, More frightful than it need have been; The Dragon roaring mounts up higher, And gapes, to show his Mouth's on fire, Which like a flaming Oven looks When heating at the Pastry-Cooks. The Devils, to conclude the Jest, Cling close to the departing Beast, Among the rest the Doctor's Zany, Who made the Croud more sport than any, Catch'd hold o'th' Dragons Duggs and there He held and hung 'twixt Earth and Air, Resolving boldly to persue His Master's Steps, and like a true Kind Friend, to give the Dev'l his due: And thus, like Witches in a Seive, They mount the Skies and take their leave. The Scholars, or some other Youngsters, Singing the while, like doleful Songsters; By which we do suppose they mean To hide the screeks of the Machine, That as aloft the Dragon flies, Our Ears sha'n't undeceive our Eyes. So, when an injur'd Peer is brought; To die for some new Party-Plot, Lest Truth the Peoples Ears should reach, With Noise they drown his dying Speech. FINIS.</field>
