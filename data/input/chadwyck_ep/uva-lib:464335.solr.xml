CAMBRIDGE Ff. 2. 38 Lytyll and mykyll, olde and yonge, Lystenyth now to my talkynge, Of whome y wyll yow [k]ythe; Jhesu lorde, of heuyn kynge, Grawnt vs all hys blessynge And make vs gladd and blythe. Sothe sawys y wyll yow mynge Of whom Ã¾e worde wyde can sprynge, Yf ye wyll lystyn and lythe; Yn bokys of ryme hyt ys tolde How hyt befelle owre eldurs olde, Well oftynsythe. Sometyme felle aventure, In Rome ther was an emperowre, In romans as we rede; He was a man of grete fauour, He leuyd in yoye and gret honour, And doghty was in dede. In turnament and yn fyght Yn the worlde was not a bettur knyght Then he was vndur wede. Octavyan hys name hyght; He was a man of moche myght, And bolde at euery nede. An emperes he had to wyfe, The feyrest Ã¾at myght bere lyfe: These clerkys seyn soo. Sevyn yere togedur had Ã¾ey ben Wyth yoye and game Ã¾em betwene, And othur myrthys moo. Tho the sevyn yerys were all goon Chylde myght they gete noon That tyme betwene them twoo, That aftur hym hys londys schulde welde; Therfore grete sorowe drewe Ã¾em to elde, Yn herte he was full woo. The emperowre, on a day, In hys bedd as he lay Wyth hys lady bryght, He behelde hur feyre lere That was bryght os blossom on brere, And semely in hys syght. A sorowe to hys herte ranne That chylde togedur Ã¾ey my?t noon han, Hys londe to ye[m]e and ryght. Be hys lady as he sete, For woo hys chekys waxe all wete, That was so hende a knyght. When the lady can hyt see, Chaunge sche dud hur feyre blee And syghyd wondur sare; Sche felle on kneys hym agayne, And of hys sorowe sche can hym frayne, And of hys mekyll care: âFor yf that hyt were yowre wylle, Yowre counsell for to schewe me tyll Of yowre lyuys fare; Ye wott y am youre worldys fere, Youre thoght to me ye myght dyskeuyr, Youre comfort were the mare.â In hys armes he can hur folde And hys cownsell to hur tolde, And of hys hertys wownde: âNow haue we sevyn yere togedur byn, And we no chylde haue vs betwen, And here we schall not leue but a stownde. Y wott not how thys londe schall fare But leue in warre, in sorowe and care, When we are broght to grownde. Therfore y haue so mekyll thoght That when y am to bedd broght Y slepe but selden sownde.â Than answeryd that lady bryght, âSyr, y can yow rede aryght: Yf yow nothyng to ylle. A ryche abbey schall we make For owre dere lady sake, And londys geue thertylle. Sche wyll prey hur sone feyre That we togedur may haue an heyre, Thys londe to welde at wylle.â They let make an abbey thoo; The lady was wyth chyldren twoo, As hyt was Goddys wylle. Wyth chylde waxe the lady thore; Grete sche was wyth peynys sore, That was bothe hende and free; Tyll tyme felle Ã¾at hyt was soo The lady had menchyldren two, That semely were to see. Tythyngys come to the emperowre As he lay in hys towre: A gladd man was hee. Two maydenys Ã¾e errande hym broghtâ Wythowt gyftys yede they noght: Eyther he gafe townys three. The emperowre was full blyÃ¾e of mode; To hys chapell swythe he yode And thanked God of hys sonde. Yerly when the day can sprynge, A preest he dud a masse synge; Hys modur there he fonde. âSone,â sche seyde, ây am blythe That the emperes schall haue lyue, And leue wyth vs in londe; But moche sorowe deryth mee That Rome schall wrong heyred bee, In vnkynde honde.â âModur,â he seyde, âwhy sey ye soo? Now haue we menchyldren two, Ythankyd be Goddys wylle!â âNay,â sche seyde, âsone myne, Ther ys neuyr neyÃ¾yr of Ã¾em thyn: That lykyth me full ylle. For thou myght no chylde haue, Thy wyfe hath take a cokys knaue; That wyll y proue be skylle.â A sorowe to the emperowrs herte ranne, That worde cowde he speke noon, But yede awey full stylle. To hys chapell forthe he yode And at hys masse stylle he stode, As man that was in care. The emperowrs modur let calle a knaue And hym behett grete mede to haueâ A thowsande pownde and mare. To the chaumbur the knaue toke Ã¾e way, There as the emperes in chyldebedd lay, All slepte that there were; For why they had wakyd longe In peynys, and in sorowe stronge, Or sche were delyuyrd thare. âHaste the, knaue, wyth all thy myght Preuely that thou were dyght, And that thou were vncladd; Softly be hur yn thou crepe That Ã¾ou wake hur not of hur slepe, For seke sche ys bestadd!â Hastyly was the knaue vncladd, In he went, as sche hym badd, Into the ryche bedde; And euyr he drewe hym away, For the ryches that he in layâ Sore he was adredd. The emperowrs modur awey went than, To hur sone swythe sche wan At masse there as he stode. âSone,â sche seyde, âthou trowest not me; Now thou mayste the sothe see.â To the chaumbur wyth hur he yode. When he sawe that syght than Sorowe to hys herte ranne, And nerehonde waxe he wode. The knaue he slewe in the bedd: The ryche clothys were all bebledd Of that gyltles blode. Euyr lay the lady faste aslepe; A dylfull sweuyn can sche mete, That was so swete a wyght. Sche thoght sche was in wyldyrnes, Yn thornes and in derkenes, That sche myght haue no syght. There come fleyng ouyr the stronde A dragon, all wyth fyre brennand, That all the londe was bryght; In hys palmes all brennyng bloo Vp he toke hur chyldren twoo, And away he toke hys flyght. When the lady can awake A dylfull gronyng can sche make: The lasse was hur care. The emperowre toke vp the grome, The herre in hys honde he nome: The hede smote of thare. He caste hyt ageyne into the bedd, The ryche clothys were all bebledd, Of redd golde there they ware. The grete treson that Ã¾ere was wroght, The lady slept and wyste hyt noght: Hur comfort was the mare. Wordys of thys were spoke no moo Tyll the emperes to churche was goo, As lawe was in lede. The emperowre made a feste, y vndurstonde, Of kyngys that were of farre londe, And lordys of dyuers stede. The kyng of Calabur, wythowt lees, That the ladys fadur was, Thethur was he bede. All they semblyd on a day, Wyth myrthe, game and wyth play, Whan the lady to churche yede. Kyngys dwellyd then all in same: There was yoye and moche game At that grete mangery, Wyth gode metys them amonge, Harpe, pype and mery songe, Bothe lewte and sawtre. When the sevyn nyght was all goon Wyth allkyn welthe in that won, And mery mynstralsy, Ther was neuyr so ryche a getherynge That had so sory a pertynge, I wyll yow telle forwhy. Grete dele hyt ys to telle On the nynthe day what befelle: Lystenyth, and ye schall here! The emperowre to chaumbur yode, All the kyngys abowte hym stode, Wyth full gladd chere. The emperowre seyde, there he can stonde, Soche auenture felle in that londe Of a lady in that yere, Wyth soche a treson was take and teynt; He askyd wh[at] maner jugement That sche worthy were. When the emperowre had hys tale tolde, The kyng of Calabur answere woldeâ He wyste not what hyt mente. He seyde, âHyt ys worthy for hur sake Wythowt the cytÃ© a fyre to make, Be ryghtwyse yugement; When Ã¾e fyre were brennyng faste, Sche and hur two chyldren Ã¾erin to be caste, And to dethe to be brente.â The emperowre answeryd hym full sone: âThyn own doghtur hyt hath done: Y holde to thyn assent.â There was dele and grete pytÃ©; A feyre they made wythowt the cytÃ©, Wyth brondys brennyng all bryght. To the fyre they ledd Ã¾at lady thareâ Two squyers hur chyldren bare, That semely were in syght; In a kyrtull of scarlett redd, In the fyre to take hur dedd, Redy was sche dyght. The kyng of Calabur made euyll chere, For dele he my?t not stonde hys doghtur nere; There wept both kynge and knyght. The lady sawe no bettur redd But that sche schulde be dedd That day vpon the fylde. Wyth sory hert, the sothe to telle, Before Ã¾e emperowre on kneys sche felle And bothe hur hondys vphelde. âGrawnt me, lorde, for Jhesu sake, Oon oryson that y may make To hym that all may welde, And sythen on me do yowre wylle: What dethe Ã¾at ye wyll put me tyll, Therto y wyll me ?elde.â The lady on hur kneys hur sett, To Jhesu Cryste full sore sche wepte: What wondur was hyt Ã¾ogh she were woo. âJhesu,â sche seyde, âkynge of blysse, Thys day thou me rede and wysse, And heuene qwene alsoo. Mary, mayden and modur free, My preyer wyll y make to thee For my chyldren twoo; As thou lett them be borne of mee, Grawnt that they may crystenyd bee, To dethe or that they goo.â Kyngys and qwenys abowte hur were; Ladys felle in swownyng there, And knyghtys stode wepande. The emperowre hur lorde stode hur nere, The terys tryllyd downe on hys lere, Full sory can he stande. The emperowre spake a worde of pytÃ©: âDame, thy dethe y wyll not see Wyth herte nothur wyth hande.â The emperowre gaf hur leue to goo And wyth hur to take hur chyldren two, And flee owt of hys londe. The emperowre gaf hur fowrty pownde Of florens that were rownde, In yeste as we rede; And betoke hur knyghtys twoo, And gaf hur Ã¾e golde and badd hur goo, Owt of hys londe to lede. The knyghtys the chyldren bare There the hye weyes ware, And forthe full swythe they yede. The kyngys from the parlement, Eche man to hys own londe went: For sorowe ther hertys can blede. Tho the lady come to a wyldurnes That full of wylde bestys was, The wode was grete and streyght. The knyghtys toke hur Ã¾ere Ã¾e chyldren twoo, And gaf hur the golde and badd hur goo The way Ã¾at lay forthe ryght. They badd hur holde Ã¾e hye strete For drede of wylde beestys for to mete, That mekyll were of myght. Ageyne they went wyth sory mode; The lady aloon forthe sche yode, As a wofull wyght. So had sche wepte there beforne That the ryght wey had sche lorneâ So moche sche was in thoghtâ Ynto a wode was veryly thykk, There cleuys were and weyes wyck, And hur wey fonde sche noght. Yn a clyff vndur an hylle There sche fonde a full feyre welle, In a herber redy wroght, Wyth olyfe treys was the herber sett; The lady sett hur downe &amp; wepte, Further myght sche noght. The lady by the welle hur sett, To Jhesu Cryste sore sche grett: No further myght sche gone. âLorde kynge,â sche seyde, âof heuyn blys, Thys day Ã¾ou me rede and wysse: Full weyle y am of won. Mary modur, maydyn free, My preyer wyll y make to the, Thou mende my sorowfull mone. So full y am of sorowe and care That thre dayes are goon and mare, That mete ete y noon.â Be that sche had hur chyldren dyght, Hyt was woxe derke nyght, As sche sate be the welle. In the erber downe sche lay Tyll hyt was dawnyng of the day, That fowlys herde sche ?elle. There came an ape to seke hur pray, Hur oon chylde sche bare away On an hye hylle. What wondur was thogh sche were woo? The ape bare the chylde hur froo: In swownyng downe sche felle. In all the sorowe that sche in was, There come rennyng a lyenas, Os wode as sche wolde wede. In swownyng as the lady lay, Hur wodur chylde sche bare away, Hur whelpys wyth to fede. What wondur was Ã¾ogh sche woo ware? The wylde beestys hur chyldyr away bare: For sorowe hur herte can blede. The lady sett hur on a stone Besyde the welle, and made hur mone, And syghyng forthe sche yede. There came a fowle Ã¾at was feyre of flyght, A gryffyn, he was callyd be ryght, Ouyr the holtys hore. The fowle was so moche of myght That he wolde bare a knyght, Well armyd thogh he ware. The lyenas wyth Ã¾e chylde vp toke he, And into an yle of the see Bothe he them bare. The chylde slept in Ã¾e lyenas mowthe, Of wele nor wo noÃ¾yng hyt knowyth, But God kepe hyt from care! Whan Ã¾e lyenas had a fote on londe Hastyly sche can vpstonde, As a beste Ã¾at was stronge and wylde. Thorow Goddys grace Ã¾e gryffyn she slowe, And sythen ete of the flesche ynowe And leyde hur downe be the chylde. The chylde soke the lyenas, As hyt Goddys wylle was, Whan hyt the pappys feled. And when the lyenas began to wake, Sche louyd Ã¾e chylde for hur whelpys sake, And therwyth sche was full mylde. Wyth hur fete sche made a denne And leyde the lytull chylde theryn, And kepte hyt day and nyght. And when Ã¾e lyenas hungurd sore Sche ete of the gryffyn more, That afore was stronge and wyght. As hyt was Goddys owne wylle, The lyenas belafte the chylde stylle: The chylde was feyre and bryght. The lady sett hur on a stone Besyde the welle, and made hur mone, As a wofull wyght. âJhesu,â sche seyde, âkynge of blys, Thys day Ã¾ou me rede and wysse: Of all kyngys thou art flowre.

Beforne hur an hauen Ã¾ere she sye, And a cetÃ© wyth towrys hye, All redy there sche fonde. When sche come to the ryche towne A schyppe sche fonde all redy bowne, Wyth pylgrymys forthe to fare; Sche badd the schyppman golde and fee In hys schypp that sche myght bee, Yf hys wylle ware. A bote they sende ouyr the flode To the lady there sche stode, A wyght man in hur bare. By the maste Ã¾ey badd hur sytte; Of hur wo myght noman wytt, But euyr sche wept full sare. The schypp come be an yle syde, The schyppman bade Ã¾em Ã¾ere abyde: âFresche watur haue we none.â Besyde them was a roche hye, A well feyre welle there they sye Come strykyng ouyr a stone. Two men to the londe they sente, Vp by the streme they wente, The welle they fonde anone. A lyenas lay in hur denne And was full fayne of Ã¾o two men, Anon sche had them slon. So long on ankyr can they ryde, The two men for to abyde, Tyll none was on the day. Twelue men anon can they dyght Wyth helmes and hawberkys bryght, To londe than wente they. They fonde the lyenas denne, A manchylde lyeng therynne Wyth the lyenas to pley. Sometyme hyt soke the lyenas pappe, And sometyme they can kysse and cleppe: For fere they fledd away. They yede and tolde what Ã¾ey sye: They fonde on the roche on hye A lyenas in hur denne; A manchylde therin lay Wyth the lyenas to play, And dedd were bothe ther men. Than spake the lady mylde: âMercy, lordyngys, that ys my chylde, On londe ye let me renne!â The bote they sente ouyr the flode, To londe allone the lady yode: Sore wepeyd the schypman than. When sche came on the roche on hyght, Sche ranne whyll sche myght, Wyth full sory mode. The lyenas, thorow Goddys grace, When sche sye the ladyes face, Debonerly stylle sche stode. Thorow the myght of Mary mylde Sche suffurd hur to take vp Ã¾e chylde, And wyth the lady to Ã¾e see she yode.

The lady ynto the schyp wente, Thyrty fote the lyenas aftur sprente, Ther durste no man hur yn bere. There men myght game see, Fowrty men lepe ynto the see, So ferde of the lyenas they were. By the lady Ã¾e lyenas downe lay And wyth the chylde can sche play, And no man wolde sche dere. They drewe vp seyle of ryche hewe; The wynde owt of Ã¾e hauyn Ã¾em blewe Ouyr the wanne streme. The furste londe that they sye Was a cetÃ© wyth towrys hye, That hyght Jerusalem. As glad they were of that syght As fowlys be of daylyght, And of the sonne leme.

Ouyr all Ã¾e cytÃ© wyde and longe Of Ã¾ys lady worde Ã¾er spronge, That Ã¾ere on londe was lende; How sche had a lyenas Broght owt of wyldurnes; The kynge aftur hur sende. The kynge bad hur lett for noÃ¾ynge, And the lyenas wyth hur brynge To the castell there nerehonde. When Ã¾at sche before hym come, For the emperyce of ryche Rome Full well he hur kende. The kynge frayned hur of hur fare, And sche hym tolde of moche care, As a wofull wyght. Wyth hys quene he made hur to dwelle, And maydenys redy at hur wylle, To serue hur day and nyght. The chylde Ã¾at was so feyre and free The kynge let hyt crystenyd bee: Octauyon he hyght. When the chylde was of elde That he cowde ryde and armys welde, The kynge dubbyd hym knyght.

Eche oon seruyd hur day and nyght, To make hur gladd wyth all Ã¾er myght, Tyll hyt bettur ware. In Jerusalem can Ã¾e lady dwelle; And of hur odur chylde y can yow telle That the ape away bare. Now comyÃ¾ Ã¾e ape Ã¾at was wylde Ãorow Ã¾e forest wyth Ã¾e chylde, Be the holtys hoore; As Ã¾e ape come ouyr Ã¾e strete Wyth a knyght can sche meete, That chylde as sche bare.

The maystyr owtlawe seyde then: âHyt were grete schame for hardy men Thys chylde here and we sloghe.

When Clement had Ã¾e chylde boght; A panyer he let be wroght, The chylde yn to lede; A nurse he gate hym also, Into Fraunce wyth hym to go, The chylde for to fede. Home he toke the wey full ryght And hastyd hym wyth all hys myght; That was hys beste rede. Burgeys of Parys were full fayne; Many wente Clement agayne: A sklauyn was hys wede. They callyd Clement and kyssyd hym all, And broght hym home to hys halle; Hys wyfe Ã¾erof was blythe. Sche askyd hym the ryght dome How he to the chylde come, He tolde hur full swythe: âIn Jerusalem there y hym gete, For Ã¾ere wolde y hym not lete: The sothe y wyll the kythe.â The wyfe answeryd wyth herte mylde: âHyt schall be myn own chylde!â And kyssyd hyt many a sythe. âDame,â seyde Clement, âwhyll y palmer was, Thys chylde y gate wyth my flesche In the hethen thede; Into Ã¾ys londe y haue hym broght, For why Ã¾at Ã¾ou wylt greue Ã¾e noght Full ryche schall be thy mede.â The wyfe answeryd wyth herte fre: âFull welcome, syr, hyt ys to me, Full well y schall hym fede; And kepe hym wyth my chylde Tyll that he come of elde, And clothe them yn oon wede.â Clement than was full blythe, And let crysten hym full swythe, Hyt was [not] taryed that nyght. In the jeste as hyt ys tolde The ryght name he hym calde: Florent be name he hyght. Whan Ã¾e chylde was sevyn yere olde Hyt was feyre, wyse and bolde, The man that redyth aryght. Thorow Ã¾e realme of Fraunce wyde and longe Of Ã¾ys chylde the worde spronge, So feyre he was be syght. Euyr the burges and hys wyfe Louyd the chylde as ther lyfe: To them he was full dere. Tyll Ã¾e chylde was sevyn yere olde and more, The burges set hym to lore To be a chaungere. Clement toke the chylde oxen two, And bad hym to the brygge go To be a bochere; To lerne hys crafte for to doâ And hys kynde was neuyr therto, Soche games for to lere. As Florent to the brygge can go, Dryuyng forthe hys oxen two, He sawe a semely syght: A squyer, as y schall yow telle, A jentyll fawcon bare to selle, Wyth fedurs folden bryght. Florent to the squyer yede, Bothe hys oxen he can hym bede For the fawcon lyght; The squyer therof was full blythe For to take the oxen swythe, And gave hym the fawcon ryght. The squyer Ã¾erof was full gladd When he Ã¾o oxen taken had, And hyed owt of syght. And Florent to fle was full fayneâ He wende he wolde haue had hys hawk agaynâ And ranne wyth all hys my?t. Home he toke Ã¾e ryght way To Clementys hows, as hyt lay, And yn he went full ryght. He fedde Ã¾e hawke whyll he wolde, And sythen he can hys fedurs folde, As Ã¾e squyer had hym tey?t. Clement came yn full sone: âThefe, where haste Ã¾ou my oxen done, That y the begyfte?â Grete dele my?t men see thore: Clement bete Ã¾e chylde sore, That was so swete a wyght. âWyth odur mete shalt Ã¾ou not leue But Ã¾at Ã¾ys glede wyll Ã¾e yeue, Neythur day ne nyght.â As sore beton as Ã¾e chylde stode ?yt he to the fawcon yode, Hys fedurs for to ryght. The chylde Ã¾oght wondur thore That Clement bete hym so sore, And mekely he can pray: âSyr,â he seyde, âfor Crystys ore, Leue, and bete me no more, But ye wyste well why. Wolde ye stonde now and beholde How feyre he can hys fedurs folde, And how louely they lye, Ye wolde pray God wyth all your mode That ye had solde halfe your gode, Soche anodur to bye.â The burgeys wyfe besyde stode, Sore sche rewyd yn hur mode And seyde, âSyr, thyn ore!

Soche grace may God for Ã¾e chylde haue wro?t, To a bettur man he may be broght Than he a bocher were.â Aftur all thys tyme befelle, Clement fowrty pownde can telle Into a pawtenere. Clement toke hyt chylde Florent, And to the brygge he hym sente, Hys brothur hyt to bere. As Ã¾e chylde Ã¾orow Ã¾e cytÃ© of Parys yede, He sye where stode a feyre stede, Was stronge yn eche werre; The stede was whyte as any mylke, The brydyll reynys were of sylke, The molettys gylte they were. Florent to the stede can gone, So feyre an hors sye he neuyr none Made of flesche and felle. Of wordys Ã¾e chylde was wondur bolde, And askyd whedur he schoulde be solde; The penyes he wolde hym telle. The man hym louyd for thyrty pownde, Eche peny hole and sownde: No lesse he wolde hym selle. Florent seyde: âTo lytull hyt were! But neuyr Ã¾e lees Ã¾ou schalt haue more.â Fowrty pownde he can hym telle. The merchaund Ã¾erof was full blythe For to take the money swythe, And hastyd hym away. Chylde Florent lepe vp to ryde, To Clementys hows wyth grete pryde He toke the ryght way. The chylde soght noon odur stalle, But sett hys stede yn the halle And gaue hym corne and haye. And sethyn he can hym kembe and dyght That euery heer lay aryght, And neuyr oon wronge lay. Clement comyth yn full sone: âThefe,â he seyde, âwhat haste Ã¾ou done?

Wyth Ã¾e money that ye toke me Thys horse haue y boght.â The burges wyfe felle on kne Ã¾ore: âSyr, mercy,â sche seyde, âfor Crystys ore, Owre feyre chylde bete ye noght! Ye may see, and ye vndurstode, That he had neuyr kynde of Ã¾y blode, That he Ã¾ese werkys hath wroght.â Aftur Ã¾ys hyt was not longe In Fraunce felle a werre stronge; An hondryd thousande were there ylente. Wyth schyldys brode and helmys bry?t, Men Ã¾at redy were to fyght, Thorowowt Ã¾e londe Ã¾ey went. They broke castels stronge and bolde, Ther my?t no hye wallys Ã¾em holde, Ryche townys they brente. All the kyngys ferre and nere Of odur londys, Ã¾at Crysten were, Aftur were they sente. Octauyon, the emperour of Rome, To Parys sone he come, Wyth many a mody knyght. And oÃ¾ur kyngys kene wyth crowne, All they were to batell bowne, Wyth helmys and hawberkys bryght. In Parys a monyth Ã¾e oost lay, For they had takyn a day Wyth the sowdon moche of myght. The sowdon wyth hym a gyaunt bro?t, The realme of Fraunce durste no?t Agenste hym to fyght. The sowdon had a doghtur bryght, Marsabelle that maydyn hyght, Sche was bothe feyre and fre, The feyrest Ã¾ynge alyue Ã¾at was In Crystendome or hethynnes, And semelyest of syght. To Ã¾e kynge of Fraunce Ã¾e maydyn sende To lye at Mountmertrons Ã¾ere nerehonde, From Parys mylys thre, At Mountmertrons besyde Borogh Larayn, That stondyÃ¾ ouyr the banke of Sayne, For auentours wolde sche see. The kyng of Fraunce Ã¾e maydyn hy?t, As he was trewe kyng and kny?t, And swere hur be hys fay, That she must sauely come Ã¾erto; Ther schulde no man hur mysdo Neythur be nyght ne day. The mayde Ã¾erof was full blyÃ¾e, To the castell sche went swythe And sevyn nyghtys Ã¾ere sche lay; For sche thoght yoye and pryde To see Ã¾e Crystyn knyghtys ryde, On fylde them for to play. The gyauntys name was Aragonour, He louyd Ã¾at maydyn paramour, That was so feyre and free; And she had leuyr drawyn bene Than yn hur chaumbur hym to sene: So fowle a wyght was he. The gyaunt came to Mountmertrons on a day, For to comfort Ã¾at feyre may, And badd hur blythe bee; He seyde: âLemman, or y ete mete, The kyngys hed of Fraunce y wyll Ã¾e ge[te], For oon cosse of the.â Than spake Ã¾e mayde mylde of mode To Ã¾e gyaunt Ã¾ere he stode And gaf hym answere: âThe kyngys hed when hyt ys bro?t, A kysse wyll y warne Ã¾e noght, For lefe to me hyt were.â The gyaunt armyd hym full well Bothe yn yron and yn stele, Wyth schylde and wyth spere; Hyt was twenty fote and two Betwyx hys hedd and hys too: None hors my?t hym bere. The gyaunt toke the ry?t way To Ã¾e cytÃ© of Parys as hyt lay, Wyth hym went no moo. The gyaunt leynyd ouyr the walle And spake to the folkys all Wordys kene and thro; And bad Ã¾em sende hym a knyght To fynde hym hys fylle of fyght, Or the londe he wolde ouyrgo; And he ne wolde leue alyfe Man, beste, chylde ne wyfe, But Ã¾at he wolde Ã¾em brenne and slo. All the folke of that cytÃ© Ranne that gyaunt for to see, At the walle there he stode; As farre as they sye hys blee They were fayne for to flee: For fere Ã¾ey were nye wode. Owt went armyd knyghtys fyue, They Ã¾oght to auentour Ã¾er lyue; The gyaunt thoght hyt gode. Full hastely he had Ã¾em slayne, Ther came neuyr oon quyk agayne That owt at the yatys yode. Chylde Florent askyd hys fadur Clement Whodur all that people went, That to the yatys dud renne. Clement tolde Florent hys sone: âSoche a gyaunt to Ã¾e walle ys comeââ The chylde harkenyd hym thenâ âSone but yf he may fynde a man That he may fyght hys fylle vpon, Thys cytÃ© wyll he brenne, And sythen thys londe ouyrgone: Quykk wyll he leue noon Alyue that ys therynne.â âFadur,â he seyde, âsadull my stede, And lende me somedele of your wede, And helpe that y were dyght! Yf that hyt be Goddys wylle, I hope to fynde hym hys fylle, Thogh he be stronge and wyght.â Clement seyde, âAnd Ã¾ou oon worde more speke, Thys day y wyll thy hedd breke, I swere, be Mary bryght!â âFor nothynge, fadur, wyll y byde, To the gyaunt wyll y ryde And proue on hym my myght.â For sorowe Clementys herte nye braste When he on Florent hacton casteâ The chylde was bolde and keneâ An hawberke aboue let he falle, Rowsty were the naylys all And hys atyre bedeene. Clement broght forthe schylde and spere That were vncomely for to were, All sutty, blakk and vnclene. A swyrde he broght the chylde beforne That sevyn yere afore was not borne, Ne drawe, and that was seene. Clement the swyrde drawe owt wolde, Gladwyn hys wyfe schoulde Ã¾e scabard holde, And bothe faste they drowe; When the swyrde owt glente, Bothe to the erthe they wente: There was game ynowe. Clement felle to a benche so faste That mowth and nose all tobraste, And Florent stode and loghe. Hyt ys gode bowrde to telle How they to the erthe felle, And Clement lay yn swoghe. Chylde Florent yn hys onfayre wede, When he was armyd on a stede Hys swyrde ydrawyn he bare; Hys ventayle and hys basenett, Hys helme on hys hedd sett: Bothe rowsty they were. Bothe Clement and hys wyfe Louyd the chylde as Ã¾er lyfe, For hym Ã¾ey wept full sore. To Jhesu Cryste faste can Ã¾ey bede To sende hym grace well to spede: They myght do no more. For hys atyre Ã¾at was so bryght, Hym behelde bothe kynge and kny?t, And moche wondur thoght. Many a skorne there he hent As he thorow the cytÃ© went, But therof roght he noght. The people to Ã¾e wallys can go To see Ã¾e batell betwene Ã¾em two, When Ã¾ey were togedur broght. Clement hys fadur wo was he Tyll he wyste whych schulde maystyr be, Gladd was he noght. The chylde came to Ã¾e yatys sone, And bad Ã¾e portar them ondone And opyn them full wyde. All Ã¾at abowt Ã¾e chylde stode Laghed as they were wode, And skornyd hym that tyde. Euery man seyde to hys fere: âHere comyth an hardy bachelere, Hym besemyth well to ryde; Men may see be hys bre[ny]e bryght That he ys an hardy knyght, The gyaunt to abyde.â The gyaunt vpryght can stonde And toke hys burdon yn hys honde, Of stele that was vnryde; To the chylde smote he so That Ã¾e chyldys shylde brake yn two And felle on euery syde. The chylde was neuyr ?yt so wo That hys schylde was brokyn yn two: More he thoght to byde. To Ã¾e gyaunt he smote so sore That hys ry?t arme flye of Ã¾ore: The blode stremyd wyde.

He rode forthe wyth egur mode To the gyaunt there he stode: There was no chyldys play. The gyaunt to the chylde smote so That hys hors and he to grounde dud go; The stede on kneys lay. Clement cryed wyth egur mode: âSone, be now of comfort gode, And venge the yf thou may!â As euyll as the chylde farde, When he Clementys speche harde, Hys harte beganne to bolde. Boldely hys swyrde he lawght, To the gyaunt soche a strok he raght That all hys blode can colde. He hytt the gyaunt on Ã¾e schouldur boon That to the pappe the swyrde ranne: To grounde can he folde. Thus hyt was, Ã¾orow Goddys grace, The gyaunt swownyd yn that place, In geste as hyt ys tolde. The kyngys on the wallys stode; Whan the gyaunt to grounde yode All gladd they were; All the people at the chylde loghe, How he the gyauntys helme ofdroghe And hys hedd he smote of there. The chylde lepe vpon hys stede And rode awey a gode spede; Wyth them spake he no more. The chylde toke the ryght way To Mountmertrons Ã¾ere the mayde lay, And the hedd wyth hym he bare. When he came to Ã¾e maydyns halle He fonde the boordys couyrde all, And redy to go to mete. The maydyn that was so mylde of mode, In a kyrtull there sche stode, And bowne sche was to sete. âDamysell,â he seyde, âfeyre and free, Well gretyth thy lemman the Of that he the behete. Here an hedd y haue the broght, The kyngys of Fraunce ys hyt noght: Hyt ys euyll to gete.â The byrde bryght as golde [b]ye When sche the gyauntys hedd sye, Well sche hyt kende. âMe thynkyth he was trewe of hete; The kyngys when he myght not gete Hys own that he me sende.â âDamysell,â he seyde, âfeyre and bryght, Now wyll y haue Ã¾at Ã¾ou hym hyght.â And ouyr hys sadull he leynyd. Oftesythys he kyste that may, And hente hur vp and rode away, That all the brygge can bende. Crye and noyse rose yn the towne; Sone ther was to batell bowne Many an hardy knyght, Wyth sperys longe and schyldys browne; Florent let the maydyn adowne And made hym bowne to fyght. Hur skarlet sleue he schare of then, He seyde, âLady, be thys ye shall me ken, When ye me see by syght.â Soche loue waxe betwene Ã¾em two That the lady wepte for wo, When he ne wynne hur myght. Chylde Florent yn onfeyre wede Sprange owt as sparkyll on glede, The sothe for to say; Many hethen men that stownde In dede he broght to Ã¾e grounde: There was no chyldys play. When Florent beganne to fownde, Wythowt any weme of wownde, To Parys he toke the way. The hethyn men were so fordredd, To Cleremount wyth Ã¾e mayde Ã¾ey fledd There the sowdon lay. In hur fadur pauylon There Ã¾ey let the maydyn downe, And sche knelyd on knee. The sowdon was full blythe, To hys doghtur he went swythe And kyssyd hur sythys thre.

Sche tolde hur fadur and wolde not layne How Araganour Ã¾e gyaunt was slayne: A sory man was he. âLeue fadur,â sche seyde, âthyn ore, At Mountmertrons let me be no more, So nere the Crysten to bene. In soche auenture y was today That a rybawde had me borne away, For all my knyghtys kene; Ther was no man yn hethyn londe Myght sytte a dynte of hys honde, The traytur was so [b]reme.

When the folke had all eton, Clement had not all forgeton, Hys purce he openyd thore. Thyrty florens forthe caste he: âHaue here for my sone and me, I may pay for no more.â Clement was so curtes and wyse, He wende hyt had ben merchandyse, The pryde that he sawe thore. At Clement logh the kyngys all, So dud the knyghtys yn Ã¾at halle, And chylde Florent schamyd sore. The emperour than spekyth he To Florent, that was feyre and fre, Wordys wondur stylle: âYonge knyght, y pray the, Ys he thy fadur, telle Ã¾ou me?â The chylde answeryd Ã¾ertylle: âSyr, loue y had neuyr hym to As y schulde to my fadur do, In herte ne yn wylle. Of all the men Ã¾at euyr y sye, Moost yeuyth my herte to yow trewly: Syr, take hyt not yn ylle.â The emperour let calle Clement there; He hym sett hym full nere On the hygh deyse. He bad hym telle the ryght dome How he to the chylde come, The sothe wythowten lees. âSyr, Ã¾ys chylde was take yn a forest From a lady wyth a wylde beest, In a grete wyldurnes; And y hym boght for twenty pownde, Eche peny hole and sownde, And seyde my sone he was.â The emperour than was full blythe Of that tythynge for [to] lythe, And thankyd God almyght. The emperour felle on kne full swythe And kyste the chylde an hondryd sythe, And worschyppyd God full ryght; Well he wyste, wythowt lees, That he hys own sone was; All gamyd, kyng and knyght. The chyldys name was chaungyd wyth dome, And callyd hym syr Florent of Rome, As hyt was gode ryght. The emperour was blythe of chere, The terys traylyd downe on hys lere; He made full grete care. âAllas,â he seyde, âmy feyre wyfe, The beste lady that euyr bare lyfe, Schall y hur see no more? Me were leuyr then all the golde That euyr was vpon molde, And sche alyue wore.â The emperour gaue Clement townys fele, To leue yn ryches and yn wele, Inowe for euyrmore. On a nyght as the chylde yn bedd lay He thoght on hys feyre may, Mekyll was he yn care. The chylde had nodur reste ne ro For thoght how he my?t come hur to, And what hym beste ware. The chylde Ã¾oght, for Ã¾e maydyns sake, A message that he wolde make, And to the sowdon fare; On the morne he sadulde hys stede And armyd hym yn ryche wede; A braunche of olefe he bare. Hyt was of messengerys the lawe A braunche of [o]lefe for to haue, And yn ther honde to bere. For the ordynaunce was so, Messengerys schulde sauely come and go, And no man do them dere. The chylde toke Ã¾e ryght way To Cleremount as hyt lay, Wyth hym hys grete heere. At Ã¾e halle dore he reynyd hys stede, And on hys fete yn he yede, A messengere as he were. Than spake Ã¾e chylde wyth hardy mode Before the sowdon Ã¾ere he stode, As a man of moche myght: âThe kynge of Fraunce me hedur sende And byddyÃ¾ Ã¾e owt of hys londe Ã¾ou wynd, Thou werryst ageyn Ã¾e ryght; Or he wyll brynge agenste the Thyrty thousande tolde be thre, Wyth helmys and hawberkys bryght; Eche kny?t schall thyrty squyers haue, And euery squyer a foteknaue Worthe an hethyn knyght.â Than began the sowdon to speke, There he sate at hys ryche mete, Amonge hys knyghtys kene: âThe kyng of Fraunce shall welcome be; Agenste oon he schall haue thre, I wot wythowten wene, That also fayne are of fyght As fowle of day aftur nyght, To schewe ther schyldys schene. To proue tomorne, be my lay, I wyll neuyr set lenger day, Than schall the sothe be sene.â Than spekyth Ã¾e mayde wyth mylde mode To feyre Florent there he stode, That was so swete a wyght: âMessengere, y wolde the frayne Whedur he be knyght or swayne, That ys so moche of myght, That hath my fadurs gyaunt slayne, And rauyschyd me fro Borogh Larayn, And slewe there many a knyght.â Thogh sche monyd hym to ylle, ?yt were hyt mykull yn hur wylle To haue of hym a syght. âLady,â he seyde, ânodur lesse nor more Than yf hyt myselfe wore; Syth Ã¾ou wylt of me frayne, Thou schalt me knowe yn all Ã¾e heere, Thy sleue y wyll bere on my spere, In the batell playne.â All they wyste ther by than That he was the same man That had the gyaunt slayne. Wythowt ony odur worde All they start fro the borde, Wyth swyrdys and knyuys drawyn. Florent sawe none odur bote But Ã¾at he muste fyght on fote Agenste the Sarsyns all; And euyr he hyt them amonge Where he sawe the thykest thronge: Full fele dud he the[n] falle. Some be the armys he nome That all the schouldur wyth hym come, The prowdyst yn the halle; And some soche bofettys he lente, That the hedd fro the body wente, As hyt were a balle. Whan hys swyrde was ybrokyn, A sarsyns legge hath he lokyn, Therwyth he can hym were. To the grounde he dud to go Sevyn skore, and somedele moo, That hethyn knyghtys were. The chylde made hym wey full gode To hys stede there he stode, Tho myght hym no man dere. The chylde toke the ryght way To the cytÃ© of Parys as hyt lay, Thorowowt all the heere. The Crysten men were full blythe When they sye Florent come alyue: They wende he lorne had bene. When he come nye the cytÃ© Agenste hym rode kyngys thre, And the emperour rode them betwene. The folke presyd hym to see, Euery man cryed: âWhych ys he?â As they hym neuyr had sene. To the pales was he ladd, And tolde them how he was bestadd Amonge the Sarsyns kene. âLordyngys, loke Ã¾at ye ben yare To the batell for [to] fare, And redy for to ryde. Tomorne hyt muste nede be sene Whych ys hardy man and kene; We may no lenger byde.â The folke seyde they were blythe To wynde to the batell swythe, In herte ys noght to hyde. A ryche clothe on borde was spradde To make the chylde blythe and gladd, A kynge on aythur syde. On the morne when hyt was daylyght, The folke can them to batell dyght, All that wepyn myght welde. There men myght see many a knyght Wyth helmys and wyth hawberkys bryght, Wyth sperys and wyth schylde. Wyth trumpys and wyth moche pryde, Boldely owt of the borowe Ã¾ey ryde Into a brode fylde; The downe was bothe longe and brode There bothe partyes odur abode, And eyther on odur behelde. Marsabelle, the maydyn fre, Was broght the batell for to see To Mountmertrons ouyr Seyn. Florent hur sleue bare on hys spere, In the batell he wolde hyt were, And rode forthe yn the playne; For that men schulde see by than That he was that ylke man That had the gyaunt slayne; And also for the maydyn free, That sche schulde hys dede see; Therof sche was fayne. That whyle was moche sorowe yn fy?t When Ã¾e batell began to smyte Wyth many a greuys wounde. Fro Ã¾e morne, Ã¾at day was lyght, Tyll hyt was euyn derke nyght, Or eythur party wolde fownde. Florent can euyr among Ã¾em ryde And made Ã¾ere many a sore syde, That afore were softe and sownde. So moche people to dethe yode That the stedys dud wade yn blode That stremyd on the grounde. There men myght see helmys bare, Hedys Ã¾at full feyre ware, Lay to grounde lyght. The Crystyn party become so th[ynne] That Ã¾e fylde Ã¾ey my?t not wynne, All arewyd hyt kynge and knyght. Florent smote wyth herte gode, Thorow helme ynto Ã¾e hed hyt wode, So moche he was of myght. Thorow Godys grace, and Florent there, The Crysten men Ã¾e bettur were That day yn the fyght. The partyes were ydrawe away, And takyn was anodur day, That Ã¾e batell schulde bee. Florent rode toward Borough Larayn, Be the watur banke of Seyne, Moo auenturs for to see. The maydyn whyte as lylly flowre Lay yn a corner of hur towre, That was ferly feyre and free. Florent sche sye on fylde fare, Be the sleue that he bare Sche knewe that hyt was he. Then spekyth Ã¾e mayde wyth mylde mode To Olyuan, that be hur stode, And knewe hur preuytÃ©: âOlyuan, how were beste to do A worde Ã¾at y my?t speke hym to? Iwysse, then wele were me.â Sche seyde, âLady, we two Allone wyll be the reuer go, There as he may yow see. Yf he yow loue wyth herte gode, He wyll not let for the flode, For a full gode stede hath he.â Forthe went the maydyns two; Be the reuer syde can they goo, Themselfe allone that tyde. When Florent sawe Ã¾at swete wyght He sprange as fowle dothe yn flyght, No lenger wolde he byde. The stede was so wondur gode He bare the chylde ouyr the flode, Hymselfe well cowde ryde. Grete yoye hyt was to see Ã¾em meete Wyth clyppyng and wyth kyssyng swete, In herte ys not [to] hyde. âLady,â he seyde, âwell ys me A worde Ã¾at y may speke wyth the, So bryght Ã¾ou art of hewe; In all Ã¾ys worlde ys noon so fre, Why ne wyll ye crystenyd be And syth of herte be trewe?â Sche seyde, âYf Ã¾at ye myght me wynne, I wolde forsake all hethyn kynne As thogh y them neuyr knewe; And syth ye wolde me wedde to wyfe, I wolde leue yn Crysten lyfe, My yoye were euyr newe.â âLady,â he seyde, âwythowt fayle, How were beste yowre counsayle That y yow wynne myght?â âCertys, ye neuyr wynne me may But hyt were on that ylke day, That ye haue take to fyght; That ye wolde sende be the flode, Wyth men Ã¾at crafty were and gode, A schyppe Ã¾at well were dyght.

He ne stynt ne he ne blanne To Clementys hows tyll Ã¾at he came, Hys auenturs to say. He tolde hym of the noble stede That gode was at euery nede, And of that feyre maye. âSone,â seyde Clement, âbe doghty of dede, And certys Ã¾ou schalt haue Ã¾at stede To-morne, yf that y may.â On the morne, when hyt was dayly?t, Clement can hymselfe dyght As an onfrely feere; He dud hym ynto Ã¾e hethen ooste There Ã¾e prees was althermoost, A Sarsyn as thogh he were. To the pauylown he can hym wynne There Ã¾e sowdon hymselfe lay ynne, And breuely can he bere; Full well he cowde Ã¾er speche speke, And askyd Ã¾em some of ther mete; The sowdon can hym here. Grete dole Ã¾e sowdon of hym Ã¾oght, And soon he was before hym broght, And wyth hym can he speke. He seyde he was a Sarsyn stronge That yn hys oost had be longe, And had defawte of mete. âLorde, Ã¾er ys noon hethyn lede That so well cowde kepe a ryche stede, Or othur horsys full grete.â The sowdon seyde Ã¾at ylke tyde: âYf Ã¾ou can a stede well ryde, Wyth me thou schalt be lete.â They horsyd Clement on a stede, He sprang owt as sperkull on gle[de] Into a feyre fylde. All that stodyn on ylke syde Had yoye to see hym ryde, Before the sowdon they tolde. When he had redyn coursys three, That all had yoye Ã¾at can hym see, The sowdon hym behelde. Downe he lyght full soon And on a bettur was he done; Full feyre he can hym welde. Grete yoye Ã¾e sowdon of hym Ã¾o?t, And bad hys feyre stede forÃ¾e be bro?t, And Clement shall hym ryde. When Clement was on Ã¾at stede He rode away a full gode spede: No lenger wolde he byde. When he was redy forÃ¾e to foun[de]: âBeleue Ã¾ere,â he seyde, âye heÃ¾en hou[nde], For ye haue lorne yowre pryd[e]!â Clement toke the ryght way Into Parys as hyt lay: Full blyÃ¾e was he that tyde. âFlorent, sone, where art thou? That y Ã¾e hyght y haue hyt n[ow]; I haue broght thy stede.â Florent blythe was that day And seyde: âFadur, yf y leue may, I wyll the quyte thy mede; But to the emperour of Rome Therwyth y wyll hym present sone; To Ã¾e pales ye schall hym lede. For euyr me thynkyth yn my mode That y am of hys own blode, Yf hyt so pouerly myght sprede.â To the pales the stede was ladde, And all Ã¾e kyngys were full gladd Theron for to see. The emperour before hym stode, Rauyschyd herte and blode, So wondur feyre was he. Then spekyth Ã¾e chylde of honour To hys lorde the emperour: âSyr, thys stede geue y the.â All that abowte Ã¾e chylde stode Seyde he was of gentull blode: Hyt myght noon odur be. Aftur thys the day was nomyn That Ã¾e batell on schulde comyn, Agenste the Sarsyns to fyght. Wyth trumpys and wyth moche pryde, Boldely owt of Ã¾e borogh Ã¾ey ryde, As men moche of myght. Florent thoght on the feyre maye, To batell wente he not that day, A schyppe he hath hym dyght; Fro Mountmertrons Ã¾ere Ã¾e lady lay To Parys he broght hur away, Ne wyste hyt kynge ne knyght. That whyle was moche sorowe yn fy?t, When Ã¾e batell began to smyght Wyth many a grymme gare; Fro morne Ã¾at hyt was daylyght Tyll hyt was euyn derke nyght, Wyth woundys wondur sore. Forwhy Ã¾at Florent was not Ã¾ere The hethyn men Ã¾e bettur were, The batell venquyscht Ã¾ey Ã¾ore; Or Florent to Ã¾e felde was comyn, Emperour and kynge were ynomyn And all that Crysten were. Florent was of herte so gode He rode Ã¾orow Ã¾em, he was wode, As wyght as he wolde wede. Ther was no Sarsyn so moche of mayn That my?t hym stonde wyth strenkyth agayn, Tyll they had slayne hys stede. Of Florent there was dele ynow, How Ã¾ey hys hors vndur hym slowe, And he to grounde yede. Florent was take yn that fyght; Bothe emperour, kynge and knyght, Woundyd they can them lede. The Sarsyns buskyd them wyth pryde Into ther own londys to ryde; They wolde no lenger dwelle. Takyn they had syr Florawns, The emperour and Ã¾e kyng of Fraunce, Wyth woundys wondur fele; Othur Crystyn kyngys moo, Dewkys, erlys and barons also, That arste were bolde and swelle; And ladd them wyth yron stronge, Hur fete vndur Ã¾e hors wombe: Grete dele hyt ys to telle. Wyde Ã¾e worde sprange of Ã¾ys chawnce, How the sowdon was yn Fraunce To warre agenste the ryght. In Jerusalem men can hyt here, How Ã¾e emperour of Rome was there Wyth many an hardy knyght. Than spekyth Octauyon Ã¾e ?yng Full feyre to hys lorde the kyng, As chylde of moche myght: âLorde, yf hyt were yowre wylle, I wolde wynde my fadur tylle And helpe hym yn that fyght.â Than spekyth Ã¾e kyng of moche my?t Full fayre vnto that yong knyght; Sore hys herte can blede: âSone, Ã¾ou schalt take my knyghtys fele, Of my londe that thou wylle wele, That styffe are on stede, Into Fraunce wyth the to ryde, Wyth hors and armys be thy syde, To helpe the at nede. When Ã¾ou some doghtynes haste done Then may Ã¾ou shewe Ã¾yn errande soone; The bettur may thou spede.â He bad hys modur make hur yare Into Fraunce wyth hym to fare: He wolde no lenger byde. Wyth hur she ladd the lyenas That sche bro?t owt of wyldurnes Rennyng be hur syde. There men myght see many a kny[ght], Wyth helmys and wyth hawberkys bryght, Forthe ynto the strete. Forthe they went on a day, The heÃ¾yn ooste on the way All they can them meete. By the baners that Ã¾ey bare They knewe Ã¾at Ã¾ey hethyn ware, And stylle they can abyde; They dy?t Ã¾em wyth bren[ye]s bryght And made Ã¾em redy for to fy?t, Ageyn Ã¾em can they ryde.

The lyenas Ã¾at was so wyght, When she sawe Ã¾e yong knyght Into the batell fownde, Sche folowed hym wyth all hur my?t And faste fellyd Ã¾e folke yn fy?t: Many sche made onsownde; Grete stedys downe sche drowe And many heÃ¾en men she slowe, Wythynne a lytull stownde. Thorow God Ã¾at ys of my?tys gode, The Crysten men Ã¾e bettur stode; The hethyn were bro?t to grownde. The Crysten prysoners were full fayne When Ã¾e Sarsyns were yslayne, And cryed: âLorde, thyn ore!â He ne stynt ne he ne blanne To Ã¾e prysoners tyll Ã¾at he wanne, To wete what they were. The emperour, wythowt lees, That hys own fadur was, Bowndon fownde he there; The kyng of Fraunce and odur moo, Dewkys, erlys and barons also, Were woundyd wondur sore. Hys fadur was the furste man That he of bondys to lowse began, Ye wete, wythowten lees; And he lowsyd hys brodur Floraunce Or he dud the kynge of Fraunce, ?yt he wyste not what he was. Be Ã¾at hys men were to hym comyn, Soon they were fro yrons nomyn, The pryncys prowde yn prees. Whan he had done Ã¾at noble dede, The bettur he oght for to spede, To make hys modur pees.

Syth came Octauyon Ã¾e yong wyth honour And knelyd before the emperour, Hys errande for to kythe; That ylke tale that he tolde, Ryche and pore, yong and olde, Glad they were to lythe.

Grete yoye Ã¾ere was also, The metyng of the brethurn two, That doghty were yn dede. A ryche feste Ã¾e emperour made Ã¾ere Of kyngys Ã¾at were farre and nere, Of many londys thede; The tale whoso redyth ryght, The feste lastyd a fourtenyght, In jeste as we rede. Marsabelle that feyre maye Was aftur sente, the sothe to say, Fro Parys there sche was. Crystenyd sche was on a Sonday, Wyth yoye and myrthe and moche play; Florent to wyfe hur chees. Soche a brydale Ã¾er was there A ryaller Ã¾er was neuyr noon here, Ye wot wythowten lees. Florent hymselfe can hur wedd And ynto Rome sche was ledd, Wyth pryncys prowde yn prees.
