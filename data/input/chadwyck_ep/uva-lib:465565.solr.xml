      <field name="fulltext">Act I. SONG [Oh! had a lover serv'd me so] Oh! had a lover serv'd me so, In spite of all his merit, I would be well reveng'd, and shew, Tho' I lov'd, I still had spirit. To make one a fool, A mere ninny, a tool, To flatter, to coax, and to swear, And then to deceive one, For a froward minx leave one, 'Tis more than a woman can bear! GLEE [Oh God of Love! our efforts aid] Oh God of Love! our efforts aid; Protect a fond believing maid: The pangs she has endur'd redress, And crown our efforts with success! SONG [Tho' I ne'er serv'd apprenticeship, I'm up to all you choose] I Tho' I ne'er serv'd apprenticeship, I'm up to all you choose, Can mow your beard, and brush your clothes, and clean your Honor's shoes. I can tie on your cloak, Sir, so neatly, Roll up your cravat, Sir, so sweetly, Friz your hair, Call a chair, Errands run, Scare a dun, No one better Slips a letter Neat in hand, When you command. Whether alone, or in a mob, oh! Pedrillo now, now Pedro Lobo. Night and day, Always gay, Singing fal lal la! II Like Proteus I can take all shapes, and be whate'er I will, Cook, butler, steward, valet, groom, bum-bailiff, alguazil. To serve you I've now turn'd a doctor, Of medicine a self-dubb'd concoctor; Here and there, Every where, In and out, Round about, Slow or quick, Well or sick, Patient see, Take a fee; In every tune I bear a bob,—oh! Pedrillo now, now Pedro Lobo. Night and day, Always gay, Singing fal lal la! SONG [Love like an April day beguiles] I Love like an April day beguiles, Each moment brings new changes; From cold to heat, from frowns to smiles, Capriciously he ranges. II Now he allures to mirth and joy, And points to scenes of pleasure; But, ere we reach them, the false boy Bears off the promis'd treasure. DUET [When ambition and wealth their allurements unite] Ramirez. When ambition and wealth their allurements unite, What heart can resist their attractive impression? Alonzo. When love and the beauties of Laura invite, Not a moment's delay should impede the possession. Ramirez. Riches, honor, rank, and pow'r— Alonzo. Joy increasing ev'ry hour— Ramirez. Moidores, ducatoons, pistoles— Alonzo. Sympathy of feeling souls— Both. All that fancy can supply— Pleasure, transport, extacy! END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. SONG [Stand aside, Sir, I pray—] Stand aside, Sir, I pray— Let your wife, Sir, have her way, What d'you mean by thus interposing? I hope, Sir, I can tell My own story straight and well, If his Worship will vouchsafe me a hearing. I'm his wife—in a word, I'm his second wife, my Lord, As you'd guess by my shape and each feature; If you look, you'll find it clear, I'm too young, by many a year, To be mother of that maypole creature. SONG [When a man is fatigu'd with the toils of the day] I When a man is fatigu'd with the toils of the day, No med'cine like sherries can drive care away; Without it, his blood will grow thicker and thicker; But his pulses flow brisk when refresh'd with good liquor. II Give water to those who, like water, are cold; 'Tis wine, generous wine, that can make my heart bold. I leave to your sneakers potations so weak, And stick to old sherries, that crimsons my cheek. TRIO [Thanks, Master Sancho, I'm your servant.] Guzman. Thanks, Master Sancho, I'm your servant. Our bargain's made, so here's my hand. Bertran &amp; Beatrice. Of all you say she'll prove observant, Obedient still to your command. Beatrice. Of her duty I've given her a sample; Before her she has my example. In her conduct you'll ne'er find a flaw, If she copy her mother-in law. Bertran. Will you ever thus be prating? Always your perfections stating? Can't you bridle up your tongue? Must your larum still be rung?— My Lord, our thanks we must express— Beatrice May Heav'n your noble Lordship bless— Guzman. I've more to do than you can guess— Beatrice &amp; Bertran. Our thanks how can we ever tell? Guzman. I wish you both good day—farewell! SONG [Ah! how, when assur'd of her faith and love] I Ah! how, when assur'd of her faith and love, Could I forfeit the prize, and with happiness part? How could I inconstant to tenderness prove, And for visions of splendour relinquish her heart? But all love is folly! II Like the Shepherd, who rashly abandon'd his flock To tempt on the billows of ocean his fate, On shoals tempest-driven, or bilg'd on a rock, I shall sink and acknowledge my folly too late. For all love is folly! SONG [Alas! could fond woman but know] I Alas! could fond woman but know What anguish love brings in his train, She would fly from the treacherous foe, And render his stratagems vain. II While we hail him a seraph divine, While our bosoms with rapture beat high, His toils round our senses entwine, And leave us to languish and sigh. III Oh trust not to flattering man, Of his specious delusions beware; Escape from his arts while you can, You are ruin'd if caught in his snare. DUET [But if your father knew, my dear] Clara. But if your father knew, my dear, That I presum'd to interfere— Laura. Don't be afraid of that—I'm young, But I have learn'd to hold my tongue. Clara. There's no resisting you—now mark— I'll teach you how to use your spark. When with your father first you meet him, Take care you with politeness treat him. Laura. That's easy. Clara. Should he rant or vow, You only need to curtsey—so— Laura. Dear, how amusing!— Clara. If he sigh,— Remember to avert your eye. Laura. I warrant me—Is this the way? Clara. And with your fan or rosary play. Should he presume to touch your hand, Can you a ready blush command? Laura. I cannot tell—If that's denied, At all events my face I'd hide. I knew the whole of this before— Clara. Then I've no need to tell you more. Both. Tho' man may pursue us to make us his prey, To escape him kind nature has taught us the way; Be he e'er so instructed to snare female hearts, If we're true to ourselves we may 'scape all his arts. SONG [Ods life, I am all in a flurry] I Ods life, I am all in a flurry, My spirits rush on in a hurry, I feel it in vain My impatience to rein, Whilst my pulses thus beat hurry scurry. II Could I drop but a trifle of years— But why should I have any fears? Some at twenty are old, Some at sixty are bold, So look to yourselves, pretty dears. SONG [I'm as sightly a fellow to look to] I I'm as sightly a fellow to look to, And as likely her favor to gain— If an old woman wishes to hook to, She'll not find my equal in Spain. I can ogle and sigh, Smile, flatter, and lie, Squeeze her hand with such feeling expression, That if her heart, tho' tough, Be of penetrable stuff, Soon or late I may make an impression. I've got the trick, The knack, the nick, Of pleasing all the ladies! II I've a mind just to try the sweet creature— Who knows what return I may find? Tho' like Gorgon's may prove every feature, Who cares, if her purse is well lin'd. If a hump's on her back, Or an eye she may lack, 'Tis no matter if riches she rolls in, And her wizen'd wrinkled face I'd allow no nose to grace, If in plenty she brings me pistoles in. I've got the trick, &amp;c. &amp;c. QUARTETTO. [I'm ready, be it what it will.] Pedrillo. I'm ready, be it what it will. Beatrice. Oh there's no doubt, Sir, of your skill. If you are what your features tell, You'll play the rogue extremely well. Pedrillo. To guess from those black eyes, I swear There's no mistaking what you are. Both. Between us let a truce be made; We're both joint sharers in the trade. Clara. That's well—But we our moments waste, Away! our project calls for haste. Bertran. Time by the forelock we must seize; We're ready for whate'er you please. Clara and Beatrice The clouds which threaten'd us, shall soon Vanish before the blaze of noon: Omnes. Again the Sun shall gild the day, And cheer us with his glad'ning ray. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. SONG [Suspense (of bliss the direst foe)] I Suspense (of bliss the direst foe) No more my peace annoy; Let me at once my misery know, Or let me taste of joy, With lovely woman. II When fancy exulting, paints new scenes of pleasure, And bids us to transport give way; While smiling she beckons us on to our treasure, How cruel to suffer delay! Suspense, &amp;c. SONG [To decide on the merits of wine in a cask] To decide on the merits of wine in a cask, From what vintage it comes, is the first thing we ask: When that's ascertain'd, and its character known, We purchase it boldly, and make it our own. The sportsman who wants a good horse for the chase, With careful attention examines its race; If the pedigree's clear, and its character high, Whatever the price, he ne'er scruples to buy. TRIO [Ha! ha! ha! ha! There's no containing—] Beatrice. Ha! ha! ha! ha! There's no containing— From laughter there is no refraining. Bertran. How the bait the gudgeon swallow'd; How the wise assembly follow'd! Beatrice. I my story told so gravely— Bertran. I the not'ry play'd so bravely— Beatrice. Crying, lying, stating, rating— Bertran. Bouncing, flouncing, daring, swearing— Both. Oh! 'twas sport beyond all bearing! Clara. You both were quite perfect—the work was well done— Now mark, our catastrophe soon will come on. Hasten home, and make ready—I soon shall be there— You'd better make off while the coast remains clear. Bertran. Mind your behaviour now—apply Your handkerchief to either eye. Beatrice. Slouch your hat formally, and bear Yourself with a true not'ry's air. Omnes. If we succeed the day's our own. Sweet is the prize that's hardly won. FINALE. (Horn). [We all now are friends, so have done with your funning—] We all now are friends, so have done with your funning— We have prov'd, 'tis acknowledg'd, no match for your cunning. Come then,—what is past let's forget and forgive: To please and be pleas'd be henceforward our task; For the favour of those, by whose favour we live, Is all we aspire to, and all we can ask. FINIS.</field>
