      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. A REVERIE. I Strange fancies will at times molest, Awake or when asleep;â And did I dream a dream last night, Or did I think to weep? II Methought the green and grassy earth Was as a mortcloth black; And all the sable skies above Were streak'd with flaming wrack. III The sun shone like a coffin plate, That tells who sleeps below; The stars were all as silver nails That glitter in a row. IV The trees, in that unrighteous scene, Were as the hearse-plumes dread; The streams ran inkâtheir falls were mute, And all the world was dead. V Then one by one the lights were quench'd And ancient night was come: Lone silence settled dark o'er all, And sound itself grew dumb. VI The glimmering phantoms of the past Seem'd things that were to be; But like the stars, my thoughts went out, And light was gloom to me. VII The steadfast earth, beneath my tread Dissolving, passed away; And through the vague, the void, and vast, I wander'd wild astray. VIII Time wasâa point dimensionless, Existence ceas'dâa sigh; In all the boundless space around There was but God and I. INFINITE. I What thoughts do Infinite convey! What import does the term express! The shall be and the past away, A greater than the greatest, say, Or than the least, still less. II Nor flying hours, nor measur'd space, The pregnant mystic word concerns; Nor distance in man's life or place, Nor aught that lore or light discerns. III The goal, perfection only nearsâ Creation's work that's never done,â The strength of power, the stream of years, The rimless round, the chain of spheres, God's frame, the viewless One. IV These hint the secret, and from these Wing'd contemplation dares to soar; And through the stellar chinks she sees What sages dream and saints adore. V With eyes amaz'd she thence reviews, Dread Nature's vast mysterious plan, And wondering tells the awful muse, What suns beyond their beams effuse To worlds unknown to man. THE RADICALS. A FABLE. Philo the sage, threw by his book, On his companions once to look;â A cat and dog, in slumber snug, Stretch'd out before the fire on rug, Pleased to behold their mutual ease. âAh! man,â he cried, âwert thou like these, How smooth would flow life's varied stream, Cleared from its lees and brighter gleam. Here creatures of an adverse kind Sleep as if fus'd into one mind. Oh Nature! goddess of good will, Thy blandishments enchant us still, And woo us to forget the cause That makes us what we areâthe laws. Lo! these poor beasts, that own no code, But instinct onlyâlaws of God. No cares, no crimes, no frauds they know, Life is with them a limpid flow. Would man, from their example, learn Thy holy instincts to discern; And banish from their use and wont Enacted laws, and lawyers' cant; Live free,âby Nature charter'd free, And burn the codes of anarchy!â As thus he said, bright from the grate A sparkling ember leapt elate, And with tormenting anguish bit Grimalkin, in her drowsy fit.â Roused by the pain, with claws and teeth She made poor Sprig partake her grief. He, honest dog, with sudden snarl, Provoked with her a deadly quarrel; Till friend Philo, with tongs to fell 'em, Restored the status ante bellum. MORAL. 'Tis thus the radicals imagine, While basking underneath the laws, That all the troubles men engage in, Spring wantonly from teeth and claws. SPRING. SUGGESTED BY THE FOURTH ODE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE. I Wha's yon braw lass, wi' gowan snood, That's walking o'er the broomy knowe; She dings the cranreuch frae the wood, And plaits a garland round the bough? Her e'en, twa dew-drops, sparkling clear, Shed love and daffin' as they glance; The birds wi' canty liltings cheer, And a' the flow'rs rise frae their trance? It's bride-maid Spring, whose leilsome art Gars lightly loup the youthful heart. II Thrang frae the misty highland isles, Whar ghaists in flocks glowr as they flee, And Brownic for the Lathron toils, Wi' barkened Dyed with bark. sails the kowters seeâ By heaps o' timber caps, and plates, The wark that wile't the winter's drear, Right snod the kintra carlin waits, And wearies wha the price will speer. For a' the lads are on the rig, And she maun thole the snash and prig. III The clachan lucky spreads fu' proud Her webs and spyniels on the green; And signs and window cheeks renew'd, Like the young leaves shine fresh and clean, But lo! best proof that winter's done, Auld grannie frae the chumley nook Late toddling in the afternoon To kirk, wi' napkin round her book. In love, or life, or growth, or sense, All feel the genial influence. IV Come then, dear Jamie, while we may The vernal hours of youth enjoy: The hope that blooms so fair and gay, A worm may gnaw, a blast destroy. But o'er the past, as Horace sings, Not e'en almighty Jove has power, And mem'ry still delighted brings The vision of the happy hour; That man in joyless age may bear The wumbling pain, and snuling care. THE PENNY WEDDING; Jean's Account of the Infare. INSCRIBED TO DAVID WILKIE, ESQ., R.A. No bade! I'm sure 'twas a forget, For a' the town was there;â The whole clan-jamphery far and near, Like as at kirk or fair. We had, it's true, the minister, I wat he was jocose, And twa-three decent families Wi' some of the town beaux. Lod, lass, d'ye ken the hempy set Frae a' the laive me wal't, And that wild swankie Laird Kailyards W's blethering ne'er devaul't. The clarty Terrier wee Tam Sneak Brought punch and sweeties gabbing, And bow't an' binge't and winkit droll, Just like a pyet dabbing. Its wonderfu' how some folks fen' Meg Glaik she kens hersel, But no a leddy in the town Frae Meg can bear the bell. Her tucker was of Brussels' lace, An ell o't gude an' mair, Nae mutch had she, but a snood of beads Was purl'd in her hair. When she saw young Kailyards wi' me, She could na' thole the sight, But gluncht till Sneakie took her up Syne wallop't hyte a' night. The bride was braw, but a' the east Wad ne'er mak Tibby snod: A' hachle's like a clubby clute, Made by the hand of God. The bridegroom ilka body kens Has needed lang a wife, The doitet cuif fell winking fou' And bred us mickle strife. The live lang supper-time he fash'd And yamert just a pest, And then his eyne began to set, And he maun gang to's rest. This hav'rel word ye weel may think Bred mickle sport awhile, It kittl't e'en the minister And gar't the mimmest smile. Wee Sneakie crept aneath the bed, A taed beneath a stane;â I saw him and tauld Laird Kailyards, And he to hear 't was fain. Sae when we a'were round the stance For posset and the scone, The Laird took crabbit Mrs. Spice To play his prank upon. Her pouch he clippet frae her side, And flung't aneath the bed, Syne sought a prin wi courtesie Prejinct and so well bred. She put her hand to fetch his want, But O! the pouch was gone,â Her eyne flew up, her mouth fell down, Her soul it gied a groan. Just then wee Sneakie look'd frae's den Whase pouch is this? he cries,â The pouch was cramm'd wi' crumbs and scraps, And tappy towers of pies. She knevel't at his face a clink, He claught her by the leg,â She staggartâand red wud wi' wrath, Dure gruppet randy Meg. Meg skreigh'd like ane clean by hersel, To end the deaving din, The bridegroom in a rapture raise, And spare't na kith nor kin. Out at the door he drove us a', Like nowt in a fair fray, And Laird Kailyards went hame wi' me, And we laugh't a' the way. THE BLOCKADE. I Though o'er St. George's, black and dread, The flag of winter wave, And on the leeward dangers spread, Shall terror shake the brave? II Loud let the winds careering sweep, Our good ship scorns their pride; For on the dark and dismal deep, But Duty knows to guide. III Look up! another rending mast! True seamen, never fret; It shortens sail; the rising blast Will save us sail to set. IV The bowsprit goes! the rudder's gone! They both were useless here: The shallow where the beacon shone Is past,âthe harbour's near. V We strikeâshe sinksâwho would provoke Stern Fate in bloody wars? A parting cheer, my hearts of oak! For England and her tars. EPIGRAM. WRITTEN IN 1805 OR 6. Proud to behold the recompense to fame My country gave, to Blenheim tow'rs I came. The trophied portal, and the storied halls, With the great âcampaignâ glowing on the walls, Bright thoughts excited and high aims inspired.â But while the Marlborough all my fancy fired, A liveried keeper, with obsequious bow, Claim'd the admission price, and shut the show. HYMN. O thou, who through the infinite abyss Of darkness void, like yon ascending sun From out his nightly chamber, rose serene. As thy creative radiance spread around, Millions of angels, stars of the first morn, Then sparkled into being: but their light, In thy effulgent coming, soon was lost: And Thou, Thyself, Thee manifest alone, With glory fill'd the universal round. Time was not yet, nor that beginning, when Thou didst th' apostate seraphim cast out, And in the tempest of thy justice, hurl'd Chaos upon them, till the accumulated wrath O'er-vaulting, closed their cryptical abyss. In Heaven they date the primal evening then. O! who shall tell thy glory, when again Thou didst look forth, benignant, from the sky Upon the shoreless dark, upheaving vast Of all the elements; and didst command Yon ruling orb, the pale attendant moon, And their fair kindred lights out of the deep To rise.âThey rose like birds from off the waves. Thy brighter morning stars, the witnesses, Shouted with joy, to see their circling flight, Sung as they saw their circling flight begin. And the dim patens of material light, Left for thy glory to supply the world, Crown'd the blest evening of the second day. On thy third dawn, waked from his earthy bed, Majestic man, to do thee homage, rose; And when he fell from his primeval state Thy countenance was darkened, and o'er all Afflicted nature spread a dismal night; Till thou wast pleased in Jesus yet once more To shew forth visible, and, in his form, Come with the radiance of another day.â Dread was the hour, when, in the carnal cloud, Thou wast eclipsed. Then all the world was gloom. On bloody Calvary's atrocious hill Perdition howl'd with joy, deeming that night Eternal; when behold! bright from the depths Of darkest death, to which thou didst descend, The choirs of Heaven, that rested mute the while, Saw thee arise, and hail'd the glorious morn. But in the awful cycles of thy course, Cloud, hail, and darkness, fearful to thy saints, Obscure thee from them and afflict their faith.â O now, when Thou, true light, hast set again, When will thy sixth refulgent morning come? When will thy sabbath shine on all things good? MORNING. A CANTICLE. Oh come, ye daughters of Jerusalem! Come with your timbrels and your songs of joy, To hail the sparkling-footed morn, that brings Her flagons, 'plenish'd from the wells of light,â From hills of myrrh and Carmel's fragrant brow. Come while she comes, kindling the dewdrop stars. The fear, the shadow, and the snare are goneâ The blossoms smileâand with glad faces now The lilies shine.âHark! from the hills afar Melodious bleat the lamb; while o'er the stream The hart looks pleas'd towards yon far-seen rock, Where the blithe shepherd in the sunshine sings, âAwake, my loveâmy fair oneâcome away!â THE SIDDONIAN CURSE. May he survive the worldâforgot of God! And in the infinite, where all things were, Blaspheme alone for ever and for ever! THE MISANTHROPE. The conscious Misanthrope! I first beheld him When in my pilgrimage I paced forlorn The shipless shores and lone funereal wastes, Where mould'ring lies the skeleton of Greece. It chanced one evening, from the hovering skies, I sought the leaside of an ancient temple, Whose old magnificence was crush'd and scatter'd. The storm had blown the beacon from the mole, And wrecks and seamen's corses strew'd the shore. Along the sounding strand, with helpless wail, Wringing their hands, their hair dishevell'd flying, The wretched women echo'd to the cries Of drowning men beyond the reach of aid. The bells rung wildly, and the monks with torches, Mingling their requiems with the booming winds, Brought down their sacred relics to the sea, That would not be appeased, but louder raged, As if in mockery of their awful faith; So wildly did the demons of the air Rule in that dismal night. For refuge I Crept to the vaults beneath the gorgeous ruin. There I beheld him, leaning o'er a fire Which he had kindled with the wave-bleach'd splinters Of founder'd barks, and bones that seemed of men. The lurid flames that flared in his grim eyes Show'd he was rapt in stern imaginings. His garb and mien proclaimed he was a soldier; But the proud plume upon his cap was faded. I would have marred his musing, but he broke Into such frenzied blasphemy of man, For hideous outrage done against himself, That I fled shudd'ring to the storm for shelter. THE CRUSADERS' MARCH. No trumpet's clangour cheer'd their toilsome march; Nor spirit-stirring fifeânor the bold peal Of the courageous drum was ever heard. Butâmore inspiring than the mingled voice Of all accorded instruments of soundâ They moved exulting to triumphant songs Of ancient Israel to battle led, And led victorious by the Lord of Hosts, Through seasâo'er deserts wasteâand impious kings. THE FIELD OF BATTLE. What though no more was heard the clash of armsâ The thund'ring squadronânor the victor's shout, Mingled with curses hoarse and mutter'd rageâ Still dismal rose the wonted sounds of war. Like the deep death-bell in some mourning town Where Pestilence careers, there loudly boom'd The long-drawn anguish of the wounded charger. And o'er the field, like prowling fiends, red lights Were wand'ring seen; where'er they stopp'd, a shriek Broke wildly sharp from some despairing wretch, Struck, as he welter'd, by the plunderer's knife. At morn, the soldier from his comrade's corpse Startles the camp dog; and the wounded oft, To scare the foul birds hov'ring o'er them, lift Their shatter'd limbs and roll their gashy heads. And there the sun, remorseless on his throne, Brings clouds of carnage-flies, that fill the air With shadowy gloomâa living shower of sound. THE CORONATION. I From steeple, spire, and abbey tow'r, The bells are ringing gay;â The cannon proud were shouting loud Before the dawn of day. II With golden prows and banners bright, The gallant galleys go; And thousands on ten thousand drive To see the regal show. III The chimneys all are wreath'd with boys, Like apple trees in spring; And ladies' bowers with smiles and flowers Are garnish'd for the King. IV To trumpets shrill and bugles brave, Loud peal the thund'ring drums;â Lift up your heads, ye feudal halls,â The Lord's anointed comes! THE DESTRUCTION OF OLD DUNWICH. I The livelong day, the frantic blast Howls in the dismal sky,â Sea-wrecks upon the coast are cast, The raging waves run high. II The bark from the resounding shore Steers far aloof to sea, The seaman's wife has closed the door, And bends in prayer her knee. III From drifting clouds the round red sun Beholds the coming night, Men think of sinful courses run, And churme the dirge of light. IV Dark falls a gloom on town and tower, At midnight as at noon, The birds unblest scream in the show'r, Their eyrie is no boon. V Why does the foul receding tide So haste beyond its bourne? The priests before the altar cry, When will the tide return? VI It comes! It comes, the waters come, Ten thousand voices cry; The storm is stay'd, God's thunder drum No more alarms on high. VII Oh flash of hope,âwith fiercer breath, Hors'd on the white maned wave, The shrieking wind is lash'd by Death, And Heaven forbears to save. VIII With hurrying bound the ocean wild Leaps o'er the shudd'ring walls, The beacon staggers like a child, The time-tried abbey falls. IX Like hungry flames, the wasteful waves Along the streets career; The weltering crowd a moment raves,â And Dunwich once was here. THE WIDOW'S CROONE. I And maun I lanely spin the tow, And ca' the weary wheel, For cauld they lie,âwhere do they lie, The winsome and the leil? II Och hon! Och hon! my blithe gudeman Lies deep aneath the wave, The Lord that made us frae the dust, I thought had power to save. III My Willie!âhe lay on my breast Wi' mercy in his e'en,â Can I forget the bonnie bairn That milket me yestreen? IV Cauld was the coal I had to blaw When Robin sank at sea, For he but left the widow's hope, A wee, wee bairn wi' me! V Wi' eydent hand and eye o'woe, I ettled night and day; And when the Lord forgot our need We grat, and tried to pray. VI Och hon! Och hon! he is awa, My Willie he is gone; Oh, is he waff in some far land? But God's good will be done. VII May be he's in the morning star, That glints its sheen sae clear, The Lord be praised,âhe'll never ken His helpless mother's fear. VIII I'm auld and frail, my basin's toom An almous I maun quest,â Help me, sweet Death! to the kirkyard, That holy place of rest! A SONG. [The youth that leaves his native land] The youth that leaves his native land, And feels his heart reluctant swell, As friendship waves the parted hand, And fond affection looks farewell,â May know the painful grief I knew When England faded from my view. But when fair Adelaide I saw, Full quickly pass'd that youthful pain, My heart received a happier law, For friends and home were found again. But in her absence I deplore Love, friendship, and my native shore. A SONG. [What can't be help'dâcan't] I What can't be help'dâcan't, So 'tis nonsense to grieve, We wish what we want, Can wishes relieve? II The bottle, poor soul! As it stands by the glass, Looks up in your face As wishing to pass. III The glass, my dear friend, With his round open mouth, Is wanting his drink, Ah! pity his drouth. IV So wishes and wants, Jolly lads! let us pass, For the wish of the bottle, And want of the glass. THE SONG OF THE SAINT. Bright on the mountain's browâas on his throne, Some orient king in regal splendour sits, Exhaling adulationsâshines the sun, And bower, and bough, and vale, and mountain top, Ring with the chorus of all living things. The streams run glad, the silent lakes lie pleas'd, While woody steeps, green banks, and thymy knolls, Bask in fresh happiness, and the grim rocks Relax their frowns, and smile with sullen joyâ In that blest hour the saint thus sung his song.â âThou glorious orb, in whose effulgence all Earth grows melodious, and awak'ning life, Kindles to rapture at thy bright return; In thee, dim type foredoom'd, the mental eye Sees but the shadow of that light eterne, Whose holy influence caus'd the world to be. Vision of glory, emblem of the God Whose ray refines the drossy heart of man, Till it forgoes its natural alloy, And glows sublimed, fit ore to mix with heav'ns, Speak to my heart! May He who bade thee shine, Who strews with stars, as dust, His path on high, Shed there his purity, and there the base Change and exalt by some divine conversion, Oh, as thy splendour banishes the night, Dissolve the gloom of my distrustful dream, And guide my spirit to ascend again.â EPIGRAMS. I. To a Young Lady who said she loved Bath Cheese. How charming, lovely, mild, and fair, Is Julia's form and heav'nly air! Soft as the gentle dew of night, Descend her accents of delight. Pure as the morning radiance beams, Her mind angelic fancy gleams. Oh! graced with every power to pleaseâ Why loves divinest Juliaâcheese? II. On hearing it said a Good Man was praised too much.

III. On returning a Manuscript. Your language, Sir, is quite correct; The verse too, is without defect; The rhymes are choice, and, no offence, In term or thought, obscures the sense. In short, the work no fault affords, Yet, Sir, excuse meâ'tis but words. WERTER TO CHARLOTTE. Oh need'st thou wonder at my sighs; Look not so kindly on me; In mercy veil these gentle eyes, Alas! they have undone me. Or if thou wilt I should be gay, Instruct me to forget thee; Or be as free as on that day, Alas! when first I met thee. THE HERMIT PETER. BOOK I. The Hermit Peter left his lonely cell, On the green margin of the western sea, And to Jerusalem, with patient steps, Through many a land and hostile regions drear, Meekly inquir'd his solitary way.â At length he saw, fronting the setting sun, Tall glittering spires, tipp'd with refulgent stars, And cliffs high turretted, throwing their shadows Black o'er the shaggy vales. âIt is the town, The sacred town, the city of the Lord, The home of prophets, and the tomb of God!â Thick beat his bosom: rushing to his eyes A holy rapture came in floods of tears. He could not standâhe knelt and could not pray. With hand on hand press'd to his leaping heart, Awhile to stay this ecstasy he strove; But swifter whirling, still intenser glow'd The passion of that hour, till from the earth, With arms extended towards Calvary, Lifted in transports he exulting sprung, And fell in throbbing trances to the ground. Ere the rapt fervour of his soul abated, The solemn moon, with all her handmaid stars, Like a fair priestess and her virgin train Of beauteous torch-bearers, was thron'd serene High in the blue mid heaven; and peaceful Night In silence wav'd her dreamy sceptre o'er The mountains and the vales, save where was heard Soft-murmuring Siloah's quick-glancing wave, Or where afar the lamb's pathetic bleat, Rous'd in the distant fold the watchful dog, Or startling voices and the hast'ning feet Of travellers late, rose at long intervals, No sound mov'd o'er the sleeping landscape then. The Hermit shar'd the universal calm, And rais'd his eyes in tranquil holiness, To thank the heavens that his long pilgrimage Was now so near completionâwhen behold Around he saw a venerable band Looking dejected on him, as he lay Prostrate beside the path. The chief advanc'd, A pensive elder. Down his sable vest, In silv'ry whiteness deep, the beard of years Flow'd in the moonshine, like the hoary fall Of mountain-waters o'er a shadowed rock. âBy the blest name of Him who died for all, Who and what art thou?â cried the Hermit, mov'd With reverent horror, as the honour'd stranger Stoop'd to assist his rising. âFear not, pilgrim, We are thy brethren, blest by baptism,â thus The Patriarch replied; âwho late detain'd, Soothing the flight of a departing soul, Were homeward hast'ning to Jerusalem, When we discovered thee upon the ground; And sadly deeming that thou hadst been slain By some of those remorseless infidels Who have, alas! possess'd the hallow'd seats Of God's own people, paus'd to mourn that now, The pilgrim, after many a danger past, Should, frustrate of his pardon, die unblest. Oft at the entrance of the sepulchre, That sacred sepulchre where Jesus lay, We find the Christian a polluted corpse.â O dread Jehovah! whose avenging wrath Drove charioted in thunder and in hail, Aiding the sword of Joshua, when the sun Stood still on Gibeon, and no priestess serv'd That day the fabling worship of the moon In all the vale of Ajalonâhow long Shall these oppressors, with their iron sway, Afflict thy people? When wilt thou command Thy dreadful angel to descend again On yonder mountain, and with withering frown Scorch their fell power, as in that dismal night, When on the host of fierce Sennacherib He look'd in anger, and the host was dead?â So spake the Patriarch: and the Hermit cried, âThe sun is quench'd not, though to us awhile His glory seem extinguish'd; nor the power Of righteous Jehovah slumb'ring rests, Though the proud infidel triumphant rides The mount of God, and Calvary's holier hill. No: now, even now, the ever active Spring Throughout the universe elastic stirs, To urge a great deliverance.ââSurpris'd, As if some high miraculous agent spoke, The Patriarch and his attendant priests, Awe-struck, recoil'd. The Hermit's abject mien, Sunk eyes, and visage wan, moving their pity, As they look'd on him in the moon's pale light, Seem'd suddenly, by heavenly ardour chang'd Like radiant panoply. Brighter than stars, His kindling orbs beam'd keen intelligence; His countenance was lighten'd, and a glow Of sacred energy appear'd to shine From all his wondrous and dilating form, In majesty heroic. When he paus'd, The Patriarch reverently, low-bending, saidâ âThere is no hope of help: From these lost lands The manly spirit is for ever fled, The term of glorious enterprise is done, And all those great ennobling purposes That rais'd the weak and perishable man Out of his nature to immortal heights, Are utterly unknown. We are as ghosts, Tenants of ruins, and our home the grave; Nor when we pray, implore we Heaven to aid.â âBut Heaven will aid,â the impetuous Hermit cried. âThinkst thou that He who did of old but speak Within the hollow of the empty gloom, And heaven, and earth, and light, and man arose, Cannot from out this death of virtue wake A living courage, to redeem the land From the abhorr'd blasphemers? In His name I will invoke the warriors of the west To arm in this great cause, and they will come,â Shall come, obedient to the high command, Like hail and tempest raging from the north, And hence th' accurs'd like chaff and ashes drive. Three hundred weary days, three hundred nights, In patient pilgrimage, searching my way To these blest scenes, have I, a penitent, To drop my tears in Jesus' hallow'd tomb Come undismay'd; a few short steps, and I May reach the sepulchre, and with these eyes Witness the spot, where, for the sins of men A bleeding sacrifice, slain by the hands Of those he came to save, once lay the dread, The innocent, the everlasting God, Wrapt in corrupt mortality; but back In glorious mission I will straight return; Nor shall my feet pass the polluted gates Of yon bright town, that on its mountain throne, Shines like a constellation, till the west Pour her heroic blood, and wash them clean.â Mourn not, Jerusalem, though captive chains Hang on thy neck, and bend in sorrow low That lofty head which Heaven with halo crown'd, And made the holiest of all the earth, The day of thy deliverance is at hand.â He ceas'd, and all stood silent; every heart Was fill'd with wonder, every eye with tears Glittering was turn'd towards the starry east, And every voice in sympathy attuned, Together swelling sung the praise of God. So sweet and sacredly their hymn arose, That the stern guards, upon the distant walls, Stood listening as the sound, through the still air, Came to the ear like fragrance on the gale. When they had thus with prayer and psalm awhile Express'd their fervid confidence in Heaven, The weary hermit closed his eyes in sleep. Beside him humbly sat the Patriarch down, While to the neighbouring cottages around In quest of food to cheer their pious guest, His train dispersed themselves. Long wide and far The search was spread; but for the needful meal The mourning peasant had but tales to tell Of ravage, rape, and horrors worse than death.â And grieving, without alms, they all returned. Before the dawn the Hermit wak'd refresh'd, And ask'd to eat, for he had fasted long. Silent to his request the priests remain'd; And when he crav'd again, their falt'ring voice, With tears, and broken sentences, declar'd The dismal issue of their fruitless range. He heard themâlook'd at them; fast from his eyes The rain of speechless anguish bursting, fell, And the dim light of the ascending morn, Show'd pale and ghastly in his eager gaze, What sorrow stung his heart.âHe started up And fled without reply.âTh' afflicted priests Call'd on him to remainâbut still he ran, Fanning behind with spread averting hand, Like Lot from doom'd Gomorrah. When the sun Rose glowing bright, and on his shoulders shed Th' enfeebling lustre of the eastern clime, His earnest spirit then began to yield, And nature, by its vigour, so sustained Sinking down, stretch'd him on the parching earth. He had not long thus miserable lain, When the light tinkling of innumerous bells Rose from a distance. At the sound he rais'd His head, and saw descending from the hill A caravan of camels. They were bound To Jaffa, laden with that precious freight Of gorgeous tribute which the wealthy East Pays to th' adventurous genius of the West. Ships of the desert! many a tedious league O'er burning sands, beneath a brazen sun, That ever cloudless fires the thirsting air, Their toilsome course from Bussorah was held. As they approached, the parching Hermit paid The homage of a thankful heart to Heaven, Whose Providence by seeming chances sends Restoring succour when all mortal aid Deserts the reason and the hope of man:â He in the travellers, saw well-tim'd relief; And view'd contented their slow-paced advance And cushion-footed camels, on whose backs Of basket leanness, gaily looking forth The young, the infant, and the lamb, were piled In pannier and in cage, and rattling, rung The clustered culinary ware, as down The step abrupt, with surging steps they came. Nor was relief denied: with kindly churme, For so their unknown speech seemed to his ear, The mild and solemn Asiatics shared Their freshest melons, and their coolest gourds; A camel knelt to bear him, and the men, As all the live long day they journeyed on, Oft cheered him with their hospitable smiles. At night they halted, where a sparkling brook Threw its bright glances to the silv'ry moon; And kindled on the banks a social fire, Whose crimson flames, as mingling with the streams, Made the brown visage of each traveller round, Break from the darkness, with refulgent eyes, Like the good angel's, who of old was wont To sit by night, in wildernesses drear, With the lone saint that thither fled to 'scape The swords of persecuting zeal, more fell And eager than the famish'd beasts that saw The angel there, and from his glance retir'd. The evening meal dispatch'd, the travellers then Spread out themselves upon the ground to sleep; The ruminating camels kneeling, form'd Their heads towards the light, a rampart round. On hovering wing the restless brood of sleep Delusive, flutter'd o'er the Hermit's head. As oft the migratory birds awhile Play round some wave-worn bark met far at sea. Lingering, they stoop, as if they would alight, But in the moment when the stretched grasp Of the bold shipman, snatches to possess, They mount aloft, and swiftly speed away. Denied repose, the weary Hermit mov'd Close to the margin of a murmuring stream, And sat him down to muse on holy things. Scarce was he seated there, when he observ'd The coming shadow of a man behind; And turning, saw an Arab pilgrim near, On whose dark face and head unturbanded, The thin shorn hair seem'd like the charnel mould That furs the dead in a cadavery. Stern was his look and gaunt, but his mild eyes Beam'd more of grief than fierceness or revenge; Of grief incensed to pain by the keen thought Of hurt that never, never can be cured. He paus'd, and view'd the Hermit, who in vain Made effort to enquire whence he had come, On what intent, and in what savage land His home was plac'd; but a restraining awe Baffled the will to speak, and held him mute. At length the antient of the deserts thus Began, unask'd, his own terrific tale. âSon of that race whom destiny has rais'd To drive by crime or favour from the earth The elder lines of Afric's sable tribes, Know! when the cycle of your reign is run, Men of another tinge shall then arise, Who, in their turn, will sink the master whites Into th' oblivion where the blacks but fall As older first. Our sable visage bears The emblem of our state; night is on us, And your bright foreheads glow in the full day, But come it will, though in your noon so high, Ye shall the midnight, too, of fortune prove, And be as tombs that shine beneath the moon. âThe empty waste o'er which these travellers came, Was once our native land.âAlas, how chang'd! There parching desolation ever reigns, With silent famine, gasping thirst and dearth Continually increasing. There the day Is evil to the songless Arab's sight, As sullenly fast o'er the mould'ring sand He goads the dromedaryâall around Lies ashy hoar, and dead as mountain snow, What once was fertile soil, gay cloth'd with flowers, Dumb as the void of uncreated night; Save when the dismal and monotonous wind Comes breathing arid death, is all the air, Which once with warbling of glad vocal birds, The bleat of flocks, refreshing sound of streams, Pipes of contented swains, and the brave voice Of social cities, thrilled with fragrant life; No cloud e'er screens it; no perfume can scent; Not e'en the unburied corpse can now attaint The perish'd element, but without smell Falls into dust untasted by the worm. 'Twas there that Eden's happy garden smil'd; And there the earth sentenced to be consumed By quenchless fires will first begin to burn: Already there, th' unmitigated sun So strikes his kindling beams, that every day Widens the hungry circle of the waste. âBut, fond Believer in the Christian hope, Think not that consummation when it comes, Will verify thy vain expectances: Nor that when life on this drear globe shall endâ As end it willâthe fire, when it begins, Will, by such heralding, be e'er proclaimed, As shall awaken thy oblivious trance.â Cheat not thy credulous fancy with the dream That on the dread and final day of man, The stern'st Archangel, stepping from his throne, Will, as a curtain, rend the skies asunder; And shew within to all the startled dead, As from their bursting graves they live again, The star-crown'd millions of the seraphim Round Heaven's artillery charg'd with wrath and doom, Against the rebel fiends and sinners damn'd; While from his high and dazzling throne beyond, Your boasted Saviour comes to judge the world On the bright wall, whence his assembled saints Shall see the waves of chaos burst their bounds, And toss the planetary orbs below; Like helpless navies from their anchorage torn, Amidst the hurly of a charter'd tempest. No: on that day, motion shall be run out; Sound be no more, and Nature worn with age, Close all her eyes of light, and wearied, die. Manâlast created thing,âshall be the last To which the universal end will come. âWhat if the fate be thine to be that last, To see what I have seenâfeel what I felt, When the dire simoon licked our fountains dry, And wrapt mine eyes in darkness, till its breath Had into ashes, and the desert, turn'd All that was lov'd and lovely to my heart.â The Hermit shudder'd at the dreadful thought, And would have spoken, but the morning light Shone in his eyes, and when he look'd again There was no Arab, but a cheerful youth Who, pointing to the camels as they rose Shaking their bells, all willing for the road, Invited him to rise. He, for awhile, Pond'ring the tenour of the ancient's tale, And half inclined to think it but a dream,â The aimless reasoning of the fancy lull'd,â Or some temptation of the wand'ring fiend, That oft beset him in the hallow'd mood Of pious thought, with questionings of Heavenâ Then knelt he down, and with uplifted hands, Towards the kindling east, where now the sun Came forth triumphant, sung his morning hymn. The strangers, as the Hermit then aloud, Poar'd forth his desultory song, stood mute; For though unknown his speech, they felt his zeal Thrill to their hearts, persuading them to pray, As if the gift of Pentecost had been Conferred upon him, and they knew his theme. When he had ended, and with reverent awe, They had replaced him on their gentlest camel, Onward they journey'd, and at Jaffa's port, Where he embark'd for Christendom, they brought Rich eastern gems, spices and choicest fruit, Store for the sea,âbut he rejected all. BOOK II. At Rome the fervour of the noon was past, When thron'd amidst a gorgeous multitude Of crimson'd Cardinals and mitred Prelates, The Pope held solemn court. On that proud throng, Richly the sun pour'd through the lofty halls His golden radiance, and the priestly heart Swell'd with imperial thoughts. Then from without A stir was heard, as of the great approach Of some high embassy. On either side Opening roll'd the motley crowd apart, Like the foam-crested billows of the sea When Moses stretch'd his hand, and through the deep Trench'd the mirac'lous way of Israel. Silent they stood expecting, all prepar'd To witness homage, and reward with praise The vassal worship of some distant kingâ But at the portal enter'd, boldly free, With staff, and scrip, and palm-branch in his hand, A simple pilgrim; and his lofty eye Pierc'd every breast. The pontiff own'd its power, And on his throne of pride was smit with awe. It was the Hermit. Soon a murmur rose At his irreverence; but he look'd around, And lifting high his arm, froze them all dumb With dread, as thus he vehemently spoke:â âAwake, arise, and gird your loins for war: He that upon his vesture and his thigh Hath written âKing of Kings and Lord of Lords,â Calls you to battle, and the hosts of heaven, On their bright horses, trampling wrath and flame, Wait till ye arm. The beast and imageâall That bear the markâprophet and worshipper, Shall be deliver'd captive to your power. Come, the avenger to the vulture cries, Come to the supper of the dreadful God, That ye may banquet on the flesh of kings, Of captains, and the mighty of the earth, The bond and free, that war against the Lamb.â His summons rous'd them like a herald's call, A herald from the champion of Heaven; And without knowledge of what enterprise Was then commanded, high their spirits flam'd. Though tam'd and priestly, all averse to blood, They felt like knights athirst for glorious war; So did th' intrepid Hermit's earnest voice And kindled visage animate their hearts. For in his mean attire and wasted form, They deem'd Elisha or the fearless Baptist Stood manifested to the eye and ear, A messenger immediate from the sky. He saw their ardour, and while reverence yet Held them in silent wonder, from his seat He bade the pontiff rise. Lowly he rose, And the bold pilgrim, with his palm-branch, marshall'd His awful way, till they alone had reach'd The inmost chamber. There together they Invok'd celestial wisdom, to sustain The spirits girded for the holy cause Of Him who rides on the white horse, and leads The gather'd armies of the living God On to triumphant battle. And this done, The Hermit told his tale, and in the name Of Jesus and Jehovah claim'd that aid Which he in faith had promis'd confident. Nor heard he aught the papal sire would say, Who look'd admiring, chang'd from awe to doubt, When he commanded that the Church should spread The banner of the cross on high, and call Kindred, and tongues, and peopleâall that bow At Jesus' nameâto draw th'avenging sword, Ne'er to be sheath'd, nor truce or respite given, Till the accurs'd be utterly destroy'd In Zion, and the sepulchre redeem'd. And straight, his fiat barring all reply, His trust and office brooking no delay, He left the Pope, his task to him fulfill'd, And in the streets, burning with zeal, appear'd. Meanwhile, without, the circling tidings spread Of some high mandate from the Lord of Hosts Brought by a prophet from Jerusalem, And all the town, wildly astir, pour'd out, To learn the new apocalypse. One sound, One ceaseless question, murmur'd every where, And none was answer'd, but still thronging press'd Towards the palace, priest and secular, Old, young, the lordly and the lowly, all Fill'd with dread wonder and religious fear. The altars were deserted, banquets left, Guests rudely quitted in the very welcome, Long parted friends at the first meeting fled, All tasks of duty, servitude, and pleasure Were then forsaken. At the sick man's couch, Before the final sacrament was done, The priest in haste set down the bread and chalice; Mothers that left their infants but to ask What mov'd the crowd, forgot their helplessness, Funerals were halted, and the abandon'd dead Had but the coffin to protect their limbs: The impious and unscared in that wild hour, Pale and aghast, inquired the will of Heaven. But still the Hermit and the Pontiff held Their secret conference, and the glorious sun Far in his western chamber had retired. The anxious multitude, like waves on waves Heav'd by the winds, rolling tumultuous Around the palace gate, saw overhead Shadow with shadow blend, fold upon fold, Till the black pall of darkness was complete, Nor dared to be impatient. But they were As soldiers muster'd, waiting for their chief. Their stir was as that low continuous sound, When leafless forests, hoar with winter, feel The blast pass vehement, and shed their snows. At length the ray of one small taper flared Within the stately portal, and anon Lights issuing numerous, raised the pall of night High o'er ten thousand visages, And all was still, as when the fatal axe Gleams in the air, and some great martyr dies. Then came the Hermit, and the throng exclaimed âHe comes, he'll bless!âO bless us, holy man!â But to their prayer he yielded no reply. Straight passing through them, as they roll'd apart Like Jordan's waters, when the Ark of God Was borne amidst themâhe sedately moved Towards an ancient portico, and there, Rais'd on the steps, far seen, far heard, began:â âThere are high times and cycles set of old, In Heaven's eternal calendar, when God Receives the register of all things done Upon this earth and every other world. Th' angelic choir at that great time, all mute Lean on their harps, and wond'ring ruminate Why evil is permitted. Jesus then Sits visible to his selected saints Thron'd on the right hand of that veil of light, Which from all vision hides the Father's face. Round and above him, a refulgent sphere, Millions of glorious beings hovering, bend To hear his mediation, and all things Full in his sight lie spread afar below. âAt one of these dread epochs, in his task Th' accusing angel folded up the roll, And with deploring eyes, stretched his right hand And pointing to the earth, thus doubtful saidâ âBehold yon wretch upon the ocean's strand, On the green margin of the western sea, Ceaseless he praysâbut though his heart confesses Unsated guiltiness, and though his prayer Be less for pardon than for change address'd, Yet asks he still in vain. Say whom, O Lord! Shall I accuse for his recorded sins.â All Heaven was mov'd; the glorious radiant throng That hung on wing around, paled in their brightness, And the concealing splendour of God's throne Deepened its hue as with a blush suffusedâ If this idea of ascribing the sentiment of repentance to the Father, require any apology, it must be found in the following passage: âAnd it repented the Lord that he had made man.â Genesis, vi. 6. Then every eye was turn'd towards that manâ That outcast man, created for perdition. But only Jesus look'd compassionate, And shed in pity, his life-giving grace Into the outcast's bosom of despair: It came as the first element of light, Through th' abyss of nature, and he rose From his prone knees, a minister of Heaven, To work great purposes:âthat wretch was I!â Fir'd by his zeal, the kindling hearers glow'd, And swore by Him that had redeem'd their souls, Their sentenced souls, from everlasting death, Kindred and native land, never to see, Till with the chosen captain of the cause, They had cut off the infidel in Zion, More utterly than Israel did of old Th' Amalekites, and wash'd the hallow'd tomb From all pollution, with their blood and tears. Hymns of resolve and stern devotion then From every voice rising spontaneous, Fill'd all the vault of Heaven. Many that night, Saw mighty forms careering in the air; Omens and prodigies. The earth did move As with a conscious sense of wonders then, And saints and martyrs in their graves and shrines, Like men awakening, rais'd their jointless arms, And from beneath the winding sheet glar'd forth, Eyeless and fleshless, on the world again. Down to the lowest depth, all hell alarm'd, Heard underneath the fall of something dread, Thund'ring descend into th' unknown abyss Where God hath not yet look'd, and at the sound The damn'd were silenc'd; for they felt as if The nether and sustaining vault had fail'd, Till with the terror of annihilation, So wild a shriek and wail burst from them all, That torment rag'd more fiercely than before:â While the antagonists of Heaven on wing, Their clamouring flight directed to the earth. For well they knew by that mysterious sign, The powers and thrones of their confederacy Were threatened, and that man, roused from the sleep Wherein his spirit had been long entranced, Was moving onward to their overthrow. The fires of Hell that on the breasts and wings Of the ascending fiends, gleamed fiercely red, Shone faint and fainter as they higher rose Into the black, thick darkness overhead, And soon like embers to their ken expir'd. Yet were they still but on the skirts of night, For the continuous sound below came up, Even when it died, the rushing of their wings Cheer'd them awhile, but that too sunk away; Nor could their voices interchange discourse, For now their flight lay through the silent reign Of everlasting death; and there for ever They had yet wandered in still solitude; But awful fate breath'd on them as they passed; And they were borne like birds amidst the storm, Whirling and headlong, till they heard afar The noise of dreadful billows breaking high. Then knew they that they were in the dark cave Which through the adamantine rocks that bound The ocean of old chaos, leads from hell To the lone shore of that wide troubled sea Between created and eternal things; And hastening on, saw like a distant star, The cavern's mouth, whereat they halted, aw'd, Not there expecting light. Short was their pause. But with more wary steps they now advanced, And as the opening widen'd to their view, A glorious day seem'd all-diffused without. Dazzled and fearfully they cower'd along Till they beheld, rang'd on the cliffs above, The muster'd armies of the living God, The true and faithful: there, the seraphim, Blazing in chariots arm'd for enterprise, Standards of flame unfurl'd, and in the midst A tower of radiance, where Heaven's warder stood. Back from his lidless eye into their den Gnashing the teeth of hate and blasphemy They shrunk aghast; for he discover'd them, And at his signal all the shining host Mov'd as for battle. But the time was not When they should bear Jehovah's wrath abroad, So they were stay'd, and darkness, over all Fell like a curtain, while th' exasperate fiends, Like vultures hastening to the fields of war, With curse and scream rush'd from their dark retreat. Swift was their flight, for computation fails With numbers used by mortals, to express The distance o'er the turbulence of chaos, And spirits reckon not by time, but thought, Their speed and actions; with them length and depth, Yea, all extents and properties of things, Are measured and encompass'd as the mind Of man conceives its fancies and designs. Their course as o'er the wild abyss they flew 'Was like the changeful bird's, across the sea, I have been told by several seamen who have met with the migratory birds on the Atlantic, that the flocks have risen like a column of smoke from the horizon and, bending towards another point, have for hours together continued like an arch bridging the ocean to the extent of several points of the compass. When winter sends them forth, or spring recalls. Aloft they rose, and then descending, seem'd A living archâa dismal galaxy, Dim and malignantâreaching from the cave To the dark confines of creation. There They scatt'ring spread themselves, but save of those, Few and the feeblest, that came to the earth, The Muse content, awhile forbears to sing. They, in that ominous night did long perplex The Pope and Cardinals, filling their hearts With doubt, and hesitation, and distrust, Though much inclin'd for base and earthly cares, To urge that war the Hermit had proclaim'd. But still around his inspiration spread, Like fire to heath; and every heart was fix'd By the bold preacher, steadfast to his cause; As the unsettled waters are resolved, When winter breathes upon them, into ice. Firm as the rocks whereon ambitious kings Build the great strongholds of their state and strength, The will of that vast multitude was knit, And temper'd to one purpose as he spoke. So when Pope Urban from the conclave came, There was no choice but to obey, for all Were sternly nerv'd for war, harden'd as brass Cast into dreadful engines for the field. Which made him feign the virtue that they felt, And render homage to the holy man. This saw th' accursed demons, as they hung Unseen of mortals in the midnight air, And they exultedâhopeful envy thence Might so infect the pilgrim's pious cause, That it would perish like a sober fraud, Devis'd by statesmen reckless of man's woe. But, in the flush and rapture of their joy, Fear overcame them, and they grinn'd with rage, To think the seraphim, all marshall'd then, Had seen and spar'd them in their flight from hell, Till courage was rekindled by despair; When each more fiercely burn'd with zeal to work Ill for the harm it did, not in the hope That aught of good would thence revert to them, But as the means to sink themselves plumb down, Deeper from all remembrance of the blest, Into perdition. The dire thought of heaven For-ever lost, bred in them such a pang, That hell's intensest fires were as a sea Of cooling tides, wherein their quenchless pain Might be allay'd: so misery barbs the sting Of self-upbraiding to defeated guilt, And evil deeds grow motives still for more.â Up from their hovering pause they turn'd their wings, Doubtful what course to take; and as they turn'd, Above they saw, unclosing, fix'd on them, The eye of Heaven's great sentinel, and fled Scatter'd and devious, like the shades of night From the refulgent searching of the sun. But still it beam'd upon them, and they sought Refuge and screen from its pursuing ray Within the breasts and bosoms of all men, Yet found no hiding-place. The Pope advanced Towards the Hermit, and the opening crowd Softly made way for him, but ere he reached The hallow'd tribune where the Preacher stood, His progress was forbidden. All were hush'd, And silence spread o'er all, till the void ear Heard but the beating of the eager heart; For faint and weary, to the earth had sunk, Worn out by zeal, the Hermit's feeble frame, And gently o'er him as he languid lay, The cherub Sleep had stretch'd the fost'ring wing. Calm was his slumber, as th' oblivious rest, Unsullied by the passage of a dream, Which Labour nightly, for the blameless hind, Earns from benignant Nature, to appease The sense of partial Fortune's daily wrong. BOOK III. When the fair morning raised her dewy eye, The Hermit rose with every sense refresh'd, And rising said, like one that would command, âGet me some food!â When, as the words were echoed, Pil'd by ten thousand hands, food for ten thousand Rose like a pyramid within his reach, But many a mother rue'd in Rome that day The stinted succour of her wailing babes. âA miracle! a miracle!â the crowd exclaim'd, And their exulting shouts, swelling to praise, From tongue to tongue the joyous tidings ran, âHe turns the stones to bread!â And they were borne As on the wings of all the winds abroad, Like a new gospel o'er the sea and land. Travellers that held the bridle in their hands, Discoursing with their hosts irreverently Of the new prophet, hors'd themselves amaz'd, And speeded with the news; departing ships, With anchors weigh'd, swung in the favouring wind While the great tale was told, and then at once Should'ring the waves aside, they sought their course With the rich freightage of the miracle; The old and young at every village door And way-side shed, stood clust'ring, as in haste Horseman came following horseman: some pass'd on, Intent to bear the tidings to their homes, And spoke not; barks at sea slanted their helms, To tell the coming sail, afar descried; Lone shepherds, slumb'ring on the breezy downs High on the mountains, were at noon call'd in To listen to the rapturous report; On the still watch-tower, at the dead of night, The sentinel that hail'd the passer-by Was answer'd with the tidings; studious men That sat entranc'd, pond'ring their tasks of thought, Were, by the voice of menials and the tongues Of lauding women, gathering thick without, Rous'd to inquire what prodigy had come; Nuns at their windows anxiously stretch'd forth Their eager visages unveil'd, and cried To the unheeding vulgar to appease Their thirst for circumstance; churches were clos'd, And cloisters were deserted: all the priests, Friars and novices, were wide abroad To hear and to report, and dying men, Struck with the pregnant eyes and earnest whispers Of their assembled kin, telling the news, Did strive to ask, but in the effort sank And died neglected; kings, and statesmen fam'd For warlike enterprise and staidest wisdom, Forgot their wonted cares to speak of this; Th' adventurous merchant, list'ning to the wind Restless, for his rich navies, near the coast, Heard hurrying strangers tell the solemn tale, And was so touch'd with their impassion'd speech That he forgot his fortune's jeopardy; A seaman's wife, who all the live long night With gown o'er head walked the resounding shore, Thinking each tangled stone that dash'd the wave A corpse, and pictured to her painful fancy Some fatal wreck to her expected lord, Was told the tidings by an awe-struck wretch That prowl'd to plunder the sea's outcast dead, And mingled with him sympathies devout, Her fear forgetting, and his trade forgot. All business and terrestrial hests of men Stood still wherever the great rumour came; The ermin'd judge did pause in his award; The lover's day of bliss was then deferr'd; The gen'rous horded his appointed gold To help the mighty ransom of the tomb; Determin'd enemies sheath'd up their hate, And turned their ire towards the infidel; The murd'rer and the martyr were set free To aid that cause which miracles so vast Proclaim'd Jehovah's. Thus, through Christendom, Thus, ere the Hermit, summon'd them to join, All hearts beat high, and wheresoe'er he went Cities pour'd forth their swarms to greet his entrance; The rich and poor promiscuous lin'd the ways, And bashful maidens mix'd amidst the throng To give him welcome, dreadless all of harm, For not with shouts and clam'rous peals of joy Was he receiv'd, but with this solemn song:â âMourn for Jerusalem, for Zion mourn! A widow desolate she sits, she sighs, Forlorn and far from help, down to her knees She bends her head, in hopeless sorrow bends, And in her hands hides her sad face: the tears Of ceaseless and sore weeping fill her palms. Mourn for Jerusalem, for Zion mourn! A captive chain'd, prone to the earth she lies, And on her breast the proud oppressor stands, Trampling her beauty, dreading no avengerâ Who shall avenge?âher mighty all lie low. Mourn for Jerusalem, for Zion mourn!â Onward his mighty task the Hermit toil'd Till Christendom was rous'd. His name was spread With such courageous breathings of revenge, And aspirations confident in Heaven, That he alone was as the chief and tower Of all the Christian brave. But yet to war Were summoned none. Though they, with zeal on fire, Burnt for the enterprize, he still repressed Their ardour, watchful of the pregnant time When resolution grown to habitude, Would of itself the form of action take. So on untired, from town to town he went, Goading impatience till it chafed within The rein and curb of his great sanctity. For yet the place where best he might begin To band the valiant for the Holy War, Was no where found; and he at times did feel The ache of doubt, and the chill sense of fear, Trouble his boldest hopes. When as he lay One night in meditation on his couch, The thought came to him that at Amiens, His native town, he should the banner spread; For there his youth in low intemp'rance spent, Had cast its slough, but was believ'd unchanged. E'en his fond mother, when he came in tears Of unfeigned penitence, there cast him off, He had so oft deceived her. From that time, In solitude, till the great pilgrimage, His life and being were to Heaven resign'd. But now while all the width of Christendom Flam'd, kindled by his piety, he thought Where he had sunk the lowest and was held In least esteem, it might be well ordained That his career of glory should begin. Up from the couch he started, and at once Ere chirp of wak'ning bird, or cottage hearth, The earliest morning star, gave sign of day; He search'd through devious shades, the road alone, Full of high faith and dauntless to endure The scoff of those who shared his impious hours, The scorn of dearer friends that deem'd him false And his contrition feign'd. As he drew nigh, Rumour proclaim'd the news of his approach, And all was holiday throughout the town; Save with his mother, who had long bewailed Him reprobate and lostâshe weeping sat, Expecting shame, and saw in fancy there, The pelting rabble tossing him along, And heard their ruthless yelling in her fears. âMother of Christ!â she cried, starting alarm'd By her own thoughts, and clasping high her hands, In sad distraction as she paced the roomâ âMother of Jesus! thou hast known thyself A grief like mine, for thou too didst behold Thy son in ignominy.âBy the pangs Which thou hast suffer'd, I invoke thy aid.â Mother of Christ! thy pangs were not like mine, For they were temper'd by the heavenly thought Of thy son's holiness.âBut thou hast felt What 'twas to sit beside thine infant's couch; To see him smiling as he lay asleep; To catch him to thy bosom in his pain; To share the shrill shouts of his eager glee; To press him fondling for the pranks he play'd;â Let the sweet memory of these gentle cares Plead for thy pity to my erring child!â While thus impassioned in disshevell'd woe, She claimed relief, the sound was heard without Of hurrying footfalls in the peopled street, Mingl'd with cries, âHe comes!â âthe Preacher comes!â At the first shout she ran with frantic haste Towards the door, but soon her faltering limbs Fail'd, and she knelt to pray, but could not. A pause ensued and she reviv'd again, But when anon, the clamour louder rose, And she beheld, as fearfully she glanced From her clos'd casement, every window fill'd With clust'ring heads, and swarming children pass; Forerunners of her son's approach, the light Was shiver'd to her eyes, all objects reel'd, And in her ears so wild a larum rung, That she dropp'd trembling, witness to no more. Now came the Hermit with the streaming throng, Like a small pinnace on the ocean's tide, Toss'd devious by the saucy waves, the spray Breaking high o'er her.âTo that ins'lent crowd Were known his frailties, and how oft before With fitful penitence he had beguiled Compassion to his errors; and they thought His zealous preaching, but well feign'd device To bring derision on all piety,â For this was hooting and contemptuous laud, The taunting welcome of his native town. But he remember'd Jesus with his cross Toiling up Calvary's laborious steep, And bore with lowly heart and downcast eyes Their merciless reviling. In his face The boon-companions, who were wont to share His shameless orgies, oft familiar gazed, As if they honoured some well acted part. Grave elders too, did shake their heads and laugh, While wanton boys afflicting missiles flung, Unchidden by their sires.âTo all their scorn The patient Hermit answered but with sighs, And to the church steer'd his uneasy way. On the proud portal-steps he sat him down, Pale, weary, and forlorn. Some who had mark'd His meek endurance, felt their bosoms thaw And melt with pity when he slowly rais'd His eyes, suffused with tears, and look'd around, But saw no friendly visage.â From them grew Contagious charity, and silence spread As when the icy winter's viewless spell, Arrests the brawling waters in their course; In that suspense, he rising, thus began:â âWhat! is Heaven's mercy then so rare on earth, That one poor wretch, snatch'd from perdition's grasp Is such a miracle, that you reject His living evidence?âYes! ye have known me, In this blest temple haunt the pious maid, And with lewd glances as she knelt in prayer Lure her to my desires; and seen me too, With impious ribaldry the chalice take, And drink eternal poison to my soul. The priests abhorring cast me from their altar; Felons did shun me; starving mendicants Paus'd in their cries when I drew near, and turn'd, Trembling and shudd'ring, from my proffer'd alms; No voice replied to mine; the very dogs With whom I shared the relics of my meal, Ye stoned as guilty; succour was forbidden;â A child in pity that once threw me bread, Was deem'd accursed and condemn'd to die;â E'en my own mother when she famish'd saw me, Shrieking fled from me, ghastly and abjuring.â Were those probations of my outcast state But fruitless punishment? Had Providence No end in that unsparing ministry Whereof ye were such merciless performers, But to degrade the creature It had made? Then, even then, when ye beheld me vilest, The vengeance search'd me like refining fire, And purg'd my spirit of its sensual dross Till it was temper'd for the tasks of Heaven. What other proof would ye of this great change Than that I here command you to assume The badge of Christ, and gird your armour on, As my own vassals that dare not refuse? Arm ye, Avengers, and prepare for war!â His voice like thunder shook them, and their hearts, Aw'd to submission, own'd the sense of dread. Softly afar a stir and murmur rose Behind them. Eagerly the Hermit look'd, And every face towards the point was turn'd Whereon his eyes were fix'd. The throng divided: A passage free, like a long avenue Opening, disclosed an old, afflicted dame. Wild were her steps, her flowing grey hair loose Was frequent lifted as she clasp'd her hands, Like the white sea-spray on the tossing yards Of some wave-drifted wreck; straight to her son She rush'd impetuous, in her arms she caught him, Wept on his breast, and kiss'd his tearful cheek. The Hermit felt his mission then confirm'd, And the converted multitude as one, When they beheld the glorying mother kneel And look the thankfulness she could not speakâ Shouted obedience to his high command. THE ORDEAL OF JUDAS. Dread Heaven works noiseless. In the vast Immense Creation, never tired, still onward steers Her spangled bark athwart that ocean sea Which clasps the measur'd universe around: And mute as death, her orbed enginery Sweeps in its awful purposes serene. But of the infinite expanse and depth Of God, the omnipotent's dominion, nor The height sublime, where his all-present power Sows space with stars, and reaps the fruits of life, Man may not sing unblamed, and our dark task Is of that nameless deed, bred ere time was, Within the womb of the Almighty will. Forth to the garden the Predestined went, Where, with enfolded arms and scowling eyes He dar'd the vengeance of the sullen clouds, Through which the wading moon perturbed drove, As one that hurries in a flight with fear. Around him, wrestling with the rising blast, The fig-trees struggled, and the olives groaned; Afar with wild successive howls, watch-dogs Cower'd awful kennelward, as if they saw Stern portents passaging upon the blast; And presently, within the turbid gloom Black and mysterious, near Judas, stood A mighty, terrible, unfashioned form;â No eye its visage could discern, nor ear The shadowy secrets of its soundless tread. With gestures fierce, and accents vehement, The moody traitor in his anger criedâ âIs it for this that I have borne so long Taunting and malice in his thankless service? My care condemned; aye, while the wherewithal Is ebbing from us.âI am sordid; yes! To stay the waste, and check the luxury?â âLook you for thankfulness?â a startling voice Said in his ear; and in the well-known form Of one he knew, the Tempter near him stood. Surprised and trembling, all unconscious why, The doomed exclaimedââIs he not Lord of man?â But Satan said, with mirthless laughter moved, âHath he such need of gold? cannot he make The stones grow bread, and from the water cream The fragrant unction of the Persian oilâ Knows he not, as thou sayest, this alchemy?â âBut we are not like him,â the traitor cried: âWe thirst, we hunger; and the cost consumes Our scanty treasureâpoor wayfaring men!â âDoes he not hunger too?â exclaimed the fiend, âNor ask, athirst, refreshment from the spring? Hast thou not, Judas, seen him do all this? And yet believe the mortal thing divine!â âBut I have seen his miracles and mightâ And dare not, when his searching eyes are on me, Believe him less.â âI, too,â the demon said, âHave seen his sorceriesâwas I deceived? And yet I saw thee there, and paling stand Amidst the people.â But Iscariot cried, âWhen, to his summons at the sepulchre, Wakening looked forth, lifting his clammy shroud, The buried Lazarus to life recalled: What spell prevailed, what sorcery was there?â âTo answer, Judas, would be to confess I knew the secrets of his crafty lore: Was Lazarus dead?âwas he not in a trance?â Four days and nights he had lain in the grave.â Was it with death?âno taint of death was there. But, granting Lazarus lay sunk beneath Our mortal sentenceâwhat did Jesus more Than old Elisha to the Shunamite?â The trembling traitor, while he strove to veil His bosom's anguish, could not hide the flame That blazed in torture round his heart: the fiend Looked scorchingly, as thus he made reply:â âThou canst not but confess him wonderful, Gifted o'er man, and with a god-like arm?â âI will not doubt thy knowledge of his power,â Cried the dissembling adversary, âfor Thy long experience far surpasses mine: Nor will I question his sublime endowments, Richer than those of all our living race. But was not Moses in his epoch dread, And raised such wonders, that succeeding times Have since lain fallow;âhe but stretched his arm, And the dry desert quickened into life. Then rose the blast on the Egyptian towers; The whirlwind showered the pest; rich caravans, With all their camels, merchandize, and guides, Sunk whelmed, consumed beneath the loathsome drift;â Defy him, Judas, with that miracle!â Aghast and horror-struck, with scornful grin, The outcast quailed; for deep and muttered low The fierce antagonist of sentenced souls Plied his stern whispers; but the hypocrite Amazement feigned, and diffidently spoke:â âOur Lord rides not in vengeance on the earth, But teaches peace, and, as a husbandman, Sows a blest seed that shall hereafter cheer: He comes in love, and with him hope and health Gladdens the abject pillow of disease.â âIndeed, and sayest thou so? what moved him, then, To chide thy care; nay, publicly rebuke Thy just reluctance at th' unbless'd waste? But shame drives swiftly on to him and thee;â Hast thou not heard a price is on his head? Had I the motive, friend, that thou hast had, I would to-morrow call the treasure mine.â âHow much is offered?â was the guilty question. âIt is not allâthe favour of the priests Is better than much gold; that, too, is promised:â It were to earn bright honour among men, To give the daring malefactor up.â But go, go quicklyâearn the great reward; Some one more resolute may claim the prize: Go, and be firmâGod speed thy workâGood night.â THE DEATH OF ST. JOSEPH. In Bethany the aged Enos lived, Skilful in simples and the gentle charms That mitigate the anguish of disease; Wide the sweet odours of his pious life, Patience and charity, abroad were spread. As the soft west wind in its breathing bears The fragrant spirit of the blushing rose From the bright bowers of Sharon, so his name Still wafted kindness to the poor forlorn. His mossy roof, a lonely still retreat, Stood on the margin of the murmuring townâ O'er it the fig-tree in the summer gale Caressing stoop'd, and the embracing vine Flung her fond tendrils on the lowly shed; Before his door, with herbs medicinal, Grew many a flowret cherished for its bloom, And near the pomegranate and olive, there The humming clusters of the eager bees Strove emulous to hoard their winter sweets. At morn and eve, and when the starry night To solemn musings led the wond'ring mind, The hymns of Enos rose, and frequent then The moon-bright mountain-tops their holiness Shining afar, raised heavenward his theme. Nor were the sparkling villages around, The green glad valleys and the waters still Mute in their harmony; the birds and streams, And all the incense of the'vocal fields Joined in his requiems and songs of praise. One night when sleep had from his pillow fled, And on his couch the sorrowing sage deplor'd The fated errors and man's mortal doom, A gentle hand upon his casement knock'd. The summons was repeated, and he rose Enquiring who, at such a peaceful hour, Broke on his lone tranquillity; the voice Of Mary Magdalene without, replied. Her youthful errors and career of shame Rush'd on his sad remembrance, but he then Unbarr'd the casement, and in pity spoke. âAlas! forbidden, art thou thus again Abroad and vagrant in the guilty darkness? But let the Merciful judge of thy sins, And change thy course; my duty is to aid. What aileth thee, and wherefore dost thou weep?â âJoseph, thy kinsman and the spouse of Mary, O gentle Enos, sickens unto death; And I am here,â she cried, âto bid thee come. Though late it be, and thou art feeble, old, I pray thee comeâcome, and make no delay. For this, O Enos! I have brav'd the streets: The sons of Belial saw me as I pass'd, They knew me tooâbut still I hasten'd on, For then the angel of the penitent Flam'd bright at my right hand, and they were awed: They saw him there, and gave me fearful passage.â Back from the window turn'd the good old man, And belting on his cloak, for the shrewd night Blew cold and dire, and dense the east wind hung On the dim eyelids of the weary stars. A basket then with drugs and herbs he filled, And trembling seized the sorrowing damsel's arm, Forgot his staff, and took with her his way. Dark were the streets and silent as they went, Save where afar the howl of rioters, Incens'd with wine, startled the stilly night, Or where the groans of hopeless anguish came From open'd casements, or, more dismal still, A troubled voice from some dread portal rose, Haunt of the guilty or the destitute. But on unheeding to the house they go Where Joseph lies; around the unguarded door A whispering multitude of ancient men And aged women, smit with piety, Stand list'ning, and amidst them trembling stood The star-taught shepherds of the distant hills, Who from the lighting of the evening star Beheld in heaven an omen and a sign. Then o'er that house came bright swift-glancing forms, Winging themselves to earth, as from afar Camp wardens see in some beleagur'd tower Thick hurrying lights and signals of alarm. The humble chamber where St. Joseph lay Wrestling with death, look'd to the garden, and By open windows drew the cooling breeze. Deeply he breath'd, and panting agony Sat on his breast. Beyond were distant seen Dimly and dark the shadowy hills, as o'er Their haggard summits rose the red round moon, Her fullness then complete, and near the couch, Pensive and pale, with folded hands, serene, Stood the blest Mary, watchful of the change That fading life still on his visage shed. With head averted from the hopeless scene Apart, unmov'd, at the low pallet's foot, Silent and sad, as if her tasks were done, Sat Martha: on her hand she leant her brow, As one of expectation all foregone. With soften'd step, and leading by the hand The tottering Enos, Mary Magdalene Advancing, lifted from the floor a lamp, And with her elbow raised aside the curtain That veil'd the visage of the dying man. But a brief space old Enos look'd on him, And turning round, said, with reproachful sadness, âWhy have you brought me here? Alas! no more Can mortal skill availâhis time is come: Save only Jesus, he alone hath power To quench the anguish and withdraw the dart That sentenc'd nature hath infixed here.â While he thus spoke a rustling rose without, And presently with his disciples then The Saviour entered.âAt his dread approach The grasping demon of the dire disease Relaxed his firmness and relenting seem'd, Awed and forbidden in his tasks of pain. The sacred mother saw her son draw near, But spake not to him, though her eyes express'd Wonder subsiding into resignation; While with an eager grasp, on bended knee, The gentle Magdalene his garment caught, Imploring him to bid the sickness cease. But Jesus gently from his skirt withdrew Her hand importunate, and mildly said, âIt is now fit that he should be removed.â The sorrowing mother understood the words; While Martha hastily arose, and claimed The mournful Magdalene to move the couch From the chill breathing of the midnight air. But as she stooped the pitying Saviour said, âThou art too careful about many things, But only one is needful.â She desisted: Still her entreating sister earnestly Again beseeched that Joseph yet might live. âHe hath been ever just, and wise, and kind, And peace and blessedness,â she weeping cried, âHave always flourished near his dwelling-place. To all the town 'tis known that he lies sick, And on him weighs a mortal malady; O let not, then, the unbelievers think Thy will and efficacy here have failed.â Jesus benignly heard her strong request, As a fond father with compassion hears The piteous prattle of his idiot child, And meekly lifting o'er the dying saint His uprais'd hand, the sickness pass'd away, And he became easy and calm, and clos'd His aged eyes, like one that falls asleep. EPILOGUE FOR âMADDALEN,â TO BE SPOKEN BY THE DUCHESS. Ladies and gentlemen, how do you do? I hope you're very well; how, sir, are you?â Not you I mean that grins that ghastly smile, For mercy, ceaseâDeath's tired to-night of toil. But after death methinks the critics say Damnation comes.âOh! pity this poor play, And pity me sent here to beg respite, By damning one you murder both outright. See, gentle critics, how I weep and plead, You never meant to do that double deed, But if you did, let justice to you look, You're quite as bad as my old deary duke. Yet if your hearts, pity's bare babe controls, Though I'm no Sheba, nor yourselves King Sols, We may agree that only one shall die: Well, which? the poet's play, or duchess I? You hesitateâmay Heaven my sins forgive! And must I perish that the play may live? Or think you me a good warm-hearted body, Though in my fancies somewhat queer and oddy, Catching the thought by tail, or wing, or foot, And little heeding how the phrases suit? What! will you spare me? but the boon is vain, Sirs, I'm a fiction of the poet's brain, And were the play beneath a giant's heel, I like a beetle would in suff'rance feel. Good people all! attend awhile to me; Pale Tragedy's a nymph of high degree, Her mother, Sorrow, and her father Mars,â How dare ye kick her like a bumpkin farce? With more respect for your own sakes behave, If die she must, and no appeal can save, Riseâsolemn, allâand with a pang at heart, Thusâwith your handkerchiefsâlike me, depart. THE END.</field>
