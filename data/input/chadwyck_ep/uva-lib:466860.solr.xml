      <field name="fulltext">PART I.POEMS OF SENTIMENT. A POET'S BRIDE. I She stood beside the ruin of a wall Painted and carved; where unplucked flowers and moss O'ergrew the beauty of the ruling Cross: And sainted foreheads, which in other time Had bowed their earth in heaven's cloud-columned hall, Were queenly wreathed in mockery of age. And here a bank its purple shadow kept Above a lake, where Hope perchance had wept, Ere yet a tear was made the mirror of a crime. And here a monument whose ice-like page Dropt as the day perused itâthough a bard Had found therein the coldness of reward. Dark trees were dying round it. Farther on A grey and falling bridge sent gentle strife Through waters, which, unstained with human life, Made music 'mid the roots that twined the stone. And far beyond a plain, where living forms Flashed in the lustre of warm summer hours; And a thick world of forest, whose deep tune And shadows stretched where no sear leaves were strewn, Stood hills, the hiding-place of sunny-storms That laughed amid the light in sudden showers. II She looked not on the pride of marble, built By mortal hands, but happy, yet afraid Of her sweet soaring, still unweighed by guilt, Gazed on the light that man could never shade, Nature's first spirit. O'er the sands she strayed Mute as a wish within a human breast; And ever where her step its footmark made Some wave did woo its faintness into rest. Or, as the fairy wind, her travels passed O'er bud and leaves, that bowed but did not break. Her heart was as a vase where Love at last Had found a warmth to keep his flowers awake; A twilight fount, whose varied currents take The hue of heaven and fall with it to earth, Lending life beauty, and affliction mirth. Her eye had many shadows, as each dye, Each tinge of thought dissolved into its sky. Their lids encircled with small beams of gold Were silver clouds; and showed the sun behind A world of deepening blue, that chased the cold Left on her temples by some wandering wind; Feeding with light, or sending fitful showers To wash her warm cheek's fondest passion-flowers. III Her lips released the music which the lute Of her soft tongue discoursed; or, if 'twas mute, A living whisper, a perpetual breath, Almost a sigh, did on her lips remain; As if 'twould rather linger in such death Than fly to life where louder breathings reign. O'er the transparent clearness of her brow Her hair, like a fine waterfall, waved down, Bathing the pliant marble of her neck; Whose native light streamed through without a speck, Now flashing out in snowiness, and now Hiding its glory in a ringlet's crown. Her waist love-zoned; her veins seemed heaven's blue, And their bright blood the sunshine that runs through. Simple, yet robed in all that dignifies; Gifted with beauty's artless eloquence; Her look fell humble, as ashamed to rise, And her thin hand upraised its innocence To screen (in vain) those spirit-lighted eyes. IV A Poet's heart beat for her in that hour, And gave its pride to grace her single power; Though he had taught life's sleep to dream and think Of shapes unmet with, save in death's far sky, Which his youth pined forâyet on earth each link Of his soul's chain had been some ardent eye. And there stood she to whom the poet's line Seemed hope's true calendar of wild desire; Whose speech was music, whose unwasting fire Burned on her gentle heart as on a shrine. Their eyes perceive each other's beauty, growing With too much splendour to be gazed upon; But only felt to tremble in its flowing, With fear that fetters not the hope it girds; While as he speaks, all cold concealment gone, A silver sigh answers his golden words. V And that brief moment of the heart's unveiling, Is worth its long years of succeeding light; For every coming hour must find it failing With hopes that may return notâonward sailing Until its voyage shall be wrecked in night, And all things darken in the sinking sight. Not thus with theseâthe poet who had seen Earth's splendour fade before him, and the bride Whom his stript breast now sheltered in its prideâ In whom no thought recoiled on what had been, But clasped the heart whereof she felt the queen, And feared no darkness as the daylight died. Each was the other's life: their passion seemed All that hath e'er been found, or feigned, or dreamed; The atmosphere and earth, the sky, the shadeâ All which was theirs to see, and all that cannot fade. VI Their melancholy was but deeper joy, Too deep for smilesâfor he was marked with grief; And she, though sunnier thoughts the spell destroy, Was fashioned in the sweetest starriest time E'er whispered of in poet's midnight rhyme; And her pale gloom had ever felt relief In token of a morrow. Now they were Throned on the bosom of their love, uniting In one small circle all that least can err, Sting and deceive, with all that most can bless, Support and shield in virtue's pathlessness. They winged them o'er the fields of air, alighting In some lone spot to talk on fairy themes; Or twined within the hollow of a shell Whose sea-voice sang to them, steered their true dreams. Where never mortal eye hath seen how well The beautiful unenvied things of ocean dwell, They met the winds together; walked the space Of their serene dominions as a meadow, Reading strange poetry on heaven's face, Translated by the heart. Their spirits rode On a loose rose-leave or a flying shadow, Looking for happiness; and in such quest Its ample heaven inhaling, as afar His fleet heart's horses bore her willing car. They gazed upon their vastness of abode, And asked not if the traveller Time should rest; They knew no measure in mortality. And if the heavens should change they could not guess, If the pale earth should shrink beneath the sea, And if the large sun roll blank and shadowless. VII Around his heart she hovered like a bird Secure of its firm nest; his faintest word Called sudden light into her love-taught eyes, And bound her in a chain of ecstasies. She sent rich-laden sighs from out her soul, And caused fair smiles and dew-like tears to sit In his heart's honeysuckles; or on the scroll Of the vast shore his haunting image traced, And wept to see the waters razing it. Or harped some magic words of love misplaced, Then clung in sweet conviction to her own, Breathing her winged wishes through her eyes, That trembled as they flew. And on a throne Built in a little skiff, impelled by sighs And launched on tears (a picture of man's love), They drifted in the morning of the moonâ He on her heart which lulled him still too soon; Whilst his illumined features mutely move With the strange life within; till it would fly Like a quick cloud before the wakening eye. VIII She watched him like a star, till sleep would seal Her fervid eyes; till each sweet sense would reel, Yet never tiring, with deep prayers and hopes, And love that gazing could no longer feel, But burned and burnedâtoo strangely to reveal. They safely bounding from some daisied slope, She passed her fingers o'er his brow, and wrought A spell of peace around each struggling thought. She studied how his secret pain to win, That she might bear it, though it were sharp with sin. Still waiting on his eye as her life's king, That motioned her still purpose; from the bee That gave him its true wealth she wooed the sting, And balmed his worldly heart with Love's own surgery. In earth's dim chamber she did hang a lamp, Gilding its walls with cheerfulness, and breathed Strength in the sinking fire that chased the damp; And as he left the chilling crowd she flew His love to kindle and his hate subdue; Binding his shattered feelings, till he sheathed That withering furyâsmiling in the hue, The truant picture of a poet's mind, That feels a joy in rest which flight could never find. IX His wearied feet she bathed with pleasant waters; And with a magic care she treasured up The dew of morning in a lily's cup, For the noon's banquet, not produced by slaughters, Which she did spread in such peace-haunting bowers That all the year seemed sown with long and happy hours. And when Night's wing hath skimmed the purple air, And fond hearts sleep within a breast as fair, Hers throbbed before him, or enthralled beside, Answered its nature's nameâa poet's bride. In every season, scene, and wearying trial, Still rose she as the light on his heart's dial; Folding his bosom from each naked woe, The storm above and frozen world below. In rage, compassion, prideâin that disdain Which knows no terror and which owns no pain, In the strange frenzy of that full belief Which binds imagined raptures in dull grief, In those wild moments of unearthliness, When mortals with the dead, not living, hold Their spiritual converseâshe did press Still as his own; a wanderer from life's fold To share his herbless mountain and bleak waste, And mould her beauty to her shepherd's taste; To have no prompter but his lookâno song But Love's deep whisper which contained no wrong. X At the year's dawn pale coronals she twined To screen him from the sun, whose furious ray She locked in her parched heart; and then resigned Her burning wealth to warm his wintry day. And lovelier were the leaves that took their birth From that fair stem than e'er have dropt from earth; High on Affection's mount, its tops partook Heaven's holiest light, its root earth's clearest brook. Formed to depend, and yet majestic made; To bend in pliancy, yet rise unchecked, Save by the hand that clung to it for aid When Hope's bold galley on the world lay wrecked. Branching and budding to its master's hand, A breath might stir it, whirlwinds not command; Gracing the calmâor, struck by sudden thunder, With bending top it saved the blossoms under. In the wide wilderness it had no brother; A gentle sky bedewed it in pure love; And though it shared the sorrow of its mother, Rooted in dust, its bright brow waved above. XI She lived as lives the moon, for her dark lord, Or rainbow, scabbard of the tempest's sword; Thus like a mountain shadow, broad and brief As the sun ruleth; or a bird's bright grief Loving the beam that blinds itâthus lived she For him who lived for allâwhose heart and mind Were of one essence, mixed and most refined; Whose moral was a deep unhiding sea; Though men in life ne'er ventured on its glory, They found in death the truth of his strange story. Thus lived they in the world things of the sky, With hopes that could not falter, love not die. Their lives a secret from the vulgar throng, Their very names unsyllabled in song. To poets and their brides alone are given Passion like theirs to light earth's path to heaven; And they were circled by Love's fairies thereâ Daughters bird-voiced, but more than cygnets fair, Learning and lisping joyâand sons with wreathed hair. XII They were united where no human ear Drank their deep vow, and where no human gaze Startled their still intensity of praise; Where feet save theirs ne'er wandered, nor huge piles Of turrets and tall porticoes appear, Wild nature mocking with smooth symmetry. The clouds in maiden meekness fled the smiles Of their bright lover, blushing into eve. In heaven's high arch showed nothing made to die, Where mortal pride ne'er led its pageantry, And mortal fame had wrought not to achieve Its sculptured triumph on a lifeless stone. All shapes looked free, yet fastened; most alone And yet encompassed by society. In the far valley camels caught the wealth Poured from the liberal mountain, fitted yet For their unladen lives and sunny health; And o'er a modest, mute, clear rivulet That gushed at a hill's foot, a lone tree hung, Sending its leafy shade to pay the debt Of its green nourishment: and all day here Came happy bands of never hunted deer, Whose footsteps beat the mountain-nests among Ne'er frighted bird, or hushed its merry tongue. XIII Then might the bard and his young Eve confer Of lands too sacred for the serpent's trailâ Free paradise where no hand might err. They turned their eyes on a most gentle dale, Gracious, like morning standing on its shore Ready to sail, for it did seem no more Than the fleet gardens of the firmament. There light and music, hue and odour blent, Played round their senses, beamed into their blood. Gales, trembling with their freight, mild lightning sent Into the bosoms of unwearied streams, That for the love of flowers, still poured their flood, And told their wave-lipped secrets as they went. And lilies bowed their heads, as with love-dreams, To look on the gay jewels, which the hand Of human vanity ne'er dived for: wings Of most minute and perishable things Slept, as if rested on immortal land, In leaves that hardly hid them, and which floated Like little ships upon their sea of light. Each object wore the air of one devoted, Filled with rich sympathies of sound and sight. XIV Bees at perpetual springs in honey draughts Drank to the health of the gay sun, and hived Treasure unvalued where no theft had thrived; In lasting homesâwhere winter never wafts Its piercing blight, but floats unhurting by, Leaving a cool repose in the o'erheated sky. In the green boughs and on the glittering ground Were bowers for gentle birds, such as ne'er dropt At fowler's foot, or with unheeded sound Fluttered on brazen spire or ruined spot, Or peaceful thatch of cotter ivy-topped. And there they flourished in their changeless lot Within pavilions wove of tendrils rare; And nothing saw they that might be forgot, But all that moved in the delighted air Stilled at their melodies and grew more fair. XV And blood of lambs not destined for the knife Of luxury or of sacrifice, atoning For man's proud evil with their harmless life, Ran pure as mountain water, calmly clear: And fed with freedom hearts unworn with moaning. Goats claimed the hilly places without fear, Glad with continual pasture, where each blade Did seem to bear a separate shape and shade, Growing in green luxuriance. Vineyards yield Their purpling drink up to the thirsty day, And a tall wood flings forth its olive shield Where curious forms of limpid currents stray. O'er grassy pinnacles a pine-tree soared Sun-bronzed, like Triumph on a pedestal; And groves of ever-ripened fruits afford Delicious rest and banqueting, and all That Nature's holiest hand refineth unadorned. XVI And all the living verdure grows so well, No soft small worm hath life amid its roots; And through the air no sound unechoed shoots, And not a leaf but whose light curl can tell Of waters playing on their coral flutes; No sigh or sorrow, or heart-heard farewell, Or sharper wail when worldly promise fellâ Leaving the heart to break or find its fruits Black with a deadly bloomâto feel its fame But folly, disappointment, and dumb shame. Here nothing lived that owned an earthly law: Sincerity and Fearlessness were by; And each seemed kindred to the scenes it saw Break on its separate nature, from an eye Which guiltless oped at morn and closed as merrily. The air not damp and dark with human ills Was as a heavenly breath, serene, endued With warmer life and truer principles; With woman's faith not man's ingratitude. Nature, amid the rich romantic scene, Assumed the likeness of a fairy queen, Marking with sunny wand her pleasant circles green. XVII Here among scenes which the pale tempest pities, Sighing along the desert and the waves; Here unprofaned beneath the breath of cities, Nor humbled by the height of painted domes (Fit pride for kings and wonder of rude slaves), These two united were. Upon the earth, Heaven's altar first, they knelt and saw their homes, Formed for all times, for mournfulness and mirth. O'er chains like theirs but transient torture plays, Whose links are forged from over-pliant rays. Round the fair world they looked and saw no error; All there was hope not precipiced by terror, But laughing like an infant through a dream Which ne'er might waken to a sadder theme. Their creed is written on each other's heart, And sealed with truth that no false hand can part. âAnd o'er them flies the day, but leaves behind A track where the moon glides, with stars strewn o'er, Like jewels in the night sea; and they find A bird is lingering by, unseen before, With crest of crimson, lightening more and more As the sun droppeth on his drowsy shore. XVIII And as a seraph-guide its wings did show The path from that proud place, and did illume With darting lights, and filled with rare perfume, The herbage and the air; that held no foe To the sweet rites which none beside may know. And now the bird hath severed the grey gloom, A winged devotee of love; and under A palm-tree's ceiling shows a shrine of wonder, Surrounded with sweet flowersâsome hung like bells And breathed upon, as a faint ringing tells; And some when evening closed them shut within The beam which they had loved; and these shed round That mystic couch the light which they did win. Each thing displayed a beauty so profound That heaven's pure eyes look down and see no sin; And the presiding moon hears not a sound In her fine hall more happy than the sighs, That break from the bride's bosom to apprize Her poet lord, as falls the last disguise From her full wish; and on the threshold fair Of that safe structure, a scarce murmured air Invites her further. They have entered there. THE SPIRIT OF POESY. What is it but the living voice Heard in the earth and air, Bidding a blade of grass rejoice That man may not despair! What is it but the air of heaven Along an earthly lyre, Whence drops the snow that death has driven To quench its chords of fire! Its music mingles with the singing With which the seas and shores are ringing, When nothing folds the mystic sense And all is naked and intense. It is the voice of wondrous things, Covered and crowned with magical wings, Whose rustling as they stir on high, Wakes in the heart of heaven a spell of Poesy. The moon is a harp on yon hall, Whence beams and strange harmonies fall; Its flashing o'er myriads flew, But its voice was bestowed but for a few. It burns in the delicate air, But hark! are its melodies there? The light may be seen on the main, But the sound must be sought in the brain. And stars are voiced with pleasant songs, Whose sweetness to the night belongs; Notes that sail along the seaâ You wonder how such notes could be, Weeping for them as they flee Through the wave mysteriously. Measures made to steal and tinkle Through the crystal veins of light; Poet spirits born to twinkle On the breast of Night. Many eyes behold them glistenâ Rich the ear that stays to listen. Each form of thin and pallid mist That passes and melts by the starlight kissed, The natural smoke from the morning's lamp, Hath a sound as it walks, though you hear no tramp; And from the sounds of fairy wreathing Comes a meek and mournful breathingâ Murmured passion, sad and holyâ All that's sweet and melancholy. Clouds that looks like swans, and steer O'er the sky calm and clear, Keep like them their treasured tune From the hot and gaudy noon, Gliding from the livelong day To the precincts of the moon, There to swing themselves away For the beauty of a ray, Dying still too soon. And some are rocked and twined In the arms of the passionate wind; And others wander from their kind To listen a sea-lute's plaint, Which tells of a star that had pined For something which it could not findâ Save where a sun-taught hand would paint A shadow, tremulous and faint, On the bosom of a wave, Where at last it gained a grave. And some there are that love to swim Across the light they scarcely dim; Each turning to its fount a face Smiling like the seraphim, Whom they image whilst they chase Their fellows of the radiant limb. Lo! thousands are strewing Snow flowers on the way, Where the morn is renewing A tenderer day. And some are entwining Their innocent forms To keep her from shining On envious storms. Some dare the beholding Of Day when he wakes; And some are seen folding Their sun dropping flakes. Like birds how they quiver, Those children of light; They drop on that river Of radiant light. Now the water harp is strung, And the quiet wave hath sung; Beautiful billows with faces of green That smile on the glittering gulf between; Each hath its crown and each its song, Borne on the musical breeze along. The waters sing to the shore, The forests sing to the sea, All that have motion in land or in ocean Is gifted with minstrelsy. The torrents are sparkling and proud, Talking to the valves aloud; Gently breaking from a bubble, Voices breathe their pensive trouble; Mists that slumber on the hill, Murmur through their dreaming still; And the winds salute the mountains, And the stars believe the fountains. There's a noise within the flowers Which they whisper to the hoursâ 'Tis to tell how they are sighing For the serenade of showersâ 'Tis to tell how they are dying For things that are faithless and flying. A Rainbow! it is heaven's lyre, Which Passion and fair Peace inspire. Nothing's sweet that will not sound it, Nothing's bright but mingles round it; Each young colour hath a chord Quivering with some trusting wordâ Every word betrays the hue Where its brief existence grew. Boweth not the storm, subdued To its charmed and tranquil mood? Symbol in the air suspended Of the soul, when life is ended! View its wreaths of fadeless fireâ Hearken, O Earth, to Heaven's lyre. Is it some fanciful belief, or are The spirits of our being borne afar Amid yon rainbow, that the free warm thought May live where not an ice-chain may be wrought? Are not all hopes and infant promisings Reposing yonder, without wound or wings? All that is beautiful below, and pure, Doth it not melt to bliss unchilled and sure? Are these frail fancies? That romantic bow Hath man's wild poesy and woman's glow. O could the heart's first music meet the sight, I would take the likeness of that rainbow's light; For there, as in the heart of all passions, mix That change with the rich sun and will not fix, Its azure hath the charm of some fine eye Which genius looked from in its ecstacy: Anon with a young maiden's blood it burns, As her cheek's rose into a lily turns; That green hath formed some lover's diadem Ere hope had withered on its living stem. Each hue hath language, all the million dyes Quake with the noise of kisses and of sighs. And none are silentâlistening while they bless They gleam and speak in fluent tenderness; Dreams are their subject, hopes not meant to fail, And love, which is our nature's nightingale. Things that lighten, things that fly, Own the spell of Poesy. Through creation; bright or black, Winged Poesy, thou piercest; If in peace, the gentlest track, If in pride, the fiercest. Not a wind but lisps thy name, Not a flower but makes replying; In the frost-work and in flame I behold thee lying. All that's frantic, fair, and high, Is of nature's Poesy. A minstrel is sitting alone Upon a white and worldless stone, That seals up the bed of a gentle bride Whose mortal hath immortal grown, And left no track in the human tideâ Perhaps she were his own. The sigh that trembled o'er her clay May hold some speech of love for her; He trusts it to yon fainting ray That upward takes its silent wayâ A fleet and faithful messenger. And many a fond dream-whispered word Upon his heart is sweetly sinking; As if a slight and snowy bird Within his brain that instant stirred Its wing, and answered his mute thinking. Heard ye the murmur on a mother's tongue O'er what was made to die, but died too young; A heart that held through darkness and through pain, And when the light fell on itâit was slain. I heard her anguish though her seat was farâ Oh! air and voice of dreams, how true ye are! And there were other sounds that did discourse And bind my soul with a most gentle force. I caught the breathings of a girl whose mind Was haunted by a shadow, left behind By some illumined figure that had walked Across her heart, betraying as it talked. That heart beneath her flesh, as you may see The ruby midst the water's purity, I saw, and heard its languageâ'twas of tears, Of longings, memories, of all save fears. I looked, and it was wasting sigh by sigh, Until at last 'twas nothing. I stood by And saw it vanish; a light, veined leaf, Whose summer life a breath had made so brief. Then strayed I near a grating, and my mind Wondered and wept that ought should be confined. I glanced betwixt the barsâit was a space Narrow and damp, and full of foul disgrace: Its walls were frenzy-figured. And upon That dungeon floor appeared a skeleton. One knee was bent, its prayer seemed rage and pride; I saw the right arm moulder from its side. The other, raised, had tried to seize the grate, Where day divulged the lineaments of hate. The chainer had been chained, the idol bowed, And paid deep homage to a scornful crowd. But all things failed him save the chain and cell: I breathed with musicâ'twas the enslaver's knell. But soon far other notes serene and mild, Came o'er my soothed spiritsâ'twas a child Lisping a blessing. Then a Dove appeared Whose bosom had been robbed of all it reared. And soon a breeze came flowing thither, bright With many insects, crimsoning the light. Then on the sands a maiden sought a ship, With words that fell like life-drops from the lip. A slave came forth in bonds, which he did burst, And stood all free as man arose at first. Two birds, with dusky wings and breast of sun, Were circled in a gilded cage; the one Fluttered and sang, and tried to gain my look, And from his plume the glossiest feather shook. The other stirred not, sang not; it had lost The fire of song within its prison's frost. It was too delicate, too proud to live, I feared to breathe, it seemed so sensitive. At last it moaned; then gazed upon the wire And droppedâa thing to weep for and admire! The other lightened round the cage, and showed No sign of sorrow in its lone abode; But still it sang exultingly. I sighed, I could not love it like the one that died. The light partook of an enchanter's hue, A thousand fairy eyes came twinkling through; And a young bard some pensive treasure sought Where waters lulled him in his starry thought. But mark how from yon lattice looks an eye In fondness forth, yet half despairingly; And one that worships it, that grief to share, A moment standsâhe is no longer there. His step is quick yet low; his sight seems dim And bent on earthâbut hers is fixed on him. How rich the strength that through her veins hath ran! How proud is woman's suffering for man! She sleeps, she smiles; day hath no dreams like these. Her eyes are closedâit is her heart that sees. All beauty hath a voice; and I have found Life hath no pleasures like the sense of sound: And earth hath still a heaven for ears and eyes, Since Poesy doth teach all hearts to harmonise. THE SULTANA PREPARING FOR HER BATH. (Descriptive of a Picture, the production of a friend.) The glory of the light hath died away, The dazzled earth grows dim. And now the moon (A silver seal upon the closing day) Steals through the twilight, and a tranquil tune Comes from the deep to soothe the sun's decay. Heaven's harp hath ceased, but many an echo fair In mellow music pants upon the air. The sun hath sunk, but lo! there is a light Richer than yon unsteadfast stars reveal: The noon hath melted into chilling night, Yet can the soul a warmth and freshness feel; The signs and sounds of day have perished quite, Yet hath the quiet earth a breathing given Sweeter than all the varied sounds of heaven. Not from the lamp within yon radiant room Ascends the new-born beam, nor from the pride Of Eastern art arises a perfume, That fills a scene by beauty sanctified; But there, arrayed in all that Luxury's loom Hath woven for her children, is reclined A fair and fond creation of the mind. From her, and from the splendour of her face, The night hath caught its lustre wild and warm; All that is there, of grandeur or of grace, Its proud impression traces from the form, That, like the ruling pleasure of the place, Shows in the midst the figure of a dream Where love had learnt his first and tenderest theme. Like to the old fount of old, whereof to drink Was to inhale the fatal fire of love: So things, not doomed from such delight to shrink, Beneath her glance grow beautiful, above All other tints of beauty. On the brink Of a new joy she now resigns her veil, And what she looks on ceases to be pale. 'Twas feigned in early time, and men have hung Their faith upon the dream, that Love was born Of beauty; let the truth at length be sung. Beauty was born of Love: for pride and scorn Have crept to him in smiles, and Time looked young. With him the winter is no longer cold, And summer views its dust transformed to gold. So all about her varies with her eyes, Beauty the sure effect, but Love the cause; Though in her veins a haughty transport vies With natural tenderness; whose milder laws Her spirits may o'erleap but not despise. Thus, softly stern, she points to the sublime, The splendour and the sweetness of her clime. Her slightly closing eyelids well express, With the full pride of passions and the sense Of power but half displayedâthe consciousness That only joy, unmingled and intense, Is present to her eyes; which, sent to bless The turbaned tyrant of some lavish land, See all its ripe fruits falling to her hand. But on her smooth cheeks shows a settled flush Of Love's fine fever; not the single hue Of youth for its own beauties taught to blush, But a mute mingling of emotions true, Peaceful yet all impassioned; till a gush Of glory o'er her brow its way hath won, And marks a fond Sultana of the Son. Her slaves are readyâby her couch they shine, The genii of her passions. From her arm, All richly rounded by a taste divine, One bending girl, with many a graceful charm, The glittering circlet draws. But the deep mine Of ocean hath no pearl like that soft skin, The sky no tincture like the tide within. Close at her side another damsel stands, A sun-taught creature of voluptuous lore, Ready to fan her; or with glancing hands To scatter sweets upon the silken floor, Or loose her bosom from its gentle bandsâ That flashes from beneath its slight cimar, As through a cloud the lightening of a star. But chief a sable slave, of quaintest mien, And garb grotesque and costly, stoops to raise Her veil, as some dark vapour may be seen Unfolding the fair day. And he surveys Love's early sunshine, fervent but serene, And feels his frozen spirit warm the while, His face uncouthly curling to a smile. And with that aged slave awaits a train Of youthful figures, winged at her will; And all about are glistening tokens lain Of exquisite device, and wrought with skill. All that can breathe delight, and banish pain, From earth's bright circle, gathers round a spot Where grief might well be hushed and guilt forgot. Thus in the centre of the group, impressed With the full life of that luxuriant hour, Shaming the gems of her imperial vest, Yet softly languid, fainting like a flower, 'Mid draperies of silk her light limbs rest; And thus beneath the charm of summer airs, The sweet Sultana for her bath prepares. How will the willing waters curl around Their dainty visitant? What sparkles clear, And what a welcome of enraptured sound, Will rise to meet her on her cool career! And glancing from her to its marble bound, Each melting wave, while lucidly revealing Her form, will waken up some pleasant feeling. There in the night beneath a silence deep Thus whitely visible behold her glide, A wonder in the waters! come to steep In living joy a breast too bright to hide. Methinks the elements would seem to weep As from each rising limb, in pearly rain, It drips like dew into its fount again. And having passed that baptism of pure pleasureâ The weary warmth and deep luxuriance Of day subsiding to a milder measureâ She wraps her senses in a shadowy trance, Tempting the night to day with Hope's own treasure; Dim dreams and winged visionsâfairy things That gush from out our sleep like desert springs. And sad it were, and sad it is, to find A harsher moral in a fate so fair; To feel that some dark venom lurks behind, Like insects that have golden wings, but bear A poisoned body; to behold the mind, Where all beside a ripening radiance found, Barren and blighted on that holy ground. To see the wings of Freedom flap the dust, Or view her signs but as the darts of old That, flying, turned to fire; the simple trust And truth of life exchanged for caution cold; The ample theme of Reason undiscussed, And man's high spirits stooping from the skies Seeking on earth a sensual paradise. Yet, ah! what a marvel if for hearts like hers The failing mind at last forget to soar! Circled with joy, and shunning all that stirs The soul with stronger hopes, it bows before The altar of a faith which, whilst it errs, Makes glad our way with pleasures unrepressed, Till life's loud rapture ends in silent rest. And for the fair Sultana, if we trace No cloud upon her cheek, nor sign of woe, It is her clime that lightens through her face. And as the Prophet's fabled regions show Forms that glide shadowless along the space, So she on earth, a dream that cannot fade, Might move amid the light and leave no shade. THE CAPTIVE LAMB. It was a sight to be forgot When Nature's night shall come; A sound to be remembered not When music shall be dumb. For there are tones that will not share The fate of the forgotten air, But haunt with ceaseless hum; And there are scenes that fail to quit The eye, till tears have blinded it. Mine eye and ear of hue and sound A quickened sense retain; Echo and shade alike are found Self-stored within my brain: Yet is there one peculiar sense, That holds impressions most intense Of parted bliss or pain, And long will there in memory dwell, Fond inmates of its honied cell. The sun was wasting through the day, Above a scene as fair As ever tempted glance to stay, And end its wanderings there. The clear expanse on high was calm, As though the day dissolved in balm Upon the healthful air, To heal the wounds of scattered flowers, Wind-stricken by the wintry hours. Voices, of insect and of bird, Their hymns to Heaven addressed, But chief the summoning chimes were heard That cheer the fervent breast; The sun seemed one large amulet Of loveâthe day benignly set Apart for prayer and rest; As God himself thereon did cease From labour, hallowing it with peace. Lo, at each chime, with sober pace Approached a thoughtful throng; Virgins, with flushed but placid face, There grandsires led along. From many a sunny winding came The poor and proud, the swift, the lame, The sickly and the strong; In bands of mingled sex and size, The fair, the simple, and the wise. Far other sight anon was mine, Far other sounds than those That called the pilgrim to a shrine, The mourner from his woes. For, parted from the holy fane By graves wherein the wept and vain Lay wrapt in green repose, There gleamed just o'er the nettle's head A low undecorated shed. Mean and uncouth such place appeared Amid the landscape wide; Perchance its humble walls were reared To shame what shone besideâ Heaven's temple, banner-graced and gilt, Unlike the simple altars built Ere earth was trod by Pride. Whate'er its use, its narrow span, Unwindowed, was not meant for man. For man, the cheerful hall or hut May show what time hath done; Whilst spirits glad as his are shut From freedom and the sun. Ah! never did a manly limb Repose in spot so damp and dim Since sands were taught to run; Yet something, lost to Nature's race, Was living in that tomb-like place. A moan, scarce stifled, long and low, Betrayed the deepening dart Of thraldom in that haunt of woe, And smote upon my heart. Not answerless: for on my cheek A paler pity seemed to speak, In language lost to art, Even unto Heaven for that which tried To hush the grief it could not hide. I pausedâto hear mine inmost sense The moan reverberate; I trod the nettles from the fence, And shook the fastened gate. At last a worm-worn cleft I found: Within, upon the grassless ground, There layâas desolate As aught that ever missed its damâ A lone, and meek, and captive Lamb. The scene was touching to behold, For glancing round about, Within all seemed so dark and cold, So bright and warm without. A little Lamb! untimely caught, Untimely sold, and thither brought! Condemned at first, no doubt, ('Tis said to be the will divine) To die in pangs, that man may dine. And as it lay with eye half closed, And fleece all earth-defiled, So pent-up, yet to ills exposed, And helpless like a child: What marvel if my fancy deemed That lonely Lamb a thing that dreamed Of spots and seasons mild! Of meadows far away, and brooks That mirrored its first peaceful looks! Even as I gazed the captive stirred; And though no chain was seen, I thought the sigh my hushed ear heard A fetter's clank had been. It rose, and stood beneath a ray That through the roof had found its way, Then sought with steps serene The gate; and through a time-worked space Streamed the full meekness of its face. And all around its eyes were cast Most mutely eloquent; Till on the moss they fixed, at last, That decked a monument. Then glancing on each warm green spot, With all its gambols unforgot, Back to its bed it went; There dreaming still of field and flood To waitâtill men should shed its blood. Meek Lamb! thy moan within my soul A moral left behind; For prayer and anthem o'er it stole More idly than the wind. I turned from saints, from praisings loud, To muse on martyrdoms less proud: And often strays my mind From all I sought, from all I am, To think upon that prisoned Lamb. SONNETS IYESTERDAY. Pale pilgrim of the heavens, that late didst glide With sunbeam staff the violet vales along, Where fountains of fresh dew gushed up in song, To bathe thy golden feet, and then subsideâ Last wave that sparkled on Time's ebbing tideâ How are thy bright limbs laid amid the throng Of vanished days, that drooped o'er earthly wrong, Seeing how virtue is to vice allied, And vanished blushingly. Sad Yesterday! Night's winding-sheet is round thee, and the eyes That found a health, or fever, in thy ray, And thoughtfully perused on evening skies Thine elegy, star-letteredânow away Turn their brief thoughts of thee, and thus men moralize. IITO-DAY. A liberal worlding, gay philosopher, Art thou that lift'st thy young and yellow head O'er the dim burial of the scarce-cold dead, Building above thy brother's sepulchre A home of love that sense might almost err, Deeming thy end therein to woo and wed The flower-haired Earth for ever. Yet the red In yonder west may well such dreams deter! Yes, thou, all-hailed To-day! whose out-stretched hand Scatters loose riches on a bankrupt land, Even thou art but a leaf from off the tree Of yellowing Time; a grain of glistening sand Dashed from the waters of that unsailed sea, Where thou to-night shalt sink, and I as soon may be. IIITO-MORROW. Who shall imagine how thy wing may sweep, Many and mighty nations lying bare, To blightâwarâfamine? Who shall say if e'er The day may burn again? how men that sleep May wake, and wander up and down, and keep Their eyes on the dark east in long despair! Or, coming, wak'st thou from thy cloudy lair A lion-sun? or like a lark, to reap Music in heaven for the glad ear of earth? The signs of many yesterdays appear But fading sparks on gossip memory's hearth; Thine are as comets burning. For thy birth Freedom, half stifled in the clasp of Fear, Looks o'er a wailing world. The dawn, the dawn, is near. IVWISHES OF YOUTH. Gaily and greenly let my seasons run; And should the war-winds of the world uproot The sanctities of life, and its sweet fruit Cast forth as fuel for the fiery sun; The dews be turned to iceâfair days begun In peace wear out in pain, and sounds that suit Despair and discord keep Hope's harpstrings mute; Still let me live as Love and Life were one: Still let me turn on earth a childlike gaze And trust the whispered charities that bring Tidings of human truth; with inward praise Watch the weak motion of each common thing, And find it gloriousâstill let me raise On wintry wrecks an altar to the spring. VON TIME. To one that marks the quick and certain round Of year on year, and finds how every day Brings its grey hair, or bears a leaf away From the full glory with which life is crowned, Ere youth becomes a shade, and fame a sound; Surely to one that feels his foot on sand Unsure, the bright and ever-visible hand Of Time points far above the lowly bound Of pride that perishes; and leads the eye To loftier objects and diviner endsâ A tranquil strength, sublime humility, A knowledge of ourselves, a faith in friends, A sympathy for all things born to die, With cheerful love for those whom truth attends. VITHE CHARM OF SOUND. Though that with silenced heart by stream or glade The music of the morn hast haply heard, When every leaf hath canopied some bird; Whose step through wood and wilderness hath strayed When all the living sunshine dies in shade, When nothing in the haunted heaven hath stirred, And earth hath echoed forth no wakening word; Oh, come, ere yet the youthful year shall fade, Among the mountains and the woods once more, Pluck healthful pleasures, such as grew of yore Wild in the ways of life. The fevered air Of cities stifleth Reason, and their roar Leaves in the soul the silence of despair; Then come where Thought resides, for Music too is there. VIIHIDDEN JOYS. Pleasures lie thickest where no pleasures seem, There's not a leaf that falls upon the ground But holds some joy, of silence, or of sound; Some sprite begotten of a summer dream. The very meanest things are made supreme With innate ecstacy. No grain of sand But moves a bright and million-peopled land, And hath its Edens and its Eves, I deem. For Love, though blind himself, a curious eye Hath lent me, to behold the hearts of things, And touched mine ear with power. Thus, far or nigh, Minute or mighty, fixed or free with wings, Delight from many a nameless covert sly Peeps sparkling, and in tones familiar sings. VIIIINFANCY ASLEEP. The fairest thing that human eyes may view Now breathes beneath my ownâa sleeping child, Smiling beneath its thoughts and visions mild; Its face upturned in hope's pervading hue, As the glad morning of the mind dawns through. These wordless lips as yet have only smiled On life, nor hath an evil taint defiled Eyes that are closed like flowersâwhose tears are dew From the heart's inmost heaven. Oh! infant heir Of Nature, in thy fresh and delicate dust If aught of ill be mingled, 'twere unjust To deem it thine, for on thy forehead fair Sit purity and peace: be ours the trust That age shall find them still unchilled by crime or care! IXTO J. O. I class thee, moral Critic, with the few Whose simple friendship is a kind of fame; On whose unpurchased praise we rest a claim To glories which the CÃ¦sars never knew. Thy nature was conceived ere falsehood grew A fashion in the world, and Wit took shame To twine a wreath for Wisdom's naked name. Thus have thy words a power that doth endue Our dreams with faith, our deeds with gentleness. Within the mirror of thy single mind All noble thoughts their dear reflection find; And thy calm spirit, shunning all excessâ Keen in its quest of good, to ills resignedâ Pursues its way in smiles, intent to cheer and bless. XLIBERTY. There is a social and a solemn spell, A spirit in our dust, a dream divine, Filling the world with inspiration fine, And making virtue purely visible; Whether in hall of state or studious cell, Where'er the currents of our life incline, Oh! equal Liberty! this power is thine! For at thy voice, which Instinct knows as well As doth a child its mother's natural tone, The darkened soul looks sunward, like a bird Whose wing hath paused on mountains not its own. By thee, fair Freedom, in the outcast herd The seeds of high nobility are sown, And abject minds are taught the wisdom of a word. XITO NATURE. Sweet Nature, with thy bosom ever young In green temptation, and in healthier charms Than Art hath yet been painted with; whose arms Have rocked to rest a mind that oft have clung To the rich promise of thy secret tongue, Fulfilled in silence: Nature, not of those Who, shunning thy most fond and sure repose, For crowded cities their high harps have strung, And poured in thankless ears their rapturous rhymeâ Forgetting how each hollow flower around May hold an echo of Fame's answering sound In natural numbers, simple, yet sublimeâ O! not of such is he whom changing time Has only brought a wish to tread thy hallowed ground. XIITO D. W. J. Douglas William Jerrold. When I behold the false and flattered state Which all ambition points at, and survey The hurried pageants of the passing day, Where all press on to share a fleeting fateâ Methinks the living triumphs that await On hours like thine might tempt the proud to stay. For on a green and all unworldly way Thy hand hath twined the chaplet of the great, And the first warmth and fragrance of its fame Are stealing on thy soul. The time shall be When men may find a music in thy name, To rouse deep fancies and opinions free; Affections fervid as the sun's bright flame, And sympathies unfathomed as the sea. XIIIMORNING. Wake from your misty nestsâinstinctive wake, Ye fine and numberless, and sleeping things! The infant Saviour of all blossomings From heaven's blue womb hath passed; and for the sake: Of Earth, and her green family, doth make In air redemption and soft gloryings. The world, as though inspired, erectly flings Its shadowy coronals away, to slake A holy thirst for light; and, one by one, The enamoured hillsâwith many a startled dell, Fountain, and forestâblush before the sun! Voices and wings are up, and waters swell; And flowers, like clustered shepherds, have begun To ope their fragrant mouths, and heavenly tidings tell. XIVNOON. How all the spirits of nature love to greet, In mystic recognition from the grass, And cloud, and sprayâa warm and vivid classâ The eagle-stirring Noon; around whose feet The glories of the brimful summer meet: That reeling Time beholds his sober glass Turn to a goblet; and the sands that pass Seem drops of living wine! O, this is sweet, To see the heavens all open, and the hood Of crystal Noon flung back! the earth meanwhile Filling her veins with sunshineâvital blood Of all that now from her full breast doth smile (Casting no shadow) on that pleasant flood Of light, where every mote is some small minstrel's isle. XVEVENING. Already hath the day grown grey with age; And in the west, like to a conqueror crowned, Is faint with too much glory. On the ground He flings his dazzling arms; and, as a sage, Prepares him for a cloud-hung hermitage, Where Meditation meets him at the door; And all aroundâon wall, and roof, and floor, Some pensive star unfolds its silver page Of truth, which God's own hand hath testified. Sweet Eve! whom poets sing to us as a bride, Queen of the quietâEden of Time's bright mapâ Thy look allures me from my hushed fireside, And sharp leaves rustling at my casement tap, And beckon forth my mind to dream upon thy lap! XVIMIDNIGHT. The pulse of Time is stopt: a silentness Hath seized the waters, and the winds, and all That motion claims or musical natural; The altar of all life stands victimless. Of beast or bird, in joyance or distress, All token sleeps; nor leaf is heard to fall As Midnight holds her breath! The kingly hall Is barredâthe slave inherits an excess Of infelt loyaltyâthe exile views His home in dreams; nay, even the student breaks From his worn volume, and forgets to muse On laws and worldsâthe miser only wakes, Warming his fingers at a golden heap, He smiles in Midnight's face, and will not trust to sleep. XVIITHE MOUNTAINS. Oh! Mountains! On your glorious points sublime, The threshold of our earth, to stand and see The seasons on swift wings come forth and flee; And from the changes of enchanted time To draw the moral music of my rhyme,â How full of joy this simple lot would be; To cushion on the grass my bended knee, And worship Nature in a clearer clime. For on the hills have mortal footsteps found The eagle nest of Freedom, and a throne Where peasant-princes have been proudly crowned. Full many a stirring air and pastoral tone Come breathing from them still; and all the ground Is full of strange delight and glories deeply sown. XVIIINATURAL STUDIES. To see the grace and glory of the year, Cradled in leaves, grow with the breath of May, At whose warm touch the winter melts away, And all the wakened heaven, shows full and clear; To mark the faint but freshening light appear, And throw its first fair gold upon the grey, Giving glad promise of the dazzling day; To view the mute and labouring Night uprear Its starriness through storms; or trace the tide Forth from its pebbly prison flowing freeâ These link the soul, O Nature! unto thee; And in these scenes are figured and implied The dawn and growth of life, when taught by pride The Mind disdains the dust and feels its liberty. XIXTHE STATE OF MAN. Oh! who can look upon that lofty mind O'ercome by taunt and tears; observe the vow Of princes unfulfilled, and the slow plough Crushing the peasant's hopes; the weak resigned To wrongs, the crafty trampling on the kind; The laurel wreathed upon a branded brow, Hiding, not honouring; the olive bough Faded, and cast upon the common windâ And earth a doveless Ark. Oh! who can see How weak the wise, how fallen are the free; How Thirst sits pining by the plenteous main, While Virtue finds her garlands but a chain, Nor deem the golden hour is still to be, When Life shall look to heaven exempt from pride and pain. XXIN MEMORY OF KEATS. 1823. Mute Minstrel of the Eve, pale, mystical, When one by one comes forth the pensive train Of things not born for worldly strife and pain, That cannot fade, though doomed perchance to fall; Fond Cherisher of passions, fancies, all Whose essence fills a poet's flower-like home. I saw but now, within you distant dome, A cloud that passed its transitory pall Across the quivering light, and I did think That moment on the cold and shadowing shame With which thy starry spirit hath been crowned. How vain their torturings were! for thou didst sink With the first stone cast at thy martyred fame; How like the snow that's ruined by a sound! XXIDELIGHT NOT DISDAIN. Around man's hearth his dearest blessings meet. Why look we for a fruit that grows afar Planted in peril, when free pastures are, Like promises, spread round our calm retreat! Man flies the land to range where billows beat; Forsakes his hut to track the conqueror's car: Yet he whose eyes but watch some wandering star, May crush the steadier glowworm at his feet. And thus who idly grasp a doubtful good, In thoughts obscure and passions wild and vain, Neglect the native pleasures of the blood, And turn its health and hopes to present pain; Missing, for gems deep fixed within the flood, The readier riches of the fragrant plain. MY PEN. Nothing in the earth or sea Ever lent itself to me, As an agency to give Shape to thought that it might live; As an implement to stay Fancy on her hidden way, Turning every tone of hers Into sparkling characters. Whence I drew the pliant quill That hath compassed my will? Flying fondly here and there As a feather on the air, Sealing each unfinished spell, Poesy's own Ariel. Not from light and loving wing Fresh from the perfumed Spring, Fanning the red cheek of Morn, Plumed trophy have I torn. Not from eagle or from lark, Milky dove or raven dark; Not from swallow, that forsakes Heaven when adverse Winter wakes; Not from song-souled nightingale, With whose rich and raptured tale, Since the evening stole above, Poet's ears have fallen in love. Seas have offered up to men, Trustingly, a diamond pen; Point of crystal, fine and hard, Many a window-pane hath marr'd,â And 'tis oft the poet's curse To mar his little light with verse. But the light from heaven's halls On my floor unbroken falls, Narrow though my lattice seem To admit the boundless beam; And my fingers would despond Guiding the rich diamond, That with invincible incision Mocks the thin and thought-like vision. Some a glassy pen have found In the revel's wizard round, Tracing every word in wine With a relic half divineâ Fragment of a cup let slip From a foul and lying lip. Others in the sapless stem Of a blighted, bloomless flower, Ministrant have won to them Of a deep and moral power. But the glass may pierce a vein, And the stem a thorn retain; Thus may gushing blood imbue Things baptized in wine and dew. Yet though soon the glow may sink From that warm and crimson ink, Richer though it fade to-day, Glittering tint by tint away, Is such blood from martyred veins Than a sea of golden grains: Or the ink which traitors findâ Traitors to the heart and mindâ Which, like water that begets Toads and aspics where it wets, Wakes a spirit to disturb Fragrant bud and healing herb. Not a sunbeam in my quill, Nor a tear-hung icicle; Nor an arrow's instant light, Sharp and fatal in its flight; Not a trophy won from man, Nor a splinter from a lady's fan Steeped in fragrance. 'Tis indeed But a frail and bending reed, Plucked by a most listless hand In a waste and flowerless land, By the margin of a stream Where the idle eddies gleam, Even as hopes within the breast, Dazzling as they drop to rest. What is this uncultured waste But my bosom's fruitless pride? What the stream that sparkles past, But its fleet and living tide? Something in ourselves must be Still our own dependency. Yet the reed with which I write Hath a magic power to bless- Pouring through its tube a light On my moral wilderness, That the tempest is forgot In a glad and golden lot. TO ONE DESERTED. Fair stem of many hopes, what wind hath borne This blight upon thee? What hath chilled thy root, Turning to ashes all its golden fruit? Whose holy hand hath cast thee forth to mourn, An exile from thy paradise, where thou Hadst plucked the bitter joy which fails thee now, Like summer promises frost-broken. Sure The hand that smites thy bosom must be pure; A snow-shower quenching that ill-fated flame That hath but burned to tinge thy cheek with shame. No ruffian death should seize so fair a life, Bleeding like some pale lamb beneath the knife. Hath not Love's banquet-board been spread for thee? And the dark poisonerâsay, who is he? What tale is in thine eyesâeach tear a word That tells such truths as man hath seldom heard. Oh, it is hard to die by hands which we Had deemed most gentle, and whose faintest stain Our purest tears have rendered clear again. Art thou thus killed! The riches of thy shrine Are fallen to dust, thou worshipped as divine; And kneeling there, it did invade thine eye, Where each sharp grain begets an agony. Oh, it is burning bitterness to find Truth on the lip, and meanness in the mind; To drink from the sweet stream, and then behold A snake uncurling from the billow's fold. And here, thy pilot, led thee to the rocksâ Who swore to shield thee from the midday sun; Who brought a string to bind thy loosened locks, And so hath strangled the fond heart he won. What fine-spun threads compose the net, wherein The mind is taught to suffer ere it sin. How shall the bird escape the fowler's strings, Or soar, when selfish craft has stript its wings? For him the heartless and unhallowed lord Of the sweet word that waited on his wordâ Oh, be his lot to find the fevered shame Fly far from thee, and darken round his fame! To range o'er hill and heath, by tempest tost, And find no blessing like the love he lost. TO AN EARTHLY BEAUTY. No fairy I deem thee that paces by night O'er a brook's pebbled bank, or a grass-covered height No spirit art thou such as gleam through the deep, Or inhabit the pearl-builded palace of sleep; I may not believe thee the fiction that breaks On the poet's wild eye when his morning first wakes; No shadow that haunts on some sea-girdled ground That can melt in a sunbeam or soar in a sound. But a mortal I deem thee, a child of our earth, With a lip full of song and an eye full of mirth. No chain may I find in a single bright hair, Nor deem that a halo is hovering there; Yet methinks (though thy lip hath more Sappho than Eve) I could well from thy hand stolen apples receive; And thy heart hath a corner where mine could have lain, With a sigh or a song for the clank of my chain. Yet think not I prize what those glances reveal That awake in the eyes what the heart cannot feel; Thy voice hath a cadence that lingers on time, And we suffer in prose all we picture in rhyme; Though fancy bring forth, it is fact that conceives; If we reach not the fruit we are sprinkled with leaves; The spell may be surest when feelings come forth, Like a lily resisting the winds of the north; When the cheek's crimson summer is mantled with frost, And hope in the spring of its promise is lost. But give me the look that steals out from thy lash When the clear lid half closes, refining the flash! It is then that we read on thy bosom's pure page In a minute much more than is told in an age; Then the language of life we interpret in song, And sin against right in sweet sighs for the wrongâ When beauties like waves wash their wealth on our shore, And the grave of one joy is the cradle of more. Oh, breathe on the flame so enkindled in mirth, Could it last it might dry all the tears upon earth, And teach us that woman can sow through our sleep A harvest of visions that sages might reap. And well I discern, as crowned promises pass, Like Banquo's bright issue, thou bearest a glass, Where graces uncounted and sparkling are seen Like stars in the sea when no clouds soar between. Oh, if here I could stay for a century on, Till all that now dazzles is scattered and gone, When borne to heaven's gate through the gardens of air, Methinks I should askââif thy spirit was there?â SONG FOR SHAKSPEARE'S BIRTHDAY. Oh! the days are unnumbered that Fame with a hand All dazzling and trembling hath traced upon sand; But one must be lasting, still dear and divineâ And whose should it be, sweetest Shakspeare, but thine? As youths at the tomb of the Painter are said To touch with their pencils the life-laurelled head, So the name of our Shakspeare a music can raise, To sweeten the strength that would soar in his praise Oh, the hours and the days that have glided along, When the tide of the blood seemed an Avon of song; When the shapes that we saw, and the sounds that we heard, Were the dreams and the glories, the world of his word. Still, still to the fancy shall Rosalind cling, From Ophelia's fair flesh still the violets spring: Oh, the young heart had proved but a honeyless hive, Had not time kept the blossoms of Shakspeare alive. May the tears of the gentle descend upon them, While the shores have a flower or the sea hath a gem; For Will's wizard line is the famed purple hair, Whose magical virtue secures us from care. Sweet Shakspeare, we seek not to measure thy flight, Or add to thy rainbow superfluous light; But like silkworms we offer our wealth up to thee, As fed from thy own hallowed mulberry-tree. STANZAS FOR EVENING. There is an hour when leaves are still and winds sleep on the wave; When far beneath the closing clouds the day hath found a grave, And stars, that at the note of dawn begin their circling flight, Return, like sun-tired birds, to seek the sable boughs of night. The curtains of the mind are closed and slumber is most sweet, And visions to the hearts of men direct their fairy feet; The wearied wing hath gained a tree, pain sighs itself to rest, And beauty's bridegroom lies upon the pillow of her breast. There is a feeling in that hour which tumult ne'er hath known, Which nature seems to dedicate to silent things alone; The spirit of the lonely wakes as rising from the dead, And finds its shroud adorned with flowers, its night-lamp newly fed. The mournful moon her rainbow hath, and 'mid the blight of all That garlands life some blossoms live, like lilies on a pall; Thus while to lone Affliction's couch some stranger joys may come, The bee that hoardeth sweets all day hath sadness in its hum. Yet some there are whose fire of years leave no remembered spark, Whose summer time itself is bleak, whose very day breaks dark. The stem though naked still may live, the leaf though perished cling, But if at first the root be cleft, it lies a branchless thing. And oh! to such long, hallowed nights their patient music send: The hours like drooping angels walk, more graceful as they bend; And stars emit a hope-like ray, that melts as it comes nigh, And nothing in that calm hath life that doth not wish to die. PLEASURES OF PROMISE. Things may be well to seem that are not well to be, And thus hath fancy's dream been realised to me. We deem the distant tide a blue and solid ground; We seek the green hill's side, and thorns are only found. Is hope then ever so?âor is it as a tree, Whereon fresh blossoms grow for those that faded be? Oh, who may think to sail from peril and from snare When rocks beneath us fail, and bolts are in the air! Yet hope the storm can quell with a soft and happy tune, Or hang December's cell with figures caught from June. And even unto me there cometh, less forlorn, An impulse from the sea, a promise from the morn. When summer shadows break, and gentle winds rejoice, On mountain or on lake ascends a constant voice; With a hope and with a pride its music woke of old, And every pulse replied in tales as fondly told. Though illusion aids no more the poetry of youth, Its fabled sweetness o'er it leaves a pensive truth; That tears the sight obscure, that sounds the ear betray, That nothing can allure the heart to go astray. THE DOMINION OF PAIN. In all that live, endure, and die, In every vision of the brain, On Love's fond lip, in Pleasure's eye, The hermit's pulse, the warrior's vein; In hearts that pause and plunge again, Frail victims of the passing hour,â We find thy far dominion, Pain; We trace the footprints of thy power. Though some are washed away by tears, Whilst some survive the march of years. Who cannot weep was never blest; Would all were woeless that have wept; Would all that heaves might be at restâ And sleep might come to those that slept! My soul hath long its vigils kept O'er sense of pain and dreams of death, And knows not why its course hath crept Thus idly on for feverish breath. Whilst hour by hour it longs to sleep, I feel it doomed to watch and weep. FICTION AND TRUTH. There was a glare of light, a mass Of things that perish as they pass; A fiction of the eye and ear, And living hearts not more sincere. Mine nursed a wound they could not heal, Mine saw a scene they could not see; How little I for them might feel, How less could they for me! I knew not why I wandered there, In secret hopes or dim despair; Or in that dream of mute surprise That leads us to a brink, and flies. But there I breathed amid the throng, As one who walks a foreign strand, Watching the waves that roll along, And part him from his land. When, sudden as a star that drops Behind the far-off forest tops, Brief as the quick and quivering spark On struggling waters wide and darkâ There came a spirit on my path, A beauty dying in its birth, Gifted with all that woman hath Of music and of mirth. A brow, the whitest world of thought That ever pen or pencil wrought; A breast as wonderful and warm As ever love-dream failed to form. Methought although of mortal mould It held the flame of years to come: I asked my heartâ'twas sick and cold; My hopeâbut it was dumb. It came and claimed no kindred there; But glanced on me as though a hair, Plucked from the brow of Time, might be A chain to bind it unto me. On me it gazed, an instant gazed, Then passed through closing crowds again, A pinnace on the sea-foam raised To strike the swimmer's brain. Thus fairest things should vanish fleet Ere earth hath stained their falling feet, And all the blossoms she may shed Are destined to adorn the dead. I wished its momentary stay, Could be my term of life below, Unknown to pass in still display, By one regretted go. Its presence came so brightly brief, Its gladness bore no tinge of grief, The cheek of hope but not its fears, The eyes of love without their tears. Alas, the eye that chased my pain May now be weeping o'er its own; The breast where angels might have lain Tears may have turned to stone. And where that light was found and lost, I counted o'er a cloud-like host, Bright with the sunshine which they shade, While all beneath them freeze and fade. The flame had sunk where it began, The scene was still a painted show; They said 'twas truthâI turned to Man, And sighed to find it so. TO GREECE. (A Fragment.) O, mistress of rich seas, whose every billow Hath hymned a hope, or been some poet's pillow; Mother of mountain isles, whose every stone Hath borne the glory of some name unknown! Whose shores a holy echo still repeat, And show the sun-prints of immortal feet; Where but to thee shall youthful spirits turn, Finding an orient cradle in thine urn! O, scenes where Homer lived and Byron died, Greece! of the angel-sun the earthly bride, How dost thou win our worship! To thy shores, The mind's first Eden though profaned by crime, How flies untutored Poesy, and pours Its song of triumph on thy hills sublime, Pavilioned by the skies! Thy temple roof Now forms the pavement for an impious hoof; And o'er the land a blighting breath is spread To hide the heaven still bright above thy headâ A banner for thy cause, a mantle for thy dead! THE SHADOWS OF LIFE. The secret world in human eyes Is deluged still with tears; Our breath is turned to feverish sighs, And nature mused in fears. Cannot life rend its thin disguise, Or be what it appears! All passion is a blazing brand Thrown on a ready pile; Friendship a pressure of the hand; Pity a winter smile; And hope but winds across the sand, That forms, and fails the while. Our life is as an idle boat Along a winding river; An aimless arrow sprung remote From an ethereal quiver; And pilotless it still must float, And aimless speed for ever. Then let man build upon the grave A hope that cannot sink, A wintry waste his foot must brave, Yet he may find some brink; Or haply drop within the wave, Whose wine he thought to drink. THE POET'S HEART. 'Tis like unto that dainty flower That shuts by day its fragrance up, And lifts unto a darkened hour Its little essence cup. 'Tis as the grape on which it lives, That pleasure-ripened heart must be In sorrow crushed, or ere it gives The wine of poesy. Or like some silver-winged fly, By taper tempted from its flight, It sparkles, faints, falls quiveringly, And mingles with the light. And sure it bears a fortune such As waits upon that graceful bird, Whose music, mute to living touch, At death's dim porch is heard. And still the dolphin's fate partakes; Though bright the hue which pride hath given, 'Tis pain whose darting pencil wakes The master-tints of heaven. A mine where many a living gem In cell so deep lies casketed, That man sends down a sigh for them, And turns away his head. But not that dainty flower, the grape, The insect's sufferance and devotion; The swan's life-ending song, and shape Diviner with emotion; And not the dolphin's sacrifice, The mine's most rare and dazzling partâ O! not all these could pay its price, Or form one poet's heart. A HISTORY OF LIFE. (From an unpublished Drama.) Life!'tis sickliest shadow that e'er crossed The goodly green o' the earth; the hoarest sound That ever smote the silver ear of night From thunder-throated seas. Man hath not weighed A thing so light as his own life, that seems The strength of many things, centre of hope; And hath its little worldsâlove, glory, gainâ Riding around, as buoyant and more brief. How like the monarch of all life looks man, Yet doth a lean and livid worm out-reign The crowned Napoleon in the human heat! Whate'er our summer, ice begins and endsâ The cradle, and the coffin, of our year. All earth is but an hourglass, and the sands That tremble through them are men. And as they pass Some sparkle and would linger, but the rest Come sweeping heavily onward, and tread out The unredeeming lustreâand all sink. The starriest page that history hath traced In her own dubious twilight, is a tale Of buried men that used their tears for ink; A tombstone for the tired, which tells of those That wept and vanished, toiled and marvelled why. And all the students of our life have looked Bearded ambition in the face, and laughed; Themselves, perchance, had travelled far on foot, The roots of knowledge nurturing with their blood, Yet reared they not a branch or bud to shade Wearied adventure; while the few dried leaves, Which autumn swept from Eden, make a flame That thaws no bond from ignorance and sloth. So moves the visioned world; so runs the tale Studied in April. Nothing true survives Save fiction; which hath still the truest been, And so less trustedâ'tis a judging world. Man idles in the sun, and finds a heath To cross at eventide: the beam that flung Freshness and strength upon his brow now leaves His step unpiloted; while naked Death Comes like the shadow of the world abroad, Blotting his features out. Thus is he born That old Philosophy may smile; and dies That worms may thrive, and the thin poet write An unread epitaph. This, this is Life! THE WAVE. 1823.(Suggested by an early recollection of a beautiful poem by Shelley, entitled âThe Cloud.â) A being I take from the fountains that break In the depths of the ocean sand, And my form is curled through the yielding world To freshen the living land. And the sparkles I fling from my watery wing, As it mounts to meet the day, Are gems for the hair of the sea-girls fair That rise on my shining way. I pass by the place where the earth's cold race Repose in silent cells; And the lovely and lone have found a throne On a heap of glittering shells. I sing for hours to leaves and flowers That never beheld the moon, But sprinkle their sheen of gold and green To thank my lingering tune. I glide like a smile o'er the coral pile, With the ocean snake entwined; And sweep in my track the dolphin's back, Leaving a light behind. Bright wealth on my wings for a hundred kings From the sea's blue mine I bring; The loveliest glare that slumbers there I waft like a waking thing, While I strew the strands with diamond sands, And to beauty a pearl I fling. And every star on its cloud-built car Beholds its dominion of light, As I welcome each ray with a spark from the spray That trembles and shines all night. I waft some skiff where an eye on the cliff Looks fearfully o'er the foam, And save from the deck of some beautiful wreck The riches of those that roam. While all that have being in water are seeing Their crystal casements through; As I dart where pride hath splashed and died, And pain hath shrieked adieu; Where fear hath gasped, where hope hath clasped, And love when life was new. The cloud on high, the wave of the sky, I choose for my shadowy bride, And she comes sometimes from her shoreless climes, And kisses my trembling tide. But like all that is fair, on earth or in air, She dissolves in silent pain; And weeps on my flood her silvery blood That gushes in silent rain. Then I turn from my bower of the fresh sea-flower, Which an emerald lamp hangs o'er; I moan farewell to my palace of shell, Where the song-echo woke beforeâ And the night-spirits dim hear my last low hymn As I faint on the fading shore. ON THE SICKNESS OF A CHILD. A chilling fear pervades my breast For thee, my stricken child! The hope within me is repressed, For death looks through my dream of rest, With aspect wan and wild. A gloomy and a gathering fear, A thought untold and deep, My eyes perchance have scarce a tear, But there are scenes full frequent here That teach the heart to weep. And mine hath wept, my blighted boy; It weeps and trembles now, To think how frail a thing is Joy, When darkening doubts so soon destroy The graces of its brow. Our hopes should have but humble wings, When wealth must still be sought In outward and unholy things, Remote from the sublimer springs Of feeling and of thought. Spectre of Pride, art thou my own, My little laughing child? Whose voice was as a wakening tone, That might have into music grown, And made my spirit mild: Teaching my step once more to wind Through childhood's grassy way, And bringing back my infant mind, When life was a delight refined, And time kept holiday. Yes, yes, thou art my own, although Thy song be tuned to sighs; Thy dimples made to cradle woe, Thy cheek's fair sunshine changed to snow, And love hath left thine eyes. Oh, yes, thou art my ownâthe leaf, The budding of my tree; A green delight, a blossom brief, Whose promised glory ends in grief, Like things that fade and flee. A harmony within my ears, A brightness round my brow, A growing warmth through wintry years. A star above my tide of tearsâ All these to me wert thou! I gaze around the freshened earth Which spring hath made so fair; I hear the lark-voiced morning's mirth; And then I look eside my hearth, And find a winter there. SUNSET. The heavens are dyed with autumn, the dim Day, Stretched on its purple death-bed, sinks away. Silence and Even (seldom found apart) Come forth, to strengthen yet subdue the heart. But ere thus, missioned with intenser joys, They veil the deep and lull the forest's noise; Ere yet the truant winds have home returned, To cool some leaf whose breast hath all day burned Ere o'er the waters steal Night's misty feet, And on the plains of heaven her children meet; Nature a moment pausesânothing heaves As Time looks back upon the path he leaves. A scarce felt flush is seen to live and die, As if the Sun re-oped his heavy eye, Then by some tending cloud was fanned to sleep, And bathed his burning forehead in the deep. Lo! ere he drops, how fast the vapours ride To dip their feathers in his wealthy tide; While some to hover round his head repair, And wind their pallid fingers through his hair; Some flap their wings of snow amid his breath, And on his bosom drinks a golden death; While others stretch their arms to make a path Of gentle steps into his ocean-bath! One swifter-footed star hath reached its throne, Surveys the west, and rules the east alone; To share that realm its radiant fellows fly, Above the azure mountains of the skyâ There on the bluest summits take their stand, To guard the monarch of that minstrel land, And warn the night to draw around his rest The last pale curtain of the purpling west. All earth seems anchored on the sands of peace, And life begins where sound and motion cease. Charmed by the star-break all things stay their flight, And the fond waters bid the sun âGood-night!â ON A SET OF GEMS FROM THE ANTIQUE. I What forms are these, touched by the silver hand Of honouring Time? Methinks I see the face Of Genius, smiling on the radiant race That crowned old Greece with glory, and command Even now the love and praise of every land! The beauty of the dead herein we trace, Their very minds seem moulded into graceâ Nay-their most fixed affections may be scanned In these life-printed pages. Who may tell How thought hath been inspired! Perchance this form Was fashioned in the heart's mysterious cell, An image which young Passion worshipped well; Or haply in a dream, a visioned storm, First on the mind it rose, a rainbow bright and warm. II 'Twas subtle Nature's ever-working skill That gave these graces life. Most calm and white They lie, like clouds. In some enchanted night, When sleep had sealed up every earthly ill, The mind, awakening like a miracle, First in the purple shade, the starry light, The glory, and the marvel, and the might, Found fine realities, diviner still Than its own dreams, shapes wonderfully fair, And faces full of heaven. Or from the sea In its proud flow, the pearls, sublime and bare; The woods, wind-shaken, from the shell-strewn lea, Were these creations caught, that breathe, and bear Old Nature's likeness, still, profound, and free. 1831. LEISURE AND LOVE. Sooth 'twere a pleasant life to lead, With nothing in the world to do, But just to blow a shepherd's reed The silent seasons through, And just to drive a flock to feedâ Sheep, quiet, fond, and few! Pleasant to breathe beside a brook, And count the bubbles-love-worlds-there; To muse upon some minstrel's book, Or watch the haunted air; To slumber in some leafy nook- Or, idle anywhere. And then a draught of nature's wine, A meal of summer's daintiest fruit; To take the air with forms divine; Clouds, silvery, cool, and mute; Descending, if the night be fine, In a star-parachute. Give me to live with love alone, And let the world go dine and dress; For love hath lowly haunts-a stone Holds something meant to bless. If life's a flower, I choose my ownâ 'Tis âLove in Idleness!â 1831. THE MAGIC OF NIGHT. Maiden arise from the darkness of sleep, The night is enchanted, the silence is deep; Open thine eyelids, awake to a gleam Brighter than ever yet burst on a dream. Sweet though thy vision be, fair as a star, Here is a vision more exquisite far; Oh! look at yon hill, while the blue mist above Is wreathing around itâan image of love. Now glance below on the sparkling bay, And the ship that severs its star-led way; And the moon that stops, like a beautiful bride, To look at her face in the tranquil tide. And mark how far the heaven is strewn With courtier-clouds that worship the moon, While others lie snowy and still through the night, Like a myriad wings all ready for flight. Earth seems an Eden unstained by crime, So pure is the scene, and so holy the time; Tempest is now with the winds upcurled, And Nature and Night are alone in the world. The numbered sands of time seem run, And Earth and her Heaven are mingling in one, The light, like love, is silent and deep,â Maiden, is this an hour for sleep? 1831. SIMPLICITY. Gently, gently yet, young stranger! Light of heart and light of heel; Ere the bird perceives its danger, On it slyly steal. Silence! ha! your scheme is failingâ No; pursue your pretty prey; See, your shadow on the paling Startles it away. Hush! your step some note is giving; Not a whisperânot a breath; Watchful be as aught that's living, And be mute as death! Glide on ghost-like, still inclining Downwards o'er it, as sure As the sun is on us shining, Till escape the lure. Caution! now you're nearer creeping; Nearer yetâhow still it seems! Sure the winged creature's sleeping, Wrapt in forest dreams! Golden sights that bird is seeing, Nest of green on mossy bough; Not a thought it hath of fleeingâ Yes, you'll catch it now. How your eyes begin to twinkle, Silence, and you'll scarcely fail; Now stoop down and softly sprinkle Salt upon its tail. Yes, you have it in your tether, Never more to skim the skies; Lodge the salt on this long feather,â Ha! it flies, it flies. Hear it! hark! among the bushes, Laughing at your idle lures. Boy, the selfsame feeling gushes Through my heart and yours; Baffled sportsman, childish mentor, How have I been, hapless fault, Led like you, my hopes to centre In a grain of salt. Time, thy feathers turn to arrows; I for salt have used thy sand, Wasting it on hopes like sparrows, That elude the hand. On what captives I've been counting Stooping here and creeping there, All to see my bright hope mounting High into the air. Half my life I've been pursuing, Plans often tried before; Rhapsodies that end in ruin, I and thousands more. This, young sportsman, be your warning, Though you've lost some hours to day, Others spend their life's fair warning, In no wiser way. What hath been my holiest treasure? What were ye unto my eyes? Love and peace, and hope and pleasure, Birds of Paradise. Spirits that we think to capture, By a false and childish scheme, Until tears dissolve our rapture, Darkness ends our dream. Thus are objects loved the dearest, Distant as the dazzling star; And when we appear the nearest, Farthest off we are. Thus have children of all ages, Seeing bliss before them fly, Found their hearts but empty cages, And their hopes on high. 1831. MOORLAND MARY. Maid of the Moorlands, rambling girl, Thy lotâthough lone and drear, perchance, It seemeth unto those that whirl Their hours away in Luxury's dance, And leave the flowers, to dive for pearl, And make their lives one feverish tranceâ Thy natural lot is happier far, Far richer in all natural treasures, Than theirs who scorn it often are; Thou heir of Nature's purer pleasures, Companion of the sun and star, Fond dancer to aÃ«rial measures! Two little damsels once I knew, Two maidens born amongst the moors; And as their infant lifetime flew, Came Joy, and opened wide her doors; And linked, in sweet affections true, They played upon the grassy floors. And every lengthening blade of grass Grew in their eyes more queenly there; The wild-bird's note scarce seemed to passâ Their answering hearts renewed the air: And then they sought the brook's clear glass, And laughed, to see how like they were? At length, when they were seven years old, Unto the hut that gave them birth A lady came, clad all in gold, And gems, and silks of precious worth; And when her purpose there she told, Dim, dark, was all their sunny mirth. She came to part what love designed To grow together, nurslings rare Of nature, who their hopes had twined, And mingled like the rainbow'd air. Now one is gone, one left behind, Most sweet delightâmost sad despair! And she, the moorland maiden, torn From natureâshe is sent to school; Her spirit of its wildness shorn, Is chained by prudence and by rule; Forgets she her who stands forlorn To see one face within the pool? Ah! can it be? Years glide apace, And she is taught what ladies learn; She loves to see her own fair face, All finer love hath ceased to burn. In heart, in air, who now can trace The rambler through the grass and fern! She gave up peace for pride; each day (A golden feather from Time's wing) Brought new delights that fled away; To each her spirit tried to cling, The snares of art around her lay, And nature seemed a vulgar thing. But she, the untamed moorland child, Left lone behind, Joy's gipsy daughter, Still rambled onward, wise as wild, And ne'er forgot what truth had taught her. Oft, oft she sought, with musings mild, Her sister's image in the water. Still, as she grew, the wood, the hill, The heavens, a heavier aspect wore; An angel child she seemeth still, Hoping, and innocent, and poor. âGrow, wild-flowers,â said she, âwhere ye will, I find a gardenâon the moor!â 1833. STANZAS. When stars forsake the sullen sea, When rains descend and winds arise, Some rock a sunny bower may be, If Hope but lend us eyes. It tracks our steps in every stage, And wakes a fountain in the wild; It mingles, with the thoughts of age, The rapture of a child. It sheds on Joy a richer glow, It flings to want its gifts of gold; But oh! its handâas pure as snowâ Will sometimes prove as cold! Yet when the graces fall from youth, And Passion's fervid cheek grows pale, Then Hope becomes a thing of truthâ A faith too deep to fail. 1834. MELODY Ã LA MOORE. Oh! give me not unmeaning smiles, Though cloud-like cares may fly before them; But let me see the sweet blue isles Of radiant eyes when tears wash o'er them. Though small the fount where they begin, They form 'tis thought in many a sonnet, A flood to drown our sense of sin; But ah! Love's ark still floats upon it. Then give me tearsâoh! hide not one; The best affections are but flowers, That faint beneath the fervid sun, And languish once a day for showers. Yet perils lurk in every gemâ For tears are worse than swords in slaughter; And men are still subdued by them, As humming-birds are shot with water! 1835. LOVE. That boy will be the death of me. âCharles Mathews. It is not on the mountain, nor in palaces of pride, That Love will fold his wings up and joyfully abide; In meek and humble natures his home is ever found, As the lark that sings in heaven builds its nest upon the ground. His voice is as the music in the breath of summer heard, Oh Love is often shaken by the whisper of a word; His smile is in the sunshine, and his laughter in the glades, Oh that winter should o'ertake him with its silence and its shades. 1835. THE SHADOWS OF LOVE. 1835. As a rose-leaf may tincture The breast with its hue, So Love's golden cincture Must darken it too. Yet light are the troubles That sadden its mirth, As the smooth water-bubbles That break in their birth. The shade on his temples His bright locks diffuse; And the tears in his dimples, What are they but dews? The slightest thing made, Though fragile and tender, Hath always a shade To await on its splendour. And how should Love's tone Have exemption from grief, When a shadow is thrown From the lily's clear leaf? THE MOTHER'S HOPE. Heaven lies about us in our infancy.âWordsworth. Is there, where the winds are singing In the happy summer-time, Where the raptured air is ringing With Earth's music heavenward springing, Forest-chirp and village-chime; Is there, of the sounds that float Minglingly, a single note Half so sweet, and clear, and wild, As the laughter of a child? Listen; and be now delighted. Morn hath touched her golden strings, Earth and sky their vows have plighted, Life and light are reunited, Amid countless carollings; Yet, delicious as they are, There's a sound that's sweeter farâ One that makes the heart rejoice More than all-the human voice! Organ, finer, deeper, clearer, Though it be a stranger's tone; Than the winds or waters dearer, More enchanting to the hearer, For it answereth his own. But of all its witching words, Sweeter than the songs of birds, Those are sweetest, bubbling wild Through the laughter of a child. Harmonies from time-touched towers, Haunted strains from rivulets, Hum of bees among the flowers, Rustling leaves, and silver showersâ These, ere long, the ear forgets; But in mine there is a sound Ringing on the whole year round; Heart-deep laughter that I heard, Ere my child could speak a word. Ah.! 'twas heard by ear far purer, Fondlier formed to catch the strainâ Ear of one whose love is surer; Hers, the mother, the endurer Of the deepest share of pain; Hers the deepest bliss, to treasure Memories of that cry of pleasure; Hers to hoard, a lifetime after, Echoes of that infant laughter. Yes, a mother's large affection Hears with a mysterious sense; Breathings that evade detection, Whisper faint, and fine inflexion, Thrill in her with power intense. Childhood's honied tones untaught Heareth she, in loving thought! Tones that never thence depart, For she listensâwith her heart! 1835. MALIBRAN IS DEAD. Oh Music, Passion, Truth! Oh Love, and Hope, and Youth! What sudden shadows are around ye clinging! Unstrung is Nature's lute, For Malibran is mute, While yet the air is with her sweet voice ringing. These echoes of the past, Ah! will they be the last, These echoes of her death-notes upward rising! Sounds charming every sense With sweetness so intense, Are they to end in silence more surprising? Oh, God! that life should float On many a golden note, When the sweet singer's lips have changed to ashes! That we should see (as now I see her fine pale brow) Things that have passed away like lightning-flashes. We doubt the cruel ill And see and hear her still Who made the very heart leap up delighted; But soon the instinctive tear Betrays the spirit's fear, And the sick heart sinks back again affrighted. And tear shall follow tear, Low wailing meet the ear, Deep sudden awe chill many an eager city; And natures wild and rude, By grateful thoughts subdued, Melt into songs of praise, or sighs of pity. But love shall have an end And tears no more descend, Ere man shall look on a diviner creature; More free to give delight, More star-like to our sight, Of soul more rapt, or of more radiant feature. Oh never, never more Will Nature's self restore The treasure vanished like a star swift falling, Down to the deep it goes In hushed and dark repose, Leaving the wondering gazer vainly calling. Yes, all that world of life, Of passion and wild strife, The strife of soul, the ecstasy of feeling; That mind which held the mirth Of Eden more than earthâ That world of life the grave is now concealing. Yet no; for of that eye The true light cannot die; And of that lip no passing smile can perish! Oh! not a nameless grace Of intellect or face, But magic Genius makes the memory cherish. Her voice, Love's unseen lute, Oh! say it is not mute; Still, still within us is its music ringing; Long may we hear in her Our heart's interpreter, Long hoard the marvels of her matchless singing. 1836. THE DANCE OF THE PEASANTS. (In the âWinter's Tale.â) Good is as hundreds, evil as one; Round about goeth the golden sun. Leigh Hunt's Captain Sword and Captain Pen. Sleepest thou, Sufferer? âSleep denies The balm of her visions to weeping eyes. Yet worn with pain and faint with fears, Oh sweet, sweet Sorrower!âeven in tears, The heart may behold Glad visions unfold, An Eden of Love to illumine our years. Glance for a moment around the gloom, Silent and deep, of this curtained room. The sphere of our grief, is it wilder than this? Now gaze on the landscape, the light that we miss. Nought seemeth to grieve This rich summer-eve, Oh, bliss should be ours when looking on bliss! The circle of life, how large! Alas, For him who perceives but a single class; Who views this beautiful world with eyes Untaught to admire and sympathise, By lessons of love, Beneath and above, Flowers on the earth and stars in the skies! A single flower, a single star, Breathing beside us, beaming afar, Has a thousand gazers; whilst thousands moan, As human happiness dies unknown. I cannot repine, If joy may be mine By making the joy of others mine own. Delights are ever about and around, Cunningly hidden, yet easily found; Pleasures refined, yet sweet to the crowd; Common, yet precious as pure to the proud: Sympathies fine, Ennobling, divine, Courting as mutely, or carolling loud. A fond illusion, a shadow, may bless The soul with the balm of forgetfulness. Gaze, mourner, again from this dim nook of night; The landscape-behold, it is beamingly bright With the forms and features Of Phantasy's creatures; Yet living, and real, and breathing delight! Call them not phantasies, false as fair; Humanities only are revelling there. The spell of the Poet hath given them birth; Yet poetry is but the voice of our earth, Relating to Time, In a music sublime, On vanity, glory, affliction, and mirth. Can poetry brighten the midday blue, Or give to the grass a greener hue? 'Twas as futile to gild the lustre Love flings Upon life, or the halo which Charity brings, Or the bright footprint Of Peace, or the tint Of Hope's untamed, untiring wings. Oh, then not false, this forest scene, Where these, Life's Genii, gladdens the green; Where Labour leaps up and laughs in play, And Age and Youth hold holiday; Where fond eyes glisten, And hushed hearts listen; While gazing, are we less happy than they? The world is to them, with its sun and shade, For hours together-that grassy glade; To them is Death but a deep love-trance, And the progress of Life but the maze of a dance; And Heaven rejoices While human voices Breathe truth in the tones of sweet romance. They feel that of eves like this are born The golden pleasures of many a morn; For, trials and toils for a time forgot, Bright memories spring from the fairy spot. Oh! well they know How a single day Of leisure may lighten a dreary lot. For they are the Poor! the peasant-roots Of the social tree, and of all its fruits; And they prize the flowers that are dropp'd by the throng, And smile on their weeds, and pass lightly along; The joys which they court Of game or of sport, Are stimulants generous, subtle, and strong. And she Perdita. who sitteth, but not aloneâ That maiden-queen on her simple throneâ There, with a natural beauty crowned, Shedding a brightness over the groundâ Amidst the praise Of many lays, Distinguishing one love murmuring sound. When stranger lips shall say how she May match in blood with sovereignty, Will she, who, among this peasant race, See fondness and truth in every face, Be more a queen, In soul or mien, Than here in her sylvan dwelling-place? But she with a heart untrained to cool Its warm emotions by courtly rule, Will smile on the peasant's dance and lay, And cheer him to prolong his play; Yon shepherd-boy, Who pipes for joy, May pipe perchance an hour a day. Hers will it be to fling the door Of gladness open to all the poor, To seek the peasant's pathway bare, And plant a rose or two here and there; Her loving hand Shall strew the land With the simple pleasures that all may share. Hers, too, to teach how treasure is lost By gaining treasures at others' cost; How luxury pines when pine the Poor; Like him who destroyed his garden-store Of blossoms and trees, That his neighbour's bees Might gather their honey there no more. Oh! beautiful vision, thanks to thee, For showing how happy the humble may be; How little is wanting to gild the gloom Of Industry toiling its way to the tomb! For a spirit is there In that greenwood fair, The limb to sustain and the mind to illume. Comfort thee, mourner! commonest things Often contain most delicate springs; The loveliest forms are not the rarest, Costliest joys are seldom fairest; The garden shines More than the mines; To hope is to haveâyet thou despairest? Who cannot count, the dreariest here, A hundred smiles for every tear? The pleasure of others lessens our pain, And memory multiplies all again. Nature is kind! Shall we be blind, When even her dreams are not woven in vain! 1836. THE YOUNG GLEANER. Her task had been a weary one, To stoop all day for ears of corn; All day beneath the harvest-sun; Yet looks she not forlorn. Her feet are sore, her limbs are weak, She leans fatigued against the stile; Her lips are parched, and yet her cheek Half dimples with a smile. Although her task is done, although Her arms have dropped their yellow store, Her heart, untired, would freely go Back to the field for more. The spirit of the girl is glad, You see it looking through her eyes; Sweet Gleaner, she could not be sad Beneath such lovely skies. Though wide the field, though hot the ground, To gather up her golden spoil, While Heaven seemed smiling all around, Was pleasure more than toil. The morning breeze, the midday calm, The shower, the blue that o'er her shone, She felt them on her heart as balm, And sung and gathered on. To glean what those who gleaned before Had left, seemed all her soul desired; And till her long day's task was o'er, She knew not she was tired. And now, what waits her homeward way? Delicious rest and slumbers deep; These three compose her night and day, Sweet toil, sweet rest, sweet sleep. Oh! blest, midst those whom man's hard will Condemns to slavery's ceaseless care, Are ye who, task-worn, labour still Out in the open air! Gleaner, thy grief may be assuaged, Compared with hers thy tasks are mild, That trampled flower, that bird encaged, The pent-up Factory child. 1836. SONG FOR SHAKSPEARE'S BIRTHDAY. April 23, 1836. AirâNora Creina. Ever since the dawn of time, Have poets told their sylvan stories; Gemming life with truths sublime, And crowning man with living glories. Sweet their strains, but far less dear Than his to whom all shapes were given; Now a breathing violet here, And now a streaming star in Heaven. Oh! the vast, the varied mind, The all-encircling line of Shakspeare, Nature yet must feel regret At losing himâthe gentle Shakspeare. Oh! the brightest flame of life, It burns in those who most adore him; Envy, hatred, gloom, and strife, Like snow melt all away before him. All his mighty mind was loveâ Ah! sure his pen was once a feather In the wing of Noah's dove, It brings us so in peace together. Oh! the sweetness of his song, The music and the mirth of Shakspeare; Golden word was never heard Like thy all-echoed name, Will Shakspeare! O'er the mind his magic breathed, And still it leaves a charm within it, As Apollo's harp bequeathed Its music where it lay a minute. Time shall never still the tone, Nor e'er of radiant wreaths deprive him, Nature was his nurse alone, And Nature only can survive him. Oh! the green, the glorious page, The everlasting line of Shakspeare; Millions meet with praises sweet Around the sunny shrine of Shakspeare. THE CHILD AND HER CAPTIVE. âBird, you are mine!â said a bird-like child, Ardent, graceful, sensitive, wild; âI am your mistress, you are my own; Caught on the window-sill where you had flown. âHere in this cage, all glittering, new, Bought, you must know, on purpose for you, With leaves and seeds, and water to drink, You must be always happy, I think.â With many a sweetly-prattled word The child saluted her captive bird; With glistening eyes for hours she gazed, And wondered he sang not while she praised. âSing, my bird!â And all day long Her ears were open to catch the song. In vainâ'twas surely a singular thing That a bird so happy refused to sing! Morning again. Ah, now his throat Will swell with many an exquisite note! Silent! How strange that a bird should be Mute in a cage who sang on a tree! Again she listened her morning away; And listened, and wondered, day by day; His cage was darkened, his sugar was stoppedâ Still not a chirrup the prisoner dropped. A spell is upon him; 'tis sunny spring; He has nothing on earth to do but sing. Hark! What a note! Was it his? You see The singer out there on the apple-tree. The child is asleep. As her eyelids close, Thousands of wires in golden rows, Gleaming like sunbeams, shot from the ground, And forming a circle, encaged her round. That graceful, playful, laugh-loving child, She who but now might ramble wild From sport to sport of her innocent age; Ah! she is caught, like a bird in her cage. Quite, quite shut in; she scarce respires, Her heart is pierced by those sharp gold-wires; But a giant Bird is her keeper the while, And she must gambol, and sing, and smile! The glorious noon seems deep midnight; But the child's despair is the bird's delight; And she must lament, the whole day long, Her freedom lostâin laughter and song. The child is awake; and, with eager hands On the window-sill the cage she stands; She opens the door; the bird is free! Hark! how he sings on the apple-tree. 1836. THE GAME AT CHESS. Love with a Ladyâwould you know Her name, then read this heart, for there 'Tis written, like the words of woe, Imprinted in the hyacinth fairâ Love with a Lady played-but where, Or when, or how, 'tis yours to guess, Enough if we this truth declare, Love with a Lady played at Chess! Most innocent, and calm, and high The mind which in that Lady's face Was mirrored, as the morning-sky In a clear brook's green dwelling-place, And, robed in each serenest grace, She mused, more tranquil than the dove; So there, as time grew on apace, The Lady played at Chess with Love. 'Twas like a dream to see them play; So deeply, marvellously still, And hushed in charmed thought sat they, One influence of the tyrant will Controlling both for well or ill! And surely in that silentness, Angels, on heaven's own azure hill, Watched the sweet pair who played at Chess. But see, a smile succeeds to doubt In her fair eyes-they see âthe move;â And swift as thought she stretches out Her small white hand, without a glove, And moves the pieceâbelow, above, Across on all sides, unafraid, Joy in her soul; and thus with Love Her game at Chess the Lady played. What is the world, and what is life, To her whose heart is in the grave! The bliss of that ungenerous strife Is dear to her as health or fame! With whomsoe'er she plays, the same, E'en losing has some power to bless; And were Love dead, she'd feel no shame To sit with Hatred down to Chess. Love, brooding o'er the board, grows dull, And, beaten, seems but half awake; Her hope meanwhile grows ripe and full, She takes whate'er she wills to take; When lo! what nothings sometimes make A mighty shock! That Lady's lip Quivers with some convulsive acheâ Her hand just touched Love's finger-tip. Her heedless hand! while wandering o'er, Eager to snatch the ivory prize, It touched Love's lightly, onceâno more! How can a touch thus paralyse? How flush her cheek, how fire her eyes? How fill her soul with sweet distress, Delight, despair, beyond disguise, And make her loseâthat game at Chess? His eyes had been on hers for hours, Yet knew she not that Love had gazed; His breath had warmed her cheek's rich flowers, And still these thoughts were all unraised. Now sits she like a thing amazed; Her chance at every move grows less; She plays at randomâone so crazed Ne'er lost or gained a game at Chess. Thoughts of the player now crowd above Thoughts of the game, that else would press; She only feels she plays with Love, She does not know she plays at Chess. Her dog might spring with mild caress, Mother or sister tilt the board, And she know no emotion less, Or more, of all her heart must hoard! King, Queen, that heart hath quite forgot; No Knight hath sway there, but a swain; No Castle seeks she, but a cot; No Bishop, but a curate plain. Such is Love's fine electric chain; One touch has done it! Need he sue? No; ere he'd time to touch again, He'd won the gameâand Lady too! 1841. THE DOUBLE LESSON. Maiden of Padua, on thy lap Thus lightly let the volume lie; And as within some pictured map Fair isles and waters we descry, Trace out, with white and gliding finger, Along the truth-illumined page, Its golden lines and words that linger In memory's cell, from youth to age. The young Preceptor at thy side Had pupil ne'er before so fair; And though that scholar be thy guide, He sits that fellow-learner there. As every page unfolds its meaning, As every rustling leaf turns o'er, He finds, whilst o'er thy studies leaning, Beauty where all was dull before. Familiar is the book to him, A record of heroic deed; Yet deems he now his eyes were dim, And thine have taught them first to read. Now fades in him the scholar's glory; For he would give the fame he sought, With thee to read the simplest story, And learn what sages never taught. The precious wealth of countless books, Lies stowed within his grasping mind; Yet should he not peruse thy looks, He now were more than Ignorance blind. From many a language, old, enchanting, Rare truths to nations he unrolls; But one old language yet was wanting, The one you teach himâ'tis the soul's. Full long this lesson, Pupil fair! All pupils else hath he forsook; He draws still nearer to thy chair, And bends yet closer o'er the book. As time flies on, now fast, now fleeter, More slowly is the page turned o'er; The lesson seems to both the sweeter, And more enchanting grows the lore. The book now yields a tenderer theme; The Master loses all his art, The Pupil droops as in a dream, And both are reading with one heart. His eyes upraised a moment glisten With hope, and joy, and fear profound; While thine, oh, Maiden! do they listen? They seem to hear his sigh's faint sound! But hark! what sound indeed breaks through The silence of that life-long hour! Melodious tinklings, such as sue For favour near a lady's bower. Ah! Maid of Padua, music swelling In tribute to thy radiant charms, Now greets thee in thy father's dwelling, To woo thee from a father's arms. The suitor comes with song and lute, Youth, riches, pleasures, round him wait; Go bid him, Paduan Maid, be mute, Thy lot is cast, he comes too late! One lesson given, and one received, The Book prevails, the Lute's denied; With love thy inmost heart has heaved, And thou shalt be a student's bride. 1842. SONNET. Given in 1843 to Westby Gibson, the Peasant-Bard of Sherwood. Sweet Peasant-Bard of that renowned old wood Where in the by-past time with his wild crew, Deep in some moonlight dingle dashed with dew, Slept that unpurpled king, bold Robin Hood: Welcome, e'en as a brother dear in blood, Thou gentle pilgrim of the good and true, Led by fond Poesy, by pathways new, Piping meanwhile in merry-hearted mood: Soul-charmed I listen when thy strains are heard, Bright spirit, of all thy sylvan birthright shorn, Bound to the desk's dead wood like some caged bird, The wild night through still challenging bright morn, Heaven grant when thy young life grows passion-stirred, The songs of thy full heart shall hide no rankling thorn. THE SIMPLEST CHARM PREVAILS. I did hear you talk Far above singing. Beaumont and Fletcher. I saw her dance, and wish'd the night were longer To feast my eyes with motion, more and more; But when she simply walked, the spell grew stronger, And never had I seen true grace before. I heard her sing, and welcomes seemed to greet her From airy lips and lyres, in grove and glen; But when she simply spoke, the charm was sweeter, The soul of melody was mute till then. I saw her weep, and with a beauty finer Than solemn Night's her starry brow was crowned; But when she smiled, her face grew still diviner, And light like Morning's flashed on all around. 1843. OLD REMEMBRANCE. With song the wood was ringing When first of love we talked, One wild bird midst his singing, Seemed listening while we walked; All May-like was the weather, Though gold was on the grain, As our hearts first drew together In the old green lane. That spring-light still is round us, That bird attends our way; The chain in which love bound us, Is noiseless as we stray. In gay haunts now abiding We falter not, nor feign, For still we seem but gliding Through the old green lane. We dwell in places crowded, But yet we live alone; The more our thoughts are shrouded, The more are they our own. The worldly path is steeper That tempts the bold and vain; But our hearts for pleasures deeper Seek the old green lane. From youth to age unchilling, Thus onward will we stroll, Our earthly course fulfilling, As soul were linked to soul. And still at last, late sinking, Shall we, midst wind and rain, Find shelter most when thinking Of the old green lane. 1843. SPACEâTIME. Amidst the crowd a minstrel sang, And touched a string of finest sound; Unheard, for clamour rudely rang, And envious discord music drowned. A spot, some distance off I choseâ And sweetness crept along the air! Above the din the music roseâ I heard the minstrel there! Too often this the poet's lot: He sings to present time in vain, With crowds around him, hearkening not, All careless mirth or loud disdain. But when a distant day has blushed Above the rude tumultuous throng, The clamour of an age is hushedâ Then wakes the sleeping song! 1843. THE ELOQUENT PASTOR DEAD. Lament not for the vanished! Earth to him Is now a faltering star, far off and dim, And Life a spectre, volatile and grim. Weep not, ye mourners, for the great one lost! Rich sunshine lies beyond this night of frostâ Our troubles are not worth the tears they cost. Give forth the song of love, the steadfast vowâ No tear! for Death and he are parted now, And life sits throned on his conscious brow. Oh, mourn not! Yet remember what has beenâ How buoyantly he trod this troubled scene, The pathways of his spirit always green! He taught the cheerfulness that still is ours, The sweetness that still lurks in human powers; If Heaven be full of stars, the earth has flowers! His was the searching thought, the glowing mind; The gentle will to others' soon resigned; But more than all, the feeling just and kind. His pleasures were as melodies from reedsâ Sweet books, deep music, and unselfish deeds, Finding immortal flowers in human weeds. His soul was a vast sea, wide, clear, serene, Deep in whose breast the mirror'd Heaven was seen, Yet picturing Earth, and all her valleys green. Fancy was his, and learning, and fine sense: Were these the secret of his power intense? No; it was Love that gave him eloquence. Sweet were his words; the lark's song high above They rivalled now, and now the forest-dove; The various tones had one inspirerâLove! His brow illumined with the sage's fire, His voice, out-ringing like a poet's lyreâ The aged heard a friend, the child a sire. True to his kind, nor of himself afraid, He deemed that love of God was best arrayed In love of all the things that God has made. He deemed Man's life no feverish dream of care, But a high pathway into freer air Lit up with golden hopes and duties fair. He showed how Wisdom turns its hours to years, Feeding the heart on joys instead of fears, And worships God in smiles, and not in tears. His thoughts were as a pyramid up-piled, On whose far top an angel stood and smiledâ Yet, in his heart, was he a simple child. 1843. THE GREAT CHRISTMAS FIRE. The Eye of the Room. Of old we've learnt A log half-burnt Was saved to kindle next year's blaze; The brand meanwhile That lights the pile, Had lit the fires of elder days. Thus through the dark, While flash and spark Linked year to year, and flame to flame, They lessons leave To all that grieveâ How hearts and souls may burn the same. The log we light Is memory bright, Heaped up with scorching, crackling joy; The brand that litâ Old games, old witâ Romps, known when Man was but a Boy! 1845. CHRISTMAS ALWAYS. A street cry is heardâthe voice of an Earth-spirit. âChristmas comes but once a year!â âWho so sings of Christmas here? CHILD Christmas comes back every year; Where goes Christmas, father dear? Why not let sweet Christmas stay, Keeping Christmas day by day! Since the blaze will always spread, Since the berry's always red, Since this blue flame's always bright, Should not hearts be always light! CRY âChristmas comes but once a year!â âSing not so of Christmas dear! FATHER From the heart when Christmas flies, Want and avarice, fear and lies, Hold their place, with toil and pain, Until Christmas comes again! Goingâcoming!âyet while you, Loving earth, to heaven are true; Count three hundred sixty-five, So many days shall Christmas thrive! CRY âChristmas comes but once a year!â âTruth, sweet truth, oh, sing it clear! OLD MAN Once a year its bounty floweth, Hither, hitherâonce it goeth. Once it comes to bless us all, Once, and makes no second call. Why! because each spirit fine Keeps its Christmas always! Mine Ends at twelve o'clockâno moreâ On December twenty-four! Ever here, oh! ever here! Christmas time is all the year! 1845.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II.POEMS OF HUMOUR. THE ART OF BOOK-KEEPING. How hard, when those who do not wish To lend, that's lose, their books, Are snared by anglersâfolks that fish With literary hooks; Who call and take some favourite tome, But never read it through; They thus complete their set at home, By making one at you. Behold the bookshelf of a dunce Who borrowsânever lends; Yon work, in twenty volumes, once Belonged to twenty friends. New tales and novels you may shut From viewâ'tis all in vain; They're goneâand though the leaves are âcutâ They never âcome again.â For pamphlets lent I look around, For tracts my tears are spilt; But when they take a book that's bound, 'Tis surely extra-guilt. A circulating library Is mineâmy birds are flown; There's one odd volume left, to be Like all the rest, a-lone. I, of my âSpenserâ quite bereft, Last winter sore was shaken; Of âLambâ I've but a quarter left, Nor could I save my âBacon.â My âHallâ and âHillâ were levelled flat, But âMooreâ was still the cry; And then, although I threw them âSprat,â They swallowed up my âPye.â O'er everything, however slight, They seized some airy trammel; They snatched my âHoggâ and âFoxâ one night, And pocketed my âCampbell.â And then I saw my âCrabbeâ at last, Like Hamlet's, backward go; And as my tide was ebbing fast, Of course I lost my âRowe.â I wondered into what balloon My books their course had bent; And yet, with all my marvelling, soon I found my âMarvellâ went. My âMalletâ served to knock me down, Which makes me thus a talker; And once, while I was out of town, My âJohnsonâ proved a âWalker.â While studying o'er the fire one day My âHobbesâ amidst the smoke; They bore my âColmanâ clean away, And carried off my âCoke.â They picked my âLocke,â to me far more Than Bramah's patent's worth; And now my losses I deplore, Without a âHomeâ on earth. If once a book you let them lift, Another they conceal, For though I caught them stealing âSwift,â As swiftly went my âSteele.â âHopeâ is not now upon my shelf, Where late he stood elated; But, what is strange, my âPopeâ himself Is excommunicated. My little âSucklingâ in the grave Is sunk, to swell the ravage; And what 'twas Crusoe's fate to save 'Twas mine to loseâa âSavage.â Even âGlover'sâ works I cannot put My frozen hands upon; Though ever since I lost my âFoote,â My âBunyanâ has been gone. My âHoyleâ with âCottonâ went; oppressed, My âTaylorâ too must fail; To save my âGoldsmithâ from arrest, In vain I offered âBayle.â I âPriorâ sought, but could not see The âHoodâ so late in front; And when I turned to hunt for âLee,â Oh! where was my âLeigh Huntâ! I tried to laugh, old care to tickle, Yet could not âTickellâ touch ; And then, alas! I missed my âMickle,â And surely mickle's much. 'Tis quite enough my griefs to feed, My sorrows to excuse, To think I cannot read my âReidâ Nor even use my âHughes.â To âWest,â to âSouth,â I turn my head, Exposed alike to odd jeers; For since my âRoger Ascham'sâ fled, I ask 'em for my âRogers.â They took my âHorneââand âHorne Tookeâ too, And thus my treasures flit; I feel when I would âHazlittâ view, The flames that it has lit. My word's worth little, âWordsworthâ gone, If I survive its doom; How many a bard I doated on Was swept offâwith my âBroome.â My classics would not quiet lie, A thing so fondly hoped; Like Dr. Primrose, I may cry, âMyâLivyâ has eloped!â My life is wasting fast awayâ I suffer from these shocks; And though I've fixed a lock on âGray,â There's grey upon my locks. I'm far from youngâam growing paleâ I see my âButterâ fly; And when they ask about my ail, 'Tis âBurton!â I reply. They still have made me slight returns, And thus my griefs divide; For oh! they've cured me of my âBurns,â And eased my âAkenside.â But all I think I shall not say, Nor let my anger burn; For as they never found me âGay,â They have not left me âSterne.â 1830. THE EPITAPH OF 1830. Here lie, although shorn of their rays, In the family vault of old Time, Three hundred and sixty-five days Of folly, pride, glory, and crime. You may mourn o'er their miseries still, You may dance o'er their desolate bier; You may laugh, you may weep, as you willâ Eighteen Hundred and Thirty lies here. It brought us some good on its wings, Much ill has it taken away; For it gave us the best of sea-kings, And darkened the conqueror's day. It narrowed Corruption's dominion, And crushed Aristocracy's starch, Gave nerve to that giant, Opinion, And spurred up old Mind on his march. It drew a new line for Court morals, Laid hands on the Pensioner's treasure, And told usâwe'll crown it with laurelsâ Reform is a Cabinet-measure. It brought, to the joy of each varlet, Both sides of a coat into play; For it stripped off the faded old Scarlett, And turned the Court-livery Grey! It set all the sycophants sighing, And taught them to blush and look shy; It made, though unfitted for flying, Proh pudor! a Marchioness fly. How many it found looking big, Till it plucked out the feathers they wore, On the Woolsack it placed such a Whig As had ne'er graced the Woolsack before. It brought Captain Swing in a flame, With his wild game of fright to our cost; While, skilled in a different game, Surgeon Long played a rubberâand lost. It gratified Hunt in his thirst To sit as a patriot member; And it brought us back April the first, When we thought it the ninth of November. And oh! it made Freedom the fashion In Franceâwho can ne'er have too much, And who put all the rest in a passionâ The Russians, Poles, Belgians, and Dutch! Let this be the end of its story; May the Year that now breaks o'er its tomb, Have a gleam or two more of its glory, A shade or two less of its gloom. ON FIRST SEEING THE PORTRAIT OF L.E.L. âLife and Literary Remains of L.E.L.,â by Laman Blanchard. Is this the face that fired a thousand ships, And burned the topless towers of Illium! Sweet Helen!â Marlowe. âAh no! not Helen, Hel-e-n Of oldâbut L.E.L.; Those letters which the spell-bound pen Have vainly sought to spell. âNot Helen, who so long ago Set Paris in a blaze; But one who laid proud London low, And lit up later days. âIs this your meaning mystic Three! Hand-writing on Fame's wall! Ye thrice fair letters, can ye be A lady, after all? âHow have I wondered what ye meant, Ye alphabetic Graces! And so you really represent One of dear Nature's faces! âHow, how I've guessed! Your meaning rare No guessing seemed to touch; Ye riddles! the weird sisters ne'er Bewitched me half so much. âOne knows the power of D.C.L.; The grandeur of K.G.; And F.R.S. will science spell, And valour G.C.B. âThe sage, the schoolboy, both can tell The worth of L.S.D.; But then the worth of L.E.L.! All letters told in three! âIn vain I've sought to illustrate Each letter with a word; 'Twas only trying to translate The language of a bird. âI've read ye, L.E.L., quite bare; ThusâLogic, Ethics, Lays; Lives, Episodes, and Lyrics fairâ. I've guessed away my days. âOne wild young fancy was the sire Of fifty following after; Like theseâLove, Eden, and the Lyre. Light, Elegance, and Laughter. âI've drawn from all the stars that shine Interpretations silly; From flowersâthe Lily, Eglantine, And then another Lily. âNow fancy's dead; no thought can strike, No guess, solution, stricture; And L.E.L. isâsimply like This dainty little picture. These lines were originally written to a portrait of L.E.L. âLife to her lays! However Fame 'Mongst brightest names may set hers, These three initialsânameless nameâ Shall never be dead letters!â 1832. APOSTROPHE TO THE APPROACHING COMET. âIt may be considered as tolerably certain that the comet will become visible in every part of Europe about the latter end of August, or beginning of September next. . . . Will cross the meridian near the zenith of London about sunrise.ââEdinburgh Review. The end of August! Potentate august, Is that the period settled for your visit? Is that indeed the time when life's short crust Must be consumedâbakedâburnt to cinders? Is Then August's âlatter endâ is ours I think, If as your advent you've resolved to fix it; Oh! for a Mediterranean of ink, To blot out the reviewer's ipse dixit! Mediterranean! or blue, or black, Or green, each deep ere long will be a Red-sea; Atlantic, Euxine, Baltic,ânay, alack! The very tide of life will a Dead-sea. For have not several âpagesâ brough us here A piece of news too heavy for a porter,â That thou, within a quarter, wilt appearâ One quarter more, and show us no more quarter! Is it not stated, to astound all earth (And be it fact or falsehood, I've no share in't), That men shall see a strange and fearful Birthâ That thou, O Comet, wilt become a-parent? Terrible tidingsâwonder full of woe! Do these astronomers proclaim it rightly, That thou'lt become a mother? Is it so? And will the prodigy be witnessed nightly? A litter of young comets! Literature At once grows convert to the creed Malthusian, And though unable to prescribe a cure, Deems the new birth a case of clear intrusion. But stay, a letter from Vienna:âwhat? 'Tis said by Herschelâsee the public papersâ The comet seeks a more sequestered lot, And all our fierce volcanoes are mere vapours. Its course quite changedâits orbit not the sameâ That's something yet to make one's horror visible; Yet, ah! not much; we still shall feel its flameâ Danger's not safe because it is invisible. Ah, no! thy tidings, Herschel, even at first, Had been for comfort wholly unavailing; Of two bad tales men always trust the worstâ 'Tis human nature's virtue, not its failing. So! we're to feel no fright, to make no fuss, Because the foe we're not to have a sight of; Accomplished ignorance may reason thus, But comets are not creatures to make light of. Let us be miserable; yes, let us leave To idle boys and philosophic codgers The joys of hope; let us despond and grieveâ âI would not, if I could, be gay,â writes Rogers. Anguish is easier when past all cure; Check not your sorrowâcall it uncontrollable; Grief may be disagreeable; yet endureâ It grows more pleasant when it's inconsolable. Mine be sweet wretchedness and drear despair; Long for this weight of woe I've been a waiter; Troubles we've had, 'tis true, and âtailsâ to spareâ But none like thine, Celestial Agitator! Talk not of fierce Lord Durham, hot-brained Hume, Give each his tail, and Fate may save us from it; What jack-o'-lanterns make us mortals fume, Of Cobbett think notâthink upon comet! Why what's O'Connell? Him we may defy, With all his âjoints,â to shake us in our beds; For Ireland's self may now in candour cry, âYe little tails, hide your diminished heads!â A great enlightner, bidding others cease, Will wag a tail of fire ere summer ceases, Then will the House divideâthen England's peace Will end, in England split into two pieces! I care not what the Tories now endure; Nor what the Whigs have got, nor who have bought'em; Nor when the Radicals will come in sure; Who will, I ask, insure the Thames next autumn? O Press, prodigious âorgan,â cease to blow Your bellows, while the fiery foe's about; But rather, as a mighty âengine,â show, How we're to put the coming comet out. No more about the âMarch,â on August preach; I feel its heatâits glare is on my eye, So ends âmy taleââanother's within reach; My pen is shrivelledâand my ink is dry! 1834. ODE TO THE LITTLE LORD MAYOR. Born November 28. The court of Common Councilmen have appointed a committee to ascertain the most advisable course of testifying their satisfaction at the birth of a son to the Lord Mayor. Oh, infant heir to the new Lord Mayor Thou small edition of Gog, Did ever a son in dark London So shine through November's fog? So rare thy fate, that the City's state No parallel shows to thee; But not more rare than bright and fairâ To be born in the Mayoralty! Now those who can, and those who can't, Thy praises strive to singâ In speech or chorus, chime or chant, To the new-born Mayorling. Clerks in the banks deal out with thanks Their notesâof congratulation; And filled with joys are the grateful boys Who are out of situation. But every Alderman past the chair With envy looks on you; And piously prays for another heir, And another election too. And those not passed with their babes are vexed, As they count the family sum; And would fain postpone the birth of the next, For four or five years to come. And every Deputy, checking his joy, And changing his gladsome tune, Goes home and chides his undutiful boy For being born so soon. Yet Mayors that have been, are to be, And Deputies afar, And Common Councilmen, all agree To hail thee as a star! While all aspire, lo, Mr. Wire Electrifies the City, By moving the court to appoint a sort Of Wir-drawn committee. âAll the Aldermen,â âall the Deps.,â And âa member from each ward,â Are chosen instanter for taking steps To honour their little Lord. And Alderman Scholey deigns to rehearse (Lest you in a cot be laid ill), The custom, and thinks that the City's purse Can afford you a âsilver cradle.â Of solid silver! No plated ware, To make a shabby show; Real cloth of gold shall above thee glare, And silver tissue below. The sword, the mace, shall be thy toys; And all thy infant charms Shall beâoh, greatest of little boys!â Wrapped in the City's arms. And at Guildhall a splendid ball Shall be given when the days are mild; Where all shall fly to hear you cry, Just like a common child. At last, when, after such a spring, You fill the civic chair, London shall choose her Mayorling Perpetual Lord Mayor! 1835. A BRAHAM-ESE BALLAD AirâCampbell's âHohenlinden.â Look, London, but a moment o'er Thy various haunts for rich and poor, In west or east, from shore to shore Of Thamis, rolling muddily! What meets the eye, 'mid shabbier homes But Temples, finer far than Rome's, With gilded words beneath their domes, Of Boxes, Pit, and Gallery! To number them in verse were vainâ The closed up âGarden,â dreary âLane,â The King's, the Queen's, Victoria's fane, And Astley's Amphitheatre; Olympic, where the siren dwells, Adelphi, Surrey, Sadler's Wells, Haymarketâand the foreign spells, Of Arnold's English Opera. A countless host behind! Who stirs To build another, blindly errs; We rear up penny theatres, Instead of penitentiaries. Yet one who wears more laurels than Lieutenant-General Evans can, Now scorns the âstageâ and seeks the âvan,â Commander of a Company. Lo, London, he, you crowned with song, Who charmed your ear and heart so long, Who seemed for time too stout and strongâ The man is turningâManager! Another and another still SucceedsâOh! noâstill fails to fill; No fault of thine; yet let no ill Light on your veteran-vocalist. Let no dull shadow dim his doom; Whether thine own he would illumine, In Feignwould, Rover, Captain Plumeâ Or haply act in Tragedy:â Whether he comes to make his own, The Drama's, or sweet Music's throne; Whether he means to reign alone, Or make his stage an omnibus. Ah, Braham, we will rail no more 'Gainst paying money at the door; Just issue ordersâby the scoreâ The Public's sure to patronise, If notâif still they prove untrue To orders, give refreshments, too; Not iceâno, hit on something newâ Give Coffee, Wine, and Sandwiches! 1835. SOUR GRAPES. I have frequently observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the object of our desire begins to lose its attraction in our eyes.âMr. Collins, in Pride and Prejudice. Those tempting grapes! how rich their hue Amidst the green on which they rest! Their purple blood seems bursting through, As eager to be prest. A bunch of beautyâhue and shapeâ Combined to form their fair designâ A group of fairy globes, each grape A little world of wine. Most beautiful to every sense; The heart drinks pleasure through the eyes; And now its longing grows intenseâ The hand would seize the prize. It seizesâno! but try again, Another catch, on tiptoe tryâ One effort moreâthe hope is vain, They hang so very high. A dreary changeâa chilling shadeâ A sudden breath of blighting power Falls on the grapesâtheir colours fade; The fruit, in fact, is sour. So it is with us, hour by hour, Age after age: and this were meet, If calling sweets beyond us sour Could make our sours more sweet. It may be wise to scorn the prize For which in vain we read or wrote; But wiser far to deem the star Still radiant though remote. If happy he, who, should he miss The fruit, can pass it as pernicious, More blessed his lot, who, losing bliss, Still thinks the grapes delicious; Who sees the crowning cluster, where His hand may reach in two more summers, And laughs, and leaves its sweetness there, A feast for after-comers. 1835. THE LADIES AND THE PARLIAMENT. (Notes of a Rejected Report.) Question: The admission of ladies into the House of Commons. Mr. G?y B?y Sir, I rise under feelings which fathers, and brothers,Grantley Berkeley. Sons, lovers, and cousins, and uncles, and others: The Benedict loving, the bachelor lonely, Will treat with no scoffing but sympathy only. I move that the ladiesâthe source of our joys, Promoters of harmonyâ(Uproar and noise)â I move, Sir, that these, men's enchanters and wizards, Who, daily extracting laced footmen from lizards, May haply convert our debates into wit Oh! oh! and loud cheers)âwe among us admit! I move the provision of seats for the Fair The motion, when seconded, put from the chair). Lord J? R?ll He feared it might lead to impressions, that greatLord John Russell. Alterations were made in the frame-work of State; The country, he thought, would be apt to surmise That ladies had taken the House by surprise, And also their seats in itâthough he could quote The Reform Act to show they had no right to vote. The ladies besidesâhe would here take his standâ Were chiefly Conservative all through the land. Much influence doubtless belonged to bright eyes, And many dark mischiefs were sure to arise. Mr. H?e Unaccustomed to speaking, he begged leave to say,Hume. That women were excellent things in their way; Some, rather expensiveâsome, just the reverseâ He meant, where their husbands had charge of the purse. He wished, ere the motion was carried or lost, To know what the new female benches would cost. The house might cry âoh!â but the other word âpay,â Was just as important at this time of day! In making the seats, if a âdealâ could be saved, The country would see they were not quite depraved. He thought it but right that the ladies should bear The expense; âwell, they couldn't object to a share. It were well could the House at an estimate peep; Though he held women dear, yet he liked their seats cheap. Sir A?w A?w With pain he had listened to this proposition;Sir A. Agnew. He dreaded, should deeply deplore the admission; He felt that the morals of ladiesâ(Hear, hear)â Would be blighted yet more in that masculine sphere. Already their minds were familiar with sin; If tainted when out, how corrupt when within! The churches were open; and as for the fairâ He wished he could meet a few more of them there. Mr. R?k He rose to relieve the last speakers distressRoebuck. About ladies' loose morals; the cause was, the Press. The Press was the witchâfrom his soul he abhorred herâ That poisoned societyâ(Noise and disorder). The Press was a demon with fiends in collusion; Now he had a pressâ (Laughter, âoh!â and confusion)â If Canadaâ(Groaning)â'twas one of his cares That ladies should know our colonial affairs; When they were admitted he'd certainly show That Canadaâ(Question!)âthe Press was his foe; He intended to move an address to the Crown- For Canadaâ (Question! the speaker sat down). Mr. P? T?n He rose with no wish to prolong the debate,Poulett Thomson But just to remark that he'd nothing to state; To prove his assertion, he poured out a shower Of nothings that occupied more than an hour. Mr. O'C?ll Sir, loving the sex, and beloved, I have lentO'Connell. To this motion a welcome and cordial assent; Though it seems, when we know what the orator's trade is, A project for âboring the earsâ of the ladies. I ask but for this in no tone disaffected, That Catholic females be never rejected. Dear women of Erinâoh! much to be pitied Are they who can't hear meâthey must be admitted. Oh! their smiles! âand their eyes, that out-glitter the gemâ And their hearts that throb wildly as mine does for them. Concede but this point and I give with devotion, The powers of my poor feeble mind to the motion. Sir R?t I?s He could not concede; and he thought the Dissenter,Sir Robert Inglis. Though pious, should not be permitted to enter. The ladies once in, they might creep on too far, Were the portals of Parliament once left ajar; Whole hosts of white hands in a month or two after Might knock at the two Universitiesâ (Laughter). Mr. T. D?e Not one single member had cause for dissent;Mr. T. Duncombe. The married ones mightâyet he could not relent. âI am off to the House; I must be at my post,â Was the green-room or club lounger's evening boast; But when his wife, now as meek as a mouse, Should steal downâ (Alarm on all sides of the House). Mr. E. L. B?r Sir, with joy I concede all the motion can ask!Edward Lytton Bulwer. If solemn our functions, if trying our task; Still woman-ward more should our sympathies flow; And learn how to feelâwhich will teach us to know. The greenest oak-wreath that Philosophy weaves Were dreary without a few flowers in its leaves. We paint Fame as woman; what exquisite tone Could tell of great triumph, sweet truth, but her own! Receive then the ladies, those haters of wrong, Whose lips make our language but laughter and song; Those soothers of trouble and quellers of strife, Mortality's May-queens, the lustres of life; Who flirt with a grief as they would with a fan, And smile away all the vain vapours of man; Whose fondness, or favour, to sages delectable, Makes the mere âexquisiteâ almost respectable; Who, in our sickness are abler than Halford, In counsel more earnest and subtle than Talfourd; Whose faces make home so bewitchingâwho pout More bewitchingly still when we rise to go out; Who will, until three in the morning, sit up for us; Tea ready-madeâwhen they pour out a cup for us; Angels, who only dwell here among things Such as mortals, by virtue of not having wings! This motion is merely a movement of love To open the door of the arkâ to the dove; Its patience shall calm us, its faithfulness guide, Its meekness read lessons to rancour and pride; Its beauty shall light the dark orbs of the blind, The tame shall be kindled, the vulgar refined. (Divide, and great cheering; âthe plan on division Adopted, 'midst mingled delight and derision.) 1836. ON MACLISE'S PORTRAIT OF MACREADY IN MACBETH. Maclise's âMacready's Macbeth As a picture defies all attacks; Yet, uniting these three in a breath, It is only a view of Al-macks. 1836. ON THE DESTRUCTION OF SIR JOHN SOANE'S PORTRAIT BELONGING TO THE LITERARY FUND SOCIETY. âDear Friend,â says Mr. J?, with truth's own grace, âYour knight I've slaughtered with my penknife's lance; But then, if I had not destroyed his face You would have surely lost his countenance.â A logical defence! Let none deride, Or doubt that this each graver charge rebuts; Our friend may boast he has not multiplied A single picture into several cuts! But is the face destroyed? Is hope, then, vain? No! CÃ¦sar stabbed by Brutus doubtless ceases, But what was Soane may yet be sewn againâ Although to give us peace, 'tis cut in pieces! 1836 FALSE LOVE AND TRUE LOGIC. THE DISCONSOLATE My heart will breakâI'm sure it will: My lover, yes, my favouriteâhe Who seemed my own through good and illâ Has basely turned his back on me. THE COMFORTER Ah! silly sorrower, weep no more; Your lover's turned his back we see, But you had turned his head before And now he's as he ought to be. 1836. CONGRATULATORY VERSES TO MISS ELLEN TREE. âThis amiable lady has been in a very perilous situation. A packet, in which she had taken her passage from Cork to Liverpool, was driven about in rough weather for two days and nights on that dangerous coast.ââDaily Paper. Ellen, who shinest up aloft, Sweet starâoh! Ellen Tree, Whom I have gone to see so oft, Why did you go to sea? Not crocodile are these two eyes, Thus weeping without stint; Such blows might e'en macadamise One's heart, though flesh were flint. Now mine is soft, and I must sob For Nature, thus at strifeâ To think that she had sought to rob Her fairest Tree, of Life. You dreamt not, when resolved to go, Of risks in coming back; Yet might you not expect a blow, When taking such a smack? You might have feared the lightning's fork; Had known when thunders roared, That, in a packet boat of Cork, You were not safe on board! Two year-like days were you at sea, Two nights like centuries dark; While surges night and day, O Tree! Were beating 'gainst your âbark.â Yet howsoe'er the winds might chafe, Your vessel crack and quiver, You have arrived, thank fortune, safe, In Liverpoolâa liver. Oh, Ellen, it is sweet to know, When some that wore the crown, Some actresses have sunk so low, That you have not gone down! Since you old Ocean's ire survive, Oh tempt no more his rage; But when you travel, still contrive To beâupon the stage. 1835. TO ELLEN TREE IN âION.â In Woman's garb, howe'er you're dressedâ In Man's, whate'er you try onâ Oh! Ellen, you look always bestâ And so you do in Ion. To wear the male suit is, I know, A thing that some cry fie on! But foolish folks like these should go To see you play in Ion. In comic or in tragic parts You still look chaste as Dian, But Ellen! you hunt hearts (not harts), Yes, though you're dressed for Ion. Your lovers, lady, still must sue, Must still adore and sigh on, Although perplexed to see in you The gentle Greek youth Ion. Oh! could I write his praise and thine In Greek as good as Bion's, I'd dedicate a lasting line To link your fame with Ion's. I like your acting in Pauline, A theme I oft shall cry on; I love you in the Youthful Queenâ But don't I love your Ion. Your Wife (she is so like my own) Was quite a lovely lion; But never love like that was known Which binds my heart to Ion. Your Viola was sweetly pure, A point one need not lie on; But yet methinksâ I'm not quite sureâ Your leg looked best in Ion. Your brow, and fair Clemanthe's brow, I here one chaplet tie on; Yes, you're Clemanthe's self, for now You're married fast to Ion! âUnited States!â Ah! me, that word A rock has thrown me nigh on; You will not goâthe tale's absurdâ What will become of Ion! If I were Serjeant Talfourdâif! â While ocean waves you fly on, I'd sing on Albion's highest cliff An Io unto Ion. You'd charm along your watery way, The dolphins like Arionâ I'm sure you will, if you but play The charming part of Ion. But if you goâa subject this My eyes will not be dry onâ I wish you years of fame and bliss, A long, long age of Ion. Yes, fame is yours! for if she cast Her wreaths, we know not why, on Some ladies' heads, 'tis you at last She'll fondly fix her eye on. No wonder you're called Ellen Tree (Some truth the jest you'll spy on) Since you are covered, as we see, With laurels gained in Ion. 1836. THE BREAKFAST PARTY. Cato's Soliloquy. On a proposal to subject all dogs that draw carriages to a payment of âDouble Duty.â Cato, who strains his nerves beneath the truck Of Smith &amp; Co. Down Piccadilly, lectured thus on luck An hour ago- His bark I know. âSad days for dogs, these dog-days! sad for those, The few who lead Like me a stoic's life, despising woes, Howe'er, indeed, One's heart may bleed. âSad days, and sadder are in store, no doubt, To dim our lot; The Comet sure is floundering about, It's tail has got Into a knot! âEntangled with the dog-star, and may be Our fate to ban! Or have those bipeds passed their new decree! One never can Put faith in man. âA stoic's soul can scarce the blow defy; It makes one wish, Like Man himself, âto be a butterfly,â Or that gold fish In yonder dish. âWas there not tyranny enough before, And contrasts drawn 'Twixt fat sleek puppies, bull-dogs brave and poor, 'Twixt rags and lawn, Bare bones and brawn? âHappy the dogs who form a breakfast group Around the feet Of some fair girl, dispensing milk or soup, Or scraps of meat, With smiles more sweet! âHow many now are basking in such smiles, Who, breakfast o'er, May gambol in the fields, and leap the stiles, And then at four Return for more. âBut I! must I, for lack of gloss or beauty, Be quite undone, In being sentenced thus to âdouble duty?â Is not a ton Enough for one? âI had escaped this heaviest of dooms, Were I, sad wight, Used, not in drawing trucks, but drawing-rooms; Or prone to bite, And fond of fight! âOr were I bred among the sporting race, To make a stir In pits, or in preserves, or in the chase, And live a cur Of character! âAlas! my lot is merely usefulness; I toil along, Too plain to love, too rugged to caress; I do no wrong, But, ah, I'm strong! âMy duty doubled! Well, I'd toil six days, And, bless the mark! Drag on the seventh, in a little chaise, Five Smiths, till dark, All round the Park!â 1836. ACUTE DEDUCTION. âHe takes his hat, and why I would be knowing.â âLearn,â cries that subtle devil, Paul,ââhe's going!â PHILOSOPHY OF GAMES. âLife,â said Tabby, taking snuff, âLife's a game at Blindman's Buff.â âTrue,â said Tabby, âvery true; Death's a game of Forfeits too.â 1836. A POETICAL COLUMN. In Honour of Mr. Simpson, M.C. âWe are sorry to learn that our old friend Simpson, the Master of the Ceremonies at Vauxhall Gardens for so many years, whose eccentricities have caused so much merriment to the public, and whose harmless habits and character have acquired for him, through a long life, the esteem of many, and, we believe, the dislike of none, died on Christmas Day. We have so often noticed his peculiarities in light paragraphs that we feel it but justice, in taking leave of him for ever, to add that his peculiarities were only such as good-nature and urbanity carried to an extreme might commit; and that, though they might have exposed him, as they often did expose him, to laughter, they did not, and could not, produce any worse feeling with respect to him than those which arose from a mixture of hilarity and kindness. But the joke has passed away, and the last impression made by poor Simpson is one of regret.ââMorning Herald. And he is gone! Then grieve Vauxhall! For o'er thy brightness, like a pall, The clouds of black misfortune fall; Weep, oh! ye singers, Weep, waiters, lamplighters, and allâ And call bell-ringers. Mourn, ye musicians, grave and gay; Be mute, or but a requiem play; Ye vaulters, in your postures stayâ Ye firework-makers, Put out the light; let no one pay, Ye money-takers! And oh! lament, good Mr. Gye; And you, good Co., in union cry! You hear the wintry breezes sigh Through each bare treeâ Thus mourn the âRoyal propertyâ Its lost M.C. Your brightest lamp's gone out to-night, Your proudest rocket will not light, Your comic singer takes his flight, Your fowls are tough, Your hock is hot, your port is white, Your rack sad stuff. Your horns are cracked, your fiddles squeak, Your dancer had a sprain last week, Your gallery-floor begins to creak, Your tight-rope loosens; Your fete's proclaimed in each critique A bore, a nuisance. Your gayest path is chill and drear, Your covered walks are wet, I fear; Ev'n summer's self is winter hereâ The leaves are dead, And every dewdrop seems a tear, By Pity shed. So he is mourned, the X-M.C. Politeness! Ah, it ceased to be With him, who was Urbanity In air, voice, feature! The prince of pure Politeness he, That simple creature. Poor Simpson! though the fetes were flat, Or people rude, he smiled at that; And still he only touched his hat Through all the crowd; He understood not âtit for tatââ To boors he bowed! Filled with good-nature to the brim, His hand upon his beaver's rim, In every look, in every limb, Sweet approbation, Folks thought a reprimand from him An obligation. If vulgar brawlers in the throng Annoyed the guests or spoiled the song, His hint that âthey indeed were wrongâ Was so polite, They muttered, as they moved along, âWho would be right?â Alas! when Death, the common foe, Knocks at the door of Man &amp; Co., Coolly inviting us to goâ Though void of use, How apt we are to answer âNo,â And make excuse. But Simpsonânot of such was he; When Death approached the kind M.C., And summoned him, 'midst Christmas glee, To yield his treasure, He answeredââ Eminent Sir, great D., I come, with pleasure.â Now to a Vauxhall grander far, Where every lamp's a shining starâ The Elysian field, whose gate's ajarâ There sails this minute Across the Styx a boat, a carâ And Simpson's in it. He landsâand is elected there M.C. of all that region fair; And ghosts illustrious, spectres rare, Are in a fuss, The smile, the bow, the glance to share Which ravished us. The shadow of a cane bears he, His ghost-hat touched eternally! There walks he ever, fresh and free, Through ceaseless summers; And welcomes to the Property King Death's new comers. 1836. THE PROPER USE OF THE EYES. Certes, the eyes were not to see with, No more than wives were meant to be with, Or milk was sent us to drink tea with. Some sages hint they're meant to weep with, Others to cast a glance, like sheep, with; 'Tis my belief they're meant to sleep with. 1837. MINERVA AT THE PORTICO OF THE ATHENÃUM TO THE DUKE OF YORK AT THE HEAD OF HIS COLUMN. Lo! Wisdom from the house-top crieth out! The house-top! No! From this less lofty perch she sends her shout, The Portico. When I from chimneys preached, men deemed, in mirth, My breath mere smoke, Now hearken they, though now I'm nearer earthâ Well, owls don't croak. Oh! royal statue, whose back I view Still turned in shyness, Hear you my voice up there? How justly you Are styled âYour Highnessâ: Deaf! rather deaf! I thought so ; never mind; I'd just as soon Sing without hearersâI am quite resigned. Proceed my tune! A tune I term it; 'tis a screech, perhaps; But Wisdom, Statue, Consist in doubling all your charms, when chaps Are looking at you. Your ears are quick as flesh ones; quite as meet To catch my tone; Who cares for others' voices?â'tis so sweet To hear one's own. Men deem, of marble as my limbs they mould, Minerva mute! They say that I'm hardâhearted, stiff, and cold;â Homo's a brute! My very patronsâhere, this club of fameâ The AthenÃ¦umâ Pass me, as though they never heard my nameâ I daily see 'em. As in they flock, all eager to receive That meat for Mind, The mile-wide morning paperâlo! they leave Wisdom behind! Me, who look down on them, they bought for show; And thus bequeath me Honour, they think!âas in and out they go. They're quite beneath me. âBuy Wisdom!ââAh, a favourite phrase with men, Jove, how you quizz'd 'em! When duped, defamed, tricked, ruinedâthey have then Beenââbuying Wisdom.â Character, fortune, lostâthe broken trust, The base excuse; And then, what's gained? Oh, Wisdom, when it's just Too late for use. Man thinks him wise, when wealth and wife (life's links) Away have run; Plutus and Venus lost, the poor wretch thinks Minerva's won. Who would be a mortal if he might be marble, Or bronze, great neighbour; Life only lives its history to garble, And all's vain labour. What are these moving images about? Dining and cheering! Yes, dinner over, how they love to shout, And shirk the hearing. Here genius cuts (on paper) a new road; Here's one who pens a âSonnet to Fog in London,â or an âOde To Influenza.â This schemer pens away the Debt; and here Sits one displaying, âHow to Live well on Fifty Pounds a Yearââ By never paying. Here sleepless Science seeks another Moon; There dwells a dab At a new turnpike, or a new balloon, Perhaps a cab. But look all around you see this folly still (Folly or vice), If cheated once, the man willâyes, he will Be cheated twice. Then Bronze and Marble versus Clay and Ashes; Let them insure; We from West-end collisions, City crashes, Are quite secure. So is your Sire close by, who sits a steed That, strongly sinewed, Commands a tail as strongâa tail, indeed, âTo be continued.â My compliments to bothâthe same to you, This love-led morn; But as for these clay creatures whom I view, Be theirs my scorn. All-speakers, spouters, schemers, losers, winners, Sages, and fighters, Compose two classes of atrocious sinnersâ Readers and writers. The first are Folly's children, or they'd never Sigh for such whistles; The second must be Fools, or would they ever Seek figs on thistles. 1837. THE RACES. The Races, the Races, the Races! Wherever we turn in this life, What still stares us all in our faces? A race of ridiculous strife. We all start against one another, Unnoticed or backed by a dozen; Each man runs a race with his brother, Each dame with her sister or cousin. The world is a race-course, we're told, And mortals still keep up their paces; Either middle-aged, youthful, or oldâ So the Races, the Races, the Races! Lay odds on the Ladies! 'Tis said You may find it a capital spec.; Thought man may have won by a head, 'Tis woman who wins by a neck. Back those who, in virtues so ample, Would forfeit the winner's renown, Much rather than heedlessly trample On rivals knocked up or knocked down. But still hurry on through the crowd, Whatever your gout, or your graces, For Time is still crying aloud, Oh! the Races, the Races, the Races! What candidates take up their stand, All panting and eager to start; Some outwardly, linked hand in handâ Some inwardly, linked heart in heart. Some pairs seem to ride on for ever, Some break with the very first bound; Some smooth as the course of a river, Some rough as macadamised ground. Some dash on a track of their own, And some take their ancestor's places; Oh! who would be left quite alone, In the Races, the Races, the Races! See the Houses of Parliament run! How equalâunevenâthe race! The Lower all fierceness and fun, The Upper with gravity's pace. This now seems to shoot far ahead, Now that seems to suffer a check; Which wins? Which is first? âGo it, Ned!â The Houses now seem neck and neck. Whigs, Tories, and Rads are alive, Rare gamesters, all eager for aces; And all three resolving to thrive In the Races, the Races, the Races! In the publishing world what a start! The ink flows from infinite springs; Each pen is a fast-flying dart, And books spread their covers for wings. A library leaps into life At each turn of the press every day; And there's no time to read, in the strife, To write history, novel and play. One treads on the other; the song, The sermon or treatise displaces; Prose rubs against Rhyme, in the throng To the Races, the Races, the Races! And ârapidâ is ever the word In this life throughout all its conditions; Death flies with the speed of a bird From the College of Surgeons, Physicians. The doctors and surgeons all drive Through the town, as each day were their last, And yet, while themselves are alive, Their patients go off rather fast. The lawyers are hastening meanwhile, They run on through all sorts of cases, And arguments spun by the mile, To the Races, the Races, the Races! The Theatre! say, will the rule Apply, as it once did, to them? Each seems to be turned to a school For teaching what scholars condemn. Yet the rule will apply; for each one Is a true âmoving spectacleâ still; Though the dramas performed do not run Quite so fast as a racer or rill. The Church and the Chapel compete, And each one security's basis Presents for our wandering feet In the Races, the Races, the Races. But what, in the week that has fled, Was the scene of Life's liveliest race? Was it Epsom? Oh, no! 'twill be read That Kensington bore off the grace. Who started? the namesââCaravan?â Was it âPhosphorus?â No. âDardanelles!â Or âRat-trap,â or âWisdomââwhich man Had not when he backed âMickle Fell's?â Was it âTriolus,â âPegasus,â âCritic,â âHybiscus,â âMahometanââgraces That never were yet paralytic In Races, the Races, the Races! Was it âBenedict,â âNorgrove,â or âMango,â Or, âHercules (Pocket)ââWhy ask? The guess goes as far as it can go, The fact is the easier task. The Race was the race of three nations, A contest of city and town, To wreathe with the heart's aspirations The brow that may yet bear a crown. The Princess!âoh, be it impressed On her heart, which is Britons' oasis, That the old English race is the best, Of the Races, the Races, the Races. 1837. âTHE VIXEN.â A Case of âSeizure.â âShe was a phantom of delightââ (To borrow Wordsworth's lovely line), âThat seen became a part of sightâ (As Byron says, in praise divine). Is she not still a phantom? No; âA perfect woman nobly plannedâ (So Wordsworth's numbers nobly flow), âTo warm, to comfort, and command.â Ay, that's the word; so runs the song; âAn angel, but a woman still,â I own she is, and hath been long:â An angel's heart, a woman's will. O Love, thou grossly libelled god, With falsehood charged by maid and youth, My sole complaint isâsounds it odd?â Thy fervour, constancy, and truth. Ah, better were it for this heart, For reasons I shall shortly show, Ifânot as straight as is thy dartâ Thy course were crooked as thy bow. Each hour but proves, while Fate's reproved, How oddly we in life are mated; Some folks would die to be beloved, While I could live, if I were hated. Yes, Love, if thou wert false and baseâ If thou wert fickle, wayward, cold; In short, if thou wert Hateâthy face 'Twould then be rapture to behold. But nowâshe loves me! loves so well, That each embrace becomes a blow; So deep my bliss, I seem to dwell For ever on the brink of woe. âA perfect woman!â Wordsworth's right; There's not a shade of fault about her; I cannot speak, sing, think, indite, Read, walk, dine, sleep, or dream without her. She treasures every word I say, She watches all my idle glances; And then, I'm sure to find, next day, My nothings bred into romances. If haply I look grave, or sigh, She's shocked, and wonders what's the matter; What should she do were I to die! She fearsâshe fearsâI'm growing fatter! I'll take a walk. âHa! she'll take a walk too; There's quite a change come o'er the weather;â Well, never mind, this book will doâ I'll read!ââHa! yes, we'll read together.â âPray put the book downâleave off here; 'Tis too excitingâmakes you sad!â âOh, dinner's ready;âah, I fear, That fish for you is very bad.â âWine! and would you take wine! You can't; I've ordered James to lose the key; For once, I'll sayâyes, sayâyou shan't, Thereâlet me order inâthe tea.â Music, she thinks, disturbs my mind, .So hides my flute and light guitar; Dare, dare I smoke, alas, though blind, Love's nose detects the vile cigar. My snuff-boxâthat's gone long ago; She begged it for her crying brother; And then her love's too pure, you know, To buy, or let me buy, another. My favourite book's locked upâand why? I pored upon it till I'm double; My favourite horse was found too shy; He's sold, to save me pain and trouble. What care she takes for all my wantsâ Except for those, to me most pressing; How lovingly her fond heart grants The kindness that is so distressing. Whate'er I wish for must be bad, For health or comfort, time or place; Whate'er she wishes, men stark mad Alone would scruple to embrace. In her no self-willed force you find, No frowning, raving, or defiance; Her love's so gentle, calm, and kind, It only asksâa frank compliance. She does not scoff, she does not scold, Drown you with tears, or wound with wit, Call you a wretch, and hint you're oldâ She but expects youâto submit. Each comfort, solace, or delight, Each recreation, one by one, The lounge at noon, the play at night, The laugh with Wit, the romp with Fun: The table's wine, its joys, its jest, The study's solitary hour, She seizes allâshe, she knows best What best will suit me, sweet or sour. Who could resist?â'tis not in men To meet such love with resolution; Such zeal, such care, such truthâand then She understands my constitution. Yet why thus born to fascinate! Why play the fond physician's part! Why was it her victorious fate To make a seizure of my heart! Give me, oh Loveâsince love intense My life's best charm has dissipatedâ The joy of cold indifference, The conscious bliss of being hated. 1837. CONGRATULATORY ADDRESS TO MADAME VESTRIS ON HER RECENT JOURNEY TO BRIGHTON. Of all the gay and graceful themes The Muses may alight on, The one that most with fancy teems Isâyour exploit at Brighton. In you all beauties ever blent, Your eyes would flash and lighten, Your voice worked spellsâbefore you went Three weeks ago to Brighton. From childhood up toâ(what's your age?) You've been a female Crichton, And charmed the silly and the sage In many towns like Brighton. But each of all your triumphs past A minnow to a Triton Appears, compared with this your last Triumphal trip to Brighton. 'Twould puzzle Bidder's self to count The rivals you affrighten; But where's the rival that can mount Your hill of fame at Brighton? They claim and fascinate, when they On Subjects fix their sight on; But you have taught a King to say âI can't refuseââat Brighton. You had but to denounce the laws, Unduly framed to tighten The art you love, to win your cause, And crown your hopes at Brighton. In vain might actors, authors, plead, And editors might write on; Ay, write and read, but not succeed Though all should rush to Brighton. Another voice had lost its tone, Another lip would whiten, Another heart had timid grown, When not half-way to Brighton. Let meaner spirits shrink, but you Are formed to travel right on; Your eye and voice more splendid grew, When called to plead at Brighton. I wish you'd seek another stage Than that you sing at night on In politics you'd fill a page With victories won at Brighton. A great physician you must prove, A state Sir William Knighton; And heal all wounds, all strife remove, By taking trips to Brighton. You ask and have, you kneel and win, Misfortune throws no blight on The fruits you grasp atâ'tis a sin To stay away from Brighton. Why plot, project, resist?âand why Should parties storm and fight on, When you may make air, voice, and eye, Petitioners at Brighton. 1837. QUEEN ELIZABETH'S STOCKINGS. âSarah Row was indicted for stealing a pair of silk hose, value 10s. âCommon Serjeant: I see, Madame, by the deposition, that you state the stockings are more than 300 years old? âWitness: My Lord, they were once the property of Elizabeth, Queen of England. When that monarch died, her will directed that her wardrobe should be divided between her maids of honour, and these stockings have been handed down as heirlooms from generation to generation. âThe hose were now produced, and excited great curiosity. They were of scarlet silk, with white clocks, surmounted by a Papal crown.ââ Daily Paper. âAh! sure a pair was never seen, So justly formed,â&amp;c. Oh, stockings illustrious, marvellous hose, Who on earth such a pair could expect to behold? Whatsoever the witness above may depose, Is it true that you're more than three hundred years old? Like the handkerchief cribbed by Iago, the varlet, The worms were all hallowed that bred your fine silk; Why, poppies when brightest are pale to your scarlet, Your clocks shame the whiteness of snow or of milk. How strange! that such fragile productions may stay, When queens and their subjects pass off with celerity; How odd, when the ankles they covered are clay, That stockings are thus handed down to posterity. Ah! when did she wear ye? Why, as I'm alive, You're as red to this day as the fires of old Bonner; Supernatural stockings, how did you survive? Say, magical silk, were you ever drawn on her? Well! when did she wear ye? Were ye on her feet When the gallant Lord Essex first flung himself there? Did you peep, as that virgin heart tenderly beat, From under the petticoat, exquisite pair? Were ye worn, scarlet hose, on the day when she found The statesman and swain lost to love and to reason? Your silk was perchance 'twixt her foot and the ground When stamped in a fury at Essex's treason. Who can say you're not the identical pair In which her fair ankles were blushingly seen, As she stepped on the cloak that young Raleigh threw there To save from a spot e'en the shoe of his queen. What marvel, bright hose, you are thus handed down! âMaids of honourâ alone can be worthy of you; The wonder is, seeing that each clock bears a âcrown,â (Id est, four) that yourselves should be valued at two. Yet e'en at this low rate your worth may be seen; And to you as an heirloom, all heirlooms must bow, For being but part of a dress of a queen, You are equal to justâHalf a Sovereignâ now. 'Twas natural to steal ye; ah! who could resist! Common gallantry bids one lay hands on the gear; But as stockings like these are so apt to be missed, A watch should be kept on each âclockâit is clear. Be still handed down!âBut my Muse, ere she's dizzy, Would sing of a living queenâ(sing her, sweet Muse). Who, though she may ne'er wear the stockings of Lizzy, For England's proud glory, may âtread in her shoes.â 1837. HER MAJESTY'S EXCURSION TO BRIGHTON. Though to London I come not again, Though I ne'er should to Windsor repair; To Brighton I go on my pen, (As a witch on her stick) through the air. So away, and away, and away! A certain most beautiful pair, Are visible, each like a ray, In fancy before I get there. A beautiful, beautiful pair! Aha! shall I mention their names! Why that might plunge into despair Some millions of damsels and dames. Oh, no! what a fib have I sung; It would rather compel me to mention Some millions of belles old and young, Which somewhat exceeds my intention. âA beautiful pair!â why, the phrase May describe any feminine twain That one anywhere meets in these days, For I swear that they're none of'em plain. The words may describe any two, Stout, slender, elongate, or short, That the eye of a lover may view Within five hundred miles of the Court. The pair that I meanâshall I print Their titles at length, with their claims? Oh, noâand the reason I hint; Hem! I never once heard of their names. No matter; to Brighton we'll go onâ The prospect grows dazzlingly near, And surely the stars never shone So bright as the eyes that are here. To Brighton!âlet Margate bewail, And Harrowgate give up the ghost; And the chalk cliffs of Dover turn pale, And Ramsgate retire from the coast; Let Cheltenham deepen her springs With the flood of salt tears she must shed; And Worthing and Tunbridge take wings, And Hastings bow down its green head. Yes, Brighton eclipses them all; For look on this vision outspread; Can fancy such colours recall, From the splendor of dreams that are fled! The fairies have dropt upon earth And fashioned this exquisite scene, To welcome with music and mirth The approach of Old England's young Queen! Do you hearâdo you hear how they shout? Their souls spoke aloud in that burstâ Do you see how they're running about, Each striving to outstrip the first? See here, too, how patient they stand; That loyal old man how he limpsâ This urchin with flow'rs in his handâ All glad if they get but a glimpse. Just glance at the road: what a line Of light is drawn out to the eye! How tasteful, how brilliant, how fine, Are the rainbow-like tints we descry. That path is the path for a queen; That arch is triumphal indeed; Love breathes from each flower of the scene, And kindles with beauty each weed. From hundreds and hundreds of nooks You may see eager eyes shining out, Old faces with youth in their looks, Young lips that will smile as they pout. Not an eye will know slumber serene, Not a lip will reward the caresser, If the eye get no view of the Queen, And the lips may not breathe a âGod bless her!â She comesâyes, her Majesty comes! Hark now to the shouts that arise; Though all the musicians beat drums, Those shouts would soar up to the skies. Ah! now what a feeling of pride Swells high in each hope-beating heart; The people stand fast side by side, As though of each other a part. Yesâeach to the other is bound By a sympathy subtle and vast; And they felt love is not a mere sound As the Queen of their Love slowly passed. For then had the splendour no spell Like the bright hue of health on that cheek, And no shout could to them speak so well As the silent lips seeming to speak. They see where fine carriages throng, The archways with dahlias entwined, The horsemen careering along, The platforms with fair ladies lined; They view the magnificent stir, The mingling of simple and wiseâ But the Queen! they have eyes but for her, And their hearts now look out of their eyes. They hear the all rapturous roar That drowns the hoarse cry on the strand, And they hear a gay air, which is more, From good Admiral D.'s private band. Back, bands, to your camps or your ships! In vain on your spirits you call, For they fancy the Queen's smiling lips Are breathing a greeting to all. And the ladiesâHa! where are the two Whom I came here on purpose to find; So spellbound was I with the view, They have vanished âslickâ out of my mind. Ye twain, will ye tell where you sit? What window, what carriage, what stand? Or the gay amphitheatre, fit For such fairies to grace hand in hand! Ye pair of âyoung ladies,â I mean, With faces lit up in sweet smiles, Who travelled, to look on your Queen, Just a hundred and thirty long miles! Oh with you to have one minute's talkâ In love's as in loyalty's wiles To be tangledâI'd travel, nay, walkâ Yes, double the number of miles. 1837. MY DREAM. By an ex-Premier. Whilst reading the âStandard'sâ Irish news, And tracing amidst its mingled hues, The colour and cut of the last new lieâ (A Protestant fact) asleep fell I. And methought for my sinsâeven saints have sinsâ That I and the Outs were again the Ins. That again the hurried Hudson came As of old and called aloud on my nameâ And a crowd of hungry eager things, Colleagues, and cousins, and underlings, Were urging me on with hastening feet, Onwards, on, towards Downing Streetâ Where still, however, the Cabinet door To us was shut and fast as before. When lo! from the midst of the crowd an arm, O'erreaching stretched with a wondrous charmâ And the door that seemed set firm as a rock, OpenedâLord Brougham had picked the lock: And bowing us in with a whisper small, Declared that the Queen had done it all! In first rushed I, as Premier again, And hopes ran high for a long, long reign; But lightning-swift was the change that shot O'er my apparently Pitt-like lot. Louder than thunder came a note From the multitudinous Tory throat- A note of advice, remonstrance, prayer. Following, stunning me everywhere! Millions of candidates spoke at a time, On the selfsame theme with a different rhyme; A peerage, a pension, a see, a place, A ribbon, a lift was the a different rhyme; Thought and language seemed as I live Condensed into one monosyllableââGive!â In I was nor could I get out, So thronged was the place with that ravenous routâ. Countless relations, troops of friends, Each with his small, snug family endsâ I couldn't go down to Windsor to dine, The swarm of petitioners blocked the line. No ghastlier crew were there if the ghosts Of all the Pittites came back for posts. Methought while stretched on this Cabinet rack, Lord Hill and the Guards might keep them back; And his Lordship (he said) would have been most proud, But all his friends were among the crowd! In the midst of it all Archdeacon Magee Denounced us as things of âexpediency:â Perfidious place-lovers, men who'd betray Both Church and State in the broad noonday. And the people laughed as our arch-fiend swore, So well did they know that fact before. Then others as arch proclaimed our creed Specious in word, but dirty in deed; And, deeming me treacherous, wondered still When I meant to repeal the Poor-Law Billâ Or the Bill, said the Bishops (kind friends of mine), Passed in the fatal year '29! But Exeter's prelate of all the host, With three-hour speeches plagued me most, To make with a mitre or some such matterâ The Rev. Mr. Stephens fatter, And Oastler, he thought, would expect to get A seat in the poor man's Cabinet; While great O'Connor would bow his neck For the scanty pay of Irish Sec. But worse than this, and worse than all, That holding me up foredoomed my fallâ That bade me do what I, when out, Had factiously worried the Whigs aboutâ That dragged me a thousand different ways, The press to fetter, the Church to raise, To crush Dissent, bid Freedom cease, And levy the costs of war in peaceâ Oh, worse than all was the threat that hung On a certain noble and learned tongueâ The threat of his âfriendshipâ proffered pat, The friendship ofâlet me not think of that! He savagely promised his fine support, And offered to take me at once to Court! And he vowed to write by that night's post To the Queen, whose favour was ever his boast, A letter of truths now first revealed, With his Lordship's crest (a whole hog) sealed! Nay more, he was willingâhe scorned reposeâ To sit as Chancellor if we chose; To agitate for us six times a week In Sanscrit, Irish, Dutch, or Greek; Or turn with his pen Old Buff and Blue (To oblige us) into an Orange review! . . . . The threat was fatal, the vision fledâ Horrors were heaped upon horror's head, Ladies, and Lords, and lacqueys, the race Eager for plunder, pay, and placeâ Red-tape Radicals, prelates proud, All that composed the insatiate crowd Were nothing to this; their yellings yet Seem music compared with that horrible threat. To suffer the sting of his support, To bear the badge of his praise to Court, To incur his âfriendshipââwhilst he spoke With a gentleman's instinct, I awoke! âThe Courier.â1838. HELEN FAUCIT IN âTHE LADY OF LYONS.â What need I, O Helen, comparisons draw 'Twixt thee and the belles of Circassia or Cadiz; Since first the sweet Lady of Lyons I saw, I swear I have deemed thee the Lion of Ladies. Start not, I would give thee no terrible shape, A lion dove-voiced like the poet's I mean, But such are my chains I might sooner escape From the leonine paw than from you as Pauline. Sweet Lady of Lyons! what lions of his, Van Amburgh's, could move us like thee to applaud? While he is avoiding a scratch on the phiz, We, seeing you, wishâyes, we wish to be Claude. Yes, Lady, the pride and the rapture of Claude, Though at first his love-garden was wofully weedy, In winning by faith what he'd captured by fraud, Oh! it does make one long to be Mr. Macready. The love, the disdain, the relenting, the bliss Of being well cheatedâthat natural passionâ You feel it all keenly! but we too feel this, Oh! Helen, you've brought heart and soul into fashion. While hearing from your lips the truths he has written, While watching the thoughts your deep eyes are revealing, I'm sure there must often steal over Sir Lytton, A pleasant Pygmalionish sort of a feeling. Oh! Helen of Lyons! not she of old Troy (The Helen of Paris) is Helen to me; Nor Helen, the braveâminded rib of Rob Roy, Nor HelenâMiss Edgeworth'sâthe best of the three; Nor Shakspeare's fond Helen, who felt 'twas affliction To love, and not wed, some âparticular star,â Though stars they may be, shining sweetly in fiction, You glisten, in fact, more enchantingly far. 1838. TO WILLIAM CHARLES MACREADY. On his becoming the Lessee of Old Drury. I Macready, master of the Art supreme, That shows to dazzled and else guideless eyes (As doth Astronomy the starry skies) The airy wonders of our Shakspeare's dream; Com'st thou again to shed a wakening gleam Of morals, taste, and learning, where the gloom Most darkens, as around the Drama's tomb! Oh! come, and show us yet the true extreme; Transcendent art, for coarse and low desire; The generous purpose, for the sordid aim; For noise and smoke, the music and the fire Of time-crown'd poets; for librettos tame, The emulous flashings of the modern lyreâ Come, and put scowling Calumny to shame! II What though with thee come Lear, himself a storm Of wilder'd passion, and the musing Dane, The gallant Harry and his warrior train, Brutus, Macbeth, and truth in many a form Lowering; not therefore only that we warm With hope and praise; but that thy glorious part Is now to raise the Actor's trampled Art, And drive from out its temple a loose swarm Of things vice-nurturedâfrom the Porch and Shrine! And know, Macready, 'midst the desert there, That soon shall bloom a garden, swells a mine Of wealth no less than honourâboth most bare To meaner enterprise. Let that be thineâ Who knowest how to risk, and how to share. 1842. LOVE HAS LEGS. Strolling about from bower to hall, Love paid Lavinia a morning call. An hour soon wentâshe chatted and sangâ He stayed, till at last the dinner-bell rang. He stayed, still charm'd; and rather alarmed, Lavinia felt she must ask him to stay. âTo tell you the truth,â cried the radiant youth, âI'm here for life, I shall ne'er go away.â Love's fire shot through her in one wild flush, Till her heart itself might be seen to blush; Love saw, and finding it faithful and kind, Exclaimed, O Beauty, how long I've been blind! More grateful grew he, more fervent she, More watchful, sensitive, warm, and fond; So much like light was he to her sight, She could not trust him a step beyond. Still more she cherish'd him year by year, Till at last each joy came tinged with fear; She fear'd, if he stroll'd where wild flowers meet, Lest thorns might pierce his delicate feet; Or a reptile's sting beneath his wing She fear'd if he lay in the greenwood asleep; Or walk'd he awake by the moonlit lakeâ In dread of an ague how would she weep! She chatted and sang to Love no more, Lest music and chat should prove âa bore!â But she hung on his steps where'er he went, And shut from the chamber the rose's scent. She slept not a wink, for fear he should think She dreamed not of Loveâso her eyes grew dim; She took no care of her beautiful hair, For she could not spare one moment from him. Love's bright fireside grew dark with doubt, Yet home was a desert if Love went out; In vain were his vows, caresses, and sighs; âO Love,â cried the Lady, âI've given you eyes! And ah! should some face of a livelier grace Than mine ever meet them! Ah, should you stay!â Love wearied at last, was in slumber locked fast: âThose wings!â said the watcher, âhe might fly away!â One awful moment! Oh! could she sever Those wings from Love, he is hers for ever! With trembling hand she gathers the wingsâ She clipsâthey are off! and up Love springs. âAdieu!â he cried, as he leapt from her side, âOf Folly's cup you have drunk the dregs: My home was here; it is now with the deer; Thank Venus, though wingless, Love has legs! 1842. LOVE'S MASQUERADINGS. Love never less surprises Than when his tricks are tried; In vain are all disguises, Himself he cannot hide. He came, the Masquerader, To conscious Kate one day, Attempting to persuade her He then wasâfar away! âAh, Love!â she cried, unfearing, âTake any shape you will, Strange, distant, or endearing, This heart would know you still.â Then Love came clad like sorrow; His robe was dark as night; But like a golden morrow, Flash'd forth his forehead's light; She knew him, as with languor He played the wounded dove: Then fierce he frownedâ'twas anger! But still she knew 'twas Love! Then came he wreathed like Pleasure; In vain he cried, âRejoice!â And sang a laughing measureâ She knew him by his voice. He turned his tongue to railing, Performing Envy's task; His scowl was unavailing, She saw himâthrough his mask. Like cloak'd Revenge then stealing, With poniard bare he came, His limbs, his looks, concealingâ Yet still he seem'd the same. Then he, his thoughts dissembling, With Jealousy's wild air Stood raging, watching, tremblingâ Yet Love alone stood there. Next came he garbed like Malice; Yet wore his cheek the rose, No poison crowns his chalice, With wine it overflows. And then as Joy, arrayed in Rare colours from above! He failed againâthe maiden In Joy saw only Love! Then casting off his splendour, He took black Hatred's guise; But all his tones were tender, She knew himâby his eyes. In all he fail'd; when glancing Like Fear, afraid to stir; And when like Hope, half dancingâ For Hope was Love to her. âIn vain,â she cried, âyour powers, Take any shape you may; Are hearts less wise than flowers, That know the night from day?â 1842. TWO OF A TRADE. Written to Cruikshank's drawing of âThe Butcher Boy and his Dogâ in âThe Omnibus.â âWith such a dear companion at my side.ââWordsworth. Oh! marvellous Boy, what marvel when I met thy Dog and thee, I marvell'd if to dogs or men You traced your ancestry! If changed from what you once were known, As sorrow turns to joy, The Boy more like the Dog had grown, The Dog more like the Boy. It would a prophet's eyesight baulk, To see through time's dark fog, If on four legs the Boy will walk, Or if on two the Dog. O pair! what were ye both at first? The one a feeble pup; A babe the other, fondly nursedâ How have ye been brought up? O Boy! and wert thou once a child, A cherub small and soft, On whom two human beings smiled, And prayed for, oft and oft? A creature rosy, plump, and fair, Half meekness and half joy; A wingless angel with light hair! Oh! wert thou, Butcher-boy? A thing more gentle, laughing, light, More blithe, more full of play, Than e'er he wasâthat luckless wight! The lamb you stuck to-day? And thou, O Dog, with deep-set eyes, Wert thou, like Love, once blind: With helpless limbs of pigmy size, And voice that scarcely whined? How grew your legs so like to his, Your growl so like his tone? And when did he first see your phiz Reflected in his own? Bravely have both your likeness worn; Alike, without, within; Brethren ye are, and each was born, Like Happiness, âa twin!â Yet can it be, oh, Butcher-boy, Thou com'st of Adam's race? Then Adam's gold has much alloy, Was this his form and face? Art thou descended from the pair From whom the CÃ¦sars came? Wore Alexander such an air? Look'd Cheops much the same? And thou, oh, Butcher's cur, is't true That thy first parents e'er From Eden's garden lapped the dew, And breathed in rapture there? Yes! those from whom you spring, no doubt, Who lived like dogs and died, Must once have followed Eve about, And walked by Adam's side. 1842. SUCH A DUCK. Once Venus, deeming Love too fat, Stopped all his rich ambrosial dishes, Dooming the boy to live on chat, To sup on songs, and dine on wishes. Love, lean and lank, flew off to prowlâ The starvelling now no beauty boastedâ He could have munched Minerva's owl, Or Juno's peacock, boiled or roasted. At last, half famished, almost dead, He shot his Mother's Doves for dinner; Young Lilla, passing, shook her headâ Cried Love, âA shot at you, young sinner!â âOh, not at me!ââshe urged her flightâ âI'm neither dove, nor lark, nor starling!â âNo,ââfainting Cupid criedâânot quite; But thenâyou're such aâduckâmy darling!â 1842. A SONG OF CONTRADICTIONS. âI am not what I am.â âIago. The Passions, in festival meeting, I saw seated round, in a dream; And vow, by my hatred of cheating, The Passions are not what they seem. There's mirth under faces the gravest, There's woe under visages droll; There's fear in the breast of the bravest, And light in the desolate soul. Thus Joy, in my singular vision, Sat sobbing and gnashing his teeth; While Gentleness scoffed in derision, And Hope picked the buds from his wreath. Despair, her tight bodice unlacing, With Laughter seemed ready to die; And Hate, her companions embracing, Won each with a smile or a sigh. There Peace bellowed louder and louder, For Freedom, sent off to the hulks; Fear sat on a barrel of powder, And Pleasure stood by in the sulks. Here Dignity shoots like a rocket Past Grace, who is rolling in fat; There Probity's picking a pocket, Here Pity sits skinning a cat. Then Temperance reeling off, quite full, Charged Friendship with drugging her draught; She vowed it was Love that was spiteful, While Charity, blaming all, laughted; When Rage, with the blandest expression, And Vengeance, low-voiced like a child, Cried, âMercy, forgive the transgression!â But Mercy look'd horribly wild. Old Wisdom was worshipping Fashion, And Jollity dozing in gloom; While Meekness was foaming with passion, And Misery danced round the room. Sweet Envy tripped off to her garret, Bright Malice smiled worthy of trust, Gay Want was enjoying his claret, And Luxury gnawed a dry crust. At Pride, as she served up the dinner, Humility turned up her nose; Suspicion shook hands with each sinner, While Candour shunned all as her foes. There's mirth under faces the gravest, There's woe under visages droll, There's fear in the breast of the bravest, And light in the desolate soul! 1842.

By the late Sir Fretful Plagiary, Knight, Member of the Dramatic Authors' Association, Fellow of the Parnassian Society, &amp;c. Now first printed from the Original Copies in the handwriting of that popular Author. Edited by Laman Blanchard. ODE TO THE HUMAN HEART. Blind Thamyris, and blind MÃ¦onides, Pursue the triumph and partake the gale! Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees, To point a moral or adorn a tale. The printer's devil has taken upon himself to make the following addition to these lines:â Blind Thamyris, and blind MÃ¦onides (Something like Milton.) Pursue their triumph and partake the gale! (Rather like Pope.) Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees (Why, this is Shakspeare!) To point a moral or adorn a tale. (Oh, it's Dr. Johnson.) To the succeeding lines the same authority has added in succession the names of Gray, Wordsworth, Campbell, and so on throughout. What does he mean? Does he mean to say he has ever met with any of these lines before? Full many a gem of purest ray serene, Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears, Like angels' visits, few and far between, Deck the long vista of departed years. Man never is, but always to be bless'd; The tenth transmitter of a foolish face, Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest, And makes a sunshine in the shady place. For man the hermit sigh'd, till woman smiled, To waft a feather or to drown a fly, (In wit a man, simplicity a child), With silent finger pointing to the sky. But fools rush in where angels fear to tread, Far out amid the melancholy main; As when a vulture on Imaus bred, Dies of a rose in aromatic pain. Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, Look on her face, and you'll forget them all; Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, A hero perish, or a sparrow fall. My way of life is fall'n into the sere; I stood in Venice on the Bridge of Sighs, Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear, Who sees through all things with his half-shut eyes. Oh! for a lodge in some vast wilderness! Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, Fine by degrees and beautifully less, And die ere man can say âLong live the Queen!â Lives there a man with soul so dead, Who never to himself has said, âShoot folly as it flies?â Oh! more than tears of blood can tell, Are in that word farewell, farewell! 'Tis folly to be wise. And what is friendship but a name, That boils on Etna's breast of flame? Thus runs the world away; Sweet is the ship that's under sail To where yon taper cheers the vale, With hospitable ray! Drink to me only with thine eyes Through cloudless climes and starry skies! My native land, good night! Adieu, adieu, my native shore; 'Tis Greece, but living Greece no moreâ Whatever is is right! ON LIFE, ET CETERA. Know then this truth, enough for man to know: Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow. Who would be free themselves must strike the blow. Retreating lightly with a lovely fear From grave to gay, from lively to severe. To err is human, to forgive divine, And wretches hang that jurymen may dine Like quills upon the fretful porcupine. All are but parts of one stupendous whole, The feast of reason and the flow of soul. We shall not look upon his like again, For panting Time toils after him in vain, And drags at each remove a lengthening chain; Allures to brighter worlds, and leads the way With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay! 1842. PHOTOGRAPHIC PHENOMENA, OR THE NEW SCHOOL OF PORTRAIT-PAINTING. âSit, Cousin Percy; sit, good Cousin Hotspur.ââHenry IV. âMy lords, be seated.â âSpeech from the Throne. IINVITATION TO SIT. Now sit, if ye have courage, cousins all! Sit, all ye grandmammas, wives, aunts, and mothers Daughters and sisters, widows, brides, and nieces; In bonnets, braids, caps, tippets, or pelisses, The muff, mantilla, boa, scarf, or shawl! Sit, all ye uncles, godpapas, and brothers, Fathers, and nephews, sons, and next of kin, Husbands, half-brother's cousin's sires, and others; Be you as Science young, or old as Sin: Turn, Persian-like, your faces to the sun! And have each one His portrait done, Finished, one may say, before it's begun. Nor you alone, O slight acquaintances! or blood relations! But sit, oh! public Benefactors, Whose portraits are hung up by Corporations. Ye Rulers of the likeness-loving nations, Ascend you now the Photographic throne, And snatch from Time the precious mornings claimed By artists famed (In the Court Circular you'll find them named!) Sit too, ye laurelled Heroes, whom detractors Would rank below the statesman and the bard! Sit also, all ye Actors, Whose fame would else die with you, which is hard; Whose Falstaffs here will never Slenders prove, So true the art is! M.P.'s for one brief moment cease to move; And you who stand as leaders of great Parties Be sitting Members! Ye intellectual Marchers, sit resigned! And oh! ye Authors, men of dazzling mind, Perchance with faces foggy as November's, Pray sit! Apollo turned R.A. The other day, Making a most decided hit, They say. PhÅbus himselfâhe has become a Shee! (Morning will rank among the Knights full soon) And while the Moon, Who only draws the tides, is clean outdone, The stars are all astonishment to see Earthâsitting for her portraitâto the Sun! IITHE PROCESS OF THE PORTRAITURE. It's all very fine, is it not, oh! ye Nine? To tell us this planet is going too fast, On a comet-like track through the wilderness vast: Instead of collision and chances of splitting In contact with stars rushing down the wrong line, The world at this moment can't get onâfor sitting; And Earth, like the Lady enchanted in Comus, Fixed fast to her chair With a dignified air, Is expecting to sit for a century there; Much wondering, possibly, half in despair, How the deuce she's to find her way back to her domus. âKeep moving,â we know, was the cry long ago; But now, never hare was âfound sitting,â I swear, Like the crowds who repair To old Cavendish Square, And mount up a mile and a quarter of stair, In procession that beggars the Lord Mayor's show! And are all on tiptoe, the high and the low, To sit in that glass-cover'd blue studio; In front of those boxes wherein when you look, Your image reversed will minutely appear, So delicate, forcible, brilliant, and clear, So small, full, and round, with a life so profound, As none ever wore In a mirror beforeâ Or the depths of a glassy and branch-sheltered brook, That glides amidst moss o'er a smooth-pebbled ground. Apollo, whom Drummond of Hawthornden styled âApelles of flowers,â Now mixes his showers Of sunshine, with colours by clouds undefiled; Apelles indeed to man, woman, and child. His agent on earth, when your altitude's right, Your collar adjusted, your locks in their place. Just seizes one moment of favouring light, And utters three sentencesââNow it's begun,ââ âIt's going on now, Sir,ââand âNow it is done:â And lo! as I live, there's the cut of your face On a silvery plate Unerring as fate, Worked off in celestial and strange mezzotint, A little resembling an elderly print. âWell, I never!â all cry; âit is cruelly like you!â But Truth is unpleasant To prince and to peasant. You recollect Lawrence, and think of the graces That Chalon and Company give to their faces; The face you have worn fifty years doesn't strike you! IIITHE CRITICISMS OF THE SITTERSâTHE MORAL. âCan this be me! do look, mamma!â Poor Jane begins to whimper; âI have a smile, 'tis true;âbut, pa! This gives me quite a simper.â Says Tibb, whose plays are worse than bad, âIt makes my forehead flat:â And being classical, he'll add, âI'm blowed if I'm like that,â Courtly, all candour, owns his portrait true; 'Oh, yes, it's like; yes, very; it will do. Extremely like meâevery featureâbut That plain pug-nose; now mine's the Grecian cut! Her Grace surveys her face with drooping lid; Prefers the portrait which Sir Thomas did; Owns that o'er this some traits of truth are sprinkled; But views the brow with anger-âWhy, it's wrinkled!â âLike me!â cries Sir Turtle; âI'll lay two to one It would only be guessed by my foes; No, no, it is plain there are spots in the sun, Which accounts for these spots on my nose.â âA likeness!â cries Crosslook, the lawyer, and sneers; âYes, the wig, throat, and forehead I spy, And the mouth, chin, and cheeks, and the nose and the ears, But it gives me a cast in the eye!â Thus needs it the courage of old Cousin Hotspur, To sit to an artist who flatters no sitter; Yet self-love will urge us to seek him, for what spur So potent as that, though it make the truth bitter! And thus are all flocking, to see PhÅbus mocking, Or making queer faces, a visage per minute; And truly 'tis shocking, if winds should be rocking, The building, or clouds darken all that's within it, To witness the frights Which shadows and lights Manufacture, as like as an owl to a linnet. For there, while you sit up, Your countenance lit up, The mists fly across, a magnificent rack; And your portrait's a patch with its bright and its black, Out-Rembrandting Rembrandt, in ludicrous woe, Like a chimney-sweep caught in a shower of snow. Yet nothing can keep the crowd below, And still they mount up stair by stair; And every morn, by the hurry and hum, Each seeking a prize in the lottery there You fancy the âlast day of drawingâ has come. 1842. TO NELL GWYNNE'S LOOKING-GLASS. Glass antique,'twixt thee and Nell Draw we here a parallel. She, like thee, was forced to bear All reflections, foul or fair. Thou art deep and bright within, Depths as bright belonged to Gwynne; Thou art very frail as well, Frail as flesh is,âso was Nell. Thou, her glass, art silver-lined, She too, had a silver mind: Thine is fresh till this far day, Hers till death ne'er wore away: Thou dost to thy surface win Wandering glances, so did Gwynne; Eyes on thee long love to dwell, So men's eyes would do on Nell. Life-like forms in thee are sought, Such the forms the actress wrought; Truth unfailing rests in you, Nell, whate'er she was, was true. Clear as virtue, dull as sin, Thou art oft, as oft was Gwynne; Breathe on thee, and drops will swellâ Bright tears dimmed the eyes of Nell. Thine's a frame to charm the sight, Framed was she to give delight, Waxen forms here truly show Charles above and Nell below; But between them, chin with chin, Stuart stands as low as Gwynne,â Paired, yet parted,âmeant to tell Charles was opposite to Nell. Round the glass wherein her face Smiled so oft, her âarmsâ we trace; Thou, her mirror, hast the pair, Lion here, and leopard there. She had part in these,âakin To the lion-heart was Gwynne; And the leopard's beauty fell With its spots to bounding Nell. Oft inspected, ne'er seen through, Thou art firm, if brittle too; So her will, on good intent, Might be broken, never bent. What the glass was when therein Beamed the face of glad Nell Gwynne, Was that face by beauty's spell To the honest soul of Nell. 1842. LOVE SEEKING A LODGING. At Leila's heart from day to day Love, boy-like, knocked, and ran away; But Love, grown older, seeking then, âLodgings for single gentlemen,â Returned unto his former ground, And knocked, but no admittance foundâ With his rat, tat, tat. His false alarms remembered still, Love, now in earnest, fared but ill; For Leila in her heart could swear, As still he knocked, âThere's no one there,â A single god, he then essayed With single knocks to lure the maidâ With his single knock. Each passer-by who watched the wight, Cried, âLove, you won't lodge there to-night!â And Love, while listening half confessed That all was dead in Leila's breast. Yet lest that light heart only slept, Bold Love up to the casement creptâ With his tip, tap, tap. No answer;ââWell,â cried Love, âI'll wait, And keep off Envy, Fear, and Hate; No other passion there shall dwell If I'm shut outâwhy, here's a bell!â He rang; the ring made Leila start, And Love found lodgings in her heart, With his magic ring. 1842. THE TOUR OF LOVE AND TIME. Long since, as tradition unravels, Love, weary of Venus's eyes, With Time started off on his travels, To make the grand tour of the skies; But, though they departed together, To keep side by side was in vain; Love basked in the fine sunny weather, While Time was seen trudging through rain. Love, calling and panting, long after Came up with him, ready to drop; And pleaded, with song and sweet laughter, But could not persuade Time to stop. Old Obstinate paused not a minute, Though round him there grew in his march A cloud with Jove's thunderbolt in it, Or Iris threw o'er him her arch. âCome skip me a twelvemonth, old fellow, And call it a leap-year, you know! Look round usâblue, red, green, and yellowâ I must have some sport as we go. Why travel while noon burns above there? Now let us wait here till it's dark,â Just stop while I aim at yon dove there,â If not,âwell, I must have a lark.â Now swift as the thought that comes o'er him, Love snatched Time's scythe as he mows; He crops not one blossom before him, But cuts all the thorns from the rose. Still Time plodded on up the mountain, Ne'er raising his eyes from the dust; While Love stays to drink at a fountain, And drops the scythe in itâto rust. But Time, in due course, nothing reaping, Again to the fountain came round; The scythe is once more in his keeping, For Love lay asleep on the ground. He woke, and but two moments reckoned, To seize on Time's glass and escape; Love poured out its sand in a second, And filled it with juice from the grape. Time now, o'er the hills and the levels, Guessed minutes by mere grains of sand, Till, when the thief dropped 'mid his revels, The glass was restored to his hand. Then Love to the Fairies flew frantic, Possessed with a project sublime; Brought scissors, and, desperate antic! Cut off the white beard of old Time. Day and Night saw the woeful disaster,â Time stood, from astonishment, still; The Hours didn't know their own master, But frolicked about at their will. Eight and Nine were at Sixes and Sevens, Twelve struck before Three had begun; Five changed her old post for Eleven's, While Love kissed Eleven for One. In turn all disclaimed their old father, Though some said they thought he was like; And none were for strikingâthe rather. Because 'twas a general strike. Jove, now, looking down on these gambols, Saw Chaos resuming his state,â And so put an end to Love's rambles, While waltzing intensely with Eight. âYour tour, crazy Love, has its dangers, And here it must end,â said the god; âHenceforth, you and Time must be strangers, Or, meeting, pass on with a nod. Time, ev'ry brief instant is dying, While you have a life without end; Your visits to him must be flyingâ Eternity claims youâascend!â 1843. NEW YEAR'S ODE. TO THE WINNER OF THE ST. NISBETTâSEASON 1844. âTrumpet tongued against The deep damnation of her takingâoff.â âMacbeth. âRobbing the stage was, in those days, a practice common enough.âRoderick Random. Give backââgive us back the wild freshness of morning,â Ere light orange-blossoms weighed widowhood down! And pause, oh, Sir William, ere one house adorning, You cast in deep shadow our houses in town. Why veil from the public its gayest of brides? The miser alone buries gold in a box; What artist, triumphant, his masterpiece hides? We leave to the stage its duennas and locks. Bound fast, yet again let the Favourite run! Both thine and our own!âa petition not visible; For though it is true man and wife are but one, She, single or wedded, is two, and divisible. While owning thee winner, the town has its rights; The âwifeâ is all thineâ'tis the âmadcapâ we ask! Hold captive the Woman, most conqu'ring of Knights, But give back the Spirit with Comedy's mask. For brave Widow Nisbett no more may we burn; As blithe Widow Nisbett she flies from the scene; But let, Sir, âoh, let Widow Cheerly return, And her who contrasted with ripe Widow Green! Enclose not the orchard while gathering its fruits; The garden's your own, Sir, yet spare us some flowers. Let marriage ne'er pluck up wild mirth by the roots: The widow is thineâbut the actress is ours. Giving up to dull parties (though Wedlock's the teacher) What's meant for mankind, causes patience to reel: And why should a Boothby thus follow a Becher! The other Sir William, who snapped up O'Neill! In favour of privacy, prejudice ran: It carried off Kembles, the Stephens, the Tree; 'Twas doubtful if safe from some desperate man, Was quiet Miss Tidswell, or old Mrs. D. But deeper the sorrow that Nisbett has cost; More stern thy resentment, susceptible town; She wedded, returned;âweds again, and we're lost; From Scylla escaped, in Charybdis we drown! Blest winner, but cruel! most cruel to Art! Yet more to Young London who stood by her throne; Who now shall report how she toppeth her part?â Who rush for a seat?âshe resides at her own! Who weds a mere beauty, dooms dozens to grieve; Who marries an heiress, leaves hundreds undone; Who bears off an actress (she never took leave), Deprives a whole city of rational fun. But farewell the glances and nods of St. Nisbett; We list for her short ringing laughter in vain, And yetâbereaved London!âwhat think you of this bet? â âA hundred to one we shall see her again!â CHRISTMAS CHIT-CHAT, IN A LARGE FAMILY CIRCLE. âThe day of all days we have seen Is Christmas,â said Sue to Eugene; âMore welcome in village and city Than Mayday, âsaid Andrew to Kitty. âWhy âMistletoe'sâ twenty times sweeter Than âMay,ââ said Matilda to Peter; âAnd so you will find it, if I'm a True prophet,â said James to Jemima. âI'll stay up to supper, no bed,â Then lisped little Laura to Ned. âThe girls all good-natured and dressy, And bright-cheeked,â said Arthur to Jessie; âYes, hoping ere next year to marry, The madcaps!â said Charlotte to Harry. âSo steaming, so savoury, so juicy, The feast,â said fat Charley to Lucy. âQuadrilles and Charades might come on Before dinner,â said Martha to John. âYou'll find the roast beef when you're dizzy, A settler,â said Walter to Lizzy. âOh, horrid! one wing of a wren, With a pea,â said Belinda to Ben. âSublime!â saidâdisplaying his legâ George Frederick Augustus to Peg. âAt Christmas refinement is all fuss And nonsense,â said Fan to Adolphus. âWould rompsâor a tale of a fairyâ Best suit you,â said Robert to Mary. âAt stories that work ghost and witch hard, I tremble,â said Rosa to Richard. âA ghostly hari-standing dilemma Needs âbishop,ââ said Alfred to Emma; âWhat fun when with fear a stout crony Turns pale,â said Maria to Tony; âAnd Hector, unable to rally, Runs screaming,â said Jacob to Sally. âWhile you and I dance in the dark The polka,â said Ruth unto Mark: âEach catching, according to fancy, His neighbour,â said wild Tom to Nancy; âTill candles, to show what we can do, Are brought in,â said Ann to Orlando; âAnd then we all laugh what is truly a Heart's laugh,â said William to Julia. âThen sofas and chairs are put even, And carpets,â said Helen to Stephen; âAnd so we all sit down again, Supping twice,â said sly Joseph to Jane. âNow bring me my clogs and my spaniel, And light me,â said Dinah to Daniel. âMy dearest, you've emptied that chalice Six times,â said fond Edmund to Alice. âWe are going home tealess and coffeeless, Shabby!â said Soph to Theophilus; âTo meet again under the holly, Et cetera,â said Paul to fair Polly. âDear Uncle has ordered his chariot, All's over,â said Matthew to Harriet. âAnd pray now be all going to bedward,â Said kind Aunt Rebecca to Edward! 1845. LINES WRITTEN ON THE FIRST PAGE OF MULBERRY LEAVES. The following additional poems reached the Editor while the volume was passing through the press. A book which the Members of âThe Mulberries,â A Club of Shakspeariansâ Contributed. Like one who stands On the bright verge of some enchanted shore, Where notes from airy harps, and hidden hands, Are, from the green grass and the golden sands, Far echoed, o'er and o'er, As if the trancÃ¨d listener to invite Into that world of light; Thus stood I here, Musing awhile on these unblotted leaves, Till the blank pages brighten'd, and mine ear Found music in their rustling, sweet and clear, And wreaths that Fancy weaves Entwin'd the volumeâfill'd with grateful lays And songs of rapturous praise. No sound I heard, But echoed o'er and o'er our Shakespeare's name, One lingering note of love, link'd word to word, Till every leaf was as a fairy bird Whose song is still the same: Or each was as a flower, with folded cells For Pucks and Ariels! And visions grewâ Visions not brief, though bright, which frosted age Hath fail'd to rob of one diviner hue, Making them more familiar, yet more newâ These flash'd into the page; A group of crownÃ¨d thingsâthe radiant themes Of Shakespeare's Avon dreams! Of crownÃ¨d thingsâ (Rare crowns of living gems and lasting flowers) Some in the human likeness, some with wings Dyed in the beauty of ethereal springsâ Some shedding piteous showers Of natural tears, and some in smiles that fell Like sunshine on a dell. Here Art had caught The perfect mould of Hamlet's princely form, The frantic Thane, fiend-cheated, lived, methought; Here Timon howl'd: anon, sublimely wrought, Stood Lear, amid the storm; There Romeo droop'd, or soar'dâwhile Jacques here, Still watched the weeping deer. And then a throng Of heavenly natures, clad in earthly vest, Like angel-apparitions, pass'd along; The rich-lipp'd Rosalind all light and song; And Imogen's white breast: Low-voiced Cordelia with her stifled sighs, And Juliet's shrouded eyes. The page, turn'd o'er, Shew'd Kateâor Violaâmy âLady Tongueââ The lost Venetian with her loving Moor; The Maiden-wonder on the haunted shore, Happy, and fair, and young: Till on a poor, love-martyr'd mind I lookâ Ophelia, at the brook. With sweet Ann Page The bright thing ended; for, untouch'd by time, Came Falstaff, laughter-laurell'd, young in age, With many a ripe and sack-devoted sage! And deathless clowns sublime Crowded the leaf, to vanish at a swoop, Like Oberon and his troop. Here sat, entranced, Malvolio, legâtrapp'd:âhe who served the Jew Still with the fiend seem'd running;âthen advanced Messina's pretty piece of flesh, and danced With Bottom and his crew; Mercutio, Benedick, press'd points of wit, And Osrick made his hit. At these, e'er long, Awoke my laughter, and the spell was past: Of the gay multitude, a marvellous throng, No trace is here,â no tints, no word, no song. On these bare leaves are castâ The altar has been rear'd, an offering fitâ The flame is still unlit. Oh! who now bent In humble reverence, hopes one wreath to bind Worthy of him, whose genius, strangely blent, Could kindle âwonder and astonishmentâ In Milton's starry mind? Who stood alone, but not as one apart, And saw Man's inmost heart! TRUTH AND RUMOUR. As Truth once passed on her pilgrim way, To rest by a hedge-side, thorny and sere, Few wanderers there she charmed to stay, Though hers were the tidings that all should hear. She whispering sang, and her deep rich voice, Yet richer, deeper, each moment grew; And still though it bade the crowd rejoice, Her strain but a scanty audience drew. But Rumour close by as she plucked a reed From a babbling brook, detained the throng; With a hundred tongues that never agreed She gave to the winds a mocking song. The crowd with delight its echoes caught, And closer around her yet they drew; So wondrous and wild the lore she taught, They listened, entranced, the long day through. The sun went down: when he rose again, And sleep had becalmed each listener's mind, The voice of Rumour had rung in vain, No echo had left a charm behind. But Truth's pure note, ever whispering clear, Wandering in air, fresh sweeetness caught; Then all unnotic'd it touched the ear, And filled with music the cells of thought. SCIENCE AND GOOD-HUMOUR. A Feast of old was spread; The guests sat down, sings rumour, With Science at their head, And at the foot Good-humour. But soon, though rich the fare, One half the group sat pining, While all the others there Were diligently dining. 'Twas Science, so 'twas sung, Who checked his hearers' wishes By learned descants, rung On countless cooling dishes. Good-humour fared with those Who not one moment wasted, But asked for what they chose, And relish'd all they tasted. No chicken Science carved, Without a lecture sterile, To prove, where one man starved, A thousand ate in peril. His Vice with laughter shook, As there the board grew thinner; He thought not of the cook, But only of the dinner. On wines would Science chat, On alcohol and acid, On vintage this and that, In accents slow and placid. But while these maxims dropt, They set each listener thinking; And there the wine had stopped, Had Humour not been drinking. While Science, glass in hand, Show'd how'twas manufactured; Good-humour's jovial band A score of bottles fractured. As Science proved, past doubt, That mirth we should not care for; Good-humour laugh'd, without Inquiring why or wherefore. Then rose a cry for song. As Science led the table, The call was loud and long On vocalist so able. But Science hadâof courseâ A cold, destroying music; And fear'd that tones so hoarse Would make both me and you sick. At length, much breath and time Consumed in sweet persuading; In Dutch or German rhyme Hear Science serenading. The cadences though pure, Are rather soporific; The strain is quite obscure, But thenâ'tis scientific. His flourishings are vain, Though each he twice rehearses; To sing the song again, He stops at fifteen verses. Apollo has a hunch, A gap is in the ballad; No brandy's in the punch, No lobster in the salad. Good-humour now essays, A careless, easy measure; He sings, not he, for praise, He only sings for pleasure. His tones are not so clear, And clouds the sparkles smother; Yet though you stop one ear, You open wide the other. His slips in time and tune, Had nigh set Science swearing; But nightingales in June Such censures might be sharing. Right simple was the song, He sang it like a linnet; 'Twas not so very long, But something deep was in it. Now forth at eventide They saunter,âsome are rushing; Through garden-walks they glide, A maze of blossoms blushing. Here Science grew distressed, The flow'rs were not in order; Good-humour liked them best When bursting through the border. Then Science spoke, deep-learn'd, Of petals, lobes, and anthers; On tiger-lilies turn'd His talkâand then on panthers. The roses he despised As common, vulgar, vagrant; But these Good-humour prized, So rich were they, and fragrant. No beauty Science pleased, Of plants he sought the rarest; Good-humour beauty seizedâ Of plants he loved the fairest. O'er buds, with heart of ice, One pored, with eyesight failing; While airs from Paradise The other was inhaling. Good-humour stopped to mark The glowworm's light, enchanted; When Scienceâbut 'twas darkâ To read an essay panted. Anon the beetle hums, Good-humour hearkens to it; But Science, when it comes, Will thrust a sharp pin through it. The thronging stars steal forth, Yet Science views no wonder; He speaks of east and north, Of meteors, belts, and thunder. Of distance, shown by miles, But scarce his eye upraises; His mute companion smiles, And blesses while he gazes. As homeward now they stroll, The mind of Science stranded, Good-humour feels his soul With rich delight expanded. While Science, sleepy drone, His chamber seeksâthe upperâ Good-humour, not alone, Is sitting down to supper.</field>
