      <field name="fulltext">A DIALOGUE AT FIESOLE HE. Halt here awhile. That mossy-cushioned seat Is for your queenliness a natural throne; As I am fitly couched on this low sward, Here at your feet. SHE. And I, in thought, at yours: My adoration, deepest. HE. Deep, so deep, I have no thought wherewith to fathom it; Or, shall I say, no flight of song so high, To reach the Heaven whence you look down on me, My star, my far-off star! SHE. If far, yet fixed: No shifting planet leaving you to seek Where now it shines. HE. A little light, if near, Glows livelier than the largest orb in Heaven. SHE. But little lights burn quickly out, and then, Another must be kindled. Stars gleam on, Unreached, but unextinguished. . . . Now, the song. HE. Yes, yes, the song: your music to my verse. SHE. In this sequestered dimple of the hill, Forgotten by the furrow, none will hear: Only the nightingales, that misconceive The mid-day darkness of the cypresses For curtained night. HE. And they will hush to hear A sudden singing sweeter than their own. Delay not the enchantment, but begin. SHE (singing). If you were here, if you were here, The cattle-bells would sound more clear; The cataracts would flash and leap More silvery from steep to steep; The farewell of a rosier glow Soften the summit of the snow; The valley take a tenderer green; In dewy gorge and dim ravine The loving bramble-flowers embrace The rough thorn with a gentler grace; The gentian open bluer eyes, In bluer air, to bluer skies: The frail anemone delay, The jonquil hasten on its way, The primrose linger past its time, The violet prolong its prime; And every flower that seeks the light, On Alpine lowland, Alpine height, Wear April's smile without its tear, If you were here; if you were here! If you were here, the Spring would wake A fuller music in the brake. The mottled misselthrush would pipe A note more ringing, rich, and ripe; The whitethroat peer above its nest With brighter eye and downier breast; The cuckoo greet the amorous year, Chanting its joy without its jeer; The lark betroth the earth and sky With peals of heavenlier minstrelsy; And every wildwood bird rejoice On fleeter wing, with sweeter voice, If you were here! If you were here, I too should feel The moisture of the Springtide steal Along my veins, and rise and roll Through every fibre of my soul. In my live breast would melt the snow, And all its channels flush and flow With waves of life and streams of song, Frozen and silent all too long. A something in each wilding flower, Something in every scented shower, Something in flitting voice and wing, Would drench my heart and bid me sing: Not in this feeble halting note, But, like the merle's exulting throat, With carol full and carol clear, If you were here, if you were here. HE. Hark! How the hills have caught the strain, and seem Loth to surrender it, and now enclose Its cadence in the silence of their folds. Still as you sang, the verses had the wing Of that which buoyed them, and your aery voice Lifted my drooping music from the ground. Now that you cease, there is an empty nest, From which the full-fledged melody hath flown. SHE. Dare I with you contend in metaphor, It might not be so fanciful to show That nest, and eggs, and music, all are yours. But modesty in poets is too rare, To be reproved for error. Let me then Be crowned full queen of song, albeit in sooth I am but consort, owing my degree To the real sceptred Sovereign at my side. But now repay my music, and in kind. Unfolding to my ear the youngest flower Of song that seems to blossom all the year; âDelay not the enchantment, but begin.â HE (reciting). Yet, you are here; yes, you are here. There's not a voice that wakes the year, In vale frequented, upland lone, But steals some sweetness from your own. When dream and darkness have withdrawn, I feel you in the freshening dawn: You fill the noonday's hushed repose; You scent the dew of daylight's close. The twilight whispers you are nigh; The stars announce you in the sky. The moon, when most alone in space, Fills all the heavens with your face. In darkest hour of deepest night, I see you with the spirit's sight; And slumber murmurs in my ear, âHush! she is here. Sleep! she is here.â SHE. Hark how you bare your secret when you sing! Imagination's universal scope Can swift endue this gray and shapeless world With the designs and colour of the sky. What want you with our fixed and lumpish forms, You, unconditioned arbiter of air? âYet, you are here; yes, you are here.â The span Of nimble fancy leaps the interval, And brings the distant nearer than the near. HE. Distance is nearer than proximity, When distance longs, proximity doth not. SHE. The near is always distant to the mind That craves for satisfaction of its end; Nor doth the distance ever feel so far As when the end is touched. Retard that goal, Prolonging appetite beyond the feast That feeds anticipation. HE. Specious foil! That parries every stroke before 'tis made. Yet surfeit's self doth not more surely cloy Than endless fasting. SHE. Still a swifter cure Waits on too little than attends too much. While disappointment merely woundeth Hope, The deadly blow by disenchantment dealt Strikes at the heart of Faith. O happy you, The favourites of Fancy, who replace Illusion with illusion, and conceive Fresh cradles in the dark womb of the grave. While we, prosaic victims, prove that time Kills love while leaving loveless life alive, You still, divinely duped, sing deathless love, And with your wizard music, once again, Make Winter Spring. Yet surely you forgive That I have too much pity for the flowers Children and poets cull to fling away, To be an April nosegay. HE. How you swell The common chorus! Women, who are wronged So roughly by men's undiscerning word, As though one pattern served to show them all, Should be more just to poets. These, in truth, Diverge from one another nowise less Than âwomen,â vaguely labelled: children some, With childish voice and nature, lyric bards, Weaklings that on life's threshold sweetly wail, But never from that silvery treble pass Into the note and chant of manliness. Their love is like their verse, a frail desire, A fluttering fountain falling feebly back Into its shallow origin. Next there are The poets of contention, wrestlers born, Who challenge iron Circumstance, and fail: Generous and strong, withal not strong enough, Since lacking sinewy wisdom, hard as life. The love of these is like the lightning spear, And shrivels whom it touches. They consume All things within their reach, and, last of all, Their lonely selves; and then through time they tower, Sublime but charred, and wear on their high fronts The gloomy glory of the sunlit pine. But the great gods of Song, in clear white light, The radiance of their godhead, calmly dwell, And with immutable cold starlike gaze Scan both the upper and the under world, As it revolves, themselves serenely fixed. Their bias is the bias of the sphere, That turns all ways, but turns away from none, Save to return to it. They have no feud With gods or men, the living or the dead, The past or present, and their words complete Life's incompleteness with a healing note. For they are not more sensitive than strong, More wise than tender; understanding all, At peace with all, at peace with life and death, And love that gives a meaning unto life And takes from death the meaning and the sting: At peace with hate, and every opposite. Were I but one of theseâpresumptuous thought!â Even you, the live fulfilment of such dreams As these secrete, would hazard well your love On my more largely loving. 'Twould be you, Yes, even you, that first would flag and fail In either of my choosing; you, whose wing Would droop on mine and pray to be upborne. And when my pinions did no more suffice For that their double load, then softly down, Softly and smoothly as descending lark That hath fulfilled its rhapsody in Heaven, And with diminished music must decline To earthy sounds and concepts, I should curb Illimitable longings to the range Of lower aspiration. Were I such!â But, since I am notâ SHE. Am not? Who shall say, Save she who tests, and haply to her loss? 'Tis better left untested. Strange that you, Who can imagine whatso thing you will, Should lack imagination to appraise Imagination at its topmost worth. Now wield your native sceptre and extend Your fancy forth where Florence overbrims In eddies fairer even than herself. Look how the landscape smiles complacently At its own beauty, as indeed it may; Villa and vineyard each a separate home, Containing possibilities unseen, Materials for your pleasure. Now disport! Which homestead may it please my lord of song To chalk for his, as those rough Frenchmen did Who came with bow-legged Charles to justify Savonarola's scourgeful prophecies? Shall it be that one gazing in our face, Not jealous of its beauty, but exposed To all the wantonness of sun and air, With roses girt, with roses garlanded, And balustraded terrace topped with jars Of clove carnations; unambitious roof, Italian equivalent to house Love in a cottage? Why, the very place For her you once described! Wait! Let me see, Can I recall the lines? Yes, thus they ran. Do you remember them? Or are they now A chronicle forgotten and erased From that convenient palimpsest, the heart? In dewy covert of her eyes The secret of the violet lies; The sun and wind caress and pair In the lithe wavelets of her hair; The fragrance of the warm soft south Hovers about her honeyed mouth; And, when she moves, she floats through air Like zephyr-wafted gossamer. Hers is no lore of dumb dead books; Her learning liveth in her looks; And still she shows, in meek replies, Wisdom enough to deem you wise. Her voice as soothing is and sweet As whispers of the waving wheat, And in the moisture of her kiss Is April-like deliciousness. Like gloaming-hour, she doth inspire A vague, an infinite desire; And, like the stars, though out of sight, Filleth the loneliness of night. Come how she may, or slow or fleet, She brings the morning on her feet; Gone, leaves behind a nameless pain, Like the sadness of a silenced strain. HE. A youthful dream. SHE. Yet memory can surmise That young dream fruited to reality, Then, like reality, was dream no more. All dreams are youthful; you are dreaming still. What lovely visions denizen your sleep! Let me recall another; for I know All you have written, thought, and felt, and much You neither thought nor felt, but only sang. A wondrous gift, a godlike gift, that breathes Into our exiled clay unexiled lives, Manlier than Adam, comelier than Eve. That massive villa, we both know so well, With one face set toward Settignano, one Gazing at Bellosguardo, and its rear Locked from the north by clustered cypresses, That seem like fixed colossal sentinels, And tower above its tower, but look not in, Might be abode for her whom you conceived In tropes so mystical, you must forgive If recollection trips. To dwell with her is calmly to abide Through every change of time and every flux of tide. In her the Present, Past, and Future meet, The Father, and the Son, and dovelike Paraclete. She holdeth silent intercourse with Night, Still journeying with the stars, and shining with their light. Her love, illumination; her embrace, The sweep of angels' wings across a mortal's face. Her lap is piled with autumn fruits, her brow Crowned with the blossoming trails that smile from April's bough. Like wintry stars that shine with frosty fire, Her loftiness excites to elevate desire. To love her is to burn with such a flame As lights the lamp which bears the Sanctuary's name. That lamp burns on for ever, day and night, Before her mystic shrine. I am its acolyte. HE. The merest foam of fancy; foam and spray. SHE. Foam-drift of fancy that hath ebbed away. See how the very simile rebukes Man's all unsealike longings! For confess, While ocean still returns, the puny waves Of mortal love are sucked into the sand, Their motion felt, their music heard, no more. Look when the vines are linking hands, and seem As pausing from the dance of Spring, or just Preparing to renew it, round and round, On the green carpet of the bladed corn, That spreads about their feet: corn, vine, and fig, Almond and mulberry, cherry, and pear, and peach, Not taught to know their place, but left to range Up to the villa's walls, windows, and doors, And peep into its life and smile good-day, A portion of its homeliness and joy: A poet's villa once, a poet's again, If you but dream it such; a roof for her, To whom you wroteâI wonder who she wasâ This saucy sonnet; saucy, withal sweet, And O, how true of the reflected love You poets render to your worshippers. TRUE AS THE DIAL TO THE SUN. You are the sun, and I the dial, sweet, So you can mark on me what time you will. If you move slowly, how can I move fleet? And when you halt, I too must fain be still. Chide not the cloudy humours of my brow, If you behold no settled sunshine there: Rather upbraid your own, sweet, and allow, My looks cannot be foul if yours be fair. Then from the heaven of your high witchery shine, And I with smiles shall watch the hours glide by; You have no mood that is not straightway mine; My cheek but takes complexion from your eye. All that I am dependeth so on you, What clouds the sun must cloud the dial too. HE. No man should quarrel with his Past, and I Maintain no feud with mine. Do we not ripen, Ripen and mellow in love, unto the close, Thanks no more to the present than the past? First love is fresh but fugitive as Spring, A wilding flower no sooner plucked than faded; And summer's sultry fervour ends in storm, Recriminating thunder, wasteful tears, And angry gleam of lightning menaces. Give me October's meditative haze, Its gossamer mornings, dewy-wimpled eves, Dewy and fragrant, fragrant and secure, The long slow sound of farmward-wending wains, When homely Love sups quiet 'mong its sheaves, Sups 'mong its sheaves, its sickle at its side, And all is peace, peace and plump fruitfulness. SHE. Picture of all we dream and we desire: Autumn's grave cheerfulness and sober bliss, Rich resignation, humble constancy. For, prone to bear the load piled up by life, We, once youth's pasture season at an end, Submit to crawl. Unbroken to the last, You spurn the goad of stern taskmaster Time. Even 'mid autumn harvest you demand Returning hope and blossom of the Spring, All seasons and sensations, and at once, Or in too quick succession. Do we blame? We envy rather the eternal youth We cannot share. But youth is pitiless, And, marching onward, neither asks nor seeks Who falls behind. Thus women who are wise, Beside their thresholds knitting homely gear, Wave wistful salutation as you pass, And think of you regretfully, when gone: A soft regret, a sweet regret, that is Only the mellow fruit of unplucked joy. Now improvise some other simple strain, That with harmonious cadence may attune The vain and hazard discords of discourse. HE. When Love was young, it asked for wings, That it might still be roaming; And away it sped, by fancy led, Through dawn, and noon, and gloaming. Each daintiness that blooms and blows It wooed in honeyed metre, And when it won the sweetest sweet, It flew off to a sweeter: When Love was young. When Love was old, it craved for rest, For home, and hearth, and haven; For quiet talks round sheltered walks, And long lawns smoothly shaven. And what Love sought, at last it found, A roof, a porch, a garden, And from a fond unquestioning heart Peace, sympathy, and pardon, When Love was old. SHE. Simple, in sooth, and haply true: withal, Too, too autumnal even for my heart. I never weary of your vernal note. Carol again, and sing me back my youth With the redundant melodies of Spring. HE. I breathe my heart in the heart of the rose, The rose that I pluck and send you, With a prayer that the perfume its leaves enclose May kiss, and caress, and tend you: Caress and tend you till I can come, To the garden where first I found you, And the thought that as yet in the rose is dumb Can ripple in music round you. O rose, that will shortly be her guest, You may well look happy, at leaving: Will you lie in the cradle her snowy breast Doth rock with its gentle heaving? Will you mount the throne of her hazel hair, That waves like a summer billow, Or be hidden and hushed, at nightfall prayer, In the folds of her dimpled pillow? And when she awakes at dawn to feel If you have been dreaming with her, Then the whole of your secret, sweet rose, reveal, And say I am coming thither: And that when there is silence in earth and sky, And peace from the cares that cumber, She must not ask if your leaves or I Be clasped in her perfumed slumber. SHE. Give me your hand; and, if you will, keep mine Engraffed in yours, as slowly thus we skirt La Doccia's dark declivity, and make Athwart Majano's pathless pines a path To lead us onward haply where it may. Lo! the Carrara mountains flush to view, That in the noonday were not visible. Shall we not fold this comfort to our hearts, Humbly rejoiced to think as there are heights Seen only in the sunset, so our lives, If that they lack not loftiness, may wear A glow of glory on their furrowed fronts, Until they faint and fade into the night! IN THE MONTH WHEN SINGS THE CUCKOO I Hark! Spring is coming. Her herald sings, Cuckoo! The air resounds and the woodland rings, Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Leave the milking pail and the mantling cream, And down by the meadow, and up by the stream, Where movement is music and life a dream, In the month when sings the cuckoo. II Away with old Winter's frowns and fears, Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Now May with a smile dries April's tears. Cuckoo! When the bees are humming in bloom and bud, And the kine sit chewing the moist green cud, Shall the snow not melt in a maiden's blood, In the month when sings the cuckoo? III The popinjay mates and the lapwing woos; Cuckoo! In the lane is a footstep. I wonder whose? Cuckoo! Cuckoo! How sweet are low whispers! and sweet, so sweet, When the warm hands touch and the shy lips meet, And sorrel and woodruff are round our feet, In the month when sings the cuckoo. IV Your face is as fragrant as moist musk-rose; Cuckoo! Cuckoo! All the year in your cheek the windflower blows; Cuckoo! Cuckoo! You flit as blithely as bird on wing; And when you answer, and when they sing, I know not if they, or You, be Spring, In the month when pairs the cuckoo. V Will you love me still when the blossom droops? Cuckoo! When the cracked husk falls and the fieldfare troops? Cuckoo! Let sere leaf or snowdrift shade your brow, By the soul of the Spring, sweet-heart, I vow, I will love you then as I love you now, In the month when sings the cuckoo. VI Smooth, smooth is the sward where the loosestrife grows, Cuckoo! Cuckoo! As we lie and hear in a dreamy doze, Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! And smooth is the curve of a maiden's cheek, When she loves to listen but fears to speak, And we yearn but we know not what we seek, In the month when sings the cuckoo. VII But in warm mid summer we hear no more, Cuckoo! And August brings not, with all its store, Cuckoo! When Autumn shivers on Winter's brink, And the wet wind wails through crevice and chink, We gaze at the logs, and sadly think Of the month when called the cuckoo. VIII But the cuckoo comes back and shouts once more, Cuckoo! And the world is as young as it was before; Cuckoo! Cuckoo! It grows not older for mortal tears, For the falsehood of men or for women's fears; 'Tis as young as it was in the bygone years, When first was heard the cuckoo. IX I will love you then as I love you now. Cuckoo! What cares the Spring for a broken vow? Cuckoo! Cuckoo! The broods of last year are pairing, this; And there never will lack, while love is bliss, Fresh ears to cozen, fresh lips to kiss, In the month when sings the cuckoo. X O cruel bird! will you never have done? Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! You sing for the cloud, as you sang for the sun; Cuckoo! Cuckoo! You mock me now as you mocked me then, When I knew not yet that the loves of men Are as brief as the glamour of glade and glen, And the glee of the fleeting cuckoo. XI O, to lie once more in the long fresh grass, Cuckoo! And dream of the sounds and scents that pass; Cuckoo! Cuckoo! To savour the woodbine, surmise the dove, With no roof save the far-off sky above, And a curtain of kisses round couch of love, While distantly called the cuckoo. XII But if now I slept, I should sleep to wake To the sleepless pang and the dreamless ache, To the wild babe blossom within my heart, To the darkening terror and swelling smart, To the searching look and the words apart, And the hint of the tell-tale cuckoo. XIII The meadow grows thick, and the stream runs deep, Cuckoo! Where the aspens quake and the willows weep; Cuckoo! Cuckoo! The dew of the night and the morning heat Will close up the track of my farewell feet:â So good-bye to the life that once was sweet, When so sweetly called the cuckoo. XIV The kine are unmilked, and the cream unchurned, Cuckoo! The pillow unpressed, and the quilt unturned, Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 'Twas easy to gibe at a beldame's fear For the quick brief blush and the sidelong tear; But if maids will gad in the youth of the year, They should heed what says the cuckoo. XV There are marks in the meadow laid up for hay, Cuckoo! And the tread of a foot where no foot should stray: Cuckoo! Cuckoo! The banks of the pool are broken down, Where the water is quiet and deep and brown;â The very spot, if one longed to drown, And no more to hear the cuckoo. XVI 'Tis a full taut net and a heavy haul. Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Look! her auburn hair and her trim new shawl! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Draw a bit this way where 'tis not so steep; There, cover her face! She but seems asleep; While the swallows skim and the graylings leap, And joyously sings the cuckoo.</field>
