And so you shall be still of me &amp; mine, With Barnabe couch'd in a reeling ryme: Nor wonder, friend, if his dimensions reele, Whose head makes such Jambicks with his heele. Upon this Worke. This three dayes taske was once imposed me, In the first Spring of my minoritie; No edge of Razer then had toucht my chin, Nor downy shade approach'd my supple Skin; I knew not th' postures of this Indian vapor, Nor made my Sacrifice unto my Taper; I'd ne're seene any Curtaine nor partition, Which beget worke for Surgeon and Physician; I was a Novice in the Schoole of Sin, Nor yet did taste, what others dived in. Excuse this Subject then, if't doe not fit The nicenesse of this Age for weight and wit. Birds flicker first before they learne to fly, And trust me on my credit so did I. “Great Tasks when they'r to shorter times confin'd, “Will force a Worke mount lower than the mind. Oppido To the Traveller. Townes while thou walk'st, and seest this poetrie, And seeing stumblest, thou art Barnabe. To the Translator. That paltry Patcher is a bald Translater Whose aule bores at the Words but not the matter: But this Translator makes good use of lether By stitching ryme and reason both together. The Index of this Work. Vulcane, Grape, Venus, Bottle, Silen's hooke, Have all explain'd the title of this Booke. Thus through vast Desarts, promontories wilde, Parnassus love drawes Bacchus onely childe. Barnabee's Journall, English and Latine: His Northerne Journey: First Part. Mirtilus &amp; Faustulus inter-speakers. Mirtil. O Faustulus, stretch thy hand out, Take thy Liquor, doe not stand out; Art thou prest with griping dolour? Let the grape give thee her colour. Bread's a binder, wealth's a miser, Drinke down care, and thou art wiser. O Faustulus, tell thy true hart, In what Region, Coast, or New part, Field or Fold thou hast beene bousing, Without linnen, bedding, housing, In what Taverne, pray thee show us, Here on Earth, or else below us? Faustul. O Mirtilus, I will show thee, Thousand places since I saw thee, In the Kidcoat I had switching, In the Tap-house, Cook-shop, Kitching, This way, that way, each way shrunk I, Little eat I, deeply drunk I. In my progresse travelling Northward, Taking my farewell oth' Southward, To Banbery came I, O prophane one! Where I saw a Puritane-one, Hanging of his Cat on Monday, For killing of a Mouse on Sonday. To Oxford came I, whose Copesmato Is Minerva, Well of Plato; From which Seat doe streame most seemlie Aganippe, Hippocrene; Each thing ther's the Muses Minion, Queenes College-Horn speakes pure Athenian. Thence to Godsto, with my Lovers, Where a Tombe a Strumpet covers; Rosamund lies there interred, Flesh to dust and shade's compared, Lye he 'bove, or lye she under, To be buried is no wonder. Hence to Woodstock I resorted, There a Labyrinth's reported, But of that no 'count I tender, I found an Hostesse quicke and slender: And her Guests more sweetly eying, Than a thousand Rosamunds dying. From thence to Brackley, as did beseeme one, The May'r I saw, a wondrous meane one, Sitting, thatching and bestowing On a Wind-blowne house a strowing, On me, cald he, and did charme mee, “Drinke lesse, eat more, I doe warne thee. Thence to Daintree with my Jewell, Famous for a Noble Duell, There I drunk and cook my Common In a Tophouse with my Woman; While I had it, there I paid it, Till long chalking broke my credit. Thence I came to th' Beli at Leister, Where my braines did need a plaister; First night that I was admitted, By the Watchmen I was whipped, Black and blew like any tetter Beat I was to make me better. Thence to Gottam, where sure am I, Though not all fooles I saw many; Here a She-gull found I prancing, And in Moon-shine nimbly dancing, There another wanton madling Who her Hog was set a sadling. Thence to Brave Mortimer's now dead, his glory dust, His Courts are clad with grasse, his Hall with rust. His staires steepe steps, his Horse-troughs cisterns are, Wormes his embraces, kisses ashes share. But gone, e're to returne, is held unfit. And they are dead, and you must follow them. Nottingam, where rovers, High-way riders, Sherwood drovers, Like old Robin-Hood, and Scarlet, Or like Little John his varlet; Here and there they shew them doughty, Cells and Woods to get their booty. Thence to Mansfield, where I knew one, That was comely and a trew one, With her a nak'd compact made I, Her long lov'd I, with her laid I, Towne and her I left, being doubtfull Lest my love had made her fruitfull. Thence to In Janus time was Danus seated here, As by their pales and trenches may appeare. Overhowles, where Danus Dwelt with's Danes in time of Janus; Way to th' Towne is well disposed, All about with trenches closed, Pallisado's hid with bushes, Rampires overgrowne with rushes. On a Feast day came I thether, When good people flockt together, Where induc'd by their exemple, I repair'd unto the Temple; Where I heard the Preacher gravely With his Nose pot-tipt most bravely. Dormise-like the people seemed, Though he cride, they sleeping dreamed; For his life, tho there was harme in't, Heart was lesse rent than his garment; With his feet he did so thunder As the To sacrifice to th' ashes of their Feast.Lucret. pulpit fell asunder. Which occasion having gotten, All t awake Pray you, good Townsmen, sacred Springs affect, Let not your Preacher read, and you neglect., the pulpit broken; While the Preacher lay sore wounded, With more boords than beards surrounded, All to dinner, who might faster, And among them I left Pastor. Thence to Clowne came I the quicker, Where I'de given my skin for liquer, None was there to entertaine us But a Nogging of Vulcanus, Who afford't me welcome plenty, Till my seame-rent purse grew empty. Thence to th' Bull at Rothram came I, Where my gold, If I had any, Left I, long I stoutly rored Till oth' Bridge I broke my forehead, Whence ashamed while brows smarted, I by Night-time thence departed. Thence to Doncaster, who'l beleeve it! Both a Light-one and a Levite There I viewed; too too aged, Yet to love so farre engaged, As on Earth she only wished To be painted, pricked, kissed. Thence to At such time as we sojourn'd in this poor Village, it chanced that a certaine Pinner, and one of the choicest of all his Flocke, being choaked with pin-dust, dyed: To whose Memory wee find this Epitaph indorsed. ? ò cruell Death To rob this man of breath, Who whil'st he liv'd in scraping of a pin. Made better dust, than thou hast made of him. Aberford, whose beginning Came from buying drink with pinning; Poor they are and very needy, Yet of liquor too too greedy; Have they never so much plenty, Belly makes their purses empty. Thence to Wetherbe, where an apt one To be Tweake unto a Captaine I embraced, as I gat it, Door creek'd, Captain tooke me at it, Took me and by th' Eares he drew me, And headlong down staires he threw me. Neare Horne-Alley in a Garden A wench more wanton than Kate Arden Sojourns, one that scorns a Wast-coat, Wooing Clients with her basket. Turning thence, none could me hinder To salute the Wakefield Pinder; Who indeed's the worlds glory, With his Cumrades never sory. This the cause was, lest you misse it, Georgies Club I meant to visit. Streight at Wakefeeld was I seene a, Where I sought for George a Greene a, But I could find no such creature, On a Signe I saw his feature: Where the strength of ale so stirr'd me, I grew stouter farre than Geordie. Thence to Bradford, my tongue blisters At the Family of Sisters, They love, are lov'd to no Eye-show, They increase and multiply too, Furnish'd with their spritely weapons She-flesh feeles Clarks are no Capons. Thence to Kighley, where are mountaines Steepy-threatning, lively fountaines, Rising Hils, and barraine valleis, Yet Bon-Socio's and good fellowes, Joviall-jocund-jolly Bowlers, As they were the world Controulers. Thence to Giggleswick most sterill, Hemm'd with rocks and shelves of perill; Neare to th' way as Traveller goeth, A fresh A fresh Spring Ebs and Flowes all houres oth' day. Spring both Ebbes and Floweth, Neither know the Learnd'st that travell What procures it, Salt or Gravell. Thence to Clapham, drawing nyer He that was the common Cryer, To a breakefast of one Herring Did invite me first appearing. Herring he, I drinke bestowed, Pledges of the love we owed. Thence to Ingleton, where I dwelled Till I brake a Blacksmiths palled, Which done, women rush'd in on me, Stones like haile showr'd down upon me, Whence amated, fearing harming, Leave I tooke, but gave no warning. The poore mans box is in the Temple set, Temple on Hill, th' Hill is by waters bet. Thence to Lonesdale, where I viewed An Hall which like a Taverne shewed; Neate Gates, white Walls, nought was sparing, Pots brim-full, no thought of caring: They eat, drink, laugh, are still mirth-making, Nought they see that's worth care taking. Thence to Cowbrow, truth I'le tell ye, Mine hostesse had a supple bellie, Bodie plumpe, and count'nance cheerfull, Reeling pace (a welcome fearfull) Like a drunken Hag she stumbled, Till she on her buttocks tumbled. Thence to Natland, being come thither, He who Yorks Contempts did gather Gave me harbour, light as fether We both drunke and eat together, Till halfe-typsy, as it chanced, We about the Maypole danced. Thence to Kirkland, thence to Kendall, I did that which men call Spendall, Night and day with Sociats many Drunk I ale both thick and clammy. “Shroud thy head, Boy, stretch thy hand too, “Hand h'as done, head cannot stand to. Leaving these, to Staveley came I, Where now all night drinking am I, Alwayes frolick, free from yellows, With a Consort of good fellows, Where I'le stay and end my journay, Till Brave Barnabe returne-a. FINIS. Upon Bacchus Bush and Barnabees Nose, an Epigram, or Nose twitching Dilemme. Good Wine no Bush it needs, as I suppose, Let Bacchus bush bee Barnabees rich Nose. No Bush, no Garland needs of Cipresse greene, Barnabees Nose may for a Bush be seene. Corollarie. No bush, no garland; pot's thy Bush &amp; Beare, Of Beare &amp; Bush thou smellest all the yeere. The second part. Ore-flowing Cups whom have they not made learn'd? Mirtil. Faustulus! happily returned; Tell me, pray thee, where th'st journed; What Townes, villages th'ast viewed, What Seats, Sites or States were shewed; Sure thou know'st the North's uncivill, Small good comes thence, but much evill. Faustul. What I was once, same I am now, Haire, conditions, garments same too, Yea there's no man justly doubteth, These the same shooes I went out with; And for combe I ne're us'd any, Lest I lost some of my Meney. But attend me, and partake it, What I loved, what I hated, Of hills, wells, bridges, Churches, women, wooll. Bridges, fountaines, mountaines, valleis, Cauls, cells, hillocks, high-wayes, shallows, Paths, towns, villages and trenches, Chast-choice-chary-merry wenches. Truth I'le tell thee, nothing surer, Richer am I not, nor poorer, Gladder, madder nor more pleasing, Blither, brisker, more in season, Better, worser, thinner, thicker, Neither healthfuller nor sicker. For the world I so farre prize it, But for Liquor I'd despise it, Thousand deaths I'd rather dye too Than hold Ale mine Enemy too: “Sober, Lamb-like doe I wander, “Drunk, I'm stout as Alexander. When my head feeles his Mæander, I am stronger than Lysander; Th' Ile of Ree I little feare it Without wound to winne and weare it; But lest tedious I expresse me, To my Progresse I'le addresse me. First place where I first was knowne-a, Was brave John a Gants And so must strongest Piles give way to time. old Towne-a, A Seat antiently renowned, But with store of Beggars drowned: For a Jaylor ripe and mellow, The world h'as not such a fellow. Thence to Ashton, good as may be Was the wine, brave Knight, bright Ladie, All I saw was comely specious, Seemly gratious, neatly precious; My Muse with Bacchus so long traded, When I walk't, my legs denaid it. Thence to Garestang, pray you harke it, Ent'ring there a great Beast-market, As I jogged on the street-a 'Twas my fortune for to meet-a A young Heyfer, who before her Tooke me up and threw me o're her. Thence to Preston, I was led-a, To brave Banisters to bed-a, As two borne and bred together We were presently sworne brether; Seven dayes were me there assigned, Oft I supt, but never dined. Thence to Euxston, where mine Hostesse Feeles as soft as any tost is, Jucy, lusty, count'nance toothsome, Braided haire, but breath most loathsome; Her I left with locks of amber, Phyllis light me to my chamber. Thence to Wiggin about Supper, To an Hostesse, none more slutter, Buxome was she yet to see to, She'd be drunk for companie too; Wit this Beldam soon did scater, And in Bed distill'd her water. Thence to Newton in the Willows, Where being boulstred up with pillows, I at Cards plaid with a girle Fresh was my Rose, till by a Northwind tost, She sap, sent, verdure, and her vigour lost. Rose by name, a dainty pearle, At Cent-foot I often moved Her to love me whom I loved. Thence to Warrington, banks or'eflowed, Travellers to th' Towne were rowed, Where supposing it much better To be drown'd on Land than Water, Sweetly, neatly I sojourned Till that deluge thence returned. Thence to Cock at Budworth, where I Drunk strong ale as browne as berry, Till at last with deep-healths felled, To my bed I was compelled; I for state was bravely sorted, By two Poulterers supported. Where no sooner understand I Of mine honest Hoast Tom. Gandi, To Holme Chappell forthwith set I, Maid and Hostesse both were prety, But to drinke tooke I affection, I forgot soone their complexion. Thence to Tauke-a-Hill resort I, An hill steepy, slippery, durty; Smith with me being well acquainted Drunk with me till's wits were tainted, Having left me, Uenus swore it, She'd shooe-horn her Uulcans forehead. At New-Castle under line-a, There I trounc'd it in burn't wine-a; None oth' Wicked there remained, Weekly Lectures were proclaimed: Chastity they roughly handle, While blind zeale snuffs out the candle. Thence to th' Bell at Stone streight draw I, ô my honey-suckle Delia! Delia no Diana saw I; By the Parson I was cited Who held me for Jesuited; In his search, the door fast locked, Nought but Cards were in my pocket. Thence to Haywood taking flight-a, The Hostesse gave me brawne at night-a; But what's that unto the matter? Whiskins sorted with my nature: To brave Bacchus no gift quicker Than oblations of strong liquor. Thence to Ridgelay, where a Black-smith, Liquor being all hee'd take with, Boused with me; mid-night waking And a looking-glasse there taking, Chamber-pot was hol'd quite thorow, Which made me lye wet till morrow. Thence to Bruarton, old Claudus Did approve us and applaud us, Where I heard a wofull bleating, A curst wife her husband beating; Neighbour rode for this default-a, While I dyde my front with malt-a. Thence to The fruitfull vale up to thy Temple lookes. Lichfield went I right on, Where I chanced to invite one, A Curmudgeon rich but nasty To a supper of a pasty. Having sipt, and supt, and ended, What I spent, the Miser lended. Thence to Colesill, to a Shamble Like an old Fox did I amble, To a cellar, troth I'le tell ye, Fusty, musty, headlong fell I; But the Butcher having made-a Th' fire his bed, no more I staid-a. Thence at Meredin appeare I, Where growne surfoot and sore weary, I repos'd, where I chuckt Jone-a, Felt her pulse, would further gone-a; There we drunk, and no guest crost us, Till I tooke the Hoast for th' Hostesse. Thence to Coventre, where 'tis said-a Coventre blew is only made-a; This I know not, for sure am I In no Market bought I any; Bacchus made me such a Scholer, Black nor blew, I knew no colour. Thence to Dunchurch, where report is Of pimps, punks a great resort is, But to me none such appeared, Bung nor Bung-hole I ne're feared; Though the rich Chrone have feares plenty, Safe he sings whose purse is empty. At Daintre earely might you find me, But not th' Wench I left behind me, Neare the Schoole-house where I boused, Her I sought but she was spoused, Which I having heard that night-a, “Farewell (quoth I) Proselyta. Thence to Wedon, there I tarried In a Waggon to be carried; Carriers there are to be found-a, Who will drink till th' world run round-a: “Pay, good fellows, I'le pay nought heere, “I have To give them that it could not hold. left more than I brought heere. Thence to Tosseter on a Tuesday, Where an artfull Batchler chus'd I To consort with; we ne're budged, But to Bacchus revels trudged; All the Night-long sat we at it Till we both grew heavy pated. Thence to Stratford where Frank Green is my name from him whom I obey, But tho my name be Green, my head is gray. Green-a, Daintiest Doe that e're was seene-a, Venus varnish me saluted, But no beauty long can sute it; Beauty feedeth, beauty fadeth, Beauty lost, her wooer vadeth. Holding on my journey longer, Streight at Brickhill with Tom. Younger. I arriv'd; one by this cheese-a Styl'd the eighth wiseman of Greece-a, Voyce more sweet than Prognes sister, Like a Torch his nose doth glister. To Hocklayhole as I approached, Scylla's barmy cell I broached, Darke as th' Cave of Pluto's station, Or Laverna's habitation, Quaffing there while I could stand-o, Madder grew I than Orlando. Thence to Dunstable, all about me; Mice within, and Thieves without me; But no feare affrights deep drinkers, There I tost it with my Skinkers; Not a drop of wit remained Which the Bottle had not drained. Thence to Redburne, where were Players, None of Roscius actiue heyres; Prologue crown'd with a Wreath of Iuy, Jetted like an Ape most lively: I told them sitting at the Actor. Even as in a ban a-quet are dish-es Of Sun-dry ta-ast. Author. Even so is thy doo-blet too long ith wa-ast; Goe mend it thou knave, goe mend it. banket They should be canvas'd in a blanket. From thence with a stomack empty To the towne of Here Alban was; his Tombe, his Title too; “All Albion shew me such an Alban now. Albane went I, Where with wine I was so undon, As the Hand which guides to London In my blind hand I receaved, And her more acquaintance craved. Thence to th' Purse at Barnet known-a, There the Beares were come to Town-a; Two rude Hunks, 'tis troth I tell ye, Drawing neare them, they did smell me, And like two mis-shapen wretches Made me, ay me, wrong my bretches. Thence to Highgate, where I viewed Seven Hils there were in Rome, and so there be Seven Sights in New-Troy crave our memorie: 1 Tombes, 2 Guild-HallGiants, 3 Stage-plaies, 4 Bedlam poore, 5 Ostrich, 6 Beare-garden, 7 Lyons in the Towre.City I so dearely loved, And th' Horne of Matriculation Drunk to th' freshmen of our Nation, To his memory saluted Whose branch'd head was last cornuted. Thence to Hollowell, Mother red cap, In a troupe of Trulls I did hap; Whoors of Babylon me impalled, And me their Adonis called; With me toy'd they, buss'd me, cull'd me, But being needy, out they pull'd me. Thence to Islington at Lion, Where a juggling I did spy one, Nimble with his Mates consorting, Mixing cheating with his sporting; Creeping into th' Case of's viall Spoil'd his juggling, made them fly all. Country left; I in a fury To the Axe in Alder-Bury First arrived, that place slighted I at Rose in Holborne lighted, From the Rose in flaggons sayle I To the Griphin ith' Old-Bayly. Where no sooner doe I waken, Than to Three Cranes am I taken, Where I lodge and am no starter Till I see the Summer quarter; Pert is Faustulus and pleasing, Cup brimfull, and corpse in season. Yea, my merry mates and I too Oft to th' Cardinals Hat fly to, Where to Harts Horns we carouse it, As Minerva doth infuse it, But Actæon sick oth' yellows Mewes his wife up from good fellows. Under th' Signe of Pipe still fuming, And the Bush for ever flaming, Mulciber the motion moving, With Nose-burning Master shaming: A Shop neighbouring neare Iacco, Where Young vends his old Tobacco, As you like it, sometimes sealed, Which Impression since repealed, As you make it, he will have it, And in Chart and Front engrave it: Harmelesse but no artlesse end Cloze I here unto my Friend. FINIS. Upon the Errata's. Be'wixt Hawke and Buzzard, ô man, After th' Phraze of speech so c?mon, Having seene this Journall at print, I found these Erata's in it; Which if thou correct (Kind Reader) Nectar by thy Muses feeder. From the head unto the foot Nought but Error, looke unto't. This observation have I found most true, Erring, I learne mine Errors to subdue. Now Venus pure Veines are with Wines inflamed, Now Venus full Veines are by wines restrained, For Venus swolne Veines are by Morphuus chained, From folly wained. The Third part. Full-blowne my veines are, &amp; so well they may, With brimming healths of wine drunk yesterday. Mirtil. Whup (Faustulus) all draw ny thee That doe love thee, or lov'd by thee, Joying in thy safe returning! Leave Court, care, &amp; fruitlesse mourning; Way th' ast walked, pray thee shew it, Where th' ast lived, what th' ast viewed. Not th' Ephesian Diana Is of more renoumed fam-a; Acting wonders all invent thee, Painters in their Statues paint thee; Banish feare, remove delay-man, Shew thy selfe a famous Way-man. Faustul. Leave delay, and be not fearfull! Why; who e're saw me lesse cheerfull When I was by Fortune cuffed, Or by Fortunes smiles so puffed, As I shewd my selfe farre prouder Than when she more scornfull shewd her? For the world, I would not prize her, Yea, in time I should despise her, Had she in her no good fellow That would drinke till he grew mellow; Draw neare and heare, thou shalt have all, Hearing, joy in this my travall. First day having drunk with many, To Islington from London came I, Journey long and grievous wether, Yet the Ev'ning brought me thether, Having t'ane my pots by th' fier, Summer sand was never dryer. Thence to Kingsland, where were feeding Cattell, Sheepe, and Mares for breeding; As I found it, there I feared That my Rozinant was wear'ed: When he would jog on no faster Loose I turn'd him to the pasture. Thence to Totnam-high-crosse turning I departed 'fore next morning; Hostesse on her Guests so doted Faustulus was little noted; To an Hay-loft I was led in, Boords my bed, and straw my bedding. Having thus left High-Crosse early, I to Waltham travelled fairly, To the Hospitall of Oswald, And that Princely Seat of Of the Kings House at Tibbals. This seat, this royall object of the sight, Shall it for ever bid the World, good night? Where our preceding Kings enjoy'd such blisse, And seal'd their amorous fancies with a kisse! Th' bald; There all night I drunk old Sack-a With my bed upon my back-a. Thence to Hodsdon, where stood watching Cheats who liv'd by conicatching, False Cards brought me, with them plaid I, Deare for their acquaintance paid I; 'Fore a Justice they appeared; Them he praised, me he jeered. Thence to Ware, where mazie Amwell Mildly cuts the Southerne Chanell; Rivers streaming, banks resounding, Middleton with wealth abounding: Mightily did these delight me; “O I wish'd them Aqua vitæ! Thence to Wademill, where I rest me For a pot, for I was thirstie; On me cryde they and did hout me, And like Beetles flockt about me: “Buy a Whip S?! no, a Laddle; “Where's your Horse S?? where your Saddle? Thence at Puckridge I reposed, Hundred Beggars me inclosed; “Beggars, quoth I, you are many, “But the poorest of you am I; They no more did me importune Leaving me unto my fortune. Thence to Bunting ford right trusty, Bedrid Host, but Hostesse lusty, That can chat and chirp it neatly, And in secret kisse you sweetly; Here are Arbours decked gaily, Where the Buntin warbles daily. Thence to Roiston, there grasse groweth, Medes, flocks, fields the plowman soweth, Where a pious Prince frequented, Which observing, this I vented: “Since all flesh to Are sports for Kings, yet Kings with these must dye. Fate's a debter, “Retchlesse wretch, why liv'st no better? Thence to Caxston, I was led in To a poor house, poorer bedding, Some there were had me suspected That with plague I was infected, So as I starke-naked drew me, Calling th' Hostesse streight to view me. Thence to Cambridge, where the Muses Haunt the Vine-bush, as their use is; Like sparks up a Chimney warming, Or Flyes neare a Dung-hill swarming, In a Ring they did inclose me, Vowing they would never lose me. 'Bout mid-night for drinke I call S?, As I had drunk nought at all S?, But all this did little shame me, Tipsy went I, tipsy came I: Grounds, greenes, groves are wet and homely, But the Schollers wondrous comely. Thence to Findes Birds their Nests, tels Passengers their way. Godmanchester, by one, With a Clowd as was Ixion, Was I gull'd; she had no fellow, Her soft lips were moist &amp; mellow, All night vow'd she to lye by me, But the giglet came not ny me. Thence to Huntington, in a cellar With a wench was there a dweller I did bargaine, but suspected By the Hoast who her affected, Down the staires he hurr'ed quickly, While I made me too too sickly. Thence to Harrington, be it spoken! For Name-sake I gave a token To a Beggar that did crave it And as cheerfully receive it: More he need't not me importune For 'twas th' utmost of my fortune. Thence to Stonegatehole, I'l tell here Of a story that befell there, One who served an Atturney T'ane with beauty in his journey, Seeing a Coppice hastens thither Purposely to wanton with her. As these privatly conferred, A Rover tooke him unprepared, Search't his Port-mantua, bound him faster, And sent him naked to his Master: Set on's Saddle with hands tyed, Th' Horse he neyed, Man he cryed. Th' Atturney when he had discerned One, he thought, behind him armed In white Armour, stoutly sturr'd him, For his Jade hee keenly spurr'd him: Both run one course to catch a Gudgeon, This Nak't, that frighted to their lodging. Singing along down Here of the whip a Covetous Priest did lick; Who would not bury th' dead, was buried quick. Nothing more memorable than that Chappell of Sautry, reteining still with her that Covetous Priests memory. Sautry laning, I saw a Tombe one had beene laine in, And inquiring, One did tell it, 'Twas where Rainsford buried th' Prelat: I saw, I smil'd, and could permit it, Greedy Priests might so be fitted. To th' Newfounded College came I, Commended to the care of many; Bounteous are they, kind and loving, Doing whatsoe're's behoving: These hold and walke together wholly, And state their Lands on uses holy. Whether pure these are or are not, As I know not, so I care not; But if they be dissembling Brothers, Their life surpasseth many others: See but their Cell, Schoole and their Temple, You'l say the Stars were their exemple. Thence to Stilton, slowly paced, With no bloome nor blossome graced, With no plums nor apples stored, But bald like an old mans forehead; Yet with Innes so well provided, Guests are pleas'd when they have tride it. Thence to Wansforth-brigs, a river, And a wife will live for ever; River broad, an old wife jolly, Comely, seemely, free from folly; Gates and gardens neatly gracious, Ports and Parks and pastures spatious. Seeing there, as did become me, Written, Lord Have Mercy On Me, On the Portels, I departed, Lest I should have sorer smarted; Though from death none may be spared, I to dye was scarce prepared. On a Hay-cock sleeping soundly, Th' River rose and tooke me roundly Downe the current; people cryed, Sleeping, down the streame I hyed; Where away, quoth they, from Greenland? No; from Wansforth-brigs in England. Thence to This house the Levarets bush. Burleigh, though 'twas winter, No fire did the Chimney enter, Buttries without Butlers guarded, Stately gates were dooble-warded; Hoary Ivy the Chimneis trophy. Chimneyes without smooke too, Hungry Kitchins without Cooke too. Hallowing loud, ô empty wonder! Ecco's the keeper of a forlorne house. Ecco streight resounded, hunger. Who inhabits this vast brick-house? Ecco made reply, the Titmouse; Ominous Cell, no drudge at home Sir! Ecco answer made, Be gone Sir. Thence to ancient Where be thy Masters? Fellows? Scholers? Bursers? O Stamford to thy shame, they'r all turn'd Pursers. Stamford came I, Where are pencelesse purses many, Neatly wrought as doth become them, Lesse gold in them than is on them: Clawbacks more doe not assaile me, Than are Beggars swarming dayly. Though my cares were maine and many, To the The Drunkards cave, for so it may be call'd, Where many Malt-worms have beene soundly mall'd. Hole of Sara came I, Once a bona-roba, trust me, Though now buttock-shrunke and rustie; But though nervy-oyle and fat-a, Her I caught by you know what-a. Having boldly thus adventur'd, And my Sara's socket enter'd, Her I sued, suted, sorted, Bussed, bouzed, sneesed, snorted: Often sat she, when she got up All her phraze was, “Drink thy pot up. Thence to Witham, having red there That the fattest Eele was bred there, Purposing some to intangle, Forth I went and tooke mine angle, Where an huge one having hooked, By her headlong was I dooked. Mæanders shores to Lethe's shadows tend; Where waves sound cares, and banks imply our end. Thence to I may compare this Towne, and be no lyer, With any shire for Whetstones and a Spire. Grantham I retiring, Famous for a Spire aspiring, There a Pastor with his sweeting In a chamber closely meeting; In great fury out he flung there 'Cause a Popish picture hung there. Here the Townsmen are amated That their Spire should be translated Unto Pauls; and great's their labour How to purchase so much paper To enwrap it, as is fitting, To secure their Spire from splitting. Thence to Which cloths those Turrets with her shaken leaves. Here all along lyes Bevars spatious Vale, Neare which the streames of fruitfull Trent doe fall. Vallies three so fruitfull be, They'r the wealth of Britannie. New-worke, flood-surrounded, Where I hoping most were drowned, Hand to hand I straightwayes shored To a Cellar richly stored, Till suspected for a picklock, Th' Beedle led me to the whip-stock. Thence to Tuxworth in the clay there, Where poor Travellers find such way there; Wayes like bird-lime seeme to show them, Seats are Syrts to such as know them; Th' Ivy hangs there, long has't hong there, Wine it never vended strong there. Thence to Retford, fish I fed on, And to th' adage I had red on, With carouses I did trimme me, That my fish might swim within me, As they had done being living, And ith' River nimbly diving. Thence to Scrubie, ô my Maker! With a Pastor and a Taker Day I spent, I night divided, Thiefe did make me well provided: My poor Scrip did cause me feare him, All night long I came not neare him. Thence to Bautree, as I came there From the bushes neare the Lane there Rush'd a Tweake in gesture flanting, With a leering eye and wanton; But my flesh I did subdue it, Fearing lest my purse should rue it. Thence to That curt'sie might a curtesie enforce, The Mayre would bring the Lawyer to his horse: You shall not, quoth the Lawyer; M. now I sweare, I'le to the gallows goe. L. I'le leave you there, Might not this Mayre for wit a second Pale-As Have nam'd the Town-end full as well as Gallows? Doncaster, where reported Lively Levit was departed, Love I loath'd and spritely wine too, Which I dearely lov'd sometime too: For when youthfull Venus ageth, He my fleshly force asswageth. Thirst knowes neither meane nor measure, Robin Hoods Well was my treasure, In a common A well, thorne, dish hung in an iron chaine, For monuments of Robin Hood remaine. dish enchained, I my furious thirst restrained: And because I drunk the deeper, I paid two farthings to the keeper. Thence to Where no creature dwels but Sloth. Wentbrig, where vile wretches, Hideous hags and odious witches, Writhen count'nance and mis-shapen Are by some foule Bugbeare taken: These infernall seats inherit, Who contract with such a Spirit. Thence to Ferrybrig, sore wearied, Surfoot, but in spirit cheered; I the grape no sooner tasted Than my melancholy wasted: Never was wild Boare more fellish, Though the wine did smally relish. Thence to The Tragick stage of English Kings stood here, Which to their urns payes tribute with a teare. Pomfrait, as long since is, Fatall to our Which for revenge mounts up with aery wings. English Princes; For the choicest Here Licorice grows upon their mellowed banks, Decking the Spring with her delicious plants. Licorice crowned, And for sundry acts renowned: A Louse in Pomfrait is not surer, Then the Poor through sloth securer. Thence to Sherburne, dearely loved, And for Pinners well approved; Cherry tenths the Pastor aymeth More than th' soules which he reclaimeth: In an Equi-page consorting Are their manners and their fortune. Thence to Bramham, thither comming, I saw two Footmen stript for running; One told me, “th' match was made to cheat th?, “Trust me Faustulus, This will beat 'em, “For we've tride them: but that Courser He priz'd better, prov'd the worser. Thence to Tadcaster, where stood reared A faire Bridge, where no flood appeared, Broken Pavements, Beggars waiting, Nothing more than labour hating, But with speed I hastned from them, Lest I should be held one of them. Thence to Yorke, fresh youth enjoying With a wanton Weaver toying, Husband suddenly appeares too “Catching of the Wolfe by th' Eares too; He cryes open, something feares him, But th' deafe Adder never heares him. Thus my entrance was descried, While the Weaver was denied, Who as he fumed, fret, and frowned With a chamber-pot was crowned; Wisely silent he ne're grudged While his Betty with me lodged. A Piper being here committed, Guilty found, condemn'd and titted, As he was to Knavesmyre going, This day, quoth Boyes, will spoile thy blowing; From thy Pipe th' art now departing; Pags, quoth th' Piper, you'r not certaine. All which happen'd to our wonder, For the halter cut asunder, As one of all life deprived Being buried, he revived: And there lives, and plays his measure, Holding hanging but a pleasure. Thence to Towlerton, where those Stagers Or Horse-coursers run for wagers; Neare to the high way the course is, Where they ride and run their horses; But still on our journey went we, First, or Last, did like content me. Thence to Helperby I turned Desolate and lately burned, Not a Taphouse there but mourned, Being all to ashes turned, Whence I swiftly did remove me For thirst-sake, as did behove me. Thence to Topcliffe from tops of cliffs first tooke her name, And her cliffe-mounted seat confirms the same: Where streames with curled windings overflowne Bestow a native beauty on the towne. Topcliffe, musick call'd I, In no comely posture fail'd I, But when these expected wages, To themselves I left my Pages; Small being th' curt'sy I could shew them Th' reckning I commended to them. Thence to Here Thyrsis fed his Lambkins on the Plaine, So Thyrske from Thyrsis tooke her ancient Name. Here Tityrus and Phyllis made them Bowers Of tender Osyers, sweet-breath'd Sycomours. Thyrske, rich Thyrsis casket, Where faire Phyllis fils her basket With choice flowers, but these be vaine things, I esteeme no flowers nor Swainlings; In Bacchus yard, field, booth or cottage I love nought like his cold pottage. Thence to Alerton, rankt in battell, Sheepe, Kine, Oxen, other Cattell, As I fortun'd to passe by there Were the Towns best beautifier: Faire for Beasts at that time fell there, But I made my Fayre the Celler. Thence to Smeton, I assailed Lowsy Hill, for so they call it, Where were dainty Ducks, and gant ones, Wenches that could play the wantons, Which they practise, truth I'le tell ye, For reliefe of back and bellie. Thence to Their Lamprels shells, their rocks soft mossy stems. Nesham, now translated, Once a Nunnery dedicated; Wallies smiling, Bottoms pleasing, Streaming Rivers never ceasing, Deckt with tufty woods and shady, Graced by a lovely Lady. Thence to Darlington, there I boused Till at last I was espoused; Marriage feast and all prepared, Not a fig for th' world I cared; All night long by th' pot I tarried As if I had ne're beene married. Thence to From a Rich mound thy appellation came, And thy rich seat proves it a proper name. Richmund, heavy sentence! There were none of my acquaintance, All my noble Cumrads gone were, Of them all I found not one there, But lest care should make me sicker, I did bury care in liquor. Penance chac'd that crime of mine hard, Thence to Redmeere to a Swine-heard Came I, where they nothing plast me But a Swines-gut that was nastie, Had I not then wash'd my liver, In my guts't had stuck for ever. Thence to Carperbie very greedy, Consorts frequent, victuals needy, After Supper they so tost me As seven shillings there it cost me: Soone may one of coyne be soaked, Yet for want of liquor choaked. Thence to Wenchly, Valley-seated, For antiquity repeated; Sheep and Sheepheard as one brother Kindly drink to one another; Till pot-hardy light as feather Sheep and Shepheard sleep together. Thence to Middlam, where I viewed Th' Castle which so stately shewed; Down the staires, 'tis truth I tell ye, To a knot of brave Boyes fell I; All red-noses, no dye deeper, Yet not one but a peace-keeper. Thence to Closed above with thorns, below with water. Ayscarth, from a mountaine Fruitfull vallies, pleasant fountaine, Woolly flocks, cliffs steep and snowy, Fields, fenns, sedgy rushes saw I; Which high Mount is call'd the Temple, For all prospects an exemple. Thence to Worton, being lighted I was solemnly invited By a Captains wife most vewlie, Though, I thinke, she never knew me; I came, call'd, coll'd, toy'd, trifl'd, kissed, “Captaine Cornu-cap'd I wished. Thence to Bainbrig, where the River From his channell seemes to sever, To Maidenly John I forthwith hasted, And his best provision tasted; Th' hoast I had (a thing not common) Seemed neither man nor woman. Thence to Washing the wals oth' village neighbouring. Askrig, market noted, But no handsomnesse about it, Neither Magistrate nor Mayor Ever were elected there: Here poor people live by knitting, To their Trading, breeding fitting. Thence to With murm'ring voyce &amp; pace procure sweet sleep. Hardraw, where's hard hunger, Barraine cliffs and clints of wonder; Never here Adonis lived, Unlesse in Coles Harbour hived: Ins are nasty, dusty, fustie, Both with smoake and rubbish mustie. Thence to Gastile, I was drawne in To an Alehouse neare adjoining To a Chappell, I drunk Stingo With a Butcher and Domingo Th' But want of Latin made him answer—Mum. Curat, who to my discerning Was not guilty of much learning. Thence to Here grows a bush in artfull mazes round, Where th' active organs of my braine were drownd. Sedbergh, sometimes joy-all, Gamesome, gladsome, richly royall, But those jolly boyes are sunken, “Now scarce once a yeare one drunken: There I durst not well be merry, Farre from home old Foxes werry. Thence to Here the retyred Tanner builds him bowrs, Shrowds him from Summers heat and winters showrs. Killington I passed, Where an hill is freely grassed, There I staid not though halfe-tyred, Higher still my thoughts aspired: Taking leave of Mountains many, To my native Country came I. Thence to Kendall, pure her state is, Prudent too her Magistrate is, In whose charter to them granted Nothing but a Now Saturns yeare h'as drench'd down care, And made an Alderman a Mayre. Mayor wanted; Here it likes me to bee dwelling, Pousing, loving, stories telling. FINIS. The fourth part. If thou doest love thy flock, leave off to pot. Mirtil. O Faustulus, takes't no pitty For the Field to leave the City? Nor thy Consorts, lively Skinkers, Witty wags, and lusty Drinkers, Lads of life, who wash their liver And are dry and thirsty ever? Wilt thou here no longer tarrie With these Boyes that love Canarie? Wilt thou leave these nectar trenches, Dainty Doxes, merry wenches? Say, what makes thee change thy ditty, Thus to take farewell oth' City? Faustul. What is't makes me? doest not note it How I have ith' Taverne floted, Till a thousand seeke to shame me, There goes Faustulus, so they name me, Who through all the World traced, And with Stile of Maltworme graced! Who carouseth to his breeding From Aurora's beamelins spreding To the Ev'ning, and despiseth Favour, thrift which each man prizeth! Now heare Faustulus melancholly, Th' clozing Scene of all his folly. Farewell Banbery, farewell Brackley, Farewell Hollow-well, farewell Hockley, Farewell Daintre, farewell Leister, Farewell Chichester, farewell Chester, Farewell Nottingam, farewell Mansfield, Farewell Wetherbe, farewell Tanfield. Farewell Aberford, farewell Bradford, Farewell Tosseter, farewell Stratford, Farewell Preston, farewell Euxston, Farewell Wiggin, farewell Newton, Farewell Warrington, farewell Budworth, Farewell Kighley, farewell Cudworth. Farewell Hogsdon, farewell Totnam, Farewell Giggleswick, farewell Gottam, Farewell Harrington, farewell Stilton, Farewell Huntington, farewell Milton, Farewell Roiston, farewell Puckridge, Farewell Caxston, farewell Cambridge. Farewell Ware, farewell Wademill, Farewell Highgate, farewell Gadshill, Farewell Stamford, farewell Sautree, Farewell Scrubie, farewell Bautree, Farewell Castle under Line too, Where are Poets, Wenches, Wine too. Farewell Tauk-hill, which I viewed, Lemnian Lydia, whom I sewed, Steepy wayes by which I waded, And those Trugs with which I traded, Faber, Taber, pensive never, Farewell merry Mates for ever. Now I hate all forraine places, Robin Hoods Well and his chaces, Farewell Rosington, farewell Retford, And thou ancient seat of Bedford, Farewell Dunchurch, Dunstable, Brickhill, Alban, Barnet, Pimlico, Tickhill. Farewell Waltham, Seat of Oswald, That bright Princely starre of The' bald, Farewell Godmanchester, where I Was deluded by a Fairy, Farewell Kingsland, Islington, —These be my New Troyes dying Elegies. Now to that New Troy bid adue for ever, Wine, Venus, Pictures, can allure me never, These are youths darlings, ages hoary griever, Fare ye well ever. Farewell for ever, see you will I never, Yet if Wife, Children, Meney hurry thether, Where we may plant and solace us together, Welcome for ever. London, Which I lov'd, and by it undon. Farewell Buntingford, where are Thrushes, Sweet Briers, Shred vines, privet bushes, Hostesse cheerefull, mildly moving, Giving tokens of her loving; I must in another Nation Take my fill of recreation. Farewell pretious Stone, and Chappell Where Stella shines more fresh than th' apple, Farewell Haywood, Bruarton, Ridglay, Lichfield, Coventre, Colesyl, Edglay, Meredin, Wakefield, farewell cleene-a Meedes and Mates of George a Greene-a. Farewell Clowne, Doncaster, Rothram, Clapham, Ingleton, Waldon, Clothram, Witham, Grantham, New-worke, Tuxworth, Uxbridge, Bekensfield, &amp; Oxford, Richly stor'd (I am no Gnatko) With wit, wealth, worth, Well of Plato. Farewell Yorke, I must forsake thee, Feavers shuttle shall not take mee, Hoary hayres are come upon me, Youthfull pranks will not become me; Th' bed to which I'm reconciled Shall be by me ne're defiled. Winter h'as now behoar'd my haires, Renumm'd my joynts and sinewes too, Phyllis for verses little cares, Leave City then, to th' Country go. Growne old, are scorn'd, though fancy crowne their quill.

I am now become a Drover, Countrey-liver, Countrey-lover, Smell of gaine my sense benummeth, Little care I whence it commeth, Be't from Campe, chore, cottage, carpet, Field, fold, cellar, forrest, market. Horse-Faires. To Malton come I, praising th' saile Sir, Of an horse without a taile Sir, Be he maim'd, lam'd, blind, diseased, If I sell him, I'm well pleased; Should this Javell dye next morrow, I partake not in his sorrow. Then to Rippon I appeare there To sell horse if they be deare there, If good cheape, I use to buy them, And ith' Country profit by them; “Where to quicken them, I'le tell ye, “I put quick Eeles in their bellie. Northerne Faires. Thence to Pomfrait, freshly flowred, And with In that rich Angelick I'le. rods of Licorice stored; Thence to Topcliffe with my fellow, Not to bouze Wine but to sell-lo; Thence to Thyrske, where Bullocks grazed, Are for sale ith' market placed. Thence to Allerton cheerefull, fruitfull, To the Seller very gratefull, There to chuse a place I'm chariest, Where my beasts may shew the fairest; Thence to Darlington, never swarving From our Drove-lawes, worth observing. Thence to Middlam am I aiming In a direct course of gaining, I refuse no kind of labour, Where I smell some gainfull savour; “No way, be it ne're the homeliest “Is rejected being honest. Tra-montane Faires. In these Faires if I finde nothing Worthy staying, I'm no slow thing, To the North frame I my passage Wing'd with hope of more advantage: Ragged rocks, and steepy hillows Are by gaine more soft than pillows. Thence to native Applebie mount I, Th' antient Seat of all that County; Thence to pearelesse Penrith went I, Which of Merchandize hath plenty; Thence to Roslay, where our Lot is To commerce with people Scottish. By a passage crooktly tending, Thence to Ravinglasse I'm bending; Thence to Dalton most delightfull; Thence to oaten Ouston fruitfull; Thence to Hauxides marish pasture; Thence to th' Seat of old Lancaster. Thence to Garestang, where are feeding Heards with large fronts freely breeding; Thence to Ingleforth I descended, Where choice Bull-calfs will be vended; Thence to Burtons boundiers passe I, Faire in flocks, in pastures grassie. Thence to Hornebie, Seat renouned, “Thus with gaine are worldlings drowned; Secret-sacred thirst of treasure Makes my Bullocks my best pleasure; Should Love wooe me, I'd not have her, “It is gaine yelds sweetest savour. Thence to Lonesdale, where were at it Boyes that scorn'd quart-ale by statute, Till they stagger'd, stammer'd, stumbled, Railed, reeled, rowled, tumbled, Musing I should be so stranged, I resolv'd them, I was changed. To the sinke of sin they drew me, There like Hogs in mire they tew me, Or like Dogs unto their vomit, But their purpose I o'recommed; With shut eyes I flung in anger from thoses Mates of death and danger. Mirtil. Surely (Faustulus) I doe wonder How thou who so long liv'd under Bacchus, where choice wits reso?ded, Should'st be thus ith' world drowned. What do'st, where liv'st, in briefe deliver, Wilt thou be a worldling ever? Faustul. Thou err'st (Mirtilus) so doe mo too, If thou think'st I never goe to Bacchus temple, which I follow, “Once a yeare laughs wise Apollo; Where I drench griefes, sleight Physitians, Hayre I change, but no conditions. Cheerefull Cumrades have I by me, Townsmen that doe neighbour ny me, Within, without, where e're I rest me, Carking cares doe ne're molest me: With these I please to consort me, And in To cheere my studies with a pleasing measure. open fields to sport me. Now to Richmund, when Spring's comming, Now to Nesham with my woman, With free course we both approve it, Where we live and are beloved; Here fields flower with freshest creatures Representing Flora's features. Now to Ashton I'm invited By my friend and kinsman cited, Secret cellars entertaine me, Beauteous-beaming Stars inflame me, Meat, mirth, musick, wines are there full, With a count'nance blith and cherefull. Now to Cowbrow, quickly thither Joviall boyes doe flock together, In which place all sorrow lost is, Guests know how to kisse their hostesse, Nought but love doth border neare it, Goose or Hen will witnesse beare it. Now to Natland, where choice beauty And a Shepheard doe salute me, Lips I relish richly roseack, Purely Nectar and Ambroseack; But I'm chaste, as doth become me, For the Countreys eyes are on me. Now to Kirkland, truly by it May that Say be verified, “Far from God, but neare the Temple, Though their Pastor give exemple, They are such a kind of vermin, Pipe they'd rather heare than Sermon. Now to Kendall, for A Towne so highly renouned for her commodious cloathing, and industrious Trading, as her name is become famous in that kind. Camb. in Brit. Cloth is my bread. Mot. Cloth-making, Sight, site, Now hast thou chang'd thy title unto May're, Let life, state, style improve thy charter there. Alderman awaking, Beauteous Damsels, modest mothers, And her foure and twenty brothers, Ever in her honour spreading, Where I had my native breeding. Where I'le tell you (while none mind us) We throw th' house quit out at windows, Nought makes them or me ought sory, They dance lively with John Dori: Holy Brethren with their Poet Sing, nor care they much who know it. Now to Staveley streight repaire I, Where sweet Birds doe hatch their airy, Arbours, Osyers freshly showing With soft mossie rinde or'e-growing: For woods, ayre, ale, all excelling, Would'st thou have a neater dwelling? Mirtil. Bee't so Faustulus! there repose thee, Cheere thy Country with thy posie; Live, fare-well, as thou deservest, Rich in Arethusa's harvest; Under th' Beach while Shepheards ranke thee Zephyrus blesse thee. Faust. I doe thanke thee. FINIS. Here in the Countrey live I with my Page, Where Tmolus Cups I make my golden age. Ceres send corne, with corne adde grapes unto it, Poet to wine, and long life to the Poet. Upon the Errata's. Reader, thinke no wonder by it, If with Towne I've Towne supplied, If my meeters backward nature Set before what should be later, “As for instance is exprest there, Harrington after Godmanchester. What though brieves too be made longo's? What tho vowels be dipthongo's? What tho graves become acute too? What tho accents become mute too? What tho freely, fully, plainly I've broke Priscians forehead mainly? What tho seat with seat I've strained? What tho my limpe-verse be maimed? What tho Night I've t'ane for Day too? What tho I've made bryers my way too? Know ye, I've declin'd most bravely 'Tituho-titubas-titubavi. FINIS. To Philoxenus. Thee, pleasing way-mates titled have their patron, Their Countreys glory, which they build their state on, The Poets wine-bush, w?? they use to prate on, Arts mery minion. In Lyrick measures doth thy Bard salute thee, Who with a constant resolution suits thee, Nor can ought move me to remove me fr? thee, But my religion. Bessie Bell: ENGLISHED; to be sung in Alterne Courses, &amp; Moderne voyces. Damætas. Eliza-Bella. Dam. My bonny Bell, I love thee so well, I would thou wad scud a lang hether, That we might here in a Cellar dwell, And blend our bows together! Deere a'rt to me as thy geere's to thee, The Warld will never suspect us, This place it is private, 'tis folly to drive it, Loves Spies have no eyes to detect us. Bel. Trust me Damætas, youth will not let us, Yet to be cing'd with loves taper, Bonny blith Swainlin intend thy Lamkin, To requite both thy layes and thy labour. I love not thee, why should'st thou love me, The yoake I cannot approve it, Then lye still with one, I'de rather have none, Nor I love, nor am lov'd, nor have loved. Dam. To lead Apes in hell, it will not do well, 'Tis an enemy to procreation, In the world to tarry and never to marry Would bring it soone to desolation. See my countnance is merry, cheeks red as chery, This Cover will never suspect us, This place it is private, 'tis folly to drive it, Loves Spyes have no eyes to detect us. Bel. 'Las, maidens must faine it, I love though I laine it, I would, but I will not confesse it, My yeares are consorting and faine would bee sporting, But bashfulnesse shames to expresse it. I love not thee, why should'st thou love me, That yoake I cannot approve it, Then lye still with one, I'de rather have none, Nor I love, nor am lov'd, nor have loved. Dam. My beauteous Bell, who stars doest excel, See mine eyes never dries but do weat me, Some c?fort unbuckle my sweet honey-suckle, Come away, doe not stay, I intreat thee. Delay would undoe me, hye quickly unto me, This River will never suspect us, This place it is private, 'tis folly to drive it, Loves Spyes have no eies to detect us. Bel. Come on Damatas, ripe age doth fit us, Take aside thy nak't Bride and enjoy her, So thou coll thy sweeting, let flocks fall a bleeting, My maids weed on thy meed I'le bestow there. Thus love I thee, so be thou love me, The yoake is so sweet I approve it, To lye still with one is better than none, I doe love, I am lov'd, and have lov'd it.
