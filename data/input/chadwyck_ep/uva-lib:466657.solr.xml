      <field name="fulltext">? “What thou canst attain, which best may serve To glorify the Maker, and infer Thee also happier, shall not be withheld Thy hearing ........ beyond abstain To ask, nor let thine own invention hope Things not reveal'd, which the invisible King, Only omniscient, hath suppress'd in night, To none communicable in earth and heaven: Enough is left besides to search or know.” Milton, Par. Lost, vii. 115–125. TO THE REV. GEORGE RICHARDS, D.D. VICAR OF ST. MARTIN'S IN THE FIELDS, WESTMINSTER. THE DAY OF JUDGMENT. The day of Christ; the last, the dreadful day; When thou, and I, and all the world shall come Before his judgment-seat, to hear their doom For ever and for ever: and when they, Who lov'd not God, far, far from him away Shall go:—but whither banish'd?—and with whom?— And they, who lov'd him, shall be welcom'd home To God, and Christ, and heav'n, and heav'n's array, Angels and saints made perfect.—May the scene Of that dread day be always present here, Here in my heart! that every day between, Which brings my passage to the goal more near, May find me fitter, by his love made clean, Before his throne of justice to appear! REST IN CHRIST. Hail, heavenly voice, once heard in Patmos! “Write, Henceforth the dead who die in Christ are blest: Yea, saith the Spirit, for they now shall rest From all their labours!” But no dull dark night That rest o'ershadows: 'tis the day-spring bright Of bliss; the foretaste of a richer feast; A sleep, if sleep it be, of lively zest, Peopled with visions of intense delight. And though the secrets of that resting-place The soul imbodied knows not; yet she knows, No sin is there God's likeness to deface, To stint his love no purgatorial woes; Her dross is left behind, nor mixture base Mars the pure stream of her serene repose. HEAVEN. The pleasant garden, and the crystal stream, The tree of life which bears on every bough Fruits fit for joy or healing; on the brow, Of glorious gold a living diadem; The thrones which blaze with many a radiant gem; The branching palms; the raiment white as snow: Are these the joys that heaven's abodes bestow? Or may they rather earth-form'd figures seem Of heavenly bliss?—To me it matters not, If I but reach the mark, whate'er the prize Of God's high calling. Be content that what Is told, is told us by the only Wise: And blest, supremely blest, must be the lot, Which Christ hath purchas'd, and which God supplies. HEAVENLY JOYS. O for the Christian's prize! to reign in bliss, Unceasing, pure, complete; to feel no sting Of death, sin, care, or sorrow; life's fresh spring To drink, and own the heart's sweet charities, A soul by Jesus cleans'd, and framed like his A body glorious; evermore to sing With saints and angels the thrice Holy King, To see his face, and know him as he is, Truth, wisdom, greatness, love! But one brief word Concentrates all in its capacious span; 'Tis heaven; the abode by God himself prepar'd For those that love him. Mete it as you can, Nor eye that bliss hath seen, nor ear hath heard, Nor dwells such rapture in the heart of man. THE BODY GLORIFIED. 'Tis night: behold, as if by death opprest, The sun his rays in gloom sepulchral hide! 'Tis day: behold, with renovated pride, In the magnificence of morning drest, The sun, rejoicing, lift his orient crest, A bridegroom issuing forth to meet his bride! Thus, like the sun, beneath the ocean tide, The Christian seeks the chamber of his rest; Thus, like the sun, to rise!—But not the same Shall rise, as when his mortal course was run: To that unearthly, pure, ethereal frame, That robe of amaranthine radiance spun, No nearer likeness this vile form may claim, Than glimmering star-light to yon glorious sun. THE INSECT TRANSFORMED. Have you not seen how pent in narrow room, From leaf to leaf the worm-like insect creeps? Have you not seen, how undistinguish'd sleeps That insect, girded by its death-like tomb? Till, bursting forth in vernal beauty's bloom, Quick into life the winged wonder leaps, Sports in the sun, the flower, the brooklet sips, Broider'd with brightest tints from nature's loom? So man, within his being's narrow ring, Crawls on his kindred earth: so down he lies In wintry slumber wrapt: in life's new spring Again, no more a grovelling worm, to rise; But, seraph-like, to soar on radiant wing, And quaff delight mid heav'n's unclouded skies. THE SPIRIT SANCTIFIED. Most wise meseems it, of that unseen state Whate'er in bounty God vouchsafes to show, Moral or intellectual, there to throw The inquiring eye, thereon to meditate; Think how the blest God's goodness emulate, And how they “see him as he is,” and know His essence, and to his resemblance grow. In heaven the sons of God such changes wait, To angels equall'd. Dost thou hope to win That sonship, that high knowledge to secure, And that divine similitude? Begin On earth; acquaint thyself with God; inure Thy thoughts to serve him like the cherubin, And seek for pureness ev'n as He is pure. THE ASSEMBLY AND CHURCH OF THE FIRST-BORN. It were a goodly and a glorious sight, The assembled Church from time's remotest age! Priest, patriarch, ruler, lawgiver, and sage; And they who soar'd the poet's lofty flight, Psalmist or seer; or fought the Gospel fight, God's truth proclaim'd, or stored the sacred page; With all of less renown, who dared engage Sin, and were conquerors in the Saviour's might. Behold them there! They stand before the gate (In heav'n their names are writ!) for entrance there What time their Captain comes. Cast off the weight That stays thy course; like them right onward bear, So shalt thou swell with them their Leader's state, Partake his triumph, and his banquet share. THE ANGELS. They are God's minist'ring spirits, and are sent, His messengers of mercy, to fulfil Good for salvation's heirs. For us they still Grieve when we sin, rejoice when we repent: And on the last dread day they shall present The severed righteous at his holy hill, With them God's face to see, to do his will, And bear with them his likeness. Was it meant, That we this knowledge should in secret seal, Unthought of, unimproving? Rather say, God deign'd to man his angel hosts reveal, That man might learn like angels to obey; And those, who long their bliss in heaven to feel, Might strive on earth to serve him ev'n as they. GOD'S PRESENCE IN HEAVEN. Yes, 'tis God's presence gives the welcomed blest Their joy and bliss supreme. With him to dwell, To see his glory, and his praises tell, To copy him of perfectness possest, The Holy, Holy, Holy! First and best Of joys, fruition's base and pinnacle; Without him, heav'n would more resemble hell, Darkness with him were light, and labour rest. God of my health, show me the way to bliss, The way to Thee! Who slight thy proffer'd grace, Sin is their portion now, at last the abyss Of woe. Thy image in my soul replace, That I may serve thee here in time; nor miss, When time shall fail, the brightness of thy face! GOD'S PRAISES IN HEAVEN. Methought I heard a voice to heav'n's high King Shout “Allelujah!” From a host it came, A countless number, which no man can name, Of God's redeem'd, attemper'd to the string Of harpers harping with their harps, that ring Symphonious: “Worthy is the Great I AM, Who us created; worthy is the Lamb, Who died to save us:” and again they sing, “Salvation, Allelujah!” Then I thought, With such celestial song what earthborn lays Of meaner theme may vie, too oft o'erfraught With vice or folly? May heaven's concert raise Heav'nward my thoughts and hopes, till, thither brought, I hear and join in that immortal praise! PRAISE TO GOD FOR HEAVEN REVEALED. As God of old his people's promised reign To Moses show'd afar from Pisgah's hill, The vine-clad mountain, and the crystal rill, City, and goodly field, and palm-tree plain, And Jordan's flood, and Judah's utmost main: So to his servants' eyes he proffers still, As in a map which they may scan who will, Their promised lot, their Canaan's rich domain. Praised be our bounteous God! and praised the more, That we herein are more than Moses blest! He with his eyes beheld, but went not o'er To tread the land by Israel's sons possest: To us God gives his promise to explore, To us to enter on his promised rest. HEAVEN REFLECTED. On Sinai's mount, on God's appointed place, When Israel's leader ceas'd to talk with God, Israel with awe beheld him, for there glow'd Jehovah's splendour on his servant's face. So they, on Sion's mount who love to trace His lineaments in blissful vision show'd, Their hearts, through joy of that divine abode, Reflect the brightness of celestial grace. The fruit bespeaks its soil. Angelick food Sweetens man's nature; and cherubick lyres Tune him to cherubs' notes. The soul, imbued With heavenly thoughts, to heavenly things aspires: And, in the mirror of God's Gospel view'd, Seeks to transcribe the image she admires. THE PROSPECT OF HEAVEN A MOTIVE TO EXERTION. Wouldest thou the mansions of the blest attain, (As who would not, for who would fain refuse Blessing and life, and death and evil choose?) Look upward, eyes and heart, to yon bright fane On that sky-piercing mount, and tow'rd it strain With loins well girt, and on thy feet the shoes Of Gospel preparation! God endues With strength who seek his face, but spare not pain Meanwhile and toil to boot. Thou on the gate Fix firm thy gaze, nor heed the lure that lies On right, on left, to tempt thee from the straight And onward path. Mark well the proffer'd prize, Strive, win and wear it! Shame and sorrow wait On feeble feet, faint heart, and wavering eyes. EARTH IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN'S HOME. Earth is no home of thine! A pilgrim thou Art, journeying onward to thine own abode, Thy proper resting-place. The inn, the road, Each common traveller's haunts, thy sojourn now, And now another's, these wilt thou allow The love to challenge to thy homestead ow'd? There shall thy heart be set, thy care bestow'd, Scope of thy morning toil, thy evening vow? God hath proclaim'd man's dwelling place above, That man his thoughts may elevate to high And holy things, which no corruption prove, Fit for immortal souls. Beyond the sky Thy home is fix'd: thereon be fix'd thy love, Nor seek from earth what earth can ne'er supply! THE MOURNER COMFORTED. “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall find Comfort and joy!” Though flesh and blood rebel 'Gainst heaven-ward thoughts, and the vext spirit swell With anxious tossings, still, the veil behind Of earth-born mists, the faith-directed mind, Sees thron'd in cloudless light the Invisible, At whose right hand delights in fulness dwell, And bliss for everlasting. Be resign'd, Thou child of sorrow, to his sovereign will; Drink as he bids, the bitter cup, and bear Thy cross in patience! From the holy hill A gleam shall cheer thee, till, safe-harbour'd there, Thou feel how faintly earth's severest ill May with the weight of heavenly joys compare! THE SINNER DISQUALIFIED FOR HEAVEN. Who, think'st thou, in the courts of heaven reside? They, who with malice burn, with envy pine, Ply the full feast and quaff the midnight wine, Loose pleasure's daughters, and the sons of pride? They who from meek affliction turn aside, Its plaints unheard; and bow at Mammon's shrine, Moloch's or Bel's; and, blind to truth divine, Neglect God's mercy, and his power deride? If such heaven's inmates, well thou runn'st thy race, Man of the world! But ah! let conscience tell, If holy hearts the holy city grace, What part hast thou therein; and ponder well, Yea, ponder well betimes that other place, And who its tenants, and with whom they dwell. HELL. To close the eyes on earth; to wake in hell, And lift them up in torments, mid the pains, Deep curses, loud laments, and penal chains Of those who dar'd against their God rebel, The Great, the Good, and from their station fell Of glory and bliss; with them, where darkness reigns, Where the worm dies not, and the fire remains Unquench'd, mid everlasting flames to dwell!— Whose is that lot, thou knowest. God undid The veil which screens his dreadfulness, that so Man might be warn'd and fear. What pangs are hid Beneath that lot, those sights and sounds of woe, Thou know'st not yet, nor canst thou. God forbid Thou e'er by feeling shouldst their anguish know! THE HOLY CITY. O! 'tis a glorious city! passing ken Of eye, and stretch of thought! earth's cities glow With no such lustre, nor such riches show. Holiness is its name. Each citizen Is pure and holy. There with sainted men, Purg'd from the native dross of earth below, And spirits whose natures no pollution know, God dwells, and He who once for man was slain, The Lamb all-spotless. Who a post would hold Therein, by him must thitherward be trod The path of holiness. That chosen fold Defilement enters not. And lo, in broad Letters of light its charter is inrolled, “None but the pure in heart shall see their God.” THANKS TO GOD FOR THE GIFT OF HEAVEN. Who to man's sight unfolds the bliss above? Who on lost man bestows that blissful prize? Who bids the musing spirit thither rise, The heart desire it, and the mind approve? Who, when the wayward thoughts to distance rove, Recalls them home, and points them to the skies? Who gives the terms, and strength withal supplies To heed and keep them? He whose name is love. He sent, from heaven's adoring hosts among, His Son to save us: He to heavenly rest Invites his saved. O, be his bounty sung, To him be glory, thanks, and praise addrest: The loud Hosanna of the tuneful tongue, The deep still homage of the thoughtful breast! KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER IN HEAVEN. I count the hope no day-dream of the mind, No vision fair of transitory hue, The souls of those, whom once on earth we knew, And lov'd, and walk'd with in communion kind, Departed hence, again in heav'n to find. Such hope to nature's sympathies is true; And such, we deem, the holy word to view Unfolds, an antidote for grief design'd, One drop from comfort's well. 'Tis thus we read The Book of life: but if we read amiss, By God prepar'd fresh treasures shall succeed To kinsmen, fellows, friends, a vast abyss Of joy; nor aught the longing spirit need, To fill its measure of enormous bliss. SORROW NOT WITHOUT HOPE. Weep for the dead! God bids you not restrain, What nature claims, affection's soothing tear. But weep, like Christian mourners! Tho' the bier Bear him away to death's obscure domain, Yet he with you, who still on earth remain, The summons of the Archangel's voice shall hear; And he with you before the Lord appear, Soar to the clouds, and meet you there again. Weep then, but do not as the hopeless weep, For them who rest in Christ! A common prize Awaits both them, and you, and all who keep His truth, and love His coming in the skies. They, in the Saviour who or wake or sleep, Shall all united in the Saviour rise. THE CHRISTIAN PASTOR'S JOY IN HIS FLOCK. 'Tis sweet to feel the waking consciousness Of home-bred rapture in the pensive mind: 'Tis sweet to think, that those, whom God hath join'd With us in love, the like enjoyments bless: But still more sweet the joy our hearts confess, To see ourselves by Providence design'd Stewards of good, where those we love may find The means and channel of their blessedness. Such, Christian pastor, is thy heart's delight, To serve thy God, and see thy people share His service, led by thee: with them how bright Thy joy to come, let holy Paul declare; A joy, a glory, and a crown of light, Which kings might envy and exult to wear THE REWARD OF CHRISTIAN BENEVOLENCE. Remove the seal from thy compassion's spring, And let the water for the pilgrims flow Of the world's waste, the sons of want and woe! Though their exhausted frame affliction wring; And hunger, thirst, and nakedness, the sting Of sharp disease, and bitter bonds they know; They are the “brethren,” he to call them so Vouchsafes, the brethren of thy Lord and King. A day shall come, when thou before his throne Those sons of woe with lively thoughts must see Of joy or anguish. Then shall far be shewn The alms in secret done; and publickly A voice proclaim, “Each act of mercy, done To these my brethren, has been done to me.” THE RE-UNION OF FRIENDS IN HEAVEN. There is a void in lorn affection's heart, Which yearns to be supplied. On God's high will Though it repose submissively, yet still Of those, who bore in its regards a part, The cherished forms it holds, as in a chart Depicted, hoping He may yet fulfil Their restitution. Pardon it if ill Lurk in that hope, Great Father! True thou art; Thou sayest the just shall bliss in fulness prove, And, what thou sayest, thy bounty will provide: And yet meseems the blissful souls above, The sense of earth's sweet charities denied, Might feel a craving in those realms of love, By angel hosts and patriarchs unsupplied. CHARITY NEVER FAILETH. What joy more pure, or worthier of our kind, Than when the good, the wise, the pious meet, By bond of kindred, love, or friendship sweet Link'd in a fellowship of heart and mind, And rivalry of worth! Nor shall they find More joy from ought in that celestial seat, Save from God's presence, than again to greet Each other's spirits, there to dwell combin'd In brotherhood of love. The golden tie Dissolv'd, again unites. Ordain'd to train Earth's tenants for their dwelling in the sky, Faith lost in sight, and hope in joy, shall wane, Their task fulfill'd; but heaven-born charity, God's greatest gift, shall still in heaven remain. THE CHANGED BODY RECOGNISED. And shall I e'er again thy features trace, Beloved friend; thy lineaments review? Yes: though the sunken eyes, and livid hue, And lips comprest, have quenched each lively grace, Death's triumph; still I recognise the face Which thine for many a year affection knew: And what forbids, that, cloth'd with life anew, It still on memory's tablet hold its place?— Tho' then thy cheek with deathless bloom be sheen, And rays of splendour wreathe thy sunlike brow, That change I deem shall sever not between Thee and thy former self; nor disallow That love's tried eyes discern thee through the skreen Of glory then, as of corruption now. HEAVEN'S BLISS NOT AFFECTED BY THOUGHTS OF HELL. Fear not, the prospect of the realms of woe Shall mar thy bliss, or thence sad thoughts arise To blunt thy sense of heavenly ecstasies. There, if thy heart with warm devotion glow Meet for thy place, 'twill solace thee to know No friend of thine, 'mid those keen agonies, In that dark prison-house of torment lies; For none is there but is of God the foe, An Alien thus from thee. The ties of blood, And earth's most sacred bonds, are but a twine Of gossamer, compar'd with what is ow'd To Him, the Lord of all! On Him recline; He shall thy heart of every care unload, He bid thy day with cloudless lustre shine. HEAVEN'S JOYS PERFECT. 'Tis naught but bliss in that celestial seat! Where God, essential good, resides, and where Thron'd with the Lamb he deigns his joy prepare For those that love Him, floods of pleasure meet. The deep delight of that secure retreat No uncongenial thoughts annoy; nor care, Nor pain, nor grief, but bliss alone is there, Pure, undisturb'd, undimm'd, divinely sweet. Pure as the snow that lies on Lebanon, Wreath above wreath in virgin brightness pil'd; Calm as yon lake, when not a breath hath blown On its clear crystal; cloudless as the mild Moonlight, o'er heav'n a robe of silver thrown; Sweet as the slumber of a sinless child. THE AMBITIOUS DISCIPLES. Rash was the tongue, and unadvisedly bold, Which sought, Salome, for thy favour'd twain Above their fellows in Messiah's reign On right, on left, the foremost place to hold. More rash perhaps, and bolder, that which told Of pow'r the Saviour's bitter cup to drain, And, passing stretch of human strength, sustain His bath baptismal. Lord, by thee enroll'd Thy servant, grant me thy Almighty grace, My destin'd portion of thy griefs to bear, Ev'n what thou wilt! But chiefly grant, thy face Within thy glory's realm to see, where'er Most meet thy wisdom deems; whate'er the place, It must be blest, for thou, my God, art there. DEGREES OF HEAVENLY HAPPINESS. If loftier posts superior state declare; More virtuous acts if ampler meeds requite; If brightest crowns on noblest prowess light, And well-sown fields a fuller harvest bear; If thrones, dominions, princedoms, powers there are, Which God's inferior hosts excel in might; If day's bright orb outshine the lamp of night, And Hesper's radiance the remotest star: Then shall the younger brethren of the sky, If right I scan the records of their fate, In varied ranks of social harmony God's mount encircle. Glorious is the state Ev'n of the lowest there: but seats more nigh The Sovereign's throne his greater servants wait. CONFORMITY TO CHRIST'S EXAMPLE, THE WAY TO HIS GLORY. Seek thou the image of the Lord to share, And thou shalt share his glory! If the will Of God require thee thy heart's blood to spill For him, a willing martyr; or to bear Thy cross, thro' sickness, penury, and care, And drink affliction's cup: or thro' the still Calm vale thy course of righteousness fulfil, And his mild yoke in love and pureness wear: Hold fast the Great Exemplar!—Blest are they Who stem serenely the world's uproar wild, Nor fears dishearten them, nor pains dismay: Nor they less blessed, who, humbly as a child, Far from the world pursue their blameless way, And by the world's allurements undefiled. HAPPINESS PREPARED OF THE FATHER FOR CHRIST'S DISCIPLES. God for his own elect prepares a throne Of glorious brightness: what the Sire prepares, The Son bestows; so strict an union theirs, In nature, substance, will, and actions one. Would'st thou that throne of glory make thy own? Purge off each earthly passion, that impairs Thy heavenly likeness; to salvation's heirs Perform the angels' part; and in the Son Love God! The pure, the merciful, the meek, The poor in spirit, and the rich in love, Are his delight, his children. Such bespeak The holy influence of the mystick Dove: Such best below his heavenly kingdom seek, Such come most near Him in the realm above. THE CHRISTIAN'S AIM. Aim at the highest prize: if there thou fail, Thou'lt haply reach to one not far below. Strive first the goal to compass: if too slow Thy speed, the attempt may ne'ertheless avail The next best post to conquer. Let not quail Eye, heart, or limb; but still right onward go: The Judge shall heed thee, and a crown bestow, And bid thy name the loud-voic'd herald hail. To the wish'd mark one racer only came Of old victorious: to intwine his brow One only grasp'd the crown, and won the game, Isthmian or proud Olympian. Happier thou Pursu'st thy course with no uncertain aim, Secure to seize an amaranthine bough. CHRISTIAN AMBITION. “Ambition is the vice of noble souls!” If 'tis a vice, then let those souls beware, Thrice noble tho' they be, and passing fair In the world's eye, and high upon the scrolls, Her favour'd minions where the world inrolls, Lest it conduct to shame! Be thine the care, Soldier of Christ, that nobler strife to dare, Which the rash spirit of the world controls, And makes ambition virtue! Be it thine To win thy bright unfading diadem By works of love!—Around his brows shall shine In heaven from glory's source the purest beam, Whose aspect here, with beauty most divine, Reflects the image of the Good Supreme. MUSINGS ON THE CHURCH AND HER SERVICES. “Her foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Very excellent things are spoken of thee, thou city of God.” —Psalm lxxxvii. 1, 2. I. TO MY COUNTRY'S CHURCH. As oft on thee, my country's Church, I muse, Thy form apostolick, thy scripture creed, Devotions pure, and rites divine, the seed Of heavenly graces, with what else may use The aspiring soul the better part to choose; I marvel much and grieve that aught should breed Ill thoughts of thee in Christian men, by deed Or word to mar thy beauty and refuse Thy chaste communion. Yes, my early vow Was thine, and still thy sanctuaries I've trod With honest zeal. Accept this tribute now Of filial love, to thee, My Mother, owed! The stay and pillar of God's truth art thou, And thou the temple of the living God. II. THE CHURCH APOSTOLICK. Some are there, nam'd of Christ, who think they see His power conferr'd on one vicegerent man: And some, who deem the scheme republican More near akin to Christian liberty: And some, who, as by light of history The scripture records of God's will they scan, From times primeval mark the self-same plan, Which still prevails, my country's Church in thee, Of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons.—Peace to all, Who serve their God in love and faith sincere, Howe'er they serve him! each must stand or fall To his own Lord. For me, with godly fear And awe I listen to my Saviour's call, And here I seek, and trust I find him here. III. TRUE KNOWLEDGE. What is True Knowledge?—Is it with keen eye Of lucre's sons to thread the mazy way? Is it of civick rights, and royal sway, And wealth political, the depths to try? Is it to delve the earth, or soar the sky? To marshal nature's tribes in just array? To mix, and analyse, and mete, and weigh Her elements, and all her powers descry?— These things, who will may know them, if to know Breed not vain glory. But o'er all to scan God, in his works and word shown forth below; Creation's wonders, and Redemption's plan; Whence came we, what to do, and whither go:— This is True Knowledge, and “the whole of man.” IV. THE NAME OF GOD. See Turner's History of the Anglo Saxons, vol. i. p. 212. 8vo. Choose we a title, which may best beseem The world's Creator! Shall his name declare The power which made all living things that are? The providence, whose eye's unerring beam Sees all things at a glance, that naught may seem Or dark or distant? The protecting care, Which sleep impedes not, nor can time impair? Or, sovereign over all, the will supreme?— Well judg'd our Saxon fathers. To their sense Appear'd the self-existing One indued With all his nature's dread magnificence. On all with awe they gaz'd; but most they viewed With deep delight his moral excellence, Their being's source and stay, and call'd him “Good.” V. THE WORKS OF GOD. Trace nature's course; each step the Maker tells! His majesty the glorious heavens declare; His all-pervading breath the expanded air; The roaring sea his might, which hers excels; Earth and her sons, each vein with life that swells, Sentient or senseless, his providing care, Wise, powerful, good, which form'd them as they are, And still preserves: a host of miracles, Unnumber'd, vast, unceasing! Look around! Look to thyself, thy frame, thy soul: the sign, Where'er thou look'st, of reasoning power is found, Forecasting will, intelligent design; Deem nature not their author; nor confound With his own laws the Lawgiver divine. VI. GOD'S PROVIDENCE. Father of all, the powerful and the good! To thee the fowls of air for succour cry: No seed-time theirs, nor well-stored granary, But thou sustain'st them with their daily food. Nor less thy plants, a well-robed multitude, Which spring to wither, and are born to die, The field-flow'rs grow beneath thy fostering eye, With beauty, passing royal pomp, indued. Father of all! On thee I cast my care, By doubts distracted, and by fears distrest! O, grant me strength thy righteous yoke to bear, Thy will to do, on thy support to rest! Whate'er we need, thy bounty will not spare Those lower gifts, if first we seek the best. VII. THE BOOK OF GOD. The Book of God! And is there then a book Which on its front that awful title bears? Who hold it, what high duty must be theirs, And what high privilege, therein to look, To read, mark, learn, digest! But in this nook Of earth pent up, and blinded by earth's cares, Its hopes and joys, if man the treasure dares To scorn, such scorn shall the great Author brook!— How long'd the holy men and prophets old God's truth to see! How blest, whom He hath will'd To see his truth in his own book inroll'd! Pure is the Book of God, with sweetness fill'd: More pure than massive unadulterate gold, More sweet than honey from the rock distill'd. VIII. THE LAW. He spake in thunder, making the heart quail Of conscious Israel, when from Sinai's height God gave his Law! And well might deep affright The soul appal: for who, by nature frail, Could do his bidding? Yet beneath the veil Of shadowy type, and sacrificial rite, And lofty prophecy, the illumin'd sight Might far off scenes of better promise hail. Revere its voice; 'tis “holy, just, and good:” But look not there for pardon, nor confide To 'scape its curse! 'Twas given, that flesh and blood Might stand condemn'd, by that tribunal tried: And, by the standard of God's justice view'd, Man see his weakness, and forego his pride. IX. THE GOSPEL. 'Twas musick's voice, and thus the descant ran, “Glory to God,” what time to Bethlehem's fold The Saviour's birth the angelick anthem told, “On earth be peace, benevolence to man!” And He, who then his earthly course began, What did He else but that sweet hymn unfold, A lovely sight for angels to behold, And men to copy?—Duly as ye can Transcribe the pattern! What the Law austere Gave not, the Gospel gives: by truth portray'd Life's perfect model; and the radiance clear Of brighter light; and stronger grace to aid; And hope, the debtor's prison-house to cheer, The debt all cancell'd, and the ransom paid. X. SCRIPTURE DIFFICULTIES. Yes, 'tis a mine of precious jewelry, The Book of God; a well of streams divine! But who would wish the riches of that mine To make his own; his thirst to satisfy From that pure well; must ear, eye, soul, apply; On precept precept scan, and line on line; Search, ponder, sift, compare, divide, combine, For truths that oft beneath the surface lie. Yes; there are things, which he who runs may read: Nor few there are, which yield a harder part, To mark, discern, and know. With cautious heed, 'Tis God's command, survey thy safety's chart; Lest arduous things, distorted, death-ward lead The mind unlearned, and the unstable heart 2 Pet. iii. 16.. XI. SCRIPTURE GUIDES. “How can I sound the depths of sacred lore Without the guidance of a friendly hand Acts viii. 30, 31.?” Such Candour's meek confession, as he scann'd Thy volume, Seer evangelick, of yore. And Candour still, 'mid truth's exhaustless store, Will own his powers unapt to understand Much of God's word untaught. 'Twas Christ's command, His preacher's voice the sound of truth should pour On listening ears; “and I with you remain Till the world's end!” And tho' the world to turn From sin, his truth in one recorded strain Subsist, for living lips the many yearn Their guides; and He, who works nor wills in vain, Still wills that some should teach and some should learn, XII. THE LORD'S DAY. Hail to the day, which He, who made the heaven, Earth, and their armies, sanctified and blest, Perpetual memory of the Maker's rest! Hail to the day, when He, by whom was given New life to man, the tomb asunder riven, Arose! That day his Church hath still confest, At once Creation's and Redemption's feast, Sign of a world call'd forth, a world forgiven. Welcome that day, the day of holy peace, The Lord's own day! to man's Creator owed, And man's Redeemer; for the soul's increase In sanctity, and sweet repose bestow'd; Type of the rest, when sin and care shall cease, The rest remaining for the lov'd of God! XIII. GOD'S SABBATH. Call'd by the Church, before God's holy shrine, Oft as the Sabbath-morn with sacred ray Warns me his courts to tread, I humbly pray, That for time past forgiveness may be mine, Whene'er I've err'd, and he will still incline My heart no more from his command to stray; But holy keep and unprofan'd the day, First blest and hallow'd by the voice divine. Are there who deem a less commanding law Alone gives sanction to the Christian's rest? Be theirs their fond conceit! Be mine to draw The mind to reverence, by God's Church confest, His own commandment: and with holy awe Revere the day by man's Creator blest! XIV. THE HOUSE OF GOD. It is the Sabbath bell which calls to pray'r, Ev'n to the House of God, the hallow'd dome, Where he, who claims it, bids his people come, To bow before his throne, and serve him there With pray'rs, and thanks, and praises. Some there are Who hold it meet to linger now at home; And some o'er fields and the wide hills to roam, And worship in the temple of the air! For me, not heedless of the lone address, Nor slack to greet my Maker on the height, By wood, or living stream; yet not the less Seek I his presence in each social rite Of his own temple: that he deigns to bless, There still he dwells, and there is his delight. XV. SOCIAL WORSHIP. There is a joy, which angels well may prize; To see, and hear, and aid God's worship, when Unnumber'd tongues, a host of Christian men, Youths, matrons, maidens join. Their sounds arise, “Like many waters:” now glad symphonies Of thanks and glory to our God; and then, Seal of the social pray'r, the loud Amen! Faith's common pledge; contrition's mingled cries. Thus, when the Church of Christ was hale and young, She call'd on God, one spirit and one voice: Thus from corruption cleans'd, with health new strung, Her sons she nurtur'd. O, be theirs the choice, What duty bids, to worship heart and tongue, At once to pray, at once in God rejoice! XVI. SPIRITUAL COMMUNION. O, it is full of joy and pleasantness, The sabbath bell, which to God's house of pray'r On God's own day his people bids repair; Aid at his throne to seek, their sins confess, To speak his praises, and his bounty bless, And hear his holy word! For with them there God dwells, and gives them through his Son to share Health from the Spirit of his blessedness. But grieve not thou, as if from grace divine Secluded, nor thy loss too deeply rue, Whom needful cause, not choice, forbids to join The great assembly! With devotion true Be thou in spirit there, and doubt not thine Shall be a part of God's celestial dew. XVII. THE CATHEDRAL. Oft on the hallow'd piles I love to gaze, Which our forefathers built: whether the round Deep arch, and massive pillars quaintly crown'd, Of Norman grandeur; or, of home-born praise, The lighter forms which grac'd Plantagenet's days, High-pointed vault, and shafts in clusters bound: Or where the trellis'd net-work richly wound O'er Tudor's roofs and low-brow'd portals strays. Gaze on them! They are worthy, and declare A brave munificence! Nor let thy heart Indulge the niggard thought, that aught is there Of vain profusion. Noble was the art, And nobly us'd, which gave their God to share From his own gifts a large and liberal part. XVIII. CHORAL SERVICE. And well I love the organ's notes to hear Sounding aloud thro' all the sacred pile, High altar, vaulted nave, and pillar'd aisle: Link'd with that sound if voice of anthem clear Alone, or chant alternate win the ear, Or mingled swell of many tongues; the while The high-roof'd tower, and arches' lessening file, Send back the pealing thunder. Heav'n's blest sphere Resounds with song and harpings: and I deem The rich-ton'd organ and symphonious choir Give taste of heaven. Devotion's self may seem From musick's flame to catch a warmer fire; And wafted by her breath, as on the steam Of fragrant incense, to the skies aspire. XIX. THE VILLAGE CHURCH. Dear is the ancient Village Church, which rears By the lone yew, on lime or elm-girt mound, Its modest fabrick: dear, amid the sound Of bells, the grey embattled tower, that wears Of changeful hue the marks of by-gone years; Buttress, and porch, and arch with mazy round Of curious fret, or shapes fantastick, crown'd; Tall pinnacles, and mingled window tiers, Norman, or misnam'd Gothick. Fairer spot, Thou giv'st not, England, to the tasteful eye, Nor to the heart more soothing. Blest their lot, Knew they their bliss, who own, their dwelling nigh, Such resting place, there, by the world forgot, In life to worship, and when dead to lie. XX. PAROCHIAL SERVICE. And dear it is, within the village fane To go and worship! Simple tho' it be, Whate'er of pray'r, or holy mystery To cleanse or strengthen, God hath will'd ordain; And priest, and sacred truth's unsullied strain, Are here: nor wants there voice of psalmody, Rude, but not coarse; then sweetest, when most free From art, and led by yonder youthful train. God owns the worship, which his laws approve, Whether mid populous city, nor the less In lonely hamlet. Lift thy heart above, And prosper! He religion's costly dress Rejects not, worn in meekness, faith, and love; And he the lowlier village rites will bless. XXI. THE CHURCH'S CEREMONIAL. 'Tis not that thou art robed in gorgeous sheen, Thy native charms outshone by jewels' glare: For one there is, that thus o'ersteps thee far, Who sits upon her mountain, as a queen. 'Tis not that thou all unadorn'd art seen: For, far beyond thee, some again there are, Who count it beauty when they nothing wear, Unclad, or clad in raiment poor and mean. Not for such cause, lov'd Mother, I admire Thy features, drest anew in elder days By holy men: but that thy meet attire Thy form with decent dignity arrays; Where simple neatness, modest grace, conspire To deck thy beauty to thy Sovereign's praise. XXII. THE LORD'S PRAYER. All thanks to Him, who taught us how to pray! So taught we beg, our heavenly Father's name, Dominion, will, may have their rightful claim, Be hallow'd, serv'd, obey'd: that He each day May give us needful food, and drive away Unkindness, danger, sin; and thus proclaim His kingdom, power, and glory. Do not blame, If, whom she knows “the life, the truth, the way,” On his blest word with reverential awe And grateful faith the Church hath aye relied, And led and modell'd by his perfect law Her meek devotions! Lord, by thee supplied With light, still near the throne of grace we draw, Thy name our safeguard, and thy word our guide! XXIII. THE APOSTLES' LITURGY. If, by the rule Apostolick, to plead For all that God holds good, and deprecate What He holds evil; if with our estate Our brother man's to blend, and intercede For friend and foe, but chief that we may lead In peace, and rul'd by God's crown'd delegate, Lives pure and holy; if to dedicate Thanks for past good with pray'r for present need; Be welcome worship: then content with thee, My country's Church, I join the voice to raise, Collect, and psalm inspir'd, and litany, And hymn of glory. Ever-varying phrase God seeks not; pleas'd, when from corruption free, And cloth'd with truth, his Church her homage pays. XXIV. PRAYER IN CHRIST'S NAME. Ask you perchance, the throne of grace before, Why still her pray'rs the Church delights to frame Of varied form, but gives to each the same Essential closure? 'Tis that from his store Of boundless bounties God delights to pour All good on man in his Beloved's name. Who prays for aught, in Christ must urge the claim: Who calls on God, must by the Son adore The Father. “Blessings of my Father seek, Seek in my name, and have whate'er ye need John xiv. 13; xvi. 23.!” “Thank God for all things, but your praises speak In Jesus' name Eph. v. 20. Heb. xiii. 15.!” Thou, who for us didst bleed, On thee we cast us, worthless all and weak, Thy might acknowledge, and thy merits plead. XXV. DEVOUT WORSHIP. Nay, sit not there unheedful, nor profane With attitude of cold indifference God's worship! Sighs of contrite penitence, The lowly pray'r that seeks relief from pain, The hymn of praise, thanksgiving's festive strain, Claim they no seemlier posture? True; pretence May mimick, but devotion's heartfelt sense Devotion's guise will choose. The sainted train, Apostles, psalmists, prophets; Lord of all, The Prince of glory, when our form he wore, With bended knees submissive stoop'd to call To heaven's high King: yea, heaven's crown'd saints, before The throne of God, in sign of worship fall, Their crowns cast off, and prostrate there adore. XXVI. THE CHRISTIAN'S BELIEF. What God for man's instruction deigns reveal, His guide to truth, and love, and holiness, We hold that man should hear, believe, confess; Not slight, nor spurn, nor thanklessly conceal The heavenly treasure; but with earnest zeal Strive for the faith, before the Church express His hope assur'd of promis'd blessedness, And with his lips his heart's persuasion seal. On those, who sunk in heathen darkness pine, No doom we dare pronounce. But Christian light Brings Christian duties. Where the sunbeams shine Of Gospel truth, who wish for heav'n's delight, Must own and serve the tri-une name divine, And plead for health the incarnate Godhead's might. XXVII. PSALMODY. Are sounds of musick heard among the blest? And does in heav'n the Church triumphant raise, Circling the throne of God, the voice of praise? Well may her voice on earth, ere she her rest From warfare gain, be thus to God addrest: While Sion's songs, the Psalmist's heav'n taught lays, And hymns, the first-fruits of the Gospel days, Her thanks, and joy, and holy hopes attest. There are, whose voice by strains less sweet is shar'd. Me the pure songs, by Siloa's echoes caught, Suffice. Nor deem I that the pledg'd regard, To thee, my Mother, ow'd, permits us aught, But what thou vouchest! song of gifted bard, Rich in God's truth, and by his Spirit taught. XXVIII. THE CHURCH-YARD. As by the Church-yard yew my evening way I take, and meditate the sacred muse, To catch thy notes my ears unbidden use, Sweet Elegist, sublimely solemn Gray! Yet ah! thy pensive moralising lay Were to my heart more grateful, if thy views, Profusely rich in earth's autumnal hues, Show'd more of heaven's enlivening vernal day. “The paths of glory lead but to the grave”— Lo, from the grave fresh paths of glory rise! Reviving thence the “flower” shall breathe and wave With purer sweetness and with lovelier dyes; And the bright “gem,” releas'd from ocean's cave, Adorn with sun-like ray its kindred skies. XXIX. THE TOMB-STONES. From stone to stone my eyes successive roam, And note what tenants underneath them lie. Each sex is here; all ages, infancy To second childhood: some the stately tomb, Some hold the osier'd earth's contracted room, Signs of their former fortunes: low and high, All ranks and states of earth's society, All earthly kindreds, find a common home. Hark, from the grave with still small voice they call, And thus the moral of their stories preach! “We all were born, we lived, we died, and all Shall rise to judgment. How on earth by each His task was done, and what shall each befall, Inquire not now; that day alone can teach!” XXX. CHURCH BELLS. What varied sounds from yon grey pinnacles Sweep o'er the ear, and claim the heart's reply! Now the blithe peal of home festivity, Natal or nuptial, in full concert swells: Now the brisk chime, or voice of alter'd bells, Speaks the due hour of social worship nigh: And now the last stage of mortality, The deep dull toll with lingering warning tells. How much of human life those sounds comprise; Birth, wedded love, God's service, and the tomb! Not heard in vain, if thence kind feelings rise, Such as befit our being, free from gloom Monastick; pray'r, that communes with the skies; And musings mindful of the final doom. XXXI. THE VILLAGE CLOCK. Hark, 'tis the Village clock! It bids the swain, As breaks the morning, to his labour haste A-field: and now the hour of noon's repast The glad stroke tells, short season to remain, For the next note of time is heard again Sign of returning toil, until at last It's welcome sound bespeaks the day is past, And sends him home releas'd from care and pain, Till the next morning dawn. Thus hour by hour, And day by day, time creeps unresting by, Mark'd by the sound from the low village tower, Our work-day's guide; on days, beyond that lie, Note we meanwhile its everlasting power, For time's the passport to eternity. XXXII. THE PARSONAGE. See you that house beneath the church-topp'd hill? An elm o'erhangs the porch, and round it twine The honey-suckle and sweet eglantine: And there the mullion'd windows linger still, Reliques of elder days, the moulded sill, And pointed arch, where creeps the cluster'd vine: And flowers, and fruits, and well-trimm'd turf combine To show domestick taste and rural skill. There lives the Village Pastor! Mark him there! From weightier duties for a season freed Of books and pastoral calls, his willing care The garden claims, to check the trailing weed, And prune the fruit branch. Breathe a passing pray'r, And bid the good man and his works “God speed!” XXXIII. THE MAN OF GOD. He's Christ's ambassador, that man of God, Steward of God's own mysteries! From on high His warrant is: his charge, aloud to cry And spread his Master's attributes abroad, His works, his ark of mercy, and his rod Of justice; his, to sinners to supply The means of grace, and point how they may fly Hell-flames, and how heaven's pathway must be trod. Hold him in honour on his works' account, And on his Master's! Though a man he be, And with his flock partake corruption's fount, Holy and reverend is his ministry: And, hark! a voice sounds from the heavenly mount, “He, that despiseth you, despiseth me!” XXXIV. THE GOSPEL MINISTRY. How beautiful upon the mountain's head Isa. lii. 7. Rom. x. 15., Like “the bright morning-star, day's harbinger Milton.,” The feet of them, who to their country bear News of release for slaves to bondage led! How beautiful on Judah's hills the tread Of feet to Sion sent, to minister Good tidings of great joy, and cry to her, “Joy, for her warfare is accomplished!”— Still are ye beautiful, ye feet, that bring On God's high embassage the authentick sign Of peace. 'Tis yours, God's light abroad to fling, That men may see his Glorious Gospel shine: 'Tis theirs to greet you heralds of heav'n's King, Divine your mission, as your charge divine. XXXV. THE PRIESTHOOD. Take not the holy office, till the call Of God has made thee, Aaron-like, be known His minister! Tho' round thy loins be thrown Zeal, as thou deem'st, to gird thee, and the pall Of sanctity; yet not for these, for all Thy private worth, does the great Master own Thy Priesthood, till the honour'd claim be shown By lawful charge and hands episcopal. God is a God of order, nor approves Confusion in his Church! What'er he wills, He freely does, but still by laws he moves, Laws of his own!—Among the vales and hills Its stated course the heaven-fed river roves: He marks its path, and he its channel fills. XXXVI. THE INWARD CALL. Who gives to man sufficiency? and whence Proceed the holy wish, the good design, The righteous deed, save from the source divine, The Spirit of God?—If thine the heart-felt sense Of holy love; if, cautious of offence, Thine be the wish with knowledge meet to join True zeal of God, and so to serve his shrine; Fear not to own thy humble confidence, God's Spirit moves thee to the work!—No bold Presumptuous bearing, no intemperate flame, No voice internal loud and uncontroll'd, God or his Church expects; but the just aim Sincere, to feed, not unprepar'd, his fold With food celestial, and adorn his name. XXXVII. PASTORAL STUDIES. Who would teach others, first himself must learn The lore he fain would teach them. Who would teach High lore, surpassing human wisdom's reach, For grace must beg God's wisdom to discern, Nor fail God's sacred book by day to turn, By night: yet think not 'twill God's pow'r impeach, If weapons, meet to pierce the hidden speech, He fetch from learning's armory, nor spurn Aid from well-cultur'd reason. Truth divine Comes not with light intuitive to guide The man of God; tho', duly sought, 'twill shine His polar star. Then may his vessel ride In safety on: nor from its course decline Astray, nor founder in the darkling tide. XXXVIII. PASTORAL RECREATIONS. What fitter, man of God, thy thoughts to share, To charm, nor less improve, a vacant hour, Than thy great Master's works?—The wild field-flower, Insect or bird, that gaily wings the air, And what earth holds of wonderful or fair, Invite thee forth; to thread the coppice bower, Pierce the deep glen, or climb the rocky tower, Wave-hollow'd bank, thick wood, or mountain bare. Rich is the volume of the word of God: Rich is the volume of his works! At home Be that; be this thy cherish'd search abroad! Like Noah's dove, there see each fine-wrought plume God's love attest: each plant, like Aaron's rod, With signs of might and thought paternal bloom! XXXIX. THE PREACHER. Who would not choose the Preacher's words sincere, Which truth unmaim'd and unadulterate deal To willing ears and minds? With prudent zeal, Temperate, tho' earnest; grave, but not austere; Strong, without coarseness; without meanness, clear; Firm, to denounce God's wrath; but meek to feel For human frailty; pitiful, to heal The wounded spirit, and the weak to rear Gently with mild endurance! Wouldst thou find Wild rhapsody, the gesture strange, the start Ecstatick, apt the better sense to blind? Go, elsewhere seek it! His the soberer part, Like Paul to satisfy the reasoning mind, And “draw by cords of man Hos. xi. 4.” the obedient heart. XL. PREACHING EVANGELICAL. Say, what is Gospel-Preaching?—'Tis to show, How from his Father's love by wilful deed Man fell; and how, for ransom'd man to bleed, The Son of God took in this world of woe Our flesh, and quell'd by death our mortal foe: And what his Spirit's aid; and whither lead His laws; his means of grace; and what the meed Of faith, matur'd by love; and what we owe The Three in One! This knowledge, passing reach Of man's device or angel's, broad and deep, God by his Son deliver'd; this to teach Mankind, he charg'd the shepherds of his sheep: If man or angel other Gospel preach Gal. i. 8., He “sows the wind, and shall the whirlwind reap Hos. viii. 7..” XLI. PREACHING UN-EVANGELICAL. “To shut the gates of mercy on mankind Gray's Elegy.,” By God's mere will excluded, save a few, Will they or not, who pass selected through; To stint the stream of heavenly love; to bind By strong necessity the human mind To sin and endless woe; to hold to view The God of all perfection, as untrue, Unjust, unpardoning, pitiless, unkind: Is this to preach the Gospel?—In thy word Not such, great God, thy loving-mercy's call These eyes o'erjoy'd have seen, these ears have heard. Thy name is “love 1 John iv. 8. 16..” By our forefather's fall, All sinn'd and died. Forgive me if I've err'd, Deeming thy Son a ransom paid for all 1 Tim. ii. 6.! XLII. THE POOR MAN'S FRIEND. “He was the poor man's friend! He sought and knew Who needed succour, and would fain incline His ear and hearken. From his care benign The parent help, the child instruction true, Deriv'd: on age a cheering gleam he threw: The sick man's wounds he bath'd with oil and wine: On sin denounc'd the scourge of wrath divine, But more the meek with words of comfort drew.”— You've read his epitaph: do you ask his name? Full many a poor man's friend does Britain own Among her pastors; though from publick fame Remote they labour, mark'd by God alone, And those they tend; but mid the world's acclaim The Lord's “Well done” shall make their labours known. XLIII. THE PASTOR'S HELP MEET. And no kind help dost thou, my country, know, Meet for such Pastor?—Yes, 'tis she who bears Her more than portion in his household cares; Wife of his bosom, friend in weal or woe, His children's mother! As thro' life they go, Knit in the bonds of holy love, 'tis hers, As woman may beseem whose meekness fears Offence, his charge to deem her own, and sow Instruction, comfort, round. Alas, she needs Comfort herself too oft, when left to feel Want link'd with widowhood. Her gentle deeds Bear then in mind; to her the kindness deal, She dealt to others; bind the wound that bleeds, And soothe the heart which none but God can heal! XLIV. THE PASTOR'S WIDOW AND ORPHANS. Yes, she must go, and from their place of birth Her children with her; from that pleasant spot, Where Providence had cast their goodly lot, The Pastor's dwelling. They the tale of mirth No more shall pass around yon Christmas hearth; No more shall they on yonder grassy plot Sport the long summer eve: for he is not, The husband, father!—Truly they on earth Are strangers, pilgrims they! Their wonted home, Yes, they must leave; and what may then betide, O God, thou knowest. O, as hence they roam, Mayst thou watch over them! Mayst thou provide Friends, shelter, food, and comfort yet to come, The orphan's Father, and the widow's Guide! XLV. THE ARK OF CHRIST'S CHURCH. Rent were at once the floodgates of the sky, And burst the great deep's fountains. All was dark, Throng'd with the forms of drowning men: and, hark, O'er the wide earth one agonising cry! Then mid the swelling surge, careering high, Fraught with the world's remains, the Patriarch's ark Went o'er the waters: for that wondrous bark Liv'd in the safeguard of Jehovah's eye. Past is the plague! But still o'er earth the flood Of sin reigns paramount: still God provides An Ark of health for those who walk with God; His power secures it, and his wisdom guides. Faith clings obedient to that lov'd abode, And o'er the waves the life-fraught vessel rides. XLVI. HOLY BAPTISM. To the enliv'ning font the sponsors came, Bearing their infant charge; the white-rob'd priest Stood there beside. Then with meek pray'r addrest To the Great Sire the promis'd boon to claim, The babe, unconscious yet of sin or shame, With greeting kind the holy man embrac'd, And on his brow the cleansing water cast, And spake the mystick words, the Triune Name. The sight was common: but withal a sight, So sweet, so lovely, to behold a son Of God adopted by his own blest rite— Methought that Seraphs round about the throne Might gaze thereon o'erjoyed: and with delight Hail the new-born a brother of their own. XLVII. THE BAPTIZED IN HEALTH. Why not before the Church, with reverence due, As she enjoins, thy infant consecrate? Why not God's rite in God's house celebrate? Why publick forms withdraw from publick view? Why ancient rules displace for fancies new? Why tempt the man of God to desecrate Religion's face august, and violate His own high charge, nor hold allegiance true? Alas! that fashion thus the palm from sense, From order, right, and decency should win! That holy rite should breed the law's offence! And when we pray, that, as our babes begin, So they their lives may lead, we date it thence, Where our own act is not exempt from sin! XLVIII. THE BAPTIZED IN DANGER. Sickness is on thy infant: great the need, And urgent! Haste, thy parish pastor crave To visit thee, the sinking babe to lave With rite baptismal. For God's grace to plead Few words suffice, when danger prompts to speed. He breathes the hallowing pray'r; in the pure wave Bathes the sin-born; and speaks the word to save Effectual, symbol of thy Christian creed. Now peace be thine! For his beloved Son On thy regenerate infant God hath smil'd. Lives he? Before the Church give God his own: Or, if the Almighty Father claim his child, Yield him content! To heav'n his soul hath flown, An angel spirit, cleans'd and undefil'd. XLIX. SPIRITUAL LIFE. He brooded o'er the waters at the first, The Spirit of Life, o'er waters void and dead: And, as he brooded, formless chaos fled, Life glow'd, and nature into being burst. And tho' the ground, by ban primeval curst, Sin's penalty, hath thorns and thistles bred; With beauty still is nature's face o'erspread, Fann'd by his breeze, and by his sunshine nurst. 'Tis so with man. In his baptismal hour The Spirit bathes and raises him from death: And tho' the weeds of sin with noxious power Mar the celestial plant, the Spirit's breath Rears with its genial warmth the languid flower, And fruits of Eden ripen on the heath. L. A BIRTH-DAY THOUGHT. It is my natal day! Another year Is register'd against me in the account Of time to me entrusted, and the amount Of that rich talent for my trial here By one more year diminish'd. As more near My reckoning draws, does evil's inborn fount Within me more subside, and, paramount To the world's love, the love of God sincere Reign arbiter?—O, may each year, each day, By him vouchsaf'd, to him its tribute pour, And his free love with answering love repay: Worthless, alas! Yet such as may for store Of blessings giv'n meet gratitude display, Till the night come, and I can work no more! LI. CHILDHOOD TRAINED. As wrapt and hidden in the stone's embrace The future statue lies yet undefin'd; Till the nice chisel clears the form design'd, The trunk, the moving limbs, the speaking face Developes: so instruction's hand must trace The intellectual form, which lies inshrin'd Mid nature's rude materials; and the mind Invest with due proportion, strength, and grace. God to thy teaching delegates the art To form the future man: the care be thine, No shape unworthy from the marble start, Reptile or monster; but with just design Copy the heavenly model, and impart, As best thou canst, similitude divine. LII. THE CATECHIST. 'Twas a wise rule, which in the Church's face The Pastor bade collect his youthful fold, Instruct, examine, to their view uphold Their wants, their blessings, and their means of grace; And what their Christian creed; and how their race To run of Christian love. Such lessons told, Their elders listening round, to truth a hold Might give more sacred from the holy place, Mix'd with God's word and pray'r. And oft I've thought, If well the value of that pastoral scene, Where the good man with care paternal taught God's will, with cheering word and smile between, The Preacher's voice supplies, tho' haply fraught With eloquence and powerful reasoning keen. LIII. THE CATECHISM. That call not education, which decries God and his truth, content the seed to strew Of moral maxims, and the mind imbue With elements, which form the worldly wise. So call the training, which can duly prize Such lighter lore, but chiefly holds to view What God requires us to believe and do, And notes man's end, and shapes him for the skies. This praise be thine, that by the truth set free Thou still hast trod the right way and the best, City of God, my Mother! yea, of thee “Excellent things are said;” nor this the least, That thou thy children giv'st the path to see Of life, and lead'st them by their God's behest. LIV. PAROCHIAL INSTRUCTION. Seek we the parish school! I love to view The village group, as one large family, In seemly guise arrang'd: the sparkling eye To mark, and eager tone, to feeling true, Quick to embrace and utter learning new; The seed deep sown, in time to flourish high, Of virtuous deeds and social harmony; But chiefly how by pure religion's clue The mind is forward led. This gives a price To mental, moral, training. All beside Is doubtful good, perchance the source of vice And thoughts presumptuous. Knowledge oft with pride Puffs up the mind, and worldly lusts entice, Unless God's truth man's erring nature guide. LV. THE BAPTIZED ADULT. What God ordains, it fits not man to slight! Thy parents, doubtful of the power to save, Or heedless, kept thee from the cleansing wave. More wisely thou by God's appointed rite Resolv'st to arm thee for thy ghostly fight; By pray'r, with faith and penitence, to crave The heavenly grace; and thus the combat brave, Born of the Spirit, in the Saviour's might. Now thou art Christ's own soldier. Now thy foes Will haply more assail thee, as the fiend, When own'd of heav'n from Jordan's flood he rose, Thy Saviour tempted. O, with him to friend Beneath his banner march, whate'er oppose, Faithful: and conquest on thy steps attend! LVI. CONFIRMATION. Pledg'd was their faith in infancy: but now, When opening years the reasoning soul reveal, Before yon altar's rails behold them kneel, Ingenuous youths and maidens! There they bow The modest head, and there the early vow With words of solemn Confirmation seal, And on their brow the hand confirming feel Of Christ's high minister. O God, do Thou Save and defend thy children! Gracious Lord, Father, thy hand be o'er, thy Spirit's grace Be ever with them, and thy powerful Word Their light and leader!—Awful is the race Before them set, with toil and peril stor'd, And steep the path-way to behold thy face! LVII. THE LORD'S SUPPER. “Take, eat and drink, and thus remember me!” Remember thee! Alas, the mighty debt Of heavenly love that man should e'er forget! Ah! how can I my Lord and Saviour see, Reclining at the board, and on the tree Suspended! bow'd with agony, and yet Breathing sweet love for men against thee set, Thine enemies! and not remember Thee?— Duty most bounden, thus on thee to think, Thus, as thou biddest! Privilege divine, Pledge of thy boundless love, to eat and drink Thy body and blood beneath the bread and wine! O, ever thus, till worn-out nature sink, That duty, Lord, that privilege be mine! LVIII. THE WEDDING GARMENT. Spread is the table of the Lord, and there, Who will, may go and freely feast: but high, Bethink thee well! and full of dignity That table; nor befits it them to share, Whose hearts with malice swell, or pine with care For earthly toys, or grovel in the sty Of sensual pleasure, or God's truth decry, His name, his word dishonour! O, beware! Approach not rashly; but about thee throw The wedding garment, and present thee drest In faith, and love, and penitence; that so, The King, when he surveys each bridal guest, The appointed sign of fellowship may know, And welcome thee to that celestial feast. LIX. THE SCRUPULOUS CHRISTIAN. And wilt thou from Christ's table turn away?— True: if profanely, thoughtlessly, thou come, Well may'st thou shrink from God's chastising doom: But what, if God's command thou disobey, Self-will'd, self-led, injurious?—True: thy way Is mark'd by weakness, sin: yet there is room For such; for where's the just that may presume, Safe in unsullied righteousness, to stay?— Come then, with mind enlighten'd to perceive, Discern, and value, that most heavenly feast! Come, with repentant heart, resolv'd to leave The sins it feels and grieves for! Do thy best: And He, who calls thee, will thy wants relieve, Thy sins remit, and give thy conscience rest! LX. THE HUMBLE COMMUNICANT. “Why at Christ's Table dost thou bend thy knee? Is it before a wheaten God to show Will-worship rash, profane?”—Ah! deem not so: For not in form corporeal here is He, Who sits inthron'd aloft in majesty. Deem it a sign, with what devotion glow Our hearts for Him, who feeds us thus below; How worthy Christ, and how unworthy we! If there be yet a sign of love more meet For love divine sent forth our souls to heal, Such sign, O Lord, be ours! Prepar'd to eat Thy mystick feast, behold, we meekly kneel: O grant us, grant us, at thy mercy-seat The sense, our bodies show, our hearts may feel! LXI. THE POOR BLIND MAN. Dark were his eyes from childhood! Poor and blind He has travell'd on, till on his patient head Their gather'd frosts have fourscore winters shed: But still God's word he hears, and in his mind, What can he more? digests; nor fails to find Each day of rest the church-ward path unled, And share, whene'er dispens'd, the living bread, Pleas'd with God's bounty, to his rod resign'd. Blind though he be, deem him not wholly so, Who knows the way of heavenly truth to scan! A day perchance may come, when thou shalt throw Thoughts of regret on life's exhausted span, Ah, blest with sight in vain! and long to know The soul's enlightening of that poor blind man! LXII. THE HIGH FESTIVALS. 'Tis a benignant feeling, which delights In seasons mindful of events gone by, Dear as they past, and precious. But more high The sense, and holier, which the Church incites, To mark with festal days, and solemn rites, The annual course of God's great mystery, “The Word made flesh.” On that with piercing eye The angels gaze! On that the Church invites Her sons to linger! As thereon we muse, On each strange scene, or all, together wove A wondrous tissue, like the braided hues Which blest the Patriarch's sight, with eye above Uplifted, faith the dear memorials views, Signs of past mercy and enduring love! LXIII. THE SAINT'S DAY. Not that to them we pray, whose work is done; Not that through them, who ran their earthly race Frail like ourselves, tho' strong in heavenly grace, For aid we supplicate our race to run: Not for such cause the Church each sainted son Thankful commemorates; but as guides to trace More clear our passage to the appointed place, Proofs of the battle fought, the victory won. Lov'd names! Apostles in communion bright, The Martyrs' noble brotherhood, and they “Whose praise is in the Gospel!” But with might Divine or mediatorial to array Created beings—'twere to choose dark night To walk in, and reject the golden day! LXIV. DAILY PRAYERS. A law there was, such law our fathers knew, Believing God that he delights to dwell With his assembled Church! the parish bell Each morn and eve the gather'd people drew God's word to hear, their daily vows renew. Such law their offspring we have bid farewell. Contents us now each week's return to tell Our wants to God, and tender homage due. Is it, our hearts the world's allurements fill? That “itching ears” less wholesome food require? That love and piety have waxen chill?— Yet, when did zeal to loftier flights aspire?— But not most deeply flows the noisiest rill; Nor crackling thorns bespeak the steadiest fire. LXV. THE MORNING OFFERING. When nature wakes, and man awakes withal To taste the freshness of the new-born day, And feel himself alive; what debt to pay Should conscience prompt him? What, but first of all Before his own and nature's God to fall; Him, who has chas'd the gloom of night away, To thank; from Him, his being's only stay, To ask for succour?—Hear the morning call, Almighty Father! Hear, my Guard and Guide! Another day thou giv'st me to begin: Defend me in it for his sake who died Man's ransom! O, from foes without, within Protect me; rule my ways; and turn aside The shafts of danger and the snares of sin! LXVI. THE EVENING SACRIFICE. Canst thou thy body on thy bed compose, The resting place whence it no more may rise, Till the Archangel's trump unseal thine eyes, And call thee hence to judgment; canst thou close Those eyes with comfort, and in peace repose, Before thou lift thy voice, and to the skies Send up devotion's Evening Sacrifice, Sweet as the fumes which from the censer rose? Ere on thy thoughts oblivious slumber creep, Ere the still sleep can lull thy pillow'd head, To Him, whose eyelids slumber not, nor sleep, Commend thy spirit: that about thy bed His wings may shield thee, and his feathers keep, Sustain thee living, or receive thee dead! LXVII. FAMILY WORSHIP. Fair is the sight, by Israel's psalmist sung, Of those whom God hath in one household join'd, In peace, and unity, and love combin'd; Most fair, when all assemble, old and young, Parents and children; those who serve, among Those whom they serve; with social feelings kind Each to the other, and with knees inclin'd In patriarchal worship, heart and tongue. List to the Saviour's words! “Where two or three Meet in my name, there in the midst am I.” Believe, and welcome to thy family The gracious Guest; and by his blessing try, How much domestick bliss and amity Hang on domestick worship's hallowing tie! LXVIII. HOLY MATRIMONY. If there's a scene, which joy unmingled cheers, It is not, no, it is not when the bride And happy bridegroom meet, and side by side Before the altar stand; while mid the tears Of mother, sister, friends, the sire appears, To yield his child, his heart's delight and pride, To him she loves, uncertain how the tide Of life may ebb or flow!—But truce to fears And anxious bodings! Hark, the vow they plight Of mutual truth: and now the sacred priest Joins them with pray'r, and bids a blessing light From God upon them. Happy omens rest On love so pledg'd, and hallow'd by the rite Which God appointed and Christ's presence blest! LXIX. THE HONOURED WIFE. If “worship,” honour, (kindred terms I use, As us'd our fathers, for the self-same thought:) If worship man, by God's instruction taught, Pays to his brother man; shall he refuse Due share to her, whom his affections choose His home's, his heart's companion; if in aught Less worthy, yet perchance with feelings fraught Holier, more virtuous deeds, more generous views?— 'Tis her's to yield, the weaker vessel's sign, Obedience, reverence; to receive is her's, Love, comfort, honour 1 Pet. iii. 1. 5. 7. Eph. v. 22. 25. Col. iii. 18, 19.: made by God's design “Help meet for man Gen. i. 27. ii. 18.,” like man from God she bears His image, his similitude divine; Both taught of God, and both “salvation's heirs.” LXX. THE THANKFUL MOTHER. Yes, in thy chamber thou dost well to pray, And there to thank thy Refuge and Support, Who hath not cut thine own existence short, But adds to thine thy offspring's. Day by day, And night by night, thy praise in secret pay: But not the less in Salem's publick court, The house of God, his people's lov'd resort, (So bids the Church,) thy gratitude display! 'Twas thine the fruit of Eve's offence to feel, That she “in sorrow should her children bear:” 'Tis thine to taste, that He who smites can heal. Go then, like holy Mary! Go, repair To God's high temple; there devoutly kneel, There lift thy voice, and make thine offering there! LXXI. THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY. Is there a sight on earth, where God may throw His eyes, and gaze with heart's complacency?— Such sight is that, where her young family The virtuous mother trains, his praise to show In hymn or holy psalm, to whom they owe Life, health, and all things; while the father by Sits thrill'd with thoughts of silent ecstasy; Sweet thoughts, which none but pious parents know! This be thy garland, lady fair and good, That those, whom God hath given, thy blooming race To God thou lead'st!—With goodness unendued, What were the fairest form, the loveliest face? But dear to heaven, with heaven's own tints imbued, Is female beauty deck'd with Christian grace. LXXII. GOD'S JUDGMENTS DENOUNCED AGAINST SINNERS IN THE COMMINATION. No! deem it not the Church could e'er pursue Her sons, tho' mark'd by many a crimson spot, With pray'r or wish for evil! Deem it not She bids thee e'er such pray'r or wish renew! But well she knows that holy, just, and true Are God's commands and menaces; and what His word proclaims the wilful sinner's lot, She knows, and owns, and bids thee own it due. “Curs'd is the man who spurns Jehovah's will.” Doubt'st thou the sentence? Does it aught declare Which is not? aught which He shall not fulfil? Confess the truth: pray God his flock to spare: And, warn'd thyself, and heedful of the ill, Of sin, and sin's appointed doom, beware! LXXIII. IN A TIME OF COMMON SICKNESS. 'Twas not the day of Sabbath, when I past, Nor by the Church made holy: yet a dumb Lone stillness reign'd there for the week-day hum Of busy men, and every door was fast Where traffick wont to toil; and as I cast A sidelong glance on every hallow'd dome, Thither I saw the assembled people come, To pray the God of mercy!—'Tis the blast Of his displeasure hovering o'er their head, Which calls them thither. Hear their fervent pray'r, All Merciful! Bid thou the arm outspread Of the destroyer from his prey forbear; And may the Great Atoner from the dead Sever the living, and thy suppliants spare! On passing through a town in my diocese towards the end of August this year (1832), I was much affected by the solemnity of the appearance. All the shops were closed; the streets well-nigh deserted; and the church and other places of divine worship filled, in pursuance of an arrangement among the several ministers of religion for a day of fast and humiliation, on account of the Cholera, then raging in the town. The unexpected sight produced in me a solemn feeling, which vented itself as above. LXXIV. THE SICK MAN VISITED. “Peace to this house!”—Now, ere in languor lost The weary spirit from the task recoil Of self-research, or racking pain embroil The thoughts, and reason's gentle sway be crost; Welcome the holy man! What tho' he boast No potent charm the sting of death to foil, Relick, or magick word, or holy oil, Or image-bearing cross, or wafer host: Yet may his voice thy heart to faith incline, Love, patience, trust, repentance, and release From worldly cares; his hand confer the sign Of pardoning mercy; and his pray'r increase (God's steward he!) thy store of wealth divine, Support thee here, or send thee hence in peace! LXXV. THE SICK COMMUNICANT. Nor fail, as round the clouds of sickness steal, Perchance of death, again a willing guest To seek refreshment at the heavenly feast, Pledge of thy faith, and thy salvation's seal. Alas! that reckless of their spirit's weal Some should refrain till then; as if, imprest With sigil quaint, by cunning wizard blest, A spell were there the fainting soul to heal, Howe'er in Christ untutor'd. Wiser thou, As he commands, thy Christian race hast run; As he commands, renew'd thy plighted vow; And sought his glory, not content to shun His means of grace. His peace be with thee now, And hope presageful of thy Lord's “Well-done!” LXXVI. THE ABSOLVED SINNER. Think'st thou the Church, to give the sinner rest, Has dar'd assume a more than human sway?— What by her Lord's high will she justly may, She does. To ease the soul, its sin confest, Which humbly sues relief, her Lord's behest She names, his promis'd boon, the appointed way, The absolving words; nor fails of God to pray, To seal the sentence in his name exprest. Deems she that thus is purg'd the sinner's spot, If faithless, unrepentant; or to her Heaven's empery belongs?—Believe it not! Full well she knows, to pardon and to spare Is God's prerogative: well knows she, what The heaven-ward road, and what the passport there. LXXVII. THE SICK RESTORED. On thy dim eye, how many a cheerless day, And many a weary night, hath nature frown'd! Day was to thee as night: for sickness round Thy pillow clung, and darkness the glad ray Of light obscur'd. Now forth thou wendest gay With life renew'd: now teems the unwonted ground For thee with flowers of Eden; and each sound Is to thine ear a spring-time roundelay. Quaff from the air its musick! from the flower Its sweetness quaff! But fail not thanks to yield To Him who made them, and to thee the power Restores to taste their beauties! He repeal'd The impending sentence: he affliction's hour Has chang'd to joy: he smote and he has heal'd. LXXVIII. FRUITS OF SICKNESS. And wilt thou now that God hath rais'd thee up, The vows, the promises, thy conscience made, What time beneath God's chastening rod afraid Thou drank'st submissive of affliction's cup, Wilt thou in health perform? Or wilt thou stoop Again to sin, as if thou wouldst upbraid God for his kindness, all thy debt unpaid Of gratitude, foregone thy Christian hope, Thy tears, and pray'rs for pardon?—If misus'd God's grace, bethink thee lest thy end be worse Than thy beginning! Mercy's boon refus'd Shall fall in judgment on the soul perverse That slights the gift; and goodness long abus'd Convert the intended blessing to a curse. LXXIX. TIMELY PREPARATION. Who, when the pilot warns, would lose the tide By casting pebbles on the glassy sea? Who to weave garlands in the flowery lea Would far from home the waning hours abide? What racer from his course would turn aside To pick up apples from Hesperian tree? What soldier, striving for the mastery, Waste in Campanian sloth his manhood's pride? Christian, be wise! The tide is at its height, Which now may waft thee to the wish'd-for shore: Thy home's away, and swift the moments' flight: The goal, the crown's right on, thine eyes before: The trumpet calls to gird thee for the fight; Hark! now it sounds, but soon shall sound no more! LXXX. THE DEATH-BED. Full of deep learning is the bed of death! When this lov'd world is fading from the sense, And the soul feels the body's impotence; And things, which lurk'd disguis'd, self-love beneath, Take their own shape; and what remains of breath Is spent in pray'r, and sighs of penitence For life's misdoings; and the next step hence Leads to the demon's flames, or angel's wreath:— Who would not then the paths of sin disclaim?— Who would not then to God for mercy fly, And plead the bulwark of a Saviour's name?— O, on that name in health may I rely; On that my faith, by that my practice, frame; And live to Christ, that I in Christ may die! LXXXI. THE SUDDEN DEATH. He was an alien from the House of God! Admonish'd oft, his grief he oft exprest, And better things for time to come profest, For time to come he hoped for! yet untrod The church-ward path still left he, till the rod Smote him, what time amid the drunken feast His unnerv'd throat the unswallow'd morsel prest, And now he lies beneath the church yard sod! What's now his place, and whither he is gone, Who rashly dares pronounce? But who can hear His fate, nor breathe a wish that he had known To tread with reverence and holy fear God's courts, or ere before God's judgment throne The accusing Angel bade his soul appear? LXXXII. THE DYING CRIMINAL. His life was spent in sin, and, often owed, Was paid the law's just forfeit. But at last, Ere from the death-doom'd frame the spirit past, The outward marks of penitence he showed; With faith, 'twas said, with love, with transport glowed; Nor want there some, by whom he's surely class'd With God's elect in glory. Who would blast Hope's opening bud for him, the heavenward road Who seems e'en thus to seek?—Yet who may dare Pronounce him blest, for who can rightly weigh His faith and late repentance?—Leave him where God's word has left him. Thou meanwhile obey The calls of palpable duty; nor forbear Till night's approach the labour of the day! LXXXIII. THE OBEDIENT DISCIPLE. More sure we deem the obedient Christian's meed, Who near his end by duty's pathway draws! His the prompt zeal, to serve his Father's cause; The lowly heart, to feel and own its need; The faith, the Saviour's righteousness to plead, And use his means of grace; the love, his laws To keep; with hope, not heedless of the applause To heavenly thoughts and holy deeds decreed. Peace be to those, who on God's altar lay Their life's late gleanings, scant thro' lengthen'd crime, But glean'd in shame and sorrow? Happier they, Who sow to God in nature's genial prime; And to the harvest's Lord their fulness pay, The strength and glory of the golden time! LXXXIV. THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS. Wouldst thou the Christian's death triumphant die, Live thou the Christian's life!—To fight the fight Of God, supported by the Spirit's might, And in the Saviour's name; to fix the eye Fast on the prize, and strive for mastery; To keep the faith's rich jewel, whole and bright: Such aim accomplish'd was the heart's delight 2 Tim. iv. 6, 7. Of dying Paul: such aim be thine to try! So move thou duly on to reach the goal! So may God's Spirit with thine own attest Thy heavenly sonship, and his peace control Earth's anxious thoughts! So, meet to join the blest, His gentle breath shed comfort on thy soul, The pledge and earnest of eternal rest! LXXXV. THE PASSING BELL. That sound upon my ear falls heavily!— It is the passing bell, the deep slow toll Which speaks the transit of a deathless soul, Call'd from its mortal tenement to fly, And of the unseen world the secrets try. A few hours more, wrapt in its funeral stole, Death's winding sheet, that bell again shall knoll The body hence, in its long home to lie, Till the angel's trump arouse it. Do not say, 'Tis a vain sound, that passing spirit's sign! But warn'd, awhile thy heart withdraw away From this world's toys, to heavenly themes incline: And think, “The solemn knell, which sounds to-day A brother's fate, to-morrow may be mine!” LXXXVI. THE FUNERAL. I envy not the feelings which can send The breathless corpse to its sepulchral home, Heedless of Him who made it! Mid the gloom Of sorrows, which the widow'd bosom rend, 'Tis kind, 'tis comforting, 'tis wise to blend Earth, as it were, with heaven, whence thoughts may come Rous'd by God's word and pray'r; and from the tomb The heart to bliss unseen, unheard, ascend! God takes the spirit; to the ground we give The body, “earth to earth, and dust to dust!” But not, as they who have no hope, we grieve: Sure is the Christian's faith, and firm his trust, That they, who sleep in Christ, in Christ shall live, And waking join the assembly of the just. LXXXVII. THANKSGIVING FOR THE DEPARTED. This world abounds in misery and sin! Each has his share: and who, that on the days Yet future meditates with careful gaze, Can tell how much of ill, without, within, Waits him; or what of freedom he may win By death's kind stroke?—Then count it not dispraise, That when the Church her children's bodies lays In the still grave, meet theme of thanks therein She sees to God who claims them! Well she knows, That sins beset, that ambush'd sorrow tries, The flesh-encumber'd spirit: whither goes Each spirit hence, she dares not say; but wise And good is He, who mid impending woes Still notes his creatures with benignant eyes. LXXXVIII. HOPE FOR THE DEPARTED. To doom thy brother, from the flesh releas'd, Christian, befits thee not. 'Twill best behove The grace which “hopeth all things,” Christian love, To hope that each may in the Saviour rest. Degrees of hope are various: for the best Well may it rise to faith, but not above: For those, the worst in semblance,—who can prove God's mercy may not rank them with the blest? Yield then, in hope that he in Christ may sleep, To earth thy lifeless brother!—Whom most pure Thou deem'st, in mind his good example keep; Whom soil'd with sin, his sins avoid, abjure: So may'st thou sow in love, in transport reap, Thyself; and make thine own election sure! LXXXIX. CHRISTIAN UNITY. One God there is, who reigns above in light: One Lord on earth, for man incarnate made; One body form'd He by one Spirit's aid; Call'd to one hope by one baptismal rite, One holy bread to eat of, and to plight One common faith Eph. iv. 4–6. 1 Cor. x. 17.. Who name his name, he bade In concord live; and of his Father pray'd, Perfection's bond, all might in one unite John xvii. 20–23. Col. iii. 14.. God wills our union. Man, by passion driven, Turns to a sword the rod for healing sent. Lo, limb from limb the spouse of Christ is riven, His seamless coat by reckless hands is rent: As if the goodliest, loveliest gift of heaven, When most disfigur'd, were most excellent. XC. BEAUTY OF THE CHURCH. What fairer form, my Country's Church, than thine? “Glorious within, thy clothing of wrought gold Psalm xlv. 14.!” What tho', (for who his course on earth may hold, Nor aught betray of earthliness a sign?) A speck perchance of earthly origin May here and there by curious eyes be told, Dimming the brightness of thy raiment's fold; 'Tis of wrought gold from God's celestial mine, Of “glory and beauty Exod. xxviii. 40.”—Yes, thou'rt passing fair, My Country's Church!—To grace their royal Sire Full many a daughter stands: but few compare With thee for virtuous deeds and meet attire; Few to their King so pure an offering bear, Tried in the flame, and purified by fire. XCI. SAFETY IN THE CHURCH. Why should I e'er forsake thy dwelling, blest Of God; or whither from thy shelter move? Whate'er vouchsafement waits us from above To cheer, sustain, enlighten, is possest By thee, and thou to thine distributest: And sure I think, if tempted once to rove From thee, my foot would find, like Noah's dove, O'er the wide waters refuge none, nor rest. Grace is within thy precincts, holy Ark; Grace and salvation! And tho' gathering gloom Now and again with signs of presage dark O'erhang thee, mercy's beams the skreen illume; And faith on blackest clouds may brightest mark God's bow, the pledge of blessings yet to come. XCII. THE CHURCH'S WORTHIES. Might aught beside thy own inherent praise, Thy stores adopted from heaven's treasury, Mark'd with God's name and genuine imagery, Win the charm'd soul to pass her earthly days With thee, loved Mother! 'tis that she surveys In the long record of the times gone by, What sweet memorials of a grace from high, Shed on Thy Faithful Sons, her scroll displays. Hail, holy men! by whom of yore was fought, True to your Captain, to his Consort true, The Christian fight! The goal, your footsteps sought, Fain would I, following in your track, pursue; And fain my soul, her work of trial wrought, Would find the haven of her rest with you! XCIII. THE CHURCH'S PROTO-MARTYR, 1555. If life preserved for wife and children's sake, If bliss which none but husbands, fathers feel, If worldly woe escaped, and worldly weal Enjoy'd, lands, houses, goods, with all to take Captive the waverer, had had power to shake Thy firm resolve, and quench thy fervent zeal— Rogers, the Church had lost her earliest seal Stamp'd in thy heart's blood on the burning stake. But nobler thought was thine, and loftier scope, The Tempter's vile allurements to withstand Victorious: thine the Christian's deathless hope, The Christian's faith: and thus thy native land Salutes in thee her harvest's firstling crop, In thee the Stephen of her martyr'd band. XCIV. THE MARTYRED BISHOPS, 1555. “Take heart, my brother! for from yonder pile, Our deathbed and our sepulchre to day, A lamp shall spring, to light with quenchless ray The length and breadth of England's darkling isle!” So spake the mitred Martyr Latimer., as with smile Sedate, not reckless, he the hard affray Encounter'd, for the gain, thenceforth to pay His own life's loss, gladden'd his soul the while. Hold we such names in reverence, nor mis-deem That they for nought the oppressor's rage withstood! Still o'er the land, so God ordain'd it, stream The rays that issued from that blazing wood; And England hail'd, waked from her papal dream, Her Church's seed-time in her martyrs' blood. XCV. THE PRIMATE AT THE STAKE, 1556. Who that beholds his hand reluctant trace Words which the meek Confessor's Cranmer. thoughts disclaim, Drops not a tear of sorrow on the name, Consign'd by one sad act to dire disgrace? Who that beholds his willing hand embrace, Ah! not unworthy now! the scorching flame, Joys not to see that well-repented shame Cleansed from the patient sufferer's soiled face? Of those, my Country, who the pitying tear Drop for thy renovated Church's Sire, How many a heart, like his, had fail'd for fear! How few perchance had dared, like his, respire, To claim the meed of penitence sincere, And faith that mark'd unmoved the circling fire! XCVI. THE PRIMATE ON HIS DEATH-BED, 1604. “O, for the Church of God!”—As faint and rare The accents came from Whitgift's palsied tongue, While o'er his couch his royal Master King James I. hung The dying Primate's last behest to share; “O, for the Church of God!”—That livelong care, While vigorous health his frame and spirit strung, Still to his memory's fading tablet clung, Form'd his sole wish, and moved his parting prayer. Meet prayer to crown the work of him, who long Had sway'd of England's Church the pastoral rod! Meet prayer for all her sons! Or old or young, As on we journey by this mortal road, Be this our matins and our even-song, In life, in death, “O, for the Church of God!” XCVII. THE PRIMATE AT THE BLOCK, 1644. Beside the headsman's block and sharpen'd blade, Stands one, the first of England's hierarchy Abp. Laud.! By bonds and outrage bow'd, and penury, Degraded, trampled on, malign'd, betray'd, Full threescore years and twelve have now allay'd Somewhat the keenness of his eagle eye, But not the conscience pure, the spirit high, Submiss to God, but ne'er by man dismay'd. Speak not his name and title, lest they call From yonder rabble rout the infuriate yell! But his high rank, his virtues, and his fall By faction's lawless minions, ponder well; And think, the storm, that rent the Primate's pall, On kingly crown and hallow'd altar fell! XCVIII. THE PRIMATE DISINTERRED, 1648 When in the time of the Great Rebellion, Lambeth Palace came into the possession of Colonel Scot, he turned the chapel into a hall, demolished Archbishop Parker's monument, digged up his body, sold the lead that inclosed it, and buried the bones in a dunghill.. Shame on the regicide, who rent the tomb, Where thy remains, age-honour'd Parker, lay, Commingling fast with consecrated clay! Shame on the wretch profane, who dared presume To “burst the marble cearments;” to exhume Thy bones from holy earth and meet array; And like a potsherd, vilely cast away, To grave obscene the scatter'd fragments doom. What was thy crime? 'Twas that thy country owes, Revived, her rites apostolick to thee: The channel thou, through which transmissive flows The stream episcopal, from error free; Guard of the Church from innovating foes, And foster-father of her Liturgy! XCIX. BISHOP KEN'S MORNING AND EVENING HYMN. A holy pilgrim journey'd on his way: His fingers touch'd the lute's melodious string, And still his answering voice was carolling, “Awake, my soul, thy morning tribute pay.” And oft as evening spread her shadows grey, The lute and voice renew'd their communing, Nor fail'd that holy pilgrim aye to sing “Glory to Him, who made the night and day!” Ken, not a better, greater name than thine, With honour marks the Church's history. Who know thee, know thee strong in grace divine: But all applaud thy sacred minstrelsy; And village children, when their voices join In hymns of daily praise, still learn of thee. C. THE IMPRISONED BISHOPS, 1688. Seven holy men Archbishop Sancroft: the Bishops, Lloyd of St. Asaph, Turner of Ely, Lake of Chichester, Ken of Bath and Wells, White of Peterborough, Trelawney of Bristol. Of these, Sancroft, Turner, Lake, Ken, and White, afterwards refused to withdraw their allegiance from James II., and were deprived., loved Mother, of thine own, Superior one in honour as in age, Stood forth, despite a bigot tyrant's rage, Thy people's guardian 'gainst a despot's throne. Of those seven holy men, when freedom's frown Had chased that bigot tyrant from the stage, Five to his name held fast their plighted gage, And lost their mitres to maintain his crown! Angels “The seven stars are the angels of the seven Churches.”—Rev. i. 20. of Anglia's Church, stars “The seven stars are the angels of the seven Churches.” —Rev. i. 20. fair and bright, I greet you, in her crowded galaxy! 'Twas yours to suffer wrong; yours to requite Wrong meekly borne, with steadier loyalty; Nor dare abandon in his friendless flight, Whom in his pride of power ye dared defy! CI. THE PRIMATE DEPRIVED, 1692. Erewhile in lordly pride of place he sate, Unmatch'd in England's hierarchal chair; The long retinue, and the sumptuous fare, And mitre, pall, and crosier swell'd his state: Now scarce a menial at his lowly gate, The hermit's vestment, and the diet spare, And, stript of outward pomp, the lonely prayer, On the fall'n Patriarch's close retirement wait. The meed thou merit'st, Sancroft, freely have! Zealous, but mild, in thy prelatick sway: Amid the world's commotions meekly brave; Contented thence thou took'st thy private way, And left'st for record on thy rural grave, “Praise to the Lord, who gives and takes away!” CII. THE CHURCH'S PARISH MINISTERS. Still, as I turn thy monumental page, Loved Church, it binds affection's chords to see, Not less in virtue, though of less degree, Thy Worthies of the humble parsonage, Thy Hookers, Herberts, of a simpler age: How mid their charge, from worldly follies free, They “ate their bread in peace and privacy,” Rich in true wealth, in solid wisdom sage. Hark, as in thought I trace each hallow'd ground, Soft whispers greet me from the sainted dead: “Stewards of Christ, and on his service bound, To train his flock for heaven, we hither fled; Here sought our bliss; and here through mercy found, That bliss still harbour'd, where his service led. CIII. THE CHURCH'S PEOPLE. And well it likes me, in thy bygone days To see thy People's sober footsteps press, Leagued in one bond of peace and holiness, The path of penitence, and pray'r, and praise. Not theirs, with itching ear and curious gaze, To scan the chance way-farer's crude address, Less apt the spirit's wanderings to repress, Than fitful dreams and groundless raptures raise. But theirs, their pastor's teaching, line on line; God's word digested well; the mystick feast Full oft enjoy'd; each stated rite divine:— Thus Walton, Evelyn, Nelson, once were blest; Learn'd wisdom in communion none but thine, And in thy bosom found their Saviour's rest. CIV. GOD THE PRESERVER OF HIS CHURCH. A sound is in the trees and on the flood! The wind is up; it lift the waters high, As if to battle with the eternal sky, And from its roots to tear the ancient wood. But there is One, the Powerful and the Good, Who sits above the storm with wakeful eye, Prompt, if need be, with voice of sovereignty To speak, as once Tiberias' waves he strew'd With “Peace, be still!”—Yea, Lord, if aught of ill Thy Church assail, her griefs thy care engage; Safe stands she, founded on thy holy hill: Thou canst the tempest's fearful roar assuage, Tumultuous noise! and more tumultuous still, Lash'd into storm the maddening people's rage. CV. TO THE READER. Reader, if aught, these Musings brief comprise, May quell a judgment harsh, or wish unkind, For my lov'd Mother-Church; and in thy mind Bid thoughts more just, and kindlier feelings rise: Deem them not air-born baseless fantasies! Scan her by God's own word, and thou shalt find, The more thou scann'st, thy spirit more inclin'd Her name to venerate, her worth to prize. To thee the search a rich return may bear Of sacred lore, and aspirations raise Which the earth owns not: nor shalt thou not share The grateful sense, which, ah! too scantly, pays Blessings conferr'd with thanksgiving and pray'r, “Peace to our Sion, to our God be praise!” THE END.</field>
