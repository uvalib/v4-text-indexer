      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable HUMPHREY PARSONS Lord Mayor of the City of London A Congratulary POEM UPON His Lordship's Accession to the Chair Parve (nec invideo) sine me liber ibis in urbem: Hei mihi! quod Domino non licet ire tuo. Ovid. de Trist. To the Right Honourable HUMPHREY PARSONS, A Congratulary Poem. My Lord, SINCE Great Apollo, with his Harp in hand, Does on the Summit of Parnassus stand, Commanding e'ery Muse to sing or play A joyful Hymn, to this auspicious Day, And to salute you with their Pens and Tongues, As you in Triumph pass admiring Throngs; My fading Muse, with worldly Cares opprest, Craves leave to pay her Tribute with the rest, Hoping her Off'ring, like the Widow's Mite, May be receiv'd, tho many Grains too light, Since a poor trifling Present, kindly meant, With due Submission by the Donor sent, Augments its Value by his good Intent. Hail, worthy Elder, for the Publick born, An Honour to the Robe thou long ha'st worn; Thrice welcome, Sir, to the Prætorian-Chair, The Seat of Wisdom, Justice, and of Care, Where true unbiass'd Merit ought to shine, Such as the World must own is truly Thine, Ting'd with no Av'rice, no imperious Pride, No Party Malice tow'rds an erring Side, No secret Views against the Common-weal, No selfish Cunning cloth'd with outward Zeal, No servile Temper to become a Tool To those that wou'd Aspire, or those that Rule; But, maugre all the Schemes to gull the Town, None could e'er sully thy untarnish'd Gown, Lord of thy Self, thy Conduct is thy own. Nor can the fruitless Grins of Envy slur The Virtues that adorn your Character, Which, free from partial Heat or borrow'd Light, Shine of themselves conspicuously bright, Unvarnish'd by the poor deceitful Arts Of those obsequious Tools call'd Men of Parts, Who make a common Warehouse of their Wit, And dish out Praise as artful Cooks their Meat, With fulsome Elogies please e'ery Tast, Make wicked Statesmen Just, c?t Harlots Chast, Humour the Pride of those that bear the Sway, Obscure the Vices of the Rich and Gay, And gild the Follies of the Great for Pay. My barren Muse, tho' humble, cannot bend To Flatt'ry, she's too much your Lordship's Friend, She's past the frothy Vanities of Youth, And hopes to merit your Esteem by Truth, Tho' few, that great Authorities possess, Can even bear her Shade, her Substance less; Because, tho' beauteous, yet the Wicked find Her looks are dreadful to the guilty Mind, Distastful to unworthy Knaves and Fools, As Light is hateful to the Bats and Owls: But you, discerning Sir, whose daily Care Is still to cherish the celestial Fair, In all Debates, Astræa's Cause defend, And uncorrupted prove her constant Friend; With open Arms embrace her undisguis'd, When by the World rejected and despis'd; Bor'n down by erring Numbers, yet, we see, She has a faithful Advocate of Thee, Who, aw'd by neither Power, Time, or Place, Durst appear Honest, with an open Face, And do a Patriot's Duty with a comely Grace. Some restless Souls, impatient of Delay, Attempt to climb a short, but crooked Way, And labour, by ignoble Arts, to gain What blameless Worthies only should obtain: Men of strict Honour, who, in e'ery Choice, Have a just Title to the People's Voice; Tho', by false Polls and other Steps awry, They may i'th' Face of Justice be put Bye, And temporizing Sycophants be made The Guardians of that City-Princess, Trade; Such as would blindly run into Extremes, And boldly propagate destructive Schemes; Or be seduc'd to drudge away their Hours, In the dark Service of commanding Pow'rs, And wilfully suspend the timely Care Of civil Int'rest, from some C?t Affair, In whose alluring Projects always lie Such golden Baits, as tempt the Miser's Eye; A Wretch that does unbounded Wealth pursue, And is to nothing but Self-Int'rest true, In Practice, less a Christian, than a Jew. Others there are that love the Good Old Cause, From Pow'r excluded, by our wholsome Laws, Did not their tender Consciences comply With sacred Bonds, their very Souls dony; But no Reforming Saints e'er barr'd the Door, Against the sinful Lusts of Wealth and Pow'r; The strongest Fences are but weak and lame, That stand betwixt Authority and them; Vows, Oaths, and Sacraments, in such a Case, Are trivial Barriers to the Lambs of Grace; No thorny Bounds their Av'rice can impede, They'll creep thro' any Hedge for better Feed, But soon return, by second Nature led, To their old Pasture, where they first were bred. Thus, the known Enemies of Church and State, In spight of humane Laws, grow Rich and Great, Their private Ends to publick Good prefer, And safely leap o'er e'ery sacred Bar, Like wanton pamper'd Horses kick and snort, And make all legal Sepiments their sport; Climb Fortune's Wheel, by surreptitious Means, Deride the Church with pious Leers and Grins, And undisturb'd enjoy the Profit of their Sins. These are the crafty Sticklers, who, of late, Did, by false Polls, such civil Feuds create, And by bad Votes, and other Steps awry, Labour'd, in vain, to raise their Leaders high; Supporting their accustomary Wrongs, With joss'ling Elbows and reproachful Tongues; Till Your good Conduct baffl'd Party-Rage, And Thunder-struck the Phaeton's of the Age, Who, having lost their Honour, look'd shagreen, And fell a Prey to their own Party-Spleen; But, had the Motly-race secur'd the Prize, Wonders by this time had amaz'd our Eyes, And nothing heard, when their distemper'd Wits Had turn'd their foaming Zeal to godly Fits, But Reformation bellow'd thro' the Streets. At length, the losing Candidates, asham'd Of the successless Poll themselves had claim'd, Finding their noisy Numbers much too thin, Gave up the Game, they had no Pow'r to win; Leaving their envious Vot'ries to repair The Loss of Honour, 'twas a Pain to bear, Whilst others worthy of the People's Choice, Went off applauded with a gen'ral Voice. So, when the Jockey has fatigu'd his Horse, Whip'd, jossl'd, spur'd, rid-foul, but lost the Course, He sneaks away obscurely, damns the Plate, And leaves his Betting-friends to curse their Fate; Whilst he that wins the Prize, makes others glad, And quits the Field much honour'd and huzza'd. Rome, in the Books of Fame, long since, inrol'd, And by the learned World so much extol'd, Not only for her Schools and Men of Parts, But Wisdom, Justice, Valour, Arms, and Arts, And all the thriving Virtues that could raise A growing City, in those early Days, Took care to choose such Rulers as pursu'd No other Int'rest than the Publick-Good, Till she became, by her resistless Force, The Mistress of, almost, the Universe; Gave Laws, not only to her neigh b'ring Crowns, But distant Kingdoms trembl'd at her Frowns, Solicited her Friendship, at a Time, When Tyrants thought no Wickedness a Crime, But with their Armies, in unequal Fights, Subdu'd their Neighbours and usurp'd their Rights; In all such Cases, 'twas the Roman Pride To do strict Justice to the injur'd Side, And with her valiant Legions to chastise Invading Pow'rs, as publick Enemies; Till Riches, Plenty, Luxury and Pride, The Bane of Nations, when too long enjoy'd, Begot that Monster, Faction, by degrees, That restless Foe to Justice, Truth, and Peace, Who, to deceive the Publick and disguise Her sullen envious Looks from common Eves, Did with the Mask of Reformation skreen Her threat'ning Brows, too frightful to be seen; With this fair Vizard she seduc'd the Crowd, And made the Pop'lace insolent and proud, Inspir'd unletter'd Slaves with Self-conceit, And turn'd Obedience to rebellious Heat, Till the prime Leaders of the brainless Rout, Swarm'd in the Senate and kept Wisemen out, Encreas'd their Numbers by unlawful Means, And made a gainful Market of their Sins. Avarice, the Spawn of Faction, then began, And, like Infection, spread from Man to Man; Hence Brib'ry sprung, with her alluring Gold, And crept into the Palms of those that rul'd; Justice, O! ancient venerable Name, Tho' blind before, was now both Deaf and Lame, And daily rais'd her Price, from much to more, Till grown alas! too costly for the Poor; Honours and great Employments in the State, Rewards that did before on Virtue wait, Were now to Market sent, and e'ery Post Resign'd to Knaves or Fools that bid the most; Whilst Worthies only could dejected stand, And mourn their Country's Ruin, near at hand; Therefore, let other Nations look at home, And take due Warning by the Fate of Rome. Thus rising Empires, like a hopeful Child When young, prove vertuous, innocent, and mild; But if supinely govern'd in their prime, They grow debauch'd and wast their Strength in time; By their own Follies hasten on their Fate, And perish by Distempers they create: In short, the greatest Monarchies on Earth Must die, as surely as they once had Birth, Like human Bodies form'd of brittle Clay, They have their Rise, their Bloom, and their Decay, And like old Heroes, e're they quit the Stage, Their passive Tameness will their End presage. Thus, all imperious States, as well as Rome, When Party-clashing Zeal strikes Fire at home, Like blazing Stars will burn 'till they themselves consume. But, ancient Rome, in her exalted State, When rich in Vertue and in Power great, Tho' crouds of Worthies dwelt within her Walls, And gallant Legions muster'd at her Calls, Ne'er chose, with all her Vigilance and Care, A worthier Elder to the Prætor's Chair Than London, jealous of so high a Post, Can now with Safety to her Honour boast; A steddy Patriot, arm'd against reproach, Too Just for any factious Tongue to touch, Loyal and prudent to a high Degree, In converse, neither too reserv'd or free, To Church and King immoveably inclin'd, Gen'rous and affable to all Mankind, Titles, he covets not, has Wealth enough, Yet thinks a Blast of Honour but a Puff, And rather would be stil'd by all that write, A Master-Brewer, than a servile Knight, Such as, long since, by those that bore the Rule, Were only dub'd to be some Statesman's Tool, But now our grand Metropolis may boast A Ruler, more than equal to his Post, Whose upright Soul above Temptation soars, And artful Schemes for private Ends abhors; Nor harbours in his Veins one Drop of Blood, But what inclines his Heart to publick Good; No magisterial Pride or stern Grimace, Eclipse his Temper or disguise his Face, But his Deportment shews to publick Eyes, The Elder worthy, and the Patriot wise, Who with those City-honours is alone Content, without distinction from the Throne. Honour, in Notion, may refine the Blood, And make a proud Man Great instead of Good; But, when kind Providence has nobly join'd, A copious Fortune to a gen'rous Mind, They make the lib'ral Worthy truly bright, And often raise the 'Squire above the Knight, That courtly Blast which does the Lawyer please, And with the Doctor equally agrees, Giving to both a Title to excessive Fees. To you, my Lord, the City's worthy May'r, Whose Character brings Honour to the Chair, My humble Muse, on this Triumphal Day, Addresses what she further has to say; No Elder, e'er arriv'd with less Debate, Or more Applause, to your superior State; No factious Snakes their hissing Tongues employ, But all salute you with Excess of Joy, Knowing the People's Love and publick Praise Would prove too pow'rful for their rude Essays, And should they dare to give the least Offence, Would soon chastise 'em for their Insolence; None, in contempt of envious tugs and grins, E'er climb'd Authority by fairer means: Besides the Choice, that makes your Title good, You have a Right inherent in your Blood, And like successive Kings, may justly boast, That your good Father held the same high Post, And by his wise and steddy Conduct taught, Succeeding May'rs to Rule without a Fau't; If you wou'd govern well, from Error free, His Conduct must your great Example be, Place all his worthy Deeds before your Eye, Tread but his Steps, you cannot tread awry, Envy her self must sleep, when we declare, A worthier Elder never fill'd the Chair, And all her Brood be silent, when we praise So good a Man, in these ingrateful Days. Tho' fled to Heav'n, we scarce can think him gone, Since the World daily sees him in his Son, In whom we find and justly may admire, The active Soul and Virtues of the Sire, Be what he was, let nothing New intrude, Stand but the Ground your worthy Father stood, And as your Virtues do like his excel, The Church and all good Men will wish you well. No Elder, sure, was ever more belov'd, No May'r, so universally approv'd, No Magiftrate, less partial in a Cause, And none more worthy of the World's Applause, True to the Church, whose Interest you espouse, Mild with her Foes, as far as Heav'n allows, In e'ery Scheme, for publick Good design'd, Sincere and indefatigably Kind, Prideless and Generous, easy of Access, Forward to help the Needy in Distress, Quick in good Actions, but to Anger slow, A faithful Friend and a forgiving Foe. Now, to her comfort, may the City see, She has a Father, and Lord-May'r in Thee; No avaritious Hunx, no party Tool, But one that will Defend as well as Rule, And all impair'd Advantages restore, To Widows, Orphans, and the lesser Poor; No servile Muckworm, treach'rous to his Trust, That labours to be Rich, instead of Just, Whose glow-worm Merits do the Nation hurt, And shine the brightest in the blackest Dirt, Like Touch-wood in the Dark deceive the Sight, But lose their Lustre in a genuine Light, What! tho' their publick Speeches may be fine, And do good Service in a bad Design, Their greatest Virtues are but Foils to thine. Forgive my Muse, Monition may be thought A daring Freedom, even to a Fau't; But Poets claim a Parentage divine, As Sons of great Apollo and the Nine; Not Wealth but Wisdom of their God they seek, And with a Prophet's Boldness ought to speak. No graceful Member of the scarlet Court, Can with a nobler Mien himself deport, In all Debates, your steddy Mind is shew'd; None more tenacious of the Common-Good; Too firmly fix'd to be seduc'd or aw'd; Belov'd at Home, and Honour'd much Abroad; Wealthy and Wise, impregnably secure, Against the golden Baits or Storms of Pow'r; Bless'd with a Lady, whose indulgent Care, Makes you as happy, as her self is fair, Whose lovely Off-spring crowns your nuptial Joys, And shews that Heav'n approves your prudent Choice, With whom kind Nature has vouchsaf'd to trust The brighest Graces Flesh and Blood can boast; A Lady, by the judging World allow'd To be divinely Good, and never proud, Pious, Obsequious, charitably Free, And all that a religious Wife can be, Whose awful Presence makes her Seat a Throne, And stirs up Rev'rence in the Lookers-on, Such Heav'nly Gifts to Youth and Beauty join'd, All wisely govern'd by a virtuous Mind, Shining with those good Qualities you bear, Like Jems adorn your magisterial Chair, The groundless Envy of the World defeat, And make your nuptial Happiness compleat. When mighty Men court popular Esteem, The World admires their Equipage, not Them; But when, my Lord, your honour'd 'Spouse and You Appear, tho' not in Pomp, to publick View, The People's Hearts with Gratitude are fill'd, And joyful Transports make 'em raving wild, In loud Huzza's, they publish your Renown, And with their vocal Thunder shake the Town; Whilst Envy, trembling at your near approach, Sinks down in Fitts, and groans beneath your Coach. Shou'd pow'rful Bacchus from his Throne descend, And visit England as a toaping Friend, Where all the modern Bottle-Race incline To genuine Malt, instead of morbid Wine, With your rich Amber would he oil his Chaps, And for the Barly-mow, renounce his Grapes, Confess his Tuns, wherein he stows his Wine, To be but Runlets, if compar'd to thine, Bow down his proud Divinity to Thee, And own your Lordship more a God than He; Or should he, now his fruitful Vines are press'd, His Vats replenish'd and his Slaves at rest, Upon a Malmsey-Butt, through London ride, Guarded by Vintners, in their Liv'ry-Pride, The God, amidst his Bacchanals must halt, Beg Pardon for his bold presumptious Fault, And wave his Crown of Grapes, to you great King of Malt. For Wines of foreign Growth, as Doctor'd here, Are but meer Wash to your salubrious Beer, Th' enliv'ning Products of your artful Trade, By canvass Wings to distant Worlds convey'd, Not only quench the Drought but chear the Heart, And to the languid Wretch new Life impart. Both Indies, bless'd by Thee, prolong their Days, And o'er thy smiling Amber, sing thy Praise: Amber! That Extract, which admits no Fraud, That Cordial Julep to our Friends abroad, Which gives more Vigour than the Food they eat, And oils their shrivel'd Intrails parch'd with Heat. Nor, do thy mant'ling Liquors only cool, The scorch'd Dominions of the Great Mogul, And yield to droughty Regions near the Line, A sweet Resreshment far surpassing Wine; But warm the shiv'ring Russians, chear their Souls, And thaw the frozen Slaves beneath the Poles, Foment their torpid Muscles, and remove The Numbness that impedes their nuptial Love, Fit the kind Husband for his Wife's embrace, And prompt him to beget a hardy Race: Thus, like the Satyr's breath, renown'd of old, Thy noble Juice, to foreign Nations sold, Imparts to diff'rent Climes both Heat and cold. In Children, Health and Wealth may you abound, And your own Virtues in your Brood be found, So blended, that in them we may review The Graces that adorn your Spouse and You, Such, ornamental Blessings as, of late, Are seldom cherish'd by the Rich and Great, And in this jarring Nation, to her Shame, Have lost their Being and almost their Name: Who then, your timely Conduct can arraign? In sending forth your Darlings cross the Main, That, whilst they're train'd in so refin'd a Place, Where Faction fears to shew her ugly Face, They may imbibe, from all Corruption free, Sound Principles of Truth and Loyalty, Such as their worthy Parents, to their Praise, Early imbib'd and stedfastly profess. May Jove conduct you, with celestial Care, Thro' all the Windings of each grand Affair, That, with due Caution, you may tread secure, In the dark Lab'rinth's and Fatigues of Pow'r, Till you resign the Sword with no less Fame Than your unsully'd Hands receiv'd the same: May your well-guided Life appear no less Than one continu'd Series of Success, Bless'd with such Reputation as no Tongue Can tarnish, or inviduous Faction wrong, But that the World, in this nefarious Age, When present Mischief future Ills presage, In you, with joyful Wonder, may behold A Magistrate above the Reach of Gold, Sincerely Honest, and as justly Bold. May Heav'n your Lady's happy Days prolong And keep her always fruitful, fair, and young, That, 'midst her Charms, she may reserv'dly shin Like Pits's Diamond, but be ever thine. May all your hopeful blooming Issue prove, Obedient Pledges of your nuptial Love, Flourish like Blossoms of the Palm, now young, And grace the worthy Stock from whence they sprung, Encrease in Virtue, as they rise in Years, Till their inherent Merits make 'em Heirs, Not only to your Wealth, but Characters. Long may their Mother and her Lord the May'r, Survive the short-liv'd Honours of the Chair, And when their Father shall resign the Sword To other Hands, and be no more my Lord, May he with Pleasure to his Seat retire, And change the Style of Lordship into 'Squire, There, with his Lady live, amidst his Store, Lov'd and much more Honour'd than before, Check alike prosper, from Misfortunes free, And mutual Love their endless Comfort be, Till They, bless'd Husband and the best of Wives, With whom indearing Concord dwells and thrives, Reform the marry'd World by their exemplar Lives. More would I say, but 'tis my Muse's Fate, To prove unequal to a Theme so great; At least, she's caution'd or restrain'd by Fear, That Truth should tempt her to approach too near, And make her vainly labour to rehearse, Virtues, too lofty for her barren Verse, Such as sit brooding in your loyal Breast, And shine in friendly Conversation best. Pardon, my Lord, the freedom of my Muse, Own she's bold, but hopes for your excuse; Let Criticks snarl, the Characters are true, The World I value not, but you I do, What! if my Muse distasts the rhyming Croud The subjects noble, that must be allow'd, Your Virtues make the dull Performance shine, Tis you that give a Lustre to each line, And tho' such Wits as wou'd be thought supreme Who claim a Title to the World's Esteem, May damn the Poem, they must praise the Theme.</field>
