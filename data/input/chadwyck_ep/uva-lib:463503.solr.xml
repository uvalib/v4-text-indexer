      <field name="fulltext">GOD and MAMMON, A Poem. Thou whom I doe desire to serve and fear, Although the flesh, the spirit over-bear, Assist my purpose, and inspire my minde, That for to urge thy glory is inclin'd. Since some that wittie are onely in ill Incited by the Fiend, have dipt their quil in gall of Asps, reviling those that be Zealous both for their Countrey and for Thee: How are the good then bound to vindicate Their Countreys lovers, damne degenerate? And thou of whom vain Aulicus doth tell Thy borrowed name, saying thou dost not spell As't ought to be, let him, and all the frie Read this thy praise, whom thus I justifie. If in few words, great substance to include, If to exclaime without words base and rude If neatly so to pull a visard from An Hyocrite, he may still think it on, Or if a subject poor, of it selfe base, With phrases eloquent to adorne and grace; Or in a sweet Satyrick vain to lash, Better then ere flow'd from the quill of Nash. Those worthy of reproof, or if to show The people each week what they ought to know. Be worthy honour then BRITANICUS, Thou wilt be hudg'd by all ingenious, Whose sharpened pen hath pierc'd the enemy As deep as the pikes of our Calvarie: Whose fluent lines have done the State more good, Then if that twenty thousand men had stood In Armes, and for them fought, against all those Who have inspir'd by Satan, basely chose, To fight against themselves, and to bring on The dire effect of their confusion. Children of Belial, ô Degenerate, Whom your posterity will justly hate: They'l say, Had all been of our fathers minde We should not these great priviledges finde: The Lordly Tyrants, Bishops, I should say, Would still have, triumpht ore us, and bore sway Who while they thousands, yeerly vainly spent, Another Pastor let live one the rent, Of ten pounds yeerly, while his wife and hee Oft made their meal, Let none think that this is spoken of malice, but rather let them and all true hearts reioyce: we are free from the bondage of those persecuting Prelats, during whose tyrannicall government; divers painfull and orthodox Ministers, were through extreme want ready to perish. of Berries on the tree, And did rejoyce, thinking they well did fare If a sheeps entrails, fell unto their share, While my good Lord stretching him on his bed Could scarcely breath, cause dainties, erst he fed And gorg'd too much on, we had still been slaves To those spruce Lawyers, who unto the graves Send many a wealthy man in homely guize Cause ore his purse, while they did tyrannize Some seven yeers space, while he about some brawle Because his Neighbours Dog, pass'd by his stall Would prosecute. They leave him nought but care Which with him, in the earths wombe buried are Under an Arbitrary Government: We now our weary lives had moning spent. Therefore all honour, laud and prayse be given Unto those worthy Patriots, who from Heaven Inspir'd, the Sword defensive draw, and make Gods enemies, and his Anointeds quake: Which he will finde I hope, and cleerly see, When the eys of his mind opened be. In the mean time, forbear, you foul-mouth'd crew, Your venemous poyson, any more to spew, Which doth infect the ayre, against whose good Who onely of true zeal, would spill your bloud, And sacrifice your lives, rather then see, Gods worship mingled with impurity, No marvell such a deep discent there is Twixt you and us, for those that live amisse, “Cannot eudure but to the death, do hate “Or those that to Gods word, their minds elevate, Nor can we you abide I mean your sin The which you do affect, and wallow in Nor care we for commerce with such as you In heavenly merchandize, though we cann't eschew Your fellowship in matters of our trade Unlesse we were as the immortall made, God Mammon and the great Jehovah cann't be serv'd At once, he that would do it, still hath swerv'd Or what, or where, he was, could scarcely tell Untill alas he found himself in Hell Me thinks the wondrous hand, of God so plain And so perspicuous, should make you refrain, Do you not see where ere our Armies goe They break and rout the forces of the foe, Led by that valiant worthy whose great Name Shall equall Cæsars, in renowned fame: And his great Acts fighting Gods battails shall Be sung in lofty verse Heroicall, By some great Poet; of more In spirituall knowledge. knowledge tho, Then that Homer. Meonian, sung Troys overthrow: Yee Muses Sonnes who have drunk of that well, Where the thrice three sacred inspirers dwell, That were a taske, a subject of great worth, Fairfax renowned acts to blazon forth, Who veni, vidi, vici still hath said, And I hope will, till all Gods foes dismaid, Or else cut off, not one surviving live, God to oppose, and those that for him strive. But shall those wicked Machinators be Pardoned, that were horrid immunitie? Shall those that have with sugered sayings led A gentle Prince from State, and fostered That dam'd unknown designe of bringing in The power abhor'd, of that same man of sin? Shall they that have occasioned the death, And with your own hands some have reft the breath Of many of Gods Saints that for him stood, And for to buy his glory sold their bloud; That have this flowry Mead, this glorious Isle Made drunk with her own native bloud the while: Her surface lies untild, those stately Towers Which erst adorn'd her, now turn'd into bowers Of trees, under whose shade the Deer do play Shall these after these mischiefe wrought I say Be tane to favour and admitted be For to enjoy the same tranquility That erst they did, before the bloudy minde Forc'd them to action, be not you inclin'd, You sacred Senate, Englands Patriots and The props that stay up this declining Land: Let them not taste of mercie I implore, Your Worthy Selves, but as they heretofore, Made others under heavie preasures rore So let those Adonibezeks feel the smart Which cruell they to others did impart, So shall you crown with justice your great deeds, And good which to set down my skill exceeds. 'Twould be a taske for Solon, were that Sage On earth to walke in divine equipage, With Homers muse to sing to after times Your Nobles deeds for us in learned rimes, Could Satan and his agents utmost might Have daunted you, what an Egyptian night, what darknesse to be felt, had we sustain'd, The The Pope. Triple Crown of late by Austria maim'd: Had plaid Rex ore us and the Gospel sweet Of Jesus Christ been trodden under feet, O that my might, were equall to my will That quickning Numbers flowing from my quill, I might lay ope to all, the thank they ow To you their Patriots, whence the good doth flow, The ancient Romans, severall crowns did give To those that for their countries, safety strove As some of Bay and some of Myrtle true But all of them belong to each of you Your names inscrib'd, on the bed-role of fame; Ages to come when mentioning the same, Shall with Pythagoras opinion were Authentick, and their souls their flesh might beare Unto eternity, that so they might As well as we enjoy the subjects right. O you that are averse to your own good, That 'gainst your The Comwealth. mother opposite have stood, Your fact and sin, in it is wondrous great, I wish you may repent, and grace intreat. Great God whose hand, immediat hand hath wrought By whom and through whom onely we have brought Our foes to crouch, to those that honour thee And hast fulfilld, the sacred prophecie That the unjust, unto the good shall stoop; And though that for a time the righteous droop Thou wilt not fail, nor mercy wilt with-hold This we have found, and other manifold Infinite favours, we thee pray go on Finish the work, thou hast so well begun That all the Nations of the earth may know By thee alone we great and good do grow As in England, so in Ireland make Those that walk contrary to feare and quake Those bloudy barbarous rebels make to fall By those that hate their ways Atheisticall, Papisticall I mean, but now let all Make use of this heare all in generall They that doth not set helping hand Perdie For to subdue Gods foes, Gods curse will lie On their curst selves, and their posterity. The time is come I hope, we shall behold Christ being sheepherd, onely one sheepfold That we unanimously may enter in The place of glory where joys, aye begin. People of England, lift their hands on high, And thank the great All-seeing Majesty That hath given vigour to our armies so That they few foes have left to overthrow That not the twentieth man survives to fight Against Gods cause, that those were opposite, And have occasioned, these bloudy wars Have wrought, their own orethrow by their own jars: But be not you elated, nor this say By our own strength, we have wrought our foes decay, But rather thus, the power for whom we fought Our own, hands ayding, hath to ruine brought Our enemies, then let's be undismaid, Sing Panegyricks, unto him doth aide Those that trust in him, they that him oppose Cause their own ruine, and themselves do lose.
