Hester I would not plead the Cause of Shame, Confounding Good and Ill, For Virtue dearly earns her fame And let her keep it still; But let her Friends some Pity feel, For her repenting Foes; Their Crimes forgive, their Sufferings heal, And listen to their Woes. Throughout the fiercest Summer Day, Through Winter cold &amp; keen, Was Hester in her wonted Way, And constant Habit seen, An humble Vagrant in her Round By various Fortune tried; Thankful for every Good she found, And patient if denied. 'Twas when she reached a lordly Hall, She found a Place of Rest, There she obeyed the friendly Call And was a chearful Guest; For there she saw an ample fire In ceaseless Splendour glow, The Flagon fitted to inspire The Spirits dull and slow, With all that Age and Care require Or Plenty can bestow. One Day the wild and wintry Sleet Flew freezing through the Air, When Hester reached the favorite Seat And blest the Bounty there. While all without was dread &amp; Dearth, And mournful every Sound, Huge Logs laid blazing on the Hearth, And Maidens sang around. “Come, Hester, tell us who thou art,” The merry Damsels cried, “Did ever Swain possess that Heart “Or saw thee blush, a Bride? “Or hast thou laught at Cupid's Dart “And all his Skill defied?— “Come now, the Men are all Apart, “Thy Tale in us confide.” “Then shut the Door and I will give “The Story you request, “Let me, dear Girls, your Warning live, “Although I live your Jest; “Still may you laugh at Care and me, “And when you shall approve “A gay and handsome Lad, may he “Not laugh at you and Love. “Will you believe, when you survey “This Sorrow-stricken Face, “That there the Loves were wont to play “With every sportive Grace, “Till Folly drove them all Away “And Grief usurped their place? “And now you see this Garb that hides “A Vagrant old and lame, “You well may doubt the costly Pride “That florished on this Frame, “The splendid Trappings Wealth supplied “To soothe resisting Shame. “Upon an heathy Mountain stood “My Father's decent Shed; “Beneath, a deep and winding flood “Ran softly in its Bed, “A Wide and venerable Wood, “Behind was proudly spread. “A Castle, frowning to the North, “A youthful peer possessed, “Who loved, of all his various Worth, “His Hounds and Horses best: “And when he took that princely Sport, “Which he so keenly sought, “He cared not what was done at Court, “Nor what at Home was thought. “My Father's Duty was to chace “The Poacher from his Prey, “The Robber's timid Step to trace, “And watch him on his Way; “Both kind and just, He took his time “All Cruelty to shun, “He rather would prevent a Crime “Than punish it when done. “And when with Over-wearied Powers “He sought his Home for Rest, “'Twas my Delight to soothe these hours, “And his to see me blest.— “I then was innocent and fair, “And fearful as the Hind, “Who, frightened, rushes from the Lair, “And startles at the Wind; “Who looks with wild and timid Air, “And trembles at Mankind. “Oft gazed I at that Castle's Walls, “A proud and gorgeous Sight, “While Fancy ran through Bowers &amp; Halls “In fearful, fond Delight: “She saw within that noble Place “What lovely Beings live, “And gave to some the glow &amp; and Grace “That Nature would not give. “It was a lively waking Dream “As ever Maiden moved; “To think how gay, how blest they seemed, “And how they lived and loved. “There was a Lad who loved me well, “A Shepherd down the Dale, “Who with the Tale that Shepherds tell “Told yet another Tale. “‘I love’, he said, ‘my blooming Maid.’ “Right gentle was his Voice, “It made me joyful, yet afraid “'Twas dangerous to rejoice. “But who would leave so kind a Lad, “So sweet an Home as mine, “With all that's costly to be clad, “With all that's proud to shine? “When first I knew a thought so ill, “I trembled as it came; “I wept, and said: ‘'Tis not my Will.’ “And yet it was my Shame. “Alas, when oft returns the Thought, “There is a Cause of doubt “That, if the Tempter be not sought, “He's not with Care shut out. “Trembling, at first we look at Vice “To dread her and dispise, “But when we view her Aspect twice, “With our Contempt arise “Some curious thoughts, and looking thrice, “The Guardian Terror flies. “Till often venturing on the View “(Our Apprehendsion gone), “A Train of Pleasures ever new “Comes sweetly smiling on. “Still, as we gaze, they bolder grow “And fresh Enchantment bring, “Till we relent and long to know, “From whence such Wonders spring. “A Countess at the Castle reigned, “The Mother of my Lord, “She saw me from her Coach and deigned “To speak the noble Word: “‘Say who art thou, my rosy Maid?’, “‘I'm Hester of the Hill’, “‘Then come and dwell with me’, she said, “‘We'll raise thee higher still. “‘About my Person thou shalt be, “‘For rustic though thou art, “‘Thy speaking Eye is Proof to me, “‘That Glory swells thy Heart.’ “I will not speak my Father's Fears, “When first my Home I fled, “Nor tell how many tender Tears, “Our mutual Sorrows shed; “But could I all our Grief express, “I never could relate, “My anxious Lover's fond Distress, “Prophetic of my Fate. “Yet ‘Hear me, William’, oft I cried, “‘Be sure my heart is true; “‘If I could be the Baron's Bride, “‘I'd not be false to you; “‘If I be by your Rivals tried, “‘In vain shall they persue; “‘Then fear me not, be satisfied, “‘And calmly say Adieu.’ “I went and seeing, hated All, “The people and the place. “The Manners of the Servants' Hall, “Were profligate and base, “The Women, I could justly call “A vain, a forward Race, “Who never seemed to think a Fall “From Decency, Disgrace. “The Men indeed were trim and smart, “And civil in their Way, “But all were profligate at heart, “And insolently gay; “Then O! what Freedoms did they take, “Which I must not describe, “And when I trembled for their sake, “How laught the wanton Tribe. “‘O! let me to my Home’, I cried, “‘My Father needs my Aid.’ “‘We want you here’, they all replied, “And mocked me as I prayed; “‘Your manners all offend my Mind.’, “‘We'll teach you to approve.’; “‘Disgust for all around I find.’ “‘Then stay and learn to love.’ “Thus was I like the tender Boy, “Compelled at School to stay, “Where all his Fellows' noisy Joy “Increases his Dismay; “He never dreams the Time will come “When he will join their Play, “Forget his dear, his pleasant Home, “And be as loud as they. “But rather counts with anxious Mind “The Days of his distress, “And wonders, as he counts, to find “His Sorrows growing Less; “He then begins to hide the Tears, “His bolder Friends reprove, “While Pleasures, suited to his Years, “His yielding Spirit move; “Till like his Fellows he appears, “And shares the Sports they love. “Thus in my Mind there daily grew “A Shame in judging right; “No more the peaceful, pure &amp; true “Were precious in my Sight, “At length I could with Patience View “The gay, the vain Delight, “And What I dreaded to persue, “Would yet the wish excite. “Nor yet the Master-Foe drew near, “Who was my Soul to win, “My humble Lover yet was dear, “And Change I held a Sin, “But still the customs of the Day, “The Song, the Dance, the Jest, “Put half my prudent Thoughts away “And weakened all the rest. “My Father saw the growing Ill, “And often said: ‘Beware’, “But ah! I felt the Fowler's Skill “And fluttered in the Snare: “The best Advice was lent too late, “The Heart was gone astray, “It led me to bewail my Fate, “But not to find my Way. “My Lover, too, presumed to teach, “And angry Words he chose, “But still the more I felt his speech, “The more my Spirit rose, “‘Thou hast not yet an husband's Right, “‘Nor is it now thy Time “‘To bar my innocent Delight ““Or call my Joy my Crime.’ “He urged me when the Countess died: “‘Come now, my Love, Away.’ “I tried, but ah! reluctant tried, “And feigned and forced Delay: “There tempted me on every Side “The kind, the free, the gay, “And One whom, though I yet denied, “I feared I must obey. “I know we love to give at length “The Causes of our Fall, “To paint the Passions in their Strength “And show our Reasons all: “But let me undisguised confess “The Weakness of my Mind, “And only plead his fond Address, “Who won me to be kind. “I sometimes met my Shepherd Boy “At Evening on the Lea, “Who jealous in his frantic Joy “Or sullen Grief would be— “Nor was he like a lively Lad, “Drest ever trim and gay, “His meagre Frame was poorly clad, “For little was his pay. “The jealous humours that he had “He fear'd not to display, “And when he sighed till I was sad, “He whirled himself Away. “My Lord was youthful, handsome, tall, “In dress a very King, “And when he clasped my Waste so small, “How jocund would he sing, “What Names he would his Hester call, “What Presents would he bring, “All richly wrought, delicious all, “And smelling like the spring. “Nor was he jealous, though he knew “I met a favourite Youth, “But promised him his Favour, too, “And trusted to my Truth; “He gave my Father noble Praise, “And bade me choose his Place, “And promised me the power to raise “The poorest of my Race. “How soon succeeded all my Crime— “Ah! never may you know “To what strange height in little Time “Our evil Passions grow: “As soon as we begin to fear, “And pause upon our Fate, “The Tempter draws unheeded near “And closes the Debate. “No more a Servant, I had now “The Castle at command; “My Lord himself would humbly bow, “And, smiling, kiss my Hand, “His Friends were happy to obey “A Nymph so fair and kind, “Except the Priest, who came to pray, “And he was growing blind. “I sought my Father now to please, “And shew a duteous part, “I sought my Shepherd's Life to ease, “Though not to ease his heart; “I sent with Speed to call them both, “My Love and power to show, “But flying, they had sworn an Oath “Nor Power nor Love to know. “That never would they see again “The Home they loved so well, “But, trusting to the tretcherous Main, “In Deaths and Dangers dwell; “And true they swore, they fought, they bled, “The Tidings came to land, “And many a Night beside my bed, “I saw the Spectres stand. “I felt the Grief, and for a time “Apart, in Sorrow, dwelt, “I felt the Curses of my Crime, “And trembled as I felt; “But Prudence whisper'd me the fear, “And taught me to reflect, “That Beauty, to my Lord so dear, “'Twas dangerous to neglect. “Then every day with something new “He bade my Grief retire, “I'd ever Pleasures to persue “And Treasures to admire. “These all possesst such magic Power, “And all came on so fast, “That Prudence never found an Hour “To question,—‘Will they last?’ “If Ever thought my Conscience led “My Conduct to condemn, “I looked among my Friends and read “Approving Looks in them; “With us were gentle Pairs whom Law “Had linked in Wedded Love, “These all our pleasant Errors saw, “But cared not to reprove. “‘A King’, they said, ‘his Nymphs may gain, “‘And to his Court may bring, “‘And sure my Lord in his Domain “‘Is great as any King.’ “All through the Village, as I went, “I saw Respect profound; “No croaking Voice proclaimed: ‘Repent!’ “In all the Country round; “I freely gave, I largely spent, “And was with Honour crowned. “There was a poet, and his fame “Was at the Castle known, “He surely ought to share my Shame, “Who never felt his own, “He oftimes said in Flattery base “(his poor and venal part) “On Earth was not so fair a face, “Nor yet so pure an heart. “You smile, and so did I, but mine “Were smiles that round me shed, “So vowed my Guests, a Light divine, “Ah! Light how quickly fled— “One Night my Lord, inflam'd with Wine, “Laid feverish on his bed, “Another saw our Hopes decline; “A third, and Hope was dead. “And now I soon began to learn “How well those wedded Pairs, “Could at convenient time discern “Between my State &amp; theirs. “They spake not once of Crime, but oft “Of generous Passions told, “And Hearts were praised for being soft, “And odious were the cold; “But now they sternly bad me think “What Wantons ought to do— “And hinted, ‘Who at Guilt will wink, “‘Will be partaker, too.’ “These Virtuous from me sternly stript “The Baubles Passion lent, “Then from her Seat the Harlot whipt, “Nor woo'd her to repent; “But Vice received with open Arms “Her long expected Prey, “And flattered all the fatal Charms, “That could for Flattery pay. “The Idol of the Day I grew, “Whom Folly hailed divine, “And Vot'ries, to their Worship true, “Hung Riches on my Shrine. “These, when the giddy Crowd forsook “The Pageant Fashion made, “The Priestess of the Temple took, “The Profits of her Trade. “Then first I felt the odious Task “My roving Prey to chace, “The Terrors of my Mind to mask, “And mend a fading Face; “Then first with the seducing Cup “I tried to steel my Breast, “To keep expiring Courage up, “And lull Dispair to rest. “As swims a Bird in the Decoy, “Her Fate not yet in Sight, “Whom Tyrants covet to destroy, “Whom Dogs allure and fright, “With whom Seducers float along, “The Net above them seen, “Beneath, a Currant deep and strong, “And guarded all between. “Thus half Deceit &amp; half consent, “The Stranger Bird swims on, “Nor fully sees the dire Intent “Till every Hope is gone. “So Men our timid Sex decoy, “So lure to live in Vice, “Whom Tyrants covet to distroy, “Whom frail Allies intice; “Virtue herself and Scandal armed “A safe Return deny, “And all about her take Alarm “If she attempt to fly; “So lured, so frightened, on she goes “The Way the Evils tend, “Till Death, the mildest of her Foes, “Her Fears and Terrors end. “Such Victims in their happier day “But Dreams of Pleasure take, “And when their purchased Charms decay, “To Sorrow they awake. “Can I describe these many ills?

“No Art could save this ruined face “That not a Look obtained, “How soon was run my guilty Race, “And what for me remained? “Such Object now the nicer Town “No longer could endure, “But thrust me forth to wander down “In Lanes and Courts obscure, “Among the worst of Virtue's foes, “Who shame the human shape, “Who never left me to repose, “Nor often to escape. “From these and brutal Wrong I fled, “Till I began to find “A new Disease affect my head “And Madness threat my Mind: “For Reason brooded o'er my Woe, “Half lost in Fear and Pain, “As Fenny Lights that come and go, “And not as Guides remain. “There lacks but little of my Tale, “For soon my Senses fled, “And ‘Death’, I said, ‘will soon prevail, “‘For Hope and Fear are dead.’ “Compassion saw me as I fell, “And marked me for her own, “Gave me to live in peace to tell “The Evils I have known. “Though taught to hope, I love to rove “As prompts the troubled Breast, “Not good enough the Calm to love, “The sacred Calm of Rest: “I've means to live, but in my Home “My thoughts upon me prey, “Sad thoughts that, when abroad I roam, “Life's Chances brush away. “And thus I live to speak my Woes “As frightful Visions fled, “To taste a penitent's Repose, “And rest on Virtue's Bed.” The Insanity of Ambitious Love They spake of Madness, chiefly of the Kind Where Passions agitate a vicious Mind, Where some absurd Desire affords the Cause Of Frenzy's Triumph over Reason's Laws. “I know a Being”, Jacques began, “so vain “That hungry, naked, in reproach, in pain, “His Load of Anguish was at times forgot, “And he could, glorying, bless his happy Lot. “While Reason thus was driven from her Seat “He would his favourites to his House intreat; “To his Hall's Splendor, his Delight “Was the Admiring Stranger to invite.” One Day the Rector would my Time command And I must see him,—see him proudly stand. His lofty Spirit made him half confess That Madness lightens or conceals distress. With a quick Glance that darted thro' ye Room, He bad them welcome to his splendid Home. “Come”, said the Maniac, “to my Chamber come.” With outstretch'd Arms he stood, &amp; haughty Eye, Fine, &amp; yet Cunning! Arrogant, yet sly. I heard his Speech; its Substance that retain'd, Then gave it Form. The Tale itself remain'd.

“Men &amp; Women, Girls &amp; Boys, “Produc'd the Morning's varied Store, “And shar'd the Night's unvaried Joy. “I felt a strong, persuasive Call “And boldly ventur'd to the Crew, “And ‘Welcome’ was the Cry from all, “‘We knew you’—&amp; it seem'd they knew; “And She, that Queen of swarthy Hue, “Said: ‘Banish Fear, the Lover's foe!’ “And then her Eyes were like ye Drops, “That shine upon the ripen'd Sloe. “Now call forth all the Faith ye can, “Nor doubt the Truths that I shall speak, “Nor, like an half believing Man, “Have ever proofs on proofs to seek, “But boldly all at once believe, “And you a wondrous Tale shall hear, “That may the irksome Hour deceive, “Till my Enchantress shall appear. “And when she shall indeed Appear, “Then must you instantly retire. “Oh! she would look with Frown severe, “Should any Glance but mine aspire “To view the Beauty all admire, “That I, &amp; I alone, possess, “The Height! the Fulness of Desire, “The Joy &amp; Glory of Success. “Oh, had you seen my Love, the Wife “Of one so dull, so cold, so tame, “How lost to the Delights of Life! “Of Life! it merits not the Name. “'Tis Life with us, with us the Flame “Of Love burns brightly—Fortune gave “The blessing, &amp; I blest became!— “But where my Story?—O! the Cave. “That Cave ran far within the Stone, “We could for many a Yard advance, “And mean those Mortals every one, “Save the wild Queen with piercing Glance. “She seemed, &amp; She indeed Alone, “A Being of superior Kind, “And in her vivid Features shone “Her Brightness of a glorious Mind. “Each took around their Fire a Place, “The black eyed Damsels laugh'd &amp; sang, “On stoney Steps the idle Race “In many an infant Gamble sprang. “Far in the Rock the Echo rang, “Far in the Rock, I wondering Gaze; “There saw I fires phosphoric hang, “Strange Fire that shone with colour'd Blaze. “And far within the Roof arose, “And brilliant Lamps on every Side, “Such as would fairy Hands dispose, “And such as fairy Light supplied. “Nor cheerful Fire was there denied, “Nor sparkling Cups, nor dainty Cheer, “Nor magic Notes that liv'd &amp; died, “And soothed the Soul, &amp; charmed the Ear. “Then up they rose in many a Pair, “And danc'd within the spacious Hall, “And as they mov'd, they tread on Air, “But answering to the Music all, “Till, as I gaz'd entranc'd about, “The Pairs retire, the Dance is done, “All vanish'd as the Sparks go out, “All, save the black Ey'd Queen alone. “‘Oh! what are these, &amp; where?’, I cried. “‘Departed’, she replied, ‘are they. “‘The Fire of Life, awhile supplied, “‘No longer warms the weary Clay. “‘But come, thy Hand, “‘No longer stand; “‘The joyous Hours of Life are few. “‘I Fortune place “‘Before thy face, “‘And leave thee, Darling, to persue.’ “‘Away with Fear, I know thee well, “‘Thy former Lot, thy changing Love, “‘But I the past forbear to tell, “‘And show thee what thou art to prove, “‘A Choice of different Fortune thine. “‘Prepare thy Heart to give thy Voice. “‘Wilt thou, sad wretch, in Want repine, “‘Wilt thou, dear Boy, in Wealth rejoice?’ “Why comes she not?—O! can she come, “Whom yet tyrannic Power restrains, “And hides that Beauty in its Bloom, “And keeps my panting Dove in Chains?— “But He is cold, &amp; I am bold! “He will retain, &amp; I persue, “Nor plead the Cause of Bonds &amp; Laws, “Love justifies what Love will do. “Do I not in my Story stray?

So dies the happy Day, “When Sleep renews the Strength to start “For Joys afresh as those decay. “Why comes She not, my Soul's delight? “Alas! her legal Tyrant knows. “He keeps her from her Lover's Sight, “And thinks, deluded Wretch, she ows “That Love to him that she bestows “On me, that I return so well, “And till her Angel-form she shows, “Let me on our Affections dwell. “So then I to my Sybil turn'd: “‘This, this, the Life that I will lead.’ “‘And well’, said she, ‘hast thou discern'd— “‘Dear Youth! thy Way, &amp; now proceed.’ “And then she led me forth with Speed! “But, parting, smil'd and turn'd to say, “‘Thou hast of no Instruction need; “‘The Dictates of the Heart obey.’ “So I the prompting heart obey'd, “As to varying bliss it led; “For me has sigh'd the rustic Maid, “For me the Lady's tear is shed. “I am the languid Lover's Dread! “Who woos ye Maid Whom I shall win, “And I have left a noble Bed, “While angry Charmers weep within. “A Countess is my Love, her Lord “My Friend, till he with passion base “Her vexes! with the bitter Word! “And Terms that would the Clown disgrace,— “Nay, Sirs, what mean you to displace “Those lovely flowers? why angry rise “And Now again—those Works deface, “That have such Beauty in her Eyes? “O! our dear Gifts”— —“Unhappy Man! “Dost thou indeed thy Lye believe? “Or dost thou think that Others can? “But now no more thyself deceive— “Fond Wretch, thy guilty Error leave. “Mad as thou art! yet guilty thou, “And we abhor thee, while we grieve, “And chide the Pity we allow. “Away with this Accursed Pride, “These Visions profligate &amp; vain! “Know thy sad Self, &amp; put Aside “Thy sinful thoughts!—let Reason reign. “Look! look upon this Bolt, this Chain, “These black'ned Walls, this dusty Cell, “Where Guilt &amp; Grief, where Woe &amp; pain, “Where Malice, Mischief, Madness dwell. “Be still; then madly vile &amp; proud, “Wilt thou thy Father disallow? “A parish Clerk that sang aloud, “An honest Man that drove a plough! “And a vain, worthless Servant thou, “Who dar'd to gaze with sinful View “On One whose pity feeds thee now, “Thy Lady pious, piteous, true. “What is this Sophy Fancy-deck'd? “A clumsy Work of woven Straw! “What are these Flowers, these Hands collect, “But Chips and Sticks, like those ye Daw “Steals for a Nest?

I know the Way “Of Crazy Craft—but will be kind— “Pray, if thou canst—Come, let us pray.” The Lover of Virtue Late in the Night—the Wind forbade by Day— From the tall Ship that anchor'd in the bay A young Lieutenant to his native Shore Was row'd, then left the well known Way t'explore. See he could not, he listen'd to the Sound That Southward came, &amp; thither he was bound. Walk but one Mile, &amp; he should then behold The World's best Wealth, and in his Arms infold. Some Months had past since he beheld ye maid, But Hope by promises for Absense paid, For tho' with beauty to a Heart all Eyes, She had the Sense all Flattery to dispise. “O! my best Adela, my loveliest Friend, “My Virtuous Mistress! I on thee depend. “In thee is all that Youth or Age admires, “That prudence seeks, that Tenderness requires, “All that can Grief subdue &amp; Joy improve, “Eternal Smiles &amp; everlasting Love, “And yet tho' fair—&amp; Oh! ye powers on high! “Dwells there more beauty in that peopled Sky?— “Yet, known her Virtues, I adhere to them, “Nor deem the Casket worthy of ye Gem. “Virtue like thine, dear Maid, is Charm alone, “And might for Age or Ugliness attone, “But thou hast join'd what Hearts &amp; Eyes approve, “And 'tis our Duty to adore and love.” “But what is this that thus impedes my Way? “This Inland Stream that rushes to the Bay? “Alas! I judg'd but ill the Time &amp; tide, “And cannot ford it to the farther Side. “Then hark, 'tis rising! Hours must yet be lost, “E'er as ye Water falls, it may be crosst; “I dare not trust me to th' uncertain deep, “The Sound so thret'ning, &amp; the Bank so steep. “My Apprehendsions &amp; my Love at Strife, “This bids me hazard, those preserve my Life. “Long must I walk, with this vile Stream to go, “But can I ford it in its Swelling?—No. “Upon its Bank I may securely tread, “And find a Bridge, or reach the streamlet's Head! “Beyond the Common 'tis too far, but still “A Way there must be, when there's so much Will. “We know a lover is not long alone, “Or if he be, he can but sing or groan, “Or to amusing Thoughts his Soul resign, “And utter them by fits—This must be ^mine^.” This softly musing as he mov'd along, He sooth'd his tender Sufferings with a Song: “All own the charms of her I love, “She every gentle Being pleases, “The wise &amp; good such powers approve, “For she amends the Heart she seizes. “So by just Laws &amp; wise Commands “Great Kings improve ye conquer'd Lands. “Each rival Maid, when lost her Swain, “Shows to my fairest full Submission, “For back she sends the Heart again, “Amended! by its pure Ambition, “As ships, that strike on foreign shores, “Return enrich'd by unexpected stores. “Ev'n Wives themselves shall better deem “Their Lords, by Charms like hers won over, “And Maids their Lovers more esteem, “As each have been my Charmer's Lover. “‘If blind to her's, what canst thou see’, “Will each demand, ‘in one like me?’” Thus mus'd the Wanderer, pleas'd awhile to dwell On Views absurd, unjust, impossible, But we forgive a thousand foolish Things, When each, we know, from honest Nature springs, Nor wonder, Ladies, that a Man from Sea Should such Admirer of your Virtues be, For they are deem'd the best of Cupid's Darts, Not merely striking, but amending Hearts. The Love of Beauty gives these Hearts its Wounds, But while it conquers, Virtue makes them sound. The Youth, thus thinking, found his Mind at rest, And a pure Calm succeeded in his Breast. He saw in every View the favourite Maid, As when the Calls of pity she obey'd, And gave the groaning Ease, &amp; gave the pining Aid, He saw her kneeling with an Heart devout, And all things vain &amp; frivolous shut out! He saw her on her crippled Sire attend! Daughter &amp; Nurse, &amp; Comforter &amp; friend! And then he saw her with ten thousand Charms, Hast'ning to meet, &amp; sinking in his Arms! He now of late some feeble Lights had seen, And he remember'd Hovels on a Green. Those feeble Twinklers from the Windows shon, Enlarged in Number as he travel'd on, But One, or something led his Judgment wrong, Was moving with unsteddy pace along. True it was small, &amp; did not wildly glare, Like a strange Meteor in the troubled Air, It went not Dancing from the Fen below, But was such sober Light as Lanthorns show; Yet was there something strange, such light to trace So late at night &amp; in so lone a place; And when the Fancy in her flight proceeds, 'Tis marvelous how little fact she needs. Still he approach'd, &amp; as he nearer drew, The Wonder lessen'd, but the Interest grew. He saw a Female, thro' that pane so dim That she could see, but not distinguish him. Thoughtful she seem'd, attentive, musing, still, Like one who paus'd in undetermin'd Will, As left in Woe or Wonder; he perceiv'd On nearer View &amp; clearer that she griev'd. He enter'd softly—“Do”, said he, “attend “To my Vexations, be a Stranger's Friend. “You seem in Sorrow, &amp; perhaps your tear “Falls for some Being, in Distress &amp; dear. “While you may—grieving, seek your own repose, “My trifling Want it shames me to disclose, “But to the Bridge could I obtain a Guide, “I should be thankful—'tis a flowing Tide— “And I, who landed but this Evening, see “This wicked Stream between my Home &amp; me.” The gentle female, trick'd by his Request, Beg'd one so gentle in her Hut to rest. His pity pleas'd her! &amp; his form &amp; Air, Dress &amp; Address! went further than his Prayer. Women indeed reject not Men who pray, And so much Grace &amp; Sympathy display, And have such Tears in such prevailing Eyes That they, too, catch the Look &amp; sympathise. They were not silent—“Her good Man”, she cry'd, “Was gone to light the Doctor, &amp; to guide, “Who had been call'd to that poor thing above, “A shocking Tale,—deliver me from Love.” “Your Daughter?” “Mine, I bless my fortune, No. “Mine is long gone where you &amp; I must go, “Where this poor Child of Sorrow may be blest, “At least with something that she knew not—rest.” With glist'ning Eye that touch'd the Woman's heart, “We feel”, he cried, “the Blessings we impart, “Nor shall your noble Zeal, that I revere, “Fail of Reward hereafter—no, nor here. “Not all the Wealth that curses eastern Climes, “Not all that Crimes command or cover Crimes, “Can buy the sweet Emotion that we feel, “When we our Neighbours' Sufferings share or heal, “When Self-denial has a Want supplied “And Heaven alone beheld the Self-denied. “But what the Tale?” —“Were all Mankind like thee, “Tales of such Misery could no longer be.” And with her honest praise the Cottage dame At once respectful &amp; yet kind became; Trusting as trusted! what she saw &amp; heard Had to her gentle Mind the Youth indear'd. “She was an Orphan who to Service went, “A laughing, loving, romping Innocent, “Thinking no ill, none doing, Morn &amp; Night “All things seem'd pleasant in the Creature's Sight. “Gaily she danc'd this very Hut before, “And, being gay, forgot that she was poor. “Light was her Spirit, cheerful was her Look, “And with free Step she bounded o'er ye Brook. “To her the Labours of her Youth were play, “And merry was her Note from Day to Day. “She was indeed so young, so free from Harm, “A Wretch not all deprav'd had felt ye Charm, “And when he gain'd the Heart of one so poor, “In very Pity would have done no more, “But he was brutal, savage, cruel, fierce, “I cannot all the villain's Arts reherse. “If there were Witness his foul Act to prove, “He might be brought—but there is one above. “For grant she lov'd him, could have lov'd him still, “He never had her free Consent to Ill, “Nor was Her babe, that shall not ope its Eyes “On its poor Mother's Wrongs [and] Miseries, “Or its tyrannic Father's Hardness prove, “More free from sordid, selfish, sensual Love. “But he was proud to see his Victim kind, “Vain of her Love, &amp; of her Anguish blind, “And when she stoop'd to be his Passion's Slave, “It was to his Distress her Peace she gave; “Her own good Name, her Bosom's sacred Peace, “She gave his growing Triumph to increase, “And fed a cruel flame, that was so soon to cease. “O! could the Girl, that yields to Flattery, know “How soon these lordly Tyrants weary grow, “Soon as their short-liv'd Passion fails to live, “No more their pity, nor their Pence they give, “But leave the Wretch whom they seduced to grant “Her all to him; in Wretchedness with Want! “At least, if Virtue fail'd them, they would run “To some poor Swain, &amp; this Affliction shun, “They might their folly, not their pride, proclaim, “And common Sufferings share, &amp; common Shame. “Not to one Being she her Tale confess'd, “Till Nature told the Tale that Shame suppres'd, “Then, by Disgrace persued, of Want in Fear, “She sought for Pity, &amp; she found it here. “Her Mother's Friend perhaps would find a Bed “For her while living, &amp; a Grave when dead, “If she had Strength to flee! She made th' Attempt, &amp; fled. “When Here she told, &amp; yet she griev'd to tell, “How he forsook the Wretch who lov'd so well, “How cold e'er yet his Victim he forsook, “How much, how long she fear'd, what pains she took “To smile off every Pang &amp; sweeten every Look. “O! how capricious was the Robber grown, “Who could reproach no Conduct but his own, “And yet who never could his pains conceal, “But make her all his wayward passions feel. “Now not to keep you in such Woes too long, “For you can feel the Woe, &amp; scorn the Wrong, “This wicked Man—more Evil can we speak “Of wicked Spirits, who our Ruin seek, “As he the ruin of a cheerful Maid, “Who in her Suffering for his Safety pray'd?— “This vicious Man could say to One so true: “‘I love a Lady’, &amp; He told her who. “‘You may assist me,—may my Notes produce. “‘You serv'd the Mother &amp; may be of Use. “‘You must assist me!’; but with feeble Cry, “And sad Surprise, she answer'd: ‘I must die.’ “‘Die’, said the Wretch, ‘&amp; what will that restore? “‘You had your Day, &amp; what would you have more?’ “So said, he left her!—&amp; yet this she bore. “But she has Vengeance! tho' not all her Due, “And that dear Lady has Aveng'd her, too. “The Wretch at Sea believes that, when at Land, “He shall command the pledg'd &amp; valued Hand. “For this vile Man her large Estate she meant, “And her sad Parent gave his slow consent. “He thought with Horror of the fatal Vow, “For he preferr'd the Man she chooses now, “Son to his Friend—but shall I show the Bed, “That holds the Mother &amp; the Infant dead?” “Dead?” “Yes, in truth, the Mother &amp; ye Son, “In the same Instant, &amp; the Grave is one. “Heaven! how you tremble—sure you cannot dread, “So brave &amp; good, the Presence of the Dead. “You have not ruin'd—heavenly Powers &amp; just, “I see it now—What Being may we trust? “Yes, turn aside, &amp; let no mortal Eye “A man of pitying Cruelty espy. “Go! haste Away, before they take Alarm, “They think it murder, &amp; may do you Harm, “And for that Creature's Sake I would contrive “To keep the Author of her fate, alive. “Belike your parents, too, would mourn a Son, “Cut off for doing Wrongs that you have done. “Money! O! no, Sir, upon no Pretence. “What, sell the Life of murder'd Innocents? “Go, I beseech you, think upon your Ways, “And try to practise Goodness, not to praise. “Let not your Tears hang glistering in the Eyes; “If your Heart melts not! they in vain Arise. “If your Will follow not in Virtue's Cause, “'Tis base Deceit to give her your Applause, “But if to Goodness you would bend your Soul, “That will your Spirit &amp; your Art controul; “And when Temptation shall your Heart assail, “Think of this Night, &amp; Virtue may prevail.”— Lord Byron's Inscript upon a Newfoundland Dog From whence, Lord B., did your Lordship find This horrid Picture of undone Mankind? What to thy Muse the colours could impart, Thy Dogs? thy friends? or thine own Head &amp; Heart? Thy Dog could nothing of the matter tell, But his poor Master could have done as well. If Friends, thy friends can make th' assertions true The Friends of Satan are a nobler crew. If your own Heart inspir'd your angry Pen, No Wonder you exclaim: “What Brutes are men!” But if your Head alone, your Wit &amp; Spleen, Have drawn mankind so wretched &amp; so mean, If these have sketched for you th' abandonn'd Race, So worse than brutal &amp; so more than base, Recant, my Lord, &amp; learn what numbers live Thy Powers t'admire, thyne error to forgive. Ten thousand minds in either sex agree To prove thy falshood &amp; to pity thee, And many a fervent Prayer to Heav'n is sent Thou migh'st thy Verses or thy Life repent— That like thy Friend, the Dog, thou wouldst be mute, Or mourn and be above the Brute. Where am I now? Where am I now? I slept to wake Again, And to forget. O now I recollect. I'm in a Chaise that takes me o'er a Plain, Of Eaton Basset, where my Friends expect That I shall sleep, &amp; where they now collect, Three &amp; our Host. Ah! joyful shall we meet, And there discarding Thoughts of Party, Sect, We shall at once be merry &amp; discreet, Our Moments all will tell, &amp; every one be Sweet. But whither, Thomas, do you drive y? Chaise In this deep Road, with Oaks on either Side, And these tall stately Trees, on w? the Rays Of the Moon fall? They have their foliage dyed With that sweet Light! that now the Branches hide And there admit! &amp; as we swiftly move, The shifting Scenes approach &amp; past us glide, And the Mind wanders in her Worlds above. But what are these that stand majestic here, Columns &amp; proud Entablatures, grown o'er With solemn Ivy, Ruins they appear Of lordly Hall &amp; Palace Walls of Yore, Rear'd by Earth's Giant Children, but no more Are found such Works, like that of Istakar, Where Vathec, doom'd for countless Times to dwell, Saw in y? gloomy Light that shone from far Hell's fallen Host, &amp; him, the Prince of Hell. Still on we drove, &amp; still we drove, Like Thomas true of Ercledom, When He behind his Elfin Love Rode fast to her delicious Home, Where Satan once a Year w? come To fetch some Guest to his Abode, From fairy Light to fatal Gloom, So they rode on, &amp; still they rode. And now we pass a wide, wild Heath w? Speed, Swift, steddy, smooth, as if an arrow glided; On either Part Tall Trees &amp; Woods resede, And glad we take our Way like Men decided, By not a fear withheld or Doubt divided. What Views are here! what Prospects r? us rising? Yet dare we go unseen, unaw'd, unguided, And fear no Ill, for we are Enterprising. And now is chang'd y? Scene, &amp; We are come Where numerous Lights are bursting on y? View From Every Window of a mighty Dome, And Every Light is of a lovely Hue, Rich rosy red! or fair celestial blue! Good Heav'n, what brings us to this fairy Scene? Let me be calm &amp; patient—is it true? Serene is all ar?, be thou my Soul serene. It is some Mansion's noble Hall. Am I awake? A thousand Lights Burst from the antique Windows all, And there is Music that excites The very Deer! &amp; on the Night's Soft Air pours Sweetness! all divine. Say, is it one of Fancy's flights? Or is it Madness?—is it mine? We enter in a noble Park, Where there is Water, wide and clear; Tall Elms, like Giants, in the Dark Spread their broad Shoulders far &amp; near; Lo! bolting from their Haunts, the Deer, Behind the Statues dimly seen, What Objects for increasing Fear! And mean they ought? What can they mean? The Carriage stops before the Gate. I must Enquire—tho' much afraid— Where am I? 'Tis an House of State! Hark! to y? Music, sweetly play'd. The gentle Host will give me Aid! Tho' he has Friends to entertain— For him [I] ask—&amp; am obey'd! &amp; I will now my Case explain. And I am welcome. O what Ease, What Pleasure in this noble Seat, Such Means each lively Sense to please, Such Pleasures so refin'd &amp; sweet! How came I this kind fate to meet? Wines, fruits &amp; flowers, bright, fresh &amp; fair, And Notes that guide the fairy feet Of Nymphs divine, who dance our Air. What Softness in their swimming Grace, With which they pass me gazing by, What Beauty hightened in y? face, That Music, Motion, Joy supply, What Meaning in y? burning Eye, That sheds a Lustre on y? Night! Ah, let me the Enchantment fly, Or I shall loose y? Power of flight— I've heard y? Notes that win the Ear, But these enchain the softened heart! I've Ladies seen, to Lovers dear, But these a mad'ning force impart! Their every Glance is Cupid's Dart, Their every Look their Man secure; Let others talk of wounds that smart, We only feel the Smiles that Cure.— The Room is large, but filled with Love And Joy, in many a spritely Pair— 'Twas thus!—'tis gone! so transcient prove Man's happy Moments, few &amp; fair! Strange! all are vanished as in Air! Melted &amp; mixed!—but who is He, The Mansion's Lord? I'll make my Prayer For my Retreat—I w? be free— But how is this? No Lights are here, Save One, suspended in y? Gloom! The Door is clos'd, y? Air severe Up y? dark Passage seems to come, The Music ceases, all is Dumb, All dismal, dreary! doleful, dark! Friend, shew me to y? Master's Room! What is it breaks this Silence? Hark! Is it a Voice, or idle Sound, Half real! Half the Work of Dread? Loud strikes a Bell! with Tone profound, As tolling for the newly dead. Hark! is there not th' approaching Tread Of some light foot? I fear y? Hand Of Foe unseen! Where am I led? I'll go no further!—Here I stand. I said, but I was hurried on Thro' Passages that chill'd my Blood, And now when every Light was gone, At a small unclosed Door I stood, And gently knoct, &amp; thence ensued A melancholy Voice &amp; sweet: “Thou hast thy Destiny persued; “'Tis right, 'tis fit that we s? meet.” “Enter!” Alas, I doubted much, But yet I entered! &amp; espied A Monk, or One appearing such. He sat 2 antique Lamps beside, And said with condescending pride To his now half receding Guest: “Come, Child of Dust, in me confide! “I know thee well! I give thee rest.” He said, moreover: “Take a Seat.” For kind he seem'd! but nothing free. A Monk, I say, but not a Cheat; A real Monk he c? not be, But Satan's Self, when sick, could flee To such Disguise, as tells y? Jest: “The Devil a Monk in fact was he, “But Devil like the State profest.” When I was seated, then began My grave cold Host—“Time runs apace “With your poor fading Tribes of Man; “How quickly ends your idle Race! “Come! now your Purpose let us trace, “And let me help you while I may, “The golden Minutes giv'n Embrace, “And take my Council! Child of Clay!” “Who art thou!—who can read the Mind? “Disturber of my troubled Brain, “Aid me, in what?—O! let me find “My Way! &amp; seek my Guide Again!”— “Hence! all this Folly! weak &amp; vain “Thy coward Purpose—hear me speak! “I can thy inmost Thought explain, “And what thy warmest wishes seek!—” “Is there not One c? give thee Joy? “Thou seest my Knowledge of thy Heart. “But Fortune is, like Beauty, coy! “What wouldst thou give me to impart “A Charm! the produce of my Art, “That w? thy every Wish fulfil? “Nay! Child of Folly! do not start, “As if my Aid had ought of ill.” “Thou knowst there is a strong Desire! “That lives in thy unquiet Breast. “And what, fond Wretch, do I require? “I only speak to give thee rest! “Why lookst thou fearful, foolish Guest? “And wishing, dar'st not take thy Will?” “O! let me go!”, I cried! distress'd. “Base Worm”, he said, “and blind—be still.” “It is the Tempter!”, so I thought! “As if he knew it, he replied!: “Thinkst thou, poor Wretch, thy Soul is sought? “Thy Soul! O! Man with reptile pride! “What is it worth?—I wish to Guide “Thy Way to peace! thy Heart to bless. “Throw off this folly, &amp; confide “In One!—Thou hast no Chance but this.” “I know thy Thoughts; thou thinkst y? I am He, “The mighty Angel who from Heaven fell! “O! Worm to think that I so great s? be; “O! fool to judge that He who c? rebell “Against y? highest! w? with Mortals dwell, “And tempt an abject Being, such as thou! “Would condescend thy future fate to tell, “Or conversation with such Worm allow.” “I am a joyous Spirit, &amp; I love “To give to wretched Man his happy Day! “I counsel that w? Wisdom will approve. “Enjoy thy Wish; To Enjoy is to obey. “I only point y? necessary Way! “Consent to one, &amp; have thy utmost Will. “Thou'rt poor &amp; sad; be happy &amp; be gay. “Consent to me, &amp; I thy Any wish fulfil.” “Thou hast thy powerful Wishes, well I know, “And 'tis my pleasure Men like thee to aid. “I hate the vulgar minded Crew, the low, “Who of Temptation, Wretches, are afraid, “By Superstition of their own betrayed, “But thou hast Sense &amp; Courage, noble Pride, “Such as kind Spirits ever have obeyed; “And I am One; do let me be thy Guide.” “Satan, avaunt!” I s?, &amp; with a loud Burst of malicious Laughter he was gone, And I was left, but with me was a Crowd Of mocking Spirits!—visible not one! “Where can I go?”, I said, “What can be done?” Hisses &amp; Laughter mingled mock'd my Doubt. I knew not what to seek or what to shun, But wish'd my Way to find &amp; I was out! Within my Carriage! &amp; Away we run From the wild Mirth &amp; the infernal Rout. And now we hurry thro' y? Park, Like Lenora in dark Midnight, Who, boldly mounted in her Sark On fiery Steed with fleshless Knight, Intent on Love! &amp; wild with fright, Trampt, Trampt. The Hills behind them flee, They leave ye Land, &amp; in their flight Splash, Splash, Acros y? restless Sea. Above a Bridge my Carriage flies, Above a River broad &amp; slow, Or is it not the Night fogs rise Above the Fen that spreds below? Hark, do not sullen Waters flow With Murmur indistinct?—beside, In the Salt Sprigs, y? Rushes grow, That bend beneath the deep'ning Tide. What do I see? a long &amp; solemn Train Of Monks &amp; Nuns! At Midnight on their way, Like, as I read, in Portugal or Spain— A solemn funeral! a large Display! Of Pomp, &amp; Sadness!—for they choose not Day To expose the Proud Procession, &amp; they go In this dark hour! their melancholy Way, A long, long Train of Vanity &amp; Woe. In a neat Cottage In a neat Cottage hid from public View, Within a Vally bounded by a Wood, Near to the Coast, but distant from a Town, With the kind Sister of a Mother dead Dwelt a fair Damsel named Elizabeth. From an expiring Mother's feeble Hand, In holy Confidence, a sacred Trust The Aunt receiv'd, and bore her to this Place. There as a Parent, Governess &amp; Friend, She nurst and trained and led the little Maid, In Peace to Virtue, &amp; in Love to Knowledge; Gave to her Mind the Riches of her own! Corrected all that she perceiv'd Amiss! Implanted Every Truth that she believed, Fostered the new-born Virtue, and in Time Spoke of God's Grace and taught the Soul to pray. But of the Ways of social Life, the Good And Evil, Dangers &amp; Delights, the Charm And Fascination of Society, Save with that Mind whose Stores were made her own, She nothing knew! The World was yet a Book In a strange Language written, and the Guide, When the Niece, eager and inquisitive! Begged for One Page! said tenderly: “Forbear! “Ask me not, Love, I read it not myself.” The Persons whom Elizabeth beheld Were a few Peasants from the neighbouring Green, Farmers of Occupations small, and Wives Of these small Farmers! who in modest Pride Looked kindly down upon the Cottage Dames, Wives to the Lads who laboured for the Farm. To these we add the Vicar and his Wife, A Man of Cambridge, but of him unseen These 40 Years! &amp; he would sometimes say, Vapoured perhaps, or troubled for a Tax, Or forced to take a twentieth for a Tithe, Or when his Brother cast upon his Coat A Look contemptuous, but with Pity blent! Pride's Tenderness!: “I wish I had not seen.”— He was an elder Son, whose Father sent The Boy to Cambridge, &amp; kept John at home. And John in time was Tenant in the Farm, And of its Stock the Owner. Dick must pay For what it cost at College, &amp; has paid, For he is Vicar in the Place, where John Is Lord! and governs as an Overseer. But still he makes his Bow, &amp; gives his Seat, And says: “My Brother is a Learned Man! “'Twas my poor Father's Pride, but he c? not “Afford to make his John a Gentleman. “Brother, my Service, we are getting poor; “Come now, abate a little of your Tithe.” Such the Companions of Elizabeth. Here she resided, of the World she knew What these could give—no more! Some pious books Of solid practical Divinity, Laid in a quiet Case! the Vicar lent Monthly a Magazine, &amp; Farmer John A weekly Paper fraught with Country News. But not this Reading, tho' she often read And try'd to make Another's thoughts her own! Not Conversation with her Village Friends, Nor closer Converse with the dearer One, Not the good Vicar's Piety or Pride, When dwelling on y? Sermon of the Day! Nor Song of Morning Bird nor, sweeter yet, The varied Sweetness of the Bird of Night, Nor these, nor aught of Nature she [?removed] On Earth or in y? Waters, nor the Tribes Of sportive Insects on the Wing, at Eve, Soft but not silent! satisfied the Heart That ever sought for that it never found! It wanted something that was like itself, But not itself! &amp; in her devious Walks, Or on the Heath, or by the rapid brook, Not in the Path way! not within y? Wood, Nor where a Bound was fixt, nor where y? feet Of Numbers marked the Way! she chose her own, But in her own she mus'd! &amp; dared to think Of Forms &amp; Minds that she should love to know! The Forms majestic with the noblest Mind, Beauty &amp; Courage! Tenderness &amp; Grace, Not without Splendour! in y? very Garb And Grandeur in the Mein! &amp; she would suit Deeds to the Man! Elizabeth was young. While thus she lived, &amp; thought, &amp; wish'd, &amp; dreamt, Her Aunt died Suddenly— A large, lone House Between the River &amp; the Sea was named “The Dolphin's Wreck”! Some 60 years had past, Since that good Ship “The Dolphin” on y? Sand Of that wild Shore was stranded! &amp; the Plank First formed a Shepherd's Lodge! And hence y? Name. Strange Place for One who tended flocks! yet there Were Marshes all around! from that rude Sea To that wide River! &amp; in Time One Man Was y? Sole Tenant! In the narrow Farm Between y? Wasty bounds for many a Mile Bit the small hardy breed! And then arose A more commodious Building! but y? Name Was yet “The Dolphin's Wreck”! Within was heard, In the soft Summer Night, the rimpled Waves Roll on the sanded Shore! In Winter, floods! When the full Moon upon the billowy Tide Shone in her splendor fearfully! &amp; y? Wind Changed from y? South! unto the dread North-west, Then from her Window looked Elizabeth, For 'twas her Father's House, &amp; she at home Had found a Melancholy Mishap there! There she beheld the troubled Waters rise! And from her Bow-formed Window on y? West Saw the broad Stream for many a Rood engulph The salt short Herbage! Wider yet became The Watry-waste! &amp; billowy like the Sea! So thought the Maid, but, turning to the Sea, Thought that no Likeness to that dreadful Sight Could the sad World present! above y? Ridge Stoney &amp; Steep, the giant Billows threw Their foaming [?force]! &amp; dreadful was ye Sight Of clashing Waves as far as Eye could reach, And sounds of blended Horror! as they raked The rolling fleet far down y? lengthen'd Shore. How trembled then y? Maid; it c? not be But those wild Waters in their Strength would meet! All would be Sea! &amp;, like a stranded Ship! Their House a Wreck! &amp; all it held a Prey. Eastward &amp; Westward, as she turned, the Moon, As parting Clouds admitted, now appear'd Refulgent, riding in her cloudless Way! Smiling at Horror! in [the] Storm beneath. There was a Strong Enchantment in the Scene! It gave the Maiden-Mind a strange Delight, Made up by Terror &amp; Astonishment! And Admiration &amp; religious Awe! That strove with Fear, and made Divine y? event. Unsated by the Views, not unalarmed, From East to West still turning! the Mid space Seem'd Ever less'ning to Elizabeth. She had observed, beside the Path that led To the low Water's Mark, the River made, But distant more than half that pebbly Way, And near the House, a chalky, hilly Heap, By none regarded till the Damsel now, Trac'd the broad Stream encroaching! till it reach'd The scatter'd Stones, then washed y? Hillock's Base! Then turning to the Sea, awhile she staid Watching the Froathy Foam that from y? Sea Arose &amp; Fell upon the river's Tide! The Tide, that since her last alarming Look Had covered all the Heap! “And what is there “Bourne by the flood along?—it has a form, “And struggles as it rolls! Good Heaven, it lives, “And feels its fate!—'tis of my Father's flock! “And where my Father?”— Here the Maiden joined Her two domestic Damsels, for the Men Were all abroad! to pen the fright'n'd flocks, Save the poor Strays! that, like to Men astray, Disdain'd the power that saved them! &amp; so fled, And perished in their Search for Liberty! For not the Tygar nor the Pard can share Freedom &amp; Safety both! nor Sheep nor Men! “Where is my Father?”, said the fearful Maid. “Master is safe”, was said as Nature bade, Nor Reason knew what better to reply. Master was safe, but 'twas a dreadful Night! In it the River &amp; the Ocean met! Not like the Thames &amp; Medway! in their Pomp And Pride of Lawful Wedlock! but in force, Tumult &amp; Wrath! &amp; with a Voice that said: “To meet is to distroy!” But they did meet! And parted! as a Pair who should not meet, Save in that Place where they can part no more. The Season chang'd, &amp; our young Heroine Had view'd the Waters in their various forms, The Calm &amp; Storm, the Day &amp; Moonlight make! Summer &amp; Winter! she had seen the Fleets, Warlike, or fraught with Merchandise! had seen Men in distress, &amp; in distress had seen them Crowd on the deck, &amp; clinging to y? Shrouds For momentary Safety, &amp; then part, Never to meet Again! Strong Pity seized The gentle Breast, &amp; she would Millions give That she might save a Sailor— To the House At Morn or night a rude amphibious Crew Would come, her Father's Visitors, not hers, For she was then permitted to retire, But not compelled! for they were coarse &amp; loud, Their Subjects puzzled &amp; disgusted her! Fairly they bought, they said, &amp; fairly sold, And yet they dealt in darkness, &amp; they fled When none persued! &amp; they were sore afraid Of Law, &amp; poor Elizabeth of them. Save this, the Farm had little to offend, But, to be just, yet less to Edify, And nothing to amuse, as said the Maid, When she had picked her pebbles from y? beach, And, sighing, ask'd!: “What is the Worth of these? “Comes there no Being to my Father's House “But those who, being come, I wish Away? “I've dreamt of Men who c? have made this Seat, “Where strive the Bittern &amp; the Cormorant, “Which should describe it in the vilest tone, “As one where Patience might abide, &amp; Joy “Make frequent Stay! but O! the bitter fate, “Ev'n Patience sickens here, &amp; Hope must die.” Such were the Breathings of Elizabeth, When a Youth saw her in her Seat at Church, Made his Proposals, &amp; the Fathers saw No Cause nor just Impediment—How then? The Lady loves not, &amp; she will not wed? And what her Reason? That she will not give, But he is not the very Being formed In her Imagination! “Leave her, Dick”, His Father counsel'd! “That I cannot do”, The Young Man answer'd. Rich? was in Love! The Summer past Away with little Change, With its small Cares &amp; pleasures! Roughly kind Her Father's Voice! &amp; Richard fond &amp; true. With many a Thought where they had not a place, The Maiden sat, &amp; gazed for many an hour On the bright Surface of the Summer Sea, Not without Memory of y? Winter's storm. And Once again it came, more dreadful still, For Fear had now its Object! In the Dawn Of a December Day Elizabeth Had fixt the Eye upon a Ship at Sea, That was all day in Sight! Her Father said It was a Ship he knew not! yet he knew Our various Kinds! from her whose 100 Guns Bore Brittan's Thunder! thro' y? Subject Sea To the small Craft that from the foreign Shore Lands the clandestine Freight &amp; Trades by Night! It was a Ship he knew not, homeward bound! But in her Sailing there was something strange; All was not right! Alas! but he was so, For there had been a kind of Mutiny! Not yet appeased! the Men would not obey! And whom the superior few c? not controul, Nor would [?]—&amp; so the Ship remain'd Upon y? Coast of Danger! Night came on And with it came a Storm! when, Terror-calm'd, The disobedient Crew with one Consent Returned to Duty! penitent too late— To the far Shore, where stretch'd the dangerous Sands, Raged the strong Wind full East! &amp; trembling Hope Upon the weak Anchor rested now, And [?] to hear the full stretch'd Cable strain'd And groaning in the Storm; A gathering Crowd Beneath the now deserted Lodge indulged Vain Curiosity &amp; strong Surprise. Sole at her Window stood Elizabeth; She saw the Ship, how tost by every Wave, For ever moving, but for ever fixed. O! not for Ever! hold the corded Strength For a few hours, &amp; let the Winds be still, Or the Tide turn, &amp; all may yet be well. To Sailors, as they walked the Window by, She said!: “When will it be that they are [?sav'd]?” One answer'd: “What o'clock?”, &amp; she replied: “Eleven!” “Good! &amp; yesternight the Moon “Was in her 2? quarter! Wind at East!” “But is there Safty?”—“If they ride it out.” “But will they ride it out?” “Perhaps they may”, He ans? careless, &amp; the pitying Maid Felt some Concern, &amp; not without reproof!: “How feel you for Men in such distress?” “In my distress as such would feel for me! “Let him that is Watchman keep the Ward, “And take his turn for perils &amp; for play!”— What is that Cry? the Cable holds not now, The Ship is drifting! Every Eye is bent Upon her crowded deck! She ans?? not, The Helm but drifts, a Victim to y? Wind! How silent every Man, &amp; every Wave Falls unobserved! The Soul &amp; all its powers, And every Sense &amp; every Heart is there! And there all hearts are trembling to that Shore, Where they behold so many gaze on them. They have small Chance to rest as living Men! But they approach! Elizabeth can see, As she stands shivering, in a Ague-fit.... Joseph and Jesse 9 “Won by some Damsel's Eye or Cheek, “You may resign your plenteous fare, “May then your Food together share, “And each may grudge the Scraps you share. 10 “But now he comes—I see a Friend, “With whom a Wanderer dares to speak. “I shall not one so good offend; “The base alone dispise the Weak. 11 “Your Honour knows, in Days of Old “(Mine and Your Honour's are the same) “That Joseph could a Friend uphold, “And share his Glory or his Shame.” 12 “I know your Tale—my Debts I own, “But, Joseph, I from this am free, “The Prowess to some other shown “Thy erring Memory givest to me. 13 “It is an Error, Friend, but yet “There is a Law that I obey, “And bear in Mind the general Debt, “That Want proclaims and Wealth must pay. 14 “Nay! let me not thy Spirit hurt, “I rather would thy Sufferings feel, “Much rather would thy Griefs divert, “And with yet greater Pleasure heal. 15 “But, Joseph, come! thy Tale begin, “I'll hear thee, patient to the End, “As to a Sinner tell thy Sin, “And speak thy Wants as to a Friend. 16 “Give us thy Story, from the Page “Where Memory doubts what she records “To this, the still and quiet Age, “That little to her Stock affords.” 17 “Your Honour, Yes! the Wanderer knows “No Author will relate his Tale, “And so his own Exploits he shows, “His Story—with your Honour's Ale. 18 “That Story, like a Wooden Leg, “Gives me the Favour to apply “For Aid—affords me right to beg, “And shows sufficient Reason why. 19 “The poor have Pride; as I proceed, “Death will come on with threat'ning Stride, “And what is written—some will read: “‘Here Joseph Jephson dropt and died.’ 20 “So if beyond my year I stay, “Mine is no more this Life forlorn, “All Wants and Woes are done Away, “And Joseph's Love, &amp; Jesse's Scorn. 21 “I served a Year at Eldon Hall, “A Servant boy, but blest with health, “Nor saw the Lord, who ruled us all, “But Once by Chance, &amp; once by Stealth. 22 “And twice that time it was, before “Appeared that Lady gay and grand, “But how appear'd I know no more, “But that I stood as Idiots stand. 23 “Nor wonder at that Awe profound, “That troubled Sense of Fear &amp; Joy, “For she was Queen of all Around, “And I the Gard'ner's Helper's Boy. 24 “But then there was an happier Hour, “When that fair Being blest my Sight, “And deign'd to speak; I want the Power “To paint my Wonder &amp; Delight. 25 “‘Gather me Roses, my Boy’, she said. “I stood astonished &amp; entranced, “Walked backward, blushed, and hung my head. “She called—I trembled, and advanced. 26 “‘Dost hear me, Boy?’, she, laughing, cried. “I heard, but felt, with fear profound, “I knew not what, nor ought replied, “But knelt upon the new-dug ground. 27 “The Gardener came; the Lady ask'd: “‘Does this dumb Thing to you belong? “‘Speaks he?’—‘If not too straitly task'd, “‘He talks or sings the whole day long.’ 28 “‘Sings he?’, she said in some Surprise, “That with Emotion fill'd my Heart, “‘Rise then, my little Man, arise, “‘And give a Sample of the Art.’ 29 “Then on her lovely form I gazed, “&amp; felt I must her Words obey. “So, like a desperate Thing amazed, “I shut my Eyes, &amp; sang Away. 30 “‘Johnny Foe and the Gipseys all, Fa la la, “‘They pitched their Tents by Branscomb Hall. “Now Johnny was strait as a poplar, &amp; tall, “‘His Hands were white, &amp; his fingers were small, fa la. “‘My Lady came down! so fair &amp; so free, “‘yet Johnny, my Jo, I'll gang with thee, “‘For my Lord is gone &amp;’— 31 ‘There, my Child, “‘Enough of this, but thou shalt come “‘And learn my Songs’, she said, &amp; smil'd, “‘And chirp Away the Winter's Gloom.’ 32 “Twelve Years I lived in Peace &amp; Pride, “When Fortune, her dread Power to prove, “Became my Foe, my Lady died, “And my weak heart was pierced by Love. 33 “I lost my Friend, but kept my Place “Among my Lord's domestic Train, “Where saw I Jesse's Angel-Face, “And never felt my Peace Again. 34 “The Ladies of the Hall, when drest “By Jesse's Hands, were Beauties all, “But Jesse's Self, it was confest, “Was still the Pride of Eldon Hall. 35 “And Jesse in her spotless Robe, “With Bosom pure and Looks serene— “You might have sought throughout y? Globe, “And not another Jesse seen. 36 “I loved the Maid, to Frenzy loved, “And sought her Smile, that if I found, “At once it cheer'd me, &amp; reproved, “At once enlarged, &amp; soothed my Wound. 36B “Soon as these rebel-Passions wake, “'Tis Wisdom's Caution: ‘Be afraid; “‘The Mastery you must give or take, “‘You must obey, or be obey'd.’ 36C “They seem at first as Pigmy foes, “Whom We in Folly's Pride Condemn, “Whom we dispise &amp; not oppose, “And scorn to be subdued by them. 36D “They grow, &amp; Danger then appears, “Till by the View alarm'd, At length! “We meet their force with Coward Fears, “&amp; Virtue yields at their Strength. 37 “It was a strange, mistaken Love, “That could Contempt &amp; Scorn endure, “That no Remonstrance could remove, “That no Indignities could cure. 38 “I pray'd, as Saints &amp; Martyrs pray, “I kneeling wept, and begg'd for Grace, “But she contemptuous turned Away, “And angry bade me know my Place. 39 “With lingering Hope &amp; patient Grief, “I watched my Jesse's speaking Eye, “To catch one Look, however brief, “As she was gaily dancing by. 40 “Or if my Worn-out Temper fail'd, “And I assumed the Man's Disdain, “One of her gentle Smiles prevailed “To call the Rebel back again. 41 “'Twas not the Smile that Maids intend, “When they encourage Lads to woo, “But One that seem'd to say: ‘My Friend, “‘Thou art a Fool to love me so.’ 42 “But while I strove in Chains so strong, “Doom'd the poor boon of Smiles to crave, “Impartial Love avenged the Wrong, “And Jesse felt the Pain she gave. 43 “The Steward's Son, with Songs &amp; Smiles, “Came to the Hall in cursed hour, “Endued with all his Mother's Wiles, “And armed with all his Father's Power. 44 “He sang—all Music died in me; “He looked like Pleasure, I like Care; “He was, what I in vain w? be, “And I was what the jealous are. 45 “O! who these Feelings can command, “What reason stands y? Shock of such, “When a gay Rival grasps the Hand, “That we would give the World to touch? 46 “And who can bear the Passion's Storm, “What Opiate can our Peace restore, “Who see that Rival clasp the Form “Of that dear Maid whom we adore? 47 “When he, with careless, saucy Glance, “Surveys her, certain to behold “That he is welcome to advance, “And plainly reads: ‘You may be bold.’ 48 “And thus assured, he acts his part, “A Lesson taught and con'd before, “While I in silence warn'd the Heart, “That bleeds in vain to bleed no more. 49 “O! why to Lovers kind and true “Are the mistaken Sex so cold, “And stoop, as they are wont to do, “Won by the forward and the bold? 49-50 “I've seen, intent on him alone, “That soft &amp; supplicating Eye, “When he, unmoved, with heart of Stone, “Deigns not One look of kind Reply. “There was a Verse I read to her, “When she with cruel Spirit strove, “That seem'd as if it might refer “To me &amp; to my luckless Love, “But this in other times was made, “For cruel Maids in days of Yore, “By one whom Griefs no more invade, “Who grieves, &amp; sings, &amp; loves no more. “‘Let Man his Love &amp; Duty prove “‘By all that Man can do, “‘Let him profess the fondest Love, “‘And let him prove it true, “‘Let him be tender! kind, discreet! “‘&amp; her false Heart adore, “‘Yet shall he cold Indifference meet, “‘And sigh in vain for more. “‘But let the dashing Spoiler come, “‘And to his Idol kneel, “‘Let him, while Truth &amp; Love are dumb, “‘With Oaths his Heart conceal; “‘By fawning Speech &amp; flattering, He “‘Shall soon his Way explore, “‘And all shall fond Compliance be, “‘Till he can ask no more—’ (51) “Of Men who love the artful Maids, “Alas, how wretched is the Lot, “While He with perfect Ease persuades “The witless Tribe, who loves them not. (52) “Why do we hold the Things so dear, “And so much thought on them bestow? “Because they to our Eyes appear “As bright as Heav'n's discolour'd bow. (53) “To swains why is that Bow so bright, “In Lovers why that fierce Desire? “Because they cannot see what slight “And vapoury Things they both admire. 52 “Yet Jesse, save in Love, was just “In all her Duties—doom'd to prove “That Wisdom may, like Folly, trust, “If ever Wisdom stoops to love. 53 “But will the Youth, who wins that Heart, “Receive, possess it as a prize? “O! no, but act a Traytor's part, “He will insult it, and dispise. 54 “And can she, who was once so pure, “His Prayer admit, his Vow receive? “Can she such Freedoms long endure? “And all he feigns of Love believe? 55 “Yes, Tales from him are all believed, “And every Vow with Smiles repaid; “It seems her Joy to be deceived, “As 'tis her Fate to be betrayed. 56 “But can she with her spotless Fame, “With all that Light and Joy in Life, “Go forth! deceived, a Child of Shame, “A Parent known, &amp; not a Wife? 57 “She will not—yet we all perceive “The faded Cheek, the sunken Eye, “The fruitless Effort not to grieve, “The useless Trial not to sigh. 58 “Pity, that Pride would not endure, “That Passion could so far prevail. “I know the Angel's thoughts were pure, “But ah! the Woman's heart was frail. 59 “I saw, and Love was griev'd to see, “A Change! I would that she could trust “The Secret of her Soul to me. “To One! the time is near, she must. 60 “But still she laught to hide the Fear, “That neither Look nor Laughter hid, “And oft she fled to drop the Tear, “That trembled on the soft Eye-Lid. 61 “I've seen her meet her Lover's Eye “—Robber will best his Crime express— “What Grief did she not then imply, “And he what insolent Success! 62 “I watch'd them in the silent Night, “I saw her in Distraction kneel, “I could have kill'd him at the Sight, “Who would not! ev'n appear to feel. 63 “Methought she said, ‘I will not live, “‘If you an husband's Name deny.’ “‘No! that’, said He, ‘I must not give, “‘But here is What will Comfort buy.’ 64 “She threw it from her in Disdain, “Then clasp'd his Knee, &amp; sobbing pray'd, “Till finding Tears and Prayers in vain, “‘Go,’, she exclaim'd, &amp; He obey'd! 65 “Coldly obeyed! And then in still “And solemn Manner with her Grief “Conferred she, warring with her Will; “She Found, or seem'd to find, Relief. 66 “More calm from that sad night she grew, “Nor Joy nor Grief nor Fear exprest, “And but that I her Secret knew, “I had believ'd her Soul at Rest. 67 “But my strong Love was yet awake, “And watch'd the dear lost Girl to see “If I might some Occasion take “To turn her for Resource to me. 68 “The Time is come! with Looks aghast “She totters by! amaz'd, in Pain. “O! shield her, Heav'n, till all be past, “And she can be herself Again. 69 “The Houshold, save a useless few, “Were then in Town, and for the rest, “The old and sick their Will persue, “And went and came, as pleased them best. 70 “And where is Jesse? is she placed “With some poor Friend?—for she has some. “I try, but she cannot be traced; “I wait—and she again is come. 71 “Yet a few days, &amp; she once more “Seem'd in distress, but not in Pain; “Sedate but wretched, as before, “Was she, Nor seen to Smile Again. 72 “Watchful I wait, and soon appears “The slender form, the easy pace, “The Cheek, though pale, unstain'd by tears, “Serene though sad the beauteous face. 73 “O! Jesse, what wert thou about, “What didst thou, dost thou not indure?— “Thy Manner caused in some a Doubt, “But none in me—for I was sure. 74 “He, too, is fled—What Fate is thine! “Could I that secret Grief remove, “What would I not of Life resign, “Or Life itself! so much I love? 75 “Nor comes he more: but Jesse seems “In Meditation lost! profound “Looks, as in some bewildering Dream, “And listens to some distant Sound. 76 “‘She feels’, I said, ‘as Mothers feel. “‘Some Cottage holds her Infant Guest, “‘And there her weary Spirits steal, “‘And there her troubled Soul has Rest.’ 77 “My Lord returned, and all was Joy “And Gladness in that noble Pile, “Were laughing every Man &amp; Boy, “Ev'n Jesse try'd, but fail'd, to Smile. 78 “I loved her yet, ‘Hear, Jesse, hear. “‘Must I in vain my Wish persue? “‘True! though to me thou art severe, “‘And though thou lov'st another, true. 79 “‘Nay, hear me, for I will be heard, “‘Will not my present View resign. “‘Thee have thy Sorrows more indear'd, “‘Thy Frailty has not vanquished mine. 80 “‘Yes! thou art frail, thou know'st it well. “‘Know him who could thy Heart betray, “‘He, who could thy fond pleas repell, “‘And turn from those dear Tears away. 81 “‘Still dear to me, and I would hide “‘My Jesse from Reproach &amp; Shame, “‘Where she might long in Peace abide, “‘And bear a Wife's respected Name. 82 “‘And for thy Sin, for I must speak “‘In very plainess, we will pray, “‘Will of our God his Mercy seek, “‘And weep my Jesse's Crime Away.’— 83 “She turn'd in haste, her Look was wild. “‘What knowst thou, Man? what canst thou know?’ “‘Say, Jesse! Where that hidden Child? “‘Show me the Place—for thou canst shew. 84 “‘Then will I close thy secret hide, “‘And guard securely as my own, “‘But Jesse must in me confide, “‘And I must know what can be known. 85 “‘Doth not a Love so strong &amp; pure “‘Insure thy Safety?—Come, declare. “‘I of the Fact itself am sure! “‘Then what remains I well may share.’ 86 “Then Jesse looked around in Dread! “And fixt at length on me her Eye— “‘Why, Joseph, wouldst thou see the dead? “‘It was our Fate—that one must die. 87 “‘Do! let him rest—Enough for thee, “‘Thou canst command his Mother's Life. “‘Strange Love is thine! but can it be? “‘Would'st thou a Murderess for thy Wife? 88 “‘Why that Surprise? that sudden Start, “‘That Idiot-Stare! that deep drawn breath? “‘O! fool am I to act this part, “‘And give my Self doom'd Soul to death! 89 “‘But 'tis a Lye! I am beguil'd. “‘Insidious as thou wert to pry “‘Into my Ways—there was no Child, “‘'Twas Fancy's Murder, Terror's Lye! 90 “‘O turn not, Joseph, spare me, spare. “‘Speak! promise that you will forget “‘My Dream.’—I stood with stupid Stare, “And felt her Crime, &amp; feel it yet. 91-92 “I felt Amazement at her Guilt, “Her Crime with Terror struck my brain; “By her an Infant's blood was spilt, “But 'twas my Heart endur'd the Pain. “So much I lov'd that from that Time “I felt what I could not controul, “A Sense of Guilt for Jesse's Crime; “Her Error reached her Lover's Soul. “Her Pains &amp; Griefs were such to me, “Her Sorrows were my Bosom's Wound, “And if I from her Guilt was free, “The Terror of that Guilt I found. “And now a Cloud comes o'er my Mind; “Or Thoughts distract my Troubled Brain, “I seek ye Clue I cannot find, “Or find, but soon to loose again. “This is the very Truth I say, “&amp; then the Instant it is found, “It dances from my Sight away, “Like [?] on ye mossy Ground. 93 “Facts, real Truths, from Memory slide, “Or mix with Dreams, I know not how, “And then I wander in the wide, “Strange World! 'tis all my Business now. 94 “Jesse was tried, and was proclaimed “Not guilty!—but it would not give “Rest to her Spirit! all asham'd, “She loath'd her Life: she would not live. 95 “Such their Report, who judged her Crime! “Believing what they could not see! “But Truth it is that from the Time “She wanders through the World like me. 96 “I've met her in my Walks! ‘O! stay.’ “I said, in vain! Without Reply, “On, On, she went her destined Way, “Doomed to appear and pass me by. 97 “'Tis strange, but Time has no Effect “On her! but ever I behold “A Form light, airy and Erect, “A lovely face, but stony Cold. 98 “Our meeting is like that of Foes, “And such our parting; that pale face “Puts on Reproof, and then she goes, “I know not where, nor can I trace. 99 “Of one thing would I learn the Truth “If Truth to Mortals may be told, “Why Jesse thus appears in Youth! “When I your Honour sees am old? 100 “Thrice have I seen her, once of late, “Yet how mysterious does it seem! “For hers is that peculiar Fate, “Her Life and Death! are like a Dream. 101 “What years have past since this Event, “For Deeds of other Kind began— “What time in Wandering have I spent, “Another Life, another Man. 102 “But Jesse lives” “Cease, Joseph, cease. “Let us the needful Aid bestow, “And let thy troubled Mind have Peace; “We've all our Jesses, high &amp; low. 103 “Our Passions on our Virtues prey, “And when the Conflict is extreme, “Our Reason in the Strife gives Way, “And then our Life is but a Dream.” The Lady's Album Write in that Album?...Lady, Nay!— I pray you, do not press me to it; So rich within, without so gay, Indeed, I know not how to do it. Here, too, are drawings neat and fine, All subjects for the muse affording, That all with equal grace may shine, The Work and the appropriate wording. And can I join in Works like these With any decent hope to please? Indeed, my timid Muse, I doubt it: But let us through the volume run, And when we read what has been done, We fairly may decide about it— First comes a Sonnet—Ah! I fear I cannot be a Sonneteer; I cannot let a single thought In just so many lines be wrought, All to the Subject fairly due, I cannot draw, as men a wire, What the strict Sonnet-rules require, In measure and in meaning, too. Pass then the Sonnet—next we see A most pathetic Elegy; On Celia's Bullfinch; how it died And Celia then like Lesbia cried, When her dear bird, that used to sip, The nectar from her balmy lip, By Fate demanded, left the lass, Th' irrevocable Way to pass, In the dim World of Ghosts to go, Where now he skips among the Shades Of Birds in melancholy Glades, And chirps faint notes of Woe— But this is grief, and I have not a sigh, Not one soft line for Birds who pine and die, When Men and Maids are dying every day; But here's a song, and that would seem a thing, Within our power—it is not hard to sing, For Poets all a love of Song betray. Song— When Jacob served in Rachel's sight, Herself his promised pay, Seven years were past in such delight, Each seemd a single day: Swiftly the moments seemed to glide, While they, no change discerning, Considered not the turning tide, Nor thought that Tide had turning: But when the youth had gained his prize, And slept, no Fear possessing, No sooner had he oped his Eyes Than lo! a view distressing. “O! this is not the maid divine, “To whom I made my vow; “'Twas Rachel when I made her mine, “But O! 'tis Leah now!” So bright their view in Lovers' Eyes, No stormy cloud appearing, How fixed to them the changing skies, And every sound how cheering, They smile to hear of Ills to come, From which, what pair are free? “It may be so”, They cry, “with some; “With us it will not be.” But Fortune the affairs of Life In other Mode arranges, And Lo! how Rachel, made a wife, To Leah quickly changes— Alas! I fear we now are wrong, This looks like Satire, not like Song, A Song should be on Chloe's cheeks, Her air that breathes—Her eye that speaks, Her tongue that Wisdom's self confounds, Her shape that gives unnumbered wounds; With all the hundred thousand graces, That truth or the true lover traces; But Songs like these, if duly written, Require an heart completely smitten— Again we change—this Page contains A cottage with its happy Swains, About it Meadows, Groves and Springs, With all the beauties Summer brings, And here are Verses meant to prove That such are the retreats of Love— I cannot tell—to me it seems These are a kind of pleasant dreams, For love had rather take his lot Within a parlour than a cot; He dwells beside the cheerful blaze, And on the splendid carpet plays— He takes a large well furnished room, And loves a comfortable home— Love no objection makes to dine On Savory food with generous Wine. He sometimes has his pensive hours In shady walks and silent bowers, But oftener he desires to be With gay and pleasant Company. Soft music he no doubt approves From birds, who warbling fill their groves, But he prefers a lively air From Ladies sitting in his chair. Love is, in short, though free and wild, A taught and an observing child. He sometimes speaks with scorn enough Of wealth—but put him to the proof— And you shall find he lives to eat— No Patriarch better—savoury Meat, And would sigh deeply to be fed On skim-milk cheese and barley bread. To sing of Love I then decline, The rural Cupid is not mine, But left to them who better know Where he delights to bend his bow. Then turn we to another page, And see what there our mind engage. Say then what comes—a Riddle, the delight Of infant Bards when they begin to write, And shall I now resume that early task, Or teach my sober Muse to wear a mask? Come! let us try, but we shall ill succeed, The mask will drop as you begin to read— Riddle— I am—nay, that you cannot show. I have been—that, I grant, may be. I may be—That we do not know, Nor on the question can agree. I have a Master, such my lot, For I am poor, and yet 'tis true I have a Servant—doubt me not— My servant is my master, too. My power is not to mortals known, My nature is not understood, Yet kindred with the dust, I own The Wants and Pains of flesh and blood. Learn what unearthly things I do, And wonder at the things you learn, My Dwelling and my person view, And wonder will to pity turn. Yet am I proud as well as poor, Kings of the Earth have Honour done me, One came my Knowledge to explore, Another wrote a treatise on me. Here next some Lines on Freedom may be seen, When the fair writer counted years fifteen. Did the sweet girl of school day fetters dream, And made the love of Liberty her theme? All should be free, the young Enthusiast sings, For Freedom makes us of ourselves the kings. But if the blessing should to all extend, Then let it not with human beings end; There are a race of beings whom their pains And place unite, their scourges and their chains. Hear how their Keepers Men's attention win: “The first Collection in the World—walk in. “The King of Beasts—he rules o'er great &amp; small, “The Queen, his Wife—a Tygar from Bengal, “Leopards and Panthers, and a noble Tribe “That you may see, and therefore to describe “Is of no use—Walk in—on English Ground, “Nor on the Earth, is such Collection found.” I enter. Lo, the Creatures—there they be; Each in his den, with anguish in his Eye, And roused by blows that some vile spirit gives, Shows fearful tokens of the life he lives. I saw the imprisoned Tribes, their sufferings felt, And their hard Tale upon my memory dwelt; Nay, in my Dreams upon my fancy rose The king of beasts, exprest his Royal Woes, His nobler Subjects heard with woe profound, The distant Birds were silent at the Sound, And all the smaller Tribes stood listening all around: “Leopards and Tygars! Brethren! I have been “Wrapt in a dream for some delicious hours, “In our loved haunts of ever living green, “With Limbs unchained and all my native Powers. “Man was not there, or he had quickly found “What Strength was his to match the Lion's paw, “When, had I roared, he would have fled the sound, “My very look had kept the slave in Awe. “But Man has Arts that, to his weakness lent, “Can wither strength, stay flight and out go speed. “So was I caught, and to this Prison sent, “Longing for freedom, hopeless to be freed— “And here consigned, to this accursed place. “Yon freeborn birds in Fellowbonds I see, “While idle crowds with many a foolish face “Stare at a Lion for a paltry fee— “O! that I had them in my former den, “I would deal death with one effectual blow, “I would not thus dishonour free born men, “Nor treat young Lions with a slavish show. “Lo, yon poor Ostrich with that long raw neck “And simple looks, a melancholy sight, “But nought the mirth of cruel man can check, “Who has in Misery such intense delight. “But view yon coward Elephant; for him “I feel no pity—he obeys—Commands, “Bends his long trunk at man's capricious whim, “And takes the offered bread from baby hands. “I saw him take small silver from the Ground, “The idiots shouting at the wondrous sight, “While his huge ear flapt idly at the sound, “And his small eyes grew drunken with delight. “Monkeys and Apes may shew their simple tricks, “They are Man's friends, Companions and allies, “'Tis not unfit in them with men to mix, “For men they are but of inferior size. “But who, Sir Leopard, saw a son of mine, “Thy valiant brethren, or the Tygar brave, “Who ever saw them crouching at a sign “From their subserviant Wretch, of Staves a Slave? “See! from his Sleep my royal brother wakes, “His wide, long yawn proclaims a troubled breast; “In this cold clime his noble nature shakes, “In this vile den how broken is his rest! “O! that these vilain fetters we could crush, “And down our green Savannahs freely run, “Or from the Cragy Steep at pleasure rush, “Or roll in sands beneath the flaming sun, “Then for the cloud capped Hill, the far stretched plain, “The pathless wilderness, the tangled wood, “The distant roaring of the stormy Main, “The sparkling Rapids of the Mountain flood. “Is this a life for free born Bird or Beast, “Born far from man—and O, how out of Place! “All from yon huge, tame being to the least “Groan in the bondage of that cruel race.— “ Hark through the dusty Twilight of these bounds “The Yawn! the Hiss! the Roar! the Groan! the Sigh! “A mingled din of melancholy sounds “From hopeless beings, hopeless e'vn to die, “Who, borne by robbers from their native Grounds, “Send to the Lord of all th' appealing Cry.—” An ode to thee, Contentment, next ensues; Thou art a favourite subject for a muse. It would be doubtless pleasant, could we find Where dwells content and with what happy mind, For many seem like her, and for a while They speak her Language and assume her smile. First there is Mirth, mere Gaity of heart, She can some tokens of content display, But acts with too much spirit in her part, And that performed, she vanishes away. Her name the Idol Affectation takes, Puts on a smile and talks of rural ease, Her speech of many a borrowed sentence makes And boasts how “Quiet and a cottage please.” Hope, lively being, will the air assume, And many by her cheerful looks deceive, But Hope will vanish in an hour of gloom, And disappointment with her victims leave— I knew her well, and oft have been misled By her seduction, and have wondered on Where I have slept on Folly's easy bed, And, waking, found my fickle flatterer gone— In these you cannot true contentment find, But one there is whom some affect to know, Who stiles herself the pilot of the mind, A grave, majestic being, solemn, slow— —Wise and dispensing wisdom—we must own That some thing in her like content we see, But she disputes on Words and things unknown, And is no more than vain philosophy. Fancy, who takes all shapes, Content appears, A lively actress with a changing face, But Fancy dies, opposed by grief or Fears— And then contentment comes not in her place. Hard is the dwelling of the nymph to find, And yet we ought not in our search to cease; It's said she dwells with being Good and kind, The just, the humble, and the fond of peace. What Tale succeeds? a Fable, not a Tale, “The Lark, the Linnet and the Nightingale”. Sweet Birds, whose notes sweet nymphs delight to hear— Ah, why have some the Adder's leaden ear? Deaf to the charming songsters—Fable, too, To me is not inviting, but is New. Say then what moral shall by ours be taught? “Suspect the favours that were never sought— “The show of love that care and Trouble speaks, “And Cost displayed that no repayment seeks.”— Fable—The Duck and the Widgeon A Duck and Widgeon, who had flown Far from the sea and weary grown, Beneath them saw a lovely lake, Where they their night's repose might take. Upon its bosom clear and still The Feathered people swam at Will, Where Ducks of every kind were seen, And Divers undisturbed of men, And dusky Coots of Raven hue, And Teal with wing of Azure blue. All these the stranger Birds invite By friendly signs to stop their flight— The weary Widgeon judged it best To take th' advice and seek for rest— For they had flown for many a league, And hunger added to fatigue. So fell the Widgeon, “Duck”, said she, “A fairer pool you'll seldom see, “Good company, a silent shore, “No boys to shout, no gun to roar; “In such a place we may be sure “Of food, and shall our rest secure.” The Duck, who in a former year Had left the north and wintered here, Knew more than simple widgeons know, And as she calmly looked below On all the witless swimmers there, Said to her Neighbour: “Have a care, “Look at that netted, reeded fence, “And tell me what proceeds from thence. “'Tis wide, you see, at first, &amp; tall, “Then smaller grows, then very small, “And be you sure that nature makes “No such appendages to Lakes. “Man is a creature who contrives “Unnumbered arts, to take our lives, “And this, the scene of so much Joy “To foolish birds, is a Decoy. “For so my Ancestor of old, “A grey and Reverend Mallard, told. “‘Be sure’, he said, ‘no man would make “‘What we behold on yonder lake, “‘Were he not sure the care &amp; cost “‘Would be repaid, and nothing lost.’ “Therefore, altho' we weary feel, “And fain would sleep, &amp; want a meal, “Yet, cautious, let us further go, “Nor trust the kindness of a Foe, “For we, who thus are kindly prest, “When strangers, to be fed as guests, “Should think, e'er we consent to stay, “What kind of reckoning we must pay.” The Flowers 1 Custom has been, time out of mind, With Rose or Lily to compare Our favourite maid; we love to find And say she is so sweet and fair. And Violets from the sun retired, Whose fragrance scents the passing gale, Are in their still retreats admired As lasses in their lowly Vale. 2 'Tis well, but may we not our views Extend, and still a likeness find? Flowers are of many forms and hues, Of many a Class, of many a kind. Not all are like the Rose, not all Are like the lily, passing fair. Come then, the sister beauties call And let us see how like they are. 3 See first where spring these favourite flowers; The rocky Glen, the Wild has some, Others are raised in sheltering bowers, And some in common hedgerows bloom, The open plain, the furrowed land, The wide brown heath, the seaside sand. 4 And thus are tribes of Females fixed, These in the Wild, the Wood, the Glen, Those with the World's proud people mix'd And in the seats of wealthier men, Or in laborious lots of Life, The Shepherd's Lass, the Seaman's Wife. 5 See Mary, like the Primrose wild, Retiring not, but placed from view, All unaffected, Nature's child, No stately form, no sprightly hue; Her has no great admirer found, She pleases but the swains around. 6 But take this primrose from its seat, Take Mary from her humble lot, Let both the appropriate training meet, And change of both the rustic lot, They take a different air and name, The Polyanthus and the Dame, Improved, perhaps it may be said, But not the Primrose or the Maid. 7 Some Flowers are famed for early bloom, And have their triumphs for the year, But soon their beauty finds a Tomb, They charm, they fade, they disappear. They have their day, they have their doom, None of the faded glories hear. Some to a second season last, But live upon the honors past. 8 But Flowers there are of nobler fame, Who live when other Flowers decay; Year after year they please the same, The same the beauties they display; Time, to all other charms severe, Respects the beauty planted here. 9 So 'tis with many a lovely face, Admired its season, every Eye Attracted to the favourite place, That so much beauty can supply; The season flies, and every grace And glory with the season fly— The Annuals of the sex, tho' some A second year, with luck, may bloom. 10 But there are charms that long abide, Through years that other Charmers kill; Through winter's frown, through summer's pride, They flourish and are beauties still; Perennials, they compel our praise, The Rutlands of their happier days. 11 See with what mighty care &amp; cost The fair Mimosa keeps alive; Expose her but to one night's frost, And not a beauty will survive, And when you wear the tender thing, And take the utmost care you can, It is in vain, you cannot bring Your nurseling to the gaze of man. No! he must this with caution view, And if he put a finger forth, It shrinks away, as if it knew Itself of a surprising worth. 12 So was the tender Abra reared, With such attention, skill &amp; cost, As if the wondering parents feared An atom of her should be lost. She never felt the cold, rough seas, That flaccid nerves and tendons brace, She never felt the morning breeze, That blows such freshness on the face. She sits in her own drawing room, Where only her admirers come, And there they all agree in this, That none is half so fair as Miss, And Miss, the kindness to repay, Thinks none are so polite as they. 13 Descending, we the Nettle view, Armed with an hundred thousand stings. Who to such plant has likeness? Who Such pain creates, such trouble brings? Yet let us not be much alarmed, We are not by the Nettle harmed, For grasp it, as you've heard before, Boldly, and it will sting no more. 14 Such is Corinna, she is sharp, And joy to her, her sharpness brings. She has the mind that loves to carp, And suck out blame from harmless things; She never tries to soothe or please, But deals in waspish repartees. She has no beauty, but she lives In some repute for giving pain, Rejoicing in the pain she gives By hints that sting, or worse, that stain. Wit 'tis esteemed, but no, indeed, 'Tis poison in a wicked weed. But strong and sharp if your reply, Corinna's sting, and venom die. 15 The Plant that we the Climber call, And in our bowers with care dispose, Mounts quickly o'er the lofty wall, And spreads her branches where she goes, Will her abundant flowers produce, With great display and little use. 16 So Martha climbs, ambitious dame, By all she reaches, foes, or friends; Tho' from the very dust she came, She to the very height ascends, And mounted thus, she stretches forth Her riches, and displays her worth. 17 But climbers have no native strength, They must upon their props rely; With these they fail, and must at length Drop on the ground to get supply From earth's bare bosom, where they feed And mix with every vulgar weed. 18 So will the lofty Martha droop, Should her supporters fail or die, For aid will to the humble stoop, And to the poorest refuge fly; High as she rose, will sink as deep, And show that pride who climbs can creep. 19 Thou art the very wormwood, Ruth, Art bitter, blossomless, and grey, But thou hast virtues &amp;, in truth, Wilt last, when brighter flowers decay. Thy hair is silvered, and thy look Proclaims thee, let not man despise. Thou art not by the seasons shook, Thou drawest no idle herd of flies, No gaudy insects light by thee, But one there comes who knows thy worth, His aid and helper, thou shalt be, Who calmly takes, and bears thee forth. Thou very bitter art, 'tis true, But thou art very wholesome, too. 20 Who is that Tulip, who can show Colours of that transcendent kind? Thou, Daphne, thine the kindred glow, That stately form in thee we find. How do all eyes thy charms explore, Admire, and pass, and look no more? Pity that one so praised &amp; known Should call no single grace her own. The heath flower, bruised by Shepherds' feet, Is far less fine, but far more sweet. 21 Deep is the Poppey's blushing red; Ah! take it from our joyous bowers. With baneful Dew its flower is fed, Until, replete with deadly powers, Its heavy influence round is shed, That ease and cheerfulness o'erpowers. No being loves it, all would hate, Did it not men intoxicate. Ah! Lais, thou art like that Herb, Its baneful properties are thine, So formed the reason to disturb, So gaudy, flimsy, flaunting fine, And yet thou hast the witchcraft, too, That can the sense of man subdue. 22 Yon roving Woodbine, now behold How she her flexile beauty flings On all supporters, young and old, On hedge row thorns &amp; baser things, As Phillis with each decent charm Will hang on every offered arm. 23 But spite of this, if you can bind Those roving branches round a tree, If Phillis can an Husband find, Both pleasant in their way may be; But then to have the pleasure last, You watch them well, &amp; hold them fast. 24 See Larkspurs, blooming on that bed, 'Twas wisdom to assemble these; Their different looks! their pale and red, Borrow and lend a power to please. So nymphs in many a pleasant dress In our assemblies take their place, And when together, All confess They lend by turns and borrow grace. What one alone, had failed to do, They make a very pretty view. 25 Then we have Sunflowers, large &amp; tall, Who spread their beauty to the day, And we have Daisies, neat &amp; small, Pinks, bright and smart, &amp; Pansies gay, And there are Lilies of the Vale, So sweet, so pure, so fresh, so pale, Of modest growth and humble kind, But very scarce, and hard to find. Of some of these, go where you may, You find a likeness every day, Whilst some are rare, &amp; boast a place, An Habitat that few can trace. 26 Come, let us look discreetly round, In fear let us the charmers view, The prizes may no doubt be found, The blanks, Alas! are many, too. Much care it asks, to seek, to shun, For choose we must, and choose but one. 27 Shall we the blooming Rose select? There's beauty, modesty &amp; grace. What more in flower can man expect, What more in woman's lovely race? Alas! and yet her beauties all Charm but a day, and fade &amp; fall. 28 Say, in the Myrtle shall we find Resemblance to the favourite maid? There's nothing of a sweeter kind For man's approving eye displayed. It loves the shade, &amp; yet the sun No sweeter blossom smiles upon; A poet's brow it loves to bind, But other wreaths are there entwined; All seasons it alone will brave To spend its freshness o'er his grave. But where shall we this Fair behold? Ah! that the muse will not unfold.— For Miss Hoare Speak not to me of lasting fame, For I am not, like fame, to last. It is, if praise, yet mixed with blame, That but exists, and then is past. No, rather here in this fair page Let one, obedient to the call That reaches hearts—her mind engage, While this she reads—Let that be all. I ask no more, 'tis Fame enough That here awhile my verse shall live, Without the Critics' harsh reproof, Without the Honors they can give: Here shall my verse by her be read, Who partial will the lines peruse; So shall they live, when I am dead, And this shall be the fame I choose. Poins A gay, young Man, with Spirits strong &amp; high, Was listening to his widowed Mother's Sigh, The well-known Prelude to that grave Discourse, Which he expected as a Thing of Course, And heard with due Respect; for he was One Who felt &amp; owned the Duty of a Son, And prized that Love which sometimes gave him Pain That so much Wisdom was bestowed in vain. Among his Friends, for so he used to call All his Companions, for he loved them All, I left a Youth, who in his twentieth Year, Had his Associates but had not his Peer. The Lasses all addresst him as a Man, But when his Mother her Reproofs began, With sad fixed Features, but with Accent mild: “How canst thou grieve me thus, my thoughtless Child? “Thy Heart is hardened grown, &amp; all thy Ways are wild. “It is thy Boast the Laugh of Fools to raise, “And thou art fond of Pleasure, fond of Praise. “Talents thou hast, but they were lent for Use; “Thine but that barren Praise of Fools produce. “Where's that Increase, that he who gave designed? “Not to improve is to debase the Mind. “Thy Father's Pride, e'er to his Grave convey'd, “Thee shall thy Mother, in her Fear, upbraid? “Thou'st Courage, R?, but the bravest Deed “Should be thy Choice, the noblest Praise thy Meed. “And is it not the noblest Act to stem “The Passion's Currants, not be forced by them, “Not their strong Impulse weakly to obey, “And headlong hurry where they lead the Way? “Pause then and pray, and God will give thee Grace “To fly from Sin and Folly's frantic Chace “Of fancied Good, which those alone enjoy, “Who first all Sense of real Good distroy. “Nay, be not weary”—for the Youth gave Proof, Though still respectful, that he heard enough, For if he silent and submissive bowed, 'Twas not that he the serious truths allowed; Submissive he &amp; silent, for he knew His Time was short'ned, if his words were few. From fond reproving Fear, to Scenes he loved, With quickened Pace and eager Mind he moved; There the chief Place where none but he may sit, There the loud Laugh of bold Attempts at Wit, There dubious Facts that daring Oaths attest, The Tale licentious and the sportive Jest, With Language such as when Reflection came, He, who could most applaud, found much to blame. Here Richard listened to th' Applause he felt, Till in his heart the poisoned Flattery dwelt. So gay, so joyous, his Companions swore Poins was his Name, &amp; Richard was no more. Poins then he was, and his Associates led In all Adventures, he their heart and Head, Their Mischief's bold Contriver, Champion stout, Their Guide in Danger, &amp; their Pride when out. When in their favourite Inn they sang Aloud, Pleased with themselves, &amp; of their Leader proud, Poins was their Boast, a fit Companion He To any Prince in any Court might be, Yea, Prince himself, as long as he could say: “Bring in”, &amp; then in prince-like Manner pay. Th' obedient Host his every Call obeyed, As if the Honour for the Service paid, For well he judged that unpledged Acres yet Remained, &amp; gave their Sanction to the debt. How long to serve he could not justly tell, But while the Lady held them, All was well. A Youth like this, with Spirits strong &amp; high, Was not the One for Love to pine &amp; die, But One who would by Beauty's Power be moved, At least to fancy that he dearly loved. In the next Village dwelt a gentle Maid, With too much Cause, of Love &amp; him afraid, Handsome &amp; Good &amp; innocent &amp; Mild, Meek as a Saint &amp; simple as a Child. Her Richard loved, and she had loved Again, But that her Prudence whispered her refrain. She feared to give him Hope, tho' vex'd to give him Pain. In his wild Days fair Susan was his Boast, His Pride, the Subject of his Song, his Toast. Her Name suppressed, he in his idle Lay First wrote, then sang the praise of Jesse Gay: “When Beaux to please the Ladies write, “How tame &amp; heartless is their flight! “'Tis Fancy forms the Lay. “They dwell on Cupid's Bow &amp; Strings, “But I on Marriage Rites &amp; Rings, “On Love &amp; Jesse Gay. “The silver Moon's enamour'd Beam “Steals softly through the Night, “So tells the Poet in his Dream, “To kiss reflected Light. “Ah, let such Bards such Shadows kiss, “And let me speed my Way “To taste of more substantial Bliss “With Love and Jesse Gay. Youth o'er their Wine are never hard to please, But gave their hearty Praise to Lines like these. To write and sing is not for every Man; Save our young Bard, there's but one more who can. But he can more—“Another Song”, they cried, And our applauded Youth with Ease complied. “Were I as rich as Dan the Jew, “And very rich was he, “Or as the Widow well-to-do, “Who buried Husbands three, “I'd build a House by Marston Dell, “And all that part should say: “‘'Tis there the Queen of Love should dwell, “‘The matchless Jesse Gay.’ “The Bailiff's Son my Fair admires, “A Judge of Beauty true, “But she rejects his fond Desires, “For she has Judgment, too. “In vain the Wealth at his Command, “For what can Wealth impart? “The Man who gains my Jesse's Hand, “Must first obtain her Heart. “If I could win the Maiden bright, “Who dwels at Meldrew Hall, “I'd not my lovely Jesse slight, “Myself the Lord to call. “And did the Lord of Liddusdale “For Jesse's Favour sue, “He could not on the Maid prevail, “While this fond Heart was true.” This was the time when evil Passions sway'd Th' eager Mind and He their Call obey'd, And oft he thought, whate'er his Song implied, She might be his, &amp; yet not be his Bride, But some bold Efforts were so sharply checked That he perceiv'd he lost by their Effect, And soon he felt, so cold &amp; cautious she, The Bailiff's Son had better Chance than He; It must be Marriage or it must not be.— Softened by Love, his thoughts began to take The better side; He would his Ways forsake, His Tavern Mirth, his riotous Delight, And all the Pleasures of the noisy Night, The Friends, whose Fondness was th' Effect of Wine, Except the few who would such Life resign— “Jesse shall be mine.” This had its Force, and then the things dispised Resumed their Power &amp; he his freedom prized— “A Wife,” he said, “a Being made by Law, “To keep a Man in Order or in Awe; “If mild, then pining for an hasty Word; “If sharp to Anger, ev'n by Silence stirr'd; “A Spy; imprudent; if inclin'd to spend, “Then quickly comes our Pittence to an End; “And then the dear Ally, the confidential Friend, “When all the Frailty that a Man would hide “Are her's, for what is to a Friend denied? “Add, too, the kindred tribe that come to dine, “And their sweet Babes to romp &amp; roar with mine. “An Heav'n on Earth 'tis called! but what is here divine? “And yet my Susan has a Temper meek “As Infants pleased—some Council I must seek, “And my good Mother”—Vain the wise Intent; That Parent's time was now too nearly spent. A few days past, &amp; he with Grief unfeigned Sighed for the Worth that could not be retained. Rich?, tho' wild, was not an heartless Son, But deeply suffered for the Wrongs he'd done. The Pain he caused, the Days &amp; Months &amp; Years, He mourn'd with bitter, though with fruitless, tears. He felt Contrition, &amp; his Conscience slept No more—he wondered at himself and wept So good a Parent &amp; so kind; he now Could all the Virtue that he lost, allow. From his Associates he with Scorn withdrew, That even they believed his Sorrow true; Nay, his Reform; yet they conceived it strange That Grief alone could work so great a Change, And Great it was; his Grief was as a Storm That shook the Man, but yet was not Reform, Had not the Source whence Reformation springs, When it a lasting Change of Habit brings. But such it seemed; yet was his Spirit moved By other Cause, for, as he griev'd, he loved. Love, Grief and Shame conspired at once to lure His heart from Evil &amp; to work his Cure. And now reformed—for we suppress our Doubt Of the good Work so quickly brought about— He cherished Hope that Susan, mild &amp; Good, Would feel the Passion, she of late withstood, And with her Hand and all her Heart reward The Man for whom she had confest Regard. Yet he a Rival feared, and he was one With Reason feared, a neighbouring Farmer's Son, A rural Beau, with Manner free &amp; Air That marks the Hero of a Village Fair, Yet gave his prudent Father no Alarm, No Fair or fair One kept him from the Farm; Proud of the Horse that bore him to the Race, And when he joined his Landlord in the Chace, Gay Days were those, not frequent, and they gave Praise to a Youth, who could his Money save, Yet gain Applause—he thus to Market went, Well pleased with what he spared &amp; what he spent. The Friends of Susan were Advisers all: “Let him not go whom you cannot recall. “And then for whom?” “Ah!”, Susan thought, “for One “With whom no Farmer holds Comparison.” Her Heart was Judge, &amp; could the difference trace Between the Jocky-Air and real Grace, Between the Lad, who was allowed to ride, And show his Hunters at his Landlord's Side, And One, who thought not that he should aspire Beyond his Rank by riding with the Squire; He was not One who followed in a Course Always to show, perchance to sell his Horse. Poins was not jealous, yet there was some Fear Of One for ever praised, for ever near. A Man at Hand, whom all her Friends approve, Will sometimes shake a meek soul'd Maiden's Love. Nor Poins alone the jealous Terror knew, For Susan learn'd that she had Rivals, too. Not One alone! One Rival gives us Pain, But, having many, we are safe again; Like Friends are Rivals, forasmuch as One In either Case we more depend upon. But Susan loved &amp; fear'd, but now Adieu To Fears &amp; Doubts &amp; Rival. Poins is true! He comes with Love &amp; Hope, &amp; as he pleads, Her Sigh &amp; Silence tell him he succeeds. So were they wedded, &amp; our Story now Might end, did Truth &amp; History allow, Did married Couples always faithful prove, Or lasting Reformation wait on Love. There are, we doubt not, married pairs, who live With all the Comforts Life &amp; Love can give, Who not an Instant in their wedded Life Felt one sad thought for being Man &amp; Wife. Alas! with such we must not ours compare, Who were as other happy Couples are. She was not always meek, not always kind Was he; and neither were discreetly blind. Some little Failings would at times appear, But, on the Whole, it was an happy Year. “But One?” I say not that, Another past, Not much to be distinguished from the last; Richard looked o'er his Land, his Sheep, his Cows, And talked of Market Profits to his Spouse. Then there ensued, I cannot well express What I would say, a kind of Wearyness; Richard, who read while Susan worked, now swore The Book was dull, &amp; he would read no more; Then with his Legs stretched forth &amp; Head reclined, To think of Nothing he himself resigned— “But he reformed?” O! Yes, for many a day, For many a Night, and shunn'd the former Way, When strong Temptation woo'd him in the Gloom Of a long Evening, &amp; he sighed at Home. “Sigh &amp; with Susan?” Yea, and Men will sigh For Want of Something, or they know not why. He sang, &amp; asked his Susan for a Song; Yet, for all this, the Days were getting long, His Mind was active, &amp; he lacked Employ; At Length he had it, &amp; could nurse his Boy, And feel a father's Pride, &amp; join a Mother's Joy. But restless still, &amp; Susan yet confined, He sauntered forth with nothing in his Mind, Or good or Evil; What was his Intent, He knew not, knew not why, or where, he went; He meant to change his Place, &amp; that was all he meant. But whether Fortune or some evil Power Became his Guide in that unlucky Hour We cannot tell, but at the Tavern Door Stood his first Fav'rite in the Days of Yore. Resist who could? The Time, the Place, the Man Richard could not, as you, dear Reader, can. “For One gay Evening! Where could be the Harm? “It could not give his Wife at home alarm, “Nor need she know it, nothing wrong is done, “Though Women still suspect, &amp; she is One”— Thus was the Door now Opened, &amp; the Flood Rushed in Amain, no more to be withstood. “Ah! foolish Man, to go where thou hast known “The wise Man weak'ned &amp; the strong o'erthrown, “To go where Habit will resume her Power, “And be the thoughtless Victim of that Hour.” As on some Aweful Cliff th' adventurous Boy Looks down, &amp; seems his Terror to enjoy, “Here I am safe”, he cries, then looks Again With Self Applause, “And safe will I remain”, Then turns his foolish Head from Side to Side, And makes his sad Security his Pride, Nor, till he pitches on the Rock below, Does he his Weakness or his Misery know. So erred our Child of Frailty, loth to dwell In a secure Retreat, and so he fell, For Reformation such as his could last But till the time of Love &amp; Grief was past; And they were gone. He did resolve, indeed, But Resolution is a breaking Reed, Made by Man's Will alone—He should have known Who gives Man Strength superior to his Own; Vain his Resolve, who on himself relies, 'Tis Grief's Repentence, not Humility's. And therefore Habit in his easy Chain Drew the weak Richard to his Hold Again; Again the Tavern shouts, &amp; Friends of old Their Prize, their Victim &amp; their Pride behold; Again the Midnight Roar, the Song, the Jest, The drunken Glory of the Friends attest. High were his Spirits, though but brief his Reign, And all protested—“Poins was come Again.” In vain, the Wife proclaimed her load of Care, He could not listen, for he would not share. He felt th' approaching Ruin, and he fled To his loved Haunt to hide his guilty head, Revelling, though wretched, striving to o'ercome The poignant Anguish that he felt at home, His Self-reproach, that he could not suppress; And Love and Pity sharpened his distress. These in some thoughtful Moments made him fly To his own home in silent Agony. There, as he gazed upon his Child and Wife, He tasted all the Bitterness of Life, But when that Boy, who just began to trace The Marks of Sorrow in the Parent's Face, Or some sad smile, and had his Knowledge shown By corresponding Sorrow in his Own, That Infant Sufferer from those Scenes of Grief Was called, and gave his Wretchedness Relief! His Tears were softened by the thought that he Brought not his Child to Want &amp; Misery. But now farewell to every prudent Care, To every Hope—'tis useless now to spare. His thought, not hers, was this, who, strugling hard, Found vile Reproach &amp; Insult her Reward. These did her Conduct merit? She was sure Her Mind was spotless and her Bosom pure. But if Her Virtues stood Awhile the Test, They wanted that on which the Virtues rest, That which the Martyrs in Expiring feel, That made them scorn the Faggot &amp; the Wheel. This she had not, but that she had, which we And the world Virtue calls, &amp; Chastity. From this she felt a strong Resentment rise And whom she pitied, she could now dispise. Contemptuous now, the humbled Man she met, And loudly charged with Drunkenness &amp; Debt, She scorned his maudlin Wrath, and less could brook His sober-senseless Impotence of Look. When unsupported by the Spirits' Aid, He looked debased, forlorn, ashamed, afraid, Shrank from her Scorn, his Misery professed, In his own Room became a Beggar Guest, Then hung his aching Head, and groan'd for Want of Rest. All now was lost, save that which all her Views Of Want to come, now tempted her to loose, For she had Youth, nay, Beauty, and her Dress Was simply neat and veiled the Heart's Distress. There was, and well she knew, there was, a Friend, So are they called, who ruin and defend, Protect, enslave and love—a Man of Arms, Who long had talked of Susan &amp; her Charms, Yet not to her, save as he past, his Eyes Told her how much he would her Favour prize. Him Fortune favoured, he had Wealth to waste In the Indulgence of perverted Taste. Still Youth &amp; Fortune gave him no Pretence T'attack unquestioned Virtue—he had Sense. But when the Wife had her Resentment shown, And had assumed a Manner, not her Own, Light and affected, when he looked and sighed, And Looks, that Lovers construe, had replied, His hope grew bold, that said, “You will not be denied.” We pass the Progress of a Love so vile, Th' affected Frown, the half absenting Smile, Meeting, with Skill contrived, that might appear The Effect of Chance, while there remained a Fear, But Fears receding died, as Hope increased, Till both in guilty Certainty had ceased. Th' wretched Man his guilty Partner mourned, And to his Vice with thirsty Rage returned. So perished Virtue, honest fame, Content, And all to Wretchedness &amp; Ruin went. Poins was no more, his old Companions all Avoided him—in Pity to his fall. Cash, Credit, Character all gone, his Pride Urged him, now sober, from his Friends to hide, And Temperence now, of Want &amp; Suffering bred, Confined him, sick and sorrowing, to his Bed, A hard, mean Bed, but kindly lent by One, Who could remember what a Friend had done. Poins was that Friend, the Love that he had shown Was now repaid—He reap'd, as he had sown. His Heart was softened, Selfreproach &amp; Shame And meek Contrition to his Spirit came. Had then some Guide—but he was left alone, Save the hired Witness of the Sigh &amp; Groan, That Self abasement from his Bosom drew, When of the past he took a sad Review. Nor did he not that holy Book forget, That shewed at once the Greatness of his Debt, And gave an Hope, that in the Soul's Dismay In dread and Darkness, there was still a Way. Yet much he wanted, he was grieved to find Himself so lost and walking with Mankind, Friendless and full of fear, without a Guide &amp; blind. Restored to Health, his Mind in calmer Mood, He sighed for Comfort, and must try for food. Should he then dig or beg?—he would not try; He would not steal—'twas worse than Beggary; The parish Aid—that Pride &amp; Shame forbade. Yet One Resource the Pauper-Richard had, Nor lacked he Courage for the Life he chose, And as a Soldier he might hide his Woes, Or he might end them; thus he left the Land, To march Away as Fortune might command. So him we leave for Fortune to prefer, To see the Wife and What relates to her. She lived in Town, and not an anxious Life, Save when remembering she was not the Wife Of her fond Captain, and she could not yet, With all that Fondness, her poor Poins forget. Yet of his Sorrows she but little knew, Where he was gone, or what he might persue. Her Anger died, nor could she now appeal To her own Wrongs, her Fault had made her feel, Had made her humble, though they still remain'd, For, like her Husband, she was habit chained. She sought Amusement: she was sometimes gay, Though oft'ner grave: she prayed, or seemed to pray, And was devout at Church, &amp; kept the Sabbath Day. The early Bias of the Mind still drew The Child of Habit to the Sunday-pew, And then the World, and what the World could give, Led her like Children of that World to live. There were some Pleasures that it could impart, And gain an Influence in a weakened heart. In Air &amp; Manner she was much improved, And caught their Habits, Whom she scarsely loved. All that could please her Mind, or could employ, Her generous Lover wished her to enjoy, But, though she lived as those who largely spend, She ruled her Lover's Houshold, as his Friend, While he perversely wished her to display Herself, his Pride, &amp; be profusely Gay: Ill could he bear to see her serious Look, And, save a Play or Novel, cursed her Book. “Smile”, he would say, and as the Smile appeared, There was a soft, low Sigh that might be heard. Her Days were pleasant, but when Day declin'd, There came a Cloud, &amp; settled on the Mind. The Captain present, nought of this was seen, Her Looks were sprightly, &amp; her Air serene, But in his Absence she would think and feel, As would a Thief, who reads: “Thou shalt not steal.” Hard words unbidden came, when she would sigh, And slowly would pronounce: “A-dul-te-ry.” This brought her State so often in her View, She thought her Husband happier of the two, Yet little could she know, and ill alone she knew. Still in her Prudence she her Grief must hide, It stung her Lover's Soul, it hurt his Pride, It would Resentment in his Mind create, And marr'd the Pleasure of their tranquil State. When for such Praises she was not prepared, He talked of all the golden Joys they shared, Asked her what Wife, what Lady in the Land, Had so much Wealth &amp; Pleasure at Command? Had she a Want or Wish? &amp; what the while Did he require? Acceptance &amp; a Smile. Husbands, 'tis true, must bear the Looks, which they Are pleased t'assume, who promise to obey, But generous Lovers, though their Ladies vow No such Obedience, no sad Looks allow; To them their Charmers must appear at Ease, Such is their Pleasure; whom she lives to please. Who in a Mistress bears the Marks of Grief? When in his Sadness he expects Relief, If his fair Mistress should appear with Gloom! He might as well have found a Wife at Home. 'Tis well they know, whose Looks at least are gay, Who, no Obedience vowing, must obey, Must to their Lover's Spirit suit their part, And soothe his temper to retain his Heart. Hence evil Passions in the Bosom grow, Which neither Looks nor hasty Speech must shew, For Evil must she reap, who will to Evil sow. Still though by Susan's Gloom her Friend was tried, They no Indulgence to their Wish denied. And then two Boys, improving in their Sight, Gave them an anxious and disturbed Delight, For these fair Children of their Loves to them Must bring Reproof, &amp; must those Loves condemn, And thus the Smiles upon each Infant's face Were sweet Memorials of their own Disgrace. This Susan felt, she tried this oft, in vain, To banish Sadness, for she cherished Pain, And oft she asked, her hours in Sorrow spent: “Is this Repentence, do I not repent?” Nay, Susan, Nay, repenting Sinners fly From the sad Pleasures that their Frailties buy, They feel their ruined State, lament the Price, And spurn the Profit that is made by Vice. But thy Repentence is the fruitless Grief, That is too light to give the Soul Relief; Like an unskilful Surgeon's, all the pain That thou inflictest is endured in vain, Thy Wound is shallow, and at best it brings Unfruitful Sorrow to the Heart it wrings. How long will this, a troubled State, endure, Or what will end the Pain, or what will cure? One morn the Captain came with troubled Air, Kiss'd the fair Boys, and breathed a Parent's Prayer, Embraced his Susan, wrote awhile, and sealed Some secret Words, not yet to be revealed. “Ask not till I return”, he said, then fled, And in One Hour was brought before her—Dead. Two favourite Dogs, a Stranger's and his Own, Had angry proofs of dogged Nature shown, Which soon had ended in the usual Way, And pleased a few rude Urchins with the Fray, Had not their high-soul'd Masters interposed, And fatally the sad Adventure closed. Urged by a Moment's Anger, both appeared, And faced the Death they less than Insult feared. Say, is there not an easier Way to save An Hero's Honour than to dig his Grave? At least, to hazard Life that he may prove His Love of Honour was his dearest Love? Life he could venture, though when every Stain, That Youth contracted, would in Death remain, But let one Blot that Honour spurns appear, And he will stake that Life to make it clear; His Soul polluted he to Heaven commends, But his own Honour his own Arm defends! Thus fell poor Susan's Friend, &amp; what for her Remained that she could to her Death prefer? Fear, Sorrow, Shame, with all that they can bring, Were her's, and Want with its envenomed Sting. Nay! Love had Foresight—let her break that Seal, That Act will part of her Distresses heal, That poisoning Part; yet there is Sorrow still, The Boys were not made Subject to her Will, They with their Father's Kindred must abide, With slight Acquaintance on the Mother's Side, For though she won his Love, she could not charm his Pride. The Lads were taught, as soon as they could know, What High birth meant, their Mother's Birth was low. Then, when they saw her, they their Law obey'd; And shrank ashamed from Fondness and afraid, And cold Respect for fond Endearments paid. But though alone, she was with Means supplied, Where'er she would, in Comfort to abide— Where shall she go, &amp; for a Season sigh, Till she was easy &amp; prepar'd to die, Till she reflected on the past, &amp; shed Tears for the Living Husband &amp; the Dead? Susan was grieved, &amp; was consoled—She now Might a pure Life of Decency avow; The wicked Town she would forsake, and hide In some lone Hamlet by the Green-sea-Side, There from the Rocks upon the Ocean look, And pass the quiet Evenings with a Book, Do some kind Service to the poor, and rule The grateful pupils of her Sunday School, Would to the Sick their little Comforts send, And be accounted as the poor Man's Friend. The Place she found, although it did not seem The quiet Hamlet of her soothing Dream, Was yet a Place wherein she might reside, Commanding All Things—save the Wind &amp; Tide. Alas! not so, the Sea-nymphs &amp; their Swains Allowed no Queen to rule in their Domains; They took her Kindness kindly, but no more, No grave Advice, nor mild Rebuke they bore, But in her Presence smoaked, &amp; at her Chiding swore. For present Service and for promised Aid, “I thank you, Madam” was the whole they paid. Surly &amp; Savage! who could Favour show To them who never felt a Wish to know, Who could their thanks require, or who such Gifts bestow, But took them roughly, as they kindly came, And never asked the generous Lady's Name? But as all Creatures some Distinction find, “She of the Folly” was the name assigned! To A snug Building, severed from the rest, A Stranger's Wonder &amp; the Sailor's Jest. She built it not, nor did she much admire; It was an House, &amp; one that she could hire. Her first Objection this, It was not nigh To the poor Objects of her Charity; But now, when of these Objects she had proof, She thought it not from rudeness far enough, From the strange People, who were fierce &amp; rude, Heartless &amp; hard, &amp; void of Gratitude. Still there were Places, where a quiet Mind Might Occupation &amp; Amusement find, A few small Houses, scatter'd on a Green— Where not a Seaman or his Wife was seen. But this, too, failed, 'twas Silence all, &amp; Gloom, And Winter made a Prizon of her Room; For tho' she lov'd not Scenes where Noise abound, Yet here the Calm was awful &amp; profound. And in the Stillness of the place arose Strange Views of Life, that murder'd her repose. Twice she essay'd, but never long could stay, E'er the Wish rose, that hurried her Away. Something Agreed not with her Taste, or worse, Injured her Health, her Spirits, or her Purse. A Village then, tho' Poets may prefer Such Kind of Place, was not a Place for her. Now will she go, &amp; sitting calmly down, Enjoy th' Arrangements of a social Town, Join a few Friends, &amp; with their Aid, at Whist Stake just as much as never would be mist, And then a Novel, in a Summer's Day Or Winter-Night, would pass the Hours Away, Good Books on Sundays, or a Sermon, read To soothe the Spirit, not to turn the Head With horrid Notions of Our Sins &amp; all That came of Man's frail Nature &amp; his fall; There, without Trouble and at small Expence, She might indulge her Heart's Benevolence, And yearly read in print a fair Account Of what each Lady gave, &amp; what th' Amount. Thus known for pious Deeds &amp; social Mind, There she might Rest &amp; Relaxation find, Perhaps would gain some female Friend, &amp; then Have Life &amp; Love, unvex'd with Cares or Men, All this might do, &amp; this our Widow tried, For by that Name 'twas prudent to abide, But sad Impediments, &amp; all unseen, Came her &amp; her predicted Peace between. A decent Widow in a Street, where all The decent People in the Town might call! Genteel Apartments with her Maid &amp; Boy, 'Twas hard she could not such a State enjoy. Her Tables too, her Carpet, Cards &amp; Lights, Were such as few could boast of in their Nights, With all things handsome, but not Seamen's Wives Are greater plagues to gentle Widows' Lives Than all enquiring Ladies!—When she came They sought—so far might be allowed—her Name, But then it followed: “In What Class of Life? “A Widow is she? has she been a Wife? “Why came she hither, &amp; from whence, &amp; who “Affirm that all they tell of her is true? “What know we of her? all beside her Name “Is Guess, &amp; where there's Secrecy, there's Shame. “Her very Prudence and Discretion shows “To all the Knowing What of Life she knows. “Was she but merry and spake all she thought, “Why nothing further would be seen or sought, “But when the Dame is prudent &amp; discreet, “It shows she would not with Enquirers meet, “And wraps herself in Silence.”—Thus, in Time, Was the poor Stranger tax'd with many a Crime. Ladies grew shy, and ev'n the cheerful few, That were her Friends, became suspected, too. She went to Prayers; they wondered what she meant, But doubtless there was that she must repent. “And then so civil, we shall ever find “A Cause for that, for Cowards must be kind. “But can we visit? can we render cheap “A Name that costs a World of Care to keep?” To this not all assented, some believed That One, whom none accused, might be received: “Suppose the worst, Admit there was a Stain, “Shall that for ever as a Mark remain? “If every Blot must on our Name abide, “Good Heaven protect us, where can Creatures hide?” All this, in time, conveyed to her Retreat, Made our poor Widow's an uneasy Seat. Wearied &amp; vext, she thought again to flee In search of Peace, if Peace on Earth could be. It was not hard to effect a Change of Place, But who could fly from Censure &amp; Disgrace?— A pious Matron, who had watched her long, Who saw her wretched, &amp; who judged her Wrong, Thought this the Time, when Effort might be made With good Effect a Sister to persuade. “Remove, my Dear, &amp; Why? Go where you will, “This cruel Rumour will persue you still, “And what can Rumour—Cannot all confess “More than her Tongues, though countless, can express? “What are the best &amp; purest of us all, “But Heirs of Hell &amp; Children of the Fall? “Art thou not Sinner all? then why repine, “Because one Frailty is reported thine? “Grant all they say, &amp; why thy fate deplore? “Thrice blessed they, where Burdens are no more.”— “Come thou with me, and thou shalt hear explain'd “What has been lost, and what shall be regained, “The One sole Hope, that has for Man remained!— “And that remains for thee—fly, Sister, fly, “And leave the World, that is not worth a Sigh.” Now this good Lady, who possest the Art To smite the Brain and leave untouch'd the heart, When she perceived within her Patient's face Marks of Affright that she mistook for Grace, Conceived the strongest Hope from that Alarm, And thought her Words had wrought as by a Charm. She felt a pleasing hope of making known To her Soul's Guide a Convert of her own. Our gentle Widow—Widow let her be, For she has dearly purchased her Degree— Had the plain Sense, that sometimes leads us right In our soft Nature's &amp; persuasion's Spite, For, though she trembled as her Teacher taught, Her simple Mind was not to Frenzy wrought. Her Friend attempted with the warmest Zeal For her Soul's Health to make her deeply feel, And to her Meeting &amp; her Teacher brought, That she might first be frightened, &amp; then taught. Yet, though she listened with sincere good Will To be convinced, she was in Darkness still. Night after Night she to the Meeting went, And all her Heart to her Instructors lent; Oft as they sighed, she answer'd with a Sigh, And even wept, she knew no Reason why, But caught the Passion's form in unfelt Sympathy. She watched the Preacher with a curious Look, And thought he read full well without his Book; His earnest Manner made her feel a Shame That she could be so stupid &amp; so tame; Yet, though by Griefs &amp; Frailty she was One That seemed a Subject to be wrought upon, Yet, after many a Sermon, many a Prayer, She neither felt Assurance nor Dispair. Not loth, not loving, to their Place she went, Unsmitten, undismay'd, her Hour she spent, List'ning, though languid, till the time was come, And then in Quiet Spirit sought her Home. All Trial past, it seem'd beyond a Doubt One so unmoved must ever stand without. A Sister told her she had not the Grace To join with them, a Runner in their Race, A fellow Pilgrim, led by Faith, not Sight, A fellow Soldier, buckling for the Fight, Her as a Sister they could not receive, But she might come—She rather took her Leave. They would not own her, &amp; she thought [it] rude For One like her, rejected, to intrude. While thus she lingered, doubtful to remove, One known at Meeting came &amp; talked of Love, A shrewd, keen Man, some forty years of Age, Who thought he could a Widow'd heart engage, For he had learn'd the Owner of that Heart, With it, could much of worldly Wealth impart. But Dust &amp; Dross, as he assured her, yet It had its Uses to a Man in debt, As he assured himself.—He had perceived That she was One who readily believed, And, though Impressions quickly past Away, She might retain them till her wedding Day. He would have liked it better, had she felt The Preacher's Power, but Susan did not melt. But yet not all the Grace of Youth was fled, Her eye was brilliant, &amp; her Cheeks were Red. She did not Parties nor Amusements shun, And was a woman, therefore to be won. This fixed, the comely Sister he addrest, And much of pure &amp; zealous Love professt, Then with a Warmth of Language, which He thought Must on a Heart of Steel or Stone have wrought, He prest his Suit, but Susan with a Smile Demurely looked, &amp; plied her Work the while, Then calmly thank'd him, beg'd to be excused, And without Blush or Sigh the Boon refused, And was so calm, so steady &amp; so cool, He lost all hope that she would act the Fool. But this discarded Swain, I grieve to write, Felt a large Portion of unholy Spite; He spake so harshly, &amp; he stood so high Among his Friends, that Susan with a Sigh From the censorious World prepared to fly. Seamen &amp; Seamen's Wives were rough &amp; rude, Village Life was quite a Solitude, Scandal persued her to her Town Retreat, And Zeal condemned her where the serious meet. No Wonder then that, hunted thus, she flew To the lone Vale, &amp; bade the World Adieu. Yet Comfort grows not always by the Rills, By running Brooks or dancing Daffodils, It is not caught by saying: “Comfort, come”, But by preparing for It, House &amp; Home; Let all be quiet, easy, gentle, still, And you have Comfort, go wheree'er you will. This Susan found, yet sought it not, but fled, Like an Hind stricken, &amp; in Secret bled. There she was found lamenting, but the Grief That has no Object meets with no Relief. Her Lamentation was of mingled kind, And such as cannot be with ease defined. Yet now the Wanderer found the happiest Seat That ever Sorrow chose for a Retreat, A Woodbound Village, with its Dwellings all Mere Huts, save the Vicar's &amp; the Manor small, Where a good Lady &amp; the Priest agreed The Minds &amp; Bodies of his Flock to feed, And where our Widow's Spirit found at last Repose from all the Sufferings of the past. There she was taught that, when a Sinner strays, “Tis not enough that she believes &amp; prays, Or names the Name that Christians all Adore, But she must then repent &amp; sin no more, Must give to Virtue in her Mind a Place, And learn that Goodness is the Fruit of Grace. Now of her Errors she so well conceiv'd That what they cost her might be yet retriev'd; In Time, her Self-Reproach became less keen, And Slander found new Object for its spleen. Wife, Widow, Mistress, what the Name she bore, Her contrite Spirit was disturbed no more, Her Mind was now on better things employ'd, And yet the World itself was more enjoyed. Still the Good Lady of the Manor, still The Good Priest, exerting Heart &amp; Skill, So to her Mind their better Thoughts applied That she, in Turn, became the Village Guide. Month after Month, &amp; Year succeeding Year, With a light Spirit &amp; a Bosom clear, She with the Lady sought the House of Prayer And House of Grief, &amp; join'd the Pastor there. Easy &amp; placid, happy &amp; obscure, So might Life pass, &amp; so might long endure, If One we know, but know not if Alive, Might not some Mischief in his Rage contrive, Might not a Spoiler &amp; a Tyrant prove, And live in Riot on the Spoils of Love. Oft had she seen, where Fortune set her down, Some fine old Soldiers tramping through the Town, When Thoughts would vex her of that handsome Youth, To whom she vow'd Obedience, Love &amp; Truth. Yet came he not, to whom she made the Vow, And Hope conceived it was unlikely now. He fell in Battle: or was far from Home, Or, drinking, died—in short, he would not come. So long these Friends together dwelt, so long Each other Aided, that the Tye was strong, The same their Taste, their Ages, too, the same, And both were Widows, or possessed the Name, Till the glad Heroine of our Tale confessed, Like all the happy—that which is is best. To many a Cottage the kind Pair w? stray; Go where they would, they could not loose their Way. In some poor household they would find a Seat, And hear the Children what they taught repeat. Where stands the Parish Bound a Cottage stood, Just at the Entrance of a noble Wood, A larger Cottage this, though not a Farm, With Land annexed, to keep the Woodman warm. It was a favourite Walk, the Widowed Pair Amusement found, &amp; left Instruction there. In Youth the Woodman had a Soldier been, And much of Hazard, nay, of Horror seen, Seen many a Comrade droop, &amp; strove to steel His heart, but still the Woes of War could feel With Other Woes; He home returned to trace The long lov'd Features in his Father's face, To lay him in his Grave, &amp; fill his humble Place. To him, now married, &amp; a favourite Room That she erected, would the Lady come In Summer oft; 'twas now the Time of Year When the red Cornel &amp; wild Plumb appear, When the brown Wood has all its Verdure lost, And the faint Sun just melts the Morning frost, When Gossimer o'er stubbled Fields is spread, And the Dew glitters on the filmy Thread. Such was the Morning, cold but frosty-fair, And the two Friends would take the bracing Air. With steddy pace their purpose they persue, And near the Cottage of the Woodman drew. He saw their coming, knew they would require The pleasing Solace of their Parlour fire. Then to a Guest—“There comes my Friend”, said he, “The best of Ladies to my Spouse &amp; me. “Sit &amp; be cheerful, never Man had Guest, “More pleased with us &amp; Men like us to rest. “They will not tarry.”—then with pleasant Look He met the coming pair, &amp; cheerful spoke. “Your Pardon, Ladies, two days since I gained “A worthy Guest, who has with me remain'd. “I crave Permission, as you reach my Cot, “To show the rare good Fellow I have got. “He reads, no Parson in his Desk so clear, “And sings his Psalm, it does me good to hear. “He's travel'd far, in many a foreign Part, “And has their antient Histories by Heart, “But on his private Fortunes, smooth or rough, “I cannot speak, yet is he free enough; “He talks of early Faillures, just as one “With whom they long have all their mischief done, “Whom they no longer as his Tempters seize, “But he reviews them with a Mind at Ease. “Two Days my Guest, he loves the Country well, “And seems disposed in our good Land to dwell; “On Wright's fair freehold once he fixed his Eye. “‘A decent Place’, said he, ‘if one could buy.’ “‘It must be sold’, I answered, &amp; he stood, “As when a Man considers: ‘If I could’— “Then turned Away, &amp; ‘If’, he cried, ‘but no, “‘It is too great a—Comrade, let us go.’ “Price did he mean? a longing Eye he cast “Upon that Cot—It will be his at last.” “Enough, good Robert”, said the Pair, “take heed “Of pious Rovers—we shall soon proceed. “In this your Parlour we awhile will rest, “And need not interrupt you or your Guest.” Soon they were seated, &amp; began to talk Of the Day's Purpose &amp; the Morning Walk, Smiled at their Tenant's Speech, &amp; wondered how He could such merit to such Man allow, But soon their Wonder and their Smiles were chect By such Discourse as they could not expect. Who now appears 'tis useless to explain, And would we hide it, we shall try in vain. “Thanks, my good Friend, you've lodg'd me well, &amp; fed, “I'm much your Debtor both for Board &amp; Bed, “Thanks to our Comrade, who could so commend “A Brother Soldier to an antient Friend. “Oft has he told of your Adventures past, “And wondered where you found an home at last; “He could not hope that in a State like this “You tasted Life's first Good, domestic Bliss. “And fairly now, with just Return to deal, “I ought my poor Adventures to reveal. “The Ladies, Yes, I understand your Sign, “But let them hear—the Penalty is mine. “I shall not fright them, Whosoe'er begins “To tell his Deeds has mercy on his Sins; “Speaks he of Vice, he gives the softest Name “And never means to cloath himself with Shame. “What I confess, you may as fact believe, “And what I say not, to your thoughts I leave. “I was a Spendthrift Youth, of Spirit high, “And proud to lead a thriftless Company. “They loved me well, &amp; they assign'd a Name, “Which I thought Honour, &amp; my Mother Shame. “I once escaped, but could not long refrain “From the vile Haunt, but eager sought again “The Wine that made me Mad, the Praise that made me vain. “No more Escape, I left the Wife I loved, “When my own heart the cruel Deed approved. “Then Ruin followed Trouble, Shame, Disgrace, “For I had quickly run my sinful Race. “My Wife had left me, left the Man whose Life “Deserved no better. I had left my Wife, “But this I pass; In fact, I know not how “To bear a Subject so distressing now. “Hark! did I hear? No, Silent! I will on. “Wife, Fortune, Friends &amp; Character were gone. “Dig, beg or steal, say which should I prefer, “And which best suits a ruin'd Character? “I chose not these, to beg I was too young, “Nor mine the lying, supplicating Tongue, “Labour was slavish in mine Evil Eye, “And my Soul spurn'd the Crime of Robbery, “So I inlisted—'twas the last, best Thing. “I could at least of War &amp; Warriors sing, “Of Arms, &amp; Honour's Form, &amp; my Sovereign Lord the King. “‘March’ was the Word; in Climate Cold or Hot, “Shod or unshod, I took the Soldiers' Lot. “In many a Field I fought &amp; had my Thanks, “In Common with the Heroes of the Ranks, “Till Chance, Good Conduct &amp; a lucky Day “Gave me Advance in Glory, Rank &amp; Pay. “I now ambitious as successful grew, “As in ascending we enlarge our View, “And, proud of Fortune's favours, I began “To think it true that what we will, we can, “But a deep Wound &amp; long Confinement made “A Way for One to rule me &amp; persuade. “That Wound—see here the Token that I hide, “Or show, as moved by Penitence or Pride. “He as a Parent my Affection sway'd, “And, loving him, I listened &amp; obeyed. “To him I owe, as far as Man can give, “My Peace of Mind, the Hope in which I live, “And that, with all my Errors past, I feel “Who smites can pity, &amp; who wounds can heal. “A few weeks since I stood on English Ground, “But here no Home, no friendly Welcome found, “All dark the Views, that once could cause Delight, “All dead, that once could lively thoughts excite. “In vain my Views from Place to Place I change, “All Scenes are joyless &amp; all Faces strange. “I sought my native Town, but whom to see? “Not one remains, who felt one Care for me. “Still I remember—would I could forget, “A Tye that bound me Once, &amp; binds me yet; “There is One Being in the World, that one “Whom I must seek, yet ought I not to shun? “Your House of Comfort I behold, &amp; know “No Place to me that Comfort can bestow; “This stirs the angry Spirit, that in Views “Of War &amp; Blood, its own Distress would loose, “And then I need that Friend, who might controul “Its Rage &amp; speak Submission to my Soul.” Here ceased the Soldier, and, “Hast thou enquired “Where has that Mistress of thine Heart retired?” Rejoin'd the Woodman—“O! the Day will come, “When you, like me, will have your happy Home.” “It may not be;”, replied the Man of Arms, “I came to save her from a World of harms, “Griefs &amp; Temptations, and those sinful Tyes, “That oft from Want, &amp; not from Vice, arise; “I thought her poor, &amp; wished to make her free “From all the Snares &amp; Stings of Poverty, “To share with her my Portion, &amp; to live “In Love, apart, both willing to forgive, “And both forgiven—this in all the Pride “Of Injured Man I sought; but was denied! “Wants she had none: far more than I could do “Was done! but let me not my Tale persue. “She lives, no question, in Superior Style, “Her Means are ample, but their Source is vile— “Yet much I learn'd, that I can well approve, “But I must leave her in that State to move, “And think no more of Poins &amp; his yet lingering Love. “Again there seems Alarm, &amp; this denies “Our further Converse—whence can it arise?” He asked, who needed not, for well he knew All that had past, &amp; judged what might ensue. Much he foresaw, that need not be detailed, And Fortune favour'd, where his foresight failed. There's not one Simile of all the Tribe That can this Cottage Interview describe. Hope, Love &amp; Joy, fair Pleasure's smiling Race, Were there, &amp; there Shame, Terrour &amp; Disgrace, All these, with transcient Passions, born to die As other Passions gained the Victory. “'Tis he”, was uttered with an heavy Sigh, “O let me hear that he forgives, &amp; die.” “'Tis she”, the Soldier cried, “&amp; does she live, “And will she be forgiven, &amp; forgive?” It was, the Woodman fancied, as the Sound Of sudden Storm that flies the Forrest round, Tumultuous, not terrific, then to cease In a soft Calm, till all around is Peace. The good widow of the Village Hall, Who knew their feelings, &amp; who felt for all, Some weeks elapsing, thus a Friend address'd: “This is the State in which the Wanderers rest. “You know their Story, how they met, &amp; how “They parted Once, and are approaching Now. “Poins, as they named him in his careless youth, “Preserves unstained Integrity &amp; Truth. “He has a Pension, and has learned to save “No trifling part from that his Fortune gave. “He has enough, nay, more, he has to spare, “Nor will he in her larger Income share, “But with his decent House, his Garden trim, “And his few Books—mine, too, are free to him— “With cheerful Views of Life he seems to live, “And giving wisely, still has Means to give. “‘Let her’, he says, ‘her odious Wealth resign, “‘And share with me; what I can boast is mine. “‘Can I her Comforts taste, or could they be “‘Other than Gall &amp; Bitterness to me?’— “To this I answer, ‘She received the Price “‘Of Fear, Remorse &amp; Sorrow, not of Vice. “‘Vice no Provision made, but, Death in View, “‘He did what Virtue summon'd him to do— “‘It was not given a wanton's Heart to win, “‘'Twas Sorrow's Gift, &amp; not the Pay of Sin.’ “Thus I addressed our Soldier, who the while “Lent a light Ear, &amp; answered with a Smile. “My Simpler Friend admits her Husband's Pride “By her past Errors to be justified; “And, but she listens to my Speech, would fling “Her Store Away &amp; to his Pittence cling, “Forsake each Comfort that her Station needs, “And bid Adieu to charitable Deeds! “Would in his Cottage find a cold Retreat, “And cook th' unsavoury Food she could not eat. “All this both hear, they know me for their friend “And Will! nay must, to my Advice attend. “Meantime, each day some new Remembrance brings, “Some Recollection of past pleasant things, “Some Gay-day's Pleasure, which they gaily spent, “When a light Laugh would serve for Incident, “The Village Walks, where all they heard or saw “Drew them along as Love &amp; Pleasure draw, “While the Brook's murmur &amp; the vocal Grove “Were all they needed who were linked in Love; “These &amp; the like Endearments, now no more, “Present the Views that time can not restore, “And, like the shadows of some brilliant thing, “A soft'ned Image of the Substance bring. “These form their Subjects, &amp; 'tis plain how sweet “Is this Review of Pleasures when they meet, “And they would part with still-increasing Pain, “But for the Comfort—‘We shall meet Again.’ “As tender Lovers, they no more can taste “Life's early Pleasure—it has run to waste. “There shall no Raptures in their Walks be met, “No Shame nor Fear, no Prizon, Dun or Debt, “No fierce Enjoyments theirs, &amp; no severe Regret. “But they with quiet Spirit may enjoy “The Easy Pleasure &amp; the light Employ, “That Love may not increase, but Care will not distroy. “No Poins, no Jesse, talk of Dark &amp; Flames, “Richard &amp; Susan take their Infant Names, “And now together feel that slow Decay, “With which the best &amp; happiest pass Away.” David Morris “Lives yet a Man who to an Office came “—And dwelt among us—I forget his Name, “A Man of Business as it seemed, but one “Whose Call to Duty was—it must be done? “He loved it not, but looked as if his Place “Might be convenient, but it brought Disgrace. “We knew not what could lead him to dispise “The humble Profits that from Office rise, “But he contemptuous spoke of Customs and Excise. “This, at a time when One on whom the Muse “Show'red her rich Gifts, would not the Boon refuse; “Yet well might He disdain his Country's Thrift, “Proud of her Poet, sordid in her Gift. “Nor this our Stranger seemed the Muse to slight, “At least if Walks and Solitude invite. “His business done, he no Companions knew, “Lonely his House, and his Domestics two, “A Widow in her 50th Year, a Boy, “Her Son, both taught and trained for their Employ;

“The Care he took that None those Books should find “Were held as Proof of their pernicious Kind. “His Sabbaths all to him were Days of Rest, “He no Religion had, or none profest, “Seldom at Church, he never found a Seat “Where Congregations of Dissenters meet; “Hence as an Atheist they the Man reviled, “Who at their Censures and their Judgment smiled, “For well he knew how they the Man condemn, “The Wretch, who walks not in their Path with them. “Yet was there Sadness in his Look, like One “Who evil Things had suffered, feared or done, “But in his Actions was there nothing traced “That the Good Subject or the Man disgraced. “Him in our Walks I met, but neither spoke, “His Pace was quickened, and severe his Look, “Nor sought I him, for it appeared to us “That We had nothing pleasant to discuss. “Once on the shore, hard by that cheerless Home, “We met, both musing in the Evening Gloom, “Nor staid I then, but I perceived he cast “A Look of Kindness on me as I past, “Then hurried on, as it appeared, lest I “Should to a short and muttered Speech reply. “‘Art thou too thrown upon the Waves to’—sink “He meant to say, but was content to think, “Then left me pacing on that wintry Shore, “Our parting Scene: for him I saw no more— “To me he seemed a Being placed where none “Could share his feelings, doomed to think alone, “Above his Fortune, but without the Mind “That can its Comfort in the humblest find, “Without Resources, save in Books that fed “The Ills and Sorrows of his Fortune bred. “He was not One who could his Mind amuse “With Woods or Waters, vast or pleasant Views, “Could not on Earth beneath or Heaven above “Find Ought to stir his Wonder or his Love. “He saw with some Contempt and some Surprise “Those who on Beetles doat and Butterflies, “The Moss exploring, Shell-collecting Tribe, “That Learning stoops to class and to describe, “Pickers of Lichen from old Walls and Trees “And weeds cast up, the Refuse of the Seas, “Fanciers of Fossils, Watchers of the Worm “Enshrined to see it in its flying Form, “Gazers on Cliffs and Quarries to behold “Wrecks of old Worlds and Calculate how old, “Smellers of Mould and Fungus that display “Their pois'nous Stems where nobler Plants decay, “And Florists pleased, with idle taste to see “The barren Petal where the Fruit should be, “With all those patient Triflers who acquire “On easy terms the Fame which they desire. “Poor as he was, and, as I much suspect, “Could tell sad Stories of the World's Neglect, “Yet has he Kindness to a Sufferer shown, “And eased their Grief, though burthened with his own. “Not that the Good alone his Bounty shared; “For Woes, not Virtues, he his Pittence spared. “Perhaps he thought, with Justice Shallow's Man, “Knaves cannot beg as honest paupers can; “An honest Man in Want can boldly plead, “When a poor Rogue has of Assistance need. “But I digress, forgive me, and relate “Of this Recluse—for you have heard—the Fate, “From whence his Cares arose, and what the End “Of him who here had neither Foe nor Friend. “Yet thou mayst know”— —“Yea, truly! so incline “Thine Ear, and I will make my Knowledge thine. “Thou know'st the Man, let thy Description pass. “Such at our Parting David Morris was, “Or such he seemed, I, too, observed him then, “A Man retired, apart, estranged from Men, “But on my Pleasures and my Cares intent, “I went my Way, nor asked which Way he went, “Till other Thoughts and better times began “To make me feel for a diserted Man, “And then I sought him, for of late I heard “Of Crimes committed and of Dangers feared. “His Look was altered, nay, his very Pace “Appear'd like his, who shuffled in Disgrace; “I mist the strong, firm Step, the manly Air, “Betokening all within was firm and fair; “His half shut Eye was cast upon his feet, “As if it feared another Eye to meet. “All looked like Sorrow, and I wished to know “If I could Comfort to such Mind bestow, “For I had felt his Grief, and wished that He “Could feel the Change, which gave such Ease to me. “How much I sought him e'er he would attend, “And how at Length he knew me as a Friend, “If told, were tedious; He was loth t'impart “The latent Evils of an erring heart, “But he was Man, and suffering; weary grown “Of his own Thoughts and all that was his own; “Yet loud and painful was that Burst of Grief “In that soft Moment when he sought Relief, “When he my offered hand with Ardour prest, “And said: ‘My wearied Spirit longs for rest, “‘Longs these tumultuous feelings to disclose, “‘And seek through Vice and Misery for repose.’ “Then told his Tale; his Words I cannot give, “But all his Sufferings in my Memory live!” “Kezia (Job's fair Daughter had the Name) “To serve a Lady, from her Village came, “A Peasant's Daughter, with her Mother's Wealth “Endowed! much Beauty, Innocence and Health, “A very Pamela in Face and Heart, “But not with Pamela's firm mind or Art. “For this good Lady had a Lord, her Son, “And he the Heart of fair Kesiah won, “Not her sole Loss; she hearken'd to the Word, “Not of her Lady, but her own dear Lord. “Near Town he placed her in a quiet Seat, “Where the fond Pair might at his Pleasure meet, “And there was David born, she gave the Name, “Thinking of Home, her Father's was the same, “And there she taught her darling Boy, although “He must her Failings with his Duties know, “For still her Virtue with her Fondness strove; “She, though a Sinner, Sin could not approve, “But sighed and suffered, was subdued, nor dared “To speak Reproof against the Fault she shared. “Her Lord was still her Lover, true and strong “Was his Affection, and it lasted long. “Then little David lived in all the Joy “And Pride of Life, a gay and happy Boy. “He knew no Father, but rejoiced to see “The Grand fine Lord, who came their Guest to be, “Who in fond Play the lively Child caressed, “Who Pride and Pleasure in his Look professed, “And in his little Palm the golden Money prest. “Ten years had past in Peace, and David knew “The Praise that was, and that was not, his Due; “The last his Mother gave, not so my Lord, “Grown cold, but seldom would the first afford. “His mother dead, it seemed as if her Son “Had with some Portion of his Follies done, “And what was now the least, his dying Love, was One. “No more the Fondness he display'd before “Could now be traced; the Lover was no more. “And when that Passion from the bosom fled, “More odious Vices found their Place instead, “For Love, though faulty, still some Good imparts, “And from the colder Vices guards our hearts; “Long as he loved, his Soul a Place denied “To craving Avarice or insulting Pride. “Long as he loved, some Virtues kept their Place, “Preserved the Mind, and shielded from Disgrace, “But now the Days were come, when Love declined “And grosser Vice usurped the vacant Mind. “To Scenes of Guilt, by Folly led, he flew, “And talked of Love as antient Sinners do, “His boyish trifling and the Part he played, “E'er Dice were rattled, or e'er Bets were laid, “While Heaven's Command was held in some Respect, “And virtue treated only with Neglect. “An humble School was now for David sought, “To spare at home was poor Keziah taught; “Contracted was the Bounty of her Lord, “And poor the Stipend he could now afford. “To a small Cottage she retired, and dwelt “With anxious Thought on all she feared and felt. “David at School looked round in pure Disdain “Of all he saw, nor could his Wrath restrain; “Vulgar and rude were all, their chief Employ “To play the Tyrant o'er the weaker Boy, “By every Insult Anger to excite, “Then call the Injured to unequal Fight. “David beheld with equal Shame and Dread “Rough Sons of frugal Fathers coarsely bred, “And hither sent to gain at cheapest Rate “The useful Learning of the Pen and Slate. “These vexed his mind, nor less the daily food “That ev'n his Hunger for a while withstood, “A Master loud and stern, the Lessons hard, “And the infernal Gates for ever barred, “Where might be written in the Prizoner's View: “‘Who enters here must bid to Hope Adieu, “‘Stern Radamanthus in this Hall presides, “‘Where Hunger threatens, and where Woe abides.’ “‘O Times of Bliss’, would David now exclaim, “‘When I for Pleasure called and Pleasure came.’ “But what of Home, Alas, not Home can now “The Blessings of his earlier Days allow. “The fond Mama herself a Change had shown, “And scarsely knew her David for her own; “Cold grew her heart, reproachful she became, “And called her Once-loved Boy her Sin and Shame, “A Change mysterious to the growing Son, “That made a Mother's Heart an Heart of Stone. “She in her dress had studied to be plain, “And in discarding Vanities was vain. “There was a Cause, the Pastor of a flock, “Who charmed his Hearers, when he did not shock, “Familiar he with every Scripture-Phrase, “And taught t'instruct, invite, alarm, amaze “Th' admiring many—the retiring few “Untaught, [?unspotted] to their Priest withdrew, “For what of Old they learnt Agreed not with the New. “Not so Kezia, who believ'd her Case “Was one that asked her more especial Grace, “As nervous Patients in their Ails are sure “No common Skill can their Diseases cure. “Her Pastor's Doctrines I will not repeat, “To her they all were precious, savoury, sweet; “He and his Teaching now alone could please, “Her Care, her thought, her time she gave to these; “Her Garden, once her Pride and Her Employ, “She found it now was sinful to enjoy, “Her humble Neighbours whom she loved before, “Save a few Sisters, were esteemed no more; “What her Friend taught her, that alone was good, “And not the less, because not understood. “Her Son, received with cold repelling Looks, “And not so studious as to live with Books, “Soon found the Places where the youthful Mind “Their Consolation in their Troubles find. “The Mother's Love was in the Zealot lost, “And its Warm Currant stopt, as in a frost; “She bad the Follies of the World adieu, “And with her Follies lost her feelings, too; “The Parent's feelings, these indeed were dead, “But new Emotions found a Place instead. “Meantime, my Lord had grown his Passion's Slave, “Nor Thought to his forsaken Mistress gave. “But here on quick Recital I am forced— “He gamed, was ruined, Wed and was divorced, “Nurst his Estate, and then returned to find “Some new Amusements of more frugal kind. “His Son, not yet a Man, yet past the Boy, “Began to think how Men their Time enjoy. “His Mother's House, where he was [?forct] of late, “Was now a Place where Sectaries debate; “To his Remonstrance she disdained Reply, “And bade him from his worldly Pleasures fly, “But from her stipend was compelled to give “A part, &amp; he where best he could might live. “He sought Amusements, sought Companions, read “In his hired Loft, at frugal tables fed, “And Clubs frequented, where Men speak and spout, “Or argue Points on which they learn to doubt. “Among his Friends an Actor he could Name, “And had some Thoughts of histrionic Fame, “But when he heard what Powers the Art required, “Amid what Gain, he prudently retired. “Still he must eat, and long before the Day “Of fresh Supply, the last had slipt Away. “He had a Father, but was told that now, “Poor as the Son, he could no more allow, “The Mother's Pension must for both suffice, “Thanks to the Law, the Devil and the Dice. “So said my Lord—yet David dared to try: “‘He is a Father, and in Need am I.’ “Now David had at his Command, a Pen “That gave him Credit with discerning Men, “A Pen, at Once both flexible and strong, “And fitted for a Sermon or a Song; “His Friends asserted, it had noble Claims, “'Twas from a Swan that glided on the Thames, “It had been tried, and not without Success, “If Praise were all expected from the Press. “My Lord one Morning sitting at his Ease, “Without a Thought to vex him, or to Please, “Taught by long Habit all such thoughts t'expel, “As would upon unpleasant Subjects dwell. “A Letter came, he gazed upon the Seal, “Felt it, and thought it like a Dun's to feel. “‘And be it so, still what have I to dread?’ “Courage he called for, broke the Seal, and read. “Then, as he read, you might discern the While “Break o'er the Looks the soft and brightening Smile, “At Length his Gladness rose above Controul: “‘The Boy writes well, he does, upon my Soul; “‘A Clever Dog, but what can now be done? “‘I cannot own the Bastard for a Son. “‘Cash I have none.’ He said, &amp; said no more, “But past the Day, as Days had past before. “David was sitting in his private Room, “With one small Candle just to show its Gloom; “It could not Warmth impart, nor Verse inspire; “Nor that which was intended for a Fire, “And had been vainly strugling in the Grate, “Where twice-burnt Cinders kept their present State “And would no more rekindle, all the Pain “Of Puffing Lost! and every Effort vain. “Then at his Door a gentle Tap was heard, “So soft that nothing hostile could be feared. “So he arose, and let the Stranger in, “Who lost no Time his Business to begin: “‘My Lord, although you have no Claim—attend, “‘And hear my Message—still would be your Friend, “‘He from your Language judges you may take “‘Orders and preach—Will you a Parson make? “‘That done’—But David in Alarm replied: “‘It cannot be, I am not qualified.’ “‘You may be soon, Come, all such Scruples leave.’ “‘Nay, but I cannot certain Things receive “‘As true.’—‘What then? you can at least comply.’ “‘What, and so stain my Conscience with a Lye?’ “‘Young Man, your Letters other things foretold, “‘And other Notions, What I here behold. “‘Think Once Again, for, if I thus return, “‘You'll no more live than yonder Fire will burn.’ “Poor David briefly on the Subject mused, “Then deeply sighed, but steadily refused, “In part by Conscience led, yet thinking, too, “There must be something that my Lord w? do. “The Man unwilling from the Door retired, “And much condemned the Rashness he admired. “All Hope was vain, No other Message came, “The Days rolled on, Another and the same. “David, as various Thoughts intruded, wept, “Or laugh'd, or read, or wrote, or sang, or slept. “Then to his Mother's House would he repair; “He went, and found his Mother's Master there, “Who in her Zeal or in her Weakness gave “Power to her Guide to treat her as a Slave. “He was no more the gentle Guide and Friend, “Who to her Fears and Scruples would attend; “His Cares of such domestic kind were closed, “On whom an hundred Consciences reposed. “Yet to her Son in loving Words he spoke, “And gently tried to bring him to the Yoke, “But David boldly to his Speech replied, “Opposed his Arguments, his Facts denied, “And held in utter Scorn his Mother's Friend &amp; Guide; “His Rights demanded, as a Man assured— “They were by Law protected and secured. “The Pastor smoothly spoke: ‘Let Anger cease, “‘Son of my Spouse, and let us rest in Peace.’ “‘Give me’, said David, ‘what is mine, &amp; live “‘In Peace, but War should you refuse to give.’ “The Pastor mused upon the strong Demand, “Then placed the Sum in David's ready Hand, “Who to his Home return'd, and look'd around, “In Sadness wrapt, in Solitude profound. “Months past and years were gone, &amp; David yet “Was vexed with Cares and Troubles, Want and Debt; “He wrote for Money, and he read for Ease, “But dull the Amusement, and but small the Fees. “One Friend he had, it seem'd by Fortune sent; “So Heaven's good Gifts are misnamed Accident. “Like him, the Friend much fairer days had seen, “But more experienced in the cloudy been. “Patient, but yet without Religion's Aid, “And not by Gusts of Wrath and Passion swayed, “Both would at Fortune rail, and Evil speak, “And yet her Favours, like her Favourites, seek. “Such were the Friends, &amp; when together, they “Have soothed the Ills of many a troubled Day; “In social Converse sad, and dwelling long “On Subjects dubious, &amp; in Language strong, “As he, who sang the Fall of Man, has placed “In their vast Hall the Host from Glory chased, “Where some, apart, discoursed in sad debate “How could accord Free will and fore-fixed fate, “When all were blest, how Evil could begin, “Or how an Act decreed! was held a Sin, “How heaven-born Minds should be in Error tost, “And found no End in wandering Mazes lost, “It seem'd some Respite on such themes to dwell, “And sweet their Converse, though their Seat was Hell. “So this sad Pair—‘What Good’, they asked, ‘can rise “‘From Man's Distresses, Wants and Miseries? “‘How is it thus, that what we warmly love “‘And fondly seek! should our Distruction prove? “‘Is there a Power above, who feels it right “‘To give the Wish, and mock the Appetite? “‘To tempt with Pleasure Man's aspiring Soul, “‘And then by Laws restrain him, and Controul? “‘Is it his Pleasure that, in Reasoning thus, “‘We nothing solve, &amp; all that we discuss “‘Proves that he is, not what he is to us? “‘Is he a Father? why his Children vex? “‘Is he a Guide, why puzzle and perplex? “‘A Friend! Why friendless do we then complain? “‘A King, and Wretches groan beneath his Reign? “‘And whence comes Evil?’ Such the fruitful themes “Of nervous Men with melancholy Dreams, “Who, when their Wants demand their utmost Care, “Ask Why they want, and swell the Load they bear.— “Yet oft the Friends had happier Hours: the Page “Of deathless Poets would their Griefs assuage; “For them, came Falstaff, &amp; with him a Tribe, “That but One Mind could form, One Pen describe; “Hal, Harry, Henry lived in either Name, “The Gay, the brave, the noble Imp of Fame; “Lear, Hamlet and Macbeth, What living three “So marked, so known, so much alive can be? “Ev'n as familiar Names, &amp; Men we daily see— “So past the Hours, not cheerful, but they cast “A softening Shade on Sorrow as they past; “They brought not Pleasure, but from Care they took “His Load of Troubles &amp; his threat'ning Look, “And though, when parted, they confest his Powers, “They felt it less for these enlivening Hours. “From crowded streets their Morning Walk they took, “And made the Prospect in the Fields their Book, “But there Alas! they did not read aright, “But let their Doubt prevail o'er their Delight. “All they behold, but themes for Doubt afford: “‘Why toils the Peasant, &amp; why feasts the Lord? “‘Why Flocks &amp; Herds are feeding calmly round, “‘And We in anxious Cares &amp; Griefs abound? “‘The Time with them without a Care is spent, “‘While we the future dread! the past lament, “‘Alone unhappy in a World, where all “‘Yield to his Power, or answer to his Call.’ “Not pure the Bliss that in such Converse past, “Nor long the Comfort was decreed to last; “Fortune the reasoning Pair asunder drove, “Averse from Friendship, as is [?] to Love. “Deserted now was David in his Need, “Alone, in Care, too full of thought to read, “No Friend at hand, no Consolation near, “The Evenings of a troubled Day to chear, “To speak consoling Words, or Words of Grief to hear. “If to his Mother he for Comfort went, “She in her Zeal conjured him to repent, “Told him that Heaven alone deserv'd his Care, “And in her Zeal Affection wished him there, “Yet had her Sorrow, too, and she confest “That of all Husbands Saints were not the best, “His keen reproaches cut her to the Soul, “His pevish Temper &amp; his stern Controul, “Then, too, his Love for that which he declared “Was Dirt &amp; Trash beneath a Man's Regard. “‘I gave’, she cried, ‘and he disdain'd the pelf, “‘&amp; now he keeps, each shilling to himself. “‘From me all Hopes of better times are flown, “‘But you, my Son, have Comfort of your Own. “‘Farewell’, she sighed, &amp; David, from her Door “Withdrawing, saw his Mother's face no more. “Now what Resource, Friends none, Books few and dull, “Void of Enjoyments, Of Reflections full, “Through many an unknown Street, in many a day, “Has he past on, unmindful of his Way, “Without a Purpose, glad of all Events “That could engage him, all those Accidents “That London Crowds produce, the Fray, the Fire, “All that could make him from himself retire, “Trifles that made him in his passing stop, “Books on the Stall, or Pictures in the Shop, “And Suppliants, such as in their Look &amp; Tone “Made him exclaim: ‘I suffer not alone’, “Lanes, Allies, Streets, where dwellings poor &amp; mean, “And Vice and squallid Poverty are seen, “And what the fairer Streets, that hide the Woes “That narrow Lanes and wretched Courts disclose— “Thus to his Home he, musing, sought his Way; “So past his Days &amp; so past many a Day. “But Want is urgent; he was now inclin'd “To wish for that which he of late Resigned. “‘Why should I doubt? I have not Faith, confest, “‘But I can read a Sermon with the Rest, “‘And may their Doctrines &amp; their Creeds receive; “‘Hunger at least is willing to believe.’ “He then employed his smoothest, finest Pen, “And wrote Consent! Alas! 'twas fruitless then. “Long he expected, but at length his Door “Admitted him who found his Way before. “Gravely he spoke, reproving, “Tis your fate, “‘Young Man, like Others, to be wise too late. “‘The Time is past, the Living filled, my Lord “‘Nought in the Shape of Money can afford, “‘But What of that, an happier time may come, “‘There's Corn in Egypt, why then starve at home? “‘You're not, I judge’, &amp; cast his Eyes around, “‘To ought I see by Tyes of fondness bound. “‘There is a Sea-port, where the King maintains “‘Some trusty Servants, how this Book explains, “‘Each in his Office, 'tis a pleasant Thing, “‘And in that Station you may serve your King; “‘There you may Life in Ease &amp; Comfort spend, “‘And in your Turn to higher Place ascend, “‘But this on One Condition, you no more “‘May his Good Lordship for his Aid implore. “‘You cannot doubt, be wise and speak the Word. “‘I wait your Answer, my Return my Lord.’ “‘'Tis not a Father's Gift’, the Youth replied, “‘It suits my Fortune, but it hurts my Pride. “‘If not with Joy, the Offer I receive.’ “‘And you do wisely, so I take my Leave.’ “The Man of Business to his Patron went, “And David, murmuring, to this Port was sent. “Here you beheld him, as, from Day to Day, “To and from yonder House he walked his Way, “Then to the Shore in the receding tide, “Or by the Cliff, or at the River's Side, “Always Alone, nor they, whom Business made “Companions, dare his Privacies invade. “Nor Man alone he shunned! nor ever proved “To Woman false or true: he never loved; “'Twas not his Fate the favourite Nymph to see, “With whom he wished the favourite Swain to be; “This Pride and Poverty forbade, his Pride “Union with those in humble State denied, “And Want his prouder Wish; The untaught Fair “Filled him with Scorn, th' accomplished with Dispair. “No second Friend he sought, but strove to shun “The Man who seemed desirous to be One. “Hence our Repulses, hence the feeling shown “For your Estate—he thought upon his Own. “You left him thus, and it would please me well, “Had I no more, or better things to tell.”— “So lived the Man, his Days moved slowly on, “Although his Years seemed swift when they were gone. “Still was he poor, and found his Efforts vain “An higher Station by his Care to gain. “Another gained it, though he laboured less; “Interest, not Merit, there insured Success. “So David spoke, and from the Time began “To loose the Glory of a moral Man; “He grew Remiss, His duties were declined, “Indulged his Senses, &amp; debased his Mind. “He saw how Gain was made, and owned no Law “That bad him shun the Evil Acts he saw; “Then, overcome, he took a bolder View “Of what he could, as others round him, do; “If Conscience murmured, and his Spirits failed, “These Wine inflamed, &amp; over that prevailed. “He now desired Support, &amp; Men were found, “With whom the Troubles of his Life were drowned. “For self-approval of an happier time “Came Self-Indulgence, Cause &amp; Nurse of Crime. “He to his Mother wrote, for Money prest, “A small Assistance to a Son distressed, “But her stern Husband, who the Letter read, “Returned it, thereon Writing: ‘She is dead.’ “This griev'd not David; when his Virtue leaves “The Heart, it rarely for a Mother grieves; “The kind Affections from the Man depart, “And Vice, that first corrupts, makes hard the heart. “Him Fear and Want possessed, &amp; with them came “The Dread of Justice, now an aweful Name, “And if his Crime had not the deepest Stain, “He never could his former Peace regain. “There was a Way, but he had learn'd to treat “The Sinner's Hope, Religion, as a Cheat “Imposed on Man—And though forbad to write, “A Father's feelings he would now excite; “His Mother dead, he placed in that his Trust “Some Sparks of Love would kindle from her Dust. “Alas! in vain, &amp; when such Hope was fled, “Wrath and resentment kindled there instead. “Again he tried, to certain Misery doomed; “He now a bold &amp; thret'ning Style assumed, “Insanely Angry, for he thought to Awe “Th' unyielding Peer! without a Fear of Law, “For who would pierce him with a deeper Wound, “Whom Want had made distressed, &amp; Grief unsound? “But Others, too, had Craft, an unknown Hand “Gave in few words a Threat &amp; a Command: “‘Be warned, be wise, &amp; dare no more Offend, “‘Or loose your All, your Office &amp; your Friend.’ “Hope now forsook him, Hope of happier Time, “That was some Check, a moral Check on Crime; “His Walks abridged, he now but little read, “Drank when he could, &amp; sleepless groaned in Bed; “His Dress, his Person showed exteme Neglect, “A want of Self-Esteem &amp; Self-Respect; “He for his Office had not time to spare, “And pleaded Want of Health for Want of Care. “The Books he read were of injurious Sort “That make of Man's great Duties, themes for Sport, “Or such as told him he had nought to fear “And nought to hope! Existence ended here; “Or such as painted Scenes of guilty Bliss “As the sole Good in such a World as this, “And, calling Vice by Pleasure's softer Name, “Inflamed the Passions, &amp; forgot the Shame. “Still such Dilusions lost their power to charm, “The Sting of Guilt &amp; Want of Grief disarm, “They had no Power the racking thoughts t'expell, “And to the wounded Spirit say: ‘Be well.’— “'Twas at this Time my Knowledge of the Man “And my Compassion for his State began. “This I related with my Wish to raise “His fallen Mind by Views of brighter Days; “To me the Symptoms of his Case were known, “Signs of Disease that Once had been my own. “I strove to soothe him, Chose him Books, and read, “But his Desire and Love of Truth were fled. “He neither granted nor denied the Proof “Of Man's true State! but would reply: ‘Enough! “‘It may be so! but all is dark to me. “‘I've neither Power to argue, nor t'agree.’ “Yet he could sometimes speak in cheerful Style, “And small Events would cause a transcient Smile, “But an attempt his wayward Mind to guide “Disturbed his Temper and provoked his Pride. “He talked of Death, but, as it then appear'd, “There were in him no Symptoms to be feared. “‘Temperance &amp; Care’, I said, ‘will Health restore.’ “‘For what?’, said he, ‘My comforts live no more, “‘And when our Dwelling we no longer love, “‘What Law on Earth forbids us to remove?’ “To this I answer'd from my common Place: “‘Who quits his Post is sure to meet Disgrace.’ “‘Disgrace with Whom?’ said David, ‘shall the Dread “‘Of babling Malice pain the happy Dead? “‘Will Spencer sang, ‘When weary Mortals die, “‘Let none ask How, or whence, or where, or Why.’’ “Smiling he spoke, and earnest I replied: “‘The Poet's Verse is not the Sinner's Guide.’ “And thus we parted—‘Think not I forget’, “He said, ‘your Kindness, 'tis One pleasing Debt, “‘And proves there's Love in Man.’—My Leave I took, “And left poor David to his Bed and Book. “Yet thought I much, for I before had grieved “For what I doubted, nay, for what believed, “For my Belief was clouded, and my Doubt “Made cold, Belief, Devotion undevout, “And kept me with perturbed &amp; anxious Mind, “Seeking for Rest, but not with Hope to find, “Till One dear Friend, the Friend of all his Race, “Led me to see the Truth, &amp; to embrace. “‘Him will I seek, &amp; he will soon impart “‘Light to this Mind &amp; Comfort to this Heart. “‘He knows the Doubter's Reasoning, knows the Way “‘Their Doubts to solve, their Troubles to allay, “‘He will this Darkness from the Soul dispel, “‘And frustrate all the Powers of Sin &amp; Hell. “‘Him will poor David for his Guide receive, “‘Will first oppose, then feel his force, &amp; grieve “‘For his past Life, then tremble, then believe.’ “Thoughtful, in Hope, &amp; pleased with Our Intent, “I and my Friend to that poor Dwelling went, “And there we found him, stretched upon his Bed, “Dying, and, e'er we could approach him, dead. “Th' accursed Julep had its purpose wrought, “But O what Drug could give the Peace he sought? “Th' eternal Peace—Can ought that Souls depress, “The Body's Sufferings &amp; the Mind's Distress, “That Want of Self-respect that Sinners loose, “And every Grief that Poverty persues, “Can those persuade impatient Man to fly “From all he knows An unknown State to try, “And in disdain of Life, resolve uncalled to die? “He long had felt the cruel World's Disdain, “Long had familiar grown with Grief and Pain, “And he could bear them: Time might these amend, “With Hope his Comforter &amp; God his Friend, “But could he know, or could his Mind conceive, “What Sinners dread! and, while they dread, believe? “That there is Suffering in a State to come, “Where none can alter, nought avert the Doom? “Then would th' affrightened Spirit humbly wait, “Nor dare th' appointed Hour anticipate, “Would bear all Ills that he could not prevent, “Nor dare the Deed which no Man can repent. “Behold the Christian Suffering, feels not he “In his Distress a Longing to be free, “Has he not Nerves that tremble, Limbs that shake, “And Grief for those who suffer for his Sake, “Is there not Sorrow in that feeling heart, “That blends with Comfort, when Believers part? “Patient, he waits for the appointed Time, “His Soul submissive, &amp; his Views sublime; “In the dark Hour, if Pain, nay, Fears increase, “And break tumultuous on the Bosom's peace, “He looks to him, who in this mortal Strife “With Pain and Anguish gave for Man his Life, “To him he looks, that pure and spotless One, “Patient, by Faith prepared his Race to run, “And in his Saviour's Words exclaims: ‘Thy Will be done.’” Epitaph on the Lady Margaret North “Beneath this Stone the Mortal Frame “Of Margaret North doth lie, “Of Husbands four the faithful Spouse, “Whose Fame shall never die. “One Robert Francis was the first, “The second Richard hight! “Surnamed Chertsey, Alderman S?
