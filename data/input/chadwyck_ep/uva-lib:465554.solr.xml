      <field name="fulltext">MISS BLAMIRE'S MISCELLANEOUS SONGS. THE TRAVELLER'S RETURN. When silent time, wi' lightly foot, Had trod on thirty years, I sought again my native land Wi' mony hopes and fears: Wha kens gin the dear friends I left May still continue mine? Or gin I e'er again shall taste The joys I left langsyne? As I drew near my ancient pile, My heart beat a' the way; Ilk place I pass'd seem'd yet to speak O' some dear former day; Those days that follow'd me afar, Those happy days o' mine, Whilk made me think the present joys A' naething to langsyne! The ivy'd tower now met my eye, Where minstrels used to blaw; Nae friend stepp'd forth wi' open hand, Nae weel-kenn'd face I saw; Till Donald totter'd to the door, Wham I left in his prime, And grat to see the lad return He bore about langsyne. I ran to ilka dear friend's room, As if to find them there, I knew where ilk ane used to sit, And hang o'er mony a chair; Till soft remembrance threw a veil Across these een o' mine, I clos'd the door, and sobb'd aloud, To think on auld langsyne! Some pensy chiels, a new sprung race Wad next their welcome pay, Wha shudder'd at my Gothic wa's, And wish'd my groves away: âCut, cut,â they cried, âthose aged elms, Lay low yon mournfu' pine:â Na! na! our fathers' names grow there, Memorials o' langsyne. To wean me frae these waefu' thoughts, They took me to the town; But sair on ilka weel-kenn'd face I miss'd the youthfu' bloom. At balls they pointed to a nymph Wham a' declar'd divine; But sure her mother's blushing cheeks Were fairer far langsyne! In vain I sought in music's sound To find that magic art, Which oft in Scotland's ancient lays Has thrill'd through a' my heart: The sang had mony an artfu' turn; My ear confess'd 'twas fine; But miss'd the simple melody I listen'd to langsyne. Ye sons to comrades o' my youth, Forgie an auld man's spleen, Wha 'midst your gayest scenes still mourns The days he ance has seen: When time has past, and seasons fled, Your hearts will feel like mine; And aye the sang will maist delight That minds ye o' langsyne! AND YE SHALL WALK IN SILK ATTIRE. âAnd ye shall walk in silk attire, And siller hae to spare, Gin ye'll consent to be his bride, Nor think o' Donald mair.â O wha wad buy a silken goun Wi' a poor broken heart! Or what's to me a siller croun, Gin frae my love I part! The mind wha's every wish is pure Far dearer is to me; And ere I'm forc'd to break my faith I'll lay me doun an' dee! For I hae pledg'd my virgin troth Brave Donald's fate to share; And he has gi'en to me his heart, Wi' a' its virtues rare. His gentle manners wan my heart, He gratefu' took the gift; Could I but think to seek it backâ It wad be waur than theft! For langest life can ne'er repay The love he bears to me; And ere I'm forc'd to break my troth I'll lay me doun an' dee. THE WAEFU' HEART. Gin living worth could win my heart, You would nae speak in vain; But in the darksome grave it's laid, Never to rise again. My waefu' heart lies low wi' his, Whose heart was only mine; And, O! what a heart was that to lose,â But I maun no repine. Yet, O! gin heaven in mercy soon Would grant the boon I crave, And take this life, now naething worth, Since Jamie's in his grave. And see! his gentle spirit comes To show me on my way; Surpris'd, nae doubt, I still am here,â Sair wondering at my stay. I come, I come, my Jamie dear; And O! wi' what good will I follow wheresoe'er ye lead! Ye canna lead to ill, She said; and soon a deadly pale Her faded cheek possess'd; Her waefu' heart forgot to beat,â Her sorrows sunk to rest. I'M TIBBY FOWLER O' THE GLEN. I'm Tibby Fowler o' the glen, And nae great sight to see; But 'cause I'm rich, these plaguy men Will never let me be. There's bonny Maggy o' the brae As gude as lass can be; But 'cause I'm rich, these plaguy men Hae a' run wud for me. There's Nabob Jock comes strutting ben, He think's the day's his ain; But were he a' hung round wi' goud, He'd find himsel mista'en. There's Wat aye tries to glowre and sigh That I may guess the cause; But, Jenny-like, I hate to spell Dumb Roger's hums and ha's. There's grinning Pate laughs a' day through, The blithest lad you'll see; But troth he laughs sae out o' place, He'd laugh gin I did dee. There's Sandy, he's sae fou o' lear, To talk wi' him is vain; For gin we a' should say 'twas fair, He'd prove that it did rain. Then Jamie frets for good and ill, 'Bout sma' things maks a phrase; And fears and frets, and things o' nought Ding o'er his joyfu' days. The priests and lawyers ding me dead, But gude kens wha's the best; And then comes in the soldier brave, And drums out a' the rest. The country squire and city beau, I've had them on their knee; But weel I ken to goud they bow, And no downright to me. Should like o' them come ilka day, They may wear out the knee; And grow to the groun' as fast as stane, But they shall ne'er get me. WHEN SEVEREST FOES IMPENDING. When severest foes impending Seem to threaten dangers near, Unexpected joys attending Ease your mind and banish care. Though to fortune's frowns subjected, And depress'd by anxious care, Servile souls are soon dejected,â Noble minds will ne'er despair! Prithee, friend, why then so serious? Nought is got by grief or care; Melancholy grows imperious When it comes to domineer. Be it business, love, or sorrow, That does now distress thy mind, Bid them call again to-morrow, We to mirth are now inclin'd. TO-MORROW. WRITTEN DURING SICKNESS. How sweet to the heart is the thought of to-morrow When Hope's fairy pictures bright colours display; How sweet when we can from Futurity borrow A balm for the griefs which afflict us to-day! When wearisome sickness has taught me to languish For Health, and the blessings it bears on its wing; Let me hope (ah! how soon would it lessen my anguish), That to-morrow will ease and serenity bring. The pilgrim sojourning alone, unbefriended, Hopes, joyful, to-morrow his wanderings shall cease; That at home, and with care sympathetic attended, He shall rest unmolested, and slumber in peace. When six days of labour each other succeeding, The husbandman toils with his spirits depress'd; What pleasure to think, as the last is receding, To-morrow will be a sweet Sabbath of rest! And when the vain shadows of Time are retiring, When life is fast fleeting, and death is in sight, The Christian believing, exulting, expiring, Beholds a to-morrow of endless delight! The Infidel then sees no joyous to-morrow, Yet he knows that his moments must hasten away; Poor wretch! can he feel without heart-rending sorrow, That his joys and his life must expire with to-day! MISS GILPIN'S SONG. Let lords and fine ladies look round them and see If e'er ane amang them be blyther than me; I sit at my wheely and sing thro' the day, And ca't my ain warld that runs rolling away. Sae twirl thee round, wheely, I'll sing while I may; I'll try to be happy the hale o' the day: If we wadna mak griefs o' bit trisles sae sma', The warld wad run smoothly roun', roun' wi' us a'. There's ups and downs in it I see very plain, For the spoke that's at bottom, gets topmost again; Sae twirl thee round, wheely, I see how things turn, And I see too 'tis folly for mortals to mourn. Sae twirl thee round, wheely, &amp;c. That life is a spinster I often have read, And too fine she draws out her spider-like thread; A breath can destroy what's so slenderly made, And life for her trouble has seldom been paid. Sae twirl thee round, wheely, &amp;c. 'TIS FOR GLORY WE FIGHT. Come join us, brave countrymen, now is the time For Englishmen's courage and valour to shine; O come, take up arms, 'tis for glory we fight, To punish our foes and our freedom to right. If a soldier in battle should happen to fall, He's lov'd, he's lamented, he's honoured by all; Or if he by chance leave a limb in the field There's Chelsea and pension misfortune to shield. But come turn your thoughts to the prospect of peace Our watchings, our marchings, our dangers shall cease, In barracks our wants are all fully supplied Sufficient for nature we care not beside. And when to a town or a village we come The lassies all flock to the beat of the drum; Their honest old sweethearts they set them at nought, They slight even a laird for a bonny red-coat. We range thro' the world and we vary the scene We please where we go from fourscore to fifteen; And, then, when our locks look respectably gray, âThere goes an old veteran, O bless him,â they say. THE BANKS OF YARROW. Why sighs the heart midst wealth and store? Why all the anguish of the great? Sure riches can elude the sigh, And bribe the tear to shun the eye. If so let's grasp the golden store, And ev'ry moment gather more; While milkmaids careless of to-morrow, Are wand'ring on the banks of Yarrow. Yet riches ne'er should be denied A source of bliss if right applied; For misery on her flock-worn bed May sure be built a warmer shed; And every ill that want can bring 'Tis happy wealth's to blunt the sting; To help poor love to gain his marrow And make a paradise on Yarrow. If happiness you'd keep in view The paths of splendour ne'er pursue; The frowns of fortune likewise shun, Or else you strive to be undone; Watch o'er the feelings of the heartâ Forbid, nor yet indulge the smart: Give much to joyâsome tears to sorrow, And make the mind the banks of Yarrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISS BLAMIRE'S POEMS. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF A PLOVER. Low bend thy head thou waving spray, Soft drop the dew that falls on thee, That still the early rising day A tear on every leaf may see. Soft may the zephyr whisper thro' Thy rustling leaves, and seem to sigh, For here beneath that pensive bough The tender Plover closed her eye. Tyrannic man with iron hand Had snatch'd her from domestic love; And in the soft connubial band Distress her cutting thread had wove. A harsh, unfeeling, cruel mate Imperious held the lordly sway, And seem'd to think the will of fate Was but to make the weak obey. The soft communicative hour, The wish to please, the tender care, The history of each opening flower Were sweets of love she ne'er must share. Contempt her distance threw between, Unsocial hours their languor cast, Joyless became each flowery scene, And soon the fret of life was past. Blow soft ye winds, descend ye showers, Still murmur round this little heap, That eve may from more gloomy bowers, Be tempted here to stop and weep. EXPECTATION. Sweet expectation! sister fair Of soft solicitude and prayer, Allied to hope, allied to fear, Those joint companions of the year, Who thro' all chequer'd scenes must run That fall beneath the rolling sun; And light and shade to pictures give Where men are drawn that really live. Now lively hope in frolic measure Trips in the silken round of pleasure, And still with joy-shot glance proposes Sweet walks, midst groves tied up with roses: Where fancy keeps her glow-worm court, Where wearied wishes all resort, Who mixing in her tinsell'd train Still keep their title light and vain. For now with Fancy's glass they see That long sought spot in destiny Which hope had ever in her view And which her hand keeps pointing to. Tho' oft her castles rest on air, And golden clouds the columns are, Till from beneath the farthest mound Pale fearâthat starts at her own soundâ A train of vapours brings along, Which winding all the scenes among, Forms here and there a misty veil Now hides the hill and now the dale. While Hope to find a purer air Strays far from hence we know not where; Till expectation wandering near Lifts up the veil drawn close by fear. 'Tis then we see the playful maid So busy in the opening glade, A tuft of roses scatter here, A bed of lilies sprinkle there, Along the meads carnations throw, And sod-seats make where hare-bells grow. Where o'er the stream the poplars bend, The woodbines little arms extend, While climbing up its curls diffuse The sweets of long-collected dews. A thousand knots fond hope will tie Entangling oft the wandering eye; She, like the sun-beam, ever throws The loveliest tincture on the rose, Hide but a while her gilding ray The fleeting colour cannot stay, Tho' nature's cunning hand should try To mix it for the admiring eye. In expectation scenes arise That drop not from the bounteous skies The groves bestow a cooler shade, And softer sounds by streams are made; More sweetly blows the fragrant breeze, More softly whisper whispering trees; While every insect gilds his wing, And every bird essays to sing. How blissful is this state of mind Thro' which such scenes of pleasure wind, Thro' which lone thought can safely stray, Delighted, though she lose her way: Still certain that the path will end Where happiness would seat a friend. Yet even amidst these sacred bowers The blest retreat of cheerful hours, The tender heart will sometimes sigh And the round tear fill up the eye; Solicitude will hither come Whose numerous wishes keep her dumb, And panting with both hope and fear Will now retreat, now venture near; Will sometimes essay to believe Then doubt again that all deceive; That promises are shadowy things Which flit away on airy wings; That joy will never meet the heart For those who love must live apart. Ah! cease, Solicitude to dwell On ills, alas! we know too well; Too well we know hope will deceive, Yet they're ne'er blest who ne'er believe. The present hour is all we boast And happiest they who prize it most; Who most enjoy the good it brings Deserve the best of nature's things; And grateful be that heart esteem'd Who most of happiness has dream'd. THE ADIEU AND RECALL TO LOVE. Go, idle boy, I quit thy power, Thy couch of many a thorn and flower, Thy twanging bow, thine arrow keen, Deceitful Beauty's timid mien; The feign'd surprise, the roguish leer, The tender smile, the thrilling tear, Have now no pangsâno joys for me, So, fare thee well, for I am free! Then flutter hence on wanton wing, Or lave thee in yon lucid spring, Or take thy beverage from the rose, Or on Louisa's breast repose, I wish thee well for pleasures past, Yet bless the hour I'm free at last! But sure methinks the alter'd day Scatters around a mournful ray; And chilly every zephyr blows, And every stream untuneful flows, No rapture swells the linnet's voice, No more the vocal groves rejoice; And e'en thy song, sweet bird of eve With whom I lov'd so oft to grieve, Now, scarce regarded, meets my ear Unanswer'd by a sigh or tear; No more with devious steps I choose To brush the mountain's morning dews; To drink the spirit of the breeze, Or wander midst o'er-arching trees; Or woo with undisturb'd delight The pale-cheek'd Virgin of the night, That, peering through the leafy bower, Throws on the ground a silver shower. Alas! is all this boasted ease To lose each warm desire to please? No sweet solicitude to know For other's bliss, for other's woe, A frozen apathy to findâ A sad vacuity of mind? O! hasten back, thou heavenly boy, And with thine anguish bring thy joy; Return with all thy torments here, And let me hope, and doubt, and fear; O! rend my heart with every pain, But, let me, let me love again! THE LILY AND THE ROSE. The Rose, I own, has many a charm To win the partial eye; Her sweets remain to glad the sense E'en when her colours fly: Just so good humour charms the heart, After a face once fair Parts with its bloom, and withering time Has planted wrinkles there. But should I ask from beauty's store A tint to gain the heart, It should not be the blooming tinge Which looks so like to art. No; spread along the downy cheek The tender Lily fair, And soon the eye shall teach the heart To find an interest there. The bending form, the drooping head, Shall dwell upon the mind, And ever round the feelings strong Some soft affection wind. So Flora, once in pensive mood, Pronounc'd the fix'd decree, When passing many a flaunting flower, She dropped a tear o'er thee; âOthers,â said she, âmay charm the eye, And fancied joys impart; But thou shalt learn the secret way That wins into the heart. Within thy bell this pearl shall rest, Which seems a lucid tear, The only gem that Pity loves To tremble in her ear. Then let Health make the blooming Rose The favourite of her bower;â The eye may woo the flow'ret gay, The heart shall own thy power.â THE OLD SOLDIER'S TALE. (FROM âSTOKLEWATH.â) But hark! what sounds of mingl'd joy and woe From yon poor cottage bursting seem to flow. 'Tis honest Sarah's. Soldier-Harry's come, And, after all his toils, got safely home. âWelcome, old soldier, welcome from the wars! Honour the man, my lads, seam'd o'er with scars! Come give's thy hand, and bring another can, And tell us all thou'st done, and seen, my man.â Now expectation stares in every eye, The jaw falls down, and every soul draws nigh, With ear turn'd up, and head held all awry. âWhy, sir, the papers tell you all that's done, What battle's lost, and what is hardly won. But when the eye looks into private woes, And sees the grief that from one battle flows, Small cause of triumph can the bravest feel, For never yet were brave hearts made of steel. âIn a dark and dismal corner once I found A youth, whose blood was pouring through the wound; No sister's hand, no tender mother's eye To stanch that wound was fondly standing by; Famine had done her work, and low were laid The loving mother and the blooming maid. He rais'd his eyes, and bade me strike the blow, I've nought to lose, he cried, so fear no foe; No foe is near, I softly made reply, A soldier, friend, would save and not destroy. Well; as I dress'd the youth, I found 'twas he That oft had charm'd the sentinels and me; From post to post like lightning he would fly, And pour down thunder from his red-hot sky; We prais'd him for't,âso I my captain told, For well I knew he lik'd the foe that's bold; So then the surgeon took him in his charge, And the captain made him prisoner at large.â âWas he a Spaniard, or a Frenchman, whether? But it's no matter; they're all rogues together!â âYou're much mistaken: Goodness I have found Springs like the grass that clothes the common ground; Some more, some less, you know, grows every where; Some soils are fertile, and some are but bare. Nay, 'mongst the Indians I've found kindly cheer, And as much pity as I could do here! Once in their woods I stray'd a length of way, And thought I'd known the path that homeward lay; We'd gone to forage, but I lost the rest, Which, till quite out of hearing, never guess'd. I halloo'd loud, some voices made reply, But not my comrades; not one friend was nigh. Some men appear'd, their faces painted o'er, The wampum-belt, and tomahawk they bore; Their ears were hung with beads, that largely spread A breadth of wing, and cover'd half the head. I kiss'd the ground; one older than the rest Stepp'd forth, and laid his hand upon my breast, Then seiz'd my arms, and sign'd that I should go, And learn with them to bend the sturdy bow: I bow'd and follow'd; sadly did I mourn, And never more expected to return. We travell'd on some days through woods alone, At length we reach'd their happy silent home. âA few green acres the whole plot compose, Which woods surround, and fencing rocks enclose, Skirting whose banks, a river fond of play Sometimes stood still, and sometimes ran away; The branching deer would drink the dimpl'd tide, And crop the wild herbs on its flowery side,â Around the silent hut would sometimes stray, Then, at the sight of man, bound swift away; But all in vain; the hunter's flying dart Springs from the bow, and quivers in the hart. A mother and four daughters here we found, With shells encircled, and with feathers crown'd, Bright pebbles shone amidst the plaited hair, While lesser shells surround the moon-like ear. With screams at sight of me away they flew (For fear or pleasure springs from what is new); Then, to their brothers, screaming still they ran, Thinking my clothes and me the self-same man; When bolder grown, they ventur'd something near, Light touch'd my coat, but started back with fear. When time and use had chas'd their fears away, And I had learned some few short words to say, They oft would tell me, that I should allow The rampant lion to o'erhang my brow, And on my cheek the spotted leopard wear, Stretch out my ears, and let my arms go bare. Tho' different in their manners, yet their heart Was equal mine in every better part. Brave to a fault, if courage fault can be; Kind to their fellows, doubly kind to me. Some little arts my travell'd judgment taught, Which tho' a prize to them, seem'd greater than they ought. âNeedless with bows for me the woods to roam, I therefore tried to do some good at home. The birds, or deer, or boars, were all their food, Save the swift salmon of the silver flood; And when the long storms the winter-stores would drain, Hunger might ask the stinted meal in vain. Some goats I saw that brows'd the rocks among, And oft I thought to trap their playful young; But not till first a fencing hedge surrounds Their future fields, and the enclosure bounds; For many a father owns a hatchet here, Which falls descending to his wealthy heir. The playful kid we from the pitfall bring, O'erspread with earth, and many a tempting thing; Light lay the branches o'er the treacherous deep, And favourite herbs among the long grass creep. The little prisoner soon is taught to stand, And crop the food from the betrayer's hand. A winter-store now rose up to their view, And in another field the clover grew; But, without scythes or hooks, how could we lay The ridgy swath and turn it into hay? At last, of stone we form'd a sort of spade, Broad at the end, and sharp, for cutting made; We push'd along, the tender grass gave way, And soon the sun turn'd every pile to hay, It was not long before the flocks increased, And I first gave the unknown milky feast. Some clay I found, and useful bowls I made, Tho', I must own, I marr'd the potter's trade; Yet use is everythingâthey did the same As if from China the rude vessels came. The curdling cheese I taught them next to press; And twirl'd on strings the roasting meat to dress. In all the woods the Indian corn was found, Whose grains I scatter'd in the fruitful ground; The willing soil leaves little here to do, Or asks the furrows of the searching plough; Yet something like one with delight I made, For tedious are the labours of the spade, The coulter and the sock were pointed stone, The eager brothers drew the traces on, I stalk'd behind and threw the faithful grain, And wooden harrows clos'd the earth again: Soon sprung the seed, and soon 'twas in the ear, Nor wait the golden sheaves the falling year; In this vast clime two harvests load the field, And fifty crops th'exhaustless soil can yield. âSome bricks I burnt, and now a house arose, Finer than ought the Indian chieftain knows; A wicker door, with clay-like plaster lin'd, Serv'd to exclude the piercing wintry wind; A horn-glaz'd window gave a scanty light, But lamps cheer'd up the gloom of lengthen'd night; The cotton shrub through all the woods had run, And plenteous wicks our rocks and spindles spun. Around their fields the yam I taught to grow, With all the fruits they either love or know. The bed I rais'd from the damp earth, and now Some little comfort walk'd our dwelling through. My fame was spread: the neighbouring Indians came, View'd all our works, and strove to do the same. The wampum-belt my growing fame records, That tells great actions without help of words. I gain'd much honour, and each friend would bring 'Mong various presents many a high-priz'd thing. And when, with many a prayer, I ask once more To seek my friends, and wander to the shore, They all consent,âbut drop a sorrowing tear, While many a friend his load of skins would bear. Riches were mine; but fate will'd it not so,â They grew the treasure of the Spanish foe; My Indian friends threw down their fleecy load, And, like the bounding elk, leap'd back into the wood, âWhat though a prisoner! countrymen I found, Heard my own tongue, and bless'd the cheerful sound; It seem'd to me as if my home was there, And every dearest friend would soon appear. At length a cartel gave us back to share The wounds and dangers of a bloody war. Peace dawn'd at last, and now the sails were spread, Some climb the ship unhurt, some few half dead. Not this afflicts the gallant soldier's mind, What is't to him tho' limbs are left behind! Chelsea a crutch and bench will yet supply, And be the veteran's dear lost limb and eye! âWhen English ground first struck the sailor's view, Huzza! for England, roar'd the jovial crew. The waving crutch leaped up in every hand, While one poor leg was left alone to stand; The very name another limb bestows, And through the artery the blood now flows. We reach'd the shore, and kiss'd the much-lov'd ground, And fondly fancied friends would crowd around; But few with wretchedness acquaintance claim, And little pride is every way the same. âIn coming down, the seeing eye of day Darken'd around me, and I lost my way. Where'er a light shot glimmering through the trees, I thither urg'd my weary trembling knees, Tapp'd at the door, and begg'd in piteous tone, They'd let a wandering soldier find his home; They barr'd the door, and bade me beg elsewhere, They'd no spare beds for vagabonds to share. This was the tale where'er I made a halt, And greater houses grew upon the fault; The dog was loos'd to keep me far at bay, And saucy footmen bade me walk away, Or else a constable should find a home For wandering captains from the wars new come. Alas! thought I, is this the soldier's praise For loss of health, of limb, and length of days? And is this England?âEngland, my delight! For whom I thought it glory but to fightâ That has no covert for the soldier's night!â</field>
